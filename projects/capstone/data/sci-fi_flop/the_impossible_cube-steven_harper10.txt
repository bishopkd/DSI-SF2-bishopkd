Gavin clambered down from his mechanical with Feng as a reluctant shadow.They found themselves in a wide, long room that seemed to be a receiving area.Alice sniffed the air.Ozone, hot steel, and something else.A chemical smell she couldnt identify, but one that made her heart beat unaccountably faster and brought a hint of fear to her chest.She glanced at Gavin and Feng.Were they feeling it too?Click seemed unbothered.He took them through another doorway and down a set of stairs.Their footsteps echoed off metal and stone.The spiders feet clicked across the floor, and the whirligigs propellers made a sound like hummingbird wings.Did you hear something?Gavin said hoarsely.I thought I heard something.Were just nervous, Alice replied.Her mouth was dry and her hands were shaking.Good heavens, Im so nervous.I dont understand.I am not, Feng said.The chemical smell was stronger down here.Alice sniffed again, and her heart lurched.Its that smell.A gas, Gavin said.Some sort of airborne chemical that causes a fear reaction.Dr.Clef must have created it to frighten the workers away.It doesnt bother Click or the little automatons because theyre mechanical.And Feng is Alice trailed off.Feng touched his own spider.Yes.At least the worst of it has cleared out, Gavin continued quickly.Or I think wed be running, too.Wheres Click gotten to?They found him waiting at the bottom of the stairs.A whining, humming noise came from the other side of a heavy door, which was marked with Cyrillic writing.I believe it says Power Production, Feng translated.And thats where well find Dr.Clef.Alice flung the door open with her iron hand.Chapter Fifteen  The soft whine burst into full volume.The room beyond the door was long and high, fully the size of a dirigible hangar.Five turbines, nearly flush with the floor, occupied most of the space.They looked to Gavin like giant coiled seashells of segmented metal, each thirty feet across.Automatically he tried to calculate diameter and radius, but he kept running into pi, a number nearly as bad as the square root of two, and he forced himself to stop.A covered shaft in the center of each turbine was connected to an electrical generator.The shafts spun at a dizzying 180 revolutions per minute.Under Gavins feet, he felt water rushing through the turbines and sensed immense kinetic power barely held in check by the sturdy walls of the dam.It was at the same time intoxicating and intimidating.Near the third turbine stood an arc of lacy metal just high enough for a man to walk under.At the spot in the arc normally occupied by the keystone was Gavins paradox generator.A table filled with a snarl of equipment sat next to the arc.In the middle of the long floor near the pile of equipment was the plump form of Dr.Clef.He wore dark goggles over his eyes.A snarl of cables connected the central turbines generator to the machinery, and a smell of solder in the air said Dr.Clef had been welding.He looked up and pulled his goggles off when Alice shoved the door open.His face burst into a cheerful grin.I thought you all might arrive soon, he called over the turbine whine.And you brought my clicky kitty.So kind of you.Doctor, you have to stop, Gavin called back.You dont want to do this.He looked genuinely perplexed.But Im doing this for you, my boy.Everything is calculated and calibrated.In a moment, youll have all the time in the universe.You can save the world at last.Before any of them could respond to this, or even move, Dr.Clef threw a switch.The whine increased, and power snaked up the cable, through the machinery, and into the delicate arc.All the turbines slowed as the generators engaged and the arc drained their power.The arc glowed an electric blue, and the space within filled with light, first red, then orange, then yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.Gavins mind flicked back to a moment in the stone corridors beneath the Third Ward, a moment when he dropped the Impossible Cube and it changed colors as it fell in exactly the reverse order he was seeing now.Dont!Alice cried.She ran toward him.Gavin grabbed Fengs arm and ran as well, though they were a good hundred feet away.Dr.Clef smiled beatifically and struck a large tuning fork on the table.A pure A rang through the room, and Gavin remembered that he had sung that same note in the same octave on the night he had caressed Alice with his voice and made the Cube vanish in the Doomsday Vault.It was the same note Dr.Clef had struck the day he had completed the Impossible Cube in his laboratory at the Third Ward and accidentally made the Cube disappear through time.Gavin had struck the fork again to bring the Cube back.A.  The first note.The pure tone that rang through time and space and called the Cube to itself.Dr.Clef pressed the handle of the fork to the arc, and the arcs light became a white so beautiful, it made Gavins heart ache.They werent even halfway to him when Dr.Clef reached into the opening.It snapped and growled as it swallowed his hand.Gavin stared in fascination even as horror crawled over his skin.His steps faltered.The machines were hypnotic, thrilling.He was watching the most brilliant clockworker the world had ever seen bend time itself to his will with a unique machine.He was also watching the most powerful act of destruction in the history of the universe.He cannot.Feng tugged at his arm now, trying to hurry him forward.He will not.Dr.Clef whipped his hand out of the arc.The metal glowed bright as the sun.Alice, who was several paces ahead of Gavin, stopped in her tracks and threw up her arm to protect her eyes.Her little automatons squeaked in fear, and Click hissed.The glow faded a little, and when Gavins vision cleared, he saw Dr.Clef was holding the Impossible Cube.Shit, Gavin whispered.My Cube, Dr.Clef crooned.Mein liebes, schones Kubchen.The Cube was just as Gavin remembered it.It was only the size of a hatbox, but its intricate metal lattice twisted the eye.The back seemed to shift to the front, or perhaps the front was fading into the back.One of the bottom struts crossed impossibly over the top.It shouldnt have existed, but it did.Behind it, the arc continued to glow with holy fire.Gavin shook off the fascination and started forward again with Feng.Alice did the same.He was in a dream, running through tar and molasses.Dr.Clef popped a pair of protectors over his ears and flipped another switch.The paradox generator atop the arc cranked to life, and the double tritone rippled through the chamber like demons and angels at war, amplified by the arcs power so that the noise was clear even over the turbine whine.Gavin dropped to his knees at the terrible perfection of it.Alice and Feng kept running.They had nearly reached Dr.Clefs table, with Click and Alices automatons following in an angry brass cloud.Gavin admired her determination and tenacity, her beauty and power.Dr.Clef picked up another fork, and the small part of Gavins brain that wasnt enthralled by the perfect, rapturous sound of his own generator noted the length of the prongs.D sharp.Alice gathered herself to leap at him.Nicht, said Dr.Clef, though the word was barely audible over the turbines and tritones.He struck the fork and pressed it to the side of the Cube.Instantly a cone of sound blasted from the Cube and through the fork.It hit Alice and shoved her backward into Feng.The two of them toppled to the ground.The little automatons were scattered in all directions, rotors and legs bent and laboring.Click bowled over backward.A piece of Gavins awareness flashed hot anger at Alices injury, but the rest of him remained consumed by the tritone paradox.Then an edge of the cone caught him.It simultaneously dampened the tritone paradox and slapped him in the face.His ears rang.Abruptly, the sound was no longer so hypnotic.Gavin leaped to his feet and automatically ran toward Alice.Im fine!she gasped.Stop him!Help her, Feng, Gavin said.Help us!Do whatever it takes to help!And without waiting for an answer, he ran toward Dr.Clefs table.Another cable ran from the paradox generator.It ended in a clip that Dr.Clef was ready to connect to the Impossible Cube.But now Gavin was close enough.He raised his wristband, aimed fast, and fired.The cog spun through the air and knocked Dr.Clefs hand aside.He yelped but didnt drop the clip.The ringing in Gavins ears continued to muffle the tritones, though he heard enough for it to be a distraction.Dr.Clef blinked at Gavin, who was already aiming another cog.There was only one left, and there was only one choice of what to do with it.Grimly, he cranked the magnetic power as high as it would go.Flung at full strength, a spinning cog would slice through flesh and bone like butter.Dr.Clef glanced at the wristband, his brilliant mind making instant connections, and Gavin saw the understanding in the eyes of his mentor, a man who, despite a few arguments, had never been anything but kind and helpful to Gavin, who wanted only to help him now.Gavins legs trembled, but his aim remained firm.You wont, Dr.Clef said, though Gavin was more reading his lips than hearing his voice.I have to, Gavin said, and started to move his finger.I can show you your father, Dr.Clef said.Gavin froze.Yes.The Cube and the arc can see through time.I can show you your father as he was.You can see where he went and where he is now.He really is alive?The idea rocked Gavin harder than the tritone paradox.The vague memory of his fathers voice sang softly in his head.I had a ship, my ship must flee  Sailing oer the clouds and on the silver sea.He longed to hear that voice again, learn where his own voice had come from.Learn why his father had left.Did he go away because of me?Gavin whispered.Was it because I wasnt as good at music as he was?Was I a bad son?Gavin!Alice cried.Stop him!We can look, Dr.Clef mouthed.We can seek.We can find.It is easy, Gavin.You will discover, uncover, ascertain.Ice slid down Gavins spine.No.Youre lying!Its a lie!Gavin fired, and the entire world slowed for him.The cog spun lazily through the air, teeth catching light and splitting it into a trillion particles that scattered like drops of syrup.Dr.Clef, with inhuman reflexes, snapped the clip connecting the paradox generator to the Impossible Cube.A blue rose of a spark bloomed and just as quickly flickered into death.The cog continued its long, slow spin.The paradox generator fell silent as all its energy drained into the Cube.Dr.Clefs facial muscles stretched toward a smile.The cog whirled, heating the air an infinitesimal amount as it passed, and smashed into the paradox generator.Utter silence fell over the entire chamber.Then a terrible, discordant sound boomed through the room.Time snapped back to its normal pace.The light within the arc flickered and spun like the eye of a hurricane.A terrible red light poured into the turbine room.Within the eye of the arc, Gavin saw gently flowing water, blue and calm, as if he were looking up from the bottom of a pool or river.His mind leaped from connection to connection, and he realized he was looking at a hole that punched through a dozen dimensions and opened into the past, into a number of time periods in the past, and he could see where the river had once flowed through this spot.At that moment, a force very much like gravity pulled him toward the arc.He resisted and turned to flee, but it grew stronger with every passing second.It was like running through water.Two of Alices little automatons were sucked squeaking toward the arc.They struggled against the force that pulled at them, but their propellers had been damaged by the Impossible Cube and in the end they were dragged through the arc.The automatons sheered and shredded and vanished with a human sounding scream.On the other side, the water bubbled and boiled like a cauldron, though it stayed on the other side.The Impossible Cube sat perfectly still on the table.Dr.Clef managed to wrap his arms around one of the table legs and hold on.Gavin, now on hands and knees, made it back to Alice, who was still lying on the ground.She had braced her feet against an outcrop of brick on the floor and had caught hold of Fengs wrist with her iron bound hand.The spiders eyes glowed green.How were they going to get out?Gavin felt himself being dragged backward.Alices hair was drawn forward over her face.Fear for himself and for Alice and Feng made Gavins heart beat against his spine.The force abruptly strengthened, and it lifted Feng bodily from the ground.Wind roared through the turbine room.Hang on, Feng!Alice cried.Dont let go!And then Gavin lost his grip on the floor and tumbled backward toward the arc.Susan Phipps felt the strange pull even on the staircase, and she nearly lost her balance.So did Glenda, who only saved herself by clutching at the handrail.What the bloody hell?Glenda said.Its that clockworker, Phipps replied.If I read those notes we found on the train correctly, hes planning to do something with time.Michaels and Ennock must be helping him.Her fury grew.It felt like she had been chasing Alice Michaels and Gavin Ennock for most of her life.She couldnt remember when shed last had a good nights sleep or actually enjoyed a meal or simply sat and rested.Michaels and Ennock had become her entire world, and when had that happened?A sudden urge overcame her, an overwhelming desire to simply turn and walk away.No one would know except Glenda, and she would keep her mouth shut if ordered.It would be so easy.Then an image of her father standing on the front steps with the carpet bags at his feet sprang into her mind.Justice and fairness, always.They had gotten her where she was now.It was impossible to give them up just because it was inconvenient.She firmed her jaw and continued more carefully down the stairs, ready to do what was right.And if her current path was wrong?Even unjust?She paused for a long moment, caught between balanced concepts.Lieutenant?Glenda asked behind her.Phipps abruptly straightened her back.Im fine, she said sharply.Lets keep going.At the bottom, she found the door already open, and beyond lay an enormous room filled with giant metal snail shells, strange machinery, and the very people shed been chasing all this time.A metal arc glowed an evil red and seemed to be sucking everything greedily into itself, gaining power with every passing moment.Even as she watched, two of Alices little automatons were sucked into it and destroyed.The other automatons, including that stupid cat Click, managed to limp around to the back of one of the turbines and cling there as Alice braced herself against a line of bricks on the floor.The force reached outward and pulled at Phipps even more strongly.Whats happening?Glenda said.Run up and grab that rope from the top of the stairwell.Phipps drew a multiple coil dispersal pistol that she had snatched from the Cossack armory and twisted the charging unit.It whined with eager power.Were going to end this.Alice saw Gavin go by.Without thinking, she flung out her right hand and actually managed to catch his arm.Her shoulders burned.She was holding two men now, with her feet braced against the brick outcrop as wind tore past her face and hair.Her eyes met Gavins.Oh God her grip was slipping, and it felt like her arms were coming out of their sockets.Feng clutched her forearm with the power she had ordered him to use.She couldnt keep this up.The dreadful force increased again.Alice screamed, still holding on.Let go!Feng shouted.His words came out framed by the horrible spider on his face.Alice, let me go!If you dont, well all die!The idea was unthinkable.Guilt overwhelmed her.It was her fault Feng was in this position in the first place.She could save him.She would save him.Both him and Gavin.No!she shouted back.I wont let you die!You cant save us both, he said.Some people dont want to be saved.Let go!Her arms burned like lava and her fingers quivered.Dr.Clef huddled at the table, able to use his arms and legs to resist the power of the arc.Alice swallowed.She had been forced to give up her mother, her brother, and her father.Why should she give up her friend?Let me go, Alice!Feng shouted.I can help!A tear formed in her eye and leaped across the room into the boiling water of the arc.She didnt have the strength to save them both, to save everyone.Either a few would die, or everyone would die.It wasnt fair, but it would be even worse to let everyone perish because she couldnt let go.She looked at Gavin again, and he nodded.With a scream of agony and anger, she let Feng go.Feng flew backward, straight toward the arc.But as he fell, he angled his body so that he struck the table.Even over the wind, Alice heard bone snap, though Fengs face remained stoic.He bounced sideways and managed to latch on to Dr.Clef.Was, denn?Dr.Clef sputtered.Feng snap punched him twice.Dr.Clefs eyes glazed over, and he let go of the table.Together Feng and Dr.Clef fell toward the arc and hit the eye.Alice wanted to look away, but couldnt.When the two men struck the eye, flesh and bone shredded as if forced through a sieve made of razors.A cloud of blood and meat misted before the arc, hung for a tiny moment, and was sucked into the boiling water beyond.Alice cried out again.Do whatever it takes to help!Gavin had ordered.Feng had done exactly that and gotten just what he had wanted.Alice felt only heart wrenching sorrow.Gavin grabbed hold of Alices free hand, the one with the spider on it, and the spiders eyes glowed red.It was easier to hold on to one person, though she couldnt do it indefinitely, and whatever force was pulling them toward the arc showed no signs of abating.Her desperation grew, as did the fear on Gavins face.What do we do?she shouted.He shook his head.His feet were trying to find purchase on the brick floor, but they were continually drawn out from under him.His hand slipped, and Alice forced herself to grab harder, though she was growing more and more tired.You have the cure, he yelled.Let me go and save yourself!A cold fist clutched her heart and her breath came hard.Not you.Never you!Alice   And then Susan Phipps was there.A rope was wrapped around her waist and she was playing it out with her mechanical hand like a mountain climber.Her silver streaked hair streamed out like Alices.The sight was so surprising, it took Alice a moment to understand what who she was looking at.Youre both idiots, Phipps shouted.From a holster at her waist, she drew a fat pistol.Alices heart sank, though she didnt dare loosen her grip on Gavin to defend herself.Still, it was too much.Damn you!she shouted back.Kill us, then!See if it makes you feel better.Phipps!Gavin cried.Dont!Phipps fired straight at the top of the turbine.A red beam lanced through the air and struck the spot where the shaft met the generator.Smoke formed and was pulled into the boiling arc.Then the generator shaft jumped away from the turbine shaft with a terrible grinding noise.Deprived of its energy source, the generator powered down.The arcs glow faded, the eye and the boiling water vanished.Gavin dropped on top of Alice as the force abruptly ceased.The Impossible Cube trembled for a moment, went still, then released a burst of red energy.Alice braced herself for another slamming, but the energy went through her with only a strange sensation, as if something briefly crawled over all her bones at once.The Cube darkened, though it continued to give off a faint phosphorescent blue light.Alice lay panting beneath Gavin.His weight was both welcome and crushing at the same time.Her arms had the strength of wet string, and she couldnt even summon the energy to ask him to move.At last he heaved himself aside and dragged himself upright on trembling limbs to face Phipps, who was calmly untying the rope from around her waist and winding her hair back into a twist.If you had done that from the start, none of this would have happened, Phipps said.For all your talent, youre still a rookie, Agent Ennock.Why?Gavin gasped, echoing Alices thoughts.I dont answer to you, Phipps replied coolly.And you are welcome.Er thank you.Alice felt like an admonished schoolgirl.We shouldnt stay, Phipps added.I dont think its safe.Alice summoned the strength to sit up.Oh, come now!After everything you put us through, you owe us an explanation and you damned well know it!Phipps sighed and thawed a little.If I can make the great Alice, Baroness Michaels, curse, I suppose I can offer an explanation.She looked away for a moment.Into the Doomsday Vault, Ive put clockworker inventions that could uproot islands, let people move instantly from place to place, and make the human race immortal.But an invention that would stop time She shook her head.I was so worried about justice itself that I lost sight of whom justice was for.What justice is there in letting clockworkers seize destiny from mankind?The time of the clockworker needs to end, and it needs to end now.What does that mean to us?Gavin was weaving, but kept his feet.It means, Mr.Ennock, that I am personally going to escort you and the baroness to China to spread her cure.It is fair.Goddamn you, Lieutenant!Glenda Teasdale appeared in the door to the stairwell with a pistol of her own.After all this, you turn out like Simon?Ill see you in hell!Agent Teasdale!Phipps barked.Lower your weapon!Michaels stole everything from me!Glenda moved farther into the room, her pistol still trained on Alice.She stole my profession and my life!She has to pay.It would not be just, Agent Teasdale, Phipps said.Shes already paid, and paid, and paid.And so have we.Its time to stop.For both of us.Glenda was breathing fast.Alice was so tired, she could barely move, but from somewhere she found a reserve of strength that let her come to her feet.Glenda, she said, youve done so much for me.You were an exemplar to me, and without you, I would never have struck out on my own.I did a terrible thing to you in return.Im sorry for what I did to you.I wish I could take it back.If you want to shoot, Ill understand.And she moved in front of Phipps.Gavin tried to stop her, but she shook him off.She stood there, unarmed but for her iron spider, her arms spread wide.Too many people had died for her.She could die for someone else now.Glenda took aim.Alice held her breath but refused to close her eyes.Glenda lowered the pistol.Goddamn you, she said again, but this time to Alice.Im sorry, Alice said, and was surprised at how disappointed she was that Glenda hadnt pulled the trigger.What am I to do with my life?Glenda asked bitterly.If you can control your impulse to curse, Phipps said, perhaps you should go into politics.I can give you a letter of introduction that will go over quite well with the Hats On Committee in Parliament.Gavin, meanwhile, staggered over to the table where the arc stood.Silently, he picked up the Impossible Cube.A lump formed in Alices throat.She joined Gavin and took his hand.Click clicked across the floor as well and sat at Alices feet.He looked at the arc as if waiting for something.Alices remaining automatons limped over to her and crawled into her skirts or fluttered to her shoulders.They all stood in a moment of silence before the arc, now a gateway to the world of the dead.Alice fought back tears.Feng gave his life to save ours, Alice said.I hope that will be enough for his father and his family.The plague took Dr.Clef, Gavin said.I knew it would happen, knew hed leave, but I didnt think hed try to kill us.He sighed heavily and wiped at his eyes.In his own twisted way, he was like a father to me, and now hes gone.He and Feng both.Alice embraced him and let her own tears wet his shoulder.They both wept for loss and unfairness while Glenda, Phipps, and the mechanical stood by in mute sympathy.At last Alice stepped away and fished in her pocket for a handkerchief.Gavin said in a heavy voice, His remains went into the past, you know, to a time before the dam was built.Did you see the water boil?Oh!A shock of realization went through Alice and she put her metal hand to her mouth.The Dnepro River boiled in the center of Kiev and the plague rose up like a dragon and devoured the city.Do you think Did Dr.Clef start the clockwork plague?I dont know, Gavin admitted.Clockworkers dont spread the plague, but Dr.Clef was pulverized and his blood was dragged into several places in the past.Maybe that did something to the disease.Good heavens.Good heavens, was all Alice could say.She dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief in her metal hand.An alarm blared, and red lights flashed all over the room.Click jumped straight up.Alice started as well, and her automatons jerked.Oh no, Gavin said.We need to leave, Phipps said.Now.What ?Glenda began.Gavin was turning the Impossible Cube over and over in his hands so quickly it made Alice dizzy to look at it.I think that last burst of energy from the Cube did something.Didnt you feel it?The way it dragged over your bones.I did feel it, Phipps said.Singularly unpleasant, too.The Cube was connected to the dam, and it wrenched something inside.Deep down within the stones.At the level of of the tiny things.Alice could see Gavin was floundering for words.The bits arent holding together anymore.Can you see the cracks?No, Glenda said nervously, glancing around.I can.Gavin tapped his forehead.Theyre small, but spreading fast.The structure isnt sound.Fear stabbed Alice as the implications hit her.How much time before it fails?Less than an hour, I think.Itll destroy a good part of lower Kiev.How do we stop it?Glenda asked.We cant.Not in an hour, he said.We have to evacuate everyone we can.They ran for the stairs or tried to.Gavin and Alice could manage only a fast walk.Alice winced at the pain in her shoulders and her thighs, but she grimly kept going.It got better the more she moved.Gavins jaw was also set with pain.Alice thought about having her automatons carry her, but the thought of being lifted by her arms made her shudder, and in any case, most of her automatons were as bent as she was.Somehow, they made it up the stairs and out the main doors, where they found the wrecked elephant still standing by the two mechanicals Alice and Gavin had stolen from the Gonta Zalizniaks.Near them, however, also stood the Gonta Zalizniaks themselves.Nearly forty of them.All in mechanicals.Good lord, Phipps said.A hundred weapons clacked, whined, and chattered as they trained on the little group.Chapter Sixteen  Give us sound generator, boomed one of the Cossacks.And then we kill you.Shouldnt that be or we kill you?Glenda shouted back.No.The alarms continued to blare discordant notes in a mocking parody of the paradox generators siren song.It was a day for loss.Gavin had destroyed his own invention, his pinnacle of perfection, and then watched his mentor and his friend die painful deaths.He had lost a chance to find out what had happened to his father, and nearly died himself.He looked at the Cossack mechanicals, and a terrible calm came over him.I dont have time for you, he said.The dam is failing.You need to save your people, the ones you took responsibility to rule.If you dont, I will destroy you.This is your only warning.The Gonta Zalizniaks laughed as one, and the sound echoed over the warning sirens.Then their voices merged into an eerie unity.You think we are fools.Now you die.The weapons moved.Gavin placed one hand on top of the faintly glowing Impossible Cube.It looked heavy, but felt light and springy.Gavin opened his mouth and sang.A clear D sharp reverberated in the air.The Cube glowed electric blue, and it amplified Gavins voice to a rumble, a boom, a half tone detonation.The cone of sound flattened the mechanicals like tin soldiers.Several of them fell into the river with spectacular splashes and sank from sight.The sound poured from Gavin, shattering windows and smashing doors on both sides of the river.The mechanicals twitched and shuddered.Glass bubbles cracked and broke.The Cossack clockworkers within clapped hands to bleeding ears and screamed in pain.Alice finally jerked Gavins hand from the Cube, and the note died, leaving groaning, half conscious Cossacks in its wake.The Cube darkened completely.Enough, Alice said.Theyre down.The rest of their fate is up to them.Youre more merciful than I, Phipps observed.They did experiment on children, after all.And you sided with them, Alice said.That was before I knew.Can you still drive that mechanical?Were in a bit of a rush.How are we going to evacuate everyone?Glenda said.Theres just the four of us.A booming crack thudded against Gavins ears.Gavins stomach tightened.The dam was failing faster than he had originally calculated.Once it gave, the river would smash through the lower city.Most of Kiev was built on hills, but the lower sector past the dam would be wiped out, including the square that housed the Kalakos Circus.The circus.I have an idea, Gavin said.Lieutenant, can you drive a mechanical?Phipps gave him a withering stare.All right, good.You take this one.Alice, if you and Glenda can use the other one to run ahead and tell Dodd were coming, I think we can save the people.But youll have to hurry.What do you intend to do?Glenda asked.Youll see.Just go!You drive, Alice said to Glenda.I dont think my arms are up to the task.In moments, Glenda and Alice had run off, picking their way through the tumbled army of Cossack mechanicals.Some of the Gonta Zalizniaks were groaning softly in their shattered bubbles, but Gavin spared them little pity.He had given them every chance, and he had other worries.Lets move, Lieutenant, he said, and hoisted himself into the mechanical he had stolen from Danilo Zalizniak.Lieutenant Phipps followed, and took up a position next to him.It was distinctly odd sitting near Phipps on a padded bench instead of facing her across a desk or the barrel of a gun.Inside the machine, Gavin pulled part of the control panel apart until he located a rubber coated live wire.He yanked the wire loose and jammed the business end against the darkened Cube.Instantly, it glowed electric blow.Go!he said.Walking speed.Phipps put the mechanical into a stately march upriver, toward the circus.Gavin put his hand on the Impossible Cube and sang.This time, the note was a G, blue and pure and clean.The Cube glowed, and the note flowed out like liquid silver, washing over the streets and into the factories and houses and shops.The people, who had hidden inside the moment the mechanical army had marched past, emerged and blinked beneath sooty clouds.They listened to the wondrous sound and, unable to resist, followed it.On both sides of the river, people followed it.They poured out of the city and followed.Those who could walk helped those who couldnt.And they were happy.They laughed and chattered among themselves and pointed at Gavin, pale blond and blue eyed as he sang on the marching mechanical.And then the plague zombies came.They slid out of the shadows and into the street by the river, unbothered by the dim sunlight.The people didnt seem to notice or care.In the worlds strangest parade created by the worlds strangest music, everyone moved without panic, without fear, down the river toward the circus.How long can you keep this up?Phipps asked.She seemed unaffected by the note, perhaps because of the amount of machinery in her nature.Gavin shrugged, took a quick breath, and kept on singing.He was already tired from the events down by the turbines, and now the Cube was taking more energy from him.He felt like a water glass with a hole in the bottom, but he kept singing.The crowd followed along.It wasnt the entire city, thank heavens only those who could hear the note, the ones who were in danger of the impending deluge.When they encountered a bridge, the people on the far side of the river crossed over to Gavins side.Gavin was becoming seriously tired now, and the intervals between breaths were growing shorter.He forced himself to keep up the volume, and Cube glowed like captured sky in his hands.A booming crack in the distance behind them, louder than thunder from an angry god, told Gavin the dam was beginning to fail now.Cracks were racing through its structure.Once it went, a swath of downriver Kiev would be washed away, and his clockwork was automatically calculating the path, volume, and velocity of the water.His voice wavered, tainting the purity of the note.The Cubes glow dimmed, and a wave of fear swept through the crowd.They heard the thunder and saw the plague zombies in their midst.Screams and knots of panic broke out.Sweating, Gavin forced his voice back to the G.  The Cubes blue glow steadied.The crowd calmed and continued.Phipps shot him a worried look, but she didnt dare speed up and outpace the crowd.Gavins body was starting to shake from the effort now.Every bit of concentration he had poured into holding that single, silver note.The vague memories of his father loomed up.He had to hold the note perfectly, with absolute precision, or Dad would   No.It was nothing to do with his father.He needed perfection in this time and in this place because these people needed it to live, and he would do it.He would be the voice they needed.For them.Not his father.A new strength came over him, and he sang and sang and sang.The note held steady and perfect.The crowd came quickly and happily and in an orderly fashion.And he realized the mechanical was kneeling beside the circus train.Alice and Glenda were in the engine compartment wearing ear protectors, and a wave of relief swept over Gavin when he saw a healthy cloud of smoke puffing from the stack.Dodd had said he would try to get the boilers going, and Alice had warned him not to stop.The circus people who hadnt managed to flee joined the crowd, their expressions also happy and calm.Linda wasnt among them, but Nathan and Dodd were, to Gavins relief.Click and the little automatons were perched on the engines roof, not bothered by the heat of the boilers.Gavin kept up the note, though he could feel his voice starting to fail.An explosion upriver boomed against his bones and startled the crowd, but set off no panic.Instead, they piled into the train, into passenger sections and boxcars.They climbed onto the roofs and clung to the sides.They boarded the Lady and sat on the deck.They packed themselves in with calm, ordered care because Gavins voice led them and kept them from understanding that the river carried their deaths.Finally everyone was on board.People clung to every surface, inside and out.Phipps disconnected the Cube from the mechanical and helped Gavin up into the engine compartment with Alice and Glenda.He hoped it would retain enough power.His tired mind tried to run the formulas to find out and failed.Alice gave him a concerned look and moved toward him, but Gavin shook his head violently.She gave a tight nod and turned back to the boilers.Gavin kept singing, barely.His legs and arms shook with exhaustion.The tiny room was crowded, so Phipps stood back, near the coal carrier.Alice, who had certainly never driven a train before in her life but whose talent with machines let her understand them quickly, pulled levers and spun wheels, giving instructions to Glenda with gestures.The engineer was part of the crowd in the back, enthralled by Gavins voice.A soft wind whispered over them, created by tons of unchained water pushing the air ahead of it.The train jerked forward.Wheels spun in place, caught for a moment, spun again, and caught for good.Slowly, the train moved ahead, gaining speed.The deadly flood thundered toward them, smashing stone buildings and washing away bridges.Gavins strength gave out.The note ended.He dropped the Cube and would have fallen if Phipps hadnt stepped forward and caught him.Glenda snatched up the Cube before it hit the ground, handed it to him, and went back to work.Are you all right?Phipps asked.Gavin felt like a sack of wet sand.He could only give a small nod.Phipps helped him slide to the metal floor, though he could see out through the space between the coal carrier and the engine, the Impossible Cube in his lap.Without his voice to keep things steady, fear swept the people on the train.Demonic howls and screams trailed behind them, and some of the people clinging to the sides and top fell off.The train rocked, but Alice didnt slow.Gavin didnt have the strength to feel sorrow for the ones they had lost.The river roared behind them, reaching for them with watery dragon hands.The train gained speed.Buildings rushed past them, then were devoured by the river.Despite the trains speed, the river was gaining on them, eating the tracks behind them.Its hard, Alice said, her ear protectors now around her neck.Everyones panicking and rocking the train.It slows us down.Glenda looked out the window and back.The rivers getting closer, nearly to your ship.Coal dust smudged Alices lovely face.She looked at Gavin, and he could see the reluctance.Darling, can you?He didnt have the power.He couldnt even lift his arms.But Gavin met her brown eyes.This woman had led him into hell and changed him and now she was leading him back out.She needed him.With a groan, he lifted a leaden hand and dropped it on top of the Impossible Cube, let his mouth fall open, and whispered a note.Nothing happened.The river thundered toward them.The train rocked again as people screamed and thrashed against one another, crushing and beating one another against the walls of the cars.Gavin swallowed, took a breath.He was Gavin Ennock.He could do this.Gavin breathed out and sang.The G came through, crystalline blue.The Impossible Cube flickered, then glowed and the sound pulsed back over the train.The people instantly calmed.The train stopped rocking and picked up speed.Alice and Glenda, who had put their ear protectors back on, worked at the engines, while Phipps hovered over Gavin.He sang and sang while the train puffed faster and faster.The water receded behind them, and then the train took a curve that brought it uphill.It lost speed, but it went away from the water.Gavins hand was sliding away from the Cube, and Phipps reached down to press it back into place.The Cube was losing its glow, running out of the electricity it had taken from the mechanical.Half a mile flashed by, and they were at the top of the hill.Alice slowed the engine and let the train coast.It was drifting to a stop near a station.We did it, Alice said, but her words came from far away.Darling, you did it!The Cube went black.Gavin tumbled into darkness.He was lying on a cloud, a soft, fluffy cloud.It was so restful and fine.Delightful not having to move.He had only a tiny moment to enjoy the sensation.Abruptly, he jerked fully awake as he always did, his heart beating at the back of his throat.The room was spacious and white.Thick rugs covered polished wood floors.A large wardrobe of pale birch took up one corner, and an icon of the Virgin Mary hung in one ceiling corner, draped with white bunting embroidered with a red design.A table and easy chairs occupied another corner.The generous bed was also white, with fine linen sheets, a feather filled duvet, and plump pillows.Where was he, and how had he come here?He sat up and groaned as fire tore through every muscle.Aching and sore, he forced his feet around to the edge of the bed and realized he was naked.And clean.Hissing with every movement, he found a chamber pot under the bed, used it, and replaced it.The fiery ache continued when he stood up.A soft white dressing gown hung from the door, and he gingerly tied it on, which made him feel a little more secure.To his immense relief, he found his fiddle case next to the door.Carefully, he picked it up and opened it on the bed.The fiddle inside gleamed at him, undamaged.He sighed heavily.A quick knock made him turn.The knock repeated.Uh hello?he called.Who is it?The door burst open and Alice rushed in with a tray of food.Click trotted in behind her.Youre awake!Thank God!She set the tray on the table and caught Gavin in a hug that made him howl.She instantly released him.Im so sorry!I should have realized when I stopped moving, everything started to hurt worse, too, and youve been asleep for a long time.He hobbled to an easy chair next to the table and, gritting his teeth, eased himself into it.Alice hovered over him, offering help, but he waved her away.Click jumped onto the bed and settled into a pillow, his phosphorescent eyes gleaming green.How long was I asleep?Gavin asked.You were unconscious, not asleep.Alice took up the chair opposite his.She wore a white blouse, a pale blue skirt, and a straw hat with peacock feathers on it.All of it made her look free and bright, and Gavin was so glad to see her.Its been three full days.I was so worried.I thought the smell of food might bring you out.The mention of the food brought his head around to it.There was tea and some kind of dumpling in a cream sauce and peppered roast pork and dark bread and cucumbers with onions.Gavin was ravenous, and, ignoring the pain, pulled the tray toward him so he could eat.The dumplings were stuffed with soft cheese, and the tender pork was seasoned perfectly.Alice took a paper packet from her pocket and handed him two pills from it.Take these, she said.Theyll help with the pain.He swallowed them and kept eating.Where are we?The mayors house.So much has happened, I dont know where to begin.The last thing I remember is singing on the train.She nodded.Part of the dam held, so the river destroyed less than we feared a section a quarter of a mile wide and about five miles long.We got nearly everyone within that zone to safety.We lost some people, but almost everyone survived.Except the Gonta Zalizniaks.Theyre all missing, presumed dead.Their house was at the bottom of the valley, you know, and its completely underwater now.The river is returning to its original bed.Some of the city will be flooded permanently, but most of it can be reclaimed.Were being hailed as heroes.We are?Gavin paused with a fork halfway to his mouth.We destroyed the dam and killed a bunch of people.Thats not the way the Ukrainians see it, Alice said.The dam fed power to their hated Cossack rulers, you see.We, on the other hand, rescued their children, led the Cossacks down to the horrible dam, blew it up, and swept them away forever.The mayor his name is Serhiy Hrushevsky has taken over the city.Hes a very nice man who used to be a professor at the Kiev Ecclesiastical Seminary but became mayor because he wanted to soften what the Cossacks were doing.His son Mykhailo is extremely intelligent as well and will probably succeed him in politics, and  Oh!Im babbling.Im just so relieved that youre all right, darling.Im happy to see you, too, he said.But what next?Well, once the whole story came out, Mayor Hrushevsky brought us here to rest and recover as honored guests.I cured the rest of the plague zombies in the city, which only made everyone even happier, and they want to have a city wide ball in our honor.The medicine Alice had given him started to work, and Gavins muscles relaxed.Ive never been a hero before.I dont know how to react.I dont either, to be honest.Im letting Phipps handle most of it.Phipps!Id forgotten all about her.Shes still with us?Oh yes.Alice folded her arms.She insists upon coming to China with us.Glenda has already slipped off, back for London.We havent heard from Simon, either.And we wont.Gavin drained his teacup, then paused.I have to say I was hoping  Alice grew more serious.For what?That we might be able to search the laboratory in the Gonta Zalizniak house.To see if they had found you know.I do know.She reached across the table and took his flesh hand in her metal one.Well find a cure.You have time yet, no matter what Dr.Clef thought.We will cure you, we will get married her voice began to choke and we will have lots of children who will get very, very tired of hearing the same stories of their parents adventures over and over again.Aw, Dad, not that boring story about Feng at the dam again, Gavin said, trying to lighten the mood by imitating a child, except his own voice grew thick.Weve heard it a million times.Will they speak with an American accent, do you think?Or a proper English one?Hey!Theres nothing wrong with a good Boston accent, Gavin said, laughing now.Click raised his head.Dont forget that we perfected baked beans so you beefeaters could put them on toast.Alice was laughing too, and she dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief.Good heavens.I havent even told you the best part.Theres more?The paraffin refineries are nowhere near the dam and werent touched.Mayor Hrushevsky is insisting we take all the oil we need.The Lady has been restored by his own men, and she is ready to fly when we are.Gavin spent three more days recovering.He tired easily and slept a great deal, though he insisted on spending as much time as possible on the Lady, which was tethered just above the mayors modest house.It was easier to rest amid the familiar, homey creak of wood and hemp.It also seemed to Gavin that the Lady was pleased to see him.The ship appeared to float more freely, hold herself more steadily when Gavin was aboard, though he didnt say anything about this to Alice.When Gavin checked the Ladys workshop, he was gratified to find the metal project hed been working on had been moved there from the train, and he spent some time fiddling with it.It was nice to work on something that wasnt a weapon.The Impossible Cube was locked away in a cupboard.Alice, Gavin, and Phipps didnt see any need to tell anyone else the particulars of how they had led everyone out of danger.The paradox generator, of course, had been destroyed along with the dam, though Gavin still felt a small twinge at its loss.Dr.Clefs notes about the danger of time, space, and energy were also gone, burned by Phipps.Gavin didnt have the heart to tell her that he had read them and, with a clockworkers precision, memorized every numeral and symbol.He didnt intend to use the information, of course.After everything that had happened, it would be foolish in the extreme.Much more interesting to work on his little project.Now that Gavin was out of danger, Alice set about playing the part of the baroness to the hilt, making speeches and attending parties.Phipps attended most of these events as well, moving easily among the people, pointedly making friends and contacts.Once Gavin had recovered sufficiently to travel and appear in public Mayor Hrushevsky declared an entire day of celebration for their send off to China.He presented Gavin with a new outfit white airmans leathers.Gavin found he couldnt speak.The ball was both plain and lavish, all at once.Mayor Hrushevsky, a great shaggy man with a long dark beard, insisted that the party be held outdoors in the streets, so it was more like an all day festival than a ball.The pall of Gonta Zalizniak rule had lifted, and the people appeared brighter, more cheerful.Even the weather cooperated, granting them a bright, balmy day.Gavin heard Ukrainian music for the first time, and he was enchanted.Street bands and musicians played at nearly every street corner.The mayor opened up the city coffers, and free food was available from stalls every few feet.The electric lights had gone out with the dam, of course, but after sunset people put out lanterns of glass and of colored paper, tinting the city with a hundred lively hues.Alice and Gavin and Phipps wandered about the city, greeted with cheers and laughter wherever they went.They danced to the music, and Gavin held Alice tightly as they whirled through the evening streets.Who knew that a cabin boy from Boston would travel so far?he said to her.I love you always.And I love you always, she replied.When it was time to go, Gavin, Alice, and Phipps returned to the square in front of the mayors house and listened to a speech they didnt understand in the slightest.They smiled and waved to the cheering crowd, Gavin in his new whites, Phipps in her formal reds, and Alice in a Ukrainian style blouse and skirt, heavily embroidered with tiny cogs and wheels, made just for her by a dozen grateful Kievite women.Click and the automatons, repaired and shined for the occasion, made an honor guard as the trio ascended the ladder to the hovering Lady.The envelopes curly endoskeleton glowed blue with power from the generator and its generous supply of paraffin oil.The cheers and applause buoyed them up to the starry sky, lifting Gavins spirit with every step.When they arrived on the deck, Gavin took the helm and Alice increased power to the generator.The glow intensified, and the ship ascended, higher and higher, until the city became flecks of color on black velvet.A cool breeze washed over him, mixing the scent of purity with the smell of paraffin exhaust.Click took up his usual spot, peering over the side of one gunwale, and the little automatons perched on the ropes or skittered about near Alice.Phipps folded her arms and watched.It was a thrill to be back in his rightful place, back in the air where he belonged.And yet  Once they established a heading east and the nacelle propellers were pushing them along, Gavin asked Phipps to take the helm for a moment.She arched a questioning eyebrow.I need to show Alice something below, he said.He led Alice down to the laboratory.She looked apprehensive.Its not anything bad, he reassured her.Youre not going to propose again, are you?she said.I dont really need   Its not that, either.Im just This is important to me, and I want you to be the first to see.Now she looked mystified.All right.The little laboratory had been tidied up in preparation for the trip.Most of the floor space was taken up by a large, bulky object covered in a white cloth.Kemps head, the eyes still dark, sat on the worktable.Gavin hoped to figure out a way to restore him, but that wasnt why he had brought Alice down.His heart was beating fast, and his palms were sweaty, though he couldnt say why.Ive finished it, he said lamely.Its all done.It took her a moment to understand.Then she got it.The project you started in the circus?Thats wonderful!Im honored you want to show me, darling.Lets see it.Gavin took a breath and whipped the cloth away.Alice gasped.The framework he had created spread out something like a kite.A battery pack with buckles and straps took up the center.The thousands of alloy rings he wound into a cloak now hung over the framework in waterfall ripples.When extended, they would stretch more than ten feet both left and right.Gavin!Alice breathed.Are those wings?
