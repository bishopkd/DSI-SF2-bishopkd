"Yeah, why" he  wondered?Do you want to talk to him?""Yeah, I want to ask him about this girl  Irene Stevenson or something like that,  cause I think he might know her. "She stated calmly."Well I can't let you see him but I can  ask him for you," he declared, looking at  his watch again it was seven thirty now."Oh  crap I need to check, on a patient" and he  turned and left her standing in the hallway.Arthur entered Lucent's room.He was eating a pork chop and the doctor winced,  he was Vegan and didn't like seeing other peopl e eating meat or wearing leather like the  leather on Bruce's imported braincase.That was leaning against the bed."Hi Nancy!exclaimed Bruce who had fini shed his meal by now.The had gotten  to know each other by now, the car crash was almost a month ago.He sat up and grind at  Nance who didn't like being called Nancy.Because it was a girls name, and he was a  very muscular athletic guy with a lot of se xy mussels but he didn't want to upset the  software developer because he mite get mad at him.Lucent sat up and put the remains of his  lamb chop aside."I was just wondering  where you were because I wanna talk to  you.I think I'm better enough to go home now  don't you. "He pointed to his neck wish no longer had to have the foam brace on it  anymore, he was glad because it itched like when he was a kid and broke his leg and had  a cast.That had itched, and so did the neck brace so he was glad he didn't have to ware it  anymore.I don't think that would be a good idea,"  expostulated Nance angrily."You still  need a lot of therapy for your leg and you can't drive again yet. ""Then can you tell me doctor, what a      bout some people?"questioned Bruce  Lucent.Doctor Nance started pacing around the r  oom, back and forth, back and forth."Peoples lives are covered by the privacy act, Mr.Lucent. "opined the doctor to his  patient."I can't tell you about anyone at the hospital, if that is what you mean. ""Well it was, more about the accident that almost killed me. "Bruce Lucent sat up  straight, a dangerous look on his face.Na nce knew Bruce was used to getting his own  way for the past few years sine he got ric  h.   So he sometimes got more violent than  sometimes another person might when the same thing was going on.Nance stopped pacing up and down and sat down in the chair  next to Bruce's bed.After all what could  the software geek do?His leg was still in  traction, or at least had been until yesterda y, and he could probabl y not move very fast  yet either.He had good muscles though, almost as good as Nance's that he worked out  for hours to get and still had despite being olde r than Bruce.He ran his hand through his  sandy brown hair and blurted, That's the police's job.I know they came here more than  one time to talk to you about the accident.They don't tell us doctors about that stuff, and  we don't need to know. "Bruce thought about the young cop who        had questioned him.He had been  asking questions, not telling him anything.If he knew more about the accident, he hadn't  told Bruce.But he bet this doctor new more than he was telling.He could tell by  looking at his face.It was a face that kept secrets, hundreds of secrets every day he bets."You know I can make a big donation to this hospital if you can get me the  information I want. "Bruce spurted out."You know me well enough by knowing to  know that I am the sort of person who want    s to ask questions, not answer them.So  maybe I can make you think.Here are some na mes and not from your hospital, either.I  need to know who wanted Henry Archer dead.What does Irene Stevens know about his?No I was wrong, there is one person from the hospital, a nurse named Margaret. "He must think I'm like a candy striper   who sits and tells everything she knows  thought Nance to himself.Maybe I do know  something I won't tell about Henry Archer.A candy striper named Nancy he must think.And does he mean Margaret Eastman for the nurse in this hospital.And how soon will  that big donation come once he's not in the hospital anymore?He'll forget it fast enough,  and my hypocritical oath will be down the toilet.Bruce watched Arthur Nance's trim, m oustache face and thought that Nancy boy  wouldn't tell him anything.He was it close down and saw the secrets hiding there.Too  bad he had spent all his time working out or studying computers.He didn't spend enough  time with people so he didn't know body langua ge and Arthur Nance probably spoke it  like a native.So he could sit there with  his shoulders all hunched up and his face closed  over his secrets.And its so oblivious that he knows what I mean and could tell me what I  want to know."Alright, then since you don't want to   tell me what you know even if you do  know, how about just make me more comfor table here since you won't let me go home  either.You could start with that pretty nur se.She was standing outside my door talking  to one of my friends that came to visit me.She looks like her uniform is painted on with medium length brown hair.That's the nurse  I want not the one who looks like she had  prunes for breakfast and is older than my gra ndma. "Bruce sat up straight in his hospital  bed and ran his hand through his  long black hair thinking that he needed a haircut really  bad."Im sorry sir but the hospital does not assign its personal  like that. "spat Arthur Nance."If Nurse  Eastman is who you mean she isn't one of the  floor nurses on this floor so I can't assign her here anyways."Then move me to her floor.I would ge  t much better faster with her being the  one to give me shots in the butt," Bruce  Lucent expostulated."She works in maternity. "That should  show him for trying to through his weight  around thought Arthur Nance to himself.And  the way he's acting I won't tell him what I  know even if I was going to which I was but now I won't."So maybe I could get pregnant?"queried Bruce Lucent hysterical."When nurse Wagner tells you to do your therapy that will get you out faster than  joking with me" quipped Arthur Nance.S     uddenly he thought to himself that Bruce  Lucent asked him about Irene Stephens a  nd so had Margaret Eastwood.And Bruce  Lucent also asked him about a nurse who's na me was Margaret.So what did Margaret  Eastman now?This just made it even surer that he would not tell Bruce Lucent anything.He could not have this sort of thing going on in his hospital!Arthur Nance ran his hand through his sa ndy brown hair and stood up."Im sure  you'll be able to go home in a few days if   you do what you're supposed to do that the  nurses tell you. ""So what was it you came in here to tell me  anyway doctor" queried Bruce to the  doctor?OH nothing I was just checking to see how your leg was out of it's cast and if you  still needed the neck brace.You better used that neck brace when you use your computer  you have there. "Arthur Nance pointed to the  laptop compeer case next to the bed, in it's  leather case that got all scuffed up in the  car wreck."If you hurt your spine worse you'll  never be able to program again. "Bruce Lucent was tired of doctor Nancy telling him what he could do and couldn't  do.Why did he come here to stick his nose in  if not to talk or answer questions?Did he  hope Bruce would tell him something?Not likely.This hospital was a hotbed of all sorts  of things going on.He hadn't been here for  nearly two months without figuring that out!But now he knew that Doctor Arthur Nan ce was an enemy, not a friend, and he would  look out from now on.A nurse, not prune face Wagner, but Cute   with short curly blonde hair, and a  really nice ass brought in Bruce's lunch right then.So Doctor Nance stood up, so straight  and muscles even if he was old, fast out of his chair, and left the room like walking out of  a TV courtroom.Bruce smiled at the nurse."Hey cutely I haven't seen you before.Are  you desert!?The nurse smiled back and even giggled a little, which Bruce hated girls who  giggled, but she was cute anyway.While     she was putting the tray over his bed and  unloading the pork chops and mashed potatoes and lima beans and milk and jell O and  chocolate cake, he even pattered her butt and she just  giggled again.He hated lima beans but he  didn't say anything.If he rang the bell and made somebody take them away maybe it  would be her, and then he wouldn't have food all over and could maybe get to know here  a little better.Too bad he had this huge cast on his leg.It made it kind of hard to  anything he wanted but sure didn't stop him    from waiting it!Almost as much as he  wanted to know what was going on and who        had tried and seceded in killing Henry  Archer.Andrew Venice parked himself in the        booth right behind the four of them,  wondering how much of this place he could  be expense account, figured almost nothing,  and when the waiter in tight black pants a nd a black turtleneck came by, he only ordered  an orange juice.Hell, even if hed been  off duty, he figured there was no way hed be  able to afford booze in this joint, with   its wood paneling and di m lighting and fancy a  wine list, to say nothing of a clientele that ran in higher circles than I.   But he was  working, and knew he needed every ounce of hi s detection skills to listen through all the  background noise in the nightclub.It was just nice to be in out of the Atlanta heat,  overbearing even at this time of the evening.All four had already met by the time hed   managed to slip in, but he had to go  about it easy and careful to make sure that none of them made him.Lucky that the booth  he was in had opened up, and that the people leaving had unwittingly given him cover.Hed even had a chance to risk a peek ove  r the edge as hed sat down, noted who was  sitting where.On the opposite side, furthest away from   Andrew, sat Isaac Stevens, father of  Irene Stevens.He had a salt and pepper b  eard and hair that was cropped close to his  head, about 50 years old.Next to him was Arthur Nance, that doctor, about the same age  as Stevens.He was well built, quite trim  and muscular and athletic, with sandy brown  hair and a thin mustache.Beside Nance sat Rory Edwards, also very well built.Andrew  remembered that Edwards was 60, but there was no way in hell he looked to be over  Andrews own age of 40, aside from maybe hi s fashionable glasses that leant and air of  respectability and intelligence to what at first appeared to be a middle aged jock.Finally,  closest to Andrew, sat Richard Isaacs, a    66 year old who did well, Andrew knew,  manipulating stocks.Andrew knew this b ecause the ruddy faced but well built man was  also a police informant, which kept him in  the game while eliminating many of his worst  opponents.Edwards cleared his throat shortly afte r the waiter brought over their drinks and  said, A toast.The other three men mumble d in agreement.To my old friend, Henry  Archer.May he rest in peace?All four l eaned into the center of the table and clinked  their wine glasses together, then drank to his memory.Wish Id known him as well as you, said Stevens.Being good friends with a millionaire industrialist is always a good career move,  Isaac, said Nance.He took another swig of his wine and then smiled to show that he  was just joking.The other three men la ughed, although it took Stevens a beat longer to  find the humor than the others.Isaacs shook his head then, looking a little   lost in thought.Its a sonofabitch,  dying in a car crash like that.Guys only 60, got a young beautiful wife in Callie, in  better goddamn shape than any of us here           The guy was once a champion body builder, Ri chard, said Stevens.Not like a  Mr.World or anything like that, but he ha  d those muscles and he knew how to carry  them.Of course he was in better shape th an any of us here.Hell, I do well enough with  racquetball at the Racquet Club and polo at  the Polo Club, but I could never hope to be  cut like he was.Shit, even my daughter, Irene, told me she admired his body.The  others laughed at this, and Nance hooted.Stevens reached over and jokingly slapped him  across the top of the head.Rubbing his head in mock pain, Nance l  eaned back after setting his glass back  down on the table.I was working that day at the hospital when they brought him in, you  know.Isaacs drained his glass and signaled for a nother, then leaned forward, interested.Do tell, he said.Nance shrugged.Bruce Lucent was there, recovering from his own car accident.Word got up to me somehow.Im not sure if someone told because he was so famous  and so rich, or if maybe someone knew that  he and I knew each other.He paused and  finished his wine, then also waved at the waiter.Not that it was needed, since they were well known in the club, and the waiter was alr eady sashaying over with a tray carrying  four more of the same.By the time I got    down to the ER, the cops were there, and  Callie too, and they werent letting me in to   see him, even though I am a doctor.He  frowned at the memory of this, felt a sm   all piece of rage break through his normally  implacable surface as he thought about the       insult of such treatment, but then he  remembered where he was, and the fact that they were there to honor the memory of their  friend, and he choked it back down, followed its bitter taste with the tannins and fruits of  his favorite dry red, an expensive Richebourg 1987, kept in stock exclusively for him.Ive heard rumors that a cop is stalking  this case, growled Edwards.Isaacs, the  police informer, sprayed some of his dri nk, choking, as did Venice, still listening from  the other side.He wiped up the orange juice with the sleeve of his jacket, but the men on  the other side had not heard them, they were  laughing so hard at the mess that Isaacs had  made.Where ...Isaacs tried to catch his breath.Where did you hear that?Edwards arched an eyebrow, the l     ong, untrimmed and wild hairs below his  forehead counterpointing the motion.Lets just say that word gets around.He cracked  his knuckles, slowly and extravagantly.Sounds to me like hes been calling into  question the very life that Henry lived.Dont know what Id do if he came to me casting  aspersions on my old, dead friend.Luckily, over in the other booth, Venice ha d set down his orange juice, because  otherwise he would have ended up spitting mo re across the table, or else choked on it.And considering how expensive a lousy  we  ll, not lousy, really, since it was freshly  squeezed just for him  orange juice was in  the place, the thought of wasting any more almost brought tears to his eyes.But still,  hearing a potential threat against him caused a  reaction that normally would have been humor , but based on how in shape all of these  guys was, had him worried.They could wo rk him over pretty good, with or without a  racquet or polo mallet.Of course, he had the law on his side, but these guys moved in  circles with all the big time judges.Any case would be a toss up.I hear that Henry was into something nasty, said Nance.Venices ears perked up like tiny Distant Early Warning line radar stations at the  sound of this.Edwards grunted.You hear lots of stuff, Im sure, he said.That doesnt mean  any of it is true.He shrugged his massi ve shoulders.Besides, anybody with as much  moola as he had, he didnt need to stick hi  s hands into the muck.Hed just pay some  lackey or toady to do his work for him.Or maybe some shell companies, to keep the tracers off of him and let him make  a few extra tax free simoleons, answered Stevens.So then maybe this cop is onto somethi ng, replied Nance.Except that maybe  hes investigating someone else, somebody who knew about any extracurricular stuff  Archer was into.He raised his eyebrows,  a motion that created a quilt of thick wrinkles  on his otherwise normally smooth forehead.Then he leaned forward and whispered,  quiet enough so that Venice could only make out a few words.Maybe ...murder ...other ...him.Whatever had been said, it drained what little atmosphere remained at the table,  left it cold and thin like the  roof of Mount Everest, and the four men, fit as they were,  were no mountain climbers, and so they all dr  ained their drinks, paid the tab, and left.After a suitable interval, Venice got up and  followed them, making sure he downed the  rest of his fancy schmancy orange juice first.Bruce gimped around the seedy waiting room of Nicholas Stick Maksutov.Sticks secretary sat at her gunmetal steel gray desk, pecking out a letter on an ancient  Underwood typewriter.Her cowfish udders almost burst out of her tight polka dot dress,  the pale yellow color almost perfectly ma    tching her clearly dyed hair, teased in a  pageboy flip so retro for a moment Bruce thought it looked hip.Whens Stick gonna, be back?Bruce implored seemingly.How many times do I haft tell ya, the blonde, whose name was Sally but who  went by Bubbles, responded irritatingly.He ll be back when hes gonna be back.Ya  dont rush Stick, ya know.She typed anothe r letter, looked over at a form, then typed  another letter, looked again, typed another letter, then looked again, typed another letter.Holy Laded!Bruce wanted to scream,   wanted to pick up the black rotary dial  phone on her desk and throw it through the fros ted glass window of  the office door.He  wanted to slap Sally whose nickname was Bubbles and then maybe ravage those udders  and do the Madonna on those big red lips, ex cept he kept thinking of Callie, poor, poor  Callie, still pining over the death of her beloved Henry, whose memory not even Bruces  hot sex could cause to fade, although he was working on that.How had it come to this?Bruce asked hi mself.How had he, the teenage hacker  who got into the Homeland Security system and fed them fake Al Qaeda communications  for over a month that resulted in a Code Orange alert that shut down international airports  for two weeks, how had he, hotshot software     developer Bruce Lucent, come to this?Using a private investigator to find out the truth about his birth?Well, kid, the wizened old dick had explained two weeks ago when Bruce came  to him, the dick had explained, Ya see, in  some backwater Southern counties, they just  havent gotten around to computerizing vital stats.So here he was, pacing and pacing a nd driving Bubbles crazy, he hoped, waiting  for Stick to come back with the truth.Why, Stick had called him that morning    from a  payphone, of all things    and said he had a little job to do that morning but if Bruce  would come by at noon, hed have a report fo  r him.And oh, if Bruce could bring an  envelope with some Benjamin in it, 40 of them, please, that would be swell, too.The truth!How hard could it be to fi  nd out the truth?Bruce wondered.The  truth about his real birth had nagged him ever  since as a science project in tenth grade he  had done the genetic sequencing on his and  his parents DNA, and discovered much to  his surprise that there was a 20 billion to one chance they were related.The uncertainty nagged him ever since, and now, with an annua l salary about what Bill Gates made in a  week, he had the money to find the truth, the real truth.His reverie was broken by the creak of   the door opening behind him.Bubbles  looked up.The goldfish in the aquarium l ooked up.The Rottweiler snoozing before the  gunmetal steel desk looked up.An old ma  n asleep on the couch in the waiting room  rolled over and went back to sleep.Bru ce turned around and looked, saw, pondered, and  was amazed by the awesome hulk coming in the door behind him.Hey, Babs, Stick accused fetchingly.Hows tricks?Tricks had to go home early, Bubbles   displayed resoundingly.Something  about getting her hair done.Tricks is bald, Stick surmised.Well, she did say something about an 11 a. m.  shadow, Bubbles explained.Bruce stood by listening to this inspiring  exchange.The goldfish ate his lunch.The Rottweiler rolled over and parted.Finally, he couldnt stand it anymore.Stick!he burst out, exploring.Goddamn  it, Stick, did you find my real birth  certificate?Got it a week ago?Didnt you get my call?You called me yesterday, Bruce interpolated.I did?Stick inquired to himself.Must slipped my mind to call you earlier?Ya got the Bennies?Bruce reached into the breast pocket of his alligator hide leather jacket, but before  he could pull his hand all the way out, the old man on the couch leapt to his feet and put a  Desert Eagle .44 magnum to Bruces head.Hey, sweetheart, let me take that for ya, the old man exclaimed, j's on the off  chance ya got a rod and not some dough.The old man slipped his hand down Bruces  pants, poked around a bit, then reached into Bruces jacket and took the wad of money.Hes clean, Stick, and hes got a schlong like Detroit, the old man declared.And this wad a dough aint too shabby, either.Thanks, geezer, Stick pointed out to the  geezer, who wasnt all that old, really,  just a tall, swarthy man in his early 60s w ith a snowflake scar on his hip from a commie  round he took in the Nam, which changed the old mans life, whose name was Johnson  but everyone called Joe, ruining his plans to be a male stripper and forcing him into a life  as muscle for low rent private eyes.Stick counted the money.Yeah, ya got a  ll the Presidents here, he reasserted  soothingly.So how about the report?Bruce inquired.Oh yeah?Didnt I tell ya on the phone?Stick inquired back at him.Dude,  youre adopted.Which you probably should have figured out since your parents are both  white and, well, youre black.* * *         And they told me they were light skinned!Bruce screamed at his loving,  adoring wife Callie, twice his age but she  didnt look it what with all the good breeding,  healthy living, and plastic surgery.Plus, Callie had inherited a wad from her dear  beloved and quite dead husband Henry Arch er, biggest damn manufactured home make  in the South.In Bruces estimation, a rich  middle aged woman was a lot better looking  than any young poor woman anyway.Honey, Im sure your parents had your best interest at heart, Callie supplied  soothingly.She fanned her heaving ivory skinned breasts with the report Stick had given  Bruce.Adopted!Why couldnt they have told me  the truth about my past?It was bad  enough that I was horribly maimed in that auto accident when the truck driver ran the red  light, slamming into our Cadillac, and pinning   my foot under the seat so that the only  way I could escape the burning wreck was to   saw off my big toe with a Swiss Army  knife?Do you know the humiliation I faced in boys gym?Sweetheart, at least you, Callie sniffed,  her thick tears dripping off her luscious  eyelashes and down the cavernous cleavage of  her breasts, at least you had parents.At  least you werent raised like an evil stepch  ild by your long lost uncles and aunts after  your parents died in a terrorist attack in Crete.But my parents were white!Honkies!The oppressor to the brother!Bruce  roared menacingly.Well, they sure look black with the bi g Afros and the Kent cloth suits, Callie  interjected.Its hair dye and a really good perm!Bruce waved the report from Stick, with  the DNA analysis, the anthropologic analysis, a nd the birth certificate that said parents:  white; child, black.Who knew?Callie analyzed.They fool ed me.And you have to admit, your  momma sure makes some mean chitlins.Ca llie tossed her thick, deep black locks over  her shoulder, the curls falling to her hips and bouncing imploringly off her bookshelf ass.She leaned in closer to Bruce, stood on he  r tiptoes and ran her fingers across his well   muscled chest.So youre adopted?Its not like its the end of the world.But now I know the truth, Bruce beseech ed.Now I know my true heritage, I,  Bruce Lucent, know who I really am.Who are you?Callie articulated questi oningly.If those honkies arent your  parents, then who?Why  ...why Stick never told me.Let me see that report, Bruce snarled,  grabbingly.He grabbed the report from Callie , and as he took away the crude fan which  kept her cool in the sweltering Atlanta heat,  Callie broke out into a sweat as deep as the  Amazon River and just as muddy.Bruce ripped through the pages, until he cam  e to a crude photocopy of his real, actual  birth certificate, the one with his real mo thers name, his father being unknown, although  he was rumored to have been a prominent se gregationist senator, his own mother a black  maid like his mother before her.My mother  ...my mother is     he rumored hesitatingly.Callie snatched the report back.Wanda June Jezzica, she articulated.Why,  shes the owner of the Jezzicas for Ladies,  the hair products company with a net worth  of $55 million dollars, because they make such wonderful womans beauty products, like  Jezzicas Glorious Tresses, the dye, I mean, conditioner I use to make my own incredibly  gorgeous long locks so silky and thick.Shes my mother?Bruce implored wonderingly.So it would seem.Callie slunk over to her stud of a husband and ripped off his  alligator jacket, his tight black jeans, a  nd his silk underpants, the ones with the little  hearts on them she gave him for Valentines Day she was pleased to see he wore.Lets celebrate, she husked seductively.Why yes, Bruce suggested.Perhaps dinner, champagne, dancing, maybe a  show.Oh, not that, silly, Callie stimulated er  otically as she locked her legs around  him and planted sloppy, lipstick drenched kisse s upon his chest.I was thinking maybe,  you know, visiting Detroit, she winked.Like the canals in the city that had gi  ven him his name, Andrew Venice had a  tendency run to the shallow and he could not  rein in that tendency in his thoughts as he  sat down on the hard plastic seat booth to interview with Yvonne Perrin.The curvaceous  redhead was stacked like the cards in   a crooked poker game and exceptionally well  preserved.He felt a twinge of regret and so  mething else as he considered their tawdry  surroundings.They were sitting in a humbl e Hardee's hamburger shop near her place of  work."Thank you for meaning with me, Ms.Perri n," he began to say.He could have  bitten his tongue as he realized the double entendre, inadvertent but double, nonetheless."Please, call me Yvonne," she responded brightly.Yvonne.The name was a derivative of "I van," itself another version of "John," a  word with sexual connotations that made themselves known to Andrew.He was a cop,  after all, and had a cop mind.Emotions boiled through him, but he controlled them, even  as he and his fellow officers of the law strove to control the scum who raged in the streets  of Atlanta, the city that he loved so and had sworn to protect."I am sorry it has to be during my    lunch break, though," Perrin said and she  opened the plastic pod that held the item   she had chosen from the signboard menu, a  humble hamburger."I have a very busy day today!""No, that's okay," Andrew said.Th     en he blurted."We could have gone  someplace nicer!"He was an exceptionally well set up man, after all."No, this is fine," Yvonne said."I do  like hamburgers. "She opened the greasy  bag that had been given her by the equally greasy young Hardee's attendant.Her hair  was the same rich red as the ketchup she dabbed on her freedom fries.Andrew had opted for the roast beef sandwich himself, and even though it was, as  advertised, sliced thin and piled high, already it was as ashes in his mouth.Hamburger  sandwiches had never been his favorites, but  to see the smooth sesame seed studded bun  that now luxuriated between Yvonne Perrin's neatly manicured fingertips was to know  envy for the succulent sandwich they held.How he wished that these delicate digits  could hold him!But enough of that."I need to talk to you about the Archer case," he said with grim resignation as he  bit into the sandwich and felt the rubbery m  eat product part before the blades of his  incisor teeth, one of which was chipped and needed bonding."Henry?"Yvonne asked.She paused mid bite."I thought that was a an accident.Poor Callie!""We're just exploring the possibilities," Andrew said.His mind raced at the  suggestiveness of how own words!How coul d he say such a thing to a woman he had  only just met?And yet, Yvonne Perrin's  flashing green eyes and a cantilevered bosom  seemed to offer possibilities that Andrew would dearly have loved to explore."How is his widow holding up?"Yvonne       asked.She batted her eyes at him."Such an attractive woman!I do home that she isn't too devastated!""Well, it's hard not be devastated wh  en your husband dies in a mysterious car  accident, even if he is 20 years older than  you and could have reasonably been expected  to predecease, even given modern actuarial trends," said Andrew sympathetically."Henry took such good care of himself," Yvonne said."Even the physically fit suffer when they end up with an engine block in their  laps," Andrew said.He watched her eat.He liked watching   her eat.He liked the way her delicate  fingers lifted the sandwich, and her bright, wh ite, sharp teeth shredded it.From living  flesh to meat, to shredded meat, to meat patt y, to shredded meat again    it was as if the  humble beef were experiencing the entire cosmic cycle, only to become living flesh once  more, thanks to the biological processes of the lovely Yvonne Perrin."I don't like to think about that," Yvonne said."Why exactly is it that you wanted  to speak with me, Detective Venice?"Andrew could think of a thousand things  he would like to say to her, but limited  himself to asking, "Did Archer have any enemies?""Of course he did," Yvonne said."He was a millionaire.The bloated parasites of  the ruling class always engender hatred among the workers, after all. ""I mean    specific enemies," Andrew asked.Yvonne thought for a long moment."Y  ou mean people who would want him  dead?"she asked pensively."Dead or terribly injured," Andrew re     plied, enjoying another bite of tasty  Hardees roast beef."People survive car accidents, after all. ""Well, I certainly never wished him ill," Yvonne responded.Her eyes lit up, as if  illume from within by the fires of desire."No, ill is the last thing I would have wanted  him to be. '"What kind of man was he?"Andrew asked.He wanted to light a cigarette, as he  always did after a meal or sex, but the repr  essive restaurant regulations imposed by an  increasingly authoritarian government forbade hi m even that simple pleasure as his heart  broke under the weight of Yvonne's obvious  high regard for the dead man who was not  there with them."Very virile," Perrin said breathily."An outdoors man, fond of racecar driving  and barbecue cooking. ""Barbecue?"Andrew prompted.For some reason, the reference rang a siren in  his memory."Well, grilling, really," Perrin continue d."They    the Archers    would host  cookouts at that big house of theirs.He would insist on doing all the cookery himself. "Andrew shook his head and snorted in sile nt surprise.A millionaire industrialist  who dabbled as a backyard chef    it could onl y happen in Atlanta, the city where tulips  grew on trees!"He specialized in hamburgers," Perrin continued."Thick, juicy hamburgers.He  would start from scratch, often raising the steer himself, then slaughtering and butchering  it, and grinding even the best cuts.Then he   would take those huge, virile hands of his  and shape the meat into thick patties, thicke  r and juicier than even the thickest and  juiciest steaks.Then he would grill them hi mself, like a master surgeon.He really was  amazing," she said.A tear trickled from one  of her electric green eyes."I will miss him  so very much. ""What about his wife?""Callie?"Perrin asked.Her voice held a   faint note of disdain."Oh, she's very  nice, but she can't cook. ""That's not what I meant," Andrew aske d."Would she have any reason to want  him dead?And does she have any knowledge  of automobile mechanics?Such as how  brakes work?""Callie?Oh, don't be silly.She hasn't   worked on a car in years," Perrin said,  giggling at the very thought of her slightly  older and slightly less well preserved but still  a comely friend with a wrench in her hand."Not since that Chrysler she kept running  with spit and bailing wire back in the 80s. ""That not what I meant, either.Well, not  really.How did she get along with her  husband?"Andrew probed.Fully half hi       s sandwich lay on the tray before him,  unconsumed, like the leftover fruitcake at Christmas, but he was not hungry anymore, for food or for Yvonne Perrin.Silently, he curs  ed himself for falling prey to her sinister  charms.He was sure now that she had said  something of import, but he could not recall  it and know that it would be terribly rude and  suspicions making to ask the lovely and a  vivacious person seated before him to repeat herself."Callie loved Henry," Yvonne said."Just the other day, she told me that she  loved him as much as she had the day that they got married, in Las Vegas.I want to cry  when I think of what I said to her after that .I said how could she tell, when they were  both so drunk the day they got married in Las  Vegas. "She leaned close."That's where  they met, you know.In Las Vegas.Drunk.At a casino!"Andrew shook his head and snorted in sile nt surprise.A millionaire industrialist  with a gambling habit who met his future wi  fe in a Las Vegas casino after having too  much to drink!It could only happen to so  meone who lived in Atlanta, the city where  tulips grew on trees!"Do you know what status of Henry Archer's will?"Andrew asked."His will?Why would he need a will?He was married, you know that!"Yvonne  said.She looked at the remains of his meal   and her tongue was a bright red finger the  color of flame, either because of the ketc hup she had consumed or because of her own  robust good health, as she liked her lips."I'm still hungry," she said.Her own food was  long gone."Do you want anything more?""No," Andrew rejoined.He shook his head."No, I don't think so.In fact, I have  to leave shortly for another interview. ""Oh?"Yvonne asked."Is this an open investigation?I thought it was just an  accident. ""That's probably all it was," Andrew agreed, "but we have to look into these  things. "He grinned crookedly."Being a detective isn't like they make it out to be on  TV, Yvonne.We don't all live in New York or  Los Angeles, and we spend a lot of time  looking into things that other people take for granted, like car accidents involving  millionaire industrialists!"He took his hand in  hers, trilling to the feel of the blood that  pulsed though her deallocated veins."But I enjoyed this," he said."So did I," Yvonne said, replying to him.As Isadore Trent dreamed sleepily, her re d hair spread like a cloud a tent around  her pillow, her face exploded with joy."Oh,  I wish I was back there. "She thought.She  missed it so badly.Maybe she'd get to go b ack someday.She thought about the hot dry  heat, about the grit of sand.Oh, how it felt to be penetrated by those huge mosquitoes ...Oh, yes.She was a masochist of the first degree.She shivered in her sleep, thinking about  it.Goose pimples formed beginning at the tips of her toes, pushing out farther the day old  stubble on her legs, and continuing up her st omach until her nipples were pointing out.Then they reached her neck, and her trembles tangled her hair into a mess.She'd have to  brush it good when she woke up, but she'd enjoy the tangles, no doubt.A sound intruded on her consciousness  a little bell sound.Unknowingly, she  worked it into her dream so that an ice cream truck was making its way to her across the desert.And then when it got to her it wasn't even ice cream at all but instead was some  kind of liquor bar.She didn't know why.So   she thought she'd order something frozen,  but the girl there just looked at her cattily and told her they only sold coffee drinks.Damn  arrogant woman.But then the sound changed, and it wasn't a little bell any more.Now it sounded  like it might be scratching, or maybe banging.Or maybe it wasn't that at all, but someone  knocking.She pushed herself out of sleep and  tried to think.But she didn't wake up fast  enough.Hmm.What could she do to make he rself wake up, she wondered?Maybe she  ought to pinch herself.So her dream self r eached out and did just that.OW!That hurt!Now she really was awake.Since she was, she sat up in bed and pus    hed the covers off, noticing that her  nipples were still erect.The sound repeated itself, and it WAS a knock!Wow.How could  she have thought it was anything else?She got  out of bed sleepily and tiredly raised her  hands above her head, stretching, while sh   e decided what to do.Maybe she should  answer it.Okay.That's a good idea.So she went to the door.She wasn't   dressed, so she thought she might ought to  grab a gun on the way down.It wouldn't do for it to be a bad guy at the door when she  didn't have time to get any clothes on.So sh e reached under her bed and fished out the  gun safe she kept there.She put in her s  ecret code: 6969.No one would ever think of  that.Once she heard the tumblers click over,  she pulled the gun out and got out of bed.She didn't keep the bullets with the gun, just  to be safe in case her adorable little brown   haired niece with the cutest smile ever visited,  so then she went into her closet to get the bullets.There!She thought after she did.No w she wouldn't be afraid to go to the door  naked.She slowly made her way down the stairs, one slow step at a time.Once she got to  the bottom, she listened and realized that she didn't hear the sound any more.Hmm.Well, she decided to peek out the spyhol  e anyway.Nothing there.Hmm.She went  around and looked out the window on the side  , but she didn't see anyone from there,  either.Well, she hmmphed.No telling what it was.She still had her trusty revolver, though, so  she stuck it in her bathrobe and made  for the kitchen.She'd get a midnight snack  to tide her over until morning.Maybe some  kippers and cream cheese.Those were one of her favorites.As she made her way to the kitchen, she passed some of her favorite pictures on  the wall.She sighed, looking at them  both   sadly and happily.She sure loved those  people a lot.Some of them weren't even around any more.Some of them were.Well, maybe she'd see them tomorrow.When she got to the kitchen, she saw that the light was on.Oh, no!She was sure  she hadn't left it that way.She steadied the automatic in her grip and readied her finger on  the hair trigger.What she saw surprised   her.Someone, his back  and she noticed, fine  backside  to her, was in her refrigerator!What were they eating?Thinking about that  chocolate cake she had left over from that  wedding last week, she aimed and pulled the  trigger.She wasn't any dainty lady in wa iting waiting around to be picked on!She was  one tough broad!The person startled at the shot and then grabbed their leg and fell down, moaning  like it was the end of the world."Owwwww," the guy said."Owwwwww. "She wasn't sorry, though.She was getting ready to shoot  him again when she paused.She couldn't  help but notice that  in his turmoil and fear  for his life  the man had gotten an erection  underneath his thin white polo shorts.It l ooked familiar.She studied his build some  more, noted his red hair by the light of the re frigerator door that was still open as he held  his leftover cake in his hands.Oh, no!It wa s that babe from the gym!Shit, she bonked  him a couple times already.You think she'd remember that ass.She preened.He probably  just couldn't stay away and wanted seconds.She purred happily.She still had it, no doubt  about it.What was that guy's name?Suffering Succotash?She struggled to remember, to  make her mind vomit forth the information she knew it had digested at some point.She  couldn't really be forgiven for forgetting,  since she'd just banged the guy in the shower  room.He seemed to be staring at one of   the guys showering the whole time they were  going at it, but she was sure he just wanted to see the guy's reaction at him getting to fuck  such a hot babe.Oh.Steven.That was it.Steven Sufferi ng.No, Steven Suffern.Yeah, that was it.That's right.He was still moaning.She went over to him and prodded him w ith her toe."Hey!What were you doing  taking my leftover cake!Girls are protectiv e of their chocolate, you know!You should  know better than that!"He smiled sadly at her."I couldn't help it," he said, as he choked out his words.
