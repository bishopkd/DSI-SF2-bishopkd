Walker.She smiled thinly and gathered her legs beneath her to rise, the dismissiveness of the gesture a subtle counterpoint.Sevi is in charge of the science, of course, but Ill stay in close contact...I am not at all sure thats a good idea.She was arrested in midmotion, comically startled.I beg your pardon?Sit down, Ms.Klist.Were not done yet.She sank back onto the chair, casting a quick glance toward the suite where the others could be seen but not heard, having what looked like a sober but perfectly amicable discussion.No one was paying attention to them, and the face she turned to Eli was hard.He gave her no opportunity to speak.I know that you and Aryel have had candid conversations, and I suggest you and I continue in that vein.BelNatur might indeed be a changed institution these days, with staff members who had either no or very limited responsibility for the abuses it committed.I cant deny that Sevi and Khan have a fresh new look about them.But you are not peripheral, Ms.Klist, and Callan knows that as well as Aryel or Herran.Or me.She licked her lips.He found the involuntary gesture immensely satisfying.Does Callan think I was responsible for...he must know how distressed I was...Your distress then was as much a public relations stunt as the one youre hoping to pull off this time, with me.Callan is no more an idiot than I am.He knows the part you played in what happened to him.What happened to the others, after.I never meant I can believe you never meant for it to go as far as it did, considering how close it came to destroying you.If the outcome had been different I seriously doubt we would be seeing any of this remorse from you now.She stood, then, swiveling sharply to face the window, her fingers gripping the sill.He rose more slowly, turning to look out as well, as though they were enjoying the view.Callan is here, he went on evenly, because Herran needs him to be.Herran is here because he has made a rational decision to earn as much help as he can for those who need it, in the only way that is available to him.I am here to make sure that the assurances youve given are genuine and the promises youve made are kept.I am not certain any of that can withstand your ongoing, personal hypocrisy.Her face had gone white as marble, lips compressed into a thin line.Two red spots shone on her cheeks, and her eyes were black and dead as coal.Her hands, he noticed, were trembling and she clasped them together tightly.They stood side by side, as she had stood next to Callan earlier, and gazed out of the window.He felt strangely peaceful.He could hear her take one shuddering breath after another as they watched birds swoop past.Khan will act as liaison, she said finally.She managed to keep her voice level, but there was a raggedness to it he had never heard before.He nodded thoughtfully at the faint outline of their reflections against the glass.I think that would be best.There was no reply except for the sound of her heels, clicking rapidly away.Binary        Revolving She learns to remake herself.It is a necessity of her condition.It is, by its nature, conspicuous; not immediately, often not for a considerable while, but over time, inevitably, those around her begin to notice, to question, to wonder.To whisper behind hands and cast eyes askance.She discovers that no landscape can long endure her presence.She resists the signs, always, not wanting to leave behind what she has built, exhausted by the thought of having to start again.Again.She develops a weary fortitude, and strategies for coping.She teaches herself the skills she needs to create a shred of continuity in this unanchored existence, a framework that will allow her to maintain some sense of identity as she steps out of one life and into the next.She notices herself shift, subtly, with every incarnation, into someone who is a little bit more like the person she must now be; and she forgoes resentment in favor of sanity.She learns that she can lengthen the intervals between her own reinvention, reinsertion, by minimizing those with whom she must share space and time.Relationships become shorter, more perfunctory, easily discarded and eventually dispensed with altogether.This is not loneliness.This is survival.This is what she tells herself.But she finds complete seclusion beyond even her powers.It does not take long for her to feel herself again locked away, a precious princess imprisoned in a tower, looking at the swirl of life outside the windows.She descends, engages, forms connections, attracts attention.Time passes.The whispers start.She leaves before they begin to suspect.Binary       18 Callan left Herran at home, settled comfortably back in front of his own screens with Aryel for company.He trudged up three flights of stairs, ignoring the elevator in favor of the mindlessness of movement, thumbed open the door of his own apartment, and walked straight into Rhyss arms.It was like falling out of a rain of knives and biting cold into warmth and gentleness and comfort.He held him close and did not speak until he could trust himself not to weep.As they stood there wrapped together in silence he detected the faintest tremor in Rhyss limbs, and in the fingers buried in his hair.It occurred to Callan that the younger man might well have reasons of his own for distress.He relaxed his grip, pressing his cheek and then his lips against the side of Rhyss face, and felt himself blinking back the traces of his own upset as he pulled away enough to look at him.Sweetness.He forced a smile.So how was your day?Not any more fun than yours.Rhyss face was wan, his answering smile just as tentative.Lots of poking and prodding.Really?I could do that.Better.That got him a chuckle, and a bit of sparkle back into the indigo eyes.You definitely could.Rhys shook his head.Never mind.Tell me.Was it horrible?Yes.Well, not entirely.It was weird.Callan had turned his own micro balcony into an oversized, opulent window seat and he flopped onto it, tugging Rhys down with him, noticing with unease how carefully the other man lowered and arranged himself, his sigh of relief as he settled into the cushions.You could tell theyd been briefed to be nice to us, but they were really nice.Bending over backward.The people, the place, they werent anything like I remember.Youd been there before?Once, when I was about fourteen, I guess.They were shopping me around for my first indenture and they brought me in to demonstrate to a client.Some Asian conglomerate.In through the service entrance, up in the freight elevator, speak only when spoken to.The rest of the time they talked about me like I wasnt in the room.Im pretty sure where I was taken to then was on the same floor as today.Oh, Callan.No, its fine.I mean its not, but, you know.He frowned.It was completely changed, and I dont just mean the space.The difference...it wasnt only the fancy car and going in through the front door and being spoken to like a real person.I was all set for that to be window dressing.But remember I told you about Sevi?How she seemed all right?Well, she was pretty typical.So why did your message sound so pissed off?And you looked wrecked when you came in.Because this entire symphony of reconciliation was being conducted by Zavcka Klist.In person.He rubbed a weary hand across his face.What those men did to me...I dont think about it most of the time.Ive learned to put it away, I had to.But its there, Rhys, and she was behind it.Im sure of that, even if she didnt issue the instructions herself or target me in particular.To be expected to stroll along, politely chatting about how times have changed...as though it had nothing much to do with either of us...Rhys was aghast.She spoke to you?She had the nerve?Youd think we were old friends, the way she spoke to me.You should have seen her, Rhys, touring us around, showing off her shiny revamped company like some sort of badge.Its like she thinks if she surrounds herself with sincere people her own insincerity wont matter.What did you do?Held it together, just.Eli finally sent her packing.He did?In her own place?Rhys grinned in appreciation, though it still looked like an effort.I like him.Yeah, Elis good people.He told her if she wanted us to be able to stomach working there shed have to shove off, and she did.Which was another piece of weirdness, come to think of it, but a good one.He patted Rhyss knee, now propped comfortably against his own.Your turn.What happened?Oh, you know.More tests.What sort of tests?Nerves.Reflexes.Its not important.Yes it is, sweetie.Youre moving like youre hurt.Are you in pain?A little...Rhyss eyes slid away from Callans face.I shouldnt load any more of this on you.Not with everything else you have to deal with.Rhys, dont.Dont you dare.He leaned forward, cupped a hand against Rhyss cheek.Dealing with you is the best thing in my life at the moment.The best thing for a long time.I want to know whats going on.Rhys looked back at him, blinked hard and swallowed, and gazed away again across the sunset streaked city.His fingers crept up to press Callans hand to his face.Ive been really well since I got here and they needed to see what an attack does to my muscles and the control centers in my brain, so they gave me some stuff today to try and trigger some of the symptoms.It worked.Its wearing off now but everything sort of aches.Its hard to describe.He shifted against the cushions.Its like every muscle has been strained, not a lot, just a little.Just enough.I feel bruised.He looked back at Callan, managed a smile, kissed the cradling palm and pulled the hand away from his face with a pretense at briskness.Itll probably be completely gone in a couple of hours, and at least it didnt mess my head up as well.Ive been working on Sharons problem and Im finally getting somewhere.Want to hear my theory?I want to know why you look so scared.Rhys stared down at Callans hand, still clasped in his lap.Callan tickled his palm lightly, urging him, feeling a tremor of fear hum along his own nerves.Theyre worried that whatever I have looks like its degenerative.Rhys spoke to the tangle of fingers.They...theyre not completely sure yet.But the pattern of the attacks and the test results theyre getting...and what they did today to switch it on, it all sort of confirms...Callan felt the tremor turn into a shiver, a hard humming like a frozen spear through his guts.They think its going to get worse?How much worse?We dont know for certain.They might come up with a treatment.I might find better ways to control it.It might stabilize on its own.His voice was shaking now.Callan tried to keep the terror he heard there from echoing in his own.And if they dont and you dont and it doesnt?Rhys looked up at him then, finally.His eyes pooled and spilled over.Then they think itll kill me.Aryel Morningstar perched on a stool in Herrans small, tidy kitchen and watched him eat.They sat across from each other over a worktop that doubled as a dining surface.Herran mostly used his fingers, moving them with metronomic regularity from dish to mouth, pausing every now and then to clean them fastidiously with a biowipe before returning to chase down every morsel of the meal she had prepared.From time to time Aryel stabbed a fork at the contents of her own plate, without enthusiasm.Herrans pale eyes flicked up at her, observing.He rocked a little.Not hungry?Not very much today, no.Is it good?Good.Well, thats Bals teaching for you.Want some more?Herran pushed the empty plate ceremoniously toward her and gave his fingers another wipe.More.It pleased her greatly that he had learned to enjoy food, instead of treating it as no more than a tedious refueling that took him away from his tablet and screens.They had formed an instinctive, unspoken roster back in the beginning of the Squats, making sure he had a tasty meal and company to eat it with every day if they could; prying him gently offstream and into the more visceral interactions of meat and bread and touch and speech.She had watched him change over those lunches and suppers, bit by infinitesimal bit, could almost map each new word or glimmer of expression that he gained against a taste or texture that gave him pause, and fired a new, old pattern into the altered web of his brain.Some deeply buried instinct for humanity had stirred with every bite.Now he watched her spoon seconds onto the plate and again spoke without prompting.Problem?Im worried about Rhys.And a little bit about Gwen, but mostly Rhys.She put the plate back in front of him.And you, of course.Im worried it will be too hard for you.The fingers plunged in.Not hard.Only time.It might take a long time, Herran.You might be there a while.She had to wait while he chewed and swallowed and blinked at her.Not long, he said with certainty, as he picked up the wipe again.Setup okay.I do testing, Callan does talking, Eli asks questions.All together.Quick quick.If you say so.What did you think of Zavcka?Scared.Thats not good.Thats not good at all.Will she be a problem for you?No.Maybe.No.Herran...No problem.And youre sure it will be okay with Sevi?Sure.New chairs.No straps.He was rock nodding again, with the subtle emphasis that she knew signaled satisfaction; although she could not be certain whether his contentment had to do with the BelNatur arrangements or the meal.Dinner was in the early stages of preparation a few floors away, in a larger and less orderly apartment.Like Aryels, this apartment had also been altered to accommodate a gem with a need for more than the average amount of headroom.In Mikals case it had meant raising the ceiling by close on three feet, salvaging extra tall doors from derelict public buildings and constructing extra large furniture.On her first visit Sharon had felt like a doll propped onto a grown up chair and had laughed about it with him.On her second she was disoriented to find, when he sat down, that his face was almost on a level with hers and his legs, stretched out under the table, emerged on the other side.She had poked her head down to look, observed that his chair legs had been cut away almost to nothing, got to her feet and shoved him unceremoniously off the seat.Hed sat on the floor and watched as she manhandled the mangled chair into a corner, replaced it with a properly giant sized one, and with a flourish invited him to reseat himself.I think, hed said from the floor, that I might be in love with you.Good.I love you too.Dont ever do that again.Theyd married in less than a year.The amputated chair stood against the wall: a reliable source of amusement and the anticipated throne for children who would one day use it to haul themselves upright, balancing on unsteady legs before clambering up and plopping their diapered backsides down, cackling in baby glee.It had become a tiny ache in their hearts, that chair, an empty seat waiting to be filled.Now Sharon sat with her back to it and half listened to Mikals droll account of the days doings in Council, the earnest proposals for cost saving schemes that would save at best half what they cost to set up, the hands off pomposity of career civil servants, and personal shenanigans of politicians.You want to watch how you make fun of them, dear.It could be you next.Im not worried.My laundry is aired, and carries a badge.What a wonderful image.Thank you.I try.He opened the freezer cabinet, regarded its contents for a moment, then shut it again.Youre just doing that to get cool.Guilty as charged.Salad?Sure.She was scowling at her tablet.You know, the more of this we manage to unravel the less the whole thing makes sense.The genestock?Mm.I thought you were making headway, now that Rhys is on board.We are.Hes a genius.Achebe doesnt know whether to be jealous or worship at his feet.So it makes no sense in the sense that...?Well, we already knew that the hacker and the targets didnt fit the usual pattern.Generally, supposing you didnt know where to find what you wanted, youd use hackbots to do a broad spectrum search, and then follow up with a targeted intrusion.But this was a single hacker trawling a dozen different gemtechs right from the start.And what they were targetingwell, youd expect it to be new models, really innovative genetypes, that sort of thing.She glanced up at her husband, conscious that she was speaking unsentimentally about matters both exceedingly painful and too recent to yet be history.He blinked back at her, the thoughtful half smile that told her this was all right, and returned his attention to the tomatoes he was chopping.Id have thought so, yes.But you said they were old?We inferred they werent current because Achebe could tell that the datastreams they were in had already been archived before they were copied over to the EGA.But Rhys has deciphered the filetags, and it turns out most of them were really old.Not just a few years, more like two or three generations.I mean, that would be considered obsolete, right?So then I started to wonder if this was some weird historical voyeurism, maybe theyre looking for dead ends, famous disasters.But none of them were like that.The main area of interest seems to have been a bunch of fairly innocuous genetypestransitionals, Rhys calls themthat were engineered between twenty and forty years ago.Mikal set the knife aside and frowned.That is strange, not to be going after a marketable end product.Mind you, that was when the big shift happenedthirty, forty years ago.Less low IQ brute force laborers, more...He picked up a lettuce and gestured vaguely at himself with it, while the double thumbs of the other hand popped open a jar balanced on his palm.Charming, intelligent, and erudite?I was going to say highly modified, but okay.She blew him a kiss.Okay, so the main focus of this hacker happens to be a really interesting time for gemtech.I hadnt thought about that, but youre right.It produces the first fully functional gillungs, and you, and Aryel, Bal, and Aster...Yeah.Anatomic innovation for prosperity and security.She stared up at him in dismay.Thats not one of mine, he hurried to assure her.Recombin marketing slogan.We came up with several very rude versions.Anyway.Anyway...She steepled her fingers and rested her chin on her hands, distantly aware that it was a Masoud gesture and annoyed by the fact.But its not as if innovation stops.I mean, Gempro goes on to perfect the gillungs, BelNatur makes a big push into neurological and sensory abilities, we get people like Gaela and Callan and Herran BelNatur were comprehensive.and the gemtechs keep on pushing the boat out; right up until the government put a stop to it they wereWhat?What?Say that again.BelNatur?Hmm?Oh, I know their publicity was all focused on beautiful, brilliant redheads who norms would be happy to have aroundyour Gaelas and your Callans, and all the sexual subtextbut the truth is, they were at the forefront of all kinds of enhancements.They even had a hand in the gillungs.Reginald told me they discovered when they were working out the settlement that BelNatur had sold Gempro a lot of the early technology.They didnt want to be bothered with developing it, they had so much else going on.Sharon picked up a neatly sliced carrot, tapped it against her teeth and then bit into it thoughtfully.Thats really interesting.Because none of the hacks were aimed at BelNatur, and none of the stolen genestock was theirs.Maybe whoever was doing it already knew all about them.You mean it originated there?Maybe.But then why would they be looking at what their competitors had done way back when?Wouldnt you be trying to spy on the latest research from Gempro, Recombin, Modicomm?She waved the remains of the carrot.Thats another weird thing.Although the gemtechs were different, Rhys says the genetypes appear to have things in common.Hes going to focus on that, see if he can nail down a pattern.But I think thats another reason why this cant be about black market gemtech.Youd go for variety, surely.The bottom line is, the stock thats been stolen corresponds to the oldest genetypes that were hacked, and had been in storage for at leastat leasta quarter of a century.Stuff that old might not even be viable, it definitely wouldnt have any street value.So why would anyone want it?I mean, if youve found a way to infiltrate this incredibly secure storage facility and steal whatever you like, why steal that?Mikal prodded thoughtfully at the salad.And you still dont know how they pulled off the theft?Not how, no.But Rhys has an idea about who it might have been.Mikal looked up sharply.What?Who?Why arent you out arresting them?He doesnt know their identity, although hes going to take a look at the profiles we ran and see if he can spot anything we missed.No, get this.He thinks the whistleblower might also be the thief.Mikal was dumbstruck.He stared openmouthed for a moment, then clasped his hands on top of his head and executed a slow turn, as if the pressure might keep his cranium intact and the rotation reorient the world into its proper orbit.When he came back to face her, Sharon was grinning at him.Now you know how I feel.Im beginning to think that compared with police work, politics is actually sensible.He thinks this why?He says look, what do we know about the whistleblower?Nothing, except they must have known about both the hacks and the thefts, plus have the ability to mirror the EGA datastream to create a trail for us to follow.What do we know about the thief?Also nothing, except they too must have known about the hacks, plus have the technical expertise to subvert the EGAs entire security systemwhich is fully integrated with its datastream.Same knowledge base, same skill set.Same person.I. ..right...okay.She watched him digest this.Do you buy it?I think its crazy, but it fits the facts.But why?You pull off the perfect heist, get away without a trace, and then you tell the cops?Like I said, the more we find out the less sense it makes.Maybe he was feeling unappreciated.Wanted to show off.In that case he should go work for the city.No, scratch that.Weve got enough worries without a criminal mastermind with self esteem problems on the payroll.She laughed.Anyway.Whether hes right or wrong on that score, young Rhys is turning out to be worth his weight.I should message Aryel a thank you.She got up to set the table, and a shadow passed over her face.Have you heard how today went, by the way?I had a message from Eli to say reasonably well.No hostility, no backing off.I think, she said, her voice suddenly distant, that sounds like very good news.I think maybe we need to talk about what happens if it keeps on going well.Its a good start but theyve barely started.Whats wrong?She gave him a weary, eye rolling, what do you think look, put the glasses and cutlery down on the table with a tinkling thump, and disappeared in the direction of the bathroom.Mikal heard a soft, heartfelt curse, followed by the vacuum hiss of the toilet flushing.He finished arranging the table with care, trying to push back a familiar sense of disappointment.Sharon reappeared several minutes later, leaning against the doorframe.Her gaze slipped over the ridiculously truncated chair against the wall before she looked back at him, shaking her head.Binary       19 Three days in, Eli found himself wondering if he had been too harsh with Zavcka Klist.He had not seen her since their conversation outside the neural transcription lab, and his slightly juvenile sense of satisfaction had not much waned.But the sea change she had claimed for BelNatur was becoming undeniable, and everyone he spoke to credited her for it.Wary of any dissimulation that might be spreading ahead of him he had quickly busied himself beyond the bounds of the infotech program, finding his way into the airless offices of building services and striking up conversations with engineers and administrators in the cafeteria.He had yet to discern any overt anti gem feeling, or much pride in the companys past.Veterans tended to mutter disavowals pitched somewhere between moderate embarrassment and outright shame; newer staff members spoke earnestly of transformation.A purge had taken place; the most staunchly regressive following Felix Carrington out the door, and the remainder reformed.He struggled to reconcile the magnitude of the change with the unabashed bigotryif not the ruthlessnessof the old Zavcka.But any guilt he might have felt for the way he had handled her was allayed by the presence of Callan, whose normally unruffled demeanor was tempered by an undercurrent of disquiet unlike any Eli had seen in him before.He could not be certain that it was entirely down to the memories their being here must have triggered, but he didnt imagine it would help.Herran by contrast seemed fine.By the second day he was accepting the greetings of the technicians who worked with Sevi, before climbing with equanimity into the testing chair to occupy himself with his tablet while they went through the specifics of the session with Eli and Callan.He would peek up through his lashes as the sensor net was placed carefully over his head, issuing gnomic comments that at first only Callan understood, but that on translation suggested he had been paying attention to the conversation as well as to whatever he was amusing himself with on the streams.Sevi and one or two of the others were quick to pick up on his patterns and quirks of communication, to understand and interact without Callan needing to mediate.So far the whole thing was proving much more collegiate than Eli had anticipated.Returning from one of his forays into the nether regions of BelNatur, he stuck his head in at the door of the lab.Herran was reclining with a tablet stand angled a comfortable distance from his eyes, watching the lines of code that flashed up on it.The lacy skullcap, through which fiery curls poked in every direction, read and routed his synaptic activity to banks of screens before which the neurologists shook their heads in bemusement.Callan sat nearby, monitoring, every now and then getting Herran to say aloud the meaning of what he saw.The scientists scanned that brain activity too, and compared it with the unspoken interpretation and looked even more baffled.Eli caught Callans eye, raised a quizzical eyebrow, and mouthed Okay?Sevi looked across anxiously.Callan nodded, gave him a thumbs up, and Eli retreated to the seats by the window.Now that he was fairly certain there was no active campaign of deceit at the staff level, it was time to become a bit more methodical.He pulled up directories on his tablet and started to work through them, checking policies and programs, working documents and personal communications.He set up a searchbot to look for gaps where offending files might have recently been deleted, and another to check edit logs for hasty revisions.The sheer size of the system was overwhelming.He got lost in side shoots of African agricultural communes and a tangle of Middle Eastern tax shelters, found his way back through a network of Asian subsidiaries as exotic and mysterious as any Silk Road trail.Hours passed.He noted with wry appreciation that almost everything prior to the Temple Act affirming gem and norm equality had been archived.So.A line had been drawn under that event, and the records that would have reinforced a mindset now deemed defunct were hidden from casual view.He wondered if anything else had been hidden there as well.Unsurprisingly, his access did not extend to probing archived files.He called Khan.The assistants visual came up on his tablet at once.He listened politely.I understand, Dr.Walker, but you cant expect that old stuff to be representative anymore.I dont.Ive seen a lot of it before, remember, when I interrogated the gemtech typology criteria for the Federation.He sighed inwardly, hating how pompous he must sound even as he played the expertise card.Its the transition that I want to examine.That was feeble, and he waited for Khan to call him on it.There was a long pause.And youll want to confirm whats on the other side of the firewall, said Khan meditatively.Of course.Sorry, that was a bit slow of me.I. ..Eli was momentarily nonplussed.Then he recovered himself and plunged on.Look, everyones been at pains to tell me theres no double dealing or hidden agendas here, and so far Ive found nothing to contradict that, but if Im to confirm it then I need to see everything.Im not trying to drop you in the middle, Mr.Khan.Ill explain it to Ms.Klist if you prefer.No, dont do that.Khan looked alarmed.Theres no need toumdisturb her.Shes authorized me to see to it you have everything you need.Ill have your tablets access level upgraded immediately.And, Dr.Walker?Yes?My names Arthur.He cleared his throat and glanced away from the screen, as if slightly embarrassed.IahI know Ms.Klist is very formal, and if thats what you prefer, then It isnt.Thank you, Arthur.He did not return the invitation, and sensed that the young man would be sharp enough to notice.The access clearance came through within a couple of minutes, and Eli plunged into the archive.If the systems hed been trying to parse before felt like they contained a planet worth of information, this was a galaxy.He reminded himself that he was only looking for anomalies, files added too recently or carrying the wrong date stamp, and set up more searchbots.But the archive was so vast that he found it impossible to capture what he needed to know with a few simple commands, and ended up delving again down wormholes, replicating his earlier efforts as he struggled to grasp the shape and size of the thing.BelNatur was an old company, one of the first gemtechs to emerge out of the black days of the Syndrome, and it had absorbed many others in close to a century of existence.It occurred to him, as he got ready to launch yet another searchbot, that the sub archives of alien and mostly ancient records were a particularly unlikely place for anything of interest to be located.He hesitated, weary of the task.The chance of finding anything was remote.But then, so was the likelihood of there being anything to find anywhere at all.He had seen enough already to be fairly certain that if a grand deception was being orchestrated, it was offstream and tightly contained.The point was to be thorough, to satisfy himselfand be able to assure Aryelthat he had left no stone unturned; to be able to live with the increasing likelihood that he, Eli Walker, once the gemtechs harshest critic, would be the one to certify their redemption.Bile rose in his throat at the thought.He swallowed it down, grimacing, and swiped the searchbot live.He left the bots running, knowing they could take hours to turn anything up, and checked on Herran and Callan again.The chair had been fully reclined and the little gem was lying flat out on it, sensor net still in place, eyes closed, small hands clutching his own tablet to his chest.Callan looked up as Eli came in and paused at the sight of Herran.Nap?he whispered.No, Herran and Callan answered together.Theyre doing a scan of his brain at rest, Callan continued.Although it isnt.Thinking with no looking, said Herran.Through the customary flatness of his tone, Eli thought he detected a note of annoyance.Try not to do any thinking, Herran.Sevi was standing before one of the monitor screens, shaking her head at the patterns that morphed across it.Youre supposed to be having a break.Would it help you relax if we took the net off?No.Relax with tablet.Really?She looked from him to Callan and Eli.Weve done a lot today, I thought he could do with some rest...Okay, Herran.Chill out onstream if you prefer.Herran promptly sat up, cross legged on the gurney like surface, and activated his tablet.Eli strolled over.Want to turn this back into a chair?Okay.Eli waited a beat to see if he would do it himself, then reached for the controls.You doing okay today?Not tired?Okay.Not tired.Not night.You could get tired in the daytime too, Herran.He looked up at that and blinked, considering.No.He adjusted himself against the chair as the back came up and the leg rest folded down.Not sick.Not sleepy.Hungry?Not yet.Not suppertime.He had lunch, Callan interjected.He did look a bit weary, Eli thought.We went up to the cafeteria today.Someone said you had just left.It wasnt bad, eh, Herran?Not bad.He was absorbed in the tablet.Eli stood by him for a few seconds longer, trying to work out what he was streaming.It looked like Festival news and socialstream commentary, but interspersed with code in the weird mashup that only Herran could decipher.He shook his head and went over to Callan.How about you?he said quietly.You dont seem quite so chipper.Im fine.The answer came out on reflex, then he caught Elis look and sighed.Im a little tired, thats all.Didnt sleep so well.Eli tilted his head to indicate they move out of earshot.Sevi turned politely back to her screens as they stepped clear of the lab.Whats going on?Is this bringing too much back for you?No.I mean, the first day wasnt great but since then...They had reached the damper field by the window.He stared out of it.Its like that old story, you know, about falling through a mirror and everything on the other side is sort of the same but not really?Takes a bit of getting used to.But I cant fault Sevi or her people.Theyre trying really hard.I know you used to have nightmares...If this is bringing them back...No, its nothing like that.He hesitated, took a deep breath.You know whats happening with Rhys, right?This condition he has?Eli began to understand.Aryel told me about it.Theyre trying to identify the illness?Work out how serious it is?Yes.And the news isnt good so far.It looks like just about as bad as it could be.You mean?The look Callan gave him was confirmation enough.Oh, Callan, Im so sorry.That must be so hard on you.Both of you.And on Aryel, he thought.And Gwen and Reginald.Callan looked steadily out of the window for a long time.Eli got the feeling that whatever he was seeing was elsewhere.Ive only just met him, you know?His voice was hardly louder than a whisper.Onstream doesnt count.Ive only known him, in person, in...in the flesh, for a couple of weeks.So maybe it doesnt make sense for me to be this torn up about it.But I. ..he...it feels like Ive only just found him.He twisted his hands together unconsciously.He makes me feel connected.Youre in love with him.Callan nodded.Completely.He glanced sideways at Eli.Am I crazy?Dont ask me, my friend.I once managed to marry a woman Id known for so long I thought I must be in love with her.Turns out I wasnt.He shook himself clear of the memory and rested what he hoped was a comforting hand on the other mans shoulder.No, I dont think youre crazy, and I think Rhys is lucky to have you.Do they know what it is hes got?Not really.It looks like some of the old neuromuscular diseases, things that shouldnt show up in anyone anymore, gem or norm.But its not exactly the same as any of them.He rubbed a distracted hand through his hair.Theyre running profiles on his genome, but its so highly engineered theyre struggling to match it to anything they recognize.If they had his genetype, the genealogy and all the modification markers, that would help.A lot.But they dont.He raised his shoulders, let them drop, and Eli took his hand away.Do you want to get out of here?Go and be with him?No.I mean I cant yet.Hell still be at the hospital.They kept him in last night so they could pump him full of drugs and see what happened.Hes spending the day getting scanned too.He glanced back to where Herran was busy swiping and tapping at his tablet.He gets home in a couple of hours.Well lets get ourselves home before then if we can.And if juggling that and this gets to be too much, dont try to do it.Well work something out.Thanks, but I want to be part of this.Not just for Herrans sake.He smiled wearily.Rhys knows what were doing here.How important it could be.We both want it to work.The bots were still trawling when he got back to the survey, after a word with Sevi and another, almost cheery assurance from Herran.He spent some time organizing interview notes before he checked them again.A string of alerts flashed up, and he scrolled quickly through.Mostly on the current system, nothing recent or too serious.Some derogatory language, quickly slapped down; a couple of questionable proposals similarly rejected.A few more from the archive, innocuous and easily explained: canceled projects, defunct departments.The last item on the list had been thrown up by the mergers and acquisitions bot and he realized with irritation that there must have been a mistake in the setup.It pulsed invitingly, though the icon was the dull gray of an inactive link.He tapped at it.Nothing happened.Back into the archive, copy over the linkcode, wait an unfeasibly long time for it to come up...File not found.He blinked at the banner, and went back to the searchbot panel.The file icon was still there.He tapped it again, waited, again went back to the archive.This time he typed the link in manually.File not found.So whatever the searchbot thought it was flagging up wasnt actually in the archive, though the dead link still pulsed on the panel.Had to be an error of some sort, a system generated glitch, a ghost in the machine.Such things used to happen, pre Syndrome.Get rid of it, run another searchbot in the morning.Eli yawned and swiped in a deletion command, and frowned.It wasnt responding to that either.Nor would the tablet now respond to any other commands.He stared at it in frustration, dreading having to call Khan, already thinking guiltily of asking Herran for help instead.His finger tapped a steady tattoo as he considered the options.The icon bloomed under his finger, and he jerked back in surprise.A cascade of links shot into life, one after another, file text flashing across the screen and disappearing faster than he could read.A few words and phrases popped out of the maelstrom and stuck in his consciousness, even as the links that contained them were lost in the whirlwind.Extreme modification tolerance.Weapons potential.Batch cull.Klist.The torrent stopped, finally, on a link that flashed blue before expanding into a message, in a format that felt oddly archaic.1503114AS TO: Zara Klist FR: Jonah Wycliffe RE: Phoenix ProjectCONFIDENTIAL Appreciate your surprise at learning of this.Assure you it was news to me as well.Circumstances unique to say the least!How it has been kept embargoed this long remains a mystery, though no doubt Dr.Panborn can shed some light.She does not quite seem to grasp the necessity of thisautonomy has become rather a bad habit, I fear.I think she feels entitled to keep the details a secret even from you and I, although she has hinted at modifications I frankly cannot credit.I am making haste to gain some clarity, and to make clear to HER that the fiefdom she appears to have enjoyed is now at an end.However, the little I have been able to gather suggests it essential to maintain absolute secrecy until we know exactly what we are dealing with.I will revert soonest.Eli read the message again, twice, feeling his own surprise harden into suspicion.Another link pulsed at the foot of the message.He slowly reached out and tapped it to life.Binary        Planning She has the shape of it now.She glances at the map openly but without expression, knowing that they are more likely to notice her if she appears furtive.So her blue eyes blink in studied disinterest, while the brain behind them analyzes and memorizes, filing away contour lines, river courses, place names.The name of this place.She already knows a great deal about it.Its outer walls describe the limits of her existence, its inner corridors and compartments the ambit of all her days.She knows every nook and cranny, every line and seam; even the forbidden spaces are familiar shapes, their boundaries explored under the guise of play or aimless wandering.She knows some of what goes on in them; she knows that the upper reaches of the complex house more freaks than her, that others have replaced her long dead batch siblings, though she is rarely permitted to see them.She suspects that some at least may be destined for a life beyond the laratory, and precautions must be taken to ensure no knowledge of her departs it with them.She knows the lab itself has been here a long time, from well before her own inexplicable advent.And she knows that it is secretso secret that the world beyond these walls is largely ignorant of its existence.She gleaned this first from diligent eavesdropping, and confirmed it when she learned to daisy chain her truncated tablet to less limited devices and access the infostream that flows invisibly through walls as wide as the span of her arms, past the double locked doors with their retscanners and armed guards, up the elevator shaft she has never been allowed to enter.Up and out, into the world.A world in which the place she inhabits appears to be both named and unknown.The irony amuses her.She contemplates this, knowing it helps her remain detached, helps hide any hint of excitement.She has dreamed of escape for as long as she can remember, but the edges of the dream have always been indefinite, amorphous.Escape into what?Where?She realizes now that this has worried her far more than the mere mechanics of departure, the difficulties of how to get out.She has been planning for how since she broke the first level of encryption on that first tablet, maybe since she first took hold of Dr.Owens lab coat and called him by name.She has cultivated forbearance, and accumulated knowledge, for just this reason.Now, finally, she knows that above her head is a strangely named forest, and anticipation makes her lift and rustle the newly fledged wings on her back.No teeming city in which she would be spotted and brought down before she has gone two steps, no wired encampment patrolled by armed guards.They have no need of a secondary prison.Forty yards of earth and rock beneath fifty miles of wilderness is more than enough.They have wandered away from the map, and she listens to them talk loudly about expansion, reallocation of space, improved access.Even now it never occurs to them to consider what they say in front of her, and she almost shakes her head in wonder.She knows so much more than they imagine, and this buried citadel is not as impregnable as they think.She has been planning for a long time, observing and calculating, assessing habits and shift patterns, compiling a mental inventory of what she will need and where to find it when the time comes.Teaching herself the chemistry of damage.She takes a last look at the map.There are other names on it, names she recognizes from her illicit excursions by tablet.Outlaw places that promise sanctuary to such as her.Places she can disappear into.She will have to act quickly, before the plans they are making can alter the patterns that she knows.She drifts toward the door, the dorm, her tablet.She is already composing the messages she will encrypt and send, seeing in her minds eye the steps she must take, the risks she must run, to win herself a life.There will be casualties.Of that she has no doubt.But then, there already have been.She remembers a boy with a twisted spine and barely a face, and eyes as blue as her own, and she has no qualms.The shape of it is clear to her, and she knows what she must do.Binary       20 Rhys tucked a pillow behind his back and tried to find a comfortable position in the endlessly adjustable, perfectly ergonomic institutional armchair hed dragged over to the window.The pain was not as bad as the first time theyd found the formula that would trigger his muscles to spasm out of control, but the trembling and residual twitches seemed worse, and there remained a pervasive soreness throughout his body that made him want to do nothing more than curl up and sleep it away.He kept his back firmly turned to the hospital bed hed vacated as soon as the doctors had left the room, and focused on his tablet.The pattern was about to reveal itself; he could sense it, like a word just out of reach on the tip of his tongue, like the cacophony of a crowded room the instant before sit sense rendered its actors discrete and comprehensible.The genetypes were ready to give up their secrets.He had delved down, past the shorthand of labeling systems and lists of key features that told only what the gemtech engineers had considered important, down into the core language of amino acid sequences and the subtler cues of the epigenetic control switches.And found nothing; layered one atop the other they neither merged nor strongly contrasted.These were, as he had explained to Sharon, transitional genetypesthe intermediate stages before the final assembly, the spectacular splices, that would result in a supernormal human.They were in themselves both crucial and unimportant.That shared insignificance, the realization that each sample of stolen genestock represented no more than a thing on its way to becoming another thing, was the first connection between them he had found.Then there were the haunting similarities between certain chunks of code, random alignments of sequence that were neither baseline normal nor identical to each other, but that felt like echoes, seeming to repeat and recur with variations major and minor across the archaic genestock of half a dozen gemtechs.If you looked at the genetypes in their entirety the resemblances appeared coincidental.But if you popped those sequences out of the chromosomal array, mapped the engineering markers not just back to baseline but against each other...He had it.The sequence strings he had isolated slid across the surface of his tablet, organizing themselves into a hierarchy, a fractal pattern with antecedents and dependents.There were gaps in the structure, pulsing question marks where further links should logically occur, but the overall shape was clear.He felt the breath go out of him.For a long moment he sat there stunned, the ache in his back and legs forgotten.He knew he needed to check and double check, run tests to audit the relationships he had found, prove whether or not they were robust.He also knew, with a certainty that he recognized as the subconscious calculus of his own altered brain, that what he was looking at was right, it was real.The audit would be for the reassurance of others, not for him.He tapped more layers of information into being.Provenance, possible avenues of transcription.The missing pieces, the gaps, sprang into sharp relief.And began to tell their own story.He had the full picture, and more, when Gwen arrived half an hour later.He looked up as she slipped into the room, blinking in surprise as she pushed back the hood on one of his larger and more shapeless pullovers.Instead of springing free, the long curls of her hair had been pulled back and pinned up.It made their glimmer almost as tame and constrained as his own short locks.Whats that for?He glanced out of the window, then back at her.Its not raining.Its raining fans.Well, not exactly, but I keep getting recognized and, you know, you have to stop and talk to people.I didnt want to be late.She dropped her satchel onto the bed.Howre you feeling?Okay.A lot better than this morning.Wheres Da?Airwalk.The meetings running late.Apparently the aquatech buyers dont see why they should be required to maintain the same environmental standards in their onshore operations as well.Dont think it should be any of the gillungs concern.Da needed to stay and be the voice of moral authority, and I guess hes taking you at your word about prioritizing the contracts.She sat on the edge of the bed.He did say hes really sorry, hell see us back at Aris.As long as youre cleared to come home, of course.Yeah.Im supposed to take it easy for a couple of days.He caught her look, and shrugged.Even easier than usual, which would be damn difficult.Youre not exactly doing nothing.She jerked her chin at the tablet.When they say complete rest I dont think they mean spend hours investigating a criminal conspiracy.If I were staring into space doing nothing Id be a hell of a lot worse off, I think.And its incredible, Gwennie, what Ive found...He trailed off under her steady stare, a look he knew to mean she was not remotely interested in what was swirling on the screen of his tablet, and was not about to allow the subject to be changed.He decided to wait it out, pointedly settled himself deeper into the chair, and stared right back.She blew out a sigh, mouth quirking into a startlingly accurate impersonation of Aryels ironic half smile.So.Whats the verdict?Or are you going to tell me second again this time?Thats not fair.How dyou work that out?Its what happened.Gwennie, I already know youre going to stand by me to the end of time, come what may, all of that.Thats us, thats who we are.Rhys did not mention how absent shed been even when they were together, how often hed thought over the past weeks that he was little more than a distraction as she focused on building her career, how much his words felt like hope instead of certainty.Callanits like I told you before.I cant just assume the same things about him.You werent around, you were off doing music stuff, Da was down at the river...Callan was there and he wanted to know what was wrong and I needed to tell someone.Plus I didnt think it was fair to keep it from him.Were you worried he wouldnt be up for it after all?I guess I was, a little.I didnt know, not for certain.Rhys did not try to downplay his relief at the memory of Callans reaction.I couldnt just go on what I hoped would be true.Will be true.Sticking around through thisits not going to be pretty, Gwen.He may change his mind yet.Her face went still as she registered the implication.He could hear the struggle as she tried to keep her voice light.Do they know anything more now than they did yesterday?Or the day before?Theyre even more certain now of what they thought yesterday and the day before.Its degenerative.If they cant find a treatment soon, it will become terminal.He heard himself deliver the news in a voice as flat and even as if he were describing a programming problem or projecting the latest algae harvest, and wondered at the calm he now felt after his terror and tears of only a few days ago.He knew in a vague way that it had something to do with the unfolding puzzle of the genestock thefts; something about it that both diverted him from his own prognosis and gave him hope.It too had the whiff of pending inspiration, of a connection waiting to be made.But one that would have to wait a bit longer, because now it was Gwen whose face was crumbling from apprehension into anguish, and who was starting to cry.He hauled himself out of the chair, leaving the tablet behind and pulling her up into a hug.He was mortified to feel how limp she was, as though she had suddenly found herself a weight too heavy to bear, and how she shook against his chest.Gwennie, Im sorry.Dont.Stop.Gwennie, its okay.It is not fucking okay!It came out muffled, shouted through sobs.He stroked her bound up hair and murmured to her in twin speak, and was relieved when she pushed away from him with her usual supple strength after a few minutes, drying her eyes on the pullover.Im sorry, he said again.Maybe I shouldnt have said it like that...but Gwennie, its no different from what they told us before, its just confirmation...and...and you werent so upset then, I didnt think youd...I didnt believe it could be true.How can it be true?You dont seem any worse.She sniffed loudly, glaring at him now, still wiping her eyes with the backs of her hands.You get better, you go right back to normal, you always say you feel fine...I do, but it takes me longer each time.They understand why now.She had herself under control, finally, and he spun the heavy chair back into its accustomed position and sat down.She sank back onto the bed, listening.Every attack makes the next attack more likely.The more often they happen the less time my muscles and nerves will have to recover, which means the damage will accumulate, which means the next attack will do even more damage.So the key is to stop you having attacks in the first place.Her focus was coming back, she was thinking about solutions.Good.A distracted, self absorbed Gwen might leave him feeling neglected; a weeping, shaking, panicking one threatened to throw his entire world out of balance.Exactly.They think the cureif there is onewill have to be some kind of epigenetic therapy, a drug that suppresses the right molecular switches in the right order for the right amount of time.It would need to be very precise, or it might do more harm than good.Do they know how to make it?Theyre pretty sure they could if they had my genetype, and comparing your genome with mine is helping them work out where the trouble spots are.But its not isolated to one chromosome, its not even just in the DNA.Its the whole protein environment.He could feel his own frustration mount, a coil of anger and fear in his chest as he described the problem.He sighed it out, leaning forward with elbows on knees, running his hands over his hair.Another version of a classic Aryel gesture.He was annoyed rather than amused by the flash of insight, but even as aggravation overtook him he knew it for a warning.We are so engineered, Gwennie.Were so fucking altered.Anyone else with genetics this weird would have some obvious purpose, theyd be able to breathe water or read binary or fucking fly.The doctors could look at their phenotypes, their physical reality, and say Aha!We can compare you to this gem or that gem, someone else that they do have the full assembly manual for.As it is, working out what they need to know from the genome data alone is like trying to reverse engineer a. ..a. ..Rhys looked for a simile, failed to find one.I dont know what.A planet, a galaxy.Theres nothing else living thats as complicated as we are.What are you going to do?Work with the doctors.Do my own research.Stay as busy as I can.Try not to get into the frame of mind where I have an attack.He fished the tablet out from beneath him, dropped it onto the bed beside his own overnight bag.This helps, believe me.What I cant believe is that youre taking it so well.Staying so calm.I have to stay calm.Im not saying its easy.I cried my eyes out with Callan the other day.Are you sureare you absolutely certainthat youre safe with him?Im sure.I know it sounds bizarre with this hanging over us, but underneath it all he makes me so happy.Im safer with him than with anyone else, except you.When they got home Sharon and Callan were both waiting on Aryels spacious balconyliving room.They took in Gwens red rimmed eyes and subdued greeting, and looked alarmed.Aryel herself, leaning casually against the finger thin safety rail along the edge of the drop, closed her own eyes for a moment in silent acknowledgment of the story Gwens told, though her face did not change.Rhys felt the tension in the room like a blow against his already aching body, and sighed.Stop it, all of you.Its not good news, but no worse than it was, really.He dropped his bag on the floor and let Callan pull him into an embrace.They held each other tight for a long moment, before Rhys pushed gently away.Ive got some stuff I need to tell Sharon, then Im all yours.In the meantime, Gwennie can fill you in, okay?Callan nodded wordlessly and kissed him, the soft smooch on the corner of his mouth that had become habit, that filled him with such a surge of contentment it seemed impossible he could ever be ill again.Over Callans shoulder he saw his older sisters expression shift, bright blue eyes shadowed in thought and the firm lines of mouth and jaw that told him she was already scoping, assessing, casting the net of her own ferocious intelligence wide in search of a solution.Im not sure you can fix this one, Ari.But please, please try.He watched her usher Gwen and Callan toward the kitchen, then turned back to Sharon.I headed over when I got your message, she said tightly.But I didnt expect you to be working while you were in the hospital, Rhys.It can wait...Thank goodness I did work.Kept me from going crazy.And no, I dont think it can.
