The commander turned out to be Pipa, his green skin now taut and smooth since he was eating better, his familiar grin splitting his wide head from earslit to earslit."Hi, Jerry," he croaked."Long time no see, not since the dustup in the DnDrf mine.Those were the good old days "  "Look!"John ordered."Report first, reminisce later if you don't mind.You tracked the fleeing Lortonoi?""That we did, sir, like the hound of hell, tracking them as they fled down through the light years.Their track ended in a star cluster out on the galactic rim, or rather at one star in particular that is called Diesun.This star has a rather unusual planet or satellite or whatever the hell you want to call it.Sorry, chief, but my powers of description fail me.Let me flash a slide on the screen, and then I'll fill in the details.You're not going to believe this, I know we didn't.Could I have the first slide, please?"A solidograph picture instantly appeared in midair before them, and they gasped in unison."I don't believe it," John said."What kind of funny games you up to, you miserable toad?""Please, have patience, I beg!I can get the rest of the crew in, and we'll swear loyalty and truth on bended knee and take a polygraph test, the works.This is what we found out there. "This was a thing like a hula hoop in space.It could have been a discarded hunk of machinery or something like that until you looked at the scale.For that sphere of light floating in its center was a sun.Or rather a 'sun'.This whatchmacallit in space was floating, rotating, around the sun like an immense wheel without spokes."I know what they've done," Jerry said, snapping his fingers loudly."It was in the astronomical literature a couple of years back, a real mad idea.But this proves that no idea is so mad that there isn't someone  or something somewhere just mad enough to try it. ""Would you kindly tell us just what the hell you are talking about?"John snapped."Happily.Here is what you do if you have unlimited energy and plenty of time.Say you got a solar system like our own solar system.You've been mining the habitable planets, namely, Earth, for a long time, drilling wells and that kind of thing.So what happens?You know what happens.You start nmning out.The wells run dry, the minerals are all used up, and things begin to look poorly.Of course you can send spaceships to other planets to open mines, but there is a problem in logistics and getting the stuff back and so forth.So what you do, if you are set up for it, and somebody really was if we can believe this slide, you rearrange the whole solar system.You bash all the planets and moons together, which melts them up, and then you extrude this molten gunk through a large orifice until you get a long tube of the stuff, and then you flatten the tube so you have like a long plank or maybe a ribbon in space.After that, all you have to do is join the ends of the ribbon together so they stick and you got a big hoop which rotates around the sun. ""What have you been drinking  or smoking?"John asked suspiciously."Come on!You asked for the theory, so I'm giving it to you.I'm not telling you how to do it, just what to do.So, you have this hula hoop floating around the sun, and after a while it cools down so you can land on it and plant trees and bring the people and the animals and such back and you have a real nifty world.You build the thing at the correct distance from the sun so the temperature is just right, and all the time the same since there is no night and day since the thing doesn't rotate but spins instead.You've also arranged so that all the minerals are easily available and can be dug up by strip mining.What resources you have!A planet like Jupiter has maybe a million times as much minerals as poor old Earth.So with plenty of raw materials, sunshine, peace, and prosperity you can throw away the birth control pills and just let the population grow.This hula hoop world will have like a billion times the surface available for population, so it will be a long time before you fill it up.All in all it may sound like a nutty idea, but if you can get it to work, you have a good deal going. ""Or the Lortonoi have a good deal going," John mused, looking at the slide, and a sudden chill passed over them all.What mischief those monsters could create if they controlled a hoop world like this one!The same black thought, possessed them all at the same time, and an aura of gloom obsessed the room.It was John who finally broke the dark silence, and there was a cheery note to his words."Cheer up, guys!It's always darkest before the dawn!""Piss off, you pollyannaish sod," Jerry muttered, wishing they had thought to bring the brandy with them."I mean it.Aren't we forgetting this?"He took the tiny golden sphere from his shirt pocket and tossed it, glinting, into the air."Things have to get worse before they can get better.So let us hope that the Lortonoi are really up to some loathsome piece of nastiness out there, something so awful that we can report to the Chachkas and get Krakar to polish them off once and for all.I hate to sound like a warmonger, but the worse things get now, the better they will be in the long run. "Jerry laughed aloud."You're right, you know.So let's fire up our entire fleet of battle cruisers and space battleships and go out there and see if we can cause some real trouble!"18  THE MIGHTIEST ARMADA  LAUNCHED!It was a mighty armada of space the likes of which had never been seen before in the lenticular galaxy, or in the nearby spiral galaxy, or in any galaxy for that matter.Representatives of a thousand races were here, sentient creatures who were physically different in every way; rocklike Felsenig from the ten gravity world of Felsen, fairylike Guntzel pogue from the tenth gravity world of the same name, snakelike Slangeorm, vegetablelike Karotene, sluglike Caracoller  and thousands more.If you were to put them in the same room together  it would have to be a rather large, air conditioned room  it really would be a kind of loathsome sight.But what is beauty except in the eye of the beholder, and some of these things, aliens rather, didn't even have eyes.But they had loved ones and mates, sometimes up to sixteen when there were that many sexes, as with the Jigajig, who did almost nothing except that because it was so complicated.They knew the heights of elation, the depths of despair.They were free.Well, most of them were.And the despots were usually kind despots.But what mattered was that each one of these free races were living their lives in the way they wanted and were not being ruled by outsiders.They had joined together under the banner of freedom to fight against the loathsome Lortonoi, who would have ruled and crushed them all.At the heart of the immense fleet was the former space armada of the Hagg Loos, donated by the Hagg Inder, who had won the final battle and instantly stripped their insane relatives of all capacity to wage further war.Stretching out on both sides, and back into the distance as far as the eye could see, were the spacers of all the other races.Here they were, the volunteers from worlds who had known the terror of the Lortonoi and would do anything to fight that galactic menace, spaceships from free worlds that knew you could not subdivide liberty and were willing to fight for that cause, great thundering spacers from other free worlds who wanted to stay free and "voluntarily" donated a few spacers to the fleet when it hovered above their planets.They were all here  and what a heterogeneous sight it was!Mile long gray metal battleships, fast, needlepointed scouts, great lumbering gunships made of small planetoids on which giant space cannon had been mounted.While, there, up front, leading this tremendous fleet, was the silver form of the Pleasantville Eagle!Old Glory had been painted proudly on both sides of her immense tail, with the United Nations flag much smaller down below.Wings spread like the eagle she was, she stayed there in the van.Beware, Lortonoi, because the Galaxy Rangers are on the prowl.Shake with fear in your dank dens though you may, justice is coming closer, light year by light year, with every passing moment.A banquet had been spread in the lounge of the old Eagle.Whiter than white tablecloths and sparkling silver drew the eye, while the nose twitched with appreciation at the succulent smells emerging from the kitchen.The top echelon of the Galaxy Rangers gathered for a last celebration before the space armada reached the star Diesun and its strange satellite.John, as Ranger Number One was at the head of the table, with the other Earthmen on each side of him.Sally would, they hoped, join them later; meanwhile, she was sweating it out in the galley with her assistants.The other Rangers crowded the tables, shoulder to shoulder, drinking and laughing together irrespective of the color of their skins; black, red, white, green, polkadot, all mingled and drank.Except, of course, for Lord Prrsi and the other red hot races who had a heated corner to themselves.Loud laughter rose, hearty shouts, and an occasional belch.This was comradeship indeed, the likes of which had never been seen before.After they had dined and Sally had showered and joined them, John tapped on his wineglass for attention, and an expectant hush fell."Rangers, our moment of destiny is upon us.Our agents throughout the lenticular galaxy report no activity by the Lortonoi.We have driven them from refuge to refuge until now they have reached the end of their rope and have holed up upon the strange construction circling the nearby sun, Diesun.They are trapped!And we are upon them.There will be a battle, and there will be bloodshed, but it will all be in a noble cause.To destroy the Lortonoi is worth any sacrifice.... ""Ooooooonnnnh.... "This ghastly sound broke through his words and silenced him, a keening wail of agony from the centermost table.A chair fell over, and a plump green figure writhed on the rug."Aid for that Ranger!"John ordered."He has been taken ill. ""Don't touch him!"another green alien, not unlike the first, cried out, jumping to his feet."Pipa and I are of the same race, from the planet Bachtria, and I recognize the symptoms.Our race is an ancient one, and we are possessed of psionic abilities like no other.Normally these psi powers lie dormant, but occasionally, in periods of immense stress, when something strange looms in the future and coming events cast their shadows before them, why, then those sensitives of our race manage to break through the temporal barrier.This is happening at this moment to my colleague, Pipa, now writhing there upon your rug.His body is now only a shell while his ego moves into the future.Soon it will return with a message, and you must all be silent and listen.I know not what that message will be, but I do know that it will be a matter of grave importance, of life and death, for at no other times is the psi ego torn from the body in this manner.Hark!He begins to speak. ""Korax ...korax ... "Pipa croaked, then mumbled more words incoherently.The tension strained and tightened, and there was scarcely a breath drawn as the words became clearer, comprehensible to them all."Woe!Oh, woe!What ghastliness lies ahead...all things are not as they seem...victory is defeat and winners shall lose ...woe, woe.Take heed, for a trap is being set and the end of the galaxy as we know it is at hand...many gathered here today will never meet again.Now mark me ...and mark me well...say your good byes, for the end is near!".After this the voice became incoherent again and degenerated to a mumble, and the mumble turned into a snore as Pipa slept soundly upon the floor."And exactly what does all that mean?"John asked the other Bachtrian, who shrugged his green shoulders in despair."Beats me, Number One.These ego trips tend to speak in riddles and that kind of thing, so it is anybody's guess.But he did seem to be sort of clear there toward the end, and if you don't mind, let me say good bye to you now and shake your hand.It sure has been great up to now to be a Ranger, and if you have to die, it is best to die in a worthy cause.I think.Though of course I would really prefer not to die at all. "With these words he hopped over to John and pumped his hand.After this there was a lot of solemn good bye saying and hand shaking, and the party broke up under a cloud of gloom."Well, I must say," Sally declared."After all that cooking and trouble, it certainly appears that it really wasn't worth it. ""That was great friend Ormoloo," John told her, attempting to insert a note of cheer, but it did no good.In a minute the Earthlings were alone again, surrounded by the debris of the deserted banquet."I'll wash if you'll dry," Chuck said."Not now," Jerry snapped."There are more important things to consider.Just shovel everything into a big box, and we'll worry about it later.In just a matter of hours we will be popping out of the space warp near this damn hula hoop in space, and from what our green friend predicted it is not going to be a pushover.Anyone got any ideas?""We'll have to go in first," Chuck said."We have the only cheddite projector mounted on this ship, so we can get into and out of trouble faster than anything else in the fleet.Why don't we have them hold just one space warp away so they can come arunnin' when we blow the whistle?Meanwhile, we go in quick, get the lay of the land, and split if it gets too hot. ""I agree," John agreed."It's dangerous, but it's the only chance we have of finding out a thing before the entire fleet is committed.I vote let's go. ""I'm with you," Jerry said."Vou're all insane!"Sally cried."It is suicide.Let someone else do it. "They smiled wry smiles at her, and John spoke for them all."Sorry, Sally, old girl, but we can't oblige.The chip is on the Lortonoi shoulder, and we are just going to have to knock it off.Why do men fight bulls?Race high speed cars?Go to the Moon?Climb Mount Everest?Because they are there "  "Nuts!You do it for the old machismo, bragging about who has the biggest cojones.Well, I'll have nothing to do with it.I'm going to clean up this mess and then go to bed with a sleeping pill and a murder mystery and hope that I wake up alive, not dead. "They laughed when she left, knowing she was just a simple hysterical woman, then turned themselves to men's destructive work.Orders were issued to the fleet, which slowly ground to a halt, with a few fatal crashes, of course, which is to be expected when you try to stop a fleet of thousands of giant spaceships.The Rangers who manned the battle stations aboard the Pleasantville Eagle were all in position, and Lord Prrsi poked his head up from the hatch to the insulated hold to see the action.One by one the green lights blinked on on the ready board, signifying that every position was manned and ready, until the entire board was green, except for the red light from Sally's compartment, where she was zonked out by two Seconals washed down with twenty cc.of Noctec."Are you ready, Rangers?"John called out, and from every compartment, except one of course, came back the echoing shout."Then here we go!"In a single slithering jump the great airplane spaceship plunged through into the lambda dimension and popped out again not far from the bright star Diesun.Every alarm went off and they stared at the visiplates at a great battle in space going on not too far from them.Fantastically powerful battleships  the smallest of them would dwarf the largest they had in their fleet  were locked in dogged conflict.They used energy weapons with great prolificacy, and all space was filled with the shock and shimmer of the ravening forces that tore at the very fabric of space itself.Ravening rays worried at the force screens that shielded other ships, while force fields of highly charged ions, no more than a few feet in diameter but having the power of a hundred hydrogen bombs, floated about ready to explode at the slightest touch.John touched the controls and pulled the ship back a few thousand miles, and they all nodded agreement."Easier to watch on the long distance scope," Jerry said offhandedly."We don't want to really mix with them until we learn the score. ""We don't want to mix with them at all," John said, speaking aloud what they all were thinking."I've got a feeling we are kind of playing out of our league with these babies. ""Cheer up," Jerry said, pointing at the screen."Don't forget there are two sides there, and they seem pretty even.One of them has to be on our side  I hope  so it's not as bad as it looks.I think. ""ATTENTION!"Alarms buzzed again, and the radar operator's voice cut in above them."Object approaching on collision course from the direction of space battle.Estimated ETA, fourteen seconds. ""Strap in!Am taking evasion measures," Jerry said into the intercom."Here we go!"They darted away at right angles and hovered expectantly, every screen focused on the oncoming danger.Was it a space battleship on their tail?Or perhaps a missile?Time would tell.And it did."A piece of wreckage," Chuck said."Looks like a big chunk torn out of one of the spacers that blew up. ""I'll match velocities," Jerry announced, fingers busy at the controls."This may answer some questions, if there is still anyone alive in that hunk of junk.Mind shields on, everyone, just in case there are Lortonoi aboard or in mental control.And, Chuck, be a good fellow and slip down and put Sally's on her, just for a change, and for God's sake, tie it into place this time. "Nearer and nearer the chunk of spatial debris came, until they could see that it was a slice cut out of a battle ship by ravening rays, sort of like a Tum pulled out of the package, a disk, you know.All the compartments they could see were filled with incomprehensible machinery, now gutted and burned out and empty."Looks pretty bad," Jerry mused."I'll try the radio, just in case. "He flicked swiches rapidly and spoke into the microphone."Hello, hunk of space debris formerly part of a great battleship.Do you read me?We are close by and offer help.Over. "The speaker fried and burbled with the static of distant stars, but otherwise all was silent."Try 176.45 kilocycles," John suggested."That is the emergency band a lot of spaceships use.These people may know it too. "Jerry repeated his message on this frequency, and this time, when he threw the switches, a distant hissing could be heard and a weak voice."Can read you.Oxygen almost gone.Open space lock so I can board.Sole survivor. ""Jump to it, guys!"John ordered and the smoothworking team functioned as if it were running on oiled ball bearings.The magnet ray operators drew the clumsy piece of junk close while the cargo operator opened the outer hatch.A moment later there was a thump and a bump as something entered the lock, and the outer hatch closed.Mighty pumps throbbed as they pushed air back into the lock chamber, and when the pressure had been equalized, the inner door opened automatically, and every eye was upon it.What would the alien possessor of the weak voice look like?He looked a lot different from anything their wildest speculations could have imagined.Bending, to get through the opening, came an individual who stood at least eight feet tall from the top of his head crest to the bottom of his clawed feet.And he was impressive!Just as mankind enjoys a sort of simian ancestry, primates and all that, and the Bachtrians emerged from the swamps in froggy form, so did this strange individual obviously have a certain animal phylum or species in his background.Birds!And what a bird he was!His immense yellow beak would tear open a boiler plate as easily as an aluminum beer can.His eyes were piercing and hooded, like a great hawk or eagle.He wore no clothes, nor did he need any, for his magnificent plumage was clothing enough.His large wings were folded on his back, and the claws on his three immense toes tore gaping rents in the carpet as he walked.Unlike most birds, however, he had two well built arms, as well as wings, and he hooked his well built thumbs into his wide gunbelt as he strode into their midst and stopped."Who is master here?"he asked with the air of one who commands."I am Galaxy Ranger Number One," John said, striding over fearlessly to stand before the giant figure."Men call me John. ""Greetings, John.I am Troceps of the Fligigleh and am called that only by my friends.You have saved my life, therefore, I owe you a life.Whom shall I kill?"His fingers twitched at his gun butt."Hold on, Troceps, old chicken, we don't hold with that sort of thing.Thanks will do, and the slate is wiped clean. ""I say thanks and your slate is wiped clean, John old ape, but mine is not.If I can kill no one for you, why, then I must kill myself. "His gun leaped from the holster, and he poked it against one staring eye while John leaned forward to restrain him."No need for that sort of thing here.Get feathers and blood all over the place.Wait a bit and we'll get you a prisoner or a spy to knock off.... ""Spy, now that is a good idea. "He glared around the room with hawklike stare, and all there swayed away from that merciless glance."Ah, yes, there is always one, count on that.A weak creature, ex slave, who has sold out to his decadent master on his miserable home planet who reports directly to the loathsome Lortonoi.He is filled with fear now, but he is not sure it is he I am talking about.I laugh in his beak, I mean teeth!He knows not the penetrating power of my thoughts, thought power that is even stronger than the Lortonoi.Therefore, I give him a clue so he will know I know he knows I know.The clue is this  your mother's maiden name is Ixstaiclj!"The krung field operator jumped up from his station and whipped out his gun, but fast as he was, Troceps was the faster.A single bolt of energy sped from his blaster, and the hapless spy was instant charcoal."The debt is paid, and we are even," Troceps proclaimed, blowing into the muzzle of his blaster, then coughing at the smoke that eddied out around his head."Well done," John said."Now, with ceremonies out of the way, could you tell us who you are, what your outfit is, what is going on out there in that space battle, where you come from, that sort of thing?Just so we can get to know you better.And what was that name you mentioned, sounded like Lortonoi?Who are they  friends of yours?"He smiled cheerfully as he talked and casually loosened his gun in his holster while a whispering sound slithered through the cabin as everyone else loosened their guns in their holsters.There was tension in the air, while all eyes were on the newcomer.Troceps shook his great wings, and a feather came loose.He caught it before it touched the floor and used it to pick his beak with.The silence and tension stretched  and broke suddenly as Troceps put his head back and roared with laughter."I should not laugh," he said, laughing and wiping the tears from his eyes with a touch of the feather."But you are all so transparent.After my demonstration you must realize that I can penetrate the simple mind shield you wear and know your every thought.So you will know mine too, I invite you, the hot one over there with his head sticking out of the floor, to enter my brain and read my innermost thoughts.I see you have great powers of mental strength.Enter  my mind is an open book!""Happy to oblige," Lord Prrsi said and clacked his claws in concentration.It took only a matter of moments for him to get in and get out, and his claws clacked the louder."I say, chaps," he enthused."This blighter is one of us.His people have been fighting the Lortonoi for simply ages!"19  LOATHSOME LORTONOI UNVEILED!Enthusiastic shouts of joy echoed from the cabin walls at the realization that there were new recruits to the banner of the anti Lortonoi forces.And what recruits!Fighting men like Troceps here, as well as incredible space battleships such as the ones they had seen locked in combat."Locked in combat," John thought."Just a second, Troceps, old parrot.Glad to have you on our side and all that, but who were the guys you were fighting out there?Not to run down your space armada or anything, but you seemed to be pretty well matched with the nasties.Would you care to fill us in?""Happy to.But first  do you have a bowl of water?""We have a bowl of anything you want, including hundred year old brandy. ""The water will do fine.It is not for me; we Fligigleh have rugged constitutions and can fight for weeks on a handful of birdseed.The water is for my little pet, Pishky. "As he said this, he held up his blaster and unscrewed the base of the butt which proved to be hollow, and from its interior there dropped a little green turtle that scrabbled about in the palm of his hand."Looks just like a little green turtle from Earth," Jerry said, speaking for all of them."Very possibly.But as I see in your minds, you Earthlings keep birds for pets, and that is just the way we Fligigleh keep turtles.They are considered good luck charms, and whenever I go into battle, little Pishky rides along happy in my gun butt "  "Look, not to interrupt," John interrupted, "but can't we do the turtle thing later?We would rather hear about that other fleet and stuff. ""But of course, I will explain. "But he didn't until the water appeared, and little Pishky was paddling about with turtle eyes staring up stupidly at the happy face of its aquiline master.Troceps stroked its shell with his forefinger before turning his attention back to his hosts."It is a story that goes back a long way, but the entire story must be told for you to grasp any single part of it.My race is an ancient one, so ancient that by any of your standards of measurement you cannot measure the amount of time we have been around.Since earliest time we were bothered with production problems and population problems.There are two things we really like to do, and they are build bigger and better machines and lay plenty of eggs.Ahh, the sight of those eggs!But I digress.Any male Fligigleh considers himself a failure and blows his brains out if he doesn't have at least twenty chicks and a personal car at least thirty meters long.Well, I see that you begin to get the problem.We invented a space drive, moved on and occupied all the nearest worlds and so forth, but we aren't really the space conquering types.All we want to do is stay home and lay eggs and drive around in our fortymeter long cars.So some unsung genius cooked up this idea of mashing together all the planets in a star system until they melted, then stretching them out into a belt and sending the whole thing spinning around.This was done, and we left all our occupied worlds and settled on this new world, which is named Cotorra after the inventor of the technique, so maybe he is not so unsung either.Ahh, look at little Pishky scratch his weensie claws against the glass, scrabbling with wide eyed stupidity!""Nice turtle, sure," Chuck said, smiling falsely."But could you sort of tell us what happened next after you all settled down on Cotorra?""Be patient, I said it would be long in the telling.We settled down and enjoyed our way of life.Uncontrolled breeding and car building, and there was no end in sight for millions of years.More space was available for nests and roads as we expanded out from the original site of settlement.And this did go on for millions of years, pure bliss I assure you, a period in our history we always refer to as the Golden Egg Years, but it was to come to an end.The Lortonoi arrived!"Troceps squawked the name out with great irritation, lashing out his foot unconsciously at the same time so that his great claws ripped a seat to pieces and tore gaping rents in the carpet and the dural floor beneath."Oh, those evil Lortonoi!Although we have excellent powers of the mind, some genealogical change had occurred in our race as it spread in both directions out from the original site.By this time we had occupied almost three quarters of the hoop that is our world, and in a few million more years the expanding frontiers would have met and we would have to think about maybe making another world like this or perhaps patching in an extra piece or something.But this was fated never to occur.The Lortonoi discovered that a crunched gene or something had so weakened the mental strength of the Fligigleh at the left end of the expansion that their minds could be entered and controlled by the Lortonoi.We on the right still maintained our traditional mental health and expelled their slimy thoughts the second they touched our pristine brains.I am sure that you see the setup now.The leftists began arming, and we armed too in self defense.At first a ground war occupied the opposing forces and the space between the expanding population fronts became a noman's land.However, as weapons became more powerful, this proved impractical since our hoop isn't that thick and it could have been blown right through, which wouldn't help anybody.So air war began, then space war as both sides sought to protect their populations, and the whole thing expanded farther and farther into space along this front.So, for millennia now, we have been locked in this endless war, which serves to keep our population down and our factories humming.We both draw supplies and soldiers from our rear and build bigger and better war machines until the result, as you would have seen if you watched the battle during which my ship was destroyed, is space war on a scale never considered before.I must add, in closing, that the recent engagement was only the most minor clash between very weak scout ship patrols and of no importance.You should see what happens when the really big battleships mix it up. "A shudder ran through the room at this news, and John had to swallow heavily before he could speak."Well, I guess it is good for you that we are here to throw our armed might into the conflict on your side, tip the balance that will win the war for liberty. ""I don't mean to scoff," Troceps said in a very superior manner."But I have examined the size of your fleet through your memories and, not meaning to be insulting, old primate, your forces wouldn't stand the chance of a snowball in hell up against the enemy.Zap!They would be cinders in microseconds. ""Well, I'm not sure of that," John said defensively."And it is not only the fleet which is so great, but we have the cheddite projector which can whisk their battleships into the sun before they get close enough to fire. "He picked up the cheddite projector, which still looked like a five cell flashlight, and waved it proudly as all the others cheered."Oh, that," Troceps said, and of course his beak showed no expression, but if it could have showed expression, it certainly would have shown a sneer."We know all about that already.It seems the Lortonoi appeared with one of those things awhile back, and they did manage to pick off a battleship or two before our scientists developed a kappa radiation screen that completely stops the radiation from the thing, and that is that.But it is nice of you to offer, and we do appreciate it, but my suggestion is that you all split before you get squashed by the big boys.Maybe we can't lick the Lortonoi, but we sure have them stopped  and have had them stopped for a long time.The only thing we have not been able to do is crack the mind screen that covers their headquarters, so we have no idea of what they look like.Other than that we have things under control and will hold the forefront of this battle against the common enemy.You can go home. ""No we can't," Jerry pouted, sulking for all of them."The Galaxy Rangers were organized to wipe out the Lortonoi, and we cannot stop until that is done.Nothing else is possible. ""One thing is," Jerry said, in a strange voice."The Galaxy Rangers could be wiped out instead. ""Bite your tongue!"Chuck shouted."What's got into you that you should be talking like that?"Jerry chuckled evilly, and his tongue flashed in and out like a serpent's, and his voice dripped venom when he spoke."That's just about the size of it.What's got into me.... ""He is possessed by a Lortonoi!"Lord Prrsi shouted."I can detect the alien presence stronger than I have ever detected it before. ""Yes, the Lortonoi are here, and it is the end of the ballgame for you libertarian, religious swine.We are taking over.We have won!""What do you mean?"Chuck gasped, inadvertently stepping back from his occupied friend."I mean that this is the moment we set the stage for.We wanted all the forces opposed to us to be gathered together at the same time so we could destroy them.They are here now and will be destroyed by the Fligigleh forces we command. ""You forget about the Fligigleh forces you don't command," crowed Troceps, striding forward."I hope you people won't mind, but I am afraid I will have to open up your friend like a sausage with one blow of my clawed heel.This Lortonoi must go. ""Stop!"Lortonoi Jerry commanded, and very much to his own surprise, Troceps stopped."Now, at last, the truth can be revealed.We can control any Fligigieh mind.We just said we couldn't in order to get this great big war going.We arranged that both sides would be so evenly matched that they couldn't destroy each other so that they would have to build bigger and better fleets.They have done this and put together these two fleets.
