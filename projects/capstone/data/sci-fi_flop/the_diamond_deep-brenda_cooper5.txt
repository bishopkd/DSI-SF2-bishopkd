His gut told him he could.A robot deposited two drinks at their table.The orange yellow drink tasted sweeter than Kyles best cookies, and smooth.Like drinking a flower.He made a face at it, which Naveen captured with his ever present camera.Told you.What are you taking pictures for?Im a storyteller and a creator.Its what I do.Your people already have thousands of followers.If you want to stay hot, you need to add new footage all the time.Thats one of the things I will do for you in trade for your stories.Keep you hot.Were already giving our stories to Koren and her people in trade for a place to live.Thats your past.Koren can own that partI dont care.I want the stories of how you and the Diamond Deep come to know each other.I want to watch you meet the people from the station.The drink was giving his voice soft edges.So, who are the thousands?Why are people interested in us?Naveen grinned again, his teeth a bright white and his smile warming his whole face.I have made them interested in you.He shrugged.And you are new.You will be interesting for a while.After all, even though there are over fifteen million people here, it is kind of a boring place.A hard place.At least, for most.But trust me, something else new will come here.By then you will need to have claimed your place.A woman wearing only underwear, a tiny top, and comfortable shoes brought them a plate of breads and fruits.Her eyes were as flashy as Korens, and her hair was purple, blue, green, and gold, shifting color as she moved her head.Wow.She did, in fact, look more exotic than Naveen or Koren.After Onor watched her walk over to a bar, he turned to Naveen to find the camera on him again.The camera stopped him from opening his mouth to ask a question.He sipped his drink and tried to look as cool as possible while he observed the myriad strange looking people and robots either sitting nearby or wandering about together.Naveen waved a hand at him.Thats Lysa.Shes been running this bar for a long time.She came over to get a look at you.Shes tall.Shes pretty, too, huh?Naveen coaxed.Sure.But I like our women.Do you have a mate?A woman from the Fire?Yes.He didnt want to talk about his confusions regarding Marcelle.Or Ruby.Tell me what this food is, and if I can share pictures with my own people?Do you have your slate?Yes.Take a picture.How?Naveen showed him.Oh.He could be recording as much as Naveen.The idea fascinated him.He took pictures of Naveen, and pictures of Lysa when she came back to check on them, and Naveen took pictures of him taking pictures.Onor tried some of the bread, which tasted like nuts and had seeds that stuck in his teeth so he had to pick them out.The fruit tasted like orbfruit, but blander.Hopefully the new food wouldnt make him sick.The next stop did include a drink, a bottle full of something blue that seemed slightly less alcoholic, although somewhere in the back of his brain Onor remembered that theyd pulled the tastes lighter than it is trick on Naveen back on the Fire.Maybe Naveen was trying to get him to talk.At least they didnt sit for long, but instead walked into a compartment full of plants, with air so damp it stuck his hair to his cheek.He took pictures of red flowers as big as his head with a thick, cloying scent that warred with the equally sweet smell of his drink.What part of that do you eat?he asked.Naveen laughed.Its for looks.Nothing on the Fire was for looks.Not even Ruby the Red?Onor laughed, bumping into Naveen on accident but managing not to spill his drink.Dont be obsessed about something youll never have.Sounds like you know about that.Onor took another sip of the drink.Doesnt matter.Wed have come in as slaves without her, or Id be dead.Or shed be dead, or both of us.He fastened his attention on a single tree that stood twice as tall as the biggest orbfruit trees theyd had in the orchard, but was not even half as wide.The leaves were thin needles in at least five shades of green.Can you eat that one?It helps make medicine.Onor tried to capture the actual size of the tree in his next picture.I thought you made everything you need.Simple things.Materials.Clothes.Some substances are better grown than made.Human bodies prefer grown food, for example.The bodies of spaceships are stronger when theyre made with nanotechnology.The Fire wasnt, and thats part of why your return is a miracle.A medium sized space rock could have destroyed your ship.Onor settled for taking three pictures of the tall tree.What is this place?If youre not eating what you grow, what is it for?There are very rich people on the station.Owners of starships, nano programming companies, miners.This was given to us, with enough resources to maintain it.Its a place where some of almost all the wild things from Lym live.Joels words came back to him.Rich means having a lot of credit?Yes.And having a lot of credit means having a lot of power.Yes.So we need to get credit.Isnt that what I told you on the way in?Or you need influence.Ruby can get you influence.Shes already popular.How popular?Naveen grinned.Very.Id say shes the current wonder of the Deep.Onor found his drink glass was empty.Is there plain water somewhere?Sure.Theres a fountain in the next room.Onor was pretty sure he was drunker than Naveen.At least Naveen didnt seem to be slurring his words.Why are you helping me?Because telling your story gives me influence.And so you can get near Ruby.But she can take care of herself.And influence gives you?Power.Damn.Things were never as easy as he needed them to be.He shouldnt have had so much to drink.Water?Naveen led Onor through a door that reminded him of an airlock, with an inner and an outer door, each made of thin metal screens.Inside the set of doors, plants grew in a profusion of colors.A silver cylinder offered water as Onor walked up to it, and he savored the fresh, cool taste and splashed some on his face.He stood up, dripping.Even after all our work in the water purification systems, your water tastes better than ours.Thats because we make it.Oh, right.Water is simple.Onor looked for a towel, Nothing.He dried his face with his sleeve, feeling slightly stupid.Naveen pushed a button and warm air puffed out of the wall.Onor laughed.You know how you can impress Ruby?Id like to.Give her classes.Knowledge.We dont understand your science.And that might be part of the path to power.Learning what the people in the Diamond Deep already knew.I can do that after Koren is finished mining you for history.Cant do it before.That would pollute you.And taking me drinking doesnt pollute me?Onor realized he was having fun, that it was easy to talk to Naveen, that he liked the funny fountain and he loved the trees.He couldnt remember feeling so good.Surely he shouldnt be feeling so good.Showing me flowers and trees doesnt pollute me?Naveen shrugged, grinning, looking as happy as Onor felt.I dont really care if I pollute you, or if I make Koren mad.You want to, dont you?You want to make Koren mad.Thats why Im here.Thats only a little bit of it.I like you.And youre recording this?Some of it.Onor couldnt quite think about whether he should worry or not.Naveen clearly had plans for them.Koren had plans for them.Ruby and Joel were too busy managing day to day stuff and dealing with Koren to make their own plans.He looked deeply into Naveens eyes, noticing again the difference in color, the deep brown that was not natural to anyone from the Fire.Can I trust you?Trust me for what?Im straightforward.I dont hide things.Ill answer any question you have.But if theres one piece of advice I have for you about the Diamond Deep, its be careful who you trust.With that, Naveen opened the door and ushered Onor through.Movement attracted him.He looked up to see a flash of bright orange darting overhead, soon lost in dark green leaves with yellow stripes on them.It had to be a bird.Hed seen pictures of birds.I never thought Id see one.A bird?Yeah.Next thing you know, Ill get to see a sun.Naveen smiled a secretive smile, and then he pointed.Look over there.A blue bird with a tail as long as his arm sat on a thick branch at Onors eye level, its feathers shading to black near the end of the tail and at its wingtips.A maroon circle of feathers marked the breast, with more maroon on the head.Three long feathers stuck out from behind its head and almost touched its back.He had imagined what a real animal might look like.This was more ...It was as alien to him as Aleesi the robot spider girl, but somehow it also felt familiar, and friendly.He found he couldnt say a thing or take a step until the bird flew away.When it did, he discovered tears on his cheeks, and looked up to find Naveen recording them.39     To Ruby, Marcelle still looked more like a fighter than a creche worker.The muscle definition in her legs and back showed through her clothes, a black pants outfit that clung to her thin frame.When she turned to respond to Rubys greeting, she revealed a baby held close to her breast and above her barely swelling tummy.Even the child only stripped a bit of the warrior look from her.How are you?Ruby asked.Tired.Thats because youre pregnant.No.Its because theres so much work.You look the same.I suppose I do.But you should be resting.Theres the baby.Marcelle stroked the infants head.Kids are getting sick.A lot of them.Adults, too.Ruby said.The infirmary reported that ten people checked in this morning.Im setting aside the lower level for sick, moving well people up.We might all get it.The numbers of new cases are falling.Ruby gestured one of her guards close.Can you take the baby back to the creche?She spoke to Marcelle.Lets walk.Marcelle still looked torn, but she kissed the childs cheek and handed it to the guard, which left Chitt and another woman, Samara, to guard them.Well enough.They walked through crowded corridors.I dont want you to work at the creche until this sickness passes.Marcelle reacted with a tightening of her jaw, and by thinning her lips almost to nothing.Her cheekbones stuck out like shelves.I think its the food here thats making us sick, Marcelle commented.The damned squares of tasty color.Or maybe the air.Or the fact that the were all ten pounds lighter with the gravity change.Or the way everything is different.Her voice rose into a light whine that the twelve year old Marcelle might have indulged in.The walls are slick, my clothes feel slick, my hair sticks out.Ruby laughed.My hair does the same thing.Jali has me keep it in a braid now.The tea is from the Fire.Ive been saving some for special occasions.Anything from home would be wonderful.Marcelle leaned close to Ruby and whispered, I hate it here.Ruby wanted to just agree so badly the words almost escaped her lips.We have a lot to learn still.We have no freedom.Im working on that.Were working on that.Joel and I are going out with Koren tomorrow.What about Onor?He went with that Naveen.Shouldnt he be back?Ruby bit her lip.Yes.Maybe.Its too early to worry.But you are worried.Marcelle always knew what she was thinking.Theres nothing for it but tea.Is that what were reduced to?Tea?We used to fight things we didnt like.Dont you want the tea?Of course I do.But Im also going to worry about Onor.Ruby laughed.You used to tell me how much you hated him.Ten minutes and one short stop in a common galley and Ruby had managed to lead Marcelle, frizzy hair and all, into a small alcove that left them nestled by slick walls on two sides.Chitt and Samara stood a respectful distance off, watching outward.I dont think Ive sat down like this for three days, she told Marcelle.Tell me what youve learned about the station?Ruby shook her head.Not much.Im more worried about how many people are sick.Im also worried about what were going to do next.Everyone here is used to working half of every day.Weve had to work to get settled and organized and set up schools for children.We need schools for us.We need Ix or something like Ix back.We need something to make or fix or grow.Already there have been three fights.We have five more people in what passes for lock up now than we brought out of the Fire.Marcelle raised an eyebrow.Is that all?More room.We need more room.Marcelle took a long slow sip of tea and said nothing for a few long minutes.It wasnt like her to be so quiet, so Ruby waited her out, finishing her own tea and wishing shed brought food even though she hated the food squares.We need respect, Marcelle mused.Thats what we fought for.Now weve got nothing.She put a hand on Rubys hand.And sure, we need schools.That helps.But we need more than that.We need a voice.See?I knew I needed to talk to you.This place scares me.Youve never been scared a day in your life, Ruby told her.I wasnt pregnant before.I want you away from the creche.In case whatever is making the children sick can make you sick.I need someone to manage setting up schools.Besides, I want you with me.You have Ani.Which Im grateful for.I have Jali as well.But neither of them know what the world was like for us before.Theyve never had to face the kinds of things Im beginning to think this place might do to us.Were all the equivalent of grays here.Or worse.When she looked over, she noticed a single tear hanging in the edge of Marcelles eye, ready to fall.Ruby lowered her voice.Whats the matter?I thought Id lost you.Never.After she left Marcelle, Ruby stopped by the makeshift bar.Allen stood behind the counter with a rag, cleaning things that looked clean.None of the people who had been his hangers on and his minions from the ship seemed to be around.Hi, Allen.Seen Onor?Allen shook his head.Im not going to see anybody.Theres about eight drinks left, and then were going to be completely out.I dont think the regulars are going to stop by for orbfruit juice.He paused for just a breath, then shrugged his shoulders.Oh yeah, we dont have that either.She laughed.Why dont you find Kyle and see if he can come up with something useful out of this junk for food, and then you can serve that.Great.I can see the menu now.Square orange food.Oblong green sticks.Ruby laughed.Want a drink?One of the last real ones?Yeah.No.I want two.Enough for me and Joel to share a drink tonight.Youre hurting me.He turned.But trade me.You can sing to us if were not drinking, right?If I have time.Make the time.Theres more grumbling than ever.Youve still got enemies, and this is a great opportunity for them.Have you heard anything specific?A bartender never tells.She smiled and leaned in closer to him.Not even me?Nope.He handed her a full flask.Thats sweeter than you like, but youll have to take what you can get.Ill try and come tomorrow night.Ill send Chitt to tell you if I cant.He frowned at her.I cant advertise maybe.She cocked her head at him.And if you could advertise?Where would you put people?Theres no place big enough for a concert here.Or a talk.Or a gathering.Or anything.She hadnt thought of it that way before.Look, Ill come if I can.Will you?Yes, really.But Im not the only person on the ship who can entertain.You could have Planazate conteststhe game takes hours and people will be stuck here even if you do only have water and stupid little squares of food to give them.Theres other singers in the world, too.And storytellers.Get creative.I want my bar back.I want the Fire back.But thats all gone.Well just have to make something better.He gave her a long, lost look.She took her flask and headed toward the small set of rooms she and Joel shared.She was going to spend the rest of the day figuring out what to do next instead of moving every minute.She hadnt really stopped since they got off the Fire, except to fall dead into awkward sleep at the end of each day.She needed a song for the people of the Fire that celebrated who they were, and she needed one that mourned their losses, and she needed to learn enough about the Diamond Deep to sing about that.Maybe Onor had learned something.Damn it, where was Onor anyway?Joel wouldnt be home for hours.In an effort to get their physical conditioning up again, Joel was meeting with The Jackman, Conroy, KJ, and a few of the others to set up a training program.Shed caught KJs dancers scaling walls for fun one morning, but there hadnt been any exercises demanded of lesser mortals since they arrived.She climbed stairs toward the hab they shared in a corner of the top floor.On the second landing, Ruby knelt to admire a bunched group of purple flowers in a pot.Flowers made a promise: they represented at least one new aspect of life which was good here.A few plants had flowered on the Fire, but only to create fruit.Not just to be pretty.Something alive that existed just to be pretty was an excessive use of resource.A symbol for a song?A hand on her shoulder startled her out of her thoughts.Stay down, Chitt said.Why?Ruby hissed.Lya.Ruby stood.Chitt glared at her with a look so furious Ruby almost flinched away from her.Lya stood above them, at the top of the stairs, close to Rubys door.She looked slightly cleaner than when Ruby had last seen her, but no less emaciated.Her eyes had sunk into her head.Only a year older than Ruby, but she looked ten, or more.Other women stood with her, maybe a dozen, maybe one or two more, bunched close together.They all wore white in some fashion: beads, a scarf, a shirt, a strip of material tied around a wrist.Samara stood five steps up, mid way between Lya and Ruby and Chitt.More behind you, Chitt whispered.Ruby glanced down.Women pooled at the bottom of the stairs.Chitt drew her stunner, but Ruby put a hand on her arm, signaling for her to lower it.Hello Lya, she called up.What can I do for you?Listen.The women behind Lya and below Ruby and Chitt murmured the word, whispers and just above whispers.Listen.Lyas face was calm, totally and completely calm.As if she had finally found her niche in life after losing Hugh.Listen.Listen.Listen listen listen.Ruby let the eerie harmony die down.Yes?We demand a voice.We need to be in your councils.Ruby held up her hands to get them to quiet for a moment.Tell me what you need, and I will be sure you get it if I can.A voice.Voice, echoed through the crowd, creepy and irritating as much because it echoed her conversation with Marcelle as because of the strange susurration of so many whispers.Lya.I will do what I can for you.For all of you.What do you want?Youve led us to a place where we have been imprisoned.She couldnt argue with that, so she didnt.She stood there, waiting.Our children are ill.Ruby chewed on her lip to keep herself from saying anything.Yet.You walk around with guards and enough food.You make decisions for us without asking.You are exactly who you told us to fight.That wasnt a new accusation.Even though there was only a grain of truth in it, it stung every time she heard it.Lya continued.But we are non violent.We will not fight you.This is a time for change wrought by attention, not killing and fighting.Good.Although Chitt remained as tense as Ruby.But we will follow you.We will be where you are.We will be outside your doors, outside your meetings, inside your world.We will hear what you say and what decisions you make.We will witness.Witness.Witness.Witness witness witness.Lya looked down on Ruby, standing completely still.The dark circles under her eyes were a black contrast to the white shirt she wore, bookended with a stretchy white hat shed pulled down over her forehead.Ruby took a deep breath.The Diamond Deep is not what any of us expected that coming home would feel like.I also agree that this is not a time for fighting.We would simply die.A people that can create spaces and destroy starships with machines so small we cannot see them surely has a thousand thousand ways to kill us.None of us want to find out what those are.Lya didnt react.The women below said nothing.There were enough of them, and close enough, that their breathing was audible in the spaces between the soft creaks of the station and the footsteps of others going other places.A few people who werent part of the conversation had fetched up against the outer edges of Lyas women, watching.One of them was SueAnne, leaning over and looking down, frowning.Ruby spoke loud enough for all of them to hear.If you want to help us, there are children to care for.There are stories to tell to Korens people so that they can finish wringing us dry and let us get on with our lives.There are old people who need company.Lya smiled.We will witness.We will tell the people of the Fire of all that you do.See that you do good.Before Ruby could respond to Lya, SueAnne said, It is for all of us to hold all of us accountable.And if you choose to follow Ruby everywhere, she will not be able to lead, and I will hold you accountable.You may be setting yourselves up to choose between helping the children and the old, or sitting in jail.Ruby winced.This is not what she would have said, or what she would have had SueAnne say.But then, SueAnne took a fierce pride in being tough, probably from being the only woman with power for so long.Ruby looked into Lyas eyes once more.They remained full of unruffled serenity.We must look to the future and not the past, she said.It is my preference that you help me to do that, that we do that together.She started up the stairs.For a moment she didnt think that Lya would move, but then she slowly stepped aside and allowed Ruby to approach her own door.Chitt and Samara stood beside her as she opened the door, and Lya and her women hissed and whispered, Witness.Witness.Witness.Ruby closed the door.40     Onor opened his eyes.They were crusty and dried.His nose and mouth were parched.His head ached.He fisted his hand and rubbed at his eyelidsslowlyuntil he could see blue above him.Sky?There had been birds.He remembered birds.But there couldnt be sky.He hadnt thought there could be birds, but he was certain there could not be sky.Besides it was too close.It must be paint.Although a faint light seemed to emanate from the whole ceiling.Moving sent pain shooting from his limbs into his head.Naveen.A memory of walking with Naveen, or more accurately, of being helped by Naveen.He managed to wrestle his body to a sitting position.He wore only his underwear and a silky sheet that had tangled around his legs.A couch.That probably explained why he hadnt fallen off.Beside him, a pitcher of water, a glass and his slate.There was a note on his slate.Drink the water and youll feel better.Take a shower.Ive laid out clothes.Ill be back.Please dont leave.A light blue powder filled the bottom of the glass.Onor stared at it, trying to think, which seemed particularly hard at that moment.Hed chosen to trust Naveen.He poured water into the glass and stirred it with his finger.The water was barely tinted blue, and smelled like water always smelled except a touch sweeter.He put his lips to the glass and found himself gulping, almost inhaling, pouring a glass of plain water and finishing that, too.His body reacted almost immediately, membranes softening, vision clearing, the headache disappearing.Hed have to ask about the powder.More of that would be good.Now that he felt human, he looked around.The room had a simple taste and elegance at odds with Naveens way of dressing.Rounded corners softened everything.Bright swatches of textiles accented the grays and off whites that formed the basic color palette.Here and there, plants hung in glass orbs.Naveen had been right that it looked far better than Ash.But then, if this one set of rooms belonged wholly to Naveen, the primary difference might be the amount of space.Shower.Except now his stomach screamed.Onors gait wobbled, but he managed to hit the privy and the shower and pull on the clothes: a pair of thin light blue pants that sparkled around the waistband and the ankles and a light brown shirt thatthankfullydidnt sparkle.The outfit was so soft and light he still felt naked, and so strange and smooth he felt out of sorts and odd.If this was Naveens home, it was more opulent than anything on the Fire.Maybe not more than what hed seen last night.They would have expected him home.The slates had communication capability.One of the wonders of Diamond Deep that hadnt beenquitetrue on the Fire.He picked his slate up and stared at it.There were messages from Ruby, Joel, and Marcelle.He thumbed through the pictures on the slate.He only clearly remembered seeing about two thirds of the things hed taken pictures of.He selected one of a bird and sent it to Ruby with the words, Im okay.He chose a tree for Marcelle with the same message and a picture of the whole aviary complete with trees and the tiny colored forms of birds for Joel.He smiled.That would give them pause.He expected Naveen to show up right away, but he didnt.Onor prowled the space.He tried to send Naveen a note, but he couldnt figure out how to address one to him, nor remember the last name that Koren had given for him.There was a door he hadnt opened.Maybe Naveen was in there.He knocked.No answer.He pushed the door open quietly.Inside, the walls were full of moving pictures.Videos and stills flashed on and off, all silent.Ruby featured in most of them.Some were of her standing beside Joel, some of the last concert in the cargo bar.Some were Joel, some Onor, some the Fire itself.A few featured Koren or her robots talking to people.Onor stood and stared, watching.He noticed a picture of Ruby singing at Owl Paulies funeral.Naveen hadnt taken that.Onor had no access to it, nor Ruby, nor any of them.It had to have come from Ix.41     Ruby was dressed for their trip out with Koren, and waiting for Joel to return from a morning meeting with his councilors.She curled up on a small black couch, one hand holding a glass of what passed for stim here, far enough away from her nose that she didnt need to smell the bitter edge of it.In her other hand, she held her slate.The picture Onor had sent her was quite remarkable.A bird.Ever since she was young, she had been fascinated with images of birds.She had thought they only lived on planets.And here Onor had seen one, and sent her evidence.She took a sip of the stim, glad it didnt taste as bad as it smelled.It seemed harder to wake since they had left the Fire, as if no matter how much she slept it wasnt enough.Perhaps she would see a bird today.The door opened.Joel came in and stood there, looking at her in a way she had recognized meant he felt uncomfortable.There are women outside the door.They chanted at me.Oh.She hadnt quite forgotten them, but she hadnt really expected them to stay.Sorry.They were chanting your name, and something about betrayal.She sighed.They seem to think I dont care about them anymore.He raised an eyebrow, Maybe I should explain how many times you remind me to spend time with them.Maybe you should spend more time with them.He frowned.Will they go away?I hope so.They say theyre going to follow me around until I listen to them.She forced a smile and stood.I heard from Onor.He sent me a picture of a bird.And he sent me a picture of a space bigger than where we live full of trees and birds.Hes going to miss the tour.Ruby frowned.Are you bringing guards?Of course.And SueAnne.Lya was going to have fun with this one.Is it too late to add someone else?Like The Jackman, or Conroy, or Marcelle?In trade for you.No.Then no changes.Koren said up to five total.Thats me, you, SueAnne, KJ, and I was going to bring Onor.You could trade Conroy for Onor.I will choose one of our personal guards.She wondered if the women outside their door had gotten under his skin, or something else.Is Chitt or Samara okay?Well take Dayn.Id like to have someone from gray.Yet you keep telling me there are no more colors, no more levels.That means I can choose whoever best fits the job.The look on his face told her his mind was made up.She forced herself to accept, the compromise acid in her stomach, especially with Lya and the other women outside her door.They were wrong, but Joel was doing everything possible to make them look right.If she rejected Joel and her place here, she would be able to give them nothing.Not that she could bear to leave him.She stood close enough to him to smell his sweat and worry, and to touch his hand with hers.Do you think well see birds?Im more interested in a way forward.Me, too.But a bird would be amazing.He kissed her hair and she sighed, leaning into him.The group of whispering women outside their door was about twenty strong, their murmurs an echoa chorusin her ears.Lya and her women followed behind her, a long line like a weight dragging at Rubys feet.Joel looked stoic but his eyes blazed.This wasnt the moment for a confrontation, not between her and Lya, not between her and Joel.But the pressure for it was there, angry words in all of their eyes.Near the door they had all come in, SueAnne stood waiting for them with KJ.Another level of anger, this time SueAnne looking at Ruby as if she had caused the women to choose this path.KJ simply looked curious.Dayn gave her a look that practically screamed See what youve done now?with a twinkle in eye that suggested he was laughing at the uncomfortable spot the whispering women had backed her into.If she could have stuck her tongue out and maintained any bit of dignity, she might have done just that.Once everyone was there waiting, the women quieted.Their presence cost Ruby and Joel the moments they might have had to prepare the group, to be sure everyone was ready.When the door opened, Koren stood behind it with four of the bright, shape changing robots at her side.Ruby held her breath, willing the women not to try and follow.They didnt, perhaps because KJ stood last in line, perhaps because Korens faceless robotic companions frightened them.Koren offered no more than a polite greeting, leaving Ruby and the others to feel intimidated by the silence and the robots for a full twenty minute walk.The floor under their feet was metallic and smooth, and their shoes whispered as they went, the sound reminding Ruby of Lya and the women in white.She tried to think of the people who supported her, the ones who sat and sang with her in common and joined them around the map table on docking day.They mattered more than twenty or so disaffected women led by a woman who was half crazy.They did.Once they were all settled in a train car that held only them and the four robots, Koren stood at the front of the car.This is a formal occasion.Until today, you have been a people who we studied, who we welcomed back into our fold and attempted to learn about our own history from.But you are not slaves.It is time for you to learn about the Diamond Deep and to begin to explore how you might choose to fit into our society.The train pulled so smoothly away from the station that Ruby couldnt tell how fast it was going.Koren let the train get up to speed and then she said, There are rules here on the Diamond Deep.The most fundamental are that you must own yourselves.You must harm no one.And you must add to the collective.These are the Deeping Rules, and all other rules and customs about how to live here go back to these rules.Society on the Deep is ruled by balanced forces.These are the forces of timehistory and the future.As the Chief Historian, I work to see that we remember the lessons of our past.I am balanced by the Futurist, who looks to what we need to continue to grow.The Architect oversees the constant rebuilding of the stationthe creation of the new and the destruction of the old.The Biologist cares for our food supply and our health.The Economist assures we remain a commercially viable society.He or she manages the Exchanges and the value of goods and services.She paused, looking around until all of them nodded.A slight bitterness edged Korens voice as she continued, Up until now, only one of your people have been allowed to leave your area.Onor.Who had seen birds but who was still gone.But now you will be given leave to travel through other parts of the station and eventually you will all have travel rights everywhere.We will also allow the people of the station to come to you.Yes, you have seen my historians and my staff, but now anyone from the Diamond Deep can travel into your world and meet with you.Ruby raised her hand.Yes, Ruby?Why cant we all travel?Koren smiled the smile that Ruby hated.The one that seemed friendly but condescending all at once.You have limited resources.In order to meet salvage laws, we have granted you ten percent of the value of your ships material and cargo.That is what paid for the homes you are living in, and what pays for the food that you eat and the air that you breathe.We have chosen how to spend that for you, providing you with the simplest and least costly options at every turn.But after today, we will turn over the management of your resources to you.Travel costs credit, and you will want to maintain control over that expense.So we are paying for this trip?SueAnne asked.Koren shook her head.This is a gift to you.So how muchresourcedo you believe we have?Joel asked.She approved of Joels careful wording.This felt like a trap.Credits are exchanged for everything here, and there is a base amount of credit that each being pays to exist according to the resources they use.You pay the daily tax on breathing beings, which is two credits per person per day.Every working person makes far more than that, but since none of you earn credits yet, this is a daily expense.Tomorrow you will be able to work, and tomorrow, you will have to find a way to purchase your own food.That does not answer my question, Joel said.You have credit to survive for about half a year with no one working and a low birth rate, assuming you do not use more resource than you do now.I will send someone to go over accounts with you later.In reality, there are many decisions that influence your resources.Decisions about how to add resources and how to spend them.And if we run out?SueAnne asked.Then there are jobs that we can sign you up for in trade for the minimum required to exist here.If you are unable to work, there are places on the ship where you can live and receive minimal care.Great.Ruby was willing to bet some of the minimal jobs were dangerous and demeaning.42     In spite of how disturbing they were, Onor found himself so entranced by the shifting pictures on the wall in the strange room at Naveens that he didnt hear Naveen came through the door.Good morning.He sounded quite cheerful for someone who could see hed been caught out.Or, almost good afternoon.I didnt plan to stay out all night, Onor said.I know.Im sorry.But I have more to show you today.Not that he looked sorry.I was supposed to be on a tour with Koren.Naveen gave a funny grin, like a child hiding a secret.I know.I thought I should tour you instead.There is a lot to see that she will not show you, and there are things to learn that she will not share with you.Ruby doesnt like her, but why would she mean us harm?Its probably not personal.There is a structure on this station, an order of things.Koren sees you very near the bottom.You have no skills we need, no unique knowledge except for your experiences, which she has already mined.Im pretty sure Koren thinks the best thing youre bringing is your contribution to the gene pool.Huh?You can have babies that will learn how to live here.I dont think she expects you to thrive.You know nothing.That hurt.And you want to help us?You have assets.One of those is Ruby.Another is the rawness of your emotionsand your lives.Koren dismisses that, but it is selling on the interest webs.So we have value because were stupid?Onor kept watching the shifting pictures on the wall.Compared to the diversity of people and looks and ideas and places hed seen so far on the stationand hed hardly seen any of it yetthe Fire did look simple.Because youre a fresh perspective.I can make this work for you.Ive already earned some credit showing Ruby off.The shots I took of the concert on the Fire are selling.Ive saved some of the credit for you.Credit helps you get power?Naveen laughed.More like power buys you credit.Onor frowned.Youll need me to help you navigate the traps this station sets for people.Onor still felt lost.They needed what Naveen was offering.Ill talk to Ruby and Joel.Here, Naveen said, reaching down and swiping across his slate.Heres part of the credit Ive earned from your images so far.When the time is right, show it to Ruby and Joel.The rest will go directly to them after I get to meet with them.Ruby is entitled to a part of whatever I make selling her images.So are youfor your images.Really?Look at your slate.When Onor complied, Naveen showed him how to get access to his credit balance.There was a new number there: two hundred seventy credits.Show that to them, Naveen said.Theyll have context for it after today.Onor slid his slate back into his pocket.Naveen looked quite pleased with himself, as if he had imparted some great gift to Onor.Thank you.Are you hungry?Onor didnt want to leave the room.All of these pictures.I know you took some of them.But others are ours.How did you get them?Naveens grin spread all the way across his face.I hoped you would notice.I have a gift for you.You will need an AI.Most of the civilized groups like yoursthe communitieshave one.When you have enough credit, you can hire your own.Your ships AI is from too old a generation to be independently employable, and you have a right to it.I grabbed a copy before Koren wiped it from the ship.Ive spent the last few weeks attaching it to a communication program that will let you speak to it, and teaching it about the Deep.Onor licked his lips.Ix.How much will it be changed?It should work better.Its not a very smart one, very old.I taught it what I could.You really must save for a new one; but this will be better than nothing.Naveen pulled a drawer that Onor hadnt even noticed out of the wall, and handed Onor a small round object that looked like an oversized ball bearing from the water plants back on the ship.Silvery, but not shiny.Big enough to have weight, and for his palm to cup around.Thats Ix?Thats a copy of Ix for you.You should be able to upload it to your community computer system.Our what?Your life support computer.You must have one.Onor shook his head.I dont know.Naveen sighed.Ill come over and look.Soon.Onor felt both grateful and confused.How much should he trust Naveen?Thank you.Come on, Naveen said.Lets eat.Time is wasting.How long did I sleep?I dont even remember getting here.Perhaps turnabout is fair play.Im glad you enjoyed our alcoholic treats.As soon as we rebuild the bar stock, Ill invite you back.Naveen laughed.By the time they left, Onor was full of bread that melted in his mouth and smelled of herbs and flowers, strange pastes that Naveen had spread onto the breads, and three new fruits.One of the fruits had been green and smelled like sugar.He was still wearing the sparkling pants and the soft brown shirt, and felt entirely unlike himself.The ball of Ix seemed heavy because it mattered so much, even though it was actually so light and small he could barely feel it as he walked.Where are we going?Onor asked.To scare you.Why?This station is layered in dangers, and Im going to show you one of them.Onor tried to make light.Only one?Yesterday, I showed you some of our beauty.That was so you wouldnt despair after today.How ...theatrical.Onor didnt know quite what to say, so he followed quietly.From time to time he stopped to take a picture, or to ask a question.They used a different train than the one they had been on the day before.It took them nearly an hour to get wherever it was that Naveen was taking them.After they disembarked, Naveen said, This is the worst place where normal people like you and me could end up without committing a serious crime.And more importantand you must remember thisits not something is usually talked about.You must not tell Koren we went here.She will know you and I left together, and she will know when you return, and you now have pictures of the aviary and gardens to show for your trip.That is all youll have, and if she asks, that is where you went.She wont be able to tell some other way?The Deeps central systems will knowthey know everythingbut theyre secure.Unless you commit a crime, no one can look into your every move.Onor felt for Ix in his pocket, cupped his hand around it.Our AI treated us about the same on the Fire.Im not surprised.The core of our privacy laws were created long before you left.Just remember, the station wont divulge your moves, but people and robots can follow you illegally if they are willing to take the risk.He grinned.Im seldom followed.Because?Because I caught some of my followers.And?I know how to embarrass people.Onor licked dry lips and wished he had some water.Is this a jail?Not exactly.Naveen led Onor to a window in a wall.This is the Brawl.The smoky window glass distorted Onors view, giving the scene on the other side an unreal quality, like watching the map table on the Fire.It showed a vast, flat place full of people.The crowding was far worse than where Onor and the rest of the refugees from the Fire were now.Rows and rows of cots filled the floor and served as chairs, beds, and storage.Robotic posts moved among the people.What are the robots?Onor asked.Enforcers.If you watch long enough, youll see one of them hurt someone.Or maybe youll see a crazy attack one and get killed on purpose.Were too far above it to really see the details, but these people live on almost nothing and a few die each day.They have air and food and water sufficient to live, but little else.Slates, I think.For entertainment.Onor tried to notice details.They were so far above the crowd that facial expressions were impossible to see, and of course, they could not hear any sounds through the glass.But body language spoke volumes.Protective.Confrontational.Worried.Exhausted.There are no children.Children have not failed yet.You have to be at least a teenager to be sent here, but practically, it doesnt happen.Because there are almost no children here at all.Sure there are.Not like they had on the Fire.They watched for at least fifteen minutes while nothing dramatic happened below them.People moved in and out of groups, and good and bad confrontations happened.Hugs and words were exchanged, and enforcers served food from a corner.Why robots?Why do robots watch them?Because it would turn humans cruel to do that job.Like the reds back on the Fire.A fight broke out below them.When it first caught his eye it was four people in a knot of arms and legs, a silent and strange dance to watch.Others surrounded the fighters, keeping some distance.Onor had seen this, even on the Fire, the way people will circle a fight and then clap.Except there it had been children, maybe teenagers.These were adults.Watch for an enforcer, Naveen whispered, pointing.There.Onor squinted, looking for the enforcer through the thick window.And there.I see it.Soon, people were stepping back from three of the cylindrical robots, tripping in haste.Something happened that Onor couldnt see and the combatants fell into a pile of unmoving flesh.A woman fell as well, but she rolled and then crawled away, struggling to reach the crowd which stepped ever further from both her and the enforcers.One of the enforcers came close to her, and she turned on her back and was still, eyes fastened on the robot.She threw her arms out at her side, a gesture of surrender.The crowd stopped at what must be safe distancemaybe four times Onors heightwatching.A conversation occurred between the woman and the silver post.Even though he couldnt see her features clearly, he rooted for her, chewed his lip, held his breath.She must feel like he had when the spiders were chasing him, like a small piece of meat in the sights of a more powerful being.He let out a sigh of relief when she stood and backed into the watching crowd, disappearing in the mass of people.The fighters.His hands were clenched on the sill, and he released them.Were they stunned?Naveens voice had none of his usual mischievous edge.That depends on what they have done before.The enforcers are not allowed to kill in most circumstances.But life down there often does not last long.Onors eyes flicked over the bodies below them.He could see ...Thousands.It had to be thousands.How many people live on the Deep?Millions.Naveen closed his eyes for a second, seemed to flit away.Forty seven million, three hundred and twenty one thousand, and change.Its never more exact than that with ships going in and out all of the time.Onor stared down below.Theres more of these than this, then.Yes.And I needed to see this so Id know how bad it can be here?Your circumstances were designed to force you into the Brawl.You should know what fate awaits you if you dont accept my offer of help, or find another way to earn a lot of credit.For the first time since Marcelle had told him she carried his child, Onor felt afraid for the baby.He pulled his hands away from the windowsill to hide the fact that they were shaking.43     Koren had stopped talking and looked forward, still and regal.Not a single white hair was out of place.Wherever they were going, they had been on the train long enough for Ruby to feel a need to stand, to walk, maybe to run.She resisted.Beside her, Joel was stiff and angry, and everyone in their group had grown quiet.Probably thinking, like Ruby, about the way things were here.They had all been born expecting to work, knowing their place.But even in the old striated society of colored uniforms where the reds like Ben used stunners and power to control the grays like Ruby, they always knew the general shape of their lives, and they knew that if they survived they would be fed and cared for.Four out of five people on the Fire died of old age, which did not seem to exist here.Now she felt unmoored, lost in a sea of new rules and new ideas and new demands.Her mind catalogued a flood of questions and spun across new worries.When the power structures of the Fire changed, some people had died, most had adapted, some had thrived.They would have to adapt again.And some, like Lya and her whispering women, had chosen to be left behind.In a way, Lya had refused to change as much as Sylva.Ruby would never have done what Joel did to Sylva; but she would have killed her in a fair fight.She put a hand on Joels thigh, briefly, as unseen as possible, a reminder that she loved him.A reminder that he was warm and alive and vital.The train slowed so smoothly Ruby barely realized they were stopping.Koren stepped off the train and waited for the others to disembark, watching them with her golden eyes, showing very little emotion.She looked like she was discharging an onerous duty, already bored, already about to move on.Welcome to Exchange Five.This is where you can bargain for work.You will stay close to your guide.He will show you people from starships looking for crew, people from mining concerns looking for people to work for them, employers who need cargo moved or counted.Your slates have been sent directions about how to get here and how to get home.A young manno, Ruby corrected herself, a man of indeterminate age who looked as young as Korencame up to them and Koren turned a dazzling smile on him.This is Lake.He is a guide who helps newcomers to the Diamond Deep navigate the Exchange.We have paid him to spend a few hours with you, and to then make sure that you arrive home safely.I wish you luck on our world.Wow.A dismissal.A complete dismissal.Koren might as well as have said, I have everything I need from you and you werent, actually, that interesting.Im going to go do more important things that fit my station.Well, good riddance.Ruby hadnt liked the woman from the moment she set eyes on her.Bright colors clung to Lakes body, yellows and oranges with streaks of red.His hair was impossibly orange, a color she had never seen anywhere, and it hung down his back in a long ponytail.Ruby felt drab next to him, and swore she would bring Jali next time she came here.They gave Lake their names.He hesitated when SueAnne introduced herself, as if her appearance bothered him.Maybe the wrinkles and age spots and graying hair, or the shape of the old womans body: blocky and waistless with thin shoulders.Lakes voice was silky and easy to listen to, full of confidence.I understand you are new to the Diamond Deep.Welcome to the station and to Exchange Five.The most common goods and services all flow through the exchange, as do most requests for work.This area closest to the station is where the paymastersthe people who will be able to hire youcome every morning.It is a chaos in the early morning.An hour ago there were hundreds of people here.The best jobs go quickly.What kind of jobs?SueAnne asked.Anything.Sorting and cataloguing incoming goods for buyers, loading and unloading cargo, working booths at food exchanges, repairs of all kinds, sometimes caring for people.He glanced at SueAnne.Most of the work exchanged here is physical, usually a few days worth of credits for a day of work.Ruby frowned.The grays would do all right, or at least the young ones.Why use people instead of robots for carrying?Lake smiled at her.We use both.Robots are more expensive, and make bigger mistakes.The Economist structures a certain amount of work for humans.So it depends on the job.Exchange Five throbbed with light and sang with a cacophony of sound.All of this mixed in a single wide open space, a big box of a room with high metal walls and a metal ceiling, and an assault of words written on signs and in light almost everywhere.People in booths called to people outside of them.Here and there, humanoid robots played either role: seller or buyer.Other booths sold food and drinks.Color bloomed everywhere, although on closer examination the clothes werent as rich as Korens or even Naveens.Most of the robots were less smooth or unblemished than the assistants Koren had brought with her.KJ broke his long silence.How many people look for work each day, and how many find it?Lake looked down for a moment, as if uncomfortable.There is work for a little less than half.Ruby wondered if a little less than half meant a quarter.And the other half?If they are lucky, they get work on a different day.Not all work comes through here, Joel observed.Where would a trainer or a fighter or a singer go for work?Professional work happens on the boards.You can access those via your slates.But those jobs need certificates and approvals.SueAnne frowned.So how do we get those?With credit.Ruby asked, Does credit rule everyones lives?Lake laughed.You must have it.But whether or not it rules your life is up to you.So what can we acquire here?Almost anything.Things to wear, delicacies from other lands or gardens to grace your table, medicine to help you feel better, skills to give you access to new jobs, a moment of live entertainment or a copy of a song to play over and over.You can buy a program to create new things, a larger place to live, pretty shoes for your pretty little feet.He gave her a little bow.You are a beautiful redheaded woman.What could you possibly need that the Diamond Deep cannot provide?Ask, and I will try to show you.A short silence fell on the group from the Fire and they looked from one to another before Ruby looked back at Lake.Food and sustenance for thousands.He blinked at her, as if counting.A beat of silence passed before he said, Easy enough to order.Ill show you.Joel added, Physical training.Lake nodded.Of course.He looked around.Is there one more thing?They all looked around, and SueAnne whispered to Joel.Lake smiled.We should begin to tour.But you have still not told me what third thing you want to acquire today.He looked right at Ruby.Bits of the colored materials you used in your clothes.All right, then.Weve talked enough.Allow me to show you the wonders of Exchange Five.They followed Lake into the swirling movement of commerce.Dayn and KJ walked side by side at the end and watched all of them.Joel let SueAnne lean on his arm so that she could keep up.44     When they finally passed through the doorway to home, Ruby could barely walk and her stomach felt slightly nauseous from the assault of the new.Colors she had never seen before, scents she hadnt known existed, people with hair and skin and eyes of all colors.Shed seen a man with metal legs.Beside her, SueAnne sat in a wheeled chair that moved by itself.Her gray hair lay flat against her face, and her lips were drawn thin with pain.Before theyd made it even half way through Exchange Five, she had begun to falter so much that Joels arm wasnt enough.Dayn had taken her other side, but in spite of the extra support, they had slowed so that people stepped around them.Lake had ordered up a robot chair for her and showed her how to give it basic instructions.Then he had helped them buy one.Their first purchase aboard the Diamond Deep.The whispering women waited for them at the door.Lya stood in front of her, blocking the way.Tell us what you saw.It was all Ruby could do not to snap at her.Tomorrow.Were tired.Well share everything we learned tomorrow.In the meantime, can you find it in your hearts to help SueAnne get back to her place?Lya stopped moving as if Rubys tone of voice had been a command to become a piece of art.Please?Ruby said.The chair probably cant do stairs.I really dont know.Lya blinked.One of the three women with Lya nodded and tugged on Lyas sleeve until Lya nodded as well.The five of them left, the four women and SueAnne heading silently away.I think you should keep them busy all the time, Joel observed.Ruby shook her head softly, bemused.At this point, Ill try anything except violence.A shadowed figure sat by the door.For a moment she thought it might be Onor, but when he stood up she noticed the slighter form.Haric, what are you doing here?Do you have a message for us?He shook his head.I just wanted to know if you were all right.The earnest look on her face touched her.She gave him a long, soft hug.Were fine, and thank you.She smoothed back his hair.How are you?Im scared, he said.And Im bored.Shed thought she was too tired to laugh but she wasnt.And were very tired.Well talk about it tomorrow.Could you pass on a message for me?Could you ask Jali to meet me in the morning?Tell her Ive got work for her.He looked pleased and left quickly, as if he had wanted something to do more than anything in the world.As soon as they were inside, she took a long drink of water and flopped onto the bed.Joel was more disciplined about getting to the same place, and soon they were right next to each other, breathing softly.Ruby couldnt recall being so drained since the days of fighting.Her head spun as hard as her feet throbbed.Joel lay beside her on the bed, staring at the ceiling.She reached deep inside herself for a scrap of energy and managed to roll over closer to him and touch his cheek.I didnt see any children.Not one.She left her fingers on his jaw so she felt him say, I think I saw one being carried.A babe in arms.Well ask Onor.Has he come home?I think he would have met us, Joel said Or passed out from exhaustion.In the old days I could have asked Ix.I know.She stretched, fighting to find a few more minutes of awareness for conversation.It had been a long day, but she still felt mystified by her exhaustion.I didnt see anyone that looked old, either.I want to know how they do that.Its unsettling.Im amazed we got SueAnne home.She had so much to think about now.We need to assign someone to keep track of these credits, maybe a few people.So one can watch the other.The Fire was so much easier, he murmured.We had to work to live, but everyone was fed.Thats not so different than it is here.Joel rolled to face her, stroked her hair.But we were all always together.Even when the levels were closed off and I didnt know you existed, we were all necessary.Were all going to be necessary here.He paused for a moment, and then asked, How are we going to care for people like SueAnne?How can she earn credit?People will have to pool the credit they earn, I guess.He touched her cheek, ran a finger along her lips.How will we make them?This is not a closed space where they must accept a leader.Or leaders.Or leaders.Ruby had closed her eyes, but nevertheless she heard his soft laughter in his voice.She whispered, Were going to have to be so strong, so smart.Koren is no friend, and Naveen may not be either.We may not have any friends here.We have each other.45     By the time they made it into the meeting room theyd chosen, Joel was seething.If you dont do something about those women, I will.The room was still empty, although someone had already been here brewing stim, the scent of it filling the air and giving Ruby a boost.She put a hand on Joels arm, felt the tight set of his muscles.I will take care of this.Its only been two days since they started it.Im thinking.Dont think too long.Maybe love was always infuriating.She had learned that taking him on directly seldom worked.Not that she was happy about the women; they bothered her on a deep note.But she spoke quietly and calmly.Lya was my friend once.He only softened a bit.If you allow yourself to feel guilty about Hugh forever, he will haunt you.Save your guilt for those you actually kill.What a happy thought.The door opened and Haric came in with three cups in each hand.Ruby smiled at him.Six?Arent we only expecting Onor and KJ?Haric grinned at her.And me.Thats still only five.Haric simply smiled and continued to look full of a secret.He poured three cups, and the three of them sat down at the table.What happened here yesterday?Joel asked.Theres five more children that came up sick, but one of the first ones who got sick looks better.Marcelles really worried about another one, though.Ruby frowned.Theyre all quarantined?And you feel okay?she asked Haric.I was sick one day.But Im better now.He looked more closely at her.You look tired.Are you okay?I am tired.We were out a long time yesterday.I cant tell you how much there was to see.I wish I could have gone with you.He was so earnest.I know.I have a feeling well all get to see more of the station soon.The door opened again, admitting Onor and Naveen.Youre the sixth, Ruby said in greeting.Huh?Never mind.Good to see you.Haric will pour you some stim.They shared stories from each others trips while they finished the first round of stim.Onors description of the Brawl fascinated and frightened Ruby.Although it was Onor who had relayed the story of seeing the Brawl, Ruby turned to Naveen.How do people end up in the Brawl?Naveen looked down at the table.They cant support themselves, even at a basic level, and no one speaks for them.How can you be so cruel?Ruby demanded.How can we not?Naveen raised his head.A space station is an enclosed system with limited resources.You have enough resources to feed your hungry, Ruby snapped.No one starved on the Fire.No one.When we had a shortage, we all went on reduced rations.The whole idea turned her stomach.I was there.In Exchange Five.There are enough resources there to feed thousands, clothe thousands.Naveen looked like he was hanging on her every word.She felt like hed baited her into feeling this way, but surely he hadnt created the Brawl.Hed just made sure she knew about it.I see, he said, why they call you Ruby the Red.Are there people here who hate the Brawl?Of course.Many.Naveen shrugged.But there is something like it on every station.It creates discipline.Something about his tone of voice alerted her.Are you recording this?I record almost everything.She went silent.He was helpful.Had been helpful.He had also known she would hate anything like the Brawl; like Koren, he had their history.I want to see the Brawl for myself.Ill take you, Naveen said.Onor frowned.Joel put a protective hand on Rubys hand.I would like to go, too.Can you take the both of us?It will cost credit.Did it cost credit to take me?Onor asked.I paid it, Naveen said.And if I have to, I can pay to treat Ruby.He hesitated a moment.And Joel.Well pay, Joel said.Ruby glanced at Haric.Can you find some kind of bread?I need to calm my stomach.Im sure theres a colored square somewhere called bread.Such irony from a child.Onor glanced at Naveen.Can you show him how to order some real food?Naveen laughed.Spoiled you, did I?Sure.And breakfast is on me.Haric looked downright perky as they headed for the door.What kind of real food?I heard you saw a bird.He was still talking as the door closed behind him.I dont like him recording you, Joel told her.Im sure he recorded you, too.Were being used.Something dawned for her.Weve always been used.We were somebodys slaves on the Fire.Probably no one from here, although everyone will use us if we let them.Naveen.Koren.Even Lake.We will have to be careful about who we allow to use us, and be sure we get fair value in return.Onor leaned back and bit at his lip.Thats cynical.Is it wrong?He shook his head.Wed better get smart, fast.She was seething, but she couldnt afford that.She had to think.Do you trust him?Youve spent time with him.She could see Onor consider, knew how his teeth worried his top lip when he was under real pressure.Yes.As much as I trust anyone I didnt grow up with or fight beside.I think he can help us.If were careful.Naveen taught you about credit?Joel asked.He gave us some.For your songs.Hes selling them and he gave us a cut.Ruby leaned forward.If he can sell them, cant we sell them?To who?He knows everybody.We dont.How much credit?Joel asked.Two hundred seventy credits.Ruby leaned back in her chair.Thats life for one hundred and thirty five people for one day.Both a lot and not a lot.How many songs did he sell?I dont know.Ruby got up and rinsed out cups, thinking as she moved.Was the Brawl the most awful place youve ever seen?Yes.We dont, ever, any of us, want to end up there.Ruby brooded while Joel questioned Onor about the number of people in the Brawl (more than he could count) and the number of enforcer robots (maybe one for every hundred people) and about the route Onor had taken to get there.Haric and Naveen came back in with soft bread and fruits Ruby had never seen.Try the green one, Onor said.Its sweet.After I settle the stim a little.She reached for a piece of bread, and even that smelled sweeter than she wanted.It tasted good, and helped her back off the fight in her stomach.She needed energy.Well see that we dont ever end up in the Brawl.Any of us.Thats not going to be easy, Joel said.I did the math.We have five thousand seven hundred and thirty five people.Naveens eyes widened at the number, although he didnt say anything.It takes two credits a day for survival.Per person.Old or young.I dont know what it takes to live a decent life, but for the sake of argument lets say we need four credits a person and a few extra, so multiply six thousand by four.Thats twenty four thousand credits a day.But a lot of people to earn them, Haric said.Most of us can work.Ruby shook her head.Deduct the children, and the people we need to raise them.And the old.And the sick.And the people we need to care for them.How many children do you have?Joel answered.Between what ages?How old do you need to be to work here?Sixteen.About half of us are women, Joel mused, and maybe one in ten women has a child, so thats about three hundred.Wow, Naveen said.I didnt see any at the Exchange, Ruby commented.We seldom create children on the station.They visit.The miners tend to have them.Joel held up a hand.Dont get sidetracked.Estimate.Four thousand can probably work.But they wont all be able to, Ruby pointed out.Or at least, not everyone finds work every day.Lake said some days there is hardly any.The whole thing was beginning to sound worse than hard.Naveen interrupted.Not everyone can find work at manual labor.There are other ways to earn credits.Onor looked at Naveen.I told them about selling Rubys songs.Naveen sat up straight and looked serious.I want to help you.Why?Joel still sounded stiff about the idea.Whats in it for you?Naveen offered a small, genuine smile.I, too, need to stay out of the Brawl, and better, to have the credit to live where I live.Its a nice place.I make credits telling people about things, and you are a unique new thing that will interest the station.Particularly Ruby.Joel was still frowning.Well consider your offer.What can the rest of us do?Ruby had a sudden image of Joel shifting boxes of cargo from place to place.He was a fighter and a military leader.Naveen pulled a flask of some kind from his belt and drank from it.She couldnt smell it, couldnt tell if it was still or stim or maybe even just water.You need a structure.One set of people need to go look for work.Exchange Five is as good a place as any, and its where Koren will expect you to be since she showed it to you.Another group needs to focus on learning.What should we learn?Ruby said.I want to see the birds.Is everything else between the Exchange and the Brawl?I mean, is that the best and the worst of it?Naveen paused a moment before answering her.Thats middling badthe Exchangeand the Brawl is the worst thing except maybe the jail.There a lot of the Deep that regular people dont know about, that we barely glimpse.Some is bad, but most of it is riches beyond our imagination.Whole areas being hidden from her.Hardly a surprise.She knew there were people watching her though Naveens camera.Right now.This very moment.She forced herself to curb her tongue.All of her life, people had been trying to hide riches from her.Or worse, to show her the bottom of a world and claim it was the top.46     Onor felt uncomfortable at Joels reticent response to Naveens offer to sell Rubys songs.But he had something good that had come from Naveen.He pulled the dull silver colored ball that held Ix out of his pocket and put it on the table.Rubys face grew curious.She picked it up and stared at it, turning it around and around, holding it up and squinting at it.Naveen watched Ruby.He looked expectant.It is a copy of Ix.It still holds your history.Rubys eyes narrowed and she held the object up higher.Really?This is Ix?Naveen said, Ix is stored in the ball at the moment.It isnt anything physical; it does need a physical home.Koren gave it to you?Joel asked.No.A beat of silence passed.When Naveen offered nothing else, Joel pressed him further.Will we get into trouble for having it?By law, it is yours.Ruby asked, So why didnt Koren let us have it in the first place?Naveen grinned.Perhaps she forgot your rights.I doubt it is in her best interest for you to succeed.Joels eyes narrowed.What do you mean?Nothing I can prove easily.But what was your cargo worth, and did you really get 10 percent of the salvage?Why didnt we get it all?Ruby looked irritated, but then shed looked irritated ever since they were forced off the ship.Well, the crew isnt the owner of a ship.Not usually.On the little miners and the family ships, and sometimes of ships meant to get around the Deep.But not on the big cargo liners.Salvage rights can be called on any ship that is drifting and cannot be fixed.Its old rules, started way back on Lym around sailing ships.The Fire did work!Ruby exclaimed.Onor didnt call her on her near lie.Joel just sat with his face stoic, but he was clearly thinking hard.And you could prove that now?Naveen asked mildly.Maybe with Ix?Ruby still held the ball of Ix in her hand.Does it know?Naveen shook his head.I looked.Ix does have all of the maintenance records, but that alone doesnt exactly support your case.The Fire was never designed for in system travel.The best you could have done was park it in an orbit.As soon as you stopped in the system, the Fire was effectively derelict.You may be lucky you landed here instead of being boarded by pirates.Joel gave a bitter laugh.We were boarded by pirates at the Edge.Surely you saw that.Naveen looked thoughtful.Ruby put the ball with Ix in it down on the table, propped on a napkin so it couldnt roll off.She glared at it.How do we use that?Ix was as big as the ship.Naveen lost his smile.Ive looked.When Koren built this place, she didnt put a design spec in for an AI habitat.Well have to acquire one.Which will cost credit, Joel said.Yes.What is an AI habitat?Well, not that ball.You might think of that as a place where Ix is sleeping, waiting for a home complex enough for it.Onor and I poked around this morning.You do have a communications network here, and a standard base operating system, but an AI needs a certain speed and range of processing power.Getting Ix to work mattered.What would it cost to get one?A third of what you have.Rubys face fell.She would never do that, not now while there was so much they didnt know, and children and old people to feed.She licked her lips and twisted her hair in her fingers.It wouldnt really help us anyway, would it?It doesnt know the station.It cant.Naveen said, It does.I taught it a few things before I compressed and copied it.It knows how to access the stations maps and schedule.Could you use the spiders webling?Joel asked.Ruby gave him a Dont talk about that look, which Joel ignored.Is your camera off?Ruby asked Naveen.Yes, Naveen said.I know your history.The law Aleesi is scared of is real.Its still enforced, and if she gets caught existing she will be destroyed.Onor felt startled.I thought you couldnt kill beings.Thats what the Brawl is all about, right?You cant kill, so you lock people up and let them kill each other?Naveen looked offended.The Brawl isnt that simple.And the stationmasters can kill illegal beings.Aleesi is illegal.She doesnt seem that different than Korens robots, Ruby said.Didnt you meet her as a pirate?Naveen reached for more stim.Its like the salvage laws.Old stuff.At one point, early in the days of AI and before the sundering, soldiers were captured and their brains scanned into robots and turned against their own people.It kills a human to do thisto take the essence of them and pour it into metal.The story is more complex than that, but the law is old and stable.He sighed.And probably good.From your conversations with Aleesi, she was a slave.But why not kill the people who made her, instead of her?Ruby objected.Because hybrids had to be outlawed to stop the business.Onor held his tongue.He could still see Colin being ripped in pieces.He watched Ruby carefully.She didnt respond right away, and her face looked set and worried.What do you suggest?
