Then Lona and Whitey came up to the table, she flushed and glowing, he smiling, grinning, and Dar felt very foolish.Sit, sit!Whitey waved him into his chair.And thousands of thanks, youngling.Thats the greatest praise a singer can getthat you forget yourself in the music.Lona didnt say anything, but she answered with a look that set Dars blood thrilling through him and gave his teeth a tingle.Then the waiter broke the spell by plunking glasses down in front of the singers.I can believe it!Sam exploded.I couldnt believe such a distinguished poet would be playing in tavernsbut Ive heard you!I believe it!WellIm glad to know Im still myself, Whitey said, with a twinkle in his eye.And a poet I ambut distinguished I most emphatically am not!Dont let him bother you, Lona assured Sam.You couldnt have known it was an insult.But whatre you doing, playing in a backwater bar on a boondock planet?Looking for a clean breath of air.Whiteys mouth tightened a little.The bars on Terra, now, theyre so damn polite you cant get away with anything but poetry, and that takes all the fun out of it.Also, they dont really listenthey just want you for background while they try to make time with each other.And say a word about politics, and wham!youre out the door!Theyve gone effete, theyve gone gloomy, theyve gone hopeless, and the finest songs in the world wont cheer em!Things get better as you go away from Solbut even here, though theres some life, theyve lost the sense of joy and wonder.They want to just sit back behind thick walls and taste fat meat, and they dont want to hear about hunting dragons.Its true enough, Lona agreed, but youre not so young any more, Grandfather.Thats so.Whitey nodded.Thats why I need to seek for life and freshness.But I am fresh, Lona pointed out, and fully alive, and no doubt of it!Just give me a try at being decadent, Grandfatherjust give me a little try!Whitey sighed, and started to answer, but a huge slab of lard interrupted him, six feet four in height and three feet wide, four feet at the waist, with little, squinting, piggy eyes and an outhrust jaw.Whatsa matter, singer?Dont like progress?Whiteys eyes kindled.Progress?Just because you get more goods doesnt mean your souls better!So, who are you, my father confessor?The thickened thug grabbed Whiteys shirtfront and yanked him out of his chair.Disgusting little bastard!First talking politics, and now religion!Why, I oughta paste you up on the wall.Go ahead, Whitey caroled, try!The thug stared at him for a moment; then his eyes narrowed, and he wound up for a pitch with a snarl.Whitey chopped down on his elbow, hard.The beefy one dropped him with a howl, and two more slabs of meat waded in, reaching for Whitey.Someone yanked Dar out of his chair and flipped him around with a fist to his jaw.He slammed back against the tabletop and sat up, blinking, the roar of a full scale brawl coming faintly through the ringing in his ears.Most of the patrons were squealing and clearing back against the walls, looking for an exit.A knot of thugs kept trying to form around Whitey, but Father Marco kept roaring in, yanking them out of the way by their collars and bumping them away with his back when they tried to swing back in.The ones who did get in kept popping back as Whitey caught them with undercuts.Sam and Lona fought back to back, with clips to the chin, and kicks to the shin.So far, theyd yielded a lot of hoppers.Then Dar saw the glint of steel swinging up at Sams belly.He shouted and leaped forward, lurching in between Sam and her attacker.The blade slid along his side, opening the skin; he bleated in pain and anger, and pivoted to face the slice artist.He was tall and fat, with a gloating grin.Youll do just as well.The knife snaked out at his liver.Dar swung to the side, grabbing the mans wrist, cradling the elbow on top of his own, and snapping down.The thug yelled, high and hoarsely; his hand opened, and the knife fell out.Then a grenade exploded on the back of Dars neck.He lifted his head, blinking blearily, and got a great view of feet kicking and lunging all around him.Through the singing in his ears, he heard the hoot of police horns.About time!Then it occurred to him that the tangling feet all around him might think he was part of the floor.He stumbled to his feet, and looked up into a breast patch that said Police.He looked on up to a grinning face underneath a helmet, and noticed an electroclub swinging down at him.He spun away, to find a stun gun level with his chest, with another police patch behind it.He yelled and leaped to the side just as the club came crashing down and the stun gun fired.The one cop was shocked, the other was stunned, and a third caught Dar around the middle.Dar slammed a fist downright on a helmet.The cop dropped him and leveled a stun gun.Then the cop dropped, period, and Father Marco grabbed Dars arm and yanked him over the scrambling uniform.Follow me!Fast!He turned away, and Dar stumbled after him.He bumped into Sam, coming up on his right, and caromed off Whitey on his left.Father Marco yanked open a door, and Lona darted through ahead of them.Follow her!the priest snapped.Well, it went along with Dars natural inclinations; he just wished he hadnt had so much company.He clattered down a set of narrow steps, following Lonas slim form, and came out in a cellar surrounded by shelves of kegs and racks of bottles.The door slammed behind him, and the noise of the fight diminished to a far off rumble.Quick!It wont take them but a few minutes to think of the cellar!Father Marco brushed past them, fumbled at a bolthead in the paneled wall, and swung open a hidden door.Lona darted through, and Dar followed.Father Marco slammed the door behind Whitey, and Dar found himself suddenly in total darkness.Something soft and curved brushed against him.Lona sprang to his minds eye, and he wished she hadnt brushed away so quickly.Dar?Sam whispered, right next to him, and he fairly jumped.Yeah, right here, he whispered back through a whirl of emotions.Shed sounded shy and unsure of herselffeminine.It roused every protective reflex he hadand a full flood of hormones behind them.And the touch of her   Where are we?she whispered.I dont know, he answered.Why are we whispering?Then a spot of light glared.They turned to see Father Marcos face, illuminated from below by a tiny glow globe in the handle of his miniature screwdriver.The reflex is correct," he said in a very low tone.Keep your voices down; I dont think the police know about this bolthole, but they might search the tavern basement, and we dont want them to get curious.Perish the thought!Whitey agreed.Where are we, Father?In a, you should pardon the phrase, priest hole?No, the persecutions on this planet have never been religiously oriented.Father Marco grinned.Were in the basement of the establishment next door.Which oneLeong Chakovs Foot Laundry?No, the other one.Oh, Madame Tessies Tenderloin Chop House.Whitey raised his eyebrows, nodding.Pretty good, Father.Even I didnt know there was any, ah, connection, between the two establishments.The priest nodded.Only a few select patrons know.Youre one of them?Welllets just say its surprising what you pick up in moments of confidence.Father Marco turned away, groping along the wall.Oh.Whitey fell in beside him.You picked it up in the confessional.No, because of it.They had something of an emergency here last month, calling for the Last Rites and all possible discretion.There was a loud clunk, and the light bobbed.Father Marco hissed something under his breath.Dar wondered why blue should be sacred.I think Ive found the stairs.Father Marcos voice was strained.Slowly and quietly, now.The light began to bob upward.The net result is, the ladies here have come to trust me.I think theyll be discreet about our passage through their quarters.His light shone on a richly grained door.Quietly, now, he murmured, and turned the knob.Laughter and raucous music assaulted their ears.They stepped out into the middle of a party for the usual assortment of portly patrons and what had to be the only slender inhabitants of Falstaff.The svelte shapeliness was real, too, obviouslysince they were wearing as little as possible.Must be later than I thought, Sam observed.No, its always like this, Father Marco answered.Come now, lets see if we cant find a quiet place to meditate.Personally, Dar had all he wanted to meditate on right there; but Father Marco was slipping quietly along the wall toward the stairway, and Whitey was pushing from behind, so he followed suit.Marco!The priest turned just as a bosomy beldam smacked into him, lips first.She leaned back, holding him by the shoulders and laughing.You old scoundrel, what brings you here?Interested in our services, for a change?In a way, Tessie, in a way.Father Marco gave the madam an affectionate squeezeon the hand.Just looking for a place to relax and chat with a few friends, where theres a little less noise than the average tavern.Tessie sighed and shook her head.What a waste of a good man!And here I was getting my hopes up.I really ought to be angry with you, yknow.She gave him a coquettish flicker of eyelashes.Because of Rosamund, eh?Father Marco spread his arms.Theres no help for it, Tessie.I have to do my job, even as you have to do yours.Yes, and usually its all well and goodthe girls get remorseful for a few days, and when they get back to work, theyve got a certain freshness about them.But getting one of them to kick the trade completely?Now, dont you think thats going a bit too far?She emphasized the point with a few strokes on his arm.Father Marco gently disengaged her hand.No, from my point of few, its just enough.Where is she now, do you know?Tessie shrugged.Hopped an outbound liner, thats all I can say.None of us are natives, Father.Father?Its Father Marco!In a second, they were surrounded by a bevy of shapely no longer maidens with very long fingers.Dar thought of checking his wallet, but he was having too much fun being frisked.The hands were all over the priest, coming on faster than he could take them off.Oh, Father, Im so glad to see you!Have I got a lot to tell you!Oh, Father, its so horrible.I tried and I tried to resist, but   Yes, girls, I understand.Patience, patience; if I cant talk with each of you today, Ill come back another time.You arent a priests apprentice, are you?A beautiful redhead straightened Dars tunic with a lingering touch.Well, no, not really.I am interested in virtue, though.So am I, she cooed, its such a wonderful conversation topic.Dar felt a stroke along his buttocks, and just barely managed to keep from jumping.A blond head poked over his shoulder and murmured, Any friend of Fathers is a friend of mine.Well, I am the friendly type  There were at least five of them, all very good with innuendo, verbal and otherwise.It wouldve been great if theyd come one at a time; as it was, Dar was beginning to feel a little like a pound of ground sirloin at a hamburger sale.Not that he was complaining   A rippling chord filled the room.Everyone looked up, startled.Ladies and gentlemen!Whitey was standing on a chair, with Lona beside him, perched on a table.For your entertainment and delectationthe Ballad of Greshams Law!An incredulous mutter ran through the roomespecially from the zoftig patrons, who were all in the bracket that knows some economics.The rippling chord stilled them again, and Whitey and Lona began to sing:  When the upright ladies come to town.Right away they gather round  To form a club, and then decide  Who is out, and whos inside.There was a tap on Dars shoulder, and Father Marco murmured, I hate to distract you from what looks to be a rare event, but we do have other matters to consider.With a jolt, Dar remembered an electroclub swinging down at him.Uh, yeah.We are in kind of a rush, arent we?He sidled through his circle of admirers.Excuse me, ladies.Im on call.They made politely distressed noises, and turned back to Whitey and Lona eagerly.Whatever the song was, it seemed to strike a chord with them.It seemed to be making an analogy between economics and sexual relations, but reversing what was usually understood to be a good woman versus a bad.Look at the coin in which you pay,  The wages of a working day.Compare it to the honest bill  Of lifelong toil and thwarted will.The patrons cheered, and the girls faces turned very thoughtful.It occurred to Dar that Whitey might be accomplishing the same task Father Marco was trying, though by very different methods.but it is pretty urgent, Father Marco was explaining to Tessie.She held up a palm and shook her head.Dont explain, Father; I might be pegged for an accomplice.Besides, Ive had to leave a place in something of a hurry myself, on occasion.Bring your people here.She beckoned.They followed her around through a darkened salon.There was a squeal and a muffled curse.As you were, Tessie ordered crisply, eyes resolutely fixed straight forward.Dar followed her example, though he was burning to look over his shoulder and make sure Sam was safely following.He felt like Orpheus on the return trip.They turned left into what was either a small room or a very large closetprobably the latter; the walls were lined with racks of evening clothes, cut for small elephants.Sometimes our, ah, clients, find it advisable to leave in a different set of clothes than the one they wore on the way in, Tessie explained.Weve gathered quite a stock, over the years.Of course, youll all need some padding, but were not exactly short on pillows here.Lets see, nowthis one ought to fit you, Father, and this onell do for your young friend, here    Half an hour later, swathed in evening clothes and padded out to the equator, they filed out of Madam Tessies like a flock of pregnant penguins.Well, you cant deny they were hospitable, Dar said through a dazed but happy smile.I dont particularly care for that sort of hospitality.Sam was fuming.Dar glanced at her, and couldnt help feeling gratified.Yesterday he wouldve felt downright hopeful.Today, though, he was primarily concerned with Lona, who was, unfortunately, taking it all in stride.They even offered me a job, she noted.Sam hadnt been asked.Is thats whats bothering you?Dar could at least make it sound as though she had.No, Sam snapped.What bothered me was that whole scene in the tavern.Whitey shrugged.A brawl is a brawland you cant blame the cops; squelching that kind of thing is their job.Yeah, but they dont have to gang up three on one.Dar frowned, remembering.Especially since I was losing.No, that isnt standard.Whitey frowned, too.Then he shrugged.Anyway, I had a good time.I didnt, Sam said stiffly.I recognized the chock who led the cops inand he wasnt in uniform.Oh?Dar looked up.Anyone I know?You might say that.He had a face like a rat.A rat!Whats he doing here ?Oh.Dar pursed his lips.We never did see who was piloting our courier ship, did we?We didnt, Sam confirmed.I wondered why he took off and left us to the pirates, remember?If you dont mind my asking, Father Marco put in, Whats this all about?Our nemesis, at a guess, Sam said slowly.We thought wed left him back on Wolmar, with the rest of Governor Bhelabhers staff.At least, Terra sent Bhelabher out to take over the governorship; but he, ah, wound up resigning.We got the assignment of taking his resignation back to Terra.And we thought we were the only ones who left, Dar explained.But apparently Bhelabher had a change of heart, and sent his right hand man along to stop us.No, it wasnt Bhelabher.Sam shook her head.If hed changed his mind, all his sidekick wouldve had to do is order us to hand back that resignation formor even to hand in a counter letter from Bhelabher.You mean Rat Face is doing this all on his own?I wouldnt say that, Sam said slowly.He is a career bureaucrat in the Bureau of Otherworldly Activities, remember.Chances are hes doing what his superiors in BOA want done.A man with a face like a rat, in the BOA bureaucracy?Father Marco asked.He was frowning.Dar nodded.Thats him.But why would he be trying to kill us?Kill you?Sam shook her head.There were two cops after me, but the worst thing they had was a hypodermic bulb.A hypo?Dar looked up sharply.They were trying to put you out and take you in?Sam nodded.Thats the way it looked.But it doesnt make sense.There were two of them, and they were a lot bigger than I was.Whyd they have needed a hypo?And whyd their buddies be trying to put me out completely?I could swear their intentions werent toward prolonging my life.Could be youre paranoid, Lona suggested.No doubt; but in this case, I think it doesnt matter.And I dont quite agree with your reading of it, Samone of them was trying a blade on you.He touched the bandage that Tessie had thoughtfully taped over his wound.No, Im afraid youre both right.Father Marco was definitely brooding.After all, if you think someones a threat, and you cant capture them, whats the logical thing to do?But why would they think Im dangerous?Sam wailed.I dont have the papers!Lona was looking very interested.A fascinating episode, Whitey mused, especially since I do believe I see some uniforms approaching.All heads snapped up, and noticed the strolling pair who had just turned the corner.Just keep walking, Father Marcos iron tone advised, and Dar soothed his bodys impulse to jump into flight.Course, its been a while since I did this  Whitey offered, and Lona coughed,  but I do notice theres some sort of arcade just a few feet down, on our left.Might make a handy bolthole.Ideal, Father Marco breathed.Shall we, gentlefolk?They nonchalantly turned into the cavelike coolness of the arcade.Its long concourse stretched away before them, lined with shops on both sides.Last time you did this, Grandfather, you split us up into small groups, Lona reminded.A good point, Father Marco agreed.No doubt they counted noses after that tavern brawl, and came to the conclusion wed all gone off together.Well  Dar caught a door handle and swung it open.see ya round, folks.Sam stepped through the door before he could close it; the rest went on their way, and his team was back to its original components.They moved down a short aisle, surrounded by skeins of yarn, squares of stiff netting, and racks of patterns.What is all this stuff?Dar whispered.Knitting, crocheting, things like thatage old hobbies, Sam whispered back.Ever try needlepoint?Dar was about to answer with a pointed remark of his own, when the proprietor popped up behind the counter at the end of the aisle, grossly fat, with the face of an aging cherub and a fringe of puffy white hair around a bald dome.Something youd  like, gentlefolk?Just browsing, Dar said quickly.Interesting collection youve got here.Oh yes, I try to keep it up to date.Had some fascinating patterns come in last week, from Samia.Samia?Dar wondered, but another customer approached before the storekeeper could answer.Ah there, Kontak!Is my order in?Just an hour ago, Kontak grinned.He laid a slender parcel in plain brown wrap on the counter.Sixty spikes, five brads, Grazh Danko.Samia?Dar whispered to Sam.Isnt that the pleasure planet?You know, wrap up all your cares and clothes, and do whatevers legal?Sam nodded, her eyes on the brown parcel.And there isnt much thats illegal, except murder.I understand they dont even look too closely at that, provided the victim isnt a tourist.I think Id like a look at the next shop.But this is just getting interesting, Dar protested as Sam hustled him toward the door.Maybe too interesting.She kept her voice low as the door closed behind them.That was a porno shop.And did you catch the prices?For a pack of sleazy pictures?I have a sneaking suspicion were in the middle of what they euphemistically call an organic market.One that charges whatever the traffic will bear?Dar looked around him.These innocent little shops?Illegal goods?And services, Sam reminded.They went into a confectionary.The patron at the end of the counter was thumbing through a menu that seemed to be mostly bodies, while the proprietor was helping an obese, surly patron strike up an acquaintance with a slender sweet young thing.They turned around and went back out.So it went, for the length of the arcade.Finally, in the office of the Legal Aid Society, which kept a neat list of judges, cases, and the aid the judges required to help them make up their minds about the cases, Dar exploded.Is there anything that isnt for sale?Havent found anything, myself, a customer answered cheerfully, not noticing Sams frantic shushing motions.Of course, some commodities cant be had for cash just yet; but I understand theyre working on them.I suppose Im nave, Dar said slowly, but I thought the law was supposed to help make people equal, not uphold the one who can pay the most.The customer winced.Please, young man!We must be patient with the follies of youthbut that remark was so distinctly political that I cant ignore it!Dont offend the gentleman, the proprietor growled, an ugly glint in his piggy little eye.That was political?Dar stared.While he was staring, Sam grabbed his arm and hustled him out the door.By the time he recovered enough to resist, he was in the street.Then he managed to get his mouth moving again.Political?Speculating about the purpose of law is political?Of course, when you say things such as equal,  Sam explained.You really must do something about that death wish of yours.Why?Dar shrugged her hand off.It puts me in phase with this whole planet!Just because people dont talk politics, doesnt mean theyre moribund, Sam hissed.No, but it means their society is!They dont even care about the law any more!Dont they realize thats what keeps a society from falling apart?Oh.Youre one of these people who believes that law prevents revolutions, huh?Sure, by making sure no ones too badly oppressed.Sin?Dar looked up, startled; but it was just a portly passerby, chatting with a waddling clergyman.Sin?Come now, Reverend!What a medieval idea!Itll always be current, Im afraid, the minister rejoined, and even fashionablethough rarely as a conversational topic.It does lend a certain sauce to pleasure, the passerby admitted.And, after all, the really important element in life is getting what you wantthe things that make you happy.Of course, of course, the clergyman agreed.Take heaven, for example  The passerby was laughing as they passed out of hearing.Dar shook his head.I dont think the revolutionll wait a hundred years.You think this is bad?Sam scoffed.Just wait till you get to Terra!I can wait, thank you.Im beginning to see why you liked Wolmar so much.You know, this pretty little market couldnt be here unless the police were helping it a lot.Of course, Sam said brightly.But be fairthey might not have enough officers to cover everything.Yeah, but which is it?Dar muttered.He glanced up and saw a blimp of a shopkeeper leaning against his storefront.Dar stepped up to him, pointing an accusing finger and snapping, Which is it, citizen?How can you get away with this?Dont you have any police here?Sir!The shopkeeper drew himself up, offended.Ill thank you not to discuss such disgusting issues!And he wheeled about majestically, slamming his door behind him.Im not so squeamish, said an oily voice.Dar and Sam looked up and saw a hunched old man with a lascivious grin, peering out from the shop next door.He was obscenely slender.Whats your perversion, younglings?Plato?Descartes?Machiavelli?Ive got em all in here, all the banned books!Come in and read anythingjust fifty BTUs an hour!Lets go, Sam hissed.I dont like the way your jaw is setting!All right, all right, Dar growled.He turned away toward the end of the arcade, and bumped into someone.Oh, excuse me  He broke off, staring into a face like a rats above a short, lean body.The little man stared back at him, eyes widening in shock and horror.Then his mouth opened in a moan that turned into a scream, and he slumped to the ground, clutching his chest.What happened?Dar bleated, staring at the bright redness spreading over the mans tunic from under his hands.Murder, Id say.Dars head snapped up; he found himself staring into a very familiar beefy face, above an even more familiar breast patch badge.Youre under arrest.There was another one like him on the other side of Sam.Just hold out your wrists, now  He produced a length of cable that glowed, even in daylight.Uh, no thanks.Dar stepped backward; hed worn a manacle loop before, on his way to Wolmar.Once around his wrists, the cable would virtually meld with his skin, and his wrists would stick together as though theyd grown that way.Actually, I have an appointment at the confectionary shop, you see   Well, Im afraid weve got one thats a little more important.Come on now, lets not make a scene.The policeman stepped forward.Sam backed away as the shopkeeper hefted an electroclub and snapped it down against the officers occiput.He slumped to the ground with a muted sigh as two lean and muscular types materialized out of adjacent doorways to zap the other policeman and take their places.Bit of a lucky thing for you we happened along, the shopkeeper observed.From what I read on the newsfax, all the cops in Haskervillere out hunting you two.Now, if I was you, Id be wanting a nice, safe bolthole to bolt into, and lock behind me.Good idea, Dar agreed.But, personally, I go along with the idea that says the more you move around, the harder you are to find.I was afraid youd make this difficult, the shopkeeper sighed.He nodded to the two gorillas.Move em around, boys.Huge arms seized Dar from behind, hoisting him off the ground and carrying him toward the open air.Beside him, Sam cursed and swore, trying to kick a shin with her heels, and missing every time.As the toughs bundled them into a waiting car, Dar observed, I think the cops were the better choice.8  The sign said, You are now leaving HASKERVILLE.He turned to the tough who shared the back seat with them.You must work for somebody important, to rate a car.Might be, the man said shortly.Aint so much, though.Well, noit goes on wheels, not an air cushion.But its still more than most folks have here.Must cost a fortuneall that metal in the engine.Metal?The man frowned.Whered you grow upon Orehouse?Theyre doing such marvelous things with synthetics these days, Sam murmured.Sure, plastic, the driver confirmed.Polythermothane.Takes all the heat we need to give it, an more.Well, I supposefor a turbine.Dar frowned.Maybe even for a boiler.But how do you shield the fissionables?E is from Orehouse, the first tough snorted.Fissionablesre metal, lunk.Howd we get em ere?Yeah, I suppose it would be a little heavy on the import price.Dar scratched his head.So what do you use for an energy source?Methane.Methane?Sam cried, scandalized.Chemicals?UhI hate to butt in.Dar glommed onto the toughs arm with a mastiff grip.But, could you say a word to your friend?Were running right into a mountainside!The granite outcrop towered over them, rushing down on them.The tough nodded.Close enough, Rog.Rog pushed a button set into the dashboard, and the scrub at the base of the cliff swung outward and upward, revealing a huge gaping cave mouth.Just a bit o camouflage, the backseat tough explained.Cant leave yer front door open fer just any Tom, Dick, or Paddy t walk in, y know.No, definitely not.Dars eyes fairly bulged out of his head as the car swept into the cave, and a line of glow plates lit up along the length of the walls, lighting their way onward.The floor sloped away in front of them, spiraling down at a thirty degree angle.Rog held the car to a continuing hairpin turn, slowing down only as much as was absolutely necessary.Sam swung over against Dar and stayed there, which wouldve been very pleasant, if Dar hadnt had to keep fighting to hold himself away from the backseat tough, who might not have understood, especially since that was his gun hand.The ramp leveled off and the car straightened out, but Sam stayed over against Dar.He counted it a hopeful sign, but was no longer sure he cared, now that hed seen Lona.The tunnel flared out into a huge cavern.Brilliant glow plates spread a cold greenish light over alleyways between towering gray plastrete slabs.Id almost think those were buildings, Dar said, in hushed tones, if they had windows.They are buildings, the tough affirmed.Whatd y need windows for, down ere?Whacher gonna look at?Rog pulled the car into a slot between a small van and another car.They got out, and found themselves surrounded by a fleet of trucks and vans, parked in very orderly rows.Yes, Dar mused, your boss isnt exactly hurting, is he?Ask im, the tough invited.Yve got an appointmentimmediate.The door slid aside, and they stepped into a leather and mahogany office with a rug as thick as graft.Citizens Dar Mandra and Sam Bine, said the bald man behind the acre of desktop, almost lost in the vast swivel chair.Come in.They came in slowly, feeling as though there were guns pointed at their backs from all angles.Ridiculous, of course; the guns were probably aimed from the front.Sit.It was an order, not an invitation.Under the circumstances, Dar wasnt disposed to argue.He sat at the lefthand corner of the desk; Sam sat at the right.Thats where the chairs were.They didnt look as though theyd move.What is thisour invitation to join the Underground?Dar joked, with a tight smile.It died under the look the little man gave him.Did he always have to make the right guess at the wrong time?Their host wasnt tall, but he was very broad across the shoulders and chestand not fat.In fact, he was very hard, in the fleshand, from the look of him, in the soul, too.He wore a quiet brown business tunic with a muted yellow ascotconservative, punctiliously correct, with the look of a very high price.His nails were manicured, and his eyes were hidden behind brown lenses.Youre in the House of Houses, he grated.Dar stiffened and tried to keep his face immobile.Even buried on a prison planet, hed heard of the I. D. E. s biggest organized crime ring.The House of  Sams voice choked off.She cleared her throat.Uh, not the head offices, of course.The brown lenses swiveled toward her.The little man nodded slowly.But the head offices have to be on Terra!The brown lenses turned slowly from side to side.We like it better here.Dar clenched his fists to hide their quivering.And, uh, whom do we have the pleasure of addressing?The brown lenses tracked back toward him.Ive got a lot of names.Any one will do.Dar tried to grin.Call me Sard, thenThalvor Sard.Im the Syndic.The Syndic?Sam gasped.The biggest boss criminal in all of Terran space?A businessman, Sard said, a bit impatiently, only a businessman.Just a little impatient with government regulation, thats all.Right?His masked gaze swung to Dar.Right, Dar mumbled.From what hed heard, Sards impatience amounted to a running war on fifteen planets, and underground anarchy on most of the rest.Buthere?Sam spluttered.On a frontier planet halfway to the marches?Not so much of a frontier, as youve maybe noticed.The folks here like their comfortlike it enough to be glad to have us handy, and make sure their cops cant do much about us.And because they dont have radios, Dar guessed.Sards head swiveled back to him.My, youre the quick one, though.Right, this timeradios cost so much, the cops dont have em.That means we can stay one jump ahead out here.Oh, they can move efficiently enough inside the town, where they can use couriersbut not out here.Im what little law there is, outside the bounds of Haskerville.Dar nodded slowly.And the law can do a lot for you.Sard nodded back at Dar.Safety and protection, and a fat salary.Whatll the town law give you, the I. D. E.  law?Arrest and, probably, a quick death.Arrest?Whoa!What is this?Dar protested.Were not in trouble with the cops!Sard just stared at him.Well  okay.Maybe they did try to bushwhack us in that tavern, Dar amended.And maybe they were trying to take us in when your, ah, people intervened.But we havent done anything illegal.Youre there, Sard said.Thats enough.Why?Because youre a telepathor your woman is.And all the government sees is that, in the wrong hands, your power could be a real threat to them.He leaned back.Theyre right, too.Dar found his voice again.Telepath?Me?Sard shrugged.All right, play innocent, if you want.Theyll be out after you, just the same.Thats why that BOA man faked being murdered right next to youto give the cops a reason for arresting you.No!Dar cried.Hes trying to stop us from taking the new governor of Wolmars resignation back to Terra!Sure, Sard said slowly.Right.Uh  what would we have to do for this salary plus benefits of yours?Sam put in.The dark glasses swiveled toward her.Nothing much.Just tell us what certain people are planning to do.Youd travel a lotespecially to Terra.Handsome offer, Sam said slowly.Unfortunately, neither of us is a telepath.The glasses swung toward Dar.Fraid thats true, Dar seconded.Either I. D. E. s got its signals crossed, or you do.My signals dont get crossed, Sard corrected.I. D. E.  might, but not the LORDSand theyre the ones whore out after telepaths.The exception proves the rule, Sam said.This is it.Sard shook his head slowly.Too bad.Such nice young kids.Whats too bad?Dar felt a premonition walking up his spine.Your untimely deaths.Sard leaned forward.One of you is a telepath, whether or not the other one knows itand that telepath mustve already picked up enough information to pack half of my people off to prison worlds, maybe enough to shut down the whole House of Houses.And youd do it, too, cause youd think itd buy the LORDS off your back.But were not telepaths.Sorry.Sard shook his head.Cant take the chance.Either you join, or you leave in an urn.He pushed a button.Dont say anything right nowthink it over.This shouldnt be a snap judgment, you understand.Two tall, muscular men, impeccably dressed, came in.These gentlemen will conduct you to your accommodations, Sard explained.Youll get better ones if you join up, of course.Think it over.The accommodations had a door made of steel bars and a very elaborate combination lock.Gee, I didnt know you were a telepath.Dar flopped down on a very hard bunk.I didnt know you were, Sam retorted.Now that weve established that, shall we try to make sense out of the situation?Whats to make sense of?Dar shrugged.Somebodys spreading nasty lies about us.Probably Rat Face.Does that make any more sense out of it?Some, Sam insisted.That gets him official help in trying to get us locked up, which keeps the resignation from getting to BOA, while he waits for Bhelabher to change his mind.Dar snorted.Bhelabher?Hell wait for a century.The Honorable wont change his mind as long as Shacklars right next to him.Sam shrugged.So Rat Face is doomed to failure.Unfortunately, he doesnt know thatso he still gets in our way.So the telepath who just landed on the planet, and for whom the police are searching, is supposed to be one of us, huh?Sam nodded.Looks like itwhich explains why weve seen so many of their shoestring police.Well, what they dont get done, the House of Houses does.Dar scratched behind his ear.Its almost as though this planet has two governments, one inside the cities, and one out.Somewhat like our noble interstellar government, Sam said acidly.Theres the official government, and theres the LORDS.Cant stand long, can it?Dar stretched.Well!That leaves us two real simple problemsone, to get out of here; and two, clearing our names.I dont know what to do about two, Sam said, but about one  She stared off into space, eyes losing focus.Dar frowned.What was she doing?He was just about to ask, when Sam turned and smiled brightly.Nope, dont hear a murmur.Now, lets see  She stood up, went to the door, knelt down, reached around to the front, and pressed her ear against the back of the lock.One nice thing about a low metal planet is the lack of modern devices.Whatre you ?Sh!she hissed fiercely, and Dar shut up.She punched buttons and turned a dial for a few minutes, muttering, No  no, the other way  there, thats right  there  there!Triumphantly, she shoved on the door and, slowly, with a soft rumble, it slid to the side.She stepped out.Dar stared.Then he darted out after her.Where did you ?Whisper, she hissed.Sound carries in these tunnels!Dar put his lips against her ear and murmured, Where did you learn to do that?You pick up a lot in a government office, she whispered back, especially if you want a look at your own personnel file.Come on, lets go!She led off, padding silently down the dark tunnel.Dar could remember that they had to turn left as they came out of the cell, but after that, he was as lost as Handsel and Gretel without the bread crumbs.But Sam wasnt in doubt for a moment; she paused at the corridors end (he bumped into her.It was so dark, that was the only way he knew shed stopped), listened a moment, then darted to her right, hauling Dar after her.They went on for what seemed a half hour, but mustve been all of five minutes; then he bumped into her again.Sorry, he mumbled.Sh!she answered; then, All clear.Come on.Halfway down the next midnight passage, she stopped suddenly.Then she was pushing him back frantically, and shoving him into a cross corridor.They went down it for a few steps; then she yanked on his arm, stopping him, and froze.He could tell she froze because he could see her in the first ragtag of light that hit the far wall from a handlamp.Dar froze too, plastered against the wall like a tapestry.Whutja expect?A lean, scarred man in faded coveralls, hands handcuffed behind him, slouched forward in front of two toughs in business tunics.Ater all, he wint for me with a knife!Y cn tell Sard about it in th mornin.One tough prodded him.Git along, now.The scarred one snarled, and they passed across the end of the corridor.The reflection from the handlamp wavered over the wall to Sams right, and was gone.Dar held his breath till their footsteps had faded away, then let it out in a gusty sigh.Instantly, Sams finger pressed over his lips, then was gone, and she was tugging on his hand again.They turned right at the end of the corridor, and went on.So it went, for what seemed the better part of a day.Dar was amazed at the sharpness of her hearing.Twice she pushed them into hiding in time for someone passing by to miss them, when Dar hadnt heard the faintest sound until after they were in hiding.And she never led him past an occupied cell.How could she figure out where to go?Then, finally, she dropped down to kneel; Dar almost fell over her, but he groped back just in time.He wondered what she was doing until he heard a very faint click.Then, slowly, a slit of light appeared, and widened into a narrow rectangle that widened to a door.They stepped out into a starlit night; the door slid quietly shut behind that.How did you manage that?Dar whispered.The Labyrinth couldntve been worse!This was nothing, she snorted.You shouldve seen the government building where I used to work.Come on!She set out at a long, catlike stride that Dar had to stretch to keep up with.Theyd come out of the side of a hillock; as they rounded it, they saw nothing but a level plain, broken by the occasional outcrop, stretching away into the distance.At its limit, a feeble gleam marked Haskerville.Just like the early days, Dar sighed, when the Wolmen still thought we were enemies and I had to be ready to hide, fast, whenever I went out trading!Oh.Sam eyed him sideways.Youve been on the run in open country before?Dar nodded.The main principle is to stay away from the roads, and stay near whatever cover there is.And, of course, if something moves, you hit the ground fast, and worry later about whether its dangerous or good to eat.Here, Ill show you some of the fine points.He moved off through the long grass without a breath of sound.Sam shook her head and sighed, then went after him.As the sky lightened with false dawn, Dar started to sneak across the last yard that separated dirt track from paved Haskerville street.Sam caught his shoulder.Act nonchantly, gnappie.You go sneaking around like that, the first citizen who spots youll blow the whistle.Dar turned back.So whos going to be awake to see me?Agreed.So why sneak?Dar sighed and gave up.So they strolled into town like a couple of late night revelers returning to their hotel rooms.Any idea where were going?Dar asked.With the authorities and the Underground after us, were kinda short on hideouts.A point, Sam admitted.In this town, I wouldnt even trust a cheap hotel Whats that?Dar stopped, turning his head from side to side, and saw nothing.He strained his ears, but all he heard was a hiss of wind.Over there.Sam pointed towards a shopfront a block to her left.Come on.She set off toward the shop.After the episode in the jail tunnels, Dar wasnt about to dispute her hearing.He followed.They had come into a shabbier section of Haskerville.The houses were big, but they were simple frame dwellingsno half timbering and stuccoand looked somewhat infirm.Most of them were overdue for a coat of paintthe older part of town, at a guess, built before the planet had enough surplus to worry about aesthetics in architecture.Someone came out of the shopfront they were heading for, and turned down the street away from them.He/she was bald, and wore a gray, loose coverall.I think, Sam said, with a catch to her voice, weve struck paydirt.Dar could see her pointand now he could hear the trace shed picked up: a low mutter of conversation, underscored by the ripple of a string instrument and a flute.Sam swung the door open.They stepped into a room decorated in Late Modern Junkyard.The walls were plain pastel painted plastiboard, decorated with hangings of knotted, brightly colored twine, some of which held potted plants.The tables were plastic delivery drums, and the chairs were tree stumps, somewhat leveled off on the bottom.There was a counter against one wall; Dar recognized a section of itit had Wolmar rolled across it.The far end was topped by an arcane plastic contraption that gave off clouds of steam and a rich, spicy aroma.Most of the tables were filled, and all the patrons had shaved heads and loose gray coveralls.So, for that matter, did the people behind the counter.The musicians, on a small raised platform at the far end, wore the same attire.Dar paused just inside the doorway, feeling a prickling along the back of his neck.He couldnt help it; he felt as though hed just stepped into a village populated by a tribe he hadnt met, who might or might not be hostile.Dont worry, Sam murmured, youre with me.She sauntered over to the counter.A girl who looked enough like her to make Dar rub his eyes, came over and said, Yeah?in a neutral tone.Two cups, Sam said, and Dar felt in his purse for nails.The girl turned to the arcane contraption, picked up a cup, and pressed a valve; then she turned back to them with two steaming mugs.New here.Am, Sam confirmed.Just in from Wolmar.Panic jammed Dars stomach up toward his throat.Why not just send up a rocket thatd explode into the words, Herere the suspects!But the girls face came alive.The prison planet?Where theyre oppressing the natives?Hey, tell me about it!Yeah, me too!A tall, lanky man lounged up to lean on the bar beside Sam.Wolmar?I want to hear this!Hey!The real word?In thirty seconds, they were surrounded by a small crowd.Dar kept trying to edge closer and closer to the counter, and to glance over both shoulders at once; but Sam launched happily into an account of her tour of Wolmar.Dar was amazed at her accuracy; under equivalent conditions, he couldnt have resisted the temptation to color the tale a little, probably putting in a bevy of scantily clad maidens and a hair raising escape from a bloodthirsty tribe or two; but Sam stuck to reporting what shed seen and heard, introducing Dar as her guide, which won him a look of respect, then glares of scorn when she mentioned his being a trader, then looks of awe when she explained his teaching function.You mean its not really a prison colony?Sam shrugged.Depends on how you look at it.Theyve all been sentenced to go there.Theyre not really oppressing the natives?The asker sounded almost disappointed.Nobut look what they are doing!Sam fairly glowed with missionary fervor as she went into an explanation of Chollys educational program.Dar listened, enthralled.He hadnt known he was that much of a hero.Heyit sounds like heaven, said one Hume, with a shaky laugh.Yeah.What crime do I have to commit to get sent there?another joked; but the laughter that followed had a rather serious echo.Well, dont jump too soon.Sam leaned on the counter and pushed her cup over for a refill.The Bureau of Otherworldly Affairs sent out a new governor.Dar was delighted at the groan.Bastards always gotta foul up something good when they find it, muttered one Angry Young Man.Establishments cant stand progress, growled another.Yeah, but BOA didnt figure on Shacklar.Sam sipped her refill with relish.Why?What could he do?The AYM frowned.Well, the new governors credentials kinda got, uh, lost, before he could show them to Shacklar.And by the time Shacklar got done with him, hed decided to resign and join the colony.The room rocked with a hoot of laughter.The AYM smote the counter gleefully.Go, General!
