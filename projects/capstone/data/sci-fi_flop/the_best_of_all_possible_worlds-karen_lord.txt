 BEFORE He always set aside twelve days of his annual retreat to finish reports and studies, and that left twelve more for everything else. In earlier times, he had foolishly tried retreats within comm reach of his workplace, and that was not at all helpful. There would always be some crisis, something for which his help would be required. As his salary and sense increased, he took his retreats farther and farther away, until at last he found himself going off-planet to distant temples where the rule of silence and solitude could not be broken by convenient technologies. This season, he had chosen Gharvi, a place with small wooden buildings scattered around a huge temple of stone, all set within the rain shadow of a mountain range. An endless ocean, both vista and inspiration, ran parallel to the mountains, and a beach between the two offered long walks to nowhere on either side. A place of two deserts, some said, for sea and land were bleak togetherone boundless, one narrow, and both thirsty. There was a place at home very like it, and that had probably influenced his choice, but the sky was unique. The atmosphere was the cloudy bluish lavender of a recently bioformed planet, and the sun was scorching bright. It was so unlike the cool, strong blues and gentle sunlight of his home world that for the first few days he kept his head down and his door closed till nightfall. On the twelfth day, he took his handheld, replete with work well completed, and put it in the box outside his hermitage door. He cooked and ate his evening lentils, slept soundly through the night, and rose to prepare his morning porridge. There was a little water left over from the day before (he was ever frugal), but to have enough for washing he had to fetch the new days supply from the box. The young acolytes of the temple always put sufficient water and food into each hermits box before dawn. It was enough to stay clean, to fill the solar pot with porridge or pottage, and to sip and slake the constant thirst that was the natural consequence of dry air and silence. The acolytes would also take away his handheld and safely transmit its contents to his workplace. But his handheld was still there. He paused, confused by this disconnect in the seamless order of the temples routine. He stared at the untouched box. He looked up and frowned in puzzlement at the squat shape of the temple, vaguely visible through a haze of heat, blown sand, and sea spray. Then he shrugged and went on with his day, a little dustier, a little thirstier, but convinced that an explanation would eventually be made manifest. The following morning, well before dawn, the sound of the box lid closing woke him from a sleep made restless by dreams of dryness. He waited a bit, then went to bring in the supplies and drink deeply of the water. His handheld was gone, and a double ration of food sat in its place. He did not even peer into the darkness to catch sight of the tardy acolyte. Order had been restored. Dllenahkh, with your level of sensitivity and strength, you must go on retreat regularly. So he had been told long ago by the guestmaster of his monastery. You are constantly looking to set things to rights, even within yourself. A retreat will teach you again and again that you are neither indispensable nor self-sufficient. Put bluntly, learn to stop meddling. Commitment is important, detachment equally so. He congratulated himself on his developing ability to keep curiosity in check and spent the next few days in undisturbed meditation and reflection. One day, after a long morning meditation, he felt thirsty and decided to get more water from his supply box. He stepped out with his glass drinking bowl in hand and set it on the edge of the box while he tilted the half lid and reached inside. His hands were steady as he poured water smoothly from the heavy, narrow-necked jug. Moving slowly, he straightened and took a moment of blissful idleness, the jug left uncovered near his feet, to squint at the suns glare on the desert beach and the desert ocean and to feel the coolness of the water creeping into his palms as he held the bowl and waited to drink. It was a childs game, to hold a bowl of water and mark the increase of thirst with masochistic pleasure, but he did it sometimes. He brought the bowl to his mouth and had a perfect instant of pale blue ocean, bright blue glass, and clear water in his vision before he blinked, sipped, and swallowed. Many times afterward, when he tried to recall, his mind would stop at that vivid memorythe neatly nested colors, the soothing coolness of the glassand not wish to go any further. It was not long after that, not very long at all, that the day became horribly disordered. A man walked out of the ocean, his head darkly bright with seawater and sunlight. He wore a pilots suitiridescent, sleek, and permeablethat would dry as swiftly as bare skin in the hot breeze, but his hair he gathered up in his hands as he approached, wringing water out from the great length of it and wrapping it high on the crown of his head with a band from his wrist. Recognition came to Dllenahkh gradually. At first, when the figure appeared, it was a pilot; then, as it began to walk, it was a familiar pilot; and finally, with that added movement of hands in hair, it was Naraldi, a man well known to him but not so well known as to excuse the early breaking of a retreat. He opened his mouth to chide him. Six more days, Naraldi! Could anything be so important that you could not wait six more days? That was what he intended to say, but another thought came to him. Even for a small planet with no docking station in orbit, it was highly uncommon for a mindship to splash down so close to land that a pilot could swim to shore. Although he knew Naraldi, they were not so close as to warrant a visit at this time and in this place. The pilot slowed his step and looked uncertainly at him with eyes that streamed from the irritation of salt water. Something terrible has happened, Dllenahkh said simply. Naraldi wiped at his wet face and gave no reply. My mother? Dllenahkh prompted to break the silence, dread growing cold and heavy in his stomach. Yes, your mother, Naraldi confirmed abruptly. Your mother, and my mother, andeveryone. Our home is no more. Our world is No. Dllenahkh shook his head, incredulous rather than upset at the bitterness and haste of Naraldis words. What are you saying? He remembered that he was still thirsty and tried to raise the bowl again, but in the meantime his hands had gone chilled and numb. The bowl slipped. He snatched at it but only deflected it so that it struck hard on the side of the water jug and broke just in time to entangle his chasing fingers. Oh, was all he said. The cut was so clean, he felt nothing. Im sorry. Let me He crouched and tried to collect the larger fragments but found himself toppling sideways to rest on one knee. Naraldi rushed forward. He grasped Dllenahkhs bleeding right hand, yanked the band from his hair, and folded Dllenahkhs fist around the wad of fabric. Hold tight, he ordered, guiding Dllenahkhs left hand to clamp onto his wrist. Dont let go. Ill get help. He ran off down the beach toward the temple. Dllenahkh sat down carefully, away from the broken bits of glass, and obediently held tight. His head was spinning, but there was one small consolation. For at least the length of time it took Naraldi to return, he would remember the words of the guestmaster: he would not be curious, he would not seek to know, and he would not worry about how to right the tumbled world.           I remember when the Sadiri came. We gathered at the port to cheer their arrival and, frankly, to gawk a bit. The Sadiri consider themselves to be the pinnacle of human civilization. Imagine them settling on Cygnus Beta, a galactic hinterland for pioneers and refugees! Well, these ones apparently were willing to break the moldbut then again, a lot of things had been broken past repair, and sometimes it makes more sense to create something new. They looked almost Cygnianeyes, hair, and skin all somewhere on the spectrum of brownexcept for the bright iridescence of the hair and a subtler sheen to the skin that was only noticeable in full sunlight. As it was the dry season, there was plenty of that. They looked up into the sun and appeared relieved at the heat. Dont tell me they werent; that impassive Sadiri stereotype is a load of crap. They have body language. They have expressions. Just because its not their way to yell their emotions out like most people doesnt mean they dont have them. Parliamentary representatives welcomed them formally but briefly, and they were taken to their homesteadings in fine diplomatic style. Everyone felt sorry for the Sadiri in those early days, and maybe we were all a little bit overproud of ourselves for hosting them. Cygnus Beta isnt a rich colony by any means, but we understand fleeing disaster and war and disease and struggling to find a place where youre wanted. A lot of people act like misfortune is contagious. They dont want to be exposed to it for too long. Theyll take you in and make all the right gestures and noises, but when the months wear on and youre still in their house or their town or their world, the welcome starts to wear a bit thin. So we understood, and maybe we were making a point, too. There isnt a group on Cygnus Beta who cant trace their family back to some world-shattering event. Landless, kinless, unwantedtheoretically, the Sadiri would fit right in. Those were the thoughts that were foremost in my mind the day the Sadiri came. I barely even noticed when my friend Gilda said to me, But where are the women? I should have paid attention. Its not that all-male homesteader groups dont come to Cygnus Beta. Many times people send the strongest and most intrepid to establish a level of comfort on the homesteads before sending for the rest of the family, and for some cultures that translates as men only. The reality of Cygnian society is that those men often end up settling down with someone whos already here, because, let me tell you, theres no long-distance relationship like an interstellar one, especially when youre all but marooned on a rock where communication with the rest of the galaxy means week-delayed real-space transmissions from the nearest long-range sat. ButSadiri men? The epitome of morality and tradition, savants too absorbed in their mental exercises to succumb to base urges? It was hard to imagine them going native like most frontier boys. Fortunately for my curiosity, I was in a position to find out about them. Im second assistant to the Chief Biotechnician of Tlaxce Province, which means that I get to travel a lot because its the biggest province, and its also the province with the largest number of new homesteads. Sadiri homesteads galore, in other words. Plus, and keep this one quiet, please, Im kind of a language nut. Old languages, new languages, made-up languageswhatever, thats my hobby. I already had a smattering of Sadiri, so it was inevitable that I would get stuck with the duty of liaison for the public health and agriculture departments. My opposite number was a joy to work with. No chitchat, no wasted time. Id turn up at his office, hed go over the schedule briefly with me, and off wed go in a groundcar to do our inspections. His Standard was better than my Sadiri, needless to say, so many times I just did a lot of listening while he talked with the homesteaders, and then afterward hed summarize for me so I wouldnt miss anything. I didnt expect them to speak Standard to me. When youve been almost exterminated, language is the first thing you cling to, one of the main roots of identity. One day, while we were driving back to his office, a very interesting conversation took place. Dllenahkh, I said to him (learning to pronounce his name had been a fine challenge, but once I substituted a Zulu dl and a Scots ch, I got it), tell me how we can help you in the long term. What kind of settlement do you plan to establish? We understand if your aim is to keep as much of Sadira alive as possible. Do you require Sadiri plants? Hardy variants crossed with the indigenous flora or hothouse specials in biodomes? We can requisition anything we like from the galactic seed bank or even check with New Sadira to see what strains theyre developing. Thank you, Second Assistant Delarua, but at present it is enough for us to adjust to the environment and achieve basic self-sufficiency with what is readily available. Closer consideration of our long-term goals will follow after the completion of the initial phase. I must confess, I liked listening to Dllenahkh. He had a very soothing voicedeep, somewhat slow, and very precise. It was a voice that matched his thoroughness and professionalism. I wish I had a voice that matched what I do. Ive been told I sound like an overexcited rooster when I start rambling about my work. There is one matter in which you can assist us, however, Dllenahkh continued. Our community is relatively isolated, and it has been suggested that it would be appropriate for us to take the opportunity to experience other cultures on Cygnus Beta. To participate. Tomingle. He used Standard for that last, there being no precise equivalent in Sadiri that could convey the frivolous intent behind such a word. Mingle? I repeated incredulously. Yes. Mingle. While much remains to be done, we are beginning to suffer from a lack of mental stimulus. Cygnus Beta is reputed to have some of the most complex and vibrant cultures in the galaxy. It would be appropriate to study them. I gave him a slanted look. Id been around the Sadiri long enough to learn that whenever they start claiming something is appropriate, theres something theyre not telling you or something theyre not admitting to themselves. Dllenahkh had said appropriate twice now. He mirrored my look, which Id learned was his style of humor. So. Do you have any recommendations? Do I have any recommendations for a Sadiri boys night out? I shrugged, smiled, and allowed myself a laugh. I can come up with something. I did, too. The Ministry of Culture has all kinds of programs, and I got someone to put together a package that even the Sadiri might enjoy. But people, this is Cygnus Beta. Yes, we have a few large cities and several townswere not all country bumpkins, vagabonds, and adventurersbut there are few professional artists and actors, few galactic-standard museums and theaters. We simply cant afford them. Its true that most of the action happens in the urban belt, but often bands of entertainers travel around and test their lucksome venues they might get paid in credits; other places itll be in kind. I did speak to one performer who waxed poetic about the joys of the road and how hed made a map with locations marked for the excellence of their particular product: the best wines and spirits, of course; the best baked goods; the best cured meat and smoked fish; the most fragrant smoking herbs for incense or pipeyou name it, he could tell you where to get it. I should point out that amateur or semiprofessional doesnt mean low quality. It means variable quality. You get serious thespians next to dilettante wannabes because theater companies have to take people as and when they become available. Your best King Lear might be the security guard at a small branch of a city bank. Hes only going to get two or three weeks off for performances, then youre back to the understudy, the very earnest but not really that good retired schoolmate of the director. I offered two options: either a series of overnight trips to the urban belt or visits to the Sadiri homesteads by some of the touring companies. Both, said Dllenahkh. Both? I repeated, raising an eyebrow, my tone more flat than querying. He raised an eyebrow back. Both it was. Ive mentioned my friend Gilda before. I love her dearly, but I swear shes a bad influence on just about everyone. I suspect that three out of her six children arent her husbands and that he knows it but doesnt care. Hes so under her thumb, she must have had more than one Zhinuvian ancestor. She has three main groups she hangs out with, and she tries to annoy each one. She bores her housewives group with her science research, she makes her drinking buddies miserable with her tales of domesticity, and she scandalizes her coworkers (thats me) with her lurid sex-capades. So Gilda was happy to hear that the Sadiri were venturing out, because she too wanted the opportunity to experience other cultures, if you know what I mean. She insisted on being the coordinator and guide. At first I was glad when she took it out of my hands so that I could go back to ordinary stuff, but this was Gilda, and something told me to inquire more deeply. So, I asked her at the office when she set up the first theater visits, whats the playbill for this trip? Grease: The Space Musical, Titus Andronicus, and that new monologue by Li Chen where he first spends ten minutes crisscrossing the stage in silence, then sits in a Bagua-inspired design in the center and periodically plays the Uilleann pipes. Aie-yi-yi, I yodeled mournfully. Do you want them to judge us? Theyll judge us anyway. Theyre Sadiri, and were Terranwell, mostly Terran. Judging other humans and finding them wanting is what the Sadiri do. She was quite unperturbed about it. At first I said nothing. Strictly speaking, it was true. The Sadiri and their fleet of mindships had been the backbone of galactic law, diplomacy, and scientific discovery for centuries. Even though other humans slightly resented them, I knew I wasnt the only one who quietly hoped that the pared-down version of their government would be just as effective at running the fleet. On a personal level, I hadnt noticed a judging attitude from Dllenahkh, but when one considered that their home planet was poisoned by their own close cousins, the Ainya, well, they didnt have that much high ground to stand on to look down at others anymore, did they? Before I could voice that thought, there was a polite cough at my door. Dalenak! Gilda said in cheery greeting. How did Dllenahkh manage not to wince at the womans atrocious pronunciation? Are you here for the inaugural trip? Dllenahkh thanked her courteously and said no, he had but come to consult me regarding the matter of the hydroponics on the homesteads of the southwestern quarter, which had been experiencing some difficulty. She took the hint and her leave so that I could close the door and speak to Dllenahkh in privacy. I thought lying wasnt a Sadiri thing, I began. Then I looked at him more closely. Dllenahkh? Who hit you? It is an internal matter, already resolved, he said. I frowned, but there was nothing I could say to that. You seemdepresseddistracted. Whats brought you to town if its not Gildas entertainment tour? There is a visiting emissary from the Government of New Sadira. We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow. That still didnt explain why Dllenahkh was in my office. Would you like to come with me to the Museum of History? I said. Yes, he acquiesced somewhat absently. That would be quite interesting. We walked there. I kept silent, waiting for Dllenahkh to talk to me. He waited until we had passed the geological displays and entered the Hall of Names before breaking into speech. Do you know why we came to Cygnus Beta? he asked. I glanced at him. His eyes were staring straight ahead at the writing etched on the granite walls. We came to find the taSadiri. He turned his head very slightly and looked at me. Do you know of whom I speak? Sadiri who do not practice the mental disciplines, I replied immediately. They left Sadira and founded Ain, and a few settled elsewhere in the galaxy. But they did not found Cygnus Beta. It was already here. I have heard of the beings you call the Caretakers. He said it neutrally, and I was glad for the small courtesy. Some people think the idea of the Caretakers is just another one of those savior-guardian myths that primitive societies dream up to deal with the uncertainty of the universe. Yes, I said firmly, they are the true founders of Cygnus Beta, but we acknowledge other early settlersmostly Terrans, its true, but also Ntshune, Zhinuvians, and taSadiri. There are strong psionic and proto-psionic strains in your ancestry, he noted. That was another one of the reasons we chose to come here. I wondered where this was going. So whats wrong, Dllenahkh? He struggled. Clearly these were very private matters. There is a lack of consensus concerning our path. Securing the future of our people is, of course, the primary concern, but the way this can best be achieved is in dispute. Some feel that preserving genetic and cultural integrity would be the most effective course of action. With so few of us surviving, every person would be needed for this endeavor to succeed. Others believe that negotiation with the Ainya with a view to eventual integration of our tribes is the best option. But perhaps that was their reason fordoing what they did, I said awkwardly. Theyve never had your level of galactic influence. Wouldnt integration be kind of like giving them what they want? He paused. Yes, he said at last. Many of us hold the same view. However, from the Ainya perspective, we drove out their forefathers and denied them their birthright; hence their pride in claiming responsibility for our downfall. Perhaps they wish to see us not merely humiliated but destroyed completely. He sighed and continued. A third way has been proposed: colonies of hybrids selected for Sadiri physical traits and mental abilities and raised according to Sadiri values and traditions. A wry smile twitched my lips. Terrans: the chicken stock of every human genetic soup in the galaxy. Terra was the newest of the crafted worlds and Terrans the youngest breed of humans in the galaxy, but what they lacked in technology and mental development, they made up for in sheer evolutionary potential. Other humans patronized them and overlooked them, but just mention hybrid vigor and suddenly Terrans became very popular. Of course, since Terra itself was still under embargo, that meant Cygnus Beta got all the attention. So, I asked him, which Sadiri are you? The second way or the third way? His face went still in that manner I had come to interpret as profound uncertainty. No decision has as yet been made. We are a reserve. I tilted my head and frowned at him, confused. His eyes glanced briefly at mine, and then he blinked and looked aside again as if acutely embarrassed. As many of our off-planet occupations are filled by men, more Sadiri males survived the disaster than females. This has created somedisruption to our usual bonding customs. For this reason, the excess of males was sent to this colony. The Science Council of New Sadira will as a priority select for a greater number of females to be born as soon as possible. Given our life span, it is possible that they may be our future wives. I pondered this, realizing the truth of what he said. Most of the Sadiri on Cygnus Beta were, by their standards, very young. But how distressing and strange to spend decades on some kind of genetic backroom shelf waiting ones turn to clinically contribute to the expansion of the species! I said something of the sort to Dllenahkh. He let me know my views were inappropriate. I shut up. The Hall of Names is a very complicated place. The obvious part of it is the walls with the names of the thousand dying nations who came here or were brought here, but there is also a low susurration of a thousand extinct languages; the occasional whiff of smoke, incense, or perfume from various half-forgotten rituals; the distant moan and skirl of ancient instruments that no one knows how to make anymore. Its a very apt place to ponder the future of an entire world, but its a little depressing as well. What do you think the emissary is going to say? I asked. Dllenahkh said nothing. Perhaps he did not know. Perhaps he knew but would never tell me. Lets go have lunch, I said. We fell back into our usual routine after that, which is to say we were all business. I knew that the Sadiri homesteaders continued their cultural outreach, visiting the towns and other provinces and permitting visiting groups in return. They did indeed seem to be taking note of how various cultures had adapted to social conditions on Cygnus Beta, so even what appeared to be recreational also had some element of anthropological study to it. I did not delve deeper, and although the Sadiri emissary returned for another visit some months later, I did not quiz Dllenahkh about it. Gilda, on the other hand, was a font of information. She called me at my desk one day, too excited and impatient to walk the few meters to my office. Have you heard the news? Ain has been quarantined. Nothing goes in, nothing comes out. That got my attention. I dropped everything and drew close to my monitor. What? Has the tribunal given the verdict already? Gilda looked very sober, which was extremely unusual for her. The trial isnt over, but Ain is incommunicado. Thats impossible, I stated. The Terran embargo works because we can see everything they do and show them what we want them to see. Ains technology is too advanced. Maybe they did it to themselves. Maybe theyre hiding. She scoffed. Theyre not that advanced. People are saying it was the Caretakers. Personally, Im glad. Sadiras going to be nothing but sterile rock for a very long time. My eyes widened, and I felt a little thrill. The Caretakers! It was as if angels had descended to avenge the Sadiri. I guess they dont like people undoing their work. How are the off-planet Ainya handling it? Gilda gave a wry smile. Heres the irony. You know only two fleets have ships that can travel as far as Ain. I laughed without humor. She meant the Zhinuvians, whod charge an arm and a leg for passage, and the Sadiri whowellI wasnt sure what theyd do, but any Ainya would have to have a lot of gall to approach a Sadiri pilot now. The sequestering of Ain was a big change in more ways than one. Even though theres bad blood between Ain and Sadiraseriously bad bloodId had a vague hope that they might come together after a generation or two out of necessity if nothing else. It looked as if the options had been whittled down from three to two, and where that left the Sadiri I had no idea. New Sadira was a small planet, a former science outpost that had gained an unexpected promotion. It would serve for a drastically diminished population, but as it had neither the resources nor the size to replace Sadira properly, the Sadiri would be forced to make a decision about their future sooner rather than later. It was difficult to tell what they were planning to do. Some of the Sadiri were definitely minglingin fact, given their youth, one might even say experimenting. I detected from the sternness of Dllenahkhs expression when some of the more amusing tales were related in his vicinity that the elder Sadiri of the group were barely tolerant of this behavior, but what could they do? Kick the youngsters out? Every Sadiri capable of procreation was precious, and any of them could be brought back into the fold later no matter how they might now be choosing to deal with their shared tragedy. That said, about a couple of months shy of a year after their arrival I found myself in the unenviable position of being mandated by my boss to find out whats going on with those Sadiri. I chose a long road trip to broach the topic with Dllenahkh, reasoning that if we were driving through the middle of nowhere, he wouldnt have any place to escape to. To give myself a level of protection, I turned off the autopilot and nav and drove the groundcar myself. I understand theres been a bit of a Sadiri baby boom, I said delicately, keeping my eyes on the road as I maneuvered through freshly gouged potholes, the result of a strong start to the rainy season. Dllenahkhs teeth clicked as we bounced through a bad patch. It does appear that way, he said eventually with clenched jaws. Is this an indication? I started, and then said, Does this mean a way has been chosen? The silence continued for long enough that I regretfully concluded that Id pushed my luck too far. Then Dllenahkh spoke, sounding slightly injured. Little choice has been offered where these births are concerned. Three of the fathers have been unable to obtain anything more than visiting rights, while a fourth has been charged with sole custody. Two are in a particularly difficult situationtheir children have been acknowledged by other men and are being raised with no recognition of their heritage. In only one case has there been the formation of something resembling a bond, and that man has requested to move to the homestead of his childs mother, there to live, no doubt, according to the culture of her people. I whistled. Added to the other stories Id heard, those were more births and far fewer marriages than I had expected. So, youre telling me youre being fetishized, used, and dumped. Good enough to sleep with but not good enough to marry. Fresh blood. The new kink in town. The Your observations, said Dllenahkh quietly but quellingly, are not particularly welcome at this moment. I felt genuinely ashamed. Sorry. I got a bit carried away. The thing is, weve always been a matriarchal society. Cygnian fathers have little say in decisions about child rearing. I thought you realized that. We continued in silence while I focused on a nasty bit of road slippage. At one stage, Dllenahkh had to get out and push the car through a slurry of fine limestone before it could find purchase once more on firm ground. He got back in, placing his caked work boots on the center of the mat with fastidious precision. It had been a trivial but welcome diversion, easing some of the tension from the atmosphere. My thoughts wandered as I tried to think of what to say, and then, of course, my subconscious took over. Dark they were, and golden-eyed, I quoted dreamily. The reference escapes me. Its a classic work of fiction about Terrans who go to colonize Mars. Except Mars colonizes them. It turns them into dark, golden-eyed Martians who exactly resemble the extinct indigenous people. Im telling you, if you think you can colonize Cygnus Beta and turn it into Sadira, centuries later all youll have is a slight tendency to shiny hair and pedantic speech in the common Cygnian stock. Oh, Dllenahkh, I am so sorry. I tried to warn you. I do not recall This was too serious for multitasking. I pulled aside, turned off the groundcar, and faced him fully. I asked you what you wanted in the long term. Do you want to be all-Sadiri or Sadiri-Cygnian? Because if the formers your aim, youre going about it the wrong way. His head dropped wearily, which is as close as a Sadiri can get to a wail of anguish. I do not know what we want. We wish only to survive, and we are trying all possible means to do so. I closed my eyes, struck by a pang of loneliness. If I can tease Gilda about having a dominant Zhinuvian gene in her makeup, then I must also admit that there might be a little too much Ntshune in my own background, an occasional echo of emotions not my own. And Dllenahkh was lonely, no mistake. It poured off him like mist and settled into my bones with a pain as insistent as the ache of an old injury. It was most upsetting. All right. You need to coordinate with the Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance. But Dllenahkh, you have to come clean; none of this juvenilesorry, culturally conditionedembarrassment over the details of Sadiri marriage and bonding customs and no underhanded plots to seduce and indoctrinate women into the Sadiri way of life. Be up-front. I mean, you have chosen the right place. Weve already got a mail-order-bride mentality, and weve been selecting for fecundity for centuries. How many other places could produce so many births in such a short space of time? This is true, said Dllenahkh with what sounded like a glimmer of hope. Plus, you could have it both ways: take a short-lived Cygnian wife for the first part of that long life of yours, then go home to your girl-brides and start a fresh full-blooded family. Just berespectful. Honest. And stop thinking youre the superior ones! Youre just another drop in our gene pool! Were all descended from peoples who thought they were kings and gods and who found themselves to be almost nothing at all in the end. Dont let that be you. He sat in chastened silence for a while, then said humbly, There is merit in what you say. I will discuss the possibilities with our local council and approach the ministry as you have suggested. I exhaled in relief. If only they knew how close they had come to wearing out our patience. If there is one thing a Cygnian cannot bear, its the stench of superiority. Too often it had been a precursor to atrocity and a rationale for oppression. The Sadiri wouldnt change overnight, but at least it was a start. Dark you are, and golden-eyed, Dllenahkh said quietly. My eyes are brown, I replied, puzzled to hear a Sadiri say something so nonsensical. I understand that on Terra gold is considered a rare and precious metal. To be golden is to be special, cherished. He looked at me. To me, your eyes are golden, because they have perceived who we truly are. I said nothing. I opened my mouth, failed to breathe, and lowered my eyes from that intense gaze. It hurt too much, like bright sun on tender skin, bright and searing with the beauty of both what had been lost and what remained. For a moment, the blood of my ancestors called out in empathy, and I almost embarrassed myself by crying in front of a Sadiri. I bit my lip, took hold of myself, and the moment passed. Then I started the car, and we traveled on to the next distant homestead.          MATCHMAKER, MATCHMAKER Whats this? The department secretary/courier glanced back at the envelope he had tossed onto my desk. How would I know? I looked him up and down. Gilroy was a gawky youngster, too tall yet still growing and plagued with a limp, the result of a bad break on a distant homestead days out from the reach of advanced medical care. He poured all the energy that should have been spent punching cattle into gossipingsorry, gathering intelligence. I picked up the envelope and twirled the ends of the ribbons on the seal, all the while staring at him meaningfully. Wellall right. He gave his usual precursor to a juicy scoop: a quick glance around to make sure no one could overhear. I understand that youve made a good impression on someone, and youre going to have a slight change in duties. I frowned, scared now. The First Assistant Biotechnician was new to her post. Unless she was going on maternity leave or had been sacked, there was no way I was taking her placenot that I wanted to. Theres only so much deskwork I can stand before Im desperate to be out driving through the homesteadings. And there was definitely no way I could be making Chief. What other twists were possible on my career path? I realized Gilroy was watching me and smirking at the panic I hadnt bothered to hide. Right, thanks. Close the door behind you, I said, dismissing him brusquely. I shut my eyes and spun my chair around once, maybe trying to lighten my anxiety, maybe trying some weird little made-up luck ritual. Then I broke the seal and pulled out my orders. They want me to do what? As if on cue, my monitor chimed and flashed. I glanced irritably at the message box; then my eyes widened, and I tapped the channel open. Delarua here. Second Assistant Delarua, I believe you must have opened your correspondence by now? My boss tries to get away with stuff by being cute. Shes short and stocky, with big round cheeks and deep dimples. She fools no one. The more she dimples, the more you know youve been screwed over. Chief, I cant believe you didnt discuss this with me first. Whatever happened to the Human Relations and Vocational Guidance Department? Everyone there die of the plague? Fell into a coma? Got amnesia? Even as I spoke my frustration, I reined myself in a little. As dangerous as the dimples were, it was worse if you said something to make them disappear suddenly. My boss didnt permit subordinates to take liberties. Sorry, dear. This came in from over my head. She shrugged. Its only a years assignment. Why not see it as an opportunity to broaden your curriculum vitae? Im a biotechnician! The longer I stay away from my field, the more my CV suffersyou know that! My eyes narrowed. Wait a minute. Someone above you messed with the personnel structure of your department, and youre still smiling? I felt suddenly ill, my stomach going into free fall. You wanted to get rid of me? Why didnt you say Delarua, relax! I have no problem with you or your work. And yes, Im not shattered, but its because of who your replacement is. Then she spoke the name Dr. Freyda Mar, a name that will mean nothing to you or, lets be honest, to most Cygnians, but for those who know the up-to-date research in the biotech field, it was almost as if Albert Einstein had decided to take a year off from research and teach secondary-level general science. Her? What would she want with my crappy little job? Sorry, Chief, but even you must admit that the least glamorous work of the department falls under my remit. I mean, hydroponics, and health inspections, and sewage, and driving hundreds of klicks and sometimes sleeping in barns if youre lucky and in the car if youre not. I mean yes, I like it, but everyone knows Im strange. Well, maybe shes strange too. She wants to write a book about the practical applications of her research. More power to her, I say. Ive always thought academics should get a little slurry on their boots from time to time. I took a deep breath. If Freyda Mar was coming to fill my place for a year, there was no way I was getting out of this. Fine. I see Ive got two months before I go. Whens Dr. Mar coming? In a months time. Youll have the joy of showing her the ropes. The idea of memeshowing Dr. Freyda Mar how to do my job for a whole month so thrilled me to the depths of my techie soul that I completely forgot I was supposed to be angry about leaving for an entire year to gowhere? On a wild goose chase as part anthropologist, part diplomat? The latter half of the week rolled around, and I was on my way to Dllenahkhs office at the usual time to discuss the inspection schedule. I did have a moments pause at his door, wondering how he would react to the news of my assignment, but it was only a moment. Dllenahkhs secretary was of the Gilroy stamp: young, gawky, and more than a little curious at my hesitation. Councillor Dllenahkh is expecting you, he prompted kindly. Thank you, Joral, I muttered, and went through. I tried to explain to Dllenahkh what I thought was going to happenmy assignment, my replacement, and so forth. I kept my tone neutral; I dont believe in behaving either disgruntled or gleeful about work-related matters, especially around people outside my department. He leaned forward, set his elbows on the desk, and contemplated his fingers in silence for a while. During that while, I finally realized he was not in the least surprised. Oh. Oh, no. Oh I began to swear. One of the advantages of having languages as a hobby is that it can take you quite a while to run out of swear words. I hadnt even exhausted my list from the dead languages I know when I paused for breath and Dllenahkh spoke up, still apparently addressing his fingers. Could it be that you are vexed with me, Second Assistant Delarua? Could it be that you are laughing at me, Councillor Dllenahkh? Are you the reason for this complication in my life? Please, explain this madness! His brows drew together briefly, erasing that faint suggestion of suppressed amusement that had so irritated me, and he finally looked me in the eye. I fear that you have not been fully briefed as yet. No doubt your superior has informed you of all that she knows and a more detailed mission dossier is forthcoming. I assure you, this is not madness. He got up and walked to the archaic map board that showed Tlaxce Province and the regions bordering it. He faced it, placed his hands behind his back, and unexpectedly exhaled a large sigh. Before I begin, I have not properly thanked you for your recommendation that we seek the assistance of the Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance. As a result, some of the custody cases are being reviewed, and counseling is being provided for the parents and families involved. While it is unlikely that all cases will be resolved amicably, the situation is less fraught than previously. Furthermore, any future attempts at cross-cultural partnering will be channeled through the ministrys programs for that purpose. Not bad, I said, pleased and mollified. Theyve been establishing and maintaining unions for generations now. Theyre quite good at what they donot perfect, but far better than nothing. He glanced back at me briefly, then raised a hand to indicate the provinces. Tlaxce, which is the largest province, is also one of the most genetically homogeneous provinces due to the presence of the capital and the main spaceport. We have been advised that if we are seeking Cygnians with a high percentage of taSadiri genetic heritage, we should go to the outlying regions of the neighboring provinces. Still clinging to your concept of purity? I said quietly. Dllenahkh turned and looked at me in a way that I fancied meant, When you lose your home and all but a remnant of your people, feel free to return and lecture me on the ethics of purity. I lowered my eyes. So the mission is to find Cygnian groups that are more taSadiri than the average, I paraphrased meekly. Your facility for the languages of Cygnus Beta is what led me to recommend you as Civil Service liaison. That and your insightfulness. First the stick and then the carrot. He had become quite talented at manipulating Cygnians with a little flattery, I thought sourly. And what role will you play? I have been authorized to assess both the settlements and the people we encounter in order to determine whether it would be more efficient for us to join those settlements, or to encourage potential wives to remove to our settlement here in Tlaxce. Although Dllenahkh would never stoop to smugness, there was an unwarranted certitude in his tone that suggested he had already decided what the obvious choice would be. He took a last look at the map and returned to sit behind his desk. The First Assistant to the Chief Biotechnician is a year younger than you and is likely to serve for at least another five years in her post. The Chief Biotechnician will not retire for at least another twelve years. All higher positions in the department require greater managerial experience and less technical skill. I estimated there was a low probability that your career would be harmed, andI have noticed that you derive a certain amount of enjoyment from our field trips. I hope I did not misinterpret the case. There was the merest hint, the tiniest suggestion of humility and concern in his gaze. I shrugged. Im sorry I swore like that. It was a bit of a shock. Im sure it will all work out. He nodded. Excellent. Then let us begin our rounds, and I will tell you about the other personnel on the mission team. What he did not tell me, what would have been more useful, was the name of the higher-up who had managed to deepen the dimples in my bosss cheeks with the bribe of Freyda Mar! Because let me tell you, I want to kiss that person. We were already starstruck and willing to welcome the most eccentric, knee-sock-wearing, port-drinking, absentminded professor type that ever came out of Tlaxce University. But Freyda Mar dressed normally, drank water, remembered everything, andokay, she was a little eccentric, but in a way that everyone could appreciate. She bore a striking resemblance to a tall, middle-aged Wicked Witch of the West except not, you know, being actually green. A few days before our first field trip, I looked at her long, wavy black hair, and all I said was, Are you sure? She took one look at my own close-cropped do and said, You know, youve got a point. Whereupon I step out to get us some coffee for the mid-morning break, and when I get back, the scissors are out of the drawer and on the desk and the wastepaper basket is bristling with a meter-lengths worth of hair. Im telling you, my mouth fell open, but she just laughed at me and took the mugs from my hand before I dropped them. In spite of all that, she seemed a little bit nervous about working with Sadiri, so I gave her a quick, casual primer while she worriedly tapped notes into her handheld. Trust me, theyll love you. They dont do small talk and they have a constant need for mind fodder, so feel free to discuss your work in detail. Let them do the heavy lifting; theyve got the high-grav build for it, and theyre happy to show off their physical strength. Dont try to shake hands with them. Dont touch anyones head, especially not their hair. Thats a big no-no. Custom? Or something else? she asked, stopping in midinput. Thats canny of you, I said approvingly. I dont know for certain, but I think it might have something to do with the telepathy. She nodded, looking thoughtful and a lot more relaxed. Years ago I spent some time doing research at a university in the Punartam System. I met a Sadiri mindship pilot there. He always wore gloves, always kept his head covered. I thought it was cultural at first, but maybe theres more to it than that. Freyda had just proved herself to be a typical techie. Ask her to remember the arbitrary rules of some foreign etiquette and she fretted. Give her a possible scientific explanation for a social behavior and she was fine. Road trips, now, are a real test of character, and I had no idea how she would handle the long and sometimes boring drives. I soon discovered that you could get her to sing from any musical or opera, very loudly, as the car rolled along, and sometimes Id join in, though with less volume and skill. Poor Dllenahkh, who was accustomed to far quieter rides, would look at us sideways with an expression of mild terror. But even Dllenahkh warmed to her when she switched into technical mode. He listened to her very, very closely, their heights almost matching, constantly nodding and nodding as she rattled off some aspect of her latest theory. At one point, I could swear I saw him looking at her almost dreamily, as if he had ceased to listen to the content of her words and was thinking about something else. I was getting ready to tease him about having a romantic crush to rival my professional crush, but then he caught me by surprise the following week. I had been expecting Kavelan to replace him as the homesteading liaison, Kavelan being a young but sober-headed subordinate in the office whom I had encountered several times over the past year or so. Instead, a completely new face turned up. It was difficult to guess how old he was, but I estimated from his aura of maturity that he was closer to Dllenahkhs age than the average Sadiri male of the homesteadings. Dllenahkh did the introductions. This is my replacement, Dr. Lanuri. He will be joining us for inspections henceforth. Dr. Lanuri inclined his head, and Freyda and I gave little bows in turn. He had creases on his face that looked suspiciously like laugh lines, but if they were, they had not been used for a very long time. He still bore the slightly vacant expression of deep depression that had characterized Dllenahkh and many of the other Sadiri in the earlier days of settlement. I wish I could say I was given the opportunity to get to know him better, but after a quick briefing on the inspection schedule, Dllenahkh led us out to not one groundcar but two. He said, Given that our vehicles must occasionally serve as temporary shelters, I considered it unwise to approach the passenger limit too closely. Therefore, each team will go in its own groundcar. The nav systems have been linked. I wish you a safe and pleasant journey, Dr. Lanuri, Dr. Mar. And then he positively dashed toward a car with what for a Sadiri smacked of unnatural and unseemly haste. I followed, bemused by the teasing lilt to his formal and unnecessary farewell to Dr. Lanuri (the first leg of our rounds was only a two-hour journey, after all) and wondering if I had imagined seeing an exasperated glint in Dr. Lanuris eyerather like the one I usually get when my mother starts hinting that a second son-in-law and more grandchildren would be nice. You know, I said to him once we had started off, Im thinking the Ministry of Family Planning would be more subtle than you were just now. Perhaps you should leave the matchmaking to them. Dllenahkh pretended to look aggrieved, but his demeanor reeked of too much satisfaction for it to be convincing. I do not understand what you mean by that statement. It is more convenient for Dr. Mar and Dr. Lanuri to go together in one vehicle so they can begin the team-building process which is so important to Cygnians. Mm-hm, I replied with deep sarcasm. Dr. Mar, like any urbanite, was sufficiently cultured to tune her natural enthusiasm to a volume and frequency that would be appreciated by her new colleague, which is to say they seemed to have a fair rapport at the end of the first two hours. Still, I was fairly impressed the following week when we got out at one destination a little ahead of the others and we distinctly heard singing, loud, full-on opera singing, coming from the second groundcar. Of course, by the time the car stopped and the doors opened, there was only mild professional chatter between the two. I looked at Dllenahkh in shock. He merely raised his eyebrows in a way that was as good as an I told you so. How did you pull this off? I demanded when the others were out of earshot. Pull what off? he asked coolly, his tone mildly mocking the colloquialism. How did you know theyd click? That requires a level of intuition that seems to me unlikely to reside in the methodical Sadiri mind. I extrapolated from what I knew of Dr. Lanuris late wife. She was very similar in both manner and appearance to Dr. Mar. Lanuri has found itdifficult since his wifes death. I had hoped that he might find solace in Dr. Mars company and, let me admit it, perhaps even consider the possibility of marrying again. On another day that might have meant more teasing about being a matchmaker, but today I was in a grumpy mood. So even Sadiri men find women interchangeable, I scoffed under my breath. That is not what I said, he murmured, looking at me oddly. I waved my hand, trying to brush away the words. Forgive me. I was thinking of something else, something irrelevant. So the second spouse is often very close in temperament and appearance to the first spouse. Yes. The first bond is, in a way, never completely broken and constantly seeks the absent partner. Marrying someone similar assuages some of the shock and helps with the grieving process. Some people think widowed Sadiri pine away and die, I remarked, referring to a common trope in Cygnian literature and drama. That would be inappropriate, Dllenahkh said, infusing the word with a measure of distaste that was new. There are degrees of depth of bond. All Sadiri experience a bond with each other, and there are rituals that deepen the connection, the marriage ceremony being but one. However, one can be telepathically connected to one with whom it is difficult to live peaceably. The ability to know anothers mind does not preclude the likelihood of misunderstanding it. Good point, I said. Unsaid but also understood was that no Sadiri would take the selfish luxury of choosing death as a way to escape emotional pain. All were bereaved, and now life was the priority. The following weeks inspections were routine. Dr. Lanuri looked slightly less depressed, and Freyda was cheerful and professional as always. It wasnt much to go on. I caught Dllenahkh frowning to himself. Theyve only just met, I told him. Did you really expect love at first sight? Hmm, he replied. Has Dr. Mar given any indication ? He was unable to finish the sentence, but I realized what he was asking. I was aghastonly slightly aghast, really, but I played it up because there are so few times when Dllenahkh is anything but the consummate Sadiri savant. I cant believe you asked me that. Thats rude even by Cygnian standards. He frowned some more and dropped the subject. But I did find out. Not by askingIm not that inquisitivebut by alcohol, and not even my alcohol, so it really wasnt my fault. The last day of our inspections together, Freyda showed me a bottle of some fortified Cygnian vintage hidden in her knapsack. We got a groundcar to ourselves and put nav and autopilot in control. Then we got chatty. I told her my thoughts on the mission, that it was essentially a waste of time, but at least I was getting paid to travel the world for a year, and the Sadiri would have the satisfaction of knowing theyd investigated every possibility. She told me she was tired of academia and taking a sabbatical to write a book seemed a bit tame, so this way shed be out for a year and still have the sabbatical year to write, thus staying away from the university for two years instead of just one. The wine went down rather smoothly. I discovered that she did, in fact, have a fair bit of taSadiri in her background. She found out that I had just enough Ntshune in me to start people off on a giggle loop. Youve heard of someones laughter being infectious? Well, many Cygnians of Ntshune stock have the knack of giving people the giggles in a serious way, probably some unintentional emotion-feedback thing. We spent the next inspection choking back snickers while the Sadiri gave us puzzled looks. The next journey was for more sober talk. She said shed been engaged, but thered been a mutual decision not to marry after her academic career took off, leaving her tied to the city and her fianc still wanting the life of a homesteader. I said Id been engaged too and also broke it off by mutual agreement, though my career was nowhere as illustrious as hers. You still have time, she said generously. At first I thought she was talking about my career, and I was flattered, but then I realized she meant time to have a family, and I felt a little less flattered. Well, what about you? Have you considered early retirement and going back to be a housewife on a homestead? She looked embarrassed. I suppose I could register my name with the Ministry of Family Planning, but I keep falling for the wrong men and getting distracted. The words were general, but there was something in the guilt that crossed her face that made me gasp and blurt out, Lanuri? For the first time, I heard bitterness in her laugh. I hope Im not that obvious! No! No, youre not. Its justwell, you do seem to get along quite well together, andhmmhow do the Sadiri show they care, anyway? She pushed back the rough bangs of her hacked-off hair and scowled. Well, Im sure they dont do it by constantly mentioning how beautiful and intelligent and completely irreplaceable their late wives are! Oh, I said sadly. Yeah, Im a sad, sick person, jealous of a woman who died in the greatest genocidal attack sincewell, since Cygnus Beta was founded. And if you so much as breathe a word, she concluded sharply, and it was time to change the subject. We got back a little earlier than the other two, and rather than sit and wait outside, we persuaded Joral to let us move the farewell party into Dllenahkhs office. The rest of the place was emptyinspection tours often took us past the usual work hoursso we left the door open, put our feet up on his desk in a kind of rebellion against all Sadiri sensibilities, and set to finishing off the wine. After a short half hour had passed, we heard Jorals hushed voice through the open doorway. Dr. Mar and Second Assistant Delarua seem to be engaged in some kind of female bonding ritual. In my office? came Dllenahkhs bemused reply. I think both of us were picturing the expression on his face, because we went off into another giggle loop that put paid to any lingering illusion of professionalism. Fortunately, that wasnt the final farewell. We had a nice, sober proper seeing-off a week later at the main train station in the city. Gilda was there, and Dr. Lanuri and Freyda. I hugged Gilda hard, making a mental note to send many souvenir trinkets to her kids, and got cheek smooches from Freyda, all the while thinking, Im drinking buddies with Freyda Mar! How cool is that! We clasped arms briefly and exchanged looks. Hers said, Dont tell anyone how pathetic I am, and mine said, Hang in there, youre not pathetic, youll be fine. The three Sadiri men, Lanuri, Dllenahkh, and Joral, stood slightly apart, making their somber farewells, far more absorbed in the meaning of the mission and their hopes for its success than in any trivial sadness over the temporary absence of a colleague. I felt a little jolt when I looked at them, a sudden awareness of the insane reality that had brought them here, a flash of insight into how death and devastation had completely reshaped their lives and destinies. Like Freyda, I suddenly felt foolish for being annoyed at them over a small matter of unrequited love. We boarded and found our seats. I leaned my head against the window by my seat, looking at Freyda as she lingered to give us a final wave and blinking back tears. Silly matchmakingand now she would have a year to suffer through, pretending her feelings didnt exist. I was vexed with Dllenahkh. Dangling an emotionally unavailable Sadiri male in front of herhah; that was a tautology if there ever was onewas more than cruel, it was irresponsible. I thought of the messed-up attempts at courting that had left tangles even the ministry wouldnt be able to unsnarl. Would any of them be capable of forming normal unions, unions based on more than a desperate need to keep their cultural and genetic heritage alive? Did the Sadiri ever admit to needing therapy? My struggle with my emotions did not go unnoticed. You will miss Dr. Freyda Mar very much, said Joral, examining my face curiously. Yes, I said, my tone firm, calm, and neutral. I wish I could have had more time to work with her. Joral nodded in understanding. Dr. Lanuri speaks of her often. I believe he finds her to be almost Sadiri in her clarity and depth of thought. Furthermore, he says that her appearance is very pleasing and in many aspects reminiscent of his late wife Joral, Dllenahkh chided. But it is true. I am only repeating what Dr. Lanuri has said on several I stared at him as suddenly all the fragments that I knew came together in a gestalt that looked nothing like what I had at first assumed. Joral, said Dllenahkh sternly. It is not appropriate to discuss Joral, youve got more sense than any of us! I cried. I jumped up and ran to the door, paused with a skid, went back to grab the startled youngster around the face and plant a kiss on his forehead, then took off again. Freyda was just turning to leave the platform. I thundered toward her, and she looked back at me in shock. He loves you, you remind him of his wife, hell never admit it, its a stupid Sadiri thing, its up to yougo, go, GO! She gaped at me, her eyes gradually widening during my whispered babble and ending up filling with tears, the jaw drop becoming a wide grin. I squeezed a quick hug around her shoulders and ran back to slither through the carriage doors before they slid shut. I returned to my seat with a small smile of bittersweet triumph. Dllenahkh looked at me with a strange expression that I couldnt quite read, but I didnt care. I was thinking about the year ahead and hoping for at least one happy ending for a friend. Joral leaned forward and said earnestly, You seem to be very sad about leaving. It is all right if you wish to cry, First Officer Delarua. We will not think badly of you. We understand that this is common behavior for many Terran females. Well, Im Cygnian, I snapped. And I wasnt going to cry. I swear, nothing irritates me more than being overemotional in front of a Sadiri. They make you feel so silly. Dllenahkh coughed almost apologetically. First Officer Delarua, at one stage you suggested that I had complicated your life by asking for you to be assigned to this mission. Is it now the case that you are beginning to enjoy the complications? Thats an almost Cygnian streak of smug-bastardness youre displaying there, Dllenahkh, I warned with a small, rueful grin of acknowledgment. He straightened slightly, and his eyebrows rose by a fraction at the sly insult. Then the train pulled out and we were off to start our grand adventure, around the world in one Standard year. Zero hour plus eleven months twenty-eight days Standard Time was invented by Sadiri pilots. Most Sadiri procedures and quantification followed straight lines and linear progressions, created for the convenience of the ten-fingered. But TimeTime belonged to a higher realm. It could not be carried in human hands, not while it constantly carried human minds. It was all circles, wheels within wheels, a Standard year of three hundred sixty Standard days coiled up in twelve months, which in turn were composed of the small whirlings of twelve hours day and twelve hours night, tiny spinning minutes and seconds, ever-cycling breaths and blinks and beats. To be described as having a pilots mind was both curse and compliment; it could mean being unable to tell the difference between prophecy, memory, and mere dj vu. Dllenahkh knew that it was almost one Standard year since the destruction of his home and his life. He knew it not like a memory but like the vague dread of a possible death, a death yet to come. He left the thought and the feeling while he could still breathe and focused instead on the present. The train vibrated gently, its windows filled with the rich black of a moonless night in deep country. Delarua had already retired to the sleeping car, leaving them to continue their work. Dllenahkh looked into the soothing darkness, then made himself examine his handheld screen once again. The ambient light was too dim and the screen overbright, but perhaps, he admitted, that was not where the fault lay. The minute tension around his eyes might be caused by the fact that he was staring too intently at the reports and briefs, as if willing them to create the world he wanted to exist. Behind closed doors, the council had wrangled over the mission proposal with a pettiness and lack of direction to rival the callow youths they claimed to represent and govern. Then again, from what he had heard and seen, the Government of New Sadira was hardly doing any better, something that he found reassuring and dismaying in equal measure. If the Cygnian Governments response had been the least bit lukewarm, the mission would have been dropped for good, but they had been enthusiastic, offering specialists, funding, and resources until the project gathered unstoppable momentum and even the most cynical councillors softened. Hope: that was the key. They were all clutching at straws, despairing and drowning, then clutching at a fresh set of straws. It was exhausting. It was all they had. Naraldi said it was important to keep moving forwardyes, forward, one clutched straw at a time. Highly ironic advice, considering, but useful nonetheless and something to hold on to now that Naraldi was off on his own mission, beyond the reach of any comm or courier. His last words, perhaps? No, never that. He expected that Naraldi would have a safe journey and a safe return. What was one more straw to add to all the rest? First Officer Delarua is not what I expected, Joral mused. Dllenahkh kept his head bent over the mission schedule. Sometimes it was best not to engage when Joral indulged in his habit of thinking aloud. She kissed me. Dllenahkh glanced up at the young man. As a statement it was innocuous, but Jorals face held that anxiously pondering expression he used whenever women were being discussed. She is too old for you, he replied firmly though not unkindly. Now, let us go over the Acora, Sibon, and Candir briefs again. I would like us to be fully prepared when we meet our new colleagues.          A MEANS TO OTHER ENDS We have a doctor on this team, I said through gritted teeth. Dllenahkh raised his head for a momentary glance. We have a Commissioner who is an anthropologist and a geneticist. Such expertise is not necessary for trivial injuries. The only expertise Dr. Daniyel had that I wanted was the skill of understanding my need to howl shamelessly while having centimeter-long spines picked out of my palm. I hissed and twitched as Dllenahkhs tweezers probed too deeply. He gave me a tired look, firmly positioned my wrist between his knees, and gripped. Then he held the tips of my fingers and applied the tweezers with a will. I twisted in my chair, turned my head into the crook of the elbow of my uninjured arm, and kept it there. You may cry out if it makes you more comfortable, he said kindly. It was only the movement that was problematic. Im good, I whimpered. After a few more minutes of torture, the barbaric antique tweezers were laid aside and a modern medical scanner was passed over my hand. Having satisfied himself that the wounds were indeed clear of debris, Dllenahkh picked up another instrument and began to seal the punctures and lacerations. I emerged from hiding, sighing with the bliss of the absence of pain, and slowly flexed my hand. I would recommend that you stay away from that particular plant in future. No disagreement here, I said firmly. She only did it to get out of her turn at poling the punt, Lian said to Joral with a laugh. They were at the back of the shuttle, unloading the last set of supplies from storage. Mm-hm. That elegant trip and fall was all part of my cunning plan, I said with distracted cheerfulness as I cautiously ran exploring fingers over my healed skin. Lian and Joral went out, carrying a box between them. In a few minutes, having reassembled and put away the medkit, Dllenahkh also left. I gave my hand one final pat and was about to join them when Joral came back into the shuttle, a slightly furtive expression on his face. He slid into the chair beside me and placed his hands flat on his knees with an air of resolve. First Officer Delarua, is Lian male or female? I looked at Joral in utter shock. That is not a question you should ask anyone but Lian. In fact, I dont even think you should ask Lian that. Why do you even need to know? Lian is highly intelligent and has features that are visually pleasing, but I do not know whether it would be appropriate to Joral, should you really be assessing the wife potential of every female you meet? He looked slightly abashed. Such matters would have been arranged for me before, but now, with things as they are, it makes sense for me to review all possible options. He began to tap his fingers on his knee, counting. Nasiha is already bonded, you are too oldat least too old for meDr. Daniyel is definitely too old, and that leaves Lian by a simple process of eliminationif, of course, Lian is female. Joral, I said quietly. A word to the wise. First, it is best to steer clear of any assessment or discussion that uses the phrase too old to describe a woman. Second, fraternizing with members of the mission team is not recommended. We will have to live as close as family while maintaining a high standard of professionalism. Complications would not be helpful. Joral looked at me apprehensively. He had already learned that it was not a good sign when I spoke slowly and quietly. I will take your advice, First Officer Delarua. Good. Now, Lian isLian. Lian has chosen to live without reference to gender. This may or may not mean that Lian is asexual, though many of those who are registered as gender-neutral are indeed so. However, it doesnt matter, because this has no bearing on our mission and is thus none of our business. Now come on. Theyre waiting for us. My little tumble has put our whole schedule out of whack. It was a bit of an exaggeration. Things were proceeding as usual outside the shuttle. Nasiha and Tarik, the Sadiri married couple on loan from the Interplanetary Science Council, were securing equipment on the pallet that held our supplies. Dr. Daniyel was talking to Lian, and Lian was making notes on a handheld computer with a stylus. Dllenahkh also had a handheld and appeared to be recording a memo in a low murmur. Then there was Fergus tweaking some last clamp on one of the punts and Joral and myself bringing up the rear with the last box of supplies wed need for this trip. We were a motley crew, with two Sadiri in dark blue Science Council uniforms, the Cygnians in Civil Service gray and green (semiformal yet serviceable gear courtesy of the Division of Forestry and Grasslands), and the two remaining Sadiri in beige and dark brown civvies. Fergus, our security and survival specialist, attracted our attention by clearing his throat and began his briefing. They say its unlucky to urinate in the waters of Candir, he said. Its true. Theres a parasitic fish in the river thatll swim up your urethra and get wedged in good and proper. Very painful. Dont risk it, but if you must, the Commissioner might be able to remove it without calling for medevac. The smirk that had appeared on my face at the word urinate slowly transformed into a look of sheer horror; my smothered chuckle ended in a sickened gulp. Oh. Youre not joking, are you? Fergus scowled down at me from his two-meter-plus height. I do not joke. My job is not a joking matter. Okay, I murmured meekly. Pincushion plants and perverted parasitic fish. I could tell this place was going to be lovely. Fortunately, my strong right arm was not needed to bring us to our destination before the darkening of twilight. Weor, rather, the rest of the teampoled our three small craft to a central platform in the middle of the tree-fringed marshes and moored them carefully. Fergus boarded first and helped Dr. Daniyel up. As we gathered together on the platform, we gazed about at the houses: simple structures on piles, some with steps going down to small vessels moored underneath, and other, larger residences connected to the main platform by boardwalks. The water was flat and rich with moss and weed that tinted the crisply mirrored images of the houses with a green glass sheen. The place was quiet, as if all were in the middle of a siesta. Do we call out? Ring something? Lian asked uncertainly. No, said Tarik. We have been seen. His voice sounded a little strange, but when I saw the canoe and the people who were paddling it, I understood. Thus far, we had visited two settlements, both of which had indeed registered a significant amount of taSadiri heritage according to Dr. Daniyels genetic tests but whose inhabitants had in culture and appearance so resembled the average Cygnian as to be unremarkable. These ones, nowthey had the hair. We set up our government-issue shelters on a spare platform (civil servants are discouraged from accepting hospitality when on duty in case of bias or conflict of interest). It was quite comfortable. The marsh was fed mainly by outflows from the Candir, and it did not rain during the time we were there. Screens and repellent kept the biting insects away, and filters made collecting potable water as simple as leaning over the platforms edge. Their sewage system was excellent, its tubing tucked away behind piles and under boardwalks leading to a treatment area some distance away on dry land. I took notes. I intended to keep up-to-date in my own field as much as possible. When Dr. Daniyel finished taking the blood and tissue samples she needed, I went with her back to our landing site and we worked in the minilab that had been purpose-built into the shuttle for the mission. It wasnt really my field, but some kinds of lab skills are pretty elementary, so I ended up helping a fair bit. It was a good thing too. I observed Dr. Daniyel and realized that something wasnt quite right. She leaned over her work in a way that spoke not of absorption but of exhaustion. Youll get your own DNA in the samples if youre not careful, I said lightly. Perhaps you should take a break. Dr. Daniyel pulled her graying locs over one shoulder with a slow weariness that was oddly graceful, then stepped back to let me help with the analysis. There will be time to rest after the missions done. Ive been pushing for a global genetic registry for years now. Perhaps this can be the start of it. Its early in the mission. You mustnt forget to pace yourself, I said, expressing my concern with care. I didnt want to appear to be telling my boss she looked unfit for command. Oh, this? She smiled, waving a hand at herself. Chronic. Still within Service parameters, but I do have a condition that makes me tire quite easily. Thats why I have Lian for the heavy lifting, but as for the rest of it, Im pretty much the only person with the skill and experience for this job. I adjusted the meters and toggled the last few switches. There. That should do it. I looked at her. With all due respect, maam, I can get the results later and save them to your files for you. She seemed amused and gratified at my solicitude, which was good because it could have gone either way, but then her face changed. Aggregated data, she said, her voice suddenly alert and firm. We dont do individual scans. This is an anthropological analysis, not a medical report. Yes, maam. I am familiar with the bioethics section of the Science Code, I answered calmly. She smiled once more, not offended at being humored. Its going to be a long mission. Feel free to call me Qeturah when off duty. Im Grace, I responded. But everyone calls me Delarua regardless. The results were interesting. These Cygnians did not possess a greater percentage of taSadiri genes compared with those in the last two settlements, appearance notwithstanding (genetics can be a funny potluck, let me tell you), but what they did have was a surprising amount of cultural integrity. Tarik and Nasiha went off to speak to the people, recording words, stories, myths, and customs in a far more detailed and directed manner than Cygnian anthropologists had yet accomplished. Of course, they had something we didnt, a knowledge of some of the more obscure and ancient Sadiri dialects, and with that they were able to make far more connections and discoveries than we could. Once the bio tests were all finished, there wasnt much for me to do, but our stay was extended so that Dr. Daniyel could satisfy herself with more anthropological data and the Sadiri could explore the potential for links between their settlements. For a few days, I just relaxed and took it in. Sometimes Id watch Joral, who was ostensibly helping the Science Council officers or taking minutes at meetings for Dllenahkh, butquite honestly? Checking out the girls. It was an education in Sadiri flirting. One in particular must have been his favorite, because he all but disassembled one of the biosensors in order to spend time explaining its workings to her. Sadiri mating displays seemed to consist of flashing bright mental plumage at the object of desire in as cool and disinterested a fashion as possible. Otherwise, Id sit on the edge of a balcony staring at the mesmerizingly slow flow of the green water and hearingoverhearing, reallyDllenahkh debating some principle of Sadiri philosophy with the settlements Chief Councillor, Darithiven. Of all the humans of the galaxy, we Sadiri have developed the greatest mental capacity, Dllenahkh contended. We have realized our potential through use of the disciplines, which enable us to control our thoughts, emotions, and urges and improve our ability to process data. Without the disciplines we might still be powerful, but we would be rudderless. Darithiven smiled the slightly condescending smile of a man who is prepared to humor his opponent but not to yield the argument. Your disciplines are indeed impressive. Your pilots use them to navigate ships on interstellar routes, and because of them all Sadiri have acquired a reputation for impartiality and diligence. Even now, our systems of justice and scientific endeavor continue to be headed by Sadiri. But here we live simpler lives, with less to trouble our minds. We need only enough self-control to maintain a harmonious society. He extended his arms, embracing the view of his settlement and his people like a proud father. Dllenahkh actually hesitated before replying. Your settlement is indeed well organized and efficiently run. But there is more to the world, to the universe, than these waters. Perhaps you do not wish to explore the galaxy yourself, but what of your children and your childrens children? The earlier certain things are taught The Chief Councillor shook his head and interrupted gently. I hope you are not implying that we limit our children by what we teach or do not teach. We have our own version of the disciplines, and they are not lacking in rigor. It is simply that our goals differ. Is that so inappropriate? By this time, Id be almost slipping into the water from boredom as they went back and forth on the question of the scope and purpose of the Sadiri disciplines. I could see Darithivens point. To tell the truth, this was one of the sleepiest settlements Id ever encountered. People kept to themselves, not in an unfriendly fashion but as if truly uninterested in our presence. We saw them coming and goingmen up to the river to fish, women to the nearby rice paddies and the other crop fields south of the marshes, the remainder busy at home with their arts, crafts, studies, or whatever else they chose to occupy themselves with. Whatever form of mental discipline they employed, it clearly worked for them. The settlement had the same atmosphere of measured efficiency that Id encountered on the Sadiri homesteadings of my own province. How are the talks going? I asked Dllenahkh. His eyes lit up. It has been most intriguing. They are, of course, quite attached to their simplified variant of the disciplines, but I believe in time some of them could be persuaded to return to the orthodox methods practiced by most Sadiri. I gave him a look. Mmm-hm. So will your guys come here or will they go to you? They would encourage males from our homesteadings to come here and are willing to send in exchange groups that would be mostly female. Sounds reasonable. Well done, I congratulated him. I was a little chagrined, actually. Id been so cynical about this mission, and here we were, already third-time lucky. It wasnt storybook perfectI could tell theyd be debating for generations to comebut at least there was a foundation. Dr. Daniyel told us at our evening meeting that it was time to wrap up and move on to explore other areas. Dllenahkh, Nasiha, and Tarik reluctantly agreed. When I looked at their faces, I remembered Dllenahkh saying to me that all Sadiri shared a low-level telepathic bond. If that were indeed the case, visiting the marshes of Candir must have been like being immersed in a constant buzz of subtle connection. I could understand why they would be hesitant to leave. Joral didnt want to leave at all. I have already identified two potential candidates for betrothal in the five days we have been here. Surely it would be worthwhile for me to remain and gather more anthropological data. This could assist our homesteaders in making an informed choice as to whether they should remove here or no. Dr. Daniyel shot a sharp look at Dllenahkh, which he missed because he was already frowning at Joral. I smiled to myself, waiting to hear him tell the young Sadiri to be patient, to remain disciplined, and to focus on the mission. Joral, no. But Councillor Dllen I said no. Lian and I looked at each other, ludicrously wide-eyed with shock and amusement. Dr. Daniyels lips twitched, but she said nothing. That was when the commotion started outside: shouting, the thud of running steps on the wood of the boardwalk, a womans scream. Fergus was first out, Lian close behind, but we all scrambled to see what the fuss was about. There was still sunlight at that hour, though the long shadows of the trees and houses darkened the waters. A small fishing boat was drawing up to one of the walkways. The smell that came from it was not the odor of gutted fish but the strong metallic tang of blood. A hand trailed carelessly over the side into the water, and the sickly gray hue that overcast the skin was visible even from where we stood. People gathered around, and the shouts grew louder. Whats happening? said Dr. Daniyel at my ear. Their boat was attacked, I said, listening and translating the fragmented, overlapping speech into a coherent explanation. Theres another settlement off a tributary upriver, and theyve quarreled over fishing rights for some time, it seems. II think that mans dead. Theyre talking about going to the other settlement for I paused. I couldnt believe the word I had just heard. Id heard the words in Sadiri separately but never together, and so it was with a panicked glance at Dllenahkh that I said, Blood price? Price for blood? Price in blood? Dllenahkh gave me a look I could not understand. Sorrow? Shame? But he did not correct me. Theres Darithiven, said Nasiha suddenly. It was indeed the Chief Councillor of the settlement, and he had to pass us to reach the fishing boat. His gaze flashed across to us, he hesitated, then he appeared to make a decision and came toward us. May we be of assistance, Chief Councillor Darithiven? Dr. Daniyel asked immediately. He was already shaking his head. A small matter, a local matter. It is nothing new. We can manage without outside interference. I grabbed the hard muscle of Ferguss arm. A muted glint of edged metal had appeared amid the crowdand there again, a blade in one hand, a spear in another. I see it, Fergus said gruffly. He exchanged a look with Lian, and I saw them release the catches on their holsters and adjust their pistols to a high but nonlethal setting. Darithiven saw it too, and his expression was resigned but approving. You have your own security. That is wise. Now I must leave you. There is much anger here, and it must be appropriately directed. We have had too many incursions into our waters, and it is time to deal with the culprits sternly. There are other, civilized ways of dealing with the matter, Dllenahkh insisted. Darithiven looked at him with pity. Then, by your definition, this cannot be civilization. He strode off toward the gathering mob. Nasiha inhaled sharply and began to whisper to Tarik. Their stance changed from relaxed stillness to defensive tension as they drew closer to each other. What is it? I demanded. Their behavior irritated me. Perhaps it was because they were both spouses and colleagues, but they were such an annoyingly cozy little self-contained unit. My Sadiri, as I had labeled Dllenahkh and Joral in my head, understood the simple courtesy of explaining themselves from time to time. They are making themselves angry, Dllenahkh muttered, profoundly disturbed, as he stared at the growing crowd. They have lowered mental shields to each other and are projecting and augmenting a desire to fight and kill. Suddenly, his head snapped to Joral, who stood stiffly, breathing heavily, his fists clenching spasmodically at his sides. Joral! Remember your disciplines! It isdifficult, Councillor Dllenahkh, Joral admitted. Stand with Commander Nasiha and Lieutenant Tarik, Dllenahkh ordered. Before I could ask him why he didnt follow his own advice, he started off in the direction of the crowd, saying, I must stop this. No! shouted Dr. Daniyel. To my shock, Dllenahkh ignored her and walked on. I wavered, eyeing her, hoping for permission, however subtly conveyed, to go after him. Instead she did the sensible thing and actually followed our mission protocols. Lian, Fergus, get everything essential into the punts. We must get ready to leave as soon as possible. Delarua, find Darithiven for me. I have a few things to say to him. I noticed that she did not issue orders to Tarik and Nasiha, but she did give them one of her sharp looks. It seemed to break them out of their cocoon because they started to help Lian and Fergus while keeping an eye on Joral. He followed them meekly, still looking shaky. I dashed off along a path, already knowing where to go. Darithiven was not far away. He stood on the balcony of his residence and surveyed the scene below with an unsettling expression. It was not peace exactly, butsatisfaction? A sense of seeing something come to pass that had been planned for a long time? As I halted halfway up the steps, he looked down his nose at me as if I were something small and unimportant come to bother him. I glared back. I would not allow him to forget that whatever rank he held in his own little patch of marsh, Dr. Daniyel and I represented the government that allowed him to exercise that rank. The Commissioner wishes to speak to you, I growled. Now. Dr. Daniyel was waiting on the central platform. She stood meditatively with arms folded and head slightly bowed. She looked calm and resolute. I knew she was tired. Thank you, First Officer Delarua. Please inform Councillor Dllenahkh that we are ready to leave. Lian, go with Delarua. As we rushed off, I heard her begin to speak to Darithiven in the slow, disappointed tones of a scolding parent. As it seems you can no longer guarantee the safety of my team Where is Dllenahkh? Lian said, glancing about nervously. I stared. I couldnt see him either, and I didnt relish going into the middle of that loud, surging mass. There! I pointed to the edge of the crowd. He had stepped up onto a low balcony and was speaking with two of the older men. Their faces were masks of bitter fury, his a study in intense determination, as if he expected to persuade them through sheer force of will. I shouted to him, my voice thin and distant in all the noise, and he did hear me, but he looked at me with a brief, dismissing glance and went back to his argument. Damn, I said. Let me, Lian said grimly. Long soldier strides took Lian to Dllenahkhs side in seconds. I followed close behind. Come with us, Councillor Dllenahkh. The Commissioners orders, Lian said simply and quietly. Not yet, Lian, I must Not a request, Councillor Dllenahkh, Lian replied. It was only when I saw Dllenahkh flinch ever so slightly that I realized Lian had nudged the pistol into his ribs. His lips pressed together, the one angry sign in a face that refused even now to lose control. I see, was all he said. Lets go, I squeaked, agitated by the atmosphere around us, and we walked away briskly, unchallenged and unmolested in the growing maelstrom of anger that was, thankfully, not directed at us. It felt like a retreat. It was all done according to procedure, but it felt like a retreat. Lian sent off a preliminary bulletin to the nearest government outpost so that the situation could be monitored by the appropriate authorities. Dr. Daniyel sent a more detailed report the moment we returned to the shuttle. Nasiha, Tarik, and poor Joral were clearly relieved, their condition improving the farther we traveled from the marshes. Fergus was pleased that the bug-out drill he had insisted on had been used so early in the mission and had worked so well. Dllenahkh I didnt dare look at Dllenahkh. When I finally, furtively glanced at him just as the shuttle was taking off, his face was impassive, his demeanor as calm and controlled as ever. I knew he felt my gaze, but he did not meet my eyes. We flew for a little less than an hour before landing near our next destination, a bit of savanna country farther south. Fergus set out perimeter alarms while we wearily put up our shelters and sought sleep. We did everything right. It still felt like a retreat.  When I woke up the next morning, emotion came before memory, so my first coherent thought was to wonder if it was a hangover that had me feeling so miserable. Then I remembered the previous day and felt thoroughly sick. I pulled myself together, freshened up, and went to see if Dr. Daniyel needed me for anything, but Lian said she was still sleeping, so I went away again with a vague idea of checking on Joral. He was sitting in a meditation posture in the doorway of the shelter he shared with Dllenahkh. I hesitated when I saw him, not wanting to disturb him, especially given the mental turmoil he had so recently experienced. I must have trodden too heavily, however, for he opened his eyes and stared at me. First Officer Delarua, he said. Joral. Are you well? I asked formally and in Sadiri. I am well, he replied in a steady voice. Before I could exhale in relief, he continued, But Councillor Dllenahkh will not get up. Beg pardon? I said in Standard, genuinely confused as to his meaning. Still speaking Sadiri, Joral tried for greater precision. It is possible that he is awake, but his eyes are not open, he is not moving, and his mindhis mind is closed. I stood still, completely at a loss. What do you want me to do? I do not know, he replied with simple honesty. Nasiha, Tarik I began. He would not wish them to see him like this. Something about the way he said it gave me a clue. This has happened before, I accused him, a statement, not a question. He nodded, stood up, and stepped aside, leaving the way clear for me to enter. I stared at him then went in slowly, not knowing what to expect. Dllenahkh lay on his side in the narrow government-issue cot, not quite fetal but certainly curled into himself, the blanket pulled up to just below a bare shoulder. There were signs that he was awake. The firm grip of his left hand on his right wrist, the tension around his eyes as his eyelids pressed tightly closed, and his shallow, uneven breathing all spoke of distress. I knelt by his head, too astonished to feel awkward. Dllenahkh? Will you get up? Feeble, I know, but amazingly it got a response. I am tired, he said slowly. Leave me alone. For some reason, I dont think I should, I replied. To my own incredulous ears, my voice sounded as ordinary as if discussing an inspection checklist. I think you should get up and come for a walk with me. He remained still for a while, but his eyes opened, though they kept looking carefully past me. I glanced around for something to help restart the conversation and saw an undershirt and tunic neatly folded nearby. Trust a Sadiri to have a breakdown but still not neglect the small domestic rituals. Heres your shirt, I said inanely. Lets put it on, shall we? Still looking away, he heaved a great sigh and sat up slowly. He allowed me to maneuver the undershirt over his head, then heavily moved his arms to finish putting it on. His hair was mussed, and I resisted the urge to pat it back into place. Whats happened to you? I whispered. Overextended myself, he mumbled. So much anger back there. So tiring to keep it out. I knew there was more to it than that, but I said nothing, only handed him the tunic and looked around for his boots. There, I said at last with a weak attempt at cheerfulness. Youre all ready. Lets go. Joral joined us as we came outside, discreetly ignoring his superiors rumpled appearanceor so I thought. Then I realized he was distracted by Lian. Already dressed, the Commissioners aide was trotting past with biosensor in hand. Somethings tripped a perimeter alarm, Lian explained. Fergus is on it, but he wanted a sensor reading to be sure. I was glad for the diversion. We could pretend we were still functional when lurching from crisis to crisis; it was the time for quiet and introspection that was dangerous. We jogged along behind, following Lian up a low hill to where Fergus was already in place, half kneeling with his pistol held point down but ready. He gestured for us to approach cautiously. I didnt see it at first against the blond color of the grass, but then it moveda short-haired animal rather like a wild dog in size and shape. The creature snuffled around briefly, tossed its head in the air as if sneezing from the dust, and then turned away to lope down the other side of the hill. Joral was the first to unfreeze. Mute, expressionless, he simply turned around and quickly went back the way we had come. I watched him go, frowning in puzzlement. Wild dog? Lian asked in hushed tones. Savanna dog. Ive never seen one before, but I hear they show up sometimes in this region, Fergus said. They shouldnt be any trouble as long as we dont bother their pups. The two Science Council officers came rushing up the hill with Joral, biosensors at the ready. We followed them as they swept ahead for readings, followed them right to the sloping crest of the hill, and crouched there, obedient to their silent, frantic hand signals. I peeked through the coarse grass that fringed the crumbling edge and saw them: a small pack of dogs comfortably at home in the den they had made, sheltered and safe in the cleft of a small valley. No, said Dllenahkh. His voice sounded so strange that I looked at him sharply, immediately afraid that he was slipping into that frozen depression again. He felt my concerned gaze and turned to me. No, he repeated with the most brilliant and beautiful smile that I never expected to see on a Sadiri. Not a savanna dog. Sadiri. Look. He gazed down intently into the valley, and one by one, first adults and then pups, they went from a panting, relaxed demeanor to closed-jawed alertness. Their noses pointed inquiringly at the airWho? Who? Then they looked at Dllenahkh, looked straight at him through all the brush and grass. Their jaws relaxed once more as if grinning in welcome, and their short whiplike tails thumped the ground and whisked the grass in slow, cautious approval. Sadiri dogs, so far from home, murmured Dllenahkh. The taSadiri must have brought them. So few remain now. The Science Council keeps them under protection. Nasiha and Tarik did not once take their eyes off the scene below them, nor did they set down their biosensors, but their free hands met and clasped together with a quiet passion that was like a promise. Jorals face was more conflicted: subtle shades of anger and grief mingled with awe and gratitude. Dllenahkhthe first brilliance had faded, tempered with sorrowful acceptance, but still he smiled. I dont know how long the team stayed on the hillthe Cygnians watching the Sadiri, the Sadiri watching the dogs. I left them there and went for a short walk and a cry before going back to camp. I wanted to be the first to tell Dr. Daniyel all about it when she woke up.          HAPPY FAMILIES So, I said to Qeturah, I have this friend She gave me a smile. It was the classic opening line for any counseling session. Go on, she prompted. Well, theyve got some fairly strict ethics about stuff liketelepathy and emotional control and such. They feel pretty strongly about it. Thing is, theyve had to deal with a situation where someone was operating without those ethics. I see, she said. Did they feel vulnerable in this situation? Maybe they did. Maybe they felt they were strong enough to handle any direct attack. But I think whats worse is that they felt responsible for others who might be hurt by this person. The person without the ethical standards, she queried. Yes. Because no one else seemed to think that there was anything wrong with how that person was behaving. Maybe they couldnt see it, or maybe they thought it was normal. I dont know. I think Im kind of afraid to ask. What do you want for your friend? she asked quietly. I want them to feellike they dont always have to be responsible for other people. Like its okay to not be the strong one all the time. Maybe even okay to ask for help. She was silent for a while. Well, she said carefully, you can let your friend know that if they ever want to ask for help, Im here to listen, I wont judge, and I have ways of getting things done without breaching confidentiality. I swallowed, feeling a thickness in my throat. Yes, maam. Thank you. I hope I can get my friend to come talk to you directly. Some people might think its kind of strange having your boss also be your doctor and psychiatrist, but we were a small team and Qeturah was a very good small-team leader. She took an interest in everyone, and she knew instinctively which voice to use and which hat to wear in which context. There were a lot of hats to juggle over the next few days. Central Government wanted the Sadiri and the Commissioner to come in for an inquiry about the situation in Candir, which remained volatile. The day after the flight from Candir, we were off to Ophir, the nearest town with full facilities for teleconferencing. Dllenahkh gave his brief testimony first. There was a Sadiri savant among the investigators, and though he spoke little, he looked at Dllenahkh as if cataloging any and every sign of unusual behavior. Superficially, Dllenahkh seemed fine to me apart from an air of constant preoccupation, yet I was aware that unexpectedly discovering a much-loved breed of hometown fauna isnt really what you might call a complete cure. That Sadiri savant must have seen something I missed, because during the tea break, Qeturah was kept in for a brief private consultation that then turned into orders for me. Delarua, you know the Montserrat region pretty well? she said as soon as she emerged from the meeting room. Ive got some family there; why? I asked. Instinct honed by years of experience in the Civil Service made me drain my teacup and reach for an extra slice of cake to add to my napkin. It was good cake, and I didnt want a little thing like duty getting in the way of enjoying it. I want you to go with Councillor Dllenahkh to the Benedictine monastery at Montserrat. Theyve got a Sadiri priest and some monks housed there, and theyll help him realign his nodes or reverse his polarity or whatever it is he needs done to him. Fergus will fly you in today and pick you up Sunday afternoon. Serendipity and guilt knocked jointly on my conscience. Umits a silent monastery. Do you need me to stay there with him or just take him there? Qeturah frowned slightly. I thought he was your friend. I want to have someone nearby to check on him, and youre a familiar face. We cant spare Joral; hes got all the reports of their meetings. I felt even guiltier. No, I didnt meanWhat I meant was, d you mind if I take a couple of days to visit my sister? Ill make sure Dllenahkh can reach me at any time, and Ill get her to drive me back to the monastery the day before Fergus returns for us. I bit my tongue. I hoped she wouldnt think I was just taking advantage, though in a way I was, but it was for a good cause, an appropriate cause, even. Her face cleared. Of course. All my familys in Tlaxce, and I keep forgetting what its like when your kin are farther afield. Take a couple of days. Just dont miss that shuttle. No, maam, I said in relief. She glanced down at my stash of cake with a smile. And yes, I do want you to leave immediately. The half-hour trip was fairly quiet. I spent the first ten minutes of it psyching myself up, then excused myself to go to a monitor at the back of the shuttle and call my sister. Just to be sure, I called her personal communicator first, not her house comm. She answered in seconds, audio only. Identify, she said, her tone offhand and slightly rushed. Of course. I was calling from a general government comm, so my ID wouldnt show up. Maria, its Grace. How are you? Howre the children? There was a slight, shocked pause, and the video flipped on. She hadnt changed too much. A little fuller around the face, maybe, but I wasnt going to tell her that. Grace? How are you! Where are you! My goodness, its not a birthday or a special occasionwhats happening? I smiled. At least she seemed happy to see me. Works happening. Ill be in Montserrat for a few days. Think I could pop by for a quick visit? Yes! Her response was breathless and wholeheartedly sincere. The children will be so happy to see you, especially Rafi, and Ioan is always complaining that you never come by. My heart lightened. It was going to be just fine. Well, then, dont tell them; let me surprise them! Is it all right if I land in the backyard inohabout three hours time? She began to giggle. Sure! Oh, this is amazing! I cant believe it. Oh! There was a voice in the background. She turned suddenly, one hand reaching out to swiftly kill the vid. Nothing, dear! Coming in a moment! She whispered hastily, audio-only. Must go! See you soon! Bye! Then the link died. I sighed, smiling slightly. Blood is blood, you know? Theres too much shared history and too many cross-connecting bonds to ever totally extract yourself from that half-smothering, half-supporting, muddled net called family. Speaking of which Dllenahkh, I said, coming back to my seat at the front of the shuttle. Im going to abandon you for a couple of days, but you have my comm ID and you can call me any time. You know that, right? He gave me a vaguely bemused look. I have the comm IDs of all the members of the mission team. However, given that I am going to a monastery, the chances of anything happening over the next two days that I should need to report are I know, I know, I interrupted with a grin. However vanishingly small a chance it might be, you can call me, okay? He paused and seemed to recollect something, then graciously said, Thank you. And you may call me as well, should you wish to do so. I was warmed by his awkward little dip into small talk for the sake of courtesy. When we landed, a part of me almost expected the Sadiri priest to come flying out, grab Dllenahkh by the head, look deeply into his eyes, and exclaim, My God, get this man to a meditation chamber, stat! Cant you see his rudimentary telepathic integument is about to disintegrate? Or not. But the image almost made me giggle, which would have been unfortunate. Of course, it was all very sedate and proper. I was intrigued that the Sadiri monks didnt seem very distinct from the Benedictines. Their garb was different, but there was no separate building, no invisible bisecting line that said Here be Sadiri. The Cygnian guestmaster and his Sadiri counterpart showed us where Dllenahkh would be quartered, took us to the refectory for a little refreshment, and then saw Fergus and me to the door, where we bade Dllenahkh farewell. The flight to the homestead took less than ten minutes. I asked Fergus to set me down a little way from the main house so that the noise of the engines wouldnt alert them. Fittingly enough, that meant I had the chance to run into one of my most favorite people in the world, my thirteen-year-old nephew Rafi. He was coming from the direction of the orchard, carrying a bucket of starfruit. At first he squinted at me in a very puzzled way, then recognition transformed his face into a wide-eyed, open-mouthed shout of happiness as he dropped the bucket and ran toward me. His exuberant warmth blew out uncontrolled like a hot gust of savanna wind, singeing me with a burning yet benign energy that matched his rough boy hug. Rafi has always been a beautiful boy, with his mothers amber-brown skin, his fathers wavy brown and blond-streaked hair, and big brown eyes from both parents. Hes also my godson, and I adore him. Hed write me long letters filled with sketches and stories and send them by post that took at least a week to arrive. Id always write back immediately, usually sending a small memory disk with games and other entertainment that I knew hed enjoy. I doubted his parents were aware how often we corresponded. He had begged me not to tell them, and I indulged him, secretly glad to be the favorite aunt. I dreamed that wed go traveling together when he was older and I was retired and properly eccentric. Wed ride elephants in the savanna, or join the crew of a sailing ship, or something. It felt silly to say it, so I never did, but I always felt like Id never want any children of my own as long as I had Rafi. You havent come to see me in ages, he complained, tugging me by the hand to the main house. Well, Im here now. I laughed. Boy, go get that fruit. You cant leave the bucket lying in the road so. He gave a grimace and went to quickly gather up the scattered fruit. I snagged one from the bucket as he came back. There had been mangoes under the starfruit, and I hadnt had a proper Montserrat mango in years. It was warm and fragrant when I held it to my cheek. Ahh, I sighed. If you came to visit me more often, you could have as many of those as you liked, Rafi said pointedly. I smiled at him, pleased at his clean, honest indignation, mock persuasion, and adolescent sarcasm. I love you too, boy. Maybe I should move to Tlaxce, he hinted as we walked on to the house. Maybe you should, I said, even more pleased. As if Maria would let her golden boy out of sight, but at least he had thought about it. Maria came onto the veranda wearing a blue cotton dress, looking very matronly and homely with little Gracie clinging to her side, still sucking a thumb. She looked older than me, older in a way that only two children and homestead living can accomplish, but happy, both happy to see me and happy in general. I hugged her hard and tousled Gracies hair affectionately. She looked a bit too shy to hug just yet. She didnt really know me. Oh, Grace, Maria sighed as she smiled at me and ushered me inside. Only two days? Im lucky its even that much, I said, letting Rafi take my small bag. The living room was full of memories, all stuff my mother had handed over when she gave up the homestead after Papas death and retired to a condo on Tlaxce Lake. Look whos here, Ioan! Maria called out. He came into the room, dusty and sweat-streaked from working outside. He wore his hair longer, brushing his shoulders, the gilt bands in the seal brown even more fiercely bleached by the sun. He was still lean, still handsome, still golden. He had been my fianc once. My heart stumbled as a flood of half-remembered yearning seemed to pour out from him and envelop me. His eyes glowed with an inhuman warmth, and I thought I heard a whisper in his voiceShadi. A strong memory to echo so loudly. Hello, Ioan, I said, and smiled proudly at how ordinary I sounded. Shadi, he said, breaking out into a huge, radiant smile. Hed always called me by my middle name. In a few quick steps he reached me and hugged me, picking me up half a meter from the ground in his fervor. You came back. I knew youd comeback. Well, I said breathlessly, looking over his shoulder at Marias beaming face, just for a little while. He stepped back suddenly, looking anxiously at my uniform. Man, Im filthy. Sorry about that. He brushed at a few reddish stains on my shirt and trousers where the clay soil had transferred and left its mark. Dont worry. Time I changed out of this, anyway, I said, gently pushing away his hands. After changing clothes, I started for the kitchen, hearing the familiar clatter of meal preparation. As I passed the door to the small pantry, something made me turn my head. There was Gracie, standing on a stepladder, glaring at the top shelf, where a cookie jar sat just out of her reach. What are you doing up there? Come! I demanded. She tumbled from the stepladder into my outstretched arms for a hug. I squeezed her skinny four-year-old frame with a gleeful grin. She may not have been my favorite, but she was my namesake and it was early days. Maybe if she learned to write long letters Hey, you two. The voice was close enough to make me jump. Ioan stood behind me and wrapped his arms around both of us, bending past my cheek to smack a kiss on his daughters forehead. The slight stubble of his jaw grazed my skin. I took a half step sideways, trying to keep our bodies from brushing together. He didnt seem to notice, or care, because he moved with me in a slight sway, appearing to relish the lengthy embrace. Two of my favorite girls, he murmured, then finally let go. I turned around and set Gracie in his arms. Ill go see if Maria needs any help with dinner. He put Gracie down. Sweetie, go see if your mother needs any help. She dashed off silently. Shes so obedient, I said accusingly. Did she even have the terrible twos stage? Not really, no, Ioan said, looking after her with a smile. Not like her mother, then. She drove me mad when she was two. Shadi, he said, and that was all he said, but something in the tone made me duck my head down and walk to the door, which, unfortunately, meant going past him. He seized me by the wrist. Shadi, look at me. No, Ioan. That doesnt work on me, remember? I tugged my hand free and kept going, trying to ignore the echo in my headShadiShadi. At dinner, Maria kept talking about how long it had been. The first few times, it was heartwarming, but then it became almost nagging. When she started talking about how I could have stayed a homesteader rather than going to university, Rafi and I exchanged weary, eye-rolling looks. Maria missed it and made the mistake of trying to enlist Rafis help. Rafis always talking about how much he misses you, arent you, dear? Wouldnt you like it if Auntie Grace lived with us on the homestead? I was startled. How did we get from visiting more often to moving in entirely? I think she should live her own life, Rafi muttered. Maria was furious. Rafi! You apologize to your aunt right now! Its all right, Maria, he Ioan overrode my protests. Your mothers right. Apologize. Rafi glared at him. Youre always messing things up. I hate you! Now I was shocked. Rafi! He pushed away from the table and stood up, giving me a look that was both anguish and reproach. Then he shook his head in frustration and ran out of the room. Little Gracie looked wide-eyed from parent to parent, jaws motionless, her last mouthful still bulging in her cheeks. Teenagers, Ioan said carelessly with a reassuring smile, smoothing his daughters hair. They hate everybody at that age. He looked at me, still smiling. His foot gently bumped mine under the table, and for a full second I didnt feel inclined to pull away. Then something buzzed on my wrist, distracting me. I slapped at it absently, and it went away. I kept up my mask of indifference pretty well, but that night Ioan haunted my dreams in a way he hadnt done in years. Memories and might-have-beens tangled in a mad jumble. I remembered how it felt when our hearts and minds came together at a time when I thought I love you meant forever. I dreamed I had never left; I was in Marias place, and Rafi was truly my son. It made me angry and confused. The ability to know anothers mind does not preclude the likelihood of misunderstanding it. That was true. I knew that all too well, and thats why I hadnt married him. Then why was I dreaming about him again? I avoided him by spending more time with Maria. It was her Id come to see, anyway. If anyone had asked me what I was looking for, I couldnt have answered them. Some things you know more by intuition than by reasoning. I told myself that I just wanted to be reassured that Maria was happy and Ioan was behaving himself, but to tell the truth, her unwavering contentedness was beginning to aggravate me. What with that and the dreams, mostly I just felt guilty and mad at myself. Then one afternoon, after a large Sunday lunch, when we were sitting in the living room with the children sprawled on the carpet playing cards, Maria tried a little too hard. You know, we could use another pair of hands on the homestead, Maria said. Youre helping those Sadiri with their homesteadings. Dont you think family should come first? Her smile was oddly fixed. I frowned a bit at that. Why would you say that? You know its not like that. Then explain it to me. Here you have people who love you, who want you to be part of the family, and you act like you can barely stand to see us! Her voice cracked. Rafi stiffened, not looking at her but listening hard. Gracie stood up and went to stare out of the window. Ioan sat straighter and made a movement as if about to rest a pacifying hand on his wifes shoulder, then seemed to decide against it. Maria, youre not making sense! I said, aghast that she looked on the edge of tears. Whats the matter with you? You can have him if you want, you know. Thats the only thing keeping you away. You can have Ioan, she cried out, right in front of the children and all. I was thunderstruck. Then, when she finally burst into tears, I knew. Ioan went to her, speaking to her quietly. She got up and left the room without looking at anyone, and after a moment, still silent and expressionless, Gracie followed her. Rafi stayed, eyes wide with something like fear as he stared at his father. I knew how he felt as I too stared at Ioan. That was you. I know that was you. I got up and backed away from him. I didnt mean for her to get that intense. She always was a little too susceptible, Ioan replied with a sad, sweet smile. You bastard, I said. I warned you: if you hurt her, if you hurt any of my family, I will deal with you! Im not hurting them, he protested. I take good care of them. Theyre happy. Happy little puppets, I spat, gripping my right wrist in an effort not to slap him. I should report you to the authorities. You wont, he said simply. You love me. Never stopped. It doesnt work on me, Ioan. It never did, and thats why you couldnt keep me. That and a small problem you have with honesty. You like life to be easy, dont you, with everything and everyone exactly as you like. It was just a mistake, Shadi, but I do love you. I shouldnt have given up on us. I want you to stay. We all do. Cant you see that? He was pleading now, using words and gestures alone, unpracticed and desperate. My gaze rested on the one person in the room I trusted. He looked up at me helplessly. Rafi loves me so much that hes willing to let me go, I said. Thats what I see. Rafi jumped up and grabbed my hand, and we ran out of the house. I didnt know where we were supposed to be running to or why, but it seemed like a good idea to get as far away from Ioan as possible. Unfortunately, when I glanced back, I saw that he was right behind us, moving at a leisurely pace, knowing we had nowhere to go. But Rafi knew where to go, and in a little while a growing, humming vibration that had been pressing on my ears turned into a recognizable noise. It was the shuttle, landing once more in the field near the orchard. Fergus disembarked first, looking moody and suspicious as usual. Dllenahkh followed. He wore a novices robe with the hood up, which I thought rather suited him and gave him a very peaceful air. They came walking briskly toward us over the grass. Dllenahkh looked almost relieved to see me. We have been calling you for some time. Did you forget our departure date? I looked at the comm on my wrist. Fourteen missed callswhen the hell did that happen? And was it really Sunday already? Fergus, Dllenahkh, Im sorry! My comm must have malfunctioned, and then I forgot. I dont know what to say. Ioan came to my rescue. Im sorry. The reception out here is so variable. And weve been completely monopolizing herits no wonder she forgot. No problem, Fergus said. Were hours early. The Commissioner wont expect us till evening. I looked at him anxiously. His face was relaxed, smiling even, in fact, completely unlike him. I can leave now if you like, I said, suddenly frantic. Fergus waved a hand. No worries. Stay a while with your family. I can run the Councillor back to Ophir now, pick you up whenever you like. Its only a half-hour trip. An hour round trip, I tried to remind him, a firmness to my voice that I did not feel. I felt hemmed in and scared. I wouldnt want to keep the Councillor waiting, hinted Ioan helpfully. Dllenahkh, who had been silent for all of this, quietly put back his hood and stared at Ioan. No. I dont think so. Ioan literally faltered, taking a step back. Dllenahkh continued to look sternly at him, then rested a hand on Ferguss shoulder, an uncharacteristically tactile gesture. Sergeant Fergus, would you be so kind as to go start up the shuttle? Fergus blinked, nodded slowly, and went back inside the shuttle. Rafi looked up at Dllenahkh with an expression of immense relief and gratitude. Ill go get her stuff. Thank you, said Dllenahkh, inclining his head. His gaze followed the boy as he ran off, then returned to fix coldly on Ioan. Rafi soon returned, out of breath, with my bag. I took it from him and made an impossible promise. Itll be all right. Ill make it right, I swear. He nodded, his eyes bright with tears, and ran back into the house. I gave Ioan one glance, then retreated to the shuttle with Dllenahkh at my back. He gave Fergus the order to lift off, then faced me with a very somber look. I apologize. I should have realized earlier that you needed help. I was breathing more easily as I looked out the window and watched the homestead getting farther away. Its all right. Ioan knows he cant get to me. I just wish I could do something for Maria. Its not right, the way he treats her. Then you should report him, Dllenahkh said, his tone adamant. I understand that there are procedures for dealing with Cygnians who have strong psi abilities and use them inappropriately. He does love her, I mumbled. And they might take Gracie and Rafi away from themthat would be horrible. Nevertheless, Dllenahkh said gently, he was prepared to force you to stay with them. Can you overlook that? He knows he cant get to me, I repeated sulkily. I would have gotten out of there. Not being ungrateful for your help or anything. I just dont think its serious enough to warrant a report. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Fergus give Dllenahkh a quick sideways glance. Delarua, look at me. Dllenahkhs voice was still gentle, but there was a hint of steel in it. I faced him angrily. Dont you Delarua me. I told you, I can handle it! Then let us be sure. Let me touch your mind, a brief touch only, to be certain that he has not influenced you. A sick feeling shot through me. I stood up and stumbled to the back of the shuttle. Keep away from me, I whispered, turning my head so they couldnt see the tears starting. Delarua Dllenahkh said again, implacable. Dont touch me, dont you dare come near me Delarua! This time it was Fergus, shouting over his shoulder from the pilots seat. This isnt you! Cant you see that? You have to trust the Councillor, because I am not setting down this shuttle until I know for a fact that you are in your right mind! He heaved a frustrated breath and continued. Ive been through training for this kind of thing, learning to recognize when someones tampered with your thoughts. And let me tell you, that man back there? Hes subtle. Hes good. Ive never known a Cygnian that could do what he did just now. Dont underestimate him. I slumped to the floor. I wanted it all locked up in my mind: the dreams, my secret longings. I thought about the shame it would bring on my family to have all this known. I pulled my knees up to my chest and pressed my fists into my eyes, struggling to be calm, to breathe deeply, to think clearly. When I lowered my hands and opened my eyes, Dllenahkh was kneeling in front of me. His face was neutral, with no trace of judgment. I spoke softly. A brief touch only? You wont look at my thoughts, my memories? He nodded. A brief touch. Not an invasion, not a link. Only what you permit. I bowed my head. A moment later, I felt his fingertips brush my forehead and press firmly as if setting his fingerprints there. Then they withdrew. That was all. I looked up, relieved. There! Thats taken care of Then it came flooding back. All the times Id silenced my own comm, the forced surge of an old passion long laid to rest, dreams that were not of my minds making, and every look of disappointment and despair that poor Rafi had given me. That bastard, I choked out. That bastard! Dllenahkh stood up and backed away gracefully. Adrenaline pushed me to my feet, and I slammed the wall behind me with a fist. Fergus, how much longer to Ophir? Twelve minutes, maam, he said. The words sounded as if they were coming through a savage grin. I marched back to my seat. Make it five. I need to speak to the Commissioner as soon as possible. Dllenahkh returned to his seat beside me. I looked at him steadily, still feeling that slick veneer of shame over my thoughts but refusing to give in to it. And Dllenahkhthank you. He only inclined his head in response, but I imagined I saw a hint of approval amid his neutrality. I didnt know why he was being so generous. He had gone straight into the heart of a brewing riot with nothing but his principles to arm and shield him. I was finally standing up for the truth after fifteen years wasted in equivocation. Yes, equivocation. It was still my call, still my responsibility. If there was one thing that shook me after Ioans influence was wiped from my mind, it was the realization that he never manipulated an emotion that wasnt already present to some degree, no matter how small. I remembered this as I went to Qeturah. It helped keep my anger and motivation high. I went straight to where she was sitting in the conference room, going over the last of the inquiry notes with Joral, Nasiha, and Tarik. She looked up at me. Im here to talk to you directly. My throat closed up, making my voice crack, but I gritted my teeth and pushed the words past the barrier. I have a problem, and I need your help. Zero hour plus one year one month nine days Dllenahkh stood on the main balcony of the hotel and regarded the city streets and distant banlieues of Ophir, dreamlike in a haze of damp morning air. He breathed lightly not merely to avoid the moisture but to keep the last of the calming air of the Montserrat monastery deep in his lungs. It had been unusually difficult to put aside the novice robe the night before. Footsteps approached, but he did not turn. Eventually Dr. Daniyel stood beside him and rested her hands lightly on the dew-damp stone of the balustrade. Recognizing the diffidence in the gesture, he merely offered a nod of greeting and waited for her to speak. Thank you for helping her, she said quietly. We didnt know. He frowned slightly as he looked at her. We are all of us somewhat damaged, whether or not it may appear on our medical records. She took the gentle rebuke with a rueful smile. I have withdrawn my recommendation that you be removed from the mission team, she informed him. I understand now that the circumstances were unusual, and I trust your ability to function in the future. He bowed his head and lowered his eyes. He did not want to seem rude, but neither did he wish to appear grateful. He settled for staring at the landscape again. First Officer Delarua is insisting that she too is able to continue in her role. Dr. Daniyel spread her hands palms upward. Im not convinced, but I dont like to make the same mistake twice. Theres also the question of her psi profile. He frowned in earnest. I have seen it. It does not match her demonstrated abilities. In light of recent events, no. Cygnians have always been hard to assess. Youd expect something with Ntshune, Sadiri, and Zhinuvian lineage, but some of the strangest things come out of Terraa touch of second sight here, a little miracle there. Most of them are charlatans, its true, but even the simple power to persuade and be persuaded can be a psi ability. Were very good at fooling othersand fooling ourselves. She shook her head, momentarily pensive, then added, Id like you to keep an eye on her not only professionally but personally. He let his surprise show. She trusts you, Dr. Daniyel said. He faced her fully. Does she trust you? She let the rhetorical question pass, her gaze flickering away as if her conscience had been touched. He would have withdrawn once more into quiet courtesy, but the small glimpse of vulnerability made him push harder. Tell me, Commissioner, have you had this same conversation with Delarua? Have you asked her to keep an eye on me? Have you told her that I trust her? She relaxed and laughed lightly. Of course not, Councillor. Dont be silly. I had that conversation with Joral. He smiled in spite of himself, conceding the point. Councillor, she said, gracious in victory, and walked away, leaving him to enjoy the morning view.          BACCHANAL Why me? I asked. I mean, I know youve told me, but tell me again why this is supposed to be a good idea? Tarik gave me a look that suggested that he found my nervousness absurd. Your updated psi profile indicates that you have developed an above-average ability to discern and suppress imposed emotions. The Board of Inquiry has recommended that we add psi-profile data to our genetic and anthropological data, Nasiha continued equably, waving a scanner of some sort over the tiny sensors stuck to my various pulse points and nerve nodes and whatchamacallits. We require Cygnian as well as Sadiri data to calibrate our readings, Tarik resumed. You are the only Cygnian with an operable level of psionic ability on the team. Therefore, you have been assigned to us for testing purposes. Thank you, Qeturah, I muttered sarcastically. Now, what are these for? I waved a hand at four injectors laid out with precision on a tray of implements. To inform you of their contents and effects would compromise the neutrality of the tests, Nasiha said in a tone that was almost soothing, which only increased my worry. Try to relax, added Tarik, easing the medtable from vertical to nearly horizontal with a swiftness that had me gripping the edges. The two Sadiri watched the readouts for a while, looked at each other, and nodded. Nasiha picked up the first injector and pressed it against my arm. I gulped quietly as it hissed its contents into my bloodstream. Seconds passed. Well, I said, slightly relieved, Im not sure what Then I screamed. After an hour spent alternately laughing, weeping, screaming, and mumbling Whoacool! I went to Qeturah to complain. She refused to be swayed. Psionic ability results from a combination of nature and nurture. It cant be measured using genetic data alone, and its an intrinsic part of what it means to be Sadiri. We need this information. Yes, but why me? I asked plaintively. I never scored particularly high on psi tests before. Cant they use some average readings from the database? Qeturah shrugged. This particular method of testing has never been done before. There is no data. Fine, I snapped. Only a few days had passed since Ophir, and already we were back in savanna country, this time at a Division of Forestry and Grasslands outpost that offered a little more comfort than a temporary camp. The aim was to prevent another Candir fiasco through better preparation, and that meant taking an extra week or two to refine our mission brief before continuing to the next assignment on the schedule. Qeturah was working feverishly on documentation with Lians assistance, Fergus was acquiring all kinds of new and exciting survival equipment and regionally appropriate advice from the rangers, Dllenahkh and Joral seemed to be spending an inordinate amount of time in meditation, and Nasiha and Tarik were torturing me. Then Dllenahkh turned up at the next session. Please tell me youre not here to add to my misery, I said with mock cheerfulness. He shot a look at Nasiha and Tarik that didnt reassure me, then sat down beside the medtable. You have found the experience thus far to be intolerable? I struggled with myself. It could have been worse, but really, not having your own emotions under control is pretty miserable, yeah. His mouth twitchedI swear I saw it! But his face was dead calm a moment later, and he said, We apologize for not previously detailing the nature of the experiment to you. However, we had the approval of the Commissioner to He trailed off, constrained by the habit of truth, and amended, The Commissioner conveyed to us the permission of the government to carry out these tests. Thanks for that, I said quietly. I had an inkling Qeturah doesnt really like my involvement in this. She thinks I should be getting therapy. Dllenahkh held my gaze for the precise amount of time necessary to warn me that I should take his next words very, very seriously. And you have refused therapy. I matched his neutral tone. Id have to leave the mission for that. Besides, fifteen years of functioning wont break down in a few months. It can wait. I believe they had hoped to counsel and treat you, your sister, and her children as a family unit. It can wait, I repeated. Some things might go better if Im not there. Now, you were about to tell me whats going on here? He looked away, withdrawing for the moment, and picked up an injector. A simplified explanation will suffice. The contents of these injectors have been designed to stimulate or suppress one of the two ranges of the limbic system that contribute to emotion. One range has satisfaction at one extreme and dysphoria at the other. The other range varies from frenzy to lethargy. The first range is additionally complicated by the fact that it actually consists of two separate scales of pleasure and pain that overlap in the lower values. For example, the emotion categorized as anticipation consists of small elements of pleasure, caused by looking forward to the moment of satisfaction; pain, caused by the fact of the present absence of satisfaction; and frenzy, manifested as an urge to seek out the aforementioned satisfaction. I blinked. Thats fascinating. Complicated little buggers, arent we? Indeed. Incidentally, it is not only those of Terran or Ntshune origin who experience this. It appears to be common, by one physiological mechanism or another, in all humans. I think I felt a mingling of mild pleasure, pain, and frenzy at that point. That was the first specific bit of information hed given me about Sadiri neurology, and I was hoping hed say more. He didnt. At present, Cygnian psi-profile tests are designed to detect levels of ability that could significantly impact a persons capacity to function in a largely nonpsionic society. Strong telepaths and empaths are provided with training and a system of ethics to regulate the use of their skills. Most Cygnians are not at the level where this is required. Including me, I said with a frown. So why am I here on this medtable being pumped full of different kinds of crazy juice? Because there are other aspects of psionic ability that the tests do not address, Nasiha interrupted. For example, we have discovered from monitoring our own reactions that you are capable of quite strong empathic projection in two very specific areas. I grinned. I bet I can guess one. Pleasure, right? Yes. That is the stronger one. When your pleasure range was stimulated, Nasiha and I both experienced a strong desire to laugh that was only mitigated by increasing the shielding on our telepathic receptors. Tariks face was so deadly serious, almost mournful, as he admitted this that I had to bite back a laugh. Less intense but still significant was the projection of lethargy, Nasiha continued. I stared at her, taken aback. I bore people? You calm people, Dllenahkh said diplomatically. But it is a much subtler effect. I contemplated the ceiling for a while, processing this. Okay. So how does discerning and suppressing imposed emotions come into this? Because I was completely at the mercy of those injectors, let me tell you. Dllenahkh explained further. It is difficult, if not impossible, to stop the action of chemicals introduced directly into the body. It is, however, possible to shield from external attempts to alter brain and body chemistry. That is the aim of todays session. The three Sadiri around the medtable suddenly seemed to loom with menace. Youre going to try to influence my thoughts and emotions? I squeaked. With your permission, said Dllenahkh. I thought about it. I took a good few minutes while they remained there in silence, waiting on my word. I thought about what Ioan had and had not been able to do to me. I thought about Rafi, who, I strongly suspected, possessed a similar talent to his fathers, and wondered what might become of him in the future. Knowledge is power, I said at last. Lets do it. First, because it was already there to work with, Dllenahkh tried to increase my sense of unease. It worked. I bolted upright, choking as if pulling myself out of quicksand, but then, with an indignant Hah! I exhaled my real tension, turning fear to simple discontent, and pushed back the false sensation with a feeling of triumph. My stars, youre strong. I breathed rapidly, looking at him with wide eyes. Less with the elephant feet, please. He was examining the readouts on the monitor beside my head. My apologies, he said absently. How do you feel? Please use the scales we discussed to describe your emotions. Genuinely? I was a bit up there on the frenzy scale and even a little up on the pleasure scale. You tried to project dysphoria, and it combined with the frenzy to produce fear. So I dumped the frenzy and tossed back the dysphoria. And now I feel quite up there on the pleasure scale, thank you very much. Remarkable, said Dllenahkh. It was better than therapy in a way. While the Sadiri were getting their data and creating their new tests, I was finding out what my strengths were. For example, it seemed that I was even able to control my real emotions far better than youd expect from the way I usually behave. Id just rarely had need to do so, but the proof of it was how I had been able to not only switch off Ioans attempts to make me feel comfortable with him but also damp down my own inclination to feel that comfort. Telepathically, though, I had no talent whatsoever. I could be influenced into doing all manner of nonsensical, trivial things and rationalizing them afterward, like the time I randomly picked up an injector and aimed it at Nasiha, who, fortunately, was agile and aware enough to leap out of the way. If she hadnt shot Dllenahkh a very nasty look for that trick, I would have sworn it was all my idea. Which brings me to another point. I never saw Sadiri the way others do, as being in complete control of their facial expressions. It became clear to me that although I would never have the level of telepathy to fully sense them as they did one another, I did have a level of empathy to detect the emotions that they did not express, though I interpreted it as a physical expression. I once had a raging argument with Lian over the simple premise Joral smiles at you all the time. Lian swore I was crazy; I swore Lian was oversensitive about being the object of a Sadiri crush. Now I understand that Lian honestly couldnt see that faint hint of a smile that Id persuaded myself was there to account for my certainty that Joral derived pleasure from Lians company. Another good thing about the testing was that by the time we were ready to leave, I had acquired some respect for Nasiha and Tarik. They were wrapped up in each otherwell, fair enough. Theirs was one of the few bonds not broken by the disaster, and they deserved to celebrate that. But their professionalism and skill were incontestable, and their dedication to rebuilding Sadiri culture absolute. I found that admirable. Because the settlement we were visiting consisted of widely scattered homesteadings much like the Sadiri one in Tlaxce, we had arranged our schedule to arrive for one of their festivals. People would be gathering at a public area called the Grand Savannah over a period of two days. Initially, we had planned to spend time at one of the major homesteadings and conclude our visit with the festival, but because of the delay we were going to do it the other way around. Our first sight of the Grand Savannah was a long, high berm with an arched entrance cut into the center. Underneath the arch ran a road of flagstones. We came in government vehicles with a wagonload of gear, having left the shuttle at the outpost. Inside the earth-walled enclosure was a huge field with a tent city, the colors so bright and the designs so varied that it looked like a scattering of kites on the ground waiting to take flight. There were rangers there acting as marshals, and they pointed us to a space where we could set up our camp. We hadnt been there more than fifteen minutes before a visitor arrived. Welcome to the Grand Savannah! Do I have the honor of addressing Dr. Qeturah Daniyel, head of this government mission and renowned academic in her own right? The words were measured, even stately, but there was hidden laughter in the tone. When I saw the speaker and the suppressed smile and almost wink that passed between him and Qeturah, I instantly had the impression of some shared encounter in the past. He was a notable man of the tall and distinguished variety, but there was something irreverent in the gleam of his eye that warned of a love of fun. Qeturah, in contrast, looked unusually shy and coquettish. Must have been some encounter. Leoval, she said, and her voice seemed richer and more resonant as she held out her hand to be kissed. Not too old for this yet? Leoval gave her a droll look of mock injury. Qeturah! What a suggestion! Introductions were made. At first, when he bent over my hand as well, I feared he was an incorrigible flirt, but when he proceeded to clasp arms with Fergus and Lian and bow to the Sadiri gravely with the appropriate phrase in perfectly accented Sadiri, I realized I was in the presence of a consummate diplomat. I was right too. He was a retired civil servant, and he had been one of the first anthropologists to revisit and update ancient research on the region. He made Qeturah promise to come visit him, telling her to send word by a marshal and he would have a sedan chair come around for her. Then, with that carefully modulated sense of courtesy, he bid his farewells and departed. What an interesting man, I said innocently. Qeturah gave me a sharp look. Yes, she replied firmly. He is. And a gentleman. He always found ways to help me without ever once mentioning the dreaded phrase Dalthis Syndrome. Like offering to send a chair for methats his kindness all over. I hesitated, then decided to speak my thought. Dalthis Syndrome? Isnt that a treatable genetic condition? Yes, it is, but Ive never liked the idea of flipping the switches on my own genes, Qeturah said in a matter-of-fact tone. Seems like cheating. I was more than surprised to hear this. It was a bit like learning your local butcher is a vegetarian. Besides, Qeturah continued calmly, for some time I had unresolved issues about being the weak one of the family. My siblings used to tease me and say no homesteader would ever marry me, because Id be as much work to take care of as the homestead and my children would probably be weaklings too. When you start thinking of yourself as damaged goods, you put up defenses to make sure no one has the chance to reject you, so I told myself I would never get married, never have children, and never do anything to change who I was. It was only after I had my own status, my own money, and the contraceptive benefits of menopause that I began to allow myself to have a different view. Playing the cards Id been dealt became my badge of honor, not a burden. I was silent for a while, almost shocked that she was being so blunt and open with me, but then my eyes narrowed and my jaw tightened slightly. I didnt realize we were in session. Im only doing what I can. Delarua, have you been in any serious relationships over the past fifteen years? Hot, sudden anger flashed through me, but I kept control of myself, merely giving her a reproachful look before I walked off to lose myself in the crowd. Stick to genetics, I called back over my shoulder. Your counselings a bit off today. Ah, look, a breakthrough, she said with a wry smile, but she let me go. Gilda had always teased me, saying that I had a talent for surrounding myself with safe or unavailable men. I used to tell her that if she understood the meaning of the word professionalism, she wouldnt have to speculate about my love life or lack thereof. But now Qeturah had me wondering, what were my Ioan-issues? When I first left, did he selfishly set something in my mind to make sure Id never get attached to someone else? Or was it my own doing; was I afraid that attracting a man like Ioan once might mean I was doomed ever after to fall for that type? Perhaps I made men possessive and manipulative, because it seemed to me that Ioan hadnt been all that bad fifteen years ago. I hated the last one in particular, because I now had empirical evidence that I could project significantly on the pleasure scale. Was I like some bad drug, ruining good men? I was growing disgusted with my own self-pity. Fortunately, a distraction immediately appeared. He walked past me with a swagger, a bottle in each hand, and in his eye a twinkle that wouldnt understand the concept of rejection if it was explained to him in nine languages and fourteen dialects. Then he paused and turned back. Im off to hear the bands. Would you like to come, my lovely? I looked at him. What he didnt have in looks he made up for in self-confidence. Yeah. Why ever not, I saidand yes, there was a little bit of Ill show them all! in my decision. The music was good. The stuff in the bottle was good. There was alcohol in there, but mainly it was surprisingly thirst-quenching in the heat yet terribly more-ish at the same time. The crowd was energetic, and there was much dancing. I lost my first acquaintance and found several more friends in succession, finally sticking with a rather nice young man called Tonio who lookedwell, maybe he looked a bit like Ioan, but only a little, okay? I forgot about the rest of the team entirely until Joral turned up where I was sprawling on the steep angle of a berm, still listening to the drums and pipes on the field below and Tonios snoring as he napped beside me. Joral looked a little apprehensive, moving as if he hoped to preserve a small exclusionary zone around himself. I watched with a smirk as two young women breached the zone, danced up against him, and moved on, leaving him frozen, as if unsure whether to be glad or appalled. Finally he pulled himself together and clambered up to where I was sitting. Enjoying yourself, Joral? I asked blandly, handing him the bottle. He looked at it blankly for a moment and then, in response to my hand gestures, tipped some of the contents carefully into his mouth. His eyes widened slightly, and he made a considering moue. Piquant and refreshing, he proclaimed, and handed it back. I am finding the experience very educational. The Commissioner informed me that she already has a significant amount of genetic data for this settlement, and while the phenotype is mostly Terran, there are sufficient taSadiri genes in the population that a combination of selection and switching could easily produce a child of Sadiri appearance and physiology. Moreover, the anthropological data clearly show that a number of Sadiri traditions have been retained. Is this festival a Sadiri tradition? I asked, having drunk and passed the bottle to him again. He took a good gulp, no longer shy, and returned it. In fact, it is not. While it does appear to have a few features of certain ancient festivitiesexcept with less blood andumother activitiesits origin is Terran, specifically the festival of Carnival. Farewell to the flesh, said my linguistic self mockingly. It needs to be followed by a fast to be true, not preceded by one. Ido not understand. I passed him the bottle once more in apology and answer. He drained it. This beverage is delicious. May I have another? I hauled another two bottles out of a nearby cooler and gave him one. He popped it open and immediately took a swig. I looked down at the Savannah. If we stay here for a couple more hours, well get to see the fire dancing. That should be good. Oh, I forgot to askdid you come to find me for a specific reason? Silence. I turned to Joral. He was contemplating the already half-empty bottle in his hand with a strange little smile. Oh. Yes. Councillor Dllenahkh wishes me to tell you that after the festival, we will have a meeting with some of the elders of the settlement. Joral, are you feeling all right? I asked, concerned at the look on his face. He turned to me and smiled fully, which completely freaked me out. I feel fine, Delarua, just fine. I wonder if I should go down and try a bit of dancing. It doesnt look that hard. I hit my comm immediately. Nasiha! Somethings wrong with Joral! Hes smiling. I think hes drunk. Nasiha spoke with her usual calm. How much has he had to drink? About four hundred mils ofsomething, I stammered, trying and failing to find enlightenment on my bottles label. Theres alcohol in it. Six percent. That is far too little to affect a Sadiri, she mused. Can he still walk? Ye-esIm not sure. Joral, stand up. He did so obligingly, canting on the incline of the berm with a stability that hinted at least at physical sobriety. I feel fine! I am standing up. Tell her I am standing up! Hmm, Nasiha said. Joral, return to the camp immediately. I escorted him back to camp, which is to say I herded him like an inexperienced sheepdog as he pinballed his way through the crowd, dancing from partner to partner. Nasiha and Tarik were waiting, and they immediately gripped him by the elbows and hustled him into one of the shelters. I followed them in time to see them wrestling him down onto a cot, still protesting that he was fine. They quickly took a blood sample, tested his breath, and looked at his eyes. Then they looked at me accusingly. This is not inebriation, said Tarik. Well, dont look at me, I wailed. Look at this! I waved the bottle at them. Yeah, thatll do it. I jumped. It was Tonio. I had been so preoccupied with Joral that I hadnt noticed when he woke up and followed us. He stood casually in the entrance of the shelter, completely unworried by the scene before him. Thatll do it, he said again. Its got fireberry juice in it. And what, said Nasiha severely, is fireberry juice? Its like another kind of alcohol, you know? Kinda takes the edge off your emotions and calms your thoughts but doesnt take out your legs or fuzz up your head. Mothers give it to their kids to settle them down, no worries. Works great on teenage boys, especially when they start to getyknow. He shrugged and flicked an expressive eyebrow upward while realigning the crotch of his trousers with a practiced cup-and-shake of his hand. Nasiha and Tarik looked at each other, then stared at Tonio. Tell us more about this fireberry juice, said Tarik. Well, here, try some. The enterprising Tonio took a small flask from his pocket and handed it to Tarik. Tarik opened the flask cautiously, poured a tiny amount into a clean sample cup, and sipped it. Intriguing, he commented. Nasiha took the cup from him and drained the remainder. Most interesting, she agreed. But this makes no sense, I complained. Why would it make Joral more emotional? Oh, forgot about that, said Tonio helpfully. Also removes inhibitions, like alcohol. Bit of a paradox. Feel less, express more. The two standing Sadiri were looking at him very curiously. This calls for further research, said Nasiha. Can you take us to someone who makes this beverage? Sure! Tonio said cheerfully. He went out, Tarik and Nasiha followed, and just as I was bringing up the rear, Nasiha turned and said pointedly to me, Someone should stay with Joral. I grimaced. Fine. Watching Joral very quickly turned into watching Joral sleep. I put him in the recovery position just in case some nasty after-reaction should occur and curled up on a nearby cot, listening bitterly to the shouts and cheers and drumbeats of the fire dance show I was missing. A shadow appeared at the entrance. Tarik? I called out, tapping on a light. No, came Dllenahkhs voice. Nasiha has just informed me about Jorals condition. How is he? I sat up and yawned and looked over at Joral. Still sleeping peacefully, it appears. Where are Nasiha and Tarik? A very strange expression came over Dllenahkhs face. It was the look of a man who had seen things he could not unsee. Dancing, he said shortly. I gaped. Beg pardon? They decided to test the effects firsthand by sampling the various beverages that contain the active ingredient. They are nowblending in. A faint, cool disapproval touched his voice. Well, good for them, I say. After all that madness they put me through, Im glad theyve got the guts to experiment on themselves. But I still dont get it. Whats the big deal about this stuff? Dllenahkh moved to pick up a handheld and came to sit beside me on the cot. Perhaps a look at the data will clarify matters. Here is a summarized form of the data collected from the sensors during your experiment. And herehe tapped and went to split-screen viewis the summary for Sadiri data. Nasiha was the test subject, naturally, in order to maintain sex as a constant variable when comparing your readings. These are Sadiri readings, I said, tracing the line of data. Those are the markers of the biochemical reactions we experience during sensory input and processing, yes. And these are mine, I said, tracing a much lower set of values. How do you live with that? I asked with muted awe. Carefully. With meditation and strict adherence to the disciplines, he replied. But without this high neural sensitivity, we could not be who we are. We would not be able to pilot the mindships, nor could we sense one another, communicate with one another, form telepathic bonds with one another. I gave a slow nod of admiration. Now that youve discovered the properties of fireberry, will you use it as an alternative to meditation? It may serve for recreational use, but I do not believe it is to be depended on in the long run. One might find oneself in a situation where the ingredients are not available. However, the disciplines can be taken anywhere that the mind goes. He gave me a considering look. Would you recommend this sense suppressant for regular use? I thought about it. I pondered Qeturahs comment about how playing the hand shed been dealt became for her a badge of honor. That can only be an individual decision, I hedged. Then let us consider a specific example. Would you recommend it for me, for example? No, I said finally. Like you said, its who you are. I wouldnt want you to be anything less than yourself. I dont know if that makes sense, but there it is. There was a rustle at the entrance, and Nasiha and Tarik came in. They were glowing with energy but smiling only very slightly. I was a bit relieved. I had been afraid they might come in laughing or doing something shocking. Nasiha was carrying a small bowl in her hands. First Officer Delarua, she said with a touch of breathlessness, we apologize for making you miss the festivities by asking you to watch Joral. Please accept this traditional regional dish as a token of our regret. I took it with a smile and a twinge of anxiety, but when I looked at it, it was familiar to me. A genuine grin spread over my face. Thank you, Nasiha! I love chocolate decadence cake! I broke off a bit and put it into my mouth. Now, this was a drug worth taking. My taste buds positively hummed in bliss at the creamy richness. I closed my eyes and moaned. There was an odd echo. I opened my eyes and caught Nasiha and Tarik watching me avidly, their palms pressed lightly together in a poor attempt at intimacy. There was a slightly guilty look on Nasihas face, but it was spoiled the next instant by a suppressed giggle. The two then exchanged a smoldering look and departed hastily. My mouthful turned to ashes. I swallowed it with difficulty and set down the dish. Perverts, I said truculently. Now Ive lost my appetite. Eat your cake, said Dllenahkh, and there was definitely a tinge of amusement in the tone of his voice. Theyre gone now, Joral is asleep, and my shields are strong.          NEVER FORGET I hated talking to Qeturah about certain things, but for certain things she was the only source of information. Shes decided she hates me, hasnt she? Qeturah looked down at her handheld. Im not privy to the counseling notes of this case. Liar. Has she told Rafi not to write to me? She met my eyes at last. I dont know. But I do know that if you write to him, we will make sure that he sees it. I nodded and walked off before she could start on me again. I could write to my godson. That was all I needed to know. That made things easier. Dear Rafi I had to write. I couldnt call, because they were all under protection until the lengthy and thorough process of Ioans assessment and trial was concluded. Fergus had been rightthe authorities hadnt seen anything like Ioan on Cygnus Beta, and they werent about to take any chances. Dear Rafi, how are you, how is therapy, Theyd probably read whatever I wrote. Analyze it too for both our sakes. How are you all doing? Im fine, I grimaced at the handheld. After several efforts, the only unchanging bits of the message were Dear Rafi and Love, Aunt Grace. Perhaps I should just send that. Perhaps it was too soon. I could try again next week after I got back. I tossed the handheld into my backpack and sealed it up. Ready, Lian? I asked the aide. Lian, who was securing our shelter to a much larger military-issue backpack, gave me a narrow-eyed look. This is a date, right? Why are you harassing me, Lian? I sighed. Payback? Lian replied, wrestling on the pack with the ease of years of experience. At least I cant be accused of fraternization. Neither can I. Nor cradle snatching, Lian said, taking it up a notch. Tonio is not that young! I snapped defensively. He is not that old, Lian countered, amused. Okay. Im sorry if you interpreted my entirely professional attempt to warn you about being too friendly to Joral as a demonstration of inappropriate and frivolous interest in your social life. I believed I was acting in the best interests of my colleagues. Now, can we have a little dtente here? Lian leaned forward, took hold of my face in both hands, and looked at me searchingly, all the while on the edge of laughter. You are wearing kohl for a field trip. Forestry fatigues, boots, and kohl. Whats that for, hmm? To impress the elephants? Then Lian backed off, smirking, and left before I could think of a scathing rebuttal. We had temporarily split up the team. Qeturah, Fergus, Nasiha, and Tarik were going to continue along the settlements of the grasslands, using the shuttle. And you remember Tonio, the guy who looked a little bit but not really like Ioan? It turns out he was a ranger, off duty for the festival but still very much a civil servant. Qeturah seemed to think it would be a good idea to ask Leoval to pull some strings and have him assigned to us as a guide and extra security. One of those serendipitous things Ive learned not to question. So Lian, Dllenahkh, Joral, and I were going with Tonio on a side expedition into the forest uplands to the north. It was a place too thickly wooded for shuttles and too changeable for roads, so we were going to use a traditional, efficient, and proven form of transportation: elephants. I was excited at the prospect, but when we arrived at the mahouts village, I was a little surprised. Theyre a bitsmall, I said in puzzled disappointment, resting a cautious hand on the shoulder of the elephant assigned to me. It wasnt much taller than a large-sized cart horse. It flapped its ears at me in a friendly fashion and winked its small, long-lashed amber eye. Lian smiled at my expression. These are forest elephants. The savanna elephants are the largest of the species and the ones you see most in the holovids. I was still excited. Big or small, elephants are elephants, after all. Just before we mounted, when I was sure no one could see me, I quickly kissed the shoulder of my beast and murmured, Hey, sweetie. Hey, darlin. That was Tonio, appearing suddenly by my shoulder. He gave me a laughing look that suggested he was either amused by or attracted to women who kiss elephants for no good reason. Or both. When not under the influence of alcohol or fireberry, Tonio was witty, cheerful, and sharp with a kind of suppressed electric energy. Even better, he was looking less and less like Ioan to me. He wore a short hooded cape that was nonregulation but very useful under the dripping trees, and occasionally, when he turned his head a certain way, it framed his strong profile in a way that called attention to his mouth. Well defined, curving, with a fullness to the lower lip that cried out for a biting kissa very nice distraction. And then Id look away again to see Lian watching me and quietly laughing. In addition to freely mocking me, Lian was generally more talkative than usual. This is where my mothers people come from. There are legends of remote monasteries where the monks walk on water and fly through the treetops. Tonio rolled his eyes, not with sarcasm but with pure mischief. This is where my fathers people come from, and there are tales of huge stone statues which point, using one appendage or another, to the secret entrances of ancient temples. There are also reports of intricate, anatomically correct carvings on the walls of those temples which demonstrate the sixty-two approved sexual positions of the Marriage Code. I looked away hastily, biting my lip against laughter. Lian would tease me about always laughing at the things Tonio said. Our first river crossing occurred within minutes. The elephants, being excellent swimmers, got across quite happily by themselves, using their long trunks to snorkel through the deep water. The two-legs passed dry-shod over a small footbridge of rope and wood, and apart from the dubious joy of riding wet elephant, it worked very well. The second river crossing was nothing like the first. Wheres all this water coming from? asked Lian, looking at the cascading run in dismay. It was too flat to be called a waterfall but too steep to be an ordinary riverbed. There were two footbridges: a high one placed well above the churning water, strung from tree to tree upstream, and a lower one whose planks were ominously wet, resting directly on the riverbanks. The water flowed more placidly there, with greater depth and fewer rocks, but when I got closer, I gulped. The bridge was not a bridge; it was a lookout over a huge waterfall. We will take the high bridge, the mahout announced. Joral looked up at the loose sag of the swaying, fraying ropes. The high bridge does not appear to have been maintained for some time, he noted. The low bridge is too dangerous, the mahout insisted. We will swim with the elephants. Ordinarily, I would say listen to the man. His land, his river, his elephants, right? But that turbulent current was not at all reassuring. Tonio shrugged. I prefer to stay dry, he announced, and stepped lightly onto the low bridge. It gave a tiny sway, revealing that it was not wood but rope that connected the bridge to the bank landings, but he reached the other side easily. Joral and Lian quickly followed his example. By then, the mahout had ignored the general rebellion against his advice and was swimming over with the elephants, paddling easily near the head of his own beast. Dllenahkh looked at me, his eyebrow quirked in a well, arent you coming? expression. Still with slight misgivings, I went before him onto the bridge. We were hardly halfway to the other side when we heard it coming, like thunder. Dllenahkhs quickening steps set the bridge swaying so that I stumbled. He took my arm briefly to steady me and then urged me on with a light push. White water came pouring down the slope, crashing toward us with terrifying speed. Panic kept my feet moving as the wooden planks began to heave beneath me. Still trying to move forward, I watched in helpless fascination as the water surged over and under the bridge, tipping and twisting it vertical. I remember the fall. The weight of my pack pulled me immediately backward and horizontal. I looked down between my feet at the white froth of breaking water and saw Dllenahkh move quickly, reaching for me, fingers sliding along my left leg and coming to rest firmly around my ankle. Not the slightest hint of anxiety or surprise showed on his face, so it took me a while to realize that he was falling too, a vast weight of water following behind his back. He hauled me toward him, grabbed my belt with his other hand, and hauled again, reeling me in. Then he looked beyond me with an expression of intense concentration and pulled my head protectively against his shoulder. We hit. Water is hard. I lost breath, memory, and finally consciousness. I found awareness again in a dream. I was riding my elephant through wooded marshes, dry savanna, and dim green forest. He moved slowly, strongly, each step striking ground solidly yet gently. Swaying slightly with his gait, I leaned over so that my mouth came close to the languidly fanning giant ear. Dark you are, and golden-eyed, I whispered to the beast. I lay on my stomach along his broad back and patted his huge head. He brought up his trunk and found my face without seeing, gently touching my cheeks and forehead. The skin of the trunks tip was soft, its dexterity handlike. His breath surrounded my face like a hot tropical breeze. I smiled. I felt so comfortable. Then the gentle brush against my skin vibrated strangely as if dragging over a patch rougher than elephant skin, like scabbing on a nasty scrape. When did that happen? I woke upand I mean woke up, because my eyes were already open and waiting for consciousness to return. There was a half-healed scab on my cheekbone. There was also a warm hand on my face. I instinctively grasped it with my left hand as I blinked and tried to focus. Not one meter away, lying like me on a thin pallet on the floor, was Dllenahkh. We had been given tunics of roughly woven linen and light blankets of some material I could not identify. Dllenahkhs eyes were shut, his face perfectly blank, but it was his hand that rested on my face. As I began to draw away, there was an impression in my mind of a golden eye that winked and faded out. Wait. Dllenahkhs eyes were still closed, but it was his voice that spoke, the voice of someone whose vocal chords have been unused for hours. Stay still. I stopped moving, biddable in my drowsiness. Warm tendrils untangled from my nervous system, withdrawing gently but swiftly like the leaf-brush of startled mimosa. I frowned, feeling their absence like the niggling pain of a familiar but forgotten name. Dllenahkh cleared his throat, sat up slowly, and said, Thank you. I tried to speak, choked on a dry throat, and merely nodded. He gazed at me sleepily, then looked around the room. There was a low table against a nearby wall with two covered plates, two cups, and a pot. He slowly rearranged his legs to sit on his heels before the table, poured the cups full, and handed me one. Drink. Your body needs water and energy. I took the cup with slightly shaking hands and drank deeply, reclining on one elbow. It was both bitter and sweet and not really something Id usually drink, but I downed it as if it were the most delicious thing in the world. Dllenahkh drank slowly. His eyes scanned my face and looked me up and down in a cataloging fashion. How do you feel? Are you in pain? I set down my cup, lightly touched the scab on my cheek, felt along my arms and ribs, arched my back, and pointed and flexed my toes. I think everything works. A little sore, which is to be expected from being battered by water and rock. How about you? I am well, he replied. Is it you I should be thanking for the quick-heal? I asked. In part. The adepts showed me how to link to you and guide your body in the healing process. The adepts. Interesting. I would investigate that thoroughlyafter increasing my blood sugar level. I drained my cup and scooted to the table to pour out more, but I was soon distracted by the covered dishes. When I took a peek, I found nothing familiar, but the aromas were subtly tempting. I uncovered and offered a plate to Dllenahkh, part courtesy, part bribe. Tell me everything, I said. I couldnt remember much after that first icy plunge, which was probably a mercy, because when Dllenahkh began to describe, albeit in a terse, unemotional way, how we had been sucked down by the swirling currents, I began to shiver. I have no doubt that whatever my injuries had been, I would have fared far worse had he not shielded me from the hardest impacts. As for the adepts, apparently we had washed up at one of the legendary monasteries via some underwater cave or passage or secret way that lurked behind or beneath the falls. I wanted to feel excited about such a beautiful clich coming true, but mainly I felt hungry, worried, and very unsure about the place we had stumbled into. This was not an Indiana Jones classic holovid; it was real life. Dllenahkh had no such qualms. I do not understand how they have managed it, but these savants possess knowledge that goes far beyond the era when the taSadiri would have arrived at Cygnus Beta. Parallel development of theories and practices, perhaps? A kind of NewtonLeibniz effect? He pondered. It is a gross oversimplification to compare the discovery of calculus to the evolution of some of the most sophisticated techniques of mind and meditation the galaxy has seen, but I understand your point. Perhaps both branches of the disciplines exemplify a natural progression in Sadiri thought. How do you know so much about them already? I asked. Dllenahkh looked away from me, not wanting to lie but clearly not wanting to answer. I finally got a clue. Telepathy! And strong enough not to need touch for conversation. That is something. Dllenahkh sipped his tea and made a noise that sounded almost like satisfaction. They have advanced the disciplines to a level even beyond what we attained in the monasteries on Sadira. Will they go to the Sadiri settlement here or even to New Sadira? I asked shrewdly. His eyelids lowered slightly, a dimming of his quiet enthusiasm. They do not wish to reveal themselves. Not even now. Well, that doesnt help anyone. I sighed, feeling very tired. Will they speak to me, or am I too brain-dumb to be worth the effort? Dllenahkh smiled at that. I believe they are being mindful of your condition. You were unconscious when we arrived and have only recently awakened. Very kind of them. Well, let them know from me that a light is more useful on a high hill than under a bushel. And after youve thanked them for their hospitality, ask them when we can go home. I spoke as if the mission team was home, and I suppose thats what it had become to me by then. I spent most of the rest of that day in bed. While I was sleeping, Dllenahkh left the room to lodge elsewhere, so I woke alone in darkness. I lay peacefully listening to the sound of rainwateror perhaps it was a heavy night dewdripping from the eaves outside until the sun came up and filled the room with light. Minutes later, someone arriveda small girl-woman dressed in a light woolen robe, her hair so closely cut that it was a mere shadow on her scalp. Good morning, I said in Sadiri. She looked confused and shy. Good morning, she answered hesitantly in my local dialect. I will bring water for you to wash and your clothes so you can dress. I realized my backpack must have made the journey when I saw that the clothes she brought were those I had been carrying, not wearing. When I finished my simple cold-water ablutions and got dressed, she brought me a number of items in baskets, laid them neatly alongside a wall, and departed. Brilliant! I said first, recognizing the contents of my backpack, undamaged by water. Those Forestry types know how to design proper gear. Blast it, I said next. There was a carefully wrapped bundle of material that, when unfolded, revealed the many many fragments of my handheld. No quick message sending. Speaking of which, where was my comm? Dllenahkh came into my room, no doubt in response to my cry of dismay. Hey, Dllenahkh, I said cheerfully. They have women here! You cant keep this treasure from the other Sadiri. But Im surprised its a mixed community. Dont these kinds of groups separate the sexes so they wont get distracted from philosophizing or something? Dllenahkh folded his hands into his sleeves, an action that brought to my attention the fact that he was now wearing a robe very similar to the local style. As they rarely use shielding among themselves, they are already aware of each others minds, and physical separation would not serve any purpose. Instead, they have an integrated societycelibates, singles, wedded couples, and childrenall in full telepathic communication. What a way to live! I exclaimed. I bet some areas stay shielded, like the couples quarters. Before I could laugh at my own words, I saw Dllenahkhs lips twitch in a way that was all too familiar to me. I see, I said soberly. I have got to stop laughing at things. Theyre turning out to be true too often for comfort. Now, have you asked them how were going to get back? Have you eaten the morning meal as yet? he asked. No, I said, frowning. Did you just avoid my question? I would prefer to discuss it over breakfast, he replied. He knew where to go. As I followed him, I noticed that in spite of the near silence of the place, the few people we encountered directly greeted us verbally, sometimes in Sadiri, sometimes in my own dialect. The men kept their heads clean shaven, and the women allowed themselves only a shadows length, like the girl I had seen earlier. Not all wore robes, but all garments were of solid colors and in simple styles. In contrast to this superficial uniformity, their faces and bodies were strikingly, variably expressive, a constant reminder of the thousands of ongoing conversations that I could not hear. After passing through a kind of communal refectory and gathering a tray of fruits, grains, broth, and tea, we found ourselves on a balcony that looked down a green gully with a small window of blue sky at the end. The trees dripped moisture, though the early morning mist was quickly burning off as the day warmed up. The breeze was cool, the view breathtaking, and the companyenigmatic. He ignored my questioning looks and urged me to eat. Only when nothing but lukewarm tea remained to be consumed did he sit back slightly on his heels and look reflective. I was once closely connected to a monastery on Sadira, what you would term an oblate. Although I worked as a government official and lived in secular society, my free time was devoted to the study of the mind and its potential. I forgot my cooling tea and listened avidly. I had never dared ask any Sadiri about their life before the disaster, and though I knew Dllenahkh better than any of them, all my knowledge of him was newly minted, scarcely over a year old. My time on Cygnus Beta has been spent similarly. I work in the local government of the homesteadings, and I teach the disciplines at various levels. Mainly, because I cannot be everywhere, I train others to teach. It sounds to me, I said very softly, loath to interrupt him, as if you are among the most advanced of the savants on Cygnus Beta. He seemed to ponder momentarily. I would say your assessment is correct, with one exception. I have not sought the highest levels: the development of the skill required to pilot a mindship. May I ask why not? He looked at me as though it were obvious. Unlike the Zhinuvians, who link and delink from their technology with ease, Sadiri pilots are uniquely bonded to their ships. I do not wish to deny myself the profound bond that may be experienced in the connection between human minds. He paused and gazed at the distant patch of sky framed by leaf and vine. For me, finding this place is like finding a treasure. I have asked about leaving. There is no problem with us doing so. They only require that we leave behind all memory of this place so that it may remain hidden. I pursed my lips. I wasnt comfortable with gaps in my memory for obvious reasons, yet I could see that maintaining the security of this community was more important than my own personal issues. Very well. When can we go? He gave me an intent look. But must we go? I was aghast. He was serious. Dllenahkh, I cant stay. Iwe have people depending on us to return. He spoke abruptly, almost an interruption. While I appreciate that Cygnians are capable of forming attachments within a very short time period, I believe that Tonio I cut him off, stung at his obtuseness. I was talking about Rafi. I think even Sadiri understand family responsibility. And dont you think Joral depends on you too? Joral understands that he can rely on the guidance of any elder Sadiri of our community Yes, I said impatiently, but they wont be you. You guys are like family, you know? There are so few of us left that all Sadiri may be considered family, he said stubbornly. Then why cause him pain by letting him think youre dead? I said gently. Dllenahkh said nothing, but I saw a flicker in his gaze that suggested I had scored a hit. After a short silence, he said, Since you insist on returning, you could tell him that I am alive. After they wipe my memories? I said sarcastically. His look was determined and perhaps a touch irritated. You will not forget this. I will see to it. I went back to my room and packed up my things, even the bits of broken handheld. When I came out again, Dllenahkh was there with an elderly monk who looked at my readiness and smiled slightly. Few choose to stay with us. This is to be expected. It is not a life that everyone can understand. I felt more than mere courtesy compelling me to reply, and I did so in my best ceremonial Sadiri. Few are truly free of obligations and responsibilities to others. Otherwise they would stay, if only for a while, because your harmonious society soothes both mind and spirit. He inclined his head in gracious acknowledgment of both the words and the sincerity. And yet I wonder, I went on, emboldened by his gentleness, why your secrecy is so importantimportant enough to tamper with a persons mind. Dllenahkh began to frown, clearly considering this rudeness, but the monk bowed his head in apology, accepting the seriousness of the question. We tried, once, to be open to the world. The effects on the community were distressing. You see, many people believed that we were the Caretakers and began to demand of us more than we could provide. And you are not We are not now, nor have we ever been, the Caretakers, he declared solemnly. I almost sighed in disappointment. I had no strong feelings about the matter, but I had the usual amount of curiosity. Their powers are far beyond us, he continued. So you have met them? I asked quickly. He smiled. I really couldnt say. He led us out of the building and into an orderly garden of green grass, dark rock, and low clusters of pale gold flowers. A central gravel path led to a glass-smooth pool that appeared to have no edge but blue horizon. I felt a tiny surge of worry. There is no safer way? Dllenahkh inquired sharply. None that outsiders may see, was the placid response. The monks walk on water and fly through the treetops. So, this is what I think it is, I said in leaden tones. She has only recently recovered. How can you be sure she is strong enough? Dllenahkh turned to me suddenly. Delarua, stay. No, Dllenahkh. Rafi, remember? Joral. Qeturah. Even my sister Maria, who probably wishes me dead. And yes, even Tonio, who Ive known for all of two weeks. Then Im coming with you, he declared. Dont. I shook my head. Dont do this; dont make me feel that I stood between you and your dream. His look of resolve told me he had already made up his mind. If I am permitted, I will return some day, after I have completed my assignment. You were right, Delarua. There are people depending on us to return, and it was a lapse on my part to persuade myself otherwise. I glanced at the monk. He stood looking at us, as unsurprised as if he had known Dllenahkhs mind before Dllenahkh had known it himself. I took in a huge breath of relief. Well, then, what are you waiting for? I said with a grin. Get your stuff. I walked the gardens with the monk while Dllenahkh was away. I know we had a good in-depth conversation, because I felt lighthearted at the end of it, and Ive learned to trust my emotions. He must have taken particular care to remove all trace of his presence in my mind, because I cannot remember a single thing that we spoke about. I do remember when Dllenahkh returned, once more outfitted as a member of the mission team. My mind felt a space clearing, as if a single drop of oil had touched and spread, pushing back all other influence. I looked at the monk, knowing but needing to hear him say it. He smiled and gestured at the pool. Walk on water. Fly through the treetops. Farewell. Indiana Jones holovid fans, eat your heart out. We did not walk; we ran. Our feet struck the water firmly, gripped impossibly, and propelled us to the horizon at the pools far edge. We hurtled into an element that should have destroyed us: high-vaulted air with a breeze too light for the wingless to hope. And yet we soared. We swooped down the narrow valley, following the line of the river as if it were an arrow to our destination. I was tempted to look back to see if there was a line of robed figures just beyond the edge of the pool, wafting us gently homeward, but I knew that was just a silly cinematic image, possibly a memory from some ancient holovid. So I looked forward in wonder, seeing the kind of birds-eye view of the landscape that even a shuttle cant give. Some people, of course, have to prove they cant be awed by anything. Telekinesis is a natural consequence of intensive psionic development, he remarked after a minute or so. Shut up! Youre spoiling it! I screamed. (I may also have shrieked Wheee at some point. I admit nothing.) However smooth our descent as we followed the water down, I began to realize something. I think were going to get wet againaughhhhh! But it was only to our knees, and the current was comparatively tame. As we slogged to the nearest bank, heavy and earth-bound once more, I heard the most beautiful sound, the chirp of my own missing comm, miraculously coming from Dllenahkhs pocket. He had the decency to look slightly ashamed as he fished it out of hiding and answered the automated emergency call. When he signed off, I held out my hand accusingly, thinking of my conveniently smashed handheld. He placed the comm on my palm with a small, regretful smile that made me relent. He was right. There was no need to worry about me. You could have stayed, I admitted. I believe I acted appropriately, he replied, both smile and regret erased from his features. It would not be helpful to hold dual loyalties at this stage. I wanted to believe him, so I dropped the subject before I could persuade myself otherwise. After that, the only thing left to do was find a shuttle-size clearing, sit, and wait. It was a grand reunion. There was the expected hugging (by some of us at least!) and mutual relief and general elation at being home safe and sound. Only Qeturah looked grim and almost tearful, and it struck me that she must have convinced herself that she had been responsible for sending us to our deaths. I gave her a tiny chastising shake of the head for thinking such folly. It turned out, however, that she had other things on her mind. Theres someone waiting to speak to you on the shuttle comm, she said. I perked up even more. Rafi! Excusing myself hastily, I ran to the shuttle and quickly keyed on the monitor. Grace. Marias eyes looked shadowed, as if she had been crying and might start again without warning. Hey, Maria, I said tentatively. I really had no idea what to say. She smiled weakly. Good to see you alive and well. I gave a small smile that wasnt entirely kind. Thought I was dead? The stricken look that flashed across her face convinced meshe had wished it. I exhaled and looked away, tears stinging my eyes. Look, I Grace, please We stopped talking. You first, I said eventually. Okay, she said, and took a big breath, bracing herself. Iweve got a long road ahead of us, me and Gracie. The influence went on for so long, they cant just put things back the way they should be. Rafis all right, though. Hehes more like you. Grace, you must promise me, if I cant take care of him, if they try to take him from me, youll look out for him? Be his guardian? Ill sign whatever I have to. I just want him to be with family. Of course, Maria, I said, tears now falling freely. Of course. We spoke for a few more minutes. I told her a message would be coming for Rafi very soon. I apologized for not having done more. She told me not to be silly, and she even sounded as if she meant it. I left the monitor with eyes red but face wiped dry. Then I saw Tonio outside and realized I had to brace myself for another encounter. He was perfect. He took me by the hand and led me away to a quiet place under the eaves of the forest. He sat down on a fallen log and pulled me gently into his lap. Unexpectedly, in contrast to his calm face, his emotions sang against mine in a mutual cacophony of mingled joy and sorrow. Perhaps we were both a little giddy, a little susceptible to the melodrama of the moment. Perhaps not. Now stop that, I said, swallowing down my tears. Youre so loud the Sadiri will hear you. He gave me a wide-eyed look of innocence. Perhaps youre projecting your feelings onto me. If thats true, then drop the perhaps and tell me so directly, I challenged him. Hmm. I didnt think so, I added as he looked away for a moment with a wistful smile. Weve had too little time, you and I, he said quietly. And now you go that way, he continued, nodding toward the forest, and I return this way. He looked in the direction of the savanna. So it goes. No jokes? I said breathlessly. No lighthearted humor to make it easier? He gave a half smile, touching my cheek softly with the back of his hand. I dont want easy. I want true. Then this, and I kissed him lightly on the lips, is not easy, but it is true. He pressed his forehead to mine, then kissed me, a kiss as brief as mine had been but far more intense. Worth it, he sighed. I know, perhaps it wasnt a grand passion by the usual standards, but can anyone understand what it meant to me? To have had for however short a time the interest and attention of a man who was strong enough to walk away from me and strong enough to let me walk away from himit might be too much to say it healed something in me, but it was a start. Theres a nice little postscript to this adventure. Two weeks later, long after we had left the area, Qeturah informed Dllenahkh and Joral that a remote village in the forest uplands had made an unheard-of effort to contact Central Government authorities. It seems they learned about your quest to find taSadiri brides for your homesteaders, and theyre impressed with your courage. Theyve submitted genetic samples as proof of their eligibility and wish to send a delegation of women to the Tlaxce settlement. Thats marvelous! I exclaimed. I wouldnt be surprised if Yes, I was going to say it. I was going to start talking about the place Id been to and the people Id seen and the things I was supposed to keep secret. But instead my voice dwindled and choked off, my mouth closed, and my teeth clenched shut so fast that I bit the tip of my tongue. Lian gave me an odd look, but otherwise no one else remarked on my strange little coughing fit. Dllenahkh, who had noted with concern and sympathy my sudden stop and watering eyes, came to me after the meeting. I may have neglected to mention that the injunction placed on us to say nothing to others on this matter is far too strong for me to remove, he said softly. No kidding, I said, and tried to squint down at my outstretched tongue. But you have guessed correctly. I am grateful that they found a way to acknowledge our need without compromising their way of life. The words were neutral, the tone calm, but his eyes sparkled with triumph. I smiled at him. Ive got something for you. I reached into a pocket. It had been in a batch of knickknacks Id picked up for Gildas kids, but for some reason I hadnt sent it on with the rest. Never did thank you properly for saving my life and healing me and getting me back safe. Sohere. He took the small brown object, bemused. Then his lips twitched. Highly appropriate. I thank you. It is good to have someone with whom I can remember this. He gravely affixed the teak elephant to the collar of his tunic and gave it a pat of satisfaction that reminded me of my own dealings with the real-life, full-size versions. Zero hour plus one year two months twenty-four days Some mornings, inspired by good weather and exceptional scenery, all four of them meditated together. In the initial days after his return from the hidden monastery, the communal sessions became more frequent, perhaps out of relief and gratitude that he had returned. For Dllenahkh, it was more; he could now sense the latent connections that would lead them into that deeper communication shared by the people of the monastery. It took away the bittersweet nostalgia of the old familiar ritual and replaced it with the new excitement of this is what we will become. One day, Commander Nasiha lingered to speak to him after meditation. I have been thinking, she said. Delarua could benefit from some of the techniques of the basic disciplines. Pleased that she had spoken his innermost thoughts, Dllenahkh responded promptly. That is an excellent suggestion. When will you start? She gave a brief nod in begrudging acknowledgment of the compliment and the trick, fixed him her usual direct look, and pressed on. We both know that you are far better qualified to train her. That might be considered a conflict of interest, he remarked. She kept her face expressionless, and that was as bad as an out-loud laugh. Oh? How so? Patiently, Dllenahkh explained, I do not wish to be seen as another Ioan. She blinked, shocked. Councillor! I did not mean Neither did I. He tried to explain without compromising the safety of his bridled tongue. Of course, but the fact remains, she can trust me while we remain colleagues and equals. Becoming her teacher would shift the balance of power, and I would prefer not to lose her friendship. For I have already done too much to alter that balance. He was relieved that he could not speak of what he had done, because for all his good intentions, he felt strangely close to the edge of guilt. Healing Delarua had been unexpectedly exhilarating, partly due, no doubt, to the thrill of learning a new, nearly miraculous skill, but also perhaps akin to the transcendence of bonding with a mindship and feeling the bones, tendons, and nerves of another beingnot as a puppet master but like a dancer fitted to a partner, able to suggest a movement with a light press of silent, invisible communication. I will teach her, Nasiha said with a firmness that was as good as an oath. Thank you, Commander. If I may make a suggestion, be subtle. She may appear fearless, but she is very quick to retreat if she feels pressured. I will be careful, Councillor, she promised.          THE FAERIE QUEEN Her hair was a cloud of silver foam growing back from her temples in tiny soft curls, then expanding up and out in fierce glory. Few crowns of the traditional mold could encompass it, but none was necessary when diamonds of all colors, rose and white and gold, sparkled freely throughout her tresses, transforming the cloud to a starry nebula. Her eyebrows were golden and perfectly shaped, each one a gentle, delicate arc. Dark pupils stood out starkly in sea-gray irises; long, light brown eyelashes framed all with a sleepy sultriness. Her look was forgiving of the ordinariness of others and understanding of their natural desire to adore her. Slender limbs made her sprawl elegant; the very fineness of her bones drew the eye along her lines and subtle curves. Her skin defied common sense; it combined translucency with an amber tint, revealing an intricate tracery of blood vessels under the paler skin of her inner arm. She would have made an artist weep for shame that neither brush nor tint could do her justice. A catalog of my own flaws began to scroll through my mind. The uneven texture of my hair, whose inability to decide whether to curl or ripple meant that a crew cut was the best out of a bunch of bad options. The mundane brown of that same hair. Flat, broad eyebrows strongly marking my face, eyes that needed the help of kohl to become remarkable. Thick bones and muscles that spoke of sturdiness rather than graceha, the irony! Cedar-brown skin that might have been just acceptable if it hadnt been for the faint dusting of freckles across my nose and cheeks. Ah, there. I consoled myself. We had very much the same nose, a happy medium that was neither big nor small, broad nor pointed, just well proportioned and joined harmoniously to the forehead with a gentle dip. I held on to the image of my nose and tried to feel confident as I looked down it at herinsofar as it is possible to look down at someone seated on a throne elevated on a dais. The Tlaxce Visiting Mission of the Central Government of Cygnus Beta thanks Your Majesty for her kind invitation and wishes to avail itself of the opportunity to renew to the Seelie Court the assurances of its highest consideration. The impressive part wasnt the high diplomatic language. It was the fact that I was able to resurrect enough of my Cymraeg to say this without pause or stammer. The Faerie Queen inclined her head graciously. Be welcome, she said. It had been blissfully mundane for almost three weeks, exactly what I needed after the excitement of waterfall jumping. We had flown the shuttle south and made our way across open farmland, visiting settlements with scant humanity and an overabundance of ruminants. I might have glanced once or twice at the gray edge of wooded hills to the west. I might even have wondered a little, but when Qeturah told me that we had obtained clearance to go to Faerie, my immediate reaction had been that it was a Bad Idea with a capital B I, because I was damned if I was going to explain to the Sadiri how a community of their people had ditched their own culture wholesale to actualize an obscure Terran myth. But I was stuck with the job, so I went ahead and tried my best. Reports are sketchy. Faerie has been closed for more than a century, because visitors tended to treat it a bit like a theme park. Smart visitors, I thought cynically to myself. But they say that for centuries the land was populated by two taSadiri clans who were constantly at war with each other. They had endured a particularly bad run of hostilities when a strange Cygnian turned up with an intriguing solution to their problem. Since the main cause of their war was the question of which clans rituals and dialect should take precedence, the compromise was for both clans to learn an entirely new identity. Tarik was utterly disbelieving. This makes no sense. Do you mean to tell me that two taSadiri tribes abandoned millennia of tradition for a society drawn from folktales and fictional writings? Im afraid so, I said, trying not to smirk at his appalled expression. As a belief, it was rather seductive, actually. Long-lived, superior, and mentally dominant over the weaker Terrans, the Elves were clearly an indication of some covert pre-embargo Sadiri visit to Terra. If youre out of your skull, that is. Who was the Cygnian who told them this? asked Dllenahkh. Some crackpot academic descended from the Druids of Ynys Mn who made it his business to know all ancient and modern manifestations of Celtic culture. They say his forefathers founded New Camelot. I dont know. Frankly, I find it all a bit silly, but theyve heard about us and theyve invited us, and we cant very well say no. Fortunately, I had set their expectations so low that when the shuttle set down on the bald brow of a tree-ringed hill, we were relieved to be greeted by ordinary Cygnians dressed in contemporary attire and with only slightly glossy hair, drawn up in a welcoming party around the Queens throne. They did, however, hold firmly to their own language, and until Tarik could get a translation program up and running, that meant yours truly was the main conduit of communication on our end. The Faerie Queen was eloquent but slightly insane, and this made translation difficult. After descending the dais to greet the Commissioner gravely, she turned her attention to the rest of the team as introductions were made. Initially, she nodded perfunctorily at each name, but then she began to walk among us, her slender height both imposing and fragile. Lian earned a lingering look, Nasiha another grave nod, but at Fergus she stopped and considered. With a sideways glance at Qeturah, she murmured, Probably hers, and went to Joral. Taking the poor young man by the chin, she examined him and proclaimed, Young, before moving on to Tarik. Nasiha, who was quicker on the uptake than the rest of us, seized her husbands hand and stared challengingly at the woman, who merely smiled and came to stand before Dllenahkh. Keeping her gaze on him, she beckoned me over. You represent the newly arrived Sadiri on Cygnus Beta? she asked him. I translated, and Dllenahkh nodded. I do, Your Majesty. She was perhaps three centimeters taller than he was, not counting the fifteen centimeters that was hair alone, but he was three times broader and just as self-possessed. She suddenly smiled brilliantly, as if deigning to recognize him as an equal. I will speak to you, she declared. You, she addressed me, still without looking at me, will translate. The rest of you are granted the freedom of the Seelie Court until our discussions are completed. I repeated this in Standard for the benefit of the team, looking anxiously at Qeturah. She smiled reassuringly, but her eyes signaled caution as she said, Tell her that in accordance with government practice we would be happy to set up shelter near the shuttle. The Queen was appalled at the idea. Nonsense! she said, looking at Qeturah as if she were both mad and discourteous. It is far too dangerous to stay on the ground at night. We have prepared lodgings for you. Qeturahs gaze followed her pointing hand, looking up walkways into the heights of huge trees where wooden platforms spanned branches and surrounded trunks in a vast tree city. Thank her kindly for us, First Officer Delarua, she said somewhat breathlessly. Our platformor tbren as they called ithad no barrier rails, something that seemed to worry no one but us, but they did offer us rope netting to string over and around our bedding, perhaps as a deterrent to sleepwalking. I was careful with mine that first night, hooking it securely to a branch above and tucking it under the bedding. This made waking up suddenly at midnight even more exciting as I promptly got tangled up in the mesh. What is it? Whats happened? I whispered frantically as I unknotted myself. Ferguss deep murmur was slow and calming. Someones trying to break into the shuttle. Lian and I are going to check it out. I hesitated, then flung off the netting with one final effort and felt my way to the edge. A hand rested warningly on my back, another hand muffled my start at a scream, and a voice whispered in Cymraeg, Stay. It was likely someone wed met during the day, but the night was dark and all faces dim. Probably the only person whod stand out would be the Queen, with her bright hair. What is it? I whispered. Do you know? Unseelie, came the whispered answer. For a moment I was baffled, and then I grimaced. Ah. The bad guys. Yes. They rule the land at night and go underground at dawn. They do not come up to our treetops, and we do not descend to their caves. Thus we preserve some measure of peace. I thought the whole point of becoming Elves was to stop the conflict. The hand on my back shifted as if vibrating with laughter. I will tell you about it tomorrow. It makes a good tale. Who are you? How will I know you in daylight? I am the teller of tales and singer of songs. You will make a good song, I can feel it. Which one is yours? Disjointedness of thought and speech seemed to be an Elvish trait, but I understood when a shadowy hand waved to the rest of the group, who were awake and quietly talking into comms and to one another. Tarik and Nasiha are husband and wife. The restwe belong only to ourselves. Ah. There was a hint of laughter in that response, and I wondered too late how strong these Elves were in telepathy and empathy. I sat up and put some distance between myself and the strange Elf with his overly friendly hand. Here come your guards, said the storyteller-singer, and there indeed were Fergus and Lian returning. Perimeter alarms scared them off, said Fergus. Someone tried a light mental tweak on us, but it didnt take. I quickly explained the little I had just learned. Thats not reassuring, said Qeturah, a frown in her voice. Remember the legend of faerie glamour? Lets stay together as much as possible and be on the alert for influence. With the immediate danger over, the Sadiri soon composed themselves to rest with their usual economy of fuss. Qeturah drew Lian aside for a quiet conference. There was little chance of my getting to sleep in a hurry, what with all the adrenaline of the past few minutes, so I shifted a little closer to Fergus. He was putting away some of his gear and politely ignoring me, as usual. Id long ago figured out that for a man like Fergus, a man who shunned unnecessary talk, I was a walking nightmare. Im a bit surprised, I began, adjusting my voice to copy his measured cadence, hoping not to startle or vex him. Some of the taSadiri weve encounteredwell, its one thing not to have the mental disciplines, but they seem almostuncivilized. There was a silence as he paused for a moment in his work. Are you joking? he said at last, sounding wary. I was baffled. No. What did I say? Theyve got all kinds of ways to reform criminals now, but what do you think the Sadiri used to do with their delinquents in the old days? I was struck mute. The concept of a lawbreaking Sadiri had not even crossed my mind. The perpetual stereotype of the judging, superior Sadiri was too strong, even in me. They used to ship them off-planet, fast and far. A lot of their so-called science outposts and religious retreats were nothing more than places to dump undesirables, people who didnt quite fit in. Worked out for the best, ironically. Pity the demographics are so skewed. I exhaled very slowly. Youre telling me that of the Sadiri who survived, there are diplomats and judges, pilots and scientists, nuns and monksand jailbirds? Yep. Almost makes you laugh, doesnt it? I felt a bit foolish. Fair enough; it was Cygnian culture and language that was my speciality, but I had begun to pride myself on becoming a bit of an expert in Sadiri matters over the past few months. How do you know all this? I asked resentfully. Used to work in Galactic Patrol, he replied. Been far and wide myself, even as far as Ain. Lots of interesting tales about how Ain got founded, but I think its obvious. You do? I thought I knew what he was going to say. Political differences arise, conflict follows, and the more adventurous faction goes off to make a new world of their choosingor the losing side gets kicked out. That was Punartams story, and which version you got depended on whether the person doing the telling was from Punartam or Ntshune. Prison colony for the worst offenders. Probably people like your He stopped, stiffened. Like Ioan, I said, my stomach plummeting as if the tree had suddenly removed its support from under our feet. Something like that, he said, wary again. Maybe he feared I was going to get all confiding or burst into tears. Go to sleep, he concluded abruptly. I cant keep proper watch with people nattering in my ear all night. I was now suspicious that the Queens overwhelming presence was glamour-assisted. I tagged along behind her and Dllenahkh the following morning as they walked in the mellow light below the trees and he told her about Sadira, the Sadiri settlement in Tlaxce, and New Sadira. As I translated, I absently probed at my emotions but found nothing amiss. After she dismissed us and swept off with her small entourage, I asked him directly. How does the Queen strike you? Cautious, he replied. She has clearly heard reports, but she assumes nothing and waits for me to confirm. A very scientific approach. Well, yes, but is there anything more? How does she feel to you? He raised a faintly puzzled eyebrow. Bored. Lonely. Do you find her beautiful? I asked at last. Ah, he said in dawning comprehension. You are worried about the possibility of glamour. No, she uses none. Well, if any of us could tell, it would be you, I grumbled. Do me a favor. When you get a chance, ask her about the Unseelie Court. We were invited to a formal dinner that night. I could not help smiling at the seating arrangements. Qeturah was given a couch on a smaller dais with Lian and Fergus nearby, and the Elves who attended her were mostly male and, well, damn good-looking. Nasiha had the smallest dais with Tarik at her side, Joral slightly below, and again some very good-looking attendants. I had no such luck. Perhaps this matriarchal society required that I have at least one pet male of my own to qualify for special treatment, or perhaps I was still too useful as a translator. I was stuck just a little back from Dllenahkh, who was seated at the Queens right hand. On the bright side, it seemed that the most attractive attendants had been reserved for the Queens dais, so during lulls in conversation I amused myself by ranking them. One of them, an eight point five on my scale, was quietly tuning a stringed instrument resembling a cithara. He caught my eye and smiled. My eyes widened, and I elbowed a startled Dllenahkh in the ribs. Quick! Ask her about the Unseelie Court! I hissed. He complied, with only a disapproving quirk of the corner of his mouth to chastise me for my behavior, and I dutifully translated. The Queens eyes went from lazy to furious for a moment, then she instantly regained her calm. It is true, she said. It appears that war, when deprived of one reason, simply seeks out another. We are still a people divided, having selected different aspects of legend to embody. And yet it is better than it once was. How so, Your Majesty? asked Dllenahkh. Clapping her hands, she caught the minstrels attention. Tell them a story of the Elder Days, the one about the woman with three sons. The minstrel set down his instrument, stood, and addressed the court in a mellifluous tenor. A woman had three sons, and when they were grown, the first came to her and said, Mama, I love a girl and wish to marry her. She replied, Son, this gladdens my heart, but of what lineage is she? Alas, Mama, he told her. She is half Terran. His mother raised her hands and shook her head and said, A tragedy, but I will cope. The second son came some time after to inform her of his desire to marry, and, worse yet, the bride he had selected was half Terran, half Ntshune, with no taSadiri in her at all. But again his mother raised her hands, shook her head, and said, A tragedy, but I will cope. Finally, the third son came to her and said he was engaged. When she inquired about the girls lineage, he answered smugly, She is all taSadiri, Mama. Wonderful news, his mother cried. Of what family? She is of the Other clan, he confessed. Whereupon his mother rose up with her blade and slew him without another word. The bard waited for me to finish translating, then spoke low for my ears. I hope you have rendered it well. It is one of my best tales, handed down from my grandmother. Tale or family history? I murmured teasingly in reply. He merely smiled enigmatically. Conflicts are less intense, less bloody than before. Some blame the admixture of our blood; others credit our new traditions, the Queen said. And some say there is yet a third reason, murmured the bard as he returned to his instrument. Peace, child, all in good time. What my impertinent great-grandson wishes me to tell you is that some of the women of the Seelie Court are long-lived, specifically the women of my house. The Queen looked around at her attendants. Suddenly, their devotion and her goddesslike air no longer seemed unwarranted. In many cultures it is considered discourteous to ask a woman her age, Dllenahkh said. If I may beg your pardon in advance, would you satisfy my curiosity? I took care to translate the elegant framing of Dllenahkhs request. I believe I succeeded, for the Queen smiled at him and said graciously, I am nearly three hundred and forty-seven Standard years. Cygnian law prohibits extending the life span by genetic means, Qeturah noted. It is a risky proposition, with uneven results. The Queen shrugged. What was done was done so long ago. Were we perhaps seeking to restore the years that the mixing of our blood had taken from us? And yes, the results are uneven, as you can witness. But it has provided a core of stability in our society. You are a land of true matriarchs. Is that why there is no king in your court? Dllenahkh inquired. The Queen seemed delighted at this question. There have been two in the past, but these days I follow the example of other women of my House and content myself with my attendants. There was a slight choking sound as Fergus inhaled his drink, no doubt finally realizing the significance of his placing at the Commissioners feet. Qeturah smiled and patted his shoulder. Hush, dear; no explanations. This is no time for me to lose face. What a life, Lian said to me afterward. Ive never seen a woman with a harem who so obviously deserved it. I hope she keeps a close eye on her family tree. It would be very awkward to seduce ones great-grandnephew. Theyre a small population, I agreed. I wouldnt be surprised if there was a little mutual kidnapping going on with the other Elves. Yep. Anything for fresh blood, Lian said. I frowned to myself, not quite knowing why. The discussions continued. What made matters particularly difficult was the fact that the Queen became enthralled by the sound of the Sadiri language and pressed Dllenahkh to speak only in that tongue. Cymraeg is very poetic, even romantic, and Standard less so, though serviceable enough. Sadiri is absolutely perfect as a programming language, but when it comes to matters of the heart, it falls a little short. This became obvious when the tenor of the conversation began to change. Why dont you tell me Im beautiful? she said randomly one day. It would be appropriate if you were to comment on the aesthetics of my person, I communicated to Dllenahkh. His eyebrows rose the merest fraction. The fact that you are an extremely attractive woman is sufficiently obvious that it does not require my repeating it. Need I tell you what so many others have told you before? I replied to her. She laughed lightly. I bit my lip in frustration. Any progress with that translator? I asked Tarik moodily as he worked on his handheld, comfortably seated on edge of the tbren with his legs dangling over high green infinity. He gave me a steady look. It will not be ready before the end of our sojourn here. Blast, I muttered. Im so tired of this. On the last day of our stay, the Queen seemed in a reflective mood. She took Dllenahkh and me up to the highest tbren, whose view extended beyond the trees, across the valley, and to the gray-shadowed horizon with its high, distant mountains. A small group of attendants followed as usual, and her minstrel played his cithara in the background, singing in some variant of Cymraeg that was unfamiliar to me. The business of the ElvenSadiri exchange had long been concluded, with the result that the only talk remaining between them was small talk. Dllenahkh noted in grave Sadiri fashion that the music was pleasingly harmonious. It is a love song, she said to him, but her eyes were on me, her smile mocking though not yet cruel. Shall I translate it for you? She signaled to the minstrel with a languid movement of her hand, and he began again, singing softly to the complex melody while she translated in perfect Standard:  The mind is a golden vein seamed in crumbling rock (also known as rotting quartz).  And why had it amused her to have me tagging along as an imperfect interpreter when she could easily have spoken for herself in Standard? I would never understand what passed for humor among the Elves.  The golden mean becomes a kindness as she learns to sip the echo of his smiles.  That was a nice little turn of phrase there. The echo of a smilethat reminded me of the subtlety of Sadiri facial expressions.  That Sadira died, that her heart was shorn of innocence by a conscienceless man,  the hell? She couldnt possibly mean And yet my spine stiffened as the lilt of her voice and the sly slant of her looks suffused each word with a far too personal significance.  that she tempts him to laughter and other ruin, that they ache, that they find their way, slowly, delicately, respectfully passions slow but inexorable burn  I was too embarrassed to look at Dllenahkh and too curious not to, so I settled for a furtive glance that only told me that he appeared to be perfectly still and controlled.  Its not the sun that blinds her, nor the golden rays of impossibility in an infinitely permutable and permissive landscape.   Light diffuses through suspended sand. They dance, exquisitely slowly, an elegant sarabande.  She concluded the verses with a gentle flourish of her wrist and fingers. I have so much time and so many to choose from, she said to me with a beautifully condescending smile. I can afford to be generous. Then she gracefully inclined her head, gathered up her entourage with the casual command of a glance, and withdrew, leaving us alone on the lookout with the minstrel still quietly playing nearby. My ears were burning. It was impossible to pretend that I did not understand who the song was referring to, and what she had just hinted. Dllenahkh cleared his throat. I have recently received some new projections concerning the planned infrastructural improvements for the Tlaxce homesteadings. Would you care to go over them with me? I believe there are some points that may be of interest to you. Yes, lets. That sounds fascinating, I quickly agreed, and we made our way back to our tbren with no further incident. That afternoon, we said our farewells and flew on toward our next assignment, stopping overnight at another Forestry outpost. I was curious to know what the Sadiri had thought of the Elven solution to taSadiri strife, so I approached them as they sat outdoors at twilight, talking among themselves in Sadiri. I know weve already had our formal debriefing, I said with careful politeness, but I was wondering what you thought of the Elves of the Seelie Court and what recommendations you might make concerning them to the Sadiri settlement. It was an interesting encounter, but I do not aspire to become a member of a harem, Dllenahkh said. As far as I could tell, he was teasing me, but I was too mortified to appreciate the effort at light-heartedness, especially since Joral, Nasiha, and Tarik were wearing various expressions of suppressed amusement, which was, for them, the equivalent of a belly laugh. Yeah, about that, I muttered, examining my boots. Im sorry she got the wrong impression about us. I swear, I translated as best I could, but You are distressed, he said in genuine surprise. But surely you cannot think that this is the first time people have speculated on the nature of our relationship? I was finally able to look up, my jaw slack with amazement. What? It is true, Joral confirmed. It was one of the first things Tonio asked me when he was attached to the team. Tarik and I have discussed the possibility more than once, Nasiha admitted. They looked at Dllenahkh, who grudgingly confessed, Lanuri continues to exact a most un-Sadiri revenge for what he terms my well-meaning meddling in his personal life. He has been affixing advice to the end of every piece of official correspondence he sends to me. He is of the opinion that my apparent slow progress with you is an indication that I need help. I laughed out loud, not least because I detected more than a touch of Freyda Mar in that statement. Then Tarik spoke up. As more people learn about the missions work, there is a growing sense that it would be fitting if one or both of the single Sadiri on the team were to find wives by the end of the year as a sort of symbol of success for the broader undertaking. My features struggled to find the right response to this news and settled on pained incredulity. Thats ridiculous. For what Dllenahkh and Joral are doing, those people should have Sadiri princesses lined up for them when they get back rather than speculating about every ragtag and bobtail they happen to work with. Dllenahkhs eyebrows went up, as expected. I am not familiar with that phrase, but if the tone is any indication, I would have to say that you are hardly in that category. Most kind, I scoffed. Look, you guys feel free to keep searching, but Ive got some contacts at the Ministry of Family Planning, and once youre both registered, we can draw up a list of candidates of a certain caliber. Most kind, Dllenahkh said blandly, but for a moment I felt a strange flash of something electric, almost as if he were angry. Well, its the least I can do for unwittingly blocking your prospects, I said lightly, hiding my bewilderment at his reaction. I think it is an excellent idea, Joral said. You could register too. I I faltered, trying to find a good excuse. Qeturah was already convinced I needed therapy, and I wanted to keep the Sadiri on my side. I dont see why not. Set a good example and all that. But lets be sensible about this. Youve got more choices now. Women are coming to you and inviting you to visit them. You could even return to the Seelie Court, maybe convince a few to become fully Sadiri. It might take a little time, but Nasiha looked amused, whether at my backpedaling or at the idea of Joral as Sadiri missionary to Elven women, I wasnt sure. Well, Joral, what do you think of this option? she asked. Joral pondered for a while, then snapped out, Unacceptable. I was not the only one startled at the sharpness of his tone. Everyone seemed to straighten slightly as he went on with increasing intensity. I want a wife, and children, and a family of my blood. I want sons and daughters who will look like my brothers and sisters who are gone, who will speak Sadiri and learn of Sadira and practice the mental disciplines. I want to see them married and grow old enough to see my grandchildren and great-grandchildren. I am the last of my line, the sole survivor of my family, like so many others on the homesteadings. The Councillor is right; why should any of us seek to be a member of a harem? Why should we desire frivolous things? I want Joral Leave him be. Shockingly, the fierce words that cut off Dllenahkhs attempt to bring Joral back to proper Sadiri behavior came from Nasiha. She knelt before Joral and spoke passionately. We desire these things too. These are good things to desire, right and appropriate things. We shall see these things come to pass for you and for others. Your line will not die out. I backed away, a lump in my throat. Collective grief is one thing, but the Sadiri are very scary when they get intense. I turned to see Lian watching wide-eyed from a distance and gladly found my excuse to leave. Lian, youre not going to help out Joral any time soon, are you? I murmured. Lian answered with a head shake, still staring past me, awed at the sight of overwrought Sadiri. Well, if you have a sister or a friend to recommend to Joral instead, that would be a nice gesture. Ill look into it, Lian said absently. I keep forgetting how important this is to them, you know? Im just as bad, I said morosely. Teasing you about Joral. Treating him like a boy and not a man. Treating Dllenahkh like Lian eyed me with great interest. Like? I frowned, trying to think. I dunno. As if hell always be around to be my sidekick. Like Ill never have to share him with a wife and children andhah, from all theyre saying, grandchildren too. Dont laugh at me, Lian, but I was jealous of that woman monopolizing his time and attention. Ive never felt like that before. Hmm, said Lian. Well, I wont laugh at you. We walked away and gave them some privacy, but later on I caught Nasiha alone just as she was coming out of her quarters. So, I began cautiously, is it too early to congratulate you? Nasiha struggled, keeping her face neutral and her chin aggressively up, but then she exhaled and glared at me with a kind of proud defeat. It is remarkable how you are able to be so perceptive in some areas and so obtuse in others. Yes, it is too early. It will be too early until, as Joral said, I can see my great-grandchildren. Then you may congratulate me. I wont be alive then, I said cheekily. Ill leave you a congratulations message that you can open whenever it seems right to you. Nasiha gave me a determined look. I believe young parents will become a new Sadiri tradition. You may yet be alive to see the fourth generation, perhaps even the fifth. I nodded, imagining it and finding it good. Id stick around just for that. Maybe even tweak a gene to be sure. She completely shocked me in the next moment. She put a hand on my shoulder not at all affectionately but more as if she were bracing me for something. It would be advantageous for us to seek the assistance of suitable non-Sadiri for the education and care of our child. Tarik and I have agreed that given your experience and knowledge of the Sadiri language and culture, you would be the natural choice. Ah, I said, panicked and wide-eyed under the strong grip of her hand. This is an important duty. What does it entail? You would function as an elder member of the family. A godparent, if you will. ThenI would be honored, I replied in wonderment. Nasiha seemed to calm down at this assurance. She released my shoulder, tilted her head, and considered me. You were not fooling us earlier. Something about marriage frightens you. I opened my mouth to remonstrate, and she raised a silencing hand. Do not try to lie to me. Remember, I have documented your empathic and telepathic data, and I know a little about your ex-fianc. I understand your difficulty. You do? I said. Nasiha in the role of supportive confidante was boggling my mind. Yes. You have concerns that you may influence your spouse without intending to or that you may again be influenced without your knowledge. These are rational concerns, but your inability to deal with them properly is turning them into irrational fears. What do you suggest I do? I said almost meekly. You must learn how to shield your emotions and thoughts. You must learn how to protect yourself and others. There are aspects of the Sadiri disciplines that can help you achieve this. It is a practical solution. It is, I agreed. My sense of relief at her blunt but insightful summary was so great that I felt myself grow an extra centimeter, as if a burden had literally been lifted from my back. I wondered, not for the first time, if the Sadiri had any concept of therapy in the gentle, lengthy Cygnian sense. I doubted it. It might just have been Nasiha, but there was an attitude of going straight in with a sharp blade instead of beating around the bush. Excellent, she barked out. We will start tomorrow. She walked away, leaving me stunned and not a little fearful of what the morrow might bring.          RIDI, PAGLIACCIO Training with Nasiha going well? asked Qeturah absently, tapping out a report with a practiced staccato rhythm. We were working in a place called Crue, a midsize town that straddled a few key trade routes. The population was large but constantly changing: merchants, tourists in transit to more interesting places, and of course our fellow civil servants keeping the wheels of government moving smoothly (or, to quote Gilda at her most cynical, keeping the speed bumps of government before the greased wheels of commerce). It had little to offer in terms of taSadiri culture, but we were there for a teleconference of a more agreeable kind. The midpoint of the mission schedule was approaching, and the media wanted to give us a little attention. Qeturah and Dllenahkh had been interviewed, and the rest of the team got a piece of the spotlight as well. It was also a good time to catch up on paperwork and reports in actual offices with full-size desks, courtesy of the local branch of Central Government. Quite well, I replied, not hiding my pleased surprise. Shes almost patient with me, but not too much. Keeps me sharp, yknow? Those early mornings alone would keep you sharp, she said drily. Of course Nasiha would not sacrifice her own meditation time for me, so I had the dubious honor of rising even earlier than the average Sadiri for my training. Well, shed better let me off just this once, because tonightll be a late one. We were going out on the town. Id discovered that both Dllenahkh and Joral had managed to duck Gildas cultural tours, and Qeturah thought we needed a little change of pace. She, Nasiha, and Fergus opted for something contemporary in the form of a holovid at the local cineplex, and the rest of us were going to risk a stage production by a touring company. It was certainly rustic, right down to the paper playbill and glossy poster tacked up outside the theater. The End of the Laughter. I recognize this one, said Joral. Is this the adaptation of Enough, the taSadiri tale of a man who kills his unfaithful wife and her lover? No, said Tarik, shaking his head firmly. You have made a common error. In this one, he kills the man that he mistakenly thinks is her lover while her real lover gets away. This is an adaptation of the Ainya play Deception, not Enough. Okay, not meaning to muddy the waters, I said, but Im fairly certain that what we have here is a version of Otello, one of the old Terran standards. Kills his not-unfaithful wife on the say-so of a man who was out to get him. Lian approached the poster more closely and read the fine print at the bottom out loud. Based on the Italian opera Pagliacci. We crowded around the poster. Who dies? asked Tarik with interest. And was the infidelity real or alleged? Is there some other production we might attend which does not illustrate that dysfunctional pair bonding is endemic in most cultures? asked Dllenahkh with heavy disapproval. I sighed and rolled my eyes. Everyones a critic. Come on. Lets go in. Lian was already making for the foyer, and I began to follow when I sensed something strange in the atmosphere. Turning back, I saw that the Sadiri had paused, almost in midstride, and were watching a pretty girl with tumbling black curls dashing toward a side alley, presumably on her way to the back entrance of the theater. She held a coat and a handbag tightly in one hand and a pair of shoes in the other, as if she had grabbed them while running out the door and hadnt had time to pull herself together. It might have been better if she had, for she was wearing one of the skimpiest dresses I have ever seen. Her legs were pretty much uncovered, and I have no idea how she managed to run so fast with so little support for her upper assets. All the skin on view, and there was plenty, radiated a muted shimmer. Ive seen some women try to imitate that look with silicon- and mica-rich lotions, hoping to be taken for a Zhinuvian woman with flexible limbs and even more flexible morals. It never looks the same. Heads everywhere were turning, not just the Sadiri ones. There was a small collective sigh when she disappeared from view. I stared at my colleagues in amazement. Youall of youyou were looking that girl up and down! I didnt know whether to be appalled or hugely entertained. First Officer Delarua, Joral said in a tone so severe that he almost sounded like Dllenahkh in chastising mode, while it is true that we are Sadiri and therefore not prone to mental distractions, we are more than capable of aesthetic appreciation of the feminine human form. I had no answer to that, so I rounded on Tarik. Well, then, youyoure married! I am allowed to look, he said uncertainly. Id confirm that with Nasiha if I were you, I said skeptically. Dllenahkhs voice was utterly composed. There is no need to be concerned, Delarua. Sadiri possess far too much mental control to be susceptible to the mesmeric influence of Zhinuvians. Oh, and that makes it better, does it? I said. I was this close to wagging a finger and calling them naughty boys, so I made myself back off. I went and whispered to Lian instead, and we broke down in quiet tears of laughter at the concept of horny Sadiri. Our seats were midhouse near the central aisledecent enough for what we were seeing and hearing. It was of a style referred to as neo-opera. It combined an absence of technological enhancement with a blend of contemporary styles of music, which meant that the performers had to be both vocally powerful and versatile. I wish I had time to tell you about the whole neo-opera movement and how it relates to the rustica backlash against audio smoothing and augmentation in musical performance and realissimo effects in holovidding. I will say that there is a simplicity in the staging. Not minimalistthats another stylebut a simplicity that pretends at amateurism but most definitely isnt. I wasnt the least surprised to find that the mysterious golden girl was the leading lady, Nedda. Only a diva could risk turning up that late and not expect to be fired. I was surprised at the modesty of her costume, covering to neck and ankle and wrist. She was good, perhaps a little weak in the singing but with a presence and expressiveness that made up for it. Her husband, Canio, was played by a tall, dark, brooding type who seemed destined to go the Othello route, because this girl was just too popular. In addition to having a lover, Silvio, she had also attracted the attentionsunwanted, alasof Taddeo. Silvio was unexpectedly weedy and scholarly, but Taddeo was boyish and sweetly besotted, offering a kind of comic foil to the unrelenting and obsessive passion of the two older men. The performers were not Terran method actors. Method actors call up a strange mask of remembered emotion and fit it to the situation on stage. You can feel the reality of it, but something jars a tiny bit if you know what to look for. These ones were of the Ntshune verisimilitude school, which is very similar but can only be mastered by those with a touch of empathic ability. Basically, the actors draw on one anothers feelings, and sometimes one great actor is all that is needed to provoke the right emotions and reactions from the rest of the company. Im mentioning this to give a reason for what I was doing. I was reading the actors. Sadiri ethics on telepathy do not match Ntshune ethics on empathy. To the Sadiri, thoughts may be shared but are still considered private for the most part, and emotions are definitely private and must be shielded against as much as possible. Most Ntshune are comfortable reading anyones emotions. Its part of how we communicate. We wouldnt pry for feelings that arent intended for us, but projected emotions are fair game. A lot of Ntshune-influenced Cygnian cultures have internalized this distinction. So when I turned and whispered excitedly to Dllenahkh that I was picking up real jealousy from one of the actors on stage, he gave me a look that made me feel like Joral on the receiving end of a lecture on Sadiri comportment. I was confused. During the intermission, he pulled me aside and asked sternly, What has Nasiha been teaching you? I gave him a very old-fashioned look. What I did in there has nothing to do with what Nasiha is teaching me. I was simply reading the actors, as I always do. He didnt back down. The training you are receiving will improve and focus your empathic abilities, making casual use particularly unethical at this stage. I thought that you of all people would appreciate this. Dllenahkh! Theyre actors! Im not digging for state secrets; Im trying to enjoy the play at another level! Now, lighten up, please. People are looking at us strangely. I dont think theyve ever seen a Sadiri arguing before. He exhaled slowly. I am not arguing. I had only been teasing him, but there was a tiny bit of stress on the word not, and for a moment he closed his eyes a fraction longer than a blink. Of course you arent, I said quietly, suddenly repentant. I wont do it again if it bothers you, okay? During the second act, I found myself distracted by Dllenahkhs unusual moodiness. He sat beside me, his attention entirely on the stage, but there was a set to his features that spoke of endurance rather than enjoyment. I began to feel guilty, but then when I glanced at Joral and Tarik, they appeared absorbed and interested. Not just a general Sadiri thing, then. Then I saw it. It wasnt empathyit was clearly visible on the mans face. Canio looked across at Nedda, and his eyes spoke murder. I grasped Dllenahkhs arm. Tell me you didnt see that. Grace, he remonstrated, firmly removing my hand. I did something then that was definitely unethical. In that rare moment of skin-to-skin contact between our hands, I reached out to read Canio. An ugly wave of jealousy and hatred came from Canio, washing over us like fouled water. Dllenahkhs hand convulsed on mine, for a moment gripping so tightly that it hurt, then fell away quickly. How did you do that? He sounded more stunned than disapproving this time. Shhh! Listen! I whispered frantically. It wasnt the right word perhaps, but he understood, because slowly, almost unwillingly, he put his arm along the back of my seat and rested his palm discreetly against my temple. I concentrated on the scene before me. It was a moment of high drama when Canio is acting the part of Pagliaccio and becomes so overwhelmed with jealousy and passion that he forgets he is on stage and pressures Nedda to tell him the name of her lover. When he picked up a knife, I shivered; when he chased her off the ministage, caught her, and stabbed her in the belly, I jumped and turned away. I wasnt the only one in the audience who did so, but I was probably the only one whose disbelief hadnt been suspended. Dllenahkh broke contact with my temple and gripped my shoulder reassuringly. Silvio was the next to be stabbed, but there was no emotion behind that one, only the actors facade, the leftover grimace of pain and disgust from the earlier attack. I shivered again. I have to get out of here, I muttered. I stood up and left just as the last notes of the final song were ringing out. Lian was the first to come to me as I paced up and down in the foyer. What was that about? You looked like you were going to be sick. Are you okay? Yes. No. I dont know. I paced some more, biting my nails. I dont know what happened in there. Well, whatever it was, youve made Joral, Tarik, and Dllenahkh go into deep discussion. I stopped, suddenly self-conscious. Really? What are they saying? Sadiris not my thing, remember? Lian remarked. Here they are. Just ask them. They looked horribly serious, more serious than even a Sadiri had any right to look. I cowered instantly, anticipating criticism. Im sorry Apologies are not necessary, said Tarik. We wish to know more about your experience of what happened during the performance. Dllenahkh looked around the foyer, now filling with people on their way out. But not here. Let us return to our lodgings. Qeturah was already asleep when we got back, but after Tarik brought Nasiha into the sitting room of our hotel, Lian frowned, shrugged, and went to get Fergus, so there was almost a full house for the meeting. Dllenahkh spoke immediately to Nasiha, not even waiting for her to be seated. Your pupil did something unusual tonight. Instantly intrigued, Nasiha settled herself in a chair and said, Oh? She was able to obtain strong readings of an actors emotions during the performance, Dllenahkh stated. Nasiha looked disappointed. Oh. She is capable on occasion of almost Ntshune sensitivity in reading peoples emotions, but so far she has not been consistent in displaying this ability. It is nothing to be concerned about. That was not what was unusual. I straightened in surprise. During the time she was detecting his emotions, our hands touched. I found myself in that instant able to read, albeit faintly, the thoughts of the actornot his emotions, his thoughts. I found this sufficiently intriguing that I attempted, with permission, a unidirectional link with Delaruas mind. I found myself reading not her thoughts but the actors, and with even greater clarity. Nasiha frowned. Some Cygnians are capable of noncontact telepathy; however, it usually requires a strong level of projection from both parties. Moreover, we have already noted that Delaruas telepathic abilities are almost nil. There is more, Tarik said, giving Dllenahkh a significant look. Dllenahkh returned the look steadily as he spoke to Nasiha. I consider that the actors thoughts clearly indicated an intent to commit murder. The actor was playing the part of a jealous husband, Tarik pointed out. It sounded as if he had appointed himself devils advocate. What is your opinion on this, Delarua? Nasiha asked me. I dont know. I didnt hear any thoughts. I didnt know thats what Dllenahkh was doing. I thought he was picking up the emotions, same as I was. It wasnt acting, I can tell you that. When he took up the knife I shuddered again, feeling sick. It might be prudent to advise the authorities, said Dllenahkh. Advise them of what precisely? asked Tarik mildly. This was going nowhere. Look, Nasiha, why dont you just come see for yourself? I blurted out. Sit next to me, put me in some kind of parallel link or whatever it is you need to do. I would be interested in attending if only to determine what your mind is doing, she mused. Wait a minute, Fergus objected suddenly. Shouldnt you clear this with the Commissioner? Of course we will, Fergus, Lian said. But theyre not kidding about this. It could be something serious, and it cant hurt to be sure. I was glad Lian had been there to see our reaction and was therefore on our side, because when we informed Qeturah the following morning, she wasnt convinced. I cant stop you from going if you think its really necessary, she said, but it seems a waste of time to me. You could come with us, I suggested. The more objective witnesses, the better. Im not that fond of neo-opera, she said wryly, and I dont see why I should have to suffer. You can call me if anything happens. Lian stayed with her, but she let us take Fergus. Tarik stated that he would prefer not to sit through the entire thing again, and when he admitted that, Joral was happy to volunteer to stay behind as well. I didnt mind. I was well contented with the troops Id been given. They did at least come to see us off in the hotel lobby that evening. Nice dress, said Lian, all raised eyebrows. And the kohls made a reappearance too, I see. Nasiha insisted that we get front-row seats. A little more effort is required, I said, primly adjusting the knee-length hem of my sapphire-blue dress. Ha! See? The others were also dressed for the occasion. Im not a clothes horse, but I can appreciate when someone finds a style that works for them. Nasiha was stunning in a severe, high-waisted, long-sleeved burgundy dress that came to her ankles. Dllenahkh and Fergus had only to blend in and chose to do so with the traditional black: Dllenahkh very dashing in a high-collared shirt under a hip-length tunic with matching trousers and Fergus in a similar shirt, but with a short jacket that, to be honest, showed off the close fit of his trousers rather nicely. I had no idea what to expect when we took our seats in the theater, Nasiha on my left, Dllenahkh on my right, Fergus next to Dllenahkh. Nasiha must have sensed my trepidation, for she said to me, Delarua, all that is required is for you to relax. We will do whatever else is needed. I inhaled deeply, nodded, and began the calming exercises she had taught me, closing my eyes for better focus. I felt when she touched her palm briefly to my face and when Dllenahkh did the same. Then she murmured, Your mind senses us dimly. How curious. I assume Dllenahkh is the elephant, which means I am the cat. I chuckled to myself. I hadnt thought about it, but yeah, thats how I picture you. She was silent for a while longer. This is most strange. Dllenahkh, was yesterday the first time that you linked your mind to Delaruas? There are connections between your minds that suggest a deeper level of bonding than could be achieved by a single one-way link. Shh, said Dllenahkh, sounding a bit stifled. The orchestra is starting. I was very relieved that he spoke, for my usual reaction to any mention of our time with the adepts was an uncontrollable clenching of the jaw. The production remained free of incident till intermission time and beyond. As the ending of the second act drew near, I sat forward slightly, eager to catch a glimpse of something to prove we werent crazy. But Canio was passionately acting, nothing more. Nedda was giving an uneven but enthusiastic performance. I began to scan the other characters: Silvio, Taddeo, random people in the chorus. Nothing seemed unusual except that Taddeos acting was a bit flat compared with the day before. I frowned, wondering if I should feel disappointed or relieved that nothing was going to happen. It is the knife, Nasiha whispered suddenly. It is, Dllenahkh confirmed. For a moment I was baffled, and then understanding coalesced into a horrific image. The knife! I yelled. Dont use it! Its real! I started to move. I didnt expect anyone to take my yelling seriously. This was a touring production; they were probably too accustomed to shouts of Look behind you! whether they were called for or not. Canio was a professional, all right. He didnt even blink at the interruption as he came down from the tiny stage onstage to confront Nedda in his manufactured fury. He pulled back his arm, blade at the ready, and drove it at her abdomen. But Nedda knew. Somehow, between my shout and (who knows) some telepathic or empathic sense of her own, she did not stand to take the blade full on, as she had done the night before. She turned her body, but too late to avoid a slash that tore costume and skin and drenched all in blood. She stumbled, fell to her knees, then collapsed completely. Thoroughly fooled, the real audience gasped and applauded in appreciation for the unexpected twist of high-quality special effects. The stage audience, on the other hand, reacted very badly, well aware that things were not going as rehearsed. A mad, high scream sounded over the general uproar. Finish it! Finish it! Snatching the knife from the distraught Canios immobile hand, Taddeo lunged for Nedda where she lay gashed, bleeding, but not yet seriously harmed. It was enough time for me to scramble up the central stage steps and throw myself at him. Dont ask me how this happened. I am no superwoman, and I would never have done that sort of nonsense in a million years, but I blame the empathic connection. My adrenaline was as high as his, and I was terrified that someone was going to die in front of me. I must have surprised Nasiha and Dllenahkh, because they moved belatedly and had to contend with the bedlam of the audience pouring down the stage steps and jumping into the orchestra pit. I realized my folly when he turned the knife on me. I twisted frantically and felt the blade tug my dress as the fabric was pierced and sliced from belly to shoulder. The point of the knife went mercifully up the space between my breasts and just missed my carotid artery. Then he disappeared in a crunching thud, Dllenahkh and Fergus side tackling him with such force that I swore one or two of his bones must have broken somewhere. Ow, I said weakly, and sat down suddenly on the stage, trying to hold the top of my dress together. Are you injured, Delarua? Nasiha asked, crouching down beside me. No. Well, yes, but not by the blade. I think I pulled a muscle ducking that knife. Even as I spoke, I was looking around her to see what Neddas fate had been. She was sitting up, surrounded by help. Someone had already brought out a medkit to begin treating her wound. I shall call the Commissioner, said Nasiha, looking around in faint distaste at all the confusion. It will help if a high-ranking official corroborates ourunique evidence. She was right. If it hadnt been for Qeturah, we might have ended up detained for questioning, but her presence plus Sadiri gravitas meant that Nasiha and I were interviewed very courteously by a constable in one of the dressing rooms while I tried to patch the bodice of my dress with strips of gaffer tape. When the constable was finished, she informed us that the rest of the team were waiting for us in the green room and we were free to go. Wont you tell us what really happened? I begged her. Cant give out the details of the case before trial, maam, she said laconically. Then she looked at my pleading eyes and relented with a shrug, Lets just say that a mnage  trois can get really messy when it implodes. Give me a straightforward one-on-one any day, but city folk like to get creativeno offense to you, maam. None taken, I said. Im homestead born and bred myself. I just work in the city sometimes. Smiling at that, she thanked us and left, taking her handheld with the record of our interviews. I stood up and shifted my shoulders uncertainly, looking in the brightly lit mirror at my pathetic repair attempt. Do you think thisll hold, Nasiha? Or am I asking for trouble? Excuse me? The shy words were accompanied by a soft knock. The girl with the glow, Nedda, the star herself, was at the door, peering in anxiously at me and Nasiha. She had changed her clothes and was carrying a garment bag over her shoulder. Apart from a slight shadowing under her eyes, she looked very much alive. Youre okay! I said gleefully. You really are okay! She broke into the biggest grin. They tell me I have you to thank for that. She put her hand to her mouth, seemingly horrified. Oh, your dress! Your pretty dress! Some women are like that about clothes. Skin heals, but a really good dress is irreplaceable. I wasnt even scratched, I told her. But you cant go out like that! She cleared the counter of cosmetics with a sweep of her arm and flung the garment bag down. I watched as she unsealed it, impressed at the drama with which she invested every move, then began to stammer and demur when I understood her intentions. Nonsense, she insisted. Here. I had it cleaned just yesterday. It rivaled the head turner of the previous night. Dark gold, extremely short, and with creative, decorative ventilating slits in the bodice, it would have caused an entire colony of Sadiri to stumble. Oh, I cant wear this! I exclaimed. Youyouve got the legs for it. I dont. Yes, you do, she chided. Try it on. I stammered some more. Her face fell. Youre right. Maybe if I wore dresses like that more often, she said, nodding at Nasihas austere look, I wouldnt have so many problems. No, dont say that! I cried in dismay. Why would you say that? Dont make this your fault. It is certainly not your fault, said Nasiha. You are not even sufficiently Zhinuvian to impose any mental influence. Nedda looked suddenly happy. You can tell? Oh, thats such a relief! One Zhinuvian great-grandparent, and I get smacked with the glimmer skin and the shiny hair and stupid attitudes from men and women. Funny thing, genetics. Actually, Im mostly Ntshune; can you believe it? I can, I said cheerfully. Dark eyes, wildly curly hair, sunny disposition We grinned at each other. I started to strip. There was no way I was going to make this nice girl feel bad by refusing her help. Oh, it does fit! Just a bit longer on me, but thatsooooh, hey, youve got antigrav boosters in here! Niiice! I threw caution, and my bra, to the wind, the former metaphorically, the latter literally. Its perfect, she proclaimed. Keep it. Something to remember me by. She sealed her bag again and waved to us as she headed for the door. Thanks again! Bye! I laughed happily. Test her, Nasiha. Ill bet she projects significantly on the frenzy scale. Hmm, said Nasiha. She is indeed very beautiful and extremely vivacious. I hope you meant what you said to her. What? That this is not her fault. There was a small silence. Wow, youre taking lessons from Qeturah now? I said, but without rancor. Okay, I get it. Barring the unethical use of Zhinuvian-strength mesmeric influence, I am not responsible for any foolishness that a man might care to perpetrate on my behalf. Good. Now let us rejoin the others. Or rather, and here she looked at me with eyes that narrowed ever so slightly with amusement, I will go and arrange transportation while you rejoin the others and tell them to meet me outside. I think it will be kinder for Tarik if I am not present when you walk in wearing that dress. Self-consciousness returned in a rush, but before I could reconsider, Nasiha had already departed with the shreds of my dress and my bra. I pulled myself together and went into the green room, walking with my head down as if guilty of some immense social crime. When I finally dared to glance up briefly, I almost wished I hadnt, because it only made me want to giggle. Jorals eyes were suddenly trained on the ceiling, Tariks were fixed unseeingly on the ground, and Ferguss mouth was open as he stared at me. DllenahkhI didnt have time to notice what he was doing. My dress was ruined, I said defensively to the floor. Of course, said Qeturah smoothly, and how kind of them to provide you with something to wear home. Behind her, Lian exploded into a fit of snorts and chuckles. If anyone would like to lend me a coat, I said, my tone dignified and affronted. The night is quite warm, said Dllenahkh innocently. Are you sure that a coat will be required? Id had enough. I raised my chin and walked up to him, pausing at thirty centimeters, which, for a Sadiri, is well within the personal space boundary. Everyone fell silent; smiles faltered and faded. You tell me, I challenged him through gritted teeth. He bowed his head as if in apology, but that wasnt all. Unfastening the front of his tunic, he shrugged it off his shoulders and draped it carefully around me. Thank you, I told him, teeth ungritted. Lian heaved a huge sigh. Im not fat and I cant sing, but, ladies and gentlemen, can we please go now? La commedia  finita. Zero hour plus one year five months four days He fell asleep that night smiling at the memory of Delarua, adorably horrified at discovering her capacity for seductiveness but refusing to retreat nonetheless. Such thoughts should have led to better dreams, but the recent drama had awakened other, darker memories that would not be denied. The nightmares were lying in wait for him. He was sitting on a ridge looking down at a familiar place, a place where he had once lived: smooth, cool residential domes in pale clusters like bunched fruit on a vine; branching, twining roadways connecting all together; a gray-green land under blue sky. It was not where he had lived last, but it was where he had lived longest, and the events that led to his leaving had been his first experience of how suddenly and utterly an ordinary life can shatter. How does it feel now? A small savanna dog sat by his knee, sending the query mind to mind with a clarity that only a dream could provide. It focused sad eyes on him with gentle concern, waiting for an answer. Its empty, he said with reluctance. Theres no one alive there, only ghosts knocking on my soul. Already a sense of dread was growing, warning him that the dream was about to go badly wrong. A corner of sky obliged by turning blacknot the black of storm cloud but a true malignancy boiling out like ink to tint and taint the atmosphere. They are already dead, he declared defiantly. There is no need for this. The dog scrambled up. Id get out of here if I were you, it whined, looking on in terror as the sky was eaten. It skittered back, hesitated, and finally dashed away into the tall grass behind Dllenahkh. Wait! Dllenahkh shouted, standing up in haste. The ridge was crumbling under his feet, but that was ordinary fear. The real nightmare came from the cold starlight shining through the encroaching darkness, the type of starlight that shines only on lifeless moons. Its done, its over, he insisted, telling the dream, telling himself. The untenanted houses and silent roads vanished in permanent dusk. He could not stop looking as the last of them went, even as his feet slipped and his hands grasped uselessly at loose soil and dry grass, trying to stop himself from falling, falling into nothing, falling forever. Wake up, Councillor. Tariks hand on his shoulder was a welcome anchoring. He sat up slowly, fighting the trailing remnants of the dream. What is it, Tarik? Whats wrong? Tarik gestured to Dllenahkhs handheld on the table by his bed. A message from New Sadira just came in. Nasiha thought you should know as soon as possible. He woke up at last on a rush of adrenaline and grabbed his handheld. Do you know what its about? The commander observes official protocol on secrecy to the letter, Tarik said with far too much sincerity in his voice. Dllenahkh said no more, knowing all too well that those rules said nothing about what might be communicated wordlessly by a superior officer to her lower-ranking husband. He looked at his handheld instead. When he finished reading and rereading, he looked up, but Tarik had left already. He turned off the handheld and lay down again, but the roil of emotions within him was so strong that he had to speak. So, he said triumphantly to the darkness. Naraldi has come back to Cygnus Beta.          THE MASTERS HOUSE Do you think Nasiha will continue with us? I asked the Commissioner. We were standing on the quayside watching supplies being winched aboard our new shuttle, a vessel capable of air and sea travel. Publicity surrounding the mission had been very positive, with more settlements asking to be tested for genetic or cultural Sadiri traits. As a result, our budget had been increased. Id be very surprised if she left now, Qeturah said with a smile. She seems to have some idea that to take time off for pregnancy would set a bad example. Something about not creating the impression that females are fragile and childbearing is unusual. She checks out as perfectly healthy, so she can do as she pleases. Maria was fine for Rafi. Gracie gave her a little more trouble, I began, then shut my mouth. Even Marias ailments might have been due to influence and were therefore not the best of examples. Satisfied with the verdict? Qeturah asked after a short pause. I shrugged. About what was expected. Ioans highly specific abilities and his apparently genuine contrition had landed him a fairly mild sentence of a years rehabilitation to be followed by lifelong monitoring via subcortical implant. And he couldnt see Maria and the children again. Ever. The prosecutor hadnt been able to prove ill intent, but there had been reasonable doubt (hah!), and as a result the courts ruling showed both mercy and caution. Homesteads rented out now, and theyre spending time at my mothers place. Rafis attending a special school. Hes not that impressed with it, but hell adjust. I knew I sounded like I was reeling off a report, but I figured I wasnt saying anything she didnt already know, and it catered to the illusion that I was once more willing to talk to her about my private life. It seemed to work, because Qeturah simply nodded, waited a few seconds, then changed the subject. Nasiha asked me about medical techniques to prolong a womans years of fertility. I raised my eyebrows, absently multitasking as I ticked items off the inventory on my handheld and yelled an order to the longshoremen. Sorry, you were saying? Prolonging fertility? Shes quite young by Sadiri standards; why should she be worrying about that now? Oh, it wasnt for her. It was for you. I nearly dropped my handheld. What? Why in the name of allwhat businessme? What did I ever do to her? Qeturah almost laughed out loud. Relax, Delarua. Its a complimentI think. She was saying that you should be registered on the special list for potential Sadiri brides, and when I pointed out that there was an upper age limit for that, she suggested that extending your fertile years would take care of any objections. I was already dazedly shaking my head at the wrongness of it all. Dont worry. I told her that with the amount of Ntshune heritage you have, youll probably be able to have children for quite a bit longer than the average Cygnian. I estimate you have another twenty-five years, maybe even thirty. Qeturah! I hissed, glancing furtively at the nearest longshoreman. Must we discuss my private business out in the open where anyone could hear? What kind of doctor are you? I expected it to be a more-than-routine assignment. The Kirtahsg Islands were famed for their remoteness and inaccessibility and as such were the genetic and cultural equivalent of a vacuum-sealed flask. We always looked forward with interest to Ferguss safety briefings about the flora and fauna and the emergency exit strategy, but this time it was the Commissioners talk that got our attention. Protocol must be strictly observed, she said. Is this one of the highly formal places? Even more formal than the Seelie Court? I asked. She folded her arms in a way I recognized as an attempt at self-support before saying something difficult. More than that. I want you all dressed in your most ceremonial garb. Titles must be used at all times. Its a society that relies on external cues to determine a persons rank and how they should be treated. She looked at us individually to make her point. Councillor. First Officer. Commander. Lieutenant. Sergeant. Corporal Lian, Im giving you a rather sudden and substantial temporary promotion to full aide-de-camp, which inflates both your importance and mine. Councillor, I recommend that you refer to Joral as your first secretary. She scanned us again, as if seeing us with an objective eye. Interplanetary Science Council formal blues. Civil Service formal blacks with white robe. Military Service dress whites. Whatever is appropriate for Sadiri culture, and dont be modest. Wear all medals and special decorations. The gulf between servant and master is wide and deep in this place. I dont want any of you stranded on the wrong side. Our first sight of the main, eponymous island was as forbidding as the Commissioners briefing. There was nothing resembling a beach or a landing strip. High rocks surged straight up out of violent surf, and the entire landscape seemed to consist of inclines of forty-five degrees or greater. There was evidence of civilization, however. Inland, terraced gardens girdled the hills like green ribbons bordered by hewn gray rock. The same gray rock rose up as walled cities, which then blended into bare gray mountain, making it difficult to see where man-made wall ended and natural cliff began. They say kirtahsg means invincible in some long-dead Cygnian language, and it was easy to see how the island had earned its name. We had to land in open ocean, submerge, and then resurface in a huge, hangarlike cave. The welcome, however, was far warmer than the first impression. Our group was taken by hovercar to the Hall of the Master of Kirtahsg, an impressive palace in the central citadel surrounded by extensive gardens with tidily trimmed trees and manicured lawns. I was expecting the minimalist decor naturally preferred by the Sadiri mind, a mind that can be sucked into pondering fractal formulas at the mere sight of a Paisley-patterned rug. Not so, neither outdoors nor in. The servants and officials of the Masters household were richly dressed. It was not ostentatiousness; it was a more subtle show of plain though rich fabrics, simple but skillfully made embroideries. Precious metals and gems in a classic, understated design were displayed in the furnishings and ornaments and on the wrists and necks and ears of the nobles and higher-ranked servants. The nobles also wore their hair long, tied back with jeweled velvet bands or enameled clasps. Oh, yes, the hair. Let me tell you about the hair. It was too obvious and a little discomfiting. The Master, the officers of his guard, the Masters Heir, and all other persons of rank or standing at the Hall were Sadiri as Sadiri could be. Their hair shone brightly, and their skin had a very slight Zhinuvian-like glow. The servants, on the other hand, all had dull, close-cut hair and low-luminance skin. I understood Qeturahs desire to have us Terran types look as official as possible. The Master was as impressive as the Faerie Queen, but his was an aged and venerable appearance. He did not rise from his seat even though he appeared to be lean and physically fit. He had us seated according to our rank and post and listened courteously as Dllenahkh and Qeturah made their requests. At first I thought everything would go easily, because when his eyes rested on the Sadiri, it was with an air of great gladness and contentment, as if he were seeing something finally come to pass after a long wait. I was wrong. Regretfully, we must decline to participate in this genetic testing, the Master stated baldly. Qeturah was taken aback at this stark refusal, given without excuse. We find genetic testing useful to determine compatibility. We also use it as a guide to assessing the average psionic potential of members of a community. The Master smiled. With respect to psionic abilities, I can immediately inform you that we have none. Practice of the mental disciplines has, alas, died out, and with them all the telepathic skills of our ancestors. As for compatibility with the Sadiriwell, look at us. He waved languidly as if to indicate their entirely Sadiri appearance, but I couldnt help glancing at the short-haired Terran servants. Still bemused, Qeturah reached for a glass from a tray offered by a small boy, but her fingers failed to grip it safely and it smashed on the floor. Im so sorry she began. The butler of the Hall interrupted her with a terse command to the boy that sounded to me like see you do not fail again or we will ensure that you do not fail again. It might have been the latter, because the boy went wide-eyed with fear and fell to his knees, trying to gather up the pieces of glass. While I was watching this closely, I heard the Master say, Take the boy out and bring another glass of refreshment for the Commissioner. The boy, naturally, looked even more terrified and cut his hand on an edged fragment. Nasiha erupted from her seat, stepping heedlessly over the broken bits and debris with an intimidating crunching noise. She picked up the boy and held his fist firmly to staunch the trickle of blood that was threatening to stain the marble tiles. I will take him out, she informed the Master bluntly. Have this cleaned up, she told the startled butler. Delarua, she continued, our medkit. Hurry. The Master only smiled faintly. I think he was accustomed to something that I was only just learningpregnant Sadiri are not to be trifled with. I raced to Qeturahs rooms for the medkit and returned to the corridor outside the reception room, where Nasiha was speaking soothingly to the boy. We got him cleaned and sealed up in a matter of minutes. He stood gazing in awe at his hand as I packed away the medkit. Run along, now, said Nasiha kindly. He did so, giving us an uncertain smile. Nasiha, I dont mean to be rude, but have you found yourself to be a bitwell I couldnt use the word emotional. A bit more vehement than usual, perhaps. Of course, she snapped. It is a natural consequence of the pregnancy. The maternal, protective urge must increase. Oh, well, as long as its natural, I mumbled dubiously. She looked at me impassively and handed me a small sample vial filled with red fluid. Whats this? I said, thoroughly confused but taking it nonetheless. The boys blood. Likely some skin as well. I think you should test it. I frowned. Im not sure I should. Theres no real medical reason for it, and the Master did bar us from genetic testing. Nasiha nodded. I understand. But answer me this, Delarua. When I held the boys hand, I detected that the concentration of telepathic receptors in his palm was far above the average amount for Terrans. How does he come to be a servant in a household that seems to have taSadiri nobility and a Terran servant class? I blinked at this new information. That does make me curious, I admitted. But dont tell the Commissioner, okay? This is off the record. I went to her quarters early the next day. Terran, yes, but also a bit of Sadiri and quite a lot of Zhinuvian. How did you guess? Nasiha shrugged. When the Master speaks, there is much that he keeps back. The nobles of the Hall and the higher-ranking servants have taken similar lessons in evasion. It has been my experience that a rich and well-run household is like an iceberg. You see the tip, but you must ask about the invisible ninety percent that holds it up. Tarik, who had been quietly listening for some time, said something disconcerting. I have further information on that ninety percent. I rose before sunrise as usual for my meditation and looked out through our window down at the Citadel. I saw street sweepers and garbage collectors. I was unsure at the time, due to the distance from which I was observing, but given this new information, I believe I can say with certainty that they were Zhinuvian. I think it is time we spoke to the Commissioner, Nasiha decided. Please find a way to leave out my part in this, I begged her. She gave me a look. Fine. I sighed. Why dont I go get Dllenahkh and Joral for you? Joral was nearby in the quarters he shared with Dllenahkh, so I simply directed him to report to Nasiha. I had to go outside to find Dllenahkh. Nasiha had made some concessions to her delicate condition and as a result had declined an invitation from the Heir to go horse riding. Tarik had opted to stay with her and be the good and supportive husband, which left Dllenahkh to bond with the Heir. They were galloping around a small racetrack girdling a paddock. It looked like a lot of fun. The Heir was winning, but not by much, in deference to his guest. Youre a natural, Councillor! I heard him cry merrily. Dllenahkh carefully reined in his mount, which was still excitable after the brief run. We have similar beasts on the Sadiri homesteadings. I have ridden a time or two before. Then he looked around and saw me. Delarua! I made a bow. By your leave, Your Grace. Councillor, your presence is requested up at the Hall. It was partly my fault, I know. As I bowed, I peeked up to look at the Heir. His hair was tied back with a scarlet cord except for two long locks falling almost into his eyes. When I straightened, I even took a glance at Dllenahkh, assessing his hair in comparison. It was windswept from the gallop, pushed to one side of his forehead in an untidy dark brown wave, but even with hair cut more like a servant than a noble, he still managed to look more regal than the Heir. The Heir, however, saw only the glance directed to him and took my caution for flirtation and my curiosity for interest. Youre new, he said, swinging himself down from the saddle with a grin. He walked up to me and set the tip of his small whip under my chin. I barely had time to go wide-eyed with shock and outrage before a shadow fell over us. He looked at Dllenahkh with a sly smile. Sorry, Councillor. One of yours? There was a moment of complete silence as Dllenahkh pointedly ignored the question. May I present First Officer Grace Delarua, member of this mission and second in civil rank to the Commissioner, Dllenahkh finally said, his bland tone a warning all unto itself. The Heir raised his eyebrows, blinked, and dismissed me, turning his attention back to Dllenahkh. We should race again before you go. Tomorrow, perhaps? See you at dinner. He strode off, striking his leg idly with his whip. What was that? I said, stunned at such discourtesy. I suspect you are not noble enough to marry nor yet common enough to bed, Dllenahkh mused clinically, following the Heirs departure with narrowed eyes. I gathered from his conversation that in his world women rarely serve any other purpose. Creep, I said succinctly. Look, Im here because Nasiha and the Commissioner want to have a chat with you. Think you can tear yourself away from your new friend? With pleasure, Dllenahkh said, matching my flat tone. It strikes me, Delarua, that this society is far more about appearance than substance where being Sadiri is concerned. Oh, you wise, wise man, I replied, sighing. I escorted Dllenahkh to Qeturahs rooms, where Nasiha and Tarik were waiting. Fergus, who was stationed at the door, seemed to be glowering a touch more than usual, but he gave me a sideways glance and something in his eyes lightened briefly. Like to get your hands on some genetic samples? he said in much the same tone that a Tlaxce City hustler would use to describe rare and reasonably priced merchandise that might or might not have fallen off the back of a freight car. You know I would, I breathed just as quietly. Good, he said, and turned to his colleague. Lian, if the Commissioner needs anything, cover for me. Ill be back soon. Lian looked disapproving but merely went into position beside the door in reproachful silence. Fergus looked me up and down, assessing my appearance. Take off the white robe. The blacks will pass for ordinary wear. What about Joral? I asked, removing the garment and pressing it into Lians hands. Shouldnt he come too? I might need help. He cant come. He looks too much like them, Fergus muttered as he started off. Okay, I said, following his long stride with some difficulty. Whats going on exactly? Lian and I discovered a few things yesterday that we thought should be brought to your attention. He ducked down a small staircase. I was just about to ask him why he hadnt simply spoken to Qeturah when he came to a closed door, knocked, and said something unrecognizable. What language is that? I dont know it, I said. He gave me a somber look. Id be very surprised if you did. The door opened, a few centimeters at first and then wider. Inside was a small group of people seated around a table, a very mixed company indeed. Fergus drew me in while I stared, reading the social language of their attire. There were higher-ranked servants and lower-order domestics. There were also menials I had not seen before, with rough plain garments, shaven heads, and skin that gleamed in the dimly sunlit room. Fergus broke the oppressive silence. Tell her, and speak quickly. We dont have much time. A tall man with pale eyes and shining skin stood up. I am Elion. These are some of the people who have been told to disappear for the duration of your visit. Let me show you why. He indicated himself. Zhinuvian, youd think, by the look of me, but my father was a noble. But with these eyes theres neither status nor work for me within the Masters household. He moved on to a beautiful woman with dull olive skin, brown eyes, and long, shining locs that fell over her face. Surprisingly, she was wearing the clothes of a higher-ranked servant. My half sister. My mother had such hopes! She was the first of our family to rise above the servant class. But none of her children have lived longer than a week. The first had no eyes, the rest had deformed hands and feet, all of them had weak hearts. Now they fear to allow her to bear more children, hence the demotionand the warning. He drew aside her hair so I could see the brand that marred her face from temple to jaw, a broad featureless scar that had neither letter nor symbol and served no other purpose but to make her ugly. She kept her head lowered, blushing ruddy with shame. The next woman at the table was a little darker of skin than Qeturah, but with hair so brightly black that it glowed with an iridescent green, clearly unlike the glossy browns and blue-black common to the Sadiri. Zhinuvian and Terran. Youve met her son. You helped him when he cut himself. No matter. Hes been punished since in a place where they dont mind if the blood flows. What I began, then faltered at my rudeness in interrupting. I mean, I think I understand what youre telling me, but what do you expect me to do about it? Our Sadiri colleagues are already aware that they are not being shown all of Kirtahsg. Theyre not easily fooled. And if youre worried about how the boy is being treated, why not simply go to the local authorities? A Zhinuvian-looking woman who had not yet been introduced spoke up, worriedly addressing Fergus in that strange tongue. He replied in a reassuring tone. This is Karya, said Elion. She is a new arrival to the household. A Zhinuvian slavebought, not Citadel-born. Slavery doesnt exist on Cygnus Beta, I said sharply, not keen on being played for a softhearted fool. Arent you paid wages? Every one of you must be registered on the Revenue and Pensions system. Theres no way the Master could get around that. Elions mouth curved up in a cynical smile. All you have to do is claim the credits appropriately. The cost of our food, our shelter, our clothingsomehow it all balances out perfectly. Impossible. The government looks for that kind of dodge. Oh, there is an excess of credits. But it doesnt come to us. Its paid in installments to our former owners. The Master has ties to a cartel on Zhinu, Fergus said quietly. Theyve been buying from them for generations, and when theres infertility, or birth defects, or rebellion, some selling happens too. You dont have to believe us, said Karya proudly, but take our genetic data. Someone might still be registered as missing. Youll get the genetic profile you want, and well get the chance to be found. People always think genetic analysis can do miracles. There was no global database yet. We were not connected to any galactic database. There was no guarantee that we could find a missing person file with matching DNA. I shook my head at the folly even as I heard myself saying, Yes. The data that came to me was disturbingly thorough. They did not only provide samples of their own DNA. The nobility of the Citadel was well represented as their maidservants, valets, and cleaning staff ransacked their rooms and personal effects for genetic traces. Lian gave me a slightly anxious frown as I accepted the first of the stolen samples, but I replied with silence and Lian acknowledged with a slow, still-worried nod. I could not leave Kirtahsg without answers, ethics or no. I left Fergus and Lian to see to the collection of the rest of the samples so I could get started in the lab, but I was still forced to press Joral into service to get the analysis completed within three days. The results were all too clear. Joral was puzzled. I do not understand. Have we not encountered three genetically distinct groups on Kirtahsg: taSadiri, Terran, and Zhinuvian? Looks are deceiving, Joral, Lian muttered dourly. Exactly, I snapped. You could choose a mirror-skinned, pale-eyed, dull-haired servant and youd have the same chance of getting Sadiri characteristics out of the brew as with any of those shiny-haired elitists. But we have seen this before. What has made you so angry? Joral queried. Besides the borderline slavery, you mean? said Fergus, his tone caustic. Easy, man. He didnt see what we saw, Lian said, trying to pacify him. We only have Elions word for the wages setup, I cautioned. Lets not fling accusations without a proper inquiry. Fergus gave me a stare. Not you too, he snarled. What do you mean? I asked, frowning. The Commissioner. She told me that were not to interfere, that its not our job. Well, like it or not, shes right! I exclaimed. You planning to be a one-man army? You think you can bring down the local government? His face set in a determined mask. The armys already there. All they need is a little leadership and some key bits of intelligence. Oh, no. I laughed hollowly. Thats not going to happen, Sergeant. Not feasible, murmured Lian, though a touch regretfully. He grinned fiercely at Lian, part gallows humor, part warning. That field promotion you got is just for decoration. I still outrank you, so if I say we go Youll say nothing of the sort, I shouted. If it comes to that, I outrank you, and were not doing anything so stupid just because your heads all tied up by a pretty Zhinuvian! Fergus turned on me, and for a moment I honestly thought he was going to hit me. I was enslaved by the Zhinuvians, he said. What? I said, my fury erased in an instant by utter shock. Theyve got the best merchant fleet in the galaxy. Do you really think all their cargoes are legal? This kind of setup? Too familiar. I know Elion spoke the truth. Thats how they work. Ironic, isnt it? Terra gets more protection from the Zhinuvian cartels than the rest of us. Makes you wonder if theres any point to the Caretakers dragging us here. His voice vibrated deep and low with pure hatred. I suppose up to that point I had wanted to disbelieve. The idea that trafficking could take place right under the nose of the Cygnian government, that we were no more immune from oppression than any other planetit shook me. I had been holding on to the possibility that Elion had exaggerated, misunderstood, hallucinated, lied, but now I had to consider it as truth. I saw Lians calmly sympathetic face and realized that this was not newsat least not the bit about Ferguss past. I looked at Joral, and he was visibly appalled, considering not only who was selling the slaves but who was buying. Continue to follow your orders, I mumbled. I have to speak to the Commissioner. Ferguss anger radiated from his glare and from the tension of his stance, scalding me even at a distance. I stumbled, set my shields stronger, and left the shuttle in a daze. Wait! Joral called. I slowed my pace so he could catch up, but I did not stop and I did not look at him. What do I say to the Councillor? he panted. You tell him everything. Everything. I stopped for a moment, hung my head, and admitted, Im sorry we didnt do our research more thoroughly before coming here. Weve been wasting your time. Delarua! It was the first time without chemical influence that he had ever addressed me by name and without title, so I paid attention and looked into his eyes. You cannot blame yourself for this. We want to search out any and every aspect of our culture that has survived. We have learned much, both optimal strategies and pitfalls, concerning the future preservation and development of our society. We are grateful. Truly. Joral was so endearingly earnest that, not for the first time, I had the urge to hug him. I restrained myself and settled for a half smile and a pat on the arm. Then we hastened on our way to brief our superiors. I suspect his conversation might have been a lot more straightforward than mine, though difficult in its own way. Qeturah listened to what I had to say, and then she got that expression on her face, the same one I had given Fergus: the one that was weighing the pros and cons of action and trying to work out not simply what was right but what was possible. She went to the window, looked out for a moment, and then began to pace the room slowly. You know, she said sternly, throwing me a frown over her shoulder, unauthorized acquisition and testing of genetic material is a chargeable offense. I knew it. I had known it when I did it. I said nothing. And besides one mans word, you have no actual proof. The results of the analysis I began, my hands open and pleading. only prove that they have an ugly class system based on phenotype, she cut in, stopping for a moment to face me before resuming her slow, troubled pacing. Some Cygnian societies do. It may not make them desirable, but it doesnt make them criminal. Qeturah, I tried, coaxing slightly, I think this one crosses the line. Unless we can prove human trafficking, the most we can do is submit a report and let Central Government determine in due course whether an inquiry is needed, she said sensibly, correctly, and disappointingly. Qeturah Grace! Look at this place. They dont call it invincible for nothing. She sank back into a chair as if exhausted in both mind and body, all considered paths leading to a dead end. My heart sank. I had been holding back one last card, something that could destroy the ruling class of Kirtahsg. Now I had no choice but to play it. I have proof of something that is criminal, I said softly. She stiffened. Why didnt you say? Oh. Its based on the material you obtained illegally. Well, thatll be a lot of help. Such proof is admissible once the crime is sufficiently severe and the officer who obtained the proof is suitably reprimanded. After all, you werent planning on letting my lapse in procedure slide, were you? Qeturah sat up. I think the look on my face was beginning to worry her. It certainly worried me, because my facial muscles had no memory of that particular expression. It was anger, contempt, and grim resignation of the kind that proclaims Those who are about to die salute thee. Analysis proves that the Master of Kirtahsg is the genitor of over ten percent of the domestics of his household, I said coldly. The Heir, who is yet young, has only managed to contribute two offspring to the general roll of servants. I cannot give you precise numbers. Some of the kinship lines werecomplicated. Qeturah blinked and turned her face away. You would have had to run analyses on individual identified data to get that information, she said quietly. As civil servants and scientists we are only allowed to give aggregated results on genetic data unless there is a specific medical cause. This is a direct violation not only of our mission protocols but of the General Code and the Science Code. Again I chose to say nothing. I was too angry and miserable to speak. Of course, any genitor who refuses to acknowledge and provide for offspring at the appropriate social and economic level is guilty of an indictable offense. And if sexual coercion is also a factor She trailed off, rubbing her temples. I have noticed that the Child Protection Division tends to move with greater speed and efficiency than the Department of Internal Affairs, I said derisively. Since we cant make the accusation of slavery stick, do you think this charge might do? She regarded me sadly, overlooking my misdirected bitterness. It must. Youre ending your career for it. Well, I said. I can live with that. I almost hiccuped over the lie. She continued to gaze at me steadily. I looked back without wavering. After a few seconds of this, she gave up and tossed me a handheld. Ill be needing a full report and confession. I caught it, sat down, pulled out a stylus, and began. Our courteous but cold farewells on the morrow gave no indication of what was to come. In fact, it wasnt until our mission debriefing in a quayside inn back at the mainland port that some members of the team realized the full scope of what had occurred and what was going to be done about it. Even Fergus looked a bit startled when Qeturah said that I was relieved of my appointed post forthwith. Lian, who knew everything, looked angry. Joral seemed confused and started to whisper something to Dllenahkh, who merely nodded and spoke a few words that appeared to satisfy him. The two Science Council officers looked grave, but Nasiha caught my eye and gave me a small nod. I kept my shields up and my expression blank. I must have looked more Sadiri than the Sadiri. Of course, the moment Qeturah dismissed us, I immediately left the inns meeting room and walked out into a dim twilight of sea mist. I was too angry to cry, so I started to run, my boots pounding the flagstones of the quayside. I ran past the end of the harbor, reaching a small bay with moored pleasure craft dimly visible offshore. Flinging stones from the pebbled beach into the water helped relieve my feelings, but then I accidentally struck a boat in the growing darkness and a startled shout made me realize that this was no time to act like a delinquent adolescent. I slunk back to our lodgings at the inn, feeling more surly than ever and hoping to slip in quietly, but that was impossible. Dllenahkh was seated outside in the inclement, unwelcoming murk, a cup and a steaming pot of tea on the table beside him, a similarly steaming cup in his hand, and the light from a lantern above making the scene all golden and dreamy, like a Turner painting. I stared. He glanced at me, then set down his cup to pour tea into the other cup. I sat down before it, picked it up, and sipped in silence for a while. He offered no conversation, merely sat peacefully in the lantern light and let the steam from his tea wreathe around his face as he drank leisurely. Ever wonder if youve done the right thing? I asked him finally. Frequently, he replied. Legalities notwithstanding, to not wonder indicates a dangerous lack of awareness of the nearly infinite array of choices presented by life. More tea? I held out my cup in mute assent. His fingertips brushed mine as he took it from me, and I felt a wave ofsomething. Approval? Affection, perhaps? I looked at him, startled, and he held my gaze for a second before focusing on pouring. I spoke simply to have something to say. Ive just torpedoed my career, and all you can do is offer me more tea? Yes, he replied, handing me back my cup. It appears to be having a calming effect. I smiled in spite of myself. Thank you, Dllenahkh, but yknow, I think thats you, not the tea. A faint smile curved his lips as he looked at me. For a moment, I sawI dont know how to explain it, but I saw just a mannot an offworlder, not a foreigner, nor even a colleague and a friend but just a man, relaxed, smiling, glad to be in my company. I felt an odd, fragmenting sensation of suddenly perceiving something differently and having the whole world change as a result. My smile faltered, my breath caught, and I lowered my eyes briefly before glancing back up again, unsure of what I had seen. He was still gazing at me, his face now inscrutable, but his eyes were not distant. They were curious, as if he too were questioning something he had just glimpsed. Drink, he said softly. Do not let your tea get cold.          UNFINISHED BUSINESS Enter, I said dully. Nasiha came into my room. You are late for your meditation practice. I was sitting on my bed in my underwear, surrounded by clothesCivil Service formal blacks, Forestry greens, various bits and pieces that were no longer relevant to my life. I cant find anything to wear, I said. She looked at the heap, then met my eyes. I may have something that will fit you. I too am having difficulties with my wardrobe. Today we will go shopping. I came down to breakfast dressed in my own trousers and undershirt and a Sadiri tunic borrowed from Nasiha. I assembled a plate of food and poured a mug of hot chocolate, but before I had to brace myself to face the table where Qeturah, Fergus, and Lian were seated, Dllenahkh murmured at my shoulder, It is a warm, bright morning. We should sit outside. I followed him, ducking my face into my mug for a sip as we passed my former colleagues. Outside was glorious, already starting to be scorching hot but with a fresh wind off the sea that eased the humidity. We took a table next to Nasiha and Tarik and were soon joined by Joral. I ate and drank, absently aware of the conversation in Sadiri but not really paying attention to what was being said. Are you Sadiri? Really Sadiri? The slightly hushed query came from a little boy about seven years old standing on the pavement in front of us. He had straight dark-brown hair that spiked up messily, and the tips gleamed in the morning sun. Ive seen you on the holos. They all stopped talking and focused on the boy, their faces softening to near smiles. Yes, said Dllenahkh, leaning toward him slightly. We are really Sadiri. Are you Sadiri too? The boy grinned and shook his head vigorously, clearly pleased to have been asked. He looked ready to say more, but a girl walking about ten meters farther ahead shouted back at him, her expression that of an exasperated older sister. Hurry up or well be late! The boy dipped a quick bow, more of a nod, which the Sadiri gravely returned, then ran off to join the girl. Dllenahkhs gaze was reminiscent, perhaps even wistful, as he watched him go. Do you have any children, Dllenahkh? I asked curiously. The moment the words were out, I froze in openmouthed horror, too appalled at myself to even begin an apology. Although it was true that he might have grown children off-planet, it was still an impossible question to ask any of the Sadiri, with so many families in the past tense. His expression was mild. There is no need to be distressed, Delarua. I never had any children. The opportunity did not arise. There was definitely a slight ruefulness in his voice. Nasiha must have caught it too, for she said firmly, You are still in your prime, Councillor. You should make it a priority after the end of the mission. Dllenahkh gave her a look that reminded me partly of Lanuris bemused irritation at being handled and partly of my own response to Jorals comment that I was too old. I smirked, recalling Qeturahs revelation that Nasiha had been taking an interest in my reproductive capabilities. Sadiri pregnancy hormones must be fierce. Thank you for your advice, Commander, but you must remember that I have recently been involved in helping to mitigate the consequences of overhasty attempts to pair bond by the young Sadiri of the settlement. To do something similar would set a very poor example. I would rather see many children in one stable Sadiri household than several ill-chosen unions producing one child apiece. To that end I congratulate you for your start Here he graciously inclined his head. and wish you many more offspring in the future. It was smoothly done and all the more so for being sincere. Nasiha lookedtheres no other way to describe itmisty. Tariks face held the admiring expression of a man who is taking detailed mental notes for future reference. I hid a smile, wondering to myself how Dllenahkh had learned to stroke the female ego so well. Of course, Nasiha in a good mood meant she was in fine form when it came to shopping. She immediately discovered the ports best bazaar, uploaded a map of the layout to her handheld, and began to list aloud her goals for the expedition. I rubbed my head and tried to find the right words. Ah, Nasiha, I cant exactly splurge. I have only one months severance pay, and I shouldnt touch my savings until I get another joband an apartment too, seeing as how mines sublet for a few more months. Do not concern yourself. I have in mind only a few simple garments such as would be suitable for both professional and everyday wear. I surrendered and let Nasiha go into mother mode. She draped me in a long off-white wrap that trailed over the shoulder and picked out a weeks worth of undershirts in basic colors. She matched two split skirts, one long skirt, and two pairs of trousers with Sadiri-style tunics and selected two long dresses, either of which could pass at formal affairs with the right accessories. After all, she said without a blink, the dress you were given at the opera house event may not be appropriate for all venues. I was changing in and out of several outfits, all the while frantically calculating credits in my head, but by the time I approached the vendor, he shrugged and said, The ladys already put it on her bill. I went over to where Nasiha was frowning disdainfully at a large, shapeless dress with a lace-up front. Nasiha! You cant pay for all this! Her expression became artfully puzzled. It is more efficient to charge all the items to one account, especially since I have been granted a maternity allowance specifically for the purpose of obtaining new clothing. No doubt we can settle the matter between ourselves at a later date. I understand it is a Cygnian tradition to buy educational gifts for ones godchildren? I was stymied, and it showed in my face, because her eyes got that very Sadiri look of smug satisfaction as she said, Now. Accessories. By this time I was starting to feel as if she were in truth using me as practice for any daughter she might have. She found a clasp for my wrap, which was sensible; selected two belts, which was practical; and then she was musing over decorative hair combs, which was frankly unnecessary. Look at me, Nasiha! My hair is this short! I expostulated, showing her my finger and thumb one centimeter apart. She looked me over. Yes. I think you should let it grow longer. She bought the combs. I realized she couldnt be stopped, so I tried diversion instead, pointing out wraps and tunics and dresses for her own wardrobe. While she was in a changing room, I slipped away and bought something quickly, putting it aside till the right moment. Still, I tried reason. You say we can settle this at a later date, but I dont know when next I will see you. Wont you be returning to New Sadira after this mission? She looked into the distance, her gaze reflective. I do not know. I didnt know what to say to that. She glanced at me, then returned to looking over the fabric of the dress she was considering. The Councillor has invited us to stay on Cygnus Beta. He believes that Tarik and I would help to promote the right image of Sadiri family life. Well, you would, I said sincerely. They really do need more women there, and I dont just mean prospective brides. Women who can be sisters, aunts, grandmothers. Theyre half a people as they are. You and the Councillor are much of the same mind. He has asked for female elders to come to the Cygnus Beta homesteadings. Good for him. Very good. I smiled with deep satisfaction. It was nice to know that Dllenahkh hadnt pinned all his hopes on the bride-search mission. She chose a dress, put it into my arms with the others I was holding for her, and started to examine another garment. You have a particular regard for the Councillor. I laughed at her casual manner. Oh, no you dont. Whatever you may have thought, whatever speculations you and Tarik may have indulged in, we dont have that kind of relationship. Again that quick glance. But you could. You are already quite attached to each other, in more ways than one. I felt a twitch of warning and moved my tongue away from my teeth just in case she came too close to matters I couldnt discuss. You heard what he told you, I hedged. He has to set a good example to the younger Sadiri. He cant marry just anybodyand certainly not a disgraced ex-civil servant. I only mention it becausewho knows when next you will see each other? I stood still, half hidden by the clothing piled up in my arms and glad for it. That hurt. That actually hurt. Id accepted that my career was over and Id have to leave the mission to find other work, but I hadnt paid attention to the fact that Id never work with Dllenahkh again. Delarua? Ill miss him, I admitted, my words somewhat muffled. But thats no reason for a shotgun wedding. Nasiha, Im surprised at you. Are you I couldnt say hormonal. Is this because youre I couldnt say pregnant either. Why exactly are you bringing this up? She took the pile of clothes from me and looked at me as if I were stupid. It is obvious that he regards you highly as well. I was under the impression that Cygnians are accustomed to arranged marriages. I followed her to the vendor. Within reason, Nasiha, within reason. Is he not physically pleasing to you, perhaps? I pictured myself clapping my hands to my ears and humming loudly, then banished the image and tried to act like an adult. I dont find the Councillor objectionable in any form or fashion, Nasiha, but really. Now, if you were to find some other waylike maybe I could work for him on the homesteadings as an independent consultant or something. That would be fantastic. It was the perfect red herring. She dumped the clothes down for scanning and turned to me with sudden, swift energy. You would like that, wouldnt you? Of course! I exclaimed. That way everyone benefits, no hasty decisions are made, and we pretty much continue on as before. Her eyes narrowed slightly as she considered me. I believe you, not least because you have managed to discuss the subject of marriage without once resorting to a fight-or-flight defense. Well, I can thank you for that, I said heartily. Oh, and by the way I fumbled in my pocket and brought out what I had purchased for her on the sly: a beautifully wrought cat clasp for her wrap. I thought this might be an appropriate I shook my head and tried again. Its practical, but its also a reminderOh, screw it. Im not SadiriI dont have to deliver a formal speech just to say I like you. Here. With those eloquent words, I pinned it to her wrap. She touched it gently with her fingertips. Thank you, she said quietly. I will treasure it. Getting new clothes was cathartic. I gathered up all the gear I had been assigned, put it into my field backpack, and brought it to my meeting with Qeturah the next day. When she saw it, she looked startled, then hurt. I really didnt see why. She rallied, however, and soon we were deep in discussion about how and when to transfer my mission files and reports to Lian, poor Lian, who was going to have a time and a half fitting in all the work I had been doing. I supposed Fergus would have to be the sole security resource to ease Lians burden. They could have hired someone new, but with the mission already more than half over, I guessed it wasnt feasible. Right, I said, cheerfully. So Ill be sure Lian gets everything within ten days, some partial and some completed as weve agreed on here. Thank you, Dr. Daniyel. Its been an honor to work with you. I rose and held out my hand. She shook it, looking confused. Ill be seeing you at dinner, wont I? Perhaps. I planned to turn in early, given my shuttles departure time tomorrow morning. Youre leaving? She seemed stunned. Iahthought that was the whole point of the exercise? I said not at all sarcastically. I was getting confused too. I thought you would travel with us until we reach the next major city, probably Chukai, about two weeks from now, after our next scheduled stop. I frowned slightly. I assure you, I will get all the documents sent to Lian within the specified time. Thats not She trailed off, sighed, and rubbed her forehead. Very well. I wish you all the best, Delarua. And the same to you and the team, maam, I replied. News travels very fast. Lian was the first to corner me after the meeting. Youre leaving tomorrow? There was a definite note of accusation there. Lian, you guys are leaving tomorrow too. I dont work for the government anymore, remember? I thought youd be around for a while, show me some lab procedures, that kind of thing, Lian said almost plaintively. I sighed. Apparently I wasnt the only one for whom things were just now sinking in. Lian, trust me; for your protection and mine, we shouldnt work in a lab together. You could appeal, Lian insisted. No, no. I think my confession made it a pretty airtight case. Besides, appeals take forever, and Id rather get on with my life. Im sorry. Im sorry too, Lian said, and then, unexpectedly, hugged me hard. (Yes, I know, and no, Im not telling! If you want to know so badly, you can go ask Lian yourself!) Fergus is sorry, Lian said, stepping back. I chuckled. No hes not. Lian smiled wanly. Well, youre right. But he should be. You saved his ass from a useless last stand. Hes never liked me. Im too frivolous for him, I said, speaking with just enough lightness to make it clear that this did not bother me. Hes jealous, Lian said, blunt and unashamed of it. He says Ive gone all girly and giggly since I started hanging out with you. You dont giggle, I said indignantly. You laugh mockingly. I should know; Ive often borne the brunt of it. We laughed briefly at that. It helped. Still smiling ruefully, I said, He thinks Im a small-minded bureaucrat, and Dr. Daniyel thinks Im a loose cannon. I went too far, or I didnt go far enough. Im beginning to think Im just an idiot. What do the Sadiri think? Lian asked with typical shrewdness. I puzzled for a moment, then smiled more broadly. Id hazard a guess that they think my actions were completely unethical yet highly appropriate. Saying good-bye to the Sadiri was hard because I had to be stoic about it. Nasiha had all my details, and I knew I would see her and Tarik again, and perhaps a godchild as well. As for Joral and Dllenahkh, were there any professional reasons for us to associate again? I wasnt sure. I spoke my farewells to them in the late afternoon. They unbent enough to shake hands, and Joral even looked a bit concerned. But Dllenahkh was quite cool and unfazed, and for some reason that upset me. I made some excuse about packing and turned to go to my room. Delarua, if I could have a word? I turned back. To be perfectly honest, it wasnt only saying good-bye that made me feel odd around Dllenahkh now. There was a little voice in my head saying breezily, I dont find the Councillor objectionable in any form or fashion, accompanied by the same comic image of myself tra-la-laing with my hands clamped to my ears. I have some matters to discuss with you. I would be grateful if you would consider having dinner with me this evening. I understand there is a restaurant not far from here which specializes in Ntshune cuisine. Sure, I said with a casual shrug, ignoring the little tripping sensation in my chest. Just to be certain, I put my mental shields higher. The moment we were actually seated in the restaurant, it all clicked back to normal. He wanted my opinion on his idea of bringing female elders to Cygnus Beta, and it was such an interesting concept that I forgot to feel awkward. I talked about the importance of grandparenting for family groups, the stability that Sadiri societies seemed to find in the matriarchal model, and the need to mimic as far as possible the societal structure of New Sadira so as to encourage a parallel cultural experience for the Sadiri of Cygnus Beta. He listened closely, absently plying his utensils as he ate, and at one stage he grew so absorbed that he sat back, put his hand to his mouth, and gazed at me intently. I believe I had just suggested implementing short-term apprenticeships for young Sadiri in the Interplanetary Science Council, the Galactic Foreign Service, and the Galactic Judiciary to cycle new parents out of active service for a long enough leave to spend the formative years with their offspring before optingor notto return to duty. You told me once that there are so few of you left that you must all consider each other as family, I said almost breathlessly. Well, this is the proof of it. I understand if the other Sadiri cant find you wives, but surely they can spare you family. He nodded long and slow in a way that seemed an agreement to more than my last words. I remember some months ago, you warned me that the Sadiri must beware of a misplaced sense of superiority. I have thought long and hard about this, and I have come to the conclusion that while superiority may be our most obvious flaw, it is not the most dangerous one. He pushed aside his plate, leaned his elbows on the table, and regarded me earnestly. I believe that our main flaw, and one I acknowledge in myself, is not that we consider ourselves superior but invincible. This makes it difficult to ask for help, even from our own. He dropped his gaze and began to fiddle with the table linen, a departure from his usual self-control that was both touching and worrying. We were sent off to Cygnus Beta, told it was for the good of all Sadiri. What could we do? We went bravely, convinced of our ability to withstand any trialno, determined to do so. Failure was unthinkable. He stilled his hands and exhaled deeply. I can only begin with myself, to set the example. I have a proposal for you. Here he raised his hand and smiled slightly. Not, let me hasten to add, of the kind that would please Commander Nasiha but one that I believe will not disappoint nonetheless. On several occasions you have proved your insightfulness concerning Sadiri society. Would you be willing to continue working for us on this mission? My heart leaped up, but only for a moment. Id had time to ponder my offhand comment to Nasiha, and I saw the difficulties. Id say yes in an instant, Dllenahkh, but its not that simple. What Ive done, theft of genetic materialIm barred from working in Central Government and local government. I might be able to work on the homesteadings in a private capacity, but this is a government mission. I cant accept. And there it was, that little smugness. We are aware of this. However, the Sadiri settlement on Cygnus Beta is in a unique position. While we are, of course, subject to Central Government in terms of the administration of the homesteadings, we have been granted a unique autonomy which leaves ultimate responsibility for the homesteaders with the Government of New Sadira. We selected you for this mission. We can rehire you. My jaw dropped. It was too good to be true. He saw it and tried to inject some caution. I do not have the final word. You must be interviewed and assessed before a decision can be made. I thought, if you did not object, that we might take the morning shuttle to Karaganda, a town with excellent teleconferencing facilities. The interview would take place in the early afternoon, and we would have our answer by the end of the day. Thenyes! By all means, yes! I stammered.  Goodness knows how I slept. I was a wreck, wavering between sweet dreams and grim nightmares about the possible outcomes. Dllenahkh and I rose early, and to my great pleasure and mild surprise, we meditated together with Nasiha, Tarik, and Joral before our departure for the shuttle station. The journey to Karaganda was made shorter by a much-needed nap, and then it was time for a brief stop at a hotel to have a light lunch, freshen up, and change before the interview. Dllenahkh did not fuss when he came to my door to find me still scrambling to arrange my attire just so. He gravely advised me, eased my worries about the state of my hair, and even helped me arrange the wrap around my head and shoulders and clasp it into place. An unusual piece, he remarked. I realized that his hand had paused on the clasp, which was in the shape of a hummingbird. Nasiha chose it for me. Most apt. Nasiha has excellent taste, I agreed. I took one last look at myself in the mirror, standing calm and straight as any Sadiri. Then I wrung my hands semitheatrically and shook them out from the wrists. Look at me. I wasnt even this nervous for my first interview for a government post. Dllenahkh turned me around and took my hands. His grip was gentle, very warm, and purposely reassuring. He held me immobile with only a look, waiting until he saw my frown vanish, my shoulders relax, and my lips tentatively smile. I have the highest regard for you, Grace. I am sure that I have not erred in my assessment of your character. Thank you, Dllenahkh, I whispered.  The teleconferencing center was state of the artit had to be to give such clear reception from Karaganda to Tlaxce City. It meant I had to remind myself not to jiggle my feet or pick at my nails in the mistaken belief that I was not completely in view. I stood alone at the head of the conference table and waited for the holo of my interviewer to appear. When it did, I saw that he had already seated himself, and he indicated with a nod and a gracious wave that I should do the same. I sat as gracefully as I knew how and waited patiently for him to speak first, as befitted an elder. For he was old, aged by years and more, with a timeless sorrow in his eyes that spoke of a galaxys worth of loss rather than a mere planets. He reminded me of the monks of the forest uplands, for he kept his hands tucked into the long, wide sleeves of his tunic and his head was clean-shaven. He did not smile or frown, but there was an unusual relaxation to his face that made me wonder whether Sadiri dignity became tempered after long years of wear. Grace Delarua, he said, speaking my name not in greeting but musingly to himself. Tell me about yourself. I once worked for Central Government, sir, I said. Im a biotechnician by training, but recently Ive been doing a lot of liaison work with the Sadiri. Thats how I ended up on the mission, helping the Sadiri as they research different Cygnian societies to see if anything of Sadira has survived. But I think you already know this, sir. Yes, he said, drawing out the single syllable slowly. That was the icebreaker, if you will. Tell me, Grace Delarua, do you like working with the Sadiri? A Sadiri elder talking about icebreakers? I was so baffled at this effort to put me at ease that it almost had the opposite effect, but I went on bravely. Yes, sir. Theyre efficient, no-nonsense types and easy to work with because of it. Soyou dont simply feel sorry for them? Sorry for themoh! It had actually taken me a split second to realize he was referring to the disaster. Well, Im sure we all want to help as much as possible, sir, but I dont think thats my main motivation. Id work with them even if Sadira hadnt been destroyedbut then of course theyd hardly have any reason to put up with me. His lips twitched, but where Dllenahkhs would have quickly returned to a disciplined line, his retained a slight upward curl of humor, then leisurely came back to the default professional position. About your actions on Kirtahsg, how would you assess them now? The words were delivered with perfect neutrality, but the atmosphere grew tense. I realized that this was, in a way, the question I had been brought there to answer. There was no other option but honesty. A friend once told me that feeling invincible leads to the mistake of not asking for help. It seems to me Ive made that mistake more than once, and I may have done it again. I understand the Commissioners disappointment that I didnt have faith in her ability to take care of the matter in the usual way. I could have asked for help, or advice, at an earlier stage when things were still salvageable. I didnt. I acted as if I was the only one who could get the job done. That was, in hindsight, a mistake. The grave nod of acknowledgment gave nothing away; it was as perfectly neutral as the question had been. But, I said slowly. An eyebrow quirked silently, inviting me to continue. But Im mostly Terran, which means sometimes I dont do whats sensible and methodical or even appropriate. Sometimes I listen to my intuition. Im sorry, sir, but thats who I am, and at the end of the day all I can do is take responsibility for the consequences. I miss a lot of cues by holovid, something about unconsciously relying on empathy when in proximity to others, but I couldnt miss the warmth in his eyes. Thank you, Grace Delarua. That will be all. Would you please ask Councillor Dllenahkh to join me for a moment? I stood and bowed, then went out in a daze to deliver the message to Dllenahkh. He was in there for much longer than I had been. When he emerged, he looked extremely pensive and not a little disquieted. What took you so long? I demanded anxiously. Did he change his mind? No, no, Dllenahkh assured me hastily. We did not discuss you at all. The Consul isan old friend. We were talking about other matters. I eyed him closely. AhDllenahkh, I cant help but notice you look a bitunnerved. Are you sure everything is all right? He nodded firmly, though his eyes were distant and his mind clearly elsewhere. Yes. Everything is perfectly fine. That kind of certainty sounded very familiar. I had often employed it myself. Do you want to talk about it? I dont think he began, then trailed off and finally looked at me properly. I will if I can. Someday, but not now. Fair enough, I agreed. It helped that he looked more startled than upset, as if whatever news he had heard was surprising rather than distressing. Now, I continued, changing the subject, how are we going to distract ourselves till evening? It turned out that Karaganda also had excellent museums and art galleries. We wasted a pleasant two hours before Dllenahkhs comm went off just as we were in search of a caf. He paused on the pavement, gave me a quick glance, and opened it to answer. His responses were terse and not at all illuminating, but something in the way his spine lengthened and his head went up, something in his slow intake of breath and the expansion of his chestit all added up to a positive result. Im in? I asked lightly as he closed the comm. They have consulted with Central Government and with the Commissioner, and although you are barred from conducting any scientific research whatsoeveryes, youre in. You have been assigned as my cultural attach for the duration of the mission. After thatwe shall see. I ducked my head down and laughed a low, long laugh of sheer relief. So here I am, back where I started, working with you again. Would you like to tell Nasiha, or shall I? he asked in a whimsical voice, as giddy as a Sadiri could get. If you choose your words carefully, you might get her to start planning our wedding ceremony or perhaps even arranging for our childrens betrothals. Nasiha does scare me sometimes, I said wryly, then laughed out loud again, unable to help myself. It was okay. I didnt have to leave. I didnt have to tell him good-bye. What he did next was almost, but not quite, a rolling of the eyes. It was more of a flash upward to heaven in a give-me-strength kind of way followed by a sigh and a rueful smile. She is very eager to see the new generation of Sadiri. Im sure he felt the euphoria of the moment, same as I did, but out in public, on a street with people walking by, it was easier to express it with quiet laughter and gentle quips at our colleagues expense. Displacement behavior, Qeturah would have called it, and Nasiha would have agreed, but I could hardly throw my arms around him and kiss him. That would have been even worse than hugging Joral. And yetthe day was shading into twilight, we were on a tree-lined avenue below a street lamp that had just flickered on, and for an instant I felt as if I were in a holovid at the point where the Ella Fitzgerald music starts to swell. I stepped up to him, hovered on the edge of his personal space, then came closer. He eyed me warily but did not move, held, I think, by a curiosity stronger than any decorum. I stretched up on tiptoe, careful not to touch any part of him, half closed my eyes, and deeply inhaled the scent of him at the join of his neck and jaw. Then I stepped back and smiled sweetly. His eyes followed me, still wary but also alight with a sort of intrigued amazement. If I may ask, why did you do that? I feltlet me confess ita little feminine thrill at the deepened tone of his voice. Just checking, Councillor, I said smugly. I wanted to confirm that I was correct in telling Nasiha that I do not find you objectionable in any form or fashion. Zero hour plus one year seven months fifteen days Lian rarely spoke to him, perhaps in part to avoid Joral, perhaps still conscious of that time he had needed the persuasion of a pistol to follow instructions, but Dllenahkh was not offended. Lian was perfectly professional and mostly kept to the Commissioners side, with Delarua and Fergus being the only social exceptions. (He did wonder once if Lians distant attitude might stem from a mild bias against Sadiri, but he quickly rejected the unwanted thought.) A few days after the upheaval in the teams roles and allegiances, he went into his shelter to find Joral staring in fascination at a plainly wrapped box on his small desk. What is it, Joral? he inquired. Corporal Lian brought it for you, Joral said, still staring at it. Dllenahkh frowned in puzzlement, shifted Joral gently to one side, and opened the box. Inside was a small card atop a quantity of springy padding. He read the card.  To Councillor Dllenahkhwith thanksLian  He cautiously parted the packing wool. Oh Joral began, and fell silent. How did Lian find this? Dllenahkh asked in amazement. It was a bottle of Sadiri spirits, only three years old, which was young for that particular brand but still incredibly precious as the last from a now-extinct distillery. Imay have mentioned something, Joral said. He sounded miserable. Dllenahkh looked at him in surprise, but in an instant it was terribly clearLian, talking to Joral, asking questions, showing interest for the first time, and it was only to get information out of him. He cleared his throat. A kind gesture, no doubt connected to our managing to retain Delarua as a colleague. We should He paused and rested a hand on Jorals shoulder to better transmit his concern, regret, and reassurance. We should have a little now and save the rest to drink at your wedding. Well drink at your wedding. The phrase was a common Sadiri jest said to young and old, married or not, as a roundabout way to wish them well. It sounded hollow and strange. Or yours, Councillor, Joral replied bravely. That seems more likely to happen. There was no bitterness, none, only mild teasing. Yours and mine, then, Dllenahkh said, playing along. After all, I must set a good example, mustnt I? Yes, Councillor, Joral agreed, sounding more like himself. Good. And tomorrowtomorrow we will both register with the Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance. Fetch the glasses and lets drink to that.          FALLING I yawned widely, raising my handheld to my face to hide my weakness from my Sadiri colleagues. The late nights were killing me. Id had some vague idea that since I was in effect an addition to the Sadiri team, I would have less work to do than Id had when I was with the government. After all, Joral was there, Nasiha was still going strong, Tarik remained as quietly diligent as ever, and Dllenahkh led from in front as always. Surely the work would not multiply in order to accommodate the number of persons available to do it. Yes. I know. Youd think Id never worked in the Civil Service. When Dllenahkh said he had the highest regard for me, it wasnt just a consoling compliment. It was myriads of reports and manuals downloaded to my handheld for background knowledge, attending all Sadiri-led meetings, writing my own contribution to the mission report being compiled for the Sadiri government, and speaking the Sadiri language on every possible occasion to strengthen understanding of the nuances of the vocabulary. Do you know that there are about ten variants of the Sadiri word for the right thing to do? Theres the thing thats right to do because its beneficial to all concerned. Theres the thing thats right to do because its been done that way for the last seven generations. Theres even the thing thats right to do because it will impress your superior. And they mostly get translated asyou guessed itappropriate. I think theres a particular inflection that means this may or may not be the right thing to do, but if I say that it is, you might shut up and get on with it. I knew I was in deep trouble the day Dllenahkh said to me, It would be appropriate if you completed the Advanced Grammar module by the end of next month, and he managed to combine two variants and that tricky little inflection with just three syllables, a rising tone, and an encouraging little smile. I have never worked so hard in my entire life. Of course there was no way I was going to let them down. Theyd taken a risk bringing me back onto the team in a nose-thumbing gesture to Central Governmentalthough, to be honest, it was less of a nose thumbing and more of a we are continuing to experience the traumatic aftereffects of the disaster and would welcome any concessions to maintaining stability and familiarity in our interactions. For a people who claim that deception is inappropriate, the Sadiri know how to spin a manipulative sentence or two, let me tell you. Failure would be an embarrassment not only to myself but also to the people who had bailed me out. No way was I going to let that happen, but there were never enough hours in the day. Qeturahs carefully suppressed pleasure at my return transformed into mild alarm, and finally, after nearly two solid months of watching me run myself into the ground, she pulled the doctor thing on me and took me aside. You look like hell, she said callously. Well, dont spare my feelings, I retorted. Instead of flattering me, why dont you do something helpful like writing a small prescription? She gave me a very long look, then handed over a packet of the small adhesive patches I remembered all too well from my university days. Im only giving you a weeks supply of these. Use them sparingly and do not come back for more. If you havent adjusted to your new duties without chemical aid by the time they run out, youll have to find another solution. Fair enough, I said. It made sense. I didnt want to build up a tolerance to them, and in truth I only needed a little extra time to bring myself up to speed. I used nearly all of them, but only at most dire need. I was almost in the clear, but thenthere was a visit coming up, and a rescheduling of another visit, and a possible insertion of a new visit on the schedule, and suddenly more work appeared to fill up the space that had been cleared on my handheld. Which led to the present scenario: me fighting sleep during an interminable late-night meeting. I fished the last patch discreetly out of my pocket and pressed it gently to my side, letting the warmth of my skin activate the adhesive. The kick was palpable but muted. Id be good for another two hours, nothing more. Better make it count. May I collate the pros and cons that have been laid out thus far? I volunteered. We might find a decision easier to arrive at with a visual representation of the matter. Two hours later, the meeting was wrapping up and I crashed. I dont mean it figuratively; I literally got up, stumbled, and fell over. I lay there on the ground, miraculously unhurt in any way, thought, How comfortable, and closed my eyes for just a second. I raised my head to find Joral and Dllenahkh looking at me expectantly. The visual representation, Delarua? Dllenahkh inquired. Oh, yes, I said, coming alert at last. But I cant do it without accompaniment, you know. Thats why Im here, said an amused voice. I turned my head to see the minstrel bard of the Seelie Court tuning up his cithara, quirking an eyebrow at me in a way that managed to be both cheeky and quite sexy at the same time. Excellent! I said happily. I was afraid you hadnt gotten the memo. Pshhh, he said dismissively as he slapped a miniamplifier onto the wooden frame of his instrument. Miss a sweet gig like this? Not likely! I sang the first few notes of the report so we could calibrate our output, then prepared to begin in earnest. Suddenly, I caught sight of Nasiha and Tarik walking a tightrope between a tree and our tbrenwalking away from us. Hey, guys, arent you going to stay to hear the report? I asked, feeling a bit hurt. Nasiha giggled. Watch your feet, Grace! I had been walking toward them as I spoke, but when she said that, I stopped short and looked down in a panic at my shoes. There was nothing underneath them but air, leaves, branches, and more air. AHHHHHHHHHHHH ! Thud. I jolted awake, thrashing wildly with the bedsheets. My hand brushed my side, snagging on the patch. I removed it and was about to throw it away when I dimly saw some strange markings on it. The light on my wrist comm illuminated it enough for me to view the words SEE ME in Qeturahs best medical scrawl. I groaned, tapped off my comm light, cast the spent patch aside, and walloped my pillow resentfully. A dream about a good-looking man should not end in sudden death and a sanctimonious note from your doctor. Add to that the embarrassment of having passed out cold in front of DllenahkhBut I was too tired to dwell on any of it. I curled up to fall asleep instantly. EEEEEEEE! You know its bad when youre falling to certain death and all you can think for your blessed last thought is Damn, have I got a girly scream. Thud. I collided not with the unforgiving ground but with a pair of strong arms and a broad chest, all connected to a form and face that I knew well. What the hell? Dllenahkh? I thought. My hero! I cooed as he swooped up into the open sky, carrying me safely. This is bad and wrong, I tried to say. Put me down, you idiot! I can fly for myself! No words came out to break the silence, but he did in fact slow down and land at the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean. There was an overpoweringly Technicolor sunset going on at the horizon line, and the air was heavy with the scent of sea spray. He gently set me down, gazing into my eyes with a savant-strength intensity that suggested that some heavy data analysis or problem solving was going on in that complicated brain. Gently again, he tilted up my chin with the knuckle of a curled forefinger, slowly closed his eyes, and brought his lips closer to mine. And the light went out. When I opened my eyes, it was to see the beautifully mundane poles of a camp shelter over my head and feel a government-issue cot under my back. I groaned. Fade to black? When did my erotic dreams ever fade to black? Come to think of it, when did my erotic dreams get so crappy and G-rated? One of the side effects of the stimulant patches was odd, trippy dreams, but that was plain weird. I didnt want to dwell on what my subconscious was doing, so I swung myself upright and decided to start the day. I woke myself some more by washing in cold water, then dressed and dragged myself outside. Lian was nearby, sitting beside a field stove, and there were good smells in the air. Qeturah said I should let you sleep in, so I kept breakfast warm for you. With a flourish, Lian uncovered a plate of pancakes. I eyed the scene distrustfully for a moment, waiting for Lian to break into song or the pancakes to flap away, but when all remained sane, I muttered, Bless you, in heartfelt relief and sat down with a rumbling stomach. How late is it, anyway? And where is everybody? I mumbled through mouthfuls of pancake and syrup. Wrapping up the visit to Piedra, Lian replied, waving a hand vaguely southward. Its about lunchtime now; the shuttle should return soon. That was quick! I said. I know it was just a courtesy thing, since we have so much data on them already, but I thought we were going to do an overnight, not a day trip. Lian gave me a puzzled look. We did. Did what? We did do an overnight. How? When? Without me? Take it easy. No one expects you to bounce back immediately from yesterdays ordeal. I frowned. What ordeal? Lian hit the wrist comm, whispered furiously into it for a few seconds, then faced me again with a smile that leaked panic at the edges. Would you like to go lie down again? Within twenty minutes, the shuttle had returned. It wasnt the worried looks that shook me, nor the raised brows; it was the speed with which Qeturah, Dllenahkh, Nasiha, and Tarik got me onto a medtable with sensors stuck all over my skull. Uh, guys, would you like to tell me whats wrong? What is the last thing you remember? asked Dllenahkh calmly as Qeturah circled the medtable adjusting things, Nasiha compared the readings on the monitor with the data displayed on her handheld, and Tarik scanned his handheld furiously, possibly looking up reference texts. We had that really late meeting about the feasibility of including the Traveling Clans in our schedule given their low genetic score but strong retention of Sadiri traditions. Uh, Ive been meaning to talk to you about that. You do know Cygnians need more sleep than Sadiri, right? Because I think Ive been running a little short, and as flattering as it is to be included in everything you discuss, perhaps I could just read the summaries afterward and add a note expressing my views. Nothing after that? asked Qeturah, gently waving some scanning device back and forth across my field of vision. Well, apart from some very vivid dreams and not-very-restful sleep, the next thing I recall is this mornings breakfast. Which, incidentally, I didnt get the chance to finish. May I finish my breakfast, please? I was beginning to feel irritated. They removed the sensors and guided me solicitously to a seat, which only made me angrier. Dllenahkh sat opposite me and said quietly, The meeting to which you are referring took place not last night but the night before. Ive lost a day? I said, disbelieving. Amnesia is one of the possible effects of the drugs you were given, said Nasiha. Given? By whom? I asked sharply. She glanced quickly at Qeturah, who in turn gave Dllenahkh a somber look. His mouth tensed, then his expression became neutral once more as he spoke to me. We would prefer to avoid telling you what happened yesterday so that we can be certain any memory that returns is of the event rather than of our account of it. Its possible the drugs are still interfering with your hippocampus, said Qeturah quickly by way of diversion. What? I asked, taking the bait. Thats the part of the brain involved in the formation of long-term memory, she clarified. Oh, yeah. Been a while since first-year neuroanatomy, I mused. I sat still for a moment. I checked myself over, twiddling my toes, flexing my fingers, running my tongue over my teeth. I didnt feel any pain or soreness. Whatever had happened to me, it hadnt been damaging in any way that I could sense. I relaxed just a little. Well, the fact that you havent medevacked me gives me some small comfort, I began. Funny you should mention that, said Qeturah ominously, because I was thinking about that option right this minute. Were on the edge of the desert. Wheres the nearest neurologist? Look, Im walking and talking, and I feel fine. Thats what you said yesterday, murmured Lian unhelpfully. Qeturah looked at Nasiha and Dllenahkh. Nasiha seemed unusually quiet to me, and Dllenahkh had a slight frown on his face. One day, Qeturah said to me, still looking at the two Sadiri as if asking for their permission. One more day, just in case all thats required is for the last of the drug to cycle out of your system. By then well be on our way to Mordecai, and they have decent medical facilities. That was satisfactory. I went back to my food. I spent the afternoon brooding over what had happened. It felt funny and not particularly nice to have this big gap in my life that everyone else seemed to know about but me. The concerned looks were beginning to wear on me. I pulled out a small, old-fashioned paper journal that Qeturah had given me back when she was still trying to have me get in touch with my feelings about the Ioan business and wrote down what I could remember of my strange dreams. Then I confronted Nasiha in the shelter she shared with Tarik. I think you were very much involved in what happened, I told her frankly. Ive never seen you so subdued. Can you tell me anything? She bowed her head slightly, just enough to avoid meeting my eyes. Until your own memory returns, I think I should not. I looked at her. She had been wearing civilian clothes more often than not after our shopping trip, complaining that the Science Council maternity uniform was neither comfortable nor flattering. Wheres the cat clasp? You always wear it. I no longer have it. Please, Delarua, do not ask any more questions. I am sorry. Tarik, who had been quietly working a few meters away, suddenly put his handheld down, stood up with a face like thunder, and strode outside.  I attended the Piedra debriefing, which is to say that I sat there and no one made me leave, but the conversation often seemed to weave around me as if I were merely an observer. As usual, I took notes for my own reports, but something made me take more thorough notes than usual: audio and vid recordings, several file attachments, and also little personal notes for anything I found strange or significant. For the first time ever, I had a strong desire to stay up late with the Sadiri. So, I asked Joral, what do you guys get up to when the rest of us are asleep? The Councillor and I are studying Cygnian culture, he said. Literature, art, film, history; it is very interesting. Last night we began a series on preholo cinema. Oooh, classics? Remastered, for the most part, Joral admitted. Remastered? I clutched at my heart with an agony that was only half feigned. Philistines. Might as well turn in, then, I said, and yawned for the fifth time in as many minutes. Just in case, I gave Lian the dream journal and pointed out which folders on my handheld contained my most recent notes. Then I went to bed, falling asleep far more quickly than I expected to. Of course this meant I was able to wake up early enough to see Dllenahkh off at the shuttleport, though why I should have gone out in all that damp, unhealthy fog is beyond me. To make matters worse, he was dressed oddly and talking nonsense. Ive got a job to do, too. Where Im going, you cant follow. What Ive got to do, you cant be any part of. Grace, Im no good at being noble, but But? I prompted, genuinely curious. That wasnt how it went, was it? He blinked and said in a more normal tone, Is there a purpose to my being noble in this situation? I am not convinced it is the best choice to make. The slight frown cleared from his face, he seemed to mentally shrug, and then he tilted up my chin with his forefinger. Heres looking at you, kid. He bent his head toward mine, and again, unsurprisingly, the scene immediately faded to black. Whats with that? I mumbled out loud. Delarua? Are you awake? I stretched, tangling my feet in the thin blanket over my cot. Yeah, more or less. Oh, shoot! I sat upright suddenly. Nasiha! Im sorry I overslept, but you saw what I was like last night at the meeting. No way was I going to make it to meditation this morning. She regarded me silently from her seat in a chair not far from my cot. She was already dressed for the day, of course, and there was a medical scanner in her hand, which she held poised as if about to sweep it in my direction. Which meeting would that be, Delarua? Dont you remember? The Traveling Clans issue? I replied, puzzled. I see, she said, tapping her comm. In a very short space of time, a small group had gathered around my cot: Nasiha, Dllenahkh, Qeturah, and Lian. I selfconsciously wrapped up in my blanket and gaped at them. Ive lost two days? I said incredulously. They did not argue. Nasiha showed me the date-stamped medical readouts. Lian accessed my report notes on my own handheld and gave me the beginnings of a dream journal in my own handwriting. I got up, trailing the blanket behind me like a badly wrapped toga, and paced around in undershirt and shorts, staring at the items in my hands and absorbing the information. Ive lost two days, I said faintly. I felt my way back to my cot and sat down, dumping everything beside me and numbly passing a hand over my face. Whats going on? Whats happening to me? We believe that something is disrupting your ability to form long-term memory, said Qeturah. Each time you go to sleep, your consciousness resets to the last event stored in long-term memory. This is probably caused by a malfunction of The hippocampus, yes, I know, I mused. But that doesnt explain why Im remembering all my dreams. Qeturah and Nasiha spoke at the same time. How do you know that? You remember your dreams from last night? I looked up, surprised at their intensity. Yes, I know about the hippocampus memory thing. Didnt you tell me about that sometime, Qeturah? And yes, I remember three dreams from last night, but two of them are described in that journal. Three dreams in one night is more than a little busy, so I think I must be remembering the night before. Subconscious memory formation. I thought so, said Qeturah triumphantly. I did tell you about the hippocampus yesterday, Grace. You said you did basic neuroanatomy, but youd forgotten about that. My mind was whirling. Give me a moment. Ill be able to think more clearly once Im properly dressed. I promise, Ill come straight to the lab right afterward. I didnt, though. As I collected my thoughts, a strange idea came to me. I had never seen Casablanca. Heard of it, of course, read many a quote, even, but seen itnever. That old black-and-white stuff was for the real movie buffs, and in spite of my teasing Joral, I wasnt one. I wandered to their shelter in search of information to test my hypothesis. Joral, I said, tell me, what movies did you watch last night and the night before? He raised a puzzled eyebrow. Last night we saw the earliest Cygnian adaptation of Casablanca. The night before that, we watched the 3-D remake of Superman, which is famous for its interactive special effects. If you would like to join us tonight, we are thinking of viewing the original E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. This wasnt a huge surprise. Cygnian cinema, both preholo and holo, is filled with benign aliens and refugees from war and disaster. Thank you, Joral. I smiled. Ill think about it. Dllenahkh, could I have a word with you outside? We walked a short distance from the camp to the edge of a small plateau and gazed down at a vast, barren landscape. I was reminded of the time wed huddled together, watching the savanna dogs in their den. Now we were looking at a rocky desert land, with the low towers of Piedra faintly visible in the haze of fine sand and heat. I was sorry Id missed seeing that famous city up close. So, youve been watching a lot of old movies. I glanced up at Dllenahkh. Tell meyou ever imagine me in them? Or ratherus? There was a profound silence. Dllenahkh turned to face me fully, the expression on his face somewhere between alarm and embarrassment. Why do you ask? Dont be coy. Superhero catches falling girl. Rick says good-bye to Ilsa. Thats what Ive been dreaming, and thats what you and Joral have been watching! He actually paled. That would suggest that I have been influencing your dreams. Worse. Im dreaming your thoughts! And while were on the subject, what is it with those strategic blackouts? You got something against kissing? Give the Sadiri credit; even in the midst of pure, unmitigated mortification, they never stop thinking. I have it, he said suddenly. I understand what is happening to you and how to correct it. Quick, let us go to the lab. I could try to tell you what the detailed explanation was, but why bother when you can access for yourself the paper coauthored by Qeturah, Nasiha, and Tarik. Suffice it to say that my brain chemistry had been altered by the drugs I had been given, with the result that my hippocampus was no longer storing long-term memory throughout the brain. It was all being stored exclusively in the hippocampal gyrus, which is the region of the brain responsible for telepathy. Coincidentally, this is also the region that I seem to be unable to access consciously, which is why I get a null result on telepathic ability. However, with the addition of another chemical from the stimulant patch, I had become a subconscious telepath. I was reading Dllenahkhs mind from a distance in my sleep. How cool is that? And were going to do what? I asked them after the detailed explanation had been repeated to me two or three times. The Councillor is going to attempt repairs when you enter REM sleep tonight, Nasiha said, her voice regaining some of its usual confident vigor. He will access the memories in your hippocampal gyrus and adjust your neurotransmitters to recommence storing memory in the usual way. I looked at Qeturah for confirmation, but she merely shook her head helplessly. Im all at sea with this telepathy business, Grace. Youre going to have to trust Dllenahkh. Well, thats a given, I said easily. It was a small thing, but the moment I said it, Tarik flashed a brief glare at Nasiha, then retreated once more behind a veneer of propriety.  Because there was only one medtable and limited space, they put an extra cot in the shuttle and dotted us all over with sensors to record the unusual event. Then they turned on the environment controls, turned off the lights, and shut the door. For a short while, there was the glow of Dllenahkhs handheld as he sat on the cot and made some last-minute notes. Finally he turned it off, and the darkness was absolute. I heard the cot creak slightly as he lay down. Are you going to stay awake all night? I said softly. If necessary, he replied just as quietly. I may snore, I warned after a pause. I shall try not to listen, he said with mild amusement. Is something wrong between Nasiha and Tarik? It might have seemed a nosy question, except that it came out in the plaintive tones of a child wondering why Mommy and Daddy are arguing. Tarik is struggling to find the right way to deal with a certain matter. Nasiha is concerned for him. They will be all right, Grace. There was a very long pause during which the silence rang loudly in my all-too-awake ears. You going to tell me about the kissing thing or not? He exhaled audibly. I suppose it was too much to hope that you would forget that. Kissing is not a Sadiri custom. To us it seemsunhygienic. And yet much of Terran romance appears to center around the practice, to the point where potential partners may even be rejected solely on the basis of a lack of proficiency in this area. Well, it is rather unhygienic, I admitted, but there are variations, you know, ranging from a kiss on the cheek to the full-on, bite-for-blood kiss. There are plenty of Terran cultures that dont find the extreme versions attractive. Where do you fall on this spectrum of preference? he asked. For a moment I had a kind of mental stumble that made me glad Dllenahkh hadnt linked to me yet: Hes asking me how I like my kisses! Then I pulled myself together. I suppose Im a bit tame by urban standards. I prefer a no-fluids approach myself, just minimal moisture at the most. I was very proud of my clinical tone. Umdoes your culture have an alternative to the kiss? I heard him sit up, felt him take my right hand. He gently uncurled my fingers and turned my palm toward him. I opened my mouth to say, Oh, yeah, that thing Nasiha and Tarik do. But the words died on my tongue. First he simply touched his fingertips to mine, which was pleasant enough. Then he lightly traced the length of my fingers, moving slowly, a low hum of sensation for the front of my hand, a warm tingle for the back. Finally, he set his palm to mine. Ohh! I exclaimed, enlightened and entranced. It felt like warm, golden lightnot the muted gold of late afternoon but something more sharply metallic, conducting its own electricity along the nerves in my hand directly to my brain and throughout my body. There was a ripple like lighthearted laughter, a more solemn surge like a deep contented sigh, and then a comforting ebb and flow like the rocking of an ocean wavevery soothingvery relaxingvery good of you to put me to bed, Councillor, I said, smothering my chagrin under a jesting tone. Memory returned to me, bright and sharp as life, but strange as dj vu in a hall of fractured mirrors. We sometimes forget that most Cygnians need at least eight hours of sleep, Dllenahkh said apologetically as he set down the last piece of baggage in the hotel lounge. In the future, we will try to arrange our meetings to take place at a more convenient hour and within a shorter time frame. Dont make promises you cant keep, Councillor, I said with a teasing grin. Then, much to my dismay, I saw Qeturah glancing in my direction as if considering whether or not to deal with me in public. I decided not to give her the chance. It was the work of a moment to slip out of the hotel with Nasiha on the pretext of a quick stop in town to take a look at a nearby craft market. I hadnt considered the extent to which clothes are protection. Ordinarily, Nasiha would have been wearing her Science Council blues and I would have been wearing one of my Civil Service uniforms, but we had both taken to wearing civilian clothes bought in that region. That must have been why they thought we were fair game. One moment we were walking down the road, and then we were gonedragged into an alley, choking rags drenched in some sedative pressed over our faces. Nasiha was too strong and too quick for them. I saw the man who grabbed her go flying over her head. At that point, I blacked out completely. When I came back to consciousness, it was in a paralyzed body. I could feel the vibration of an aircar under me, but I could neither open my eyes nor move. I heard shouts and the sound of running feet, and then I felt the sudden crush of a quick liftoff. I struggled and finally cracked open my eyes just as they picked me up by the wrists and ankles and swung me out of the open door of the rising car. The aircar hadnt risen very far, perhaps no more than five meters. If Id had the use of my limbs, I would have feared at most some contusions, a broken wrist perhaps. But I was limp and helpless, and I waited to feel all my bones break and my skull shatter on the hard ground. But thats not the way it went. I collided not with the unforgiving ground but with a pair of strong arms and a broad chest, all connected to a form and face that I knew well. You caught me, I murmured to the presence in my mind. Of course, he answered, but below the calm was the fear and wonder of having arrived in the nick of time. Nasiha? I saw an image of her, wrap torn away and face furious, spinning around helplessly in a now-empty alley as the gang got away through the close gaps between the buildings like rats scurrying into a maze. I saw an image of Tarik outside the hotel, face peaceful one moment, then wide-eyed with horror, sprinting away instinctively to find her via the telepathic link they shared. In three minutes, Lian and Dllenahkh drew up in a groundcar and hauled him in. Tarik found Nasiha all right, but it was Dllenahkh who found me, reaching out with all his strength to sense my half-conscious awareness, as faint as the whirr of a hummingbirds wings. I was unreasonably perky when the drugs wore off. Cant remember a thing! I said cheerfully. Look at meIm walking, Im talking, Im fine! Qeturah scanned me, scowling at her instruments as they confirmed my words. Very well. But youre not coming with us to Piedra. Youre on twenty-four hours rest and observation. I think Nasiha would have stayed with me if Tarik hadnt tried to order her to do so. In the end it was Lian who volunteered to watch over me. Poor Tarik, I said, thinking of his silent shows of anger and understanding at last how even a Sadiri, especially a Sadiri, could be almost incapacitated by fear for the well-being of his wife and unborn child. The fear felt like falling falling through darknessfalling forever because there was nothing to fall to. Deep space had no pull, no solidity. There was only hopeless spinning in the void and tumbling fear within. What life begins, death must end but so much death had its own gravity well, impossible to escape, an open grave that had drawn millions from existencefriends, strangers, enemies, loversturning everyday loss to utter loss. He was falling, so I caught him, grasping his wrist as the arc of his orbit passed me. I tugged him down to the ground and turned him right side up so he could see the huge silver moon rising over the horizon. I touched the tip of my forefinger to his, kindling a golden glow, and placed my hand gently over his heart as I whispered the timeless clich for all those who no longer had voices to tell him. The light from the opening shuttle door woke me. They came tiptoeing in. Shhhh, I signed one-handed, and pointed down at the cot. His hand loosely gripping mine, chest rising and falling slightly, Dllenahkh was asleep.          REMEMBRANCE DAY Something changed. It was bizarre. We had been side by side in the dark, hands touching, minds touching, and some of that intimacy lingered in speech and shared silence, but I still could not find a way to ask him directly about his nightmare. True, much of our time together was in a purely professional setting, but even so, I wasnt sure I had earned that right. I read voraciously instead, my desire to impress giving way to an insatiable curiosity about old Sadira, New Sadira, and the disaster in between. The hidden motive behind my new obsession was not professional but personal. During our close communication, I had seen myself through Dllenahkhs eyes. It had been disconcerting, even alien. I found myself wondering how the average Sadiri would view me, something Id hardly cared about when I was visiting the settlement. The standards for courtesy and professionalism could not be the same as the standards forfriendship. Kissing was a minor detail. Im no Gilda; I didnt want to experiment. I wanted to get things right, and I had no idea how to go about it. I stood before the mirror, paused and pondering, a stick of kohl held loosely in my fingers. Everything else was as usual. I was wearing a long black skirt and a belted white short-sleeved tunic. My wrap remained on the bed in my hotel room. I would go bareheaded tonight and see if I could get accustomed to the unruly, thumb-length fuzz that my hair had become after nearly four months without a trim. A band pulled it back smoothly from my forehead in an attempt at elegance. I looked fine. The concert hall wouldnt throw me out. A knock at the door startled me. Lian came into our shared bathroom and in two seconds took in my slightly guilty look and the stick of kohl, which I was sheepishly trying to make disappear behind my back. Dont worry, Lian said with a gentle, understanding smile. Some things are too important for teasing. You look sharp tonight, I said quickly, opting for diversion. Lian went to the mirror and ran a professional eye over each crease and fastening, each braid and ribbon, ensuring that everything was in place. Itll do. My colleagues from the Cygnian Military Service and the Interplanetary Science Council had been invited to a Remembrance Ceremony commemorating those who had died in the crisis events that had brought various peoples to Cygnus Beta. The entire team had attended a general service of remembrance earlier in the day, but this was something exclusive for the military and quasi-military bodies, perhaps a special reminder of their mandate to protect humanity. We were in town for only a couple of days en route to another visit, so I hadnt been surprised when Qeturah declared she was happy to stay in and rest and Joral said he had to catch up on some work. Dllenahkh, on the other hand, was interested in going to a local performance of Pakals Requiem and asked me if Id like to come along. I said yes. It wasnt an unusual invitation by any means, yet there I was, standing in the bathroom with a stick of kohl held indecisively in my fingers. Lian gave the shoulders of the dress uniform one final brush, looked at me, and nodded. Ill give you some privacy. When the door closed, I laughed a short, quiet laugh at myself and applied the kohl. Ganymede is a small town, but it prides itself on its history and culture. As a result, the concert hall was impressive and the orchestra magnificent, rivaling even the finest in Tlaxce City. I did not regret my efforts to look my best, and I was foolishly proud of Dllenahkh too. He could take the simplicity of a formal suit and make it as crisp and stylish as any military dress uniform. The small teak elephant I had given him rode discreetly on the collar of his shirt, adding to my satisfaction. Pakals Requiem is very moving but not particularly long, and that suited my mood perfectly that night. We spent a mere thirty minutes with the orchestra and the audience, then went out with the rest of the crowd to mill about in the brightly lit town park. We were both rather silent. It was that kind of evening. Everyone, couples and families alike, seemed a bit hushed and reflective as they walked, as if it were a planetwide holy day. Does Sadira have a Day of Remembrance? I asked Dllenahkh. I meant to say New Sadira, but he overlooked the slip and answered directly. Different tribes have had different ways and times for honoring their ancestors and fallen heroes. There is nothing as specific as this, although in time there may be. I stopped walking and looked up at him with a small frown. There hasnt yet been a ceremony for the loss of Sadira? Its been well over a year. He bowed his head slightly, matching my frown, as if genuinely puzzled that such a thing had not yet taken place. The day was remembered, but not as a formal event. I supposeI believe we have been too busy to think of such a thing. We walked on in silence for a while. Although, he continued in a low voice, to do so would have meant accepting that there could be no returning to Sadira in our lifetime, nor for many generations to come. I suspect we were not ready to admit that. My hand brushed his tentatively. His fingers curled around mine, briefly answering the touch, then withdrew. With a look and a nod, he indicated a bench a little off the path, half screened by high shrubbery. I followed him, and we sat down to watch the people walk by. I promised some time ago to tell you the story behind my meeting with the Consul when we were in Karaganda, he said. I stared at him, my attention caught. You did. That was a few months back. Are you ready to tell me now? He nodded. There is much you have learned from reading our government reports. It may be easier for me to explain now. I racked my brain, trying to think what could have been in the several extremely dry reports I had read that would have a bearing on our conversation now. I drew a blank, so I simply smiled invitingly and waited for him to begin. His opening sentence was unexpected. How did it feel when you were recovering from your injuries and I linked to your mind to speed your bodys healing? Dllenahkh would never ask an idle question. I paused and pondered over the memory of it. It felt like your blood was in my veins. It felt like your neural electricity was in my nerves and brain and spine. I wish I could be clearer. Your awareness was tangled up in mine. Am I making any sense? He was looking at me and smiling very gently, somewhere between the proud smile of a master whose student has answered correctly and the fond smile of a friend who finds himself perfectly understood. Go on. You are doing very well. I continued courageously with my wild guessing. I suppose, from what Nasiha tries to teach me and from what Ive read of the mindships, thats how the Sadiri mind works. You extend your awareness of yourself beyond the boundaries of your physical body. Its generally a benign psionic influencecase in point, when you took over the parts of my body that were not under my conscious control and helped me heal faster. Thats also how a mindship pilot operates. He or she becomes the shipno, waitnot quite. The ship becomes part of the pilot. The smile was my barometer, and it did not falter, though he gave one clarification. Simplified but not inaccurate. The Sadiri mind, as you say, works in this way. Remember, however, this is due to early training and constant practice. The Sadiri brain is still a human brain, only with more of its potential realized. He raised his hands and regarded the palms meditatively, tilting them to catch the warm light of the parks solar lanterns. Zhinuvians have a higher concentration of semiconducting material in their skin, which permits them to talk to machines with greater ease than to other sentient minds. Their way of navigating their interstellar craft reflects this difference in approach. We too possess some of this ability to interface with man-made intelligence, but our skill mainly lies with the organic, independent mind. I am aware, I said carefully, because I could not say that I understood, that your ships, unlike the Zhinuvian ships, are alive, not crafted. He lowered his hands and nodded. I enjoyed our brief time at the mahouts village. Their attachment to their elephants is very like how our pilots bond with their ships. It is a lifelong commitment. I have heard of only one instance of a pilot who gave up his ship willingly. That is the story I am about to share with you now. He relaxed and leaned back, gently putting aside a few untrimmed leafy twigs from the nearby bushes that tried to dangle about his head like a sparse laurel crown. I turned toward him, drawing my feet onto the seat and under my skirt. A talkative Dllenahkh was rare and most welcome. I would let him speak uninterrupted and ask my questions later. During my years of training and study in the mental disciplines, I encountered many people who became pilots. Most of them were off-planet when the disaster struck, and yet a significant number died in futile attempts to transport people from the surface of Sadira. One of the survivors came to Cygnus Beta to speak at a special meeting held by an emissary from New Sadira. The entire local Council of our settlement was in attendance to discuss and decide on a matter that would affect us alla plan to save Sadira. What I am about to tell you may sound as far-fetched as the tales of the Caretakers sound to some non-Cygnians, but I ask you to proceed for the moment as if both were equally true. A mindship can travel in space and time. For most interstellar journeys, a pilot plots a shortcut through the unseen dimensions of space-time in order to travel swiftly between distant points in the visible dimensions. It is also possible to plot a course that makes use of a second dimension of time, but it is a rare and still-experimental practice which is only done far from the usual shipping routes as our scientists continue to assess and document the effects. In short, we had the technology to send a pilot back to a time before the disaster. What could be achieved there was a matter of debate. Some felt that averting the disaster would only create a parallel time line in which Sadira remained alive but we would continue in this time line, unaware and unaffected. Others were convinced that the method by which Sadira was destroyed was so advanced that it must have come from the future, thus creating a parallel time line in which we are now living. They further believed that parallel time lines are not sustainable, and if we were to stop the disaster from happening, this present existence would evaporate, leaving only the original reality where Sadira never died. Then there were the pessimists, who believed that nothing could be changed. They were, however, willing to believe that the pilot could uncover evidence of how the Ainya had triggered the disaster and bring the information back to us so we could ensure that no other planet would face devastation of this magnitude. Naraldi, an experienced and well-traveled pilot, was selected for the mission. I know him well. He has always been highly pragmatic in approach. Cutting short the debate, he accepted the three different mission briefs, to be acted on according to his own analysis of the situation. He then gave up his mindship to link with a specially modified vessel. Traveling far from the populated sectors of the galaxy, he set out on the new, untried courseand disappeared. And we waited. Months later, the emissary returned to confirm in person the news we had already received. The mission had been a success, and yet not so, for our fate had not changed and no evidence had been discovered. We were to continue as if we had never attempted such a thing, and no further discussion would be entertained. In time, reports from the scientists analyzing the mission would be made available to higher-ranking government officials. He paused, coming out of storyteller mode to meet my spellbound gaze. You have read one of these reports, from my own handheld. Do you remember it? I tried. I think I remember the occasion, but as for the report, I mainly recall that I didnt understand very much at all. It was highly technical. The corner of his mouth quirked briefly upward in wry agreement. The amount of complex multivariate calculus in that report was somewhat off-putting. However, the gist of it was that there are already stable parallel time lines in existence. Naraldi was not able to change our fate, because he had no way of navigating to our past. He was able to reach many other pasts of different time lines and see other presents and futures as well. But his own line he could not touch. His expression became shadowed, regretful. Now you can understand why no ceremonies were held. We were still hoping to make the nightmare simply vanish away. What happened to Naraldi? I asked. He blinked away the sadness, his look growing sharp and assessing. He returned safely after about five months. You met him. He is now the Sadiri Consul on Cygnus Beta, an honorable and restful assignment from a grateful government. That aged face, those sorrowful eyes. Creeping horror stilled me as I absorbed this. How long was he out there? Dllenahkh shrugged. No one can tell. What chronometer could have made sense of his journeys? He was seventy years old when he left, barely middle-aged by our reckoning. Now he appears to be at least fifty years older than that. Fifty years in only a few months! I was appalled. Dllenahkh took pity on me. Do not be distressed on his behalf. When I spoke to him, he told me he had had some pleasant experiences and some less so, but he had never once been bored. For a mindship pilot, that is more than enough. Suddenly he leaned forward, looking sideways at me in a manner that was half secretive, half triumphant. His voice became very quiet. There was one very interesting thing that he learned which is extremely relevant to our time line. He discovered, well before the fact, how Ain was quarantined. I shifted closer to catch every word, every nuance of his tone and expression. Go on, I urged, both amused and excited that he had indulged in a little theatrical pause. Anyone trying to enter the Ain system will simply find themselves on the opposite side, having passed only empty space between. The planet has been placed in an elegant pocket of folded space-time, a feat which is well beyond the abilities of anyone from this timeanyone that we know, that is. What happened to those off-planet Ainya who tried to return after the quarantine? I wondered. Dllenahkhs face became completely expressionless, which spoke to me of hidden anger. No Sadiri pilot would have taken them, and as for the ZhinuviansI think that we have seen for ourselves how they would treat a passenger who did not have the funds for a return trip. I nudged his knee with the back of my hand and was rewarded when his bleak look lifted. He spoke lightly, changing the subject. It may be of interest to you that in one of the time lines Naraldi visited, it was the Ntshune and not the Sadiri who became influential in galactic government. I laughed out loud. Come on! He shook his head in amusement at my cynicism. I know that at times we Sadiri give the impression that we consider our minds to be the finest in the galaxy. I assure you, I know this is not the case. A more ambitious Ntshune government could easily have surpassed us as diplomats and judges. Even the Zhinuvians, who already have the fleet to challenge us, only lack unified government to guide them into a position of power. Well, thank you for telling me that. Itll be our little secret, I joked. Humility was not a common Sadiri traitbut then again, Dllenahkh had always been unique. He smiled. You can do something for me in turn. Tell me about the Caretakers. My eyes widened. What can I tell you? Its not likeI meanwe dont have reports on them; theres no branch of study dedicated to them. Its all folktales and oral history. Not a religion, not even a superstition, but justthere, part of our identity as Cygnians. Then tell me what you can, he insisted, facing me fully and pointedly giving me his complete attention. I paused. Id never discussed anything remotely metaphysical with the Sadiri. It made me realize that for all I pretended otherwise, I did care what they thought about me. It did matter to me that even if they saw me as talkative, emotional, and half out of control most of the time, at least they could not fault my scientific mind. My tongue felt strangely heavy as I tried to talk of things I had secretly forbidden myself to discuss. To Cygnians, the Caretakers are the guardians of humanity. Theyre supposed to save the best of us from the worst of us, even if its only a remnant. Were not perfect here on Cygnus Beta, but at least for those who claim to have been brought by the Caretakers, theres an additional claim that they were saved for a reason, chosen for a purpose. Not because theyre better than any other group but because theres something unique they possess, some characteristic that contributes to the fullness of humanity. Its a responsibility, not a point of pride. Its something to live up to, and it helps keep us going. Admirable, said Dllenahkh, and his tone was neither cautiously neutral nor subtly judging, as I had feared it might be. It was mildly but distinctly approving. I felt encouraged enough to continue. If all the tales are true, no ones seen the Caretakers face to face. No flaming chariots, no wheels within wheels, no wings. Its a very boring legend when you think about itjust some people following the music of an invisible Pied Piper, disappearing into one cave near Hamelin, Terra, and emerging from another cave near Hamelin, Cygnus Beta. Do Cygnians have any theories about what exactly the Caretakers are? Dllenahkh inquired, apparently rapt by the little I was telling him. I shrugged. No one thinks they are gods. Thats religion, and weve got plenty of that already. Some say they are humans from the past and pour out a libation for them. Others say they are people from the future and light fragrant incense to them. Another group says they are souls tasked after death to do all the work that wasnt done in life. They dont venerate the Caretakers in any way. They just work very hard to be sure they wont have to make up for lost time after theyre dead. What do you think? he asked. Perhaps a little of all three, I said. Remember your ancestors, dream of your descendants, and work hard while youre living. Itsnice to think the universe has a purposewell, more than one, probably, but at least one of them is about helping humans fulfill their potential as a species. Strong anthropic principle? Dllenahkh murmured. At least medium, I conceded with a smile. And I know that sounds very strange and unscientific, so thank you. Thanks for listening to me. Why wouldnt I listen? You listened to all I had to say about parallel time lines, and that sounded very strange, though scientific. Not strange at all, I disagreed. The Caretakers did some fairly interesting things when they went about collecting their endangered humans. I understand theres a community of Cygnians that say theyre descended from the last survivors of a nuclear winter on Terra. From a parallel time line? Dllenahkh queried, his eyebrows rising with surprise and interest. Must be, and its not only them. All I can say is if any Cygnian tells you theyre a direct descendant of Will Shakespeare, dont be too quick to call them a liar. I stretched out my legs, which had grown almost numb from being tucked under me while I was absorbed in conversation. Dllenahkh also moved into a more relaxed posture, leaning his elbows on his knees. I looked at the slight smile on his face and decided to take advantage. What about you? Are there any similar, unscientific beliefs in your culture? He answered easily, not in the least offended. With respect to ancestors, descendants, and working hard, most certainly. However, there are no Caretakers in our lore. Sadira was always where we started and where we ended, no matter how many years and light-years lay between. In a way, the elders of the family are our Caretakers. There is an old saying that no elder can truly die who has a hundred descendants living. Many elders do act as if the larger the pyramid of offspring below them, the better their chances of ascending to some afterlife. They have a hand in arranging every adoption and marriage, divorce and shunning. Family is blood and more than blood. I said nothing. Female Sadiri elders had already answered the call and begun to settle on Cygnus Beta. Some of those elders had a few descendants; most had none. It was particularly satisfying to think of those who had never had children suddenly heading their own clans of adoptees and foreign brides and perhaps, just perhaps, secretly and unscientifically thinking of the ladder they were building to a previously unattainable heaven. Gennea, Falve, Collan, Lauri. Startled, I struggled for a moment to understand the language Dllenahkh was speaking, and then I realized they were names. I held my breath and waited. He continued. My older sister, my younger sister, my younger brother, and my mother. My father, Nahkhen, died many years ago. Also two nieces, a nephew, and one brother-in-law. Among the living, I can count a sister-in-law, now remarried, and three cousins, two of my generation and one of my mothers generation, all resident on New Sadira. One second cousin of my generation is here on Cygnus Beta. He bit his lip, looking rueful, then confessed, I know my kin far better now than I ever did. I didnt know what to say, but I had to think of something because the silence was making my throat close up. Theres a small lake in the middle of the park. People go there to light floating candles in memory of their dead. At midnight, they turn off all the park lights so theres nothing but stars and candlelight. I waited fearfully as a few more seconds ticked by, and then he said hoarsely, I think I would like to see that. The long silence that followed was more tolerable, breathable, and peaceful. A thought struck me. Dllenahkh, you told me how Ain was quarantined, but you didnt tell me who did it. Does anyone know? He gave me a slightly surprised look. I was under the impression that most Cygnians give that honor to the Caretakers. You believe it was the Caretakers too? I asked. I was skeptical, not about the Caretakers but that any Sadiri would seriously consider this to be a possibility. As a hypothesis, it has some merit. Ability to manipulate time and space, telepathic influence strong enough to erase memory or inhibit discussion of witnessed eventswe have seen the fledgling versions of those skills both here on Cygnus Beta and among mindship pilots of Naraldis caliber. Why not speculate that humans in the future could do as much and more? Has merit, I repeated mockingly. Just admit itweve turned you into a Cygnian. He got to his feet and extended a hand to help me up from the bench. I accepted the hand, careful to touch only the fingertips and only for a second. He surprised me by taking my other hand and drawing it under his arm to rest near the crook of his elbow so that we looked very much like the other promenading couples. And would that be such a terrible thing to admit? he said in a tone of cheerful surrender. This is my universe, my time, my world. There is no going back to what was. There is only the future. We had more than two hours till midnight, plenty of time to walk the length and breadth of the park before a pause to visit the lakes small boardwalk and crouch there to light several candles. Dllenahkh looked at them as they floated away to twinkle amid a growing constellation of tiny lights in the lakes center, then gazed up at the stars. I thought I knew what he was seeking. The newer arrivals always did itlooked for the light, actual or imagined, of their home star. I wonder how long it will be before starlight shines on Sadira once more, he said quietly. I stopped breathing for a moment, a surge of pity seizing my heart. On Cygnus Beta, mentioning a recent disaster in detail is taboo. It is referred to obliquely, delicately, in general terms like the great war or the big wave. The Sadiri had fallen into that habit with swift gratitude, and not once had I heard them specify how Sadira had been laid waste. Not until that moment, when Dllenahkh looked to the sky and acknowledged the world-girdling poisonous cloud that covered Sadira in perpetual night. We walked, rested, and walked again, but just before midnight we came back to the lake and waited for the lights-off. When it came, it was as remarkable as the holos Id seen and more. The moonless night pressed on the eyes like thick, heavy felt, making the small flames sear the vision as they danced on the dark water. The stars added their cold fire overhead, and yet the night remained dim enough to hide my attempts to dash away tears. Of course I spoiled it by blowing my nose, but there were other sighs and rustles and coping noises in the respectful but imperfect silence, so I did not feel completely alone. Dllenahkh was perfectly silent and absolutely still, though he did clear his throat at one point. When the lights came back on, we left the park and found transportation to the hotel. He bade me good night at my door, and with neither prior thought nor self-consciousness, I stretched up to kiss his cheek quickly. He gave me a searching look, then gently brushed his forefinger along my cheekbones to the corner of each eye, wiping away the slight moisture my furtive swipes had missed earlier. The tender gesture almost made me tear up again. Sleep well, Grace, he said in farewell before he turned away to his own door. I went into my room feeling a bit dreamy. It lasted all of three minutes, up until the moment the bathroom door opened to reveal Lian, yawning and dressed for bed. Its all yours, Lian started to say, then got a good look at me. Hmm. What? Lian shrugged. Im a fan of the kohl myself, but I forgot to warn youdont wear it on Remembrance Day or at any event where you might be crying. Youre a bitsmudged. Good night. Zero hour plus one year ten months six days Dllenahkh walked the short distance to his own room. He felt at peace, at peace with his sorrow and fear and loneliness, and it was such a new sensation that he held it carefully, observing it curiously, wondering how long it would last and whether he could call it back the next time he had to face the things he did not wish to remember. The moment of introspection was too brief. He found his door ajar and the light on. He entered his room with caution to see Joral, worried, and Sergeant Fergus, drunk. Resigned, he braced himself for unpleasantness. Sergeant Fergus insisted on waiting to speak to you, Joral said nervously. It wont take long, sir, Fergus said, his speech still clear but with an edge of belligerence that warned Dllenahkh to be careful. Very well, Sergeant. I am listening. Dllenahkh did not close the door. Fergus looked at it and hesitated, but Dllenahkh merely walked farther in, removed his jacket, and tossed it onto the rooms only chair. He then sat on the bed and began to take off his boots. The sergeant took the hint and began to talk quickly. Its about Kirtahsg. Ive been following the case, and its not going well. Dllenahkh straightened up and paid attention. To his chagrin, he had not given any recent thought to the Kirtahsg situation. Fergus continued. The governments been dealing with the children, but they havent gone after the cartels. They say thats a galactic matter. He paused uncertainly. Theyve filed a complaint with the Galactic Judiciary, but Dllenahkh felt unexpectedly embarrassed. These things take time, Sergeant, even more now than previously. I thoughtif you knew someone Fergus muttered. I have sent my own report to the Galactic Judiciary via our Council, Dllenahkh said quietly. I am afraid I have no further influence at that level. The explosion was anticipated, but it still made both Sadiri jump when Fergus began to shout. You set yourselves up as the incorruptible guardians of the galaxy. You created a system where everyone had to go to you. Now youre holding on to that power with aa hollow government and a skeleton fleet. It isnt right! Someone has to stop pretending! Instinctively, Dllenahkh mentally reached out to brace Joral, an unnecessary act given the sergeants low psi levels and Jorals improved steadiness. He bent his mind to Fergus instead. Sergeant, it is late, he suggested. We must not disturb the other guests. We must not disturb the Commissioner. Fergus looked around in sudden fear as if expecting to see Dr. Daniyel standing in the doorway, but he immediately caught himself and turned back. Youre influencing me, he accused. Hardly, said Dllenahkh with complete honesty. I am only appealing to your common sense. You know we can discuss this in the morning. Still suspicious, Fergus glanced at the open door again. Another time, then, he said unwillingly. When he left, a few tense, silent seconds passed, and Joral let go a held breath. Nicely done, Councillor, he said with admiration. A light and skillful touch. Close the door as you go, Joral, Dllenahkh replied, too ashamed to accept the compliment. Joral bid him a subdued good night and went to his own room. Dllenahkh prepared for bed, his movements automatic. They had been given so much sympathy for so long that the sergeants rage was disorienting. Were there others who had stopped feeling sorry for the stricken Sadiri and were instead beginning to question their place and purpose? What did Fergus expect him to do for Kirtahsg when it took all his efforts to keep the young men of his own settlement from despair and self-destruction? And yetwho could help Kirtahsg now if the Sadiri were too busy surviving to arbitrate the lives of others? He lay in darkness for several minutes, asking himself unanswerable questions. He knew only one thing: his brief equilibrium was a ruin, and his dreams would only mirror that brokenness. Soon he was once more outside Delaruas room, this time leaning tiredly against the door frame as he knocked. She came to the door, looking rumpled and sleepy, and he quickly straightened, unsure what to say but relieved that she was there. It charmed him to see that they were dressed similarly for bed, in trousers and tunic. He wondered what she would say if she could read his mind. Would it amuse or vex her to learn that although he thought she had looked very pretty all dressed up for the concert, he preferred her like this, in her usual unstudied simplicity of body and mind? She took him in with one glance. Oh. Bad night? It could be, he confessed. She stepped back. Come in.          THE LAST ASSIGNMENT It should be obvious by now that Im not good at dealing with change. Id settled into my new role on the mission team. I probably knew more about the Sadiri both on- and off-planet than any other Cygnian. My friendship with Dllenahkh was as strong, comfortable, and close as it was kiss-free (which is to say completely, but like I said, kissing isnt everything). Id finally restored a level of routine to my life, and I simply could not bend my mind to consider that the mission would be over in a couple of weeks. Everyone else had a job and a life to return to. I should have been making plans for my future. I wasnt. I was hiding from uncertainty by immersing myself in the excitement of our final visit. Wed saved the strangest for last. The taSadiri had settled mainly in the equatorial and tropical belts, keeping to a warm climate whenever possible. It was what they were best adapted to, and the Sadiri are nothing if not traditional and practical. The last settlement on the schedule was the most distant, sited on a peninsula barely clear of the polar regions. We traveled by air and set down near a fjord under the shadow of a large, low volcano. When I stepped out, braced for the worst in my insulated jacket and hood, I slowed in shock. Stinks, said Lian, exiting close behind me. Hot, I said in utter surprise, lowering my hood and unsealing my jacket. And it was. The waters of the fjord steamed, and the atmosphere was a curious mix of warm, heavy air and puffs of sharp, icy wind. The landscape was treeless, sloping down the narrow inlet with a cradling effect and alternating between green lichen and black basalt. Nasiha, Tarik, and Joral exited from the jump jet looking ambivalent, unimpressed by the fluctuating heat and humidity but curious at the idea that Sadiri would have chosen to live in such a place. Fergus, who had been piloting, stuck his head out and sniffed the air suspiciously. You sure you know where youre going? Quite sure, Sergeant, said Nasiha calmly, making slow, sweeping movements with her geosensor. All we need to do is find the entrance. She deserved to feel a bit complacent. It had been her hard work and brilliance, and Tariks too of course, that had uncovered this place from the various legends and folktales theyd diligently collected in every settlement and town wed visited. A little cross-checking with the records of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the Polar Exploration Institute had borne fruit that would be worth at least one paper, maybe two. The taSadiri settlement had been underground, sheltered from the extreme weather, running on geothermal energy, and thus still the right temperature to remind them of home. Of course, this was a scientific expedition, not a diplomatic one. The settlement had been unpopulated for centuries. The Commissioner and the Councillor were back in Tlaxce, already bogged down in interviews with Cygnian and Sadiri media and meetings with representatives of global, interplanetary, and galactic bodies. That left us to have the funand it was fun. Of all the places Id been to, this was the one that I took care to record with my comm. Id probably never be this far north again in my life. Over there. Tarik pointed. It looked like rock at first, but it was a regular, man-made structure, built low and strong against the wind into the hillside. We found a door at the side, half sunk into the ground with steps going down, like the entrance to a bunker. When we entered, the lights came on. I felt first disorientation, then vertigo. Do we all go down? asked Joral doubtfully, hitching a large, bulky bag higher up on one shoulder. Tarik examined the small elevator-like structure hanging suspended in the center over an unfathomably deep mine shaft. The carrying capacity is more than adequate. However, there are also emergency chutes at the circumference if you prefer. Joral turned to examine them as Tarik pointed them out. He blinked. They were narrow tubes of some transparent material, even more claustrophobia-inducing than the main lift. No, he said quickly. No, that will not be necessary. Tarik turned to Nasiha. There is no need for you to come with us. So you have already told me, she said. You have my response on that matter. Further discussion at this stage is Then at least grant me this. You will return to the surface immediately if I consider it to be too dangerous. I was impressed. I had never heard Tarik interrupt Nasiha before. That sounds reasonable, she admitted reluctantly. I looked away from them to hide my smile. The ride down was long, dark, and filled with ominous creaking sounds, but I wasnt too worried as I knew this technology was a relatively recent addition by the Mineral Resources people. Nasiha led us out of the lift to the rim of the single pool of light around the shaft. Pale lights came up and slowly strengthened as she tapped access codes into her comm. Joral opened his bag and handed out hard hats with miners lightsold, solid technology but with a few modern additions like built-in nav and emergency oxygen generators. I put mine on gladly and vidded myself with my wrist comm looking all adventurer-like while Lian laughed at me. Where do we go? asked Joral, and it was a good question, because the mines lights illuminated at least six different paths leading away to God knows where in the vastness. Nasihas reply was reassuringly prompt and confident. This way. She led us for half an hour along a path with damp, dripping rock above and around. The water was warm, and I couldnt help but feel that there must be some pools nearby worth soaking in, fed by hot springs and rich with minerals. Decadent taSadiri of this austere outpost kicking back in their hot tubs while the weather above them went to subzeroI could picture it. We turned away from the lights onto a less even path, scrambled through a few narrow places, and then we were there. It was worth it! Id missed seeing Piedra in real life, so I had no comparison, but as far as cities carved out of sheer rock go, this was damned impressive. I hurt my neck swiveling around trying to get my headlight to capture the full scope of an arch that was two stories high and bracketed by windows that hinted at rooms within the rock. The arch itself led into a cathedral of a passageway, with more windows high in the walls and arched doorways a little above path level, their steps crumbling as if eroded by running water. I could imagine the subterranean street lit by cool, pale lamps during the night and warm, bright lamps in the day. Greenhouses near the surface were a possibility, Nasiha had said, close enough to take advantage of skylights but deep enough to tap into the earths heat. Rivers and inlets were filled with fish adapted to living underground, feeding on algae swept in by the tides of the fjord. A glitter caught my eye, and I went closer to see the muted sheen of crystal in the rock, not excavated but incorporated into the carvings of the door lintel. It was a rich place, an unexpected Eden. Why was it deserted? Tarik approached one set of steps more closely and beckoned us over. Look, he said. The path has risen. We are walking on the remnants of a lava flow. That put my vivid imagination to work in a less pleasant area. I imagined the street illuminated with a hellish red, oozing past doors and trapping people inwait a minute. Tarik, was this place abandoned before the lava came through? Did they find any remains? I asked. He nodded approvingly at the question. None. They must have had warning of the eruption and evacuated to some other place. Then, when they returned, they found it uninhabitable. I understood what he meant when the path went sharply upward, allowing us to walk along the level of the first-story windows and then past them until the ceiling of the tunnel stopped us. Who knows how much more lies under that rock, Lian said wonderingly. Lian had also missed seeing Piedra. How do you know for certain that taSadiri lived here? This is similar to the stone carving of Piedra, and some of the symbols here can also be found in ancient Sadiri texts, Joral explained. However, there may have been other We froze. There was a sudden scuttling patter that made me think uncomfortably of giant spidersmy own fault for having watched preholo monster movies with Joral and Lian two nights previously. Rockfall, said Nasiha crisply after the echoes had died away. Small earthquakes are common in this area. It is nothing to be concerned about. I would have believed her in an instant, but Tarik was frowning and checking his geosensor. Seismic data from the mines sensors do indicate that caution may be advisable. How much longer do you need to record The path beneath us fell away ten centimeters or so, then surged higher, leaving us first stumbling and then gasping on our knees. We go now, Tarik ordered, clipping his geosensor to his belt and seizing hold of his wifes arm. Nasiha tried to collect herself. Wait, the Good idea, Lian interrupted briskly. We staggered out, disoriented by the occasional vibration of the ground and the wavering shadows as our headlights bobbed. Thats how I ran into Tariks back. What is it? Joral asked sharply. There was no answer, and for a moment I wondered hysterically if the way was blocked and he was afraid to tell us, but then, one by one, we turned and squinted up through the dust, half unsure about what we were seeing. Everyone, turn off your lights, Tarik commanded. Far from the mines lamps and with our own lights out, it was obvious. There was a slender beam of illuminated dust, as if someone had cracked open a window several stories up. But were so far down, Lian murmured in awe. A light well, Nasiha said. Another part of the city must have been opened by the earth tremor. Lian switched a light back on and swept it along the ground leading to the beam. The terrain was steep but passable. You guys stay here. Well scout ahead, see if theres anything worth investigating. I dithered, trying to decide whether I wanted to be classified as a you guys or a we, but as Joral followed Lian, curiosity got the better of me. With an apologetic glance back at Nasiha, I scrambled to catch up with them. When I arrived, out of breath, at the source of the light, they were crouched beside the gap, staring transfixed. I huddled in to take a peek and saw a huge cavern lit by massive tubes of mirror and glass. Some were dim and darkperhaps covered over by earth where they were meant to emerge into sunlightbut there were enough tubes still functioning for us to see that the street we had just walked was a mere back alley. This was the heart of the city, its forum magnum. I vidded what I could see and stuck my arm out to vid what I couldnt. Lian began to pull at the rocks around the edge of the gap, trying to clear more space. Lets see if we can get down there. Stair-connected balconies ridged the walls of the cavern. Lian went through the gap and carefully climbed down a few meters of rock face to stand on one of them. Im sure thats dangerous, I said nervously. Joral, dont you have some rope in that kit bag? A very good idea, he said, also looking apprehensive. He took out a length of slender cord. Securing one end to a projection of rock, he lowered the other end to Lian, who caught it and hooked it onto a belt loop without comment. Tarik should see this at least, I said. Ill go back and stay with Nasiha so he can come up. I made the switch, consoling Nasiha with some images from my comm vid while Tarik went to examine the find. Then the earth shook again, a long, powerful tremor. I gasped. Lets get out of here, I said to Nasiha. We stumbled a short distance, and then she cried out, Tarik! Delarua! Take Nasiha to the surface now! he shouted back. You promised, I told her, unfairly perhaps, but it had an effect. She let me pull her into a near run as we headed for the main path, and once the way was lit, she outpaced me to the shaft lift. Get in, she snapped. They can use the emergency tubes. I got in. The earth had calmed again, but I felt as if Id had my fill of adventures of this kind. Several different phobias assailed me as we ascended. We were so high upwhat if the lift failed and we fell? What if it got to the top and didnt open, trapping us in a box? What if it failed, fell, and left us to be buried alive in the dark? I breathed deeply, marshaling everything I had learned in meditation practice to keep myself sane. Nasiha had only one fear, and I could read it in her eyes. Tarik will be right behind us, I promised. The lift opened. I grasped Nasihas hand and ran out and up the stairs into the open, not giving her a chance to think about waiting for the others inside that windowless chamber. We collapsed on the hillside, sitting facing the door. Nasiha frowned at her geosensor, then tried her comm, tapping and calling Tariks name, then Jorals, then Lians. There was no response. I am a fool, she whispered, her face bleak. Come on, come on, I muttered at the empty doorway. Youre all okay; youve got to be. A long, agony-filled minute later, Tarik came out, coughing and covered in dust. Nasiha went to meet him, took his hands, and seemed to sigh. I ran past them. Lian! Lian? Joral? I whipped back around. Where are they? Tarik looked at me, somber and ashamed. We must call for help. There has been a significant collapse of the exit tunnel. I slapped on my comm. Fergus! Call Emergency Services. We have two missing. By the time we got down to the jump jet, we found that Fergus had called Emergency Services and also managed to contact Lian by using the jets comm. They were both uninjured, but there was no way out. Nasiha scanned the data provided by the Ministry, but to no avail. The newly discovered cavern was unmapped. I tried to be cheerful as I chatted to Lian and Joral. Look on the bright side. Youre in the warm, theres sunlight all around, and youre in the middle of the discovery of the century. Walk around; take some pics and vids for us. Find something Nasiha can write a paper about. As we talked to them, the first team from Emergency Services turned up. They were a small group from a nearby science outpost and they lacked excavation equipment, but they did have all manner of scanning technology to determine the extent of the collapse and figure out where to start digging when the heavy equipment arrived. They also checked us over, giving Nasiha particular attention, then declared us fine and tried to ignore us as we told them everything we knew and a few things we didnt and, frankly, breathed down their necks in a very unhelpful way. The fact that communication is still possible suggests that transponder technology could be used to locate them, Tarik said. I have no doubt that we will locate them in time, the Emergency Services chief explained patiently. The challenge is factoring in the interference from magnetic fluctuations caused by the volcanic activity. He was a pale-skinned man, regrettably spare of fat for such a cold climate, and his short frame was made even smaller by the bulkiness of his parka. His eyebrows had a perpetually worried slant that did not reassure. His voice made up for it, though, deliberately slow and slightly soft so that you felt you had to dial down your own hysteria to be able to hear him clearly. But the fact that we can still communicate with them is good, isnt it? I asked. His expression turned wary. It is good in that we may be able to find out roughly where they are so we can plan how to excavate, but theres too much interference for certainty. Lets not get carried away. Well, what about those light tubes? I insisted. Shouldnt we try to find where they come out, maybe use Maam, he said, firmly cutting me off. We appreciate that youre concerned about your friends, but we do know our job. Our networks have been informed, and there are people working to solve the problem. Of course, I said, defeated. Butyou understand why we cant lose them? Especially not Joral. Not now. Not like this. He blew out a breath, looking as if he were trying to choose his next words very carefully. Id like to recommend that you return home as scheduled. To be honest, we cant afford to have nonessential personnel using up our resources. You might be able to do more for your friends by being in Tlaxce than being here. It was a kind but definite brush-off, and it meant we had to have a final conversation with Lian and Joral. Theyre kicking us out, I said casually. We have to go back, stop getting in their way and stuff. Lian played along. Well, you know what that means. Cant put your name in the acknowledgments when we make our big discoveries. I laughed, then sobered. About what I said earlier, walking around and so on? Be careful. Conserve your resources. I know Jorals got a thing or two in the bag, but Delarua, I am a corporal, you know, said Lian, gently teasing. I didnt forget all my survival training when they made me a pencil pusher. To replace you, I might add. My laugh was a little too close to a sob, so I cut it short. Yeah, man, sorry about that one. So Ill be seeing you later, okay? I waited for Tarik and Nasiha to finish speaking with Joral, and then I started a conversation in rapid Sadiri so that Lian would not understand. Joral, I know that if you remember all that Councillor Dllenahkh has taught you, your chances of survival are excellent. Delarua, I have considered this. I know it will be more difficult for someone who has not been trained in psychosomatic control. I am not sufficiently advanced in the disciplines to exert this control beyond my own body, but I will at least ensure that our colleague consumes more food and water than I do. I smiled at his careful efforts not to attract attention by using Lians name. Joral, I hope that it will not be necessary for you to deny yourself what little food and drink you have, but I know that whatever you choose to do, you will choose well. Time to treat the boy like a man. Heaven knows he deserved it by now. When the jump jet took off, we all gazed down at the land we were leaving. I couldnt guess what everyone was feeling at that point, but I bet Fergus was thinking that if he had been underground with us, he could have done something. As for myself, I was damping down my emotions, that thing Im so very good at, and scrutinizing the slopes for any flash of glass or metal that might suggest a protruding light tube. I saw none. A few minutes into the flight, we called Qeturah and Dllenahkh and updated them. An hour later, we arrived at our stop-over point, changed, ate, and switched from the jump jet to a slower but more comfortable shuttle. At first it seemed natural to talk a bit about the old underground city and what new discoveries might be made there, but as we monitored the bulletins from Emergency Services, the journey grew quieter and quieter. The revised time to reach Lian and Joral was no longer being given in hours but in days. When we arrived in Tlaxce City that evening, there was still no good news. The small welcoming ceremony at Central Government Headquarters had been quietly called off, and all that remained of the end-of-mission reception were a few napkin-covered plates of assorted finger foods. In case we were hungry, Qeturah said in an offhand fashion as we filed into her office, but I saw eight plates on her meeting-room table and a dying hope in her eyes. I couldnt blame her. Id half expected to step off the shuttle and find that Lian and Joral were fine and at home, flown ahead at supersonic speed just to surprise us. Dllenahkh seemed depressed, but in a healthy way, if that makes any sense. From the questions he asked us, I knew he was trying to convince himself that nothing would have happened any differently if he had been there. It was nobodys fault, Dllenahkh, I said wearily. Nobodys or everybodys, take your pick. This isnt a postmission debriefing, Qeturah said hastily. Were not in the frame of mind for that. She glared at Dllenahkh and added pointedly, None of us. This iswell, even if we couldnt have a proper homecoming, I wanted us to meet one last time. I was miserable but strangely glad to be there, because I didnt want to be miserable alone and there wasnt anyone else I wanted to be miserable with. We werent grieving for Lian and Joral. We were worried about them, but we still had hopes of seeing them very soon. We were dealing with the fact that the mission was over, that the life we had made ours for a year was not the life we would be facing on the morrow. Not having Lian and Joral there only emphasized how much we were going to miss one another. I blinked back tears so many times that I had to excuse myself to go to the ladies room to have a proper nose blow and wash my face. When I returned, Fergus was standing outside Qeturahs office door. He was speaking into his comm as I approached, but by the time I reached him he had finished the call and was staring oddly at the device in his hand. Curiosity overrode my initial intent to nod and pass by. What is it, Sergeant? At first he didnt look at me. That was Lian. Just wanted to make sure wed made it back to the city okay. Then he met my eyes, and we exchanged a brief sympathetic look of shared pain before he remembered he didnt like me and looked away again. I cant believe the range those comms I started, then froze in midsentence, struck by something. He gave me his usual lowering frown. If youre getting any bright ideas that might help those two, youd better share. Do something without thinking it to death for a change. I didnt get it. Qeturah toed the line and he was fine with that, yet hed written me off because I hadnt been enough of a maverick. I was peeved and let him know it. Enough, Sergeant, I said sharply. Central Governments taking care of Kirtahsg, so stop blaming me for that. Besides, I have at least as much reason as you to care about what happens to Lian and a hell of a lot more reason when it comes to Joral. I took the comm from him and examined it curiously. It was a top-of-the-line military-grade comm, far better than any wrist model or civilian handheld. Bullshit, he said. Sadiri or Cygnian, were all endangered when were facing death. Got anything useful to contribute, maam? I looked at him and wished for a moment that I was on better terms with this man. I might. But Ill need to take this comm with me, just for an hour or two. I was lying. I didnt know how much time I needed. He swore under his breath. I stared at him impassively. You can choose to say no, Sergeant, but say it quickly. Times wasting. Big bluff. I hoped it would impress him just a little. Was that Qeturahs trick? Act as if youre in command, and suddenly theyll start following your orders? Take the damned comm, he said at last in resignation. I took it all right. I took it straight to Dllenahkh. Youre staying at the Sadiri Consulate while youre working in the city, right? He raised an eyebrow at the incongruous juxtaposition of the mundane question and my conspiratorial whisper. Yes. Any way to get an immediate private audience with your pilot friend? The man whos seen things mere mortals only dream of? The man whos been to several futures and who may or may not have the advanced technological know-how to use the fact that Ferguss comm is still picking up a clear signal from Lians halfway across the globe and through a ton of rock? Dllenahkh then did something completely Sadiri and utterly adorable. He blinked at my babbled words, filled in the blanks speedily, and arrived at a course of action. Come with me, he said. Our leaving broke up the meeting. Qeturah looked a little bemused, but Fergus gave me a stiff yet encouraging nod. I so badly wanted to tell Nasiha and Tarik, but I didnt dare risk the possibility that they werent supposed to know about Naraldis unique experiences. They hardly noticed. They were once more wrapped up in each other, and this time I didnt mind one bit. Thank you, Dllenahkh, I said as I got into his aircar and belted myself in. He frowned in puzzlement as he tapped in our destination. Why are you thanking me? I havent done anything yet. You listen to my crazy ideas and make sense out of them. Thats worth some thanks. He let the autopilot take us and turned to face me, eyes flashing. What you describe as the product of a mental imbalance, I would classify as swift, intuitive thinking to arrive at creative solutions. There is no passion like the passion of a Sadiri complimenting your mind. For a moment I was speechless, completely speechless. I gawked up at him like a lovestruck teenager. Youyou really mean that. You know that I do. Why is it so difficult for you to believe that? I rested my hand over his, a gesture of apology and truce. I believe it, I said softly. He looked down at my hand and slowly turned his so that we fitted palm to palm. Touching him was never a simple matter, but touching him now, when his emotions were so close to the surface, was like standing on the seashore with the tide drawing out, pulling the sand from under my feet. I wanted to fall into the water. The aircar smoothly grounded. The Sadiri Consulate is in fact very close to Central Government Headquarters. Were here, I said, trying not to sound disappointed. A quick comm call to the Consul ensured that he was at least a little prepared when we invaded his living room for an impromptu meeting. He was too professional to show irritation in front of me, but he still managed to give Dllenahkh a very pointed look when he said, I believe it was clearly stated that you were to tell no one about my travels. Dllenahkh was unperturbed. Im sorry, Naraldi. I was under the impression that the restriction did not apply to Sadiri above a certain level of government. The Consul looked at mein fact, he looked at my head and its fuzz of dull brown hairin silent comment at the un-Sadiri sight of me, then surrendered with a small shrug. Show me the communicator. I handed it over and watched him excitedly as he opened it up and pondered the innards, taking occasional glances at a handheld for reference notes. Then he sat back, eyes narrowing as he contemplated his drumming fingers for further enlightenment. Eventually, he returned to the handheld and made some quick audio and written inputs, at least one of which was a message by the distinctive sound of the send chime. At last, he pulled a datachip out of his handheld, stood, and gave it to Dllenahkh. Dllenahkh, if you will permit the indignity to your position, kindly deliver this personally to the Consulates communications office. It is of a sensitive nature and must go out as soon as possible. Dllenahkh bowed, gave me a quick reassuring glance, and left the room. I watched him go, feeling even more lost than before. Your Excellency, I said plaintively, could you tell me whats happening? The Consul sat down again, his expression suddenly tired. Can I, or should I? I do not want to raise your hopes unduly, Ms. Delarua. You assumed correctlyI do have technological knowledge that might result in a swifter rescuebut knowledge can only go so far. I would need a certain level of existing technology to effect a quick solution, and such technology is not yet available. My heart sank. He saw how my face changed and relented. There is a small hope. I have sent a message for help. I cannot be sure it will be answered, but I can do no more. Who is it? How long will they take to get here? For all that I tried not to sound excited, the words still came out too quickly, too eagerly. He lowered his eyes, and his jaw tensed as if he were biting back words. After a brief silence, he sighed and answered, I am sorry, Ms. Delarua. I really couldnt say. I opened my mouth to plead with him, then paused, closed my mouth, and frowned slightly. Couldnt say, I repeated. His quick upward glance begged me to understand. Couldnt. My heart began to pound. I swallowed and tried to compose myself. I think I understand you, Your Excellency. At leastI hope I do.          THE UNLIKELY ANGEL On the first day after I spoke to the Sadiri Consul, I went to visit my mother. This was a bit of a mistake because Maria and Grace were still there, Rafi was only home from school every other weekend, and my mother had taken to spending long periods of time at another retiree friend whose apartment was uncluttered by offspring. Okay, perhaps that sounds a little unkind, but that was my first impression of the situation. Then, when I got there, I was entirely on my mothers side. Maria was refusing to continue therapywait, refusing is too strong a word. She was apathetic. Gracie was at the other extreme, suddenly acting out after years of suppression. My mother was at her wits end and would escape for a little sanity from time to time. Darling, shes my daughter, and I love her, but shes making me crazy, my mother confessed to me. We were sitting on her balcony, plotting strategy and carefully ignoring the yells coming from the kitchen as Maria struggled to get Gracie to finish eating lunch. I put on my dead-calm, responsible voice. This family already has its full quota of crazy, Mom. Lets not go over the edge. Therell be no one left to act as anchor. Well, what can I do? I mean, I was even thinking about proposing to Connie just to have an excuse to get out of the house permanently. Then I could leave this place to Maria and I blinked. Proposing to Connie? What happened to the guy you kept talking aboutDavi was his name? Well, dear, she said, lowering her voice to a hushed whisper, I didnt want to shock you, but it was Connie I meant all along. Davis her husband, but I think Ive almost persuaded her that shes better off without him. I tilted my head and pondered. Mom, I said, youre still a homesteader at heart, so Ill say this gently. Are you sure shes interested in you or is it both of them? My mother began to scoff, paused, and looked suddenly startled, then confused. Right; then it seems to me wed better make sure you hold on to your apartment for a little while longer. Better if Maria and Gracie come to my apartment. Ill be doing more work down on the Sadiri settlement anyway, and itll be harder for her to avoid therapy when shes near all the best institutes. But, dear, my mother protested, are you sure you want to do that? I mean, unless theres someone youre thinking of moving in with, I wouldnt wish Maria on you either. Too much Ntshune in my family. Too damn much. Her eyes lit up. There is someone, she said, leaning forward avidly. Go on! Whats he like? How old is he? Oh, it is a he, isnt it? Hes Sadiri. Furthermore, hes a Sadiri savant who is, in fact, older than you. But I think we were discussing your love life? I chided her with lofty dignity. Oh. I do seem to have made a mess of that, she said ruefully. I zapped a contact from my comm to hers. There. Thats my friend Gilda. Shes lovely and approachable and will give you all kinds of good advice about negotiating the currents of city polyamory. Justdont date her. Please. I would find that awkward. I picked up my handheld. Im making arrangements for Maria to move into my apartment within a couple of weeks. Please find a way to talk her into it by then. Ill do my best to push her back to therapy, but I think even a part-time job would work wonders. The credits from the divorce and compensation are only going to last so long, anyway. Now, hows Rafi? Terribly unhappy, she admitted, looking very distressed. I felt a pang of dismay. Shed been our rock all the time we were growing up. She shouldnt have to shoulder these burdens at her age. Never mind. Ill go see him tomorrow. Thus it was that on the second day after the Consul sent for help, I went to visit my nephew at his boarding school. Fortunately, Rafi wasnt so much terribly unhappy as quite naturally stressed by the new environment and the fact that he had come into it in the middle of the school year, when friendships are already sealed and group allegiances formed. He also viewed his being there as a kind of sentence rather than a privilege and a mark of distinction from the average Cygnian. We walked the immaculate school grounds, and I tried my best to cheer him up. They all show off so much. Talking mind to mind. Levitating scraps of paper, even, he said, glum and resistant to consoling. I looked him over, noting his extra six centimeters of height and a face that was moving from cute to handsome with less adolescent awkwardness than the norm. He could be popular. He must not be trying. Ive seen your psi profile. Youre stronger than any of them. Why dont you show off a little yourself? He shrugged. I could make everyone like me, but that sort of thing is frowned upon, oddly enough. As for the telepathytheres no one I really want to talk to, I guess. Hmm, I said. Whos in charge of your welfare around here? My House Master, I suppose. Why? He looked a little wary. Dont embarrass me. I gave him an incredulous look. When have I ever not been cool? Dont turn all teenage on me now. Just answer me one thing. Do you still like elephants? A quick consultation with his House Master ensured that Rafi and one other student would spend the next half-term holiday on an educational visit to the forest uplands. Theres more than one way to be popular, my boy, I told him as I was leaving. Elephants are cool. Eccentric aunts who send you and a fortunate friend to ride on elephants, they too are cool. Youre lucky Ive had no reason to dip into my holiday fund this year. I cant do this too often. Anyway, once should be enough to seal your reputation. He grinned at me. He knew I was up to something, more than was evident on the surface, but he trusted me enough to be amused and excited rather than worried. And by the way, I added, Id practice my telepathy while I was out there if I were you. Loudly. Vacation is no reason to slack off. Transferring the lease on my apartment and spending such a large sum on impulse meant that I had to consider my future sooner rather than later. And so on the third day after the Consuls leap of faith, I collared Nasiha in her temporary office at the Sadiri Consulate and asked bluntly, Want to work with me? She raised an eyebrow. You appear to have made certain assumptions about my future plans. Or perhaps Im trying to influence them. She smiled then, just a little. I had noticed that in spite of the fact that your breach of the Cygnian Science Code has caused you to be barred from empirical research, you have somehow managed to become the cause of academic papers by others. I would welcome the opportunity to examine the phenomenon further by continuing our association within an entrepreneurial framework. Tarik? I asked. It was interesting, this new vocal shorthand. I was finally living my life as if I had no time to waste. Nasihas gaze softened, and I was reminded just how much those two did love each other, although they would have found some other way to phrase it, no doubt. We have assessed various locations in terms of safety, stability, and support networks. We have decided to spend at least one year living in the Tlaxce Sadiri Settlement so that our child can be born there. After that, Tarik will probably return to working with the Science Council while I remain as primary parent for the first seven years. At the end of those seven yearswho knows? I may return to the Science Council while he becomes the primary parent. We may all return to New Sadira or to whatever planet we may be assigned. But that is in the future. I smiled. Tarik is a good husband and will make an excellent father. He loves you so much. Nasiha gave me an amused look. Of course. And I love him. For two days after that I didnt try to save the world or solve anyones problems. I worked on my reports diligently from home, having wisely turned down the offer of office space at the Sadiri Consulate. With everything that was happening, I didnt trust my professionalism that far. At home, I could at least periodically get up from my desk, look at the calendar, and scream into a pillow set aside for that purpose. Then I got a call from Dr. Freyda Mar herself. I heard youd come in, but I thought I should wait a bit. Im so sorry, she said. Freyda, its so good to hear from you. In spite of everything, I smiled when I heard her voice. Things have been a bit grim, but where theres life, theres hope. Thats so, she agreed. Look, Im going down to the homesteadings this afternoon to start the weeks rounds. Would you like to come with me? My gaze drifted to my handheld. I had been checking my messages in the minutes before Freydas call. A rather large number of the messages were from Fergusseveral variations on the tune of his comm and the fact that I had not returned it, no doubt. Since I had last seen it in bits and pieces in the Consuls living room, I was beginning to think that it might be a prudent move to try a change of scenery. Why, thank you, Freyda! Thatd be perfect. We can catch up. Freyda was as kind as ever. She opted for nav but no autopilot so that I wouldnt feel pressured to make small talk for the entire journey. I dived right into the important stuff, using my new blunt-and-direct mode. You and Lanuri. Progress? Her face was calm, her tone lighthearted. You are aware, Ms. Delarua, that government officials are not encouraged to fraternize with colleagues. It might interfere with efficiency. What they do at the end of the assignment is, of course, their own business. Entirely appropriate, I agreed. There was a small silence, and then we burst out laughing. I can play Sadiri for about ten minutes, tops, I admitted. Longer if Im really concentrating. So, you guys looking to get married soon after? She nodded happily. Yeah. Its funny; I didnt even have to make any moves. Once I started looking at things differently, it all seemed to unfold naturally somehow. How do you attract a Sadiris attention? Sound intelligent, she answered. Tell them something they didnt know or hadnt figured out for themselves. How do you know youve got their attention? Intensity like whoa, I said immediately. They drop everything and listen to you and then come up with all kinds of reasons to keep you around. How do you know they like you? Unusually touchy. Brushing fingers when handing you a cup or a handheld. Protective, solicitous behavior. Very quick to catch you if you stumble or lose footing, very concerned if youre unwell. Personal distance decreases significantly. Then one day, next thing you know, hes holding your hand and gazing into your eyes, she concluded dreamily. But do you ever kiss? I wanted to ask that really badly. I just smiled instead. She smiled too. And you? Better ask when my assignments formally over, Dr. Mar, I said archly. Then I fell silent, remembering the number of days till then and also the unknown number of days before the Consuls miracle would arrive. Might arrive. When we reached Lanuris office, he greeted me with unexpected warmth, clasping my hand and saying, It is fitting that you should be here for the memorial. What memorial? I asked, confused. He looked slightly concerned. You have not received word? The rescue has been called off. Increased seismic activity in the area has made it impossible for excavation to continue safely. The unopened messages from Fergus, I thought. The room slid slowly to one side, and I was surprised to find that Freyda was gripping me by the shoulders. I shrugged her off. Im all right, I insisted. I took a step and swayed. I just need to sit down for a bit, I amended in a small voice. They were very attentive. They took me to Lanuris residence and made me sit still and drink tea. It was all I could do. My brain simply shut off, refusing to accept any possibility that I would never again hear Lians laugh and Jorals earnest voice. The following day, I was at a Sadiri memorial service or, as I preferred to call it, a funeral for bodies that were very likely still breathing. Two memory trees were planted before the Local Council Hall in a ceremony that was a curious mix of Cygnian and Sadiri traditions, and then the attendees retired to the Hall for a few solemn minutes of awkward interaction. I found it indecent. They could have waited, I said angrily. Nasiha, who didnt even know about the Consuls call for help, also found it unseemly, but she tried to excuse it. The chances of survival are now negligible, she stated, her morose expression suggesting that she disliked the sound of her words even more than I did. Furthermore, the council was of the opinion that delaying the customary rituals would give the event more weight than is warranted. Its the settlements first funeral, I murmured. Yes. And there will be more, in time. That is the point. These young men must learn to face death again. But couldnt they at least have waited till we knew for sure? I demanded. She shrugged. They have no reason to believe in miracles. I do, I said fiercely. There was, however, a limit to the sympathy Nasiha and I could share. Thank God for Freyda Mar, because we exchanged a single glance across the crowded room, made our excuses, then went together to a private corner, fell into each others arms, and wept silently for fifteen minutes or so. How did you know? I asked her when we had both composed ourselves. She smiled ruefully. Lanuri says that when I want a hug but Im afraid to ask for it, I clasp my hands behind my back. Youve been gripping your wrists for the past hour now. I had been trying to avoid even the sight of Dllenahkh, afraid to ask him if he had any news, afraid to glimpse something in his eyes that might destroy my hope, but when she said that, I had a yearning to go find him. He seemed to know I wanted him, because the moment I looked in his direction, he disengaged himself from a knot of grim-faced councillors and came toward me. Delarua, he said abruptly, where are you staying? Dr. Lanuris residence. Im going back to the City with Freyda tomorrow, when shes finished her rounds, I replied. Come back with me now. Okay, I said immediately. On the way there he explained to me what needed to be done. Naraldi does not wish to involve himself directly, nor does he wish the Consulate to be implicated in any way. I have the reassembled comm. He wants you to take it and wait at your apartment. Someone will come to you at the designated time. I looked at him, looked at him properly, and dared to allow myself to feel. When did you sleep last? I asked quietly. He glanced aside in that way he had when he was hesitating to speak the truth. I How many times had we slept in a groundcar on autopilot? Too many times. I touched the controls, darkening the windows and adjusting the seating. Take a nap. We can talk when we get to the City. We lay down side by side. Dllenahkh started to move, hesitated, and then reached out to place his hand gently on the side of my face, reminding me of the time he had helped heal me. Instead of the expected delicate brush, a heavy warmth poured into my brain. It felt like nothing Id experienced with him before. What are you doing? I asked, holding very still. Making sure you wont forget anything, he replied in a near whisper. I would have questioned him further, but before I could, I fell into a deep sleep. And so, the following day, the eighth day after meeting with the Consul, I nervously waited in my apartment, holding the comm in my hand. I didnt know what to expect. Would there be a mundane buzz at my door? Would the heavens open and the earth shake? I knew neither who nor how in this adventure, and the only thing that was keeping me sitting expectantly in my living room was faith. The reality was somewhere between the two extremes of my imagination. First there was a voice, a very ordinary voice except for the fact that it seemed to be coming out of thin air. It said simply, Naraldi sent me. Then I blinkedand there it was. I jumped out of my chair. It was too bizarre to inspire awe. I had never seen a Sadiri mindship in real life, but I knew their look, something like a manta ray, very smooth and dark and naturally designed to slip through any tear in the fabric of space-time. Not only was this like nothing I had imagined, I was sure it was like nothing anyone had imagined. It kept to the oceanic theme, at least, for it resembled the keel of a boat, all carved and sanded wood in the shape of a high, curving bow. But there was no boat, only a tall figure wearing a close-fitting metallic jumpsuit and a helmet, with one hand resting on the wood as if keeping the keel upright. Was there an invisible boat attached? I stared. Oh, good. You didnt scream, or fall down, or run away. The voice was slightly muffled at the beginning, and then the shining helmet was removed to reveal an equally shining face and a wide, white cloud of hair. I quickly revised my interpretation of what I was seeing. I should, I said reproachfully to the gilded stranger. Youre naked. He looked down nervously, then gave me a stern look. Dont scare me like that. I havent lost pubic sphincter control since I was twelve. Oh? I said faintly. A worried expression came over his face. That was a joke. Please dont take me seriously. Pubic sphincter. As if there could be such a thing. He gave a short, awkward laugh, then shut up and looked at me sheepishly. The conversation was getting away from me, getting away from any semblance of common sense, in fact, so I tried to bring it back under control. Im Grace Delarua. How do you do? I said, stepping forward and holding out my hand. The stranger eyed my hand, then looked at me doubtfully. He put his helmet back on, this time with the faceplate open, and reached out to me. Well, if youre sure. It was only in the moment when the brass-bright skin touched mine that it struck me why this would be a bad idea. Too late. The world vanished. I shut my eyes tightly and tried to scream, but it wasnt working. The strangers voice rang clearly in my head, sounding disconcertingly like my own tone and rhythm and idiolect. You can call me Sayr, by the way. I didnt think youd want to travel with me. I just came to get the comm so Id have a point of reference, but this ways good too. Ahhhhh! I finally managed to make some noise. It echoed so loudly that I opened my eyes immediately. There was nothing before me but a pure, rich darkness that made me welcome the solid feel of rock under my feet, because without it I would have imagined myself floating in outer space. Suddenly, a glow appeared to my left, making me jump. Sayrs entire arm had gone luminescent, and he was studying a faint overlay of lines on it. For a bemused instant, I wondered why he was looking at his veins, and then I realized it was a map. So this is where you were when you saw the light come through. Hmm. The terrain has changed quite a bit. Would you like to try calling your friends? I hesitated: one second to understand that I was on the other side of the world, once more underground in the abandoned city; two seconds to wonder whether Sayr was human or machine or both; and one more second to remember and be grateful for Ferguss comm still held tightly in my left hand. I turned it on, fumbled with the lit control panel, and selected Lians ID. Unavailable. Leave a message. It wasnt even Lians voice, just the generic recording. I held the comm out mutely to Sayr. His eyes widened and glittered in the dark, reflecting the glow of the comm display. Ive found them, he said. The comm went dark as the connection cut out, and for a moment I was convinced I was alone in the dark. Then I told myself not to be silly. As if Sayr would leave me alone in a derelict mine with an active volcano rumbling nearby. That would be irresponsible. He was probably in deep thought or something. I tried to be quiet so as not to disturb him. His voice rang out so close, so sudden, that I almost fell down in sheer fright. Sorry I didnt take you, but its easier when there arent any collective memories What? You left me here? I squeaked. It was too much. I immediately began to hyperventilate. Bright sunlight seared my vision, and icy air pricked my skin. I gasped and screwed up my face, but at least the shock put an end to my dry sobbing. When I was finally able to squint my eyes open again, it was to see Sayr standing close to his keel, one hand in the usual rest position on his transport and the other patting me reassuringly on the shoulder. Look, he urged. There they are. Theyre calling Emergency Services now. Everything will be fine. We were on a hill, where exactly I wasnt sure, but it was cold enough that I knew we were still near the polar regions. There were indeed two figures, tiny in the distance, heartwarmingly familiar and blessedly alive. They sat huddled together, arms around each other. I stopped shivering with cold for a moment to shiver with pure joy. I had no more time to be sentimental. In another twinkling of an eye, we were back in my living room. Thanks for the experience. Sorry I cant stay longer. His face went from friendly to serious, and I knew what was coming next. Wait! I wailed. Before you wipe my memory, cant I ask you some questions? A question? Just one question, please? Sayr paused, eyeing me warily as if suspecting me of employing delaying tactics, which might have been partly true. What would be the point if you cant remember the answer anyway? Id have a sense of satisfaction, I said, guessing wildly. That would be enough. Let me hear the question, he said, still wary. I took a deep breath. This was my chance to find out the meaning of life. Is it true that the Caretakers save people who are essential to the human race? The words were rushed and inelegant, but I couldnt risk waiting in case he changed his mind. Fortunately, the query appeared to interest him. Thats a complicated question. It has a complicated answer to go with it. Thats fine, I said encouragingly. I sat down in a chair and raised my hands hopefully, trying to project the image of a supplicant who would be grateful for the merest scrap. His face relaxed, slightly amused at my eagerness. Im going to tell you in such a way that youll remember the answer but not the question or the asking of it. I suppressed a wriggle of excitement that would have been most unbecoming to my mature years. He left the keel standing by itself at the edge of the room, settled himself cross-legged on the floor, and began. In the beginning, God created human beings, which is to say God put the ingredients together, embedded the instructions for building on the template, and put it all into four separate eggs marked Some Assembly Required. One egg was thrown down to Sadira. There humanity grew to revere and develop the powers of the mind. Another egg was sent to Ntshune, and the humans who arose there became adept at dealing with matters of the heart. A third egg arrived at Zhinu, and there the focus was on the body, both natural and man-made. The last egg came to Terra, and these humans were unmatched in spirit. Strong in belief, they developed minds to speculate and debate, hearts to deplore and adore, and bodies to craft and adapt. Such were their minds, hearts, and bodies that they soon began to rival their elder siblings. When the children of God saw the Terrans and their many ways of being human, they were both impressed and appalled. Some declared, See how they combine the four aspects of humanness! Through Terra, all will be transformedSadira, Ntshune, and Zhinuinto one harmonious whole. Others predicted, How can any group survive such fragmentation? They will kill one another, and the rest of humanity will remain forever incomplete. After some discussion, it was decided to seal off Terra from the rest of the galaxy until Terran civilization reached full maturity. It was also decided to periodically save them from themselves by placing endangered Terrans where they could flourish and begin to mix with other humans. He smiled as he concluded, And that, my dear, is five creation myths for the price of one. Are you satisfied? Thats a childs bedtime story, I said, but not too critically, because Id actually enjoyed it. Sayr shrugged. Doesnt make it any less true. Are you a child of God? I asked, keeping my tone light and conversational. He didnt buy it. Arent we all? One question only, my dear. Now, if youll forgive me, this wont take a second. There was a silence. Sayr began to frown. I looked at him anxiously, baffled at his growing irritation. I see youve been memory-protected, Sayr sniffed. This is such a difficult time period to work in. You people know too much already, and you always want to know more. Youll have to come with me. No! I insisted, beginning to panic again. Im home and safe, and Im not going anywhere else with you and thatthing! Frustration edged his voice. Stop hyperventilating. You know I wont force you to come with me. But you leave me with no choice. Im sorry, but Ill have to do it the old-fashioned way. He stood up, glaring at me, but the glare transformed once more into that sheepish expression. Youyou wouldnt happen to have any alcohol handy, would you? I had two bottles. One was a lovely, light, triple-distilled spirit made with honey, spices, and herbs that Id picked up on my travels and was saving for a special occasion. The other was an utterly miserable sherry that someone had given me in one of those office gift exchange things about two years previously. I punished Sayr by making him drink one glass of sherry for every two glasses of spirits he had me guzzle. Unfortunately for my thirst for vengeance, I was only able to force him to endure two glasses. After that, I was hugging the bottle with one arm and holding him with the other, and I was far too cheerful to care when he danced us closer to the keel and got his hand onto it. The room vanished, to be replaced by another, unfamiliar room, dimly lit and exuding the stillness of a workplace in after-hours mode. I stumbled forward, unsupported, my gentle abductor having absconded for parts unknown. To my great relief, there was another body nearby to lean on. Dllenahkh was there to meet me. He greeted me warmlyyes, warmly! I know what the word means! He hugged me! Or helped me stand upright. Maybe. But he was happy! He was practically burning with it. You cant mistake something like that. Then I looked around and was moved to comment. This isnt my apartment, I said indignantly. No, indeed. We are in the Consulate, Dllenahkh replied. Now, why did he? I frowned, trying to think. What happened? I thought this was supposed to end in alcoholic amnesia. The last two words came out a little garbled. I pressed my fingers to my face, trying to wake up the numb patches. We grew concerned when we did not hear from you, so Naraldi contacted Sayr. After Sayr briefed us on the situation, Naraldi advised him that alcohol poisoning was not the best way to approach the problem. I recommended that he bring you here instead as soon as possible. Just put your arm about my waist. There. Now this waynothe other direction This explained the times when Sayr had been muttering grimly to himself. I thought hed merely been cursing the sherry under his breath. But where are we going? I asked after a while. To Central Government Headquarters. The rest of the team will meet us there. What about the Consul? I whispered to him as we navigated the corridors. Id like to see him before we go. Thank him. He is occupied in his office, but I believe he would not mind seeing you, Dllenahkh replied. Try to focus. It will dispel some of the alcohols effects, and you will be able to speak more clearly. I breathed deeply, brought myself under some control just as Nasiha had taught me, and steadied my steps. By the time we reached the corridor to the Consuls office, I was faking sobriety pretty well. Im ready, I declared. Dllenahkh smiled slightly. Take your time. Wait here. He went to a door a few meters away and pressed for admittance. The door opened and stayed open, which is how I got to hear everything. Ah, Dllenahkh. We were just talking about you. All is well? Yes, Naraldi. I contacted Emergency Services, and they were able to confirm that Lian and Joral are both expected to make a full recovery. I am about to depart for Central Government Headquarters to meet with the other members of the mission team, but Ms. Delarua expressed a wish to thank you personally before we go. She is waiting outside. Naraldi immediately came to the door, looking out rather than inviting me in. I stood straight and tried to look professional, discreetly putting my handsand the bottlebehind my back. Your Excellency, I said with a very small, very careful bow. Thank you so much for all your help. He walked toward me, Dllenahkh following close behind. Ms. Delarua. I am glad to see that you have proved yourself more than competent in your post. Thank you for seeking me out and inspiring me to ask something I would not have thought to ask. Fortune favors the audacious, apparently. Dllenahkh came to stand next to me, radiating such an aura of satisfaction that youd have thought the Consuls words had been intended for him. Ms. Delarua has long been an asset to our settlement. Providing insightful solutions to unforeseen problems is a talent of hers. The Consul looked at us steadily, such a look as made me surreptitiously step a little farther away from Dllenahkh, out of his personal space. I see. And this would be why you protect her from mental tampering? To maintain her talents at their peak? He slowly shook his head in mock sorrow, and I realized with a jolt that this was Dllenahkhs Lian, the one person who would always notice when the kohl had been applied and be happy to point it out too. I wish you well, he continued with a smile and nod to each of us, making the pronoun plural. We gave him our good wishes in turn, and then, still emboldened by alcohol, I raised my voice for the silent visitor in the Consuls office. Thank you, Sayr! There was a pause, and then a voice cautiously sang out, Youre welcome! The Consul regarded me with a mixture of amusement and mild reproach. And thank you too, Naraldi, I repeated softly and far more soberly. Im sorry about what happened to Sadira. You helped save two dear friends today. That means a lot to me. He bowed his head, perhaps in farewell, perhaps to hide the fact that his eyes were suddenly shining with tears. Then he went back into the office and closed the door. It was a poignant moment that I spoiled by suddenly smacking my forehead. What is it? asked Dllenahkh in concern. I left Ferguss comm underground, I exclaimed. I looked down regretfully at the bottle in my hand. I hope hell accept some honey spirit instead. Zero hour plus two years twenty days The Regular Meeting of the Sadiri Council on Cygnus Beta had recently concluded. Councillors gathered in the anteroom of the Council Hall, taking refreshment and talking among themselves. They seemed far more relaxed than usual, and Dllenahkh wondered if the gravitas and endless debate of the early days of their founding had been mere posturing to hide a fear of inadequacy. But then again, he thought, relenting, perhaps that was an uncharitable view. After all, there had been a lot of good news of late: Jorals safe return to the settlement, new ties with what were now called the heritage communities, and an increasing number of betrothals and marriages between Sadiri and taSadiri. There was much to celebrate. Congratulations, Naraldi said, appearing at his side with cup in hand. Im glad to see that the council knows how to reward success. Dllenahkh sipped at his drink and grimaced, a reaction that was only partly due to the strength of the tart, sweet cordial. Then why does this reward feel like another task? Perhaps it is, and if so, you have only to succeed again. Look at youyou could be an elder in truth. Now its only a small homestead on a spare bit of council land; in the future it becomes an odd name on a map, the ancient town of Dllenahkh, founded by some obscure civil servant a year or two after the Scattering. Dllenahkh opened his mouth to ask if Naraldi had seen such a thing, realized very quickly that he had absolutely no desire to find out, and changed his question. Will you come visit? You can stay as long as you wish. He held Naraldis gaze slightly longer than would be required for an innocent query. Naraldi narrowed his eyes, understanding. So, you have heard. More than that. I can see the evidence with my own eyes. If it continues, if the Sadiri Government doesnt remove you as Consul, there are going to be some awkward questions asked. We must keep it quiet for now. Perhaps I will simplybounce back to my age before my travels, but the doctors cannot tell me what caused it to begin or how long it will continue. They want me to go to New Sadira to be monitored. Naraldi sighed deeply. It is hard enough being tied to one planet. The debriefing period after my travels was long and arduous, but I had some freedoms. This time I suspect they plan to permanently confine me to a room filled with sensors and scanners. Dont let them, Dllenahkh said abruptly. Youre still a pilot, arent you? Ask for a ship. It was beautiful to see the hope brightening Naraldis face. You think ? And yet, if old age was their only excuse for retiring me, why not? He touched his bare scalp with a smile that was almost shy. I shall have to let my hair grow again. But discreetly, Dllenahkh warned teasingly. Remember, there will be less gray than before. Naraldi looked around, still with that sheepish smile, like a boy expecting to be caught in a prank. I will visit, he proclaimed in a whisper. When they give me a ship, I will come to see you in your new domain. It was clear from his demeanor that he did not mean a common docking in orbit and a mundane transit to the surface. You wouldnt, Dllenahkh whispered back, but it came out sounding more like a dare than an admonishment. Was this age regression contagious? I would, and I will! I have mastered the art of safe, clandestine planetfall. How else do you think I managed during my travels? Dllenahkh was about to answer when a strange sight distracted him. Councillor Haan, one of the more sedate and self-important members of the council, stood nearby, shoulders bent and shaking with silent laughter, tears pouring from the corners of his eyes. Two other councillors beside him were grinning happily, completely unsurprised at this unusual behavior from their colleague. Dllenahkh stared at them, then glared at the liquid in his cup. Fireberry cordial, he guessed. Dont drink any more, Naraldi, its Dllenahkh, youve been away from home for too long. Of course its fireberry. Its almost a tradition after council meetings these days. Theyre better for it, if you ask me. Oh, dont look like that. I forget youre a purist. Here. Naraldi kindly and gently removed the cup from Dllenahkhs hand. Let me take care of that for you.          AN IDEAL HUSBAND Okay, now that all the unpleasantness is over, I can talk to you about something important, Gilda said with hushed excitement. I narrowed my eyes at her with suspicion, took a sip of my cocktail, and waited. So? You. Him. Whats it like? She halted me as I began to open my mouth. And dont you dare say who? or whats what like? or anything so silly. The last reports had been submitted, and the end-of-mission ceremony and reception were finally taking place with all team members present and accounted for. There had been a bit of silly media, like those who wanted to turn Lian and Jorals story into a romantic holo, but once Lian firmly redeclared as gender-neutral and Joral stated that they were merely colleagues, it died down again, leaving the two free to hang out together and assess potential brides for Joral. There had been a bonding experience during that underground adventure, but not the sort the media was hoping for. The other bit of media, which I should have anticipated, depicted me as Dllenahkhs consort in all but name. Faithful companion, close colleague, partner in crimeyou name it. Not lovers, surprisingly. I suppose, since we werent as young and pretty as Joral and Lian, the media wasnt interested in what we got up to in bed. Gilda, on the other hand, was a lot less picky. Its fine, I said with dignity, and meditatively licked a portion of salt from the rim of my glass. But what do you do? Hes soproper. I gave her an exasperated look. It was no good trying to tell Gilda that some people didnt divulge such intimate details, because she always did whether you wanted to hear it or not and expected the same of her friends. Up till now, Id been mercifully exempt by virtue of a boring lifestyle. Eventually I shrugged. We hold hands, I confessed, lowering my voice. Thats all? she said in enormous disappointment. Well, its more complicated than that. A sort of telepathy thing. Oh, and sometimes we sleep together. I should indulge my vengeful streak more often. I timed it perfectly so that she actually inhaled her beverage in shock. You do what? she hissed as soon as she got her airway clear. I relented. Oh, come on, Gilda. Clothes on, adjacent cots, same shelter. Thats all. He told me I help him sleep. It was true. The way the team had been paired up and the fact that Qeturah had her own shelter meant that Id usually had a smaller shelter to myself. My dreams had never completely untangled from Dllenahkhs thoughts, both waking and dreaming, after the memory-reset thing, and he found that I was at least as good as an hours prior meditation for stopping the falling nightmare before it got out of hand. He explained to me that proximity would facilitate the effect and quite calmly asked if he could come discreetly to my shelter for a few hours sleep from time to time. I casually said yes, and it was literally an hour later that I experienced a jaw-drop moment, suddenly realizing what I had agreed to. It didnt take Gilda that long. She slowly shook her head and looked at me as if seeing me for the first time. Man. Still waters. Her gaze flickered, focusing behind me, the slightly guilty expression betraying that it was Dllenahkh approaching. I turned and smiled at him. Councillor? Ms. Delarua, he replied, pausing to nod courteously to Gilda. A moment of your time, if I may. I followed Dllenahkh a few steps away to a clear space, which, as the reception was well attended, meant stepping onto one of the balcony niches of the reception hall. Some journalist snagged a holo of us in conversation, standing framed in the niche with the twilight-colored sky filling the French window behind us. I never even noticed when she took it, but theres a copy of that holo on my desk now. I have a suggestion for you, he began. Your residence in Tlaxce City is no longer appropriately sited for the work you will be doing. My own career changes have rendered the location of my previous lodgings less than optimal. I have, however, been recommended for ownership of a homestead close to transport links to both Tlaxce City and the Local Council Hall. Of course, it is too much for me to handle by myself, but I have in mind an arrangement which may serve as a model for other homesteads in the future. Dr. Mar and Lanuri plan to marry next month. I believe you already know that Nasiha and Tarik will stay on Cygnus Beta for a period of time. Two of my colleagues from the Council offices, Istevel and Kamir, have asked to transfer from government work to homesteading until they are assigned partners by the Ministry, and Joral has requested the same. Would you care to join us? Pardon? I had been so busy cataloging the names and the news that the invitation, tacked on like an afterthought, at first made no sense. Would you like to live with us on the homestead? This would greatly facilitate your consultancy work with Commander Nasiha. I spurred my whirling mind to stop for a moment and think clearly. This homestead, it sounds pretty sizable to be able to support so many people. It is. I pondered. Nasiha, Joral, Tarik, Freydaquite a lot of my favorite people in one place. It sounded pretty cool, especially if the homestead were big enough for a balance of independence and interdependence. I shook my head, laughing inwardly at myself. Working with Sadiri, living with Sadiri, speaking Sadiri more often than notit seemed that in my own life the Sadiri had won the culture wars quite handily. And then, of course, there was Dllenahkh himself. I freely confessed to myself in that moment that he was someone I didnt want to say good-bye to, not ever. It seems to be an efficient arrangement, I decided, looking up at him with a smile. Yes. Thank you, Dllenahkh. Even after I said yes to Dllenahkhs offer to live on his homestead, I had plenty of opportunity to ponder the decision anew. Some days later, as Gilda helped me pack up the last bits of my City life, she filled me in on what people were saying. Some felt Dllenahkh was besotted with me even though I was quite clearly not taSadiri and therefore completely unsuitable as a spouse; others believed I was besotted with him and therefore so desperate to stay near him that I was willing to molder away on a homestead. Some thought he was using me to project the image of a proper Sadiri family man, homesteader, and government representative; others were convinced I was using him to further my own private-sector career and gradually rehabilitate myself in the government and the scientific community. Finally, one rumor all but accused us of conducting an elaborate xenofetish experiment that would only end in tears. To the general concerns, I could have added several more. Was he attached to me because of the mission experience? Did that mental connection that I couldnt speak about and my helping him with his nightmares constitute some kind of undue influence? If so, would the influence fade as soon as he was once more in a full Sadiri community with all the telepathic support that entailed? Oh, shut up, Gilda, I said irritably. Youd think I was going to marry the man, with all that talk. She looked hurt, but before she could complain, there was a chime at the front door, and I gladly went to answer it. Excuse me. Ms. Grace Delarua? It was a government courier with one of those buff envelopes that had so often been the bane of my life. They tended to represent upheaval at the best and misery at the worst. I felt a pang of fear. Whats this? I said, taking it unwillingly. Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance. Sign here, please. I signed for it and closed the door, relieved but confused. Family Planning? said Gilda with an arched brow. I registered. It was a whim, I said. I had indeed registered, about three months back when we were in a fairly well-connected town. Nasiha had complimented my meditation progress that day, and Dllenahkh had also made some very favorable remarks concerning a report Id produced in both Sadiri and Standard. For some reason, the resulting heady rush of pride had led me to do all manner of things to prove to myself that I was definitely one hundred percent fine in all areas of my life. Then why dont they just contact you via comm or handheld? Open it! she demanded. Curiosity overcame prudence, and I opened it in her presence, laying the official document flat on the dining table. We stared at it. She swore softly, then laughed out loud. I said nothing. Well? she pressed. I put it back in the envelope. Come on, lets finish packing. I need to get down to the homestead as soon as possible. Even with nav and autopilot, the groundcar made it down to the homestead within about two hours, which was not long enough for my blood to cool. After the car passed the main gates but well before it reached the residences, I saw something in a field that made me put on the brakes. It was the first time Id seen them, but it was easy to guess what they were: Sadiri dogs. There were three of them, slightly bigger and thicker-bodied than the wild savanna dog, still adapted for a heavier gravity than ours. It was evident in the way they leaped and raced, testing their new strength and speed. Three men were with them, at times running alongside them, at times standing still and observing closely. I thought they were playing with them, and then I realized they were training themwithout leash, whip, or biscuit. There was also a small group of horses fenced off in a paddock at one end of the field. As I watched them, one of the men put his dog to stay and walked toward the paddock. The horses moved skittishly away, but one of them paused and sidled to the fence, quite possibly coaxed by some silent encouragement. The man gently put a hand to the horses shoulder and began stroking its nose reassuringly. The horse was calm and content, but suddenly the dog came trotting forward, making the horse startle, throw up its head, and scamper off. Unfortunately, the would-be horse whisperer was too close and got a faceful of hard horse skull that rocked him off his feet and onto his backside. The dog nuzzled him solicitously while his two colleagues unhelpfully burst out in loud laughter. Good day. You are Ms. Grace Delarua? A young man peered into the passenger window of the car, leaning forward with a diffident curiosity that reminded me of Joral. He was dressed for rough, dusty work in trousers and shirt made of thick cotton twill. A canvas bag rode over his shoulder, clinking occasionally as he moved. I turned off the humming engine of the groundcar, surprised that I had not heard anyone approaching. Yes, I am. Good day. He bowed politely in greeting. I am Kamir. I see you have noticed the animal trainers at work. Those are our new dogs, a small stock that we will eventually crossbreed with the local savanna dogs. There was both pride and excitement in his voice. I thought they were restricted to New Sadira, I said. Policies have changed. Hybridization is popular now. His words sounded slightly teasing to my sensitive ears. I narrowed my eyes at him. Where is Dllenahkh? He straightened and pointed down the road. Approximately five hundred meters farther along the road, working at the smithy with Istevel. Thank you, I said, making an effort at courtesy as I restarted the car. Enjoy the rest of your day. The smithy was easy to find, a long, low building with the distinctive dish-shaped structure of a solar forge looming over it. Broad double doors stood half open to the breeze, showing two figures within. One man was holding something in a pair of tongs, moving it slowly back and forth under a beam of concentrated sunlight. Another man stood nearby, seemingly content to merely examine his colleagues technique. Their reflective face shields reminded me of Sayrs helmet, but everything else was low-impact, easy-maintenance technology that emphasized self-sufficiency. I hesitated. Theres something very poetic and pastoral about men working at a forgealbeit a solar forgeand on another day I would have appreciated the scene, but I reminded myself that there were more important matters to be dealt with. I turned off the car, grabbed the envelope, and made for the two smiths. I nodded to the working smith first, then focused my attention on the other. You are the most indirect man I have ever met, I snapped. Dllenahkh pushed up the visor of his face shield and squinted at me. I do not understand. I impatiently waved the official document at him. Ah. He nodded to Istevel, stripped off his fireproof gloves, took off his face shield, and approached me cautiously. Perhaps we should go elsewhere to discuss this. We walked about a hundred meters away to where the ground sloped under the shade of a few small trees. I sat down, carefully looking straight ahead. There was a faint rustle of leaf and dried grass as Dllenahkh seated himself beside me. May I? he asked, and took the document from my hand. I sneaked a look at him. Taking off the face shield had ruffled his hair into a slightly untidy tumble of sun-lightened brown locks. His skin had darkened after the years break from office work. With a start, I realized that he now looked far more Cygnian than Sadiri. He examined the document. The Ministry is informing you that my application to be registered as your life partner has been approved. Our signatures and the signature of a witness are all that is needed to complete the process. I know that. I sounded a little frantic, so I made myself repeat the words calmly. I know that. But how is this possible? The only way I could get this kind of document is if you registered before me and put me down as your sole preference. And at the very least I should have received some prior notification My voice faded. I remembered a time when any government correspondence appearing on my handheld had been rapidly consigned to the bin after a cursory look. Id received a lot of irrelevant notices in the days when the left hand of Central Government was still processing my resignation and hadnt bothered to inform the right hand. Dllenahkh merely blinked once as he watched my face change, but the amount of amusement he managed to convey was astonishing. I am only surprised that they took so long. I understand that the testing is highly intensive, consisting of genetic profiling, psychiatric assessments, and financial auditing. However, due to the nature of our work, all of the data was readily available. Youbooked me in advance? I was stunned. He looked at my expression, parted his lips to speak, and paused. Go on, I said resignedly. You can tell me anything; you know that. I have certain responsibilities, he began tentatively, a man feeling his way on unexpectedly treacherous ground. Not only as a councillor of the settlement but also as a Sadiri, one of few remaining. I turned toward him slightly, listening. Thus, it is extremely important that my actions are beneficial not only to myself but to the Sadiri people as a whole. Understood, I replied. He looked at me closely. I have tried to set an example. Careful and deliberate choice of a spouse, with objective assessment by a qualified, neutral third party, is precisely what the young Sadiri of this community need to see. Wellcongratulations, I said awkwardly. It was difficult to be angry at him yet impossible to be pleased about the situation. He sighed. I do not know how to do this. I know I have displeased you in some way, but I am unable to ascertain how. I spoke honestly if impulsively. I suppose its no secret that Im fond of you, Dllenahkh, but whether that matters to you at all, I justngh! In a swift move that shocked me speechless, he set his hand behind my head and put his face into the side of my neck. He left the imprint of his teeth there, then soothed the skin with the tip of his tongue. It was a fraction more than a kiss and a little short of a marking. His hair brushed the lashes at the corner of my eye; there was the slight abrasion of his shadowed jaw against my cheek. He was tender and brutal, and I had no defense against him. Mmm, I said, completely incoherent. I am relieved to hear, he whispered under my ear, that you are fond of me. It matters to me a great deal. Dont tell me you didnt know it, I said shakily. He rested his forehead against mine and spoke temptingly near my mouth. It would not have been right to tell you before you told yourself. I might have listened, I protested weakly, focusing with difficulty on his lips and wondering if he could be slowly trained to find mouth-to-mouth kissing acceptableenjoyable, even. He drew back and gazed at me. You know I will not give you emotional protestations, he said, and his eyes seemed troubled. Then tell me what you will give me, I said. Trust. Companionship. His eyelids lowered, and his voice grew husky. Children, if you wish. Will you consent to be my wife? I cannot imagine being better suited to any other person. Me? I laughed softly. Undisciplined, emotional me? Id rather not do without you, but I wont be a burden to you, and I cant change my nature. Nor I, he replied, but if the past two years are any indication, we have had some success at meeting each other halfway. Thenyes. His gaze grew tender. I believe the arrangement will be mutually Satisfactory, I interrupted. Beneficial, infuriating, passionateIm sorry, did I hit a sensitive spot there? I had grown courageous enough to touch him, and my hands light passage over his side appeared to be causing him some problems if the hitch in his breathing was any indication. There is something you must know before we proceed, he said, capturing my hand. I am aware that many Ntshune societies and a few Cygnian ones practice short-term monogamy. This is not the Sadiri way. Dont worry; its not the Cygnian homesteader way either, I said. And they wouldnt have matched us if we didnt agree on that. I know. But, Grace, what I am asking is this: Do you want a Cygnian marriage or a Sadiri marriage? I silently questioned him with a puzzled frown. He let go of my hand and looked into the distance as he tried to explain. We have a need to form a meaningful telepathic bond with something or someone. There is a Sadiri saying: a man with a mindship is half immortal, but a man without a wife is half alive. Some men can overcome this need by using meditation techniques, but never before have so many men faced a future without hope of marriage. They had no choice but to send us away from New Sadira. There were terrible incidentsmen fighting over women, assaulting women, harming themselves, even threatening mass suicide. Our society was breaking down. I saw such thingsthings I still cannot speak of. He gripped his wrist, a sign of distress I knew too well. Then dont speak of them, I hushed him. Not yet. Not till youre ready. Never, if it comes to that. He spoke very quietly, still not looking at me. I have relied on meditation for many years, and I can continue to do so for many more, but I ask you now: Will you bond with me? I leaned against him, feeling the tension in his body subside. I said yes, and Ill say it again. You know I trust you. He took my hand and pressed it to his cheek. I closed my eyes and felt a surge of energy pushing from him to me and back again, very like the warmth and reassurance of a rocking hug. At last, calmed and consoled, we moved away from each other. He returned the document to its envelope and handed it to me. We will speak more on this later, after you have rested and settled in. He left to return to the smithy. I lay back on the grass for a few minutes, mind blown. La, sir, this is so very sudden! And yetit wasnt, was it? Wed already moved beyond the baseline Sadiri courting rituals identified by Freyda. I knew we had been heading toward a declaration of sorts. I suppose I thought that the declaration would be multistage, perhaps an I love you followed by a Do you love me? rather than a Here, sign this document thatll say were married. But dithering wasnt a Sadiri habit, and neither were I love yous. I heaved a huge sigh and sat up straight. I needed a drink. By happy chance, so did Freyda. First I bullied her into helping me get my stuff into my rooms, and then we took a well-deserved break in her sitting room. She had already completed her own move-in, and as I complimented her taste, she looked around at the decor and furniture with contentment. Im so glad Lanuri went along with my plan to move early and get things organized before our wedding, she said. I made it sound as if it was the obvious thing for me to do now that theres a new biotechnician in place and Im free to start my book, but I think he knows my real motive. And whats that? I asked, making myself comfortable against the cushions as she poured the wine. Im hiding, she confessed in a semiwhisper. From Zhera. I rolled the name through my brain a few times. Isnt she one of the female elders who arrived recently? She seems to be the head of them, and shes terrifying. I thought they were supposed to be cuddly grandma and auntie surrogates for the settlements young men. She seems to think its her job to whip all the new wives and fiances into shape. I saw her systematically interviewing a group of them at the Council Hall offices. Some came out in tears. Well, as long as she doesnt second-guess the Ministry, I said. I suppose she wants to stamp her authority on the community from the start. Oh, and speaking of fiances Freyda was overjoyed at my news but not in the least surprised. Finally! Did you sign it? I grinned, feeling a bit bashful but very pleased at her reaction. Well, not there on the spot, naturally, but I will. After you guys. Dont want to steal your thunder and all. She waved a hand dismissively. You and Dllenahkh were inevitable. Lanuris considered you all but bonded for ages. Hmm. So has Nasiha, I said wryly, taking a sip of wine. Are Sadiri suitors too subtle for us, do you think? I think its the lack of drama. Once theyve got things figured out, they simply go forward without making a fuss. I sat still for a while, heedlessly letting the chilled wineglass warm in my hands and drip condensation onto my lap. I remembered when I first read Dllenahkhs thoughts in my dreams. He had been trying, I think, to figure out how to signal his desire to move from friends to something more. I wondered if that had been when hed booked me. Cheeky of him to assume Id say yesand yet he knew my mind so well that hed probably been right to think in terms of when rather than if. Well, then, said Freyda, eyes gleaming wickedly over the rim of her glass, now that were in the same boat, lets talk about how much of our privacy were willing to give up. What? I asked, confused. She gave me a worried look. Hasnt Dllenahkh spoken to you about that? My God, Delarua, dont you know? You mean the telepathic bond thing? I said, clueing in at last. Yes, I mean the telepathic bond thing, Freyda said in amazement at my unfazed attitude. Yes, of course I know about it. Why are you looking so worried? Freyda set down her glass and leaned forward. Are you sure he told you everything about it? Yes, I said, beginning to grow irritated. He said Sadiri men have a need to form meaningful telepathic bonds. He certainly didnt give me the impression that meant having no private thoughts whatsoever. I realized even as I spoke that he had said we will speak more on this later, but I was too embarrassed to admit to that now. Well, there is some choice about how deep the bond goes, but considering what Dllenahkhs wife did to him I spewed a mouthful of wine half through my nose and half through my mouth. Im sure it was as unpleasant to observe as it was to experience. His wife? I wheezed. Oh, shit, said Freyda. She grabbed a double handful of napkins from the table and pressed them on me. I cleaned myself up, glaring at her, but she avoided my eyes as she babbled, Im so sorry. II think Ill let Dllenahkh tell you about that. No, youre going to tell me. Now, I said grimly. She hesitated, but then she folded her hands together and looked at me with an earnest expression of sympathy and concern. You know most of them have marriages arranged for them when theyre fairly young, right? I grew impatient. Yes, of course. But he never mentioned a wife. She died in the disaster, like so many others. But even before that, they were separated. Separated? What does that mean for Sadiri? I demanded. He said they didnt do temporary monogamy. They dont, Freyda confirmed. Thats why it was such a big deal when the marriage and the bond were dissolved. I breathed out slowly. Oh. Oh, poor Dllenahkh. So he was divorced is what youre telling me. Freyda looked uncomfortable. There was a bit more to it than that. You see, bonded Sadiri men can be possessivevery possessive. Dllenahkh found out his wife was unfaithful to him. He beat the other man senseless. What? I gaped at her in disbelief. She had to be making it up. It sounded like a bad, sordid holovid. Broke his jaw, Freyda said bluntly. He was never charged for it. The Sadiri have different rules for a crime of passion. Its treated like a kind of temporary insanity. When he came to his senses, he told her he was releasing her from their bond. Oh, I said, unable to find words. Im sorry Im telling you this. Obviously he doesnt like to talk about it, and ordinarily I wouldnt have found out except that Lanuri told me. I think he was trying to be completely honest with me so I could objectively assess the pros and cons of a close bond. She hung her head and glared at her wineglass. It didnt work. Im even less objective about it now. Its going to be lots of fun trying to look him in the eye now that I know this, I muttered. Why didnt he tell me? Its not an easy thing to tell, she reasoned. Please, please dont let on that I told you. I feel terrible about this. Ill pretend I never heard a thing, I said miserably. Pretense did work for a little while. There was so much to do in those early days on the homestead that there was no time to revisit the bonding issue with Dllenahkh. That was my excuse, a good excuse and an honest one, but eventually fate took matters out of my hands. Dllenahkh continued to train others in the mental disciplines, and there was a meditation hall on the homestead for that purpose. I didnt use it myself. I could meditate just fine in my own room, and there was also a meditation room in the main house. But I did pass by it on occasion, and once I was walking with Freyda when we heard the sound of a voice raised in anger. We exchanged puzzled looks, then naturally drifted closer to listen to what was going on. withhold more than you teach! You are only concerned about your own status and power in this community. I withhold nothing, Dllenahkhs voice returned calmly. I can only say that reliance on meditation alone is inadvisable. And yet you managed for decades. You succeeded. Why not another? It was never intended as a permanent solution to solitude, as you are attempting to make it. The Ministry can help you select an appropriate spouse, and there are also chemical suppressants available to ease the pain of your loss. I recommend that you choose some remedy, and quickly. There was a crash, and Freyda and I instinctively grabbed each other and cowered. It was a very good thing we hadnt been standing right in front of the window or we would have been hit by the heavy wooden bench that came through. We did get covered in slivers of glass. Then we heard people scuffling inside the hall. Peeking through the broken shutters, we saw the beginnings of a fight. Dllenahkh was trying to restrain rather than injure, but his student seemed quite serious about doing some harm. The other students hovered uncertainly, mainly getting themselves and the furniture out of the way but otherwise looking on anxiously, waiting to be told what to do. I instinctively surged forward, but Freyda caught hold of me. Are you mad? she demanded. You cant go in there! She was right. Dllenahkh ducked a blow, and his antagonists fist left a sizable crack in the paneling of the wall. With a firm hold and a quick pivot, Dllenahkh brought him down to the wooden floor with a booming crash. Two students quickly piled on, keeping him pinned with their weight, while Dllenahkh put one hand to his forehead and the other around his neck, squeezing with careful timing until he slumped into unconsciousness. Take him to the main house, he ordered, not even out of breath. Class is dismissed for today. Then he looked at the ruined window and saw us. His eyes went wide. Are you hurt? No, I said, brushing a tiny smear of blood from my wrist. He saw it and frowned. Honestly, were fine, Freyda insisted. Go deal withwhatever it is you have to deal with. Well get this cleaned up. He looked like he wanted to say more, but instead he nodded, still frowning, and followed his students out of the hall. Freyda turned to me, and her face changed. Are you sure youre all right? I didnt know what to answer. Id accepted Sadiri strength in a be a dear and shift the groundcar out of this trench for me kind of way, but it was the first time I had seen a Sadiri in full, uncontrolled rage. Freydas story came back to my mind with a new vividness, as did Dllenahkhs somber reminiscences about how the men had behaved after the disaster. Worse yet, I had been willing to view Dllenahkhs account of events in the context of the severe trauma that all Sadiri had experienced, knowing too well how their telepathy made them susceptible to collective anger and pain. But what of Dllenahkhs own loss of control, years and years before, in a sane and stable society where women were not a scarce commodity? It was appalling to contemplate. Freyda guessed at the train of my thoughts and began to babble apologies again. Ill be okay, I said. Really. Lets go inside and get this glass out of our hair.  That night, I dreamed of elephants stampeding. I woke up suddenly in the dark, disoriented at first, then feelingknowingthat something wasnt right. I put on a robe and went barefoot up the stairs to the roof terrace. It was a clear, starry night but cool enough that the wooden flooring was already drenched with dew. A shadowy figure was lying atop the broad wall: Dllenahkh, not yet dressed for bed, wide awake and staring up at the sky with no regard for the four-meter drop below. I walked right up to him and looked down, frowning. Why are you still up? I asked him. His eyes softened; he blinked, and some of the tension left his face. Still, he did not look at me but kept his gaze on the stars. I did not want to disturb you, he answered. I knew he had some inkling of my nightmare. I knew he had sensed fear and tension and all manner of things that I had never associated with him before. But this was Dllenahkh. He would never push me for explanations, only wait with patience and openness until I was ready to come to him. I decided to be blunt. What I saw today scared me. You see, someone told mequite by accidentabout your first marriage. There was silence for a while. Then he began to speak slowly, choosing his words with care. I believe I was at fault. I took our mental bond for granted and was often not physically present. In addition to my career, I was very much focused on my studies of the mind, an interest that my wife did not share. One day, during a meditation session, I attainednoglimpsed the state that our mindship pilots regularly experience. Before that day, I had viewed their vocation as a lofty but lonely endeavor. Afterward, I understood why they are called half immortal. ItI cannot describe it, what it felt like, how it changed me. I was a man struck by lightninga benign, sentient lightning. I wrote poetry. I laughed. I told every pilot I met, and they smiled indulgently and said what a pity it was that I was not free to be bonded to my own mindship. I could not change my life. Becoming a pilot would have meant making a different decision when I came of age, and there had been no mindship pilots in my line to inspire me to choose that path. I had to content myself with what I had, and yet I could not let go of what I had seen. I studied further and became advanced in meditation theory and practice. I considered this an admirable endeavor. She took it as evidence that I was arranging my life to exclude her. She could have told me that she wished to marry another. I would not have welcomed it, but I would never have stood in her way. Instead, she purposely hid it from me, arranged for me to discover them together, and stepped back to view the result. Oh, I breathed. Oh, cruel. Yes, as cruel as she believed I had been to her. In the years after our separation, I immersed myself in even deeper study of the disciplines, looking for ways to ensure that such a thing could never happen to me again. In spite of all that had occurred, I still yearned for a bond with another human mind, but if it had not been for the destruction of Sadira, I might have easily persuaded myself to become a pilot. Why didnt you tell me all this, Dllenahkh? I said faintly. His mouth tensed. I should have. I would have in time. There was a small pause, and then he admitted, I feared losing you. Well, Im here now, I pointed out. He turned his head to look at me then. You are. I do not understand why. Think, Dllenahkh, I chided him. Clearly something about you convinces me that you are the best possible choice. And what is that? he asked very softly. I sighed. So many things, but the first on my list right now is that I do believe you love me. I know you are capable of living without that emotion, but you choose not to. I would not classify love as an emotion, Grace. That startled me. Really? Certainly it comes attended by various physical reactions which manifest as emotions, but it is one of the drives. Oh, I said. Like hunger, or wanting to procreate, or the desire to protect ones offspring. Yes. I have identified you as the most appropriate mate, probably through an unconscious assessment of pheromones, mental capacity, and, of course, social compatibility. So, youre saying you like how I smell, you like how I think, and you like to hang out with me? I was amused but genuinely warmed at such a unique declaration of love. He sat up suddenly and turned to face me, swinging his feet down to the floor so quickly that I was half afraid hed go over the edge. What is love to you, Grace? There was an intensity to his gaze that made the blood rush to my face. I began to stammer something, then fell silent. Breathing quickly, I took hold of his hand, bringing it to my cheek. You tell me, I whispered. He drew me into his arms and into his mind. He saw how I valued his selflessness and trusted his integrity even when he exasperated me by being inflexible. I showed him my admiration for his physical strength, intelligence, and psionic abilities and the gentleness that complemented all those qualities. I even allowed him to see that I had found him physically attractive from the moment we first met. So, he said lightly, and I knew he was teasing me because he was somewhat shaken. You believe that I possess certain characteristics that you would like to be passed on, via genetic transfer and mentoring, to your children. I began to laugh. I am surprised at the strength of your appreciation for my shoulders, he continued, still teasing, still holding me close, fitting me neatly between his knees. Theyre nice and broad, I said, running my hands over them to emphasize my point. Nor was I previously aware that you had any special regard for my eyes. Deep, dark, and intense. They make you look almost Ntshune, I murmured, cuddling closer as his hands stroked my back. I apologize for not being honest with you earlier, he said, his voice low and soft so I could feel it rumbling in his chest. And Im sorry for even dreaming that youd ever hurt me. I wont abandon you, Dllenahkh. Invincible or vulnerable, whatever state youre in, youre stuck with me. He tightened his arms around me. A fact that gives me great satisfaction. He sighed as he slowly brushed his nose up the side of my neck and breathed heat under my ear. Theres justone thing, I said hoarsely, trying not to become completely distracted. You mentioned pheromones. Theres another way to assess chemistry. Taste and smell are, as you know, closely linked. He pulled back slightly and gave me a wary look. I believe you are trying to entice me to attempt kissing. Maybe, I said casually. Just one? Please? He gave a gentle, tolerant smile and closed his eyes. I am in your hands. I didnt want to shock him or put him off, so I started with small, chaste kisses pressed firmly to his jaw. Then I quickly, lightly touched my lips to his mouth, very much a drive-by kiss, and paused to assess his reaction. His hands twitched on my back, but he did not pull away. Again, he said softly. I am beginning to see the value of the practice. I obeyed, this time allowing a tiny bit of tingling gold to breathe from my lips to his, just as he had taught me to do from palm to palm. He leaned in to capture it with an appreciative murmur, added a little more of his own, and kissed it back to me. The physical mechanics were still inexpert, but his energy curled in boldly and unraveled right down to my toes, making me gasp at the sensation. I am not averse to including this option in our repertoire, he mused. But I clearly require more practice. Again, please. Reader, I married him. Aboutoh, three times, I think. First there was the signing of the Ministry document, which we did on our homestead with Qeturah as witness and a few close friends around. Then my semilapsed Bahai mother insisted on a Bahai wedding ceremony. I warned her that I was well past the age laid down by the Ministry for mandatory parental permission, but to my surprise and secret pleasure, Dllenahkh was quite taken with the idea. We held it on the banks of Tlaxce Lake, with more of our City friends in attendance and even a few from the other provinces. Dllenahkh presented my mother with the nonobligatory bride price of a quantity of pure gold, which hed had fashioned into the shape of a hummingbird. She loved it. She told me, Of course Im leaving it to you in my will, but its such a nice gesture. It shows he really treasures you. The third time was a secret. We went to the forest uplands, to a certain temple, and there we were bonded by law, by religion, and by mind in a silent ceremony with a few physically attending and hundreds more mentally present. I dont want to say too much about that, sorry. Not secret but far too close to my heart, I think. I get a bit teary just remembering it. Deep breath! Moving on! We did have one dramatic event, something rather akin to a speak now or forever hold your peace moment. I should have guessed that in time, what with all the bride interviews, the infamous Zhera would have come across a woman from the temple and extracted her secrets using nothing but the sheer force of her presence. Or, to speak more charitably, they had likely recognized her worth and extended an invitation to her. Whatever the reason, she showed up at the end of our wedding ceremony, richly robed and closely attended by two young nuns as if she already owned the place. Her glare called to mind the evil fairy who gets vexed at being left out of the royal christening and decides to lay down a curse that will afflict not only the poor innocent babe but the entire kingdom as well. So, Dllenahkh, thou hast bonded again. She spoke a very old and stylized form of Sadiri that hinted at too many hours spent reciting rituals with subordinates and too few minutes engaged in normal conversation with peers. I have, Zhera, he replied courteously but briefly. Thy choice of spouse seemsunwise. I seethed quietly but said nothing. She might think herself qualified to sit in judgment over the young ones of the settlement, but as a grown woman I wasnt going to put up with any nonsense. While I struggled to keep my cool, Dllenahkh calmly defended himself. I would not call it unwise to marry a woman who is capable of strong euphoric projection. Still striving for control but now for an entirely different reason, I wondered how he managed to sound so bland and yet so insinuating. Zhera, to my continuing astonishment, did not frown or show any kind of disapproval. Her stern look gentled to one of mild amusement, and the straight line of her mouth relaxed. Irreverent youth! I did not think to live to see thee considered an elder of our people, but thou hast done well. Child! That last was addressed to me. I tried not to flinch. Maam? He is a good man, a dependable man, but when he tends to frivolity, and she glared at Dllenahkh, as he has in the past, thou must not encourage him. Yes, maam. I mean, no, maam. Whatever you say, maam, I gasped, not so much overwhelmed by her command as utterly flabbergasted at the sudden realization that he had baited her and she was teasing him. When she swept out again, I turned to him, eyebrows raised in amazement. Friend of yours? He smiled slightly. It is difficult to ascertain what that word means to Zhera. To me, she is a teacher of note from whom I learned much about the philosophy and science of the mind. To her, I am still the young acolyte who was sufficiently foolhardy to answer back once. She has never allowed me to forget it. Why did you tell her about the euphoric projection? I complained. That was embarrassing. He raised an eyebrow. Was the statement inaccurate? Well, strictly speaking, no, but you certainly gave the impression that you had already experienced such a thingconjugally. He pondered for a while. I see. Perhaps not an untruth but certainly a misleading statement. I believe there is only one remedy. I looked at him in trepidation, wondering if he was going to speak up and make another public announcement about my alleged abilities. We must investigate thoroughly the potential truth of this statement. Um, I said, because although the words were quite innocently delivered, the look he was giving me was making my knees weak. Yes. That would be entirely appropriate. Might I recommend that we retire to our assigned chamber? The shielding built into the walls will ensure that no acoustic or mental noise will get inor out. I was quite sure at this point that my bosom was heaving in maidenly confusion. Um, that sounds lovely. He looked at me curiously and rested a finger lightly against the throbbing pulse in my throat. You are agitated, he said with grave interest. You are amused at my agitation, I countered. He inclined his head, acknowledging the touch. I am experiencing a measure of excitement combined with increasing pleasure, which is perhaps manifesting as an expression of amusement. It was the first time he had ever used the scales to describe his emotions. I love it when you talk dirty, I whispered, and sealed the moment with a kiss. Now It was well before dawn, and Delarua was scrambling around in semidarkness, wrestling with her clothes and tripping over her own boots. Already dressed, Dllenahkh observed her from his seat at the one clear corner of the bed. Hurry. Well be late. As usual, she caught the meaning rather than the syntax. In a minute! As usual, he listened to the undertone of apology rather than the tone of frustration. He glanced away to signal his patience and saw her handheld in the middle of the bed. He did not intend to read it, but his attention was caught by the title: The Homestead Years. Being the second volume of the draft memoirs of Grace Delarua (not famous yet though not through lack of trying, but hey, theres still time). Dont look! She yanked it out of his line of sight and stuffed it in her satchel. My apologies, he said. He doubted it contained anything that would surprise him, but with Delarua close bonding meant games of fake privacy and pretended ignorance. He found it oddly endearing. Ready, she said breathlessly at last. But I still dont see why we cant go in the car. The car has nav installed, he hinted with a raised eyebrow. We neither need nor want nav where were going. She raised an eyebrow in turn, intrigued. Lead the way, then. By the time they got the horses saddled up, a faint dawn light was beginning to glow. A few minutes easy walk was sufficient to take them out from under the trees at the heart of the homestead, through the outer pastures, and onto the main road. They journeyed for a while along their own boundary line in a silence that was companionable and more. Delarua spoke only once. Were going down to the sea. Yes, he answered aloud. She laughed. It was an adventure to her, an adventure and a mystery all wrapped up in anticipation. She radiated a warm, pleasant buzz, and several vivid pictures suddenly flickered through her mind. He thought for a moment, understood, and smiled at the compliment. She had imagined her mind would be bare before his, naked under a scorching desert sun, with neither shelter nor refuge. Instead, it was like playing hide-and-seek in the light and shadow of a forest, discovering and inventing a new language of double meaning, subtlety, poetry, and image. As a linguist, she was captivated; as a lover, she was enraptured. Nothing could be said the same way twice. Their destination, a small bay earmarked for future Council development, was all sand and dry, unpopulated scrubland yet perfectly suited to the purpose. Pale, shallow water stretched for hundreds of meters up to the line where it met abruptly with depths of dark blue ocean. Dllenahkh scanned the darker colors carefully and sighed with relief. They were too late to witness the splashdown but in time for everything else. He dismounted, held the reins securely, and watched the horizon. After briefly eyeing him with curiosity, Delarua did the same. Dllenahkhs horse sidestepped nervously. He reassured it with a brief mental touch. Whatwhat is that? Delarua gasped. A hectare of distant ocean was shifting. Solid grayness gradually emerged, surging up like a wave, but slowly, so slowly that barely a ripple chased over the waters surface to the beach. Its center was stiff, ridged, and ponderous, but the edges curled and fanned delicately with exquisite control. Is it ? she whispered softly, her mind a racket of thoughts and emotions. Yes, he confirmed. Small, unharnessed, unladen, but unmistakable. An aperture like a blowhole appeared on the back of the leviathan. Only then did its size become clear as a tiny human creature was ejected in a gentle rush of water to tumble over the side and into the ocean. Eyeless yet aware, the beast carefully washed its living cargo to shore with a lazy flap of its foremost fringe. Delarua kept her eyes fixed in fascination on the small dot traveling inland. Dllenahkh also watched until he sensed some other movement, another shifting patch of gray amid the blue that made him startle and starebut the sea calmed and kept its secret. No longer old but not yet young, Naraldi stepped out of the gentle surf, shaking salt water from his hair. It was just long enough to trouble his eyes, drenched-dark in hue with a few white streaks gleaming bright. His pilot suit flashed in the sun, bringing an image of Sayr to Delaruas thoughts. She laughed out loud in sheer happiness, remembering, knowing. Dllenahkh! Grace! Naraldi hailed them gladly. Have you any space in your realm for a rootless wanderer? Dllenahkh felt a sensation of overwhelming, devastating dj vuanother time, another beach, Naraldi rising up out of the ocean to destroy the universe with a few words. His mind had been punctured in that instant, leaving behind a fragmented, perilous memory that could spin him into endless orbit around nothingness. For his own sake, he had learned to forget that day. Now his mind fractured again to take in the reality that he was standing by the sea and hearing Naraldis voice, not merely without desolation but with actual gladness. Memory and moment combined violently, and he struggled to shield Delarua from the sudden maelstrom. She did not look at him. She did not have to. She took firm hold of his hand and silently gave him her storm of joy to navigate instead. Welcome, Naraldi! she cried. Welcome home!
