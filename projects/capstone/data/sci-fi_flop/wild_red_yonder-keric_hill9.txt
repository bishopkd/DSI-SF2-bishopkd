Jeff looked up in surprise."Dont worry," Chuck said, "I wont talk about it around the others, but I just want to know what you really think.""I dont know," Jeff said, "But we can't give up, or well always be wondering if we could have saved him with a little more effort.""I guess youre right," Chuck said, "But Im so tired, Im ready to give up."They both turned to hear Joe shout something in the distance.They headed toward the call and eventually met up with Joe, who took them to a large flat rock.There was a hole under one side of it about three feet across.Joe pointed inside."Ive been down there.Its a tunnel that goes down at a slant and its cool down inside there," Joe said."How far does it go?"Jeff asked."About twenty feet," Joe said, "Why dont we put Frank in there to rest?""Okay," Jeff answered, and then pointed at something Joe was holding, "Whats that?"Joe held it up.It was six inches of a blue tipped chimera tail."Its a souvenir," Joe said, and then jammed it in the pocket of his Purple Man coveralls."Oh," Jeff said wearily, "Lets get Frank."Soon they had helped Frank get to the hole and helped him to the end of the tunnel and got him comfortable.The chimera tail kept falling out of Joes pocket as he struggled to turn around inside the tunnel, so he put it next to Frank."Maybe it will give you good luck," he said quietly and then crawled out.The men kept searching around in the battlefield and eventually found some tracks leading away down the valley."I bet the chimeras that made those tracks are carrying Sam with them," Jeff said."Lets get Frank and follow them."They were walking back towards the tunnel when suddenly a loud hiss exploded in their ears.The men jumped in the air in fright.A chimera was right in front of them.They hadnt seen it at first because its scales blended into the background rocks.It was one of the big Blue tips with its mouth wide and menacing.Jeff held out his hand to motion to Joe and Chuck to back up.They inched backwards as slowly and smoothly as possible.Joe could see the opening to Franks tunnel several yards behind the chimera.To his horror, he noticed another chimera by the opening.The chimera by the tunnel turned its head around and then headed down inside the tunnel."Frank!"Joe yelled to warn him.At the sound of his voice, the chimera in front of them lunged and hissed again.The three men couldnt help but jump into the air at the loud hiss.Then the chimera started towards them, and they all turned and ran up to some rocks, then jumped on the other side and scrambled to load their guns.When they peeked up again, both chimeras were back where they had started.Then the three men saw the strangest thing.Frank crawled up out of the tunnel in plain sight of the chimeras, but they paid him no mind."Why Ill be... "Joe mumbled.He waved his hand from behind the rock and Frank headed over to them."Whats wrong guys?"Frank asked, leaning nonchalantly on a nearby boulder as he looked at the three men cowering behind the rocks."Were being attacked by chimeras here," Chuck said dryly, "If youd get out of our line of fire.""These guys are nice," Frank said, "They never bothered me.""Well, they jumped at us," Jeff said."I bet its the tail," Joe said."Maybe," Frank said, "I woke up with a chimera right in my face.It sniffed a couple of times and then just left me alone."Joe got up from the rocks and jogged over to a dead Blue tip several yards away.He pulled out his knife and sawed off the tip of the tail and then walked slowly towards the live chimeras with the tip held out before him.The closest chimera came over to him, and Joe froze in his tracks.The chimera smelled him, and then paid him no mind."It worked!"Joe said happily.Half an hour later, Jeff looked around him, then checked his pocket to make sure his chimera tail was still there, and then crawled down the tunnel to join the other men.It was very cool and even a little moist inside, and the four men either slept or talked away the hours as the heat blazed outside.***Chuck woke up.He thought he had heard something, but he didnt know what it was.He tried to swallow, but his throat was completely dry.Then he heard the sound again.Someone was calling his name.Chuck roused the others and they crawled out of the tunnel.It was a little windy outside and cooling off.The sky was a pale blue."Jeff!"someone yelled."Chuck!""Over here!"Chuck called out.He climbed up on a boulder.He saw other men in the distance and waved to them.After a while four men from the Shark marched into view with big sacks slung over their shoulders."We found you!"Cliff called with relief as he came up to Jeff and the others.He put his bag down."Any sign of Sam?""Not yet," Jeff said, "We had to stop.""We figured that you wouldnt be able to get far," Javier said, "So we came after you with some food and water.""Yeah!"Wes said excitedly, "Check out these water bags we made!Theyre made of lizard skin!"Jeff and the others didnt stop to admire Wess handiwork, but immediately grabbed the water bags and started drinking.After a few minutes they had quenched their thirst enough to eat some of the food the men had brought from the Shark.Then they sat down in the twilight."Whats this?"Wes asked, pulling the chimera tail out of Joes pocket."Ill show you," Joe said, "Come on. "The two of them headed off to find some of the Blue tip chimeras."We found tracks leading away from the battlefield," Jeff explained to Cliff as they sat in a circle, "And Id like to follow them as soon as some men are ready to come with me."Jeff and Cliff sat and talked some more.Several minutes later, Wes and Joe came back."Cliff," Wes said excitedly, as he waved a blue tipped tail in the air, "I have a plan!"***Sam woke up and reached out to open the panel to his bunk, but it wasnt there.He looked around in the darkness and then remembered what had happened earlier in the equipment bay.The last thing he could remember was a chimera lunging at him, but he had no idea where he was now.It was so dark that he waved his hand in front of his face but he couldn't see it.He reached out with his hands and felt around him.He was sitting on a cold dirt floor that was covered with old branches, leaves, and large chimera scales.He reached up in the air above him and didnt feel a ceiling.As he tried to get up into a crouch to touch the ceiling, he toppled over.He reached down to feel his right leg and gasped.He felt along the hard covering of the spacesuit leg until he got to the knee joint.There wasnt anything below the knee.He touched the stub of his leg inside the knee joint of the spacesuit, but it was numb to the touch.It was probably just as well that he couldnt feel it right now.Sam just sat for a while, listening to the rustling sounds of the darkness around him.He was alone and scared, but he tried to look for some hope.After all, he should be happy just to be alive.It was hard to believe that his right leg was really gone, and he hoped that he was just dreaming.He felt his leg a few times before he decided that it was definitely gone."But what do I do now?"he thought to himself.***Cliff and Jeff walked along together in the long twilight.They wandered in and out of the scrubby bushes and stopped every few minutes to pick out the best trail."Do you think Wess plan will work?"Cliff asked."I hope so," Jeff said, "But if it doesnt, we still have another day to find Sam before we have to head back for supplies."The two men each carried bags of water, small pouches of gourd mush, jackets, and other equipment.After several hours, it was completely dark and Cliff had to pull out a light and turn it on.Cliff pointed the light ahead of him and picked out a trail.Jeff followed in the darkness behind him and tried not to stumble on bushes and rocks.It was going to be a long night.***Sam had made some progress.He had finally figured out how to turn on a display light on his spacesuit control panel.Its faint glow wasnt much, but he was able to see a little around him now.He was in a low oval shaped chamber.He was sitting up against one wall, and on the other side he could see the low shapes of sleeping chimeras.Sam crept closer, careful not to wake them, and tried to get a better look at them.They were smaller than any chimeras he had ever seen, and they looked like they were not fully developed.Their heads seemed too big for their small bodies, and their limbs were small and stubby.They were draped all over each other and breathing deeply.The small chimeras blinked and squirmed on the other side, but now that he got a good look at them, he could tell that they were young, and pretty harmless.Sam breathed easier, knowing that these little chimeras werent going to have him for lunch just yet.After a few minutes without hearing any noise from the passageway, he crept over to the passageway and started down it, going by his dim light.He crawled along on his hands and knees.He got to a turn in the passage and turned to stare a chimera straight in the eyes.Its nostrils flared and it lunged at Sam, who held up his arm in fear.The chimera grabbed his arm in its mouth and flung Sam to the ground on his stomach.He heard a hiss and scrambled onto his back.The chimera grabbed Sams torso in its mouth.Sam waited for the chimeras jaws to crush him, but instead, it just carried him back to the chamber and set him down."Maybe they are keeping me alive for fresh food later," Sam thought.Sam was too scared to try anything now, so he just waited.He heard scuffling and scraping sounds coming from the passageway.For a moment, he thought the sounds were being made by the men from the Shark, but he was disappointed when his friends didnt appear.The Diamondback chimeras dragged something big into the chamber.He struggled to see it in the dim light, and it looked like a large chimera.It was bigger than any he had seen so far, and had a blue tipped tail.Three of the Diamondback chimeras dragged it into the chamber, and then began slashing and biting at it.They tore hunks of meat out of the carcass and gulped them down for several minutes, and then they went among the young chimeras.Maybe they were giving some meat to the babies.One of the adults sniffed the air in Sams direction for a while, and then headed over towards him.Sam felt around himself for a rock and gripped it tightly."If they are going to feed me to their babies, theyre not going to have an easy time of it," Sam thought to himself.***Cliff stumbled among the rocks and bushes.The thorns and branches scratched at him and he had stickers in his shoes."Man, its freezing!"Cliff said as he stopped for breath."We just have to keep moving," Jeff panted."I think were going to find tracks right down in this gorge.""I just want to sleep," Cliff said as he continued walking."Me too.""Lets take a rest as soon as we find the chimera trail again," Cliff suggested."Thats okay with me," Jeff answered.When they finally spotted chimera tracks in the beam of their flashlight, they sat down with a sigh.It was getting harder and harder to follow the trail, especially in the dark.Cliff scooped out a handful of cold gourd mush from his pouch and chewed it for a while."Its going to be morning soon," Jeff said, "Lets wait until light before we go on."***Sam stared at the meat on the floor in front him.Even though he was extremely hungry, he still couldnt bring himself to eat raw meat from the dead chimera.The chimera carcass was lying in the middle of the chamber.After the Diamondback chimeras had eaten some of the meat out of it, they started dragging the bones and scales out of the chamber.It seemed like the chimeras were cleaning up the den.After all of the adult chimeras had left, Sam waited and heard nothing for a while.He took a deep breath and scrambled out of the chamber and down the passageway.He expected to turn the corner and crawl out into the open air, but he just found more darkness.He kept crawling as fast as he could, and groped around to feel the cold dirt walls.He passed a few intersections in the tunnels and had to guess which tunnel was better.After several minutes he finally tumbled down a steep tunnel and lay panting at the bottom.He felt around him.The floor was not the same dry, cold dirt he was used to, but a wet, soggy mud.He turned on the light on his spacesuit control panel.It lit up the whole area.He was in a wide, low tunnel that continued as far as he could see.It meandered back and forth and he could see tunnels branching off of it.The walls were lined with roots, and broken roots dangled from the ceiling.Some of the thick roots showed signs of being chewed.He pressed his fist into the wet mud and then pulled it out.Muddy water slowly filled up the hole."Water!"Sam thought.He made the hole bigger and then scooped out some of the muddy water with a cupped hand.He drank it and tried to ignore the taste of the mud and the gritty particles.He continued down the wide tunnel.Tunnels branched off from the sides periodically as the tunnel wandered around.After a hundred yards or so of crawling through the mud, he stopped to rest.It wouldnt be good to get lost down here.***Sam had been searching the underground tunnels for quite a while without any luck.He decided to go up and try and find a way out.He followed one of the tunnels up, slipping on its steep sides, until the tunnel became more level.Then he wandered around looking for a way out.He stopped and turned off his light when he heard a chimera coming.It was sniffing loudly and he heard it coming closer, so he quietly started off down the tunnel in the other direction.He groped around in the blackness as he headed away from the approaching sound.Then he heard the chimera make a hissing sound and a loud scuffling close behind him.Sam panicked and crawled as fast as he could, but he collided with a wall.He groped around and scrambled down the first tunnel he found.He bumped into a wall again and decided to stop.He sat still and tried not to breathe loudly as he waited in the blackness.After a few minutes, he decided that the chimera had not followed him, and he flipped on his light.He looked around the chamber, and recognized the baby chimera on the other side.He was back in the same chamber where he had started.***The growing light of dawn spread across one horizon and Cliff roused Jeff.They checked their guns and cautiously picked their way up to a ridge to get a better view of what lay ahead.After they reached the jagged crest, Cliff pulled out the binoculars and spent about five minutes scanning the terrain below them."Wait!"Cliff said excitedly, "I think I see it.""What is it?"Jeff asked.Cliff handed him the binoculars and pointed to a small hill."Look in the shadows of the boulders on that hill.Jeff found the spot and looked at it for a minute."What am I looking for?"he asked."Just keep looking," Cliff said confidently.Then Jeff saw a chimera come out of a hole hidden in the shadows and dart across the desert floor toward low peaks in the distance."That might be their den," Jeff said as he handed the binoculars back to Cliff."I think it is," Cliff said, "But how do we get a look inside?""Well," Jeff said as he looked over their equipment, "We have two guns, with a total of two shots.""Thats not much to work with.""No, its not."***Sam woke up in the same old chamber to the sound of crunching and snapping.It had been many hours since he dozed off.In the dim light from his space suit, he could see the Blue tip carcass in the center of the chamber.Adult Diamondbacks were ripping out the insides and feeding them to the young.He closed his eyes and dozed off for a while until he heard the adults leaving.After they left, he went over to get a close look at the carcass of the Blue tip.It was about twenty feet long, head to tail.The Diamondbacks had eaten out all of its chest and abdomen.The torso, back, tail, and legs were still pretty much intact.He peered into the empty chest cavity, which was a rounded chamber formed by the ribcage.The smell was terrible, and he finally had to back away, but he had an idea.***Cliff glanced up at the rising sun and then looked back in his binoculars."There still doesnt seem to be much activity," Cliff said to Jeff as he watched the hole, "But I think they will start waking up and coming out as it heats up a little bit.If they are like Earth lizards, they need the sun to give them body heat.""Youre probably right," Jeff agreed, "So wed better move quickly."Cliff held out his hand."Wait," he said, "Somethings happening.""What?""There are one or two chimeras in the entrance to the den," Cliff said as he watched, "Theyre pulling out something.It looks like theyre pulling out a dead chimera."Jeff squinted his eyes to try and see what was happening."It is a dead chimera," Cliff said as he continued looking through the binoculars, "Its a Blue tip.Theyre dragging it out and across the desert."Jeff could see the small dark forms as they crossed the bright sand.Cliff was silent for a while.'"What are they doing now?"Jeff asked."It looks like they just dropped the dead Blue tip and now theyre heading back to the hole.""Well," Jeff asked, "Is now a good time to move in?""No," Cliff answered, "Theres too many of the Diamondbacks out and about."***Sam grunted and pushed with all of his might.The ribcage snapped and popped and opened up some more.He heaved and squirmed out of the chest cavity of the dead Blue tip chimera and collapsed on the ground with a gasp.He lay in the dirt, breathing the fresh air and blinking in the light.It seemed like he could hear voices in the distance.***Jeff was practically jumping up and down and kept trying to take the binoculars from Cliff, who held him off with one hand as he looked at the scene below."What do you see?"Jeff yelled."It looks like Sam!"Cliff shouted."He came out from inside the dead lizard."Cliff handed the binoculars to Jeff and then jumped over the rocks and headed down a rocky slope towards the desert below where Sam was lying.Jeff finally got a look through the binoculars.He smiled as he saw Sam sit up, but then his smile faded.He saw some motion in the distance, and lowered the binoculars to cup his hand around his mouth."Sam!"Jeff shouted, "Run!Run!Over here!"Sam didnt seem to hear him."What is it?"Cliff shouted from down below."Theyre coming!"Jeff shouted as he leapt over the rocks and started running after Cliff.The two of them leapt boulders and ploughed through bushes at a frightening speed as they raced towards Sam.Cliff knew he was going to trip sooner or later but he couldnt slow down.They flew over rocks and bushes, shouting, "Sam!Over here!Run for it!"***Down in the valley, Sam wiped his eyes and looked around.He finally saw Jeff and Cliff coming in two clouds of dust.He smiled when he recognized them, but he was a little confused.Why were they so frantic?He turned to see two chimeras coming towards him from the other direction.He got up on his left leg and tried to hop along, but he kept falling over, so he scrambled along as fast as he could on his hands and knees.Jeff and Cliff were getting closer.Sam glanced back to see the closest chimera darting towards him.It was very close and coming fast.He planted his left foot against a rock shoved off with his hands and foot just as the chimera lunged at him.He rolled to one side in a cloud of dust, and the chimera landed where he had just been, tumbling in the dirt.Sam started crawling again, and he saw the chimera snap to its feet and look straight at him.Just then, with a tremendous explosion, rocks and dust blasted into the air just in front of the chimera.The chimera spun and ran off, and before Sam knew what was happening, Cliff was there.Cliff holstered his gun and pulled Sam to his feet so that they could start running.Jeff came up also and they stood on either side of Sam and carried him along as fast as they could.They started up the slope towards the rocky crest of the ridge.Jeff turned for a moment to fire at two chimeras, which had been cautiously following them.The two chimeras spun and ran away several paces, and then stopped to turn and watch the three men.Soon they were at the crest of the ridge and they helped Sam over the top.They sat on a rock panting before moving on.The men hobbled along the ridge, which had a steep rocky spine.The spine was a wall of rock about eight feet high.Jeff and Cliff pulled themselves up onto the top, and then helped Sam up.Then Cliff and Sam hobbled off down the far side of the ridge.Jeff stayed behind and looked around for something he could use for a weapon to stop the approaching chimeras.He lifted a large rock to his shoulder and went to the edge of the rock face.The two chimeras were on the lower slope, coming carefully up towards him.When they were close enough, Jeff hurled the rock with all of his strength.It hit another rock near one of the chimeras with a crack.Chips of rock flipped through the air, and the rock tumbled down the slope.The chimeras jumped back and stood still, almost disappearing into the rocks.Jeff raced back and forth, looking for something else to throw at the chimeras.He began throwing anything he could find: rocks, gravel, and even sticks.Then one of the chimeras came right up to the bottom of the rock face.Jeff put his shoulder to a large rock and pushed with all of his strength.He rolled it over the edge with a mighty grunt.It crashed onto the chimera in a cloud of dust and sent it sprawling on the ground.It pulled itself to its feet and quickly retreated.The other chimera was watching all of this warily at a slight distance.In his anger, Jeff yelled at the remaining chimera, which hissed and then backed off grudgingly.Jeff stood panting for a moment as he watched the chimeras walk away, and then hurried after Cliff.Cliff and Sam finally stopped to rest on some rocks.Cliff was breathing so hard that he began coughing."Thanks," Sam said wearily, "You dont know how happy I am to see you.""Were pretty glad to see you, too," Cliff said between breaths."I just hope Jeff can scare them off.""Why dont you just shoot them?"Sam asked."Those were our last shots," Cliff answered."You dont have any more ammo?"Sam asked incredulously."No," Cliff said, looking up, "I think the guys back at the Shark have two more shots.""Great.""What happened to your leg?"Cliff asked, pointing at it."I think it ended up as a lizards lunch," Sam said."Im glad they didnt eat any more of you," Cliff said."Maybe they didnt like the taste of me."Jeff caught up with them and they headed off again.After an hour they collapsed in the shade of large boulders to rest for a few moments, and all three promptly fell asleep.***Jeff woke up and eventually realized that he was uncomfortably hot.He was no longer in the shade of the boulders.The sun had shifted and was blazing with its full force right on him.He sat up and looked around.Cliff and Sam had fallen asleep too.Jeff stood up and then tensed when he heard a hissing sound and something crunching the gravel as it walked.Jeff crept around the other side of the boulders and saw a huge chimera staring him down.He froze.The chimera sniffed the air and its mouth slightly opened in what looked like a snarl.But Jeff saw that the chimera had a rope around its snout.Jeff followed the rope with his eyes along its length until he saw a hand.The person the hand belonged to stepped out from behind the chimera.It was Wes.Wes was chewing on a root nonchalantly."Oh," Wes said, "Its you, Jeff.""Yeah, its me," Jeff said, smiling with relief."My plan worked," Wes said, "We were able to bring enough supplies on the chimeras to last a couple days."Jeff eyed the chimera warily."Oh, about the lizard," Wes said, showing Jeff a lizard skin sack on a necklace around his neck.This bag has a special gland we cut out of a dead lizard.The gland produces a particular scent that the lizards recognize.The chimeras follow whoever has this bag.They must depend on their sense of smell to communicate.Hey, how long do you think it will take to find Sam?""Somebody talking about me?"Sam called as he struggled to his feet with a groan, then leaned over against the boulders to prop himself up on his one leg. "Sam!"Wes yelled happily, "Youre alive, man!""You thought they could kill me?"Sam asked, as if the idea was ludicrous."Yeah, but," Wes said, slowing as he saw Sams missing leg, "Man, you didnt get maimed did you?""Yeah, Im hurt bad.""What did I tell you?"Wes said with annoyance, "When we started, I told everyone not to get maimed or nothing!"Wes walked over to Sam and helped him stand up, looking at his leg."I cant believe it," he said, shaking his head, "but Im real glad to see you alive, buddy. "Then Wess face lit up."Hey!"he said, spinning around and going over to the chimera."Its a good thing I brought Silver here so he can give you a ride home!"***Soon Sam was seated snuggly on the back of the chimera named Silver.Wes held a lead rope and pulled Silver along from the front, and three other chimeras came along behind, each tied to the one in front of it.They had supplies strapped to their backs.Jeff and Cliff rode on the backs of two of the chimeras, while Joe, Chuck, Javier and Denz walked along each side.They had sticks that they used to slap the sides of the chimeras if they started to stray."I cant believe your plan worked, Wes," Jeff said from a chimeras back, shaking his head as he bounced along, "You got away with it.""You should have seen when it got away from him," Javier said."I dont want to talk about that!"Wes called.14Krid walked on the desert floor, kicking the dirt with his boot."Look at these footprints!"he told Lang as he wiped sweat off of his face, "They're fresh.The Reds must have just left this planet.""We're getting closer," Lang said, "We should be able to catch them any day now.""They'll be very happy back home when we tell them the news."***Cliff rubbed his eyes and looked into his telescope again.As the Shark hurtled along through space, stars were beginning to appear in the middle of the sky."Its happening again," Cliff murmured under his breath."What?"Gavin asked, overhearing."We must be going back through the cloud," Cliff answered, "Before we got to the Wadi Kahn, we went through a dark cloud in space.Our galaxy has many dark clouds or rifts along the spiral arms, and we are coming back through one of them.""So we are coming back out of the rift we entered before finding the Wadi Kahn?"Gavin asked."We must be," Cliff answered."It seems as if the Wadi Kahn is almost completely hidden inside the dark rift.""Well," Gavin said, "Just keep trying to find something to lead us home."***Krid walked along in the desert sand, dust flying up with every step.He looked around him at the desert scrub."Lang," Krid said, "This is amazing!After centuries of looking, we find two planets with life within a few years of each other.""Yes," Lang answered from a short distance away, "It is very remarkable.It looks like the Reds landed over here.There are footprints, campfires, and evidence of rocket exhaust.""We're getting closer," Krid said."I think we'll have them soon."***The men on the Shark soon settled back into their shipboard routine.Jeff paced up and down the ship to check on the crew during his shift."Now, what are you two doing?"Jeff asked Wes and Javier."Just setting up a little game of Ping Pong," Javier answered.The two men had made a Ping Pong table in the equipment bay."Dont you have anything more important to do?"Jeff asked."Were not on duty for several more hours," Wes answered."I guess youre not," Jeff conceded.Wes served the ball, which bounced off of his side of the table and then kept flying upward into the air."Aw, it happened again," Javier groaned."It just isnt going to work right.""Youll have to change the rules a little bit," Jeff said, "You cant serve the ball the same way you do on Earth, because there isnt any gravity to pull the ball down.""So, how are we going to do it?"Wes asked skeptically."Watch," Jeff said, "Ill show you. "Jeff grabbed Wess paddle and ball."Lets say I have to hold the ball motionless directly above the middle of my end of the table before I serve.Then Ill serve it towards Javiers side without letting it touch my side.Thats how the serve will be different than normal.It will bounce off of his side, and then he hits the ball so it bounces off of my side.From there, we just keep playing like a normal game.All you have to do is change the serve."Jeff demonstrated a serve.The ball bounced off of Javiers side of the table and Javier hit the ball back.It whizzed by Jeffs head."Remember, you have to hit the ball down," Jeff said, "There isnt any gravity to help pull it down.""Right," Javier said.He served the ball to Jeff and soon the ball was whizzing back and forth."Hey," Wes said, "Its working after all!Now, Jeff, remember that youre on duty.You need to give me my paddle back so I can play now.""Not on your life," Jeff said, "Ive got to win this game first.""Great," Wes mumbled, "Jeff finally decides to lighten up when its my turn to play."***"Wow," Cliff said to himself, "That star cluster looks awfully familiar!"He rummaged through his maps and pulled out the first map he had made at Earth."Its on this map too!"Cliff shouted."I cant believe I didnt see it before.""What is it?"Jose asked."Its a star cluster," Cliff replied."Whats so special about a star cluster?""This star cluster is on one of my earlier maps.That means that our sun might be visible from here!"Cliff did some calculations for several minutes and then swung the telescope around.A dim, yellow star slid into view in the eyepiece."I bet that humble little yellow star is our very own sun!"Cliff said ecstatically."Now we can finally go home!""Ill tell Gavin," Jose said excitedly, and then dove through the hatch in the floor.***That night, everyone on the Shark gathered in the equipment bay for a big party.Even the lookout took a break to join the fun.They feasted on chimera steaks and desert gourds."I want to make a toast to Cliff," Jeff said, holding up a bottle of water."Hes the best navigator we have ever had.Without him, we never would have been able to find our way home."Everyone cheered."I would like to make a toast also," Cliff said, "To Joe and Sam, who provided the, uh, beverage."The men drank and then looked at the dirty water in their bottles.Particles of sand drifted in it."Thank you," Joe said, "And just remember, every time you drink, how much dirt I swallowed while I was working in that blasted hole. "The group laughed and slapped Joe and Sam on the back.Cliff couldnt remember when he had ever been so happy.Just then, Krid Zaff burst through the hatch with more Purple Men close behind him.The Reds reached for their guns and found them empty.They had run out of ammunition long ago."Well," Wes said dryly, "It was fun while it lasted.""How does this guy keep showing up all the time?"Joe asked with annoyance.Lod entered the room after several minutes with a smug smile."Round them all up!"Lod shouted.Most of Gavins men understood the words, having spent much time learning the language by now.This time, Lod didnt spend any time lecturing the Reds."What course shall we set?"Lang asked."Head to Earth," Krid said, "We don't have much time to meet up with the fleet before the invasion."***Soon the two docked ships were cruising toward Earth.The Reds were going to get home after all, but they were going home as prisoners.Guards were posted all throughout the Shark to watch their every move.When the guards weren't paying too much attention, Wes pushed himself to Javier."Javier," he whispered, "I have a chimera tooth in my back pocket.Can you help me reach it?I bet I can cut through these bonds with it."Thin, plastic bonds bound their hands and feet.After a few moments of struggling, Wes was able to get the tooth in his hand.Wes started to try and cut through the plastic."No," Javier said, "Wait until a better time."***"We're only a few days from Earth," Lang reported to Krid, who was talking with Lod in the cockpit."Don't you think we should get started on the after action report for the fleet?""I'd forgotten about that," Krid said."How is it that you can remember the details of every battle of the Sixth Fleet, but you can't remember to do the paper work," Lang asked."Good question," Krid said with a laugh."I suppose we should get started.Get the exercise room ready for interviews.We can start taking notes from our men.Also, I'll have my intelligence officer start performing the interrogations on the prisoners tomorrow."***Late that night, Lod walked quietly into the equipment bay on the Shark where the Reds were being held.He motioned to the two armed guards, who came over to him while the Reds slept."Guards," Lod commanded, "I've just received word from the Political Prison that two of these Reds must be executed immediately.""Executed, why?"one of the guards asked."They were already sentenced to death at the prison for espionage.Those two over there," Lod said, pointing to Chuck and Sam."Yes, sir," said the second guard, a tall Purple Man."We'll do it right away.""No, we'll have to inform Krid first," the first guard said."He's still captain of this ship.I can go wake him.""No," Lod said, "As Liaison, I have sufficient authority to command you in this.Take them to the airlock now.""Sir," the guard objected, "It will be a simple thing to get Krid to oversee the execution.""No," Lod said, louder this time."If you won't do it, give me your weapon."The first guard refused to give up his weapon.Lod motioned for the tall guard to help and he reached out to grab the man's gun.The guard resisted and they three men started to struggle.When they almost had wrestled the gun away, the beleaguered guard yelled.Soon several other Purple Men were in the bay.Lod had his arm around the guard's neck while the other tried to pry the gun out of his grip."Jilken!Help!"the guard wheezed at one of the men who had just entered.Jilken leaped up and pried Lod's arms away from the guard and pulled him back.More of the Purple Men joined the fray.The Reds were now waking up at staring in disbelief.Just then, Krid stepped into the room."Stop this now!"Krid yelled.His voice echoed through the room.The panting men pulled back, the one guard still gripping his weapon to his chest defiantly."What is going on?"Krid growled."This private refused to follow a direct order," Lod said breathlessly as he pointed to the first guard, whose face was flushed and sweaty."With the corporal's help, I attempted to subdue him.""Jilken," Krid commanded, "Put the private in his bunk and lock it.""Sir, I  " Jilken started to object."Now, Jilken," Krid said, "Or you will be confined as well."Jilken sullenly obeyed."Now, as for the rest of you," Krid said, "I know we've been under a lot of pressure lately.We've been outside of the area covered by our charts for some time and we've been working hard.So, I'm willing to withhold any charges unless it happens again.Dismissed."The rest of the men left the room, but Krid motioned for two new guards to stay with the Reds."What was the order?"Krid asked Lod after they got into the cockpit."Two of the Reds had already been sentenced for execution at the prison before they escaped," Lod said haltingly, "I just received word that they were to be executed immediately and ordered the guards to pull them aside.""I've never seen Private Nokos behave this way," Krid said, pondering for a moment."Well, I'll prepare the men for the execution.Only I'll need confirmation of the official order.""Here it is," Lod said as he called up the file on a computer."I see," Krid said."Go ahead and get some sleep.I'll need an hour or so to get the men ready for the execution.We don't normally do this kind of thing in the Navy."Lod left the cockpit and Krid looked over the order for a moment.He typed and few buttons and pursed his lips as he looked at the screen.Lang walked over to him with a questioning look."Lang," Krid said slowly, "This is an order from Gornig at the prison to execute two of the Reds.""Yes," Lang said, "Is there something wrong?""It was dated before the Reds escaped from the prison," Krid said, "But the file wasn't actually created until two days after the Reds escaped.""It could have taken some time to create the paper work," Lang suggested.Krid thought some more, then grunted and jumped down the ladder."Jion," Krid called to his intelligence officer, "I need your language skills once again.""Are you picking up more intercom traffic from a Red ship?"Jion said, getting out of his bunk.Krid shook his head and then motioned for silence.Jion frowned and quietly followed him to the exercise room.Jion led Chuck back into the equipment bay, his face white."What happened?"Gavin asked.Jion ordered them to be silent and then pointed toward Sam.Sam got up nervously and followed Jion back out of the bay."They're going to kill me," Chuck said with a blank stare."I only have a few hours."Sam was tied into a chair in the exercise room, sitting across from Krid and Jion.Krid started talking softly and Jion translated it."We've received word that you were sentenced to be executed at the Political Prison," Jion translated."I wanted to make sure you could make a final statement before you are killed.""What are the charges?"Sam asked."Espionage and assassination," Jion answered.Sam sat silently for a while."Your friend wouldn't say anything either," Jion said and started to get up."Is there any way for me not to die?"Sam pleaded."No, the sentence has already passed.""Then I do wish to make a statement," Sam said, "I may be guilty of murder, but I'm not the only one.""You are speaking of your comrade Chuck?"Jion asked."Yes, but he's not the only one.""Explain.""We were at the prison," Sam started."Two Purple Men took Chuck and me to an empty hallway.The men made it known that we could be set free if we did something for them.They told us that we could go free if we killed a man that would be walking through that door in a moment.If we didn't do it, they would come back and we would be killed immediately.Chuck looked at me and shrugged.'A Purple Man is a Purple Man,' he said.'They're all my enemies. 'He told them that we would do it.The Purple Men handed us each a gun and left.""What happened?"Jion asked finally after he translated to Krid."A Purple Man came out of the door, and Chuck shot him point blank.""Did you shoot too?""No, but I did nothing to stop it from happening.""Did the two men come back?""I don't know, we both ran to the airlocks and got on our ship," Sam said."So that is how you escaped the prison," Krid said."Yes.""Anything else?"Jion asked."Who did we kill?"Sam asked."One of the Oligarchs," Krid said grimly."Can you describe the two Purple Men who arranged for you to perform the assassination?"***"That's a strange story," Lang said to Krid later when they were alone in the galley."And he claimed it was Lod?""That's what the Red claimed," Krid said, "I don't really believe him, but it might not be a bad idea to delay the execution and have the case revisited, since we don't have any information about how the assassination occurred.""Lod would be outraged when he finds out that the Red accused him of murder," Lang said."Don't tell him about that part," Krid said, "Let's just say that the Red is willing to offer more information about the assassination and we'll see what Lod does.If he does anything suspicious, we'll know that there might be more to this."***The equipment bay was packed full of men.On one side, Chuck and Sam were standing against the wall.The other Reds were standing in rows on the other side.In the middle and all around the room, the Purple Men were standing with their weapons at the ready.Finally, Krid walked into the bay.The Purple Men snapped to attention.Jion walked up to Krid and whispered something in his ear."Men," he said, "Stop the proceedings.My intelligence officer just informed me that one of the prisoners is now willing to come forward with more information.We'll delay the execution until we have a chance to find out what he has to say.""No," Lod called quickly, "Your orders are explicit.You must execute the prisoners now.""Don't worry, Lod," Krid said, "We can easily reconvene in a few hours after investigating what this man has to say. "Krid pointed at Sam."There is no need to find out what he has to say," Lod yelled."The Liaisons have already closed the case.If you do not execute them now, I will order you arrested for disobeying orders.The Red is only trying to delay his execution.""He may be willing to offer information that the Liaisons did not know before they made their sentence," Krid offered."Besides, a few more hours won't hurt you personally. "Krid paused before continuing slowly, "Or will it?"Lod's eyes narrowed and he clenched his teeth as he mulled over what Krid just said."Lang," Lod said slowly, "Arrest your commander and confine him to his bunk.He is not to speak to anyone."Lang didn't move."Stufi!"Lod shouted to the second mate, "Arrest those two."Stufi came forward to arrest Krid and Lang."No!"Jion yelled.Jilken stepped between Stufi and Krid to stop the arrest."Jilken, don't get into arguments you have no business being in," Stufi said before attempting to push Jilken aside.Jilken pushed back and shoved Stufi off of his feet.Another of the Purple Men punched Jilken in the face before being hit with the butt of Jion's gun.As a fight broke out, Lod rushed over to the guard nearest Chuck and Sam.He took the guard's gun."Mutineers!Stop them.Fire!"Lod yelled to the Purple Men not already embroiled in the fight.The Purple Men rushed to take sides in the fight.Sam saw Lod raise the gun to point it at Krid.Though he was bound hand and foot, Sam pushed off the wall with his foot and rammed his shoulder into Lod's stomach, doubling the man over.Lod struggled to get Sam off of him and his gun went off.The blast sent Sam crashing into the wall.Chuck started to jump away and Lod motioned to the other guard to shoot.The guard fired and Chuck collapsed.Shots rang out across the width and breadth of the Pinak.Smoke and debris ricocheted across the bay.Wes pulled out his lizard tooth and began sawing away at Javier's bonds.Finally they snapped open."Got it!"Wes whispered.Javier took the tooth and started working on getting his feet free.The men loyal to Lod retreated to the bunkroom and started firing at Krid and his men through the airlock.After a few minutes, Lang nudged Krid with his elbow as they took cover behind crates.Krid turned to look at him."The Reds are getting away," Lang shouted over the din.Krid watched as the Reds snuck through the bay door onto the Shark."Don't worry about it," Krid said as the bay door closed behind the last Red."We've got more important things to think about."None of the Purple Men seemed to care when a violent shudder signaled that the Shark had detached from their Pinak."Ready your thermal knives," Krid yelled."We're going to do this like Reds.Charge!"***Sunlight streamed through the cockpit windows of the Shark.The craft hurtled towards a bright blue dot in the sky that was all that could be seen of Earth.The glowing heat of the nearby star was the warm glow of home for these men.Never had the Sun's warmth filled them with so much hope.The same Sun lit the cockpit of Krid's Pinak.Shattered electrical panels sparked and smoke drifted through the air.Krid slumped in his seat, looking at the Sun as he sped towards it.For him, it was an omen of fire and trouble ahead.He staggered down to the bunkroom to hear Lang's report."How many dead?"he asked with his hand over his eyes as Lang approached."Six, not counting Lod," Lang said."Two of ours and four of his. "Lang pointed to the bunks where the bodies were laid."No," Krid said.
