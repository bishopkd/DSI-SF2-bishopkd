They had made it through science, philosophy, religion and metaphysics, but never to embrace something so fervently that they became the information.What they discovered was that society was an information society.It was a war of ideas, which were contrary to each other, just as man was pitted against man in the wars that existed before.It was not the genes that ruled but the memes.The next conquest was the conquest of life itself.People wanted to understand the cause of life, allowing them to create life in laboratories.Amy had realized that this was pointless.The cause of life was not found in space, but somewhere else.She realized this through conversations with Trent: Another rootless soul who sought for the sake of seeking.The idea of panspermia was not poor in scientific terms: The fact was that the evidence was very convincing.Scientists had found signs of organic molecules in distant celestial bodies.They had seen astonishing similarities between life forms on the different planets.Evolution as such was a very slow process, and would naturally be accelerated by interstellar exchange.Trent, however, had discovered that there was a gross mistake in the usual theories: It was the scientific method itself.Not the facts that were presented, but the very idea that gathering of facts would lead to knowledge.He realized that the world didnt work as science claimed: That there was a physical world, that it followed specific laws, that one could deduce anything even by analyzing memories.So he postulated that something would be found in the distant asteroids.But the probability that this something would be the building blocks of life seemed to be near zero.The journey to the asteroid took place in the freethinkers initiative to liberate scientists from meaningless work and to make them focus on something else.* * *      The night was still young; the couple was illuminated by the green light and some weak spots on the interstellar surface.Amy carved out ice cubes from the walls of the cave.Ice cubes to be sealed in plastic bags and then placed in special bins.I find it hard to believe that this wont be crucial.Trent said, But we shouldnt call it revolution, rather a counter movement.Yes.The end result of meme evolution is not truth.A survivor in the garden of thought is rather a parasite; an invading thought structure that takes control of the individual and makes him a carrier.Thats why its so hard to believe in the end.Trent said, A thought structure that kills the carriers cant survive.The freethinkers pulled together to dig out the last bits of rock.These would be sealed in plastic bags and later brought back to the colony.* * *      The society of the colony was dissolving.Science had reached a point where it realized its own limitations.What followed was a fierce debate, argument made against counter argument and the end result was conceptual indifference, a kind of throwback to something earlier, and chance took over.Now the freethinkers journeyed to a remote cloud, a nebula of interstellar dust, where they thought stars were created.They didnt know why they made the trip.They felt that the search was lifes greatest adventure.* * *      The ride in the spaceship was different from other trips theyd done before.Earlier travels had a clear purpose, a concrete goal.Now they had become accustomed to living in space.They ate well, they played games, had discussions about everything.They were far away from the obvious and something else took over.One evening they sat down and pondered when Trent became serious.What if the reason for this trip is different from what we think it is?He said, That we dont want to search.That weve put all of this behind us.What do you mean?The fact that our so called interest is the origin of something new: Maybe were moving away from ourselves and into another universe, quite literally?Amy didnt watch her travel mate.She looked down at the table, busy counting vitamin pills at the side of a can.This isnt something I pick out of my imagination.Trent continued, Ive seen the sophistication of consciousness, realized that my true emotions, is a product of information Ive nurtured at a deeper level.I remember our adventures...Amy said, but she was still preoccupied with the vitamin pills on the table.Maybe Im in love.Trent said abruptly.In love?Amy said surprised, In love with what?Thats what I wonder about.In periods Ive imagined Im in love with you.But right now it comes and goes.Amy watched the young man with interest.Im not in love with the person I see.Trent continued, Not in the person sitting next to me.Its rather something that you could be but havent yet dared to express.Amy laughed.Shed grown accustomed to the freethinkers strange quirks.His impulsiveness in moments when it least counted.Why are we here at all?Trent asked, Were going to an unknown place just because its an unknown place.We dont know what well face.We dont know if there are any secrets left to discover.Maybe we do it because we cant do something else?Amy said, Because weve come across the right information.Thats what Ive long believed.But I dont want to think so.Trent fidgeted.The basic reason is the feelings.He said, They want to do the most impractical thing.Its therefore essential that the goal is extremely vague.That the intellect is protesting.The memes in society have led us to believe that this is pointless.And maybe it is pointless.But then the feelings win.Amy was thinking.She analyzed Trents claims to see beyond them and find the meaning.Yes, maybe.Amy said, And this is the reason you want me?
