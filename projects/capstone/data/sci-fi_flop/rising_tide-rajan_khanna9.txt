And that means that someone pointed it at us.Fuck!Im looking for something to throw when I catch Clays Im not at all amused look.Are you finished?Sorry, I say.Why are you telling me, though?Why not just tell Miranda?I will, he says.Im on my way there.But ...you have a different set of skills.I look at him, surprised.You want my help?What I want is to cure this new disease and for Sergei to get better.And Im going to focus on that.But we dont know where the new virus came from.And someone should look into it.Why me?Why not go to Lewis?Or the Keepers?Because like it or not, you know Sergei.You know us.I may not like you, but I trust you to look out for Sergei and Miranda more than a politician or a group of peacekeepers.You saw what they did to Miranda.Okay, I say.Anything else you can tell me?Maybe how its transmitted?He shakes his head.I dont know that.All I can tell you is that as far as I can tell, its not airborne, he says.But data is extremely thin right now.Ill see what I can do.He nods, then turns to go.I guess theres still a place for me, Clay, I say at his back.He turns back to me.Prove it, he says, before walking out.Believe me, I think.I intend to.NINETEEN FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA Im failing Sergei.I am having no luck with this virus, and hes the one whos paying the price.I sat with him today, as Ive been doing every day since he got sick, and he could barely lift a cup to his mouth to drink.Fatigue and muscle weakness are just two of the symptoms, and its progressing so fast.Too fast.My best guess is that its some kind of autoimmune disease, that his system is destroying its own cells.Breaking him down from the inside.Its insidious, but what makes it worse is that I cant seem to get a handle on it.It may share a structure, or part of a structure, with Maenad, but its a completely different virus.How the Cabal created it, I dont know.I cant really afford to think about it, either.Every time I do, I start to slip into a blind rage, and thats not going to help anyone.But I keep making notes in the margins of my notebooks.They all say the same thing.They will pay.In the meantime, I split my time between trying to crack this virus and trying to make Sergei comfortable.We sit for little breaks, and we talk about everything.How the eggs used to taste back on the commune, and how Ive never been able to find chickens to match.I confess to him that I accidentally let a whole crop of tomatoes die and blamed it on a blight.He talked to me about his childhood growing up.His father was pre Maenad.He came from Russia and made sure that his sons knew it.Sergei and Nikolai.Sergeis face clouded over when he talked about his brother.Nikolai died when Sergei was a teenager.He never really talked much about him.I just know it was an accident.I asked him how he came to the commune.I knew he hadnt been born there, but remarkably I had never asked him how he got there.I just regarded him as a fixture.My father mixed ...chemicals to get by, he said.He taught me how to do it.What kind of chemicals?I asked.He tried to shrug, but the effort made him wince.A little bit of everything, he said.That included everything from lamp oil and refreshed gasoline to paralytics and narcotics.When Sergeis father died, Nikolai looked after him.When Nikolai died, he looked for someplace he could be useful.And he found the commune.They taught me other skills, he said.And I found ...I found I wasnt too old to learn them.The rest I didnt need to be told.How he befriended and studied with my father.How he took me in after my parents had died.And yet he talked about that, too.You were so ...angry, he said.I was?You dont remember?I shook my head.My memories of that time are something of a blur.But in the end I remember Sergei taking care of me, and focusing on the science.I pushed myself.I still regret my parents dying, but their death spurred me to be better than I was.You were an angry girl.Angry at the world for taking your parents away.Angry at Maenad.Such anger...Now, here, years later, I can imagine it.Such anger.You helped me turn away from that, I said.Maybe.His voice was thin and thready.I might have helped.But I think you did a lot of it yourself.Threw yourself into the work.I ...I worried.That maybe you would turn to science for all of the answers, and wall yourself off from your emotions.He shook his head.But you never did.His smile was thin.Its one of the things Im most proud of.I squeezed his hand, gently.So, yes, we talk about so many things.He told me how he and Clay had bartered for a book from the mainland, smuggled in with one of the inspection crew.A book of old games.And how they passed their time by working through it.I quite liked croquet, he said.That was interesting.Of course we had to use tree branches for clubs and our ball wasnt anything like it was supposed to be.But I had fun.It made me smile then.It makes me smile now.Thinking of Clay and Sergei playing croquet (whatever that actually looks like).I thought about asking him, but he moved on to talk about other sports.We talk about golf and cricket and soccer.The only thing we dont talk about is the new virus, which Ive named Enigma.I know Sergei wants to know about it, wants to see if he can help, but I just cant bring myself to do it.I dont want him to know exactly what hes up against.Or how in the dark I am.And its a moot point anyway.There isnt much that he could do.Hes lucid at times, but hes weak.He sleeps a lot.And sometimes his mind wanders off, lost in the pain and fatigue.How could he help?He would just end up frustrated.And yet I am frustrated.I have the others helping meweve taken to sending notes back and forth.We fold papers and send them through slots, carried by gloved Keepers.My wardens are friendly, but I dont think they realize what theyre doing, or how even this quarantine is slowing us down.My hope right now is that Ben can find out something about Enigma.Where it came from or how it was transmitted or, really, anything.New people are being infected every day, and I am working for them as well.We need to stop this.But I would be lying if I didnt admit that my heart was right here.With Sergei.And ...if he doesnt make it, a part of my heart will die right here with him.Its funnyI used to hate phrases like that.Leaving my heart.Because the heart is an organ and it has nothing to do with emotion, and because I always fall back on the science.But its really the best way to say what this feels like.That something inside of me, something so vital and central and important, is breaking.I think a lot about how Sergei took me in after my parents died.He was close with my father, and I think he felt it was his duty to help look after me.And he did.And he recognized that that little girl, who had just lost her two teachers and mentors, needed to work.To learn.To throw herself into something.And so he gave me just that.Gave me exactly what I needed when I needed it most.Damn it, why am I just realizing now how much Ive depended on him over the years to be my rock?Knowing Sergei was there meant there was always a place to retreat to.Always a home no matter where we were.He encouraged me in every endeavor I put my mind to.He supported my vision of a cure.And he did everything in his power to make that vision a reality.Did he do it for the world?Or for me?And does it really matter?No, of course not.And so how can I not do everything I can for him right now?Whether thats studying the structure of Enigma or rubbing his painful limbs and listening to him talk of the old days.Whatever it takes is my mantra.Whatever it takes.Whatever it takes.They will pay.TWENTY For the first time since this new bug hit, I feel useful.Miranda can attack it in the world of science, but maybe I can attack it in the real world.I know she would hate to hear me frame it like that, but at the moment I dont care.To help me tackle it, Ive enlisted Diego.Im at his place instead of the new house.Pacing again.Diego sits in a chair, leaning back against the wall.We still dont know how its transmitted, I say.Could be like the Bugthrough fluidsor it could be something else.Clay didnt think it was airborne.He said something about transmission and vectors.Basically, a lot more people would be sick.But we still dont know how it works.So what do we do?Diego asks.Maybe we can look at the infected people and try to figure out what they all have in common.Eight people are infected right now.Six are boffins.Two are not.On the surface, there doesnt seem anything to tie them all together.The two non boffins are just normal Tamoanchan residents.A woman named Janice whos a server at the Frothy Brew and a man named Shep whos a carpenter.Only a couple of the boffins have even been to the Frothy Brew (most prefer to brew their own hooch).And while Shep worked on the new lab facilities, it sounds like he never really interacted with any of the boffins.Hmmm...Diego says.He scratches at his beard with his good arm.The question is whether they were all infected independently or whether it spread between them.I nod.I thought maybe the Frothy Brew.The beer.But that doesnt make any sense.Diego tilts his head.Maybe a better question is, how did they get it here?The disease.I nod.Ive been thinking about that.Maybe the boffins were infected with it back in the camp.And then we brought it back when we brought them here.Its something thats been nagging me for a little while.That maybe I was responsible for bringing the disease here.Maybe Sergei being sick is my fault.But why was Sergei the first to get sick, then?Diego wonders.He wasnt in the camp.No, I say.And the prisoners should have been the first to show symptoms.Yeah.I throw my hands up in the air.I wish Claudia was here.Shes much better at this thing than I am.Rosie walks into the room, and I immediately tense up.She crosses her arms and leans back against the wall.Youre doing this all wrong, she says.You have to try to think like them.Like the Cabal, I say.She nods.Okaaay, I say.Let me fetch my evil genius hat.She just stares at me, unamused.Fine.So Im in the Cabal.We created the virus.Theyre calling it Enigma, Rosie says.I know, I say.We created Enigma.Why?Diego asks.Because we can, I say.Because its easier than sending raiders in to attack.Instead, we infect everyone, let their bodies turn on them, then we just walk in and take over.Thats fucked, Diego says.Completely fucked, I say.But it makes sense.By all accounts, these assholes want to take as much as they can get.They teamed up with Valhalla for manpower, but now they dont need it.They let the disease work for them.The question is, Diego says, were they targeting us?I think we can assume they were.We thought all this time that they might not have our location, because no raiders came.What if this was their aim all along?They want to take us out with the vi ...with Enigma.I feel sick, Diego says.What?Rosie asks.A figure of speech.They couldnt have come close to the island with a ship, Rosie says.It would have been spotted.Something starts itching in my brain.Something I cant quite seem to scratch at.Scraps of a story.Diego and Rosie continue talking about ships and boats and goods being brought in for barter.Wait, I say.What?Diego asks.The horse.The what?The horse.They both look at me blankly.Theres this story about a wooden horse.People hid inside of it, and when it was brought into the city, they snuck out to attack.What the hell are you talking about?Diego asks.They didnt need a boat or an airship or barter.They let us bring them back.When we rescued the boffins!But we figured out that they didnt infect them.But we brought back a few extra people, didnt we?Rosie steps forward.You mean Maya and Hector?I nod.Everyone is quiet.Its not them, Rosie says.Why not?I ask.She meets my eyes with her steely gaze, her jaw set.Because Ive talked to them.Got to know them.I cant see them doing this.You know them that well, I say.I shake my head.Boy, Rosie, you move fast.Then shes moving, crossing the space, and she grabs my shirt and pushes me back, slamming me into the wall.Rosie!Diego is on his feet, pulling her away from me with his good arm.He turns her to him.Ben is not the enemy.Are you sure about that?she spits back at him.Im sorry, I say moving forward.You must have your head stuffed up your ass.Youre defending them and calling me an enemy?Youre the one who leaves wreckage in your wake.I shake my head.Too bad Im not a woman.I could bat my eyes and sway my hips and youd just turn over for me.I dont see the fist until its right in my face.But I feel it.The punch sends me back into the wall.I throw my hand down to brace myself.The kick comes a moment later.I twist away, but it catches me in the ribs.Rosie!Diego shouts.It must make her slow for a second because the second punch is clumsy and I grab her arm and pull her forward, lifting my knee into her midsection.It connects solidly and knocks the air out of her.I take advantage by slamming her into the wall.Ben!Diego yells.But I ignore him.For a moment.Because he grabs me with one massive hand and tosses me to the side.As Im regaining my balance, I see him plant himself in front of Rosie.You both are going to stop acting like fucking fools, he said.Or else Im going to put you both down.I stay where I am, sucking in air, feeling the pain of Rosies hits throb through my body.Diego turns to me.Are you finished acting like a damned idiot?Is she?He shakes his head, and the look on his face makes me feel ashamed.But the pain in my ribs sparks the anger again.Im trying to figure things out here.For Sergei and Miranda.And we need to talk to Maya and Hector.Yes, Diego says.We do.Rosie looks at him like he just kneed her in the gut.And what if its not them?What if theyre innocent and this came in on some ship full of supplies?What if we pursue this and let the real source slip away?Thats not a bad question, I think.Theres nothing to say that it didnt happen that way except that it would require the Cabal knowing our ships.Knowing that whatever they planted would be brought back here and used in the right way.It seems like a bit of a stretch.Are you saying that Maya and Hector just hung out in that prison camp?Rosie asks.Waiting for you and Diego to rescue them?That sounds like a great plan.Diego squints at me.Its a fair point.And it is, but something about it feels right to me.The other boffins said that they were being held in another facility.A school.But they were moved to the camp.And Maya and Hector were brought in separately.We dont know much about how they came to be there.So youre just going to assume theyre enemies?Rosie asks.Im not assuming anything.But we need to ask the questions.I meet Rosies eyes.Were just going to talk to them.Not throw them in a cell.And theyre not our only possibility.Diego and I will also talk to any recently returning ship captains.But we cant just let this go.Rosie sighs and shakes her head.Hes right, Diego says.We need to at least talk to them.Youre making a mistake, she says, eyes on Diego.Were just supposed to accept Mirandas people because ...what?They vouch for them?Well, I vouch for Maya.Are you going to tell me that their word is worth more than mine?They stare at each other for a moment.Then Diego crosses his arms in front of his chest.Rose, Miranda and Ben and Sergei have known these people for months.Youve known Maya for days.Im glad Im not the one Rosies glaring at like that.Fine, she says, short and sharp.Well talk to them.But youll see that this is a waste of time.And I hope that this waste of time doesnt mean we miss the real cause.Well go together, Diego says.Get it done quick.If we get nothing, we look elsewhere.He pauses and looks at me.Yes?Yes, I say.He looks at Rosie.I said I would.Good, Diego says.Are you up for this?I ask, eyeballing Diego.My arm is fine.He flexes it.See?Three weeks have gone a long way toward healing it.Im going.Okay.But to which new boffin?There are two of them.I look over to Rosie, who still seems to be fuming.Well talk to Hector first.I think I see Rosie relax just a little.I probably shouldnt give her that, but I do.Im not even sure why.All right, Diego says.He opens a drawer in a battered cabinet and pulls out a second pistol, tucks it into his waistband.Just in case.I hold up a hand.Were just going to talk.There are still too many questions.Diegos face goes hard.Id like to ask some questions for a change.Well, first we need to find them.Should we let the Keepers know?Diego asks.I shake my head.I think they might tip our hand.Best to go in small.Keep this quiet.I look at Rosie.Can you do that?She just glares at me.Fair enough.Lets go see what we can find out.Going after Hector makes me feel like a lawman, like an old sheriff from a western story.I even have the star pinned to my coat.Throw your irons on the ground.Dont make me shoot, I think.Only this isnt a story.Hector and Maya might hold the information that we need to stop this disease.Maybe even to cure Sergei and the others.My latest message from Miranda said that he was deteriorating quickly.The disease, Enigma, sounds insidious.Ive been afraid of the Bug my entire lifea virus that takes you away from yourself, steals your mind and leaves only your body and urges behind.This new disease turns your body against you.Your mind stays intact, but your body fails.Like some kind of dark reflection.No, I think.Not a disease.A weapon.A biological weapon used to attack.You alright?Diego asks beside me.Youre all tensed up.Yeah, I say, exhaling and willing my body to uncoil.That wont do any good now.Im just ...physical threats I can handle.I know how to put them down.I pat the revolver strapped to my leg.This disease ...I cant shoot it.And the people behind this are operating on an entirely different level.Then I guess its lucky we have Miranda, he says.Rosie doesnt say anything.Her face looks tight.But then Im used to that.Mirandas got a lot to deal with right now, I say.Things were bad enough with Valhalla and the raiders.But now theres all this going on.These people, the Cabal, theyre smart.Incredibly, cruelly, sadistically smart.Diego gives a quick shake of his head.Theyll still die if you put enough bullets in them.I give an answering nod.I guess theres that.At the lab, I ask a few of the boffins if theyve seen Hector.They point me to the far building.Most of them have been put to work on studying this new disease.Problem is, the majority of their protocols have been designed to deal with the Bug.Enigma has some similarities, obviously, based on its design.But its an entirely different animal.An old saying my father used to use comes back to me.A wolf in sheeps clothing.Only this is more a wolf in bears clothing.We move among the boffins, trying to look casual about things.Not like were after anyone.No sense in tipping off our prey.Why dont you both go around the back way, I say.One on each side.That way if he spooks you can cover the exit.Okay, Diego says.I look to Rosie.Shes still not happy, but she nods.And try not to shoot.I know, he says.We dont want to kill him.Or any of the boffins.Theyre going to be scared regardless.Lets try to keep this tight.Got it, Diego says.I move to the building while Diego and Rosie peel off, each heading to the back of the building from a different side.Nice and tight.Hector is inside, bending down over a microscope, a pile of papers stacked next to him, some glassware nearby.I think of Miranda talking about how good glassware is hard to find.I should try to make sure none of it gets smashed.I approach him, what I think is a friendly look on my face.Truth be told, its a little hard not to look tense and worried, but I do what I can.Hector, I say.He looks up from his microscope, noticing me, and looking a bit surprised.Ben, he says.Just heard from Miranda, I say, moving closer.Positioning myself between him and the other boffins.Trying to keep some space around us if it turns violent.That glass could be a problem if he decides to use it.Oh, he says.Does she need something from me?She just wanted to talk to you.Get your opinion on something.I dont know.Some disease vector thing.Oh, okay, he says.Im just finishing this up.When does she want to see me?Now, if its okay.Well, I really should finish up what Im doing.I cant leave it and get back to it without starting over again.Okay, I say.How much time do you need?Well, I dont know.Its a bit delicate.Can you check back in a half hour?Fuck.This isnt going as Id hoped.I thought maybe hed walk back with me and we could get him somewhere safe and question him there.Hector searches my face.I see lines in his drawn face I hadnt noticed before.Its really important, I say.Its about Sergei.I think you should come now.Youll just have to redo the test again later.He frowns.Continues to search my face.Then he shrugs and says, Okay.If its important.Let me just clean this up so someone else can use the station.He removes the slide from the microscope, places it in a case.Turns to shift some papers.Then he turns back, fast, and I feel the bite of pain across my collarbone, just below my neck.I fall back and gasp.And he runs.The pain is still burning and I can feel myself bleeding, but I give chase anyway.I cant let him get away.He runs, as expected, to the back of the building where Diego and Rosie are waiting.I skirt around a stool that he tipped over, then through the door just as a gunshot echoes around me.I see Hector sprinting away, to the western part of the island, where its less populated.Where some of the ships are kept.Diego is on the ground, his gun in his hands, pointed in Hectors direction.Diego looks okay, as in not dying, so I continue, still trying to ignore the burning in my chest.Hectors tall and has long legs, but hes really thin.I hope that means hes likely to tire before I do.But its been a while since Ive run anywhere, and my body has been through a lot lately.I just keep thinking of Sergei and Miranda.And my enemies.The people who think they can fuck with those I care about.Those shadows who want to manipulate the world from the darkness.I cant let them get away with it.I put on a burst of speed and close some of the distance.Hector is just ahead of me, skinny limbs pumping.His shoes are thin and worn.Another advantage I have on him.Thank you, Mal, I think.You helped me more than you know.The distance closes and Im just there, one big jump and I can get him.Were about to head down a light slope, and I want to get him before we hit it.Then my boot catches on somethinga rock, a root, whateverand I go tilting through the air.Im still behind Hector, and I slam into himhardand together we smack into the ground with crushing intensity, a tangle of limbs and bodies.I feel my wind go and Im rolling and the sky is whirling, and when I stop, hes on top of me in an instantand theres something in his hands.Something long and thin.Not a knife.A syringe.And it comes to this againdisease, a worse threat than cutting or stabbing.I grip his wrists and hold his hands away.I can see a bead of liquid on the end.What happens if it falls on me ...?Were both breathing hard.Im stronger, but Hector is letting gravity do a lot of the work for him.Have I mentioned how much I hate gravity?Is that how you did it?I snarl between gritted teeth.Injections?He doesnt say anything, just bears down on me.His face is intense but also strangely emotionless.Calculating.Then I hear another gunshot.For just a second, Hectors attention wavers, his eyes flicking up to see whats beyond me, and in that instant I force his hands to the side and get a punch in on his face, then another one.Then one on his ribs.I throw all my weight to one side and he tips over.I grab hold of the wrist with the syringe and hold it down.Then Diego is standing over me, his pistol out.Let go, I say, and Hector, knowing hes beaten, lets go of the syringe.I grab it gingerly by the non pointy end and snap off the needle.Then I pass it to Diego.You have a pocket you can throw this in?He takes it, and I pat Hector down, taking away the knifea curved, dangerous looking knife, not the kind of thing I would expect from him.Its too late, Hector says, his voice flat.Its already far too late.Diego hands me some rope, which I use to bind his hands.Wheres Rosie?I ask.Diego shrugs.She wasnt there when I got around the back.Fuck.I need you here, I say.But I know, he says.I need to go find her.Then we haul Hector up and start marching him back to Miranda.I take a moment to examine my injury.As the adrenaline starts to fade, the pain intensifies.Theres a gash across the very top of my chest, which scraped against the bone.It just missed my neck, which I assume was his original target.The collar of my coat must have deflected it.That looks nasty, Diego says.Itll keep for a minute, I say.Ive got Hector.You should go find Rosie.Are you sure?Diego asks.I pull my fathers revolver and hold it close to Hector.Im sure, I say.If he gives me any trouble, Ill shoot out one of his kneecaps.And we need to know where Rosie is.Im starting to think I know, Diego says.One big hand massages the back of his neck.Okay.Ill go find her.He takes a quick look at Hector, then tells me, Good luck.Same to you, I say.Then, after he goes, I start marching Hector onward, the revolver close at hand.Hector is silent all the way back.Shes where?Theres this persistent buzzing in my head.A pressure.And the words just arent making sense.We dont know where she is, Ben.Diegos voice is level, but the look on his face says that things are far from right.Its tight, worn, and I see echoes of his torture in it.What did you do?I ask, pointing at the third member of our group.Rosie.Her arms are crossed, and shes leaning back against the wall, not unusual for her, but theres something more in her posture and her face.Something Ive never seen before.It looks like shame.Answer him, Diego says, and his voice is steel.No give.I went to see Maya, she says.The pressure intensifies.So while your brother and I were risking our lives to talk to Hector, when we could have used backup, backup that we were expecting, you left to go ...tip off the other person we suspected?My voice keeps getting louder.You suspected, she says.I step forward and narrow my eyes.And how is that position holding up?She looks away.Stupid, I say.She doesnt respond.Tell me what happened with Maya.She looks up at Diego, as if for help, but his face is like his voicehard.I told her I needed to talk to her, she says.Her voice sounds softer than usual.Hesitant.I felt I owed it to her to let her know that you would be questioning her.I wanted to...To what?Diego asks.She meets his eyes.To give her a chance to prove her innocence.To get out ahead of this.I cross my arms.And how did that go?Rosie flushes.She tricked me, she says.She kissed me, then ...she took me by surprise, got the better of me.By the time I recovered, she was gone.It smells like bullshit.Little Maya against bad ass Rosie?Im about to attack that part of the story but then I catch sight of Diegos face, see the doubt carved into it.He knows shes lying, too.So shes, what, somewhere on the island?Or did you loan her the Osprey during this whole encounter?Rosie glares at me and steps forward, and I brace for the blow.Then, Stop.Diego.Its not a shout, but its certainly a command.I can almost hear a growl behind it.Rosie freezes.Ben is not in the wrong here, he says.You are.She looks up at him, more shame on her face, and something else.Fear?Diego, she says.I thought I had something good.For the first time in ...maybe for the first time.I know you wanted this, he says.But you got played.Its as simple as that.A lot of people are hurting right now, and you let one of our best leads slip away.We need to see if we can find her, I say.Let the Keepers know.See if we can dig her out.It shouldnt be hard.There arent too many places she can go.The only place she could swim to would be ...the small island.Oh God, I think.Alpha.We need to find her, fast.Ill go talk to the Keepers, Diego says.Get them out looking for Maya.He looks at Rosie.Youre coming with me.She nods, her eyes down.Make sure you tell them they need to guard Alpha.Diego frowns.The Feral?I nod.That island is mostly deserted now.It wouldnt be hard for her to sneak onto it and try to break Alpha out.What good would that do?Do you want to find out if a Feral can swim that far?Good point.It may not be her plan, but these people like letting Ferals do their work for them.What will you do?Diego asks.Im going to make sure our prisoner is secure and get ready to interrogate him.We put Hector in one of the quarantine cells because that seemed like the best place for him.Tamoanchan does have a prison, apparently, but that seemed too good for him.Im happy to see the two Keepers standing guard outside the cell.Im surprised to see Miranda.They let you out?I ask.She nods.I convinced Lewis.The spread of the disease doesnt seem contained to people who were infected, and I told him I needed to talk to Hector.Right, I say.Of course shes the best person to ask him questions.She knows all the right ones.Sergei?She shakes her head.I dont press the issue.Where are Diego and Rosie?Miranda asks.I heard they helped you bring Hector in.Not quite, I say.I fill her in on what happened, and she spends a good part of the story shaking her head.Youre okay?she asks.I still feel the burning where Hector cut me.Im fine, I say.One of the Keepers helped bandage me.She nods.So Mayas still out there?For now, I say.Well find her.I try to inject my voice with an optimism I dont feel.She looks at the door to the cell.Then its a good thing we have him.Are you up for this?She looks back at me, and she looks weary.And far older than Ive ever seen her look before.I have to be.I put my hand on her shoulder and give it a small squeeze.She reaches up to it with her hand and gives it an answering squeeze for a moment.Then she pulls away and enters the cell.I wait outside.Im very bad at waiting, but I dont feel comfortable leaving Miranda without backup.Other than the Keepers, I mean.So I wait.Miranda emerges about an hour later, looking even more tired and worn than when she entered.I look at her, the question plain on my face.She shakes her head.He wouldnt talk.Her voice doesnt break, but its on the verge.Not at all?She meets my eyes and hers are bloodshot.Ben...Go take a break, I say.Close your eyes for a moment.Hes not going anywhere.Ben, time is running out.I know, I say.But you cant do anything here right now.Well figure something else out.She looks about to protest, but I say, Go.Youre no use to anyone if youre dead on your feet.Shes silent for a moment, then she nods.Just a short break.I nod and Miranda shuffles off, an invisible weight pressing down on her.Im considering going in to interrogate Hector myself when Diego and Rosie show up.After Mirandas frustration Im hoping for a win, but then I catch sight of Diegos face.Its rigid.What happened?I ask.Diego glares at Rosie, and Rosie looks quickly away.Uh oh.Maya ...got away.What do you mean, got away?While the Keepers were combing the island for her, she was sneaking onto a ship, the Brightwing, and using it to escape the island.She stole an airship?I ask.Diego nods.How did they not shoot her down?She had valid codes, Diego says.How the hell?I ask.Diego shakes his head and rubs at his beard.She obviously planned this for a while.Who knows what shes been secretly doing over the past weeks?He shoots another glare at Rosie, and she looks like right here is the last place she wants to be.I think back to my run with Maya, to the cacheshe was there to see how everything operatedthe islands network, its infrastructure.All she needed to do was charm or sweet talk someone, and shed have everything she needed to get a decent enough lead.Unless...I look at Rosie.I dont see her smile all too often, but right now she just looks miserable.Shes always been one of those people who looks like she belongs everywhere.Until now.I might believe a lot, but I cant bring myself to believe that she set Maya up to escape.Maya was smart enough to figure that out on her own.Doesnt mean Im any less pissed at Rosie.Does the Council know?I ask.Yes, Diego says.Theyre meeting right now to see if we should consider evacuation.With this disease still in play?Theyre scared, Diego says.Another look in Rosies direction.Can you blame them?Even if the Cabal didnt know our location before, they do now.Rosie snaps, whirling on him.You think I wanted this?She throws both arms in the air.She betrayed me, too!Theres a lot of that going around, Diego says.Rosies eyes go wide and she starts to open her mouth, but I interrupt.We dont have time for this, I say.If Mayas gone, then all we have is Hector.And we need to get what we need from him.Did anyone talk to him?Diego asks.Miranda, I say.Only hes not talking.Then maybe we should make him talk, Diego says.Theres something dark and dangerous in his voice.How?I ask.You want to beat on him?Diego looks at me, and theres something chilling in his eyes.Thats exactly what I want to do.I get it.I do.They tortured Diego for days.I bet he has nightmares about it every night.I bet he still feels the pain both from the wounds that havent healed and from the ones that never will.He wants to deal it back.Try to gain back that ground.Try to be the torturer instead.I might feel the same.But...It wasnt that long ago that Captain Danning had me strapped to a table, trying to make me feel like I was drowning.I dont think thats the way to go.Why not?Diego asks.Its what they would do.Its what the Valhallans would do.What they have done.Hes not one of them.No, Diego says.Hes something worse.I agree with him there.And what if he doesnt talk?Or he gives us bad information?Or if you damage him so badly that he dies on us?What then?Diego shrugs.Hes not talking now, so what difference does it make?At least this way we have a shot.He fixes me with a stare.What would you suggest?We make a deal.What?These are manipulators, dealers.We give him something that appeals to him.Some kind of deal that gives him something in return for what we want.Are you fucking crazy?Diegos expression is incredulous.He infected our people, including Sergei, your friend.Mirandas friend.And you want to give him something?Whats all the yelling about, Miranda asks, walking up to us.That was quick, I say.I couldnt, she says.Whats the matter?she asks Diego.Diego shakes his head.Ask Ben.He seems to have lost his mind.Were talking about how we can get Hector to talk, I say.Ive managed to stay calm all this time, but I can feel myself getting angrier the more Diego pushes.Diego wants to torture him.Miranda looks at Diego in surprise.Really?Diego crosses his arms, nods.I think its our best bet.We need information fast.Sergei isnt getting better, and the Council is talking about evacuation, and this disease is still spreading.No, Miranda says.Were not torturing him.Its not right.Fuck whats right, Diego says.Nothing about this is right.We dont have the luxury anymore of thinking in those terms.This is what they would do.If were not willing to use the same tools, then were definitely going to lose.Miranda shakes her head.I would think that youd be the last person to want this.Why?Because they tortured me?They shot Ben, and hes still willing to shoot back at them.How is this different?Because were better than that, she says.If we torture him, how are we different from them?Thats a stupid argument, Diego says.We know what were about.What we want.What we stand for.This is just a tool.For a very specific purpose.Im not even saying to kill him.Just get what we need.No, Miranda says.And you get to decide?Diego says.Im the one researching this disease, she says.Im the only one here who knows what information we need.Well, I think this is bigger than you, Diego says.And I think maybe Lewis will be interested in this.He moves to the door, pauses after opening it.You know Im right.Deep down inside, you know.You just dont want to be the one who does it.So dont.Let me.Then he leaves.Miranda lets out an angry sigh and shakes her head.I turn to Rosie.You were awfully quiet during all that.No opinion?Oh, I have an opinion, Rosie says.I agree with Diego.Only...Yes?I dont want him doing that.Interrogating Hector?She nods.You havent seen him.The nightmares.How it twists him up.Im afraid ...Im afraid that he would lose himself.That he would go too far and then ...not forgive himself.I wont see him go through something like that again.The regret.The punishment.She tilts her chin in the air.I wont.Well, hopefully none of us will have to see that, Miranda says.Although I dont like the thought of Lewis getting involved.We should go talk to him, too, I say.Get ahead of this.It will look better if we can present him other options at the same time rather than after the fact, when hes had time to set his opinions.Good idea, Miranda says.What are our other options?We appeal to them as equals.Convince them to treat us as such.Thats what my gut tells me.You met some of them up on Gastownwhat do you think?Miranda nods.It could work.But it has to be done just right.We push out into the daylight, walking in the direction of Lewiss office.I reach out for Mirandas hand, try to grab it, but she pulls it away and wraps it around her body.Sorry, she says.Its just with Sergei...Her voice catches and she suppresses a sob.Hes not doing well.Well find something out, I say.Miranda sniffs.I almost want Lewis to make us do what Diego wants, she says.If only because it might actually work.Well, after what Rosie said...I break off and look around.Wait, wheres Rosie?A moment later it hits me, and I panic and run back to where were keeping Hector, Miranda on my heels.I burst into the room to catch Rosie punching Hector in the face.When his head lifts back up, a thread of sticky blood drips from his mouth.His face still looks flat, but he smiles a bit.I run and grab Rosie, pull her back.Let me go!No, I say.Im aware that she could probably kick my ass right now, but Im hoping she wont.Hector spits on the ground.Animals, he says.Thinking with your fists, as usual.Thats why youll lose.He spits again.Youre barely a step above Ferals.Miranda moves forward, assessing Hector.An area around his eye and cheek is red, already swelling.And the busted lip.His blood is pooled on the floor.Miranda is staring at it.I get the chills.I know hes clean.That Miranda tested him.But Im just used to staying away from blood.And his is all out in the open.Miranda reaches into a pocket and pulls out a syringe.Miranda, what are you doing?I ask.Help me, she says.Quickly.I dont know what the hell is going on, but this is Miranda and theres no one else I trust more on the planet, so I do what she says.Hold him and roll up his arm.Hector frowns.He squirms a bit, but hes tied to the chair and I hold him firm, rolling up his sleeve.Miranda sticks the syringe into a veinthe mans veins virtually pop from his skinand takes a blood sample.As shes about to pull it out, Hector spits blood into her face.Miranda freezes in surprise.I let his arm go and punch him hard.Miranda moves away, wiping at her face.And I realize what Ive done.Sorry, I say, but I dont know who Im apologizing to.It wont help you, Hector says.Well see, Miranda says.I make sure Rosie comes with us when we leave.What was that all about?I ask.Miranda is moving quickly, back in the direction of her lab.It suddenly occurred to me when I was looking at his blood that if I were going to send people into a hostile situation with a dangerous disease, that I would try to inoculate them against the disease.Can they do that?I ask.She shrugs.They designed the virus in the first place.It wouldnt be hard to develop some kind of method of inoculation.Not with the techniques they seem to have access to.Okay, what good does that do us?I ask.If he has antibodies in his system, it could give us a better idea of what were dealing with.And it would prove that a vaccine is possible.Will a vaccine help Sergei?Her face darkens.No.It wouldnt help people already infected.But it should prevent more people from getting sick.If I could get one made.Well get the rest of the boffins on it, I say.She nods.Back at the lab, Miranda gets to work, summoning all the boffins, giving them orders, explaining whats happening, what she needs them to do.Its a small bit of hope, even if it does nothing for Sergei.I take the opportunity to talk to Rosie.What the hell were you doing?Trying to get answers, she says.She still has that defiant look in her eyes.You dont know all the questions.You wanted him to talk.I can make him talk.You dont get to make those decisions, I say, feeling my anger rise.Her finger presses against my chest, beneath where my cut is, and the pain sparks.I dont recall voting for you.And last I checked, I lived here first.Youre still a newcomer, Ben.I know you think you can just fly in here and take charge and be a big man, but youre not.
