Im an assassin, a Crilshan agent.Im quite used to doing the very thing I dont want to do.Oh, and switching allegiances, Im good at that.Ill bet.The assassin went to speak, but before he could breathe a word the entire cockpit and everyone within it began to tremble.Eighty Four      Blinding flashes of burning light, striking through cruel and rapid diving dowels, collided with the air about them; and their paths were like hands wielding thunder strikes from the heavens.All across the immeasurable horizon beacons and flares of lightning crashed into the otherwise sinister planet surface.A tremor filled roar welcomed the shuttlecraft to the lower atmosphere of Tempest Beta as they descended through the final fragment of flickering purple cloud.Watch out!Avila cried.A forked column shot through the air beside them, almost blinding Justus as he was forced to grapple with the cabin wall.Watch it!Theres another!Where are you going?Justus said.No idea, the blond captain replied.There, Gordian said from his seat.Watch the horizon.What am I looking for?The Crilshan raised his hand and pointed to their left.You see it?Justus moved closer.I see it.Hes right, Ferranti.Head towards it.Ferranti wrenched the x shaped control and the craft weaved its way through the lightning storm, which, it seemed, had become even more intense.In the distance, only visible through the furious light of the storm, there stood a mountain, great and dark and formidable.If you damaged the Chaos, Justus said, and they came down here, theyll have headed for something noticeable.Something like that.They may be waiting.Ferranti pulled the control back and the craft shot downward.Thats assuming they think anyones foolish enough to follow them down here.Knowing Kramer hell be prepared either way.So should we.We have weapons, Avila said.Enough for the four of us at least.Any food?Ferranti asked.Im ready to collapse here.Ill see what stores there are.She moved to the back of the craft.Up ahead the mountain drew closer and the lightning around them struck greater and stronger and louder.And then it stopped.Everything became still and silent; they all held their breath and gazed out at rising and falling upland.Like the eye of a storm the region surrounding the approaching mountain was subdued and noiseless, dark and sinister.They orbited the structure, creating a ring and searching for something, anything that would give them a clue as to the fate of the Chaos.There!Justus said, noticing a path of smoke emerging from the northern side of the mount, buried among the shadowed foothills encircling the mountain.Go through there.Ferranti veered across the plain towards the opening, and Justus sat back beside Gordian.In moments Avila returned with three more coilbolts, four blasters, and suits of armour.Those do?she said.Just fine.Theres something to eat here as well, she said, handing both him and Ferranti a tube of the sweetest smelling foodstuff it seemed hed ever eaten.We have a little water too.Take what you need.They did, though Ferranti hardly had time to eat, hungry as he no doubt would have been, and simply focused on navigating them down and into the great structure leading into the black caverns of the mountain, surrounded but unaffected by the storm above.The craft moved through a series of gaping caves, throwing its light into echoing corners and deep fissures stretching miles below the surface, untouched and forgotten.It took only minutes to reach the end of the path of smoke, and Ferranti planted them down beside the smoking shell of the Fated Chaos, set upon an enclosed cliff face: a narrow plain of rock towering above the black and forlorn system of caves.There was no sign at all of the other survivors.Justus took another eager mouthful of freezing cold sludge, emptying the tube, and then stood.Avila handed Ferranti a weapon and suit of armour, before slowly and warily handing the same to Gordian.Have you eaten anything?she asked her captain.There isnt time now, he said.Gordian stood.Not meaning to interrupt this pretty little picnic, but youre expecting us to go out there.Do we have enough breathing tanks?And have you done any atmospherics?I doubt you will want to step foot out there and find them all dead.The crafts built for two, Avila said, bringing her hands to her mouth in sudden realisation.Therell only be two suits.Then Ferranti and I go, Justus said with a full mouth.What are conditions like out there?Give me a moment.Gravitys acceptable.Temperature down among these caverns is cold, but we can survive it.Ferranti pressed several more commands and leaned back in the seat.Wait a minute.What is it, Captain?Justus moved to Ferrantis side as the captain double checked the results of the scan.Ferranti, what is it?Impossible, he said.Thats impossible!Whats out there?He turned to face them, and said, Air.What?Scans show accurate readings of nitrogen, argon, oxygen, carbon dioxide, all of it.An almost ideal comparison to the terraformed worlds.Not possible, Gordian said.Youve done something wrong.The Captain reached for a lever and pulled it back.The crafts side compartment opened and a wave of cold air poured into the space.What are you doing?Ferranti smiled.I dont get things wrong.He breathed out, his breath forming frost.Were still alive, arent we?Look, if were going out there we have to go now.If we wait around we may not get back out.Justus stood tall and firm and took a deep breath, his heart fixed upon his throat.Well then, come on.Into the dark.* * *  Anna walked as though she were in a dream, unable to wake.Voices surrounded her; movement and light of the armed guard.She stumbled and was pushed on.Her sister hung in the arms of a heavyset soldier nearby.Along the bitter cold and empty passage they tread, slowly and cautiously; and although it seemed the passage, like the dark of the Black Labyrinth, became harsher and narrower the farther they moved, it was clear that the space was opening up.And every so often they would find themselves standing over a deep fissure leading to a black abyss.A dozen soldiers surrounded her and Glana.At the forefront walked Kramer and Ketrass.Though her legs ached Anna walked a little faster, until she could make out what the two were saying.Kramer led the way.Ketrass kept close to him, whispering and looking all around.They were talking about the obvious fact they could all breathe....but we did tests, Ketrass said.I read about the atmospheric samples verified when the station was first established.Spot on, Kramer replied.They were nothing more than samples.A small zone on a Type 5 planet.A decade ago.Something has obviously changed in the last ten years then, she said.But what?Isnt it obvious?I dont know.Us.Kramer glanced down at Ketrass.Erebus has been here for thousands of years, Avne.In all that time I think its unlikely that anything other than our presence has occurred here.And whatevers down here knew we were up there.I expect theyve been waiting for this.Then why are we just walking in, without so much as a knock on the door?Were not prepared for whatevers down here.Kramer looked to her.You may not be, Avne.But Ive been waiting for this my whole life.I am  In control?Kramer smiled.Always.Anna looked up and perceived that the tunnel itself was carved in a way similar to the passageways within Erebus.Was whatever had been up there inside the asteroid now down here?Was that why Kramer brought them down?If the mass of beasts formed the army, then maybe their leaders were here.Maybe Kramer was right.And maybe whatever had cast itself down here was indeed waiting for them.After only a minute or two they stopped moving.Go on, she heard Kramer say.Go down.She peered out from behind her guards; they had reached a fresh cliff face.There was not a drop, however, but a stairway, carved from the rock along the wall to her right.The amazing part, however, was what lay before her: an enormous, circular chamber resembling the centre of Erebus itself.One by one they descended.The soldiers lit several flares, exposing the entire cavity.The rounded room, extremely wide and immeasurably high, stood around a great chasm at its centre, which resembled a maelstrom of carven rock.And upon the far side rose an enormous black stone structure; pillars and images of beasts and creatures undreamed of were visible in the red hued shadows.The edifice stood higher than it was possible to see in the dark.Several of the soldiers spread out about the chamber, moving in a circle around the large fissure at its centre.But a scream filled the chamber.It was Ketrass.The sound echoed around them all as though she continued to scream, but in truth she had backed up and now held tightly onto the old professor.The soldiers backed up immediately, but the flares they had lit upon the far side exposed the cause for panic.Anna bit her tongue, her eyes watering as she gazed upon the body of a man, hanging lifelessly, suspended above the far edifice.His wire like bonds wrapped around him and cut through his limbs, his chest, and his neck.His arms and legs had been removed.The soldiers raised their rifles and prepared to fire.Ketrass fell to her knees.No, she whimpered.Thats ...but thats  Lesper, my dear, Kramer said, wheezing.So he did make it in here.He closed his eyes.But he did not survive long enough for us to find him.Thats what you planned to do?Ketrass asked.In part, but it no longer matters.The worst has been done.You ...You know him?Anna said, her arms around her sister, still only half conscious.He warned me, Kramer said.He feared what would be down here.Well I have realised my fear, and its not what I pictured it would be.It would seem he has suffered a death more terrible than I could have imagined.As though in reply, throughout the chamber there rose a deep, echoing rattle, joined closely by a voice.Declare!it uttered, what is it that causes them to assume he is dead?!Eighty Five      The impact was chilling.Anna screamed, holding tightly onto her sister, backing away from the terror stricken group.Not because the hanging man high above the chamber had spoken.Not because of the words he had said.Not because she was hidden deep beneath a black alien mountain, alone and so far away from her home, but because the black band burned into her wrist had shuddered with the booming around them, and the alien voice rattling through her body had spoken to her alone.Before her the soldiers backed up; they shouted and gathered back together.Stay where you are!Kramer said, a quivering Ketrass attached to his arm.What was it?Ketrass cried.I dont  WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?!Quiet, Avne!the Professor said.Repeat yourself!Say that again!And the echoing rattle repeated, What is it that causes them to assume he is dead?Kramer took a deep breath.Who said that?Him, Anna shuddered, pointing to the man whose body continued to hang limply, while his mouth shifted as though words were forced from his lips.Then he laughed, loud and bellowing.Stop it!Kramer shouted.Lesper!The womankind is powerless and the men but shadows!the limbless man laughed, the rattles coming from across the pit dark rasps of a foul breath.Reveal yourself!Kramers voice trembled for the first time since Anna had met him.Lesper laughed deeply again.STOP IT!REVEAL YOURSELF!Annas heart thudded against her ribs; her whole body trembled with an icy chill.The bracelet around her wrist vibrated and pulsed as the dark words were spoken, and she kept hold of her sister, unable to let go.Once more Lesper laughed a piercing laugh, and Kramer turned to one of the armed men nearby.Shoot him, he said.Shoot him down right now!One soldier did so, striking one side of the limbless puppet.But from the shadows stretched an answer and the startling rattle writhed into a howl of outrage.From the darkness of the far walled structure there emerged a chilling organism: tall, skeletal, and covered in long, black cloth it seemed to peel away from the moulded edifice as though its thin form had been there forever.Bit by bit it stretched itself out of its position and turned to them, revealing a beastly countenance, black boned like the demons of the Labyrinth; except this bore not two, three, or even four, but countless horns extending from its skull, down its piercing chin, and along both outer sides of its body, down insect like legs, and finally to its feet.The creature howled and rattled.Lesper interpreted: They are Zinn!Bow!Nobody moved.Nobody dared.Bow!Kramer dropped to his knees.Zinn?Anna descended slowly.BOW!Nobodys bowing to you!Anna spun to see Antal Justus stroll across the chamber floor, a poised sneer etched into his jaw line.Kramer started, Whatre you But Justus passed by, nudging him in the ribs.Youre the Zinn?he said.Strange name.But I have one question: do you know who we are?The Zinn creature stood tall on powerful struts, and replied with a painful rattle.You are Antal Justus!Lesper cried.Justus hesitated.Well, he said, shaken, Ive heard of human translators before, but thats a little bit too far!BOW!Yeah, yeah!he said.I got that bit.And youre right.I am Antal Justus.Im a good man, a brave man, captain of the Crimson Flux!I know what I am now, and what Im not!His words are merely the words of an infant, riddles of an ill bred!cried Lesper.Antal Justus!Weak and guilt ridden, he flees from those who think they love him!captain, pha!his luck has now run dry!Justus opened his mouth, but it was as though the words had been stolen from his very throat.As he struggled, Kramer rose from his knees.Do you know who I am?he said, his voice high pitched but steady.Xerin Kramer!Lespers voice carried through the chamber.The man who yearns for control, yet cannot hope to command even himself!The professor wheezed, advanced a small step.The ...The current System date?The puppet laughed maliciously.Forty two, sixty two!Your world of origin?A piercing cry came from across the cavern, and sickening blood bubbled up from Lespers mouth, spraying out and into the black pit.Wh ...What was that?Ketrass said.All of a sudden, from the corner of her eye Anna picked up on numerous dots of light appearing in the shadows.Pairs of eyes watched from the dark as the group at once found itself surrounded.Kramer attempted to question the Zinn one last time: Constantine Lespers innermost fear?The demons rattle lowered.To have no real home or family ...to live and die and be forgotten ...to achieve nothing and be with no one at the end!Kramer fell back to the stone floor and said, Theyve been inside Lespers head.The readings said he was still alive, but it was them, feeding on his thoughts, on his knowledge.Which means they now know all that he knew about Erebus.And humanity, Justus said, teeth gritted.Anna continued to watch movement in the shadows, her hands around her sisters cold body.They had to leave before they became surrounded.Everyone remain calm, said Kramer, fear pouring from his voice.Before he had finished, patient creatures having lingered long in the shadows appeared around them, striding slowly forwards, elongated arms hanging tight about lean torsos.Dozens of the Zinn moved to surround the group, obstructing the stone steps and rattling deeply.Anna covered her ears, but it did not work.I think theyre laughing, Kramer yelled over the clamour.Justus dropped to his knees beside Anna.He looked her in the eye, smiled weakly.I knew youd come for me, Antal.Of course.What do we do?Ketrass shouted.There is nothing we can do!Kramer said.All of a sudden the shrieking stopped.It was then that Anna tilted her head, able to see several more of the creatures leaning behind them, while many more crept from the shadows behind the far robed Zinn.They were draped in heavy looking armour which shimmered silver black, much like the bracelet now enveloping Annas wrist with painful jolts.Had they not seen the creature adorned in dark cloth, it would have been nigh impossible to tell what the rest looked like.Justus moved closer to the girls; one hand took Annas and the other extended to the coil at his side.Annas peripherals picked up on several more creatures moving nearby, keeping back in the darkness, dagger like teeth exposed.Perhaps they were afraid.Or simply waiting for orders.She reached for Glana, still unconscious, and clutched her hand tightly.What do we do?Ketrass asked again.What kind of weapons do you have?Kramer asked Justus.Coils, rifles, nothing special.And a craft?Ours was damaged beyond repair.We have one, Justus said.We just need to get past them.Kramer nodded without taking his eyes from the surrounding Zinn.Where is it?Alongside yours.Up those steps.Minutes away.We have to be fast.Then thats what well do.And now thats clear I can do what it was I came down here to do.Kramer revealed a hand sized contraption.With both thumbs he pressed the screen.Fifteen should be enough.Fifteen what?Fifteen minutes, he said, rising from his knees.Minutes?Justus shot to his feet.Its a bomb?!Kramer smiled, activated the detonator, and hurled it across the chamber.It rolled past the Zinn, down, and into the innermost pit.What are you doing?Ketrass cried.Taking back control!Before any of them could utter a response, stone and dust began to fall from above and the ground shook.The group moved close together.Lesper cried out again: They are here, Masterium!Come for them!Masterium, they are here and they are ready to serve!COME FOR THEM!COME FOR THEM!A gargantuan column of black power like the energy within Erebus central chamber surged from the heart of the stone edifice, disappearing through the caverns above.Annas bracelet pulsed fiercely.She knew what it meant.Theyre making contact with Erebus!she yelled.Stop it!We have to stop it!The Zinn were doing something terrible.She had activated the black rock moon, and now they could use it.Long they had been trapped down here, but now they were free.Theyre taking Erebus back!The Masters!Kramer yelled.The Masters never left!Without warning Anna felt cold claws reach around her arms and body, lifting her from the ground.She couldnt move.Frozen in fear.Legs hanging beneath her.She cried out, but the clatter of rifles emptying their barrels sounded around her; the movement coming from beside told her that Glana too had been seized.Justus ignited his crimson coil and moved towards them, but stopped, hesitated.He looked to Anna, held in the creatures cold grasp.She nodded once, slowly, and he understood.NOW!he cried aloud and aiming at the ground beneath her he fired at the Zinns feet.A shocking rattle pounded her eardrums and she fell to the stone floor.He fired again at the demon beside and Glana fell to the rock, the creatures that had held them now pelting for the nearest tunnel.NOW!Justus cried again.NOW, DAMN IT!The singing rattle of rifle fire and rattling demons were at once merged with the startling bursts of bright blue and violet light which now filled the chamber.Upon one side Captain Ferranti appeared from behind a ring of rock, coil and blaster sending the mass of black bone retreating.While upon the other charged Lieutenant Avila and, Anna did a double take  Gordian!Gordian and Avila sprang towards the group, blue coils firing between them, and tearing the air as they fired at the Zinn creatures behind.The three met Anna, Glana, and Justus in the middle of the circle of panicked soldiers.Kramer and Ketrass huddled close nearby.But all around them the Zinn were reforming, attacking in waves of armored might.Some signal!Ferranti said to Justus.Yeah, and you took your time answering!Gordian jerked Anna and Avila out of the way of a Zinn creature hurtling through the group and as one they sent it spinning in the opposite direction.Well were here now, said the assassin.I dont suppose you have a plan?It seemed unlikely.The circle had become too small; the creatures too many.Running.Swerving.Slashing.The group was beyond exhausted.Ferranti dropped his blaster and drew out another coil.He moved to fire upon the rear edge of the attacking line of Zinn, fiercely and precisely demonstrating his well honed aim.Accuracy and determination, however, were no match for the sheer strength of their dark enemies; and though both he and Avila continued to send the violent line fleeing, the three Zinn that came charging through the group sent them both soaring towards the abyss of the inner maelstrom.As they slid down the precipitous plunge Gordian threw himself after them.He bolted for the pit and hurled himself to the ground; reaching out he clutched tightly the only hand still clinging to the surface.Gordian!Justus yelled.Anna held her sisters hand tight.It was impossible.They couldnt hold them off any longer.The Crilshan clutched Ferranti and pulled him from the edge.Lieutenant Mica Avila had been thrown to her death.Though, as Ferranti and Gordian found their feet, breathless and panting, one of the attacking Zinn clenched Ferranti and leapt over Gordian, who tried but failed to bring the creature down.Gordian!Justus cried again as the surrounding creatures moved in for the kill.Anna watched, distraught, as the dark being scaled the nearby wall, heading for a crevice high above.Ferranti, no!Anna relinquished the grip on her unconscious sister and reached for the blaster the Titanese captain had abandoned.And she fired several times, over and over, at first striking nothing but rock, but eventually hitting the fleeing creature and both Ferranti and the Zinn plummeted to the ground.Neither moved, and Gordian, launching a fearless offensive, rushed to recover him.Then, as expected by all, the circle broke.They were vastly outnumbered, and the cries and screams from nearby soldiers were replaced by threatening rattles of fury and bloodlust.Kramer and Ketrass, who had until now been cowering beside her, backed up in terror.Coilbolt booms stopped.Justus grimaced and fell to his knees.When it seemed that hope had left them; when it appeared there was no way out at all; when everybodys energy was sapped and Anna fought to breathe in the thin air, the Zinn stopped advancing.They stayed still and continued to emit their deep, rattling din.All watched, silent and exhausted, as the primary organism marked with black cloth circled the large pit to approach them.Upon the far side the dark energy continued to flare, up through the ceiling to Erebus itself.Anna turned to Justus.Thank you.I am truly sorry, Anna.Before she had chance to reply a hand reached around her mouth and dragged her backwards.Justus cried out and grasped for her hand.Their fingers touched, but she was pulled back across the chamber stone and over dark boulders.Justus followed, but not fast enough.They did not move high, but instead dropped below.Down through a gap in the jagged rock.Down into darkness.And with one last attempt Justus gripped her hand, the scathing rock beneath them tearing at his stomach.He lost her grip.Their eyes met, and a roaring voice called out, STOP!Eighty Six      GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!The dark organisms panicked, their unsettling rattles resonated around them as though there were ten times their number.The Zinn creature clutching Anna backed up and struck the cave wall furiously with its horned skull many times, before releasing her and disappearing into the dark.Justus found her hand, dragged her from the cleft.Upon the far side of the chamber the dark beings had gathered, and above them Lesper was crying aloud one word, over and over:  GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!And at that moment, a light as bright as a thousand red dawns appeared behind them; and they turned to the top of the stone steps to witness a dark shape situated upon the summit.It was from this being that the light branched out, and as he watched the man stood high above, Antal Justus had no doubt in his mind just who it was.Above them Peter Marx closed his eyes, breathed in, and opened them again.From far above the ground the man with the face and body of a helpless boy observed the frenzied scene below.He watched the last of the soldiers disappear into the dark, pulled within by the withered demons, while the mutilated corpse of Constantine Lesper continued to call out, GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!To the centre of the chamber crawled Kramer and Ketrass.Justus and Anna dashed also to the midpoint, where they raised the young blonde girl to her feet.Nearby, the Crilshan Gordian threw Diego Ferranti over his shoulder and gathered among the rest.The boy gazed down at the terror and wonder filling each of their faces.He focused upon Xerin Kramer and listened to him whimper, Peter, bent upon his hands and knees.Yes, the boy said.I am Peter Marx.He reached up and touched his hair, and looked down at his hands, soft palms he had not seen for ten years.He had, at last, returned to his original form, and once again bore his night black hair and impenetrable skin, brilliantly pale.I am not Araman Alwar.I never could be.I never wanted to be.I am Peter Marx.GILAXIAD!Lesper cried.GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!But it was not he who called the word.It was them.Peter raised his arms up high, bloody garments hanging loose about his slender form, and he called out, Long have they waited!Silence fell at once, and every last body stopped to listen.Long indeed have they concealed themselves below this mountain black.Longer than he could guess, did he think it possible!Every last one of the swarthy organisms halted their crying.Their lean collars pointed up at him.This one speaks with an aged tongue!called Lesper.Aged or sharp!Sharp or scornful!This one must come down!Peter looked at the astonishment upon his friends faces; and he laughed, powerful and booming it shook the chamber with a deafening report.This one thinks they may have to wait a short while more!And with a lift of his arms the ground below with dust and rocks rose up, circling the rounded chamber.He concentrated with all his might on the black blazing stone structure upon the far wall, and he reached out his arms, and he tore it down.The edifice warped and buckled, collapsing rock across the entire chamber.But none touched his friends.The black mass of energy at once ceased, filling the room with an eerie silence.Peter knew what he had to do; there was no trace of uncertainty in his mind now as he peered over the edge and watched the survivors of Erebus pick themselves up, preparing to run.Ketrass and Kramer darted towards the stone steps and Justus raised his coil, shielding the girls.Get your sister up, he said to Anna.Get ready to run.We make for the craft!He spun and fired his coil several times, covering Anna and her sister as they hobbled forwards.The Crilshan with Ferranti over his shoulder moved behind.Peter jumped the length of the stone steps, opening his palms and sending a cluster of creatures flying through the air, before landing at the bottom, fusing the air around him into a fierce assault, preventing the Zinn from coming near.Go, go, go!Justus shouted to Anna and the others as they tore up the steps behind him, lugging their respective wounded.Kramer and Ketrass had already made it to the top.He then turned to Peter in the heightening chaos and nodded.You are Peter Marx.Yes, I am, he said.And it has been a long time since anybody sought for me by that name.Peter reached out and the two clasped hands in amity.Words could not describe the warmth he felt seeing Antal Justus alive before him.The rattling cries of the black creatures of Zinn rose from the far fringe of the chamber.Many more had emerged from deep cracks and secret tunnels, enraged and ferocious, while the twisting torrent of wind continued to surge around the chamber, keeping them at bay.Peters eyes widened as he summoned his friend close.Listen to me carefully, Antal.There is so much more behind all of this than any of us realise.Its up to you now.Remember my words: the moon is our ally.Seek the answers on Earth, Antal.If it comes to it, leave me behind, but get the others out.Promise me.Araman ...Peter, I  Promise me!Justus lip trembled; he looked fixedly at Peter and nodded.I promise.Good, now go.Run ...run and dont look back!Whatre you  RUN!Antal Justus holstered his coilbolt and charged for the bordering steps.Two of the dark creatures emerged at that point from a split at the bottom of the steps, and they darted after him.But Peter extended his reach as though his gift had never disappeared, and pulled the Zinn back, hurling them far across the fissure at the chambers centre.Peter turned.His power was back, his strength renewed.All the time he had spent upon Erebusten long years as his gift was hindered by the dark energy, the evil power withinhad taught him nothing more than that his power was part of who he was.And now he would use it to get the answers he had long searched for.As the wind died down, the lofty beings leaned forwards on their barbed legs, ready to strike.But strike they did not.They perceived Peter as though they knew him, knew what he was capable of, as though they had seen him before.He eyed them carefully, walking slowly towards them in the silence, hoping their attention would remain on him long enough for the others to catch up with Kramer and get out.Peter knew what he had to do.As he approached them they moved aside, backing away from a powerful aura which he knowingly emanated as much as he could.They parted together, allowing him through and in between them.Very soon he was surrounded, but he carried on forward until he reached the ringed chasm and surveyed the many mounds of stone stretched out around him.Above swayed Lespers lifeless form.Peter peered over the edge.A human eye could not have found the bottom, but he could see all the way.It was wide and dark, but not limitless.At the bottom lay a hillock of dark bone, the body of a young woman, and the device he was searching for.The screen, still intact, read:      10 : 02  10 : 01      He breathed out.No.10 : 00  09 : 59      He turned back to the Zinn.With a voicestrong, clear, and commandinghe said, I know they are aware of the words he chooses, so now they are going to listen!The dark chamber, filled only with a hazy glow now raining down from the freshly razed opening above, became utterly quiet.They would not come near him, and instead displayed their height in threatening stances.He remained encircled in the middle of the chamber beside the cold pit.His heart racing, Peter spoke again.When I first entered here, when I revealed myself and spoke, you cried out.You shouted ...Gilaxiad.What does it mean?No reply.Silence.Ive heard that word before!Tell me what it means!For so many years the dream of the orb and Gilaxiad had been ingrained in Peter Marxs mind, torturing him.Once the Istron haven below Europa had fallen he spent months without sleep.And when he eventually closed his eyes, when finally he dreamt again, Gilaxiad was there, the black orb was there, Anna and Justus were there.Tell me!At once the clothed Zinn before him spoke.It sounded just like before: a deep and cavernous rattle.And Lespers sonorous voice spoke for it: The prophecy ...Gilaxiad ...the Masterium ...Gilaxiad.He will die ...GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!Then a single Zinn moved.It took three broad steps forward, rising up above him.The dull rattles of the beings behind it continued; the sound resonated around him like a chill wind.And the cloaked Zinn looked down.Long arms caressed his shoulders, and then his neck, and then it began to stroke his frozen face.The horrifying skull of the Zinn closed in, and it made another deep rattle.It spoke to him, and from the edifice behind Lesper exclaimed:      Gone are days of peace and hope;  In their place death and darkness rain;  Lost are memories of power once owned;  And through the one      Lesper stopped suddenly.The rattle of the Zinn ceased.A terrifying hush wrapped the hollow in its entirety.The tall, lean being backed up.And through?Peter said.Through the one what?What comes next?Gilaxiad is a prophecy.Is that what it is?He looked upon the faces of the Zinn creatures, and his heart almost stopped beating.If ever he would have imagined the look of pure terror on their skeletal snouts, they would have looked like this.In the hauntingly dim glow, he watched their heads look past him, up and beyond where he stood.He turned slowly, gazed up.Absolute dread surged through him.No ...please, no.The creatures behind him remained silent, save for the unsettling rattle of their bone like limbs retreating once more.But the excruciating stillness was interrupted by the deep, blood curdling sound of a creature.It was hissing.Eighty Seven      Justus ran, light shimmered before him.Darkness in his wake.No Peter.Up ahead Gordian lugging a barely conscious Ferranti, and to Justus utter relief Anna raced ahead, dragging her sister with her.An overwhelming part of him wanted to stop, to go back and help.He couldnt believe it: the leader of the Istrons was here; his friend, Araman Alwar, had been Peter Marx all along.Almost faltering as he charged through the dark he quickly caught up with Gordian and Ferranti, and pushed ahead.They were so close.The Stellarstreams shuttle was just in front.A loud and roaring drone carried through the tunnel and he reached the clearing, emerging at the same precipice upon which they had landed minutes before.He could see Kramer and Ketrass at the crafts side entrance, and Anna carried her sister toward it.Come on!Kramer said.This way, Anna!She raced forward.Anna, no!Justus cried.She continued on and reached the craft.Kramer took her hand and pulled her towards him, driving his elbow into her sisters semi conscious form and sending her to the ground.He raised his knife and rolled her round to face the others, the knife edge held up against her skin.Anna!Stay back!Kramer yelled.Gordians legs gave way as he reached the rock face and both he and Ferranti collapsed to the ground.Justus carried forwards, coil in hand.All his energy drained, he too wavered on the spot.I swear, he said, you hurt her and Ill  A humming.A drone.Something rang beneath the mountain, as though the caves themselves were chanting a magnificent hymn from hell itself.And from the blackness of the colossal cavern came a twisting craft.It was worn and dark red; and the pilot inside set it down with extraordinary skill upon the cliff face.And in seconds, as the rear gate was lowered, four familiar figures scurried down the access ramp, holding up blasters and dashing forward.A blonde, curly haired woman held her hand up, signalling for the others to stop.The podgy man behind her mimicked the action, and the thin boy and giant girl behind him did so too.Thats not possible!Justus shivered.Adra?Their eyes met.Adra Dimals jaw trembled, a smile forming.Out of the way!came another voice, and from behind the four came charging a bent old woman, shoving the others aside as she made for the action.She spotted Anna, Kramer, and Ketrass at the crafts opening and halted.Anna?Callista?Stay back, old woman, Ketrass said, a flickering red coil at her side.Are you all right, Anna?Callista asked.Dimal moved to her side.Whats going on?Stay where you are!Justus said, raising his coil towards Kramer.You hurt her, and  And youll what?Kramer said, inching backwards, his knife held firmly upon her.And Ill make sure you regret it.Where is he, Captain?the professor asked.Right behind us.Id better make this quick then.Whatever it is you want to do, said the dark skinned old woman, you will stop it now.Kramer hesitated.His grip appeared to loosen, but he didnt let go.I am getting on this craft and not a single one of you is going to stop me.Dimal, Noah, Raj, and Shree all triggered their weapons, but the old woman waved them down.Drop the weapons, he said, or I slit her throat.He looked to Justus.And I very much doubt that this one will heal.Justus nodded to the group, and they all deactivated their weapons, dropping them to the ground.Kramer chuckled.You had the chance.You had the opportunity to do something that mattered.Im doing something that matters.I know why I came to Erebus now.He looked to Avne Ketrass.Do you know why you did?You saw whats right down there!she screamed.Somebody has to fight it!Were not alone anymore.The stories were true!We can fight it, he said.But not like this.No one else has to die.Ibrahatima katha, Kramer said.As they say on Crilshar, let the darkness run through your veins like deep, untainted blood.Youre mad!Dimal cried.The darkness inside Erebus will not rise if we fight it, he said, stepping to the edge dragging Anna with him.And we will fight it.There are more of those creatures out there, and we have to be ready  We will be.We have to show them that we are strong!And our strength is our humanity.Put the knife down!Humanity is weak!Humanity has never been weaker than it is today.To say that it is a strength is a contradiction, nothing more.Kramer, put down the knife.Please, the old woman begged, swaying where she stood.Darkness alone can fight darkness!Justus stepped forward.I wont let you do this.Kramer took a deep breath.Then you leave me no choice.The blade left Annas neck as he raised it, making to plunge it into her  NOOO!A sudden beam of blue discharged as though from nowhere.Kramers hand burst into soaring fragments, spattering both Anna and the ground with small pieces, and they were both hurled to the floor, where Kramer shook and howled in a fit of excruciating cries.Justus charged forward as Kramer reached out for the knife, scrambling for the blade amongst the slivers of his shattered hand.He kicked out at Anna, picked up the knife, and  Justus kicked Kramer in the face, knocking him back.He turned to see Ketrass raise the crackling coil towards him.Im sorry, she said as Adra Dimal appeared behind her, her fist landing a blow across her face.Ketrass collapsed beside Kramer, whimpering.The old woman scurried across and Anna jumped into her arms; she pulled her to her feet, and everybody gazed across the cliff face.At the bottom of the Crimson Fluxs ramp there stood a young girl, a smoking blaster in her hands.Her red hair was darker than a setting surrogate sun, and the crimson ships crew turned to her, stunned.Aron Veryan!Justus cried, and he fell once more to his knees.The young girl grinned nervously as the others rushed to her.Kramer stirred and cried aloud, almost in shock, My hand!My hand!You took my hand!Justus picked up Ketrass coilbolt and handed it to Adra before picking up the shaking man.Youre coming with us.Dimal, tie him up in the back.Her too, he said, motioning to Ketrass.Me?she whimpered, shaking.Yes, you.You chose him.You chose wrong.Now live with it.The crew of the Flux hauled Kramer and Ketrass up and into the crimson beauty, while Ferranti and Gordian, though exhausted, found their feet and moved on board.Ferrantis arm was broken.Justus rushed to help Anna and her half conscious sister up.Anna continued to weep in the arms of the old woman, who held her in a cradling embrace.Now now, she whispered tenderly, thats certainly not the Anna I know!Justus took the womans arm.How did you know we were down here?I followed a feeling, she said, throwing him off.A feeling I havent felt in fifty years, but one I have never forgotten.A feeling which pulled me down here.What is it?Anna asked.The old woman gazed at the nearby passage, and seized Justus by the collar.Tell me now, she said, where is he?Eighty Eight      Peter Marx looked up.All his senses scanned the dark chamber and the tunnels beyond, past the army of the Zinn as the horror of the beastly presence tore their cries asunder, and like a ferocious flash of lightning out on the planet surface, for one split second he saw her.She was there.The last Istron had come.The hissing rang out again.Peter turned to peer upon the hanging body of Constantine Lesper, upon which rose the hair raising outline of the beast.The same creature that had driven Lesper mad and followed him into the shuttle, no doubt causing the ship to hurtle down here; it had waited with the body, and now further prey had arrived.Subject Sixteen.With a roaring snarl it dropped from Lespers body onto the chamber floor and rose up before charging headlong across the piles of stone at Peter and the Zinn.Peter searched his psyche and focused, and looked into the mind of the creature.With a snap his neck cracked back, falling ......he collapsed onto his back.A ringing pain shot through his head.He opened his eyes and jumped to his feet.A hand clutched his shoulder.He spun.Professor Xerin Kramer stared back at him, clean cut and wearing his usual black coat and dark partial face covering.Lespers voice called out in the background.Where am I?Whats happening?This way, Captain, Kramer said with his harsh, poised nuance.Peter followed; only it was not his body.The cave and the dark chamber suddenly disappeared.He walked behind the Professor through the black rock and into Section Six, not speaking a word; and he halted before the same sixteen metal hatches he had been shown upon his own visit, under the guise of Araman Alwar.What a perfect disguise it had been.Peter had known the true Araman upon one of the moons of Bravoral.The boy had indeed been among the brightest minds he had ever met, but Araman had been conquered by his own talent and ultimately taken his own life.It was at that time that Erebus had first been discovered.Peter had originally been upon Bravoral in his investigation of the inexplicable disappearances of several eminent scientists from various fields including astrobiology and xenopetrology.Commander Constantine Lesper had arrived on the moon to visit Araman after Peter made sure his academic project became eminent enough to attract the attention of whoever was gathering the prominent scientists.Without the true Araman to attend Lespers invitation, Peter had altered his appearance and taken on the boys identity; and in that way found himself summoned to the top secret station, Erebus.The metal hatch before him rose, revealing the darkness and the ominous creature within.The ill omened sensation of dj vu flickered across his mind.He looked to either side at the Professor and the Commander, both of whom were sporting avid smirks.It had only been upon arrival at Tempest Beta and the orbiting station that Peters gift unexpectedly ceased.At first it was unnoticeable; but over time he began to age normally; he started to feel things he hadnt felt in so many years: vulnerable, fearful ...weak.Unable to leave, and without the power to force his way off the station, he was totally and utterly helpless.Though he knew something was interesting about the station, something within which had even stripped him of the power to heal, he could never have guessed the evil they had woken.Kramers hand rested on his stiff shoulder and the beasts unmistakable hiss filled the black walled room as the light flared on and off, forcing Peter to step back.Captain Berenguer, the Professor said.Dathlan, are you all right?Yes ...err ...yes, I am, Peter replied tentatively.But it was not him speaking.Somebody was using his voice.Dathlan Berenguer: the previous captain of Erebus station.No!Now you have seen for yourself a physical sample of the fifteen specimens, Lesper said, we need your go ahead for the trial.What trial?Peter asked.Subject Sixteen, Kramer answered.I was under the impression youd read the file we delivered you.Peter frowned.I did.But I assumed it was all hypothetical.You cant really be ready to try that thing on humans!Ready, equipped, and more than willing.The Professor paced around the table towards him, angling his head with arms folded.Peter, controlled by the body he currently occupied, took a deep breath.No.Kramer unfolded his arms and began tapping his face covering as though beating out the rapid rhythm in his chest.We cannot do this without your support, Dathlan.Peter thought quickly.He was not in control because this wasnt really happening; he was suffering a vision; he was witnessing what was contained inside the beasts mind; the beast created on Erebus.But it was not a vision.It was a memory.He spun and moved for the exit, but Kramer blocked his way.Get out of the way, Xerin.Only when you start to see things from our point of view!Suddenly filled with panic he opened the hatch, but Kramer slammed it shut.Imagine what we could achieve!he said; the progress we could make!Dathlan Berenguer stepped back.But at what cost?Lespers voice sounded from behind him.Were done persuading.Either hes in or hes out.Dathlan looked his commander in the eye.Im out, he said.And so are you.SLAM!A fist made contact with his face, throwing him backwards.As he twisted, face numb and vision dazed, he watched Lesper pull a heavy metal bar from behind him.He raised his hands in vain as Lesper brought the bar down swiftly.A dull pain preceded hell.Eighty Nine      Peter opened his eyes.He woke to the sound of dark, skeletal creatures, crying and calling and screaming and bounding wildly to and fro as the horned beast split in many directions at once, ripping and shredding and tearing to pieces whatever it could get its claws into.Blood and bone was everywhere.He stood.The beast spun and charged straight for him.He held out his arms but nothing happened.The creature continued forwards and Peter threw himself to the ground; the beast flew past him, scraping its claws across his face, and disappeared over the edge of the pit.His gift had no effect.But how?!Peter touched the bloody wound above his eye.It hadnt healed!He picked himself up and charged past the remaining Zinn, up the circling steps, and away from the hysterical chamber.His old friend had come for him.Lucasta was waiting just beyond the tunnel.He could still make it out alive; but there wasnt much time.Only minutes until the explosive detonated, burying everything beneath dense, dark, alien rock.He tore through the tunnel, his returning enhanced vision lighting the way, making several metres with each leap, running faster than he had run in years.In no more than a minute he arrived at the tunnels end.And there he stopped, dazed and entranced, as the old, frail, but resilient form of Lucasta stood before him.She turned and stared back.She no longer looked as he remembered, but the meeting of those two ancient souls was like the light cast as the suns rays strike the moon and splendid beauty is all that follows.They rushed forwards and embraced.After being apart for half a century, neither could believe it was the other stood before them.He was her guide and her strength; she was his love and protector.Peter couldnt find the words to say, and simply held her tight, tears streaming down his flushing face.She looked down at him, kissed him on the cheek, and held his face in shaking hands.You look just like you did when we parted, Peter.And you Lucasta ...you ...you look so ...Old?He smiled.Lucasta, we need to leave.Not yet, Peter.We have no time  NO!I have waited long enough.Allow me this!She hugged him again.Her body felt frail to hold.Ahead, beside the collapsed craft and the Titanese shuttle carrier, he saw a strange, dark red ship, ultimatt engines loud and deep.Everybody but Antal and Anna were onboard.They could finally leave.Lucasta leaned back and stroked his cheek, beaming broadly.How did you know to come here?he asked.I received your call, at long last.We were given your coordinates and I followed your life sign down here.He couldnt believe it.Lucasta, he said, a shudder sinking down his spine, I didnt send a call ...WATCH OUT!* * *  This was it.Their final chance to leave.But as Anna felt Justus hand push her out of the way as he cried aloud and jumped towards Peter and Callista, she looked up and recoiled at the sight he had already spotted.A rumbling shook the ground, rattling broke upon her ears, and down the tunnel there charged countless howling forms.The Zinn were coming.Blood thirsty and ferocious they stampeded through.Outta the way!declared a voice and from out of the crimson ship the blonde, curly haired woman stuck her head.Smiling through rose red lipstick she opened a crate within the craft and out poured a dozen barking beasts.Almuits!Justus cried, backing away from the ramp and grasping Anna rigidly.The frenzied canines charged past Peter and Callista and tore down the tunnel at the advancing Zinn, clashing in a rain of blood, fur, and bone.Growls and rattling howls echoed back, and the alien beings disappeared into the shadows.Justus laughed loudly with nerve filled joy and Anna made ready to move when she spotted something.A shadow loomed.Her scream went silent.The shadow hung over the two Istrons.Callista caught a glimpse and stepped back.Peter was thrown aside and into the cave wall.Callista!Anna cried, reaching out, but Justus held her back.Callista peered up at the powerful demon as it rose above her, horned head moving from side to side.She did not run, but raised her arms to find nothing happened.The beast knocked her back to the ground.The creature, larger and greater than the beasts within Erebus, advanced on the old woman.It hissed piercingly and went to strike  The ground collapsed beneath it.Peter Marx stood tall behind the beast and stretched out both his arms, causing the ground to fall through.Another bellowing hiss.Peter clenched his fists and brought down the ceiling from above.Stone and debris rained down, halting the beast.But it could not be stopped.It rose up once more as though the rock around it was nothing but sand.It moved again for Callista.A groaning rose above it and the smoking remains of the craft nearby soared through the air.Justus dove in between and pulled Callista back.From nearby the mountain of metal which made up the Stellarstreams shuttle also lifted; and Peter caused the two to collide, crushing the beast between them.Anna helped Justus drag Callista back towards the dark red ship.We have to go, he said.Kramer set a timer.A minute or two and this whole place is gone!Go!Callista.Go inside!But it was not over.Anna watched helplessly as the dark life form tore the crafts apart like paper and emerged once more.Peter was stranded on the other side of the demon, which twisted and stared at him, winding its neck left to right, perverted horns casting a looming shadow across his bleeding face.Scarlet trickled down over his eyes; there was nothing he could do.As the beast stepped towards him Peter cried, I know who you are!Ive seen it.I know what they did to you, Kramer and Lesper.You didnt deserve it!The beast stopped.You are no demon!Peter screamed.You are the Captain!You are Dathlan Berenguer.You are my friend!Anna froze.WHAT?Justus looked to her.Whats wrong?Dathlan Berenguer ...my ...thats my  No!cried Callista, taking hold of Anna and dragging her onboard the craft.Antal!Peter called.You have to go!Not without  There isnt time!Keep your promise!No!Anna screamed.We cant leave!PETER!The great beast turned and perceived her silently.Callista pulled her back and Justus stepped between them.But from behind it erupted a blinding burst of flame.It gushed forth from Peter, consuming the beast, which turned, unthinkably enraged, and threw itself at the great leader of the Istrons, who in turn launched himself forward; and their clash rained rock and dust throughout the cave like a storm of meteors.Callista drew Anna back and Justus wrenched the hatch closed.But through the clouded porthole Anna watched Peters indomitable expression as he tussled with the creature ...her father ...and finally threw himself forward, disappearing over the edge of the caves precipice, dragging with him the beast.Father!She attempted to cry out, but no sound surfaced.Struggling furiously against Callistas resilient grip she realised there was nothing she could do.They were going to leave Peter behind.She charged up to the cockpit where Justus and the blonde woman now sat.She fell at his knees.Please, stop!We can save him.She looked to the woman.We cant just leave him!But Justus said nothing.Paying no heed to her cries he lifted the ship and pushed them through the vast, winding caverns towards the purple flashes of light in the distance.Tears falling down her face she stood, holding her head in her hands, crying, He knew my father!We need him!Callista needs him!WE HAVE TO GO BACK!Swerving through the caves deadly interior Justus said nothing, and held his head down, focused, though he wept silently.And at once a blinding flash of light called out behind.Everything shook.Anna fell the wrong way and landed on her back.Hold on!Justus shouted.Anna looked up.The flashes of lightning ahead called them closer, the flames and heat behind the ship pulling alongside.Come on!Justus screamed.Come on!Anna rolled to the side.There knelt Callista, who pulled her up and held her close, rocking her from side to side as they were thrown about the ship.Ferranti lay with Glana nearby.Gordian knelt beside, his head bowed down.A loud and formidable drone filled the ship and the bodies of everyone onboard.From the cockpit up ahead came a blinding light, and Anna, leaning into Callista with her head buried deep, thought and felt no more.Ninety      Silence.Calm.Scenes of light and peace passed through her; pale mountain peaks; the gentle singing of water on rock; folding valleys beyond flowing red fog.Relief flushed through her body as Anna breathed slowly and gazed up at a pure white ceiling.She lay still for a long time, unable to recall the events which had led her to be lying there.Before long a cascade of memories stormed her mind, and the full realisation of the past few hours forced her to shut her eyes.When she woke again the shock was less harsh than before, though the sorrow could not be matched.She sat up, having been tucked warmly into a pale sheeted bed; and in the silence of the room, interrupted only by the light beeping of monitoring machinery, she gazed across at her sister, who lay also in a tranquil peace.Just like an angel, she thought.She looked to her other side, where Diego Ferranti slept.His face was pale and covered in scalding scratches of fresh scarlet, while his arm was strung up and pointing to the ceiling.Carefully moving from her bed, her leg throbbing twinges of tender agony and the fair hem of her white robe sweeping along the floor as she walked, her sisters bed took the weight of her light form.She brushed the blonde hair from the sleeping girls eyes.Oh, Glana, Im so sorry.How did I get us into that?I promise you: I will do everything in my power to protect you and the baby.As she sat watching her, Glanas eyes opened, and for one long, blissful moment they merely stared at one another.Anna.She smiled.How do you feel?Glana glanced up groggily and nodded.Im okay.Anna smiled.Good.Glana has a clean bill of health, said a kindly looking man, standing with his arms folded in the open doorway.Whatever happened to her back there has had no permanent impact on her or the baby, as far as we can tell.Im Noah, he said, moving towards them.A friend of Antal.Is he  Hes just fine.A little too fine if you ask me, but no one ever does, so ...He stopped and grinned.Hows Ferranti?Your captains doing well.Hes asleep, though its exhaustion for the most part keeping him down now.And Callista?Better than ever, he said.Everyone is.Not everyone, she thought.A quiet moment followed before Glana asked the question Anna had been holding back.Do we know the babys sex?Well, I do, Noah teased.The two sisters leaned forwards expectantly.Err, well, Miss Berenguer, youre going to have a little boy.Anna squeezed her sisters hand; they both looked at each other and beamed.Anyhow, he said awkwardly, Ill leave you two to it.And he shuffled from the room, closing the door softly behind him.Without hesitation Glana threw herself forward, and Anna embraced her firmly.She held her for a few minutes in a calm and peaceful silence.They were safe.For the first time in so long she could relax knowing everything was going to be okay.Im so sorry, her little sister wept.Jon and I  So he is the father?Glana nodded, head down.Say nothing more of it, Anna said.You and the baby are out of harms way, and were going home.Thats all that matters to me anymore.Yes, Glana said.Yes, youre right.* * *  Noah Nuveen walked across the Stellarstreams open dock and made for the crimson ship.Sat upon the rear ramp was the crafts crew; and Noah gave his captain a low nod.Justus smiled back.Anna and Glana were fine.Good, Justus thought, before clearing his throat and gazing down at his friends.Ahem, everyone hear me?Noah, you listening?Always, Noah answered, sitting down on a metal crate and grinning nervously as a towering Shree stretched her arms around him and placed her purple, fluffy hat on his head.Good.He looked at each member of the group before him.Beside Noah and Shree, Dimal stood next to Raj, who had been explaining the theory of space travel to an excited Aron Veryan.Sat upon another loading crate, she laughed and shook her head constantly in disbelief.Before you start drinking, he said, where youll no doubt forget this conversation anyway, I just want to start by saying what a complete and utter buffoon I am.No one answered, though Dimal nodded tactlessly.I should never have left you, he said.And if its any kind of solace Ive been through hell these past weeks.Every moment of it I wanted to be back with you.I pushed you away when all I wanted to do was pull you closer.I get it, Raj said.Me and Shree forgive you.Its just that easy?Dimal said, nudging Noah out of the way and sitting upon the box instead.Nice suck up routine.Practise it much?All night.Well I for one would be honoured to have you back, Noah said, fighting off purple feathers.In the last week alone Ive been shot, stunned, slapped, and thrown from a sixty storey tower!Youd make a good captain, Dimal mumbled with a smirk, and the others laughed.Noah shrugged off the taunts.Aside from your new haircut, he said, which I think suits you more than the dirty old mop, while you were gone I was forced into more than my fair share of reckless exploits!You made a brilliant action hero!Raj laughed.Thats what scares me.Justus smiled, simply happy to be back where he was meant to be.He looked to Aron Veryan.And you.She blushed and gazed at her feet.You saved our skin back there.Youre definitely worth more than most.As far as Im concerned, he said, looking to Dimal, who nodded her agreement, youve earned your place on the Flux.The red haired girl beamed and clenched her fists in exhilaration.Just remember, Aron, that life here isnt all blaster wielding bar brawls.Its hard, and he looked to Dimal again, and then to his tattered boots youre not here to replace Kaara.Understand that.I do, she squeaked.And by the way, Dimal said, focusing her attention on a grinning Rajkumar, dont lie to me again.I know it was you who let Aron hide on board.I think maybe its ration duty for you for the next month.Raj rolled his eyes and smirked at Aron, before clapping his hands together.Well, alls well that ends well.Now can we drink?Theres just one more thing, Justus said.Something important.Ninety One      Fear of loss.Fear of losing oneself.Fear of losing ones dreams.All can lead us to insane decisions and actions.Callista stared across the empty dining table at Anna and Justus early next morning.But have no regrets.Things have a way of not turning out the way you expected.The journeys not yet over.The two nodded and glanced to each other.Justus had just finished revealing to them the Moon and Triangle mark upon his left wrist, and had explained all he could of Edgar Mokrikovs silver journal.It was now safe within Callistas cloak, and she would have it translated from Rovaa as soon as she was able.So much confusion, the old woman said.So much scheming and conspiring.But now we must decide where our destinations lie.You must both look forwards now, not back.Anna took a deep breath.Im sorry for what Ive done.Im sorry I brought Glana with me and caused so much evil.Whatever you have caused, child, not an ounce of it was of evil intent or doing.But I must accept a great portion of the blame.If I had given you more guidance, perhaps you wouldnt have felt so lost, and would never have considered leaving.And for that Im sorry.Even still, she said.I was foolish to think that running away from Titan would solve my problems.If my uncle says Im not ready to join the Titanese Guard then Im not ready.I just have to wait until he decides I am.The old Istron felt a great sense of pride swell within her at Annas words, and she smiled kindly to let her know that.She chose not to tell her the devastating news given to her from Adra Dimal that her uncle had taken Titan to war in her absence.Not yet anyway.She herself was unsure of whether Ruben had scored successful backing to do so.The Systems were once again at war.Now along all paths the future was uncertain.Besides, Anna said, well soon have a new baby in the family.Glana needs me now more than ever.That she does, Callista said, before turning to Justus.And what about you?Will you return to Titan with us?Im sure youd be very welcome, and much needed.And Ive gotten to know your rabble of a crew quite well.Theyre certainly an interesting lot!Interesting is one word, he said.Ive never felt closer to a group of people.And being away from them these past weeks has made me realise it.Theyd stand by me in anything.I should never have left them.But, he said, fixing his gaze on Anna, its for that reason that I cant go to Titan with you.My crew has agreed to return to Earth with me, so Im going back.Are you sure?Anna asked, the disappointment evident in both her voice and expression.More than Ive been about anything, he said.Youve stopped running.I have to stop too.Plus ...He hesitated.Plus?Callista prompted.Justus thought carefully.Plus ...Peter said something to me back below Tempest Beta.The things happening on Erebus didnt begin on that station.Those responsible are still out there, and if the Beasts and the Zinn arent the only creatures out there then this isnt over.Peter said to me, The moon is our ally, Antal.Seek the answers on Earth.I dont know what he meant, but  Well if Peter Marx told you to go to Earth, Callista cut in, then theres no doubt you must do so!He nodded.I have to make sure that Peters sacrifice wasnt worthless.That it wasnt in vain.The moon is our ally.Callista had no idea what it meant.That disturbed her almost as much as her own journey.The elderly man Dimal had met on Mars had sent the Flux for her.Hed known of her presence on Titan as well as where to send them for Peter, Anna, and Justus.So who sent the call when it had obviously not been her master?The old Istron, though troubled by this, had lived long enough to know that if something was meant to be known, she eventually would discover it.Patience is all it would take.That, she said, shaking herself awake, is your own quest, Antal; a pursuit you must take on your own.Be careful.You can trust no one.But the pressing question we must now ask is what we are going to do about your echo.Justus frowned.My what?Your gift from Peter.I sense youve received an echo of the masters gift.You touched him, did you not?As we parted, he said, nodding, we clasped hands.I hadnt even thought about it.Understandable, Callista said, given the moment.What will he do?Anna asked.He will go to Earth.He will do as Peter said.And if he is meant to, then he will use his power for whatever purpose he chooses.Is there any hope?Anna asked.For Peter, I mean.The stories said he couldnt die, that he was immortal.Callista bowed her head.If he survived the explosion, which at this moment is so unlikely, he would still be buried beneath tonnes and tonnes of rock, rubble, and dirt.Immortal he can still be ...she closed her eyes ...crushed, and ...and even then hes on a hostile world in a system with little sunlight, millions of miles from human civilization.I do not think there is much hope, but right now there is nothing we can do but leave.Its what he wanted us to do, Justus said.Youre right, Antal.Anna opened her mouth, but quickly closed it and looked down.What is it, child?Its not important, she said.Not now.If ever there was a time, it would be now.Speak.Anna sighed lengthily.It was something Ferranti said.Its been a thought thats bothered me, especially since the orb from our dreams, inside Erebus.Go ahead.Ultimatter, she said.What of it?Where does it come from?Callista laughed.I think you already know the answer to your question, Anna.Where?said Justus.Where does it come from?Well, Anna said.I think she means Peter.Peter?Really?Callista smiled, and looked down.It was an astounding fact shed long forgotten.Petra Marka, she said.Two thousand years ago he was influential in the foundation of ultimatter technology.An everlasting power source.Petra Marka is of course Peter Marx.Justus lay back in his chair.So his gift ...Is how he did it, yes.The same life force that ran through the veins of the Istron people, the very power that flows through me, and now you, Antal, is that power.The very same power that Peter Marx, so long ago, shared with all Humankind.Ninety Two      A merry waltz rang through the halls of the Stellarstream that night, the second night in a row, and it was joined by the sound of laughing, music, singing, and drinking.The captain of the ship had woken from his unwitting sleep thirsting for a bottle or two of his favourite wine; and though Noah and Callista had patched up his broken arm, Ferranti nevertheless committed himself to making the most of consciousness before the return home.It seemed the crew of the Flux was more than willing to aid him in this endeavour, and after the previous weeks adventures, though they could hardly be logged as such, Ferranti left the Berenguer girls safely in the medical bay and joined the crew of the Crimson Flux in his quarters.As the early hours set in, the Stellarstreams guests said a hiccup filled goodnight and headed for their bunks, leaving Ferranti sat in one corner, with a now silent Gordian in the other.Amid the discomfited stillness, the latter stood and went to leave for his room.Ferranti stood also, and walking quickly blocked the open door.Silent and grim, Gordian took hold of his unbroken arm.The other, wrapped tightly in a sling, spiked into painful spasm.Gordian, he said, we need to talk.Yes, I think we do.He released the Captains arm.Come with me.Ferranti led him from his private quarters; down deeper into the vessel, knowing perfectly that the Crilshan knew where they were going.After minutes of nothing but silence the two entered the holding area, and looked down at the clear, reinforced cube caging, fully exposed on all sides.Within sat Xerin Kramer and Avne Ketrass.Ferranti watched Gordians eyes widen at the small cells.He knew he couldnt trust the assassin, regardless of whether he had saved his life down on the lightning planet or not.But he also couldnt deny that he needed his help if he was going to get the vessel back to Titan.Alone he couldnt do it, but together they would have a chance.For several minutes they stood still, ill at ease.Then, out of the quiet, Gordian attempted to speak, seeming to stumble with his words, searching for something to say.Eventually he murmured, I was seconded.What?My lords sent me away.I was seconded to another order.I was given a mission.I dont know who by.I was told to stop Titan sending aid to Rotavar, and to remove Berenguers family.He looked up into Ferrantis eyes.What do you want me to say, Gordian?That all is forgiven?That the past is the past and the future unsoiled?No, he said.I just cant be locked up again.I cannot.All my life Ive been a slave to the system, to Crilshar.Ive done terrible things for that system.But Ive never been part of it.I fooled myself into thinking that it was what I wanted.But its not?Perhaps the Crilshan had woken up.Seeing what they all saw down on that planet would be enough to change anyones view.I want to trust you, Ferranti said.But that doesnt mean I do.We got the girls back though.You kept your word, so Ill keep mine.What will become of them?he asked, nodding towards the clear cage.Ferranti shrugged.Time will tell.When we return to Titan I imagine theyll be pressed for information on what was happening back there.The Alignment will be forced to act after we provide our evidence.And what will become of us?You too may be called upon, Gordian.For the moment, however, the pact we made on the way down to Tempest Beta is finished.Then I suggest we make a new one, Captain.Go on.Together, we pilot the vessel back to Titan.The lieutenant and I did it, and with both our expertise it wont be easy, but it will be possible.Once were there, you set me free.And where then will you go?Far away, Gordian said.What we saw down there has given us all perspective.Ive existed surrounded by nothing but war and chaos.I dont want it anymore.When we get to Titan, we go our separate ways.Ferranti nodded, eyes dimmed.So be it.* * *  Ketrass watched the Crilshan Gordian through the clear walls of the holding cell.He and the blond captain had been talking for some minutes out there.Now and then the Crilshan had glanced in her direction as though she could hear what they said.She couldnt.When the exchange ended, the Titanese captain turned and Gordian went to follow, a sickly sneer sweeping across his pale features, his dark eyes, and his thick line scar.He winked at her and was gone.Avne, Kramer groaned from behind her.Avne, please look at me.He reached for her shoulder.She shrugged him off and sighed.Just tell me that this was meant to happen, she said.After all these years, tell me it wasnt for nothing.You always trusted me, he said.When no one else did you saw that I knew what I was doing.She turned to him and stared at his eyeshe hadnt noticed it was green beforethe other masked once more by the dark metal covering; and she glanced down at his dressed stub of a hand.You were right.No, she said.You were never in control.Stop deluding yourself, just once!He leaned in close and brought his lips to her ear.We were never going to get away.If we had run they would have found us eventually, with or without Peter Marx, whether wed fled to the far corners of the Alignment or to Titan itself.But the research we did on Erebus has to remain hidden.Thats what matters now.I understand that.And so do you.You have the research?He nodded.Where?Kramer raised a single thin finger and brought it up to his dark metal face covering.Tap, tap, tap ...tap, tap, tap.Ketrass smiled.Its in there?Yes, Avne.We will fight the evil we uncovered.And as long as the research remains hidden, as long as all that we discovered these past years is kept safe, unseen, and ready for us to use when the time comes, there is a chance.Avne Ketrass nodded.Then Im with you.Ninety Three      Antal Justus blue eyed gaze met with Annas.His ship and crew stood waiting behind him, prepped, supplied, and all set to depart for Earth.I dont know what to say, Anna.You dont have to say anything.But I ...I feel as though I should.I know I should.Tell me what you feel.Im glad I met you, Anna.And Im glad I met you.Im truly sorry about your father.She smiled weakly and looked away, forcing herself to forget the creatures face.She focused on the crew of the Crimson Flux on the other side of the Stellarstreams cargo hold, now saying goodbye to Captain Ferranti.Noah and the giant woman were climbing aboard, while the young man and red headed girl smiled and laughed.What did Callista say?he asked.Was it really your father down there?Anna nodded weakly.Callista had spoken to Xerin Kramer, who had explained that her father, Dathlan, had been part of the Erebus project for the past ten years.Though who or what had stopped him from contacting his home and family in all that time remained a mystery.Like I say, Im sorry.Its all right.He reached out and held her cheek.At least I know the truth now.At least I know youre one of the legendary Berenguers, and not a Driad.Dont I look like a Driad?No, he said.You look like a legendary Berenguer.Im not legendary, Im stupid.I ran away from home.Im a coward.No.Youre the bravest girl Ive ever met, he said with a gentle smile.Your uncle is proud to have a niece like you.And Im certain your absence will have proven that to him.Anna looked deeper into his eyes, and resolved to attempt one final time.Youre sure you wont come back with us?I cant, he said.But maybe Ill get to visit you once Ive confronted my own demons, and hopefully not those of the horned variety.Youd be welcome anytime, she said.Night or day.Its because of you that Im still here.No, Anna.Absolutely not!It was you that saved me.I did something terrible.And you saved me from myself, from the dark void I have within me, something no one else could have done.Anna smiled, and watched his lips.Erebus has ascended, he said quietly, reaching down and taking her hand to peer upon the black band still binding her wrist, but the mystery of the Gilaxiad is something we have yet to solve.I think were destined to meet again.And with that he leaned forward and kissed her on her forehead.She squeezed his shoulder and then punched him light heartedly.They laughed and for a moment she felt a little like her old self again; though she knew it would be impossible to go back to the way things were.Too much had changed.* * *  As Anna stood for what would perhaps be the last time at the viewing platform of the Stellarstream, gazing out into the depths of deep space, the Crimson Flux drifted away from the interstellar vessel.The lightning planet was now a small sphere of light in the deepening distance.Nobody was about; all was quiet.No serenity coaching.No captain or Callista, no Gordian or Glana.She watched the Flux pass slowly by before it made the leap back toward civilization, disappearing into the dark ocean as the ships ultimatt engines were kicked into full capacity.She looked down and flexed her hand, unable to feel anything past the wrist around which the black burnished band wrapped in veined, almost alien like strands.Justus was right.They would meet again.She knew they would.He had saved her on Erebus; he had been with her as it had risen and fallen and done all that he could to see her to safety.And so did Peter.Now gazing at a sight more beautiful than even the domes of Titan had appeared, Anna experienced a moment of utter clarity; as everything around her up until now had seemed absolutely hopeless, a pale, lingering light like that of the sun reaching her home now so far away, she closed her eyes, and for some strange reason, for which she could not fathom, she smiled.As she wiped away a tear, a hand tenderly clutched her shoulder.She turned to look at the grave face of Callista.Come with me, she whispered, and led Anna over to the small blue seat in the corner.Callista sat close and took her students hand.I dont know half of what youve been through, she said.We have much to speak about.But that will all, for the moment, have to wait.Now I must at last tell you the truth, Anna.What is it?I finished translating the silver journal.Did you read it?Yes, but dont make me tell you what it said ...not yet.All right, Callista.Were going home, child.But to what, I do not know.Something has happened.I need my people more than ever.Anna grasped the old womans hand.What it is?I dont know for sure.In our absence your uncle, it seems, has raced into what I believe to be a trap.A trap?Set by whom?Somebody I believed to be dead.A young boy, scared and angry, now an old man, bitter and powerful.Edgar Mokrikovs diary explains it all.I thought I was the last one.But youre not?Callista looked at her carefully.No, Anna.Not anymore.Callista, I  Our lives are littered with golden moments, she whispered, looking into Annas eyes, her own filled with tears.This will be one.Close your eyes.She did so, breathing out slowly.Now imagine something for me, the old woman said.Dont think too much.Dont allow your mind to wander.Simply close your eyes.Now conjure the image of a corridor in your minds eye ...it is long, bare, straight, and narrow.Theres only silence and the lights flicker, offering split seconds of alternating vision and dreaded darkness.You see this image?She nodded.Good.Ahead you suddenly see something move.It is a dark creature so utterly terrifying that your blood freezes and your ...your heart turns to stone.It races towards you faster than you can run away, carrying a shrieking hiss which freezes you in your place.Anna shuddered at the thought, at the memory, but held her eyes closed, her mind focused.You now have but three choices: to turn and run back down the passage you came from, or to take one of the unknown paths leading off to either side.Or else you can charge straight ahead at the creature, at the beast, and hope beyond all hope that it is that which flees first.The choice, Anna, is yours alone.Anna looked down at the ground, and the words she spoke next came to her from within; and she found that she did not even have to think about the answer.It was already there.I run nowhere, she said.I defeat that fear by standing firm, and realising that the beast in front of me ...is the one in my mind.There was never any tunnel that could lead me to safety.She opened her eyes and looked at Callista, who also opened hers.She smiled, tears running down the curves of her ancient face.I cant run from my dreams.I just need to listen to the guidance they give me.And in the end Anna saw the truth of it: she had been so afraid of being trapped on Titan all her life that when she finally realised her true fear, to lose her little sister and never return home, her mistakes seemed so clear.And because of that, though she knew not what was to come, her heart told her she could face it.Good, Callista said, smiling.Now youre ready.Anna gazed into the old womans glistening eyes.Ready for what?My child, she said, to become a Istron.What?How?You too have an echo.What?I cant.I didnt touch Peter.No, she said, but he touched you.I dont understand.You, along with everyone else, assume that to be touched by Peter Marx means only to connect physically.But the truth is a secret of which very few are aware.For that was how I received my echo from that wonderful man.How?Callista smiled with a warmth deeper than anything Anna had ever seen in her.You cried for Peter, she said.You shed genuine tears, not through guilt or regret, but love.Something more powerful than any gift you could ever receive.And now, Anna, after all that has befallen us, after all that you have seen and done, I sense his echo ...his gift ...his light ...in you.
