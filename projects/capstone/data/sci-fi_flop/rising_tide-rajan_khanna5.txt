And so he didoffering me a position of authority, guaranteeing me my own lab and whatever equipment they could find for me, pledging me people to help and offer support.To his credit, he was fairly realistic, but I believe that he was serious.I just couldnt tell if he really wanted me or if he just wanted to hurt Ben, or maybe both at the same time.I told him Id do it.It excited him, of course, and so I insisted we toast to it and, when I could tell that he was good and drunk, I moved closer, placing my hand on his arm.He looked into my eyes, his all glassy.Then with my free hand, I took the syringe I had stolen from the infirmary and I pressed it into his skin.It was only a mild sedativeit was all I could make off withbut with the alcohol in his system, it did the trick.He looked up at me in surprise, his reactions slow, and then he leaned forward, resting his head against the table.Thankfully, Malik always insisted on us having privacy during our meals.I made sure his heartbeat was stable, then I snuck out to go find Ben.It was time to get off of the boat.ELEVEN For a moment, everyone freezes.Then everyone starts to move at once.I only have the wrench (they stripped me of my revolver on our flight back) and so I hold it up, ready to swing.Im vaguely aware of the men moving behind me, drawing weapons or maybe tools like me.Then, Ben?Its Miranda and I dont know what the hell to think.The funny thing is I almost smell her before I hear her voice.Its not that weird.Weve spent a lot of time together, in the field and cooped up in airships.Ive been around her when shes clean, when shes filthy, when shes stressed or scared or excited.Smell can be a valuable sense to develop as a forager.Your nose can alert you to the nearness of a Feral nest, or let you tell their droppings from those of an animal, or another human.It can tell you if food is good or if youre engines bad.It can warn you of disease.Not the Bug, mind you, but the other kinds.Im sure my nose has saved my life a few times.So its no surprise that I smell Miranda and I relax a bit, no longer tense and waiting to fight.Sarah, however, does not.Neither do Mals men.One rushes forward, his dark cap soggy and misshapen, a similar wrench in his hands.The other one, bearded and bareheaded, has a pistol in his hand.Without thinking, I go for the bearded man.The water slows me and I slip forward, but I manage a glancing blow on his arm that sends him to the side.But it opens me to the other man, who swings his wrench at me.I manage to duck, aided by the fact that Ive pretty much fallen, and the wrench clangs against some metal piping.Sarah is just standing there.Sarah, help!I say.She still doesnt move.I manage to get my legs under me and push off the floor, throwing myself into wrench man, pulling him down into the reeking water.I get him in a hold, similar to the one Sarah used back at the base, but above me I can see the man aiming his pistol, waiting for a shot at me.The man Im holding goes slack, but his friend is just about ready to fire when Miranda comes splashing through the water.The man swivels the pistol to her, but she collides into him and something in her hand flashes toward him.A moment later hes crumpling into the water.She turns to me, and I realize that shes holding a syringe in her hand.She stabs it into the man Im holding, depressing the plunger, and I release him a moment later, making sure to keep his head out of the water.What the hell is going on?I ask.As I rise, I turn to Sarah.And where the hell were you?She crosses her arms in front of her chest.I dont know who this is, she says, indicating Miranda.And I dont know whats happening here.Im certainly not going to risk angering someone who might be in charge of what happens to me.Ben, who is this?Miranda asks.Miranda, this is Sarah.She helped us get the pumps that Mal needed.Miranda nods.Miranda, what are you doing here?I ask.Im getting you out of here, she says.Now.She turns and moves back to the door.I start moving toward the door, then grab Mirandas hand.We should take her with us, I say, indicating Sarah.Miranda looks at me questioningly.She helped us out.Got us out of a serious bind.I dont know that I feel comfortable leaving her behind here with Mal.Does she want to go?Miranda asks.Then to Sarah, Do you?Sarah eyes Miranda skeptically.Are you sure you can get off of this ship?she asks.Yes, Miranda says.No hesitation.No doubt in her voice.And Ill be free to go my own way?When I want to?Of course, I say.Sarah looks first at me, then at Miranda and back again.We dont have much time, Miranda hisses.We have to move now.Mal doesnt know you, I say to Sarah.I cant guarantee hell give you a fair shake.Come with us.Sarah looks like shes going to say something, but then she just nods.Okay.Lets go.As we move through the door and up into the ship, I ask Miranda, Where exactly are we going?Up, she says.Now keep quiet.I follow closely behind her as she navigates the stairs and corridors of the ship.My feet and legs are still wet, but it feels good not to have water splashing around my knees.I must smell awful, though.Mirandas difficult to keep up with.She seems on a mission.You must have some plan to get us off of this ship.She smiles and opens the door to the deck of the Phoenix.Follow me, she says.Be careful, Miranda says as she creeps onto the deck.A lot of Maliks people moved back to the airships because of the sinking, but there still might be guards around.Or Mal, I say.She giggles, which seems completely out of place.I dont know if Ive ever heard Miranda giggle.No, she says.He wont be coming.I frown.What happened?Ill tell you later.First, Im going to dazzle you.Have you been drinking, Miranda?Shush.She leads us across the deck.Its dark outside, night.I can smell the water, hear the waves lap at the side of the ship.Also the creaking of the deck.I can almost imagine that were on some abandoned hulk floating in the ocean.Almost.Here, Miranda says.She grabs me and pulls me forward.Ahead, lines secure an airship to the Phoenixs deck.A ladder hangs down from it, and Miranda pulls it toward us.I look up, trying to see the airship there, but its difficult to make out.Of course, its dark and the moon is largely hidden by clouds.Climb, Miranda says.Where are we going?I ask.Mirandas drawing breath when the drone of an airship engine hits my ears, growing steadily louder, and lights start illuminating the opposite end of the ship.Another airship coming home to drop off its passengers.Climb!Miranda says, half whisper, half hiss.I climb.Moving as quickly as I can.My limbs are still recovering from their immersion in the cold water, but adrenaline kicks in, propelling me upward.I feel the settling of the ladder after Im up a ways, the feeling of someone else climbing beneath meSarah or Miranda.Above me is a strange airship.How Miranda got to it, I dont know.Maybe she just got lucky.But is there anyone on board?Surely she would have told me.Even as I get closer, I cant make out much about it.There arent lights on it, which makes a kind of sense.Lights might make it a target for enemy ships.Even with the Phoenixs artillery, it wouldnt make sense to call attention it.And yet, as I climb up to an unknown ship, possibly crewed by hostile people, all I can think is God, how Ive missed being in the sky.When I get to the top, I can see that the ladder leads into a hatch inside the gondola.Its also dark, but I can feel my way around the edge and tell that its secure for me to climb up into.So I do that and scoot myself inward and then pull up Sarah (I can tell by her breathing and the way she smellsoily and wet like me) up alongside me.Then Miranda is up.She scoots around to one side and I hear something click, and then the ladder starts to retract up into the ship.Only when its completely retracted does she press something else, closing the hatch beneath us.One final switch or lever brings the lights up inside the ship.Welcome to the Argus, Miranda says.Mals ship?I ask, remembering what Chang had said.She nods.Is he here?Miranda shakes her head.Hes still down on the Phoenix.I hold up my hands.None of this makes sense.Youre going to have to explain all of this.Fine, she says.As much as you want.But we have to get out of here first.Before they figure it out.I look to Sarah.You know anything about airships?Not a thing, she says.Ive just ridden on them.Okay, then.You find a place to stash yourself.Stay out of my way, okay?She nods moves off deeper into the ship.Ill be right back, Miranda says.Going to detach the anchor.You know your way around this ship?I ask.Better than you, she says, before disappearing through a door at the back of the gondola, leaving me alone.The Arguss gondola is mostly dominated by a central bank of consoles with a series of intact black screens in a grid pattern at its center.Three seats surround the central area.Im figuring out which seat I need to sit in to fly this thing when my back explodes in pain, right in the area of my right kidney.I feel a hand on the back of my head and it slams my face down toward the console in front of me.I manage to brace my hands against the console, so instead my face and nose smack hard into my knuckles and I see white for a moment.Pushing down with my left hand, I swivel right, aiming my elbow back.It connects with something, but a knee takes me in the belly and a fist glances off my jaw.I push back with both arms to get some breathing room and see that my attacker is a pale man, thin and blond, wearing some kind of blue, one piece uniform from the Clean.He doesnt give me much time to look, though, because he comes back at me with fists swinging.I hold up my arms to protect my face and catch a fist on the forearm, then one on my shoulder.This has to stop.I arc forward, leading with my head, but he drops back, which is okay because I keep going, thrusting forward with both of my fists, colliding with him and slamming him up against the wall of the gondola.I pummel him in the midsection, getting a good blow into his solar plexus, which makes him choke.Then I grab him and smack him back against the wall again.The back of his head hits hard.Then I hear Mirandas voiceBen!I spare a moment to look and see her toss me something small and black.I catch it just after realizing that its my fathers revolver.By the time my attacker is recovering, I have the revolver pressed against his chest.Stop, I say.He freezes, his hands flapping at his sides like flags.Dont shoot.Dont move and I wont have to.What are you going to do with him?Miranda asks.Sarah!I call.She appears a moment later.See if the cargo area has any life jackets.She raises her eyebrows but goes to check.She returns a few minutes later and nods.Good, I say.You and Miranda are going to take our friend here back with you and fit him with one.Then, when I take us out from over this boat, youre going to push him out of the ship.The mans eyes widen.Dont worry, I say.You should survive.Miranda looks at me questioningly.Ill take the ship lower, I say.Miranda, take the revolver, I say.Sarah is better with oneshes had more training, but the thing is I dont trust her.Miranda takes the revolver, keeping it level on Mals man.Cmon, she says, waving him toward the back of the gondola.I wipe the blood from my nose and turn back to the series of seats, wincing at the pain where the man hit me.Miranda points to one corner of the console with her free hand.Flight controls are over there.Thats just what I thought, I said, settling into the seat.The setup looks fairly simple to operate.Simple steering yoke, throttle controls, rudders, and so on.I look out of the windows of the gondola and cant make out much outside of the moonlight.Have to worry about the lights later.Its my first time at the controls of a ship since the Cherub exploded over both of our heads.Hello, I say to the ship.Lets be friends.Then I fire her up and grab hold of the yoke.Easy now, Ben, I tell myself.I want to tear away from the ship, at whatever top speed this ship is capable of, but its best to ease out.Not draw undue attention to ourselves.I remember the five other ships I saw on entry with the Raven.Six ships, I correct, including Whistlers.All flying close.I pull out and let us drop closer to the water.It will let Miranda and Sarah do what they need to do and also hopefully will let the Phoenix help break up our shape.Its achingly slow, but I keep her steady.Then Miranda and Sarah return to the gondola.Miranda stands by me and Sarah falls into an old, worn chair covered in pitted and ripped plastic.You got rid of our extra weight?I ask.Yes, sir, Sarah says.He should live, Miranda says.Though hes going to raise a fuss on the boat.Then I should pick up some speed, I say.How do you turn the lights on?No, Miranda says.No lights.She walks over to me, leans down, and switches on a screen set into the consol.It comes to life in brilliant light.Circles of light.It pulses.Is this...Radar, she says.Cmon, Ben.Take us out.I look at the radar display and see several bright dots, which I assume are the other ships.Ive heard of radar, of course, but I havent ever used it before.Most ships had them back in the Clean, but maintenance was difficult, and on most ships they broke down.Mal must be the luckiest bastard in the world to find a ship like this.Not to mention the Phoenix down below us.What kind of ship is this?I ask out loud.Surveillance, Miranda says.Hence all the screens.Makes sense, I think.Right now, though, all I care about is putting as much distance as I can between us and Mal.It takes just a few minutes of movement for the feeling to settle over me.This is it.This is where I belong.Where I should be.Not in a cell.Not on a ship.Not on the ground.I belong on an airship.Flying an airship.This is what Im meant for.Of course Im aware that this isnt mine.That this isnt the Cherub.But the Cherub is dead.I killed her.Miranda, I say.You got us out.You did it.I had been racking my brain for a way to get us out and Miranda did it.Thank you, I say.I realize right then how I was dreading being returned to my cell.Were not clear yet, Miranda says.I did my part.The next step is all yours.I continue to pull away from the Phoenix, accelerating ever so slightly while also increasing our elevation.Mal is not going to be happy, I say.It wont change much, she says.Hell still hate you.Hell just hate me, too.She shrugs.We have somewhere we need to be.People who depend on us.People who might be in danger.We needed wings.I got them for us.Shes absolutely right about that, and hearing her say that, the way that she says it, makes something swell in my chest.I want to grab her and kiss her right now.Then I think of what she just said.Did he ...did he tell you why he hates me?He told me enough, she says.He says you left him for dead.I think of that vision of Mal splattered in blood as Tess, Claudia, and I pulled away in the Beast.How our eyes locked.I consider lying.Just for a split second.But for some reason I cant.Its the truth.I cant look at her.I know it for the cowardice that it is, but I still cant look.I expect ...I dont know, something from her.Reproach.Disappointment.Anger.Instead she just carries on as if it wasnt brought up.He talked to me quite a bit, she says.I think he took a liking to me.Who wouldnt?As I say it, I look down at the radar and for a moment think I see a blip moving on the edge of the outer circle.He brought me up here.Showed the ship off to me.He said it was an old surveillance ship that he found.Mal always was good at finding things, I say.There.Again.The hint of moving blip.The engines feel steady but I have no idea how fast they will move us or how quickly well be able to accelerate.The shape of this thing is unusual to me.I keep us moving slowly, almost inching us through the sky.Based on the arrangement of blips, I calculate the best exit.I move us up and to the right.Ive heard of ships like this, I say.They used them in the military, I think.Meant to float up in the sky and look down on people.I think many of them were unmanned.Remote operated.I heard of a guy, I think he was called the Hyena.He got hold of one and stripped out a lot of the equipmentthe computer stuff that didnt work and the cameras.Fitted it for people.Course they had to make it extra large for him.On account of he laughed a lot?I frown.No, on account of he was fat.No, why he was called the Hyena.Oh.You got me, I say.It could have been because of his hygiene.Its true, she says.I read it.Hyenas were known for their laugh.Sure, maybe.I didnt know the man.But he had a ship like this.The moving blip blinks, then drops off of the radar.So far, so good.Malik said that it was used during the outbreak, Miranda says.This one was specifically designed for a team.They would chart the progress of the virus over citiesreport on any breakdowns in the system.They must have been really busy, I say.Yeah.They camouflaged it, too, though I think that might have been before it was tasked to monitor the virus.It has some special kind of envelope.Its supposed to help it blend in with the sky.Nice trick, I say.Miranda takes the moment to put my fathers revolver down next to me on the console.How did you get that?I ask.Malik had it.He kept it up here.I saw it on my visit.I thought you might want it back.I do, I say.Thanks.Thats two you owe me, she says.She holds up two fingers, but my attention is drawn to the radar screen and the blip thats reappeared there.Moving toward us.Shit.Weve got company.Where?she asks.I dont know.I can hear my voice getting louder.That way?I point in the general direction the blip is moving.Does this thing have any weapons?He didnt say.Shit.Then I remember that were running dark and that will help.If this was used when the shit came down, when the Bug scribbled all over the book that was the Clean, it should have automated gas distribution.The controls look familiar, so I start shifting gas and ballast so that well drop closer to the ocean.Im estimating here, and I cant see very well, but I set it for as close to the oceans surface as I can get without spilling us into it.Then I run to the opposite end of the gondola.The thing about gondolas is that you cant always see well out of them.Even if youre surrounded with windows, you typically have this massive structure above of you, blocking out anything thats not on your level or below.In the Clean, they used to use cameras to see where they were going, cameras and instruments like the Arguss radar.But not a lot of cameras have survived the Sick.A lot of us get around this by rigging up mirrors and other ways to see what we normally cant, only I cant seem to find any of those and dont even really know where to look.For all I know, some of these screens still work and Mal uses them.Or maybe he has so many escorts when he travels that they help spot for him.None of that helps me.There!Sarahs voice.Shes pointing out the side of the gondola, behind the control room.I see lights moving toward us.Keep your eyes on it, I say.Tell me whats happening.Then I return to the controls.Were nearer the waters surface now.I cant tell how close, but closer that Id usually like to be.Whats she doing?I call back to Sarah.Looks like shes coming after us.Down?Yeah.Bastard must be crazy.I suddenly think it must be Whistler, Chang, and the rest of them.Of course they must be used to flying over water.Must do it all the time.So its time to get creative.Mal, I think, I hope you kept this ship in good condition.If that is the Raven coming after us, then I know shes got the two large guns on her sides.I dont want to come under fire from those.I dont know how well this ship will stay together.I get as close as I can to the water and then level off.She still dropping?I ask.Yes!Sarah yells.Right on top of us.I watch the blip advance on the radar.Try to get a sense for the other ships speed.I keep our speed constant, but I make sure to keep all the engines up and running.Miranda, do you know how to turn the lights on?Outside this thing?I think so.But is that a good idea?Trust me.Get ready.All of them.Okay.The other ship gets closer and closer.By now they should be able to open fire on us and take us down, but my guess is that theyre not so eager to do that.Not this ship.Not the bosss ship.I hear the report of gunfire.Heavy caliber.And I jump.Maybe I was wrong.Any hits?I dont think so, calls Sarah.Miranda shakes her head.Shes right on top of us!Sarah yells.Oh my God.Then I do it.I signal to Miranda to hit the lights and I push the engines hard, straight up, cutting our forward speed.To give the ship a boost, I dump all of our ballast.In a ship like this, much of the ballast is held in tanks.As water.As we dump weight and the engines push hard, we gain lift and, at least relative to our pursuers, soar above them.Theyre coming in at a steep angle and shouldnt be able to correct so well.I can only watch it on the radar screen, watch as our two blips overlap for a moment.I steel myself for the scrape and shock of impact, but it doesnt come.Instead we slip through the night as water gushes from our hold and falls beneath us, on, Im hoping, the other ship.If so, it might help push them into the water, and getting out of that would be chore for anyone.Cut the lights, I say.And as we go black again, I change course and push out back toward the mainland on a different trajectory than before.I spare a look out the gondola window to see the lights of the other ship remaining where they were, either stuck in the sea or else struggling to regain control.Why the lights?Miranda asked.I shrug.I thought our sudden appearance from out of the darkness might give them a moments hesitation.Slow their reaction time.I think I was right.I scan the radar screen.We dont appear to be pursued by anyone else.Where are we headed now?Miranda asks, and I know what shes really asking.We cant really go to Tamoanchan with Sarah.Tamoanchan isnt too fond of strangers, and Im already on thin ice.Not to mention that Sarah would be trapped there once she knew its location.She seems like a decent kid, but I dont know her.Dont trust her.And that naval base was fucked to all hell.No, not Tamoanchan, unfortunately.Not yet.But I can put her down somewhere safe.Somewhere she can travel from probably pretty easily.Lord Tess.Huh?The knowledge broker.Shes who I visited to get help for Mal in the first place.I owe her anyway, for the information.Only thing is now some of Mals people know where she is.They might expect that Ill go back to her.Will that put her in danger?Miranda asks.I chew on my lip.Its a good question.I dont think so, I say.Tess is pretty well protected.And shes neutral.But that brings up another reason to go there.Whats that?She knows where the island is.What?I shrug.She knows things.Learns things.Finds out secrets.Someone who needed something must have sold out the location.So she can sell it to someone else?Theoretically.But shes not like that.That thing back then.With Mal.Tess was there.I got her out.Her and Claudia.I think I see something, Im not sure what, flit across Mirandas face.Are you sure about that?Her not being like that?Well, I say.I wouldnt mind reminding her of that fact.Then Lord Tess it is, she says.I plot our course.What I told Sarah was that we were going to see Lord Tess and that she traded in information.Also that Tess had asked me for information on the naval base.I figured that if Tess wanted what information I had, that she would pay much more for the information that someone like Sarah had.Pay me what?Sarah asks.What else?Information.I dont understand.Informationabout settlements you could go to.Ships you could hook up with.Reliable captains to ferry you around.Sources of barter.Whatever you need.It may not seem like it, but thats a lot of value.So she barters.In information.Yes, I say.What did you use back on the base?She looks at me like I just asked her what direction the sun rises in.Money, she says.Money?Yes.Paper money?Yes, dollars.Jesus.Youre going to need an education if youre going to stay out here.Money went the way of clean streets and running water.Its all barter now.Barter.She nods.The only thing that matters is what you can use.And Tess barters information.Yes.Buying and selling.So I tell her about the base...And she gives you whatever information you want.If youve earned it, at least.Do you think she knows about the nuclear weapons?My mouth literally drops open.The what?The nukes.She looks ashamed as she says it.Theyre what weve been protecting all this time.Thats what the captain thought you were there to steal.My God, I said.Actual nukes.Probably within spitting distance from where I was being held.No wonder Danning went all paranoid.I started wondering if Tess did know about the nukes.I dont know if Tess knows, I say.But Id say thats certainly worth something.Im not going to betray my unit, she says.I dont think youll have to.Just answer the questions that you can.You know more than I do.Im sure shell reward you for it.She nods to herself.Then she looks up at me.I didnt ...its all so new.And you didnt know what you were getting into, I think.You just have to adapt, I say.Or else the world will chew you up and swallow you down.You have to change.She nods again, then meets my eyes, her posture suddenly straight.Im ready.She seems less sure as the three of us (Sarah, Miranda, and I) walk up the steps to the library.She seems nervous.I mean, Im nervous, too, but thats just because Im expecting Whistler and Chase and Orkney to appear from around every corner, armed to the gills, looking for an excuse to make me a greasy stain.Instead we just see Tess and her man, Rufus.Tesss guards stick to their shadows.Benjamin!Tess says.You made it back.She claps her wrinkled hands together and rubs them.It wasnt easy, I say.Tess holds up a gnarled finger.I have a feeling nothing is easy with you.Who are your friends?This part Ive been dreading.I take Mirandas hand, and she steps forward.This is ...Miranda.Lord Tesss smile is that of someone who just ate a whole bird.Smug and satisfied.My, my, my.Hello there, Miranda.Ive heard so much about you.Miranda looks at me questioningly.I ignore her.So, you are the woman whos altered Bens course.Im sorry?Oh, come now.This one was a by the numbers forager.Thats all he ever really cared about.But now theres you.Miranda frowns.How do you feel about him?Tess asks.I redden but realize that I want to know the answer.Not here, of course.Not in front of Tess and Sarah and Rufus.But at some point when we have some time together.This time Miranda smiles.I dont think thats any of your business.Tess laughs.Its deep and wet.She holds up her finger again.This one, she says.This one, Benjamin.I like her.Then to Miranda, Has he told you his middle name?Tess, I say, quickly trying to steer the conversation away, this is Sarah.Formerly of the US Navy.Despite her large, dark glasses, I can see Tesss eyebrows rise.Its almost worth it just for that.I figure she has a lot more to tell you than I could.Im sure thats worth something to you.You want her to pay off your debt?Lets just say that we came to an agreement.Shell give you your information.Shes looking to make a fresh start.Is that true?Tess asks.Sarah gives a quick, curt nod.It is, sir.I could use whatever help you can offer in that regard.Tess nods back, deeper.I think we can come to an arrangement.She smiles at Sarah.Then she looks at me.Why, Benjamin.Youre full of surprises.You did right by me; I want to do right by you.She nods in acknowledgment.I do have one favor to ask, though, I say.Oh?There are going to be people coming to look for me.Here.The people you were with before.Yes.I look down at my boots.Mals people.Maybe Mal himself.You burned him again, didnt you?It was me, Miranda says.But yes.Tess looks surprised again.And now his thugs are going to come looking for you here?Yes, I say.Im sorry.This is probably the first place theyll look.Lord Tess shakes her head and spares a look to Rufus.Rufus is flat out frowning.Angry.You do leave chaos in your wake, dont you, Mister Gold?Tess says.I wince.Its true.As true as it gets.I dont think theyll bother you much, I say, trying to fill that uncomfortable moment with words.They have no cause to.Theyll just be looking for me.You know Malik has no love for me, Tess says.Our history is almost as bad as yours.I find that hard to believe, I say.Ehhh.She tilts her head to the side.Not convinced.Youre too valuable, and not just to him, to have anything happen to you.She looks at me and shakes her head, as if Im an ignorant child.Benjamin, when its personal, people are capable of anything.Rules dont matter, outcomes dont matter.Only that surge of feeling when you render justice unto your enemy.I stare back at her, unsure of what to say.Instead, she says, But I think that youre right.I dont think that Malik will harm me.What he will do is ask me where youve gone.And youll say you dont know.Her face breaks into a smile, though its one without any mirth in it.But I do know where youre going.I keep my eyes on Tess, but I can feel Miranda looking at me.Tess...Im almost sure that this is going to cost me more.Tess is always concerned with fair bartering.Tess waves a hand in the air.Dont worry, Benjamin, she says.I have no love for Malik either.He couldnt pay the price of that information.Youll get away fine.She turns and shuffles back to her makeshift throne.Besides, she says, I still feel like theres some credit left for getting me out on the Cherub all those years ago.She lowers herself into the chair.I can almost hear her bones creaking and popping.She sighs as her body settles.She reaches for one of the hardbound books piled next to her chair, picks up the top one.Who would have thought these things would outlive us?She tosses it back onto the pile.I clasp my hands together like Im praying.Thank you, Tess.She just nods.Then her head jerks up and she snaps her fingers.Wait, she says.Yes?When you were here before, you were asking about Gastown, werent you?Yes...Some traders came through here yesterday.I took whatever they could give me, like I usually did.Where theyve been, what they saw, etcetera.They mentioned about a camp that they delivered to.They said it was run by some folks out of Gastown.Oh?Yes.They said that it was strange for Gastown.That it was a camp full of scientists.I look at Miranda.Her eyes widen.I nod at Tess.Wed heard Gastown was working with a group of scientists.The Cabal.Some of the smartest people left in the Sick, allied with some of the most vicious.Thats just the thing, Tess says.Id heard those stories as well, of course.Theyre not new.No, this was different.This wasnt just a camp.It was a prison camp.A prison camp?A group of prisoners from a science commune.They talked to one or two of the prisoners.Said they were taken some weeks back.She snaps her fingers.The place had a funny name.She picks up a notepad and flips through the pages.Miranda moves forward and grabs my arm.Was it Apple Pi?Tess looks up at her and smiles.Yes.Thats it.How did you know?Miranda knows because that was her camp.Where her and her boffins worked for a cure.Only it got hit by Gastown raiders while Miranda, Sergei, and Clay were off in the field.I was there to see it taken.Up until now, we werent sure what had happened to the other boffinswhether they had been captured or killed.But it sounds like some of them are alive.We need the location of that camp, Miranda says.Tess smiles widely, her wrinkled face cracking around it.What would you like to trade for it?Miranda thinks for a moment, then smiles, too.Do you have something that reads old tech?Its a portable data drive.Tess smiles and nods.She holds out a hand to Rufus, and he disappears behind the curtain, coming back with a small, portable computer.Miranda reaches into her pocket and pulls out the drive she stole from Gastown.The drive with the data on the Bug, the data that the Gastown scientists were working with.Right now, it might be the most valuable thing in the world to Miranda.Shes hoping to use it to find a cure.Right here is data on the Maenad virus, she says.What people call the Bug.Possibly more advanced than anything Ive seen before.Tess tilts her head and shifts in her chair.It sounds valuable and yet ...you know theres not much call for scientific data these days.Maybe, Miranda says.But its extremely rare.Maybe youll never have cause to use it, but one day, if someone comes in here looking for something like this, wont you be mad at yourself if you let it slip through your fingers?I take it these scientists are friends of yours?Tess asks.Miranda nods once.Very dear friends of mine.Weve been looking for them for some time.Tess starts wagging her head from side to side.She looks to Rufus and sighs.She shakes her head.Dont pay attention to this, Rufus, she says.Im a big softy.Ill bend for people I like.She looks back to Miranda.Okay.She reaches down the side of her chair and pulls up the notebook and a pen.Im guessing you can read.Yes, Miranda says.Good.Tess flips back through the book and uses a finger to trace the words that are written on one of the pages.Then she flips to a fresh page and starts writing.Rufus, she says.Collect the data.Rufus moves forward with the portable computer, and Miranda moves forward with the drive.She hands it over.Be careful with it, she says.Its very important.I will, Rufus says, slightly offended.He slots the drive into the side of the computer, then turns it toward him and presses a few keys.Let me know when its done, Tess says.I know what Mirandas risking hereif something were to go wrong and her drive were to short or be corrupted or just die, well, there goes a chance to advance her research.On the other hand, thats Mirandarisking everything for her people.I think back to the Cherub and think its her example Ive been following.Done, Rufus says.He carefully removes the drive and hands it back to Miranda.Thank you, she says, and she replaces it in her shirt pocket, snapping it closed.Tess nods and rips off the notebook page and holds it out to Miranda.I dont have an exact location, but I do know the route of the traders, and I got them to give me landmarks.Thank you, Miranda says again.She neatly folds the paper and tucks it into her jacket pocket.Now I think we should leave, I say.No offense, Tess, but I dont want to be here if Whistler and Maliks other friends show up.Go, Tess says with a wave.You might scare off other customers.I nod and turn to go.And Benjamin, she says.I turn back.Good luck.I think youre going to need it.Always, I say with a self effacing smile.Good luck to you, Sarah, I say.Remember what I said about change.She salutes me in response, and I repeat the motion back.Then, my hand on Mirandas back, we head back toward the Argus.TWELVE I think we should rename the ship, I say, as I take her up.Its not like were taking her back to Mal.Miranda sighs.What do you want to name it?Not the Cherub again.No, I say.There was only one Cherub.And not something similar, she says.What?I mean, Ben, the Cherub?Its an Old Testament thing, I say.The Torah, the Bible.Angels.Big, scary, powerful things.Thats funny, she said.I always had heard that they were flying babies in diapers.No, I say.Jesus.They were scary, Miranda.I shake my head.Read a fucking book thats not about virology once in a while.She smiles back at me.So what then?I remember a story back from my childhood.One of my fathers books.An angel that could see in all directions.Covered in eyes.Thats basically what this ship is.The thousand eyed angel of death.Dumah, I say.The Dumah?Yeah.She narrows her eyes.What does it ...never mind.I dont want to know.Youre the one flying it.The Dumah it is.I nod.The Dumah.It works.Ben.Miranda holds up the paper that Tess gave her.I think that we should go to this camp now.I keep the ship steady and turn to Miranda, crossing my arms.I disagree.Why not, Ben?Miranda asks, her voice rising.My God, those peoplemy peopletrapped there all this time.These are my friends.I know, I say.And I want to get them out, too, but its just the two of us.And this ship isnt rigged for carrying a whole bunch of people.Were not prepared for this.I have one gun.One.And only a few bullets left.She turns away, shaking her head.Not to mention that we dont know if Tamoanchan is okay, I say.Lets say we could even get your people out.Where do we go if Tamoanchan is gone?What do we do if its full of Gastown thugs?I think thats our immediate priorityhead to the island and figure out the fallout there.Then, as soon as we can, get help to go rescue your scientists.She looks down.I know youre worried about your people.Each one of them.But we need to check on Sergei.And Clay, she says, looking up at me.I guess, I say.She punches me in the arm.And Diego, I say.She squeezes my arm.He chose to go to Gastown, you know.I shake my head.After I goaded him into it.Hes his own man.Miranda...I dont finish the sentence.It all seems too big.What I did to get us to Gastown.How Diego paid for it.How Tamoanchan might have paid.Just because I wanted my ship.And now that shes gone, what was it for?You sacrificed the Cherub, Miranda says, as if reading my mind.Dont forget that.You gave up the thing you loved most to try to save all of them.Its true.I loved the Cherub all my life.But was it what I loved the most?Miranda, I say, lifting her chin.Ben!she says suddenly.Loudly.Looking past me.She points.I turn to look.One of the screens has flickered to life.How the hell did that happen?Did you do something?I flicked a few of the switches before, but I didnt think they would work.Looks like it did.One bank of screens has ten monitors in it.Two of these are operating, showing ...sky.The second bank of screens is showing us the ground.At least on the three monitors that are working.One is a high level view.Another, closer up.The third, well, Im not sure what Im looking at.It makes sense, Miranda says.Some to see around you, for flight.Some to see below you, for study.Whats that one?I ask, pointing to the strange monitor.The images there are just colors against a black background.Miranda looks, then frowns, then screws up her lips.Then she smiles.I think its infrared.What?Infrared.I heard you.I dont know that that means.Oh.She pats me on the back in a really condescending way that I hate.Thermal imaging.It reads heat signatures.Really?Really.The lighter colors are hotter signatures, the darker ones, cooler.I would guess they used this at night when they couldnt get a clear optical picture.Or they might have even used it through walls.People would show up hotter than their surroundings.Fires, I say.What?They could spot fires, too.I have a sudden image of people aboard the Dumah, a crew of them, several manning the monitors.Shifting cameras, maybe.Communicating down with the ground.Im thinking of when the shit went down.There were probably a lot of fires.Probably, Miranda says.So its functional then.Partly at least.The cameras.Looks like it, Miranda says.And you just pushed a few buttons.More of them might work.Maybe someone at Tamoanchan can look at it.Work something out.Miranda nods.Maybe.Im trying to think what we could use this for.It begs the question, of course, what were going to be doing in the future.I guess it comes down to whats going on with Tamoanchan.I look at Miranda from the corner of my eyes.Do you ever see us going back to the way things were?I ask.What do you mean?Miranda asks.Me flying you to Feral nests, you going down to the ground, taking samples.That kind of thing.Im thinking that this ship would give us a better sense of where Ferals might be hiding.And how many.This kind of ship, back then, would have made things a lot easier.Miranda bends down over the monitors, tracing something on the screen with her finger.There is no back, she says, echoing something she said to me long ago.Once more, I have to agree with her.Ive been keeping track of our position on a map that Mal had handy.Actually, a series of maps.Luckily theres enough of the sea and coast, which is no real surprise considering the course he was taking.According to the position I charted, Tamoanchan should be in sight soon.I already have the radio lit and set to the frequency that Tamoanchan uses.They dont know this ship, so they might see us as a threat.If theyre still there.By blowing up the Cherub, I managed to take out the ships that were heading there from Gastown.Those ships intended to drop infected Ferals onto the island.I assumed they were only the first wave.That more ships would be coming.What Id been hoping for was that my sacrifice could buy them time to get the island evacuated.So I dont know what Im going to find.One of the best case scenarios involves an abandoned Tamoanchan, all the people off somewhere else, pissed and unhappy, but safe and alive.The worst case scenarios are, well, worse.For all I know, we could be flying to a ruined city.Or one thats been taken over by Gastown.Thats the scenario I fear the most.That well fly into sight and raiders will be all over us like flies on a carcass.This ship has neither the speed of the Cherub nor the armaments of many others.Dont get me wrongits a sleek, impressive ship, but not much good against a group of raiders.Its difficult to know why Gastown does what it does.When the raiders took Gastownfree, independent Gastown, I mean, the city in the sky that wasthey kept it.Which made sense.It was a trading city.Valuable.Strategic.And of course it had the only dependable source of helium around.Of course you keep that.But they dont always keep things.When they hit the Core, where Miranda and her scientists had set up camp, a place they called Apple Pi (thats a dumb nameMirandas going to give me shit about the name of the Cherub when she worked in a place called that?), they didnt take it.They torched it.Gutted it.But then left.I guess there wasnt anything there worth holding on to.Have I mentioned that I hate those raiders?Miranda comes up behind me and rubs my arm.Somehow it helps.I guess I know that Im not facing this alone.I hope that Sergeis okay.Hes like a surrogate father to Miranda, of course, but I really like the guy myself.He was the first of Mirandas boffins that I met.Hes not the liveliest of guys but ...I care about him.Id hate to lose him.By now I can make out the dark spot of land thats Tamoanchan, an island far enough off the coast that it doesnt get stumbled upon very often, but large enough and flat enough that a settlement could set up there, a real city with wooden buildings and, because of the water surrounding it, security.Ferals cant just wander in.Only the Bug.Infected people.Which is why the islands secrecy is carefully guarded and they vet everyone who goes there.I kinda ....skipped that vetting process.I helped out two of their people, a man named Diego and his sister, Rosie.They were out looking for ship captains to help keep them supplied.I helped them escape from some raiders, and they figured that was a good enough audition.Later, after the Core was sacked, I took Miranda and Sergei and Clay there (though Clay was not my idea).It didnt go as well as I expected.That was mostly due to the fact that Miranda, Sergei, and Clay insisted upon bringing a live Feral with them.Batshit crazy, of course.But they were studying it.Miranda calls it Alpha.It has some kind of mutation.Some alteration of the Bug that helps her studies.So she brought it with her, and it got us all thrown into cells (something Im developing a talent for) and almost got us killed.But I was able to convince the Tamoanchan Council that Miranda was onto something.That she had the best chance of working out the Bug.Of building something like a detection system, if not a cure.They set her people up on a nearby island that would hopefully help protect the main island from contamination.I thought that meant Miranda would be safe, but then she decided to come with me to Gastown while I chased after the Cherub.And now were full circle, back to Tamoanchan.Its not a large island, but not really tiny either.Its ...medium.And growing larger in the window by the second.So far, it looks the same.I mean, I think it looks the same.Does it look the same to you?I ask Miranda.She presses herself against the window, trying to see.I look over to the monitors, but none of them are currently showing the island.It slowly grows larger.Then, as were both watching, both of us tense and unwilling to even guess what might have happened, the radio crackles to life.
