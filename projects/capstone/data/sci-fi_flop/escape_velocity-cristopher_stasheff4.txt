He might not have had the policy, but he sure had it ready.Do your people always express themselves so exuberantly?Bhelabher seemed smaller, somewhat lost, with Shacklars departure.Not always, Cholly admitted.Theyre often depressed.Still, theres no sense just telling youtake the good man and show him, Ard.Mm?It only took Sams elbow in his ribs to make Dar react to his new name.Oh, yes!Yes He heaved himself to his feet with a sigh.Yes, if we hurry, we can just make the two oclock war.See you later, Cholly.It was more of a threat than a promise.5  Dar lifted a glass in a trembling hand and drank deeply.I tell you, I dont know if I can last it out.What for?Cholly twisted the empty out of his hand and replaced it with a full one.Theres never a chance that hed recognize yer.Yeah, but Im running out of things to show him.Dar started to sip, then stared at the glass.I just emptied this.And he just refilled it.Sam shook her head.You are in bad shape.Come, now!Cholly cajoled.A whole planetful of marvels, and you cant find a weeks tour?Come, indeed!Whatve you shown him?Well, let me see.Dar started ticking them off on his fingers.The Wallallall thirty miles of it.The Two OClock War.A Wolman village.The Eight OClock War.He had a conference with Shacklar.The Two OClock war.The enlisted mens recreation complex and organic market.The officers recreation complex and fixed market.The Eight OClock War.Conference with Shacklar.The Two OClock War.A Wolman trading session.A Wolman information barter   Adult school, Cholly murmured.That, too A Wolman workshop.The Eight OClock War.Conference with Shacklar.The Two OClock War.He likes wars.I was beginning to get that impression, Sam agreed.You still havent shown him the parade ground.Or the gaol.Dar shook his head.Depressing.Or the Little Theater.The Concert Hall.Boring.How do you know?Could be he likes amateurs.Then theres the radio studio, the 3DT studio, the barracks   All the high spots, huh?Cholly shrugged.Nobody said you had to entertain the manjust to guide him.You wouldnt want him to get a false impression of us, would you?Yes, Dar snapped.Definitely.Cholly straightened up with a sigh.Then yeve nought but yourself to blame if hes hard to get along with.Thats the strange part.Dars brow knit.Hes not.Course he would be.Youd be, too, if  hows that again?Hes not, Dar repeated.Hes not tough to get along with at all.Hes been getting more and more pleasant every day.In fact, today he was a real nice guy.Im amazed at how wrong my first impression of him was.Im amazed at how good a psychiatrist the General is, Cholly grunted.Something beeped in the back corner, and kept on beeping.Sam looked up.A holophone?Here?Why not?Dar smiled.Radio waves dont have to have plastrete buildings around them, you know.Cholly ambled back to the phone and pressed the receive button.Chollys Hash House, Bar, an Natural Food Emporium Oh, its yerself, General!Who?Oh, yes, hes here!You want to  You dont want to  You want to see him?Right now?Begging yer pardon, General, butwhats he done?Oh?Oh, I see.Yes, yes, right away  Same to you, General Right.He switched off and ambled back to Dar.Well, well, my boy, seems youve attracted notice.Dars mouth went dry.Whatd I do now?Nothin, it seems, except maybe a good job.He says its not what you have done, but what you will do, if you follow me.I dont.Neither do I.  But thats what he said, and if youve any hopes of our scheme working out, I think yed best get over there.Hop to it now, Dar!Lick split!Dar hopped.Yes, I really must thank you, Bhelabher agreed.Seeing the way this colonys been organized has been a revelation to me.My thanks, Shacklar murmured.Still, its scarcely in the same category as changing wine into water.It certainly seems not far less.Bhelabher beamed at Dar with owlish enthusiasm.Do you realize what this man has managed to induce here?Hope!Optimism!An atmosphere of opportunity!A growing, progressing society!Well, yes, I had sort of realized something of the sort.Dar wondered if he was missing something.And it sure is darn near a miracle, compared to the ball and chain world this place was when I came.Compared to Terra!To the Proxima Centauri Electorate!To any of the Central Worlds!Do you realize what a paradise this is?Dar stared.You like outdoor plumbing?Ill take it any day over the spiritual septic tank the Central Worlds have become!Weve become stratified there, young man, stratified!Do you know what that means?Uh h h h h  Dar rewound his memories to a conversation with Cholly, six years ago, about the nature of tyranny.Yeah.It means youre either a subject or a ruler, and theres no way to change it.Bhelabher looked startled for a moment; then he nodded.Well put, well put!He turned to Shacklar.Isnt it amazing how the simpler way of stating something so often catches the essence of it?He turned back to Dar.But youre quite right, young man, quite rightno one can move up.So the vast majority live out their lives in dull, repetitious desk jobs, with only 3DT, euphorics, and cabaret passes for pleasures.Sounds wonderful, Dar sighed.When do I get a chance to be bored?Im sure any of our Terran slaves would be delighted to trade places with you if they really had the slightest inkling of what you have here.And our fortunate few would be even more eagerthey can have anything they want, but find nothing worth having.Still, theyre convinced there must be some job worth havingso they spend their lives in pursuit of some meaning in pleasure.Ill find it.Dar raised a hand.Wont take me long, either.Im sure you would.The pleasures of the senses only seem to have meaning when theyre rare.So our poor privileged ones never can find the purpose theyre seekingbut they keep looking for it.Dar frowned.Are you trying to tell me that the only real difference between the classes and the masses is that the classes desperation is noisy, and the masses desperation is quiet?No, Im trying to tell you that the only difference that matters is between them and yourselfor, more accurately, between Terra and Wolmar.Here, a mere private has as good a chance as the General of getting whatever pleasures are availablethat is, if he earns his points and saves his credits.Dar nodded.I do.And now that you mention it, we all do have pretty much the same, ah, forms of recreation   Shacklar nodded.The advantage of having very few pleasures.and Cholly and the General, between them, keep opening up more upper level jobs, such as  Dar swallowed  trading.The advantage of an expanding economy.Shacklar leaned back, locking his fingers across his chest.Fortunately for us, the Wolmen had a very unsophisticated technology.True, you found all the elements here when you came, Bhelabher admitted.But you also had the wisdom and ability to combine them!Bhelabhers smile saddened.Such traits are rare.I, for example, lack both.Youre wise to realize your limitations.Shacklar picked up a data cube and rolled it between his fingers.But I wonderdo you have as sure a grasp of your strengths?Oh, I think that I do.Bhelabher fairly beamed.That cube youre playing with, nowgive me a million of them, and the tools of my trade, and Ill set them up for you so that I can have any of their septillions of bits for you within thirty seconds of your asking for it.Dar developed a faraway look.General, excuse mewe have the complete military personnel records on cube, dont we?Not for personal use, Shacklar said dryly.And Im sure the Honorable Bhelabher understands the importance of confidentiality.Thats what I was hoping  I dont think you appreciate how great a benefit the computer can be, for all humankind.Bhelabher nodded.Quite true, really.If the sum total of human knowledge holds the answer to a question, the computer will find it for you.Quite enviable, really.Shacklar toyed with the cube again.Myself, I have no ability to organize data.I have to keep everything in my headand it goes without saying that, far too often, I fail to find the solution, because the one vital bit of information is not in my head.Well, that wont happen again.Bhelabhers eyes gleamed.Ill revamp your data banks so that youll be amazed at the myriads of facts that you didnt know were there.Dar stiffened.That had an unpleasantly definite ring to it.Bhelabher turned to him, beaming, to confirm it.The General has accepted my application, you see.Im going to stay here on Wolmar; and set up an information storage and retrieval system.And streamline our bureaucracy a bit, Shacklar added.Youd be amazed at all the points of inefficiency hes noticed already.The Honorable Bhelabher has been gracious enough to place his considerable talents at our disposal.And gracious of you it is to say so.Bhelabher gave Shacklar a polite nod that bordered on a bow.Privately, Dar shuddered, and wished he werent going to be staying.He had an idea that living under Bhelabhers streamlining wasnt going to be much fun.But then, hed figured without Shacklars restraining influence.Certainly the General had worked wonders in the Honorable already.But I do realize that Im not the man for any more of a job than that here.Bhelabher explained to Dar.So Im sending my resignation back to Terra.Dars eyes widened.It was too good to be true.Even if it was sort of what Cholly had figured would happen  And my staff will be staying here with me, Bhelabher went on.The General assures me theyre needed.That, Dar could believe.Most of Bhelabhers staff were female.This, however, leaves me without someone to carry my resignation back to Terra, Bhelabher noted.Dar suddenly felt very wary.Would you like to see Terra, Ardnam?Shacklar murmured.Dar held onto his chair while the blood roared in his ears and the world seemed to grow insubstantial.Escape!And to Terra!Im afraid you must decide rather quickly, Shacklar went on.The courier ship that brought the Honorable is scheduled to blast out of orbit in three hours, bound for the colonial branch government on Haldane IV.From there, youll have to arrange transportation to Terra, and I dont doubt itll take quite a few transfers.Theres very little direct traffic to or from the Central Worlds.Dars mouth went dry.Dont get me wrong, Id love to do itbut I dont have much experience at that kind of traveling.No, nor do you know how to work your way through the web of the I. D. E.  bureaucracy on Terrabut I understand theres a young lady, just in from the home planet, whos been in your company lately   Sam Bine, Dar croaked.Yes, a Ms.Bine.I know its beastly to ask her to leave so soon after shes arrived; but, in view of the importance of the matter   She was just leaving, anyway.Better and better!Escape to Terra, and with a female traveling companion!Or should I say, I think I can talk her into it.Please do.Shacklar picked up a pen and made a note.With luck, the two of you might reach BOA about the same time as my request for clarification of the Honorable Bhelabhers credentials.You could cancel that, you know, Bhelabher pointed out.Shacklar looked up, his face a total blank.Then the light slowly dawned.Do you know, I believe youre right.You see?Bhelabher beamed at Dar.Theres so much I can do here!True, Dar agreedbut he wondered how long Shacklar could keep up such high quality acting.Long enough for Bhelabhers resignation to reach Terra, at least.Youll have an official pardon, of course, Shacklar added.Ill do it!But, uhjust one question  Yes?Shacklar blinked mildly.Whyll it be so hard to find the right person in the BOA bureaucracy to give your resignation to?Because, said Bhelabher, my appointment to Wolmar was a very highly classified secret.Dar managed not to look startled.6  But if it was such a deep dark secret, how did you find out about it?Dar demanded.Sams lips thinned.Oh, all right!If you really have to knowI was a clerk in the classified division, with a top level security clearance.Oh.Dars lower lip thrust out as he nodded slowly.Yeah, that makes sense.Werent your bosses a little, ah, taken aback, when you resigned?Very, Sam said grimly, especially when they found out Id turned into a Hume.I had a very difficult time getting a passport.How did you manage it?Sam shrugged.Very involved.Lets just say I know how to handle a bureaucracy.Uh, yeah, I dont think I really want to know the details.Dar pressed a hand over his eyes.But you did get away.Thats what counts.Not all that much, Sam answered with a grim smile.There was a commercial traveler outbound from Terra on the same liner I was on, and he made every transfer I did, up until the last leg from Haldane IV to here.Agent, following you?Cholly grunted.Sam nodded, and held out her glass for a refill.You sound as though you recognize the symptoms.In a manner of speaking.Cholly poured.Now, Im certain its just my nasty, suspicious mind, butI do believe that nice young blond man from Bhelabhers staffs been keeping an eye on you.Just my glamor and magnetic personality, Im sure, Sam said dryly.Ive noticed him, too.In fact, Idve had tove been blind not to.Well, every secret agent has to learn his trade sometime.I know a way to ditch him, Dar ventured.So do I, she said sourly.Leave Wolmar.Dar stared.Howd you know?Sams head lifted.You mean you were seriously going to recommend that?Whats the matter, am I getting to be an embarrassment?No, no, just the other way around!Dar said quickly.You see, Ive got this great offer to leave, but I have to take somebody with me who knows the ropes in the Terran bureaucracy.The silence stretched out while Sams lower lip slowly protruded.So.They made you an offer you couldnt refuse.Well, I wouldnt say couldntbut I wasnt about to.How about it?Sam frowned.The ideas got its appealIve learned what I wanted to here.But this place has a lot of advantages over Terra, if you know what I mean.No, Dar said promptly.I cant imagine how any place could have an advantage over Terraespecially a backwater like this.Cholly turned away to put glasses back on shelves, whistling tunelessly between his teeth.Dont worry, Sam said bitterly, you will.And, although I wouldnt mind a return visit to Terra, I have a notion Id very quickly find myself looking back to this place with nostalgia.How do I get back here if I want to?It took me ten years of saving, just to get the fare out here in the first place.Well, I think Shacklar might be induced to guarantee your return fare, Dar said judiciously.He seemed awfully anxious to get me to leave.Sheriff trouble?No, no!Im taking Bhelabhers resignation back to Terra!Cholly dropped a glass and spun around.Thats all I need to hear.Youre going.An sore you.He aimed a finger at Sam.Cant leave this poor, innocent lamb to the mercy of them Terran wolves.Ill guarantee yer return fare, if it comes to it.Done!Sam slapped the bar.Im off on the road back to Terra!But why cant Bhelabher take it back himself?Because hes staying here.Cholly dropped another glass.Oh.Sam chewed that one over.How about his staff?Theyre staying too.Seems well be needing em.No, dont tell meyoure cutting into me glassware.Cholly held up a hand.Shacklars giving em all jobs.Dar nodded.Bhelabhers going to revise the filing system and streamline the bureaucracy.Well, there goes private enterprise, Cholly sighed.No, Bhelabhers not that bad, Sam said judiciously.He did a fine job as long as he was only in charge of the records for Terra.It was when they put him in charge of the records for the whole I. D. E.  that he ran into trouble.Oh?Cholly looked up, with a glimmer of hope.He had the ability, but couldnt handle responsibility, heh?Sam nodded.Something like that.As long as he was able to take orders, he was fine.It was being top man that stymied him.Better n better.Cholly nodded.Then no doubt hell take Shacklars orders to leave some glitches in the bureaucracy.Sam frowned.Why?It makes for flexibility, lass.If the bureaucracys too efficient, it gives the central government too much power, and they control every aspect of life.But a little inefficiency  now, that leaves some room for a man to beat the system Well!Youll only have one problem, then, Dar.Dar looked up, startled.Whats that?Shacklar thinks youre Ardnam Rod now, and all yer papersll be made out to him.Oh.Dar pursed his lips.That will be a problem, wont it?But not much of one.Sam patted his arm reassuringly.Trust your traveling bureaucrat.Dar frowned.Wheres he going?Who?Sam pressed up to the window, craning her neck.That guy in the coverall, going over to the control shed?Yeahhes the pilot!Whos going to fly the ferry up to the courier ship?Sam shrugged.His relief, I suppose.No doubt hes taking a planet side leave.Hes just had a weeks worthor, no, I cant really say that, can I?Right.For all you know, hes run daily missions since Bhelabher came in.But I didnt know we had a relief pilot down here.Is it your job to know the duty roster?Dar turned to her.You know, as a traveling companion, you might get to be a bit difficult.Sam shrugged.Youre free to choose any other BOA clerk you can find here.Well, I suppose I could talk to one of Bhelabhers people.Dar turned back to the window.But somehow, I think youd be a little more   Dependable, I assure you, murmured an approaching voice.Dar stiffened.Company.Oh, I have no doubt of that, Bhelabher was saying hurriedly.But the situation is not.I am concerned that our courier might be delayed.Dar and Sam turned around slowly as Bhelabher and Shacklar came toward them.I suggest you have a word with him yourself, and warn him of the pitfalls of the journey.Shacklar looked up.Well, Ardnam!This will be bon voyage, then.He clasped Dars hand tightly and gave it a shake.Youve been a credit to my command here, young man.Ill be sorry to lose youbut do remember how great a service youll be performing, for all of us who remain here on Wolmar.Its a pleasure to do my duty, sir.Dar took Shacklars commendation with a grain of salt, since Ardnam had only been under Shacklars command for a week.Shacklar released his hand and stepped back.I believe the Honorable has a word for you, too.Bhelabher pressed in, and Shacklar turned away to Sam.Be careful, young man, do be careful, Bhelabher said loudly, drawing Dar further away from Shacklar and Sam.He dropped his voice to a low rumble.Now, I hadnt wanted to mention this to the general; after all, theres no need to worry him with something over which he has no control.Dar instantly felt a need to worry.Uh  such as?When I was back on Terra, and in an office of some influence, some members of the LORDS party approached meyou know of them?Uh, yeah.Dar wet his lips.Theyre the arch conservatives in the assembly, arent they?I wouldnt have used the arch a week ago.I do now, though.Bhelabher shook his head in wonder.What an amazing planet this is!About the LORDS, Dar prompted.Indeed.They approached me, to see if I would be interested in joining in a scheme to overthrow the Secretary General and establish a temporary LORDS junta, to govern while the I. D. E.  government could be restructured along more efficient lines.Dar stood rigid, feeling like a resistor in a high voltage circuit.Youre  talking about a dictatorship.Certainly; its the most efficient form of government there is!Oh, sure.Dar passed a dry tongue over drier lips.Of course its efficient.It just wipes out all those silly time wastersyou know, parliamentary debate, public input, elections, trial by jury.All those silly, inefficient boondoggles.Indeed it does.And as an administrator, I can assure youthey do take a great deal of time.They also encumber an amazing number of people, keeping them from tasks in production.Dar nodded sardonically.And all you get for all that time and trouble are little, unnecessary luxuries, such as liberty and justice.Make no mistake; they are luxuries.Bhelabher smiled with sudden, amazing warmth.But they seem much more important out here, where they help people to actually do something!Kind of makes up for the cost?Well worth it, well worth it!In fact, Ive a suspicion liberty is actually cost efficient, in a growing society.But you couldnt prove it, to the LORDS?Bhelabher smiled sadly.Would they even listen?Id think so.Dar frowned.Even a conservative can have an open mind.Not if hes in power.Efficiency matters far more to those who give orders than to those who take them.Bhelabher held up a forefinger.Take the Minister of the Exchequer, nowhis purpose is to keep the economy of the whole I. D. E.  family of planets as high as possible.Uh, with respect.Honorableisnt the correct word profitable?No, it certainly isntbut the Minister very quickly comes to believe that it is.Consequently, he tends to frown on anything that costs more than it makes.Dar frowned.Such as?Such as trade to the outlying planetsfor example, Wolmar.Now, hold on!Dar was amazed to realize he was getting angry; he fought down his temper, and went on.We always ship out a lot of pipe weed.Indeed you dobut Ive seen the trade reports, and the goods I. D. E.  sends to you cost far more than your pipe weed bringsnot even counting the shipping cost.No, I. D. E.  shows a definite loss on you.Well, youll pardon me if I think were worth it!Of coursemore than worth it.But how do you explain that to the Minister of the Exchequer?Hm.Dar frowned.I see the problem.And therere a lot of planets like ours, arent there?Upwards of thirty.Bhelabher nodded.Thirty frontier worlds, and the Minister shows a loss for each of themthirty or forty billion BTUs apiece.It adds up to a very substantial drain on the economy.Itll pay off, thoughsomeday!Dars temper kindled again.Give us time, and well be sending out more than we bring in!A sudden thought nudged Dars brain.He cocked his head to the side, gazing at Bhelabher through slitted eyes.Its no accident that you mentioned the Minister of the Exchequer, is it?Bhelabher stared at him in surprise.Then he smiled sheepishly.Indeed its not.Yes, the Exchequer was the LORD who came to call on me.And his argument was very persuasivevery persuasive, indeed!And once he had me believing that the outlying planets should be cut off and left to their own devices, he arranged my appointment as governor.So  thats  why!Then another sudden hunch hit, and Dar frowned.You wouldnt be telling me this if you didnt think I could do something about it.I dont know if you can or not, Bhelabher said earnestly, but you must try.It isnt easy to gain an appointment with the Secretary General, young man, but if you can, you must tell him that Electors Boundbridge and Satrap are leaguing with General Forcemain to attempt a coup detat.Can you remember those names?Boundbridge, Satrap, and Forcemain.Dar nodded, repeating them silently in his head, getting the meter down.Boundbridge, Satrap, and Forcemain  yeah, Ill remember.But this is the top man in all of human civilization were talking about, Honorable.Hes not going to believe the ordinary young punk off the street without some pretty powerful evidence!He shall have it.Bhelabher pressed a slip of paper into Dars hand.Memorize that set of numbers, young man, and when youve done so, burn the paper.The Secretary General has only to put them into the nearest computer terminal, and the screen will display an excellent little collection of documents, complete with signatures.Dar stared at the slip of paper.But  but how did you ?Find them?Bhelabher smiled.I do give myself some credit, young man; and I know that I am an expert on data storage and retrieval.When Id spoken with Minister Boundbridge, I was thoroughly convinced; but my bureaucrats instincts still functioned, almost by themselves.I was determined to aid the LORDS coup; but I was also determined that I would not be made a scapegoat if anything went wrong.Dars eyes widened.My lord!Is human trust that far gone on Terra?Bhelabher waved the objection away, irritated.It has been for centuries, young manprobably ever since the Chinese invented bureaucracy.One of the first rules you learn in an office is, Get the directive in writingand keep a copy.And if I knew that, certainly Satrap and Forcemain did, too, plus whomever else was involved in the conspiracy.I knew theyd each have saved their own bits of evidence.But how could you find it?Bhelabher smiled, preening.People dont hide things in chests with false bottoms, or secret rooms, anymore, young man.They hide them in computers, with secret activation codes.But whatever code one man can think up, another can deduceespecially if he has his own computer to do the donkey work of searching.I am an expert, after alland I did have some time.Dar stared.You mean you actually managed to break each of their personal codes?Only Satraps and Boundbridges; General Forcemain held his inside the military computer, which is somewhat better protected against even expert pilfering.But the Electors dossiers sufficedespecially since they directed me to several others.No, young man, that code Ive given you will reveal enough documented evidence to convince even the Secretary General.The slip of paper suddenly seemed to burn Dars fingers.He held onto it resolutely, the numbers fairly searing his retinas.Somehow I dont think Ill have any trouble remembering these numbers now, Honorable.Stout fellow!Bhelabher clasped his arm and pumped his hand.Ill be eternally indebted to youand so will quadrillions of other persons, most of whom have not even been born yet!Ill collect when theyve grown, and the interest has, too.Dar forced a smile.Dont worry, HonorableIll do my best.More than that, no man can ask.Bhelabher looked up.Except possibly your commander; I see he wants another word with you.He stepped aside, and Shacklar stepped up.Its about time to depart, Ardnam.A high pitched whine hit their ears as the ferrys coolant pumps started up.Sam pushed her way through the door and strode over to the small ship.Allow me to escort you, Shacklar murmured, taking Dar by the elbow and steering him out the door.Once outside, he raised his voice to be heard over the beginning rumbles of superheated steam.You do realize the importance of the mission youre undertaking?Yeah, to make sure BOA leaves us alone, Dar called back.Uh, General   Shacklar gave him an inquiring blink.The Honorable just told me about a coup the LORDSre planning, back on Terra.Think I should take him seriously?Oh, very seriously.Ive been sure it would happen for quite some time now.Dar whirled to stare to him, appalled.You knew?Well, not knew, really.I cant tell you the date of its beginning, nor who will be behind itbut I do see the general shape of it.Any man whos read a bit of history can see it coming.On the inner worlds, its all about you, the signs of a dying democracy.Id been watching it happen for twenty years, before I came out here.And thats why you came out here?Shacklar nodded, pleased.Youre perceptive, young fellow.Yes.If democracy is doomed on the interstellar scale, it can at least be kept alive on individual planets.Especially one thats far enough away from Terra so that whatever dictatorship replaces the I. D. E.  will just forget about it, Dar inferred.Shacklar nodded again.Because its too costly to maintain communication with it.Yes.By the end of the century, I expect well be left quite thoroughly to our own devices.Not a pleasant picture, Dar said, brooding, but better than being ruled by a dictator on Terra.So what should I do about it?Do?Shacklar repeated, surprised.Why, theres nothing you can do, reallyexcept to make the quixotic gesture: inform the media, if you like, or the Secretary General, or something of the sort.You cant mean it, Dar said, shocked.We cant let democracy go down without a fight!But it already has gone down, dont you see?And all you can gain by a dramatic flourish is, perhaps, another decade or so of life for the forms of itthe Assembly, and the Cabinet, and so forth.But that wont change the realitythat the frontier worlds have already begun to govern themselves, and that Terra and the other Central Worlds are already living under a dictatorship, for all practical purposes.Ask anyone whos lived there, if you doubt me.Dar thought of Sams disgust and despair, and saw Shacklars point.Are you saying democracy isnt worth fighting for?Not at allbut I am saying that all such fighting will get you is a lifelong prison sentence in a real, Terrestrial prison, perhaps for a very short life.The press of social forces is simply too great for anyone to stop.If you really want to do something, try to change those social forces.Dar frowned.How can you do that?Shacklar shrugged.Invent faster than light radio, or a way of educating the vast majority to skepticism and inquiring thoughtbut dont expect to see the effects of it within your lifetime.You can start itbut itll take a century or two before it begins to have an effect.Well, thats great for my grandchildrenbut what do I do about the rest of my life?Shacklar sighed.Try to find a nice, quiet little out of the way planet that the new dictators are apt to overlook, and do your best to make it a pocket of freedom for the next few centuries, and live out your life there in whatever tranquility you can manage.Which is what youve done, Dar said softly.Shacklar flashed him a smile.Well, its still in process, of course.It always will be, for the rest of your life.Which is how youre going to maintain your illusion of meaning in your life.Quite so, Shacklar said, grinning, and can you be certain it is an illusion?Not at all, Dar breathed.If I could, it wouldnt work.But that line of thought is supposed to induce despair.Only if you take it as proof that there is no purpose in lifewhich your mind may believe, but your heart wont.Not once youre actually involved in it.Its a matter of making unprovability work for you, you see.I think I begin to.Dar gave his head a quick shake.Dunno if Im up to making that little pocket of freedom, though.Youll always be welcome back here, of course, Shacklar murmured.Two minutes till lift off, declared a brazen voice from the ship.Youd better run.Shacklar pressed a thick envelope into Dars hand.Youll find all the credentials youll need in there, including a draft on the Bank of Wolmar for two first class, round trip fares from Wolmar to Terra.He slapped Dar on the shoulder.Good luck, and rememberdont be a hero.Dar started to ask what he meant, but Shacklar was already turning away, and the ship rumbled threateningly deep in its belly, so Dar had to turn and run.Took you long enough, Sam groused as he dropped into the acceleration couch beside her and stretched the shock webbing across his body.What was that high level conference all about?About why I should flow with the social tide.Hm.Sam pursed her lips, and nodded slowly.Quite a man, your General.Yeah.I really feel badly about deceiving him.Dar rolled back the envelope flap.Whats that?Sam demanded.Dar didnt answer.He was too busy staring.Hi, there!Sam waved.Remember me?What have you got there?My credentials, Dar said slowly.Whats the matter?Arent they in order?Very.Theyre all for Dar Mandra.Oh.Sam sat quietly for a few minutes, digesting that.Then she sighed and leaned back in her couch.Well.Your General  perceptive, too, huh?7  The courier ship had room for ten passengers.Dar and Sam were the only ones.After five days, theyd both tried all ten seats at least twice.No, really, I do think it looks better from back here, Dar said from the seat just in front of the aft bulkhead.You get more of a feeling of depthand its definitely more aesthetic to feel the force of acceleration on your back.What force of acceleration?This ship could be in free fall, for all we feel.Built in acceleration compensators, remember?This cabins got its own gravity unit.Luxury craft, Dar griped, absolutely destroys all sense of motion.Which makes it far more aesthetic to sit in the middle of the cabin, Sam opined.You get the sense of the environment this way.She spread her arms.The feeling of spacelimited, but space.Youre immersed in it.Yeah, but who wants to be immersed in molded plastic seats and creon upholstery?If your accommodations bother you, sir   Dar looked up at the stewardess in annoyance.I know: I dont have any choice about it.Not at all, sir.I can offer you a variety of other realms of reality.The stewardesss chest slid open, revealing several shelves crammed with pill bottles.All guaranteed to make you forget where you are, sir, and make the time fly.And my brain with it.No, thank youIll stick with the old fashioned narcotics.A plastic tumbler rammed into his palm; the stewardesss finger turned into a spigot, and splashed amber colored fluid and crushed ice into his tumbler.One old fashioned, sir.I had in mind a martini, Dar grumbled.But thanks, anyway.It is unnecessary to thank me, sir I am merely   A machine, yes.But it keeps me from getting into bad habits.When do we get to Haldane IV?Thats got to be the twelfth time youve asked that question, Sam sighed, and I told you as soon as wed boardedBhelabher said itd take us five days!I know, I know, Dar griped, but I like to hear her say it.When do we get to Haldane IV, stewardess?Experienced space travelers never ask when, sir, the stewardess answered, a bit primly.I love the programmed response.Dar leaned back, grinning.Look at it this wayits a faster trip then I had on the way out, Sam offered.That took a week and a half.I believe the ship transporting you on the outbound swing was a common freighter, sir  Miz!Oh, really?But I believe youll find that an I.

E.  courier ship is a bit faster than your earlier conveyance.In fact, were approaching breakout now.Stretch webbing, please.And the stewardess rolled into her closet, clicking the door shut behind her.Talk about bad habits!Sam snorted.Or didnt you realize you were making fun of her?I know, I know, Dar growled.But I have definitely taken a dislike to that machine.Programmed by a snob, Sam agreed.Come on, wed better get ready.Approaching breakout, the resonant PA ships voice informed them.I dont know why we bother.Dar stretched his shock webbing across his body.What could happen when you break out of H space, anyway?Yknow, youre getting to be a pretty surly bird.So, Ill get a worm.Youve got to admit, there isnt even a jar when you break out into normal space.Not unless theyve got you bottled up.Dar frowned.Whats that supposed to mean?Sam sighed.Its a holdover from the pre I. D. E.  days, when there wasnt any central government and things were pretty chaotic outside the Sol system.Pirates used to lie in wait for ships at the breakout points.They couldnt touch a freighter while it was in H space, but they could jump it as soon as it broke out.Oh.Dar felt a slight chill of apprehension.Uhthe central government isnt too effective, these days  Breaking out, the ships voice informed them.We will be without interior power for a few seconds.The lights went out as all the ships power was channeled into the isomorpher, translating them back into normal space.A surge of dizziness washed over Dar, and objective reality became a little subjective for a second or twoin fact, it seemed to go away altogether.Then it came back, and the lights came on again.Dar blinked and turned his head from side to side, to see if it still worked.On second thought, maybe the webbing isnt such a bad idea.Please maintain your position, the ships voice advised.There is an unidentified craft in pursuit.Dar looked over at Sam.What were you saying about pirates?Not in this day and age, certainly.But she looked a little pale.I think they said something like that in the early 1800s, to a man named Jean Laffite.Dar turned to stare out the porthole.You know, you can actually see something out there now.Of coursestars.Were back in normal space, remember?So what did he answer?That ones got a discernible disk; must be Haldane Who?This Jean Laffite.OhStand and deliver.Dar peered through the porthole.There was more; I forget the exact wording, but it had something to do with the ownership of a place called the Caribbean Wow!An orange glare lit up the cabin.That was close!Sam said through the afterimages.I think thats what they used to call a shot across the bow.This is serious!Sam yelped.Wheres the Navy when you need it?Ask the piratesIm sure they know.So do I; I got one of the Navy data operators drunk one night, just before I quit, and got the access code out of him.Dar frowned.Whyd you do that?I wanted to make sure I was going to be safe on my trip out here.And I found out I would be; there wasnt supposed to be a sailor for fifty parsecs.The nearest fleets a hundred seventy five light years away, over toward Aldebaran, sitting on their thumbs and polishing the brightwork.Whatre they doing there?Somebody called em, about a year ago, to come take care of some pirates.So, while they were on their way out, the pirates were coming back here!Great!Dar said.Sam took a deep breath.Now, wait a minute.Wait a minute.Were getting carried away here.For all we know, those arent pirates out there.Sure, maybe it is the Navyand for all they know, were pirates.If youll pardon my saying so   A brilliant flare lit up the cabin.Sam shrieked.Im convinced!Its pirates!Dar shrugged.Pirates or Navyafter weve been turned into an expanding cloud of hydrogen atoms, Im afraid I wont really care much about distinctions.Youre right.Sam loosed her shock webbing.Whoever it is, weve gotta get out of here.Dars head snapped up, startled.Then he waved an airy hand toward the porthole.Surebe my guest.Its a great day outside, if you face sunwards.Of course, the night on your backside gets a teeny bit chilly.Credit me with some sense, she snorted.This ship must have some kind of lifeboat!But Dar was looking out the porthole.Get down!Startled, Sam obeyed.A rending crash shot through the ship, and she slammed back against the cabin wall.Dar bounced out against his webbing.What in Ceres name was that?Sam gasped.They got tired of playing games.Dar yanked his webbing loose and struggled to his feet, bracing himself against the pull of acceleration.They shot to maim this time, and they had some luck.They got our gravity generator.Whered you say the lifeboat was?Itd make sense to put it between the pilots bridge and the passenger cabin, wouldnt it?Right.Dar turned aft.Since that makes sense, itll obviously be between the cabin and the cargo space.Lets go.Sam started to protest, then shut up and followed.The ship bucked and heaved.Dar caught the tops of the seats on either side, bracing himself.Sam slammed into his back.Near miss, he grated.We got hit by a wave of exploding gas.Wish I had time to watch; this pilots doing one hell of a job of dodging.Is that why my body keeps trying to go through the wall?Yeah, and why it keeps changing its mind as to which wall.Come on.They wallowed through a morass of acceleration pull to the aft hatch.Dar turned to a small closet beside the hatch, and yanked it open.Two on this side; therell be three on the other side, I suppose.He took down a slack length of silver fabric with a plastic bulb on top.Here, scramble into it.Sam started struggling into the space suit.Little flimsy, isnt it?Dar nodded.It wont stop anything sharper than a cheese wedge.Its not supposed to; the lifeboatll take care of that.The suits just to hold in air.The ship bucked to the side with a rending crash, slamming Sam up against him.Jumpsuit or not, he realized dizzily, she was very definitely female.Somehow, this didnt seem like the time to mention it.She scrambled back from him, and kept on scrambling, into her suit.Theyre getting closer!Hurry!Dar stretched the suit on and pressed the seal seam shut, being careful to keep it flat.Sam copied him.Then he braced himself and touched his helmet against hers, to let his voice conduct through the plastic.Okay, turn around so I can turn on your air supply and check your connections.Sam turned her back to him.Dar checked her connections, then turned on her air supply.When the meter read in the blue, he tapped her shoulder and turned his back.He could feel her hands fumbling over him; then air hissed in his helmet.He took a breath and nodded, then turned to the hatch, wrenched it open, and waved Sam in.She stepped through; he followed, and pulled the door closed behind them, wrenching it down.Sam had already pushed the cycle button.When the air had been pumped back into the reserve tank, the green light lit up over the side hatch.Dar leaned on the handle and hauled back; the three foot circle swung open.Sam stepped through, and Dar stepped after her.He sat down, stretching the web over his body.Sam leaned over to touch helmets.How about the pilot?Hes on his owngot his own lifeboat if he wants it.Dar punched the power button, and the control panel lit up.You know how to drive this thing?Sure; besides, how can you go wrong, with two buttons, two pedals, and a steering wheel?I could think of a few ways.Dar shrugged.So Im not creative.Here goes.The READY light was blinking; he stabbed at the EJECT button.A five hundred pound masseur slammed him in the chest, and went to work on the rest of his body.Then the steamroller lightened to a flatiron, and Dar could breathe again.He sat up against the push of slackening acceleration and looked around through the bubble dome.It had darkened to his right, where a sun was close enough to show a small disk and kick out some lethal radiation.But that didnt matter; the silver slab of pirate ship filled most of the starboard sky.Way too close, Dar muttered, and pressed down on the acceleration pedal.The flatiron pressed down on him again, expanding into a printing press.
