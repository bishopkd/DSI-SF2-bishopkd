The  lamps strung up around the yard made little   pools of light in the dusk, and partygoers  clustered underneath them.Richard was right.You could see everything from here.She looked carefully,  mentally dividing up the area and thoroughly  scanning one section before moving on to  the next.And    "There!""You can see him?""Yes. "She glanced up at Richard.He was staring out the window, his eyes fixed on some  object.She turned back to the scene."Mediu m blue suit, going bald?over there, next to  the woman in the red caftan and all the gol d beads  see?That man who keeps bouncing  up on his toes when he talks?""Him, yes.I'd already thought so from seei  ng that picture.If he told you his name's Roger, I'd say that just about settles it. "He  watched a little longer."Definitely too drunk  to talk to. "Then he turned to face her, and once mo     re she could feel her heart hammering.She  paused a moment, listening.There was a second sound mixed in with it."I can hear your  heart beating," she whispered, and impulsively laid her hand on his chest.He put his arms  around her, and pulled her close; and then they kissed, and for a while the rest of the  universe went away.When they broke off the kiss, the way he  looked down at her was like someone reading,  and he looked at her for a long time."As a matter of fact, no," he said conversationally."I  don't do this sort of thing often. "He kissed her again."And neither do you, he added."Thank you," Yvonne said."I was about to sa  y something stupider than that.What do  you want to do?""A lot of things.Take my hand.You really can't see in the dark, can you?There's a door  over in the corner.It has a lock on it. ""And on the other side of it?""A big, lumpy old sofa and a dead TV set.And something even better. ""What's that?"she said, feeling for the wa ll.She heard the door open somewhere in front  of                                                                                    her."A fuse box switch that'll turn off the  power to the whole poorhouse.Nobody will come  bothering us if they have to make their way through a couple of unlit rooms to do it. ""Oh, you are clever," she said."Are you sure you haven't done this before?""I'm sure.It's the sheer inspiration that's making me ingenious. "* * *      A long time later, he shifted position, kissed her neck and ear, and murmured "I lied. ""Past pluperfect subjunctive," she said sleepily."What did you lie about?""The 'not doing this very often' part. ""Already having some doubts about that. ""Shucks, ma'am, that weren't nothin'. "He ran his finger slowly up the inside of her thigh,  starting from her knee, and smiled in satisfac  tion to feel her spine arch backward, and  hear her long soft gasp as she inhaled."What  I meant to say," he continued, "is that I'm  not really committed to that interactive model. ""Is that so?"She squirmed slightly to get better leverage, then wrapped one leg around  his waist and tucked her heel into the small   of his back."I think I can live with that. "Yvonne felt a thrill as she was finally able to leave the expanse that was I 85 and  enter the four lane road that is 316, the Atlanta Highway.She unconsciously began  singing the B 52s Love Shack to herself.She reflected joyously that she had passed the  CNN Center, Fulton County Stadium, and the  other relics of the days when Ted Turner  seemed to run a country, instead of trying to give all his money away to places such as  the United Nations.It isn't, she thought, that everything in Atlanta is named Peachtree  Somethingonly bad novelists believe thats o much as the city has moved beyond  Peach trees.That thought shifted the soundtrack of her mind to Aerosmith.I'm not a Rag Doll myself,    she reaffirmed to herself.Her thoughts moving to Rory  Edwards.Richard Isaacs had been a pleasan  t flingit had, after all, lasted one night  more than she had expected.She had ultimatel y (that second night) decided that even his skill at selecting clothes that made him look five years younger was not enough.It would  not compensate for the fact that his life was  spent playing games, and that he would play  her for as long as he wanted.Her friend Su e Young had once told her, Every once in a  while, you just have to bend over and take it.Sue had casually continued, being explicit  about where, and Yvonne had been appropriate ly offended.She also realized her friend  would never understand that sex was about pow er, not love.Putting yourself into such a  position would forever reduce your role in the relationship, until you both started hating  you for doing it.(Yvonne had seen articles that noted that some  hot tramps who might be seen as  her competition proclaimed their enjoyment of  that particular proclivity.She shuddered  at the thought, wondering idly if that m     eant that the next generation would be  romanticizing the Ordinary Housewife of   yesterlore.She couldn't romanticize women  who had thrived in the South by feeding their husbands high cholesterol foods and  encouraging them to go hunting and fishing in   all types of weather.The premature  deaths may have produced pensions, life insu   rance, and financial security, but steel  magnolias could only enjoy the second half of  their life, and then only when the affairs  of the first half went unacknowledged. )She drove toward the exurban area that a  llowed Atlanta to describe itself as a  metropolis.Even the namesAlpharetta, Mariettaindicated places where the Man of  the House kept the little woman.It was     as if the transition to soccer mom from  Ordinary Housewife had never occurred.Me  tropolitan Atlanta was more an extended  backwoods area than an accelerated city.Now that Turner had taken the cash, and the suits in New York had destroyed much of  the rest of the empire, Yvonne wondered how  the next generation would fare.Not that she cared about the twenty somethings with tongue piercings.They were  a large reason she found her greatest successes with the Levitra generation.She preferred  men who no longer found drug enhanced pleasures  of the flesh more important than a  woman who could keep them interested for      the half hour or so before the drug was  effective.Her men were those whose definiti  on of foreplay largely consisted of being  able to look fondly, share a glass of expensiv e wine, and listen nostalgically to Doo Wop  or other classic rock.Pleasant conversation and lubricated condoms did the rest.Today, thinking of Rory, Yvonne pondered   what to wear.She approached the  well monikered Commerce, with its delightfu  l selection of stores.She even enjoyed  watching those daddy's little cuties spend far too much at Petite Sophisticate and J.  Crew  on clothes that did far too little for them.N ot, she reflected uncharitably,  that they need  their clothes to do as much for them as I do.She imagined how she would approach Rory.She would shyly reach out, the very  model of an ingnue, which both of them w  ould believe for the moment she was.She  would seductively remove his glasses from hi s face.Should she speak?What is the male  equivalent of You're beautiful without your  glasses?No, just to act silently would be  better.She would move simply.Gently touch him her fingers, hinting of nail.Caress that  solid torso.Add a heartfelt c oo about how strong he must be.To tilt her head slightly,  hinting at supplication.He should see worshi  p in her eyes.To slowly move her other  hand to his Grecian formula temples, running the fingers (more nail this time) through it.To exalt how impressive it is that his hair   is still intact, while widening her grin to  highlight her White Stripes teeth.(Should she show a hint of tongue?)Finally, there would be a slow, apparently natural, motion of the hand from hair to  removing the glasses.Is he nearsighted?His ag e hinted not.He would still be able to see  her.She decided to proceed directly to m oving the glasses slowly down to her side, and  rub them with her blouse as if cleaning them  thoroughly, forcing his eyes to travel down  her body?Another tap of his fabulous torso, lingering this time with a comment about his  not needing the Vaseline and oils of a Stall one.She would note his lack of love handles  while tilting her own torso to highlight her gl  orious 38Ds.They were impressive, she  knew, even now when they were no longer supported by nature.Thank God for Howard  Hughes, she mused.If he'd gone for those boy girls, instead of Jane Russell, women's  rights would have been set back twenty years.Yvonne pulled into the Tangers Outlet Mall,  reassuring herself that Rory would  not track fashions intensely, the way Richard does.(She remembered the pivotal scene in  some clothing movie, where the blonde wo  man catches the man knowing fashion and  realizes he is gay.She could not, for the hundredth time, consider Richard in those terms.Rejecting the possibility again, for the hundredth time, she tried to concentrate on Rory  Edwards.She was distracted by the list of things she  needed to buy, clear from her scenario.There  would be a tasteful shade of red nail polis  h, lip gloss, hand cream, moisturizer, tooth  polish, and a flavored mouthwash.For the la    tter, she contemplated mint, but had a  breakthrough with the idea of cinnamon, something to surprise him.She considered a touch of dye,  not that I need it , but gloried once again in her  glowing auburn tresses.Her mother clai      med she had inherited them from her  grandmother.She decided a green hair clip,  which would also highlight her eyes, would  be sufficient.But the most important part was the outfit.If she was going to be rail meat on his  yacht, she would have to look the part, and nothing in her wardrobe was quite perfect yet.There was a purple silk blouse from she   had bought at Neimann Marcus, but she had  worn it to a party of Callie's three years a  go.She was afraid Rory had been there and  would remember it.She couldn't remember hi m from that party, but had been during her  enchantment by Calvin.And men claim only women are bewitching.She skirted past the Georgia Tech and UGA girls grabbing last year's halter tops  and tube dresses for the coming summer.While she fancied that her body could still  support a tube dress, she needed something more traditional for Rory.There was no point  in emphasizing the difference in their ages, trivial though she thought of it.She knew this  quest well, given her natural proclivity toward men who could legitimately be considered  late middle aged, old enough to know bette r, but careful enough about their bodies to  keep them in peak shape.This expedition re quired an outfit that would have been daring  in his day, but would appear restrained    among what currently passed for fashion.Which meant a bright green dress (the hair      clip would have to be purple), fishnet  stockings, and, most importantly, a good fitting push up bra.So, it was to the bra shopping first.She wanted a nice lace, wondering if black  would be too daring and rejecting red out     of hand.Perhaps white would be safer,  especially since the dress was likely to be a bit translucent.Selecting a bra , she thought,  is one of those tasks that  makes women wish for a  penis, a flat chest, or both.The hours she had wasted in ju st the past few years, not to  mention all those she expected to waste over  the next several decades were frightening.Not even two bras of supposedly the same  size and make would fit wellor, often, even  similarly.And two different labels were a su re sign that a 38D would be a 40E would be  a 36C.Heaven help her when she realized that  Calvin had been correct in saying that her  left breast was smaller than her right.Bra  shopping was like trying two pairs of shoes to  make one pair.Still, whether it was Life with Rory or there was some Mr.Right who followed him in  her pantheon, this roundelay would not end.Even while her plan was still hatching and  the glories of an anticipated seduction c ould still be savored, Yvonne suspected this  would not be her last relationship.Exhausted before she began, she eschewed  the Leggs Hanes Bali Playtex store  for Claires.Yvonne searched first for a Nu  Bra.She knew that Playtex might be the  result of her search for something to    signal a longer term, traditional woman.The  temptation of going strapless and backless   in the world of A cups, WonderBra, and  plastic surgery for 54 year olds was tempting, though.The result she finally found was worth the effort.Black lace top, solid white cups,  support, comfortable sweat absorbing interior, a nd a silk exterior for that first maneuver  of his hand.Even that it had been made in China, where all of the women who worked on  it probably did not measure to her own endowment, did not stop Yvonne from wondering  at the marvels of modern American culture.The bra found, she moved on to Elisabeth      for dresses, glorying again that her  flowing locks meant that she really had but  two basic choices in color, green or purple.And the climate of Atlanta allowed either colo r to appear appropriate at least ten months  out of the year, setting herself off against   the verdant landscape and the glories of the  sunsets as if it were natural, instead of  planned down to the hour.She thought ruefully of  the fashion disaster that would have come   from living in Chicago, where Calvin now  cohabited with his not even a handful trust fund bimbo.She considered the timing of her impending liaison and decided she should take a  Lavender Sunset approach to the evening.A 7:30 meeting could be leveraged to its  fullest.His view as she approached their   outdoor table, fashionably late, would be of  herself set off by the glowing yellow red b ackdrop and highlighted by the verdancy of  the surrounding deciduous trees.She decided this meant that her hair would have to be down and around her  shoulders.Maybe a flowerlilac?daisy?instead of a hair clip.It would appear  positively antebellum, with a hint of knowing couture.A lavender Donna Karan, with a neckline that did not plunge so much as  gracefully hint (well, it may have been in  tended to gracefully hint, but her pulchritude  always more favored grace than hinting), tapered at the waist to highlight the firms of her  hips and derriere, ending slightly below the knee to show her calves off in good stead  while hiding the scars from the skiing accident  that had caused her to meet Calvin at that  lodge in Vail, selected, Yvonne left the store, wet with both the success of the expedition  and the anticipation of the night to come.Andrew Venice parked his car on the street in front of the house and double   checked the address he had written down on a slip of paper.Yeah, this was the place all  right.It was an ordinary house, on an ordinary street.There was nothing special about  it, just plain.Nothing here looked like it might be connected to murder or assault or  anything like that.Richard Isaac, the man      hed come to interview, was a stock  manipulator, and youd think hed live in a fancier place, a nicer house, on a better street.But since he was also a police informant, maybe he wanted to keep a low profile, not do  anything to stand out.Not exactly like the witnesses' protection program, but not all that  different.Or maybe he just wasnt that good at manipulating stocks.Venice would try to  find out, in addition to finding out what he really came here to ask about.He put the note on the front seat, and hi  s sunglasses in the glove compartment,  checking his reflection in the rearview mirror and smoothing back his hair.Turning forty  was hard.He didnt know what hed been planning to do at forty, but he was damn sure  this wasnt it.Oh well.It was his job, and he was the one to do it.Hed better get going,  ask his questions, make his report.Then hed have time to stop by the gym later, work  out a bit, fight off the ravages of time.He was still in his prime, even if he had to work  harder to maintain it.Getting out of the car, he looked both ways, then shut the door and used the  keyfob to lock all the doors.It wasnt  a bad neighborhood or anyt hing like that, but he  still didnt want to take any chances.He let a minivan go past, then an SUV, then he  walked around the front of his car and up the  long sidewalk to the porch.A bench sat on  the porch, the kind you might sit on and drink some lemonade, but it didnt look used,  like nobody had had any lemonade to drink there for a while, or maybe they just didnt  like the porch or something.Isaacs probably had to keep a low profile anyway.He  wasnt the kind of guy who spent a lot of time outside making friends with the neighbors.Venice went to knock on the door and stopped.There was a flyer lying on the  welcome mat.No, it was one of those bags   of advertisements they paid neighborhood  kids to deliver, one of those circulars.there was a cardboard box full of them just off to  the side of the door.He picked up the new  one and held it in his hand as he knocked on  the door with his knuckles, loud enough so       anyone inside could hear him but not  pounding or anything like that.Watching his  reflection in the storm door, smoothing the  lapels on his suit jacket so hed be sure to look nice, the door opened.Richard Isaacs was the man who answered the door.He looked over Venice  wondering who this guy was at  his door, and what he was doing there.Venice got into  his pocket and pulled out his wallet, flipped it open to a show hid badge.Hi, my name is Andrew Venice, he said cheerfully, like there was nothing  unusual about him showing up there in the middle of the day.Im here to ask you a few  questions.Its no big deal.That was just what Venice wanted him to think, Isaacs thought.They always said  it was no big deal when they were trying to nail you.I found this lying outside your door, Andrew said.You want it?What was this guy trying to do, being friendl y to him.No, just toss it there into  the circular file, Isaacs pointed.Toss it into where?That box right there beside the door,    he said, pointed to the box.He was  getting mad.Its not a circle, its more of a square, said Venice.Or a rectangle maybe.Its a joke, all right?Now Issacs was r eally really mad.I put the circulars in  the circular file.But that crazy Venice guy just offere  d it again.You sure you dont want it.They got good deals inside, could save you some money.Just throw it away.I wish the kids would stop delivering them.Hey, listen, said Venice, sticking his ha nds into his pockets.I dont have all  day here.Im on an investigation.I came   to ask you some important questions, and I  want some answers.I dont have to answer anything you ask!Richard Isaacs replied forcefully.He  wanted to make a point.Are you going to st ay out there on the porch and scare off all  the neighbors or you going to come inside?Ill come inside and ask you my questions there.I want to ask you about  Margaret Eastman.Issacs knew he was going to be regretti   ng this later.But he said, Come on  inside anyway.Even though he didnt want the guy inside.But what were you going to  do?Thats what they expected from you once you got messed up with the police.But he  didnt have to play their game.Venice walked into the living room, not  sure what to expect.Something about  Isaacs didnt add up right.Either he wa     s living in a plain house in this plain  neighborhood because of frugality, because he     was cheap, or there was some other  reason.He couldnt figure Isaacs out, like   there was something he was hiding.Even  though Venice knew he was in his mid60s, he looked more like a tough guy than a stock  market expert.He had broad shoulders, and a narrow waist, muscular.His cheeks were  ruddy like he spent a lot of time outside in  the sun and the wind.Damn genetics.Some  people didnt have to work for anything and  had it all anyway.He didnt look like a guy  who had just turned 40 and needed Viagra to  get it up anymore.But Venice wasnt here  to feel sorry for himself.He had a job to do.And it was time to do it.Isaacs sat down in the brown reclining chair with a plop, in front of the big screen  TV, and he pointed to the couch.Why  dont you sit down, he suggested, like a man  who meant it?Venice wasnt going to let himself be pushed around that way by some informant.I think Ill stand.Thisll just take a few minutes.So get started already!Isaacs would be glad when this interview was over so  he could watch his football game.You follow the Falcons at all?Im not really a football fan, said   Venice, although he split a pair of season  tickets with his brother in law, went to half the games.He looked at the TV for a second,  trying to spot Bill in the cr owd.Bill was married to his little sister, Leslie, he adored  Leslie.Bill was a great guy, just the kind of  guy hed rather be spending the afternoon  with.Then he thought he sounded like some  wuss for saying that, so he added, I think  the West Coast offense really ought to ope  n things up for Vick though.They should  make the playoffs next year.Yeah, said Isaacs, passionately.He l  oved football.He didnt mind all the  damn questions now so much, not if this Venice character liked the Falcons.So you  wanted to ask me about somebody, some Mary, Maury.Her name is Margaret Eastman, Venice   said.His veins turned to ice at the  mention of her name.Things like that shouldnt happen to a young woman like her.Who is she?Issacs asked.Yeah!Who is she?The door to the k itchen slammed open and in walked the  most beautiful woman Venice had seen today,  or maybe in a week.The more he looked  at her, more he thought maybe in a lifetim   e, but he didnt have a whole lifetime of  experience yet.But she was incredibly beau  tiful.Her eyes burst with curiosity.Or  maybe it was jealousy.She was older, for a beautiful woman, maybe 40, maybe the exact  same age as Venice.She was wearing a br a under her tight blouse and she was wearing lipstick too, and he couldnt help staring at her.Her hair was pretty too, like it was made  out of silk, just that kind of shiny.Hey Monica, we need some privacy to  discuss business, says Isaacs.Its just  man talk, nothing youd be interested in.If its another woman again, you bet Im     interested, she said, adjusting her  breasts to make them stick out more.Venice  was still staring at her, he couldnt take his  eyes off her, and she was looking at his eyes , like she was touching herself for him, to be  prettier for him.He couldnt believe it.I dont know who she is, Issacs said,  and he was regretting inviting Venice into  the house again.You sure you dont know anything about her?Venice asked.Monica stared at him with her lips ma king a little red pout.If I knew anything  about her, you can bet Id let you know, she said, slapping Issacs on the top of his head.Ow!he said, grabbing the top of his head.He looked at Venice again and said I  said I dont know her or anything about  her.She was the nurse at the hospital where Bruce Lucent recovered from his  automobile accident, Venice said.Shes really beautiful, like you wouldnt believe.She has brown hair.I know you like women with brown hair  , you two timing jerks, Monica said,  she was hitting Isaacs on the top of his head again, and he jumped up and yelled.Stop that, I said I dont know anything, and I dont know her!I could show you pictures, Venice said.He had a lot of pictures of her, but he  didnt want to share all of them, not with this scum.It might help your memory some.Listen, buddies, Isaacs said.You came here, so you take what you get and  leave.I said I dont know nothing, I dont know nothing, thats all there is to it.Why dont you take me?Monica purred at him.Hey now, I dont like that, Isaacs said, and now he was mad at all of them for  ruining his day.He was mad enough to hur t somebody.Hed killed a man before one  time, with his bare hands, and he could do it  again, if he put something in his bare hands  like a knife or a gun or something that he could kill somebody with.Venice sensed trouble ahead, but he wanted to see more of Monica.He had the  sense though that they were just ships pa   ssing in the night, that she was just some  temporary liaison of Richard Isaacs, probably ju st another cheap tramp or something like  all the others.Maybe she could be different, but it wasnt going to be in this lifetime, not  with him.Well, if you dont know anything, I guess Ill be going, he said.Walking down the sidewalk, the car waited for him at the curb.He stopped  before opening the door and looked back up at the house.He saw Isaacs standing in the  window frame looking back at him.Some body was hiding something here, but Venice  knew he was a bulldog.Hed get to the bottom of it yet.And it didnt matter who got hurt along the way, cause he was going to find out  the answers.Richard Isaacs stood gazing out the window  from the 32nd floor executive office,  Atlanta at his feet.The streets were empty  below but for a few pedestrians dashing for  cover beneath umbrellas.Timing was everything in this business.You couldnt make a  killing when people are dying.Especially if you hadnt planned for their death.Business  thrived on stability and growth.And for that   stability, sometimes you had to play cut  throats.He heard the soft click as the door to the boardroom opened behind him.The mans broad shoulders and slim builds made his silhouette against the  window belie how close he was to retirement.As if you would retire in the middle of the  biggest hand of your life, not when youre playing cut throats.He turned.The sunlight slanting in   through the window shimmered from the  obsidian tresses of Callie Archer.She glided into the room, perfect, as always.She may  have been wearing widows' black, but the swell  of her breast, the shift of her hip against  silk, assured him she wouldnt be alone for   long, not if he had anything to do with it.Stability.All of them needed to be in Rich ard Isaacs pocket if he was going to keep this  ship on course.Archer Industries must thrive.Hed invested too much in what he knew about this  company, the way it operated and the under the t able trick's Henry Archer had used to  build it.All good products did not make a company great.Most of it was knowing how to  manipulate money and power and the markets, to find the loopholes in the laws, trade just  a little closer to the inside than many might feel comfortable doing.And when the players  get nervous, when they start worrying that their house of cards might fall, it was Richard  who knew just where to leak the word to  investigators to break up the game.And when  the dust settled, Isaacs always walked away unscathed with obscene amounts of cash in  his pocket and ever more power.It was He nry Archer who had taught Richard the game  at which Richard excelled.Archer Industries had been poised to make the next great leap.Richard and Henry  planned to bring in Isaac Stevens, a heavy     if there ever was one in the corporate  battleground.But hed crossed Richard one too many times, the last when hed forced his  daughter Irene to end her relationship with Richard, right there, loudly, on the grounds of the Polo Club before hundreds of Atlantas    most well heeled citizens.Stevens would  give Isaacs the distance he needed when they started taking over their rivals, company by  company, and piecing them out, converting the stock options, doing the deals, raking in  the dough.And if someone must fall, all along   the plan had been to take Isaac down,  while Archer Industries subsidiaries conceal ed the deals.Richard and Henry were too  good at this game to fail.Theyd only miscalculate once in their 30 year partnership: they  hadnt expected Archer to drive off a cliff.Callie gave Isaacs a bare nod, a hint of a smile as she turned her back to him and  walked along the bookcases that lined one wa  ll.She ran her fingers along the spines,  letting them linger on the masters, books that  had never been cracked.Of course, Henry  Archer was too important to be troubled with reading fiction, poetry, plays.But a wealthy  man who had built his company from nothi       ng needed a library, and he needed to  surround himself with art and the accouterment  s that demonstrated he was a thinking  man.But Henrys passions were the machin  ery of business, economics and industry.Those were the well thumbed books closest      to the desk.And his passions had been  serious as well.Invention, transportation, and keeping his wife content.The last mattered  most to Callie, of course.She would be well  cared for; her prenuptial agreement assured  her of that.But prestige that was something  a little harder to come by in this city.And  with a background like hers, prestige came from marrying well.At last, she settled in the seat behind that massive imposing desk from which  Henry Archer ran his world.You wanted to see me?Callie asked him pointedly.One brow arched up, almost lost in  a lock of hair that had drifted lower on he r brow, like the question mark punctuating her  sentence.I know this is a difficult time for you   Mrs.Archer, but you must understand, the  business of the company must move forward,  Richard said brusquely.He bent over the  desk toward her, his ruddy cheeks so close to hers she could see his pores.She leaned  back a little, then followed his gazes that ha d so briefly touched on her breast before it  moved to linger at her throat, in her hair, and at was pulled deep into her eyes.Henry and I spoke at length about the direction the company needs to take to be  competitive, Richard crooned as he gazed in to her eyes.This company was a passion  of his, you know, and I was about to help him double, triple its value.You need someone  in place to make those decisions now that Henry cant.Why, Mr.Isaacs, Im so pleased to hear your confidence in me, she said  demurely, though he could see a devil lurking  behind those eyes of hers; it kindled the  flames smoldering in her gaze.Of course  , I havent had much experience running a  company like Archer Industries.But, sure Henry would be pleased that it stayed in the  family.Richard leaned back.Was she playing him as he was trying to play her?What had  fired up that spark in her eye?Was she pla nning to take over the company?Did she have  the gall to do something like that?Witheffort  he pulled his gaze from hers and strode to  the window.Whats your game, Mrs.Archer?He       asked, staring over Atlanta, his voice  barely raising a little with a unconceal  ed anger.You know you dont have the experience to run a company like this.Henry a nd I worked side by side for thirty years.He pounded one fist into his open other palm  , in rhythm to his words.We built this  company together.I know what his plans were for growing the business, he said angrily.So you think you should be running it?Callie asked with that disarmingly  innocent gaze of hers, the one that seemed  to flash like the lightning playing across the  rooftops of Atlanta, moving swiftly from chimney to gable, until it reached its target with  a burst of heat and smoke.That was Callie Archers gaze.I wouldnt presume to, Mrs.Archer,  he enunciated somewhat crisply, turning  from the window to lay a gentle hand on her  shoulder.You are entitled as owner of the  company to sit at its head.But Henry had planned for some time to bring in Isaac Stevens  to coordinate some buyouts and sell offs, all of it tricky and confusing and more than a  grieving wife should have to bear, he said  in a tone Callie thought might be paternal, or  condescending, or even genuinely caring.Di d Richard Isaacs even know how to grieve  for Henry Archer?She wasnt sure even she could grieve a man who treated his wife like  any of the other baubles hed collected to build his image.Richard read the hesitation in her eyes   and leaned in close, over her shoulder.Let me guide you, Mrs.Archer.First, we     bring on Stevens, as planned.Once hes  installed, hell begin buying up Archer Industr ies competitors and dividing them up into  existing divisions, then sell them off, bit by bit, exercising options, and building this  company into the large cap company it ought to   be.He turned her in the chair so that  she faced him, the sunlight blinding on her dark waves of hair, the fire lit again in those  eyes of hers as her breasts rose in breaths that seemed to quicken beneath his gaze.Think of it Mrs.Archer, Callie, think   of it!he exclaimed.You can carry on  your life as you always have, leaving the tedious business dealings to me.But the power  will be yours.You will be Archer Industries.Itll be your books that line the walls, your  charity events in the news, your parties the town will be talking about.Who knows, you  may even find love again.I imagine a    woman of your uncommon beauty and means  would never need to be alone.Alone.As if Callie didnt already know  alone.Hadnt she survived ten years as  the bauble of Henry Archer?Callie Archer rose  from her chair, faced Richard squarely,  then turned on her heel.She again glided  through the room, touching a sculpture here, a  painting there, at last coming to the broa d mahogany doors out of her office.Her office.She turned.Isaacs was again a black silhouette against a blazing sunset, fiery red, as if he  were some demon standing at the open gates to Hell.The entire board room had taken on  the devilish glow.She swept open the door.I imagine Ill be meeting Mr.Stevens before I have the opportunity to hire him?she inquired.He swept toward her, his silhouette re solving into a well built man only slightly  older than Henrys 60 years, his face quickly  fading from the silhouette of a dark demon  to a ruddy cheeked imp who looked like hed be at home on a soccer field.If thats your wish, he offered deferentially.It is, she said, catching her breath.Something about him made her heart pound,  as if she had agreed to work in a league with the devil himself.Its time for it to be about me, isnt it?She thought to herself.Then you will meet him, he said forcefully.We have an agreement, then,  youll accept my counsel?He thrust out his hand.She took it in both of hers and leaned to ward him, tilting her head to look him in  the eye, her breasts jostling within the black satin dress she wore.I look forward to  ...working with you.Again, she gave him that glinting glance,  an almost wicked smile playing across  her lips.What was her game?!Arthur Nance looked around the country   club parking lot, crowded with cars,  minivans, and SUVs old and new, battered and gleaming, cheap and priceless.Squinting  into the late afternoon sun, the cars reflected   the red tinged light off windshields and  bumpers and mirrors and doorknobs like a pack of  bicyclists caught in a searchlight late  at night on a deserted road."Well, Jason,"  he said impatiently, "do you recognize any of  them?""No, Doctor Nance," answered his        nerdy young assistant with the pocket  protector and horn rimmed glasses that he seemed to wear as a badge of honor."But I'm  not a big car guy, you know that, and I haven't got  all their cars in here yet anyway. "He  waved the sleek brushed chrome Compaq iPac in  Arthur Nance's face, as if Arthur could  see that it was so light that he really couldn't have any cars in there yet."Well, you'll have to work on that, because I really hate it when I have to leave a  place I wouldn't have gone into if I'd known   whose car was parked out front.Okay?Start on it tomorrow; has it done by the Miller's pool party on Saturday?""Okay, Doctor Nance, will do.Want me to go inside now?"Yeah, you do that, Jason. "He wished he could smoke a cigarette while  he waited for Jason to return, but the  gravel topped parking lot was just too public  a place for one of Atlanta's top doctors to  light up and hurt his image, which was of a trim, muscular, athletic medical genius who  played a mean game of a racket ball with a golf disability of two.He'd just have to wait  until he got home, assuming he went home   alone, which he rather doubted because so  many women wanted him, what with his near perfect body, huge mansion, and  astronomical salary, that he almost never went home alone unless he felt like it.Behind his back, stiletto heels clicked,   but not sharply and intensely like they  would on wood or marble, rather with a      little sogginess to them, a sort of muffled  slurping caused by their impacting asphalt that had gone soft and resilient in the hot  Atlanta sun.He liked stiletto heels a lot, so he turned to see who was coming.It was Callie Archer, old Henry's widow  .God, she was a looker, with those  glossy black tresses and fine, fines hooters.She smiled and came toward him.Even  though she was about forty, she still had an ass  to die for, although he was more of a leg  and foot man himself, which is why he preferred stiletto heels to pumps or running shoes."Hello, Arthur," she said saucily, laying a  perfectly manicured hand on his arm in a way  that promised interesting things to come, "is Jason inside making sure it's safe for you to  go in?""Yes," he exclaimed, studying the smooth  white fingers tipped with crimson and  filed to glossy perfection."Y es, he is," he laughed, because it was a joke between them,  even though when you came right down to it, it didn't much amuse him when he wasn't  with Callie.Arthur Nance had a very poor memory for faces, especially women's faces,  because he almost never looked at their faces , especially if they were wearing open toed  shoes with stiletto heels and had bright red  polish on their toenails, like Callie was.He  had a fantastic memory for bare boobs and na     ked apses, of course, but those weren't  likely to be on display in the country club's   party room, at least not so early in the  evening.In fact, the only reason he recogni  zed Callie was she'd been his patient for  going on twenty years, now, and after twenty  years, it's hard not to recognize somebody,  unless the light's bad or they've got a new haircut or something.So wherever he went, he took his assistant Jason with him, because Jason not only  had a photographic memory, he liked to look at women's faces, and besides, he had all  their pictures in his Palm Pilot anyway, just in case.Callie squeezed his forearm and leaned      so close to him that her big breasts  brushed his bicep."How many are you up too now, Artie?"she demanded."Fourteen, I think, maybe fifteen.And   don't call me Artie in public, okay?It  diminishes the authority a doctor needs to do his job right. ""But I can call you Artie when we're alone  together and I'm kneeling at your feet  and your pants are down around your ankles, can     't I?"her eyes flashed dangerously."Because if I can't, then maybe I'll have to   wash my hair on Friday night instead of on  Saturday morning, if you know what I mean. ""Aw, shucks, Callie, sure you can call me  that  when we're somewhere nobody  can hear us, it's just, you know, when we're so mewhere with lots of people. "His voice  trailed off as he waved his free hand at the empty parking lot."That's good, Artie. "She patted his hand."Shall we go in together?""As soon as Jason oh, here he is. "The nerdy young assistant stood before them , his eyes fixed on Callie's beautiful  cheekbones."Okay, Doctor Nance, it's safe.There's not some singles woman in there  with a restraining order against you. ""You're sure?"he inquired."Last Thursday, at the Gaieties"         "Yeah, I feel bad about that," he said    sadly, "but who would have expected  Melissa Kriegel to be in a bedroom with somebody so early in the party?""Melissa?"asked Callie indulgently."Was she with Walter?""No," he said sardonically, "Dorothy. ""Ah," she said and put more meaning in to that one single unbroken syllable than  an entire stack of a psychology textbook."Well, then, if the coast is clear, let's go in.Are you coming, Jason?"He blushed at the question, and shook his   head form side to side."No, Doctor  Nance likes me to wait out front so that  if anybody on the list shows up, I can warn him  before they get within fifty feet of him. "Arthur nodded.Those fifty feet were impor tant.He'd spent a whole night in a  county lockup once because he'd thought fifty, fo rty, what's the difference?Ten feet, the  cops had told him belligerently, as they'd taken his belt and shoelaces and neckties and  fingerprints.He tucked Callie's right hand under his left arm and led her inside.It was noisy, the kinds of noisy th  at only happening wh en you stuff a hundred  people into a room built for seventy five, give  them all a couple of high powered drinks,  and let the band crank its amps to max.The air conditioners were probably raising a  ruckus, too, but who could hear them over the roar of the crowd?From the far side of the room, Isaac Stevens raised a hand to Arthur and picked  his way through the press of humanity to  him, pulling a beautiful young woman along  with him by the hand."Arthur," he said softly, "just the man I've been looking for. "He  crossed the last ten feet and thrust out his hand."Hello, Callie. ""Hello, Isaac," she responded sedately, but her grip tightened on Arthur's forearm."Arthur," he said, taking a pull on his drink, and his speech was a little slurred, so  it was as clear the vodka in his glass that this  wasn't his first drink of the night, or even  his fifth, for that matter, "you know my daughter Irene, don't you?""Yes, of course," he said at once, inwa rdly glad that Isaac had told her who she  was because he really hadn't recognized her, not in this setting or that skin tight emerald  cocktail gown cut so low that it made a man  want to punch his fist at the sky and shout  "Wee hah!"After all, the last time he'd seen she was in a dimly lit restaurant on Peach  Street, sitting in a booth at the back with Henr  y Archer so close that it was hard to tell  where one began and the other left off, he r right hand under the table but apparently in  Henry's lap, from the contented yet anticipatory gleam in old Henry's good eye."And Callie," said Isaac, his expression simmering, "I do believe I haven't seen  you since the funeral.You're looking l    ovely tonight, my dear, as you always do,  whatever the circumstances.May I presen     t my daughter Irene?Irene, this is Mrs.Archer, whose husband Henry died recently. "Callie extended her hand to the blonde young thing and murmured, "It's a pleasure  to make your acquaintance. "Irene took a deep breath, some breaths th at made her large breasts look as though  an anti gravity beam had just rippled thr  ough them, and then took Callie's hand."It's  very nice to meet you, Mrs.Archer.I'm sorry to hear about your husband. ""Why, that's very kind of you," she riposted.Watching all this, Arthur Nance quirked an eyebrow, but so inconspicuously that  no one but he could see.Very interesting, he thought to himself.Old Henry's widow and  old Henry's bereaved mistress, pretending   not to know each other, when to Arthur's  certain knowledge, the two had, on more than one occasion, shared the same bed in order  to pleasure the old man and make sure he   never developed eyes for anyone else.Yes,  very interesting, he thought to himself.I wonder what's raising?Besides that, I mean, as  he subtly adjusted his trousers.As Yvonne Perrin climbed the stairs to  Rory Edward's penthouse, she could not  shake the ominous feeling of dreadful fear that dampened her day.It was a beautiful day  in Atlanta, Georgia, fair too partly cloudy,  with temperatures in the low 80s, dropping to  60 around midnight, it was the type of day Yvonne  usually found to make her feel like a  child again.But it was not to be that way today, as cruel fate would have it.Rory's penthouse was on Peachtree Street       in Atlanta, Georgia.Rory often  wondered how he would afford it, secretly afraid that his job might be not as secure as he  was led to believe.Just the other day, Mr  .Ricketts, his boss, had called him on the  carpet and read him the riot act over the problem with the Zimmerman telegram.This  made him feel bad.But Rory never told   anyone this, so Yvonne had not known of his  fears.But he appreciated her visits , and today Yvonne was bringing him a box of doughnuts wrapped in bright red plastic wraps that reminded her of the day she boiled the  eggs, even though she knew Rory wouldnt be there to appreciate it.Rory's door was open when Yvonne Perrin got  to the top of the stairs that were  unusual.It was a large wooden door, usually painted white, that Rory bought at an estate  sale in Milledgeville, Georgia, the capital of the state before the Civil War and General  William Tecumseh Sherman's famous marc  h through Georgia during the Civil War  burned the city to the ground, both cities, actually, It (the door) had three hinges and a  doorknob, as well as a doorknocker in the shape of a horseshoe that didn't work.It was a  real find and Rory often regretted the fact  he had never gotten it properly appraised by a  licensed appraiser.It was one of Rory's  biggest regrets, eating at him like a monster  devouring his soul and spitting out the remnants  of his shoes in little bits of leather and  oil.Yvonne went inside Rory Edward's pent  house.It was decorated with yellow  walls, with an 8 x 10 color glossy photos of  Rory's pet dog Barky on one of the walls.The dog was a champion show dog, winners of   many gold medals, but had to be put  down after.Rory had never gotten over it,   sobbing uncontrollably whenever he ate at  Burgher King.The picture window faced East , overlooking the river, a thin blue ribbon  in the distance.Yvonne and Rory love to   hold their hands and watch the sun setting,  especially in winter, when the average hi gh temperature was only 53 degrees.There was  a smell in the air that Yvonne couldn't identify.Callie Archer suddenly entered.She     was wearing only a bathrobe!Naked  underneath!Yvonne was shocked and startled!What was Callie doing there?!Callie was wondering the same thing!"What are you doing here?"she demanded.Callie didn't know what was going on."I  had not expected you today, Yvonne,"  she commented cattily."Never mind that!"Yvonne exclaimed."Where is your husband, Bruce?""Well, you know," Callie cried hesitantl y, her long glossy black hair hanging in  front of her face.She hated when that happened and slid it aside.Yvonne was confused.This was impossible!"Would you like some donuts?"she  offered, holding the bag."Do you have any chocolate?"Callie asked."I think they were out," stated Yvonne  bitterly, opening the box.
