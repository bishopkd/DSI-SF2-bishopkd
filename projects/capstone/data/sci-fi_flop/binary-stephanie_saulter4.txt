Phoenix, systemic, metabolism, mutation, gold mine.She makes notes, keeping track so she can look them all up later.This is turning out to be a good meeting.Binary       11 Aryel Morningstar walked through an orchard, and the digital savant Herran walked by her side.In between the neat rows of apples and pears, their spread eagled, wire tied branches thick with leaves and swelling fruit, she could see rooftop after rooftop.As they turned from one graveled path into another the upper landscape of the city surrounded them, broken only by the line of the river to their right.Amid the drab gray of cooling towers, power plants, and vent stacks, some of the nearby roofs sprouted gardens too.But nowhere was as thoroughly cultivated and gloriously fecund as the flat top of Maryam House, with its troughs of fruit trees, vegetable beds, and tubs full of flowers and herbs.A gorgeous sunset painted the sky shades of lilac and peach and crimson.She had brought him up here, out of the familiar confines of his own space, to emphasize what would be required of him if he agreed to go to BelNatur.She had more than half expected him to refuse the proposal out of hand, almost hoped he would.Instead he had accepted, it seemed to her too readily.You dont have to do it, she repeated.And if I am completely honest, Herran, if I speak to you just as your friend, the truth is maybe you shouldnt do it.I do.It might not be safe.You make safe.She stopped and turned to look directly at him.He stopped in tandem, and after a moment he also turned, with that stiff, ever so slightly mechanical motion of his, and stared back at her.He never used to be able to maintain this much eye contact, she remembered, and she thought again of how far he had come, and how much he stood to lose in this venture.Ill do everything I can, she said softly.Ill have to get some help.Youll need Callan, I think, as well as Eli.But theyll have to agree to it.BelNatur say no?Im not worried about that part.I think BelNatur will agree to whatever we ask if it means youll help them.They want you very badly.Herran looked away, his scarred face expressionless as always, his pale eyes taking in the roofscape around them.Make pay.Yes, it is a way of making them pay.But dont do this just for that, Herran.Do it if you want to, not because you think you should.Should.Also want.Why, Herran?Why do you want to?My brain, he said, and was silent for so long that if she had known him less well she would have thought that the entirety of his answer.But she could see the shifting of his eyes as he searched for a way to explain.Learn my brain, he said finally.Talking code to people, people to code.No one else can do.Not even Rhys.She waited.BelNatur learning, he went on.Make others talk code too.Build interface, maybe they talk like me.See like me.Think like me.A little bit.Maybe they understand.He rubbed a hand through his glowing curls, and knocked the heel of his palm roughly against his temple one, two, three times.There was a metronomic rhythm to it.It was something shed seen him do before, when he was struggling to express a desire or a concept just beyond the language capacity with which hed been left.Despair washed through her, a tide of recognition and heartache for the loneliness he was unable even to name.Her vision blurred.Oh Herran, she whispered.My sweet Herran.Thats not what they have in mind at all.I know.I know not same as me, Aryel.But maybe a little bit same.He cocked his head and looked at her quizzically, then reached out, astonishingly, to touch her face.Why tears?She took his hand gently, pressed her lips to it, and brushed at her eyes.When she spoke again her voice was rough, but steady.Because sometimes I think about the choices that are left to us, my friend, and it makes me very sad.She let go of his hand.Are you sure?He nodded.Standing, especially out here in the open, the rocking seemed less pronounced.Sure.All right, then.When she explained it to him the next morning, Eli was shocked.Aryel.Why would you trust her?Ever?The only thing about her that I trust is her instinct for self preservation.She has everything to lose and nothing to gain here.If she harms Herran, or exposes him, shell take away the only reason I have not to see her thrown into a cell next to Carrington.Isnt that where she should be?She stared at him, then rustled her wings and looked away, toward the narrow ribbon of windows that let in the morning sunshine and a view of the Squats.She had asked him up to her apartment, a cavernous space that took up almost all of the top two stories of Maryam House, to relate the details of her meeting with Zavcka Klist.Perched on stools in the kitchen, they were more than halfway up the double height walls that had been created when most of the floor in between was knocked through.From here it was no more than a single long stride to the slender safety rail that prevented the unwinged from falling off what remained of the upper level, and plunging twelve feet down to land on the floor below.The entire apartment was laid out like this, a cavity in which a concealed flyer could stretch, with the living and sleeping spaces arranged as a series of inward projecting balconies and rooms around the perimeter.She could get from one to another with a couple of beats; visitors had to make do with the narrow walkways that had been left along the edges.Now she pulled her eyes back from the strip of sky outside the windows, sipped from a mug of tea and grimaced.Should she, Eli?Really?I know, Im sorry, he muttered.The price is too high.He dropped his chin into his hands and rubbed at his temples.And you say Herran wants to do it?He does.She explained why.So hes hoping theyll actually replicate the way his brain works?Using infotech alone?Something like that.She wants the same thing of course, but not for the same reasons.I didnt realize Herran felt so isolated.I mean that hes bothered by it.He always seems so...contained.She circled a meditative finger around the rim of the cup.Her voice was thoughtful, distant.I think that most people want to know there is someone else, somewhere in the world, who they can relate to.Who knows who they are, who understands their fears and joys and challenges.Uniqueness is tough, Eli.I think Herrans become a bit frustrated by how slow we all are, and the foolish things we find to be interested in.He sipped from his own mug and swallowed, watching her closely.You must feel like that too.She smiled.What, slow and foolish?That no one really understands what its like to be you.That is self evidently true.Her eyes were back on the windows.But at least my isolation isnt mental.And you learn to live with being an aberration, especially when you know how much worse your life could have been.Oh, for the love ofAryel, you are not an aberration.He stared at her in consternation.Unexpected, I might accept.Perfect he wanted to say, and found it frighteningly close to the tip of his tongue.He bit it back.She glanced over at him briefly, and looked away at the windows again.All trace of the smile had disappeared.Arent I?You sound very sure.Im completely sure.And I cant believe you actually think that.For a long moment she stared at a spot somewhere in the unanchored midpoint of the vast room, lost in thought, or memory.Then she seemed to recover herself, straightening up with her usual brisk energy, putting the empty mug down and meeting his eyes.He feltas he always dida momentary faltering, a lightning flash of self doubt that assailed him every time he tried to hold that sky blue gaze.They thought that.I never forget that I am not what they were trying for, Eli.Just the slightest edge had come into her voice.I was an accident.There were casualties.He put his own cup aside, carefully.This was more than she had ever been prepared to say before, and he felt an almost scholarly sense of obligation to push at the door she had cracked open.What sort of casualties?My batch siblings.Others.Even one success from a small batch was something most gemtechs would have celebrated, back in the days of radical modification.But she said they had regarded her as an unintended outcome, a fluke.What were they trying for?Im not sure.Something a lot more dangerous than I turned out to be.Is that even possible?he asked, managing a smile, although the bitter note in her voice was unsettling.He surprised himself with the faint echo of it he heard in his own tone.Oh yes.She arched an eyebrow at him, forgoing the modesty of a denial.I think were all very fortunate that they failed.Who were they?Ambitious proponents of progress.Clever creators of life.Titans of industry.The usual.The words dropped like stones into the well of the room, with a bitten off finality that he recognized.Aryel.He shook his head, gave up.Are you ever going to tell me where you came from?I hope not.She sighed.So.Herran.Will you help?And just like that, her voice was back to normal.He blinked in astonishment, and she smiled.It was like the sun coming out.Of course.Exactly what do you want me to do?I want you to be his guardian there.You speak their language, youll understand what it is theyre trying to do, if its unsafe or unacceptable.Im going to ask Callan to be part of the team as wellHerran will need him for communication, especially at the beginning, and Callan will help him feel safe.But he wont be able to assess the bigger picture the way you can, and youre someone they have to respect.Zavcka already knows she cant bully you.He turned this over.Callan is highly empathic and very bright, and if he thinks that Herranor himself for that matteris being treated improperly hell pull the plug without hesitation.You dont need us both to protect Herran.Youre after something else.He looked at her expectantly, and she chuckled.I am.Although given Callans own history I wouldnt have wanted him to go in alone with Herran anyway.Its why Ive asked you first.She pulled the clasp from her hair and fiddled with it, frowning.The culture change within BelNatur that Zavcka talked about.I need to know if its genuine, or just the usual corporate PR bullshit.I thought you were sure it wasnt real.I assumed so from her speech, knowing her as we do.But now, having gone there and seen her without an audience, Im less certain.She tried to blackmail you!Aryel looked up at him, amused.And I blackmailed her right back.Look, Im not suggesting that she personally is any less unscrupulous than she ever was.But the way she went about it, the assurances she gave around Herran even when she still thought she could force the issue, didnt seem condescending or false.She didnt like having to deal with me, but she did so as though I were an equal with whom she had to do business.And the place did not feel like an old school gemtech.The staff members were mostly young, and the vibe I got from them was what youd expect from a modern, progressive company.That haughtiness you usually get with the gemtechs, even when they think theyre being polite?Well she still has it, although you could tell she was trying to tone it down, and I reckon her security director is a made over enforcer.But the rest of them werent anything like that.Shes brought in a whole new set.A whole new mindset.That, said Eli slowly, is interesting.Carrington carried the can for the Gabriel affair, so why would she have bothered to force through that kind of transformation?She didnt need to.I wonder if she didnt look at the situation and decide she did need to.First of all to give herself some cover against Carringtons accusations, but also because shes clear headed enough to know the company has to adapt if its going to survive.Look at Gempro and Modicomm and the others, still struggling to come to terms with the Declaration.BelNatur is miles ahead, and thats because of her.Whether she likes it or not, she gets that gem suffrage isnt going to be reversed.She gets that the market in human gemtech isnt coming back.And the old attitudes arent just wrong these days, theyre commercially damagingbecause as long as they keep on believing that gems really ought to be products, theyre not going to be able to turn us into customers.And yet.What was human gemtech originally for?Eli got it.Making healthy babies.Which is not a problem for norms anymore, but for gems...Exactly.You know about Mikal and Sharons situation, and theyre not alone.Procreation is the next big thing that gems are going to have to grapple with.Its not just an ethical debate with the Reversionists, its a real, live existential problem.But we dont know yet if we can stomach the gemtech solution.We need someone we can trust to help us figure that out.You mean me?Aryel, that goes well beyond my area of competence.No it doesnt.Its no bigger than the questions youve already asked, and answered.It isnt just about whats moral, but whats feasible.Whether the gemtechs, or a gemtech, are starting to turn into the kind of organization we could actually stand to work with.Herran being at BelNatur gives us access, leverage, and a test case.You want me to assess the shift in the corporate culture of BelNatur.I do.What makes you think Ill find out enough just from going along with Herran?Because you being allowed to poke around and talk to people and discover what you need to is going to be part of the price.He sucked his breath in sharply, as the full extent of what she was proposing unfolded before him.Shell hate that.Yes she will.But shell do it, because shell hate the alternative more.Eli nodded, acknowledging the point, accepting the mission, and aware once again of being subtly, gently manipulated.She had given him many reasons to say yes and none to say no; and no basis whatsoever for the latent sense of unease that coiled at the back of his brain.There was no reason, none at all, to think there was more to this task than he was being told.The implications he could see were quite enough to take his breath away.They had the potential to remake the world.And yet he felt he stood on the edge of a precipice, and could see only a little way down.Binary       12 The director of the genestock archive was convincingly baffled.But we havent had a security breach, he said again.How can you be here to investigate something that hasnt happened?If our investigation confirms it hasnt then well be out of your way just as quickly as we can, Dr.Chang.But it has been reported to the police that quarantined genestock has disappeared from within this facility.I sincerely hope that proves not to be the case, but Im sorry to say that we cannot simply take your word for it.One of the other two men in the room shifted and made a sound in his throat.He stood to the side of Chang, facing Sharon and the detective shed conscripted from data forensics, and was already proving to be a pain in the ass.Sharon switched her attention to him.You have something to add, Mr.Nance?I dont know who reported what to youhe squinted suspiciously at the warrant, pulsing on the screen of the tablet where she had propped it on the tableDetective Inspector, but this is a waste of time.You dont have to take our word for it.Just check the datastream.Youll see that none of our genestock is missing.Nance had been introduced as chief operating officer, an administrative role that freed up Chang to focus his scientific expertise on the research potential and policy conundrums of the archive itself.While Chang appeared bewildered, Nance seemed to feel it was part of his responsibility to deal robustly with any suggestion of malfeasance within the organization.Sharon was also beginning to suspect that he had a problem specifically with her.There was more than a hint of recognition, and repugnance, in the looks he sent her way; a reaction she had become used to in the years since her marriage to Mikal.For her own part she could not shake the feeling that he too was somehow familiar, but the name had not triggered any alerts from her case files.She had concluded that he was simply yet another example of a type she knew well: middle aged and middlebrow, a once solid physique beginning to run soft, the customary complacency of a thoroughly respectable life more than a little shaken by finding himself questioned by a senior police officer; and the buttons of his outrage further pushed by the facts of said officers personal life.He was dealing with the occasion as they often did, veering between pugnacity and defensiveness.As I said, Mr.Nance, I hope youre right.Well know soon enough.She glanced over to her colleague.Are we all set?He nodded.Theyre in position.As soon as these gentlemen unlock the storage units we can get started.He chewed at his lip, as though a thought had just occurred to him.Of course we could just force the locks.See how hard it is, and what kind of alert it would actually generate.He gazed past her at Chang and Nance, who stared back, aghast.Sharon maintained her mask of impassive professionalism, but inside she was grinning.Im sure that wont be necessary.Will it?This directed at the two men on the other side of the table.Absolutely not, replied Chang stiffly.We will cooperate fully with the police, of course.Ken?Kendrick Nance stabbed at the screen of his own tablet.He looked balefully back at Sharon.You want us to open all of them, then.He looked ready to proceed, as though eager to prove the pointlessness of their visit.No, I dont, Mr.Nance.Were going to open the units in sequence just as we discussed, and lock each set behind us before we move on to the next.We are also, as detailed in the warrant, going to add me and Detective Sergeant Achebe here as alternate third approvals.As of right now, nothing is accessible without us.I must say, Inspector Varsi, that this seems very heavy handed Dr.Chang.You want us to confirm that there is nothing wrong here and go away as soon as possible.Well believe it or not, thats what I want too.The best way to achieve that is to ensure we have a quick, clean count, with absolutely no loopholes for anyone to point out to us later.She held his gaze, keeping her voice even but firm.As soon as our checks are complete well remove the restriction and be on our way.If everything is in order it shouldnt take more than a couple of hours.We can let them get cracking while we update the system, added Achebe, and Sharon nodded again, eyes front on Chang.They watched while Nance, jaw tight with anger, entered a code and handed the tablet to Chang, who tapped in a series of commands.He then leaned forward for a retinal scan and gave the tablet back to Nance, who tapped some more before staring into the red pinpoint of the vidcam for his own scan.A soft beep sounded from the tablet.You should have access now, Sharon said into her earset.She listened for confirmation and flipped a thumbs up to Achebe.He stepped forward, reaching over Nances shoulder to press a memtab against one of the tablets intake ports.Nance scowled at the screen as the logo of the Metropolitan Police flashed up.He spread his hands in a theatrical relinquishing of the tablet and stepped back, watching in silence as Achebe pulled up an input panel and added the new layer of security to the existing protocols.Nance and Chang were instructed to authorize it with a second set of retscans, and then Sharon and Achebe added their own scans, and the tablet was finally, politely, handed back to its owner.I think we have a right to know, said Chang, who has made this accusation.The suggestion that genestock has been stolen, and that we didnt report it, is, is a serious one.It is indeed.Sharon nodded sagely.However, you dont have any right to know the identity of the source, and I couldnt tell you even if you did.The report was made anonymously.Youre putting us through all this on the basis of a tip from someone you dont even know?sputtered Nance.There was a triumphant note in his voice, as though his indignation had finally been justified.I have a mind to call my Call whoever you like.Sharon was getting tired of his sniping.She wondered if the real reason for it would boil out and into the open, and how Chang would respond if it did.The police are obliged to review every allegation that is properly made and registered.She reeled off Sections and Codes and Acts of Parliament and was rewarded by the chastened look that descended on Changs round face, though Nances pugnacious expression remained much the same.Its not necessary for a complainant to identify themselves in a matter such as this, as long as they supply sufficient evidence for us to reasonably suspect that a crime may have been committed.Check with your own legal advisers if you dont believe me.She was watching Nance keenly and openly, and saw him register the appraisal in her gaze.To her surprise he appeared to rein in his contempt.Instead he affected a look of boredom, as though he doubted what shed said but could not be bothered to refute it.So: a private bigot, not quite up to the risk of airing his views in front of his boss.Chang cleared his throat.Can you tell us what this evidence was?No, I cant.But if it proves baseless, rest assured Ill turn my attention to finding out how it was produced and who sent it.I dont like having my time wasted either.She glanced at Achebe, now seated and busy with his own tablet, sending searchbots trawling through the datastream as he tried to hunt down the source files for the screenshots that had brought them here.She did not tell them that the data detectives generally worked out who a whistleblower was within the first half hour.Nance shifted in his chair.Look, okay, youre only doing your job, he said, but what thispersonhas told you is impossible.It couldnt have happened, and we couldnt not know if it did happen.So Im sorry if we seem a bit aggravated, but its just, well, you may not know how ludicrous this is, but we do.Though his words had turned conciliatory, there was still a drawling arrogance in his voice.Sharon had spent a solid hour working through the supposed impossibilities, and emerged unconvinced.How often do you take inventory, Mr.Nance?Its taken automatically.Every time a storage unit is opened, by anyone for any reason, its registered and the system records whether any of the genestock has been removed.Yes, but how often do you actually check the genestock?Do a hard count?Theres no need to.Dont you understand?Quantities and lines were verified when the stock came over from the gemtechs, and it was put immediately into secure storage.It cant be accessed without double authorizationtriple authorization now that youve added yourselvesfrom a very limited combination of senior staff.If anyone was able to open the storage trays without using the proper protocol a whole series of alarms would go off; it would trigger a lockdown.When access is authorized, the date, time, who by, and the reasons given are recorded, and notices are automatically routed to Dr.Chang, myself, and several others.If whats returned to storage is reduced by more than the authorized research requires, that also triggers the alarms.He waved his hands, as though at a loss as to how to explain it any more clearly.Theres no way there could be a problem that we didnt know about.The process is completely automated.I understand that.So how would you know if the system failed?How could it fail?I dont know, Mr.Nance.Thats not my question.How do you know, for certain, that it hasnt?He stared at her, his mouth opening and closing again like some kind of great fish.Sharon could feel her own lips compress into a tight line.The worst thing about this, she thought, is that although hes a bastard he could also be right, and I will be the one who ends up looking, and feeling, like a fool.Over in the corner, Achebe inhaled sharply: surprise, discovery, and, unmistakably, alarm.She turned to him, registered the hand signal that meant they should step outside.As she got to her feet the comlink to the search team pinged in her earset.She raised a finger to tell Achebe to hold on, said Yes?and listened.She let a satisfied little smile settle onto her face even as her heart sank.Across the table, Changs face was a picture of trepidation.She caught his eyes and held them while the bioforensics officer down among the refrigerated units finished her report and pinged out.Well, she said quietly.It appears there may be a problem here after all.The airwalk ran for more than a mile, parallelling the high walls of the embankment, passing the last crumbling foundations of ancient wharves and lumps of less identifiable marine archaeology.Every hundred paces or so the passage ballooned out to become a wider room dedicated to some aspect of underwater life, from which other rooms or side corridors extended.At each of the nodes there was the closet sized pustule of an airlock, through which gillungs came and went.With the tide still coming in, the top of the tubular construction was a couple of feet clear of the water.Late morning sunshine sparkled as it glanced off wavelets on the surface, a shifting diamond cascade that dazzled eyes looking up from below.It filled the airwalk with natural light, an elongated bubble of submerged brilliance against which the color of the water column changed from topaz to amber, to the deep silty brown of the riverbed.Tall weeds brushed up against the walls, bent over by the current as though in some silent, peaceful gale.Fish darted past.A shadow detached itself from the darkness, the slippery ripple of an eel swimming languidly along beside them for a while before curving away and disappearing behind one of the anchor cables that they could see spearing down into the mud.Callan was enchanted.Rhys, who had spent much of the past forty eight hours being secretly awed by the grandeur and casual sophistication of the city, felt a surge of partisan pride for the gillung technology.What happens when the tides out all the way?Itd be too bright and hot then, surely.Not to mention the lack of privacy.Rhys shook his head.The whole thing is built on a biopolymer scaffold.It maintains rigidity, and its also photosensitive below about here.He reached up, his fingers at full extension brushing the inward curving plastic barrier.As the water level drops and more light hits the tunnel, the walls gradually tint darker and darker.But theres also a chemical override that can trigger the reaction without light.Sleeping quarters are generally just left set to opaque.Youve slept in one of these?Underwater?Many times.Whats that like?Weird the first time.You have the sounds of the water all around, and its louder on the coast than in a river.You sort of have to convince yourself that it isnt going to collapse and drown you in your sleep.And gillungs generally prefer a lower temperature than us topsiders.But once you throw on an extra blanket, its fine.Callan stopped in another swelling, and tipped his head back to look up at the circle of bright water overhead.The fireglow of his hair shone like a halo against the darkened water wall of the room.Its nice and warm now.Temperature control is built into the walls as well?Yes...well, sort of.There are capacitors grouped in among the oxygen exchange cells.They store excess heat to vent back in, and they can also dump it outside if theres an overload.There are more of them along the top in a tidal configuration like this, to capture as much heat as possible.But solar radiation isnt enough, especially in winter or deep water.The tidemills are where the heat mostly comes from.They had explored the power generation system in the first of the nodes, peering through the walls to watch a paddle array billow lazily in the rivers tidal surge.Rhys pulled up vidcam feeds and interactive schematics that showed how every degree of movement translated into so many joules of energy, captured and directed to the needs of the underwater complex.He had glanced up at one point, felt a moment of vertigo as he found himself gazing into the green depths of his companions eyes, and then became aware with a start that they were surrounded by visitors.It looked like an amalgamation of two or three norm families, complete with scampering youngsters and a pair of serious teenagers who wanted to know all about everything he had already explained.He had answered politely, found them an infostream module that let them model their own power station and handed them over to the citrine haired man who swam in through the airlock to the childrens shrieks of delight.They escaped while he was patiently explaining why he couldnt put them in it to experience the blasts of hot air from the dryer for themselves.Now Callan was gazing thoughtfully around the node they were in, this one showcasing offshore permaculture.This isnt just about self sufficiency, is it?Aryels been saying so for a while, but I hadnt quite gotten it before.No.Its also how much they can sell to everybody else.These systems, theyre incredibly productive and low impact.And the tech gets better all the time.And the tech is owned by gems?The new stuff is.Rhys grinned.The gemtechs are welcome to the original versions.Less efficient, less comfortable, less safe.What a great new slogan for Gempro.Rhys snickered approval.Callan treated him to versions of the phrase in German, Russian, and Japanese, each delivered more sententiously than the next, until they were both doubled over with laughter.Other visitors to the airwalk cast bemused glances in their direction.Rhys was wiping his eyes and wishing in a confused way both to stay in the moment forever, and to already be where it felt as though it were heading, when a sealed door leading into a side passage hissed open and Reginald peered around it.Good gods.Its that quiet, well behaved boy of mine.Graca, darling, fetch me my smelling salts.Graca stepped out of an airlock into the passage behind him, shaking her quick dried hair into a shimmering lime green cloud.Sorry, Reg.Wrong century.And Rhys can laugh all he wants.She padded over to give him a peck on the cheek and look around at the display.Although I didnt think it was that bad.Its great.We were appreciating, said Callan, and was introduced.Graca looked from him to Rhys, nodded approvingly and said, Well youd better come see the rest of it, then.She had been putting the finishing touches to a coastal garden, surrounded by a loop of airwalk that kept the briny water and sea life separate from the river while allowing it to be viewed from all sides.They walked around admiring while she unlocked the entrance at the far end and updated the displays infostream.By the time Callan, Rhys, and Reginald emerged into the main airwalk again the intervening wall was as transparent as the rest, and the norm troop they had left behind in the power center were ooh ing and aah ing at a spider crab.Rhys caught Callans eye and they both turned hastily away.Reginald fell into step beside them, looking amused.So the point, said Callan to Reginald, as if continuing a conversation that had not actually been taking place, is to demonstrate all this wonderful stuff to the norms, while in the nicest possible way making it clear that its not anything they can actually go off and do by themselves.If they want it, theyre going to have to work with gillungs to get it.He ran his hand along skeins of algae based textiles as he spoke, soft and fine as silk.The back of his hand brushed Rhyss as his arm fell back to his side, and Rhys felt his fingers twitch toward it in response.Two of them were captured, hooked by two of Callans, who kept his head politely cocked toward Reginald walking on his other side.The twining fingers tightened.Rhys swallowed and stared straight ahead.Reginald chuckled.Thats not exactly how the product infostreams put it, but yes.And what if they dont go for it?Theyre already going for it.Orders have started to come in.The idea is the bigger the market, the faster the tech can develop.But they havent had a lot of funding up to now, just the Gempro settlement, and look.He gestured grandly, barely missing Graca, who ducked as she caught up with them.Its happening anyway.The only question is, who wants to come along for the ride?A questing thumb had found the palm of Rhyss hand, and was inscribing slow circles in the middle of it.He wondered dazedly if Graca had noticed as she came up behind, and decided he didnt care.The three of them were chatting away about integrated subaquatic villages and five year action plans; maintaining the appearance of composure was as much as he could manage.He felt almost grateful when an approaching group of visitors forced them out of their four abreast stroll and into double file.Callan released his hand in an unhurried way as they swung into the new formation and Rhys closed it into a fist, trying to hold on to the feeling.Binary        Disconnection The world reshapes itself around her.She is part and parcel of the transformation.Things that have never been bloom and breathe and bleat their way into existence, their cells stamped with the sigil of her fathers genius.Life is engineered, adapted, contorted; grafted, implanted, assessed.Aborted or gestated, delivered or declined.That this is acceptable, inevitableeven honorableis beyond question.Standards must be maintained, output improved; there is no time to waste on products that have value neither in the market nor the laboratory.All must earn their place.She is as proudly and profoundly unsentimental as any of her colleagues, as pragmatic and clear headed a rationalist as any crisis could require.It is a quality that even those who quail before her admire, a new conviction for a new age.Yet, though the bitter lash of her tongue belies it, she is never entirely easy inside her own skin, never completely sanguine about her own strange and unlooked for state.It pins her just enough outside the ordinary that she sometimes seems to herself almost as odd and unnatural a creature as those other creatures, bred and built to serve their betters.With the one, the crucial difference; the factor that makes all the difference.Still, something is wrong, and the wrongness must be righted.She is a woman of long memory (and, she fancies, longer foresight), and in the company of her cell cultured cousins she senses a danger she cannot name.Though nothing she and her compatriots do needs give her pause, she feels a time might yet come when it would be best to sit just a stage or two distant from the blood and sweat and tears of their inventions flesh cloaked reality.The time may indeed be now when the vexatious business of final genesis is best kept at a remove.She has endured enough of it, goodness knows, and it is the least pleasant, most fraught part of her responsibilities.After too many years watching swelling surrogates mill and murmur behind one way windows, diligently stamping down any tendernesses they conjure, she has had enough.She declares that division dead and sells off, outsources; embraces the quieter clamor of molecular manipulations, the inch square clarity of the microscope.She knows the retrenchment is seen as a retreat, and does not care.The dissociation she feels requires a resolution, and removal of the cause seems to do the trick.Besides there is a threat there, she can feel it, however amorphous and infantile it might yet be.It is as minute as the cells and sequences her technicians must now content themselves with, but it is growing.She understands that it may come to life without her, but she will not be the one to give it birth.She is too well acquainted with calamity to be the architect of another upheaval.She has already seen the world change once.She suspects it may not be beyond imagining for it to change again.Binary       13 Sharon and Achebe sat across from Masoud.She had spent the last ten minutes succinctly relating the days discoveries at the EGA, and watching his face grow longer with every word.Now he grimaced at the report infographic on the desk screen before him, splashed with far too many gray unknowns among the red and orange high hazard flags, and rubbed his temples wearily.So youre telling me we still have no idea who, how, or why.Or when, Sharon said.It could have happened at any time since the EGA was set up.Possibly over a period of time, Achebe added.Since we dont know how it was done, we cant assume it was a single event.The police commander glared at him balefully.Achebe twitched and shrank back in his chair.His departments inability to determine how the EGAs security systems had been breached was singularly failing to impress.Sharon cleared her throat, drawing Masouds attention back, and out of the corner of her eye saw the other detective relax a little.My guess is that it wasnt, she said.In order to maintain viability the genestock would have had to be transferred into some kind of temperature controlled bag or case.It wouldnt need to be large.The vials are tiny.She held up a little finger to illustrate.But enough is missing, and from enough different locations throughout the archive, that I cant see it happening all in one go.So you thinkwhat?Over months?Years?Maybe.Or maybe just every day for a week.She could hear the irritation creeping into her own voice and reined it in.There arent many permanent staff members, and theres been very little turnover.If its one of them they could have done it gradually.But they also have a steady stream of researchers from various universities and so on, here and abroad, who come in for anywhere from a few days to a couple of months.Crap.Masoud glared at the infographic again.Is there any chance this has got nothing to do with the EGA?That these lines were never sent to them to begin with?You mean that the gemtechs didnt turn everything over?Thats what Chang is now claiming, although I cant see that it reflects any better on them since they were supposed to have verified each and every vial as it was checked into storage.And in fact the EGA did find discrepancies at the time, do you remember?A couple of the gemtechs held back some of their most valuable stock, substituted dummy vials, but they got caught out by their own datastream records.So I dont buy it.Youd have to ask yourself not only how they got around those checks, but why so many of them did exactly the same thing.Because the missing stock was originally the property of several different gemtechs.And then, said Achebe nervously, there are the hacks.You managed to verify those, did you?Yes, sir.The trace is very clear, it looks like the same individual broke into the datastreams of multiple gemtechs and searched for specific genetypes in each of them.He drew a deep breath.The genetypes that were trawled by the hacker correspond to the genestock that is missing from the EGA.And these hacks happened when?Sharon, who knew the answer and knew that Masoud knew it too, tightened her lips and stayed silent.Before the Declaration, when the genestock was still with the gemtechs, said Achebe.There was a lot of datastream breaking and entering in those days, traces of it are all over the place.Mostly hackbot stuff, very broad spectrum, but some of it was much more refined.Targeted.This hacker follows that pattern.With the added feature, said Masoud evenly, that what our hacker was searching for in the records of multiple private companies four or five years ago has since been stolen from a single secure government facility.Sometime in the last three years.Achebe squirmed.Sharon said, Yes.It seems to me, Inspector Varsi, as though someone is playing a very long game here, and isnt too troubled by minor matters like the confiscation of the genestock they had their eye on.That sounds about right, sir.Or the ban on its use.Well, thats the question, isnt it, sir?We know that they stole from each other, or tried to, back in the days when there was money to be made.But its tough to work out how anyone could make that stuff pay now.The only human gemtech thats allowed anymore is for health reasons, and for parents who cant conceive or have reason to worry how their kids might come out.She kept her voice rigidly neutral.Theres no legitimate market for anything else.Every now and then you hear about a back alley gene surgeon wholl fiddle you better pheromones or make sure you have a baby with blue eyes instead of brown.But this is highly engineered genestock.The EGAs own scientists tell us that kind of shoestring operation couldnt do anything with it.And the cost benefits around creating a sufficiently sophisticated black lab dont seem to add up.So what do you think is going on?I dont know, sir.I would very much like to find out.What do you propose?Weve initiated background checks into everyone who could possibly have had accessthe current staff members, plus all the people whove come and gone.Its going to be a bit messy, almost everyone who has expertise in this area also has some link back to pre Declaration gemtech activity.Well work through them, liaise with local police, see if we come up with any probables.Sergeant Achebe here has begun a detailed systems audit, trying to work out exactly how our thief could have gotten in and out without triggering any alarms or leaving a trail.She glanced at Achebe, who was nodding vigorously.Ive already spoken to colleagues in biocrime about the black lab angle, just to make sure we keep it covered.Theyre going to check their sources and get back to me.Masoud was nodding, grim faced.The director, Chang.You think he could be involved?Im leaning very hard on him, sir, and so far my impression is no.Hes one of the few who never worked in the industry, came out against it from his student days.I suspect thats a big part of why he got the job.He was speechless when we showed him the counterfeit vials, and hes been scrambling for explanations and excuses ever since.He doesnt seem to have been prepared at all, unless hes a hell of an actor.And the whistleblower?Sharon avoided looking at Achebe, wishing she felt less annoyed that this, too, had so far come up a dead end.They were not supposed to go looking for anonymous informants, but in this case finding out who had set them on the hunt would have been a breakthrough worth making.Hasnt come forward.And theres no trail in the datastream...Thats one of the strangest things about this whole business, sir.To her surprise, Achebe had interrupted.Normally wed be able to track back, find the files those screenshots were taken from, or if they were deleted there should be a record in the edit log.But theres nothing.Theres no evidence of the theft in the datastream at all.So where did the?Hang on.Masoud was massaging his temples again.So we were sent pictures of files that dont exist, but should.Yes, sir...Which provided fake evidence of a crime...Yes......that really was committed.Yes, sir, said Sharon and Achebe together.So how?He took in the look on Sharons face.No, let me guess.We dont know.He flicked at the tablet in exasperation and the infographic finally winked out.No, we dont, Sharon said calmly.Im wondering if it could be one of the visiting scientists, if they were somehow able to mirror the EGA idents and send us something that looked genuine enough to make us go in and find what weve found.Im told theres all sorts of things wrong with that theory, but so far its the only one Ive got.This was not entirely true, but she had no intention of saying anymore; not unless it proved unavoidable.She did not look at Achebe, and he stayed quiet.Masoud rested his chin on his steepled fingers and stared across the table at them for a long minute.Sharon met his gaze steadily.She could sense Achebe beginning to fidget beside her.Right.Masoud finally sat back in his chair, shaking his head tiredly.Well, this is a deep and stinking pile of shit, Sharon, and we had all better grab shovels and start digging.It had been some considerable time since she had last lost her temper quite this badly.Khan had retreated, gradually at first but with increasing speed, until he stood with his back pressed against the door, face ashen as he fumbled for the release button.Unable as yet to contain herself, she nevertheless knew the torrent of her own abuse to be excessive and unwarranted, and foresaw with a kind of dull weariness the inevitable hunt for a new assistant if she let him get away.It isnt your fucking fault, Khan!she shouted at him, recognizing the admission to be both incongruous and pitifully inadequate, as the door finally hissed open.She was surprised to see him stop at the midpoint of his escape, looking possibly even more stunned than before.She had a viciously gratuitous vision of the door hissing closed again and neatly bisecting the tablet he was desperately clutching to his chest, his elegant suit, and him.Its not?he ventured, still poised to flee.Did you send this?She ripped her own tablet off its stand and waved it at him.She knew it would take very little for her to throw it at him.She was still going at top volume, and the door was standing open now, with him standing in it.She could feel the pulse pounding in her temples and throat.She needed to calm down.Well, did you?Shouting still, fighting for control, not winning.Are you that witch?Is this your idea, to send that bastard in here to see how much more fucking damage he can do?Well, is it?No.He was still standing there.Remarkable.Something about it pulled the plug on her fury.She threw the tablet onto the desk, hard, and collapsed into her chair.It is not.So what the fuck are you running away for?Khan glanced out into the corridor, then stepped back inside.The door closed and he leaned against it, fingers a hairs breadth away from the button.Really remarkable.His face was still pale, but he was puzzled now, frowning at her, actually waiting to see if there would be an explanation.She looked away, kneading her own hands together, cracking the knuckles, eyes hooded as she stared at the blank tablet on her desk.Deep.Calming.Breaths.Yeah, right.A small sound, Khan clearing his throat.Im not sure whats happened, maam, he said quietly, but Im certain it can be resolved.Im going to go and fetch you a cup of tea...I dont like tea, she muttered truculently.She could feel the rawness in her throat, and coughed.Her hands were starting to tremble and she kept them in her lap, wondering if the shaking was going to spread throughout her body, bleakly aware that she should get him out of the office before he noticed.She felt cold and exhausted.Im going to fetch you a cup of tea, he repeated, with a firmness of tone that made her look up in surprise.Itll help you calm down.And then, maam, if youll tell me whats made you so upset, maybe we can find a way to fix it.The tea was herbal and surprisingly good.Her estimation of Khan continued to rise.He sat quietly across from her, just out of sight over her shoulder.She had swiveled to gaze out of the panoramic window as she sipped.It probably gave the impression that she was too embarrassed to look at him, which at the moment was just as well.The trembling had receded, helped by the meds shed swallowed while he was out of the room, but she could still feel the last of the tics and tremors ghosting across her face.She kept her eyes on the sky, watching its color deepen as the long summer day slipped into evening, while she spoke.So, she concluded, he led us to believe he was taking our concerns seriously and would reflect them in his report to the Federation, and then he did the opposite.Quite spectacularly.I see.That diffident throat clearing again.Umm...do you still think his conclusions were wrong?Its not that.Her mental acuity was returning, and she was aware she had to be careful.Part of the revised brief for BelNatur had been ensuring that new staff members all had impeccably correct views on civil rights.Im not convinced he was right on that specific point, but the consequences havent turned out to be as bad as we feared.Not yet, anyway.And I dont object to the way the world has changed, not anymore.It was difficult at the time, but Im over it.I accept that things had to evolve.She sighed and stretched out her legs, feeling the twinges in knees and hips.Its the way he went about it, the duplicity.I dont think there was any doubt in his mind about what recommendations he was going to make, but he pretended otherwise.So you dont think he can be trusted.No, I dont.Does he need to be?She glanced around at him, looked quizzical.You asked me to familiarize myself with all aspects of the project, he said diplomatically.And I cant see anything about the working practices or the people that he could find objectionable.Mr.Herrans involvement will obviously bring a new dimension to it, but if you leave it up to Dr.Walker and Ms.Morningstar to set the ground rules the question doesnt really arise.She looked back at the window, feeling the corner of her mouth twitch into the hint of a rueful smile.He was right, of course, and shed known it was what shed have to do even as she read Aryel Morningstars brusque message.It was the similarity to a previous, disastrous stratagem that had made her so furious.Explaining that to Khan was out of the question.Something else he had said struck her.Are you familiar with Dr.Walkers work?A bit.Hes required reading at college now.She raised an eyebrow at him, and he winced.Um.Sorry, I didnt mean...She swiveled back to face him across the desk, sighed, and waved a magnanimous hand.Its fine, Khan.My undergraduate days are long past, no use pretending otherwise.I just hadnt realized Eli Walker had become so ubiquitous.Hes considered the authority on...well, pretty much everything.Everything to do with gems anyway.My understanding was that going to live in the Squats had tarnished his reputation.It depends who you talk to.Id say its divided opinion.I know some people think it proves hes gone native and can no longer be considered an objective observer.He was nodding gravely as he spoke, as if to emphasize how well this must correspond with her own view.Hed go far, this one.But mostincluding the professor I hadsaw it as giving him even more credibility.Reporting from the front lines, so to speak.And what do you think, Khan?I think Dr.Walker remains hugely influential.Maybe less so among academics these days, but very much so on the streams.People see him as a moral person, even if they dont always agree with his take on things.He flicked a nervous glance at her.She thought, with a frisson of satisfaction, that he was worried about setting her off again.He plunged ahead anyway.The thing is, maam, it could be a real positive, him participating in the project.Working with BelNatur, bringing a gem and a gemtech back together, brokering a new relationship...There was a pleading, slightly puzzled look to Khans face as he described the golden opportunity that Eli Walker represented.This must be what hed thought when he saw the message from Morningstar, the reason hed skipped in here smiling with delight only to catch the full broadside of her wrath; and she finally understood how very strange it must be for this young man, filled with the indoctrination and idealism of a new age, to discover that it had not been immediately obvious to her.The mellow twilight had long since drifted into night by the time Zavcka made her weary way home; a clear, cool stillness washed by the rising moon.She rested her head against the cushioned panel of the car, watching the brighter splashes of streetlamps flash past, and wondered whether the compromises she had been forced to make really would, in the end, be worth it.On the other side of the city from her plush apartment every light blazed in a smaller one close to the river, cluttered with the debris of travel.Bethany poured the dregs of a bottle into her glass and stabbed out another caustic post to her favored stream.She gulped the wine down as she watched responses ping back, taking lonely comfort in the thought that a great many people were keeping themselves awake so as not to miss whatever she might have to say next.Down on the streets of the Squats, the bustle and hum of evening revelry was finally fading.Occasional bursts of laughter split the air as the last customers spilled out of bars and clubs to make their way home.Music welled up, a sudden flood of melody as a door opened to let a trio tumble out onto the pavement, turning back to shout slightly drunken farewells at those who remained inside.Gwen waved goodbye to them, catching a glimpse of the moon before the door was pulled shut; turning away to nod at Lyriam and the percussionist and come in on the beat as they ran through the phrase again.A few blocks away, on a dark and sleeping street, a light breeze stirred the curtains that hung before a bedroom window on the fourth floor of Maryam House.Rhys awakened so slowly and gently, with a feeling of wellbeing so completely and utterly enveloping, that it took him some time to realize that he was not in fact dreaming.He became aware gradually of the surface on which he lay, soft next to his bare skin, and the silkiness of the sheet that covered him.The sense of bliss was so complete that he held back from full wakefulness, wallowing in perfect peace.A sound intruded, someone breathing regular and slow, and he blinked his eyes open into a dimness that was faintly tinged with red.The hue seemed brighter than his own wine dark glow.Memory washed over him, along with a faint, sour sweet tang of sex, and he turned his head.Callan was asleep, his face relaxed, lips parted a little.The scarlet shimmer of his hair cast a flush over his pale skin.Rhys felt his throat constrict at the sight.He rolled over onto his side, acutely aware of his own body, the resting strength of it, the lack of tension or pain.He thought fleetingly that having woken up, perhaps he should now do something; snuggle closer and stroke him awake for more, or else slip quietly away to his own bed in Aryels apartment.He rejected the latter notion in the instant of having it.Instead he lay quiet, watching, letting the moment cradle him; knowing, without knowing how he knew, that something big and dangerous and precious was beginning, and that he was being swept away by it, and could not have helped it even if he had wanted to.Binary       CONJUNCTIONS       Binary       14 Sharon Varsi wondered if it was an inevitable part of every officers career: for a moment to come when the actions she was obliged to take would appear to contradict the motives behind them.It was not the first time the thought had occurred to her, but as she sat with Mikal and Aryel in his office in the Squats, briefing them on her investigation, the sense of conflict was starting to become acute.Though she had previously said nothing to Aryel herself, had not even seen her since the concert several days previously, she was unsurprised to learn that news of the genestock theft had already been broken to her.In the same way Masoud had known that she would tell Mikal, she discovered that she had known Mik would tell Aryel.She could not find it in herself to be annoyed.This was the way their world worked.It might even make things easier, although at the moment it did not feel easy.Their reactions so far had been predictable: anger, anxiety, and now, she feared, outrage.She was explaining why she was forced to bring the investigation home and trying hard not to feel like a traitor.They were discussing Herran.I havent said anything to Masoud, she told them quietly.And I really hope I never have to.But I cant not ask the question.He put me in charge of this caseput a lot of noses out of joint in the department as well, it turns outbecause of my supposedly greater insight.Into the gem situation, quote unquote.The words tasted bitter in her mouth.She looked sideways at Mikal, who sat hunched, elbows on knees, hands clasped and pendent in the air above his massive feet, his few fingers and many thumbs woven together in a basket like symmetry.It looked as though he had folded himself into too small a space, his bowed back on a level with her head and his eyes staring vacantly at the floor.Her heart lurched.She reached out and tucked her hand under his arm.Sweetheart, Im sorry.What can I do?I cant even ask to be taken off it, Masoud would be furious and whoever took over would just wonder why...Would you rather not have the case?Aryel asked curiously.Its not that.Its a great case career wiseassuming I solve itand I want to solve it.I want to know whats going on, I want to track down whoever did this and find out why.If someones out there doing illegal gemtech with human stock I want to land on them like the proverbial ton of bricks.She gestured a plea for understanding.But I cant be half assed about it, Aryel.Im not saying I believe Herran is involved.I cant imagine why or how he could be.But the fact is, things were done here that as far as Im aware only he can do.I know if I were any other cop the question wouldnt arise.I wouldnt be aware of his existence, much less be in a position to make the connection.But Im not another cop.I cant just pretend not to know what I know.Aryel met her eyes and then looked away, up at the ceiling, leaning into the low backed chair she favored.Her wings brushed the floor behind her and she shook them irritably.Sharon could hear her breathe out, a faint sigh that was almost a snort, over lips compressed into a tight line.It was body language familiar to her friends, a subtle sign of swift and worried thought; rarely visible except to her inner circle.Sharon hoped she still numbered among those few, but it was not her most pressing concern.Mikals arm flexed under her fingers as he stirred.Youre a good cop.Yes...?Youre a good cop and I wouldnt want you to be anything less.He gathered her hand up and interlaced his fingers with hers, gave a brief squeeze and let go.Im sure Aryel doesnt either.He wrinkled his brow across the room at her.She replied, No, of course not, as though it hardly needed to be said, while Sharon felt herself go limp inside with relief.I dont think Herran has anything to do with this, Mikal went on.Do you?No.Im absolutely certain he doesnt.But Sharon cant just take our word for it.She has to eliminate him.Properly.Aryel was nodding agreement, though a tiny frown had taken up residence between her brows.I understand that.Im just worried...how disruptive does it have to be?He cant handle an onslaught of strangers, you know that.Hell shut down.Hes already letting himself be put through a lot for the BelNatur deal.And weve been keeping his involvement there quiet, for obvious reasons, but if hes suddenly in the frame of a police investigation...Itll be kept confidential.I promise.Hes a vulnerable person, hell be very carefully treated, no matter what.Sharon was aware that she was perilously close to gushing reassurances and checked herself.Things needed to be done, as Mik said, properly.He has to be questioned.Protocol says he should come to the station and be interviewed by someone he has no prior history with, but given his autism I can get around that.It needs to be a proper police interview, though.I can tailor it for his condition, but there are things Im going to need to press him on.Ill have to have another officer there to vouch for me doing my job correctly, and there cant be more than two people supporting him.She glanced at her husband again.And one of them cant be you, babe.Fair enough.He finally straightened up on the chair, stretching.His spine cracked, and his fingertips almost touched the ceiling.He cocked his head at Aryel.Callan?And you?Callan definitely.Not me.Aryels posture had relaxed too, arms resting along the sloping back of the chair, slim legs stretched out and ankles crossed.The tips of her wings were fanned along the floor now, but she seemed not to mind.It dawned on Sharon that their earlier anxiety had been no more than fear for Herran, and she felt a stab of guilt for ever imagining otherwise.You shouldve known theyd be upset at the situation, not you, she thought, and was comforted.But she thought too that their freedoms had been won as much by the cohesion Aryel had forged, the rock solid loyalty the gems of the Squats felt for each other, as anything else; and it was perhaps not unreasonable to wonder whether that would ultimately always win out.Aryel was still speaking, eyes back on the ceiling, thoughtful but no longer tense.Eli would be better.Thats the configuration Herrans becoming accustomed to, himself with Callan and Eli in unfamiliar situations.This could help to reinforce that, instead of being purely a stressor.She glanced at Sharon.And it would be better for your report if I wasnt there.No undue influence.Sharon shrugged and stretched.It seemed to be infectious, as they all eased into a familiar camaraderie.Its not like anyone would object, but yes.Callan to help him communicate and Eli as impartial observer are the logical choices.It needs to be today if possible.Ill set it up.Fine.He should be starting at BelNatur in another week or two, assuming we get all the terms and conditions sewn up, and itll be best if theres nothing else he has to contend with by then.She shot her one sided, ironic smile at Mikal.What do you think?Is she going to throw her toys on the floor and storm off, or stick with it?He raised an eyebrow at her.Are you referring to Zavcka Klist?The most amenable woman in London?Surely not.I detect a note of sarcasm, Councillor.Only because I keep waiting for the other shoe to drop.Ive never been pleased and thank youd so much in my life.He shrugged.I havent seen her again, which is fine by me.The BelNatur ethics committee are all puffed up about having executive authority, and they didnt object to anything I put on the table.Not much anyway.I did suggest they endow a chair at Oxbridge especially for Eli, but I knew that was pushing it.Aryel chuckled.Shes not fond of himI can tell she has to hold herself back every time his name is mentioned.I am seeing her, which delights neither of us, but Ive made it clear Im not prepared to negotiate with anyone else.Were in the home stretch now, though.The lawyers will be there today.Whove we got?Jeremy Temple.Dropped everything, doing it for free.Mikal hooted with laughter.Oh, how she must love you.Jeremy Temple had been the architect of the legal equalization of gems with norms throughout Europe; a clever solicitor who freely admitted that his allegiance to his gemtech clients had been turned, along with his head, years before when he met the woman who would later become his wife.They now had a child, who struggled with the legacy of his mothers modifications.Jeremy Temple was, along with Eli Walker, the gemtechs equivalent of the Grim Reaper.I did think that might be the last straw.But she hasnt actually objected to his presence, or Elis.She smiled.Not so weve heard, anyway.Does it really need to be this complicated, Aryel?Sharon asked.Getting into bed with BelNatur for the long haul seems...she trailed off, grimacing.Im not sure about that either, which is where Eli comes in.Aryel sighed.The trouble is that we desperately need gemtech expertise.The reproductive assistance the health services can provide is too limited.You know the guidelines: When they run up against an incompatibility they just strip out the engineering, splice in some baseline genestock and revert to the norm standard.If thats what the parents want, then fine, and goodness knows it makes the Reversionists happy.Most of them.But think about someone likeoh, maybe like Jora.It would be great if her children could inherit autonomic tissue regenerationbut probably not the overgrowth that she suffers from.That has as many consequences for her health as it does for her appearance.A picture of Jora floated into Sharons mind: a simple, sweet natured girl, a face that should have been pretty marred by extra lumps of lip and nose and chin.
