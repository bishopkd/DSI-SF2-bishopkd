Why do you want to shit on the picnic?I wave the smoke away.Nod to Persephone.Weve got a pregnant lady here.Rick looks at her.Looks at me.Really was hoping to finish that cigarette.Stubs it out.Doesnt matter where.The whole apartments an ashtray.Sorry.My bad.Just tell me if its possible.Like what you did with Mark when I was tapped in with Harrow before.Slide someone in, uninvited.Sure, crashing in one person is easy enough.Tapping out everyone else whos also in that construct?All at once?Thats trickier.I dont care if its tricky.I want to know if its possible.Rick rubs his palms on his thighs.Looks lost without his cigarette.Then shrugs.Sure.Anythings possible.Sort of.And what do you need from us?I need someone inside.I can tap people out one by one from out here.Its slow going.You have to find them and then sever the link.And its a lot easier if the people inside know whats happening.Meaning what?Meaning I need someone in there to give them a nudge.You know, pinch me, Im dreaming, that kind of thing.Also, it helps a lot if they actually want to leave.I dont think well have to worry about that.I turn to Mark Ray.Okay.So thats you and me, Mr Angel.Mark extends a consoling pastors hand to squeeze my shoulder, like Ive come to him for advice.I hate to say this, friend, but last time we tried this, you flailed around in there like a fat kid in water wings drowning in the shallow end.Then Mark pivots to Rick, like its time for the grown ups to talk.Ill go in.I can handle that part.But are you sure you can crash me into Paved With Gold?That things got to be a vault.Rick winces, wrinkling Chinese tattoos.Hard to say.When I crashed that country church, I learned a lot about their protocols, and those tend to be consistent across the board.Thats the good news.The bad news is, last time they werent expecting us.Im guessing that wont be the case this time around.Also, that country church construct?That was a quickie one off, whipped up for your meeting.Designed for guests, so it was easy to crash.This heaven place is guaranteed to be a much more complicated construct.More secure.Walls are much higher, so to speak.Mina, still waltzing with the mop.You gotta piggyback.Ricks waves her off.Like a bad smell.She repeats.An octave higher.You gotta piggyback.Im interested.So I ask Rick.Whats that?Rick rubs his temples like he just got hit by the nastiest migraine ever, and that headache is now dancing with a mop in his kitchen.Then he spreads out his thin fingers, covered in silver skull rings.One skull per finger, thumbs too.Sterling graveyard.Then he lays it out.In laymens terms.Despite what my beautiful life partner says, piggybacking is just a fucking stunt.Look, Im a cocky asshole gizmo daredevil and even I dont do it anymore.Sure.But what is it?You slide someone in on someone elses dream, someone whos been invited into the construct.Basically slip them in before the door closes.But its a very dumb thing to do.Whys that?You ever see kids on skateboards hitch rides on the back of buses?Its kind of like that, except with your consciousness.You fuck it up, you will skin your knee.Badly.How badly?Come by my place, Ill show you the room where I keep those people.They dont mix too well with the general populace anymore.Tugs at a skull ring.Twists it.Continues.Besides, definitely no ones going to invite either of you two into their heavenly clubhouse, so its a nonstarter, since theres no one to piggyback in on Persephone speaks up.I can do that.What?Theyll invite me in.If I ask to meet my father I interject.Absolutely not.Mark looks at me.Its not a terrible idea.Lets set the bar for ideas a little higher than not terrible.Mark persists.Look, she cant get hurt in there.Not really There are a lot of things they can do to her.Even in there.but Ill go in with her, to protect her.Ill be the one to piggyback in.RickI mean, you can do that, right?Rick thinks.Twists a silver skull.Then nods.Mark turns back to me.Youve seen me in there.You know I can handle myself.Better than you can, in there.And shes the only one of us who can possibly convince Harrow to tap in for a meeting.And if the goal is to tap everyone out, people in there will trust her a lot more readily than theyll trust me.Harrows daughter?Theyll follow her out.Familiar face and all Sure.Familiar face of a disgraced runaway Spademan, think about it.She lures Harrow in for a meeting.I follow her in and we take care of everyone in there.You find Harrow in his bed and take care of him out here.Its the only way this works No, Mark.I said absolutely Persephone cuts me off.Fiercely.Look, I am very grateful for all that youve done for me, but Im not your fucking daughter.Ill do what I want.And Im doing this.I need to.There is a long silence.During which we all listen to the stillness of Chinatown.Broken finally by Minas best Axl Rose falsetto.Mop becomes a mike stand.Knock knock knocking on heavens door.I figure its time to call the meeting to a close.So.New plan.We break into heaven, set everyone free, lure in Harrow himself by dangling his runaway daughter, secretly slip Mark in behind her somehow, using some technique that Rick, the cockiest gizmo in Chinatown, isnt even sure is possible, they give Harrow a good talking to, make him see the error of his wicked ways, perhaps offer up an apology to the daughter he fucked and maybe probably knocked up, all while Im out here tracking down his flesh and bone body in the nuts and bolts, somehow sidestepping Simon and the rest of his security so I can get close enough to dispatch the holy man to actual heaven, where hell be free to compare his ginned up version to the real thing.Seems simple enough.I have no doubt hell end up there either.His heavenly reward, I mean.I long ago stopped believing that were sorted into groups for our eternal retribution, or that theres any door, or pearly gate, that you cant pry open, given enough gold.I may have once had some thin faith in something like cosmic justice, but now I believe in box cutters.Everything else I left buried in a tunnel along with the number 2 train.25.Well also need a nurse so I contact Margo.Margo was my mothers roommate in nursing school, best friend for life after that.When I was a kid she used to sit at our kitchen table, blowing smoke out her nostrils like an angry bull.Nicest woman in the world though.A laugh that could swallow a room.I havent seen her since my mother passed.My mother didnt last much longer after that incident with the tardy ambulance.I catch a bus out to the Jersey suburbs, an hour ride to Hackensack.As the city peels away, it feels much saner.Suburban.Almost like life as it was.From the bus you can see into peoples lit up living rooms.The houses out here arent full of tappers in their silver torpedoes, just people on flowered sofas, planted in front of TVs.Yes, they still make TV shows somewhere.The rest of the country is still pretty shiny, from what I hear.Apparently the West Coast is more or less the same.Sunshine.Palm trees.Beautiful women in drop top convertibles.Singing surfers.Moral rot.The whole enchilada, in the shape of California.I wouldnt know.Ive never been.At one time I thought of relocating, right after Times Square.Figured theyve got to have garbage out there too.Very same thought made me stay in the end.A country buried in trash from coast to coast.As for the rest of it, the in between part, I hear its relatively clean and still open for business, like a plucky dollar store.No longer the land of milk and honey, maybe, but at least you can still get high grade pharmaceuticals on every street corner on the cheap.Most places, they call it the Toothless Tap In.A dream you huff out of a paper bag.Really, its just New York that got nuked, cordoned off, shut down, shunned.Capital of the world, cut loose to drift into the sea.The countrys soul, on a funeral pyre.Margos in a low rise.Lots of buildings out here are basically just dorms for support staff, the servant class, who ride in daily to the city to fidget with breathing tubes, feed tubes, shit tubes, piss tubes.Tubes that run in and out like highways for all the rush hour traffic of the human body.Then all the Margos of the world ride the bus back home to catch the days events on the TV.Or escape the days events.Thing about Margo, shes the unhealthiest nurse ever.Chain smokes, obese, has to stop to catch her breath while shes catching her breath.Then again, as she likes to say, what does health have to do with being a nurse anymore?She opens a beer for her, then one for me, puts them on the coffee table between us like were playing chess with only two pieces.I notice theres already several empties standing at attention in the sink.Dont imagine shes had a dinner party lately either.She follows my eyes to the empties.So my recycling box is full.What brings you out to Hackensack?Just wanted to check in on you.Thats a funny sentiment to suddenly swell up after eight years.Im sorry.I got busy.You know the city.Really?What are you busy with?Just the city.It keeps me busy enough.Well, its good to see you.Margo, you ever think of moving closer?Plenty of room in Hoboken.Or Park Avenue, for that matter.She looks at me like I just asked her if shes ever thought of giving up plumbing and moving right into the sewer.So I skip to the next question.How are you keeping?Im sorry I havent been out sooner to see you.Well, if you had come out, I could have told you, I was very sorry to hear ab out your wife.Thank you.We clink longnecks.She was a beautiful girl.Such a shame.What they did.I appreciate it.Shame what happened to this country.With Margo, youre never far from a tirade.Shes not quite the happy snorting bull I remember from my kitchen table days.Shes bigger than ever, but seems deflated.I always figured that one day shed work her way through every last person in the world to be angry at, and that would leave only her, and then that would be it.I listen to her for a bit, let her wind down.Then I explain I need to hire a nurse for a job, and she cuts me off.Does it involve changing a rich mans diapers while he dreams?No.She swigs.Okay then.Im in.Margo offers me the couch but I tell her Ive got business to get back to in the city.I say goodnight, catch the late night bus, bound for Port Authority.Then, a few stops later, hop off.Plot a detour.Hoping to clear my head.So the Crusade is coming in less than a week.Its set to kick off on Sunday night.The mayor has sworn theyll have the camps swept clean by then.Proudly points to news footage of skinny stragglers stumbling out of Central Park, begging for scraps, getting pelted by onlookers, then cuffed and carted away.No ones sure what theyre charged with or where they end up.Some rumors say upstate.Some rumors say Fresh Kills.Some rumors say its best not to listen to rumors, unless you want to find out firsthand.Second bus unloads me in Hoboken.Certain times, times like these, I have a few rituals.Reminders, really.Of things I need to be reminded of.From time to time.Not meant for anyone else.Just for me.Unlock my apartment.Leave the lights out.Head to the kitchen.Open the icebox.Stand and stare into the freezer.Where I keep my parceled souvenir.Actually, reminders not the right word.Relics better.Freezers cold curls out, licks my face.26.He was a lawyer.He wasnt the first one.He was the third.The first one was an accident.Maybe.Thats what I told myself at the time, anyway.The first one: An old trash duty buddy heard I was in a bad place, bouncing from bed to bar to bed.This was in the first few months after Times Square.City still reeling.My apartment still empty.My Stellas clothes still hanging undisturbed in the closet.Waiting in vain to be worn again.So this old trash duty buddy tracked me down to this bar I liked on the boardwalk of Coney Island, where the front side opened out to the ocean and the seagulls loitered and chattered like barflies.Id make the long trip out because I liked to smell the sea.Smelled sour.Like garbage.I found that comforting.He tracked me down and instead of offering condolences, he offered me cash.A dispute had turned ugly and he wanted me to talk to the guy.Just talk.I guess he asked me because Id recently developed a local reputation as someone who was long past issues of personal concern.Hed had some argument over money or property or something.To be honest, I dont remember the details.I dont even think I knew them back then.But I was alone and out of work and bed hopping and burning through what little cash I had left.Rick had cut me a deal and set me up on a discount trip, where I didnt tap into any dream, I just tapped into nothing.Just a void.Until my hour was up.So my old trash buddy sidled up on a barstool and asked me to do him a solid.Which I did.Caught the guy outside his apartment one night.Startled him while he searched for his keys.Big guy.Cocky.Conversation moved to an alleyway.He threw the first punch.Im sure of that.Or pretty sure.In any case, it got ugly.And I still carried my box cutter.The one Id used to slice open that garbage bag.My reluctant surgeons tool.I wasnt nearly so careful on him.Hands were steadier, though.So.Problem disappeared.So did the guy.When you work in garbage, you have access to incineration.And instead of calling the cops, my friend paid me a bonus.Then lost my phone number for good.But not before passing it on.That was number one.The lawyer was number three.His jilted wife had hired me.She came to me in a dream.I was tapped in at Ricks to the darkness, to nothing, and then there she was, like an angel, before me.Beautiful woman, oddly outlined in light.Face aged by abuse.Not the kind that comes from belt straps and backhands.Thats too downmarket.Too hands on.This was just the abuse of pills, neglect, and pain, all etched in her face over time.Shed bribed Rick to let her slip into my dream.Then she led me out.This angel.We went for bubble tea.Her choice.Chinatown still bustling back then.She said she thought her husband was cheating.But not out here.In there.Thats why she bribed Rick.Shed never been off body and she wanted to see what the limnosphere offered him that their life together couldnt match.To her surprise, in my dream, it offered nothing.But I assured her that my setup was not typical.Most people prefer some frills and thrills to spice up their oblivion.Not many people order the abyss, straight up.Shed lost him, she said.Hed gone in for a business trip but now he was limning ten, fifteen hours a day.Hed left his job, cashed out his securities.She knew hed met someone in there, some hussy, and now he wouldnt come out.Hussy.Her word.Theyd fought.Hed frozen her assets.Forced her to move out.He was tapped in while the moving company carted away her things.The last remnants of their life together.Boxed and bagged like crime scene evidence.She said good bye to him while he lay silently dreaming.Their marriage long dead, now her at his side, mourning it, like an open casket funeral.Hed already changed all the passcodes to the bank accounts.But not to the apartment.You might recognize him, she said, as we finished our tea, almost as an afterthought.Why?He was all over the news for awhile.Really?For what?He survived Times Square.Big story.Local news ran wild with it.Front page of the Post, three days running.I didnt look at the papers after Times Square.So you dont remember the Lucky Passenger?When I was a kid, my father was never religious.He saved his Sundays for football and quiet communion at the altar of the couch.No wine, no wafers, just beer and Pringles.He worked hard all week, he said, and if the Lord set Sunday aside as a day of rest, well, who was he to argue with the Lord?So on Sundays, he rested.And prayed.For the Jets.My mothers family was more observant.Roman Catholics, many generations back.Her own grandmother was a black cowled, hunched over husk of a woman, whispering over her rosary, haunted by the unseen, sputtering curses and prayers.When my mother broke with her family and went to school to be a nurse, not a nun, it broke her grandmothers heart.When I was a kid, my mother never made church a weekly habit.But she did keep her grandmothers rosary hanging from the vanity.My father she could drag to Mass maybe twice a year.Easter and Christmas.Home in time for kickoff.But me she was worried about.Maybe she was right to be.Either way, for awhile, every week, shed drop me off for Sunday school.Car pulled to the curb.Hair up in curlers.Lean across the front seat to kiss me on the cheek and promise to pick me up at this exact same spot when Sunday school let out.I could tell her all about what Id learned.Figured Id memorize a few verses.Say a few Hail Marys.Take First Communion.What could it hurt?None of it stuck, though.And once I got old enough to outgrow my First Communion suit, I found other ways to occupy my Sundays, and my parents didnt complain too loudly.So I dont remember much of church.A few stories.The odd parable.The oily smell of incense, swung from the end of a chain.But there was one thing that left an impression.Ornate box they kept at the front.By the altar.Reliquary.It was the easiest thing in the world, like delivering takeout.The apartment was empty, as advertised, save for him sleeping.Sensors purring.Monitors cooing.Fresh feed bag on an IV.Not too old, maybe late thirties, well built guy and as handsome as his wife was pretty.Impeccably suited, down to the silk pocket square that he paid someone to fluff for him each day.Palatial apartment, tastefully furnished, top floor, panoramic river views.Realtors fantasy.Only a wish for most anyone else.Yet here he was.Lost in the dream.Framed photos of the happy couple still propped up everywhere as mementoes.And on the walls, front pages.Framed.Mounted like trophies.Post.Daily News.Times.USA Today.The lawyer, smiling broadly, holding up his right hand.Fingers wide.Headlines trumpeting.FORTUNE SPARES THE LUCKY PASSENGER.The lawyers name, I learned from the articles, was Charles Pierce.Come to think of it, I did remember him.Not from headlines, though.From billboards.The Lucky Passenger and his famous lucky fingers.The reliquary was treated with a special reverence.Carefully maintained.Never opened, no matter what.Even if you inquired politely for a peek.So one day I asked my Sunday school teacher what the big deal was.He looked at me.Got serious.That box contains the dust of the bones of saints.What?Like a coffin?Not exactly.Its a holy place to keep that which has been touched by God.So we may all be inspired.And benefit from its power.So like souvenirs, I said.Not souvenirs, he said.Relics.Charles Pierce had scrambled down the stairs at Wall Street station to catch the uptown 2 train express.Got snared in the entranceway.Turnstile jammed.Swiped his subway card once.Twice.Again.PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN.Subway waiting.Doors gaping.PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN.PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN.PLEASE SWIPE AGAIN AT THIS TURNSTILE.Stupid card keepscant get thedoesnt anything work right in this fucking Two tone signal as the subway doors slide shut.Charles Pierce swiping.Cursing.Top of his lungs.GODDAMN THIS FUCKING CITY Turnstile never budged.Charles Pierce stands chewing out the bored looking booth attendant, finger jabbing the Plexiglas as the uptown express slips from the station.Red taillights recede into the darkness.Hes still steaming, silently fuming, on the platform when the ground lurches and the tunnel emits a dull bored faraway roar.THE LUCKY PASSENGER.All the headlines proclaimed it.ONE SWIPE FROM DEATH.Who knows why God chose to spare me, of all people?Said again and again with a newly sainted shrug.Repeated in story after story.Quote after quote.On the couch of the Today show.I honestly cant say why God chose me, Lorelei.The host nods sympathetically.Recrosses long legs.He holds up his right hand.This handI was holding the swipe card in this hand Chokes up.A well rehearsed act.Voice hitching on the same wordspecialevery time.I dont know why God spared me, Lorelei.But I have to believe its because He has something special in store for me.Lorelei nods.Her hand on his knee.Cut to commercial.He wasnt the only one that day with a story like that, of course.Lots of people died.Lots didnt.Hes just the one who was smart enough to tell his story to anyone whod listen.Tell it, then sell it.First to sell newspapers.Then lotto tickets.Then toothpaste.Then anything he could point at with his famous lucky fucking fingers.Charles Pierce on a billboard, arms outstretched.LETS SEE WHAT BARGAIN MY LUCKY FINGERS HAVE PICKED OUT FOR YOU TODAY!After that, her husband was never quite the same, his wife told me over bubble tea.It became clear, with all that attention, her meager devotion was no longer going to be enough.Hed been spared for some higher purpose, he truly believed that.And apparently that higher purpose was selling six inch submarine sandwiches, among other things.Half a hoagie grasped in those famous fingers.Smile to the camera.Lucky me!So why should he go back to the normal life?he told her.The one hed left behind?But the fame began to drag on him.The constant nagging for handshakes and autographs.And then hed started tapping in.And thats when shed lost him, she said.There are three types of relics.I know.I Googled it.First order of relic.The physical body of a saint.Second order of relic.An object the saint once had in his or her possession.Third order of relic.An object thats come in contact with the first order of relic.Three orders.Like three outcomes.And thats it.The first order, of course, is the holiest.Physical remnants.Which come in many varieties.All with Latin names.Ex capillus.Ex ossibus.Ex cineribus.Ex pelle.Ex carne.From the hair.From the bones.From the ashes.From the skin.From the flesh.He lay asleep in an apartment littered with pictures from a life he no longer wanted.Of a wife he had no use for.A roomful of souvenirs.Seemed senseless, this flesh and blood body just lying there, like a discarded husk.Body slowly shriveling under a ten thousand dollar suit.He still had everything Id lost.Everything Id die to get back.Yet he still checked out.Hard not to see it that way, anyway, as I stood there, holding my box cutter, watching him drift in a dream.Surrounded by all those photos.One swipe from death.And me thinking.I dont know why God chose you either.But here we are.Should have left him there.Left it at that.Dead lawyer in a bed.Hard to imagine a surplus of questions.Or mourners.But I didnt.Instead I carted his body out in a movers box on a dolly.Wore an old pair of coveralls and a painters cap tugged low.Took his body to the usual place.To burn it.No doubt security cams at his building caught me coming and going.The whole operation sloppy enough that I figured eventually someone would come looking for us both.To be honest, I didnt much worry.Maybe welcomed it.Felt the whole world was already spinning the wrong way on its axis.So let them come for me.But no one did.I guess law enforcement had its hands full, what with the city still exploding.And it turned out there was no one else left in his life to raise a finger in complaint.Not even a lucky one.The most holy relic, by the way, is the Eucharist.The communion wafer thats the literal flesh of Christ, transmuted the moment you receive it on your tongue.Like I told you, I took First Communion.If you believe in that sort of thing.Edible flesh.The holiest ritual.But dont worry.I didnt eat the lawyer.But I did take some souvenirs.Just four.Left the thumb.Box cutter wouldnt cut it.So I used a linoleum knife instead.Curved blade.Have to be careful.Those things are extra sharp.Packed a Ziploc with ice.Wrapped them up in butchers paper.Stashed the whole thing in a duffel bag.Incinerated the rest of him.Souvenirs are always a bad idea.But these arent souvenirs.Theyre relics.Ex carne.From the flesh.Duffel bag dripping on the subway ride home.When I met his wife again, she paid the back half and thanked me then sat and cried in that same bubble tea caf.At first I thought she was regretting what shed done.Then she told me.She hadnt been entirely straight with me.Shed known what he was doing in there.Shed hired someone to tail him into his dream.Its hard to do, but not impossible, if youre technically proficient and ethically flexible.Its one of many services offered by Rick, for example.So the tail trailed him into his personal construct.The dream hed built for himself.Abandoned his life for.Abandoned her for.Came back with a full report.Shed expected a lavish hotel with some hooker or high school sweetheart.Or perhaps some more unspeakable depravity.Some secret shameful desire he could never share.But that wasnt it at all.It was just their life, exactly re created.To the last detail.Same apartment.Same suits.Same view of the city.Same celebrity endorsements.All of it identical.Except without her.Shed been erased.So she returned the favor.I stand in Hoboken.Stare into the icebox.My reliquary.Take a moment.Feel the cold.When I dont feel it anymore, I close the door.Thats the lesson.The gospel truth taught to me by my personal patron saint.No matter what you have, or how lucky you think you are, theres nothing in this world you can hold on to so tightly that it cant be taken from you.His wife sobbed.Why would he I stopped her.Took the money.Stood up.Explained to her.I dont care.And realized only then that it was true.And that was the last time I listened to a backstory.Or let anyone pay in installments.Or met with a client face to face.Or laid down in a bed.Until my meeting with Harrow in the wheat field.As I left the caf that day I stuffed her money into a deep pocket.Apparently Id taken to calling them clients now.27.Rick makes a good living running Ricks Place in Chinatown, catering to a reliable stream of tappers, but to make extra cash he takes the occasional off hours private tap in job, which he scrounges up on the seedy old Internet.Servicing nervous dreamers who want to crash some porny construct theyre too embarrassed to ask for by name in the light of day.So Ricks like the kid who opens the back exit to the movie theater, lets you sneak in and sit in the front row for free.Minus his fee, of course.He taps you in, takes his fat envelope, and quietly lets himself out.Mina is convinced Ricks cheating on her, which he is, so she tries to follow him to these jobs and spy on him, which she cant.Take tonight.Ricks on his third house call when he decides to shake her, which isnt too hard, given that if you stood across the room from her and asked her to walk toward you in a straight line, about half the time shed get lost on the way.Compared to that, the back alleys of the Lower East Side are a labyrinth.Rick doubles back a few times, then pops loose, free of his tail, a block from his destination address.Hes way south of Rivington, in the crummiest part of a crummy neighborhood.Tired tenements slump by the sidewalk, black iron fire escapes stitched down their bellies like ugly sutures.He heads into a walk up with an apartment number on a scrap.Finds the door open so he lets himself in.He has enough time to register that the apartment is dark and entirely bare, save for a wooden rocking chair.But not enough time to turn around before Simon the Magician steps out of the darkness and slashes a sjambok across the back of his knees, which feels to Rick roughly like getting horsewhipped with a live high voltage wire.Another nifty trick.Most magicians disappear.Simon appears.Rick half turns and manages to get his hands up this time but that only makes it worse.The sjambok is like a bullwhip thats all handle, no whip, and on the second pass it slices a whistling gash across both of Ricks upheld palms, the skin splitting raggedly, as though gasping in surprise.Simon then calmly bull rushes him, sjambok held lengthwise up against his neck and arms, Rick stuttering backward until he slams into drywall.The cheap wall shudders.Simon gets to the gun in Ricks belt before Rick does.Steps backward.Bounces the pistol lightly in his palm.Its a snub nose, for self protection.Ironic.Looks like a padlock with a tumor on it.He waves Rick over to the rocking chair.Once Ricks hands are bound behind him with plastic cuffs, Simon commences the speech making.See, for me?I dont trust guns.Too messy.All forensics and fingerprints.Its much too easy to connect a body to a bullet, and a bullet to a gun, and a gun to a man.He turns the gun over, studying it, like its an heirloom.Not that anyone bothers about that sort of thing anymore, am I right?These days you pop someone in cold blood in broad daylight, FedEx the murder weapon to the cops, it will end up in a folder on a pile somewhere, shrugged off as someone elses problem.But still.He pockets the pistol.Old habits.You understand.He hefts the sjambok.Now this Sends its tip whistling across Ricks face.Tip bites.Halves a tattoo.this is more my kind of firepower.They were made to kill snakes.Most are flexible, like a whip.Made of rhino hide, just leather wrapped on leather.This ones custom though Bends it.Bounces back to attention.Sounds a metallic twang.got a little something extra inside.Whip whistles back the way it came.Matching slice.Rick sputters.WaitI candont you knowjust talk to Milgram One last slash to shut Rick up.Sorry.Were long past the lets make a deal phase.Shakes the sjambok slightly, held upright.Watches it wobble.Then puts it down.Retrieves a duffel bag.Pulls out a roll of duct tape.Tears off a piece.Mouth sized.As I said, I dont trust guns.Lays the tape over Ricks mouth.Tape edges grip his cheeks where the cuts are.Tugs them wider.Im more of a non lethal man myself.Pulls out a penknife.Opens it.Cuts a slit in the tape.Second mouth.Then he pulls a can of pepper spray from the gym bag.Jumbo size.For crowd control.See, this?This you can buy on the Internet.Get it sent to a PO box.No names, ID, nothing.Legal.Untraceable.And non lethal.He shakes the can.For the most part.Rests the toe of his boot on the chairs rocker.Tilts it forward.Tips Ricks chin up with the nozzle.Of course, this is the kind of thing thats used to disperse riots.Entirely safe and more or less harmless when used on large gatherings in the open air.
