"Lets dig a tunnel into their den," Joe offered."Its going to take a lot of work to dig a tunnel into their den," Jeff said."But it will be easier than digging a well all the way down," Joe said."Well dig a tunnel," Gavin said, "While Cliff goes in search of surface water at the same time.Cliff, you can take one other person with you, but we cant spare many men or the tunnel will take forever.Hopefully well come up with some water by the time our tanks are dry."Everyone nodded slowly."Okay," Gavin said, "Lets get to work!"***That evening, Jeff took his men to scout out the den of the Diamondbacks.He took two of the Blue tip chimeras and spears they had made out of straight metal pipes.They had fastened a thermal knife to the end of each pipe.They took water and lizard skins.The skins kept them warm as the sharp cold settled over the darkened landscape.They also took Purple Man lanterns, and grappling hooks.The men were determined to find a good spot to start the tunnel, but were ready for a fight.They knew the Diamondbacks would not be happy if the men got close to their den.Jeff rode on the first chimera and was kept busy trying to control the beast.Frank sat behind him with a lantern and a spear.Next came Joe riding his chimera with Sam seated behind him.The stars began to peek through the darkening curtain of sky as the chimeras rhythmically swayed under the men.A small crescent moon moved through the sky.The moonlight lit the wide, flat valley dimly as they traveled through it.Suddenly, Jeffs chimera jumped in its tracks.The men hung on and they quickly scanned around them to see why.Frank held up the lantern and they saw the dim reflection of three pairs of eyes ahead of them.Then the eyes darted towards them.The chimera under Jeff leapt backwards so violently that it tossed the lantern out of Franks hand.It clattered to the ground.Frank clumsily gripped his spear and gripped the chimera with his feet to keep his seat.Jeff brought it under control.Now they could see three Diamondback chimeras approaching them from three sides."Diamondbacks!"Jeff shouted, "Stay together and use your spears!"Joe brought his chimera up closer to Jeffs and saw a Diamondback rushing towards Jeffs left side.He kicked his chimera forward and Sam got up in a crouch with his spear, looking over Joes head.Just as the Diamondback lunged through the air to attack Jeffs animal, Sam thrust the spear forward and caught it with the spear just under the neck.The shimmering blade thrust deep into the Diamondback.Joes Blue tip chimera shrieked and grabbed the injured Diamondback in its jaws.Sam pulled out his spear and the Blue tip flung the limp body to the side."I didnt expect our lizard to fight," Joe yelled as his Blue tip shrieked again.The other two Diamondbacks leapt at Jeffs chimera from the other direction.Frank swung the spear over his head, slashing one Diamondback over the back and then jabbed at the other.Frank must have hit the second one as well because it hissed loudly and leapt away.The two remaining Diamondbacks quickly pulled back as Joe came up beside Jeff to face them.The Diamondbacks turned and scrambled a quick retreat through the wide plain."After them!"Jeff shouted, and they kicked their chimeras.The large beasts lunged forward, rising up higher on their front legs.Their rear legs pounded the dusty ground under them as they sped forward.The men hung on with all their might as the chimeras dodged around scrubby bushes and bounced up and down over hills and ravines.The huge chimeras seemed to bounce off mounds and plow through shrubs.Soon they lunged down into a large dry riverbed with a sickening drop.Now the Blue tips saw and smelled the Diamondbacks in front of them and surged forward over the sand and packed dirt.Jeffs chimera came up beside one of the Diamondbacks, which darted wildly as they approached it.Frank crouched up behind Jeff, readying his spear.When they got close again, the wounded Diamondback didnt dart away for several moments.During those seconds, Frank hurled the spear with all of his might.The spear hit right in front of the powerful hind leg of the Diamondback, sending it sprawling.Jeffs steed wheeled around so quickly that it threw off Jeff and Frank, who tumbled through the sand, coughing and panting.They climbed to their feet and drew their knives.Their Blue tip was staring straight at the wounded Diamondback.In a lightning quick lunge, it grabbed the Diamondback by the side of the neck.The Diamondback tried to bite back at the big Blue tips neck, but couldn't.After a few moments, it died.Then the second Diamondback came galloping up from behind, with Joes chimera quick on its heels.When the Diamondback saw Jeff and Frank standing in the middle of the riverbed, it turned and darted towards them with its mouth open.Joes animal gained on it with a few powerful strides and Sam pinned the beast to the ground through its back.Joes chimera finished it off.The four men stood in the twilight for a while, panting and smiling."I didnt expect the Blue tip lizards to fight so hard," Joe said."They seemed pretty peaceful before. ""Without their help, we couldnt have done it," Sam said, patting his steed on its flank."I think they are beginning to trust us more," Jeff said as he walked up to his chimera and grabbed its reins.***By the next morning, Jeff returned with his chimeras loaded with meat and skins.They also had good news."During the coldest part of the night," Frank explained to the others, "Our chimeras got pretty sluggish and weak.We left them under an overhanging rock and went on without them.We scouted around the Diamondback tunnel entrance.During the cold part of the night and during the hottest part of the day, the Diamondbacks stay underground, just inside the entrance.We were able to walk around the den at a distance without any interference.We found a good place to start digging our tunnel in a thicket of bushes.""Looks like you saw some action, too," Chuck said, pointing at their bundles of meat and lizard skin."Yeah, we did," Joe responded, "but we came out on top, thanks to our lizards."***By noon, Jeff was back on the ridge near the Diamondbacks den with his men and more supplies.They watched the entrance of the chimera hole for a while before he gave the signal to move ahead.The blinding heat of the sun beat down on them and the men sweated profusely as they struggled down the rocks with their chimeras in tow.Their large Blue tip chimeras were having difficulty in the hot sun.All of the other chimeras were resting in their cool tunnels underground.The Diamondbacks were in their holes too, giving the men a perfect opportunity to move closer.The designated spot for their tunnel entrance was in a large grove of desert bushes and scrub that was about a hundred feet from the Diamondbacks den."This is going to be the worst part," Jeff called to his men as they unloaded tools from their chimeras."Were going to have to dig a hole in the heat of the day, and it will have to be deep enough to stay hidden when the Diamondbacks come out in the evening."The men wiped the sweat off of their foreheads and started digging with their shovels.The first layer of dirt was loose dust and sand, and was easy to shovel aside.Just under that layer was a layer of very hard dirt that was packed and sun baked.They hacked at that layer until they were exhausted, collapsing in the meager shade of the bushes to drink warm water out of their lizard skin bags.As soon as they gained their strength again, they went back to work.It was miserable.Fortunately, the sun hardened clay didnt go down forever, and they soon broke through to soft, gravelly dirt that was much easier to dig through.It was cool and moist and they soon got down several more feet.The hole was square with five foot sides.After they got four feet down, another group of men arrived from the Shark to help them out.They brought more supplies and water.Jeffs men relaxed beside the hole as the other men started digging.The hole was deep enough that they started hauling up the dirt in buckets and dumping the moist dirt in piles around the desert grove.By late afternoon, the Diamondbacks began to come up onto the hot desert surface to sun themselves."The Diamondbacks are going to be active soon," Jeff said, "Wed better cover up the hole and get everyone out of here."***The shaft was now eight feet deep and the men had to go up and down a makeshift ladder.They stashed a bunch of their tools in the bottom, put a large metal sheet over the hole, and covered the sheet with dirt and sticks.The Diamondbacks were starting to move by the time they left in a caravan of four Blue tip chimeras.The Diamondbacks followed them slowly.One of the Diamondbacks got close to the last chimera that Javier was riding.Javier tapped Denz on the shoulder and showed Denz his grappling hook before he fired it at the Diamondback.The hook streaked through the hot desert air, its cable sizzling as it unwound.It hit the Diamondback in the leg and stuck fast.The Diamondback jumped and twisted and tried to pull away, but Javier anchored the cable to his own chimeras harness.Their Blue tip pulled and strained and held the Diamondback from running away.Jeff and Frank turned their chimera around and approached the Diamondback cautiously.When they got close enough, the desperate Diamondback lunged at them fiercely.Jeffs Blue tip jumped aside and dodged the attack, and Frank put his spear through the Diamondbacks heart.The other Diamondbacks kept their distance now, but the men knew they were only timid because they were still sluggish from sleeping through the heat of the day.Jeff called out for them to keep moving.They didnt have time to clean the dead Diamondback, so Frank fired another grappling hook into the dead Diamondback and they helped Javier and Denz drag the Diamondback back toward the Shark.They knew Wes would be happy to use it for meat and skins.***The work proceeded slowly that first day.The long trips to and from the Shark wasted a lot of the time they could have used in digging.However, after the second day they had a large enough hole that some men could stay in the shaft during the times when the Diamondbacks were most active, which was at dawn and dusk.They constructed a ventilation shaft and brought an air pump so they could have air to breathe while they were sealed inside the underground hole.They brought lights and sleeping bags, and some ladders.The men in the hole slept when the Diamondbacks were out, and then worked during the heat of the day and the cold of the night.They dug twenty feet down, placing platforms at intervals.For each bucket load of dirt they dug up, there was a bucket load they had to haul up to the surface.Dirt was constantly spilling and being kicked down on the men in the bottom of the shaft.They always finished their shift with sand in their hair and teeth.Fortunately, the hole was cool and comfortable compared to the surface, where the men either sweated or froze as they hauled up the heavy buckets of dirt.After they reached twenty feet down they began to dig horizontally.They decided to make the horizontal tunnel just two feet high and two feet wide to reduce the amount of dirt they had to haul out.The men spent a few minutes digging at the tunnel face, and then they spent most of their time scooping the loose dirt into a cart and pulling it to the vertical shaft, where the dirt was scooped into a bucket and hauled to the surface.Soon the tunnel was ten feet long and so dark they couldnt see at the end.The men had to bring headlamps so that they could see in the darkness.They also had to put in a ventilation pipe along one corner of the tunnel to bring in fresh air.The excitement grew as the tunnel got farther and farther along.After fifty feet they dug a chamber big enough so that the men could turn around.While some men dug, other men hunted and gathered food.***Krid Zaff stepped slowly across the hull of the abandoned Tonn ship in his magnetic boots.He stooped down to look at the top hatch of the craft."Lang," Krid called on his intercom, "The Reds have been here.Look, there are glove prints in the dust on the edge of the hatch.""Good," Lang said excitedly, "We have found the trail at last!""Yes, we have, but I am beginning to get nervous.The Reds are leading us into the middle of nowhere.We dont have any of this area mapped.We are almost on the other side of the rift by now.""Shall we head back then?"Lang asked."No," Krid said, standing up straight."We must find them."***Cliff reached over and shook Jose awake.Jose stretched and looked around.They were in a shallow hole dug into the dirt of a steep embankment.Their two chimeras were sitting motionless in the hole behind them, with the fading light of day in front of them."Time to get moving," Cliff said quietly."Right," Jose said, gathering up his things and rolling his bedroll.Cliff crawled out into the evening air and looked around."Were almost to those mountains," Cliff said, "I bet we can make it there tonight.If theres water anywhere, I bet it will be in the mountains."***Jose climbed out of the shallow den and brushed off his clothes.He looked around him.The sun was setting behind barren hills.Its orange glow lit up jagged black mountains in the east.In the west, rays of light pierced through the openings in low canyons and orange and pink clouds hovered motionless over the distant horizon.Jose helped Cliff lead the chimeras out of the temporary hole the beasts had dug instinctively that morning to hide from the blazing sun.After leading the animals out, the two men loaded the gear on them.They didnt carry much, just coats and blankets and lots of skins filled with water.They had spears and other weapons they also lashed onto the backs of the chimeras.Once the gear was loaded, they let the animals smell the special bags of scent.That helped calm the chimeras before the men hopped onto the back of the first.Cliff kicked the beast forward and they began their jolting journey.The chimeras seemed to move in fits and starts.They would quickly scramble to a low mound and then stop to look around and smell the air.Cliff helped guide them with the reins and Jose scanned the surrounding terrain.They moved quickly on the chimeras and after several hours in the long twilight, they arrived at a ridge of rocky mountain peaks.The peaks were splinters of sharp rock jutting up out of the ground.Steep, ravine scarred slopes led up to the faces of the craggy peaks.Cliff led the chimeras up a large canyon.As they climbed up the canyon, it narrowed and grew steeper.A rocky gorge cut through the bottom.They continued up the side slope of the canyon until they got to the summit.They rested on the rough grass growing on the saddle and looked out into the valley beyond.The mountain range curved away from them into the darkening twilight.Its slopes swept out into a large flat basin that extended almost out of sight.On the horizon the black mountains were now much closer."Id bet that theres water there," Cliff said to Jose."Wait a minute," Jose said suddenly, pulling out his binoculars, "That looks like a building down there!"Jose looked through the binoculars and gasped at what he saw."Look, down there," he said excitedly, handing the binoculars to Cliff."It does look like some buildings," Cliff said."Thats strange, I thought no one else lived here," Jose wondered to himself."Lets get closer for a better look," Cliff suggested.They jumped on their chimera and kicked it forward, pulling the second on a lead rope.They started down the other side of the jagged mountains and headed into the darkening shadows.After a minute, the terrain blocked the view of the cluster of small, round buildings they had sighted.They continued in the same direction for about an hour.The stars were beginning to come out, and Cliff gazed up at them."I think its strange," Cliff said to Jose as they continued, "To be in a place with such different stars.Were a long way from home.""It seems awful lonely," Jose agreed, "Our own Sun is so far we cant even see it.It has a kind of thrill, though, in spite of the loneliness.""Its almost unbelievable to think that we are the first people from Earth to see this valley.Always before, wherever I went, I knew that someone else had been there before.Well, no one has been here before."They came up onto a low rise and saw the buildings, now several hundred yards away."Maybe someone has been here before, Cliff," Jose said, "Someone had to have built those huts."Several low, round buildings were nestled in a small hollow.The remains of aging wooden roofs sagged between their low walls.Cliff and Jose dismounted and walked breathlessly up to the buildings.The air hung still and cold around the ancient rock walls."I wonder if anyone lives here," Cliff said.The two men circled one of the buildings and found an entrance.Withered wooden posts framed a wide, black doorway.Sand covered steps led down into the circular chamber.The floor of the chamber was several feet below the ground level.Cliff flipped on his light, and they gingerly walked down the stairs into the black room.Their light crept out and dimly illuminated the chamber.A pile of gnarled wood was to one side of the room with a charred stone hearth next to it.No other sign of life could be seen.In the center of the chamber was another set of wide, dark stairs leading into the ground."Shall we check it out?"Cliff asked.Jose paused, feeling his heart beating."Lets do it," he replied finally.They walked side by side down the stairs, followed by a shimmering circle of light.The stairs kept going deeper and deeper into the gloom.Cliff noticed on the walls as they passed through different layers of gravel and dirt.After several minutes, they turned to look back.A dim gray square of evening light behind them marked the entrance to the dark stairway.Finally they came to a flat corridor made of rock.They walked along it for several yards and then Jose noticed something on the floor.He stooped to look at it."Cliff," Jose said, "Check this out!The rock floor has been carved to look like something. "Jose wiped the sand from the floor.A picture emerged from the sand."It looks like a woman," Jose said, "A human woman.""Yes," Cliff said excitedly, "Shes holding a container in her hands. ""I see it," Jose replied."But what is she holding the container up to?""I cant tell," Cliff said, stooping to hold his light close."Is it a dog?"Jose worked to remove loose rocks and dirt from the edge of the picture, which was almost up to the wall."You know what?"Jose said suddenly after he blew off the last of the dust and sand, "It looks like a huge ant.See, the carving continues up the wall, too. "The two men followed the design up the wall."I wonder if it is on the ceiling, too," Jose asked.Cliff turned his light up toward the ceiling.It was about nine feet up and all gnarled and convoluted in the dim light.Cliff felt his eyes widen and he gasped.His stomach leaped up into his chest.The ceiling was moving!Silent shadows writhed and jerked around.The shadows coalesced into distinct shapes.A writhing, crawling mass of huge ants was just a few feet above their upturned faces.The heads of the ants were almost as big as a mans, and their bent, hairy legs were several feet long.Scimitar like mandibles silently opened and shut and antennae flicked all around.The two men ducked and crouched down close to the floor to get away from the ceiling.Cliff panted a few times into the dust on the floor and slowly turned his head to look over his shoulder.His light was lying on the floor and only illuminated the wall.The hidden mass of ants was in the darkness and a few seemed to move randomly down onto the lit portion of the wall a few feet from Jose.Suddenly the whole circle of light on the wall was filled with the glistening, silent forms of giant ants, antennae flailing around ahead of them.Cliff snatched up his light and ran, stooping low to the floor.He had never felt such an urgent need to get out into the open air.It was like claustrophobia.His body flew over the rough stones of the floor as his mind imagined the ants dropping down on him and crawling over him.His heart pounded as he reached the stairs.He stole a glimpse back and saw Jose running just behind him, wide eyed and desperate.Then, in an instant, they were at the stairs and shot up them like two rockets.Cliff saw two ants on the stairs ahead of him.Cliff sprinted forward and ran around the ants with a new burst of speed, his feet barely touching the corners of the stairs as he rushed with all his might.He tripped several times on the steps, but was on his feet in an instant.Then he suddenly burst into the round chamber and shot through the dim doorway into the cold, crisp air outside.He kept going, leaping over bushes and rocks with heady speed, until he finally stopped on a large, flat rock.Jose was beside him in an instant, crouching over and panting heavily.They turned to make sure they werent being followed.Nothing could be seen behind them except low black bushes in the deepening night."Do you think they...will follow us?"Jose asked between gasps."I dont know," Cliff said, staring hard to try and penetrate the darkness between them and the circular buildings, which were silhouetted by stars."Im getting out of here," Jose said."Where are the lizards?""I dont know," Cliff answered, "But I agree.Lets get out of here.We can come back when its light and get the chimeras."They wandered through the darkness, jumping at shadows and rustling branches.Finally they got back to the saddle.The adrenaline had worn off and left only fatigue in its place.They fell to the ground in the middle of the wide, grassy saddle to sleep.The dim moonlight faintly lit the grass and the two men slept fitfully.Cliff must have snapped awake a hundred times during the night, being jolted awake by a sound just as he had drifted off to sleep.Finally, a gray light grew from behind the black mountain range.Dawn was coming.The light spread and lit up the landscape around the two men, lying shivering in their thin lizard skin jackets.A new courage and comfort flooded over them with the light and they breathed easy and free.Hunger and thirst led them quickly toward the low buildings and their chimeras.The sun lit the floor of the valley before they reached it.Their two chimeras were basking on the rocks in the sunlight.As they got closer, they noticed something strange.Black, bent sticks were lying all around their animals.Closer inspection showed the sticks to be ant legs."The lizards must have eaten some of the ants," Jose said, picking up an ant leg."These lizards keep surprising me," Cliff said."Boy, well sure have a good story to tell the rest at the Shark," Jose said."Ive never run so fast in my life.""Me neither," Cliff answered."When we were going up the stairs, I saw those ants on the way up.I could have shot straight up a thirty foot wall.I feel a little better now.""I still wouldnt care to hang around here for long, though," Jose said, "Lets gather up everything and get out of here."They walked around to pick up gear that had fallen off the chimeras during the night, lashed it all on, and got on their way.By the time the blazing sun forced them to halt, it looked like they would make it to the black mountains after their next march in the evening.***Joe was almost covered in damp earth.It was covering one of his legs and an arm.He hacked at the dirt face in front of him with his free hand, spilling more dirt down on himself.Finally, the muscles in his free arm could take it no longer and he slumped down on the mound of dirt in front of him.He rested for a while, feeling the cool dirt on the side of his face and watching the bobbing light from his headlamp on the wall as he panted.After a few minutes, he heard Sams voice.Sams light crept down the tunnel toward him until it merged with his own.Sams face had a dirty smile and was streaked with sweat.Joe heaved himself up on his knees and shoved back piles of dirt toward Sam, who pushed a cart up to Joes feet and then scooped dirt into it."I can't believe you're doing so well on just one leg," Joe said."When I'm crawling, it's almost easier not to have anything below my knee."Soon Sam was gone again, backing down the tunnel away from Joe."I hate backing up," Sam mumbled to himself angrily, but he still had to do it.There was no way to turn around in the cramped tunnel.Joe turned back to the face of the tunnel and picked up his digger.He jabbed at the upper left corner of the face and felt the digger slide effortlessly into the dirt all the way to the handle.The dirt was usually much harder to penetrate than that.He must have broken through.The dirt crumbled away as Joe pulled out the digger and felt the new hole with his hands.His headlamp wouldnt shine all the way through the hole, but he felt a puff of air coming through it."Sam," Joe called in a hushed yell, "Sam, we finally found a tunnel!"Sams muffled complaints stopped."The lizard tunnel?"Sam called excitedly."Yeah!"Joe replied.Joe backed up a few feet and then began packing dirt against the face of the tunnel and covered up the hole with several feet of fresh dirt.He wanted to seal it up for now.Then he stabbed his digger into the ground and backed down the tunnel.After many yards he got to a small chamber where he could turn around and go headfirst.He crawled past a spot that had caved in on him earlier.Now it was braced with boards taken from supply crates in the Shark.He crawled through another small chamber and finally began to see some natural light.When he got near the shaft, brilliant sunlight slanted down in front of him.When his head poked into the shaft itself, the light temporarily blinded him.The other men were already gathered in the bottom of the shaft, cheering about the good deeds.Everyone slapped Joe on his dirt covered back.***"Lizards coming!"shouted the lookout on the Shark.Several men jumped out of the top hatch and stood on top of the Shark to look.It was almost dark and the dim shapes of two chimeras could be seen approaching the Pinak."Theyve got riders," a man shouted, "It must be Cliff coming back!"Cliff shouted at them, as he got closer.Soon the lookout could see that all of Cliffs water bags were empty."He must not have found water," the lookout grumbled."That means the tunnel operation is our only chance."That night, the crew of the Shark gathered in the bright lights of the equipment bay.There, they planned out the big operation to steal water from the chimera tunnels.Cliff hadnt found water, so the den of the Diamondbacks was the only place they knew of that had water.Everything else was prepared for their departure except for that.They had gathered and preserved enough food for the journey and the Shark was in top condition.***The next day the men spent getting all in preparation for the operation.They checked their weapons and their faithful Blue tip chimeras.They also collected enough hoses to run along the length of the tunnel and some extra to get down to the water level from there.Joe and Sam were chosen to dig out the last few feet of the tunnel and get the hose laid down to the water level.They were taken to the tunnel on chimeras and sealed inside during the heat of the day when the Diamondbacks were all underground.A water pump was lowered into the base of the shaft after them.The job of Joe and Sam and the others was now to wait until the next dawn, which would be 36 hours later.***Joe and Sam waited tensely in the hole.Joe was lying at the far end of the tunnel, ready to begin digging at any moment.The hose was coiled up behind him like a rattlesnake as thick as a mans arm.Sam was in the bottom of the shaft, manning the water pump and waiting for the signal to begin digging.Joe pulled out some dried chimera meat to chew on.Outside on the surface, the sun was up and the air was already warm.The Diamondbacks were outside on the surface, foraging for food.The air was as still as death, with not even a breeze to rustle the dry plants.Heat waves were starting to boil off of the desert floor and create mirages on the flat plains.Then, a low rumbling came from far away.Some of the Diamondbacks stirred and sniffed the air.The rumbling grew to a roar and a high pitched whine.Something emerged from behind ridges in the distance.It was the Shark.It came skimming slowly over the desert floor until it neared the grove that hid the tunnel.It hovered above the grove and maneuvered slowly before coming down just beside the grove.Down in the tunnel, Sam heard the rumbling and shouted at Joe."Lets go!"he called.Sam grabbed the end of a hose and slung it over his shoulder, carrying it up the ladders to the top.Then he opened a hatch into the fresh air above and shoved the end of the hose out onto the ground.Once he was sure that the hose wouldnt fall back down, he leapt down the ladders and scrambled down the tunnel after Joe.Meanwhile, Joe took a deep breath, touched the hilt of his thermal knife for reassurance, and began digging.***The Shark settled to the ground with a rumble.At the instant that the ship stopped, Diamondback chimeras rushed toward it to attack.They didn't like anything getting that close to their den.The equipment bay doors opened and five Blue tip chimeras rushed out into the sun from both sides of the ship.Two men rode on the back of each of the chimeras.Wes brandished his spear and yelled at the top of his lungs.The five Blue tips were wheeled around into a line facing the Diamondback den, and then they all surged forward with a shout.As they galloped forward, they met the charging Diamondbacks.The battle had begun.One of the Diamondbacks leapt up and sank its teeth into the neck of Gavins chimera.Riding just behind Gavin, Jose swatted it off with his spear and then Frank, who was riding Jeff's chimera nearby, finished it off.The Diamondbacks were outnumbered and retreated back to their den.One Diamondback came from the side.Javier wheeled his chimera around and his spearman, Denz, met the foe by thrusting at it with his spear.The Diamondback leapt back, landing in a crouch out of range of the spear.Denz pulled out his grappling hook gun and fired a hook into the Diamondbacks leg.Then he dragged the enemy closer until his Blue tip could finish it off.Then, all of a sudden they were within a few yards of the hole, with no enemy in sight."What do we do now?"Javier asked."We didnt think we could kill them all.""We didnt," Jeff replied."Theres more."Jeff was right.Chimera after chimera began pouring out of the Diamondbacks tunnel, rushing at the attackers in a wild throng."Fall back and draw them away!"Jeff shouted as they met the charge.Then all became a blur of crashing bodies, grunts, shrieks, and leaping animals.Now the Blue tips were vastly outnumbered and the men riding them had trouble controlling their terrified animals.Frank slammed his spear into a Diamondback that leaped up at him from the side, knocking it away.Then he smacked a Diamondback on the other side with the butt of his spear.They kept coming."Use your spear too!"Frank yelled to Jeff as the attackers sank their teeth into the Blue tip chimera.Jeff dropped the reins and unsheathed his own weapon, driving off one Diamondback and leaving the other dead.Then their Blue tips began leaping and twisting in the air, ripping and tearing the enemy chimeras while Frank and Jeff hung on for their lives.Gavin and Jose found themselves in a quiet area between some shrubs.Gavin panted for a few seconds, unsheathed his own spear and then kicked his lizard out into the open, holding the reins and his spear.Diamondbacks leapt at them from both sides.Jose killed one in mid air, but was hit in a glancing blow by a leaping foe from the other side.With a yell, he tumbled off the Blue tip and landed sprawling in the dust.The Diamondback came to rest on the back of Gavins Blue tip chimera and sank its teeth into its scaly back.Gavin spun around and thrust his spear deep into its side.The Diamondback fell onto the ground, snapping at the air and twisting about until it died.Gavin leaned down and grabbed Joses arm, dragging him back onto the Blue tip.As Jose scrambled up the smooth scales of the chimeras flank, Gavin saw a Diamondback coming from behind.Before Gavin had time to wheel his chimera around to face it, the Diamondback latched onto the Blue tips tail.The Blue tip sprang forward, almost spilling Gavin and Jose on the ground.Its blue tipped tail ripped off in the jaws of the Diamondback, leaving only a stub.The Blue tip chimera didnt seem to be hurt, though.Gavin and Jose jumped into their seats again and Gavin kicked the Blue tip in a galloping arc that brought them back in sight of the entrance to the Diamondback den."Its working!"Gavin shouted, "Were drawing away all of the lizards after us!"The Diamondbacks were pursuing the Blue tips all over the valley, leaving none behind in their tunnels.***Joe burst through the last of the dirt wall separating their tunnel from the chimera den.Then he rushed forward, with Sam close behind him.The light from his headlamp waved around the tunnels wildly as he searched for a passage down to the water level.Sam lugged huge coils of hose through the tunnel.Joe scrambled as fast as he could through the maze of tunnels, finally slipping to a halt in mud at the bottom of a wide passageway.He pulled out a small shovel and began scooping out a hole in the watery dirt.Each time he shoveled dirt out of the hole, water quickly filled its place.He worked quickly and soon had a hole several feet deep, filled with water.He crawled back to find Sam and help him drag the hose toward the hole.***Outside, the battle began to turn against the men and their chimeras.The Diamondbacks were worked into a frenzy by the blood.It was all the men could do just to hang on as the Blue tips turned and fled along a dry riverbed.The Diamondbacks came close behind.Finally, the men persuaded the Blue tips to turn and fight.By now, the slower Diamondbacks had begun to tire after the long chase.They didnt seem to be as voracious now that their den was left so far behind.After a short skirmish, the Diamondbacks retreated until they were out of range and waited in the sun.The men loosened their grips on their chimera harnesses to breathe and drink a little water.The men were all tired and their chimeras were slashed and bleeding.The respite was a welcome relief for all.After a few minutes waiting and watching, some of the Diamondbacks began to drift back and head to their den.Jeff pulled out his radio."Chuck," he called into it, "Do you read me?""I read you.Im here on the top of the Shark.""Do you have the water yet?""No, I dont have any water yet."Jeff looked over at Gavin with a worried expression."They dont have the pipe laid yet," he said."And the Diamondbacks are headed back to their den," Gavin said, "Wed better go back to keep the Diamondbacks from going down into their hole and catching Joe and Sam in the act of stealing their water."The men looked around at their haggard and weary condition.They were tired, but it didnt matter.They had to charge back into the fight.They kicked their Blue tips forward and crashed into a group of Diamondbacks in the middle of the riverbed.First, one Diamondback went down, then another.Some Diamondbacks came back to renew the fight, but others didnt turn around.They kept going back to the den."Weve got to stop those lizards from going back!"Jeff yelled as his chimera charged and wheeled about to fight off its nearest enemies."Javier, follow me!"Jeff kicked his chimera into a charge out of the frenzied mass of chimeras and up out of the riverbed onto a low sandy bank, with Javier's chimera following after him.Then Cliff saw two Diamondbacks following right behind Javier.Cliff kicked his chimera up the slope to stop them from getting Javier.On the chimeras back behind Cliff, Wes fired a grappling hook with each hand, snaring each of the Diamondbacks and pulling them back.Javier waved thanks with his hand and then galloped away over the desert floor.He and Jeff surged forward until they saw the group of Diamondbacks that were heading back to their den."Lets get em!"Javier shouted.***Joe came within ten feet of the water hole before the hose snapped tight and then wouldnt budge."Is it caught anywhere?"he asked Sam."No!"Sam yelled back."We dont have enough hose then!"Joe called.Sam shook his head in disbelief."This cant be happening," he said.Joe came back towards Sam with two small shovels."Heres your shovel back," Joe said, sliding the shovel up the passageway to Sam."Were going to have to cut some of the corners of the tunnels down," Joe continued, "We might be able to get the hose to reach if we cut out some of the zigzags."Sam, who barely had enough room to crouch on his knees, gripped his shovel in both hands and swung it at a corner with all his strength.Joe scrambled past him and got to work on another bend in the passageway that turned almost at a right angle.***Javier and Jeff charged into the Diamondbacks, sending them scattering in all directions.Javier brought one down and Jeff wounded several others before the Diamondbacks collected themselves and came at them from all sides.Jeff and Javier dropped their reins and jabbed and swung their spears alongside their riders, Frank and Denz.Frank thrust his spear deep into one Diamondback, killing it instantly.Then he couldnt pull the spear out.Just in front of him, Jeff swung his spear at another enemy, who caught the weapon in its jaws.As the two men struggled to free their weapons, two more Diamondbacks attacked.Frank dropped his spear and fired a grappling hook, catching one Diamondback in the eye and killing it in midair.Jeff could do nothing as the last Diamondback snapped its jaws on the side of their chimeras neck.The weary Blue tip struggled to shake it off but finally dropped to the ground and died.Frank jumped off their dead steed and stepped on the dead Diamondback to pull his spear out.Then he killed the Diamondback that was still gripping the dead Blue tips throat.Finally Jeff shook the other enemy off of his spear and the last Diamondback fled.Javier rode his wearied steed up to the side of Jeffs dead Blue tip."Hop on," Javier said."Lets head back to the Shark."Jeff and Frank scrambled on the back of the chimera and held on with all they had as the lizard like creature loped away toward the Diamondback den and the Shark.They soon met up with the rest of the men.They came back with just two of their three chimera steeds."They took one of our lizards down," Wes explained, "And the Diamondbacks all turned to eating it.The dratted lizards didnt want to play with us anymore, so we left.""At least it didnt look like they would be going back to their hole to cause any more problems," Gavin added.As the three remaining Blue tips came in sight of the Shark, they saw three more Diamondbacks going toward the entrance to their den."Chuck," Jeff called again on the intercom, "Do you have the water yet?""Still no water," came the reply.Jeff tapped Javier on the shoulder."Lets do it again," Jeff said.Javier looked back with a wearied look, but saw the determination in Jeff's eyes.In spite of his thirst and weariness, Javier knew that they had to save Joe and Sam from getting caught by the chimeras down in the tunnels below.He nodded and kicked his animal forward again.Behind Javier and Jeff on the animals back, Frank and Denz yelled at the top of their lungs as they came forward to the battle one more time.Their shout drew one of the Diamondbacks in their direction.As their steed hurtled forward with its last strength, the Diamondback met its approach head on.The Blue tip rose up on its forelegs to meet the attack, but the smaller Diamondback slipped in between its forelegs and then lunged up at the Blue tip from below.It sank its teeth into the Blue tips neck and the dying Blue tip staggered and fell over on its side.The four men on its back spilled off into the dirt and bushes of the desert.The victorious Diamondback then leapt at the men, who jumped back and raised their weapons.Jeff looked over at the entrance to the tunnels.Joe and Sam were still down there.The other two Diamondbacks were slowly walking to the entrance."Okay, men," Jeff said as they eyed the nearest Diamondback warily."Lets take this blasted lizard together and draw off those other two before they go down the hole."The other three men nodded to signal their readiness.The large Diamondback stared at them angrily, its bloodied jaws half open.It seemed larger now that they were all on the ground with it instead of fighting it from on top of a Blue tip."Go!"Jeff shouted.All four men dashed forward.Denz fired a grappling hook that snared one of the creatures legs.The others charged with their spears.The Diamondback backed up, pulling the hook and cable with it and dragging Denz to the ground.The other two Diamondbacks now had reached the entrance to the den and started down.They needed to kill this Diamondback quickly so they could stop the other two.Jeff ran after it, and flung his spear at it.As his spear flashed through the air, Jeff tripped and landed face first on the ground.The spear struck the Diamondback just above its shoulder and the thermal blade cut deep into the beast.The Diamondback shuddered, stood motionless for a few moments, and then fell over dead.Denz staggered to his feet, and let go of the cable of the grappling hook.The other three men charged toward the den after the last two Diamondbacks.Jeff looked up from the ground and watched the two lizards disappear into the black tunnel, then collapsed in the dirt.They were too late.Now it was up to Joe and Sam to defend themselves from the chimeras.***Joe was finally able to let the hose fall into the water with a satisfying splash."It made it!Lets get outta here!"he yelled.He and Sam dashed back up the passageway, following the hose.Sam went in front with Joe close behind.As they came to an intersection, Joe glanced down the side passage and glimpsed a pair of glistening eyes."Theres a lizard!"he gasped.The two men crawled as fast as they could as they fled.The chimera was close behind them.Joe glanced back just as it lunged for him, grabbing his foot in its jaws.Joe screamed and pulled his foot free.He didnt waste a moment before taking off down the tunnel again.Just as they reached the hole that led into their own tunnel, Joe turned around to see the chimera right behind him.Sam wriggled into their tunnel and turned to see if Joe would make it through.Joe scrambled back with his glowing thermal knife in his hand.He dodged to the side as the Diamondback struck at him.The chimera lunged at him again.Joe tried to duck and scramble backwards, but he fell back on the floor.As he lay on his back in the tunnel, his headlamp illuminated a patch of pebbly dirt filled with stones in the roof above him.Joe recognized this dirt because this same type of dirt had caved in before when they were digging their tunnel.One large stone hung half exposed in the middle of the patch.When the chimera jumped at him again, he kicked both legs straight up into the air and shoved with all his might on the exposed stone.It came loose and fell.With a crack, the rest of the pebbly soil came crashing down.It covered the chimera and Joe at the same time.Joes light was covered up, leaving the tunnel in darkness.Only Joes arm was visible, sticking out from under the dirt pile."Joe!"Sam called desperately."Dont be dead!"He flung aside dirt and rocks with his hands and uncovered Joes face.Joe gasped in air, then coughed and spit."Get me out," he whispered hoarsely.Sam scooped the dirt aside until he could pull Joe out."Lets get out of this hole.Whaddya say?"Sam asked as Joe struggled to his knees."I never want to see this place again," Joe spat.The two men looked back at the cave in.The whole passageway was blocked off with dirt.Only the water hose penetrated the mass of dirt and rock."Lets hope the hose didnt get blocked," Sam mumbled, "Lets go."***When Joe and Sam came to the base of the shaft and turned on the water pump, they immediately heard shouts of joy from above.Dirt and dust fell on their heads as the men above slid open the cover to the shaft.Three heads poked into the bright square of sky above their heads.The men above looked down into the dim shaft and saw four white eyes looking up at them."Theyre alive!"someone shouted.Joe and Sam climbed up the ladders and dove into the open bay door of the waiting Shark.Several men with spears helped them on board."You got the water?"Gavin asked."Lets hope so," Joe answered."Keep covering the door in case more Diamondbacks come," Gavin ordered.Then he and the two dirt covered men went over to the engine room and waited by the end of the hose.Pumping sounds reverberated through the hose for several minutes as they waited for water to come out."Nothing yet," Gavin said nervously.A few more anxious seconds followed.Finally, water gurgled and spattered out of the end of the hose.With a shout of delight, Gavin screwed the hose into the tank."We got water!"Sam shouted."We did it!"Cheers reverberated through the whole ship."We did it," Gavin said to himself with a smile.After the shouts died down, Wes patted one of the three surviving Blue tip chimeras on the flank.After the battle, they had brought all of their Blue tips back to the Shark for protection."We owe a lot to these guys," Wes said."What are we going to do with them now?""I wish there was more we could do for them," Gavin said."There is," Cliff called out."I know just the place for them.Ill guide you to it."***Several hours later, the Shark thundered over a jagged line of rocky peaks and came to a rest on the ground."Ill be back in a few minutes," Cliff called as he led the three chimeras through the open bay door with Wes close behind."Where are we taking them?"Wes asked Cliff."Were taking them where theyll have enough food to last them for a long time," Cliff answered.Cliff brought the chimeras up to the entrance to a circular stone building.Wes loosed the lead ropes and patted the first chimera on the flank."You saved our lives, fellas," Wes said as he walked to the second chimera, "We owe you a lot. "When Wes came to the last he stopped."Especially you, Silver," Wes said, his voice trembling a little."I never could have had a more faithful friend.We sure did a lot together.I still remember the first day I rode you.Boy, that was a long time ago.Ill never forget you."Just then, a spindly, black creature crept out of the doorway of the circular building.The first chimera gobbled it up."What was that?"Wes asked."That is what giant lizards like to eat most," Cliff said, "Giant ants."Wes laughed in amazement."Well, whaddya know!"he said, and then they turned to leave."Adios, Silver!"Wes called.Cliff stooped before he climbed on board the Shark.He picked up a handful of dirt with his hand, and then turned to look behind him.The bright sun was shining on the jagged peaks, leaving sharp shadows in the rocks.It was an amazing sight.He let the dirt sift through his fingers with regret.He didnt want to leave.He jumped onto the Shark and watched out the bay door as the ship rose off the ground and thundered into the sky."Ill miss this place," Cliff said to himself, "It feels like home. "7"We need to know what were going to do with this freighter," Gavin said to the crew gathered in the bunkroom."Were short on men already," Jeff said, "and it will be an added problem if we are trying to man both ships.""There's some good equipment and food on the freighter.We cant just throw it all away," Jose commented."We can take part of it with us in the Shark," Jeff said."What would we do with the freighter then?"Javier asked."We could just leave it here," Frank suggested."Then the Purple Men could get it back," Cliff added.Denz suddenly spoke up."We'll have to scuttle it," Gavin translated for him, "We didnt capture an enemy ship just to let them have it back!""Good," Jeff said, "Then let's do it and get moving.We can't wreak havoc on the Purple Men by sitting around here all day."***Jeff checked over the new cargo in the equipment bay of the Shark before heading up to the cockpit.Gavin was already there, piloting the ship away from the freighter."The freighter should blow in a few seconds," Gavin told Jeff.A moment later the Shark shuddered and a Jeff saw flying gas and debris through the window."Thats another one down," Gavin called over the intercom so that everyone could hear, "Lets make the Jaka wish they never found Earth!"At this, everyone cheered."Bring 'em on!"Wes shouted.***In a few days, Cliff called from the telescope dome."It looks like there's an Ion Course station is in sight," he called excitedly."This must be an Ion Course branch line going to the mining district," Denz said."Wait, I see something else, too," Cliff said."Get Denz up here. "Denz rushed up to the telescope tower and Cliff let him look through the eyepiece."What is it?"Cliff asked in broken Purple Man."You're learning my language well," Denz said, and then turned to look in the eyepiece again, "It is a string of transport barges coming along the Ion Course from the mining district," Denz answered."This could be our lucky day.""A string of transport barges is coming in on the Ion Course," Cliff called on the intercom."It must be following the beam in to this station.""Gavin, the barges on the Ion Course will be easy targets," Denz told him, "They have a wicked cyber attack team, but that won't stop you if your computers are off.Also, they cant maneuver to avoid us.They have to stay on the beam.The only problem is that they are fast.We can only get up to their speed in short bursts before overheating our engines.""What are on board?"Cliff asked, speaking the Purple Man words badly."Probably some passengers, supplies, maybe even money!"Denz answered excitedly."Shall we capture it?"Jeff asked."If we do, we had better get moving, or well fall behind," Denz warned.Gavin flipped the switch to turn off the computers as the men rushed to their positions to man the engines.The Shark swung around and lurched forward with a blast from its engines.Javier watched from the lookout post on top of the Shark."There's a long string of barges coming," he called over the intercom.
