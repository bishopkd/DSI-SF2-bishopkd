They made their way around the perimeter and then headed up one of the wide ramps that connected the inner city to the fields outside.The ramp was much bigger than Jack had originally thought.Logically, he knew how large it was after weeks of careful observation, but that didnt prepare him for the staggering hugeness of it, looking less like machinery and more like a sloping hillside.Charlie gave him a nudge.You ready for this?Ready as Ill ever be.I can take the lead if you want.No.Lets do this.With that, they marched up the ramp single file, and after an uphill hike that felt like an eternity, they were inside.It was instant culture shock.Keep your heads down, Jack said, but even he was having a hard time of it.They moved along, and while everything remained foreign and unbelievable in its own way, Jack thought he was starting to understand what he was looking at.The area was an industrial district, complete with big bulbous buildings that could be warehouses.Another kind of walker lined the streets here, longer and lower to the ground than the ones they knew, with dozens of short, stubby legs supporting multiple pod compartments.Unless Jack missed his guess, they were tractor trailers.flyers filled the air overhead in patterns that mimicked the streets of any large city, but expanded into the third dimension.The fine details of each flyer were slightly different, but they were all basically miniature, open topped versions of the cuttlefish, zooming around and through the throng of stalagmite like buildings, and the sprawling network of catwalks which connected them.The false monks journeyed on, and the industrial district gave way to a business district full of brightly lit store fronts and street vendors loudly hawking their wares.Every alley led to another market overflowing with foot traffic and wafting out strangely delicious smells.They were the smells of fried vegetables and roasted meats.A residential area came next, complete with terraced stalagmites that were apartment complexes.Parks with oddly complex terrain sat between the apartments, where adolescent jackrabbits played a game like football, but with a weighted rod in place of the ball.One rabbit would fling the staff to another, who would then grip it with the claw on his back and dash across the obstacle laden field.Each district was dense in a way that would make even Manhattan in its prime feel jealous, and the traffic grew thicker the deeper they went.All the while, the infiltrators kept their heads down and did their best to avoid attention.Jack threaded a route that avoided crowds, and even managed to avoid the many street markets.Every now and again, they passed another coven of hooded monks, and they silently waited to be discovered, but the real monks never motioned to them or paid them any mind.Too many of Jacks prayers were being answered, and it was starting to make him nervous.There were many more types of aliens than theyd seen outside.Jackrabbits were plentiful, but the city dwellers were less muscular and sinewy than soldiers, and none wore the black gas masks.The creatures were playful and lively, and could often be seen talking excitedly and singing in the streets, in brightly colored clothes and jewelry that jingled.More surprising were the rhinos, who were nearly as common as the jackrabbits.They were so different than the soldiers that Jack didnt recognize them at first.Civilian rhinos were much closer to humans in size and proportion, with four average sized arms, faintly striped beige skin, and no armor to speak of.Not a single one had an insect attached to its back either, and their clothes always left their blowholes uncovered.Even after Jack had decided that these striped creatures were the rhinos, he still had trouble connecting the two.The idea that they grow to five times their original weight, and sprout bulletproof armor was simply too fantastic to believe.There were other species, but none in numbers approaching the rhinos or jackrabbits.There were great tall aliens that stalked through the crowds as a giraffe walks through tall grass, and other hunched over, skulking creatures that kept to the shadows, but could occasionally be seen darting from one shelter to the next.The strangest thing the Bravos saw was a floating animal with a gelatinous sack for a body, which appeared to be filled with other, smaller creatures swimming around inside of it.He was like a living aquarium, and it was anyones guess if either he or his inhabitants were intelligent.They never saw a pilot anywhere, but with the number of vehicles flitting about, their numbers were obviously healthy.It also occurred to Jack after a couple kilometers that hed seen several groups of monks, but had yet to see any of that species outside of their robes.He filed that away as another mystery he would likely never answer.Then they came to the generator complex.It was impossible to miss, a massive column of twisting fibers which extended from the floor to the canopy above.It was thicker at either end and thinner in the middle, like a sticky bridge of fluid slowly pulled apart.Glowing amber cables sprouted everywhere on its surface, and extended out toward the rest of the city like creeping ivy.The Bravos huddled in the neighborhood just before the generator, where foot traffic grew thin.It wasnt obvious how to get into the facility, or if there even was an entrance.From the looks of things, they might as well have been looking for a door on a tree trunk.In a hushed voice, Nikitin said, I dont see a damn doorway, Jack.If theres no way in, the missions a bust, chief.Our charges wouldnt even dent that thing.Trash wasnt a problem solver.He got jobs done when directed, but any deviation from the plan stopped him dead in his tracks.Where he picked up demolition skills before joining the Corps was a total mystery, as was his terrible nickname.Jack tilted his head back and looked up the great height of the thing.He didnt even want to guess at how tall it was, because it dwarfed every skyscraper hed ever seen.Still, the glowing cables made for interesting terrain, and there appeared to be plenty of hand holds and ledges.Did he just think what he thought he thought?As Jack second guessed his fleeting idea, one of the flyers high above slowed and entered a tunnel in the facilitys side.The angle from the floor made the entrance itself invisible.Whos got some climbing experience?You didnt just ask that, Nikitin said.Albright, Trash, and one of the demo men raised their hands.Good.Looks like theres a docking port for flyers up there.Thats where were getting in.There isnt another option.The rest of you stay behind.Stick to the shadows, and be ready to get the hell out.Clear?Clear, they all said.Just then, Jack noticed a pair of rhinos walking in their direction and he motioned for his team to shut up.The two creatures, an adult and child, walked right past the circle of false monks and stopped at the street corner a couple paces away.The adult, a female, pulled out a glowing crystal and looked deep into it, while the child stared up at the mess of traffic above.Then the young rhino turned and looked right at Jack, and he knew it saw his face.Its big, bright eyes showed surprise, and then it smiled and waved to him.It tugged its mothers hand, but Jack raised his finger to his mouth in a silent hush.To his amazement, the motion was understood.The small rhino giggled and waved again, then its mother put the crystal away and started walking, pulling her child along behind her.Jack heard Albrights voice in his memory, from the day she dissected the alien specimens.I havent identified everything yet, but most of its more like us than not.Right at that moment, Jack realized what sort of demon hed become, and he couldnt shake the thought from his head no matter how hard he tried.Chapter 36:  Jack and the Beanstalk  The climbing team stripped off their robes and left them folded up on the ground.The disguises wouldnt matter, since a group of monks climbing the generator would be as suspicious as anything else.Fortunately, the generator complex was of little interest to the citizens of the blue city and there was no traffic nearby, flying or on foot.Their chances of being seen were small, and if they were lucky, that would be enough.Jack didnt like trusting in luck.All four were former corpsmen with jumpsuits dyed darker colors.Each also wore the standard corps duty pack, which housed a climbing harness with built in rappelling cable.The hooks allowed corpsmen to latch onto each other and form a human chain, great for climbing but also useful in strong winds and flood waters.A large part of Corps Basic Training was devoted to the harness effective use.Albright was the most confident climber and she volunteered to take lead.They all hooked up to her, and then off they went up the side of the giant, twisting structure.It felt like they were making quick work of it, but the entry ports remained a long way off, and they seemed only inches closer after a half hour.The surface was covered in handles and was as difficult to climb as a good ladder.Albright supposed the handles were for use in zero g, and her theory made a lot of sense, but things that made too much sense were often wrong in Jacks experience.Jacks experience was surprisingly cynical.They fell into a comfortable rhythm, ascent interspersed with short rests in shallow alcoves they found, and thanks to the many hand holds, they rarely had to backtrack.At each new rest stop, they could see more of the city stretching out beneath them, and Jack was beginning to admire the view.What was foreign and deformed at first was becoming familiar, reminding him not only of Manhattan, but also of Hong Kong and Mumbai.It was a rainbow of brightly colored clothes, spicy smells and strange produce.After nearly two hours, they came to the entry port, which was a tunnel just barely large enough for one of the flyers to squeeze through, located half way between the colonys floor and ceiling.Once everyone was safely on the ledge, Jack took a good look down and the scale of it struck him with a touch of vertigo.He had a tingle at the back of his knees and a sloshy feeling in his stomach, and then it was gone.Hustle up, he said, moving away from the ledge.Lets get this done and get out of here.They scurried down the tunnel, and fifty meters later, it opened into a round room full of golden light, brighter than midday.Jack shielded his eyes and looked for cover.From what little he could see, the room was filled with circles of alabaster columns, and pieces of equipment whose shape he could hardly make out.The team moved in, ducking behind one column and then the next.After a few moments, Jacks eyes adjusted to the light, and his movements became less frantic.He was reasonably sure they were alone.Its a damn sauna in here, Trash grumbled.Albright said, No kidding.Seems we found the furnace.Jack waved the team forward, and idly wondered if theyd find a monster shoveling coal at the center.The columns were staggered so that they were never in direct light for long, and soon they reached the innermost columns where the heat grew unbearable.Jack had just started thinking about how to proceed when their amazing luck struck again.They heard the clothes washer sound of a flyer.The team ducked down into the shadows and did their best to fade into the woodwork.Moments later, a set of eight monks came walking by, their robes shining like glittering gems in the fierce, burning light.As with every other set of monks, they kept their heads down and marched by obliviously.I understand the robes, Albright whispered to Jack.Betcha those guys are nice and cozy with all that heat reflecting off em.Jack was sweating profusely.Wish Id known that earlier.I feel like a Christmas roast.Then Jack heard a sound unlike any other come from the center of the room.Countless warbling tones were layered atop one another, each warping the sounds around them.It was a choir of songbirds singing in chorus through a collection of transforming distortion pedals.If Jack didnt know better, hed think only a synthesizer could produce a sound so starkly unnatural, so beautifully beyond comprehension.When he peaked out from behind his column, he saw something even more perplexing than the sound: the eight monks stood around the center of the room, where a miniature sun floated in mid air surrounded by a cage of the glowing orange cables.The burning ball had grown darker since Jack and his team had arrived, and it was now dark enough to look at directly.The red orange ball slowly rotated while small tongues of flame arced out from its surface.The monks had their arms raised toward the tiny sun, like refugees in a war torn land crying for someone to take them away.Their synthesizer sounds grew louder, and the sun darkened in response.Then the noise stopped and the monks lowered their arms, shrank, slumped down as if energy had been sucked right out of them.They stood there in silence looking at the ball of fire, then turned, headed back to their craft and left.What the hell?Jack asked.Albright shook her head.I dont know, but I wish I had a Geiger counter.Something tells me we shouldnt stay in here any longer than we have to.The sun pulsed, throbbed, and slowly brightened.The demolitionist had a thoughtful look on his face.If thats a fusion furnace, he said while scratching his head, this might just work, chief.We take out its containment and the whole reaction goes out of control.Kablooey!Everything in a hundred klicks is black fertilizer.Jack The tone of Albrights voice spoke volumes.I know, he said.Trash said, We gotta get a move on.Somewhere in the past, Jack was sitting in a packed room full of new recruits.He was lost and angry.Will we engage civilian targets?he asked, knowing damn well what the answer would be.We dont have all day, Trash said urgently, and the insistence in his voice dragged Jack back into the present.His head was a jumble of thoughts, feelings and emotions.Two images kept assaulting him; one a fresh memory and the other a vision of the future yet to come.The rhino childs bright eyes held hope for a better tomorrow, then was snuffed out by a white hot explosion that left nothing behind but a scorch mark.Were aborting, Jack said.What?Trash barked.Its one thing to take out their power.Deal a blow to their infrastructure, but this I wont commit genocide.Genocide?This is justice.Trash reached into his pack and pulled out his det packs.If you dont have the balls, I do.Before the last word came out of Trashs mouth, Jack drew his pistol and leveled it square at his head.Id sooner kill you than let you do this, McGrath.Whats your malfunction, Jack?Trash continued preparing his packs, and Jack took it to the next level.He flicked off his safety, took a long step forward and pressed the barrel flush against the other mans skull.Were corpsmen, God damn it.Were better than this.Now put it away before I end you.Trash gritted his teeth and stared uncut hatred back at Jack.Then he put the packs away.Jack lowered the gun and everyone started to breathe again.This isnt how we operate.Not ever.No matter how many of us they kill, we dont turn into monsters.Trash looked like he could puke bullets, but he didnt test Jacks threat, and it was the right decision.Jack wasnt bluffing.Hed remembered what he stood for, and he wouldve shot Trash dead.So what now?We just bend over and take it?Watch them wipe out the last of us?Jack still had the gun in hand, and it felt heavier than he remembered.No.We fight and survive, but we do it right.Military targets and infrastructure only.Id rather die by my virtues than live like this.Chapter 37:  Detachment  The moment was over, and everything was calm again in the circular generator room.Trash had a twisted grimace on his face, but he dutifully zipped his pack up and slung it back over his shoulder.The insurrection was over.Jack returned his handgun to its holster.At the same moment, the light in the generator room turned a deep, Cabernet red while the innermost ring of columns slid across the floor, forming a gapless barricade around the miniature sun.A low cry like a giant horn howled across the blue city.None of that seemed like good news.Whats going on?the demoman asked.Jacks voice had an edge as sharp as a knife.Weve been found out.Hed followed his conscience, and his luck immediately turned to crap.He didnt know what message the universe was trying to send him, but he sure he didnt like it.Jack rushed back out the entry tunnel and the rest of the team followed.He stopped at the cliff, and when he looked out over the city, he could already see the enemy on their way.Swarms of flyers cut through the air traffic, heading straight for them.All the while, the howl of the giant horn never stopped or faltered.What do we do?Trash asked.There were too many unknowns, and Jack did his best to process them.He could lay a trap with the explosives and try a pitched battle in the generator room, but there was no way to escape.The enemy outnumbered them by the millions, and would wear them down eventually.It might give Charlie and the others a chance to clear out, though.The closest flyer was still more than a minute away.We run.Everybody, back down the wall.The team didnt need to be told twice.Each of them drew their rappelling hooks, latched onto a handle, and dropped over the edge feet first.Their arrestors whined, and with each stop, the team grabbed new handholds, retracted cable and reattached, only to repeat the process again and again.By the time they reached the bottom, flyers were circling the generator room above and were starting to search in widening circles.Charlie came out of the shadows with Nikitin and the others in tow.What the hell did you do up there?Not sure, Jack said, but theyre on to us.Ya think?Nikitin spat sarcastically.So what now?Jack had come to a decision during the trip down, one he didnt particularly like, but it was better than the alternatives.It was a bad plan, but it would get his people out, and that was the only thing that mattered.Trash, I need your det packs, he said.Why?Shut up and hand em over.Trash dug the pale bricks and detonators out of his pack and tossed them to Jack, who stowed them away.Put on the robes and stay hidden until you hear the first of these go off.Charlie, you take everyone back out the way we came.Meet up with the others at the rendezvous and just keep going.What about you?Im gonna raise a ruckus.Charlie got in his face.Dont be stupid, Jack.Were all leaving.Just need to be sneaky about it.That ship sailed, and you know it.They wont stop searching until they find someone, and if they dont find anyone here, theyll start looking outside and were all fucked.This way, you all at least have a chance.Now follow my damn orders.Yeah, and no ones going to notice theres only seven of us?Who can count with bombs going off?Jack was ready to punch his little brother in the mouth, but it didnt come to that.Charlie nodded his head solemnly and started handing out the robes.You heard the man.Put em on.When Jack turned to Albright, she unshouldered her rifle.The doctor was a five foot commando again.Im with you.Jack walked over to her, took her in his arms and kissed her.Every inch of her was tense, but she melted and then it seemed to last forever.Jack pulled away, and said, Like hell you are.But I  They need you, Lisa.And I need you to survive.Its what I do.She was stunned, but Jack wouldnt budge on this.He could sacrifice his own life if he had to, but not hers.Not now.He gave her one more gentle kiss on the forehead and said, Ill see you again.I promise.And he was gone before she could say another word.Jack ran hard, his feet pounding tiled floor, and the taste of her still on his lips.He flew out from their hiding spot and circled the generator tower; when he was ninety degrees around the bend, he turned and bolted off into parts unknown.Jack came to his first stop fifty meters on.He pulled a putty like demo pack out and attached it to a shack, then jammed a detonator inside.He set the timer for ten minutes, set his watch alarm for nine forty five, and bolted off running again.He hit a residential sector, pulled the rifle from his back and started to yell.Crowds of aliens ran away in terror, like a tiger had escaped from the zoo and was rampaging through the streets.Get down!he yelled as he began to fire.He aimed high to avoid the bystanders, and his rounds sparked impotently off the stalagmite buildings.The loud bark of fire had the desired effect, sending the innocents scattering, and he continued running right on past.He didnt bother to look over his shoulder.There was no need.The cyclic sound of the flyers overhead was enough to let him know he had their attention.Another few paces on, he heard soldier rhinos grunting and galloping, and he knew the ground forces were onto him as well.The residential area gave way to a market, and Jacks howling madman routine turned heads wherever he went.Crowds parted before him like the sea before Moses, and he sprinted on, driven by an endless surge of adrenaline.Jack decided to explore a bit.He cut between two buildings and loped up a ramp to the suspended catwalks.It was a whole new part of the city made of branching beams, with its own set of store fronts and signs scrawled in unfamiliar characters.Yet more levels waited above.Then the game got interesting.This level was too tight for flyers, and they stayed high up above, but now every corner held a set of rhinos stampeding in his direction.Escape routes closed off all around.Jack heard a skittering noise behind him and instinctively hit the deck just in time for a jackrabbit to go flying overhead.The small creature yelped when it missed him, and clawed at the floor as it slid away.He turned his head back and saw two more of the fast creatures bounding his way.Both leaped into the air at the same time, and with a spin, he dodged one and flung the other off the catwalk onto the ground floor below.Toro!He shouted, before sprinting off once again.Option after option disappeared, forcing his choices until he found himself on a long bridge with no offramps, and nothing nearby but empty air.Enemy forces moved into position on either end.Theyd snared him.He fired a couple rounds toward the far end as a warning, and the enemy ducked back.Then he turned and opened fired on his pursuers, sending them scattering.He stopped when the magazine ran dry.Now what?he asked himself.The alarm on his watch went off, and an idea sparked in his head.It would require pinpoint timing, and it was the most dangerous and stupid thing hed ever considered.He worried that it might just work.Jack pulled a second demo pack out, drove a detonator into it and set the timer for fifteen seconds then dropped in the middle of the catwalk.The whole process took him no more than five seconds.With his rifle quiet, the enemies at either end of the bridge started moving forward, and Jack flicked his head back and forth, watching both groups advance.When they were thirty meters off, a loud, hollow boom registered in the distance.His signal to move.All eyes turned toward the explosion, and Jack made good on the opportunity.He pulled his climbing hook out and hurdled the guard rail, barely managing to latch onto it as he flew over, then plummeted toward the ground.The arrestor slowed his descent, and when he reached the bottom, he released it and dove across the ground.At the same time, the catwalk above exploded, and the entire bridge collapsed in a billowing cloud of dust.The shock wave struck him like a wrecking ball, driving him another ten meters across the smooth floor, where he slammed into a wall and stopped.Bruised, bloodied and disoriented, he wobblingly tried to stand, but only slipped and fell back down.The cool ground felt so nice against his face that he couldnt imagine trying ever again.In his dizzy head, he drifted between the blue alien city and the memory of a terrible hang over, when hed lain on a cool, smooth bathroom floor.During one of his fits of consciousness, he thought he heard rhino troopers grunting, and when he opened his eyes and looked around, the ugly bastards were standing over him in a circle.They spoke back and forth, probably trying to decide what to feed him to.Everything was dim, and Jack realized he didnt have long.He couldnt think straight.He numbly pawed at his chest and found what he thought was a gun.He pulled the weapon out of its holster, fumbled at the hammer until it clicked, then aimed upward and fired.With a thump, a bright red orange flare arced into the sky.Damn, he said.It wasnt the first time he mistook the flare gun for a weapon.After a moment, his frustration disappeared and he slipped into heavy darkness.None of the dreams he found there were pleasant.Chapter 38:  The View From Above  Jack was confused when he woke up.Really confused.Hed been confused before, like when he got to the analogy section of his college entrance exams and couldnt figure out how dispatch might relate to sluggishness.This was worse.If anything, he was roughly as confused as the time his roommate gave him a funny mushroom, and he spent the rest of the day trying to figure out how walls worked.The most confusing part was that he was still alive.His whole body hurt, and it felt like someone was trying to pull his arms out of their sockets.Worse, the room around him didnt make a lick of sense.The walls were in the wrong place and made of green webs.There was something oddly like a door nearby, but it was attached to the ceiling.Everything was completely wrong in ways he couldnt understand.Jack wanted to throw up, but the empty pit in his stomach told him itd be uneventful.He couldnt move.Cold metal shackles had every part of his body pinned, and struggling against them was useless.He didnt bother to call for help, since something terrible might respond.So he lay there, breathing and aching, waiting for whatever the hell would happen next.Time melted away without any way to measure its passage.He might have lain there for hours, days or weeks for all he knew.It was all the same.A single, unending moment, punctuated only by the procession of mangled memories, and the short fits of sleep that interrupted them.He thought back over the strange journey that brought him to that room.He remembered the life he used to have, all of the weird and wonderful places hed seen, and the grateful faces hed helped along the way.That life existed once upon a time in a storybook that had since been burnt to ash and scattered to the wind.His life was gone, replaced by a world he hardly recognized.A world that had been crushed, eviscerated and torn limb from limb.In its smouldering remains, Jack had changed as well.He became someone different.Someone harder, who killed efficiently and without remorse, over and over until it became clear the killing could never sate him.It would never heal the wound, or quiet his mourning for the lifetime left behind.Of this new life, which had hit a dead end in some screwy alien prison, Jack knew only one thing: whatever changes might come would be for the worse.And after an eternity alone with his thoughts, Jacks prediction came true.The strange door in the ceiling opened like denim unraveling, revealing a blinding light behind it.Three silhouettes walked through the portal, and continued down the opposite wall.Jack stared at the visual puzzle for a few seconds, until his head straightened out and he figured it out.Hed been hanging from the ceiling all this time, and his captors were on the floor beneath him.Two rhinos stood with their massive autocannons at the ready, on either side of a new kind of alien.This species was much more human like, but in gangly, funhouse mirror proportions.He wore a form fitting uniform that covered him from head to toe, made from some slick material in midnight blue and slate grey.The double breasted jacket reminded Jack of fascist armies, and the leathery mask looked like something from a kinky sex shop.A white crescent crossed one eye.The fascist aliens movements were pin point specific, and fluid without excess.He stepped to the center of the room and stopped beneath Jack, then looked up at the prisoner and carefully examined him.Apparently satisfied, he raised his right arm and tapped commands into some kind of wrist computer.He looked back up at Jack and began to speak.The sounds were familiar, and Jack realized the alien was speaking a human language.It was a form of Arabic, one of many languages that Jack hardly spoke a word of.I dont speak Arabic, asshole.The alien looked back to his computer and entered some more commands.Jack couldnt see the display very well, but he caught streams of text flying by in a rainbow of colors.Subject language identification English.Understand does you thing I say?Yeah, sure.Fuck off, ya sack of shit.You understand that?Dialect North American.Variety Midwestern?The aliens sentence structure left much to be desired, but his accent was good and improving with every word.He had only a hint of something awkward in his pacing, like an autistic child.Pacific States Alliance, Jack said.Thanking you.He tapped some information into his computer, and then turned his full attention back to Jack.Now we is capable to understand eachs other.I to fabricate questions, and you are making answer.And if I dont feel much like making answer?The response was one word.Pain.The aliens sharp eyes studied Jack intently, analyzing every movement, twitch, and wayward glance.He felt like he was being vivisected.You is understanding?Good.We commence questions.What name is?Go to fucking hell.The alien shook his head, then removed a short baton from his belt.He made sure Jack got a good look at the weapon, then he thrust it into Jacks armpit quick as a cobra strike.Jacks whole side exploded in strobing, lightning flashes of pain that streaked out across his chest and arm.Jack gritted his teeth and grunted.His whole face twisted into a knot.I was studied species acutely, and I having found many fifty productive nerve intersections.It is introduction.Pain will to increase during resistance continuing.You is understand?Yes.Good.I repeating, what name is?Pretty sure I told you to go to hell.The baton struck in the exact same spot, but the pain was worse.It was an unstoppable flood, and his arm spasmed.When it finally subsided, Jack was struck by a memory of his karate teacher showing the kids a couple pressure points, talking about how effective they could be when used properly.You is challenge.Is soldier yes?Screaming not, but will to scream soon.I to begin new nerve package, and true pain then.Jack was drooling, but he couldnt do a thing about it.Name unimportant, Nefrem.Reveal location is battle fleet.Jacks chest was twitching, and he was having trouble speaking.I dont dont think that made it through the translator.Where location battle fleet is!?Nefrem fleet must to return.When is return?What are you talking about?The alien reached up and grabbed Jacks throat.When?it demanded.I dont understand, he gurgled.A deep, throaty growl came out of the alien, and his grip on Jacks throat tightened.When?the alien kept saying over and over again, until Jack slipped back into darkness, where more twisted dreams awaited him.Chapter 39:  Interrogation  Jacks life took on a peculiar sort of rhythm.They left him alone in his cell to stew for long stretches, until such time as the fascist alien bastard came back to question and torture him some more.During each questioning session, he was pushed up to and past his threshold for pain.He would pass out and find a small measure of peace, only to awaken later and repeat the process all over again.Jack felt like Prometheus chained to his rock.His resolve only lasted so long, and he started to answer questions, mingling truth and lies, losing track of where one began and the other ended.Sometimes, he made a game of giving the most ridiculous answers possible, speaking at length about an army called the Lost Boys who had a base hidden in Never Never Land, or the terrorist leader Christopher Robin and the suicide missions he launched from the 100 Acre Wood.When he ran out of kids books, he turned to movies, spinning stories about British super spies, flying Chinese monks, and space police with lenses attached to their hands.The interrogator listened intently but never bought a word of it, and Jack discovered that the quality of his story telling had zero effect on the amount of torture he received.He had no idea how much time passed or was passing, and he lost count of how many sessions he endured.The only change from one day to the next was the interrogators grasp of English, which improved at a startling rate but remained oddly stilted.Throughout it all, Jack somehow refused to divulge his name despite whatever pain he was subjected to; it was his alone, and he wouldnt let them have that piece of him.The interrogator addressed him only as Nefrem, and whenever Jack asked about the word, he was introduced to yet another pressure point, offering its own unique flavor of agony.The interrogator thought Jack was playing dumb, and no amount of arguing could convince him otherwise.Their relationship was a tense one, yet they somehow grew comfortable with one another.Jack spent more time howling and slobbering than he ever could have imagined, but the interrogator didnt relish the work; he performed it clinically, without joy or satisfaction.He even displayed mercy on occasion, and Jack thought he might be able to forgive the interrogator.Those times didnt come often.Whenever Jack was left alone, he prayed.He hadnt since he was a child, and it was awkward at first.The prayers started out formal, complete with all of the holy fathers, arts and thous he could remember, but soon he was talking to God like an old friend returned from a long trip.When his prayers went unanswered, he bargained, hoping that smaller requests might be granted where larger ones were ignored, but that went nowhere quickly.Finally, the prayers disappeared and he just talked to himself, because unlike God, he was polite enough to reply.Facing a future that promised nothing but pain, Jack began to wish for death.He just wanted it to end, and he considered sharing this fact with the interrogator.He wasnt sure if the masked alien might grant his wish, or if it was exactly the submission theyd been working toward all along.Jack never revealed his desire to die, and the torture continued unabated.When reality grew unbearable, he retreated into ever more complex fantasies, managing to convince himself the whole ordeal was just a terrible dream, and that hed wake up back in sunny San Jose at any moment.He imagined lying in his king size bed with Jess snoring beside him, then sneaking out to read the newspaper over a glass of orange juice with the morning sun breaking through the trees outside his window.The simple, prosaic details had the most gravity.They pulled him down into the dream, and made it feel more real.He could just about taste the tangy sweet orange juice and feel its squishy pulp on his tongue when a surprising jolt of pain thrust him back into real reality.Back in his cell, strapped to the ceiling like a modern art exhibit, while the interrogator stared up at him from below.You drifted away for a moment, Nefrem.So sorry about that, Jack said through gritted teeth, What was the question?I dont believe I asked one, the interrogator said.Tell me, where did you go?Dunno know what you mean.When you were off just now.Where did you go?Home, Jack said.The word evoked feelings that were strange and out of place now.They were the phantom feelings of an amputated life.The interrogator took a seat on the floor.That was a first.He was acting particularly strange this session, and Jack thought he should be on guard for trickery, but he didnt have the energy to be on guard against anything.His constant state of half starved delirium made anything more complex than basic sarcasm impossible.Thats the first question youve answered truthfully.No ones perfect.The interrogator was deep in thought.Jack considered spitting on him, but doubted he could muster enough saliva.I have determined after rigorous experimentation that we are in a deadlock.An impasse.You cannot be broken by pain alone, and for that, I commend you.Thanks, I guess.I suspect that you have already resigned yourself to death.Perhaps you consider yourself dead already, and your body nothing but an empty shell.Maybe I just like the pain.The interrogator let out a queer laugh.Possible but unlikely.Youve shown no signs of arousal during our sessions.I suspect that you might fold were I to mutilate you, but I find that option unsavory.Dont have the balls to cut me up?I have employed mutilation before, but only in dire circumstances.I find such tactics dishonorable and morally reprehensible.They are not to be considered lightly.I see.And this shit is just business as usual?Essentially.Pain is fleeting and impermanent.With time, the memory fades and the mind heals.Not so with mutilation.It renders parts of the subject forever unusable, and the possibility of total psychological collapse is always close at hand.Its a point of no return, beyond which atonement becomes unreachable.Nice to know you have limits.All life has limits, Nefrem.Even you.The interrogator said things like that often, and they always took Jack by surprise.Whatever these Nefrem were, the interrogator held them in high regard.They were legendary, and Jack held the same status by association.So, what now?The interrogator considered.If you give me what I want, I will release you.To the outside or death, whichever is your preference.What do you want?Information.I dont have any.Jack spaced his words deliberately, like speaking to an unruly child.But I know you do.Your species is guarding a secret, and I will uncover it by any means necessary.If you will not assist me, then one of the others will.Jacks mind raced, but he tried not to let it show.What others?Could the rest of his team have been captured?No, he told himself, he was being played.He retreated from the thought, and stuck to his guns.Tell me what I wish to know, Nefrem.Tell me where your battle fleet has gone, and when it will return.I am not a Nefrem, Jack said, Im a free man.Then we are done, the interrogator said.He stood and walked from the room, saying, Farewell.You will not see me again.The bastard left Jack alone in silence, and for some reason he would never fully understand, he began to weep.His body quaked.Tears ran down his nose and dropped to the floor below, where they formed a shallow puddle.He cried until the darkness once again came to take him away.Chapter 40:  Solitary  The next time Jack opened his eyes, he was on the floor of a different room, wearing rags too threadbare to hang himself with.The place was stark and empty, with flat, smooth walls in perfectly inert grey.The only noticeable details were a hole in the floor for waste, a small dish attached to one wall that was constantly full of water, and a deep slot beside it just wide enough to fit a hand inside.This was Jacks new world.Stuff came out of the slot every now and again that turned out to be food.It was a curious smelling pile of lukewarm chunks that may have been meat, vegetable or neither.It came in different colors, but always tasted the same.His first attempts at eating ended in vomiting, but it wasnt a problem with the food.Jack had been fed intravenously for so long that his stomach wasnt yet up to the task, but he kept at it, and by the fourth meal he kept some down.Things improved from there.He suspected the food was dispensed on a timed interval, but he had no way to know for sure.Regardless, he used bits of each meal to mark the walls so he could have at least an idea of how much time had passed.Otherwise, there was a perplexing sameness to his days.No one ever came to check on him, and he never heard anything outside.The cell was his own personal purgatory, and after scouring every last millimeter of it, he decided there could be no escape.He couldnt even figure out how they got him in.His body was a damn wreck.The time spent hanging from the ceiling had taken its toll, leaving him weak, emaciated, and covered from head to toe in deep, discolored bruises.His shoulders were especially sore from holding his weight, and it took some time before he could raise his arms without severe discomfort.A strong breeze could have blown him over, and restoring his health became a top priority.Each day, he woke up, exercised as much as he could, then rested and ate.After his meal, he exercised to his limit again, then broke for his second meal, and returned for one last exercise session, this time only stopping when he collapsed.He was always so exhausted by then that sleep came easily.The interrogators torture had altered Jacks relationship with pain, and he found himself working straight through exhaustion and muscle fatigue, right up to the point when he literally couldnt move anymore.As time passed, that point stretched further and further out, until he could work himself virtually non stop.In truth, he wasnt just used to the pain; he craved it.Trapped in that grey box, it was the only thing he had left, and he never let it far out of his grasp.It was the last thing grounding him to reality.His life went on like this through one hundred and thirty seven meals, each day the same as the one before it, and then it changed.He passed out as usual in a pool of his own sweat, but when he awoke, he wasnt alone.The other man was huddled in a ball against the wall, shivering even though the room was stuffy and warm.He was dressed in rags like Jacks, and was both badly bruised and malnutritioned.His gaunt physique reminded Jack of old pictures showing Jewish prisoners in German concentration camps.The man had his knees drawn up and his head buried in them.He was sobbing, and Jack couldnt get a look at his face.Jack was so surprised, he didnt know what to do.He felt like his space had been invaded and he had a powerful urge to attack, followed quickly by a sense of self disgust that left him confused, and ultimately silent.So Jack went about his daily business and tried to pretend nothing had changed.He stretched until he felt good and limber, then dropped to the floor and did push ups.After working up a good sweat, he stood, spread his feet and lowered himself into a horse stance, then stood there until his quads felt like they might catch fire.Meanwhile, the other man sat on his side of the room.He never looked up or pulled his face away from his knees.He did nothing but sob for hours on end.Then lunch time came.The slot in the wall produced a pile of multi colored food chunks, which Jack attacked voraciously.He stuffed his cheeks full like a chipmunk, and was piling more food in when he stopped himself.He decided to be more than just an animal in a cage.He grabbed a handful of food bits and carried them over to the other prisoner.Hey, he said.It didnt come out easily.He hadnt spoken in so long he could hardly remember how.The other man didnt respond.Hey, you should eat, Jack said.His words were hurried and sloppy.He sounded like a caveman.Gotta keep yer strength up.The other man finally looked up with yellow discolored eyes, and a face just as gaunt and wasted as his body.Jack held out the food.Gotta eat.Need strength to fight em.The yellow eyed man reached out with a shaking hand, took the food and returned to hiding behind his knees.It was a first step, and Jack returned to his own side of the cell, mindful not to push too hard.He exercised until dinner came, then again portioned out food and brought it to the other man, who took it and went back to hiding behind his knees.Jack finished his own food fast and skipped that evenings exercise regimen.He tried to sleep with one eye open but didnt get much rest, only managing to sleep for short bursts before waking in fits of heart thumping paranoia.It was hard to be sure, but he didnt think the other guy slept much either.The next day, he went about his morning exercises as usual until lunch rolled around, and then made another attempt at diplomacy.He gathered up a handful of food and delivered it to the huddled up man, and said, Heya, food time.The other grunted and took it.You speak English?The mans eyes were full of fear and confusion.He stared at Jack for a long time while he nibbled at the food like a rat.A little, he finally said.Hey.Thats great.Really great.Im Jack.Whats your name?The other glanced around like he thought someone else might be listening.Kai, he said.My names Kai.Please to meetcha, Kai.Jack had known a fellow named Kai who was from Finland.He looked at this new Kai, and he honestly couldnt figure out what ethnicity the guy might be.He had the most forgettable face Jack had ever seen.Are you from Finland?he asked.Yeah.Puhutko suomea?What?Um I dont speak Finnish.Oh.Silence, and Jack was kind of glad for it.He didnt remember conversations being such a damn struggle.So Howd you get here?Kai shook his head.Dont want to talk about it.Thats right, right.Okay.Sorry.But youre okay, right?Yeah.Well ummm, Jack droned, I uhhh Im just gonna go back to doin what I was doin.Stay cool, right?Right.Jack didnt used to repeat himself so much before his incarceration.Hed have to work on that.He went back to his exercise, and attacked it with a renewed vigor.Itd been months since he last saw another human being, and he never imagined how important other people were to him.Better still, hed made some headway this time.The sense of accomplishment was more filling than a home cooked meal.When dinner rolled around, Kai met him at the dispenser and they both ate like ravenous animals.The feeding frenzy might have lacked culture, but it was better than being alone.Anything short of torture was better than being alone, and over the following weeks, things improved.Chapter 41:  Comrade  and when the time came, I couldnt do it.I refused to have millions of deaths on my head, alien or not.In return for my mercy, I ended up here.No kidding.What did you do before the invasion?I was ERC, Jack said, but Kai looked confused.Then Jack was confused, too.He was sure everyone knew about the ERC.Emergency Response Corps?Global do gooders.Firefighters and medics and stuff.Oh, yeah.Sorry.Didnt recognize the name.Salright.You were a firefighter?Jack shook his head and made big motions with his hands.No, no, no.Those guys are crazy.The smokejumpers especially.Man, skydiving and firefighting.Might as well jam your hand in a blender.No, I was search and rescue.Tracked down lost hikers and mountain climbers.That kinda stuff.A lot of need for that?Some.Not really.We spent most of our time backing up other teams, like those crazy ass smokejumpers.Kai let out an awkward chuckle, then got a weird look on his face.Jack said, What?Why are you giving me that look?I dont know.I thought you were a soldier for some reason.Nope.Not until the shit hit the fan, at least.Used to be against war of any kind.Hurting people, pain and suffering.That stuff was the enemy.I was a true believer, but the invasion changed my outlook I guess.True believer?In the mission, man.I helped people, and its all I wanted to do.I didnt care who.Just help em, ya know?It was a different time.Yeah.Ever changing world, right?How about you, Kai?Whatd you used to do?A lot of things.Construction mostly.I was building an offshore drilling platform when it happened.Musta been nice.Out on the oceans and all that.The bastards probably didnt pay much attention to you guys.Not at first.Took them months to come out for us.Where were you when it happened?In the sky.What?Sorry.The Corps they flew us into China after the first strike, while the invasion was still happening.We didnt know what the hell was going on, and next thing I know, Im in a busted ass helicopter falling out of low orbit.Intense.Yeah, I guess so.We crashed in the dust cloud, and hit the ground running.Just kept moving and gathering survivors, hoping to find some place that wasnt toast.We saw so many dead, though.Corpses piled up in Jacks head.So damn many dead.Im sorry, Kai said.No.No, its alright.They they didnt have to survive this crap.They were the lucky ones.Kai nodded, and then neither spoke for a long time.It had taken them a while to get to this point, and Jack suspected Kai had suffered more torture than he had.The man was just short of catatonic when he arrived, but after the first week, he came back to life.He was a fast healer, too.Bruises had already faded to hints of their former glory, and he didnt look half as gaunt.His eyes were still discolored, but Jack chalked that up to allergies or malnutrition.Listen, Kai said quietly and moved closer, did they ever ask you about the the Nefrem?Jack couldnt figure out why Kai was acting so cloak and dagger.Maybe he knew something about the prison cells that Jack didnt.Constantly, he said, and shuddered at the memory of the torture sessions.Wish I had any damn idea what a Nefrem was.Itd make stonewalling them that much more satisfying.Yeah.And all that talk about a battle fleet.Did he mean in space?I guess.I just dont get it, Jack said.I mean, if we had a secret fleet, wouldnt we have used it to protect ourselves?These sons of bitches roll over us in five minutes and then have the gall to ask where our battle fleet is.Its like kicking a three year old and then demanding his car keys.I figured he was just messing with my head.Trying to keep us off guard?Makes sense.I dont know what the hell else it coulda been.Kai had a particularly dead look in his eyes.Who knows.Maybe its a case of mistaken identity.Jack froze for a second, then laughed so hard it hurt.Oh God, thats rich.You, my friend, officially have the bleakest outlook in the whole damned universe.Kai asked, How do you figure?How do I figure?So, big bad space invaders drops trou on our planet and shit all over us.Its one thing if theyre looking for a new home, or theyre on some kind of religious crusade, out slaughtering infidels, or get this maybe theyre just mean bastards who cant stand the sight of us.I can believe any of that.But blotting out ten billion lives by mistake?Like a filing error or something?That would be the most depressing thing in the history of damn depressing things.Kai smiled.I guess youre right.Truth is, Ive got my own theory about why theyre here.Really?Do tell.Jack looked at Kai with a steely gaze, his eyes burning with a cold fire, and he beckoned the other man forward.When Kai was close, Jack whispered, They were evicted.I dont follow.From their last planet.They missed rent a couple months in a row, and the landlord was finally like, dude, get the hell out.The look in Kais eyes said he wasnt sure if Jack was serious or not.A breath later, they both erupted in laughter.Think he turned the heat off first?Like a subtle hint?Naw, Jack said.They just woke up one morning with all their clothes floating in orbit.And Ill tell you this, they sure as shit didnt get their security deposit back.And they both laughed some more.Jack laughed so hard he had tears in his eyes.Then that silence returned.Anyway, Im gonna try to get some sleep.Ill catch you in the morning, alright?Kai nodded, and Jack headed back over to his side of the cell.Hey Jack, can I ask you one last thing?Shoot.What Whats the biggest mistake you ever made?I dunno.Ive made some whoppers in my time.Just pick one.Fine.When I was a little punk ass back in high school, I used to street race with friends.It was dumb, but ya know, we were kids.This one night, the rain is falling just a little bit, and suddenly Im out of control.Wheels are spinning, making a God awful racket, and the back end gets loose.I pound on the breaks and the whole car starts to slide.Im screwed.Im screaming, my buddy Kyle is yellin in the passenger seat, and then I dont really remember what happened.I wake up and the cars in a ditch.Kyles bleeding all over the place.Did he die?No.Someone in the other car was smart enough to call an ambulance, and they got to him in time.It was close, though.So everything worked out alright?I guess.I mean, I almost lost a good friend and for what?For nothing.For being a stupid kid.What came of it?Kyle stayed in the hospital for a few weeks, and I got community service.
