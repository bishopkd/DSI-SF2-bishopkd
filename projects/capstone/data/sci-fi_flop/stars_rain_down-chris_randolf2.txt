His breathing was slow and methodical.They never would have approved that mission, he finally said.The windbags wouldve destroyed your data, and you along with it.Made sure you couldnt get a job teaching grade school science in Siberia.Youre a real son of a bitch, Donovan.Thanks I think.Faulkland unbuckled his harness and pushed off into the middle of the bridge, his eyes fastened on the strange object.I know I should be furious right now, but man alive, this is really something.Something wonderful.Marcus drifted over to meet him, and then turned and pointed out at Zebra One.His pose mimicked every painting of an explorer discovering a lost city.A promise just waiting to be fulfilled.Besides, where would you prefer to find your name in the history books, Commander?By a manned mission to Jupiter, or first contact with extra terrestrial life?Yeah, was all Faulkland said.Then he woke from his stupor.Shen, prepare a status update for Bangalore.Tell them that weve arrived at Zebra One and will begin initial survey within the hour.He gave Marcus a knowing nod.That might be a problem, sir, Mason Shen said in consternation.He was working furiously at his station.Ive lost contact with Earth, sir.Solar flare?Faulkland asked.No, sir.The forecast is spotless, and radiation is within tolerance.Signal just went dead about five minutes ago, and I havent picked up a thing since.Im still receiving a carrier signal from Mars, though.Strange.Probably nothing.Relay through Mars until we can re establish contact.Aye aye.Faulkland turned back to Marcus.What now, Doctor?Marcus had years worth of plans ready to unfold.This is our first glance up her skirt, and Id like to make a few passes along the length of her.Get the lay of the land.With any luck, we might get some insight into how her camouflage works.After that, we go out to meet her in person.Raos team identified a number of structures we call irises, which they suspect are air locks, or else some kind of unknown organ.Either way, our investigations should start there.Iris Charlie on the starboard side of the main hull appears to be the most accessible.How many times have you rehearsed that speech?Thousands, Marcus replied.Then he noticed something about Faulklands demeanor that he couldnt immediately put into words.Youre coming along, he said incredulously.Faulkland had a smile as wide as the stars.Wild horses couldnt stop me.Isnt that kind of reckless?If we werent a little reckless, Marcus, we wouldnt be space cowboys.Marcus Donovan reflected on that and decided that truer words had never been spoken.* * *  Copernicus Observatory was dark.Its generator was off line for routine maintenance, and during this part of the stations orbit, the sun was completely hidden behind the Earth, leaving the distant stars the only remaining source of light.Nils Jansen was floating around near the main power console, idly looking over a wiring diagram with a flashlight.He was wearing most of a skin tight pressure suit, all except for the helmet which was still dangling from his hip.The station was reasonably comfortable, and he could hardly stand to wear the stuffy thing.It made him feel claustrophobic, and he likely wouldnt put it on until air inside the station began to taste foul.Other than Jansen, the spherical control center was completely deserted.He was part of a three man skeleton crew who kept things in order while Bangalore controlled the scanning array from the ground.Research teams occasionally came through on short tours, but in the mean time, Jansen and the other two technicians kept the seats warm, made sure the place didnt fall apart, and tried not to kill one another.It wasnt Jansens dream job, but the salary was alright, it was easy work, and he accrued enough leave to visit his family every few months.It could be worse, he assured himself.He could be hurtling through space on some fool alien hunt.He flicked his headset on.Marco?There was another moment of silence, then his earpiece crackled to life.Polo.Jansen groaned.When are you gonna give up that lame, tired ass joke?About ten seconds after you start addressing me properly.Fine, he said.Technician Jansen to Technician Esquivel: Are you done yet?I wanna turn the power back on.Over.Nope.Two blown fuses at Junction D7.I just sent Hopkins off to get replacements.Jansen looked down at the crinkly wiring diagram and found Junction D7, then started looking for the nearest storage locker.He found it a hundred meters away.You sent Hop?Hell take a week.Hes getting faster, Marco said hopefully.Jansen shook his head.No, hes not.Just let me pretend.You guys realize I can hear you, right?Hopkins asked.Jansen folded his wiring diagram back up and tucked it into a pouch.Do me a favor and hurry up, would ya?Im missing a Jeffersons marathon.And the whole world wept, Marco said caustically.Over and out.Jansen covered his microphone.Dolt wouldnt know quality TV if it bit him on the ass.A moment later, he began to twiddle his thumbs, hoping that the pressure suits thick gloves might make the task more challenging.He was sorely disappointed.Then Nils Jansen heard a noise like none hed ever heard before.It was so strange that he couldnt even begin to describe it.So strange that he began to wonder if it was a noise at all, or if he was suffering some kind of hallucination.He was pretty sure space madness was only an urban legend, but he sometimes had his doubts.This was one of those times.Guys, theres something weird going on out here, Hopkins ever pitiful voice squeaked, huffing and puffing between words.Not a hallucination, Jansen decided.What is it?The response came back fast.I dont friggin know, Nils.If I knew, dont you think I wouldve said something more descriptive than something weird?Jesus.Jansen, Im in an access tube right now.Can you see what hes blubbering about?Jansen was already moving around to a better vantage point.Which direction, Hop?Heading I dunno.Just look towards the moon.He wheeled around and there it was, whatever it was.There was a slight shimmering in empty space, like photos hed seen of the aurora, but the pattern was all wrong.It reminded him of the house he grew up in, when the late summer sun would reflect off the pool, leaving undulating patterns on the screen door and the ceiling.Do you see it, Jansen?He was dumbfounded.Jansen?He snapped back to attention.Yeah, I see it.I dont know what the hell it is, either.He stared at the undulating field of light, slack jawed, while colors played across it in every shade of the rainbow.In another moment, he was sure that it wasnt just one field of light, but seven spaced out evenly.Then solid shapes began to emerge from within.The lights stretched around them, clinging like latex, until they were whole and complete.The light shimmered and faded away, revealing seven jagged discs like nothing Jansen had ever seen before.There was a lot of that going around.You see em, Hop?He asked.Sure do.They look like like bone or something.See what?Marco demanded.Jansen ignored him.Oyster shell.No, more like coral, Hopkins said.Hopkins was right.The texture of the discs was remarkably like coral in a fantastic shade of royal blue.Jansen had no idea what that meant, or if it meant anything at all.As he floated there against the window with his mouth gaping open, he tried to find some frame of reference to gauge how big the discs were, but to no avail.He suddenly wished hed paid more attention in his astronomy courses.Like Hopkins had.What do you think?Five kilometers across?The line was dead for a moment.Bigger.Ten, maybe twenty.Its hard to tell.You guys arent making any damn sense, Marco said bitterly.Would someone please tell me whats going on?Use words and sentences.For a single pregnant moment, the discs sat there motionless, and Jansen had a feeling they were examining the Earth.They were considering their next move.Then they burst into motion, accelerating at a rate Jansen never wouldve believed if he hadnt seen it with his own eyes.They scattered around the globe.Maybe theyre trying to make contact, Hopkins said.The tone of his voice said he didnt believe it either.There was a burst of light in the distance.An explosion.The Sunyaev Observatory was out that way.Another light flashed, this time from the direction of the Brahe Array.A half dozen more explosions appeared in the following seconds.It was the first depressing fireworks show Jansen had ever seen.Marco, Jansen finally said into an already dead communicator, weve got company, and I dont think they brought pie.Chapter 6:  The Earth Stands Still  The sky was dull grey, and rain was trying to fall in fits and starts.It wasnt a storm yet, but the promise of something dreadful hid within the water fat clouds.Jack Hernandez wasnt pleased.The last thing he wanted to see on returning from hurricane ravaged Jacksonville was more rain.Hed been hip deep in flood waters for so long he could scarcely remember what dry underwear felt like, and he spent the entire flight home dreaming about the warm San Jose sun.His plan was to do nothing but dry out for two straight days.The sun, that cowardly bastard, was nowhere to be found.Jacks train ride was quiet and fast, followed by an energetic if mechanical march back from the station and a quick trot up to the door.The apartment unlocked itself as he approached, and he was already half stripped when the door closed behind him.He tossed his backpack aside, unzipped his jumpsuit and let it hang limply from his waist, drew his tank top over his head and threw it to the floor.Hopping, he yanked off one boot and then the other, stepped out of the jumpsuit and left it in a damp heap.In another moment, his sponge like boxers and socks were gone, and he collapsed on the living room carpet naked.The air in his apartment was cool andto Jacks great satisfactionbone dry.Without the television on, the room was silent save for the sound of his breathing and the intermittent patter of rain on the patio.It didnt quite measure up to his sun soaked dreams, but it would do.He lost track of time lying there on the floor, staring at the ceiling and listening to a world momentarily at peace.When his phone began to ring, he was adamant about not answering it.Just let it go, he told himself.It cant be anything important.The answering machine will get it.The second ring came and went, the third followed close behind.By the fourth, he was starting to reconsider.Before the fifth ring came, he was on his feet and moving.He plucked the handset from its cradle.Hello?Hey Jack, a sultry sweet voice came back.You were supposed to call when you landed, dopefish.Sorry, Jess.I was so tired, I came straight home and passed out.That was close enough to the truth.Good news, then.Im on my way over with an armload of groceries.Im cooking you dinner tonight.Whats the occasion?How about because I miss you, silly?Jack smiled, and for a second his thoughts wandered to the ring nestled in its delicate little box at the bottom of his sock drawer.Good reason.How far away are you?Five minutes, she guessed.That doesnt give me much time to get dressed.Whatever youre wearing is fine, Jess said.See you in a bit.Then dial tone.Jack dropped the phone back into its cradle and saw the message light blinking.It couldnt be good news.It was never good news, but he hit play anyway.Dont suppose you recognize my voice, do you?Its your mother.Maybe I should adopt the answering machine; at least it picks up the phone when I call.Anyway, just letting you know Charlie got promoted to Staff Sergeant.Isnt that great?I know you dont like what he does, but you should talk to him.He worked so hard, and Hed never say it, but he still looks up to you.He only joined up with Carbon Corp because he wanted to help people like you do.Hes starting his third tour, Egypt this time, and Id really appreciate if you at least gave him a call before he ships out.I guess thats it.Hope you and Jess can join us for Thanksgiving.Love you, and call me sometime.It never ceased to amaze Jack how much guilt that woman could cram into a one minute recording.He also realized, with heavy heart, that shed never understand the rift between her sons.When Jack joined the ERC, he dedicated himself to helping people any way he could, regardless of race, religion or politics.He risked life and limb for strangers every day, and it just wasnt the kind of work a person could do without believing in the cause.He was a true believer, through and through.Then Charlie made the most Charlie like decision possible: he became a damned mercenary with Carbon Corporation.He wasnt helping people; he was putting bleeding holes in them and blowing them to bits.This was nothing new.Charlie always made messes that Jack had to clean up, and now their childhood was repeating itself, but inflated to a global scale.This was the culmination of a pattern, the last step in making sure everything Jack did was ultimately meaningless.After a moment of reflection, Jack suspected that was a tad melodramatic.They didnt see one another much anymore, and whenever they did, Jack conveniently forgot he was a pacifist.There were black eyes, split lips and cracked ribs on both sides, and they finally decided that avoidance was the only sensible answer.It turned out to be a great policy, and they hadnt spoken in two years.Two wondrous, blissful years.As Jack stood by the phone, mulling over his little brother killing dissidents in Egypt, he heard the door open and all of the anger and frustration melted away.In a few long strides, he crossed the floor and intercepted Jess in the open doorway.His arms encircled her, his hands pressed into the small of her back, his head craned down and he gently pressed his mouth to her soft lips.The bag of groceries between them dropped to the floor.After a moment, he pulled away and looked into her brilliant blue eyes, but stayed so close he could feel her warm breath breaking against his upper lip.I missed you, too, he whispered.I noticed, she said with a grin.Youre naked.You said whatever Im wearing is fine.You, on the other hand, are way over dressed.He stole another kiss.And so beautiful.Before Jess could reply, Jacks arms cinched around her waist and lifted her up, then he spun her around.She filled the room with laughter, and he attacked her open mouth, hungrily kissing and nibbling at her lower lip.He lowered her back to the floor with one arm and closed the door with the other.Dinner?She asked.He ducked his head under her chin and laid one kiss and another on the tender skin of her throat, all the while inhaling her sweet honeysuckle scent.Dessert, he suggested.Then the moment was ruined.The datapad in his backpack blared out an alert, but Jack was adamant about not answering it.Just let it go, he told himself.It cant be anything important.He froze in place, savoring the feeling of her warm body against his.The second alert came and went, the third followed close behind.The fourth began, but he wouldnt let himself reconsider.Before the fifth ring came, Jess made up his mind for him.You have to answer it, she said.He reached into the pack, retrieved his pad and looked grimly at the screen.Its Priority One, he said.Whats that?Well, Ive been with the Corps for nine years, and Ive never seen anything worse than Priority Two.He flashed back to orientation and heard his instructors voice listing Priority One scenarios.Nuclear strike, nerve or chemical agent, epidemic, asteroid impact.Jack gestured at the TV and it came on, but the black screen said, No Signal.Damn storm.You should go, Jess said with two tons of regret in her voice.Nuclear strike, nerve or chemical agent, epidemic, asteroid impact, his instructor droned on.Im so sorry, Jack said.I have to go.I know.Its why I love you, Corpsman Hernandez.Youre out to save the world, and someday, youre going to.Nuclear strike, nerve or chemical agent, epidemic, asteroid impact, the old voice was now chanting.Theres something I need to ask you when I get back.Youll be here?She smiled and kissed him, and there was a tension that hadnt been there a moment before.Yes, she whispered in his ear, Ill always be here waiting for you, until the stars rain down from the sky.And he knew she would.On autopilot, Jack dressed in fresh clothes, checked his gear and flew out the door.He ran to the train station and caught the mag lev down to Vandenberg, totally oblivious to everything around him.He didnt notice everyone in the station fiddling with their malfunctioning phones, or gossiping about blank televisions.He missed the announcement that the train was being guided manually in the absence of the traffic network, and he didnt even notice that his GPS was blank.Jack didnt notice because he was thinking about that question he would ask when he got back.During the trip, he didnt once hear his instructors voice and the list of possible calamities.All he heard, over and over again, was Jess promise to wait for him, in that voice that was too sweet for words.Chapter 7:  Broken Bird  The Vandenberg airfield was in a panic the likes of which Jack had never seen before.Preflight personnel were rushing everywhere, assembling equipment at a break neck pace and prepping the massive tranzat carriers at all five gantries.Each spear like tranzat was flanked by ten of the orange leviathan helicopters, lined up in rows with their blades folded, and waiting to be loaded.The helicopters looked like nothing so much as oversized Easter eggs painted by a strangely unimaginative kid.The Priority One alert had gone out to everyone: primary squads, secondaries and reserves alike.That added up to about five thousand drop ready corpsmen lined up in rows on the tarmac, waiting to be briefed, loaded and launched.Vandenberg was Californias primary launch site.More volunteers would be arriving at secondary sites by the thousands, and the same would be happening at ERC launch facilities all over the globe.The amount of manpower in motion was staggering to consider.Jack found the SJ Bravos among the sea of orange jumpsuits without too much effort, and he fell into formation.Hey Albright, any idea whats up?Your guess is as good as mine.He scanned the group and took a mental picture.Hed never seen five thousand completely dumbfounded faces before, and he doubted he ever would again.The regional director came out a few minutes later and cleared his throat over the PA.Settle down, corpsmen, he said, and the chatter died.I know youre all wondering what the hells going on, and youre not alone.There seems to be a perfect shit storm coming down right now, and were working double time just to put the big picture together.First off, as you no doubt noticed, communication networks are down right now.All of them.This is due to some sort of broad spectrum interference thats wreaking havoc with anything wireless.We havent identified the source yet, but we believe the effect to be global.Its a small miracle that we managed to get the alert out at all.Of course, I know all you dedicated boys and girls wouldve followed regs and reported in during a communications black out, anyway.There was stifled laughter in the crowd.But thats not Priority One.The director took a moment to clear his throat.Shortly before communications were interrupted, two impacts were reported on the Asian subcontinent, one in India and the other in China.The events registered on our seismic equipment, and weve estimated the power of each to be in the five gigaton range.Jack and five thousand other corpsman cursed.We initially believed the impacts to be asteroids.However, the evidence weve pieced together points to the Helios and Hyperion solar arrays being the culprits.We have no idea why they fell out of orbit, but we can assume the destruction is simply unimaginable.Both impacts occurred in high density population centers, in fact, the most densely populated regions in the world.Considering the coincident failure of communications networks, we must assume that this constitutes some form of attack.Terrorism cannot be ruled out, although its hard to imagine a terrorist organization with the resources and coordination necessary for this type of operation.Our job, as always, is to provide humanitarian aid.Well be double and triple loading laviathans, and cluster dropping at full speed from LEO in order to get as many feet on the ground as possible.Your primary jobs will be to collect refugees and organize temporary camps, then hold tight until we can begin airlifting them to wherever the hell we can.Expect to see local military, as well as Blade and Carbon forces in the area.The director took a moment to think back through the speech, making sure he didnt leave anything out.Then he said, You know the rest.Lets get in the air.From there, it was a normal launch but with more bodies and none of the banter.The Bravos loaded into their leviathan accompanied by a reserve squad and two full pallets loaded with medical supplies, rations and light weight collapsible shelters.Everything and everyone was locked down, and then the leviathan and nine identical replicas were lifted into the tranzats cradles and locked into place.With the windows covered, the rest of the launch process always happened blind.There was the feeling of being moved in one direction and then another, the ratcheting of the launch gantry as the plane was angled upwards, and then a roar and immense pressure as the tranzat thrust itself into the sky.The roar subsided, and for the rest of the trip, they swayed and bobbed like an inflatable dolphin in a pool.This time, Leonid Nikitin was wide awake and Lisa Albrights earphones were nowhere to be found.Each of the passengers was wearing the same blank expression found in hospital waiting rooms, with eyes cast down and brows drawn together.Most were lipping something, and Jack assumed they were prayers.When he noticed his own lips were doing the same, he couldnt recall what theyd been reciting.The tranzat blasted through the upper atmosphere for an hour, and the corpsmen sat in silence waiting for the drop.Then they heard a strange howl and the cabin rocked hard to the side.Tell me thats just turbulence, Jack, Skip shouted across the isle.Several more howls rushed past the hull, and another one struck.The cabin rattled and shook.Jack could only think of one possible answer: they were under attack.Masks!He cried out, and everyone reacted instantly, grabbing their oxygen masks from the packs above and pulling them over their heads.Another howling thing struck the ship, and their leviathan lurched free of its cradle, dropping into the thin air at the upper edge of the atmosphere.No warning light this time, just the sickly feeling of plummeting like a stone, tumbling end over end.The portholes on either side of the cabin revealed the Earth, the dark sky, and the Earth again, chasing one after the other in rapid succession.The burning tranzat shrank into the distance, and the air was thick with strange shapes that Jack couldnt make out.Another series of howling rounds screamed past the hull, and one struck with a deafening crack.In response, the safety windows exploded in a rain of small pellets, and the air pressure inside the leviathan disappeared.They were falling, unguided, uncontrolled.Jack had a hunch and he had to act quickly or itd all be over.He tugged the climbing hook out from his harness, latched it to the U shaped restraint, and slammed the seats emergency release.The metal bar jerked up and away from him, but before he could fly loose in the spinning cabin, he tensed and pushed himself hard toward the cockpit door.He flew through the air while the cabin twisted around him, only to crash into his target a thump.His bones rattled and his body ached from head to toe, but he grappled at the guidebars and managed to grab hold.With a tap at his harness, the hook released and he retrieved the spring loaded arrestor cable, then latched up at his new position.His gloved hands fumbled at the door handle then pried it open with a twist, revealing the shattered cockpit beyond.He clambered through and found precisely what he feared: a destroyed windshield and two dead pilots strapped into the seats.The next few moments were a blur of motion.He released the pilots belt, pulled the limp body free and climbed in to replace him.It took him a second to focus, to blot out the spinning Earth and make sense of the instrument panel in front of him.Jack was rated a Class C leviathan pilot, and this was hardly second nature to him, but he wanted to live.He would focus and he would remember.He closed his eyes, imagined the diagrams and tried to hear his flight instructors commands.Reaching out, unsure if he was grabbing the right lever, he pushed one all the way forward and the leviathans air baffles extended.They increased drag at the top of the craft and righted it as it fell.The helicopter wasnt tumbling anymore, but the altimeter was still spinning like a buzzsaw blade, and the air speed had too many digits for Jacks taste.The speed was dropping, but not fast enough., The rotors would shear off if he tried to extend them, destroying any chance of a controlled landing.He needed to drop a lot of weight and fast.He flipped the cargo panel open and punched the door release, then looked back over his shoulder and watched the ramp lurch down.At half way open, he activated the cargo ejectors and watched the two heavy pallets tumble out into the sky, where their parachutes popped and gently lowered them to the Earth.At least theyll make it, he mumbled into his mask.With the pallets gone, the Leviathans descent slowed down to something reasonable, and Jack breathed a sigh of relief.He leaned forward and slapped the EXTEND button, but nothing happened.He slapped it again without response.A blinking light higher up the console caught his eye, and it didnt take an expert to realize what JAM meant.It meant he was screwed.Why would it be jammed?He burned through options.The cover could be damaged, or the rotor destroyed completely.There was no hope in either line of thought.No possibility of recovery, so he abandoned them.Power cables couldve been severed, but that would have a warning light.He was missing something.Then he remembered: the rotors wouldnt extend without the engines running.Jack moved the throttle and listened for an engine response, but it was impossible to hear anything over the thousand kilometer per hour winds whipping through the craft.There should be a STALL light somewhere, but he couldnt remember where, and there was no time to look for it.With the furious Earth rushing up at him, the only thing Jack could think of was the auto rotate procedure, and it would have to do.His hands flew across the controls, flipping switches that disengaged the transmission and overrode safety protocols.Paying no mind to the hundreds of lights blinking across the console, he once again reached forward and mashed the EXTEND button.The blades unfolded and began to spin.The leviathan wouldnt travel far without power, but the rotating blades would make an effective parachute, and even offer minimal steering.The only thing left to do was bring his bird down to the ground.Jack finally looked around and got his bearings, and it didnt look good.There was no trace of the other leviathans or the tranzat, and God only knew how far hed traveled before getting things under control.The air above was thick with those strange vehicles, now too distant to see clearly, while below there was only a thick dust cloud that stretched to the far horizon.The barely stable leviathan dipped down into the dust cloud, and once inside, vicious winds tore at it from every direction.Jack held onto the controls tightly, and as he dropped into the darkness, he prayed that hed seen the worst of this day.Chapter 8:  Jonah and the Great Fish  Rumours spread through the Shackleton like a plague, and the crew were up to speed within an hour.They had found an alien vessel.What followed was overwhelming excitement and fifty six astronauts trying against all odds to squeeze into an eight man bridge compartment.Still, the Shackleton did nothing the first day but survey, traveling up and down the length of Zebra One like a mosquito buzzing around a buffalo, scanning, observing and recording every strange feature of the artifacts surface.Each new discovery elicited bursts of conjecture and heated debate.Faulkland eventually banished the crowd from the bridge, but they wouldnt be deterred.Instead, the lot of them crammed into the maximum occupancy twelve dining hall where they monitored progress by CC TV and somehow managed not to suffocate.It was a long day mapping Zebra Ones surface, and at its end, Marcus didnt sleep at all, nor did he bother trying.He knew from experience that he would have lain awake, running every possibility and contingency through his head.Commander Faulkland claimed that he could sleep at will anywhere in the universe, but he spent the whole night on the bridge with Marcus, staring in perfect silence at the sleeping giant just outside their window.Meanwhile, Mason Shen sat off to the side and tried to solve the communication puzzle.When morning hours rolled around, he was still at his console and no closer to an answer.He was in contact with Ares Colony on Mars, but Earth remained morbidly silent for them as well.Im about ready to give up, Mason said around 0800.Marcus was still staring at Zebra One, now with dry and sore eyes.He asked the obvious question.Still no luck, Mason?I wouldnt say none, Mason replied.Ive been chatting with this Martian comm operator, and she sounds pretty cute.Earth, though Boss, if I didnt know better, Id think everybody just packed up and moved away.Theres nothing.Marcus felt like that should bother him more, but he was so far away that it didnt matter.No worries.Im sure theres a simple answer.Yeah, was all Mason said, his voice lacking enthusiasm.Have there been any signals from Zebra One?Marcus asked, switching back to the important topic.Not a peep, sir.Ive been cycling greetings in every language I know and some I dont, but shes just as quiet as the Earth.If shes awake, she aint talking.Just as well, Faulkland said.Itd be a little anti climactic if she called us back.By 0915, two teams of eight were assembled, briefed and ready to get on with the show.Marcus team included himself, Commander Faulkland, Dr.St.Martin, and a handful of the eager miners.The second team was Raos, and included Crew Chief Hector Pacheco, the paleontologist Professor Caldwell, and their own team of miners.As much as Marcus pretended there was some deep strategy to the team rosters, they were actually divvied up based on personality.He knew who got on well with whom, and he preferred his teams not be at each others throats until after a mission started.Like Marcus, hardly anyone slept the night before, and they were running on a mixture of high octane coffee and lipid bars.Combining stimulants and sleep deprivation never added up to a level head, and Marcus had a sneaking suspicion that most exploration had begun in a similar fashion.It would explain why so few natives survived first contact.He was about to say a prayer for whatever natives they might encounter, when he realized his own people were completely unarmed.The tone of his prayer changed very quickly.With the Shackleton stationed fifty meters from Iris Charlie, the exploratory teams entered the EVA module, which housed a dressing room and airlock.The pressure suits were skin tight, as close as a human could get to naked in space, and the only clothes worn beneath were thin thermals that left little to the imagination.It took the team less than ten minutes to suit up.Then, with everyone helmeted, sealed, checked and double checked, they entered the airlock.The heavy door closed behind them and the lights switched from green to red: depressurization was under way.At the same time, a digital gauge on the wall began to tick down from 101 kilopascals.The process was never speedy, but with history awaiting them on the other side, it was glacially slow.When the gauge read zero, the round outer door popped inward, rolled to the side and revealed the vast iridescent wall of Zebra One, so large that Marcus was struck by vertigo as if he were hanging fifty meters above the ground.His discomfort must have been apparent because he felt a hand on his shoulder, and heard Faulklands voice in his ear.Everything alright, Doctor Donovan?Fine, he said as he regained his composure.Just havent gone EVA in a while.That wasnt true.Donovan to Base, were exiting the bay now.Roger that, Donovan.Good luck.The pressure suit read his body language and engaged its cold jets, thrusting him out away from the Shackleton.The other astronauts followed and together they slowly drifted out of the chamber and into the void, while one of the ships life rafts automatically detached and moved to intercept them.Once they were all hooked up to the raft, its own engines lit up and carried them over the last leg of the journey.As he approached, Marcus formed different theories about the ships surface.Hed long believed it to be some sort of metal, but at fifty meters, he started to entertain the idea of a metamorphic silicate shell.Ten meters after that, the translucency became more pronounced like quartz.Yet another ten meters on, he began to notice patterns swirling within the surface, like viscous fluid in a clear casing.In the final stretch, he finally admitted that he had no damn idea what it was.The life raft came to a halt just a short distance from Zebra Ones hull, and Marcus couldnt unhook himself fast enough.While the rest of the team were still detaching their umbilical cables, he was free and floating towards her.Finally, after all those long years, he was there beside her.He knew it was reckless, but it didnt matter.He had to touch her.The color of the wall shifted as he approached, so slightly he thought it was just his imagination.The surface was flawless, without seams, panels, scratches or any other imperfection.During the survey, his team had detected geometric surface patternsgrooves and protrusions bothbut on a large scale separated by hundreds of meters.They assumed theyd find similar patterns on the small scale, but there were no such details, no signs of anything mechanical nor any hint of the artifacts manufacture.For as far as Marcus could see, it was simply a wall of clear glass with subtly swirling colors trapped beneath.His thrusters brought him to a graceful stop mere inches away from her, and he reached out.Without any jitter or hesitation, his hand rose up with his fingers spread, and he touched the unimaginably large creature in front of him, the way a diver might dare to touch a passing whale.Nothing happened.He wasnt sure what he expected.He didnt know if his hand would sink in or be repelled, or if she might crumble at his touch like a mummy rashly exposed to fresh air.He half expected to wake up back home in bed, covered in sweat, with only a vague recollection of his strange adventure.Instead, there was no response other than the feeling of his gloved hand against something solid.And with that, he was satisfied.Hows she feel, Marc?Raos voice crackled over the radio.Real, he said.He looked at the wall directly in front of his face, and now he was sure it had changed.On their approach, Zebra One had been the same dull yellow green shed been throughout the previous days survey.Now, the wall in front of him had become a vibrant, living green.It was the green of fertile hills after springs first rain.And there was something else.The color of the wall is changing, Doctor, Faulkland said.Yeah, think youre right, Marcus replied, while something even stranger had caught his attention.Around his hand, there was a flickering pattern that branched out from his finger tips.He waved the hand back and forth, and the pattern followed, pulsing and waving, slowly growing in strength.It reminded him of the chintzy plasma globe he used to keep on his desk.Now thats interesting.What?Rao asked.Im not sure.Galvanic skin response maybe.One way or another, shes reacting to me.The rest of the crew were finally unhooked from the life raft, and Rao came up beside him.As he approached, the rich green colored area expanded to surround him as well.He reached out his hand toward the wall and lightning like patterns appeared around his fingers, their ends disappearing into the mysterious depths of the alien material.Surface temperature is rising, Juliette St.Martin said with a little worry in her voice.Marcus turned to look over his shoulder, and found her behind him with a multifunction probe in her hand.The pen like piece of metal was attached to her wrist by a thin cable, through which it transmitted information to her heads up display.Rising?How quickly?Marcus asked.Youre not going to be barbecued anytime soon, if thats what youre wondering.In fact, its leveling off now at thirty six degrees centigrade.Human body temperature, Marcus said.He thrust backwards and watched the color of the artifact fade to dull green grey again, while the vibrant circle around Rao persisted.He stopped only a few meters away.Ideas?His question was met with silence.Alright then.Donovan to Base, still reading us?Crystal clear, Doctor.Were receiving mission data from all units.Good.Were proceeding to the iris.Roger.Well be watching.The structure dubbed Iris Charlie was one of the smaller irises; all of them were identical in shape, but differed in scale.They were elliptical, and this one measured twelve meters by a little over seven.Its dome protruded out from the smooth surface by four and a half meters.These features, just as every part of Zebra One measured so far, related to each other by the golden ratio.As they moved toward the iris, the finer details became apparent.There was a convex ring surrounding it which was broken into five equal sections, each covered in a tiled pattern of overlapping scales.Marcus couldnt decide if the pattern was biological or mechanical, of if such a distinction would even make sense to the race that manufactured it.The iris itself was the same color as the wall and was just as smooth.It was so smooth, in fact, that it might as well have been a bubbling liquid frozen in place.The team came to a stop in front of the iris and waited.Marcus was studying the bubble, looking for any clue to its purpose, and it occurred to him after a moment that everyone else was waiting for his move.Rao broke the silence.Well?I dont know, Marcus said.Should I say open sesame?He was hugely glad the door remained closed.Hed already had plenty of strange, alien and amazing; he wasnt in any mood for ridiculous to join the party.Options started running through his head, and before he noticed, he was brainstorming out loud.If its a door, thered be some way to open it.A handle, a button, maybe a remote control we dont have.If its an eye, its watching us right now.Not much of a show, Im afraid.I guess it could accommodate some internal equipment that needed the extra space, but when the damned ship is already most of a kilometer wide, I cant imagine another four meters making much of a difference.Maybe, Hector Pacheco said, breaking Marcus rambling stream of consciousness, you should try knocking.As usual, the grizzled crew chief had managed to be serious and joking at the same time.It was a fine talent, and one of many that Marcus envied.Fighting against the stiff shoulders of his pressure suit, Marcus Donovan shrugged, then maneuvered toward the iris.He raised his hand and curled his fingers, then reached out to rap on the surface.Just as his knuckle was about to collide with the iris, the glossy material shrank away from his hand and raced toward the edges, like hot wax poured over glass or a soap bubble popping in slow motion.Inky darkness waited inside.Marcus was glad no one could see the look on his face.Or maybe its automatic, like bloody near every door on our entire planet.Should we go in?he asked.Before anyone could answer, the decision was made for them.The doctor and his fifteen companions were all drawn into the cavity at once, and the force that attracted them was accompanied by an oddly familiar feeling.It was the feeling of falling.They were falling into the ship.I hope this isnt their idea of hospitality, Hector said in his gravelly voice.Professor Caldwell, the geologist, replied, Never mind that.I just hope this isnt how it eats.Then the iris shut behind them and all was dark.Chapter 9:  All In  It was pitch black inside, and the first thing Marcus Donovan noticed was something thumping all around him.One two, it beat slowly, rhythmically, like he was trapped inside a massive water drum.He could feel it thumping in his chest, where his heart echoed the beat.One two, one two.Base to Donovan, whats your status?Please respond.Were alright.Just a little disoriented.Lets get some lights on, he said, and their pale blue head lamps flicked on, illuminating helmets and precious little beyond.The lamps were only on a moment before the walls all around began to glow.They were dim and red orange at first like a finger in front of a flashlight, then gradually brighter until the light settled into the warm amber of autumn at sunset.Was that in response to the words or the lamps?Faulkland asked.Or something else?Marcus added.Before he could invest himself in that question, he noticed another puzzling thing.They were in a long corridor with glowing walls, broken into equal segments by an interconnected lattice work of curving, molded columns that might have been structural supports.The puzzling part was that Marcus and his team were sitting on the floor.Rao looked to be mulling over the same thought.He detached the lamp from his helmet, held it out at arms length and let go.The lamp fell down with a clatter.Marcus mind raced.Maybe there was a simple answer he couldnt see from his perspective.Mason, he said into his microphone, Zebra One didnt start I dont know spinning, did she?No, sir.Im looking at her right now, and shes as still as a stone.Artificial gravity, Rao said in a reverent voice.He sounded like he was whispering the secret name of God.How?Marcus asked.If I knew that, I assure you I wouldnt be here right now.Id be sitting on a solid gold toilet, sipping cocktails and counting the decimal places on my bank statement.Always with the gold toilet, Marcus said as he climbed to his feet.It felt just like Earth gravity, and after five months of simulated half gravity in the Shackletons habitation pods, that was too heavy for his taste.His legs felt weak and unsteady, and he thought he might collapse at any moment.Then he grew lighter until it was just right.Get some environmental readings, Juliette.She stepped up beside him and drew out her probe again.Atmospheric pressure at a hundred and one kilopascals, temperature steady at thirty two degrees centigrade.Ill have spectrograph results in a minute.Shes bending over backwards to make us comfortable, Faulkland said.Ill bite.Marcus turned just in time to see the ships commander crack his neck seal and lift the helmet from his head.He blew out and took one hesitant whiff, then began to breathe normally.With a smile, he lipped something Marcus couldnt hear and gave a thumbs up.You reckless son of a bitch, Marcus said, well aware that Faulkland couldnt hear a word he said.Not to be outdone, he unlocked his own helmet and did the same.The air that rushed in was warm and moist, and when he took his first sniff, he detected a faint hint of something metallic.It smelled of fresh blood.Commander Faulkland flagged him down after hed had a chance to take a few breaths.I said it smells kind of funky, but its not bad.Marcus inhaled deep and filled his lungs.He was already growing used to the smell.Not bad, he agreed.A little oxygen rich, but not bad.My freshman dorm smelled worse.He looked at Juliette through her clear mask, and wasnt surprised at the furious face she was making.Itd been years since hed seen that expression.She said something, and he didnt need to hear the words to appreciate the message.Marcus plucked the headset from inside his helmet and hooked it over his ear.Should I be glad I missed that, Doctor St.Martin?Nothing I havent called you before.Damn it, Marc I havent even tested for microbiology yet.When you do, Ive got a hunch itll turn up positive.Draw up a quarantine procedure when you get a chance.Done.Im also going to check you two every ten minutes, whether you like it or not.Marcus groaned.Understood.Everybody else, keep your lids on until further notice.At least we know this stuffs breathable if we have an emergency.He glanced around, and decided that this spot looked as good as any.Lets set up base camp here, he said, and the team began unpacking their equipment.You put a good spin on that, Faulkland said to him after a moment.He was affixing his own headset.Marcus unloaded the mission transponder from his back and set it down.Thanks.Youve got me wondering, though how the hell have you survived this long?The commander chuckled.I steer boats, Doctor.This walking around alien spaceships business is new to me.Whats your excuse?Im competitive and prone to fits of idiocy, he said, and they both laughed.Just do me a favor.Gimme a heads up next time you plan on doing something stupid.Faulkland snapped a salute.Aye aye, sir.Juliette finished assembling her med station and walked over to the two men with her probe firmly in hand.Do either of you feel different?Warm, short of breath, light headed?No, no, and no, Marcus said.Faulkland said, Ditto..She waved the probe in front of Marcus face, and used the light to test his pupil response, then did the same to Faulkland.The first sign of anything strange, and I mean anything, you will tell me.No more cowboy shit, understood?Yes maam, they both replied.Satisfied, she returned to the small foldable medical station and started looking over the results.The pressure suit helmets werent designed to be carried, so Marcus removed the lamp from his, and set the bulky thing down next to the transponder.Faulkland did the same.So, what kind of emergencies did you have in mind?Faulkland asked.Marcus shrugged.Beats me, but as far as Im concerned, were out among the many moons of Mongo now, and I wont pretend I know whats ahead of us.Then a thought occurred to him.He glanced left then right down identical corridors stretching into the distance.Hows this for starters, though whered the iris go?Faulkland took a long look around.Good question.Damn good question.Yeah.I thought so.Marcus ran through some possibilities, but the word possibility was quickly taking on new meanings.He needed more information.Donovan to Base.Be a pal and tell me where the mission transponder is located right now.One moment Showing right on the other side of the iris, Doc.Marcus took that as good news.It meant the doorway was still there but hidden.This was much better than finding out hed been mysteriously shuttled to some distant part of the ship.Unless Zebra One was falsifying sensor information.Best not to consider that, he told himself.That line of thought could only lead to madness.He decided to worry about the missing door some other time, and turned back to his work.The base camp was assembled, the teams were itching to get started, and he was burning to know what was around the next corner.Time had come to start exploring.Alright, theres no time like the present.My team will head aftward.Rao, take yours toward the bow.Keep the channel open and plan to meet back here in four hours.With that, the two teams parted, each marching off in their given direction.Chapter 10:  Are You Alive?Hey, are you alive?Jack Hernandez wasnt sure about the answer.He didnt know where he was or who was talking to him.His mouth tasted like blood, his body hurt all over, and the last thing he wanted to do was open his eyes.He felt fingers on his throat, and he thought someone might be checking his pulse.Come on Wake up, hero.We gotta go.He pried his eyes open and saw nothing but bright light.His ears were buzzing, his head was a giant pile of hurt, and he wanted to throw up.What was on his face?Some kind of mask.He reached up and tried to take it off, but hands grabbed his wrists and stopped him.You dont want to do that.Trust me.Hey Nik, hes coming around.Can you gimme a hand over here.The wind was howling like Jack had never heard before.The Earth was angry.Hands are full.Can he stand?Dont think so.His eyes began to focus, and he could make out the shape of someone standing over him.The person was decked out in Corps gear, and their face was covered in a bulky combo oxygen/gas mask.The corpsman looked like some kind of human insect hybrid.Jack tried to read the name tag, but the words were floating around, splitting apart and rejoining.Albright?he asked.Yup, she said, hovering over him.She shined a light through his goggles, in one eye and then the other.Looks like youre concussed, but not too bad.You could be a lot worse off after a landing like that.Little by little, his vision was getting sharper, but the scene wasnt right.It was like trying to make sense of a kids drawing.After a couple breaths, the shapes started to coalesce, and he recognized that he was in the ruined cockpit of a leviathan.The angles were still weird, though.He finally decided that the vehicle was on its side.He could hear something outside roaming in big circles.It sounded like a clothes washer on the spin cycle.What the hells going on?Jack asked, his own voice sounding muffled.The inside of his mask was slick and a little sticky.No time right now.Im gonna unbuckle your seat belt, and youre going to fall.I need you to be ready.Are you ready, Jack?He nodded as firmly as he could, then he heard the click of the harness and he dropped to the floor.It wasnt a very big drop, and he managed to get his arms crossed in front of him, but he still managed to land partially on his head.There was a strange tugging sensation around his midsection.He thought it might be the seat belt, but he discovered that it was his arrestor cable, its hook still attached to a guidebar in the doorway.His hand found the release button, the cable snaked back into its housing, and the unpleasant pressure was gone.Lisa Albright took Jacks hand and started pulling him upward.I know it hurts, but we cant stay here.Whatevers out there is getting closer and I dont want to be here when it shows up.Can you stand?With Lisas help, Jack climbed to his feet shakily.It felt like he was lifting a cement truck on his back.Yeah.Im fine, he said.He wasnt fine.When he was half way up, Albright pulled his arm over her shoulders and together they shambled back into the cargo hold.The room was lit from two gaping holes lined with torn and shredded steel, and the raging dust storm could be glimpsed outside.Lifeless bodies in metal restraints lined the walls, beaten and bloodied exhibits in a museum of death.Seven seats were empty, and five corpsmen were standing near the open ramp at the far end.Jack was in a haze.He was lost in a bad dream.None of this was real, a shaky voice in his head claimed.He recognized Leonid Nikitin, the lighthouse, standing above everyone else with an extra service pack slung over each shoulder.The rest were mysteries; orange jumpsuits and gas masks with unknown occupants.Everyone was loaded with as much equipment as they could carry.You find anything other than that sad sack o shit?Nikitin asked, pointing at Jack.Flare gun and a couple rounds.I raided the first aid kit, too.Some extra bandages, iodine, morphine, mixed auto injectors.Not a bad haul.The flying clothes washers pattern was tightening, getting closer, louder.Were out of time.Lets move, Nikitin shouted.The four unknown corpsmen didnt need to be told twice; they all wanted out of the charnel house.They clambered through the cargo door under cover of the half destroyed ramp.Meanwhile, Nikitin took two long strides over to Jack and grabbed the arm that Lisa had over her shoulders.Ive got him.Go keep the rabble together.Five foot Lisa Albright nodded her head and trotted off ahead.Now with the great Ukrainian holding him up, Jack felt like a little kid and he was glad for it.Even with his strength coming back, he wasnt ready to walk on his own.Nikitin wasnt gentle, but he was strong enough to carry an ox if he wanted to, and the two made good time catching up with the others.The world outside the leviathan was more unsettling than the inside.Whirling dust and rocks painted the air a ruddy beige, hiding the blasted landscape beyond.What could be seen was utterly destroyed; a churned up mixture of raw earth and debris, like an endless compost heap.With Albright leading, the squad moved quickly over broken ground and took cover in a jagged ravine, where the upturned roots of a fallen tree provided some meager shelter.Jack was glad to be back off his feet, if only for a moment.Something was getting closer.All around them, the oscillating sound of the clothes washer drowned out every other noise, even the bitter howling of the wind.In another second, a silhouette descended through the maelstrom, and the source of the noise was revealed.The strange thing emerged from the fog and hovered above the wrecked helicopter.It was shaped like half a tear drop, with its flat side facing the ground.The body was circled by a single undulating fin that moved in time with the sound, like some perverse, airborne imitation of a cuttlefish.The rest of the thing was covered in sharp edges, bony outcroppings and stalactites, except at its tail where there was a series of overlapping panels resembling silvery gills.It floated to one side and then the other.Nikitin, holding a pair of binoculars up to his mask, leaned over toward Jack and said, Its inspecting the kill.Short arms on gimbals extended from either side of it, then angled down toward the leviathan.All of the corpsmen made educated guesses about what would happen next and covered their ears.Each of the arms flared and then fired a bright cyan round that screamed into the fallen helicopter, and on impact exploded in a shower of blinding sparks.There followed a groan like steel girders sheering under too much weight, and nothing remained but a smoking puddle of glowing slag.The floating cuttlefish lifted back up and disappeared into the whirling dust, apparently satisfied with its work.It was a long time before anyone spoke.They sat there in the ravine, catching their breath, licking their wounds and looking through their gear.It was busy work, the kind people do when they dont want to think.The previous two hours were a lot to take in, even for corpsmen who face catastrophes for a living.Nikitin finally something after twenty long minutes.Thing I cant figure out, he said, with everyone turning to listen, is how to smoke a cigar with this stupid mask on.Albright shook her head, but the rest let themselves laugh a little.That included Jack, who wouldve preferred not to, thanks to his aching head.He consoled himself with the discovery that he didnt have any cracked ribs, even if the rest of his body was thoroughly tenderized and sore.
