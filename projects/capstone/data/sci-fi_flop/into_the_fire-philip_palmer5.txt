..Promise.But that damn place was so big, so damn formidable, even if I did somehow manage to get in there, it might take a day of searching to find her.I needed information on the layout, to know where she was most likely to be...Then again, who was I kidding?I needed a damn sight more than that.I needed a miracle to get me in there, and then something even bigger to get the two of us back out again.Into the Fire        TEN I tried, but there was no way could I sleep without Lena next to me, though in terms of my thoughts, she never left my side all night.Jimmy kept telling me I had to stay calm, to think before I acted, cuz my impulse was to just get hold of the biggest weapons I could and blast my way into that place.It wasnt exactly the best plan anyoned ever come up with, but it sure as hell didnt stop me wanting to do it.I had this real empty ache inside that wouldnt let go for a moment; like someoned ripped out my heart and all my other vital organs as well.What Id said to the others was true: I didnt want to live without Lena, Id done it for more than sixty years and believe me, I knew just how damn pointless it was.If she was gone forever, then I needed to know so I could do something about it.And yet, in the odd few moments when I did manage to calm downwhen I tried to take Jimmys advice and think things throughit occurred to me that maybe, just maybe, there was just the tiniest glimmer of hope.They had to have taken her for a reason, not just to kill her, and hopefully that meant that for the moment at least, she was safe.On the other hand, how long would that last?If it was information they were after, then they might torture herand that was one helluva disturbing prospect.But what the hell could she know?What information could she have that Infinity wanted?And really, that was the crux of it, the question I kept asking myself a hundred times an hour: why had they taken her?Later that day I went out with Gordie.There was a permanent need for food, which made it a good excuse to go somewhere, but actually, I didnt need one.I think the others all sensed not only my pain, but also my helplessness too.I didnt know what to do, and didnt want to be questioned about it either.I thought about going down to the Infinity building again, taking another look, but even in the depths of my despair I knew that wouldnt make a great deal of sense: being seen hanging around, acting suspiciously, would blow any tiny chance I might have had of getting into that place.And anyway, I still didnt know for certain she was in there.So instead, we just wandered the City, blindly hoping that we might see or hear something that would help us understand what had gone on.There werent as many fires as there had been, though the smoke didnt appear to have thinned at all.It felt like it had permeated everywhere and everything.We couldnt go anywhere without smelling that odd acrid stench Lena had complained about.I guess that went for us, too, if we couldve smelled ourselves: we were probably just as smoked as any smokehouse ham or herring.Gordie and me hadnt exactly been deep in conversationin fact, I was so lost in my thoughts, wed exchanged barely a word.It wasnt til he started complaining that I realized just how hard Id been pushing us on.Clancy!Im tiredwe cant cover the whole city, he whined.It took a moment for me to absorb what hed said, to appreciate that he had a point, and also to grasp that Id led us somewhere I didnt recognize at all.Where the hell are we?I muttered.The suns that way, he replied.Like everyone who lived on the Island he was pretty good at working out that kind of thing.So...down there, I said, pointing left at an upcoming junction, though I wasnt anywhere near as confident as I was making out.It wasnt an area I knew at all, and we hadnt gone that far before I began to wish I couldve kept it that way.They wouldve had to have spent an awful lot of dough on it to convert it into a slum, and worse stillmaybe cuz it was an underprivileged areathere were a lot of those zombie sick around, slumped in doorways, reclining on stoops, draped out of windows, all as pale and lifeless as the moon.And just like when wed been down on the beach, they started to take a real close interest in us, particularly Gordie.Shit!I muttered, noticing we were collecting a following.What do they want?Gordie asked, looking nervously over his shoulder.Suck my blood?Funny thing was, it mightve been an attempt at humor, a little bravado, but I could almost believe it.They looked so weak and drained I could imagine a glass of Gordie and tonic doing them a power of good.Not that I said as much to him.I hesitated for a moment, considering turning back, but now there were more behind than in front.Lets cross over, I said, seeing it was quieter on the other side.They all followed, starting to crowd in and surround us, with even more appearing, stumbling out of houses, rising up out of basements.I mean, a few of them, no problem, they were so weak you could just push them aside, but thirty or forty was another matter...This one old man made a clumsy grab for Gordie, trying to get hold of him, but the little guy sidestepped him easily.No, thank you, he said, trying to make it sound like he was well in control, but I could hear fear starting to whittle away at his voice.The old man reached out again but this time I pushed between them, putting my arm on Gordies shoulder and leading him away.It wasnt so much of a problem when we were out in front of themwe were much quicker and could easily outpace thembut the more that appeared, the more the excitement grew, and they started calling to others to come out, too.It felt like we were slowly being swallowed up by a sea of wailing white faces with smudged inky thumbprints for eyes.Get outta the way, I growled, shoving a little knot of them aside.Even then, despite their number, I thought wed be okaybut then there was a shout and I looked around to see this guy emerging from an apartment block with a machete.I guess old habits die hard even if youre sick.There was this immediate scramble away from him and people started looking up into the sky, obviously expecting instantaneous punishment to rain down, but thanks to Jimmy, there was nothing.Lets go, I muttered to Gordie, wanting to take advantage of their momentary lapse in attention.I mean, I had no idea how much danger we were in, but I didnt intend to hang around and find out either.The guy with the machete started after us, people moving out of his way as he swept it in this slightly feeble arc.He was shouting at others to stop us and some tried, tugging at our arms and grabbing at our clothing.I snarled at them, told them to leave us alone.The machete guy mightve been making heavy work of it, but he was starting to gain on us, mainly cuz people were getting out of his way but not ours.I tell ya, it felt as if wed blundered into a street party for the living dead, only there seemed to be some misunderstanding about what was on the menu.Gordies face was almost as pale as those around us and he was keeping as close to me as he couldand yet, I still didnt think there was any real reason to fear them; they were as weak as kittens, and I could already see our crazed pursuer was starting to tire.I barged more people out of the way, shoving and pushing harder and harder until we finally broke free.I checked behind us to see the guy with the machete had stopped and was draped over a hydrant looking as if hed just run a marathon.And you wanna know something?That mean, scary machete wielding punk whod looked like hed wanted to cut and dice us both, started to cry like a lost child.Dyou see that?Gordie sniggered, suddenly full of himself again.This whole citys one giant damn asylum, I muttered as I led him away.Once we got back on track, we began to make a slow sweep in the direction of the Square.I dont know what I thought I was achievingguess I was just trying to pretend I wasnt helpless, or maybe I was reverting to old habits, stratagems thatd served me well in the past.Back when I was working for Mr.Meltoni, if I thought there was information being held from me, Id walk the streets til I found out what it wasforget about your limos, you gotta get out with the people.I remember him insisting I took his wifes dog with meMitzi, this little Yorkshire terrier with a pink bow in her hair, can you believe that?A big guy like me with that fancy furry flea.He said it made me look less threatening, less conspicuous.Well, threateninghe mightve had a point about that.But conspicuous?I never stood out more in my life.People didnt want to talk to me cuz they were too embarrassed, or laughing too damn hard to pass on any information.Wed been making our way along the main road for a while when Gordie pointed down a side street, reminding me of the other reason we were walking the City: food.There was this market that had just finished for the day and everything that hadnt been sold was being thrown away (I never did get that: in a city where half the population was starving, the other half were still chucking stuff away.).Grab those crates, I told him, starting to gather up as much as I could, knowing it wouldnt be long before others spotted it.Gordie lugged over a couple of empty apple boxes and I began to fill them rapidly with whatever I could.Not carrots!Gordie whined.Youd rather starve?Any time.That can be arranged, I told him.If I gotta eat green stuff, at least make it fruit.I sighed and ignored him, stuffing whatever looked freshest into the boxes.Id filled one for me and was halfway through his when I straightened up to rest my aching back and glanced up the street.I saw this big black limo appearing out of the smoke.Jesus!I gasped, grabbing Gordie and forcing him to duck down behind a pile of broken crates.Who is it?he asked.Someone Id rather not see.The car crept slowly by, windows down, music playing; the passengers head swiveling left and right, as if scouring the streets for someone.They look mean, Gordie whispered.Specially the big one.Stay down, I told him, my hand heavy on his shoulder.I waited til they were some way down the street and had started to disappear into the smoke, then slowly stood up.It was Van and his sidekick, and it mightve been just coincidencethey couldve been looking for anyonebut I wouldnt have minded betting it was me.Ray was probably pissed off at how that job had worked out, the guy ending up dead.Jeez, with everything else that had been going on, it was the last thing I needed.Lets go, I said to Gordie.We picked up the boxes and I led him away, hugging the storefronts, ready to duck into a doorway at any moment if the limo returned.I saw one other odd thing on our way back to the churchyard.The fire across the street had died right down at last, leaving a few jagged sections of slowly cooling walls, and someone had sprayed graffiti on one of themnot that theres anything unusual about that, theres always been graffiti all over the City, but the words kind of gave me a jolt.THERES NONE SO BLIND AS THOSE WHO WILL NOT SEE  Why I thought that meant anything, I dont know.I guess, the way things were, I just couldnt resist.It was the only graffiti in the street and someone had picked out that particular wall, right opposite us, to spray it.Weird, I commented, resting my crate of vegetables for a moment.Gordie grunted, puzzled by my reaction Why?he asked.Dont you think its strange?He looked for a moment, then gave his highly unimpressed shrug.Nope, he replied, and turned and headed into the churchyard.I stood there for a few seconds, then picked up my own crate and followed him.He was probably right; my tortured old imagination was starting to run away with me again.Everyone was pretty impressed with the amount of fresh food wed brought back.Even Jimmy momentarily stopped working to give an appreciative little whistle.Hed been fiddling with that screen for days, trying to use those parts hed brought back to make it untraceable so we could watch what was going on.One look at his frustrated expression was enough to tell me he still hadnt cracked it.No luck?I asked.Its not a case of luck, Big Guy, he said, somewhat put out by my terminology.If that was all it was, anyone could do it.Dont know why youre bothering, Delilah grumbled.Theyll only tell you what they want you to know.The little guy never commented; partly I guess cuz he knew she had a point, but also cuz of how down she still was about Arturoand now Lena, and he knew he had to tread lightly.Delilah, as if reacting to his concern, started to hum tunelessly to herself as if to make it clear that no one needed to worry about her.Later, after wed eaten and Gordie and Hanna had argued endlessly about whether or not people were meant to consume fruit and vegetables, I went back up top.It was getting late, but that graffiti was still on my mind and I wanted to take another look before it got dark.THERES NONE SO BLIND AS THOSE WHO WILL NOT SEE  It was just a scrawl, hastily writtenas if whoever had done it wanted to get away as quickly as possible.Why on earth did I think there was any connection with Lena?cuz of the use of the word blind, maybe?But she wasnt blind anymore, leastways, not as far as I knew.I sighed, checked up and down the street that no one was watching me and where I was going, then crossed back over and entered the churchyard.Clearly I was searching for answers in places where there were none.I mean, what wouldnt she want to see?Her captors?What they were trying to make her say or do?That didnt make any senseand most senseless of all: if it was about Lena, who couldve written it?The following day I lost it altogether.I missed Lena so muchthere was a terrible ache where she shouldve been.Ive told you before, Id give my life for hers anytime.If someone had told me then and there how to do it, I wouldve been happy to.But it was the not knowing that was killing me, and the longer it went on, the more my mind played tricks on me.Every time I went out I thought I saw her, even chasing after people sometimes, calling her name, frightening them and embarrassing myself.I had all sorts of stupid thoughts going through my head, including that maybe she hadnt been kidnapped at allshed run away.I was out skulking around, as the others called it, talking to people, asking if theyd seen her, when I spotted someone who looked just like her entering a looted department store.I mean, yeah, it was smoky and this woman was on the far side of the street, but the way she was dressed, the way she movedI couldve sworn it was Lena.I rushed over, entering through the same smashed window she had, trying to pick her out from the scavengers, but shed disappeared.I scoured the entire floor and still hadnt found her, so I made my way over to the escalator.I went up level by level, searching all around, but still there was no sign.When I reached the top, my frustration got the better of me and I went and hung over the rail.Lena!Lena!I cried, my voice sounding all empty and strained, but still there was nothing.I turned and started to make my way back down, this time searching each floor more thoroughly, even checking the restroomsI mean, in my heart I guess I knew it wasnt her, but I still had to be sure.I was descending to the third floor when I came across this commotion: a couple of Infinity Specials were struggling with the woman Id been looking for, and you know, with her back to me, it still couldve been Lena.I gave this cry of outrage, but when the three of them stopped and turned, when I got a better look, I could see how wrong Id been, that actually, she was older and shorter; in fact, there was barely any likeness to Lena at all.She was trying to keep hold of this dusty overcoat she mustve picked up while the two Specials were attempting to snatch it away from her.They were a pair of big muscle heads, dressed in laser reflective gear, black gloves, helmets and dark glasses, and I guess they reckoned fear alone shouldve been enough to subdue her.It was a strange kinda coincidence that the person Id mistaken for Lena was being mistreated by the very organization I suspected of kidnapping hertoo much so for a man in my state.Suddenly I wanted to defend that woman as much as anyone in my life, and I leapt down the last few steps of the escalator, shouting at them like a maniac.The woman gave out with this awful animal like yelping; in fact, I reckon she mightve been a little crazy herself.The few people around immediately scattered, not wanting to get involved in anything that involved violence and Specials, but it was me who was completely out of control.What dya want, old fuck?one of the Infinity men snarled.Okay, so I know Id become touchy about my age, but thats never been a good conversation opener with me.Leave her alone, I told them.He looked around as if checking to see if anyone was watching.Look, we got enough nut jobs to deal with.Just get the fuck out of here, will you?He turned back to the woman and angrily wrenched the coat out of her hands as if determined to get this over with.She wailed all the louder and I shouted again, Leave her alone!The same guy turned back to me and sighed, like he didnt want to do this but Id given him no choice.Some of you old fucks just dont want to go on living, do you?He was quicktoo quick for a man of my agebut luckily for me, he wasnt that accurate.He hit me with his clenched fist and though it was only a glancing blow, an awful tingling resonated through me.He was wearing shock gloves.But you know, no matter how young and fit they were, or well equipped, it wasnt a fair contest cuz they didnt have one ounce of my rage or frustration.I just leapt at them, in such a fury, growling like a bear, throwing punches left and right, immediately knocking one down and then kicking him for good measure.I turned to the other as he was going for his laser, making a grab for it myself til the two of us, wrenching it back and forth, somehow managed to break it.I took a swing at him, but hadnt noticed the guy on the floor getting back up.The next thing I knew, I was flat on my back, twitching and shaking, feeling that electricity zipping through me.He hit me again, on the left side this time, just on the bottom rib.I cant tell you how painful those damn things are, each new blow, each new electric shock, slicing you into a trillion pieces.The only drawback with shock gloves is that they have to be recharged.It only takes a moment or two, but for that brief period, whoevers using thems disarmed.He pulled away from me, I guess thinking his partner would have me covered with his laser, and Id just about got to my feet as his gloves gave off that shrill charged sound and I caught him on the cheek as he went to turn, knocking him to the floor.From then on there was no stopping me.I was like an old familiar beast bursting free of his chains; any hope I had of doing the sensible thing was gone.All the loathing I had for this organization finally had an outlet.I jumped on the guy and jerked his head back, wrenched off one of his gloves and stuffed it into his mouth.Then I put on the other glove so I was insulated and rammed his jaws shut, triggering the electric charge.He screamed and went all limp, and when he started to come around, I did it again, and again, each time his screams getting weaker.I maintained my grip til I was certain he was dead, then turned to deal with the other guy.He was up on his feet, but backing away, making for the escalator.Im not sure I wouldve caught him, but as luck would have it, he was in such a state of panic that he cannoned into the woman as she was also making for the escalator, the coat bundled up in her arms.I grabbed him and as the woman took the opportunity to scamper away, I dragged him to a nearby office.I didnt want anyone else to overhear what I was about to say.Id calmed down a bit by the time I threw him into a chair, maybe cuz I finally had a chance to ask someone the question Id been asking myself every moment since I fell outa that dumpster Wheres Lena?I said, the words almost tripping over each other.Who?he asked.Lena!I shouted.Who the hells Lena?You got her prisoner.Thirty something, long brown hair, hazel eyes.He shook his head and I hit him, hard, on the side of the face, once and then again.Tell me!I dont know what youre talking about!he cried, blood starting to trickle from his lip.Im just an ordinary Specialfrom the barracks behind the main building.We dont get involved in that sort of stuff.Where would they keep her?I dont know!he said exaggeratedly, like I must be hard of hearing or something.Jesus, I growled, and grabbing him by the collar I jerked him up out of his seat, gave him a real blast of the look, face to face, then threw him back down again.For a moment I just stood there, slowly becoming aware that my loss of control had meant me making a mistake, playing it wrongor leastways, taking a gamble that hadnt paid off.Eventually he met my gaze, regaining confidence, maybe taking my preoccupation as a sign that Id lost my nerve.Id start running if I were you, old man, he said.Killing an Infinity Special?The way theyll torture you, youll beg them to end your life.I sighed.He was right.The only thing was, he hadnt thought it through properly eithercourse he was right, I shouldntve killed his partner, but now that I had, Id be a fool to leave a witness.I grabbed him and wrestled my way over to the full length window.As he began to guess what I had in mind, he started struggling even harder, elbowing me in the face with such force I thought for a moment I was going to black out.But I clung on, determined to maintain my grip as I dragged him ever closer, til finally I was able to maneuver him around, release his hold on me and shove him as hard as I could.The glass exploded outward and for one absurd moment he just hung in midair like a cartoon character, then he let out this long, loud wail and disappeared from sight as he plummeted to the street below.I took the emergency stairs and slipped out the back of the building, having no wish to be seen by the crowd I was sure was gathering at the front.I headed back to the churchyard as fast as I could.As I was crossing the Square, this Dragonfly suddenly dropped down out of the smoke, flying so low I thought they were going to land.It hung there for a few moments, then slowly began to circle, ever wider, til eventually it disappeared into the smoke again.I mean, it wasnt unusual, but it didnt do a lot for my peace of mind.I was feeling pretty guilty about what Id doneI didnt do that sort of thing anymore, and even back in the day, Id never been one for mindless violenceand yet really, what were we talking about?A couple of Specials, guys whod repeatedly massacred helpless peopleand who knows, maybe two who were on duty the night little Arturo got killed?They might evenve assisted in some way.I turned the corner off the Square and was just about to head down to the churchyard when I noticed something.I stopped, backtracking several paces.It was here, too, written on the wall in even bigger letters than opposite the churchyard:  THERES NONE SO BLIND AS THOSE WHO WILL NOT SEE        Into the Fire        ELEVEN The graffiti was written in exactly the same way, and presumably by the same person.It was also quite fresh, maybe even from that morning.Immediately it set me thinking: this was another place I frequently passed, where someone might just leave a message they were hoping Id read.But no, I knew I had to stop thinking that way.It had nothing to do with me, just someone who wanted to share something with the world.It was sheer coincidence Lena used to be blind and wasnt anymore.In fact, it wasnt even coincidence, just me trying to make something out of nothing...Theres none so all seeing as those out to torture themselves.To my surprise, when I got back to the crypt I found everyone sitting around watching Jimmys mini screen.Is that okay?I asked Jimmy.Yeah, he replied, a little smugly, if theyre searching for its location, theyre currently sifting street by street though St.Petersburg.Id do anything but tell him, but his skill with that sort of thing never failed to amaze me.Anything interesting?I asked, a little concerned in case there was any mention of the two Specials or the monster whod taken them out.Ask The Worlds Most Wanted, Delilah rasped drily.Really?Again Jimmy looked a little pleased with himself, though he did attempt a degree of modesty.Its just a title, he said.Something snappy for people to remember me by.All the other channels the same?I asked.Jimmy grunted.What other channels?I stared at him.Thered been hundreds of different channels when Id left for the Island, mostly little independents, but a dozen or more big players too.There are other channels, he told me, but Infinity or its affiliates appears to own them all.We were right: theyre in total control now.What government there iswell, nothing more than a figurehead reallywent bust long ago.Same old problem: too much going out, not enough coming in.The satellites were their last hope, though Infinity even paid for them.Private enterpriseand for sure I didnt have to dig far to find Infinitycalled in their loans and shut them down.Huh.No one told us that at the time.They talk endlessly about democracy but have complete control of all mediaand we know what that means, dont we.Oh yeah, and they provide free Internet, too.To everyone.Whats wrong with that?He gave this kind of disgusted snort.Manipulate so called competition laws to get rid of the opposition, then when its just you, use it for whatever you like: censorship, spying, propaganda; invent stuff, erase it, take people out, remove their records, say they never even existed.Not cool.He paused for a moment, then started ranting again, No one ever stopped to think...its Lemmings Law: if everyones doing it, it must be okay.We were seduced into becoming utterly reliant upon the media, and while we all went along blindly trusting in the idea of the greater good, Infinity was hell bent on its own evil agenda.In truth, we lost control almost immediately.He gestured at the screen.Look what theyre saying about me, he protested.The biggest threat to our society weve ever known!Me!...I can barely put my socks on in the morning.They must be pretty open about it if you found all this out, I said, looking for some consoling factor.Jimmy stared at me as if I was even stupider than hed thought.What dya think took me so long?I had to hack in all over the place.Oh, I said.I shouldve guessed that, and probably would have, if my mind hadnt suddenly shot off in its most traveled direction.What about Lena?Dyou find anything out about her?He shook his head.I guess hed known that would be my first question.I did try, but...no, sorry.Nothing at all?Ill keep looking, he told me.There are holding cells in the Infinity building, I can tell you that.That didnt really mean muchmaybe she wasnt even being held in a cell.What about a hospital?I think theyve got pretty much everything in there.I went quiet for a moment, absently looking at the screen.There was an ad on there for some new chocolate barI mean, what couldve been more normal?But in the context of our lives, it felt like an obscenity.I need you to see the place, I told him.Its too hi tech for me.I cant go down there, he protested, not if its as secure as you say.Jimmy I begged, and though I never actually said Lena, I knew he heard it all right.Its not going to help anyone if I get caught, he told me.Delilah turned to him and raised her eyebrows, like she wasnt so sure about that, but the little guy had obviously had a thought.Mind you...What?If I could take the camera out of this, he said, pointing at the screen, theres a mini monitor amongst that stuff I brought back from Hi Tech Alley...a microphone...I just sat there, no idea what he was talking about, but knowing any interruption would be dismissed.Maybe...just maybe, he went on, those wheels almost visibly spinning away in his head.Be a bit crude, but it might do the trick.Jimmy?I asked, my curiosity getting the better of me.You could be my eyes and ears...I cant go, but you can.I stared at him as I finally got some idea of what he had in mind.Im gonna be your cameraman?Yeah!I tell you what I want to see, and all you gotta do is point.He paused for a moment as another problem occurred to him.If its as sensitive as you say...its probably got some kind of image jamming going on.I thought that was it, hed run out of ideas, but no, this was Jimmy.Therell have to be two of youone with the camera, one with a shield.Gordie felt my eyes upon him and jumped to his feet.No problem, he said, acting all big and hard.I wouldnt, Jimmy said.Youve probably been recorded somewhere as a groupingappear down there together, it might set alarm bells off.Youre better off with someone elsea female.Lile?I said, not wanting to offend, but fearing she really wasnt up to it.Jimmy gestured at Hanna, and Gordie immediately let out this howl of protest.No way!I turned to HannaI mean, shes a great kid, and fearless too, but I really wasnt sure about taking her to the Infinity building.She glanced up from the screen, apparently not in the least bit fazed.Okay, she trilled, immediately returning her attention to whatever it was she was watching.But Gordie was a long way from happy; him and Hanna never had got on that well, and without Arturo around to act as a buffer, their antagonism had become that much more noticeable.You cant take her, he sneered.All she does is dance.I can fight...if I have to, she said, with the hint of a threat.As long as its set to music, he scoffed, but Hanna ignored him, concentrating on the screen, like he was a stupid child and shed expected no better from him.Clancy!Gordie protested.Theres not going to be any fighting, I told him.Leastways, I hope not.Nooo!he cried, turning his back on the screen, sulking, or until he realized the only person he was punishing was himself.In the end, Jimmys logic prevailed.Even in the middle of the twenty first century a man accompanied by a young female was much less threatening than two men together.And he was right about me and Gordie possibly having been logged as a group already, and covering a suspiciously wide area of the City in the last couple of days.As for the equipment we needed, he eagerly rose to the challenge, promising us hed come up with something by the end of the day, and that with a bit of luck, wed be able to head over to Infinity the following day.He was just about to turn off the screen and start dissembling it again when he was confronted by his own image.I tell ya, they sure had it in for him.I couldnt believe all the stuff they came up with.Theyd guessed he mightve disguised himself so ran through all the possibilities, ending up with making him look like the devil, with horns and all.But it was what they said that was truly offensive.There wasnt a thing they didnt throw at him: his senility, the money his terrorism was costing everyone, the fact that his parents were illegal migrants, that he was in a relationship with a prostitute (how the hell did they even know that?), that he kept the company of young childrenand all reported so heavy with innuendo that it damn near fell out the bottom of the screen.By the time theyd finished with him he was an arch terrorist, a mass murderer, a whoremonger, a pedophile, the bastard son of illegalsand worst of all (and the charge they kept repeating over and over, as if they knew it would have the most influence), he was gonna cost every man, woman and child thousands and thousand of dollars.There wasnt one emotive rabble rousing button they didnt press.And yet I couldnt help but feel there was something a little desperate about it, almost as if this huge all powerful organization was afraid of him.I turned and looked at Jimmy: this wizened, bald old guy limping around the crypt, getting all sparkly eyed at the possibility of using that resourceful brain of his.What the hell was there to fear in him?I guess he did take out the satellites, but that was just to escape the Island.We never really thought about the repercussions.This ceaseless vendetta against the little guy didnt make any sense at all.Jimmy sent me out shopping.I had to trek around for some old fashioned wire coathangers, tinfoil, all kinds of stuff Id normally associate with setting up a home rather than embarking on a dangerous operation.When he finally got everything finishedwell, he sure was right when hed said itd be crude.He gave me this little bundle of techno junk held together with insulating tape, and Hanna had a kind of large tennis racket that he proceeded to take apart and show her how to reassemble before taking it apart again and stuffing it into her pockets.We talked the plan through and decided the best time would be late afternoon, just as the light was starting to fade.Even with the pall of smoke hanging over the city, broad daylight hadnt seemed like a great idea, but we needed enough light for Jimmy to get detailed images.Mind you, we were kidding ourselves if we thought less light would hamper Infinitys security in any way.I couldnt imagine thered be any time theyd be at a disadvantage.Gordie didnt wish us luck or even say goodbye; just made more of his acid comments.Mind you, it did feel kinda strange going off with Hanna.I seen her fight over on the Island and though she might notve looked it, underneath all that slender grace she was a real tough kid.But counting on her as my buddy, to watch my back?That was something else.I never minded that she didnt say a lotin fact, I preferred it.Ive never been much of a talker myself, so it was pretty relaxing being with someone who didnt feel the need to constantly pick up the slack.I wouldntve have expected us to exchange more than the odd word all the way over.However, when we got to the churchyard entrance and were about to head up toward the Square, I noticed another message, sprayed on a smaller scrap of burned wall but not far from the original.This time there were just three words:  LOVE IS BLIND  What the hell?I exclaimed.Hanna stopped and followed my gaze across the street.What is that?I exclaimed.Always this thing about being blind.We crossed over, me straining to see into the smoke just in case whoever had done it was still around.By the time I reached the other side, Hanna was already inspecting the graffiti.Still smells, she said.Must be recent.Do you know what they mean?I said, looking from one message to the other.Hanna shook her head.Not really.Theres none so blind as those who wont see...Love is blindI just dont get it.Do you think its Lena?she asked.I must admit, that had been one of a thousand thoughts thatd passed through my mind but Id never really entertained it.Why dya say that?Could be.Wouldnt she just come to the crypt?Maybe she cant for some reason.Its weird, but as I stared into that kids face, with its prettiness still somewhat watermarked by what shed endured out on the Island, I realized yet again what a complete original she wasand how useful it was having someone like her around.Why not?I asked.I dont know, she said, turning to walk on in that assured manner that always made me think she was making her entrance onto a stage and about to dance.I stayed where I was, thinking it over.Even if Lena couldnt return to the church for some reasonif she was worried about leading others here, or somethingshed find a way, wouldnt she?Sighing to myself, I hurried after Hanna, afraid of losing her as she began to disappear into the smoke.We arrived at Infinity just as the falling sun was giving the building a pink rinse, though it didnt look any less intimidating for all that.I found myself scouring those endless rows of windows again, hoping to catch a glimpse of Lena.It was pretty stupid: from that distance, and through the smoke, it was like looking for a needle in a haystack blindfoldedbut still I tried.Between the fence and road at the front of the building there was a lawn, eighty yards or so wide: a human touch in an otherwise inhumane place.Wed already checked the entrance out as we sauntered by, trying not to look interested but taking in everything we could.There was all kinda stuff there: what looked like shields, scanners, maybe even automated weapons.That was what I needed Jimmy forto be certain.We found a bit of cover amongst the scrub and I explained to Hanna about the camerasthat you only got thirty seconds or so before the next one came along.What I didnt know was whether they were computer  or human monitored, whichd make a big difference: computers can only be programmed for a finite number of actions, while humans are much better at interpretation.On the other hand, if a computer concludes youre up to no good, its pretty hard to talk your way out of it.She waited for the next camera to pass, then took out her coathangers and began to shape them, dropping the arrangement to the ground when the next camera approached.Piece by piece she worked on assembling this kinda large saucepan, wrapped with tinfoil, adding the battery and gizmo Jimmy gave her to make a shield.She did it with such precision, followed his instructions so coolly, I gotta admit, I was already more comfortable with the decision to bring her.Meanwhile, I took out my so called camera and communicator.Im ready, Hanna told me, turning on her shield so it was working before I operated my camera.Jeez, I really hoped Jimmy knew what he was doing.Jimmy?I muttered into my apparatus, keeping my voice low.There was no answer, so I tried again.Jimmy!I looked at Hanna.Doesnt work, I muttered.Worry about your end of thingsnot mine, came this barely recognizable, rather automated sounding squeaky voice.He appeared on the mini monitor, for some reason looking unnaturally red.Before I could speak, I had to conceal the apparatus from yet another passing camera.It certainly wasnt ideal, what with Hanna and me having to hide our stuff every few moments and Jimmy not always able to hear us, but slowly we began to make sense of each other.Okay, just start by panning the whole thing for me, one end to the other, Jimmy asked.No!Too fastgo slower!Jimmy, I complained, seeing another camera bearing down on us, I gotta be quick!The little guy kept thinking out loud about what he could see, going through an inventory, barely taking any notice of me apart from to give orders.Okay, yep, thats pretty standardhey, can you focus in on the roof?By the helipad there...Nah, cant seeno, no, wait!...Whoa!he cried.Heavy!I wont be landing my private jet there any time soon.I wonder what an average everyday respectable conglomerate wants with heavy duty laser cannons?...Clancy, where you gone?I covered my makeshift apparatus yet again as a camera slid past, pretending to be searching the waste ground for anything of value while Hanna did the same.I tell you, she was doing really well.Nothing seemed to fluster her.Wow!Cool!gasped Jimmy, impressed more than intimidated by the hardware on display.So what dya think?I asked.I dunno, he said.The roofs heavily guarded, and as for the entrance, well, forget it.I dont get the lawn though.What dya mean?Whats the point of it?Every thing else is there for a purpose...Try chucking a rock.What?Heave a rock over there.But get ready to run.Are you kidding me?I doubt anythingll happen outside the fence.You sure about that?More or less.Thank you, Jimmy, I said, glaring at that tiny red representation of him on the monitor.Maybe Infinity was right and he was the devil incarnate.Though I say it myself, rock throwing is one of my few talents, and one was winging its way over there in no time.It landed on the grass while I trained my makeshift camera on it, watching for any reaction.There was none.Try a bigger one, Jimmy said.What?It might have a heavier trigger point.Otherwise anything would set it off.A bird could drop a twig.With a pointed sigh, I picked up a larger rock and lobbed it over.This time there was a reaction: a rabbit appeared from nowhere, ran around in a couple of circles, then just sat there.Hanna gave out with all these cooing and ooohing noises, and it occurred to me that shed probably never seen a live rabbit in her life.There you go, I said to Jimmy, as if the whole thing had just been declared safe by an expert.But he still wasnt happy.I dont know, he said.Maybe it needs to be even heavier.Jimmy!I protested.It dont make sense, Big Guy!All those open areas unprotected.Where did that rabbit come from?A hole, Id guess, I rather sneered.Mm...That must be the dark areas I can see, he said, obviously splitting his screen and pulling up a second image.For a while he said nothing as he studied and played with the other image.I couldnt see his face that well, but he looked worried.Several cameras passed by, sliding and jerking on their wire, and I realized what they reminded me of: the dishes in the First Original Sushi Bar, trundling by on their belt.Theres something wrong here, Jimmy muttered to himself.I just dont know what.You want me to hop over the fence and go for a walk?I said sarcastically.Ideally, yes, he replied.Yeah, well, you know what you can do.I was so intent on that tiny monitor I didnt notice what Hanna was doing until I glanced up: shed left her shield propped up in a bush and was bounding over to the fence.Hanna?I called, wondering what the hell she had in mind.It was like watching a champion athlete do something you wouldnt have even thought possible.She kinda leapt up, rebounded off the fence about halfway up, then sailed over the top, slithering under the wires and down the other side, landing on the ground with barely any impact.Hanna!I shouted again, but she took a few steps away from the fence, hopefully avoiding the gaze of the oncoming camera.What do you want me to do?Christ!Jimmy, can you see this?I said, directing my makeshift camera at her.Tell her to just walk around naturally, he said.What?Shes in there now, he said, perfectly logically.When I looked up again, Hanna was already off, moving toward the squatting rabbit, doing her best not to frighten it, taking a few gliding steps forward at a time.Big Guy?Jimmy suddenly said, his voice lower, worried.Its okay, shes fine, I replied, glancing over at the main building to make sure there was no sign of any activity.What the hells that?Jimmy muttered.I turned to the monitor.He was looking at his other image and obviously something that was really unnerving him.Whats the matter?Theres something going on there.What?Get her out!he suddenly shouted.Why?I said, looking over and seeing nothing.Clancy!Get her out!Hanna!Hanna!I called.I tell ya, it was one helluva shock: suddenly sections of the grass started to rise up, mounds split open, doors slid back and something began to emerge.Hanna!I screamed.It took an age for me to realize what they were.Two of them came bounding out of one opening and several more from another: shiny, silver, moving like some kind of animalbut how could they be?Then I heard this sound, a sort of slurping, pneumatic galloping, and I realized they were robots.I guess they looked closest to a dog, a much chunkier version of those pit bull things I used to see around when I was a kid.Their heads were almost entirely comprised of jaws, with huge, pointed metal teeth and a couple of slashes for eyes that I guessed were cameras; and all of them were giving out with this snarling mechanical roar, louder and more chilling than any real animal could ever be.Hanna turned and started to run back to the fence, but it was obvious she wasnt gonna make it.There mustve been half a dozen or more of those things converging on her.Worse still, there was nothing I could do, no way could I get over that fence in time...Two of them came streaking in from the side, emerging from bunkers only yards inside the perimeter, snarling and snapping, their eager jaws ready to rip into her.It was weird, almost miraculous.I swear, how fast those things moved, she didnt stand a chance, but she kind of changed mode and started to move in a different fashion, and in a lull amongst the growling and snarling, I realized she was actually humming to herself.She started to dance to the music, leaping into the air time and time again, pirouetting, leaving their jaws snapping at nothing.Two of them collided with each other, one ending up on the ground, kicking its legs in the air while the other resumed its pursuit.Now more and more mounds were rising up, their exits spitting out further silver monsters, all running at her with their pneumatic slurp slurp.As she neared the fence, there was a whole pack waiting for her and I had no idea what she was gonna do, but she just ran at them full speed and leaped into the air, using their backs as springboards, bouncing from one to another, eluding their snapping jaws until she was finally able to jump onto the fence, scramble up it and slide through the gap, leaving them growling and snarling down below.She ran over and threw her arms around me, giving me a grateful hug.You okay?I asked, hugging her back.Yeah, she said, forcing a slightly nervous smile.It was fun.Just at that moment we heard these kinda howls of preprogrammed victory and celebration: the rabbit had been chased and caught and was being systematically torn to shreds, piece by piece, like theyd keep going til there was nothing left.Hanna looked a little sick, maybe cuz of what happened to the rabbit, maybe cuz it was a graphic demonstration of what mightve happened to her.Thats horrible, she moaned.Jimmys voice suddenly crackled into life.Big Guy, get out of there, he said.Somebodys coming.We didnt worry about the cameras any moreI reckon they were computer monitored anyway.We just ran, disappearing into the smoke and gathering darkness, ignoring the sirens coming from the direction of the main building, the sound of a Dragonflys engine starting up on the roof.When we got back to the crypt everyone was sitting around looking a little worried, even Gordie, though I reckon wedve had tove dragged it out of him by his back teeth.Hanna made light of what had happened, answering almost every question simply, like it was an everyday thing to be chased by a pack of mechanical jaws on legs.What the hell are those things?I asked Jimmy, knowing hed be the only one who might have a clue.Growlers.What?Dogs of war, or a version of them.Thought they were only allowed on the battlefield.Officially theyve never been used, but there were rumors.They were supposed to be a more humane, more convenient way to fight, Jimmy said, with some irony.Tearing your enemies apart, incurring no domestic casualties, made them politically popular.Theyll attack anything theyre told to; theyll plant bombs, blow themselves upthey can even rebuild each other if they get damaged, work out how to divide their parts to keep the maximum number functioning, so instead of three four legged growlers and a heap of nothing, you got four three legged ones coming at you.Jeez, I gasped.Never thought Id see them in civilian use.Delilah gave this long, weary sigh, the kind she often gave out with since shed lost Arturo, as if everything that had subsequently happened was merely confirmation of how bad this world had become.If the Infinity complex hadnt looked unbreachable before, it sure did then.Id been no use at all to Hanna earlierby the time Idve got my arthritic old bones over that fence shed have been torn into bits no bigger than postage stamps.I thanked God she was young and strong and full of spirit...but me...I was a dinosaur, a washed up old big guy.I didnt even know what I was up against anymore.Dogs of war!What the hell next?In my day you fought people: you saw the whites of their eyes, even heard what they had to say; a lot of the time there was even a sort of respect.Now we got jaws on legs: Growlers.And yet I knew that if I was ever gonna see my Lena again, somehow I had to find a way of dealing with them.I dont know if I got up in the morning or just didnt go to sleep at night, but shortly after dawn I made my way up the steps as quietly as I could.I didnt want the others to see me in the mood I was in.Id been churning all sorts of stuff over all night and it hadnt done me a helluva lot of good.There was a little bit of an early morning mist mingling with the smoke and the light of the day was slowly seeping through both of them, creating this rather eerie and unreal world, like a no mans land between this existence and the next.Maybe that was why I started to meander around the churchyard, reading the occasional gravestone, tributes to those on the other side.I dont know when she did itfor sure she never said anything to mebut I came to this very plain, simple stone cross with no carved inscription, but someone had recently scratched something on it.Farewell the Mickey Mouse Kid of where and when, I dont know, but youll always live in my thoughts  It was Delilah, of course, and I have to say, not only did it bring a tear to my eye, it also shamed me.This was no time for feeling sorry for myself: I had to get on with it, contribute in some way.Maybe I could go out and find some decent leftovers at an all night diner, have breakfast ready for the others when they got up?I turned and started to make my way over to the street, filled with a sudden purpose, but then I stopped in my tracks.It was the graffiti.There was no new message, nothing cryptic for me to try to work my way through, but it was all perfectly clear now.Someone had added a word.One single word, but it changed everything.Into the Fire        TWELVE  LOVE IS BLIND, CLANCY  Finally, I understood: all that time Id been dismissing the messages, saying they couldnt have anything to do with Lenas blindness, and I was right.They didnt.It had been blindness they were talking about.Theyd been trying to tell me that I was missing something!That somewhere there was a two and a two that needed putting together, and I hadnt identified them.Maybe it had something to do with the Island?The fact thatthough I hated to say itLenad had a relationship with the head Wastelord?Hed trusted her with a lot of his secrets, and everyone always reckoned there was Mainland involvement in what went on with them, shipping organs, all that, so maybe she knew something that could prove embarrassing to Infinity?Though what that might be I couldnt begin to imagine.Or maybe it was what I said about Jimmy: they knew there was a connection and were determined to exploit it.I went back down to the crypt and got the little guy, dragging him over to take a look almost before he was awake, but he just confused me even more.Its an Islander, Big Guy, he said dismissively, looking like he wanted to go back to his sleeping bag.Gotta grudge.Theyre messing with you.What dyou mean?Love is blind!You love a blind woman.They dont know she can see now.I stopped for a moment, staring at it, trying to see it from his point of view.Nah...Come on!Who else would it be?Jimmy!Its someone who knows where I amtheyre following me!Probably just walking by and happened to see you, or maybe they seen you around and know you live in the general area.Its a coincidence.I just stared at him, disappointed by his reaction.Big Guy!he groaned.You know what some Islanders were like, they didnt call that place the Village for nothingit was full of idiots.I got a little annoyed with him, without another word spinning around and heading off, going up to check out the Square.The message had been altered up there too, just as Id expected, though this time they didnt put my whole name, just my initial.LOVE IS BLIND, C  Somebody knew something; it wasnt just gossip, some Villager from the Island taking an unhealthy interest in my relationship.There was something they thought I should knowthe only trouble was, they were hopelessly overestimating my intelligence.I hung around for a while, hoping to see someone I recognized, someone who might do such a thing, and came across another sprayed message.I mustve missed it before, cuz again it looked like the C had been added laterso maybe Jimmy was right, they werent sure where I was?They just had a vague idea and putting the message opposite the church was a coincidence?The more I drifted around, the fewer ideas I got on who I was looking for.I mean, even after all these years, I still had a finely tuned survival instinct and I was sure I was followed at some pointthough they were pretty good at it.It did briefly occur to me that maybe Ray was involved, that he was planning something, but if hed found me, I reckoned he wouldve let me know.I moseyed around for the rest of the morning, never going too far from the Square, doing my best to make myself visible but actually using all the old tricks when you think youre being followed: ducking into doorways and waiting, doubling back, all that stuff.I never saw a soul, and actually, began to worry I was letting my imagination run away with me.That kinda thing can drive you completely crazy.I remember several guys in the old days, promising young ones who mightve been able to make something of themselves, but they blew it all cuz they became obsessed with the idea of being plotted againstthey developed class one paranoia.They were forever looking over their shoulders, checking underneath their cars, accusing all kinds of people of all manner of thingsand what made it worse: there was no chance of any kind of respite, they couldnt possibly have a relationship cuz they didnt trust anyone.One guy I knew, Donnie Davis, got so fixated on the notion that everyone was spying on him, he stopped going out altogether.In the end they found him backed up against the wall in a cupboard in his apartment.The place was wrecked and everything that might possibly have been used for spying on himeven his two catshad been pulverized to nothing.He blew out the back of his own head, as if worried someone behind him was still watching.When I finally got back to the crypt, I was greeted by Jimmy with that look about him; the one wheres hes about to astonish me with how clever he is, and, by implication, how stupid I am.I know what happened to Lena, he said.The others immediately turned from what they were doing.What dyou mean?I know how that doctor was able to get her through the gate scan.Again he produced a homemade contraption that incorporated the screen, but this time as something even more elaborate.Hed been using that thing as a basis for all manner of stuff; taking it apart, rebuilding it, a bit like Lego, that old kids toy.Know what this is?he asked, well aware I didnt.Nope, I replied.Its a kind of poor mans spectroscope.It measures the properties of light emitted or absorbed by chemical elements.He looked at me and saw my eyes had already started to glaze over but he was determined to have his moment of glory.It worried me that even if the people on the gate lied to you, that doctor would still risk the limo being scanned in a spot check.I thought he mustve left Lena behind.Even that she might be...He grunted and picked up the syringe Id brought back.There was just enough for me to analyze.You dont say, I muttered, though actually, shit to admit, I was pretty impressed yet again.Mind you, I wasnt ready for what came next.He poisoned her.I just gaped and Delilah let out a gasp.Shes dead?I never said that, he said with a smirk.Screw you, Jimmy, I growled, not caring for the way he was going about this.
