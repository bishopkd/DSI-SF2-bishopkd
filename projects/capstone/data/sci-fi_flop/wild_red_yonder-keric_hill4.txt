"Faster!"Denz urged Gavin, who told the men in the engine room to open up the throttle all the way."You have to use the maneuvering thrusters too!"Denz shouted as the roar from the engine room filled the ship."Forward thrust on all of the maneuvering thrusters!"Gavin shouted.The men at the thrusters fired them and all of the crew felt the acceleration.The acceleration pulled the men toward the rear of the ship."I feel like I weigh 300 pounds!"Wes grunted."I thought you did weigh 300 pounds," Jose retorted.***"Sir!"a Purple Man officer called as he rushed to the engine room of the barge."Yes," the captain answered as he turned."A Pinak is close to the ion path ahead.""Do they know that they are close to the ion stream?""I dont think so.""Tell them to veer off."***Up in the cockpit, Gavin and Denz worked furiously to pilot the ship.Gavin would listen to Denzs instructions and then shout commands to the crew.They didnt seem to notice the radio crackle.***"What is your course, Pinak?"the desperate voice called in Purple Man.Calvin sat nearby and noticed the transmission."They calling us," he said to Denz in Purple Man."I no understand.You talk.""I cant," Denz yelled over his shoulder as he leaned toward a window to get a better look."Tell them something!""I cant talk to them!"Calvin protested."Yes, you can.Ive taught you lots of words!"Calvin shrugged and pushed the transmit button.***The captain turned to his officer, "Well, what did the Pinak say?"he asked."They just said, 'Soup,' sir," he answered."Soup?""Yes."***"Get the grappling hooks ready," Jeff called.Although he felt twice as heavy as he would on Earth, Jose pulled himself up along a wall of the bay and grabbed grappling hooks.He handed them to four of the others.***At his post, Javier saw the barges getting closer and bigger.Soon the first barge whipped past them and the bottom side of it was whizzing over Javiers head only ten yards away."Theyre right on top of us!"Javier yelled as he ducked.Gavin saw the first barge as it flew overhead.It was very long, narrow, and square shaped, with tubing and equipment protruding on all sides.Denz looked at the computer screens and was making some calculations."Almost to full speed," Gavin told Denz."Roll around so that the bay door faces it," Denz said.***The Purple Man officer reported to the anxious captain."Sir, we didnt collide with it, but it is getting closer.""Do you have an image of it?"the barge captain asked."Here, sir," the officer pointed to a screen.They both looked at photograph of the Sharks blurred outline."We got this image as we passed them. "The Sharks painted mouth was barely visible."They must be the renegades," the barge captain concluded."We'll be lucky if we live to see tomorrow."***Soon the second barge was cruising over the Shark.Now Javier could see the end of a long line of barges coming towards them, all connected to the first.The Shark started to roll gracefully over and began to catch up to the second barge.The men in the bay slid the door open and saw the barge mere yards in front of them.They readied their grappling hooks."Lets go, boys!"Jeff yelled, and they all fired their hooks, which curved outward and snapped onto the bottom of the barge.The cables whipped and flapped wildly as the barge and the Shark shifted back and forth.Then the men leapt out and drifted towards the barge.Soon they fell back to the end of their cables, which snapped tight, and they thumped into the side of the barge."Theyre on the barge," Calvin reported.Gavin nodded, wiping away the sweat."Were losing speed, Gavin," Denz said desperately as he strained to look out the window."I know!"The Shark began to lag behind.The engines were now screaming.Steam was drifting in the cockpit from behind them."We cant keep this up," Gavin shouted.The Shark was now losing ground fast.The second barge flew past, and then the third.The barges flashed by faster and faster until they all zipped by.The Shark curved away from the Ion Course and began to spin slowly."We lost them," Denz mumbled.***Clinging to the outside hull of the barge, Jeff forced a hatch open and heaved himself inside.He saw a Purple Man glance at him and then turn and run down a small corridor that went the length of the barge.Jeff turned and helped the others climb in.***Mabok shuddered and woke up.He grasped the arm of the padded seat of the passenger barge he was riding in.A guard was standing above him, holding out his hand."Your papers!"he said louder.Other passengers were getting out their I. D.  papers.Mabok felt instinctively for his I. D.  card, and pulled it out.He glanced at it.His picture was on one side over a fake name.The guard grabbed it, turning it over curiously."Hmm.Well do a check on this," he said and left.***The guards looked at the screen as Maboks records displayed."Strange, this name must be false.He was supposed to be in the fleet that was lost at the Reds' planet!""He must have jumped ship," the other said as he tapped the screen where the false name flashed."A miserable deserter. "***Fear gripped Mabok and he hoped that they hadnt found out his true identity.His family had not been able to leave their planet to meet him, so he got a false I. D.  and risked the trip home.After what seemed like eternity, two guards came from the front of the aisle and headed towards him.They were carrying guns this time.Mabok clamped his eyes shut and he sat down deep in his chair.The guard who had taken his I. D.  pointed towards him as they approached and the other readied his gun.At the last minute, the barge shuddered violently.Mabok saw a wave of gas fly by his window.What was going on?He gripped the seat ahead and readied himself to run from the guards in front of him, but two other guards came from behind.Now Mabok had no escape.There were guards in both directions.Another shudder shook the barge much more violently this time, and a siren went off.The guards were thrown to the floor with the blast and someone was shouting something.Mabok closed his eyes again.He waited for them to grab him, but felt nothing.He opened his eyes just in time to see the guards running away.Mabok let out a sigh of relief, but knew it wasnt over yet.***Jeff crouched behind a crate.The Purple Men guards were in full retreat and dashed through another barge airlock before turning to look back."They're scared out of their pants and we haven't even fired at them yet," Wes said."Let's see what this does," Jeff said.He popped his head up and fired.Wes and Jose did the same.A gas pipe ruptured near the two Purple Men, and they were blasted off the floor.The Purple guards got back on their feet and fled.Jeff reloaded his gun and the Reds jumped out and ran after them.***Mabok wondered what was happening.The other passengers around him were whispering and guessing.The airlock door slammed open and five men in spacesuits raced up the aisle.There was a red cloth tied around the arm of each of the spacesuits.He glanced at one of their faces as they rushed past.Reds!Gunfire cut through the air and the passengers screamed and crouched behind their seats.Soon the Reds came sprinting back down the aisle, going back the way they had come.From opposite ends of the passenger barge, the Reds and the guards started firing at each other.Air started howling out of a hole in the barge wall.Blowers in the walls kicked in to compensate.A chunk of a seat shot past Maboks head as the shots continued to fly.After that near miss, Mabok found himself jumping to his feet.Before anyone could react, he scrambled down the car towards the Reds and leapt through the door at the end of the barge.He ran right into a Red and sent him sprawling.It was Wes.Wes looked at him in surprise."Mabok!"he stammered.Then they dashed down the hall together.Soon all of the Reds were in the last barge."The Purple Men don't know it," Jeff said, "But there're enough of them to wipe us out easily.We'd better get outta here before they catch on. "Mabok scrambled into a spacesuit as the Reds fought off the guards.Jeff forced a hatch open and waited while Jose climbed outside onto the outer hull of the barge.Jeff fired a shot through the door to keep the guards back."Wheres the Shark?"Wes asked."I dont see it," Jose replied."Theyre in the last car, Captain," the officer of the barge said as he held an intercom to his ear."They might hold the treasure for ransom," the barge captain said."Tell the men to be careful not to hit it.""Yes, sir."***The gun battle raged on.Mabok flipped some switches.The tunnel connecting their barge to the next swung loose.Mabok slid over beside Jeff and tapped his helmet.Mabok tried to motion with his hands that he was going outside.Jeff shrugged and let him go out.Mabok climbed along the outside of the barge and leapt into the space between it and the next barge.There was a hitch connecting the two barges and power cables stretching between the two.Mabok disconnected the thick power cables by pulling the plugs apart.Then he pulled a lever on the hitch.The barge lurched and a blast of gas shot out from the hitch as it popped loose.The Reds watched their barge slow down and begin to fall behind the rest of the string of barges.***Denz was the first to climb into the captured barge after the Shark rendezvoused with it.He scrambled among the cargo containers as the Reds greeted each other and talked about what had happened."Its the insignia of the treasury!"he shouted excitedly, pointing to the markings on one of the containers.He pried open the container.He was talking so fast that the others couldnt catch his words.Small gray cylinders floated out, and Denz chuckled gleefully."We got a full load headed for the Jaka home planet. ""Whats so valuable about these little cylinders?"Gavin asked dubiously."The fusion gas in them is extremely expensive," Denz answered."With one of these cylinders in your pocket, you'd never have to work again. "Gavin then noticed Mabok."Mabok?"Gavin asked doubtfully, "What are you doing here?""I guess Im with you for good," Mabok answered.Denz laughed and patted him on the back."Now theres another Purple Man to keep me company!"he said, "They dont have any idea how much this is worth," he whispered into Maboks ear as he pointed to the containers."Let's get a tow line hooked up to the barge and get out of here," Denz said."We only have a few hours before they come back with reinforcements.""We've got to blow the barge up," Jeff said as he looked out of the cockpit window, "We can't tow it around forever, and we don't have enough room to carry the treasure.""Right," Cliff said."You can't blow up the cylinders!"Denz said, "You'd be wasting a fortune!""So what do we do with the cylinders?"Jeff asked as he turned around in his cockpit seat."We'll have to hide them somewhere," Denz said."Until we can come back with a bigger ship.""So how do we hide the cylinders?"Jeff asked."We could bury the barge somewhere," Cliff said."Maybe," Denz said, pondering, "We would have to hide it far enough below the surface that they couldn't pick it up with their sensors.It is very easy to pick up traces of the fusion gas.In fact, it would have to be at least a hundred feet underground.""We can't dig a hole that deep in a planet," Jeff said."It would take forever."Cliff pulled out a chart and began pointing out possibilities in the system."Planets aren't the only places we could hide the treasure. "Denz studied the sheet as Cliff pointed out landmarks."We've got several asteroids and a comet here in the inner solar system.What about burying the treasure on the comet?"Cliff asked."Comets are basically just dirty snowballs.The ground should be pretty easy to dig.""Is this comet going to stay around for a while?"Gavin asked."What if it breaks apart?"Cliff looked at his notes."There's no guarantee that it won't, but it looks pretty big.It's headed in toward the local sun now.If it survives, it wont come back to the sun for another thirty years.""Denz," Gavin asked him, "What do you think?""I think it will work," Denz answered with a nod."Ill start the Shark towards the comet," Cliff said, and left the room.***Ten hours later the Shark began to cruise through the outer layers of the comets halo.It was barely noticeable at first.It just looked like a misty light around them.Jeff and Cliff eased the Shark closer.Soon the core itself was in sight.Even though the halo had looked bright and thick from a distance, it seemed very thin and tenuous now, even as they pulled up to the surface of the core.The comet was oddly shaped and about six miles across."It shouldn't have much gravity at all," Cliff said."It's too small."As the ship came to rest a short distance from the surface of the comet, they saw odd fountains of gas and dust billowing into the air from fissures."Amazing!"Cliff said.***Jeff came up into the cockpit and found Gavin.His space suit was covered with dirt and dust."We're almost finished filling in the hole," Jeff said as he took off his helmet."The barge seems to be staying down inside perfectly."The rest of the men were in the equipment bay, dusting off their suits."Javier," Wes said, "I thought Comet was supposed to clean things, but this comet dirt is everywhere.Whats up with this stuff?"***Outside of the Shark, Denz floated at the lookout post on the top hatch.He hurriedly took one last look at a landmark on the comet through a sighting scope, and wrote down some numbers carefully.He had to get these measurements down accurately.Finally, he added the finishing touches to a large piece of drafting paper, and then rolled it up.He had the rolled paper stashed in his bunk by the time he was spotted."Hey, Denz," Cliff said in Purple Man as he entered the ships quarters, "There you are!We need your help out in the bay.Wed like to dump the rest of the dirt and be out of here in two hours.""Im coming."***"Hey, Jose," Joe said the next day as he came into the ships quarters."Do you want to play a little catch with me?""Play catch?With what?"Jose asked."I brought along a baseball," Joe said."You brought a baseball on this trip?"Jose asked, "What else did you bring?""Oh, just a volleyball and a football.""Cool."Frank came into the equipment bay later and saw them tossing the ball.Joe leaped off of the floor, flipped over in the air and landed on the wall before catching the ball."Wow," Frank said, "You guys are getting pretty good."***"Were in position," Cliff called up to the cockpit as he finished his calculations.Denz stood next to Cliff, looking at his scribbling.He was obviously impressed."Lets not blow this one guys," he called to the crew, "Get those grappling hooks ready and lets do it like the other one.""Its definitely a ship coming in," Jose called from the lookout post outside, "Its a big one too, maybe bigger than the freighter.""Tell me when it goes into the shadow," Cliff called.The Shark was already in the shadow of the nearby planet, and blacked out.Only dim red lights lit the interior."Now," Jose called."Its in the shadow, and I can barely see it silhouetted by the stars.Its just like last time.""Start closing on them," Jeff ordered, "Ready the hooks.""Throttle up slowly on the main engines," Gavin called."Stay pointed right at it so they dont see the exhaust flame," Jeff warned."I know," Gavin replied.Several tense minutes passed, as they got closer."How much more dark time do we have, Cliff?"Jeff asked."Twelve minutes," Cliff called back."This ones going to be closer than the last one," Jeff mumbled to himself.After what seemed like forever, Cliff called again, "Four minutes, guys, wed better be close!""We are," Gavin answered."Well use the maneuvering thrusters to get up next to it.""They dont see us," Jose called from his lookout post."Yaw left at two power, now!"Gavin called."Cancel it out...now!"Gavin waited for the ship to stop turning, but it didnt."Cancel that yaw.Now!"Gavin waited a moment before calling again."Whose thruster didnt work?""What?"Frank asked from the room below.His voice was muffled."I cant hear you on the intercom!"Gavin shouted."Get the intercoms working!"Jeff cried.Gavin and Frank tried everything, but they couldnt get the intercoms to work."One minute left!"Cliff yelled out."Guys," Jose said with a touch of fear, "This one looks really big. "No one could hear him."Get us out of here!"Jeff yelled.Gavin flew down the ladder and ran back towards the engine room.The right hand bay was open and depressurized, so he had to go through the left side."Push the main engine throttles all the way forward!"he yelled to the men.The ship lurched and began accelerating forward.***A lookout on the enemy ship spun around and saw a tail of flame less than a hundred feet from his ship.It lit up a dim red outline of the Shark."Vessel," he called anxiously, "Thirty meters, starboard bow!""The pirates!"***"Faster, Gavin!"Jeff yelled.Everyone was in a panic now.They began to overtake the other ship and cruise on by.Outside, Jose saw everything lit in vivid detail as the nearby star came out from behind the planet."Jeff!"Jose gasped into the useless intercom."Gavin, is that all you can give us?"Jeff asked desperately from the cockpit."Im working on it!"Gavin yelled back angrily as he shouted orders to the men in the engine room, who worked the controls furiously."Jeff!"Jose called over the intercom, louder this time.Still no one answered him.He leaned down and tapped on the cockpit window from the outside.Jeff looked up at him from the back of the cockpit.Outside, Jose pointed at the other ship.Jeff walked over to the cockpit windows and looked out.As the suns light increased, he could see the brightening nose of the huge ship as it pointed at him.Then, it swung slowly around.The now bright sun shone all its light on the enormous craft as the two rows of gun bays crept into view.Each bay door was opening up with gun muzzles poking out at them.Each row had four cannons, making a total of eight guns, all sighted at the Shark.Denz lunged into the cockpit."Its a Frigate!"he yelled, "Get us out of here, Gavin!""Im trying!"Gavin shouted at once.The Shark flew past the Frigate and continued away from it as a tongue of flame a hundred feet long spouted out from its engines and expanded into bright exhaust plumes.Soon the Frigate was left behind them.With a burst of light and gas the Frigate lit its engines and started forward."Its coming at us!"Jose yelled as he pounded on the window."Can we outrun them?"Jeff asked Denz desperately."We can outrun them climbing directly out of the sun's gravity," Denz nodded."Theyre firing!"Jose yelled.He realized he was in an exposed position on top of the ship with no walls to protect him.He took cover a few feet down the face of the Sharks nose, where he was just in front of the cockpit windows.The Frigate behind them shuddered with flashes of light as its array of cannons burst to life, and the Shark shook like it would come apart.***Inside the equipment bay, Joe was thrown against a wall and cringed as his faceplate clinked against the wall.He opened his eyes and realized that it hadnt broken.He felt around with his feet until he found the floor and his boots magnets clicked solidly against it.Then he turned to look around.Gas was blowing everywhere and particles were drifting around the bay."Close the bay door!"he shouted.Jose peeked out from behind the Sharks nose.The Frigate had stopped, leaving its broadside facing the Shark so that its guns could fire."Theyre not chasing us!"Jose yelled happily.He saw gas and bits of debris flying out from the back of the Shark.Then, through the debris he saw a landing craft undock from the Frigate and start towards them."Landing craft coming!"Jose mouthed through the window."Weve got a lot of weight.Can we outrun it?"Jeff asked Denz."No," Denz said grimly, then took out a gun, and locked a canister in and grabbed a power supply from the wall."There will be shock troops on board."This little battle was suddenly very nasty.Denz grabbed Jeff and they rushed down the ladder.Jose was thinking the same thing as the landing craft closed on them.He quickly loaded his gun and powered it up by plugging a cord into the gun from a battery pack on his belt.When the landing craft was a hundred feet away, he fired from his lookout post.It blew him off the hull of the ship and he dangled on the end of his tether for a few moments.Next time he would stick his magnetic boots to the hull.The pilot of the landing craft ducked as Joses shot hit the windshield with a tremendous shock and cracked one of the thick panes of glass.***"Prepare to board," barked the commander of the landing craft.His men stood up in unison and brought up their weapons."They are pirates," the commander continued, "The Liaisons have instructed that none of the normal rules of engagement apply.No prisoners.Now move!"***The landing craft was now only twenty feet from the open bay and closing."Close the door!"Joe yelled."Its not closing!"The door was stuck at the spot where the Soyuz had damaged it, and soon the landing craft clanged against the hull.Its side door opened and Purple Men in suits spilled out and started trying to climb through the half closed door.Joe and everyone else took cover behind crates and fired their guns.Sparks and smoke flew everywhere as shots ricocheted off the bay door around the enemy.The Purple Men kept coming.Soon they were inside and firing at the Reds.Debris and shrapnel flew everywhere.The Reds popped out from behind their cover, fired off shots, and then ducked to reload.Several Purple Men were hit and just floated limply, stuck to the floor with their magnetic boots.Still more came.***Up on top of the ship, Jose waited, scared to think about what was happening as he loaded his gun.He saw gas and debris was blowing out of the back of the ship.He took a deep breath, detached his tether, and ran across the top of the hull until he came to where the enemy boat was attached to the Shark.There was a gripping arm that held the boat to the Shark.Jose lowered his gun and fired.The arm shattered and he had to shield his face from the debris.Then he crawled down the side of the Shark and pushed against the landing craft with one hand.It didnt budge.He pushed against it with his foot with all of his might and it began to slowly drift away.***Smoke billowed out from a ruptured pipe in the bay somewhere and completely filled the air.For the Reds, it was impossible to see more than a few feet in front of their faces.Then suddenly the Purple Men advanced out of the smoke and grappled with the Reds.Joe was thrown back against the wall.He noticed Cliff floating limp and barely had time to fire his gun to stop one of the Purple Men from stabbing Cliff with a knife.He couldnt see what was happening, so he loaded both his gun and Cliffs and jumped into the smoke.A Purple Man loomed out of nowhere and Joe shot and then ran, diving behind a crate, rolling in the air before sticking to the far wall with his boots."Its good I spent so much time playing ball," Joe thought, "Or I couldnt pull off these stunts."Then a Purple Man lunged over the crate and Joe scrambled out of his way, firing Cliff's gun.The attacker went limp.Another Purple Man came over the crate.Joe scrambled backwards as fast as he could, but he was stuck in the corner of the bay without time to reload.He looked towards the airlock door, but knew the Purple Man would get him before he could make it there.The Purple Man started for him with a knife in his hand, when Jeff and Denz burst out of the airlock with guns blazing.They shot down Joes attacker and disappeared into the smoke.After several seconds, all seemed to be still.Joe sat there, breathing, not daring to move.He loaded a gun and crept out from behind the crate.The smoke was dissipating quickly out of the open bay door and soon it was mostly clear.The smoke dissipated into the vacuum and the soon the crates and boxes in the crowded bay came into view.More of the Reds came out and took a look around.They had won.***Gavin came into the sleeping quarters finally, drenched in sweat."Theres no sight of the Frigate," he said wearily, "I think I lost them.""Its a good thing," Jeff said grimly, "We couldnt have taken another attack.""How bad is it?"Gavin asked."Not half as bad as it could have been," Jeff answered."Four of our guys are dead, five wounded.""Whos dead?"Gavin asked.Jeff paused, "Harrison, Caldwell, Porty, and Fredricks.""And the wounded?""Calvin, Frank, Denz, and Javier had mostly cuts and scrapes," Jeff answered, "Javier is taking care of them.The medical supplies on this ship are pretty good, so they should be better soon.Oh, and Cliff was knocked out when a fuel line exploded and threw him across the bay.That was what all the smoke was.He also got some burns on his hand. ""The hand that was injured in the Soyuz?"Gavin asked."Yeah," Jeff answered, "The blast ruptured the forearm of his suit.We got him into the airlock before his air all leaked out.""Without Cliff, I dont have any idea where were going," Gavin sighed."Hopefully well be able to wake him up soon," Jeff said."And, Jeff," Gavin asked."How many of the Jaka were there?""Ten.Theyre all dead."***Everyone on the Shark, minus a few of the wounded, stood assembled in the right hand equipment bay.The Soyuz had crashed into this bay months ago, and it was the same bay that the Jaka shock troops had boarded.Joe and Javier stood at the edge of the open bay door with everyone else standing in a semicircle.They turned to four motionless shapes on the bay floor.Each of the four dead crewmembers lay there peacefully, wrapped in blankets.Cliff walked over to the still shape of Fredericks and fastened a photo to him.It was the one of Fredericks and his military unit.They had fought together against the Purple Men on Earth.Fredericks had been one of the few of his platoon to survive that battle."Well, now youll be with your friends again," Cliff said quietly.Jeff motioned to Joe and Javier.Everyone stood at attention.Then the dead were pushed out into space."Goodbye Harrison, Caldwell, Porty, and Fredricks," Gavin said slowly," Lets remember what they died for."The men paused in silence and bowed their heads."Alright," Jeff said, "Lets go.Those men wouldnt want us to just sit around when there are still Purple Men around.Let's get 'em. "3Life in Mitchell, South Dakota, had been pretty normal until a huge gray object blasted overhead about three hundred feet high.The roar broke windows and set off car alarms for blocks in either direction.Boiling heat waves rolled off the smooth, angled sides of the craft and a dull red glow came from three engine nozzles in the back.The citizens of Mitchell had seen news footage and instantly recognized the alien vessel.A quick phone call had the National Guard on its way.***Gavin grimaced and gave the lever another pull.Sweat was dripping off his forehead and his arms felt like they would fall off.He could hear Jeff cursing in the other compartment between Cliffs shouted orders."Slow down!"Cliff yelled.Jeff jumped to a pipe that controlled a different valve and starting spinning the large, heavy metal wheel."Up..."Jeff groaned as he pulled the wheel around again and again."Slow DOWN!""About a hundred feet to go!""Slower!""Up!Give me everything you got!"Gavin yanked a lever back, flipped a couple switches, and grabbed a wheel in either hand and started spinning them.The nose of the Pinak rotated upward a little."Just get the main engines," Gavin yelled to Jeff, "Ill control side to side motion. "Jeff clambered back and eased a control handle forward.With the nose pointed up, the main engines at the back of the ship roared to life, lurching the ship upwards, and slowing its descent.Dirt and smoke blasted outward from where the exhaust and flame struck the ground.The Pinak slowly came down, still traveling forward at a good rate, and the back end of the lower hull scraped against the ground.Dust and dirt rolled outwards as the Pinak slowed down.The nose came down and touched the ground, and a grinding sound came from the ship as the metal hull scraped against the farmland, and the ship finally came to a halt.The dust started settling, but the ships engines still blasted dirt behind it and into the air."Cut the engines!"Cliff yelled excitedly, "Were down."Gavin and Jeff let out a sigh of relief as they proceeded to shut off all the equipment.Gavin chuckled as he climbed up into the cockpit.Cliff unbuckled his seat belt and ran back through the ship, yelling excitedly."We did it, guys.We made it!"Mabok opened his eyes and looked out the window.They had come to a complete stop.Relief came over his face and he released his grip on the chair.***Calvin Schmitts old farm truck slid to a stop on a road near the resting alien ship.He grabbed his rifle and jumped out of the truck, jogging over to the ship grimly.The ship was creaking and popping, with heat waves still coming off.He raised his gun to aim at the top of the craft as a hatch eased open and then fell on the top of the hull with a clang and puff of dust.A man appeared in the hatchway, wearing alien clothing.The man let out a whoop and a laugh.Then he turned and spotted Calvin standing there with his rifle.Calvin tensed up, and clicked the safety off.The man on top of the ship slowly raised his hands."Im a friend," Cliff said from his perch, "And Im coming down.""Take it slow, pal," Calvin cautioned."Sure thing."Cliff climbed down the handholds on the sloping side of the Pinak, jumped to the ground, and then turned around, raising his hands again."Im human, buddy," Cliff said with a smile, "Im no Purple Man.""I see that," Calvin said, lowering his gun, but still aiming at Cliff from the hip."Whats going on?""Well," Cliff started, and then glanced back at the ship as Jeff started down the side of the ship, "Itll take too long to tell you everything."Calvin gestured toward Jeff with his gun."Is he human?""Yeah," Cliff answered quickly, then paused, "Um, by any chance do you have a phone?"***Grange took his seat on the stage next to an Air Force General.Soon the President was at the podium, and the reporters became quiet."I have the privilege to announce today," began the President, "That this nations armed forces have conquered the last enemy base in New Mexico. "The reporters in the audience broke out into a maddening applause.When the cheering died down, the President continued."The Army broke through the last enemy resistance earlier this morning and stormed the inside of the enemy fort.My congratulations to the Army and the Air Force, and all our fighting men.The long ordeal is now over. "The President paused and took a drink of water from a cup under the podium."Also, I am pleased to announce that three of our nations astronauts, with the help of Russian equipment and ground personnel, have succeeded in capturing, and landing, an enemy warship.The lone alien on board was apprehended.Our scientists and technical personnel are analyzing the ship and it should provide us with many answers.And now, if you have any questions. "The President pointed towards a reporter, who just started to speak when Gavin turned off the television.He was glad that he wasnt in the press conference.He had gotten all the attention he needed from the reporters, and was happy for the moment that they didnt know his whereabouts.Jeff was also in the hotel room, sitting on the bed.He was obviously deep in thought."Jeff," Gavin said, looking at his watch, "Im supposed to go help interrogate the Purple Man prisoner in a little while.Do you want me to pick up anything to eat?"Jeff looked up and let out a breath."Yeah, Id sure like some regular food. "He leaned back."Get some hamburgers, if you want.""Sure.""And maybe a paper, too.Id like to see my picture."Gavin laughed and grabbed his jacket."Alright, Ill be back in a few hours."***Gavin walked into the small, bleak room and sat down at a table across from Mabok, who looked dismal.Gavin could hear a TV somewhere.Then all was quiet as the guard shut the door and locked it.Mabok looked up and saw Gavin.He was relieved that it was just Gavin.Most of the other Reds would look at Mabok and make faces of disgust and hate.Gavin handed Mabok a hamburger, who eyed it warily, but started to eat it.He was getting more used to Red food."What is your name?"he finally asked Mabok."Mabok.""I am called Gavin by your people," Gavin said, holding out his hand.Mabok looked at Gavin, and then stared at his outstretched hand with confusion."You are the one called Gavin?""Yes," Gavin answered.He lifted Maboks hand off the tabletop and put it into his, showing how to give a handshake."That is how you know the language," Mabok exclaimed, "You were our prisoner.""Thats right," Gavin answered."How did you escape from our base?"Mabok asked."I didn't escape," Gavin said quietly, "I was rescued by my people.We've taken all of your bases.""Where are the rest of my comrades?"Mabok asked.Gavin looked down and didn't answer.Mabok knew what that meant."Do you like the food?"Gavin asked as he took out another hamburger and began to eat."No," Mabok answered, "You dont like this, do you?"he asked as he pointed disgustingly at the half eaten hamburger.It was from a greasy fast food restaurant nearby."No," Gavin said with a laugh."I dont like it much either. ""Why havent you killed me already?"Mabok asked."Why do you think we are feeding you these?"Gavin asked jokingly as he pointed to the hamburger."Mine is starting to kill me already. "Gavin held his stomach with one hand and tossed his own hamburger in the trashcan with the other.Mabok looked at Gavin and burst out laughing.It was the first time he had laughed in a long time."I will perform forced labor then.""No.""Then why am I here?""We want to understand more about you," Gavin explained, "but we wont kill you and you wont be made to work.We have laws that guarantee that."Mabok paused silently.The Reds didn't seem to be savages like Kropan had said.They just seemed like regular people.Why did this war get started anyway?Because of it, all of his comrades were dead.He felt very alone.He couldnt talk to anyone, except for this one Red.Mabok said finally, "All of the others wish I was dead.I did not do anything to them.I only defended myself.""They hate you because you are a Purple Man and your people killed so many of us," Gavin said."I didnt kill anyone personally," Mabok answered."What some of the Jaka do is not accepted by all of us.Your people killed many of mine also.""I personally didnt kill any of your people either," Gavin answered.Mabok didnt say anything."We all make mistakes," Gavin said, "Its too bad that so many had to die, but I lost some good friends too, you know.At least now it is all done.I wish we could get you home now that your people have been defeated and the war is over.""My people may have been defeated, but the war is not over!"Mabok said.Mabok was cut short by the guard, who opened the door and nodded to Gavin."Time," the guard said curtly."Just a second," Gavin said, motioning for the guard to wait."Come on buddy," the guard cut in, "the doors are closing pretty soon here.You dont want to stay the night here do you?"Gavin gave in and let the guard pull him outside.***Jeff and Cliff looked up from the TV as Gavin walked into the hotel room."Heres dinner, guys," Gavin said and tossed wrapped hamburgers to the other two."Thanks," Cliff said and turned off the TV."You know," Gavin said as he sat at the small table, "I had an interesting talk with the Purple Man.""Did he say why all of the Purple guys had a thing for killing Earthlings?"Jeff asked."He told me he had nothing to do with that," Gavin answered."I expected him to say something like that," Jeff grumbled."When I talked about the war being over," Gavin told them, "he acted surprised, like he didnt think it was. ""Hey, you should try the milk shakes, theyre good," Cliff said and pulled a shake out of the paper bag."Maybe he knows something that he's not saying.What did the military say about that?"Jeff asked."Well," Gavin answered, "the general I spoke to afterwards was too busy to listen to what I was saying.By the way, were supposed to fly to South Dakota tomorrow to help work on the ship.Were leaving at seven.We will be helping the scientists figure out the ship.""In that case Ill be going to bed," Cliff said, tossing the food wrappers in the trash."See you in the morning."***Mabok sat up in bed.He was having trouble sleeping in the gravity of a planet.He wasnt used to it.Fortunately, the night was almost over.Light was starting to come through the window.He had decided to try and sleep some more when a Red policeman barged in and dragged him out of bed.Then he was taken to some kind of vehicle under guard.Mabok sat in the seat of the vehicle, handcuffed, for many hours as it sped along a road.He watched the strange landscape of a different world slide by out of the window.The plants and animals interested him most.His own planet didnt have wild animals.After a while he dozed off.Mabok felt the vehicle slow down and heard the Reds talking quietly.He opened his eyes.They were driving through a town.Buildings lined the street and he caught glimpses of Reds walking by.Mabok saw a large photo of a man fastened to a pole as they drove by.The man in the photo was young and wore a military uniform.Flowers were placed all around the picture.He realized what it must be.Too many people had died on both sides.Their families would never see them again.He thought of how much he missed his own family.He thought of his own dead comrades and how sorrowful their families would be.It had all happened because a few Oligarchs cared little for the suffering of others.After all this, he would never fight for the Oligarchs again.He wanted to be back home.As the vehicle drove through flat farm fields, Mabok looked up and saw his Pinak resting on the ground with clusters of huts and lights around it.It was the only thing on this whole planet that could take him back home.***After a long wait, Mabok was taken out of the vehicle and into a trailer.A guard named Wes had been escorted him during the journey.Wes looked young to Mabok and reminded him of some friends he had as a teenager on his home planet.The guard said something and led Mabok into a room.Gavin was already inside, relaxing in a chair."How was the trip?"Gavin asked."Very long," Mabok answered, and then quickly got to the point."Gavin, I want to go talk.I want to go home."Gavin looked at him with a blank expression."I wish you could," he said finally."There is a way for me to get home," Mabok said."How?""I will help you if you help me," Mabok began, "How long has it been since you first boarded the ship?"Gavin casually looked at the date on his watch."Eighteen days.""The Jaka will be expecting to communicate with the colonists here on the twenty first day.When they dont receive any message, they will be suspicious.If they follow normal procedure, a large force will arrive at the Jukath in about ten more days to investigate," Mabok said, "There will be ten times as many ships and men as before.If they can get to your planet, it will be the beginning of the end."After so long trying to get information in vain, Gavin almost fell out of his chair at this sudden flood of words."What?"was all he could force out of his mouth.Mabok explained it again."The Jukath?"Gavin asked."The travel stop, or way station," Mabok explained."All you have to do is destroy the way station.Space transports travel along what is called an Ion Course between star systems.If the way station, or Jukath, is destroyed, the Ion Course is disabled, and the transports must stop until repairs to the way station are made.Traveling the same distance without using the Ion Course in ships like our Pinak would take months.By destroying the Ion Course, you can delay the fleet a few months.If you dont destroy the way station, the fleet will arrive at the way station in a week.Traveling from the way station to this star system will only take a few days after that."For your help, I will tell you how to stop the fleet from getting to Earth.You cant stop them from coming here unless you destroy the Jukath.It is outside of this star system, and the only way to get out that far is in the Pinak.""So, we can only get there in your ship," Gavin said, still somewhat dazed, but catching on."Why are you telling me this?
