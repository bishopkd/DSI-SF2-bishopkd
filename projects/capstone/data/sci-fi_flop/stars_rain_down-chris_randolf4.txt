I could be wrong, but it seems shes trying to get your attention.Another moment later, a path along the floor lit up, leading from his disc to a spot in the middle of the second tier.The message was pretty obvious.Dont do anything stupid, Juliette said.He slowly walked the path and the disc followed.Stupid has gotten us this far.If this turns bad, keep everyone together and find a way out.He was filled head to toe with foreboding, but he knew he was meant to be here.He was willing to see where faith would take him.As he walked, familiar shapes bubbled out of the floor and ceiling, formed from the same glistening white material.They were reminiscent of consoles and duty stations, just above waist height and perfectly positioned for a standing person.With every step, more of these things appeared, like a garden suddenly touched by Spring.When he reached the spot marked for him, a circular hand rail formed around him like a cage, while a chair came up and gently cradled his body.A cylinder emerged from the ceiling, then a smaller one telescoped from inside it, and a third after that.The last cylinders surface peeled open, and a flattened arm reached down out of the hole.It was curved like a scorpions tail and tipped with a yellow device the size of a fist whose flat surface bristled with metallic quills.The whole setup was eerily similar to a dentists chair.Marcus?Faulkland asked.The cowboy was cautious.Marcus should have been terrified, but he wasnt.Faith, was all he said, and he tried to relax.The scorpion tail curled around and examined him from one side and then the other.It fluidly swooped in and examined a spot on his right temple.Then it pulled back and struck.There was a sharp pain, like a spike of hot metal had been driven through his head.For a moment, he thought he was screaming and then all was silent.Everything was blanketed in perfect silence.Stars.The stars were everywhere, like a hundred billion onlooking eyes, pin pricks in an infinite sheet of blackness.There was nothing but emptiness there, and Marcus had never felt such freedom before.Such peace.He was at home.He floated there in the dark waiting for what he knew was coming.He was the forerunner, and in another moment the rest of his fleet would begin to appear all around him.The other ships.The others like himself.He was a ship?He was momentarily lost, confused, unsure of who or what he was.Then she was sure.Of course she was a ship, a great and powerful vessel.She was the pride of the Eireki fleet.All around, her countless brothers and sisters arrived to fill the void, and joined their voices in a song of light.She was the queen of that light.Its keystone.Its source and destination.She was the light of stars that danced in the dark of night, and the song of creation that stood before the destroyer.Her lover came up beside her, the prince of her race who so often wandered the void in solitude.He radiated sadness and sorrow for the destruction soon to come, and for the peace they had failed to attain.The chance for peace was gone.Now was the time for war.She bowed to him and pressed forward, and her fleet raced to match.A trillion of her kind cut through the emptiness, blotting out the distant stars and carrying the entirety of the Eireki species aboard them.The Eireki who were creators and protectors, who filled her with love and life and purpose.They filled her with strength unimaginable.She and her crew, bonded through their thoughts, were one.The enemy also rode in force, and she could feel their blight in the distance.They were the dark and twisted Nefrem.The so called chosen children.They were destroyers, who existed only to devour and pervert the light.Side by side, the legion of ships and their Eireki crews awaited the coming of the darkest one.The source of the destroyers.Their mother.Their living planet.And then the enemy came, its arrival thundering across all of creation.The queen of the light bid her fleet to wait, and hide in the shadow of a gas giant.They would attack with the rising sun.So it unfolded.The glow and warmth of the sun crested the horizon and the Eireki rode into battle.Two surging waves of ships clashed in a rain of furious, burning light, painting the void in rent flesh and the blood of the fallen.There was death as never before, perhaps as never would be again, leaving both forces annihilated.When the firing stopped, there remained only two combatants: the vast crimson living planet, and she, the Eireki flagship in vivid green.She kept her distance, firing on her enemy with beams that shredded space and time with their fury.It wasnt enough.The flesh of the enemy absorbed her fire, and retaliated in kind.Dancing in the dark of night, she avoided reprisal and sang her song of destruction, raining hell down upon the living planet and expending everything she had.Still, it wasnt enough.There wasnt enough power in the universe.Then, her Eireki crew conceived of a desperate plan.An unthinkable plan.She refused to comply, but they insisted that their lives didnt matter.Nothing could matter except stopping the Nefrem.If they failed, all life would suffer for eternity.Reluctantly, she accepted.She wheeled about and charged at full speed, her weapons blazing a path before her.She entered the zone of the living planets influence, and its tireless psychic scream burnt the minds of her crew.There was no time to mourn.She pressed forward and howled the secret name of death, firing straighter than before.She struck the enemy hard.Her whole body rocked from the impact but she continued on, and pressed the living planet backward, back into the gas giant, back into the waiting star seed.Then she fired as she never had, pouring energy beyond comprehension into her foe.Her hollow drives burst under the immense strain, one after another shattering in a fitful luminescent gasp until only one remained.Then the gas giant ignited, and its shock wave flung her to safety.She had done it.She birthed an artificial star, a fusion furnace that would burn for sixty five million years, with the last of the Nefrem and their living planet trapped within.It was a prison from which they couldnt escape.The star would hold them and blind their eyes until it burned out.She scanned inside herself for any signs of life, but there were none.The last of the Eireki were dead, as were all the other ships.She was alone.Empty.Still, there was one task left to complete.Using the last of her stored energy, she traversed the gulf between stars and arrived at a system whose existence had been carefully concealed from the Nefrem since the beginning of time.Within this system lay the gardena miraculous world so very much like the lost Eireki homewhich had been chosen to serve a new purpose.A noble purpose.On that planet, balance would be restored and the Eireki would rise anew.From the ashes would evolve a better, stronger Eireki, capable of defeating the Nefrem once and for all.Wounded, tired and limping, she looked down on the radiant green and blue planet, and asked forgiveness for the crime she was about to commit.Within her, the golden codex fulfilled its purpose: it adapted countless gene sequences to an eons long program, imprinted them onto a biomechanical seed and spat it at the peaceful planet below.The seed struck hard, raising inky clouds across the globe.The destruction would bring about change and new growth, while the retroviruses it dispersed became the seeds of resurrection.It was done.Now she could sleep and dream and wait for the children of the Eireki to wake her.She could sleep for sixty five million years.Sixty five million years.Sixty five million years.Marcus?Hes talking.Thank God.You son of a bitch.I thought we lost you.She opened her eyes and tried to focus.She was confused, not sure of who or what she was.Then he knew.He knew precisely what was going on.He took a deep breath as the image came into focus, and he looked at the Eireki dressed in strange suits and helmets all around him.Juliette St.Martin was hovering above him, giving him a thorough, almost frantic, examination.Hes coming around.I want you to focus on me.Thats good.Tell me your name.There was a pressure on the side of his head.He reached up and found a device attached to his temple.It was hard and smooth, but warm.It belonged there.Juliettes eyes were full of concern.Can you tell me who you are?After a moment, he smiled and said, My name is Marcus Donovan, and I am Eireki.Chapter 16:  Legacy  Hes delirious.St.Martin to Shackleton, prep the medical bay for surgery.Donovans been compromised by some kind of alien parasite.Were en route now.Roger that, Doctor.Preparation under way.Marcus was still sitting in the molded white seat, and he wasnt sure how long hed been out.His head was swimming like hed just woken up from a fevered dream.Intense images and feelings flashed behind his eyes, but they were slowing down and coming less frequently.Meanwhile, Juliette was not so gently trying to pull him to his feet.Nonsense.Shackleton, belay that order, he said, and pushed her away.Im fine.Damn you, Marc, its in your brain!That should have bothered him more, and he knew it.Hell, he could hardly stand getting a flu inoculation, yet here he was with an alien machine plugged directly into his grey matter and it was all okay.The ship assured him it was perfectly safe and necessary.Its okay, Juliette.Its an interface, nothing more.It allows me to communicate with the ship.He pulled up memories that werent his own, recollections of when the device was first designed and tested.The feeling was indescribably strange.The interface was originally manufactured errr, grown I guess, as an emergency fall back in case something interfered with telepathy.Our species has deficient receptor organs, so I needed it to make contact.The ship told you this?Rao asked.More or less.The process felt completely intuitive, yet words were failing him.It was like trying to describe color to the blind.I dont hear voices or anything.I get ideas and feelings from her, and memories.Damn, the memories are something else.Part of the device wriggled inside his head, and he convulsed.The spasm was slight, like a nervous tick, but it was nonetheless unpleasant.Jeee zus, Faulkland said.Youre a mess.Juliette pulled a hypodermic needle out of her pack.If you wont come willingly, well take you by force.God only knows what that things doing to you, Marc.Two crewmen flanked her as she spoke.I wouldnt do that, Marcus said, and the ship agreed.A pair of ropey tendrils emerged from the ceiling and lowered towards the crewmen.He told the ship that wouldnt be necessary, and the tendrils paused, then slowly receded.Believe me when I say this: shell be very, very displeased if Im sedated against my will, and we dont want to make her angry.Just trust me a little, Juliette.He gave her a reaffirming nod.Trust me.Juliettes brow furrowed and her jaw tightened as she considered Marcus plea.She finally waved the crewmen away and they stood down.Fine.But I dont like it.Of course not.Youre a good doctor.I need you to keep an eye on this thing, alright?Check for signs of rejection.An adverse reaction could kill me.He could feel that the ship liked Juliette, and he smirked.So do I, he accidentally said aloud.Faulkland leaned over the circular railing with an unusually large smile on his face.He was loving every minute of this.So, we should all get used to you being double extra crazy?God, I hope not.As if on cue, the devices tendrils moved inside his skull again and he jerked.Just need a little time to acclimate.How long was I out, anyway?Juliette had her medical probe drawn and was scanning the side of his head.About thirty seconds from when it struck to when you started talking.You were in REM sleep.Marcus said, Felt like days.The ship informed him that the battle he experienced took several days to complete.I guess that makes sense, he replied, then shook his head as he realized he was speaking aloud again.It was going to take some getting used to.Juliette finished her examination with a sigh, and finally stepped back.Everything seems alright.Theres a little bit of inflammation around the wounds, but nothing serious.Less than Id expect, in fact.Let me know immediately if it starts to itch or burn.Will do, Marcus said with a sigh, glad to have a little space to breathe again.It was bad enough having someone new in his head, let alone being poked and prodded like a lab rat.His gaze swept the rest of the room, and the place was now familiar, all except for the thirty some odd Eireki milling around in pressure suits.That was a little out of the ordinary.He called up memories of the room, and the ship responded with the different configurations it could assume.The variety was staggering.He selected one with an abundance of the molded seats, and the room shifted to accommodate.Care to have a seat?The crew responded with understandable caution.The ship informed him that many were terrified and vividly imagined arms pinning them down and jamming bugs into their heads.He made a mental note about establishing some sort of privacy policy.At ease, folks.Shes not gonna bite.She wont do anything to you against your will, and shes frankly having enough trouble dealing with one of these things right now, he said while tapping the device on his temple.I called up the chairs because its awkward being the only person in a room sitting.No one sat down.Marcus stood instead and allowed the chairs to melt back into the floor.Rao was staring at him, and looked to be a thousand leagues deep in thought.If he werent wearing a helmet, hed undoubtedly be stroking his week old beard.Question, Jay?Too many to count.How about this what the hell happened when you touched the generator?She was asleep and had been for a very long time.When I touched the hollow drive, it jumped to max output and woke her up.She flew into a panic, like waking up from a nightmare with your heart pounding.If she was asleep, Juliette asked, how did the doors and tubes work?Reflex.Its by design.If shes incapacitated, her crew would still be able to navigate the ship and escape if necessary.Alright, Rao said, and she brought us here to latch that thing to your head?Thats part of it.She wanted a good look at the invaders, to determine if we were hostile.Once she realized who we are, she made contact through the device.Who we are?Whats that supposed to mean?Marcus took a moment to collect his scattered thoughts, and put them in order.Bits and pieces of history were streaming into him, but whole massive swaths were mysteriously missing.The ship was forgetful, and he hoped it was just that she was still waking up, but she offered no explanation.Right.Theres a really long answer to that question, but the short version is uhhh were aliens?Confused faces all around said hed need to come up with a slightly longer answer.Alright, lets try the story book version.Once upon a time, there was a civilization that had stretched itself across the entire galaxy.They called themselves Eireki, and they were peaceful, enlightened creatures, who communicated with each other through telepathy.They were also masters of technology, able to manufacture intelligent living machines like this ship.There was a step in the sequence which Marcus couldnt piece together, and every attempt to get hold of it left him empty handed.He went on.For the longest time, they believed they were alone in the universe.They found other planets with strange and wonderful life, but none of it was intelligent.Not yet at least, so the Eireki became stewards, fostering life wherever they found it in hopes of one day meeting creatures like themselves.That was until the Nefrem arrived the enemy.There was something wrong or missing there, too.He couldnt pin point what it was, but it just didnt feel right.The Nefrem came from outside the galaxy in a living planet that was both their ship and breeding ground.They were twisted demons who devoured life.They absorbed new gene sequences, keeping whatever was valuable and discarding the rest, while recycling the flesh itself into their own perverted idea of order.As you mightve guessed, war erupted between the Eireki and Nefrem.It was savage and bloody, and stretched on for millennia.Both sides grew stronger, angrier and more effective through the conflict, and by its end, they were shattering whole planets in their efforts to exterminate one another.The war finally came to a head with a single cataclysmic battle which involved the entirety of both races and their trillions of warships.The fighting was fierce and laid waste to the system where it was fought.When the smoke cleared, the only survivors were this ship and the Nefrems living planet.Nemesis.The remaining Eireki knew that approaching the living planet meant death, since it produced a like, a psychic signal that destroyed Eireki minds.They had no choice, though, so they charged the living planet and pushed it backward into a gas giant.Then the ship fired until the gas giant erupted into an artificial star.And the demons were destroyed?Faulkland asked.No.I know this sounds impossible, but it was only a prison.The Nefrem technology was capable of channeling and redirecting the stars energy into a protective shell.I dont really understand it, but shes confident they survived, trapped and dormant all this time, and will survive the stars eventual collapse, as well.Which leads to the us being aliens part.The Eireki knew the Nefrem would eventually break free and begin their conquest all over again, so as their dying command, they sent the ship on a final mission.Theyd found a planet uncannily like their own homeworld, which they kept secret from the Nefrem.They called it the Garden.It had abundant life of its own, and the Eireki thought it a strong candidate to eventually produce its own intelligent life, but they couldnt take any chances with the future.They sent the ship to break their most sacred law and seed the planet with their own genetic material.And youre telling us that this Garden is Earth, Juliette said.Yep.And were the Eireki reborn.Then why arent we telepathic?So we could fight the living planet, Marcus said.Telepathy was an amazing boon to the Eireki people, but it also became their greatest weakness.They couldnt even approach the enemy because of it.The ship claims there have been unexpected side effects, though.They never had culture anything like ours, for instance.Wait, Professor Caldwell said.Hed been listening intently the whole time, but the story was just now beginning to click for him.When you came around, you said sixty five million years.Are you telling me this ship caused the K T Extinction Event?Spot on.Shes not proud of it, but there was no choice in the matter.It was done with a high velocity orbital weapon that choked our atmosphere, and infected whatever survived with retroviruses.The rest is history.And the ship?Came here, wrapped herself in a cocoon and slept away the eons, waiting for us to reclaim her.Ive never been a fan of exogenesis theories, Juliette said, but at least you didnt tell me alien astronauts built the pyramids.Marcus laughed.Youre all taking this surprisingly well.Faulkland slapped him on the back.Pal, were inside a living spaceship that can read our minds.You could tell us this things made of delicious marshmallow floating in a giant cup of cocoa, and I dont think anyone would bat an eye.Its a little disappointing, Professor Caldwell said, I mean, its all fantastic beyond belief.Dont get me wrong.But my entire career is about piecing together theories about ancient peoples.Instead, all the answers have been laid out on a silver platter.I dunno, Rao said, its like a time capsule.A message in a bottle from the ancient past.Thats pretty exciting in its own right.Besides, we still have plenty to learn about the ship.And think of where she can take us, of what cultures weve yet to meet.Raos eyes were full of stars.I suppose youve got a point there, Caldwell said.Faulkland dramatically coughed into his hand.Excuse me, but am I the only one wondering about the dark, evil space demons?And what the hell is this room, anyway?This room, Marcus said, is the bridge.As he spoke, the walls faded from white to black, and then lit up with the stars and asteroids all around them.The shiny metallic Shackleton was visible, floating a safe distance away.The image all around was crystal clear and perfect, just like being out in space except without a bulky helmet to get in the way.Everyone was taken aback, and several stumbled and fell over.Hot damn, Faulkland said.Thats one hell of a view.Rao climbed back up to his feet shakily.Youve got to warn people before you do these things, Marc.Sorry, Marcus said with a smirk.As for the Nefrem, the ships still updating her star charts, trying to determine just how long shes been out.If everything went according to plan, though, we should have plenty of time to gather a fleet and give them a proper howdy doo.A memory suddenly surged through Marcus mind, and he assumed it was the ships doing.The memory was vivid, like being back there again.He and his family were standing on the porch, taking turns looking through the rusty, old telescope his uncle had given him.There was a fantastic light show.Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, had exploded into a multicolored eye shaped burst as bright as the full moon.The next day, they could still see it in broad daylight, and it continued that way for two years.The memory faded and Marcus stumbled to the side.Oh damn, he said, estimates were off.We were slow.And the demons are free, Faulkland guessed.Marcus said, Sirius B.  That was what, twenty five years ago, right?A little more, Rao said, plus eight point six light years.Thirty four years, all told.The words struck him, and the ship started to assimilate the new information.They were behind schedule, he knew that much, and the ship was busy estimating how badly.After a moment, she began to fill him in on Nefrem tactics.The Nemesis would require two to three years just to resume normal functioning after its release, at which point it would still be too weak for interstellar travel.It would enter emergency resource acquisition mode.Scouts would be constructed and sent to locate nearby accumulations of life, followed by fleets that would strip and return digestible biomass.The process would continue until the living planet was at nominal strength, with no fewer than three full battle fleets.That could take anywhere from ten to forty years, depending on the population of nearby stars, and after that, real conquest would begin.Ive got good news and bad news, Marcus said.The bad news is that theyre definitely free, and we have no way of knowing how many planets have already fallen.The good news is that their living planet wont be at full strength yet.Not like it was during the war, at least.More of a big living asteroid.Will they come for Earth?Faulkland asked.Should we be mounting defenses?Marcus shook his head.No, they wont be coming here.Shes pretty certain of that.As far as they know, our system is dead and insignificant.Its like a hypnotic suggestion.Theyll eventually see through it, though, and we must have them on the defensive before that happens.If they get here, itll already be too late.Its imperative that we get the ship back in working order as soon as possible.There should be enough raw material here in the asteroid belt to make repairs.Then we return to Earth and start building our own fleet.All life in the galaxy depends on it.Do you know how to do any of that?Juliette asked.Marcus shook his head.Not exactly, but well figure it out.The ship told him theyd figure it out together, then she passed another message that Marcus thought strange.It was a request.Shes digging around in my head, trying to get a hang on how we process thoughts.Our language, the syntax and ways we name things.Its all messy and very new to her.She she wants me to give her a name.Go ahead, Faulkland said.Ive always had a weakness for girls names, myself.Rao looked at Marcus seriously.Something better than Zebra One, this time.Marcus ran through a string of girls names, but none of them seemed appropriate.This ship was more than just a vessel.She was a remembrance of things forgotten.She was a gift and a responsibility handed down from the past.Then the name came to him.Its only right to call her Legacy.Legacy approved.Chapter 17:  Survival  What struck Jack in the first week following the invasion was the quiet.Not silence, but the serene quiet of wilderness in the absence of man.It was the quiet of civilizations demise.It took a little time to set in.At first, the sound of alien craft filled the air, while ground troops overran the ruins and rounded up the last survivors.Then, after less than a week, there was nothing and no one left.With their task complete, the bastards withdrew and left nothing behind but the piles of dead, the unsettling quiet and the furious howling of the dust filled wind.As the second week began, the next thing that struck Jack was the smell.Although his gas mask kept the dust out of his lungs, it did little to obscure the stench of death.He wouldve done anything to get that smell out of his nose, but there was simply no escape.At least they were in sparsely populated rural areas; he didnt dare imagine what the cities were like.The invaders were still on Earth, though.That much was certain.The cycling sound of their cuttlefish craft occasionally sounded high overhead, but they never came down.They never bothered.They had better places to be than in that stinking wasteland.China was defeated, and held no more mystery for them.No more resistance.The enemy had exclusively targeted humans, killing them and moving on, never staying longer than it took to perform the extermination.This turned out to be a boon to Jack and his makeshift team.While buildings of every kind had been laid to waste, vehicles, roads and bridges were left untouched.Food was easy enough to find and quite a few places still had water pressure.Fuel cells were scattered everywhere amongst the rubble, whole and functioing thanks to their crash proof casings.On the eighth day, while the team sat on the edge of yet another ruined village, Jack decided time had come to find transportation.Anyone know how to hot wire a car?He still didnt know his new corpsmen from Adam.They were jumpsuits and gas masks with nametags, and nothing more.That wouldve been unacceptable at any other point in his career, but no one was feeling particularly social.One of the jumpsuits raised his hand.The tag on his chest said Chase.Jack was a little surprised there was only one, actually.The Corps attracted loads of people with troubled pasts.Good.Nicotine, you and Corpsman Chase head out and find us some wheels.Roger.Whaddya have in mind?A flatbed?Anything with some ground clearance and storage space.Windows intact if you can manage it.Itd be nice to get this mask off for a bit.I suppose a troop transport would be too much to ask.Dream on.Nikitin glanced over at Chase, and gave him a nod.Well see what we can find.Meet you back here in an hour?Thats fine.The rest of us are gonna round up supplies.We passed a promising looking market on the way in.My Chinese isnt too sharp, Albright said, but that looks like a pharmacy over there.Id like to stock up on medical supplies if weve got the time.Make it happen.Jack looked at the other three corpsmen and picked one at random.Take McGrath with you.Roger.Alright.That means Hartnell and Cozar, youre with me.One hour.Get it done.With that, they broke.Jack waved his team on, and they headed back toward the eastern side of the village where hed spotted the market.He kept it well hidden, but he didnt like the ghost towns.He had little problem in the countryside where quiet was to be expected, but walking down abandoned streets in the middle of the day was a whole different matter.A constant feeling of something missing haunted him, like he standing on a stage without actors.The feeling of emptiness was unbearable.The market was a one story that had partially collapsed.Several large woven baskets full of decaying fruits and vegetables sat out front, and as Jack approached the door, the smell of rotting sea food filled his mask.It was something of a welcome change.The inside was dark and musty, and they brought out their flashlights.The pungent smell of mold joined the rotting fish.Water first, then canned foods.Fruits, vegetables, meat.Dried goods are fine.Build a pile by the door, and well load up when Nikitin and Chase find a car.Something made a dull clank on the far side of the room.Did you hear that?one of them asked.Just some rubble falling, the other answered.Jack wasnt so sure.He motioned to stop, then put his finger in front of his mask.Hartnell and Cozar took the hint and quieted down.He pulled the flare gun from its makeshift holster and unlatched the safety.He wasnt confident it would even sting one of the invaders, but it was better than nothing.He hoped it was better than nothing.Another clank sounded, and some cans clattered to the floor.There was the sound of something scurrying.Voices?Jack advanced along one wall and motioned for the others to take the opposite side.Their flashlights danced along shelves as they moved in on the source of the noise.Jack raised his own flashlight with the flare gun at its side and found nothing.He muttered, What the hells going on here?The other two were standing opposite him now, shoulders shrugged and heads on a swivel.What was he missing?There was another sound.Whispering?Does anyone else hear that, or did I pick a bad time to start hallucinating?I hear it, Cozar said.Me too, added Hartnell while she took a step forward.Seems to be coming from the floor, chief.Hard to tell with this damned mask on, though.Jack took a good look at the floor.It was hard to make things out in the circle of his flashlight, so he started scanning around with it.There was a small carpet with a corner raised, and a circular patch of tiles suspiciously free of dust.You may be on to something, Corpsman.He re latched the guns safety and returned it to its holster, then lifted up the carpet.Beneath, he found a rectangular panel with a shiny metal handle.Trap door, he said.I think we have survivors.He didnt want to say it for fear of getting his hopes up, but there it was.Survivors.He hadnt seen anyone alive since the woman on the first day, and he didnt want to think about that.Not ever again, if he could.Hold my flashlight, he said as he shoved it into Cozars hand.Then he grabbed the handle and gave the door a good tug.It was heavier than he expected, but with a little effort, it opened and revealed a short wooden staircase leading into the darkness.Something shifted in the shadows, and Jack heard breathing.He held out his hand and Cozar handed him the flashlight.For a second, he considered pulling the flare gun back out, but decided against it.If they were people, he didnt want to panic them.Panicked people were unpredictable.On the other hand, if this was a trap, he was already screwed.He took two tentative steps into the cellar, and ducked his head down to have a look around.His flashlight swept the small storage room, and what he saw made his breath catch in his throat.A family of six huddled in the cellar, dressed in torn and dirty clothes.They were looking at him with wide eyes like he was the reaper come to claim them.A mother and father, teenage daughter, two sons and an infant.The baby was coughing, and the mother rocked him, whispering something into his ear over and over again.Jack didnt know any Chinese beyond the names of entres, and he even screwed those up half the time.Albright knew a little, but she was elsewhere.Hello?he said.No response.He had another option.The Corps had developed a language so squads from different parts of the world could communicate on some basic level.It had a simple syntax and a small vocabulary, making it easy to learn, but severely limited.A corpsman could tell someone his job or where to go, but describing a movie plot would be next to impossible.The Corps also made an effort to spread pamphlets around and offered free courses, with the goal of making it easier for corpsmen to communicate with refugees.Please be calm  Jack said.Im here to help   The children were sobbing, and their father tried to quiet them.No one reacted at all to what he said.Jack lifted his gas mask and tried again.Im here to help.Do you understand me?Nothing.He wasnt surprised.For all of the Corps efforts, hed never met a single person outside of the Corps who understood it.He thought it was worth a try, though, and suspected the ERC administration felt more or less the same way.Weve got live ones.Hartnell, gather some cloth and water so we can improvise masks.Sunglasses or goggles also if you can find them.It occurred to Jack that the poor folks couldnt see anything but his flashlight.In their position, hed be scared witless too.He slid the flashlights casing back and reconfigured it into a lantern, and the small supply room was filled with dim light.Im here to help, he said in English, and motioned to the ERC patch on his shoulder.Everyone around the world knew the symbol, two hands in a diamond, gripping each other at an angle as if one was helping the other up.The family recognized it, and this time, their reaction was instantaneous.Jack suddenly had two small boys hugging his legs, while the parents began to spew incomprehensible babble at him.The father was motioned to the mother, who in turn was propping up her still coughing infant.Jack didnt understand the words, but the message came through clearly.He removed his work glove and motioned towards the child.The mother nodded, and he reached out and felt its head.He wasnt being particularly scientific, but the baby felt warm to the touch, and its eyes were red.That was enough to tell Jack he was out of his league.Cozar, get Albright and bring her back.Tell her weve got an infant with a fever and a cough.Roger, Cozar said, and he took off running.That was the right reaction.Jack was always glad to see a corpsman pound dirt when given a task.The parents were still heatedly telling him something, and the father was making all kinds of motions with his hands, but the gestures didnt help at all.He hoped whatever they were trying to tell him wasnt too important.He put his hand on the fathers shoulder and said, Its going to be okay, in a reassuring voice.Theres a doctor on the way, and were going to get you out of here.The father didnt understand a word of it, but saying it made Jack feel better.He peeled the small boys from his legs, then crouched down and took a good look at each.Their faces were dirty and they were frightened, but they looked healthy.The younger of the two had a quivering lip, and his eyes were wet with tears.He had to be six or seven years old, and he was trying as hard as he could not to cry.Dont sweat it, buddy, Jack said.Youre both very brave little kids.After what youve been through, youre allowed to cry, okay.It didnt matter that they couldnt understand him.He tousled the boys hair and gave him a pat on the shoulder.The girl was standing in the far corner, shivering and focused on her feet.Jack had done enough rescues to know that was normal, and he also knew better than to bother her.Teenage girls tended to react better to women after trauma, and he decided to leave her be.A minute later, Albright came down the stairs at full sprint with her medkit in hand.She said something in Chinese and went directly to examining the infant.She raised her mask to get a better look, and Jack could see sheer amazement all over her face.It was the face of a lottery winner.Albright always had a special affinity for children, and this put her on top of the world.She learned what she needed quickly then took a look at the other children.Nothing too serious, she said as she worked, The little guys just having a bad reaction to the mold and dust.Should be fine once we get him out of here.Jack breathed a sigh of relief.That was exactly what he needed to hear.He was desperate for a win, and he got one.Can you tell em were bringing a car?Dream on, she said.I know how to say Im a doctor, order the generals chicken, and ask for the toilet, but thats the full extent of my Chinese.Thats okay.Well figure something out, he said.We always do.Hartnell stopped at the top of the steps with her arms full of cloth, water and cheap sunglasses.I got what you asked for, chief.Thats when it happened; Jack was filled with a feeling he hadnt had in more than a week.If these people had survived, then so had others.Possibly many others.He had a reason to be there in that wasteland, and more importantly, he had something to look forward to besides another heap of corpses.He had hope, and it was the single most precious thing in the world.Chapter 18:  The Silk Road  Back when he first saw aliens piling up the dead, Jack retreated.His body was stuck there in the remains of China, but his head ran all the way back home to the comfort of his girlfriends arms, where it stayed while his body persisted on.He did what was necessary to survive, but only in a dim, mechanical daze.He was an animated corpse that had forgotten to fall.Then he found a family of survivors, and everything changed.The discovery filled him with a ray of hope that brought him back to life.From that point on, he was fully charged up and firing on all cylinders because it wasnt just about survival anymore; it was about saving lives, and that meant everything to him.It woke all of them up.Nikitin and Chase returned with a delivery van which had carried more than its fair share of fish, by the smell of things.No one liked the stink, but the vehicle was spacious and all in one piece, so they spent the rest of the afternoon cleaning it up and packing it full of supplies.By the end of the night, the van was stocked with enough food and water for a month, and still had space left over for a makeshift medical bay.The next day, they added two more cars to their collection.The first was a minivan for the family of survivors, retrofitted with a few good layers of grating over its vents.It had all the amenities, including a plush interior and an audio deck loaded full of Chinese pop.The second vehicle was a beaten up and rusty old jeep thatd seen better days.Nikitin was adamant about having an off road vehicle for scouting purposes, and the jeep was the best he could find.Or so he said.Jack suspected Nikitin had a soft spot for beaten up and rusty old jeeps, which he refused to admit to.On the third day, they mounted up and hit the road as the winds began once again to rise.Jack and Nikitin rode ahead in the jeep where they both took a serious sandblasting in the open air.It was worse than theyd expected, and at every stop, they layered on more spare clothing until they both looked like mummies.The extra layers made the ride survivable, if not particularly comfortable.The jeep scouted ahead by a paltry fifty meters most of the time, while the others trundled along behind them with their headlights on.It was slow going at first, but roads proved to be in excellent condition and they picked up speed.They traveled two hundred kilometers in that first week, and Jack suspected they could cover more ground if they wanted to.They stopped to check for supplies and survivors at every settlement and the search was well worth the effort.They found plenty of both, and their small group sprouted into a motorcade.Survivors started coming out to meet them, drawn out of hiding by the sounds of car engines and human voices shouting over the roar.The motorcade swelled into a mass migration in time, their population numbering in the thousands, in a puttering line of cars that stretched across a kilometer of road.Every influx brought another handful of orange jumpsuits, stocked up and ready for duty.Many spoke multiple languages including English, and they found constant work translating.The local guides were also plentiful, although each one delivered the same morbid warning: dont bother with the cities.There was nothing to find there but death.They traveled for more than two straight months past the ruins of towns whose names Jack would never know, at the foot of the great mountains to the North which they only saw in silhouette.Always headed westward, they passed from China to Myanmar, then along the northern border between India and Nepal, and finally through Pakistan where they met up several more groups like their own.As they neared the end of Pakistan, they finally caught sight of a city.Where Peshawar had been, there was a black and still smoking petrified forest, with a thick layer of shattered concrete lining the ground and the twisted steel skeletons of buildings standing in for trees.A power capable of such total destruction was unthinkable.They skirted the edge of the ash heap faster than common sense might have suggested, and as they headed for the mountains, no one bothered to look back.In single file, they entered the Khyber Pass, which Jack had once heard described as a knife wound in the mountains.The words hadnt meant much to him, but they were all too appropriate once he saw the steep gash as if the earth had simply been sliced away.The pass had been used by armies since the beginning of time, and he wondered how it would be remembered from then on, having carried so many survivors away from that terrible destruction.As they emerged on the other side of the mountains, the travelers saw the most wonderful thing theyd ever seen.After more than two months in dust choked twilight, they could finally see the bright blue sky again.They were back on Earth.At the other end of the pass was a village built of sand colored stone which rose up out of the landscape like a natural formation.It was part of the land, and Jack wondered if that was what had spared it from the onslaught.The village was whole, intact and full of people, and along the road stood a handful of soldiers in desert camouflage with assault rifles slung over their shoulders.For the first time Jack could remember, he was glad to see soldiers.Overjoyed, in fact.With the fish van behind him, Jack pulled the jeep over and killed the engine, then he peeled off his gas mask.He took one giant lung full of clean air.Fresh, reasonably dust free air.He held it as long as he could, and the feeling was amazing.As he took the second deep breath, he heard Nikitin doing the same beside him.In another moment, he pulled off all his extra layers and tossed them in the back seat, until he was down to just the jumpsuit.He felt naked, and he was quickly struck by how bad he smelled.I was starting to worry the whole world was choked up with that cloud of shit, Nikitin said.Would you look at this, though.It didnt even make it over the Hindu Kush.Unbelievable, Jack said as he stretched.He felt the overwhelming urge to curl up on the nearest rock and take a long nap.To sun himself like a lizard.A soldier marched up to the jeep.He was a young man, a couple years younger than Jack, but moved like a seasoned veteran.The markings on his uniform were Mashriq Coalition, a union of middle eastern nations that was had helped found the United Earth Organization.The Mashriq Coalition was always fighting separatists somewhere in its territory, and one could always any given soldier had seen his share of action.More orange jumpsuits?The soldier said in disbelief.His English carried the slightest trace of an accent.Every time we think weve seen the last of you, more come through that pass with another pack of refugees.Theyve all been Chinese and Indian, though.Where are you from, my friends?Jack was glad to hear they werent the first group, and he guessed they wouldnt be the last either.Pacific States Alliance, he said, San Jose.Our tranzat went down over Szechuan province, and weve been hoofing it ever since.Youre quite a way from home.Tell me, can anything kill you oranges?Nothing yet, Nikitin said with a smile and they laughed.Jack could always count on Nikitin for bravado, if nothing else.So, where do we go next?Jack asked.He was trying to recall the local organization from his last trip to Afghanistan.Is there a refugee camp in Jalalabad, or do we truck all the way to Kabul?The soldier laughed again.That couldnt be a good sign.Youre a rare one, to be so optimistic after a march through hell.There is no Jalalabad or Kabul.The entire Mashriq is in ruins.The whole world, if what I hear is true.Jack hoped hed somehow misunderstood the soldier.Come on The UEO must be coordinating something.Perhaps I was not clear.The UEO is gone, friend.Everythings been burnt to ash, and theres no one left to run anything.There are only refugees like you and me.Jack felt like he was on the receiving end of a cruel joke.Everything?Europe?North America?Everything.A pair of Blade Valkyries just returned from North America, and they say its the same there as everywhere.Son of a bitch, Nikitin said.Where do we go?Jack asked again, but it was hardly a question.He closed his eyes and saw the ghosts of his life back home, a life that was already dead and gone.His beautiful Jessica was there in the pale light of an approaching storm, waiting for him to come home.Waiting for him to ask a question to which shed already said yes.She told him that she would always be there waiting for him, and he refused to let the promise go.He had survived against all odds, and she must have survived too.Somehow.When he opened his eyes, the ghosts were gone.You have two choices, the soldier said.The first is to head for the North, as many others have.There are rumors of enclaves sprouting up in Russia around their Ark.I wouldnt be surprised to hear the same about the other two, but who knows.The Ark Project had been started a couple decades before, but never totally finished; it turned into such a massive boondoggle that folks wondered if the GAF was running the show.The Arks themselves were huge underground shelters to be used in the event of a planet killer asteroid, each designed to hold a few million people indefinitely.They were located far off the equator to maximize their distance from potential impact zones, or that was the official story, at least.Jack always thought their locations suspect, likely influenced by politics and money.There were three, one each in Russia, Canada and Australia.It made a lot of sense to try and reorganize there.The soldier pointed out across the thousands of cars coming through the pass.Thats what I would recommend for most of them.Theres life there, and maybe some kind of future.And the other option?Nikitin asked.Join our struggle and give the infidels hell.I know that most of you oranges are hard set against violence, but perhaps the situation is different now?I can see that you are survivors, and Im sure your skills would find use.What struggle?Jack asked.You said everythings gone.The soldier laughed yet again.Jack was starting to think that he and the soldier had very different senses of humor.You are so fast to lay down your arms, American.Your people have never been invaded, have they?You see, in my world, invasion is all weve ever known.It is our entire history.First the Greeks, then the Indians, the English, Soviets, Americans, and Indians once again.This land has been invaded a thousand times already, and it will be invaded a thousand more.When the smoke clears and these invaders are gone, who do you think will remain?The soldiers rhetorical question was met with silence, and he smiled.They have taken Africa as their own, and we will force them out however we can.The Mashriq is our front line, and soldiers of every flag are united in the struggle.Mashriq Coalition, your Blade and Carbon corporations, and more Mujahidin than can be counted.UEO and separatists standing together isnt that something?Soon, the oil will begin to flow, and the war will truly begin.Of course, we could always use more help.More help.That phrase made it sound so innocuous, like they needed an extra hand raising a barn or passing out fliers.Still, Jack knew the soldier was right.This wasnt a petty political disagreement.It wasnt a conflict of ideologies.The enemy was here to exterminate the human race, and resistance was the only option.Should you decide to join us, there is an airfield south of Jalalabad that we use.Transports leave everyday.They will take you to our forward base.Jack closed his eyes again, but before he could see the ghosts of his past, his decision was already made.Chapter 19:  The Distant Shore  Midday on Mars.The sun shone brightly, but a sandstorm was brewing on the horizon, hazing the line where dusty ground met rusty sky.Somewhere over that horizon lurked the biggest mountain anyone had ever seen, rising thirty kilometers into the emaciated sky, but no one would ever believe it was a mountain while standing on it.Its body stretched over an area the size of France, with a grade nearly as steep as a wheelchair ramp.Amira Saladin was a teenager the first time she made the trip with her parents.They pointed at the ground and told her she was on the peak of the tallest mountain in the solar system.At the time, she didnt believe a word of it.Fifteen years and more than a dozen return trips later, she still found it difficult to believe.It was a let down, actually.She eyed the approaching storm with a touch of annoyance.Just another beautiful day on the Arcadian Plain.Kazuo Nagais voice came in over her headset.Cry me a river, Sal.You love it out here.I know it, and you know it.Now stop working your jaw and gimme a hand with this.She estimated an hour or more before the storm would hit, time enough to get their work done with ease.She was also pretty sure she outranked Kazuo, so she kept moving at her own leisurely pace.At least, she thought she outranked him.As she watched the coming storm, she wondered if anyone really understood the GAF chain of command.Sal turned back toward the wall of the Ares Colony, where Kazuo was impatiently holding up a half tonne composite steel panel.His powered environment suit, called a MASPEC, made him look like the bastard offspring of a man and a forklift, and the forklift had more dominant genes.Sal made a mental note to do something about the suits aesthetics once she got all the bugs worked out.She marched over and grabbed the other end of the panel, and together they carried it to the side, revealing the bare innards of the atmosphere processor beneath.The compartment was full of ducting and jumbled wires.She hated electronic spaghetti.Remind me to chew out whoever left this mess.Its like they never heard of cable ties.Probably your fathers work.Shut up.Kazuo flicked on his shoulder lamp and hunkered down in front of the compartment.Which board is it?Jay five.The rack with the bright red error light.Im color blind, Sal.Ive told you at least a hundred times.And its funny every single time, she said without malice.Kazuo selected the screwdriver attachment on his wrist tool, and went to work on the screws which held the circuit board in place.Tell me something interesting about Mars, he said while he worked.Sal pulled the replacement board out of her pack.Alright.Did you know that in ancient times, Mars was inhabited by a race of intelligent tiger lizard men?Is that so?Absolute fact.Although their civilization collapsed, a few of them survived into modern times, and around the turn of the century, they assisted human efforts to explore the red planet by wiping off the rovers solar panels at night while the machines were powered down.Amazing, Kazuo said.He handed her the burnt out board, and she gave him the replacement.Now, what exactly is a tiger lizard man?Theyre basically like normal lizard men, but with jaunty stripes and cheerier attitudes.Kazuo gave the replacement board a healthy nudge to make sure it was properly seated, then went about screwing it in.That makes some crazy sort of sense, I guess.Wait Last week, didnt you tell me Mars was originally colonized by little green men with fat heads?There are shenanigans afoot.Sal gave the faulty board a quick once over, looking for any obvious signs of failure like a burnt capacitor, but there werent any.Shed have to take a closer look in the lab once they got back.No shenanigans.The little green men, the Quazlpacti as they were called, were the first to colonize Mars, and they brought the tiger lizards with them as pets.Unfortunately, they didnt foresee the mutagenic plague which, in a fit of poetic justice, turned them into docile pets and the tiger lizards into their cruel masters.
