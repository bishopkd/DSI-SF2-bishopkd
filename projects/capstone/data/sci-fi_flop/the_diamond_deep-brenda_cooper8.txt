I am so pleased to be with you, to be part of this great station.She took a deep breath, watching the faces below her.She kept her voice even.That was a song from our past, a song from before I knew I would be in the generation that came home.Before we knew anything except rumors that our long, long journey could come to an end.Here and there a glass clinked or weight shifted.Now I will sing you a song about coming home.She sang Song of the Seed, drawing out the last chorus:  Together we are a seed Preparing to open in the light Of Adiamo.To flower.Again the audience clapped, and a few called out for favorite songs.This was her moment of truth.A moment to decide.She had written a song about these people.Well, not really.A song for them.A song to show them what they needed to know, to remind them of what they refused to see.She wanted to sing the song for Gunnar Ellensson, whom she had decided was kind and confusing and cruel all at once.The room was full of people with the resources to transform life on the Deep.She hadnt quite finished the song ...but almost.She could do it.A little improv.Maybe sing with no accompaniment since she couldnt give the drummers anything.She stared down at them.Were they ready?Was the song?Was this the place?Her stomach felt cold.She put her head down and her hands down, and then she lifted both again.She cued the drummers to go into a steady beat.Her throat tightened, and her stomach heaved.She realized this might not be recorded.These people might hurt her.They were in a small private place.She bowed her head again.Sorry, she mumbled, and then she began a lullaby from the Fire, a soft, sweet song that left the audience silent for a few breaths before they clapped harder than they had for the first two songs.She felt as if she had failed in spite of the roaring applause that rose up to engulf her.In another venue, if she felt stronger, she might have turned to give them one more song.Instead, she walked off the stage without looking back.64     Allen had finally found a decent live band to play the bar.The threesome played about ten instruments between them, and the girl who sang lead had a high sweet voice.Even though she had none of Rubys power, she was pleasant both to listen to and to watch, and Onor made sure he picked a table where he could see her.The bar was full and loud, and theyd squeezed in two more tables and hired a waitress.Allen noticed him and sent the new girl, Evie, over to take his order.Evie was a dark bit of a girl with a bright smile and an admirable figure, if slightly on the thin side.She recognized him immediately; a good sign.Onor!What can I get for you?How about one of the Deep winesa white, maybe?And some flatbread and fruit.Coming right up!He watched her walk away, wondering if she was much older than Haric.She had the form of a woman, but hed bet she was no more than sixteen.She was probably still in regular school.Well, at least shed be too busy to get in trouble.His drink appeared before his food, and Evie was sharp enough to add water to her tray and then ask him if he wanted it.Theyd had fifty applicants for the job based solely on word of mouth.Apparently they had chosen well.It took longer than he expected for Haric to join him.At least the wine was good.Great, in fact.On the Fire, everything alcohol had been called still, but here there were numerous words for alcohol and smoke and other drugs.It almost seemed that separating things with different names made them more unique, and better.By the time half of the wine was gone, he felt pretty good.The decent singing didnt hurt either.Unwinding had some value to it; he actually couldnt remember the last time he had been able to just sit still.After a while, it seemed hed been sitting too long.Onor had started seriously fidgeting by the time Haric showed up and slid into the seat opposite him.Did you get lost out there?Onor asked.Haric shook his head.Just tired.No work.I asked at four or five places, figuring that ships work would be good.I got as far as taking one test, but I botched it.I just cant get the hang of the tech hereits so subtle.Im not doing much better.Ix is teaching me some, though.I can set you up with a lesson tomorrow.Ill take it.This place makes me feel like an idiot.Well, youre not.Did you see any of our cargo?I walked the whole Exchange twice.Nothing.But I have a plan.Ill put it off a day, for the class.But then I think I need to go.Evie came up, bringing the container to pour Onor more wine and an extra glass for Haric.Haric gave her a broad smile.Thanks, Evie.She gave him a chaste kiss on the cheek, but her eyes held a deeper affection that her actions gave away.Haric sipped from his wine, smiled softly.Thats good.Im glad I chose something youd like.Evie left, and Onor raised an eyebrow at Haric.Ive never seen you flirt before.Haric actually blushed.You do know her?Of course I do.Ive known her since we were all on the Fire.We play games sometimes.Onor refrained from asking what kind of games.Hed been dreaming of Ruby when he was Harics age, and near her all the time without being able to touch her.He did love Marcelle, but nothing had ever erased his adoration of Ruby.If Haric managed better than Onor at the same age, well, that was a good thing.Tell me about your plan.There are other Exchanges.Surely Koren wouldnt be reselling anything of ours in this one.I can get to Exchange Four with a one day ride.I thought Id ask if youd sponsor me on such a trip.All by yourself?Id go with you if I could, but both Joel and Marcelle need me.He started at the table.Its too much risk for you to go alone.Ruby would hate that.Its got to be done, Haric protested.Besides, youre the one who suggested I be sent to look.To our Exchange.So?This one must be like that one.It will only be a two day trip.Where will you sleep?Thats why I need a sponsor.Im pretty sure SueAnne wont let go of enough credit for me to buy a room anywhere.Even though hed championed this trip to Joel and SueAnne, Onor hated the idea now that it was happening.Ill send you credit.Take your slate.Message me when you get there.A big hand clapped Onor on the shoulder, and he turned his head to spot The Jackman and Conroy.HeyI havent seen enough of you two.Buy you a drink?They squeezed two chairs in from a nearby table, the bulk of the two bigger men making Onor feel cramped in spite of how happy he felt to see his old mentors.Haric flagged Evie back over and The Jackman said, I heard you were part owner of this little venture.Onor laughed.A small part.I did some work for Naveen and invested what I earned.The Jackman looked approving.Smart.Hows Daria?Good.Shes making jewelry to take to the exchange, and people are buying.The Jackman had kept the trimmer figure hed developed preparing to fight for Ruby and Joel back on the Fire.Hed grown back the beard, now a scraggly long white river of hair flowing from his chin almost to the middle of his chest.I hear youre still managing drills.Yeahrunning for nothing.I liked it better when there was a cause we could put our fingers on.After Evie took their orders, Conroy made a show of looking around.The bars changed.What do you mean?Onor asked.More people.More strangers, mostly.Its Rubys popularity.There were at least four tablesno, fiveof Deepers.They come here because this is where she comes from.The Jackman shook his head.So shes still making trouble.But he had a smile now when he talked about her.More like saving us from starvation.Strangers coming in means were making credits instead of just moving pieces around.Could be.But every good thing comes with its shadow consequence.The Jackman pointed at the table of outsiders furthest from them.Three men, all decked out in Deeper finery.And with them, three of The Creative Fires young women, leaning on their hands, looking completely star crossed at the handsome Deepers.I dont like seeing that, The Jackman said.Were losing our girls.Haric frowned.Two of my friends left yesterday.They havent come back.Not girls.Boys.They say its too restrictive here.Conroy asked, How did they get away?They kept half their earnings.No way to tell, you know.People have to self report to SueAnne, and hardly any grays trust her.You should, Onor snapped.She works hard.Shes trying to save us, just like Ruby.Maybe we dont want to sit around and let the women do that for us.Maybe we need to make our own names.After two hours of practicing the voice and visual cues needed to make native Deep technology respond well to him, Onor felt drained.Haric held his fingers at his temples and frowned.Onor leaned back in his chair.Were done for now, he told Aleesi.All right.The voice was female.The two AIs had agreed to standardize on one voice eachAleesis that of a young woman, and Ixs a male voice.Did you learn something?Onor asked.Haric nodded.I still dont know that it would be enough for me to pass one of the damned work tests.But I think I could at least access the systems now, and maybe read the questions.Well, thats progress.Ill order some food, and then we need to work on your trip.Haric raised an eyebrow.I was thinking of going to the bar.And looking for Evie?And having a drink.But Harics cheeks turned red.We cant talk with the AIs there.If the Deepers find Aleesi, and take her, theyll also have the copy of Ix weve been retraining.And Ruby will kill us for losing her pet.Besides, Joels going to join us here.Haric leaned back.All right.Order me a glass of wine, then.Onor felt like a miniature version of Joel when he said, Water and a sandwich.I wish our food in here was as good as the food outside.Maybe well open a restaurant after we get the hang of the bar.Onor used his slate to order the food and let Joel know they were ready, then took a closer look at Haric.He must have been working out with Conroy and the others.Or maybe he was just growing up.His shoulders were wider than Onor remembered, and earlier, Onor had noticed he was only a tiny bit taller than Haric.He was sure Haric had been much smaller than Onor on docking day.They sat in congenial quiet until Joel and the food arrived simultaneously.So, Joel said.Tell me about getting to the next Exchange.Why?I heard a rumor that theres cargo from the Fire there.Who did you hear that from?One of the merchants.He recognized me, said he knew I was from the Fire by the way I talked.Joel pursed his lips.Thats not good news.Onor took a bite of his sandwich, the bread gritty with seed and nuts and the protein paste on it thick and creamy.It actually wasnt bad.So he said that there was a booth in Exchange Four that specialized in rocks and minerals.Which we had a lot of, so it makes sense.He said he was there and some of the stuff is labeled as coming from us.So shes not even trying to hide that she stole from us, Onor muttered.Joel leaned forward, a quiet, contemplative look on his face.Or shes underestimating us.Aleesi spoke.Koren underestimated Naveen.The Deep is huge, and your arrival wasnt actually a very big deal.It also wasnt publicized much.Koren tried to block Naveen from being the other one chosen to greet you, but she was unable to do that.Since then, shes been trying to destroy his reputation by suggesting hes a drunken lush and that hes not telling the truth about Rubys past.Joel frowned.How do you know all that?Its in the comment threads all over the station.The current prevailing attitude about anything can be parsed by reading and evaluating comment logs.This is also true on the stations at the Edge, even though those are smaller.Why didnt you tell us this earlier?Onor asked.You didnt ask.I thought you were more human than machine, Onor said.That doesnt mean I can read your mind.Onor laughed.Sometimes he almost liked the killer robot girl.Ix?Did you know this?Joel asked.About the logs.No.Onor sighed.Aleesi, can you teach Ix about the comment logs?And me, too?Yes.There is something else you might want to know, Aleesi said.What?The merchant who helped Haric?The couple from the bar?They are not happy with how things are run here on the Deep.Thats why they risked coming here, and why the merchant talked to Haric.The power structures here are stable, but all power structures draw people who hate them.And Aleesis peoplethe people from the Edgemight hate the Deeps powerful people, too.The immensity of what he didnt know felt like knives held above his head.Before he could form a question, Joel asked, So ...what else do you know about Koren?Can you verify that she stole from us?You must promise never to use me as a source of information.I know.Do you promise?Yes, Joel said.Now tell me what you can prove, and how we might prove it?Will you promise me something else?What?Joel snapped.Can there be someone in here talking to me most of the time?I get lonely.Joel looked exasperated.Sure.You can have a whispering woman.Ill find one for you tomorrow.Maybe SueAnne can work in here more often?Ive been helping her with research, but shes only here an hour or so a day.Ill ask.What do you know?You know Koren is the Deeps Chief Historian, right?Right, Onor said.That means shes on the Council.The Council is the group of people that runs things herethey can change laws, make laws, etc.The Council has ...arguments.About who has power.Koren is the least of them.She has almost no power.My analysis suggests that she thinks gaining the riches from the Fire will give her more power.Okay, Joel said.That fits with what the couple in the bar told us.But why all the intrigue?Maybe thats just how they do things here, Haric commented.Onor laughed.Dont be that cynical.Youre not getting out enough, Haric whispered.Joel gave them a look that demanded quiet.What else have you learned?You are inconvenient.She cant prove you dont own all of what came in the Fire.Thats part of why the Fire itself is locked away.A true historian would have kept her intact and given tours or something.So how do we prove that we own it?You may not own it, at least not according to the rules these people honor.Haric had been quiet.Now he spoke a touch too loudly, his voice laced with barely controlled anger.If everyone in power is so cruel, than how do we actually change things?How could a court do us good if Koren has more power than we do?Well, one way is to find a court that will listen to you.There are still rules, and if you can make the breaking of one a public thing, then even the powerful must pay.Harics face showed his doubt.Really?But who will listen to us?We have the least power of anyone Ive seen here.No, Onor said.You havent seen the Brawl.Haric sighed and went quiet for a moment.So it wont help if we find the stuff in Exchange Four?Oh yes, it will help, Aleesi said.Physical evidence would be very helpful.I still dont understand, Onor said.Well, either youre crew, and you get a part of the value of the cargo.Thats what Korens asserting.Or youre owners, and you get it all.Onor sat back.How would we prove were owners?Prove Lym isnt claiming ownership.How do we do that?Ix has records of its conversations.So we have to protect Ix.That was an odd thought.Onor was still used to Ix protecting them.But that also explained why Koren had stopped Ix early on, as soon as they got near, and why it had been hard for Naveen to get a copy of the AI.Even why Koren had stripped the group of most of their leaders.She was probably furious Ruby and Joel hadnt gone along with her plan to re settle everyone in power fairly nicely.After all, wherever Laird was, he probably wasnt three months away from being thrown in the Brawl.Maybe we should go talk to Naveen, Onor mused.Harics face brightened.They are very far away, Aleesi said.This doesnt sound impossible, Joel said.To prove this.If someone will be fair?What about our mystery couple?Onor asked.I have not been able to identify who they are.Onor looked over at Joel.Too bad we cant talk to Aleesi from a distance.Koren knows about me, Aleesi said.She could come take me any time.If you can find the technology to make me mobile, I will take the risk.Joel shook his head.Its too much.That puts Ix at risk, and we need it.If theres a way, it might make us all safer, Onor said.Joel looked like he was about to say no, but then he said, Be careful, instead.65     Ruby woke in the early hours of the morning after the party at Gunnar Ellenssons, her head spinning with the various excesses of food and design and attitude.Gunnar could buy fifteen ships like The Creative Fire and outfit them for fabulous journeys.He probably spent more credit on his private estate in a day than she needed to feed thousands.What had woken her was an anger at that wealth, an anger that drove deep in her belly and sent it sour, that stiffened her, that forced her out of bed.She wasnt angry at Gunnar.Shed actually rather liked him, in the odd way that one can like an enemy.He was affable and unruffled while he wasted credits that should be feeding people and stopping the Brawl.He wasted riches beautifully.The Deep confused her in so many ways.She wished Joel were here, or she was at home.She wanted to be held and she wanted someone to talk this through with.Their rooms were private, but there was a shared galley.She made her way there, intending to have a cup of tea and something to sop it up with up, some bread perhaps, or a seed cracker.To her surprise, Min was already at the table, alone, her face washed so pale in the light of the slate on the table in front of her that her scar barely showed.Her free hand was cupped around a glass of water.Ruby spoke softly, Hi Min.Min startled slightly, as if jolted out of some quiet reverie.Ruby poured a cup of hot water from a spigot.All these little conveniences would have been nice to have back on the Fire.Min smiled but said nothing.Ruby dug out a white paper sack to spill tea leaves into, and then dunked it in the hot water, almost burning her fingers.What did you think of the party?I didnt know what to make of it.She looked slightly sullen.Its ...all ...its all so much.So different.I dont even know how to talk to these people.I think thats what woke me up.All of this ...richness.Min looked surprised.We need to learn how to live here.I hate this place.Its not home.Its not friendly.Its not safe.Ruby didnt want to agree with her and make it worse for Min.Is that why you started spending so much time with Lya?No.It was the loss of the Fire.I cant believe you lost the Fire.Really?Ruby smelled the tea, afraid to sip it yet, since steam still wafted from the cup.I cant believe it was taken from us.The anger that had woken her edged her voice, and Ruby took a deep breath to calm herself.Min didnt deserve it.What do you think we did?Decided how to hurt ourselves the most and then did that to ourselves?Min looked up from her slate and stared at Ruby.Can you think of anything worse?If we had known what the Deep was like, we wouldnt have come here.That doesnt mean there was anyplace better to go.She stared into her cup.Thats not something we can ever know.She glanced back at Min, who had gone back to staring at her slate.But we have opportunities here.We need to take them when they come up.Mins face resolved into a soft sneer.I saw you leave the room with that stupid merchant last night.It woke me up, thinking about it.Id almost decided Lya was wrong, that you really are trying to work for us, but then you disappeared with him for an hour.Ruby bristled.She also wasnt going to let Min drive her back to her room.He wanted to show me his gardens.Your hair was messed up when you got back.She didnt remember that.We must have walked under some trees.Garden is the wrong wordits more like a forested paradise.We could have walked three hours and not seen it all.Really?I dont know why you say such things.Min didnt believe her?You were at the party.Dont you think a man who can waste credit on a fountain of colored drinks as tall as four people could make a paradise garden?Min laughed.Just what youd want.Someone with real power.Look, youre a rotten woman.We all know that now.You used to tease Hugh.You still tease Onor.You seduced the strongest man on the Fire just as it was certain hed take power.Youve slept your way to power all your life.When Joel finds out, youre going to lose your golden man.Theres nothing for him to find out.Ruby blew on her tea, her breath making ripples that sloshed small against the far side of the cup.You cant talk about things you dont know about.People will believe you.Youll hurt Joel.So stop doing it.Ruby shook her head.I didnt.I dont.Ask KJ.He was with me the entire time.Lya says he covers for you.Ruby took a deep breath, and finally a sip of tea.Cant you think for yourself?I do.At least now she had something other than the excesses of Gunnar Ellensson to be pissed off about.No.Really.KJ is Joels friend.He would hardly stand by while I slept with another man.Even if it meant making more credit?Is all of what you make even going back to us?Look at how many people are coming to your concerts, listening to them.One concert has to make enough to feed us all for at least a year.Dont be nave.Naveen takes most of it.But not all of it.I know you use some.Look at how you dress.Ruby felt just too dragged out to face Min right now, unable to draw up the right words to defend herself.Im going to try and get some sleep.You should do the same.Min stared down at her cup.I dont sleep much anymore.I might not sleep well until we get on another ship and go somewhere else.Where would you go?Min shook her head, and replied with a deep despair in her voice.There is no place to go.Ruby hated despair as much as she hated an unwillingness to think.Im sorry I brought you out here, she told Min.Good night.She took her cup.As she left the galley, a shadow detached itself from the wall in the corridor.Dayn.He leaned down and whispered in Rubys ear.Be careful.Nothing that you do is right, now.Not anymore.She stood still, unable to respond.She was angry with the Deep.Angry at the facts of existence here, angry at Min, and angry at herself for not using the opportunity to make some real headway with Min.Heck, if you wanted to count it up, she was angry with Koren as well, and with the robot spiders from the Edge that killed Colin.She hated the anger.Maybe she was even angry at Dayn for telling her the truth.After a while, she put a hand on his arm and spoke softly.I know.But I have to do something.I have to make some choices.Dayn whispered again.Choose carefully.66     Onor sat with Joel and SueAnne in the morning meeting room.After their conversations the night before, Joel had invited both SueAnne and Onor to share his breakfast time.Stim and half finished plates of food filled the table.Joel looked like hed actually slept.SueAnne was another story; rivers of darkness like spent blood filled the wrinkles around her eyes.She had started carrying a blanket with her wherever she went, a blue one that Jali had made from extra material.Her hands clutched the sides of her wheeled chair and her slate was balanced on shaky legs.Joel picked up a piece of bread and spread a vitamin laced sweet paste on it and then topped it with fresh berries.The berries came from Allen, who snuck in special treats for the leaders from time to time and claimed it was bar food he couldnt use.Any word on our stray spy?Since Aleesi was the only one who could answer that, Onor sat back in his chair and created his own breakfast sandwich, including a few of the sweet purplish berries.Hes doing well so far, she said.He left two hours ago.Hes passed through Exchange Five and found the right train for Exchange Four.SueAnne?Can you work in here today?Ill keep track of Haric then, and I can update you all.I can probably help you figure out what people think of our workers as well.SueAnne looked both trapped and intrigued.Really?How?People rate workers and make comments and that goes into how they get hired for other jobs.Onor groaned.That would have been wonderful to know before.Ill come in for another lesson later, he said.Maybe you can show me how to read those boards.I showed Ix yesterday.It would be useful for you to know.The more time you can give me in here, the more I can teach you.He sensed Aleesis human roots when she expressed loneliness like this.If only they could use the AIs to teach groups of people.But they were still hiding the fact that they had recovered them.Aleesi was sure Koren knew and sure she would come after her some day.If they were lucky, Koren didnt know Ix was there, too.Ix?Joel asked.The voice coming from the speaker on the table changed.Yes, Joel?Tell me about Ruby.How is she doing?Her audiences have grown to almost ten percent of the population.Aleesi added, The reviews and comments on her performances are primarily good.Primarily?What do the bad ones say?Some are reacting badly to her youth.Others suggest she didnt really come from the Fire, or that the Fire itself didnt actually come from the stations past.Really?Onor reacted.People think all of us are a lie?Why?SueAnne asked.Aleesi answered.It appears to be an attempt to discredit Ruby.Could be a rival ...Or Koren.Joel steepled his hands under his chin and looked lost in thought.Wed better meet in here every morning.Can you send the comments to my slate before each meeting?I can send a summary.All of the comments would exceed the memory in your slate.Joel narrowed his eyes.Summarize last nights comments for me.There were eighteen thousand original comments and fifty thousand replies, including duplicates.Over fifteen thousand were positive comments of one kind or another, more initiated by men than by women.Almost all comments and replies were made by humans.Most machines only pay a little attention to human art forms.So almost three thousand comments were negative.Almost two thousand.There were roughly a thousand that were questions or otherwise neutral.Onor noticed he hadnt taken a bite of his bread since Ix started the recitation.Can you show me some of them?This afternoon when I come back for my lesson?I want to see the twenty most positive and the twenty worst.Send them to all of us, please.Well talk about them tomorrow morning.Joel looked pleased with Onor.Some part of you is always a guard, isnt it?Onor laughed.Maybe I should get paid for that.The look on SueAnnes face led him to mumble, Well, maybe not.But someday that will be the only way to get people to work here.SueAnne pushed her plate aside and picked up her slate.Last night, Ruby added ten days to our lives outside the Brawl.Other workers added a sum total of half a day.Thats less than the point six five of a day that they added yesterday, but the good news is that two of our young men were hired by one of the more prominent ship builders.To do what?Sweep up a factory floor.67     Ruby took her first bows on the end of the seventh large stage shed been on in three weeks.This one was no renovated ship; the whole bubble had been designed and built for performances.More precisely, a huge habitat bubble had been bisected, and the half that faced the sun grew food.The half that faced away housed a great amphitheater that could be configured for concerts, lectures, plays, or sports.In the current configuration there were ten thousand seats, and yet people still lined the walls standing.Stars shone overhead, and one of the gas giants was in a place in its orbit where it hung like a red and gold dinner plate in the sky, shedding some of the reflected light of Adiamo down on the venue.The design created excellent acoustics.Her voice had sounded huge.Applause rolled and crescendoed and fell, waves of it, the sound bathing her in success.This time they were near the true middle of the Diamond Deep.Headman Stevenson was in the audience, as were many of the Council.Gunnar Ellensson had come by earlier and put a hand on her shoulder, wishing her luck.He had stood so close she could smell the subtle musk of his sweat, and she knew he wanted her.This pleased and disturbed her.She had no intention of sleeping with him, but his desire might give her a bargaining hold of some kind.He had whispered, I will be listening.The applause began to die down.She cleared her throat.This last song is dedicated to the poor.It is for those who cannot make it on their own and who have been abandoned.The audience quieted.She continued.Sometimes art exists to entertain.Sometimes it exists to teach.Sometimes it exists to incite change.And sometimes it exists to twist our insides and let us see ourselves.It is up to the listener to choose what each song means for them.I give you this song for your contemplation.I suspect you may not like it, but not all art is meant to be liked.Its called Turning Away.Turning away Does not make Danger disappear.Turning away Is loving The lies of our hearts  A babe lies in its mothers arms, Hungry She offers her breast, her milk, Her help.The child grows and gains Love and hope and life But not work.Time passes.He is gone now, locked In a place full of failures The mother turns away, Tends to her own bare Life of desperation  Turning away Does not make Danger disappear.Turning away Is loving The lies of our hearts  The mother grows older, Weaker Locks her loss and love She works It becomes her turn To join the masses She cannot work He is with her, locked In a place full of failures He sees her in the brawl But he turns away from her Time passes.He is gone now, locked In a place full of failures The mother turns away, Tends to her own bare Life of desperation  Look inside See despair Starve it out Embrace the hope Of helping The lovers of our hearts There were more verses.Tens of verses.The cruel possibilities suggested so much.But this was enough.For now.She waited on the end of the stage.A few people clapped, and then a few more, and then more, but nothing like the wave of approval that had met her a few moments earlier, a song before.This felt tentative.Approval and dismay, perhaps.Or approval and fear.She spoke into her microphone.I am not surprised that you are quieter now.My people and I come from another time in your history.When we left, the Fire was designed so that there were people with different jobs, with different amounts of power.That is inevitable.We are not all the same.She paused, let them accept that.As soon as a quiet whisper of conversation came to her, she started speaking again.No one starved.No one lived without any privacy, without any hope, without the arms of families.We age and we die from age like your ancestors did.But no one dies alone in a crowd like the people who die in the Brawl.I am sorry that the first song I bring you that is of you, for you, about you, is about a horror so deep that it took me weeks to figure out how to sing about it.She paused again, the space of a breath or two.No one clapped.There is also much beauty in the Deep, and I will sing about that for you soon.The few faces she could see in the front row displayed confusion, anger, unhappiness, and slightly more subtle emotions like uncertainty.She wanted them to think.She bowed and walked off the stage, steeling herself for Naveens reaction.Only after she had left the spotlight did she hear the first tentative claps.By the time she went behind the curtain, the level of applause told her that about half of the people had joined in.68     Onor, Joel, Marcelle, and The Jackman sat silently, staring at the screen.The bar had gone quiet after Rubys song about the Brawl and her short speech afterwards.Marcelle was the first to react.She stood up and clapped, staring down at Onor until he did the same.Joel stood, dragging The Jackman up.Their whole table stood there, clapping by themselves, watching the crowd from the concert begin to file out of the large theater bubble on the screen in front of them.After a short delay, Onor heard clapping from behind him.He looked around and saw that it was people from the Fire.He heard a third table from the other part of the room.After a few moments, clapping came from all directions and Marcelle had started whistling catcalls.Yet most of the people from the Deep sat still, or whispered one to another.Just before Marcelle sat down, Onor caught a few claps from a group of Deepers in the far corner.Then one more.An eerie delayed reaction.As they sat back down, Onor leaned over to Marcelle and kissed her cheek.Thank you.That was perfect.That was stupid, Joel whispered, soft enough that only the four of them could hear it.Shes always been stupid, The Jackman said.But you gotta admire a girl wholl take on a whole space station full of people.Joel chewed on his lower lip.Arent thousands of her own people enough to protect?Onors laugh broke some of the tension around the table.I knew shed do that ever since she saw the Brawl.Im surprised she managed to wait this long.In spite of the others laughter, Joel still looked unhappy.She takes too many risks.Marcelle gave him a sweet smile.Isnt that why you fell in love with her?Joel glowered even more.Silly, serious man.Allen came over and sat backwards on a chair.Can I offer you a round in condolence?Joel raised an eyebrow.Condolence?Over a hundred people have asked for refunds.How did you know that?Onor asked.Naveen called me.He wanted to know if you all had seen what she did.And what did you tell him?That he should have known he was playing with fire.Joel finally laughed, although creases of worry still furrowed his brow.Evie came up to see if they wanted refills.After she took their orders, she leaned close to Onor.Have you heard from Haric?The undertones of worry in her voice made Onor smile.I checked before we came in here.He said hes settled into a hotel room outside the Exchange.He was about to go find a good place to watch the concert.I bet hes someplace just like this.Her eyes rounded.But not with us.With Deepers.Onor tried to reassure her.It should be okay.I cant imagine anyone will hurt Haric over this.Besides, some of the Deepers liked what she did.He thought about adding that they were even less likely to hurt a kid, but Haric probably wouldnt want to be referred to that way.Hell be okay.Will you send me a message as soon as you know anything?she asked.If youll do the same.I will.69     This time the after party was at Headman Stevensons home.Ruby let Jali fuss with her hair until Naveen sent a minion to pound on her door.As soon as she saw Naveen, she tried to read his reaction.When she had first come off the stage, every muscle she could see had looked tense and he had spoken in short commands.Now, his jaw was a little more relaxed and he was willing to look at her.In spite of the faint smell of wine on him, there was nothing in his look that suggested any kind of approval.What were you thinking?he asked.Her tiredness seemed to vanish with his question, worry taking its place.What I told them.I meant that.Sometimes art matters.More than feeding your people?Of course not.But then after a minute, she said, Maybe.People here dont talk about the Brawl.They hardly want to be reminded of it.Especially in an encore.He almost sounded pleading.Im not just a pretty little singer.Well, hurry up, he said.What?You cant wear that.She had on the outfit designed to look like the last uniforms from the Fire, the ones they had all worn for docking day.Jali had just finished it this morning.Theyd argued about how much to tuck it so that it showed her figure.Jali had won; it was tucked and piped.Almost too pretty.I rather like it.Are you trying to commit suicide?Or just tired of singing?I can stop this whole thing right now.Ive already made enough credit that I never have to work again if I dont want to.But you have mouths to feed.She felt her apprehension transforming into anger, going from one emotion that made her tremble to another.I do.But I cannot unmake myself, and I cannot refuse to care.Youre the one who took me to the Brawl.Surely you did that because you knew it would affect me.I hoped it would scare you.Look.Lets go.I wont sing that song at the after party.Ill behave there.But youre going to wear that?Yes.He looked exasperated and intrigued all at once.Along the way, she felt as if he were trying to form words around an idea.He finally said, Look.We dont do revolution here.There hasnt been a change in power in thousands of years.Id like to see a change, more than you know.But you cant just come in from the outside and make that happen.Ruby didnt answer him.But if she hadnt known Lila Red the Releaser existedeven though she failedRuby would never have tried.Perhaps these people just needed to know it could be done.The way to Headman Stevensons was a broad, clear tunnel with art murals painted on the walls.Nothing as secret as getting to Gunnar Ellenssons had been.At least government here was accessible.It was also apparently popular.The huge room was full of people.The Headman saw her, and then ignored her until she came to him in the reception line.There, he took her hand and said, Welcome, and looked at her eyes.That last song?Yes?Dont ever sing it in my presence again.She flinched, but held her ground.Perhaps you would explain why?Maybe over a drink?To her surprise he handed off the duty of greeting people to the woman next to him.He took her arm, leading her.She wouldnt quite describe the pressure of his hand on her arm as painful.Naveen and KJ followed.She waved the others off, thinking that too big an audience might make it harder for her to have a serious conversation.Min looked like she wanted to join Ruby, but Ani pulled her away and they followed Jali and Dayn into the crowd.The Headman apparently had a similar thought, as he only allowed one of a crowd of hangers on to follow him.He led Ruby out of the party and into a small room that held only a table and a few chairs.There was already a pitcher with water and cups on the table, as if the spot were always kept ready.Please sit.Ruby did, KJ on one side of her and Naveen on the other, the Headman and his own guard opposite them with one empty chair.Headman Stevenson waited until everyone had poured water.Today, he wore a flowing white outfit that was sheer enough to show his multicolored tattoos.Something in the way he dressed reminded her of Lake, the man who had wanted to sell her women off to brothels.Or maybe she could smell it on him.At any rate, she didnt like him, and she didnt trust him.But there was no denying that he radiated the confidence that came with real power, or that so much confidence made fear beat like wings in her heart.For a long, awkward moment no one said anything.The door opened and Koren walked into the small room.She wore sparkled and stitched blues very much like she had the first time Ruby met her, and once more her arms and neck flowed with golden chains.Hello, Ruby.She didnt even acknowledge KJ or Naveen.Ruby said nothing.She couldnt trust herself not to admonish Koren for her rudeness, and for a thousand other things, so she sat with her nails dug into her palms.Koren had brought them down.Or more accurately, they had allowed Koren to bring them down.Either way, they were enemies now.Koren had the same sense of power the Headman did, even though she was clearly subservient to him.It was hard not to speak.Headman Stevenson looked at Ruby.I am going to assume that you are simply nave, and you do not appreciate the value of our choices here.So that was how he wanted to play it.She smiled as sweetly as she could.Enlighten me?Success in this system comes from hard work.Like you are doing touring.He smiled, his teeth even and white except for one that had a small gem on it.Im sure its exhausting.She nodded, without telling him exactly how exhausted she did feel, or that this conversation was already making it worse.Im pleased to be able to see so much of the Deep.I happen to know you have seen some of the finest places we have to offer.There is much beauty.But it takes great wealth to create great beauty.At least the type of remarkable place that my friend Gunnar created.She lowered her eyes and sipped at her water.It had a tang to it, as if a bit of fruit had been infused into the water.I like Gunnar.I was grateful that he showed me what he created.It may be the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.Except Joel, and the look in his eyes when he was full of passion and lust and love for her.She had to hang on to that, which had seemed so huge once and yet paled compared to the Diamond Deep.It still mattered, because if love didnt matter than nothing did.Surely, a mere tenth of the credit spent to build that paradise could support a hundred people for all of their lives?The Headman smiled.But if we did so, and that hundred people didnt need to work, then they would not do so.Then more would not.That experiment has been tried.We all worked on The Creative Fire.Everyone who could.And we took care of the ones who couldnt.Koren didnt seem to feel as great a need as Headman Stevenson did to remain polite.In fact, her smile might as well as have been full of knives instead of teeth.You were no better, nor your lover.If I remember right, The Creative Fire hosted a rather large peacekeeping force to assure that you didnt rebel.People died.People were raped.People were locked up.You still have people contained in your home community, and more every day.A stinging truth.Ruby struggled not to wince out loud.Many of the people in the Brawl are there simply because they could not compete.The only people we lock up are those who have committed crimes against others of us.And what about that woman who didnt like you?What was her name?Sylva?How did she die?It felt like being taunted by a schoolyard bully.Ruby kept her lips sealed.Naveen, beside her, had stiffened.But he had not said a word since they came in here, and had not so much as looked at Koren.KJ spoke up.Ruby was not responsible for those choices.Any of them.As a people, we have no more evil in our past than you perpetrate with the Brawl.Less.I have been there, and it is as anathema to a free humanity as anything I have ever seen.And as to our pastor Rubysnot being perfect, you might recall that you know ours, but we do not know yours.Bless him, his voice was calm and controlled, like cool water thrown onto the fire that Ruby felt inside her.You must play fair.Headman Stevenson laughed.He addressed Koren.Point, to our beautiful Ruby the Reds bodyguard.Koren sat back in her chair, looking satisfied.The Headman turned back to Ruby.His dark eyes seemed full of mischief, which puzzled her.But his words were clear and serious.It is through competition and enforcement of the need to make enough to pay for air and food that we are able to make sure people do succeed.Fewer than five percent end up in the Brawl.In all of the Brawls, everywhere.They are reminders as much as prisons.They spur our society to its greatest efforts.He paused, and raised an eyebrow.After all, another choice would be to kill them.The idea was so repugnant Ruby couldnt even speak.But we do not do that.Remember that there are billionsbillionsof souls in the whole fabric of humanity that surrounds Adiamo.You have been here less than half a year.Surely you can allow a little more time before you try to change our ways?She felt like a ten year old, and she knew that was how he meant her to feel.She took a deep breath and another sip of water, waiting until she could keep her voice steady.Perhaps those of you who have been here all of your lives have learned to accept the grossly unfair.My song is merely art, but Im pleased it touched a nerve.Headman Stevenson smiled, the mischief back in his eyes.I see you plan to be a worthy opponent.I would advise against it.I find you very intriguing, and I would love to keep you for a pet.It was all Ruby could do not to leap up out of her chair.A look from KJ helped her keep her control.But pets are generally not allowed on space stations.Especially pets that might bite.If you are not careful, I will have options to exercise.And I have many, many more options than you do.The Headmans voice was calm, like KJs calm voice, except that it felt like frost.I will not allow my people to be riled up against me.Not by you.Not by anyone.If you want to keep singing, if you want to keep breathing, you will not sing that song.He stood up.Go enjoy the party.And make sure it is not the last one I want to throw for you.Then he came around to her side of the table, leaned down, and planted a kiss on the top of her forehead, his lips lingering.When he left, the startling noise of the party spilled in through the open door and then cut off completely.Koren looked quite triumphant.She said nothing, but simply watched Ruby.Ruby said nothing in return.Instinct told her that whoever spoke first lost.The four of them stayed that way for quite a long time, the only sound in the room their breathing and the occasional screech of a chair leg.She glanced at KJ and Naveen.KJs calm demeanor reminded Ruby to breath deep in her belly.Naveen had an odd look on his face, and he wouldnt look directly at Ruby or Koren.Maybe because of their history on the Fire?But mostly Ruby kept her attention on Koren, her face as relaxed as she could force it to be.Twice she felt pains in her stomach so hard that she almost lost the serene expression, but she swallowed hard and stayed still.To Rubys surprise, Koren broke the silence first.I only have one thing to add, she said.There is a dangerous thing inside your community.Something edgy.I dont mind that, much.Its interesting to watch you all learn; youre faster than I thought you would be.Nevertheless, you remain almost as nave as I expected.The problem here is that you dont know how little you know.Naveen spoke up this time.Theyre doing quite well, no thanks to you.Well, thats part of the problem, she said, smooth and even, smiling in spite of her words.You seem to be getting help from the dangerous thing.Remember, I know your history.Tell your lover that he should stop looking for cargo or the dangerous thing will be revealed.And then, after youve been here a few years and learned a few things, invite me to lunch again.Ruby had enough of being silent.Perhaps someday you will earn an invitation.Koren smiled, her strange golden eyes wide and almost kind looking.Thats your choice to make.Just make sure the nearer term choices in your life are the right ones for your people.My choices are good.Korens laugh was soft, as if Ruby had just complimented her on a pretty shirt.She left, and when she left she didnt bother to close the door behind her.The noise of the party spilled into the small room, reminding Ruby that she was on display.It didnt matter how she felt.What mattered was how she looked and what she did and whether or not she could change hearts with those things.70     Onor was beginning to feel as much like an advisor as a guard in the morning meetings.He knew that was probably an illusion, but he sat at the table with Joel and SueAnne and sometimes they asked him a question.At the moment, it was SueAnnes turn to talk.Ive done the numbers.Were moving ahead because of Rubys singing.If she does a concert a week for two years well be set for ten years, but she cant maintain that.Joel hated dealing with numbers, and made it clear by the slightly exaggerated boredom that showed on his face.But he was too good a leader to ignore them.Other income?Are we sending more people out to work?Slowly.Without Ruby, wed be losing ground.For each of the last four days, we made just over a quarter of what we need for a whole days basic costs.At least according to what gets reported to us.I suspect we make more, and that theres a black market in credit.Joel waved a hand at the air.There has always been a black market.Thats what the cargo bays were for.Allens bar is the same thing.The black market is only part of it, SueAnne said.Workers appear to be under reporting.Theyre spending on their way back, tucking credit into pockets, hiding it in their socks.She looked disgusted.I heard a rumor some buy women, or other pleasures.Theres reported to be a lot of strange pleasures on this station.Things I dont want to know.She glanced meaningfully at Onor.He answered, Bartenders dont repeat their stories.But yes, theres some of that.And Ive counted at least four or five of our young women who have gone off with Deepers, and Ive only seen one of them come back.I heard some are saving in hopes they can get young like these people.Marcelle was after Onor to start a savings for the treatment, at least for the baby.Aleesi spoke up, startling Onor.They are.But they cannot do that.They stay as young as they are, but only if they arent already truly old.SueAnne laughed.So Im too far gone.Aleesi ignored the interruption.Most of you are already slowing the aging process.Some of what you need is in the food here.But some of the medicine has to be given to children.So Onor could give it to his child, but he is too old to take it now.And Marcelle was due soon.What will I need to do?He still couldnt even imagine holding a baby that was his.One minute it made him feel like running away and the next he was picking through piles of baby clothes.The baby did something else; it made it ever so more important that they catch Koren.There is a medical treatment that starts at birth and happens once a year until a body reaches about twenty years old.Sue Anne interrupted.Tell Onor about that later.Its losing the young that worries me.We need fewer people to feed.But thats not the fewer we need.I have another thought.We can send our prisoners into the Brawl.Theyll be fed as well as we feed them, maybe better.Theyll be housed.Theyll learn about this culture, and we wont have to pay for them.Onor had to bite his tongue to keep from reacting.Ruby would hate that.Hate wasnt a strong enough word.There wasnt a strong enough word.Joel sat back in his chair, quiet.How many prisoners are there now?Two hundred and seventy three.So many?Joel shook his head.Keep that as a last resort.We could also send the old if we have to, SueAnne added.Im running numbers.That will be even more.You cant!Onor said.SueAnne gave him a level look.I will go myself if need be.The survival of the community is more important than I am.No its not, Onor blurted out.Who would do the books without you?Joel looked tired at the idea, worn down.Go ahead and run all of those numbers.But dont do anything about it.Ix has helped me, she said.Was it Ixs idea?Onor asked.No.SueAnne stood up out of her wheelchair and took a few wobbly steps to the sink, where she poured a glass of water and drank it all down at once.No.It was my idea.But Ix is still tracking all of the people coming and going, and its helping me track the credits.It may not be able to talk in most places, but it can listen everywhere still.This is very useful.Ix almost never talked in these meetings.Aleesi was the one who usually offered them the most.Hey, SueAnne?Yes?Keep your ear to the ground.I want a second place to put an AI.I know theyre expensive.But I want to separate Aleesi and Ix.Or at least have a mobile copy of Aleesi.Why?Joel asked.Because we need more access to Aleesi.More mobile access.All we can do now is talk to her in this little room.Joel raised an eyebrow.I thought you hated the spider.Onor ignored him.And we need to keep Ix safe in case we need it in court.SueAnne shook her head at him.Use your black market credit.We need income, not expenses.71     Ruby poured a cup of stim and sat at the breakfast table.KJ, Jali, and Dayn were already there, although there was no sign of either Min or Ani.How do you feel?Jali asked.Better for the days rest.Ill have to thank Naveen for that.Youll get a chance, KJ said.He messaged me that hes on his way to pick you up for breakfast.Her shoulders tensed.Am I entertaining?As far as I know its just Naveen.Good.Youre going?Im sending Dayn.Ive got to go check out the next venue.So he thought wherever they were going next could be more dangerous to her than breakfast with Naveen.Any specific fear?Dayn answered before KJ could form a sentence.Lets see, you just tried to plant a seed of revolution on the biggest space station in the whole system by singing a song designed to make people hurt.Only a seed, mind you.You could have tried to shove a whole forest of revolutionary ideas at them.I know you have it in you.He was grinning.And then the most powerful man in the system threatened to kill you if you sing the song again.And if I know you, you will.So he knew about the meeting in the little room.And she was going to have to live with him all through breakfast.KJ added, There have been a few other threats.And a lot of appreciation.Im not sure which scares me more.Life is becoming ...interesting.Ruby sipped at her stim, which tasted extra spicy this morning.Good.Jali, lets go get me ready.Dayn laughed.Cant get dressed by yourself anymore?Jali turned around and slapped at Dayn, the move playful but edged with a warning nonetheless.She made a little extra swing happen in her hips as she walked away, so it was all Ruby could do not to burst out in laughter.Jali, bless her, always organized a closet full of Rubys clothes no matter where they stayed.It was work; they moved every two to three days, and theyd be moving again tomorrow after tonights concert.She rummaged through it.Something simple?Pants, and a purple shirt.The soft one.Not the uniform pants, Jali warned.Okay.You pick.What are you doing to do?Are you going to stop singing about the Brawl?Probably not.Ruby reached a hand out for the simple black pants Jali offered.The idea of it wont let me go.Its the only thing I truly hate here.Hate isnt the only thing you sing about.Ruby wriggled into the pants.Of course not.She turned to look Jali full in the face.You have no idea how tempting it is to become like these people.Jali laughed.I never know what to think of you.One moment youre all about having all the power you can, the next youre professing that youd rather be poor.Lifes confusing.She took the purple shirt and dropped it over her head.I suspect its harder to be me than to watch me.I wouldnt bet on that.Jali tugged the shirt down to straighten the neckline and belted it, her hands soft and sure where they touched Rubys waist.Just dont get yourself killed, okay?Ruby sobered.Ive never been able to promise that.When Naveen met Ruby and Dayn at the door, his face looked unreadable, but conflicted.That was the best way she could think of to describe it, anyway.It disturbed her, although she couldnt really explain why even to herself.If Naveen was surprised that Dayn was going instead of KJ, he didnt signal that in any way.He simply told everyone good morning, and led Ruby and Dayn on a short, crowded train ride to a large station, and from there down a corridor to a small and sparse waiting room that held three other people.The bare walls offered no clue as to the purpose of the room.No breakfast looked likely to appear; the room smelled like cleaner rather than stim.What is this?Dayn asked.A ferry point.Before she could ask Naveen for the definition of a ferry, a soft bell went off and a robotic voice said, Ferry approaching.Stand away from the door.The blue wall slid open from the middle.Another set of doors opened behind it, revealing what looked like a train car.Two young women stepped off the car.The other people in the room left with them, so Ruby, Naveen, and Dayn had the ferry to themselves.They boarded a small, bubble like ship with windows all around the middle and both ends closed up.There were twelve seats.They strapped in just as the ferry lurched forward a few hundred meters and stopped.Hold on, Naveen said.The ferry began accelerating, as if a big hand pushed them ever faster from behind.Then it floated free.It will take us about thirty minutes to reach the catch point on the other side.The set up reminded Ruby of her trip with Satyana.Is this a safe place to talk?Naveen smiled, and although he looked pleased with her, his features didnt show the attraction she usually saw there.And if I was, what would I want to talk about?She smiled.I suppose youd want to talk about what you heard yesterday.You should have told me you were going to sing about the Brawl.Dayn laughed.And you should have expected that she would.You showed it to her.Youre marketing her as a revolutionary.I showed her the Brawl so she would understand the dangers here.Well, you didnt think it through very hard, did you?Dayn was on a roll.Youre making more from every concert than we are, more for one person than were making for thousands.Without Ruby, this wouldnt be happening.It wouldnt be happening without me, either.They sounded like little boys in a play yard.Out here, the Deep loomed large in the windows on one side, and open space went forever on the other, the lights of two arriving ships the only thing Ruby could see except stars.Dayn and Naveen kept sparring, but Ruby tuned it out.She needed to think.KJ would have been a better guard.He seldom said anything he didnt need to, while Dayn often said things he should regret.She had been impetuous.If she was going to change things here she needed a strategy.She needed songs that pricked people deeper, and she also had to set them up right.They couldnt stop earning credit.Thus, she had to make revolution popular.That was sort of what had happened on the Fire, but the grays she had led there had known they were abused.She wasnt at all sure it would do any good for the people in the Brawl to revolt.They probably couldnt.The enforcer robots were worse than reds; there would be no Ben or Chitt there.This station was bigger than she was.Was she crazy to think she could change anything fundamental about the Deep?Dayn and Naveen grew so loud that Ruby decided to intervene lest she end up stitching them both up.Or stitching up Dayn.She was sure Naveen was a better fighter, and probably better armed.Shed seen him use a small hand weapon on a too rabid fan once, and the man had fallen down immediately as if stunned.She touched Dayn on the shoulder.Excuse me.Dayn sat back, looking a tiny bit red faced.She spoke to Naveen.How many more concerts do we have scheduled?Four.Im working on three more.Dont schedule those yet, she said.Im tired, and I need to see my family and my people.I need to know how they are doing.You have to do the four.Theyre under contract.Okay.But Ill sing what I want.Naveen let out an exasperated sigh.Can you at least give me song lists before, and then follow them?I spent all day yesterday trying to manage the spin on your last song.What do you mean?she asked.I had to convince people you werent really trying to foment a rebellion.She smiled as sweetly as she could.How did people react?Outside of the audience?Thirty two percent hated the song, forty seven percent loved it, and twenty one percent seemed conflicted.That was in the first three minutes.After that the percentage of haters went up.Dayn leaned in, suddenly paying close attention.Haters?I dont think they even heard the song.I know some of them.Theyre the powerful, or the minions of the powerful, trying to control the story.Theyve made you look like a nave, slightly crazy woman who doesnt understand our perfect culture.Dayn laughed.Apt enough.Ruby glared at him before she turned back to Naveen.Raw numbers?Last I checked they were going up.Yes, Naveen said.But so is the danger.Dayn sat back in his seat.Meaning she has more enemies than before?Ruby said, When I started causing problems on the Fire, people like Sylva and Ellis started fighting me harder.She looked at Naveen.So whos fighting me here?Assume its most of the people in power.And that some of them will smile at you and clap and offer you power of your own in order to try and control you, and when you refuse theyll drop you so hard you crack your tailbone.Dont underestimate how cruel power can be.She felt the pull of the ferry station at their destination, as if the capsule they had been floating in had been grabbed by a guiding force.They were almost out of time.What about Korens threat at the party?She wants Joel to stop something or shes going to get Aleesi.That could be.Korens exactly the kind of power to avoid.Ive never called on her.She comes to me.The ferry shuddered and slowed.Naveen turned to Ruby.Be polite for breakfast.These are the opposite of enemies, and could be even more dangerous.Dont promise too much.Dayn tensed, and Ruby stood and stared through the opening door.She knew one of the three people in the small waiting room.Satyana.72     Joel dismissed Onor after the morning meeting ground to an inconclusive halt, telling him to come back later that afternoon.Onor headed right to the bar and suggested Allen help him find a way to move Aleesi, only to be mostly ignored.Onor couldnt give up.He spoke loudly, so Allen would hear him even though Allen was on the far side of the room, cleaning tables and dodging a little robot scrubber that was doing the floors.Its important.I just know it is.In fact, I want to get Aleesi all the way out of here.Put her someplace safe.I dont want to see Rubys face if we lose Aleesi or if anything bad happens to her.Allen just moved on to the next table.I know one of the robot spiders ate Colin.I was there, damn it.But Aleesi is helping us learn things we wouldnt know.Do you really trust it?That stopped Onor.I dont know.At least youre not all the way gone.No.But we need help.I need to find a way to prove Koren stole from us.Allen looked up at him.Even if you do get a webling, what are you going to do with it?How are you going to move Ix?I thought Id copy Aleesi.I need her mobile.Will that work?Her spider body was as big as this bar.Onor winced.I dont know.I guess I need Naveen, but hes not here.That couple came back last night, after you were already gone.I told them to be back today.Maybe if you can sneak away and get what you need, then they can help.Are they familiar with AIs?How do I know?At least theyre from here.Okay.But then I may need some more credit.Allen gave out a heavy sigh.I wish people would stop seeing me as place to borrow credit.Whos borrowing?Im a small investor, and surely you want to be supportive?Besides, youre the one with a real going concern.Other people could have those too, if they wanted them.Onor laughed.I think they will.Especially the younger ones.I overheard two girls talking about starting a clothing store for women.I noticed because Im going to need baby clothes.Im feeling sorry for you.Evie came in, running a comb through her hair and looking askance at Allen.Sorry Im a few minutes late.She noticed Onor.Hi.Have you heard from Haric?Not yet.We had a datelike an appointment.He was going to call me and we were going to have a half an hour to talk before I had to start work.But he didnt, and I tried to call him and he didnt answer.Maybe hes still asleep.Allen came over to them and leaned on the bar.Or he just forgot.Evie bristled.He wouldnt forget.Onor shook his head.Dont you know teasing when you hear it?She stamped her foot with the drama available to the very young.Im worried.73     Satyana nodded at Naveen and held her hand out to Ruby.Pleased to have you join us.Thank you.Follow me.Ruby expected to be introduced to the two people with Satyana.The woman stood tall and thin, reminding Ruby vaguely of Marcelle.The man was squatter, but shared her features.They walked with sure strides behind Satyana and in front of Ruby and Dayn.Naveen took the rear position.Satyana led them to a table in a small room with windows that looked out over the station.They were high up, so the Deep looked like a long froth of habitat bubbles and tangled transportation, punctuated here and there with the angular shapes of spaceships.Small vessels travelled between locations, each of them reminding Ruby how vast the Deep was.A robot brought six steaming cups of stim in on a tray and retreated toward what must be a kitchen based on the smells coming from it.At least she was going to get the breakfast Naveen had promised.Satyana sipped at her stim and looked at Ruby appraisingly.You will tell no one that youve been here.I thought every move was tracked.You told me so yourself.This trip wont appear on anyones tracking.Really?How?Dayn asked.There is a restaurant here, and you will be recorded as having dined with Naveen and Dayn, and no one else.She smiled a slightly evil smile, playful.And Naveen is picking up that tab.Naveen pulled a flask out of his pocket and dumped a stream of still into the stim.As far as Ruby could tell, everyone at the table noticed and chose to ignore it.After a few moments of small talk, Satyana asked Ruby, What do you plan to do?About what?Ruby asked.The song.Dayn shook his head.Everyones making an awfully big deal about one song.Its not the song that worries them.Its how fascinated people are by our Ruby here.Naveen knows how to build interest, but this time the attention seems to have a mind of its own.Naveens face turned red.Ruby is unique.You see.Satyana turned back to Dayn.This station is ripe for change.Most people didnt know it, but Ruby is helping to wake people up.This fits with our plans.We are also able to expose some of our leaders.Most people here wouldnt have cared enough, given that theyve almost all got food and entertainment in plenty.But they will care if they fight Ruby, since many are coming to love her.The robot returned, serving Satyana first, then her yet un introduced guests, then Ruby, Naveen, and Dayn.Each plate had fruit and nuts that had been heated and smelled rich and comforting, and three clever small breads in different colors.After everyone took the first bites, Satyana continued.We were hoping youd get people a little riled up.We didnt expect so much attention so fast.I think its because the current power structure reacted with so much negative spin.In other words, it really wasnt the song.You might be in real danger, but wed prefer you dont get locked up just yet.Ruby felt slightly confused.So you want me to drive more protests?Yes.Will you?Ruby shook her head.Maybe.I need to understand what might happen.My people depend on me.We are working to change that, Satyana said.Now she was even more confused.How?Koren stole from you.Were going to expose her.That explains the warning she gave me.Satyana narrowed her eyes.You saw Koren?At the after party from the last concert.I saw herwith the Headman.She wanted me to tell Joel to stop doing something ...something about cargo?Satyana and the other two looked at each other.A long silence allowed Ruby to take a bite and to work her way partly through the stim.She loved the way it seemed to run slowly through her veins, waking her up bit by bit.The food tasted good, but it didnt sit well in her stomach so she pushed it around with her fork while she waited for the conversation to start again.Satyana asked Ruby, Did you tell Joel that Koren is on to him?No.Im sure everything in our calls is recorded.She glanced at Naveen.Being on tour is like being under a microscope.But Im trying to get back home soon.I need a break.The man spoke.Well tell him.Im going back there tonight.Ruby startled at that.Is there a way to get back that fast?I thought it would be a multi day journey.It would be, on a train.Ill fly.The idea skewered her with homesickness, the feeling more physical than it had been so far.She put a hand over her stomach, the pain making her groan.Dayn touched her shoulder, almost a caress.Normally she would have flinched away from him.Are you okay?Just a little tired.Satyana looked at Naveen.Has she had a medical exam since they got here?He shrugged.Satyanas eyes narrowed.Ill send one.Ruby sat as straight as she could.The pain was starting to scare her, but it also felt private.Im okay.Well send a bot.I dont need one.Satyana laughed.It wont hurt.Ruby still didnt entirely trust Satyana.So you and your friends want to overthrow Stevenson?Even though they said nothing, the answer lived in their body language.They did.What would you do differently if you were in charge?Ruby asked Satyana.I will not be in charge.She glanced at the man and woman who were going back home tonight.They looked at each other and then back at Ruby.She couldnt tell what kind of power they had.They seemed confident, and curious, but they didnt feel enveloped in confidence like Koren and Headman Stevenson.They felt ...more real.Ruby stared at Satyana.You said you want to know what Ill do.Ill do anything to protect my people.That means the things Ill fight to change here are the things that we need changed to succeed.She paused, took another deep breath and another sip of stim, which had now cooled and tasted slightly bitter.We need time to learn about this place without the fear of the Brawl hanging over us.Satyana replied, You also need good leaders to succeed.This is not the Fire, where I knew how to tell good leadership from bad.The woman spoke for the first time.I thought I would like you.I do.But I cannot tell you much.You are in danger and secrets cannot be kept easily here.She sounded earnest and slightly hesitant.I promise that well help your people as much as we can.If we can.This is an unstable time.Ruby said, I still dont know what kind of help I should take from you or give to you.How could you?The woman glanced at Satyana.Give her our gift.Satyana pulled a box out of her pocket and handed it to Ruby.Inside, she found a small metal pin in the shape of the Fire.It looked like the ones they used at home, symbols that had gone on the uniforms of the first crew of the Fire and been passed down ever since.Onor and Marcelle each had one that Joel had given them shortly after he took power.Satyana said, We saw these in some of the videos.This one opens up, try it.Ruby ran her finger around the outer edge, which was a little bit sharp.Just behind part of the clip itself she found an unexpected ball of metal and pressed against it.Nothing happened.Let me show you.Satyana took it from Rubys hand and pressed hard, almost like snapping her fingers.She closed it again quickly and handed it back to Ruby.This time Ruby managed to get it open, although doing so hurt her thumb.Inside, there was a button.Press that if you get in trouble.Then well know.Okay.Satyana reached into her pocket and pulled out two more, handing them to Ruby.Give these to whoever you most think should have them.Maybe pass them around so that are always with people who are protecting you.Naveen already has one.Ruby handed them both to Dayn.The second one is for KJ.Dayn glanced at Satyana.And what exactly happens if we press these?We send people to help.The pin made her feel the dangers here more than anything else had, except perhaps the Headmans chatter about pets.She simply smiled and said, Thank you.Finish your food, Satyana said.Weve only got a few more minutes.Ruby looked at the two strangers, who remained un introduced.Tell Joel that I miss him and that Ill be home soon.We will, the woman said.Ruby pushed at her food some more, suddenly certain the meeting had really been for the two strangers.They had wanted to see her, to test her.She felt like shed passed, but she wondered what that meant.Back in the ferry, Ruby collapsed into a seat and waited for the invisible mechanism to push them away.Did you know those two people?she asked Naveen.
