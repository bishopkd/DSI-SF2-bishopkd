Madam.Madam.Simon, Gavin said dangerously, be   The words landed on her like stones.No.Hes right.Im so sorry.She died because of me.Youre not being fair to yourself, Alice, Gavin told her quietly.The Cossacks gave her the clockwork plague, and if you hadnt stepped in   I dont want to talk about this right now.Alice wiped her eyes.Damn it.Theres too much to do.We need to take care of the other children and we need to destroy that generator.Alice , Gavin began.Not now, Gavin.She got up, still holding the girls body.The other children stared, both fearful and uncertain.Feng, get the children down to the ground, please.Simon, help him.When the surviving children were safe on the ground, Alice climbed down herself, the girls body slung over her shoulder.She refused to let Gavin take it down for her.Blood smeared Alices blouse.Disorder continued to simmer through the circus and a curious crowd had gathered to watch, though as before they stayed outside the marked boundaries.Just as Alice reached the ground, Dodd trotted up to them, his collar undone and his hat askew.He was so agitated, he didnt even notice Simon and Feng.What the hell did you do?he demanded.Jesus and God and Mary.Everything was fine until you got involved.What do you mean?Gavin asked.Ivana threw us out, and without paying me the rest of what she promised, Dodd growled.And what the bloody hell happened to the elephant?What happened to you?Its complicated, Gavin said.He shot a glance over his shoulder at the streets leading back to the Gonta Zalizniak house.The short version of the story is that Ivana Gonta captured Feng and all these children.We had to rescue them, but we found out it was all a trick to Well, never mind.He wet his lips.Alice understood his nervousness.Even as they spoke, the Gonta Zalizniaks were pouring paraffin oil into their deadly mechanicals and moving them up from underground.Look, he finished, we have to get out of here.All of us.You, too.The whole circus.I dont understand.Dodd looked puzzled.Gavin looked ready to shake him.Werent you listening?The whole thing the invitation to perform, Ivana pretending to want you there was just a trick to get me and Alice into that house.Except we escaped, and now theyre angry.Theyre going to destroy the circus in revenge, and theyre on the way right now.Dodd stared, then turned and bellowed, Scarper!Now, now, now!Scarper!Scarper!The word rippled through the circus.At first there was a sense of disbelief.The Kalakos Circus was enormous and well respected, not some gypsy sideshow, and most of the performers hadnt been run out of a town in a dozen years or more.The idea that it could happen now caught them off guard.Once it sank in that the order was real, the general disorder from before blew into full blown chaos as people tried to gather family, snatch belongings, and decide whether or not to leave beloved animals both living and mechanical behind.Dodd started to run off, but Gavin caught his arm.We need to find Harry.He speaks Ukrainian, and he can help us find the childrens   I dont know where Harry is, Dodd snapped.Im glad you got these children out of the Gontas house, really I am, but right now Im more worried that my own people will end up in it.Why dont you put everyone on the train?Its faster, Gavin asked.The boilers are stone cold, Dodd snapped.Wed never get everything heated up in time.Though Im going to try, for the sake of the animals.Everyone else will have to run on foot or horseback and hope for the best.Maybe if we scatter in different directions, the Cossacks wont catch many of us.Oh!He put his hands to his head.Charlie!He cant run!Linda will have to hitch up her wagon.I have to find Nathan.Perhaps he can help her.Good heavens.Alices knees felt weak and she leaned against the elephants pitted side with the dead girl in her arms.The elephant felt uncomfortably warm, and it sighed steam.This was too much to take in.Im sorry, Dodd.I didnt know this would happen.Sorry?Sorry?Dodd was nearly shouting.You destroyed this circus.You destroyed our lives.Thank you, Baroness, for bringing my people into all this.He whirled and stomped away.Gabriel Stark, called Dr.Clef, stood on the deck of The Lady of Liberty and stared through a spyglass at the mechanical elephant.Time jerked and jumped.Some moments rushed ahead so quickly that his limbs moved like glaciers.Other moments slowed, froze even the daylight into clear, sweet ice.In those slow moments, he could see the entire world, perhaps the entire universe, caught in a single painting.When nothing moved, Dr.Clef saw every secret of the physical world, of time and matter and energy, as plain as an artists brush stroke.Then the universe jerked back into motion, and an ocean of paint splashed over what he saw, obliterating it.Even his memory of it vanished.He only knew that he had known.Some flotsam did stay with him, however.Stray numbers, unified concepts, vibrating strings, the final piece of an irrational number.Concepts no sane mind could grasp.Fortunately, his mind was falling apart, and this allowed him to hold a few secrets together.Another thing he held on to was the mission.The boy needed more time.That became plainer with every passing, precious moment.The boys movements as he climbed down from the elephant betrayed this need.The clockwork plague altered his gait, his gestures.Only someone as brilliant as Dr.Clef could see the pattern of the plagues progression toward madness, dissolution, and death.Although Dr.Clef calculated a decent 62.438 percent chance that Chinas Dragon Men could cure a clockworker, he gave the boy only a 19.672 percent chance of living long enough to see it, and the largest problem came from the fact that he wouldnt have enough time.Steam curled from the elephants tusks, and Dr.Clef simultaneously saw the droplets both condense and evaporate.He hadnt yet gotten around to naming the minuscule particles that made up matter.He himself hadnt had the time, and he was running out.The plague was eating at his body even as it sharpened his mind.But there was a remedy to his problem and to the boys.A wave of affection swept over him.The dear, dear boy.The son hed never had.Or perhaps he did have a son, or even a dozen.He didnt know for certain.Dr.Clefs memories of his own past grew more and more hazy every hour.He had vague recollections of fishing in a blue river with another boy while it rained, and another of kissing a pretty girl in a blue dress, and both colors were the same electric blue as his beautiful Impossible Cube.He remembered working in his stone laboratory in the Third Ward, but couldnt recall how hed come to be there in the first place.He recalled the boy, whose eyes were the same electric blue as Dr.Clefs beautiful Impossible Cube, and how the boy had held the Cube and sung his way through solid stone.But then the Cube had vanished.Every day when Dr.Clef rose, he felt the pain of its loss, like a man who loses a leg might still feel pain in his missing foot.It was impossible to re create the Cubes perfection.There was only one in all the universes and all the time they contained.And then the dear, dear boy with the electric blue eyes had handed him that lovely paradox generator, with its audible, irrational, and intoxicating double square root of two.Paired with his own alloy, which cycled the thrilling new power of electricity back and forth between the square root of two, the generator would give him his Cube back, and once he had both Cube and generator, he could give the boy all the time he needed.Dr.Clef needed only an enormous amount of electricity at the right frequency.And for that  Dr.Clef turned the spyglass upriver.The dam strained against the current, tamed it, forced uncounted trillions of droplets around turbines and rotors.He could feel the magnets moving within their coils, changing the flow of water to a flow of electricity.Exciting!Thrilling!The key to the universe lay within the grasp of these little people, and instead of taking advantage, they scurried about gathering up foolish possessions, clumps of matter that mattered not at all.Their current existence had no point, and only Dr.Clef could change it.He would change it.If only  He swung the spyglass back to the elephant.The girl seemed upset by the dead child in her arms, and the boy seemed upset that the girl was upset.He made the connection easily enough.The child had died because of something the girl had done, most likely save the boy, and now she was upset.Foolish.The boy offered the world quite a lot more than a stray child.But the fact that both of them were upset meant that they had probably  Yes.The paradox generator was still on board the elephant, forgotten by everyone.Except Dr.Clef.Chapter Thirteen  Gavin stood in the center of chaos beside the hissing elephant and amid a whimpering crowd of children.Feng was deformed, Alice was upset, Simon was a turncoat, Kemp was beheaded, one of the children was dead, and he had no idea what to do next.He wanted to crawl under a blanket and let someone else handle everything.Even the clockwork plague seemed to have abandoned him.Irrationally, he wished for Captain Naismiths presence.The captain would know what to do and would tell Gavin how to go about doing it.Gavin wouldnt have to plan, think, or worry.Unfortunately, Felix Naismith was gone, leaving no one but a former cabin boy in command.That was always the way of it.Father, captain, mentor it didnt matter.They always abandoned you.He squared his shoulders.All right, he said.Alice, where are your little automatons?Still on the ship.She was looking at the face of the dead girl in her arms.We need them to reassemble the   Papa!one of the children, a boy, shrieked.Papa!A dozen yards away, a man in the crowd turned, and the boy flew toward him across the stones, arms outstretched.The man stared incredulously, surprise and disbelief writ all over his face.Then he cried Pietka!and opened his arms wide.Pietka leaped into his fathers embrace, and the man rocked when the boy slammed into him.The man held his son tightly.Tears streamed down both their faces and mingled together as the father pressed his cheek to his sons.Pietka, he said.Mi Pietka.Papa, Pietka snuffled.Gavin discovered tears were leaking from his own eyes, and he wiped at them with his fingers.Well, Simon said beside him.Well.Pietka said something to his father, and the man trotted over to Gavin with Pietka still in his arms.Alice stepped back with the dead girl in hers, creating a tragic mirror image.The man said something to Gavin in Ukrainian, but Gavin could only shake his head.He wants to know if youre the one who rescued his son, said Harry, who came up at that moment.Hello, Gavin.Youve caused quite a fuss, quite a fuss.Tell him we all rescued Pietka, Gavin said.Harry translated, and the man abruptly snatched Gavin into a rough one armed embrace, tangling him with Pietka for a moment.Then he backed away, looking embarrassed.Youre welcome, Gavin said, also feeling embarrassed.The man spoke again, and Harry said, Hes asking about the other children.He wants to know if you need help finding their families.He doesnt know the Gontas and Zalizniaks are coming.Tell him yes, Gavin said.Harry, can you ?Yes, Ill go along to translate, Harry said, before Gavin could make the request.Im used to moving about on my own, and a few people in Kiev owe me a favor, so I can scarper off.Ill be fine, Ill be fine.Ill go with them, too, Simon said.And then I think Ill disappear myself.We could use your help, Simon, Gavin said.You saved us once in there.Simon shook his head.You dont need me.And frankly, my friend, its too difficult being near you.Oh.Gavin nodded.Where are you going?The least said, the better, Simon replied, in case Phipps gets her hooks into you.I wont be welcome in England, but the world is wide.He stuck out his hand.Good bye.Gavin shook his hand, then suddenly pulled Simon into a hard embrace.Im glad I knew you.When they parted, Simon wiped surreptitiously at his eyes.There was nothing else to say.The children, meanwhile, seemed eager to follow Harry, Pietka, and his father, once explanations were made.Since Pietka had found his father, they seemed eager to believe they would find their own parents.Gavin turned to Alice.They should take her, too, he said gently.Her parents will want her body back.Alice clutched the little girl to her.For a moment Gavin thought she would refuse to give her up, and he wondered if she was going mad.Then Alice nodded.Simon took the girl and wrapped her in his jacket.Im sorry, he said to Alice.Several of the children solemnly hugged Gavin and Alice, and Gavin was afraid he would cry again.Pietkas father led the group away.Pietka was already chattering in his fathers arms.Im sorry, too, Alice whispered.I couldnt let go.Gavin put his arm around her.I wouldnt be here if you hadnt come back.But that little girl would be.She buried her face in his shoulder for a moment.Oh God I dont know how to feel right now, Gavin.Circus people continued to rush about.Some were packing suitcases and wagons; others simply flung sacks over their shoulders and fled.Performing horses were drafted into service towing wagons.Almost everyone was heading toward a bridge over the Dnepro some distance downstream, since that road led out of town.Urgency drove their movements, and the ashy air was thick with fear.Most of the performers refused to look at Gavin or Alice.The few that did sent hard glares.Gavin felt very small, and very strange.A few minutes ago, he had been ready to die, a sacrifice to hell so that the children could live.But Alice had wrenched him around and led him out.And then it had happened, the very thing he had been trying to prevent.A stray bullet had penetrated the gondola and killed that little girl.Gavin had held her while the life slipped from her eyes.It was as if God had decided the two of them should trade places.He wanted to be angry with Alice, but he couldnt find it in himself.Instead, he felt glad to be alive, and also guilty that he felt glad, which contributed to that feeling that he was indeed a tiny, tiny man.We have some time yet, he said, and we need to get to the ship.The stuff onboard is too dangerous to hand to the Gontas.Madam.Madam.Madam.Kemps head was lying on the ground near Fengs feet, where Simon had left it.Alice nodded.Feng, please bring Kemp and follow us.The trio hurried toward the train.Along the way, they encountered Linda high up on her brightly painted wagon.She was driving a pair of horses toward the bridge over the Dnepro.Hello, honey!she called down cheerfully.Linda!Gavin called up to her.Are you and Charlie all right?Just fine.Charlies in the back.I tried to warn everyone that this was coming, but no one listened.Circus folk are more cynical than most when it comes to fortune telling.She popped a butterscotch into her mouth.I feel like Cassandra at Troy.You knew?Alice said.Of course, sweetie.You havent learned to let go yet, so this was inevitable.Besides, I drew the three of swords not long after Dodd got the invitation from Ivana Gonta.It means a disaster, but a necessary one.It teaches a lesson and relieves built up tension so the journeyer can move forward.Good gracious what happened to your friends?Madam.Madam.Madam, said Kemps head in Fengs hands.Too long to explain, Gavin said.Well, Im sure itll turn out all right in the end.Was that a prediction?Alice asked.An assurance, Linda corrected.I wont see you again, honey.Youre on your own.She clucked to the horses, who hauled the wagon away.Was I supposed to let you die?Alice burst out as Linda left.Gavin, I couldnt   Listen, now.Gavin pulled her to him.She burst into tears, hiding her face in his shoulder.It was the first time he had seen her cry, and it made him feel strangely old.Everyone said women were supposed to cry a lot, though now that he thought about it, he didnt see it happen very often.His mother had never cried that he remembered.He patted Alice awkwardly on the shoulder.Didnt Monsignor Adames say I was supposed to save the world?Yes, she sobbed while Feng stood quietly by with Kemps head.I cant save the world if Im dead.I was an idiot for trying to sacrifice myself like that.You had to come back for me.It was the right thing to do.How can it be the right thing to let a child die?Its my fault she died, Gavin.Thats strange.I thought it was the fault of the Cossack who fired the rifle.That makes sense, she snuffled.My head agrees with you, but my soul scourges me with fiery whips.Itll pass.I dont know if I want it to.Madam.Madam.Madam.He didnt know what to say to that, so instead they headed for the train.It was partly abandoned.Several boxcars gaped open, revealing dead space within.Other cars were shut tight, and yet others hung half open.Animal cages had been shoved every which way into some of them in the vain hope that the engine boiler might heat up quickly enough to move the train before the Cossacks arrived.Dodd and Nathan themselves were working with the engineer, trying to coax enough heat out of the boiler to get the train going.The Lady still sat at the rear disguised as a car.Gavin, Alice, and Feng climbed up to the deck.Gavin immediately felt more at ease, more in control.This was his ship.It was home.I wish I knew how much time we had, Alice said as Gavin helped her off the ladder.Itll take them at least an hour to get all those mechanicals fired up, and then another twenty minutes or so to get here, Gavin said.Considering how much time has already passed, I think that gives about forty minutes.Not long enough for Dodd to start the engine, unless he knows something I dont.Madam.Madam.Madam, Kemp said.His voice was growing fainter in Fengs hands.Give him to me, Feng.Alice accepted the head sadly and did something to it.The light went out of Kemps eyes and he fell silent.Well get him a new body and fix him somehow.And you, Feng.What about you?In all the fuss, we havent had a moment to figure out what happened.She touched his cheek.Im so sorry we didnt arrive in time.Feng remained mute.The spider on his head twitched a little, and the scars on his torso scribbled ugly tracks across his skin.What did they do to you, Feng?Gavin asked.Please answer.Ivana placed this spider on my head and it drilled into my skull and spine, he said promptly.She forced Danilo to help.It was painful.They put me in a cage until you came and brought me out.His voice was clipped and precise, completely unlike his more usual free, lackadaisical tone.Gavin ached for him.What does the spider do?he asked.Feng remained silent until Gavin added, Please answer.I do not know.Its obvious, Alice said.The spider makes him tractable.He does nothing he isnt told to do, and he follows orders from anyone who speaks to him.Isnt that right, Feng?Please answer.I do not know, Feng said, but that sounds true.Thats awful, Gavin said.Can we take it off?Or shut it down?It would take some study, Alice replied.However, I am forced to admit that Im not well versed in biology, and this device combines automatics with that science.Good heavens, why would they do such a thing?The Gontas are trying to dominate the Zalizniaks permanently, Gavin said.This is an experiment in that area.Feng can still think and act, but is perfectly obedient.And would never chase pretty girls again, he added silently.Not unless he was ordered to.Alice thought a moment.Feng, she said, obey your own orders.Think for yourself and do as you wish.Fengs entire body twitched as if hed been jolted by electricity.His face contorted and he made a small sound.His hands flew up to the spider.The sound he made grew louder and louder, and the facial contortions showed pain.Never you mind, Feng!Alice cried.Obey me now!Go back to the way you were!Feng instantly calmed and went still.Sit down, Feng, Gavin said.You look tired.Feng sat on the deck and looked grateful.I wonder if we can have him ask for something, Alice mused.Gavin squatted next to the exhausted Feng.He wanted to put an arm around Feng, but he couldnt quite bring himself to touch the puckered flesh or the evil spider.Im sorry, was all he could say.Well find a way to help you once everything calms down.Speak for yourself, if you wish, Alice said.Say whatever you think you should say.Alice!Gavin said.No!Speaking is different from acting or thinking, Alice said.Feng had already opened his mouth.Wha Wha, he said.Go ahead, Alice said.Say what you want when you please.Why did you come back for me?Feng burst out.What possessed you?This took Gavin completely by surprise.He floundered a response.Finally Alice said in a small voice, We had to save you.So you believe.Fengs face was set like rock.I dont understand, Gavin said.Youd rather we left you there?Look at me!he spat.How do you think my family will receive me now?I already live in disgrace, and now Im a living wreck.We couldnt leave you there, Alice replied stubbornly.It was our fault you were captured, and it was our duty to save you.Not everyone wants to be saved, Alice!Feng cried.Did you ever consider that?Alice said, Youre talking nonsense.Am I?The Cossacks are coming to kill everyone in the circus because you saved me.If you had simply walked away, none of this would be happening.And those children would still be in cages, Gavin shot back.You could have taken them away without coming for me, Feng said.The Cossacks became truly upset only when you used that that music thing.Now they want it, and they are angry at you because you could not let me go.Gavin took a step backward at that.He had never mentioned the words that Adames had spoken or the cards Linda had drawn to Feng.He looked at Alice.I am not discussing this, she said firmly, but Gavin recognized the stress in her voice and in the set of her mouth.We need to find Dr.Clef and my little automatons so we can gather some things and evacuate.The Cossacks will be here any moment.Her words hit Gavin hard.He looked about the Lady, the graceful, comfortable ship he had built with his own hands.They couldnt reassemble and inflate the envelope in time to fly her out of Kiev, which meant that in less than an hour she would be in the hands of the Gonta family.The thought made him sick.Lets look for Dr.Clef below, Alice said.Feng, you too.Feng checked Dr.Clefs stateroom while Alice went to her own room carrying Kemps head.Gavin headed for the laboratory.It was a snowstorm of papers diagrams and equations pinned to the walls and to the workbench like captured snowflakes.Gavin stared.The diagrams consistently portrayed two objects: Dr.Clefs eye twisting Impossible Cube, and pieces of Gavins paradox generator.Several equations, many done in purple crayon, tugged at his eye.The plague stirred, then roared to life.He dove into the equations and guzzled them down.The square root of two.Matter and energy.Parallel particles locked together.Vibrating strings.Electricity that cycled around an irrational number.And he knew what Dr.Clef wanted.A chill dropped through him, freezing him from scalp to instep.Hes not anywhere on the ship, Alice said.She held Click in her arms, and a flock of little automatons hovered around her and perched on her shoulders.Feng came up behind her.The lab was almost too crowded to move.Feng didnt find him, either.Do you have any ideas?Before Gavin could answer, a faint rumble crept up through his boots, then died away.Another rumble that died, then another.A second chill followed the first.Can you feel that?Gavin said.Footsteps.Is that what it is?Alice whispered.Good heavens.What makes them?Feng asked.He had found a shirt, which covered the scars on his chest and torso, though the spider on his face and neck still gave him a sinister appearance.He also seemed to have calmed down from his earlier rant.At least he could still speak freely.The Cossack mechanicals.Theyre coming.Gavin listened, let the vibrations shake through his body, and his brain worked out more math.Eighteen minutes, twenty seconds.We need to leave, said Alice in a no nonsense voice that was nonetheless filled with tension.Where would Dr.Clef have gone?Gavin gestured at the diagrams.A strange calm came over him, and the words fell from his mouth like lead lumps.The Cossacks are the least of our worries, Alice.Dr.Clef wants the dam.The dam?What for?Hes found a way to get back the Impossible Cube, said Gavin, and I think hes going destroy the universe.There was a long, long pause.What?Feng said at last.What?said Alice at the same time.Hes going to destroy the universe, Gavin repeated.With the Impossible Cube.Feng put a hand on the spider scrawled across his face.I do not understand.Nor do I, Alice said.A little automaton buzzed too close to her face and she brushed it away.He told me himself that re creating the Impossible Cube was well, impossible.He isnt going to re create it, Gavin said, trying not to get more upset.The Cube still exists.Or it will, very soon.I am still not following this, Feng said.They didnt share his fear because they didnt understand.Gavin tried to keep his voice steady to explain, but ideas formed and rushed out of him like water bursting from a dam.Dr.Clef has been working on a project he wouldnt tell us about, remember?And my paradox generator and the cycles in electric power and the alloy that warps gravity when electricity powers it and his proof that time changes depending on local gravity Come on!He pushed past them, through the flock of automatons, and ran up to the main deck.The others followed.Gavin was hoping he was wrong, praying with every fiber of his being that he had misinterpreted what hed seen in the laboratory, but the pieces continued to thud into place like granite weights.He swore and pointed at the roll of alloy wire that had once been the endoskeleton for the ships helium envelope and provided extra lift.The roll still lay on the deck where Alices automatons had placed it, but one end was missing a noticeable piece.He needed a bit of that?Alice said.Whats going on?Not just a bit of that.He was making more in the Black Tent.I was using some of it, but he kept the rest, Gavin said.He needs a lot of it.But what for?Alice demanded.I still dont  Oh!Oh!Good heavens!I understand now.What?Feng ran a hand over the spider on his face.What does he plan?Alices expression grew agitated, and her spiders danced around her feet, mimicking her mood.Click sat nearby and washed a paw.When Gavin last used the Impossible Cube in the Doomsday Vault, it disappeared and we assumed it had been destroyed.But Gavin thinks the reason it disappeared is that it went through time.Not quite, Gavin said.The Cube is a constant, which means it didnt move.It actually twisted time around itself, and since were in the stream of time, it appeared to us that   Does that matter?Alice cried, and several of her automatons squeaked in alarm.Gavin!Hes going to reach through time to snatch the Impossible Cube out of the past at the moment you destroyed it.Feng, listen the alloy cycles electricity at frequencies of power that match the sounds made by Gavins paradox generator.Those frequencies are the same the square root of two.The Impossible Cube itself is built around that very number.If Dr.Clef pumps enough electricity through Gavins generator at the right intervals, he could, I believe, create a sort of opening into the past that would allow him to bring the Impossible Cube into the present.Why is this bad?Feng said.The Impossible Cube has enormous power, does it not?We could destroy the Cossack clockworkers with a single blow.His voice became grim.I will do it myself.Gavin wanted to shake Feng.The other man didnt understand.Gavin remembered with clockwork clarity that awful night he had held the Impossible Cube in his own hands in the dungeons beneath Third Ward headquarters, how the Cube crackled with energy between his palms as he sang one note that the Cube twisted into pure power that pounded through stone and ripped away rock.Dr.Clef doesnt want to destroy the Gontas and Zalizniaks, Gavin said carefully.Hes obsessed with time.His calculations, Alice said.When he was talking about clocks orbiting the earth and gravity changing time.It was nonsense, I thought.No, Gavin told her.Look, I nearly destroyed the entire Third Ward with the Cube and the finite power of a single note from my voice.Another note made the Cube travel through time.Yet another destroyed all the visible light energy within a hundred yards of the Cube.When you feed it a single note, it affects mere energy, but what do you think would happen if Dr.Clef played the infinite sound of my paradox generator into it?Good heavens.Alice put a pale hand to her mouth as another set of footsteps shook the ship.Gavin nodded, unhappy that she was afraid, but glad she understood.The paradox generator makes an infinite sound based on an irrational number: the square root of two.The Impossible Cube is a singular object, and it twists an infinite amount of time and space around itself using the square root of two as the basis for everything it does.If Dr.Clef feeds that infinite sound into the Impossible Cube, hell have the power to stop time.Everywhere.Forever.Now Feng went pale around the spider and his voice fell into a whisper.Would he do such a thing?Of course he would, Alice replied faintly.He thinks hes helping us.We dont have enough time to do everything we need, and his own time in this world is growing shorter.This is his way of giving us more time.An infinite amount.I see.Feng paused, and the ship shook yet again.Gavin automatically calculated: ten minutes, five seconds before they arrived.Except there should be no problem.He does not have your paradox generator.Gavin blinked and relief made his muscles go limp.Thats true, he said.I had it in the Gonta Zalizniak house.Oh, thank goodness.Alice ran her hand over her face and sighed heavily.Were saved.Where is the generator right now, then?He paused.I that is  Gavin.Alices face went tight again.Where is it?Gavin bit his lip and his heart started a snare drumbeat again.He had to think for a moment.Everything had gotten so busy, and there was the little girls death and the boys reunion with his father and the argument with Dodd.The generator hadnt seemed important.What had happened to it?The heavy footsteps continued to shake the ship.I think I left it on the elephant, he said at last.And if Dr.Clef is not on the ship, Feng began.They all traded horrified looks, then bolted for the ladder.In seconds, Gavin, Feng, Alice, Click, and the automatons were all racing back toward the elephant.People still rushed around the circus grounds.A number of the performers had vanished into Kiev, but those who had children or who couldnt travel easily or who were unwilling to abandon wagons were still busy.Trash and a tent or two littered the square around the Tilt.The train stood still, though a curl of smoke drifted up from the engines smokestack.The watching crowd had vanished, scattered by the sound of mechanical footsteps.They knew what was coming.A line of circus wagons and horses moved down the street toward the stone bridge and the road out of town.Upriver, the dam housed its spinning turbines even as it held back countless tons of water beneath a cloudy sky.The sheer power in it made Gavins fingers tingle.A few blocks away, between the buildings, Gavin caught a glimpse of metal.The Cossack mechanicals.His stomach tightened as he saw the distance left for the circus to travel to the bridge.Where is the elephant?Alice asked.The elephant was gone.Bastard!Gavin snarled.The clockwork plague thundered through him.Dr.Clef had thwarted him, deliberately disobeyed his order to destroy the paradox generator and now he had stolen it for himself.He was waiting for us to leave it.Hes got the elephant and my paradox generator!What do we do now?Feng asked.He seemed surprisingly calm.Numbers clicked and spun in Gavins head.These people arent going to make it.They need more time.We have to warn them.Alice looked increasingly desperate.They need to abandon everything and run.We cannot run fast enough to warn them, either, Feng said.Gavin glanced about.If they made for the dam, the Gontas would kill everyone in the circus, including Dodd and Nathan and Linda and Charlie.If they warned the circus, Dr.Clef would be able to stop time forever.Save a few people, or save the universe.More numbers ran through his mind, painting new realities behind them.The choice was obvious.Come on, Alice, Gavin said.Ill need your help.And he ran straight toward the Cossack mechanicals.Chapter Fourteen  Alices heart stopped.The plagues driven him completely mad, she thought.Now what do I do?Come on, Feng!she shouted, and ran after Gavin.Feng twitched once and followed with Alices automatons.Gavin had a decent head start, however, and he wasnt wearing a skirt, so he kept his lead.Gavin!she yelled.What are you doing?But he ignored her.The narrow street that led into the square was packed with a single file line of large mechanicals, the same ones Alice had seen in the dungeon below the Gonta house.She remembered counting forty, and it appeared that nearly so many thumped down this street, cracking the cobblestones with the sound of angry gods.The smallest was twice as high as she was, and most of them were at least two stories tall.All of them bristled with weaponry swords and launchers and rifles and objects she couldnt discern.Alice remembered the clockwork revolution headed by the Gontas and the Zalizniaks that had ended the Russian and Polish occupation of Ukraine, and she began to understand why the occupiers hadnt stood a chance.Most of the mechanicals were topped by a glass bubble, and in each sat a Gonta.The machinery spewed ashy clouds of smoke and fumes.The streets were only wide enough to allow one mechanical at a time to pass, which was why they came in a deadly single file, heading for the circus.Once they reached the square, they could spread out and follow the river.Dodds little collection of automatons and fragile wagons wouldnt stand a chance, and when the Gontas crushed them into meat and metal matchsticks, it would be Alices fault for bringing them here.More death on her head.Gavin ran lightly up the street to the lead mechanical, which was close to eighteen feet tall.Danilo Gonta sat in the bubble, his expression cool and calm, his white lab coat stained with blood.Then he saw Gavin, and his face twisted into an animal snarl.Thats right, Danilo!Gavin shouted.You want me, not them!Inside the bubble, Danilo spun something, and a rifle on the shoulder of his mechanical turned.It fired a burst of bullets, but Gavin was already moving, diving away from the gunfire and toward the mechanical.He shouldnt have been able to dodge the hail, but the plague was clearly working on him, and he flicked around almost faster than Alice could follow.Her heart climbed into her throat, and she desperately cast about for something anything she could do to help him.Gavin reached Danilos mechanical, which had stopped in its tracks to fire at him and thereby blocked the progress of the other Gontas behind it.They stomped their feet, and a few of them made BEEP sounds Alice had never heard before.People from the surrounding buildings fled into the streets and away.Clearly theyd seen altercations before.Alice stayed close to a brick wall with Feng, Click, and her automatons and forced herself to remain calm, to think as frightened people streamed past her.Even from here, she could trace the workings of the lead mechanical, see the way it moved and how it fit together.Was there a weak spot she could exploit?If only she could figure out what Gavin was   Gavin jumped onto one of the mechanicals broad feet and climbed like a monkey.In a flash, Alice understood what was going on.Brilliant!She hoped it was Gavins idea, and not something dreamed up by the clockwork plague.She very much wanted to feel pride for his intelligence instead of fear for his sanity.With a quick motion, Alice snatched up Click and turned to the whirligig mechanicals hovering behind her.You carried Aunt Edwina when she tried to steal the giant war machine outside London last summer, she said to them.Can you carry me?They squeaked and bobbed up and down in midair with obvious enthusiasm.Feng, she said without thinking, wait here with my spiders.You, you, you, and you, she continued, pointing to different whirligigs, carry me to that mechanical.Quick!The whirligigs took Alice firmly by the shoulders and back of her dress and lifted.Their propellers spun madly only inches away from Alices face, but they lifted her handily from the ground.Wait!Feng cried.Alice, I cannot   But Alice was already rushing toward the big mechanical with Click in her arms.The sensation of flight swooped through her, filling her with exhilaration despite the danger.Why had she never tried this with her automatons before?Gavin had managed to skitter up to Danilos bubble.The Gontas behind them were becoming angrier and angrier, but they were still hemmed in by the narrow street and unable to do anything.Gavin clambered up to the very top of Danilos bubble.One of Danilos hands swiped at him.Gavin leaped over it.When he landed, he made a face at the Gonta behind Danilo, a plump man in brown leather.Good thing I killed Ivana!Gavin shouted at him.They can feed China now!She had more rolls than a bakery!Alice held her breath.Danilo swiped at him again, like a man swatting at a fly, but Gavin nimbly leaped away.The Cossack behind Danilo was getting angry.Alice could see him turn red and purple, and it would have been funny if Gavin hadnt been dancing with death.She was almost there.You could stand to lose a few pounds yourself, Gavin taunted him.Gain any more weight, and planets will orbit you.The arm of the mechanical behind Danilo tracked around and its fingers revealed themselves to be rifle barrels.You dont have the guts, Gavin yelled.Its all lard!Too late Danilo realized what was going on.Ni!he shouted into the speaking tube, but his fat brother Cossack had already fired.Gavin dropped down to the chest piece of Danilos mechanical and hung there by his fingertips just as the fat Gontas ammunition slammed into Danilos bubble.The glass exploded.Danilo flew out of the mechanical and smacked the brick streets.He twitched once and lay still.With her free hand, Alice gestured at the fat Cossack.There!Go!The automatons skimmed over the mechanical with the shattered bubble.Alice caught a glimpse of Gavin hoisting himself with the incredible agility of a clockworker into the drivers seat, where he took up the controls.Then her own automatons dropped her on the bubble of the fat Cossack.Click fell from her arms and she scrabbled a moment on the smooth glass before regaining her balance.Behind, the other Gontas were still trapped in the narrow street, and unlike their brother, seemed unwilling to fire on their own family, especially now that Gavin had shown the disastrous consequences of doing so.The fat Cossack in the mechanical looked up, surprised.Cut, Click!Alice ordered.Click extended hard claws and scrawled a wide circle in the glass just as he had done on the roof of LArbre Magnifiques greenhouse.Alice stamped in the center, and the circle fell in, striking the Gonta on the head.He shouted at her in Ukrainian, but Alice was already giving orders to her little automatons.They zipped into the mechanical like hornets invading a beehive, snatched the fat Gonta up, and yanked him out into open air.He yelped, chins quivering.The automatons labored hard, and Alice tugged him upward as well, then kicked him over the side.He fell away, and the automatons let him go.Alice herself dropped into the opening and found herself sitting on a padded bench at the controls.Click leaped down to join her.Alices inborn talent with automatics let her see instantly what went where.Pedals for the legs, hand controls for the arms, a number of switches and dials for other functions.She spun the mechanical around to face the other Cossacks.All this had happened in only a few seconds.The remaining Gontas hadnt been expecting to be attacked.Their surprise combined with the confined space to render them helpless, but only for the moment.Already, rifles and launchers were clicking around to train on Alice.In a strategically placed mirror mounted on the controls, she could see Gavin behind her.The weapons were trained on him, too.A strange calm descended over her, as if she were sinking into a bath of ice water that sent all emotion into hibernation.Moving with care and deliberation, she made the mechanical scoop up the squawking fat Gonta in one metallic hand.You dont want the circus, Alice said into the mechanicals speaking tube.Her voice boomed against the high gray buildings on either side of the street.You want us.Gavin and me.We will destroy you!said one of the Cossacks.Alice couldnt tell which, but she supposed it didnt matter, when they spoke with one voice.Not today.Back up or Ill kill him.You risked your life to save dying children.You would not kill helpless man.That stymied Alice.The Cossack was right.She loathed the filthy Gonta Zalizniak family, but the thought of crushing one of them in her hands, even mechanical hands, only brought up sickening memories of the dead girl.The weapons whined with power.Alice!Gavin called behind her.Duck!Immediately Alice dropped the mechanical into a crouch.Something flew over her head, but instead of striking any of the mechanicals, the object hit one of the nearby buildings.The thing exploded.Smoke and the sharp smell of gunpowder enveloped Alice, and Click hissed on the bench next to her.The building leaned precariously, then toppled into the street with rocky thunder.It was higher than the street was wide, so it smashed into the building across from it, creating a diagonal barrier.Alice felt the concussion thud against her very bones, and she was suddenly glad that the people had fled the surrounding structures.The ruined building effectively blocked the street between Alice and the rest of the Cossacks and, incidentally, prevented both sides from firing at each other.Alice dropped the fat Gonta, who yelped and hobbled away on a sprained ankle.If you want us, come and get us, Gavins voice taunted.Alice took the cue.She and Gavin both turned their mechanicals and ran with the faint howls of Cossack outrage following behind.If you wanted to get them even angrier, you succeeded handily, Alice called.At least theyll be chasing us and not going after the circus, Gavin called back.We cant  Shit!He brought his mechanical up short, and Alice nearly crashed into him.Whats wrong?she asked.Whats ?Feng!A pang went through Alice.She spun her mechanical.Nearly half a block up the street, past where they had already run, stood Feng, exactly where she had left him.He was surrounded by her little mechanicals.Feng, wait here with my spiders.Idiot!She had ordered him to stay there, and now he couldnt move.Even as she watched in horror, a Cossack projectile launched itself over the stony barrier blocking the street and described an arc that would carry it straight toward Feng.He looked up at it, his eyes wide despite the spider on his head.Desperately, Alice looked at the controls of her mechanical.Her mind made quick connections, and she remembered something she had seen a mechanical guard do in the Gonta Zalizniak house.Praying she had it right, Alice flipped two switches and yanked a lever.The projectile began to fall, whistling as it came down toward Feng.The right arm of Alices mechanical burst free of the main body and flew toward Feng, trailing a cable.The projectile dropped closer.Just as the mechanicals hand hit Feng, Alice yanked back, killing the momentum and closing the fingers around Fengs body.He made a hoik sound and Alice yanked.The spiders leaped aboard the fist right when it snatched Feng backward.The projectile hit the cobblestones and exploded, but Feng and the spiders were already well beyond its reach.Alice held Feng up in front of her bubble.Are you all right?Do not put me through that again, he said.You    dont need to save everyone.I know.Just just shut it, Feng.She dropped him into Gavins mechanical.We have to find Dr.Clef.Alice ran with Gavin past the remains of the circus, hoping that the Cossacks would indeed follow them and leave the circus alone.There was nothing for it now if they didnt Alice and Gavin had to stop Dr.Clef.They had no time.Or, very soon, they would have an infinity of it.The mechanical ran beside the gray water as fast as Alice could make it go.Half a mile upriver, the heavy dam seemed to glower down at the city.If Dr.Clef managed to stop time for the entire universe, would she even know?Would she and everyone else simply freeze like fireflies trapped in amber, aware but unable to act?Or would she simply cease to exist, along with everything else?Ice ran through her veins, and the Cossacks coming behind her suddenly didnt seem like such a big problem.They arrived at the bottom of the dam.It made a wall four or five stories tall.Angry water boiled and roared at the base, and a number of stone buildings huddled around it.A network of heavy cables led from the dam to a snarl of iron towers on the bank.Near the entrance to one of the buildings stood the half wrecked elephant.Hes here!Alice shouted to Gavin over the roaring water.But where did he end up?I dont know a thing about dams.I dont, either.Gavin looked stricken.I didnt think of that.A faint vibration shivered up the mechanical though Alices body.More mechanical footsteps.Gavin felt it, too.Fourteen minutes, he said.At least they didnt stop to destroy the circus.Alice cast about, looking for something, anything that might tell her where to   Click!she exclaimed.The cat looked up at her quizzically from the padded bench.Alice made the mechanical kneel, popped the bubble, and climbed down.Click followed, as did the spiders and whirligigs.What are you doing?Gavin called from his own mechanical.Feng sat pale next to him.Alice paused a moment to look at the elephant.Her practiced eye told her the pistons had seized and its memory wheels had frozen.The poor thing would never move again.She patted it once in sorrow.She didnt believe that living animals, let alone mechanical ones, had souls, but she hoped that somehow, somewhere, some piece of this magnificent beast survived.Alice?Gavin said.Good heavens!This was no time for philosophical rumination.She turned to the mechanical cat.Click!she said.Find Dr.Clef!The cat cocked his head, but didnt move.Finally, he sat down.Youre asking the cat?Gavin said.He wont   Alice cut him off with a gesture.Shush!Click, go!Click stood up again, stretched, and with studied nonchalance, wandered toward one of the buildings.It was just occurring to Alice that a power production factory must employ a large number of people, and they should be here somewhere, when the large doors that Click seemed to have chosen burst open and a horde of men in work clothes stampeded into the street.Click and Alice only barely dodged aside.The men looked wild eyed and fearful as they ran for it, scattering in a dozen different directions.Gavin and Feng watched from the safety of the mechanical.What on earth?Alice asked when they passed.I do not wish to know what frightened them so badly, Feng said.Alice ignored him.Click was already heading for the open doors.She followed him with her spiders and whirligigs.Come on, Feng.
