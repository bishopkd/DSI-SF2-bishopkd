 BEFORE He always set aside twelve days of his annual retreat to finish reports and studies, and that left twelve more for everything else.In earlier times, he had foolishly tried retreats within comm reach of his workplace, and that was not at all helpful.There would always be some crisis, something for which his help would be required.As his salary and sense increased, he took his retreats farther and farther away, until at last he found himself going off planet to distant temples where the rule of silence and solitude could not be broken by convenient technologies.This season, he had chosen Gharvi, a place with small wooden buildings scattered around a huge temple of stone, all set within the rain shadow of a mountain range.An endless ocean, both vista and inspiration, ran parallel to the mountains, and a beach between the two offered long walks to nowhere on either side.A place of two deserts, some said, for sea and land were bleak togetherone boundless, one narrow, and both thirsty.There was a place at home very like it, and that had probably influenced his choice, but the sky was unique.The atmosphere was the cloudy bluish lavender of a recently bioformed planet, and the sun was scorching bright.It was so unlike the cool, strong blues and gentle sunlight of his home world that for the first few days he kept his head down and his door closed till nightfall.On the twelfth day, he took his handheld, replete with work well completed, and put it in the box outside his hermitage door.He cooked and ate his evening lentils, slept soundly through the night, and rose to prepare his morning porridge.There was a little water left over from the day before (he was ever frugal), but to have enough for washing he had to fetch the new days supply from the box.The young acolytes of the temple always put sufficient water and food into each hermits box before dawn.It was enough to stay clean, to fill the solar pot with porridge or pottage, and to sip and slake the constant thirst that was the natural consequence of dry air and silence.The acolytes would also take away his handheld and safely transmit its contents to his workplace.But his handheld was still there.He paused, confused by this disconnect in the seamless order of the temples routine.He stared at the untouched box.He looked up and frowned in puzzlement at the squat shape of the temple, vaguely visible through a haze of heat, blown sand, and sea spray.Then he shrugged and went on with his day, a little dustier, a little thirstier, but convinced that an explanation would eventually be made manifest.The following morning, well before dawn, the sound of the box lid closing woke him from a sleep made restless by dreams of dryness.He waited a bit, then went to bring in the supplies and drink deeply of the water.His handheld was gone, and a double ration of food sat in its place.He did not even peer into the darkness to catch sight of the tardy acolyte.Order had been restored.Dllenahkh, with your level of sensitivity and strength, you must go on retreat regularly.So he had been told long ago by the guestmaster of his monastery.You are constantly looking to set things to rights, even within yourself.A retreat will teach you again and again that you are neither indispensable nor self sufficient.Put bluntly, learn to stop meddling.Commitment is important, detachment equally so.He congratulated himself on his developing ability to keep curiosity in check and spent the next few days in undisturbed meditation and reflection.One day, after a long morning meditation, he felt thirsty and decided to get more water from his supply box.He stepped out with his glass drinking bowl in hand and set it on the edge of the box while he tilted the half lid and reached inside.His hands were steady as he poured water smoothly from the heavy, narrow necked jug.Moving slowly, he straightened and took a moment of blissful idleness, the jug left uncovered near his feet, to squint at the suns glare on the desert beach and the desert ocean and to feel the coolness of the water creeping into his palms as he held the bowl and waited to drink.It was a childs game, to hold a bowl of water and mark the increase of thirst with masochistic pleasure, but he did it sometimes.He brought the bowl to his mouth and had a perfect instant of pale blue ocean, bright blue glass, and clear water in his vision before he blinked, sipped, and swallowed.Many times afterward, when he tried to recall, his mind would stop at that vivid memorythe neatly nested colors, the soothing coolness of the glassand not wish to go any further.It was not long after that, not very long at all, that the day became horribly disordered.A man walked out of the ocean, his head darkly bright with seawater and sunlight.He wore a pilots suitiridescent, sleek, and permeablethat would dry as swiftly as bare skin in the hot breeze, but his hair he gathered up in his hands as he approached, wringing water out from the great length of it and wrapping it high on the crown of his head with a band from his wrist.Recognition came to Dllenahkh gradually.At first, when the figure appeared, it was a pilot; then, as it began to walk, it was a familiar pilot; and finally, with that added movement of hands in hair, it was Naraldi, a man well known to him but not so well known as to excuse the early breaking of a retreat.He opened his mouth to chide him.Six more days, Naraldi!Could anything be so important that you could not wait six more days?That was what he intended to say, but another thought came to him.Even for a small planet with no docking station in orbit, it was highly uncommon for a mindship to splash down so close to land that a pilot could swim to shore.Although he knew Naraldi, they were not so close as to warrant a visit at this time and in this place.The pilot slowed his step and looked uncertainly at him with eyes that streamed from the irritation of salt water.Something terrible has happened, Dllenahkh said simply.Naraldi wiped at his wet face and gave no reply.My mother?Dllenahkh prompted to break the silence, dread growing cold and heavy in his stomach.Yes, your mother, Naraldi confirmed abruptly.Your mother, and my mother, andeveryone.Our home is no more.Our world is No.Dllenahkh shook his head, incredulous rather than upset at the bitterness and haste of Naraldis words.What are you saying?He remembered that he was still thirsty and tried to raise the bowl again, but in the meantime his hands had gone chilled and numb.The bowl slipped.He snatched at it but only deflected it so that it struck hard on the side of the water jug and broke just in time to entangle his chasing fingers.Oh, was all he said.The cut was so clean, he felt nothing.Im sorry.Let me He crouched and tried to collect the larger fragments but found himself toppling sideways to rest on one knee.Naraldi rushed forward.He grasped Dllenahkhs bleeding right hand, yanked the band from his hair, and folded Dllenahkhs fist around the wad of fabric.Hold tight, he ordered, guiding Dllenahkhs left hand to clamp onto his wrist.Dont let go.Ill get help.He ran off down the beach toward the temple.Dllenahkh sat down carefully, away from the broken bits of glass, and obediently held tight.His head was spinning, but there was one small consolation.For at least the length of time it took Naraldi to return, he would remember the words of the guestmaster: he would not be curious, he would not seek to know, and he would not worry about how to right the tumbled world.I remember when the Sadiri came.We gathered at the port to cheer their arrival and, frankly, to gawk a bit.The Sadiri consider themselves to be the pinnacle of human civilization.Imagine them settling on Cygnus Beta, a galactic hinterland for pioneers and refugees!Well, these ones apparently were willing to break the moldbut then again, a lot of things had been broken past repair, and sometimes it makes more sense to create something new.They looked almost Cygnianeyes, hair, and skin all somewhere on the spectrum of brownexcept for the bright iridescence of the hair and a subtler sheen to the skin that was only noticeable in full sunlight.As it was the dry season, there was plenty of that.They looked up into the sun and appeared relieved at the heat.Dont tell me they werent; that impassive Sadiri stereotype is a load of crap.They have body language.They have expressions.Just because its not their way to yell their emotions out like most people doesnt mean they dont have them.Parliamentary representatives welcomed them formally but briefly, and they were taken to their homesteadings in fine diplomatic style.Everyone felt sorry for the Sadiri in those early days, and maybe we were all a little bit overproud of ourselves for hosting them.Cygnus Beta isnt a rich colony by any means, but we understand fleeing disaster and war and disease and struggling to find a place where youre wanted.A lot of people act like misfortune is contagious.They dont want to be exposed to it for too long.Theyll take you in and make all the right gestures and noises, but when the months wear on and youre still in their house or their town or their world, the welcome starts to wear a bit thin.So we understood, and maybe we were making a point, too.There isnt a group on Cygnus Beta who cant trace their family back to some world shattering event.Landless, kinless, unwantedtheoretically, the Sadiri would fit right in.Those were the thoughts that were foremost in my mind the day the Sadiri came.I barely even noticed when my friend Gilda said to me, But where are the women?I should have paid attention.Its not that all male homesteader groups dont come to Cygnus Beta.Many times people send the strongest and most intrepid to establish a level of comfort on the homesteads before sending for the rest of the family, and for some cultures that translates as men only.The reality of Cygnian society is that those men often end up settling down with someone whos already here, because, let me tell you, theres no long distance relationship like an interstellar one, especially when youre all but marooned on a rock where communication with the rest of the galaxy means week delayed real space transmissions from the nearest long range sat.ButSadiri men?The epitome of morality and tradition, savants too absorbed in their mental exercises to succumb to base urges?It was hard to imagine them going native like most frontier boys.Fortunately for my curiosity, I was in a position to find out about them.Im second assistant to the Chief Biotechnician of Tlaxce Province, which means that I get to travel a lot because its the biggest province, and its also the province with the largest number of new homesteads.Sadiri homesteads galore, in other words.Plus, and keep this one quiet, please, Im kind of a language nut.Old languages, new languages, made up languageswhatever, thats my hobby.I already had a smattering of Sadiri, so it was inevitable that I would get stuck with the duty of liaison for the public health and agriculture departments.My opposite number was a joy to work with.No chitchat, no wasted time.Id turn up at his office, hed go over the schedule briefly with me, and off wed go in a groundcar to do our inspections.His Standard was better than my Sadiri, needless to say, so many times I just did a lot of listening while he talked with the homesteaders, and then afterward hed summarize for me so I wouldnt miss anything.I didnt expect them to speak Standard to me.When youve been almost exterminated, language is the first thing you cling to, one of the main roots of identity.One day, while we were driving back to his office, a very interesting conversation took place.Dllenahkh, I said to him (learning to pronounce his name had been a fine challenge, but once I substituted a Zulu dl and a Scots ch, I got it), tell me how we can help you in the long term.What kind of settlement do you plan to establish?We understand if your aim is to keep as much of Sadira alive as possible.Do you require Sadiri plants?Hardy variants crossed with the indigenous flora or hothouse specials in biodomes?We can requisition anything we like from the galactic seed bank or even check with New Sadira to see what strains theyre developing.Thank you, Second Assistant Delarua, but at present it is enough for us to adjust to the environment and achieve basic self sufficiency with what is readily available.Closer consideration of our long term goals will follow after the completion of the initial phase.I must confess, I liked listening to Dllenahkh.He had a very soothing voicedeep, somewhat slow, and very precise.It was a voice that matched his thoroughness and professionalism.I wish I had a voice that matched what I do.Ive been told I sound like an overexcited rooster when I start rambling about my work.There is one matter in which you can assist us, however, Dllenahkh continued.Our community is relatively isolated, and it has been suggested that it would be appropriate for us to take the opportunity to experience other cultures on Cygnus Beta.To participate.Tomingle.He used Standard for that last, there being no precise equivalent in Sadiri that could convey the frivolous intent behind such a word.Mingle?I repeated incredulously.Yes.Mingle.While much remains to be done, we are beginning to suffer from a lack of mental stimulus.Cygnus Beta is reputed to have some of the most complex and vibrant cultures in the galaxy.It would be appropriate to study them.I gave him a slanted look.Id been around the Sadiri long enough to learn that whenever they start claiming something is appropriate, theres something theyre not telling you or something theyre not admitting to themselves.Dllenahkh had said appropriate twice now.He mirrored my look, which Id learned was his style of humor.So.Do you have any recommendations?Do I have any recommendations for a Sadiri boys night out?I shrugged, smiled, and allowed myself a laugh.I can come up with something.I did, too.The Ministry of Culture has all kinds of programs, and I got someone to put together a package that even the Sadiri might enjoy.But people, this is Cygnus Beta.Yes, we have a few large cities and several townswere not all country bumpkins, vagabonds, and adventurersbut there are few professional artists and actors, few galactic standard museums and theaters.We simply cant afford them.Its true that most of the action happens in the urban belt, but often bands of entertainers travel around and test their lucksome venues they might get paid in credits; other places itll be in kind.I did speak to one performer who waxed poetic about the joys of the road and how hed made a map with locations marked for the excellence of their particular product: the best wines and spirits, of course; the best baked goods; the best cured meat and smoked fish; the most fragrant smoking herbs for incense or pipeyou name it, he could tell you where to get it.I should point out that amateur or semiprofessional doesnt mean low quality.It means variable quality.You get serious thespians next to dilettante wannabes because theater companies have to take people as and when they become available.Your best King Lear might be the security guard at a small branch of a city bank.Hes only going to get two or three weeks off for performances, then youre back to the understudy, the very earnest but not really that good retired schoolmate of the director.I offered two options: either a series of overnight trips to the urban belt or visits to the Sadiri homesteads by some of the touring companies.Both, said Dllenahkh.Both?I repeated, raising an eyebrow, my tone more flat than querying.He raised an eyebrow back.Both it was.Ive mentioned my friend Gilda before.I love her dearly, but I swear shes a bad influence on just about everyone.I suspect that three out of her six children arent her husbands and that he knows it but doesnt care.Hes so under her thumb, she must have had more than one Zhinuvian ancestor.She has three main groups she hangs out with, and she tries to annoy each one.She bores her housewives group with her science research, she makes her drinking buddies miserable with her tales of domesticity, and she scandalizes her coworkers (thats me) with her lurid sex capades.So Gilda was happy to hear that the Sadiri were venturing out, because she too wanted the opportunity to experience other cultures, if you know what I mean.She insisted on being the coordinator and guide.At first I was glad when she took it out of my hands so that I could go back to ordinary stuff, but this was Gilda, and something told me to inquire more deeply.So, I asked her at the office when she set up the first theater visits, whats the playbill for this trip?Grease: The Space Musical, Titus Andronicus, and that new monologue by Li Chen where he first spends ten minutes crisscrossing the stage in silence, then sits in a Bagua inspired design in the center and periodically plays the Uilleann pipes.Aie yi yi, I yodeled mournfully.Do you want them to judge us?Theyll judge us anyway.Theyre Sadiri, and were Terranwell, mostly Terran.Judging other humans and finding them wanting is what the Sadiri do.She was quite unperturbed about it.At first I said nothing.Strictly speaking, it was true.The Sadiri and their fleet of mindships had been the backbone of galactic law, diplomacy, and scientific discovery for centuries.Even though other humans slightly resented them, I knew I wasnt the only one who quietly hoped that the pared down version of their government would be just as effective at running the fleet.On a personal level, I hadnt noticed a judging attitude from Dllenahkh, but when one considered that their home planet was poisoned by their own close cousins, the Ainya, well, they didnt have that much high ground to stand on to look down at others anymore, did they?Before I could voice that thought, there was a polite cough at my door.Dalenak!Gilda said in cheery greeting.How did Dllenahkh manage not to wince at the womans atrocious pronunciation?Are you here for the inaugural trip?Dllenahkh thanked her courteously and said no, he had but come to consult me regarding the matter of the hydroponics on the homesteads of the southwestern quarter, which had been experiencing some difficulty.She took the hint and her leave so that I could close the door and speak to Dllenahkh in privacy.I thought lying wasnt a Sadiri thing, I began.Then I looked at him more closely.Dllenahkh?Who hit you?It is an internal matter, already resolved, he said.I frowned, but there was nothing I could say to that.You seemdepresseddistracted.Whats brought you to town if its not Gildas entertainment tour?There is a visiting emissary from the Government of New Sadira.We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow.That still didnt explain why Dllenahkh was in my office.Would you like to come with me to the Museum of History?I said.Yes, he acquiesced somewhat absently.That would be quite interesting.We walked there.I kept silent, waiting for Dllenahkh to talk to me.He waited until we had passed the geological displays and entered the Hall of Names before breaking into speech.Do you know why we came to Cygnus Beta?he asked.I glanced at him.His eyes were staring straight ahead at the writing etched on the granite walls.We came to find the taSadiri.He turned his head very slightly and looked at me.Do you know of whom I speak?Sadiri who do not practice the mental disciplines, I replied immediately.They left Sadira and founded Ain, and a few settled elsewhere in the galaxy.But they did not found Cygnus Beta.It was already here.I have heard of the beings you call the Caretakers.He said it neutrally, and I was glad for the small courtesy.Some people think the idea of the Caretakers is just another one of those savior guardian myths that primitive societies dream up to deal with the uncertainty of the universe.Yes, I said firmly, they are the true founders of Cygnus Beta, but we acknowledge other early settlersmostly Terrans, its true, but also Ntshune, Zhinuvians, and taSadiri.There are strong psionic and proto psionic strains in your ancestry, he noted.That was another one of the reasons we chose to come here.I wondered where this was going.So whats wrong, Dllenahkh?He struggled.Clearly these were very private matters.There is a lack of consensus concerning our path.Securing the future of our people is, of course, the primary concern, but the way this can best be achieved is in dispute.Some feel that preserving genetic and cultural integrity would be the most effective course of action.With so few of us surviving, every person would be needed for this endeavor to succeed.Others believe that negotiation with the Ainya with a view to eventual integration of our tribes is the best option.But perhaps that was their reason fordoing what they did, I said awkwardly.Theyve never had your level of galactic influence.Wouldnt integration be kind of like giving them what they want?He paused.Yes, he said at last.Many of us hold the same view.However, from the Ainya perspective, we drove out their forefathers and denied them their birthright; hence their pride in claiming responsibility for our downfall.Perhaps they wish to see us not merely humiliated but destroyed completely.He sighed and continued.A third way has been proposed: colonies of hybrids selected for Sadiri physical traits and mental abilities and raised according to Sadiri values and traditions.A wry smile twitched my lips.Terrans: the chicken stock of every human genetic soup in the galaxy.Terra was the newest of the crafted worlds and Terrans the youngest breed of humans in the galaxy, but what they lacked in technology and mental development, they made up for in sheer evolutionary potential.Other humans patronized them and overlooked them, but just mention hybrid vigor and suddenly Terrans became very popular.Of course, since Terra itself was still under embargo, that meant Cygnus Beta got all the attention.So, I asked him, which Sadiri are you?The second way or the third way?His face went still in that manner I had come to interpret as profound uncertainty.No decision has as yet been made.We are a reserve.I tilted my head and frowned at him, confused.His eyes glanced briefly at mine, and then he blinked and looked aside again as if acutely embarrassed.As many of our off planet occupations are filled by men, more Sadiri males survived the disaster than females.This has created somedisruption to our usual bonding customs.For this reason, the excess of males was sent to this colony.The Science Council of New Sadira will as a priority select for a greater number of females to be born as soon as possible.Given our life span, it is possible that they may be our future wives.I pondered this, realizing the truth of what he said.Most of the Sadiri on Cygnus Beta were, by their standards, very young.But how distressing and strange to spend decades on some kind of genetic backroom shelf waiting ones turn to clinically contribute to the expansion of the species!I said something of the sort to Dllenahkh.He let me know my views were inappropriate.I shut up.The Hall of Names is a very complicated place.The obvious part of it is the walls with the names of the thousand dying nations who came here or were brought here, but there is also a low susurration of a thousand extinct languages; the occasional whiff of smoke, incense, or perfume from various half forgotten rituals; the distant moan and skirl of ancient instruments that no one knows how to make anymore.Its a very apt place to ponder the future of an entire world, but its a little depressing as well.What do you think the emissary is going to say?I asked.Dllenahkh said nothing.Perhaps he did not know.Perhaps he knew but would never tell me.Lets go have lunch, I said.We fell back into our usual routine after that, which is to say we were all business.I knew that the Sadiri homesteaders continued their cultural outreach, visiting the towns and other provinces and permitting visiting groups in return.They did indeed seem to be taking note of how various cultures had adapted to social conditions on Cygnus Beta, so even what appeared to be recreational also had some element of anthropological study to it.I did not delve deeper, and although the Sadiri emissary returned for another visit some months later, I did not quiz Dllenahkh about it.Gilda, on the other hand, was a font of information.She called me at my desk one day, too excited and impatient to walk the few meters to my office.Have you heard the news?Ain has been quarantined.Nothing goes in, nothing comes out.That got my attention.I dropped everything and drew close to my monitor.What?Has the tribunal given the verdict already?Gilda looked very sober, which was extremely unusual for her.The trial isnt over, but Ain is incommunicado.Thats impossible, I stated.The Terran embargo works because we can see everything they do and show them what we want them to see.Ains technology is too advanced.Maybe they did it to themselves.Maybe theyre hiding.She scoffed.Theyre not that advanced.People are saying it was the Caretakers.Personally, Im glad.Sadiras going to be nothing but sterile rock for a very long time.My eyes widened, and I felt a little thrill.The Caretakers!It was as if angels had descended to avenge the Sadiri.I guess they dont like people undoing their work.How are the off planet Ainya handling it?Gilda gave a wry smile.Heres the irony.You know only two fleets have ships that can travel as far as Ain.I laughed without humor.She meant the Zhinuvians, whod charge an arm and a leg for passage, and the Sadiri whowellI wasnt sure what theyd do, but any Ainya would have to have a lot of gall to approach a Sadiri pilot now.The sequestering of Ain was a big change in more ways than one.Even though theres bad blood between Ain and Sadiraseriously bad bloodId had a vague hope that they might come together after a generation or two out of necessity if nothing else.It looked as if the options had been whittled down from three to two, and where that left the Sadiri I had no idea.New Sadira was a small planet, a former science outpost that had gained an unexpected promotion.It would serve for a drastically diminished population, but as it had neither the resources nor the size to replace Sadira properly, the Sadiri would be forced to make a decision about their future sooner rather than later.It was difficult to tell what they were planning to do.Some of the Sadiri were definitely minglingin fact, given their youth, one might even say experimenting.I detected from the sternness of Dllenahkhs expression when some of the more amusing tales were related in his vicinity that the elder Sadiri of the group were barely tolerant of this behavior, but what could they do?Kick the youngsters out?Every Sadiri capable of procreation was precious, and any of them could be brought back into the fold later no matter how they might now be choosing to deal with their shared tragedy.That said, about a couple of months shy of a year after their arrival I found myself in the unenviable position of being mandated by my boss to find out whats going on with those Sadiri.I chose a long road trip to broach the topic with Dllenahkh, reasoning that if we were driving through the middle of nowhere, he wouldnt have any place to escape to.To give myself a level of protection, I turned off the autopilot and nav and drove the groundcar myself.I understand theres been a bit of a Sadiri baby boom, I said delicately, keeping my eyes on the road as I maneuvered through freshly gouged potholes, the result of a strong start to the rainy season.Dllenahkhs teeth clicked as we bounced through a bad patch.It does appear that way, he said eventually with clenched jaws.Is this an indication?I started, and then said, Does this mean a way has been chosen?The silence continued for long enough that I regretfully concluded that Id pushed my luck too far.Then Dllenahkh spoke, sounding slightly injured.Little choice has been offered where these births are concerned.Three of the fathers have been unable to obtain anything more than visiting rights, while a fourth has been charged with sole custody.Two are in a particularly difficult situationtheir children have been acknowledged by other men and are being raised with no recognition of their heritage.In only one case has there been the formation of something resembling a bond, and that man has requested to move to the homestead of his childs mother, there to live, no doubt, according to the culture of her people.I whistled.Added to the other stories Id heard, those were more births and far fewer marriages than I had expected.So, youre telling me youre being fetishized, used, and dumped.Good enough to sleep with but not good enough to marry.Fresh blood.The new kink in town.The Your observations, said Dllenahkh quietly but quellingly, are not particularly welcome at this moment.I felt genuinely ashamed.Sorry.I got a bit carried away.The thing is, weve always been a matriarchal society.Cygnian fathers have little say in decisions about child rearing.I thought you realized that.We continued in silence while I focused on a nasty bit of road slippage.At one stage, Dllenahkh had to get out and push the car through a slurry of fine limestone before it could find purchase once more on firm ground.He got back in, placing his caked work boots on the center of the mat with fastidious precision.It had been a trivial but welcome diversion, easing some of the tension from the atmosphere.My thoughts wandered as I tried to think of what to say, and then, of course, my subconscious took over.Dark they were, and golden eyed, I quoted dreamily.The reference escapes me.Its a classic work of fiction about Terrans who go to colonize Mars.Except Mars colonizes them.It turns them into dark, golden eyed Martians who exactly resemble the extinct indigenous people.Im telling you, if you think you can colonize Cygnus Beta and turn it into Sadira, centuries later all youll have is a slight tendency to shiny hair and pedantic speech in the common Cygnian stock.Oh, Dllenahkh, I am so sorry.I tried to warn you.I do not recall This was too serious for multitasking.I pulled aside, turned off the groundcar, and faced him fully.I asked you what you wanted in the long term.Do you want to be all Sadiri or Sadiri Cygnian?Because if the formers your aim, youre going about it the wrong way.His head dropped wearily, which is as close as a Sadiri can get to a wail of anguish.I do not know what we want.We wish only to survive, and we are trying all possible means to do so.I closed my eyes, struck by a pang of loneliness.If I can tease Gilda about having a dominant Zhinuvian gene in her makeup, then I must also admit that there might be a little too much Ntshune in my own background, an occasional echo of emotions not my own.And Dllenahkh was lonely, no mistake.It poured off him like mist and settled into my bones with a pain as insistent as the ache of an old injury.It was most upsetting.All right.You need to coordinate with the Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance.But Dllenahkh, you have to come clean; none of this juvenilesorry, culturally conditionedembarrassment over the details of Sadiri marriage and bonding customs and no underhanded plots to seduce and indoctrinate women into the Sadiri way of life.Be up front.I mean, you have chosen the right place.Weve already got a mail order bride mentality, and weve been selecting for fecundity for centuries.How many other places could produce so many births in such a short space of time?This is true, said Dllenahkh with what sounded like a glimmer of hope.Plus, you could have it both ways: take a short lived Cygnian wife for the first part of that long life of yours, then go home to your girl brides and start a fresh full blooded family.Just berespectful.Honest.And stop thinking youre the superior ones!Youre just another drop in our gene pool!Were all descended from peoples who thought they were kings and gods and who found themselves to be almost nothing at all in the end.Dont let that be you.He sat in chastened silence for a while, then said humbly, There is merit in what you say.I will discuss the possibilities with our local council and approach the ministry as you have suggested.I exhaled in relief.If only they knew how close they had come to wearing out our patience.If there is one thing a Cygnian cannot bear, its the stench of superiority.Too often it had been a precursor to atrocity and a rationale for oppression.The Sadiri wouldnt change overnight, but at least it was a start.Dark you are, and golden eyed, Dllenahkh said quietly.My eyes are brown, I replied, puzzled to hear a Sadiri say something so nonsensical.I understand that on Terra gold is considered a rare and precious metal.To be golden is to be special, cherished.He looked at me.To me, your eyes are golden, because they have perceived who we truly are.I said nothing.I opened my mouth, failed to breathe, and lowered my eyes from that intense gaze.It hurt too much, like bright sun on tender skin, bright and searing with the beauty of both what had been lost and what remained.For a moment, the blood of my ancestors called out in empathy, and I almost embarrassed myself by crying in front of a Sadiri.I bit my lip, took hold of myself, and the moment passed.Then I started the car, and we traveled on to the next distant homestead.MATCHMAKER, MATCHMAKER Whats this?The department secretary/courier glanced back at the envelope he had tossed onto my desk.How would I know?I looked him up and down.Gilroy was a gawky youngster, too tall yet still growing and plagued with a limp, the result of a bad break on a distant homestead days out from the reach of advanced medical care.He poured all the energy that should have been spent punching cattle into gossipingsorry, gathering intelligence.I picked up the envelope and twirled the ends of the ribbons on the seal, all the while staring at him meaningfully.Wellall right.He gave his usual precursor to a juicy scoop: a quick glance around to make sure no one could overhear.I understand that youve made a good impression on someone, and youre going to have a slight change in duties.I frowned, scared now.The First Assistant Biotechnician was new to her post.Unless she was going on maternity leave or had been sacked, there was no way I was taking her placenot that I wanted to.Theres only so much deskwork I can stand before Im desperate to be out driving through the homesteadings.And there was definitely no way I could be making Chief.What other twists were possible on my career path?I realized Gilroy was watching me and smirking at the panic I hadnt bothered to hide.Right, thanks.Close the door behind you, I said, dismissing him brusquely.I shut my eyes and spun my chair around once, maybe trying to lighten my anxiety, maybe trying some weird little made up luck ritual.Then I broke the seal and pulled out my orders.They want me to do what?As if on cue, my monitor chimed and flashed.I glanced irritably at the message box; then my eyes widened, and I tapped the channel open.Delarua here.Second Assistant Delarua, I believe you must have opened your correspondence by now?My boss tries to get away with stuff by being cute.Shes short and stocky, with big round cheeks and deep dimples.She fools no one.The more she dimples, the more you know youve been screwed over.Chief, I cant believe you didnt discuss this with me first.Whatever happened to the Human Relations and Vocational Guidance Department?Everyone there die of the plague?Fell into a coma?Got amnesia?Even as I spoke my frustration, I reined myself in a little.As dangerous as the dimples were, it was worse if you said something to make them disappear suddenly.My boss didnt permit subordinates to take liberties.Sorry, dear.This came in from over my head.She shrugged.Its only a years assignment.Why not see it as an opportunity to broaden your curriculum vitae?Im a biotechnician!The longer I stay away from my field, the more my CV suffersyou know that!My eyes narrowed.Wait a minute.Someone above you messed with the personnel structure of your department, and youre still smiling?I felt suddenly ill, my stomach going into free fall.You wanted to get rid of me?Why didnt you say Delarua, relax!I have no problem with you or your work.And yes, Im not shattered, but its because of who your replacement is.Then she spoke the name Dr.Freyda Mar, a name that will mean nothing to you or, lets be honest, to most Cygnians, but for those who know the up to date research in the biotech field, it was almost as if Albert Einstein had decided to take a year off from research and teach secondary level general science.Her?What would she want with my crappy little job?Sorry, Chief, but even you must admit that the least glamorous work of the department falls under my remit.I mean, hydroponics, and health inspections, and sewage, and driving hundreds of klicks and sometimes sleeping in barns if youre lucky and in the car if youre not.I mean yes, I like it, but everyone knows Im strange.Well, maybe shes strange too.She wants to write a book about the practical applications of her research.More power to her, I say.Ive always thought academics should get a little slurry on their boots from time to time.I took a deep breath.If Freyda Mar was coming to fill my place for a year, there was no way I was getting out of this.Fine.I see Ive got two months before I go.Whens Dr.Mar coming?In a months time.Youll have the joy of showing her the ropes.The idea of memeshowing Dr.Freyda Mar how to do my job for a whole month so thrilled me to the depths of my techie soul that I completely forgot I was supposed to be angry about leaving for an entire year to gowhere?On a wild goose chase as part anthropologist, part diplomat?The latter half of the week rolled around, and I was on my way to Dllenahkhs office at the usual time to discuss the inspection schedule.I did have a moments pause at his door, wondering how he would react to the news of my assignment, but it was only a moment.Dllenahkhs secretary was of the Gilroy stamp: young, gawky, and more than a little curious at my hesitation.Councillor Dllenahkh is expecting you, he prompted kindly.Thank you, Joral, I muttered, and went through.I tried to explain to Dllenahkh what I thought was going to happenmy assignment, my replacement, and so forth.I kept my tone neutral; I dont believe in behaving either disgruntled or gleeful about work related matters, especially around people outside my department.He leaned forward, set his elbows on the desk, and contemplated his fingers in silence for a while.During that while, I finally realized he was not in the least surprised.Oh.Oh, no.Oh I began to swear.One of the advantages of having languages as a hobby is that it can take you quite a while to run out of swear words.I hadnt even exhausted my list from the dead languages I know when I paused for breath and Dllenahkh spoke up, still apparently addressing his fingers.Could it be that you are vexed with me, Second Assistant Delarua?Could it be that you are laughing at me, Councillor Dllenahkh?Are you the reason for this complication in my life?Please, explain this madness!His brows drew together briefly, erasing that faint suggestion of suppressed amusement that had so irritated me, and he finally looked me in the eye.I fear that you have not been fully briefed as yet.No doubt your superior has informed you of all that she knows and a more detailed mission dossier is forthcoming.I assure you, this is not madness.He got up and walked to the archaic map board that showed Tlaxce Province and the regions bordering it.He faced it, placed his hands behind his back, and unexpectedly exhaled a large sigh.Before I begin, I have not properly thanked you for your recommendation that we seek the assistance of the Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance.As a result, some of the custody cases are being reviewed, and counseling is being provided for the parents and families involved.While it is unlikely that all cases will be resolved amicably, the situation is less fraught than previously.Furthermore, any future attempts at cross cultural partnering will be channeled through the ministrys programs for that purpose.Not bad, I said, pleased and mollified.Theyve been establishing and maintaining unions for generations now.Theyre quite good at what they donot perfect, but far better than nothing.He glanced back at me briefly, then raised a hand to indicate the provinces.Tlaxce, which is the largest province, is also one of the most genetically homogeneous provinces due to the presence of the capital and the main spaceport.We have been advised that if we are seeking Cygnians with a high percentage of taSadiri genetic heritage, we should go to the outlying regions of the neighboring provinces.Still clinging to your concept of purity?I said quietly.Dllenahkh turned and looked at me in a way that I fancied meant, When you lose your home and all but a remnant of your people, feel free to return and lecture me on the ethics of purity.I lowered my eyes.So the mission is to find Cygnian groups that are more taSadiri than the average, I paraphrased meekly.Your facility for the languages of Cygnus Beta is what led me to recommend you as Civil Service liaison.That and your insightfulness.First the stick and then the carrot.He had become quite talented at manipulating Cygnians with a little flattery, I thought sourly.And what role will you play?I have been authorized to assess both the settlements and the people we encounter in order to determine whether it would be more efficient for us to join those settlements, or to encourage potential wives to remove to our settlement here in Tlaxce.Although Dllenahkh would never stoop to smugness, there was an unwarranted certitude in his tone that suggested he had already decided what the obvious choice would be.He took a last look at the map and returned to sit behind his desk.The First Assistant to the Chief Biotechnician is a year younger than you and is likely to serve for at least another five years in her post.The Chief Biotechnician will not retire for at least another twelve years.All higher positions in the department require greater managerial experience and less technical skill.I estimated there was a low probability that your career would be harmed, andI have noticed that you derive a certain amount of enjoyment from our field trips.I hope I did not misinterpret the case.There was the merest hint, the tiniest suggestion of humility and concern in his gaze.I shrugged.Im sorry I swore like that.It was a bit of a shock.Im sure it will all work out.He nodded.Excellent.Then let us begin our rounds, and I will tell you about the other personnel on the mission team.What he did not tell me, what would have been more useful, was the name of the higher up who had managed to deepen the dimples in my bosss cheeks with the bribe of Freyda Mar!Because let me tell you, I want to kiss that person.We were already starstruck and willing to welcome the most eccentric, knee sock wearing, port drinking, absentminded professor type that ever came out of Tlaxce University.But Freyda Mar dressed normally, drank water, remembered everything, andokay, she was a little eccentric, but in a way that everyone could appreciate.She bore a striking resemblance to a tall, middle aged Wicked Witch of the West except not, you know, being actually green.A few days before our first field trip, I looked at her long, wavy black hair, and all I said was, Are you sure?She took one look at my own close cropped do and said, You know, youve got a point.Whereupon I step out to get us some coffee for the mid morning break, and when I get back, the scissors are out of the drawer and on the desk and the wastepaper basket is bristling with a meter lengths worth of hair.Im telling you, my mouth fell open, but she just laughed at me and took the mugs from my hand before I dropped them.In spite of all that, she seemed a little bit nervous about working with Sadiri, so I gave her a quick, casual primer while she worriedly tapped notes into her handheld.Trust me, theyll love you.They dont do small talk and they have a constant need for mind fodder, so feel free to discuss your work in detail.Let them do the heavy lifting; theyve got the high grav build for it, and theyre happy to show off their physical strength.Dont try to shake hands with them.Dont touch anyones head, especially not their hair.Thats a big no no.Custom?Or something else?she asked, stopping in midinput.Thats canny of you, I said approvingly.I dont know for certain, but I think it might have something to do with the telepathy.She nodded, looking thoughtful and a lot more relaxed.Years ago I spent some time doing research at a university in the Punartam System.I met a Sadiri mindship pilot there.He always wore gloves, always kept his head covered.I thought it was cultural at first, but maybe theres more to it than that.Freyda had just proved herself to be a typical techie.Ask her to remember the arbitrary rules of some foreign etiquette and she fretted.Give her a possible scientific explanation for a social behavior and she was fine.Road trips, now, are a real test of character, and I had no idea how she would handle the long and sometimes boring drives.I soon discovered that you could get her to sing from any musical or opera, very loudly, as the car rolled along, and sometimes Id join in, though with less volume and skill.Poor Dllenahkh, who was accustomed to far quieter rides, would look at us sideways with an expression of mild terror.But even Dllenahkh warmed to her when she switched into technical mode.He listened to her very, very closely, their heights almost matching, constantly nodding and nodding as she rattled off some aspect of her latest theory.At one point, I could swear I saw him looking at her almost dreamily, as if he had ceased to listen to the content of her words and was thinking about something else.I was getting ready to tease him about having a romantic crush to rival my professional crush, but then he caught me by surprise the following week.I had been expecting Kavelan to replace him as the homesteading liaison, Kavelan being a young but sober headed subordinate in the office whom I had encountered several times over the past year or so.Instead, a completely new face turned up.It was difficult to guess how old he was, but I estimated from his aura of maturity that he was closer to Dllenahkhs age than the average Sadiri male of the homesteadings.Dllenahkh did the introductions.This is my replacement, Dr.Lanuri.He will be joining us for inspections henceforth.Dr.Lanuri inclined his head, and Freyda and I gave little bows in turn.He had creases on his face that looked suspiciously like laugh lines, but if they were, they had not been used for a very long time.He still bore the slightly vacant expression of deep depression that had characterized Dllenahkh and many of the other Sadiri in the earlier days of settlement.I wish I could say I was given the opportunity to get to know him better, but after a quick briefing on the inspection schedule, Dllenahkh led us out to not one groundcar but two.He said, Given that our vehicles must occasionally serve as temporary shelters, I considered it unwise to approach the passenger limit too closely.Therefore, each team will go in its own groundcar.The nav systems have been linked.I wish you a safe and pleasant journey, Dr.Lanuri, Dr.Mar.And then he positively dashed toward a car with what for a Sadiri smacked of unnatural and unseemly haste.I followed, bemused by the teasing lilt to his formal and unnecessary farewell to Dr.Lanuri (the first leg of our rounds was only a two hour journey, after all) and wondering if I had imagined seeing an exasperated glint in Dr.Lanuris eyerather like the one I usually get when my mother starts hinting that a second son in law and more grandchildren would be nice.You know, I said to him once we had started off, Im thinking the Ministry of Family Planning would be more subtle than you were just now.Perhaps you should leave the matchmaking to them.Dllenahkh pretended to look aggrieved, but his demeanor reeked of too much satisfaction for it to be convincing.I do not understand what you mean by that statement.It is more convenient for Dr.Mar and Dr.Lanuri to go together in one vehicle so they can begin the team building process which is so important to Cygnians.Mm hm, I replied with deep sarcasm.Dr.Mar, like any urbanite, was sufficiently cultured to tune her natural enthusiasm to a volume and frequency that would be appreciated by her new colleague, which is to say they seemed to have a fair rapport at the end of the first two hours.Still, I was fairly impressed the following week when we got out at one destination a little ahead of the others and we distinctly heard singing, loud, full on opera singing, coming from the second groundcar.Of course, by the time the car stopped and the doors opened, there was only mild professional chatter between the two.I looked at Dllenahkh in shock.He merely raised his eyebrows in a way that was as good as an I told you so.How did you pull this off?I demanded when the others were out of earshot.Pull what off?he asked coolly, his tone mildly mocking the colloquialism.How did you know theyd click?That requires a level of intuition that seems to me unlikely to reside in the methodical Sadiri mind.I extrapolated from what I knew of Dr.Lanuris late wife.She was very similar in both manner and appearance to Dr.Mar.Lanuri has found itdifficult since his wifes death.I had hoped that he might find solace in Dr.Mars company and, let me admit it, perhaps even consider the possibility of marrying again.On another day that might have meant more teasing about being a matchmaker, but today I was in a grumpy mood.So even Sadiri men find women interchangeable, I scoffed under my breath.That is not what I said, he murmured, looking at me oddly.I waved my hand, trying to brush away the words.Forgive me.I was thinking of something else, something irrelevant.So the second spouse is often very close in temperament and appearance to the first spouse.Yes.The first bond is, in a way, never completely broken and constantly seeks the absent partner.Marrying someone similar assuages some of the shock and helps with the grieving process.Some people think widowed Sadiri pine away and die, I remarked, referring to a common trope in Cygnian literature and drama.That would be inappropriate, Dllenahkh said, infusing the word with a measure of distaste that was new.There are degrees of depth of bond.All Sadiri experience a bond with each other, and there are rituals that deepen the connection, the marriage ceremony being but one.However, one can be telepathically connected to one with whom it is difficult to live peaceably.The ability to know anothers mind does not preclude the likelihood of misunderstanding it.Good point, I said.Unsaid but also understood was that no Sadiri would take the selfish luxury of choosing death as a way to escape emotional pain.All were bereaved, and now life was the priority.The following weeks inspections were routine.Dr.Lanuri looked slightly less depressed, and Freyda was cheerful and professional as always.It wasnt much to go on.I caught Dllenahkh frowning to himself.Theyve only just met, I told him.Did you really expect love at first sight?Hmm, he replied.Has Dr.Mar given any indication ?He was unable to finish the sentence, but I realized what he was asking.I was aghastonly slightly aghast, really, but I played it up because there are so few times when Dllenahkh is anything but the consummate Sadiri savant.I cant believe you asked me that.Thats rude even by Cygnian standards.He frowned some more and dropped the subject.But I did find out.Not by askingIm not that inquisitivebut by alcohol, and not even my alcohol, so it really wasnt my fault.The last day of our inspections together, Freyda showed me a bottle of some fortified Cygnian vintage hidden in her knapsack.We got a groundcar to ourselves and put nav and autopilot in control.Then we got chatty.I told her my thoughts on the mission, that it was essentially a waste of time, but at least I was getting paid to travel the world for a year, and the Sadiri would have the satisfaction of knowing theyd investigated every possibility.She told me she was tired of academia and taking a sabbatical to write a book seemed a bit tame, so this way shed be out for a year and still have the sabbatical year to write, thus staying away from the university for two years instead of just one.The wine went down rather smoothly.I discovered that she did, in fact, have a fair bit of taSadiri in her background.She found out that I had just enough Ntshune in me to start people off on a giggle loop.Youve heard of someones laughter being infectious?Well, many Cygnians of Ntshune stock have the knack of giving people the giggles in a serious way, probably some unintentional emotion feedback thing.We spent the next inspection choking back snickers while the Sadiri gave us puzzled looks.The next journey was for more sober talk.She said shed been engaged, but thered been a mutual decision not to marry after her academic career took off, leaving her tied to the city and her fianc still wanting the life of a homesteader.I said Id been engaged too and also broke it off by mutual agreement, though my career was nowhere as illustrious as hers.You still have time, she said generously.At first I thought she was talking about my career, and I was flattered, but then I realized she meant time to have a family, and I felt a little less flattered.Well, what about you?Have you considered early retirement and going back to be a housewife on a homestead?She looked embarrassed.I suppose I could register my name with the Ministry of Family Planning, but I keep falling for the wrong men and getting distracted.The words were general, but there was something in the guilt that crossed her face that made me gasp and blurt out, Lanuri?For the first time, I heard bitterness in her laugh.I hope Im not that obvious!No!No, youre not.Its justwell, you do seem to get along quite well together, andhmmhow do the Sadiri show they care, anyway?She pushed back the rough bangs of her hacked off hair and scowled.Well, Im sure they dont do it by constantly mentioning how beautiful and intelligent and completely irreplaceable their late wives are!Oh, I said sadly.Yeah, Im a sad, sick person, jealous of a woman who died in the greatest genocidal attack sincewell, since Cygnus Beta was founded.And if you so much as breathe a word, she concluded sharply, and it was time to change the subject.We got back a little earlier than the other two, and rather than sit and wait outside, we persuaded Joral to let us move the farewell party into Dllenahkhs office.The rest of the place was emptyinspection tours often took us past the usual work hoursso we left the door open, put our feet up on his desk in a kind of rebellion against all Sadiri sensibilities, and set to finishing off the wine.After a short half hour had passed, we heard Jorals hushed voice through the open doorway.
