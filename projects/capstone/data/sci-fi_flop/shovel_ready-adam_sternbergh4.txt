Cop looks at me.Looks at his partner.I feed them their story.There were ten of them.They overtook you.Partner shrugs.Seems fair to me.So long as you plan to split that.I stride back through the bars front door, unloading half the magazine as a herald.Do serious damage to whats left of the liquor bottles behind the bar.Seven shots echo.No ones shooting in here but me.And Pilots gone.Fuck.I fire off three more shots.Bottles fall like fainting ladies.Run back to the apartment, cops Glock in my waistband.Well have to extend this to an all day rental.Yes, I have my own gun at home.Somewhere.Thing about guns, in this line of work, theyre not all that useful.Everyone has guns.So they kind of cancel each other out.Home.Secret knock.No answer.Unlock the door.Shoulder it open.Slow.Gun drawn.Persephone on the sofa.Her back to me.Huge headphones on her head like shes communicating with another planet.Head bobbing.Eating ice cream.She turns around.Hey you.Spoons another mound of Rocky Road in her mouth.I went down to the corner.Hope you dont mind.Licks the spoon.Whats with the pistolero, Sheriff?I lock the door behind me.Scan the apartment.Were alone, right?Of course.Whatd you think?I was going to throw a party?I put the cops gun in the drawer of a side table.Figure I can return it next time the department holds a toys for guns amnesty campaign.In other words, I just bought myself a two thousand dollar teddy bear.Pack your stuff.What stuff?Your bag.We have to go.Oh my God, why?This is heaven.This is the most comfy place I have stayed in weeks.You have a shower!A glorious, hot water We have to go.Now.She holds up her hands, palms out.Okay.Simmer down, Sarge.She stuffs the headphones and balled up laundry into her backpack.Zips up My Little Pony.Stands.Still wearing my sweatshirt dress.And Docs.I frown.We need to get you some pants.She slides the knife into her boot.Dont worry about me.Lets go.Doesnt ask why.Doesnt ask where.So she trusts me.Well thats good.Not sure if its smart.But its good.I need to stash her with someone I trust, which is a short list.Someone who can protect her, who has no love for the Church, and who I know beyond a shadow wont be tempted to creep up on her in the dark.That list is even shorter.I do know one guy who qualifies.On all counts.Mark Ray.The only trouble with Mark is that hes tapped out daily, a bed rest junkie.So first you have to find him.Then you have to wake him up.Im paranoid about Pilot, so we skip my boat.Hire a gypsy sloop to run us across the river.Driver shouts over the outboard.Destination?Canal Street.Canal Street?What for?Havent you heard?Canal Streets dead.I drop the conversation and we chop across the waves.Persephone hugs my arm, pressing tight against me.Then again, its a small boat, I tell myself.13.Canal Street.East side.What used to be called Chinatown.Once upon a time, you walked these blocks, you were wading waist deep in a river of people.The streets stank of spoiled seafood and the sidewalks were sticky with fish oil and ice melt, dumped at days end.And from sun up to lights out, these blocks would sing.Shouting, shuffling, haggling, hustling, vendors hawking knock offs, shopkeepers harassing you in Cantonese as you pass like you stole something from them and they wanted it back.Fresh carp sunbathing on wood crates of packed ice.Hot dumpling soup for a dollar.Ducks, plucked and bashful, hung on hooks in a windowpane, like a warning to other outlaw ducks.No more.Chinatown met the same fate as the city, only more so.Last generation died off.Next generation moved to Jersey.Or upstate New York.Or the Carolinas.Or anywhere but here, downwind from a dirty bomb.Turns out no matter how deep your root system, you can always pull it up.Have ducks, will travel.So Chinatown withered.Went from egg drop to pin drop.And the one last viable business in these parts moved indoors, out of sight, behind peepholes and passwords.And it caters to a clientele that is very, very quiet.They call them dorms.Quasilegal tap in flops, a hundred beds to a floor.Not the shiny kind either.Not like Lymans.These are jury rigged beds, not much more than cots and wires.Its strictly BYOFeedbag.Most people here dont care too much about food.Marks dorm of choice is a spot called Ricks Place.Run by a guy named Rick.The names a Casablanca nod, mistranslated.We head inside.Rick is fortysomething, but hes smoked himself older.Hes half Chinese and skinny as a horsewhip.Wears silver skull rings on every finger and both thumbs.His black pompadour is coaxed to an impressively rigid sheen and hes got four facial tattoos.Chinese characters.Forehead, cheek, cheek, chin.In answer to your next question, Ive never asked.He pulls on his cigarette.Cherry flares.Mr Garbageman.I havent seen you in a good long while.You decide to get back on the tap?Hello Rick.I tell you what.Ill give you two for one for you and yourgirlfriend?Daughter?Sponsor?You know what?Forget I asked.He gives Persephone a double take.I see congratulations are in order.Little litter of Spademen.Tell you what?Special today.Kids ride for free.Persephones perplexed.How did you Hey, Im Chinese.I can tell from the soles of your feet.Ricks Asian lady friend, Mina, comes stumbling out from a back room.Shes a tool head, like Rick, a technician, a gizmo, and likes to call herself Mina Machina.Long black hair and a thousand yard stare because, unlike Rick, shes also a serious tapper.Weve never really gotten along.She looks at me like shes about to say something, points at me, forgets, then half dozes off while shes busy forgetting.Spun around, she exits mumbling through a curtained doorway, stumbling off to look for something else she forgot to remember she forgot.Rick shrugs.What can I say?Soul mates.Rick, Im looking for Mark Ray.He takes another drag.Looses a lanky ghost of smoke.Sure, sure.Of course.Who isnt looking for Mark Ray?Our little angel.And Im going to guess this is the very first place you looked.The dorm is dark and drop dead quiet.A former sweatshop, now a flop shop, laid out like a battlefield hospital.Rows and rows of cots and a couple of tired looking Chinese nurses, checking pulses.A few muffled yelps escape from sleepers here and there.Hard to tell if theyre cries of pleasure or fear.Or both.Two part harmony.Rick leans over.You better let me do this.Mark is a heavy sleeper.He winds through the cots.Spots Marks crown of golden curls.Persephone watches the room, wide eyed.I whisper.I bet youve never seen anything like this back in Kansas.Im not from Kansas.I know.But still.I have.I have seen this before.Still watching the room.Doesnt look at me.This is what my fathers camp looks like.What?Paved With Gold.Then she says something else, in a croak.Half to herself.Like a joke.In my fathers house are many mansions.I whisper.Whats that?Bible verse?Nope.Sales pitch.14.Mark Ray used to be a youth pastor at a church in Minnesota.I met him a few years ago, after someone called me to offer me a job.So how does this work?I just need a name.My name?No.I dont need to know your name.So long as you wire me the money.I just need the other persons name.The one on the receiving end.And thats it?Thats it.Okay.So.The name?Mark Ray.The callers Minnesota accent hard to forget.I tracked Mark Ray down to the Reading Room at the Public Library, the big one, in Bryant Park, with the stone lions out front.Not much reading in the Reading Room anymore.They tore out the shelves and put in server racks.Swapped the tables out, brought in beds.A high end pit stop, a per hour place, mostly targeting tourists, back when there were still tourists in New York.Mark was walking among the beds, watching people dreaming.Angelic mess of curls on his head.I walked up behind him.Figure Id convince him that we should retire to someplace more private.He turned.So youve found me.That was fast.Same Minnesota accent.Impossible to miss.We sat on the front steps, watching the lions.I dont do suicides.Why not?You want to kill yourself, kill your own damn self.Thats between you and your god.Yes, I guess it is.He was sitting forward, elbows propped on his knees.Broad back.Young guy.Handsome as hell, if I can say so.Hard to see why he wouldnt want to live.He held his hands flat together, like he was about to break out in prayer.I understand why you have that rule.But my problem is, I cant do it myself.Why not?Mortal sin.You Catholic?No.Evangelical.Then I dont think you have to worry.He turned to me.Are you a religious man?No.Never?My parents dumped me at Sunday school a few times when I was young, keep me out of their hair.As for them, they tried to fight less on Sundays.Or at least keep their voices down.That was about the extent of it.I see.My father worshipped at the church of the New York Jets.Saint Namath and all that.And youve never been tempted?By religion?Yes.Thats not the kind of temptation I have to worry about.I was a pastor back in Minnesota.I used to teach a lesson on temptation.Or at least thats what I thought it was about.So whats the lesson?Do you know the story of Bathsheba?Then it happened one evening that David arose from his bed and walked on the roof of the kings house.And from the roof he saw a woman bathing, and the woman was very beautiful to behold.Mark filled me in.Back in Israel, in Bible times, Bathsheba was a woman who King David spied from his rooftop while she was bathing nude.He saw her and he was gripped with lust.Gripped with lust.Not my words.Marks.Or the Bibles.Or Gods.In any case.Gripped with lust.So David sent for her.He slept with her.And he impregnated her.Trouble is, Bathsheba was already married.To Uriah the Hittite.Who was not only one of Davids trusted friends, but also a soldier in King Davids army.But this didnt give David pause.It gave him an idea.Which he relayed to the armys commander.Set Uriah in the forefront of the hottest battle, and retreat from him, that he may be struck down and die.Mark paused the story.So Ive been teaching this passage a lot lately to my kids, my students.At first, I taught it the way that I learned it in Bible school.Not as a story of lust, or of corruption, but of temptation.You know, how God puts temptation in front of you.He allows you to feel your own weakness.To confront it.Just as Christ did here on Earth.Satan laid out the whole world to Christ, promised it to him, if only hed bend a knee to Satan.And he felt it.Christ.He was tempted.But he didnt succumb.And we feel it too.Whether its the apple in Eden.Or the desire to look back over your shoulder and watch Sodom crumble.Or spotting the most beautiful woman in Israel, bathing naked on a rooftop.Im sure you have some secret temptation.Some secret shame.I thought of a Ziploc baggie in a Sub Zero freezer, while Mark waited for an answer that wasnt coming.Okay.Well, your temptations are your own.I understand.My point is, I always thought that story was a lesson about temptation.This idea that the sin is not in the being tempted, but in giving in to the temptation.That is what God cannot abide.But I was wrong.Thats not the lesson?No.So what is it?Its a story about wrath.Its not a parable at all.No?No.Its a warning.Mark unpaused the story.So on the battlefront, Uriah was slain by archers firing a rain of arrows down from a citys high walls.And the armys commander sends word back to the king, who he assumes will be crushed at this news.Right?But King David sends this message back to the commander.Do not let this thing displease you, for the sword devours one as well as another.I interject.What were David and Bathsheba doing all this time?They were busy fucking.Pardon my language.Okay.So King Davids managed to pull off the perfect crime.No one suspects him, and even if they did, theyd say nothing.Because hes the king.He is blameless in the eyes of the world.If not in his own heart.Or in the eyes of God.And do you know what the last verse of that passage is?No.But the thing David had done displeased the Lord.Well, yeah.You would imagine.Mark pounded his palm like a pulpit.But the thing.David had done.Displeased.The Lord.That is the lesson of the story.Its not about temptation.Its about vengeance.Its about wrath.It is about God looking down, and seeing what youve done, and being displeased.Sure.And do you know what happens when the Lord is displeased with you?No.You end up in New York, outside a library, begging some stranger to put you in the ground.15.Mark.Persephone.Persephone.Mark.The three of us back on the Chinatown street corner.Mark shies from the sun, still half in the dream.Dreamy.He holds out a hand to Persephone.Pleased to meet you.Four letters tattooed across his knuckles.DAMN.When I first met Mark, farm fresh from Minnesota, he was not the type to show up with new tattoos.Then again, he also wasnt the type to tap in for a week at a time.Had never been in a bed before he came to New York.Still, I have to ask.You didnt have these last time I saw you.He flips his fingers, knuckles up.What?These?Yeah.You like them?He makes a fist.A letter on each finger.DAMN.Holds up his left hand.Makes a fist.ABLE.Holds the two fists together.DAMNABLE.I smile.Very nice.He turns his fists back toward his face, admiring them.Right?I rented Night of the Hunter, got inspired.Ive got a third one, too.Want to see?That depends where it is.He peels off his polo shirt.Still ripped despite the bed rest.Persephone perks up.Mark turns his back to us.The third tattoo in block letters.I RULE.I tell him I dont get it.He flexes his back.Shoulder blades spread like wings.The letters separate.I RULE.Nice.Very subtle.He turns around.Its more of a limn thing.If you ever tapped in, youd understand.Persephone chimes in.Well, I like it.Mark slides his shirt back on.So should we head back to my place?Persephone says she wants to grab a few supplies while were here.Points to her legs.Still pants less.I peel off two bills.Feel like Im her dad.She smiles and disappears into a store.Mark pulls his phone out and calls for a car, which seems to glide up before hes even pocketed the phone.Mark calls shotgun.I hold the rear door for the lady and her shopping bags.She arches an eyebrow.So is this a blind date youve set up for me?Not likely.You two look like brother and sister.I know, right?Kinky.You could watch.This stings.More than it should.I tell her to watch her arm while I close the door, then lean in.No offense, but youre not his type.Why not?Hes celibate.By choice.She smiles.Thats it?Thats nothing.I know plenty of lapsed celibates.That so?You bet.Even lapsed a few myself.We take the livery cab north toward Marks apartment at the former Trump Tower off Columbus Circle.Not a Brooklyn livery cab either.This is no rusted out Crown Victoria.Its a bulletproof limo, sleek as a sea lion.Dashboard Geiger counter starts clicking and the driver steers a wide arc east to avoid Times Square.On these far east avenues in Manhattan, heading uptown, you could almost believe the city is just like it was, only less so, cleared out, like how a sleepy summer Sunday used to feel.A few stray pedestrians.The random rogue yellow cab.Bright window signs promising blow out sales.But then we cut across midtown, which is a ghost town.Just trash and empty storefronts, long since looted.No more blow out sales.Just blown out.Dashboard Geiger chatters again and the driver cuts north.The lack of tourists alone leaves it spooky.No one snapping photos, wrestling maps, gawking at skyscrapers, waddling along in a cluster, clogging the sidewalk, kids trailing behind licking soft serve ice cream and wearing seven pointed Statue of Liberty crowns made of sea green foam.Now theres plenty of room on the sidewalk for everyone, if anyone was out on the sidewalk.No traffic.Streets are clear.The brighter side of car bombs, I guess.They still go off from time to time.The car bombs.Planted by copycats with lesser ambitions.Easy to pull off now that no ones paying much attention to the streets.Just another ongoing inconvenience of life in the big city.As long as youre not standing too close, I find you flinch a little less every time.In the end, half stayed, half left.Simple math.Not all who stayed hid in penthouses either.Some still run delis, wash dishes, fold laundry, mop lobbies, ride buses, drive cabs.They either moved back in to Manhattan when the last wave left or they still trundle in on broken trains from the outer boroughs.Too dumb or too poor or too hopeful to pull the plug and pack up and leave like the rest.All those diehards who refuse to let the city die.In any case.No mystery to it.Just basic subtraction.Cut a city in half and youre left with half a city.But you definitely notice the ones who are gone just as much as the ones who stayed.The driver pulls up to the building, idles out front as we head inside.Trump Tower.Former hotel and soaring glass eyesore.Named for the Donald of course.Long since dead.First thing the kids did when they pitched their camps in Central Park was lasso his statue, pull it down, put a dress on it.Last I saw it, it was still riding on the roof deck of a double decker tourist bus, forever looping the park.Marks apartments not the penthouse, but its close enough.Not sure how Mark affords it.Hes got some secret deal with some closet benefactor.Hes coy about it and I dont press.From his living room, we can see the camps in Central Park.Bonfires dotting the dusk.On the avenues, police cars park, lightbars swirling.A show of force.Marks got two drinks in his hands, one liquor, one seltzer.Liquors for me.Mark sips the seltzer.Looks like the mayors decided to finally crack down.Now?Why?I think its the Crusade.You must have heard about it.Harrow at the Garden.You ever met him?T.  K.  Harrow?Oh no.But I never really felt like we were in the same business, to be honest.We watch as the cops lay down bright orange barricades.What are they doing?Chasing them out?No.Another sip.Sealing them in.Persephone comes out of the bathroom, poured into snakeskin pants.What do you think?Nice, right?Chinatown special.Theyre Prada.So cheap!I had to roll the waistband a little to get them on.I unroll the waistband a little.I hate to tell you this.What?Theyre not Prada.Theyre Prodo.Mark agrees to let Persephone bunk for the time being.One thing you can say about Trump Tower, like most high rises, the security is not lax.Two round the clock doormen, well armed, and private plainclothes patrolling the halls.If Pilot wants in here, hell have to scale the outside of the building with a plunger in each hand.I decide to head back to Hoboken.Mark hands me a card.Give this to the driver.Hell take you.The Holland Tunnels still functional, right?I give Persephone a peck on the forehead.Marks good people.Hell take care of you.Thanks.So whos going to take care of you?Thats what Im heading back to Jersey to figure out.Truth is, I have no idea what the next step should be.Ive had jobs get out of hand, but not like this.I was hired to kill her, not adopt her.And to be honest, I would have been happy to put her on a bus, point her north, deal with the fallout with Harrow myself.But thats not an option anymore.Not if I know that Harrow has also sent someone like Pilot.Pilot definitely strikes me as a different kind of psycho.So Persephones problem is now my problem.Which means Persephone is now my problem.Though, I confess, its more than that.Sometimes when people call me, I can tell pretty soon that they dont want to hire me, they just want to chat.Blow off steam, fantasize, walk up to the edge but not over it.Before I hang up on them, they always throw out that same question.Just tell me: How can you do what you do?I dont answer, of course, but if I did, heres what Id tell them.Its not the doing it part thats hard.Its the justifying it part.And I dont do that.Im not the decision.Im just the action.Im just the bullet.So I dont need to justify it.Or live with it.Thats your job.And theres one more thing Id tell them.The world is full of bullets.Sometimes in the form of speeding buses.Or aneurysms that go pop in the night.Or rotted branches that fall in a snowstorm at the exact moment you happen to pass.Or exploding subways.Or bombs left in gym bags.All bullets.We dodge them every day, until one day we dont.So if I didnt hang up, thats what Id tell them.Thats how I do it.Im just another bullet.But not this time.Not for her.When I get to the ground floor outside Marks building I hand his limo driver the card and tell him to take me home.First, though, were making a detour.Direct him straight down Broadway and he groans.Drives as far as Fifty Third, then pulls over and says hell keep the engine running.I cant begrudge a man his fears.So I get out and walk south.Skirting the edge of Times Square.I pass a few bored cops and a few hopeful clickers, decked out in their goggles and Geiger counters, sweeping the sidewalks for junk thats not too poisonous to pocket.Truth is, everything worth scavenging got snatched up years ago.All those toxic souvenirs.I head east at Fiftieth.Follow the faint hum of gospel.It is still Sunday after all.Half wonder if Ill bump into Pilot.I figure Im headed to either the last place hell look for me, or the first.Streets dark.Like a cellblock after lights out.Not Radio City, though.Radio City is lit up like its opening night.On the marquee: The Crystal Corral Revival Hour.Rockwell was right.Crystal Corral does sound like a country singer.I head into the lobby and an usher intercepts me.Smiles and says I havent missed much.In the seats, maybe a thousand people, all huddled near the stage and singing softly.Onstage, a giant screen.On the screen, a giant preacher.T.  K.  Harrow.Head as high as a drive in movie screen.Sunday sermons broadcast on a loop.Free admission.All welcome.When Rockwell gave me his rundown, I didnt mention Id been to this place before.Made a few visits right after Times Square, back when prayer suddenly seemed like a viable option.Churches or beds.Most people sampled.Congregation sings the chorus.So Ill cherish the old rugged cross.Till my trophies at last I lay down.Harrow, in close up, expounds the Word in urgent staccato.Sounds a fire and brimstone drumbeat under the melody of the hymn.Usher taps me on the shoulder.Cant be older than twenty.Clean cut.Cheap suit.But well kept.Hello, brother.Care to join me down front?No thanks.Im just browsing.Well, whatever youre looking for, you wont find it out there.In here, though, thats a different story.I glance around.Shrug.Awfully close to Times Square.He smiles.Its true.This city has a sick heart.But that poison cant touch you in here.You sure about that?Brother, it doesnt matter, because were headed to a better place.Sure.Of course, theres just one catch.Whats that?You have to die first.He hands me a pamphlet.Not necessarily.Claps my shoulder.Our doors always open.He leaves me, drifts toward the front, rejoins the chorus.I will cling to the old rugged cross.And exchange it one day for a crown.On the pamphlets glossy cover, a photo of a rustic barn.Placid countryside.Golden sunshine.Heavenly.Arrayed over the barn, in bold letters: PAVED WITH GOLD.Under that.Bolder letters.WHY WAIT?I tap the bulletproof glass, startle the driver.He seems happy when I point him toward Hoboken.The limo glides down the west side, and for the first time in a long while, I feel a hard ache for the beds.Here in the backseat, its almost like being on bed rest: silent, safe, the low hum of movement with the city sliding by, untouchable, untouched, just lights.When I get back to my apartment I find a padded envelope taped to my apartment door.I pry it loose, rip it open.Shake it out.Aviators.Lenses cracked.Blood dotted.Interesting.I shake the envelope again.Out comes a note.Consider these an apology.Or a good faith gift.Mr Harrow regrets our misunderstanding and he would very much like to meet with you.We hope to resolve this matter in a timely and amicable fashion.Please contact me directly at the number below.The signatures from someone named Milgram.I palm the note, pocket the shades.Unlock my door.I like that phrase.Good faith.16.Were in a wheat field.Belt high stalks rustle in unison, like a congregation on their knees, whispering prayers.I reach both my hands out to let the stalk tops and wheat flowers tickle at my palms.T.  K.  Harrow walks beside me.and the most beautiful thing of it is, we can make of this what we wish.This realm is given to us as a second Eden.God made us once in His image, and now Hes provided us the tools, and the know how, to remake ourselves in His.A white clapboard church on the crest of a hill.Steeple bells welcome us.Harrow hikes toward it, a half step in front of me.See, now this here is exactly the kind of church I grew up in.Small.Cozy.Everyone knew everyone.You couldnt look left or right there wasnt someone looking back at you, quick with a smile or a steadying word.I mean, dont get me wrong.I am thankful for my many blessings.But sometimes I think of what weve built today and wonder what we lost along the way.The door is ajar.We enter.Rough hewn pews on a wide plank floor.Sunlight spun into stained glass rainbows.A vacant crucifix hangs heavy behind the pulpit.Life sized.Harrow takes a seat in the front row and motions for me to join him.Im sorry we couldnt meet in person.But this is much preferable, dont you agree?He could have self presented in any way he chose.A serpent, the angel Gabriel, or simply T.  K.  Harrow forty years ago, still robust and full of hellfire.But hes here more or less as youd find him in life, as he looked on that Radio City screen.Tall, weathered, bristly gray hair, scarecrow thin, a kindly face when it wants to be kind, but one that easily snaps back to rectitude.The only costuming flourish he allows himself is that on TV hes always in a suit.Here hes in flannels and wool.Work clothes.As for me, I look like me.A garbageman.Harrow claps me on the shoulder with a hand gnarled by age, his fingers folded up like a wounded bird.Still, his grip is strong.
