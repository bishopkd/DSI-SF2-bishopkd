"They were all mine.""And the Reds?"Krid asked."One of them is going to make it," Lang said, pointing to the bunk Sam was in."The other is gone. "Krid looked at Sam.His bandaged, sleeping body was floating quietly in a cloth bag.Krid thought it was strange how peaceful the man looked.His face seemed clear and bright.It seemed as if a weight had been taken off of his mind and he had been freed from the cares of the world around him."So it's you," Krid said quietly, recognizing the man."Then you can rest easier today.Youve made up for your crime by saving my life.""Sir," Jilken called to Krid, "We've restarted most of the computers and we might have the ship in fighting shape soon.""What files were lost in the battle?""All of the navigation files.""What about the fix on the new planet with life?"Krid asked."Its location was lost," Jilken said."Lang, don't you remember where it was?""No," Lang said, "It was way off our charts.I was going to plot it on a new map when we got back to the fleet.""Captain," called another crewman, "We are in position to enter Earth orbit with the rest of the fleet.""Good," Krid said, "Send for our instructions.We must prepare for the invasion."As Krid headed up to the cockpit, the Purple Men quickly began donning space suits, arming their weapons, and preparing to fire the cannons."Krid, this is Fleet Command," the radio crackled in the cockpit as Krid entered."Go ahead, Fleet Command," Krid answered."Enemy ships have been sighted in a lower orbit.It appears to be a group of pirate ships.Are you equipped for a space engagement?""Yes, we're ready," Krid said."I have important news for the admiral.""It'll have to wait.We're ramping up for the invasion as we speak. "***Jeff stared through the Sharks windows at white and blue marble called Earth.It was one of the most beautiful sights he had ever seen."Who are you?"his radio squawked for the third time."The Shark, reporting in for duty to protect Earth," Jeff answered."The Shark?"repeated the incredulous voice.Wes grabbed the microphone."Look you first rate imbecile," Wes growled angrily, "Did they just pull you out of preschool or something?We dont have time to deal with this garbage.""Yes, sir," the man stammered.Then he could be heard talking to someone in the background, "They're not Purple Men.""You got that right," Wes said."Tell us your position so we can meet up with you," Jeff called."You wont be able to get to us," the voice said, "Youre too late.The Purple Men are between you and us.Youll have to sit this one out.""What do you see, Cliff?"Jeff called over the intercom."Hes right," Cliff called from the lookout post on top of the Shark, "Theres about a hundred ships between us and the planet.Our ships are on the far side of the enemy fleet.""What do you think, Gavin?"Jeff asked.Gavin was standing beside him."What can we do without any weapons?"Gavin asked."We dont have any ammunition.""Im not giving up this close to Earth," Wes said."We cant just sit here.""I agree with you, Wes," Jeff said, "We can blast this baby through that fleet so fast they wont be able to stop us.""If we dump out everything in the bays before we pass through them," Denz suggested, "the loose debris will crash into the enemy fleet and cause confusion.Still, if we go through the middle of the Sixth Fleet, every ship in their navy will be able to fire at us.""Its either that, or we sit here and watch," Jeff said."Okay," Gavin said after a pause, "Lets do it.Get the men at their posts.Were runnin the gauntlet."***"What do you see?"Krid called over the intercom."The Shark is leaving," the lookout called."It looks like they are running away after all.""Smart of them," Krid said to Lang, "Maybe they will live through this day after all.I dont know if any of their fellow pirates will.""Wait," the lookout called, "Theyre turning around!"Krid spun to look at the Shark through his binoculars.The distant craft slowed and turned around, its painted teeth catching the sun.The Reds battered Pinak bore the scars of a long and hazardous journey.Sand and dust from the Wadi Kahn covered the once pristine craft.Maboks former crewmates wouldnt have recognized the ship now if they had still been alive.The Shark then swung to a stop, staring right down its nose at the Sixth Fleet."You have to respect their courage," Lang said."They wont do it," Krid said to Lang."They wont try to break through our fleet.It's suicide.""They've lived through a lot of things we would have considered suicide," Lang said.Several seconds passed as the Shark stared down at the hulking Sixth Fleet.Over a hundred ships were gathered in formation.They ranged from the tiny Pinaks up to the staggering Gallaxeons.Two rows of gun bays lined those huge battleships."Dont do it!"Krid hissed.A blast of light billowed out from behind the Shark, which leaped forward like a horse in a charge.It began to gather speed at an alarming rate and it was headed right at them."Theyre doing it," Lang murmured.Around them in the Sixth Fleet, the huge battleships began coming to life.One by one the bay doors slid open on each of the gun bays, unveiling looming guns behind them.The soldiers cranked the guns up into the doorway, their large muzzles leveled at the distantly approaching Shark.Gun after gun was loaded and readied.Krid looked around him at the countless instruments of destruction, all pointing their deadly muzzles at the tiny Shark."Bring the lookout in!"Krid shouted."Button up for combat!"The man was soon inside and they slammed the hatches shut.Still a long ways off, the Shark came on towards them, building speed at a terrifying rate."They must be burning the engines way beyond their capacity to pick up speed like that," Lang said, monitoring his instruments."If they ram a ship at that speed, it would be a goner!"Now a strange cluster of bright specks was radiating out from the Shark in all directions."They're jettisoning something," Lang called."Sound collision!"Krid yelled."Stand by to evade!"They could see the Shark with their naked eyes out of the cockpit window.Still it came on relentlessly, building more and more speed.As it charged at the colossal fleet, its engines belched out an unending fury of flame."Those engines are going to blow," Lang thought out loud."Theyll be here any second!"Krid warned."Commence fire!"came a command over the radio.Suddenly, around Krid in the blackness of space, flashes of gunfire lit Krids ship and sparkled and flashed across the hulls of all the ships near him.The flashing lights came from the numberless cannons of the Sixth fleet as they fired.Tongues of flame spat out from the sides of the towering Gallaxeons.Rivulets of fire spurted from the Sloks and Frigates.Every ship in the Sixth Fleet rocked with the horrendous concussions of the massed artillery.Krid looked to his left at the fleet behind him.He was almost blinded by countless explosions of sparkling lights from the unnumbered muzzles.Then Krids own cannon began to fire in the equipment bay.Its thunder rocked his ship.All of this was aimed at a miniscule speck of metal hurtling toward them."Watch that debris!"Krid called over the radio."They're coming in fast."***Calvin and Jose had been assigned to fling random pieces of equipment once the Shark had got up to high speed.The other men were desperately pumping handles, spinning wheels, and pulling levers to try and squeeze every last bit out of the engines.Gavin directed them with hand signals.They had to carefully steer the Shark through the cloud of Purple Man ships to safety on the other side, which would be no easy task at high speed.Calvin took up position by the half open starboard bay door.A pile of junk was lying near his feet.Jose was on the other side.As the acceleration pulled at him, Calvin could barely keep from falling toward the back wall of the bay until he anchored himself with a cable.Finally, Jeff gave the hand signal to start throwing the debris.Calvin saw him up at the front of the ship through two open doorways.Calvin snapped the tie downs with his knife and struggled to fling out the heavy boxes and stray pieces of machinery.It was very difficult to throw the heavy junk fast.Some of the smaller objects he could throw out easily.Some large wrenches were soon tumbling end over end until they fell behind the Shark and were lost from sight.Jeff gave a signal for some of the men to take cover.They left their posts and hid in prearranged places in the Shark that offered the most protection.Calvin had to keep throwing out equipment, though.In a blinding flash, the Shark suffered its first hit.Just to the left of the bay door, Calvin could see a shower of shrapnel and dust as it billowed out from the side of the ship.Then Calvin saw huge bright shapes flitting past the open door.They were enemy ships.The Shark lurched and was tossed about as they began to take more and more hits.Objects flitted by on every side.Jeff signaled again.The engines were shut off and the men in the engine room dashed for cover.Calvin threw out an empty barrel and then started toward the door controls so he could shut the bay door.A tremendous blast burst open a box just in front of him and blew him back.The floor and walls shuddered and trembled constantly as if it were an earthquake.He found himself flying toward the back wall and being pinned there by loose boxes and crates.The wall behind him was jumping and shaking."I hope this isnt the end," Calvin said to himself."And I hope Baker is okay."***Krid winced as the Shark hurtled into the midst of the Sixth Fleet at a suicidal speed.Around it, a cloud of equipment and debris whizzed by.Wrenches, bars, and boxes hurtled through the air around them.Krid saw a flying crate plow through the telescope dome of a nearby ship and carry the pieces off into the blackness before finally smashing into the nose of a Gallaxeon.Gas and shrapnel blossomed out from the point of impact.The Gallaxeon staggered back from the blow and the nose of the large craft was pushed away and swung in a slow arc.The Sharks discarded equipment was going so fast that even a small wrench could rip a hole through a Pinak from one side to the other.Still, the debris did not easily penetrate the heavy armor of the Gallaxeons.As debris smashed into ships, the explosions sent more shrapnel zipping everywhere, almost obliterating Krids view of the battle.Suddenly, a large piece of metal crashed into the window of Krids Pinak.The glass shattered in all directions in a shower of sparkling shards, throwing the men in the cockpit back.A piece of glass flipped by, barely slashing Krids cheek.The men in the cockpit quickly put on their helmets as the air rushed out.Krid inspected the damage.The metal must have come through one shattered window and out the other on the far side of the cockpit.Luckily, no one was hurt badly.Soon Krid was back at the window and saw the Shark, still plowing ahead through the hailstorm of cannon fire.Then, it was hit.Krid saw it stagger and sway from hit after hit.It still hurtled on, finally somersaulting out of the midst of the Sixth Fleet.It spun and tumbled straight towards the inviting blue planet below."That's the end," Krid mumbled.After a minute, the Shark began to right itself.Slowly it broke out of the spin and drifted silently.After a few more moments, it turned around and fired its engines to slow down.The flame from its engines seemed to sputter and cough."They must have made it after all," Lang said.He could almost see traces of a smile on Krid's lips.Soon the other pirate ships were converging on the Shark.***Calvin picked himself up from under a pile of boxes.He shook his head and looked out the open bay door of the Shark.Every second or two, the Earth flashed by the open doorway in a flash.Calvin slapped the side of his helmet to stop his head from spinning.Then he realized that the Shark itself was spinning.The centrifugal force was what threw him into the wall and held the boxes on top of him.Then he saw movement beside him as Frank climbed out of the debris.Frank clambered back to his station.Calvin climbed up footholds in the floor until he got to the airlock door.He pushed it open and it clanged against the wall.Through the ships quarters he saw Jeff, holding on to a ladder and frantically waving with his hand to get Calvins attention.Calvin alerted the men in the engine room with hand signals, and then passed along Jeffs signed instructions.After several minutes, the Shark stopped spinning and began to slow down.Now the Earth stayed still, hanging blue and silent outside the open bay door.Calvin ran forward and checked on his dog, Baker.He was safe inside an airtight bunk in the ships quarters.Before all of the men on the Shark were fully aware of what had happened, they heard a ship docking with them.Finally, the intercom crackled back to life."We made it!"Wes cheered in their headsets."Close the doors," Jeff called, "Well try to pump the air back into the Shark.""We cant pump air in yet," Calvin called, "There is a hole in the wall in the starboard equipment bay.Well just have to seal it off from the rest of the ship.""Okay," the voice replied, "Thanks, Calvin.Bring everyone in that bay up into the ships quarters and well seal it off.Lets see if everyone is okay."Calvin helped the others into the ships quarters.As they gathered, they saw the pale faces of the men who had been hit.Some were already wearing bloodied bandages as Javier worked to bind up their wounds."Well," Jeff said to the assembled men, "We made it through.It looks like everyone is here.How do they look, Javier?""I think we will all make it," Javier said, "but most of us got at least some cuts and bruises.We wont all be in fighting shape for a while.We are running short of undamaged space suits."Then a knocking came from the top hatch."Cliff," Gavin called, holding a bandage to his left side, "Let them in."Cliff soon came back with a couple of Reds from Earth.They were wearing United States military uniforms."Im Roy.Boy are we glad to see you," one of the two men said, "We thought you had been killed long ago.""We almost were," Gavin said."Several times," Wes added."How many ships do we have?"Jeff asked, "Do we have a chance?""We have fifteen ships," Roy said, "You make sixteen.Things dont look that good, but we believe we have a chance.General Monterrey thinks they will probably attack in an hour or two.Wed appreciate any help you guys could give us.""Whos General Monterrey?"Jeff asked."Hes the general who was put in charge of our space force," Roy said, "The hero of the resistance.""Hero?"Gavin asked."Yeah," Roy said."If you can send a couple of your guys with us, we can fill you in at the briefing on the flagship. "4Cliff was thinking about the dog Baker.It was having a hard time.While everybody else could hold on to something, Baker didnt have hands.He was scared and confused.Calvin ended up holding him so that he wouldnt float around trying to run in the air.It wasnt too bad because Bakers fifty pounds of weight on earth were now reduced to nothing.Cliff knew something would have to be done eventually, though.Cliff already had magnetic boots on, and he walked into the left hand bunkroom to see everyone already claiming bunks.Cliff was happy to find that the bunk he had used before was still empty.It was at the top in the back corner.He tossed his bag in and slid the panel closed.He looked at some of the others as they enjoyed themselves in free fall."You guys be careful," Cliff warned, "Motion sickness can come easily up here. "The others didnt have time to listen to this warning before Wes shot through the doorway, grabbing Cliff to stop himself."You got any bags in here?"Wes asked."Frank isnt feeling too well. "Cliff handed him some plastic bags and headed to the cockpit.Mabok had set the ships course once the ship was out of the atmosphere, and left the cockpit to show Gavin some parts of the engines that Gavin had been wondering about.Jeff had started to get everyone organized into three teams.Every eight hours, a new team would go on watch.Cliff, Gavin, and Jeff were heads of each watch.Cliff sat in the cockpit alone now.The cockpit had been a popular spot to sightsee for the first few hours, but once the Earth had receded to a small disk, everyone had left.He hadnt looked out the window at all so far, letting the others get the chance instead.Now he had it all to himself.Cliff enjoyed the solitude in the now empty cockpit and he admired the view of Earth.It seemed so beautiful as it receded into the distance.The Earth was slowly drifting out of view as the ship struggled away from the suns gravity.Finally, Cliff could no longer see the Earth.He sat back in his seat and turned around.In the wall behind him was the oval shaped hatch that led into the kitchen area.There were two hatches in fact, one in front of the other, with about four feet separation.When both hatches were closed it served as an airlock.Inside the airlock was the ladder that led up to the top hatch and also led down onto the bottom level.The top hatch opened up onto the top hull of the ship, and offered an excellent view to all sides.Cliff floated down the ladder and into the sleeping quarters.He noticed one space suit floating beside a bunk.Cliff pushed off the wall and drifted over to it.Someone was inside the bunk, so Cliff knocked on the closed panel.Calvin opened it."Hi," he said, smiling weakly."You dont look so good," Cliff said."Im feeling pretty bad actually," Calvin answered."Itll pass in a day or so," Cliff told him."Another day?"Calvin asked with despair."Yeah.Just dont move around very much.""Thats easy enough.""So will you be needing the suit?"Cliff asked."The suit?"Calvin asked, "I dont even know how to put it on.""Tell you what," Cliff said, "If you let me borrow the suit, Ill teach you how to use it later.""Deal."Cliff took the suit and helmet and floated back to the top of the ladder.He shut all the doors to the airlock.In fifteen minutes he had the suit on and slid the helmet on, clicking it into place.He checked the chest control panel to make sure the light was on that indicated that the suit was sealed completely, and then hit the controls to pump the air out of the airlock.He heard the pulsing of the pump through his helmet visor.At least this time he was sure when the airlock was working.Mabok had told them all how to operate it.A green light flashed, and Cliff got a tether from a locker on the wall, clipped it to his belt, and then attached the other end to a metal loop just under the top hatch.He turned the handle on the top hatch and it popped open.He pushed himself slowly up the ladder and poked his head out the top.The sun was on the other side of the ship, so the sky was deep black, with so many stars that Cliff couldnt believe it.He had a hard time recognizing the constellations because there were so many.Cliff detached the tether from the loop inside the hatch and reconnected it to a handhold on top of the hull.Then he closed the hatch, blocking the light from inside the ship.More and more stars came out as his eyes adjusted to the darkness.***Jeff joined Gavin and Mabok inside the engine room.He had finished assigning watches and he was satisfied that there would be someone on alert at all times who knew what they were doing.Gavin was pretty amazed at what Mabok was showing him about the engines complicated innards."Learning anything, Gavin?"Jeff asked."Yeah," Gavin answered with a smile."I have a lot better understanding of whats going on now, but Maboks not really an engineer, so he only knows the basic functions.""Good," Jeff said, "I just thought I would tell you that I was going to fix some food, but there isnt any more gruel in the kitchen.I hope we dont have to cut this trip short.""No food?"Gavin asked.He turned to Mabok and they talked in Purple Man for a little while."Dont worry," Gavin said as he turned to Jeff, "Mabok says that there are more crates of it in the crawlspace above the equipment bay.""Thanks."***"Dinner, everybody!"Jeff shouted from the kitchen.Gavin climbed out of the engine room and passed through the equipment bay.Mabok followed.They saw Wes and some others head up the ladder into the kitchen.About half the ships complement didnt follow.Gavin guessed that they didnt feel like eating.He was about to go upstairs for some soup when Cliff floated down the hall with his suit on and his helmet under his arm."Gavin," Cliff called to him just as he was about to go up the ladder, "Ask Mabok how to refill the tanks on this suit for me, will you?""Youve been outside?""Yeah," Cliff answered enthusiastically, "Its quite a view!"Gavin spoke a few words to Mabok, who motioned Cliff towards the back of the bay.He attached a hose to the bottom of Cliffs chest control panel and opened a valve.The air hissed in and started refilling the tanks on his suit."You know, Gavin," Cliff said, "I was wondering if anyone has a star chart.Im interested in finding out where were headed.""No one has one that I know of," Gavin answered."But Maboks computer has a complete star library.""I dont know how to use the computer," Cliff said."Mabok would have to help you," Gavin said as Mabok closed the oxygen valve and disconnected the hose."He tried to teach me how to use it, but without knowing how to read, I just cant get the hang of it.""Thanks anyway," Cliff said and started towards the front of the ship."Cliff," Gavin called, "Jeffs got some food cooked.""No thanks," Cliff answered, "Maybe later.I can still taste the stuff we ate last week."A panel on one of the bunks slid open and Franks head popped out."Guys," Frank moaned, "Id appreciate it if you didnt talk about the food."***A few hours later, the crew was gathered into the equipment bay."Everyone," Gavin started, "The fun and games are over.""I didnt know they had started," Frank mumbled from the back of the group.He looked kind of green."Mabok tells me that we will be out of the solar system in about 12 hours," Gavin continued, "And then we will get to our destination in several more days.""Whats our destination?"Calvin asked, holding Baker in his arms."It is a way station for a Purple Man transportation route called an Ion Course.Some kind of beam is sent between these way stations that vessels can travel along.Vessels are specially built to travel along these beams, and if the beam is interrupted, the vessel is stranded.They cant move without the beam," Gavin said, and paused to see if everyone understood."An attack force has been traveling along this Ion Course on its way to our solar system," Gavin continued, "It will arrive in a nearby star system in a week or so unless we destroy the way station, which will interrupt the beam.The fleet will then have to travel in ships like ours, which are about ten times slower than the Ion Course.This should buy us some time before the next alien attack.Then, keeping with our promise, we have to take Mabok wherever he wants and then drop him off.Then well head back to Earth and report to the government.""Hopefully we wont be put in prison," Jeff commented dryly."Anyway," Gavin continued, "We need to start training you on how to operate this ship.Mabok has been trying to teach me on the computer, but their written language is totally confusing, so well have to learn how to do everything manually.However, the Purple Man number system is simple enough," Gavin stopped talking and handed a stack of papers to Jeff, who started handing them out, "and I expect you to memorize these symbols, which represent the Purple Man numbers.Today, we will learn how to operate the life support systems, and tomorrow, the engines.We will work in three shifts, like Jeff told you earlier, and after your training shift I expect you to learn these numbers, review what you learned, and sleep.""Gavin," one of the Air Force sentries called."Yeah, Joe," Gavin answered."How are we going to destroy this way station?""Well, Joe, I guess we didnt tell you, but that large device there," Gavin pointed to a cannon, "and the one in the bay on the other side of the ship are cannons.Well have to learn how to use those too.""How far is the way station?"Cliff asked."Im not sure exactly," Gavin answered, "But I think it is around ten light years or so.Okay, if thats it, everyone on my shift stay here.The rest of you review those numbers.Well start the training right now."Two thirds of the men left the bay, leaving Gavins team behind.Cliff and Jeff still floated in a corner."Jeff," Cliff said to Jeff while Gavin started training the men, "If were going to be ten light years from home when we drop off Mabok, we should know how to get back on our own.""Thats exactly why its so important to learn how the ship works," Jeff said."Yeah, but we also need to know where to go," Cliff said."You mean navigation?""Yeah.You heard Gavin say he didnt know how to use the computer, so we need to figure out some way to navigate ourselves.""You try and solve that problem," Jeff said, "Im going to get some sleep.I was up all night.""Okay," Cliff replied, "Get some rest."***Cliff floated up into the telescope dome on the top of the ship.He had rarely come in here before because the equipment was so unfamiliar, but he figured the best way to figure out where they were going was to make some observations.It probably had markings to indicate precise directions.The dome was dark until Cliff hit the light switch and the whole chamber lit up.The telescope itself was easy to identify.The long cylindrical tube was a brilliant white, with black letters.One end extended up to the roof of the dome, and the other end pointed towards the floor.The middle of the tube was attached to a pivoting pillar in the center of the dome.Around the bottom of the dome, on the floor, were white lockers.Equipment was attached to the bottom end of the telescope, including boxes and wires and a complicated mess of machinery.Cliff turned on the power to the telescope.***"Okay, men," Gavin said as he finished answering a question, "Any more questions about how to operate the airlocks or hatches?"The men looked around at each other, but no one had a question."Okay, then," Gavin said, "Detach your intercoms from the spacesuits and split up.I want at least one person in every room, and dont clump together."The men separated and each went to a different spot on the ship.Wes looked curiously out from his bunk as Jose and Calvin came into the room and Jose pressed his intercom to his ear.Gavin turned on his intercom."Everyone on and ready for the drill?"Gavin asked.All of the men reported in.Wes could hear Gavin talking from the other room."Okay," Gavin said, "Weve got a leak in the starboard quarters!Leak in the starboard quarters!You remember how to seal it off?Get moving!"Calvin was spinning around, with both hands out as he looked from side to side."Which side is starboard?"he kept asking.Jose paid no attention and hurriedly rushed about the room, talking to himself.He was mumbling the instructions of how to seal a hatch.Calvin soon helped him and at last they had the hatches closed.Jose put his headset close to his mouth and yelled, "We got it!Its sealed off!"Wes leaned out of his bunk and overheard Gavins voice buzz from Joses headphones, "Good, Jose, but you and Calvin are sealed inside with the leak."Wes laughed."Oh, yeah," Jose mumbled.***Gavin turned when Cliff came back into the ship from outside.Cliff told him that he had spotted an object ahead.Cliff had positioned himself by the ships top hatch with some special binoculars that attached to his space suit helmet.He had become somewhat of a ships lookout.The view from the windows in the cockpit was limited, and being outside offered a wider range of view."Something bright is straight ahead," Cliff stated excitedly after he pulled his helmet off.Gavin told this to Mabok, who punched some buttons and mentioned something to Gavin."What you saw is the Jukath," Gavin translated, "He says that we should be at the station in two hours.Were turning around to begin to slow down.Jeff should have the gun crew ready by then.""Ready on the port side!"Jeff ordered.Six men took up positions around the cannon in the left hand bay.It had been a couple of hours since Cliff had first sighted the station, and he and Gavin came into the airlock to watch."Close the airlock!"Jeff ordered.Calvin was positioned by the airlock and slammed the hatch shut."Ready to depressurize!"The men closed their helmet faceplates and checked their space suits.Cliff and Gavin continued to watch from the other side of the airlock window as the men continued.Mabok turned on the suit intercoms."Pump out the air," Jeff said into his helmet mike.Calvin operated the controls and the air hissed out."Open the bay door. "Calvin jammed the lever down and the bay door slowly opened.As it slid upwards, the men got a clear view of the nearby station.Several white spheres were attached to two large dishes that pointed in opposite directions, with white cylinders extending out from either side.A nearby star lit the white structure brilliantly."Gavin," Cliff asked, "Why do we need so many guys to fire the cannon?""The computer is too complicated for us, so we have to load it manually," Gavin answered, "And the men havent learned how to do it very well yet."The gun crew gazed out the bay door at the space station."Jeff," Wes asked through his intercom, "Is there anyone on board that thing?I dont wanna hurt anybody.""No," Jeff answered, "Its unmanned, dont worry. ""Load," Jeff ordered the men.Joe and another crewman carried a cylinder up to the cannon.The men attached the cylinder to the back of the cannon and opened a valve."Charge."Two other men carried a large power cable and plugged it into the cannon near the front.One of them pulled a lever until the cannon was powered up.Then the cable was pulled out and the two men backed off."Aim."Joe was standing by the cannon.He looked through the gun sight and adjusted the aim with a hand crank until the target was centered in the crosshairs.When all was ready, the men backed away from the cannon."Fire."Joe leaned over and pulled the firing handle, then released it and stood back.After a second the cannon fired, pivoting around on its hub with a violent backlash.There was a bright flash of light.The ship shuddered from the force.Moments later the men saw particles blast outward from one of the white spheres on the distant station.Soon larger pieces of debris lazily drifted outward."Reload."The men cranked the cannon back up to the edge of the bay and brought up another cylinder of gas."Charge."They attached the cable and recharged the cannon."Aim.""Fire."Once again the cannon recoiled violently and more pieces exploded outward from the station."Let's speed it up," Jeff ordered."With pleasure," Joe replied as he helped load the cannon again."Lets move, guys!"A young kid named Javier watched through binoculars from his lookout post on top of the Pinak.He was barely out of high school when he joined the military police.His first assignment had been guarding the Pinak in South Dakota.Thats how he came to be on the ship now."Gavin," he said over his suit intercom, "I dont know how that cannon works, but it sure does its job.A couple more hits and that stations a goner. "Just as Javier finished talking, a brilliant fireball erupted from one side of the station, and it started spinning slowly."Yes," Gavin agreed, "Good work."Inside the bay, Calvin shielded his eyes from the fireball and watched as the station was shattered piece by piece."Were really cookin now!"he exclaimed happily.Frank was standing nearby with his camera, taking pictures."Fantastic!"he exclaimed as he raised the camera to his eye to compose another shot.In the cockpit, Mabok turned to Gavin slowly."Gavin," he said, "now it is time for you to fulfill your obligation.""Yeah," Gavin said, "You can set course for wherever you want to be dropped off.Well be ready to leave in an hour.""Thanks."***Cliffs shift rolled out of their bunks and started their turn."Were going to learn how to use the rear maneuvering thrusters today!"Cliff said enthusiastically after they gathered."Lets head back to the engine room."Later, when Cliff came into the kitchen, everyone else was done eating.Cliff grabbed a full soup packet out of the air.Most of his team was there."Hey, Javier," Wes called, "Give me a swordfish.""Sorry," Javier answered, "Go fish.""Alright," Wes said mischievously, "I know you have a tuna.""Nope.""Aw, come on, you gotta have it!""Go fish.""Javier," Wes said despairingly, "Because of you Im a goner.""Its not my fault!"Javier laughed."Wesley, my boy," Jose said gleefully, "Hand over the tuna.""No," Wes pleaded, "Please.""Im sorry Wesley, but you have to hand over the tuna, all three of them."Wes picked the three cards out of his hand and flicked them over to Jose."I really liked the tunas, too," Wes said mournfully.The cards tumbled across the room and Jose happily picked them out of the air.He added his one tuna to the three and patted the cards into a neat pile.He picked up one boot, put the cards on the floor, and clamped his magnetic boot down on top of them.Half of the cards poked out from under his foot and Wes could see the head of Javiers hastily drawn caricature of a tuna."Thats one set," Jose declared."You know," Wes said thoughtfully, "I could go for a tuna sandwich just now.""Dont start talking about food again!"Javier groaned."And some potato chips.Oh, man!"Wes sighed and closed his eyes."With some root beer.""Not root beer," Jose said, "How about tropical punch!""No, I want carbonation.Im tired of this flat, watery baby food stuff," Javier said."A nice cold can," Jose said dreamily."You know," Cliff said from across the room, "I think I know somebody with a lemon lime soda."Soon four faces crowded around the airlock window as Wes came back in the top hatch.He shut the hatch and then pointed to the small plastic bottle of soda as it drifted on a string around his wrist.He pumped in the air and then pulled off his helmet.The spectators scrambled out of the way, and Wes opened the airlock and stepped into the kitchen."Gentlemen," he said, "Here it is.Chilled perfectly in the darkness of space, far from the warmth of the sun.""Pass it around!""Hey, hey," Wes said, holding the others hands back, "I get the first drink.After all, I did all the work."Wes opened the bottle and stuck a straw in, covering the rest of the mouth of the bottle with his hand.He drank in a little swallow, savored it in his mouth, and took a couple more.Then the men passed the bottle around, taking care not to let any go to waste, and catching little blobs of soda pop that happened to float out of the open top of the bottle."This is living!""After this, lets have a Go Fish championship of the galaxy!""I deal!"***Frank walked proudly into the equipment bay.He was holding something in both hands with a big smile.He looked around and spotted Cliff and Fredericks."Hey Cliff!"he shouted, "Come take a look at this!"Cliff walked over."You dont want to know how hard this was to develop," he said, holding out a photograph.Cliff looked at it."Thats good, Frank!"Cliff said excitedly."You got that picture right when the station exploded.""Yeah," Frank replied smugly, "I cant wait to send these babies back to Earth."Frank left the bay to show the picture to some of the others.Fredericks was floating by some lockers.He rummaged through a duffel bag and pulled out a small stack of photos.He began looking at them silently."Can I see those, Fredericks?"Cliff asked.Fredericks flipped them towards Cliff and they tumbled end over end until Cliff caught them in the air.He leafed through them."Thats my platoon," Fredericks explained as Cliff looked at a large group of men in combat fatigues.Cliff glanced at the rest of the pictures.There were some spectacular shots of explosions and fires in the distance."So how was it in the war with the Purple Men?"Cliff asked."It was," Fredericks began, and then fell silent.Cliff looked at Fredericks thoughtful expression and waited patiently."Its hard to talk about.You see those in the picture with their heads circled?""Yeah.""Those are the ones that died. "There were all too few men in the picture that werent circled."Cliff, I lost all of my friends in two days.All the sights and sounds are still in my mind.I wouldn't wish that on anyone."Cliff and Fredericks just sat there for a while, thinking.Fredericks looked back down at his platoon.His mind went over each mans face that wasnt circled."Sometimes I think that the ones that died were the lucky ones," Fredericks said."Well, Fredericks," Cliff said finally, "We owe a lot to people like you."Fredericks stared off into the air and then looked over at Cliff and his eyes came back into focus."We cant just sit around all day," he told Cliff as he put his stuff back."We got work to do. "***Sam was suddenly startled out of his sleep by someone shaking him.In the weightlessness, he was shoved back and forth, banging into the walls of his bunk.He opened his eyes to see Frank."Wake up, Sam," Frank whispered loudly."What?""Get ready," Frank said as he fastened his belt and grabbed his headset, "Todays the big day.""Oh, yeah," Sam said, and excitedly got ready.Sam came into the kitchen and found half of the crew already there."Now, we picked half of the crew to fly manually for the first time," Gavin explained."Jeffs men will take the two front maneuvering thrusters, because they trained on those.My men will take the main engines back in the engine room, and Cliffs men will take the rear maneuvering thrusters in the engine room.Ill be giving commands from the cockpit.Any questions?"The men shook their heads.They had trained for many days for this.Sam and Frank felt like they knew their thruster like the backs of their hands.Yesterday they had bet Joe and Porty that they could fire the thruster blindfolded.Joe took on the bet, and he lost.He and Frank headed for the exercise room and stood next to their thruster, anchoring their boots on the floor and wall.Joe and Porty were by the other one across the room.The rest of the men were in the engine room, next to the rear thrusters and main engines.Gavin floated up to the cockpit and strapped into a seat.He put on his headset."Ready?"he called, "Were going to start out slow.Yaw right at one power."Sam and Frank relaxed a little as their hands flew across the controls.Yawing was easier than the other maneuvers.Their engine was set and ready to fire long before Gavin gave the command.Franks hand rested on the firing lever.Gavin paused to make sure everyone was ready, then gave the command, "Three, two, one...Now."Frank jammed the lever down just when Gavin said the word Now, and then released it.Gavin watched the stars shift slowly in the windows.Then they abruptly stopped when he said "Now" the second time."Perfect!"he called, "You stopped on a dime!"The men cheered.They were doing the impossible.Mabok smiled and congratulated Gavin.He didnt expect that they would be able to fly this well without the computer."Yeah, well," Wes grumbled, "If I had a dime for every time he said that, Id retire."Gavin floated out of his chair and relaxed.It had been long and hard to get this far.The men deserved a rest.***Cliff came out of the airlock and walked up to Jeff, who was strapped in a chair in the cockpit."Jeff," Cliff said, removing his helmet, "The star weve been approaching is close now, and I think I spotted a planet.""Good," Jeff said, "Tell everybody else that were probably going to land soon.""Right," Cliff said and quickly left.Jeff turned to his team."Lets get ready to land!Stow all the loose baggage.Lets go!"The men left through the airlock and Jeff smiled to himself."After eight days, its about time we got here!"Several hours later, the crew of the Pinak was glad to see the familiar sphere of a planet out of the windows of the cockpit.Mabok wanted to be dropped off here because the Jaka navy almost never came here.The planet itself was quite distant from its star, which appeared small and about twice as bright as the full moon on Earth.The surface below was eerily dark and brownish red.Gavin ordered Cliff to have a look with the telescope."Gavin," Cliff said as he entered the cockpit, "I couldnt see the surface at all.All I could make out were clouds.Brown, tan, white and red.Almost like Jupiter, except there arent any regular bands around the planet, just swirls and blotches.""Thanks," Gavin said, "Now let's get ready for the landing.""Everybody out of the cockpit!"Jeff ordered."Just Mabok and the team leaders.We want plenty of room to work here."The men filed out and took up positions around the ship where they could strap in.The equipment bay and the bunkrooms all had foldout seats that the crew could strap into."How are we going to land?We cant land on a gas planet. "Gavin said."It isn't just gas," Mabok answered as he studied the instrument panel, "There is a hard surface below the clouds."Then Mabok eased the throttle handles forward and punched in computer commands.It looked easier to fly by computer than to fly it manually like they had been doing.Cliff rotated his seat to face out a side window, and strapped in.The ship started shuddering."This will be very violent," Mabok said grimly."This is gonna be rough," Gavin translated to the others."Everyone strapped in?"Jeff yelled down the ladder."Yeah," came the shouted reply.Mabok turned to Jeff."Lock all the hatches between rooms," he said and Gavin translated it."Javier!"Jeff yelled back as he floated out of his chair, "Close and seal all the hatches between rooms!"Jeff floated to the airlock at the back of the cockpit and closed the hatch into the kitchen, the hatch on the floor of the airlock that went below, and then the hatch into the cockpit.Finally he strapped in.Javier and Wes floated through the ship and shut the remaining hatches before taking their places in their restraining couches again."I heard this might be bumpy," Javier said."Dont worry, buddy," Wes answered from beside him in his restraint, "If anything happens, at least you can be relieved by the fact that the worlds expert at being in a crash is right beside you.""Is that supposed to help?"Javier asked."When you are in an accident," Wes explained, "The key is to just stay relaxed until you are knocked unconscious, and then your body will loosen up automatically.If you stay loose, then youre less apt to get broken bones and stuff.""Ill try and remember that.""Dont worry about tensing up the first couple times.It takes awhile to get used to it.""Okay," Javier said weakly."The first time I rolled my Chevy, I was stiffer than a board from fright and all, but  ""Wes!"Calvin interrupted, "Quit trying to scare the guy!""I was trying to help," Wes said, sounding hurt, "I was!"***In the cockpit, Cliff watched outside the window as the ship started vibrating.The dark sky was starting to turn pale.Soon the ship was buffeting, and the whine of the engines increased in pitch.As the ride continued, the sky turned blue, then gray, then a dark, brownish gold.The ship jerked and swayed beneath them and tossed the passengers around in their straps until finally Mabok pulled some control sticks and the crew felt the ship level out.It was dismally dark and red outside.Cliff felt quite heavy, maybe almost twice as heavy as he was on Earth, but after weightlessness, he wasnt sure.Then the ship lurched violently, and was finally still.Jeff unbuckled himself."What do we do now?"he asked."We wait for someone to come," Gavin said, translating Maboks reply.
