Think again about what he told me.A fishhook.Twisted into the shape of an eight.I run a search for AMPERSAND+EIGHT+TATTOO.Still nothing.Then just AMPERSAND+EIGHT.Find a jazz combo in Queens.Then AMPERSAND+FISHHOOK.Actually, ISHHOOK.F key doesnt work.Fucking kiosks.So I type in AMPERSAND+HOOK instead.Bingo.Its a missed connection, of the type that litter the Internet.Cute girl I saw you reading on the subway kind of thing.This one says: You, burly type with a fondness for whiskey.Me: cats eye glasses, matching you drink for drink.Not sure, but I swear we had a moment at nights end out in the street waiting for a car service, in the light of the neon ampersand.If I was right, meet me tonight back at the Bait & Switch in Red Hook.You bring the bait.Ill bring the switch.Run a search on the Bait & Switch, which turns out to be a titty bar down in Red Hook, with a knock three times, private members S&M room in back.Switches, riding crops, cat o nine tails, bullwhips.Whatever your pleasure, theyve got a cabinet, and its very well stocked.And also, possibly, an outreach program.Job placements for wayward teenage girls.Service jobs.Maybe my tattooed henchman is an extremely loyal employee.Who recruits reluctant women.Ungently.Long shot, I know, but I write the address down anyway, then log off.Ball up the butlers stained white glove.Drop it down the sewer.Same place Im headed, more or less.5.Its well past dark by the time I start walking down the waterfront.Not the safest walk at this hour, and the shortest route on foot would be straight down Columbia Street.But I still cant bring myself to walk down Columbia Street.Personal reasons.So I take the scenic route, winding through Cobble Hill and Carroll Gardens, past the blocks of boarded up and blacked out brownstones.Occasional bonfire burns in a bay window.Nearly all the trees on these picturesque streets long since chopped down for salvage or firewood.Stump lined streets.If only my Stella could see this.Whats come of our old stomping grounds.My Stella.She was my wife.Thats not her real name either.Just a nickname that stuck.At least between us.I skip our old block.Give it a wide berth.Like I said, I like Brooklyn least of all.And then I finally reach the raised Brooklyn Queens Expressway, cross under, and head into whats left of Red Hook.All the wirings waterlogged, corroded and useless, so theres not a streetlamp lit in any direction.Streets are dark and the warehouses derelict, windows all broken by bored kids with good aim.In the road, oily water waits in puddles, camped out by the overstuffed sewers.Theres a dead dog smell and, sure enough, a dead dog, chained to a fence to guard an empty lot, then left on its leash to starve and fester.Flies feasting.Red Hooks version of a welcome mat.Red Hook sits low on the water, and from some parts you can see the Statue of Liberty, and supposedly the whole place used to feel like a frontier town, a refuge to escape to when the rest of Brooklyn got flooded with money.But then Red Hook got flooded with water.A few times.Waist deep sewage and six foot high watermarks staining the walls.Storm of the century came three times in a decade, so this neighborhood was in trouble even before Times Square.After Times Square, forget it.Anyone with a car and a suitcase headed for higher ground.Some people still live here.The poor with no options, packed into public housing.Hardy stubborn squatter types who dont mind living in an abandoned row house thats made up mostly of mold.Business interests that rely on an element of privacy.Since the floods, the whole neighborhood stinks like the underside of a wharf.And, like the underside of a wharf, this allows a certain kind of life to thrive.My plan is to drop in at the Bait & Switch, knock back a few drinks, and ask some questions.Maybe Ill even get lucky.Unearth my Persephone.Instead Im only halfway down Van Brunt Street when I stumble on the same pair of police cars I saw back in Brooklyn Heights, with an ambulance besides, all pulled over at the end of Coffey Street, parked by the Valentino Pier.Roof lights swirling.Turning the dead end block into a disco.On the stoops, wallflowers watch.Guess the cops werent headed to Harrows after all.Though Im not too eager to wander over, in case theyre out on some Lyman Harrowrelated APB.Then I hear a crackled command on one cops walkie talkie and realize thats not what theyre here for.Two cops shine their Maglites into the back of an abandoned van.Black van.Or blue.Black or blue.Too dark to tell.Even so, my chest clenches.Which is weird.Because what exactly am I worried about?That someone got to her first?Still, no one should go this way.Not like this.I shoulder closer through the sparse crowd of mostly bored onlookers.One cop halfheartedly tries to shoo us all back while also checking texts on his phone.Phone chirps.Incoming message.Cop smirks.Funny text.I edge to the front of the crowd.Vans back doors are flung wide open.Blankets piled up inside.Body under the blankets, if my eyes see right.Or bodies.My eyes see right.EMS guys yank the first stiff from the back.Not a girl, though.A man.Dump him on to a gurney.Arm flops over the side.Back of his hand.A tattoo.&.So much for leads.First body lays splayed out on the stretcher, bloody and neglected, and its not like TV.No one solemnly says a prayer or pulls a sheet up over his head.These EMS guys have other things to worry about, like rolling up another gurney and pulling the second body from the van.Also a man.Also mangled.Signs of serious knife work.I ask the texting cop what happened.He doesnt even look up from his phone.Who knows?Lovers spat?Some random psycho?Ask me, smells like some homo 69 gone very wrong.I wince.Play squeamish.Looks like those guys got slashed to ribbons.Cop shrugs.Sometimes passions run high.Any leads?Cop looks up finally.Human garbage lives around here?Take your pick.Im just surprised whoever did this didnt torch the van.Would have saved us a trip.Let fire worry about it.How longs that van been here?No more than a few hours, maybe.Only got called in because some thugs pried the back open, looking to loot it, and got spooked.Found more than they expected and phoned 911.Not until theyd stolen both stiffs wallets, of course.And stripped out the stereo.Phone chirps again.New text.Cop smirks again.I say thanks as I retreat back into the crowd.Dont really worry about him remembering my face.Im not that memorable.Just a garbageman.I should have remembered.Bitch cut my face.First rule of the runaway.Always carry a blade.And dont be bashful about using it.She definitely wasnt bashful.Which is when I wonder if maybe Ive been underestimating this Persephone.My Persephone.Interesting girl.And still has some claw in her yet.6.The Bait & Switch is hard to miss, since its the last place in Red Hook, housed in a small brick building at the end of Van Brunt Street, on the last block before you walk straight into the river.And turns out the butler was more right than he knew.The bars sign has a bright neon fishhook, twisted to look like an ampersand, between the words BAIT and SWITCH.Spot it six blocks away.Bar must be running a private generator to get that much wattage out here.Ampersand blazing like a flare sent up over an otherwise pitch black street.So if Persephone came this way looking for help, this is the place she would have ended up.Assuming she didnt know that this is where those men were planning to take her in the first place.Or that she came this way.Or that she needed help.I figure Sherlock and the other cops back there will probably just call it a night.Didnt seem too concerned with cracking the Case of the Man with the Ampersand Tattoo.Couple of lowlifes in a van.Not exactly top priority.And no one wants to hang out in Red Hook after dark.Then again, one of the cops might remember that tattoo, spot this neon sign, and decide to earn a paycheck for once and maybe poke around.If so, Id like a head start.Door of the Bait & Switch jingles as I head inside.Sparse weeknight crowd.A few dedicated lonelies parked at the bar.One couple fighting at a round top in the corner, hissing at each other in inside voices.Her: cats eye glasses.Him: at least six whiskeys down.Looks like they made their missed connection after all.I claim a stool.Bartender wanders over.No ampersand tattoos.Just anchors on his forearms.Like Popeye.What can I get you?Im looking for a girl.He smiles.Arent we all?She would have come in a few hours ago.Might have looked scared.Or maybe not.He unsmiles.Puts a shot glass down in front of me.Sorry, but Im not paid to notice anything here except empty glasses.Fills the shot glass up with whatevers on hand.Something amber and alcoholic.Screws the cap back on.Anchors flexing.But if youre looking for company, we do have a back room.Plenty of girls back there.Some of them scared looking.If thats what youre into.I toast him with the shot glass.No thanks.Im good.Well, why dont I leave you to your drink then?This ones on the house.Next one you can get somewhere else.Then he trundles off to tend to the other drunks, like a gardener pruning a row of wilted plants.As for me, Im more or less back at the beginning.New York is big and my Persephone could be anywhere.Needle in a haystack and thats not even her real name.So I vow to look in all the usual places, starting with the bottom of this here glass.I raise the glass.Solemnly promise.I will get to the bottom of this.Down it.I know its a clich to be a hard drinker in my profession.But its the one part I do really well.Well, this, and that other part.Its just all the stuff in between.Camps have dried up.Uncles dead, thanks to me.And she just left two bodies in a van.Quick and fearless with a blade, Ill give her that.Techniques rough, but certainly no shortage of guts.Then again, its not too hard to take down two men if youve got a decent sized knife and they dont.Just start stabbing.I motion for another round, then remember Im on the bartenders blacklist.So if Im a girl, maybe covered in blood, definitely alone in the big city, where do I head next?Tiffanys?If there was still a Tiffanys.I guess I could always peek into the bars back room.Interview a few of the dominatrices.Plural of dominatrix.That word I had to look up.But Im not really in the mood to interrogate regular people right now, let alone ones wearing full leather masks.With zippers for mouths.I need to get out of Brooklyn.But I sit a minute more and try to formulate a theory.On the run from her father, presumably.Did something bad enough that he wants her found but he doesnt want her back.If I can figure out what, that might give me a hint where shes headed.Not that Im interested in motives.Just whereabouts.But my brains an empty blackboard.There must be a school for this somewhere.Ill enroll in the morning.I finish the dregs of my drink.Pull my coat from the stool back.Needle in a haystack.Never did understand that expression.Fuck searching, just buy another needle Bells on the door jingle.Like its Christmas.Bartender calls out to a squat Hispanic, freshly entered.Hey Luis.You fuck that girl or what?Theres some amount of dumb luck involved in this undertaking, especially if, like me, you are not a gifted, trail of bread crumbs kind of guy.Dumb luck.You just have to accept it and hope it comes when you need it.Sometimes in the form of a squat Hispanic.Luis is a livery cabdriver.Livery cab being a fancy way of saying Crown Victoria in need of new shocks.Apparently they still run livery cabs across the bridges, what few souls still make that journey.Bartender leers while he wipes out a beer stein.That piece of chicken.Tell me you banged her, Luis.Luis is quiet.She had blood on her.On her clothes.I perk up.We retire to the corner.Take the two top vacated by cats eyes and the whiskey connoisseur.They left earlier.Not together.Another missed connection, I guess.Two rounds later, Luis tells me he drove this girl all the way to Central Park.Young, maybe eighteen, maybe younger.Approached him while he was outside the bar, finishing a cigarette.He says it was dark and he swears he didnt notice all the blood on her until they were halfway up the FDR.Caught the shine of it in the rearview in the sweep of a streetlamp.At that point, figured it was safer to just keep driving.Left her at the parks edge.Told her the trips on him.Did she say where she was going?Back to the camps?That theory doesnt sit right with me, but why not cross it off first.Luis shakes his head.No.Somewhere else.To Bethlehem.To Bethlehem?Thats right.Thats what she said.To Bethlehem.Buy Luis another round.Settle up with old anchor arms.Thats not what she said.She said Bethesda.But close enough.Luis is in no mood to take a second trip back into the city but he drops me off at the F and I settle in for a long slow journey on the rattling train.The park is long since dark.The angel of Bethesda watches over a barren fountain, the water finally turned off years ago.One wing stolen, the other half broken.Her face spray painted red, as in shame.A girl in a bundle at the base of the fountain.I step in.Hello Persephone.She looks up.Hooded sweatshirt, frayed denim, Doc Martens.Blond curls matted.Hands balled in pockets.Face tear damp.Voice steady.Ive had a long day, I have a knife, and Im not looking for trouble.Pocket moving.Like shes tightening a grip.I step closer.Mind on that blade.Im not here to hurt you.Which is exactly the opposite of true.7.Whatevers going to happen, its not happening here.I coax her up.She stands.Jeans cut to mid calf.Docs look like hand me downs.Technicolor laces.Like a dreamcoat.Hands balled in hoodie pockets.Still got that knife somewhere.Not sure how to make the introduction.Friend of your father doesnt seem like a promising opener.Friend of your uncle, even less so.I work with an outreach program for kids.God, I hardly half believe this even as I say it.You look like you could use a hot meal.There is no part of her that trusts me.But every part of her wants that meal.Every part of her wins.She hoists up a knapsack that maybe used to be pink.Half a rainbow decal with a little pony, peeling.Motions with her chin, hands still balled.You lead.I walk out the west side, her five paces behind me.The park is dark and dead and, on the streets, its no different.Not a soul on the sidewalk and its not even eleven.Doormen sit behind glass, watch us pass, shotguns propped on their laps like homesteaders.Cop cars sail by, sirens wailing, but we could shoot up a flare and they wont stop.Most of the restaurants on Amsterdam shut down in the past few years, once the moneyed types stopped eating out.Now theres two shuttered businesses for every one still open, big gaps in a rotting smile.But theres still a coffee counter here and there, in among the army surplus stores.Posters hawking half price gas masks and Geiger counters, with a voucher for a free donut next door.I know a place, the American Century, popular with nurses.The lively clatter of steerage.The servant class, between shifts.We take a booth.Where you from?South.How long you been here?A few weeks.I came for the camps.Howd that work out?Not so good.So whats next?I dont know.Im not coming with you though.Not an option.In any case.Though I do have a room.Dirty fingers disembowel a white dinner roll.Stuff it in like its medicine.Looks like you could use a manicure at least.Fuck you.You sleep three weeks in a park, see what it does to your cuticles.Just an observation.Youre a beautician too?I dabble.Quick smile.Despite herself.Then Ill take a mani pedi both, if youre offering.Well, that I cant promise.But I do have a clean bed.An extra bed, I mean.Wait, dont you work for some kind of shelter?For wayward teens?I thought you might be tired of sleeping in open spaces with a bunch of people you dont know.I have a guest room at my place.Door locks too.And where are you?Hoboken.Im a Jersey boy.Like Sinatra.On her second roll, eating quickly.Whos Sinatra?I dont usually do it this way, just so you know.I dont track people down and then take them out to dinner.I prefer if it works the same way on both ends of the job.The less interaction, the better.But whatever you think of me, which by now may not be much, Im not going to cut a woman open in Bethesda Fountain.Or a diner bathroom.I prefer when I find them dreaming in their beds.And yes, Im sorry to bring that up, but that is what Im here to do.Its a real conversation stopper, I know.You may say, how can you do it?Thats not a question I usually entertain.But remember what I said.I dont know these people.Im just a bullet.Rolls, soup, cheeseburger, cake.Tears through it like shes eating for two.Two bills to the waitress.Were about ready to head out.I want to ask her how old she is.Though I havent had much luck with that question today.Truth is, I realize theres a small chance shes too young.Too hard to tell anymore.Every fourteen year old a supermodel, every forty year old still trying to pass for a teen.My Little Pony backpacks used to be a reliable indicator.Same with heels and belly piercings.No more.Maybe the voice on the phone lied.And if shes not eighteen, that means I take her home, set her up with a hot shower, maybe bus fare, let her sleep eight hours for the first time in weeks.If she is eighteen, same thing, except no shower or bus fare, and shell sleep a lot longer than that.Waitress brings my change.Its silly, I know.This fixation on birthdays.But tell that to a kid with a learners permit.Or a kid signing up for the draft.And as much as Im starting to maybe hope its not the case, if she is eighteen, shes an adult.And deserves to be treated as such.So I spill it.How old are you anyway?Why?Are we going to vote?Hostel regulations.Overnight guests.Children adults.You can stay either way.Its just for bookkeeping purposes.Head counts.That kind of thing.She shifts in the booth.Like shes wondering which way to play this.Swipes back a dirty curl.Proudly age of majority.Just had my eighteenth a few weeks back.Thats partly why I headed to New York.Happy birthday.Figured it was time to blow out my candles, New Yorkstyle.Greatest city on Earth.Once upon a time.She squirms a little in the booth.I think I might take you up on that extra room after all.If the offers still open.Of course.I watch her dirty face.Ill let her have the hot shower, at least.And the door locks, you said?Of course.Well, then so should we get going?Youre not lying to me are you?She smiles.A glimmer of trust.No, Im not.Im eighteen.Freshly minted grown up.I leave a fat tip on the tabletop.Some kind of penance, I guess.She shifts again, restless.Damn, I just cant get comfortable.And its so hot in here.Are you hot?She slides out of the booth.I sit still.She stands.Empties out her hoodie pockets.Lays an underfed coin purse on the table, looking skinny.Next to that, a five inch bowie knife in a stained leather sheath.Parting gift from my father.Dont worry.I know how to use it.But I wont.I sit still.Girl alone in the big city.You understand.She slips the knife in her boot.Unzips her hoodie.Flaps it back like a cape.God, thats better.Sorry, I get these flashes.Hands on hips.Leans back.Baby bump.8.The way it happened was, it started as business software.Some kind of fancy teleconferencing gimmick.Clunky helmets, silly goggles, but once you plug in, it was pretty amazing.3D around a table.Avatars that look surprisingly like you.Pick a tie, any color.Your choice.Dreams really do come true.That was maybe ten years back.And if weve learned anything in this once proud world, its that once someone figures out how to do something as miraculous as that, its only a matter of time before someone else soups it up so you can use it to suck a horses cock.In pretend land.Or run a brothel.Or be a holy Roman emperor.In pretend land.Soon people were running around, half centaur, or space alien furry, or Kareem Abdul Jabbar, or what have you.Fucking Chewbacca.Literally fucking Chewbacca.Then they got rid of the helmets and goggles and made the whole thing about a thousand times more convincing and all you had to do was get in a bed.But beds are expensive.From basic model to deluxe silver bullet.The basic ones are just tricked out cots, but the top end are like shiny half coffins, personal escape pods, with a bunch of touch screens to guide you into the dream, sensors to put you under.Full immersive experience.As real as real.Thats the pitch.As for the specs, I cant tell you.Im not an IT type.And Ive only been in a bed a few times.Not the deluxe kind either.Anyway, they figure out that this is clearly where the money is.But the bandwidth required is huge.So they build another network, call it the limnosphere, everything shifts, and they leave the boring old Internet for the rest of us.Internet goes to seed, of course, but the rich dont care, because the rich are now lost in the limnosphere.Its like the Internet but better, much better, because its an Internet you can live inside.Or the rich can.The costs are astronomical, of course, but then again, thats why they call them the rich.After that, the math is pretty easy.Thirteen hours in first class from New York to Tokyo, or slip into a bed and hold your meeting in minutes, with you at the head of the board table, glowing like a gladiator pumped up on steroids and Cialis.Drop twenty thousand on diminishing returns at the plastic surgeon, mending the same old curtains, or spend it on a month pass to the limnosphere, sashaying down Park Avenue like Marilyn Monroes prettier sister.With a leopards tail.In pretend land.Still, it was just part of life for the first while.An addictive, maddening, seductive, destructive part of life, but part of life.They called it limning, or tapping in, or going off body, or whatever, and most people dipped in and out.For the first while.But after the second attacks and the dirty bomb?Then the rich just up and disappeared.White flight, except they didnt go anywhere.They just drew the curtains and retired to their beds full time.Hire a nurse to check your vitals, sign up for the weekly feed bags, station armed guards to watch the gates, and goodnight moon.Goodnight stars.Goodnight world.That was maybe five years ago.My point being, usually how this works is I get a name, find an address, let myself in quietly, and introduce myself politely to an old mans atrophied body in a coffin thats already half assembled.Even if the old man is only thirty.Feed bags will keep you alive, but they wont help you keep your youthful glow.Or your hair.When you start limning full time and go on permanent bed rest, you pretty much leave your body behind.So you lie there, half mummified and lightly drooling.And unfortunately for you, someone back here in the nuts and bolts world has decided they cant let that grudge slide after all.And they found my number.And I found you.Quick slit with the box cutter and its all over.Except maybe not.Not in the dream.There is a theory, unprovable I guess, that when you die, theres a last little burst of neural activity.The brains last helpless, hopeless little sigh.Normally, this would be your blown kiss to a cruel world as you exit, stage left.Yes, I did a play in high school.Mitch in Streetcar, if you must know.Would have made a better Stanley.But if youre in the limnosphere, in the dream, at that last moment, this little burst of brain activity loops.Your final seconds skip forever like a record.Even after they unplug the mummy and cart it to the furnaces.You remain as a data burp, hiccupping, some tiny line of code still in the dream.And you dont know this.Thats the theory.Youre just stuck in that last moment, an eternal right fucking now, endlessly repeating for however long the batteries of this planet hold their juice.No one knows if its true, of course, because how would you test it?They say they have programmers combing the code for these little hiccups, but most of their resources are on other things.Like developing newer, better, more tactilely realistic horse cocks.But its true enough that some people try to game it.After awhile theyre not happy enough with just the dream.They pick a program, their ultimate fantasy.Movie star.Fuck your neighbor.Crowd roar when you take the podium on Inauguration Day.Or sight the podium in your rifle scope.I dont know.That one fantasy you can never say out loud to anyone.The one moment you would happily live in forever.They time it out to the second.Hire someone to stand by.Lean in.Make sure the lids are fluttering.Clock hits zero.Put you down.Sounds weird, I know.But then again, people used to hang themselves while jerking off.Funny thing is, most people choose real life memories.Your husband turns around in the airport, back from the war, and its really him.Your miracle mother comes out of her coma.You cut class and the bedroom door swings open and your high school crush finally drops her dress.What people want is to live in that heart swell of I cant believe this is happening, over and over again.Black market agencies sell this service.Split second timing.Our watchers are the industrys best.Results guaranteed.If they fail, whos going to tattle?Youre lost in a loop somewhere, your needle bobbing on the inner edge of the record, at the far shore of a vast ocean of black.So you better hope they loop the right moment.Because if they miss, that person standing over you, watching you fall into the dream, if they miss, even by a moment, half a moment, or just a breath, then youre stuck, and your husband never turns around and you never know if he made it, or your mother stays sunk in her coma with you anchored bedside worrying, or you stare at that bedroom door forever, knob trembling, wondering whats about to come in.I choose not to believe it.Seems too convenient, and besides, if I buy that, then I might believe Im not ending someone.Im just pausing them, maybe in the happiest moment theyve ever had.That seems cheap.Its a cop out.So I think of it the other way.Most of them have already given up on this world, the nuts and bolts world.This partys over and theyve moved on to the after party.Theyve left their bodies behind.Im just sweeping up.In any case, that is what I am used to.All jobs dont go like that, obviously.But youd be surprised how much overlap there is between people with the money and desire to disappear into pretend extravagance forever, and people who want those people dead.What I am not used to is eighteen year old runaways carrying bowie knives and babies.But thats fine.Because shes pregnant.So our business here is done.I kill men.I kill women because I dont discriminate.I dont kill children because thats a different kind of psycho.And while Ill admit Ive never tested this particular scenario in practice, I think its safe to say that pregnant teenagers fall under the category of a different kind of psycho.Harrow I can handle.Sometimes circumstances change.My policy in this regard is actually pretty simple.I give back the money.What you do then is your business.As for me and the girl?Our paths uncross.In the meantime, though, what I can do is offer her that hot shower after all.And a bed.And bus fare.And maybe waffles for breakfast.Back here in the nuts and bolts world, we cant all be holy Roman emperors.But we do enjoy a waffle now and then.Like I said, I live in Hoboken.Jersey boy.Like Sinatra.I wasnt making that up.And I did play Mitch.Would have made a better Stanley.Hated learning lines though.Hated crowds.Hated acting, basically.Enjoyed kissing the girl who played Stella though.One day as a stand in.And my dad was a garbageman.An actual garbageman, I mean.So after high school I followed him into that line of work.And I married the girl who played Stella.My Stella.Better than any encore.PATH trains to Jersey shut down years ago, half the underground tunnels collapsed.No one commutes from Jersey to Manhattan anymore.So I own a boat.Just a rowboat with an outboard.Lock it up with a heavy chain at a west side pier.I give Persephone a handkerchief to tie over her mouth like an outlaw.I do likewise.This time of year, you dont want to be drinking the Hudson.Not even spray.Any time of year, for that matter.Then I yank the cord and we cross state lines.Behind us: American Century, with a CLOSED sign.Which is weird, because its 24 hours.Counterman sighs, expecting a hold up, knows the protocols, starts scooping out bills from the tray.Southern gentleman asks in a Southern accent about a young pregnant girl, possibly with a man.Counterman shrugs.Waitress is more helpful.I seen them.Thats what a big tip gets you these days.Heard something about Hoboken.Sinatra.Girl didnt even know who he was.Says it in a tone of whats this world coming to, am I right?Southern gentleman nods.Much obliged.She smiles back.Smile distended in the convex of the aviators.Clownish.Also distended: Her blood, her brains, on the back wall, like a thrown pie.Turns the long revolver on the counterman.Like a diviners rod, seeking water.Finds blood.9.The apartment is palatial, just because everyone cleared out.After Times Square, finance types were the first to evacuate.Packed up their pinstripes and skedaddled.For them, Times Square was like a roach bomb, sent them scurrying, either to full time bed rest or safer cities or both.Most even left the furniture behind.Their hasty exit, my real estate opportunity.For a few months there, after Times Square, when no one thought anyone would stay, you change the locks on a place, its basically yours.Mayor declared a tenant amnesty, a homesteaders free for all.Disputes got settled with fistfights, not leases, and the cops were otherwise occupied.It settled down eventually.Turned out there was plenty to go around.Come reelection time, the mayor clamped down.Ran on a platform of rebuilding and rebirth.Stood on a dais and declared the city shovel ready.I think he was right, but not in the way he meant.I probably could have moved to Park Avenue if Id wanted to, but it felt like the right time to retreat across the river.Always preferred this side, in any case.Even if it means you need to own a boat.And theres no more Wall Street, not in New York.Theres still the actual street, in the city, that you can walk on, but that financial part?Moved elsewhere.London, Beijing, Seoul.For awhile, they tried swapping stocks in the limnosphere, set up a virtual exchange, but there were too many distractions, too much money to be made indulging other vices.So they set up a separate network and do all that money swapping somewhere overseas.All the bankers and brokers relocated.Good riddance.And thanks for the divan.Okay, divan is a word I had to look up.A visiting lady friend said it to me once.Said she admired it.My hand me down divan.Persephone is admiring my divan.Stretched out, leaning back on it, more obviously pregnant.White wifebeater under the unzipped hoodie, revealing a sliver of belly.Id guess maybe five months.Like Im a doctor now.I give the tour.Room back there.Lock on the door, as promised.Bathrooms there.Clean towels etcetera.I sleep out here.Thanks.Hugs the guest pillow to her chest.Asks an obvious question.Why are you being so nice to me?It was a sad day when people started to ask that routinely, dont you think?She laughs.I dont really remember when they didnt.
