Youre just one of many.Youre a fucking guest.I did what I thought was necessary.To get answers.And to keep Diego out of that room.Havent you done enough?I ask.It lands just how I want it to.She practically flinches.She quickly recovers.Next time you grab me like that, you better be prepared to put me down.Noted.She scowls and then walks away.I shake my head.Were falling apart.And this is no doubt what the Cabal wantsus scattered, confused, at each others throats.Were exactly where they want us to be.Lewis finds us a short while later.Diego is with him, and some of Tamoanchans peacekeepers.Wheres Miranda?he asks me when I go to meet him.Shes working, I say.She thinks Hector may already have antibodies in his blood.To protect him from the disease.She thinks she can make a vaccine.Lewis chews on this for a moment, then nods.Good.Very good.I thought youd like that.Have you decided about evacuation?The discussion is still ongoing, he says.Then why are you here?I ask.Diego convinced me that we should get as much information as we can out of the prisoner, as quickly as we can.By any means possible?I ask.He shrugs.Well start easy.Work our way up.Mirandas going to have more questions for him.Well let her know when hes being cooperative.I dont suppose I can convince you otherwise?He smiles at me.No.I hold my hands up as if in surrender.Okay, then.Its your island.I look at Diego.You might want to talk to your sister before you do anything.Theres nothing I need to hear from her right now, he says.I shake my head but turn to go.This will work, Ben, Diego says.Youll see.I hope so, I say.As they open the door to Hectors cell, I feel a sinking sensation in my stomach.This all feels wrong.Its a bicycle messenger who tells me that Sergei died.He just tells me flat out, sent by Miranda.And thinking about Miranda makes my heart break in two because I can imagine how shes feeling.I grab a rickshaw to take me to the quarantine house.Shes standing outside, arms wrapped around herself, her face tearstained and puffy.I jump out of the seat and run to her, taking her in my arms, holding her as she sobs and shakes.Its like being shot and stabbed at the same time.Im sad about losing Sergei, I truly am, but Im even more upset by knowing what its doing to Miranda.I lost a father.I know what thats like.Miranda has lost two.I think he was peaceful, she says.In the end.I was able to give him something to help with the pain.Good, I say, stroking her hair.Thats good.She wipes her nose with a handkerchief she pulls from her pocket.I tried so hard, Ben.I tried to fix things.I just ...couldnt.I know, I say, pulling her close again.I know you did everything you could.A moment later, her hand curls up, grips my shirt.I want to kill them, she says, her voice low and throaty.I want to kill them all.I know, I say.Me, too.She sobs again, and I rub her back and wish that there was a way I could fix things.Wish that I could quiet her pain.After the sobs subside, she looks up at me through tear glazed eyes.He wanted, she says.He wanted you to have the Pasteur.Thats when my own tears come.Summoned up through the vast, numb emptiness Ive been feeling.The Pasteur is Sergeis airship.Its a modest affair, and mostly its been used for scientific research, but ...Sergei gave her to me.Sergei tried to give me my wings back.I nod to her.And smile through the tears.Then I pull her close again, and we hold on to each other, both of us crying.Both of us mourning our friend.Both of us craving vengeance.TWENTY ONE FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA I lied to get access to Hector.I know that Lewis had taken him into custody, presumably to beat information out of him, but I didnt think it would work.Call it an educated guess, but I know something about the Cabal from when I met some of their people back on Gastown.They think theyre superior to everyone else.Certainly to people like Lewis and Diego.Hector would see violence as something expected and base.What I told the Council members was that Hector still posted a threat.That we didnt know what his blood might be carrying or what else he might have stashed on the island.That was enough to get them to let me see him (and to prevent others from going in to see him).I showed up with a small kit of syringes, four of them nestled safely inside.They locked me in the room with him.Hectors face was already bruised and scabbed.He sneered at me when he saw me.I was hoping that you would be willing to talk to me, I said.Scientist to scientist.Hector barked a laugh at me.Why?I shrugged.You proved your point.And your new virus seems to be potent.What do you call it?Hector shook his head.Nice try.But Im not telling you anything.I pulled out my first syringe, took a blood sample.He didnt struggle.Didnt fight.That wont help you, he said.Maybe, I said.But I think you will.Youre deluded, he spat.I smiled at him.Then I removed my second syringe.His sneer disappeared when he saw that it already contained blood.Whats that?he asked.Blood from a specimen of ours.Alpha.He went pale.The Feral?My smile widened.Im not supposed to have this here.But I had some samples transported.For our virus test.I moved the syringe to his arm.Now, I said.You are going to give me information on this new disease you created, or else Im going to inject you with this blood.I expect the viral load is quite high.You cant, he said, his voice tinged with hysteria.Oh, I can.The needle tip slid across his skin.Because your disease killed someone very dear to me.Its too late to save him now.But I can make you pay.Wait, he said.Wait.Pleading.Lots of pleading.A small part of me enjoyed it, the power I had in my hand.Ill tell you what you want to know, he said.And he did.He told me how he and Maya were set up at the prison camp, so that they would be taken back with my people, knowing that wed be unlikely to leave them behind.He told me how the location of the prison camp was deliberately given to us so that they could use the island as a testing ground for their new disease.He confirmed that it was an autoimmune disease.Detailed its structure.How did you infect us?Even with the threat of the syringe, he couldnt stop a smile from crawling onto his face.Through the water supply, he said.We engineered it to live in water.I infected one of your wells.I went cold at that.From the Cabals perspective, it was the perfect way to attackwere on an island with limited water resources, and water is something we need.It would also be hard to trace.Was that what was in the syringe you attacked Ben with?I asked.No, he spat.That was just a poison.But there is one more vial.Redundancy.I hid it.He licked his lips.If you let me go, Ill tell you where it is.Do you really think Im going to do that?You need it.To isolate the antigen.He shrugged one shoulder.Ill give it to you.But you have to let me go.Just ...out the door.Thats it.Just give me a chance to get away.I thought about how Maya had gotten away.Out the door might be enough for him.How can I trust you?I asked.Let me take you to it.Once you see it, you let me go.There are guards outside, I told him.Figure out a way to get rid of them.I think that might be a bit beyond me, I said.Youre too important.But...I steeled myself, forcing my face to be steady.This whole time I had wanted to push the syringe into him.Press the plunger down and watch him dread what came next.Savor it.Sergei was dead.I couldnt get him back.But I could maybe help others.Thats what I kept telling myself.Thats what I had to keep telling myself.How about you tell me where the vial is, I said.And if its there, I promise you.On all that is dear to me, I promise that I will walk you out that door myself.He screwed up his face.How can I trust you?I shrugged.You might just have to take a chance, I said.But I give you my promise.I promise on Sergeis life.I will walk you out that door myself.If I find that youre telling the truth, Ill find a way to move the guards, and you can walk through that door.He searched my face, then his eyes narrowed.I could practically see him running the equations in his head.Finally, after what seemed like a very long time, he said, Okay.Then he gave me the location, a tree near the lab, a forked one.He told me the vial was buried at its base, near a large, gnarled root.I left to go look for it, telling the guards Id be back soon.And there it was, exactly where he said it was.I didnt even have to dig very far.I pulled out the tube, intact and filled with liquid.When I returned to the cell, I held the tube out to the Keepers there, one male, one female.Hector gave this up, I said.What is it?the woman asked.It contains the virus, I said.The new one.The male Keeper looked at his partner.I need you to take it to the lab.Us?the man asked.Yes.Its very important.It has to be kept safe.Take it to Lewis if you want.You take it, the woman said to her partner.Keep it safe.And whatever you do, dont break it.The male Keeper looked nervous, his young face covered with apprehension.But he took the vial.Quickly now.He ran off.As soon as he was out of sight, I moved to the door, but before going through, I took the next syringe from my pocket and pressed it into the other Keepers neck.She went down quickly with the dose of tranquilizer I gave her.When I returned to Hector, he looked hopeful.You found it?I did.And youll keep your promise?I will.I moved to him and kept his hands bound, but I untied him from the chair and walked him on stiff legs to the door.Youre making the right decision, he said.It will be better this way.I just nodded back to him.He looked down at the body of the Keeper on the ground outside the door.Then he looked back at me and smiled.I didnt think you had it in you.You dont know me very well, I said.My hands?Hector asked, holding out his bound wrists.I grabbed hold of one of his wrists and undid his bonds, seeing his smile out of the corner of my vision.I matched it with one of my own as I pulled the wrist closer and, with my other hand, depressed the fourth syringe into it.He fell back, rubbing at his hand.What was that?His voice was high and sharp.That poison you meant for Ben.He tried to pull away, to turn and run, but already his legs were growing weak and he fell to the ground, still holding his wrist.You promised.You killed my best friend.As I stood over him and watched him convulse and tremble, he looked up at me with wide eyes.Youll never make it, he gasped.Neither will you, I said.TWENTY TWO They confine Miranda to her house as punishment, but they let me in to see her, which is a relief after everything thats happened.I sit down in a nearby chair, just looking at her, not knowing what to say.Her eyes are red from crying, though because of Sergei or what had just happened or both, I dont know.Tell me what happened, I say at last.I needed to know, she says.Her voice is tight, strangled.I needed to know how to fix this thing.I nod.Okay.Did he Yes, she says.I have a sample, now.Ive sent a messenger to Clay.If things work out, we should be able to create a vaccine.Thats great, I say, trying to inject some feeling of excitement into my voice.Then you can start inoculating people?Anyone who hasnt been infected, she says.Theres something in her tonesomething self recriminating or self mocking.It wont help the dozen or so people suffering, though.I grab her hand.Dont feel bad for what happened, I say.He deserved everything he got.Look what hes done to us.She meets my eyes.I know.But I still crossed a line.Miranda, please dont beat yourself up over this.Thats just it, Ben.She lets go of my hand, stands up, and starts pacing behind her table.I dont feel bad about it.I would do it again.The words chill me a bit.I know they shouldntthat I might have done worse in her positionbut they still do.This is Miranda.Then whats the problem?She scratches a piece of the wooden desk near one corner.Did they deal with the well?she asks.Yes, I say.After figuring out which one got everyone sick, they shut it down.Which is going to put a strain on the other water sources.The island doesnt have an abundance of freshwater.And it hasnt rained for days.I just dont want any more people to get sick.Not until we can get this vaccine out.A lot of people used that well.I see her hand clench into a fist.Miranda, what is it?She shrugs.I dont know, Ben.The fact that we lost so many people.That one of them Her voice cracks, but she gets it under control.Was Sergei.The fact that I just killed the man that did it?Theres something else wrong, I say.I dont know how I knowits just a feelingbut I know.She looks up at me, surprised.Then quickly looks away.I wasnt going to tell you.Tell me what.I stand up and move toward her.Grab the hand that was picking at the table.Whats going on?She looks up at me, her face drained of emotion.She just looks tired.Beat up and tired.Then she laughs for a moment, putting her free hand up to her mouth.Sorry.Its just almost comical, all of this.Miranda...I have the disease, Ben.Enigma.I feel the blood drain from my face.Im infected, she says.The irony of the situation is that Clay gets the vaccine going around the time that Miranda starts to decline.And while shes tired and weak, she insists on continuing to study the Enigma virus.Its like shes racing it now, trying to find a cure before it kills her.Three more of the infected people died in the last daythe carpenter and two of the boffins.The rest of Mirandas people have shifted their focus fully to Enigma.I managed to convince Lewis to let Miranda work from the house, so that she can continue her research, and so that she can be more comfortable.As a result, its now covered in microscopes and papers and samples, and a steady stream of boffins and messengers are in and out of it all day.I sit on my chair, and Miranda sits propped up in her bed.Im proud of the bed.They burned what Sergei had slept on, so I bartered, rather aggressively I might add, for a mattress.Right now its coming in handy, since its where Miranda spends most of her time.She looks paler than shes ever been.Even more than when we had fallen from the Cherub into the ocean, cold water pooling in the bottom of our raft.Tired, too.Dark circles ring her eyes, which are bloodshot.Her face looks hollow.I try to get her to eat, but its hard.Weve mostly been sticking to a simple broth that she can manage to get down.Shes fighting on two fronts, really.One with her mind, trying to find a way to cure this disease, and the other with her body.One of them seems to be a losing battle.Im pinning all my hopes on the other.And yet Im just sitting here, doing nothing, and its driving me crazy.Mirandas eyes flick up to me and she smiles.Hows the book?she asks.I look down at the worn paperback in my hands.I conjure up a smile to flash back at her.Not bad, I say.Its something of a lie.What I have read is pretty decentits a thrillerbut Ive been rereading the same few pages for most of the last hour, unable to get my brain to focus on it.What the fuck am I going to do?Stay with her, the voice in my head says.Try to make her smile.Be her strength when hers falters.I nod my head.I didnt stay with my father when he Faded.I couldnt.I ran.But Im not going to run from Miranda.No more running.No more flying.This last thought would normally have stopped me cold.Chilled me.Made me want to fight or do anything to get back into the sky.But while I brace myself for that feeling, it doesnt come.For the moment, at least, Im content to be right here.On the ground.In fact, theres no place Id rather be.A lot going on in there, Miranda says, tapping her head.Theres a lot going on everywhere, Miranda.I suppose.She wraps her arms around herself and shivers.You cold?I ask.She nods, her face all weariness.I get up, move the book aside, and gently lower myself onto the bed.I take her in my arms.Is this better?I ask.Much, she says.We lay there like that for a while.Silent.Warm.Connected.After Miranda drifts off to sleep (she sleeps much more these days), I get up to stretch my legs, taking care not to disturb her.Im hot from shared body heat and the air in the small place feels close, so I go outside, inhaling the fresh air and the scent of the sea.Tamoanchan feels quiet.Dead.People stay indoors these days, fearing the disease despite Mirandas vaccine.Fearing the unknown.The next threat.Waiting for the sky to fall.I may have made up my mind to stay with Miranda, but the truth is I feel useless.It was almost better when I had Hector to worry about.He was alive.Tangible.Something in the real world that I could focus on.Put my efforts toward.This thing?I cant touch.I excuse myself during one Mirandas conferences with the other boffins and go for a walk.After wandering for a while, I end up at the rabbis place.Im about to sink onto a bench when he comes up to me and puts an arm around me.I am sorry, Ben, he says.I heard about your friend.Sergei, was it?Yes, I nod.Something heavy and thick is stuck in my throat, and my limbs feel leaden.The rabbi scrutinizes me.Ben?My breath comes fast and shallow.Its Miranda, I say.Shes sick.Oh, no, Rabbi Cohen says.Ben.I am so very sorry.Shes fighting it, of course.Because thats Miranda, but...I squeeze my hands into fists, and I feel like I want to punch something.Im scared, I say.I know, he says.Of course you are.You love her, dont you?Yes, I gasp.And of course now I can say it.When she might be taken away from me.Have you told her?he asks.I look at him.No, I say.I havent been able to.Maybe now is a good time, he says.I cant make any promisesand what happens will be what happensbut love can sometimes accomplish small miracles.Youre right.I nod to myself.Hes right.I should go.Now.I will pray for you both, the rabbi says.And, Ben.Im always here if you need me.Even if Im not.Thanks, Rabbi.I hurry back to the house, and to Miranda.Shes talking to two boffins when I walk in.She looks up at me for a moment, a small smile on her face, then returns to them.Can we have a moment?I ask.Ben, Miranda says.Were in the middle of something.Its important, I say.Okay.She looks at the boffins.Give us a minute?After they leave, I sit down on the bed next to her.I need to talk to you, Miranda.She smiles.I got that impression.I know youre dealing with a lot right now, and I dont want to add to that, but Ive been thinking.About, well, lots of things.The future.The past.Pull it together, Ben.Ive been thinking about what I want.About what I can do.I was worried that maybe I couldnt be happy on the ground.Or in one place.I know, she says.She pats my hand.This isnt going the way I thought.I just think ...things have changed.Im here now.Youre here.This can work.Ben...Hang on.I ...its just that when I picture it all in my head, or when I used to, it was just me, alone, here.But Ive come to realize that Im not alone.No, Ben, youre not.I know that now.And I also know that it makes all the difference.I think that this is what I want.Being here.Now.Im glad, Ben.My heart is hammering in my chest.My mouth is incredibly dry.Miranda I need to say something, she says, interrupting me.Because I dont know how much time we have left and, well, I need to say it.Okay...Youve probably sensed that I was a little distant.Hesitant.Yes.Well, I was having a hard time reconciling things.What things?I ask, confused.Your past.What happened with Malik.Oh.I slip my hand away.I guess I just had this image of you, who you are now, and I didnt like being reminded of who you were back then.I feel my stomach turning.But its only because ...because Im really proud of who you are now.And I like the man you are.With me.Miranda And I understand, now, having to make hard decisions.I cant judge you for those things.I wasnt there.She grabs my hand again.Im sorry, she says.Its okay, I say.I want to tell you something.I need to Im interrupted by the sound of an explosion somewhere outside.Miranda looks at me in alarm, and I shake my head.Then another explosion, followed by the sounds of gunfire.Wait here, I say.I run to the door.The two boffins are waiting outside.Looking up.In the sky, coming off the coast, is a formation of enemy airships, guns blazing.Tamoanchan is being invaded.TWENTY THREE An attack?Miranda asks.Her voice sounds high and thin.I nod wearily.They failed at quiet, so now theyre trying loud.How many?she asks.Enough, I say.She shakes her head.I think we should think about getting you out of here, I say.You want to run?No.I dont want to run.But Im not going to risk your life in this attack.Weve come too far for that.Ben, she says, her voice small, something wet in the back of her throat.She beckons me closer.I move to her, and she grabs my hands.Hers are cracked and dry, one fingernail bloody where she bit it down too far.Ben.A pause.Im no closer to cracking this thing than I was a week ago.Thats why I want to get you out of here.Give you time to do more research.She squeezes my hands.She feels so weak.I dont think I have much time left.It takes a moment for the meaning to sink in.And by her tone, I know shes being honest.Shes always straight with the science.She probably has calculated the likelihood of, well, everything.Shes run the odds, and they arent in her favor.I instinctively lean back, trying to pull away from what shes saying.I feel numb.My whole body feels numb.The woman I love just told me shes going to die soonI should be sad or I should cry or I should curl into a ball at the news, and yet I just feel ...nothing.Hollow inside.Ice.Are you sure?is what I manage to say.She nods.A tear spills from one eye.Still, the ice.Im not going to abandon my people.My work.Not now.Just to die somewhere far away.Not while people are out there risking their lives for me.I nod.So Im staying, she says.Then so am I, I say.You should really be up there, she says.Maybe not shooting at them, but ...you could fly circles around them.I want to be here, I say.With you.Besides, neither the Dumah nor the Pasteur would be any good in a fight.She shrugs.Then I guess thats good for both of us.I lie down again with my arms around her.I cant fly, and I cant fight, and its possible that some kind of bomb or gunfire will catch us here, together, as we wait to find out whats going to happen.But I can be there for Miranda.I can spend however long she has left with her.And thats what Im going to do.The screams rouse me from the light slumber I fell into.My head jerks up, and I slide out of bed, reaching for my coat, my right hand finding the handle of the revolver.Miranda looks up, her eyes glazed from sleep.Stay here, I say.I reach into one of the coats pockets and pull out the automatic I had once lent to Maya, pass it to Miranda.Keep this close.She nods.Ill be right back.Be careful, Ben, Miranda says.I open the door quietly, slipping out into the afternoon air.The wind carries the smell of smoke to me, though I have no idea of determining where its coming from.I hear another scream.Then another.A woman and a man.I run off toward the sounds.Tamoanchans streets, at least in this part of the island, are arranged into grids.I pass one intersection, then another.Then I catch sight of them.A man clutching at a bloody arm, his sleeve ragged and torn.A woman, close cut hair of grey, supporting him.They stumble toward me.I move toward them and then catch sight of something big, moving fast.Coming at all of us.What they were running from.I focus on it, and the numbness Ive been feeling wavers under a sudden flush of adrenaline through my system.Its a Feral, bounding toward us.But not any ordinary Feral.This one is large, thick with muscles that bunch and unbunch as it races across the street on all fours.I flash back suddenly to something I saw when I was moving through Gastowns helium plant.A Feralhuge and muscled like this onethat they fed prisoners to.The memory shutters, pushed down by the need for action.I draw the revolver and fire.I aim for a leg and hit, but the creature still comes on, pumping its grotesquely muscled limbs.I fire again, and the second shot takes it in the chest.The third misses.The next hits its arm.Still it comes, and its now just moments away from me.I hope the man and woman have kept moving.Somehow forcing my brain to take control, I fire again for the wounded leg.I hit it, and the beast tumbles, sliding against the ground, and I fire one more shot into its head.It stops moving.As I start to shake, the fear and adrenaline still rushing through me, I notice a few things.One, the Feral is naked.Dark hair and, now, blood are the only things on its skin.Two, it took me six shotssixto take this Feral down.Three, I realize Im hearing more screams.I get it, then.The Cabal has been breeding mutant Ferals.I know that.They are attacking Tamoanchan on two frontsin the air with their ships and on the ground with the Ferals.We are well and truly fucked.I catch sight of more people running through the streets as I quickly reload the revolver.I grab a man with tear stained cheeks and a look of horror on his face.I need you to go find a Keeper, I say.Tell them they need to organize a force to come defend this side of the island.The man nods to me, then goes running off, but Im not sure if hell actually do it.Peacekeepers, I think, shaking my head.Theres no peace to keep anymore.I run back for Mirandas place, and when I run into her room, she has the automatic pointed at me.Nice form, I say.I didnt know it was you, she says.Exactly, I say.You just keep doing that.I move to a box I stashed in the other room.Call back over my shoulder.Its bad out there, Miranda.Theyve dropped mutant Ferals on the island.Like the one I told you about back in the helium plant.What?she asks.I can barely hear her.Here?Yes, I say.I open the box that contains my spare ammunition and I load my pockets.All of themcoat, pants, the two chest pockets on my shirt.I take out another automatic and stuff that, too, into my pocket.Then I grab the shotgun thats also nestled inside, adding ammunition for the two new weapons.Mirandas eyes widen as I move back to her room.That bad?I nod.I lean in and kiss the top of her head.Stay here.Keep the gun.Im going to barricade you in.What?Luckily, the place doesnt have any windows.I dont want any Ferals getting in.If I can pile some things in front of the door, you should be safe.But then you wont be able to get in.Ill get in once this all is over.Once we beat them back.And if we cant?I meet her eyes.Then its a moot point.She nods.I grab my scarf and my hat and my glasses.I place a gloved hand on the side of Mirandas face.When I get back, well have a long talk.She raises an eyebrow.Oh, yeah?Yeah.I kiss her dry lips.Ill even tell you my middle name.She smiles.Deal.Good, I say.Now sit tight.Ill be back later.With my free hand, I drag a box outside, also a chair and whatever loose furniture I can move.I shut the door to Mirandas house and pile as much as I can against it.It wouldnt keep out a determined Feral, but they will be chasing the moving targets, the ones they can see.They have no reason to know that Mirandas inside.At least, I hope they dont.Once Im sure its reasonably secure, I move down the street.Toward the Ferals, not away.The streets of Tamoanchan are pretty simple affairs, dirt paths cleared of grass and debris, suitable for foot or rickshaw traffic.Houses or shops lining up on either side.Theyve even gone so far as to put in a few parks.Theyre mostly areas where the natural foliage has been left untouched, but unlike the rest of the world, overgrown and overcome by vegetation, here its carefully groomed.On any given day, you can hear sellers hawking their wares, people stopping to have conversations with their neighbors, even laughter.Theres that low hum of humanity that usually, for me at least, brings a sense of comfortthat heres a place where people have come together, survivors looking to build something.That hum has been replaced with cries of terror, screams, panicked noise, and the sound of weapons discharging.Above us the drone of shipsenemy and alliedthickens the air.Down here on the ground, gunshots occasionally rip through the daylight.The smell of smoke filters through the air.Im crossing an intersection when a large shape leaps toward me.I whirl and fire the shotgun at the blur of its body, and it moves away from the blast.Another of the mutated Ferals.As it turns back to me, I see this one is female, though its breasts are lost in the mass of muscle on its chest.It roars at me and lowers into a crouch.I raise the shotgun, but before I can fire, gunshots come from the side street.The Feral turns, bounds toward the shots.I see blood leaking from at least one gunshot.I run after it.If it comes into contact with whoever shot it, the Bug could spread.I fire, running, and one of my shots hits the thing, Im sure of it, but it barely slows.I see ahead of me a Keeper, rifle out, firing at the Feral.Im behind it, firing at it.Its almost on her.I stop, aim for the leg, and fire my last shell into the thing.I hit what Im aiming for, and it stumbles long enough for the Keeper to get a shot in its head.I rush forward to her.Did you get any blood on you?I search for any splatter.No, she says.It was too far away.Thank God, I say.I shot at it so many times, she says, her face full of panic.The two of us barely brought it down.I dont think they feel pain, I say.I grab her and meet her eyes.Hey, I need you to do something for me.What?I need you to find a rickshaw, and I need you to get back to the Council headquarters.See who you can find.We need more Keepers here.All of the Keepers were called to report to the eastern side, to help with the anti aircraft efforts.Thats because they dont know whats happening here.They need to know.Need to know these things are attacking.Can you do that?She looks blank for a moment.Then nods.Yes.Good.Now go find a rickshaw.And keep alert.There are more of these things.How many?she asks.Too many, I say.Now go quickly.Bring whatever help you can.What are you going to do?she asks.Whatever I can, I say.I loop back around to where Miranda is because I just want to content myself that the house is okay.Which it is.As strong as these Ferals are, I dont think they can get inside.But Im not completely sure, so at least checking gives me a small bit of peace of mind.I hope Mirandas awake and still has that automatic.Then I hear more gunfire and I head toward it.What are you doing, Ben?My hidden voice says.Youre running toward danger.But what else can I do?Three people surround one of the mutants.Two have rifles and one a pistol, and theyre unloading into it.The Feral is covering itself with its massive arms as shot after shot tears into it.And as I move closer, reloading, they move in on the Feral.It slumps forward.Then erupts into a chaotic flailing, arms swinging, legs kicking.One of the people goes flying into a nearby house, colliding with a sickening crunch.With the other hand, the Feral grabs another of the people, drawing it close, sinking teeth into the persons face.All I can see are the eyes around the scarf and hat, then everything is red.I move forward, firing with the shotgun, aiming for the creatures head.Once.Twice.Shot explodes into the things skull.At least that seems the same as a humans.Not as protected by thick muscle.It falls to the ground, missing the top part of its head.The person without a face is dead, and the one that hit the wall isnt moving.But the third person is writhing on the ground, a deep wound in her side.She looks up at me, as if to plead.And here it is, one of those moments.Because I cant do anything to save her, and she may just be infected by the Bug.These Ferals may be mutated, but theyre still Ferals.I think about shooting her, but she may survive.Hold tight, I say.Help is coming.It might be a lie.I hope its not a lie.I turn around, fish out a knife from my pocket, lay it on the ground within her reach.If things get bad, I say.Then I keep on moving.TWENTY FOUR More screams.More gunfire.To the east I see a smoke trail climb into the sky, see an airship take fire on its nose.Score at least one for Tamoanchan.When I round the corner, I see a mutant bent over a body.Its pulling out entrails, stuffing them into its mouth.It looks up at me.I level the shotgun at it, aiming for the head.Im pulling the trigger when I hear the growl behind me.Instinctively, I move to the side and my shot goes wide just as the Feral behind me tries to swing at me.Fuck me.Two of them.I unload the shotgun on the one closest to me, then, when that goes dry, I drop it and pull out my pistols.The revolver is in my right hand, the automatic in my left, and I aim one at each of them, firing one at a time.Left.Right.Left.Right.Until I realize Im wasting ammunition on poor aiming.I back away.The one that I shot with the shotgun moves to his friend and, feeling outnumbered, I run.I barrel down the street, my breath loud and fast, and Im sure both of them are behind me.I need to figure out a way to get the advantage.Especially since their legs are stronger than mine.I weave in and out of streets, cutting around houses, hoping that the quick movements will increase my lead.Im afraid to look behind me.Dont look behind yourself, you idiot.I hear a growl behind me, and I dive to the side just as the Feral pounces on where I used be.Ignoring my aching body, I pull my pistols and fire at the thing, unloading on its head with both pistols.It goes down as the pistols both click on empty.And I look up into the other ones face.This one is male.Dark skinned.Muscles bulge everywhere I can see.It moves toward me, spit dripping from its face.And I got rid of my knife.Then I hear someone say, Eat this!and I look up to see Rosie on the other side of the street, a weapon in her hands.Next to her is Diego in a rickshaw.Then a vapor trail shoots from the weapon and suddenly the Feral is exploding and I feel heat and smoke lick over me.I cover my face, and when I look again, the Ferals a burning mess of meat.Diego and Rosie come over to me and help me to my feet.I am so happy to see you.I look at Rosie.Both of you.How did you find me?Someone came looking for help.Said the crazy ship captain sent her.And you thought of me?Diego shrugs.Who else?Nice weapon you have there, I say.We brought one for you, Diego says.He hands me the long cylinder.Theyve been using them against the ships, but we thought they might be of use here.I cant use it with my arm.Ill be glad to, I say.Ben...Diego says, shaking his head.I know, I say.We just have to try.He nods.I have an idea, I say.If your arm isnt working too well, how are your legs?Great, he says.Good, then what say you give me a ride?He raises an eyebrow but doesnt say anything.Can you find another rickshaw?I ask Rosie.Probably.Good.Then try to get one and meet us at the little park on the east side.Okay, she says.And be careful.She looks at me, then at Diego.You too.I nod to her.Then I climb into the back of the rickshaw.Lets go, I say.Diego pedals off.Rosie arrives at the park a short while after us, rickshaw and all.Youre going to have to draw them out, I say.But you should be okay on the rickshaw.That way you can outpace them.But you have to be careful.Stick to the streets.Otherwise theyll have you.I know this place, Ben, she says.I know.Thats why you have to go first.She frowns.What are you going to do?Follow you.I heft the anti aircraft launcher to make my point.Her eyes widen.Something crosses over her face.Some expression I cant identify.Okay, lets go.Dont forget to ring your bell, I say.What?It will attract their attention.Rosie nods, then she takes off, pedaling up and down the streets.Diego stays close behind, but not too close.Then the first Feral sees or hears her and starts bounding after her.We catch sight of it and stay right behind.Watching the thing run behind her, I can see its all muscle.An engineered killing machine.We barrel toward an intersection, and I yell out, Left!Rosie banks to the left and I fire the launcher, which bucks against my chest.The explosive rips through the air and into the Feral, exploding it into pieces.Nice one, Diego says.Only two more shots left, I say.Lets make them count.We take off again, and Diego holds the rickshaw steady as Rosie takes the lead.This time she rings her bell more furiously, trying to attract whatever Ferals she can.Another takes the bait, and again I have her turn off as I fire at the thing.The shot is low, instead hitting the ground, but it throws the Feral up into the air and onto a nearby house.Rosie returns with her pistol to finish it off.One last shot to go.Lets head back east a bit, see if we cant draw any out.So Rosie heads that way and Diego pedals behind her and I load the last shell into my launcher.We could actually win this, I start to think.We just need to coordinate.But I see that the ships above us are larger now, closer to us.At the moment, I cant tell if theyre theirs or ours.Then Diego starts pumping his legs as another Feral tears out after Rosie.Im becoming aware of a dark shape moving above us, but I cant really take my eyes off of Rosie and the Feral.Trying to hold steady, I raise the launcher to my shoulder.And as Im lining up the shot, the world breaks apart around me.For a moment, Im not sure what happened.But Im thrown from the rickshaw and the sky tumbles above me.I lose sight of Diego and God knows where Rosie is.A moment later, I smell the fire, and the stink of some kind of explosive.Did I accidentally misfire the launcher?I think.My ears are filled with a high pitched buzz, and thats all I can hear.I call out for Diego and Rosie, but I cant even hear my own voice.I manage to push myself up and finally catch sight of Diego.Hes lying on the ground nearby, the rickshaw is turned over next to him.And the Feral appears, moving toward him.I try to call out, but how would he hear me?Im trying to get to my feet, trying to find one of my pistols, when Rosie runs into view.She doesnt appear to be armed, but she kicks the Feral in the head, a flying kick with all of her weight behind it.The thing has a heavily muscled neck, but it snaps back from the force all the same.The Feral is stunned, but it throws both arms around Rosie, pinning her arms to her sides and restraining her.Hes going to bite her, I think, and then Im running toward them, and I remember that my reloaded revolver is in the thigh holster and I pull it out and start firing into the Ferals back.It turns to this new assault, letting Rosie slip away, and as it starts moving toward me, she sweeps its leg and aims an elbow, with all her weight behind it, into the things back.It goes down, and without stopping I walk toward it, firing at its head and shoulders.Once, twice, three times until it stops moving.Rosie immediately moves to Diego, who is now stirring.I kneel beside them and reload to help cover them.What the hell was that explosion?I ask.I can barely hear my own voice.But the answer comes a moment later as I scan the town to the east.A large area, a block or two at least, is now a burning, smoking mess.A moment later, I realize what direction that is.And even though Diego and Rosie are here, I start running.Because the fire is coming from the direction of Mirandas house.I dont know what Im seeing.The place where the house is, that whole part of the street, is burning.I see the wreckage of several buildings.But I cant get close to it with the smoke and the heat of the fire.Even with my scarf, Im coughing from all the smoke.Miranda.I push my way through the fire where I can, covering my face.My skin.I get farther up the street.Just ahead is the house.Just ahead is...What used to be the house is just a mess of kindling.The ceiling is gone, the walls little more than broken sticks.Fire rages in its center, sending thick gouts of smoke into the air.Miranda!I call.Maybe she got out.Maybe shes somewhere nearby.Except you barricaded her in.Miranda!I double over, coughing, dizzy from the heat, and sink to my knees.This cant be happening.This isnt happening.A moment later, I feel hands on me, pulling me back, out of the smoke, out of the fire.Im lowered to the ground.Diego coughs above me.Rosie is next to him.What are you trying to do?he asks.Miranda, I say.Miranda was...Oh, God, Rosie says.She looks at Diego and then back at me.Theres sympathy there, but I want to tell her that its okay.This isnt happening.Miranda cant have been in there.She cant have been.Miranda!Shes gone, Ben, Diego says.He puts an arm around me.Im sorry, Ben.Shes gone.No!I say.Shes not gone.Shes just ...shes just...Shes gone.Oh my God.Shes gone.What am I going to do?What do I do?I climb to my feet.Shes gone.And I cant be here anymore.I was here because of Miranda, and shes not here.I have to go.Where are you going?Diego asks.I have to get out of here, I say.Im sorry.I have to get back up in the air.I run for the western airfield.The Dumah is there, I know.She will get me back into the air.She will take me away from...Miranda.I push thoughts of her aside.There will be time for that later.Time and alcohol and the comfort of the air.Its all I can think of right now.Getting back.Going back.There is no back.It doesnt matter.I run.Im aware that any second a Feral might find me.Might jump out of the shadows and bite my face off.Somehow that doesnt scare me as much as it used to.My body hurts and my lungs hurt as I suck in air and my eyes are blurry with tears, but I keep running.Up the hill to the airfield.Any second now, Ill see the ocean off the western side of the island.And soon Ill be flying over it, away from Ferals and raiders, and Ill be back in the air where I belong.As I crest the hill, I look down on the ocean.And my steps falter.A large shape sits on the water.A ship.A military ship.The Phoenix.Already as I look, the Dumah is in the sky, moving toward the ship.Mal is here.On Tamoanchan.He found us.Miranda.There is no back.The fight leaves me then.My battered and abused body sinks down to the ground, on my knees, and I stay that way for a while.Not praying, but almost prone.Just trying not to think anymore.Not to feel.If I could spread wings and fly away, I would.But gravity has me in its grip and I cant seem to get free.People move toward me.I ignore them.Then I hear a voice.Benjamin.I look up into Mals face.We have some unfinished business.
