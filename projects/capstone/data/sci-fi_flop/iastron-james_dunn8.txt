Okay, she said.Justus forced the hatch open and then turned to her.You have that torch?Yes.Perhaps we should use that.He switched off the coil.This makes too much noise.If theyre coming back up Id prefer to hear them before they hear us.She took out her swiss knife and handed it to him; he lifted the base of the elevator and dropped down.Anna slowly moved through the gap, followed by Ferranti.Her palms were so sweaty, she could hardly keep her grip on the thick iron bars sunk into the rocky wall.Her legs were weak, her hands unsteady.She took long, deep breaths.When she looked down, however, she realised she could only just make out Justus form below her, never mind the bottom of the shaft.The space was so wide she could not even make out the far wall.You okay?asked Ferranti from above.Anna breathed her reply, attempting to focus on maintaining her grip.She thought of her uncle, and Jon, and Glana, and Callista for that matter.The old Istron would have known what to do.For several chilling minutes they descended the passage, Ferranti continuing to encourage her and Justus silently leading the way.Eventually his voice came from below.Weve reached the bottom.Be quiet now.Anna found her feet, unsteady though they were, and once more Justus led them through hissing tunnels, dark and deep and cold; and they shivered in the wretched fear.Those foul creatures were sure to be around the next corner, or above them, or else waiting in the shadows.They soon reached what seemed to be the end of the tunnel.Justus turned and gestured to the wall, upon which hung several yellow suits.Well need those inside, he said, peering around.Put them on quickly.Anna reached up for one, but as she did Ferranti grasped her arm and pulled her back, Justus extended his weapon, and all three backed up in terror.Dont fire!Dont fire!Its me, only me!cried a shuddering old man, emerging from the dark corner behind the suits.The captains relaxed, breathing heavily, though Annas heart continued to thump in her throat.She recognised the old man immediately.Commander Naffan, she said.Whatre you ...The same as you, my ...my dear.Good to see you alive, Commander, Ferranti said.Are you alone?Were you brought down here?Yes and yes, he said, shaking blue and covered in the sweat of fear.Only me.Where is everyone?Not with us, Justus said.Th ...Those things, he said, p ...pulled us down here.When a seconds chance came I threw myself behind here and couldnt force my body to move.So they came through this way?Ferranti asked.Yeah, Justus said.Araman said thats where they were taking them.You never said wed be following them down, Ferranti said.Going exactly where theyre going.We take the risk or we stay and die for certain.Ferranti looked back to Anna.Well Im coming with you, Naffan said.Im having out!Sniffing and wiping his brow he clambered out, picked up a suit, and straightened his back.We need these?If were going to get out, Justus said, yes.Inside theres some kind of atmosphere.We just cant breathe it.All four placed the yellow suits on top of their clothes.Anna managed to get into hers, fixing her heavy helmet over her head and securing the oxygen tank over her back, before helping the shorter Naffan into his.I dont suppose theres much hope of us getting away from here, he said to her.Wherever here is.I thought after what happened on Rotavar, the horrors we saw there, that wed return home and everything would be okay.It will be.Well get out, Anna told him, and placed the helmet over his head.Youll see.Naffan smiled feebly.I hope so.Behind them both captains, already in their suits, had begun to open the hatch.They twisted the lever.A hissing sounded.They all backed away.Its okay, said Justus, laughing, it seemed, out of relief.Its only air escaping.Lord help us!said Naffan.If you do that again I will lay a clout across your back!Justus chuckled and returned to opening the hatch.Lucky for the four of them, they each had their suits and helmets firmly fixed in place, as the hatch opened and what air there was in the room was at once mixed with whatever atmosphere existed on the other side.Anna watched Justus step through, and followed to witness a scene of utter chaos.It seemed the beasts he spoke of had not used the other hatch, but instead broke through.They destroyed that hatch, Ferranti said; the others listened through the comm devices built into the suits.Yeah, Justus said.They tore the hatch apart like paper.But they must have opened this one.He bent down for a closer look.Their claw marks are all over it.What does that mean?she asked.I dont know, he said.Maybe they figured out how to open them.But not close them?Ferranti examined the inner hatch, still intact.No.No, these hatches seal themselves, if left open too long.But I agree with Justus: from one hatch to another they realised how to open it.And thats not good.Its not?No.Justus stepped through the rubble.Why?Because ...before we were dealing with beasts.Now were dealing with intelligent beasts.Oh dear, said Naffan.Never a good mix.Just look at Crilshar.We need to move, Ferranti said.Now.Justus ignited his coil and they all moved through the ruined metal.Anna remained behind the three, gazing around at the black rock walls.It all seemed so alien, so unreal.Like a nightmare.But, as though a cold wind had suddenly collided with her, she lurched over.Naffan did so too; and then Ferranti.She felt sick to her stomach, and a tear rolled down her cheek as she thought about Glana.She couldnt go on.It was over.They were dead.Justus gloved hand took hers and pulled her up.Its okay, he said.Im here.Ignore what youre feeling.Im here.Anna looked up at him; and as the torchlight entered his visor for but a fraction of a second, she glimpsed the man from her nightmares.He was pale and fearsome, and unlike anyone she had ever met.You all right?he asked her.She nodded.Good.Come on.After only a minute they descended a short ladder, and entered into a larger tunnel.Justus stopped.This is the boundary of the labyrinth.Its where my torch stopped working the last time I came here.He held up his ignited coilbolt.I doubt this will be much use in here either.Your friend told you to bring it, Ferranti reminded him.Just try it.Justus walked forwards and the coil maintained its bright red glow.That genius, he whispered.A secret, Ill bet!I dont know how he did it, but hes just given us a chance.Annas swiss knife, however, did not work, so she put it back inside the front pocket of the suit.For twenty dark minutes they stumbled on, unable to see very much, but always wary of a darker being in the overwhelming shadows around.Anna could hear nothing but her own unsteady breath, and saw nothing but the gleam of the red coil and the haunting shadows it formed, bent and twisted.The passage they had taken wound steadily uphill, and as far as they could tell they seemed to be going a constant left.Unable to fathom the courage to lead them down one of the many tunnels turning off from the main passage, Justus continued through, perhaps hoping to recognise something akin to a way outsomething new; something human.But they were met with nothing.Small gaps in the black rock formed near impossible pathways.Justus took them through anyway; although Anna thought he really had no idea where they were heading.Can we ...please ...stop?said Naffan after a while.Its so hot.Good idea, agreed Ferranti.Lets stop for a moment.It really is hot, Anna said.Is it just me or is it getting harder to breathe, even with the oxygen tanks?Its not just you.There was alarm in Ferrantis voice.He took the coil from Justus and proceeded to help Naffan as he struggled to breathe in the corner in which he had almost collapsed.Anna shuffled towards Justus and they sat at the edge of a large rock.She had not found the chance to talk to him alone yet.He had been in her dreams for so long; she had so many questions.For a minute or two they simply sat, before Anna plucked up the courage to speak.You had the dream, didnt you?He looked up.Yeah.I dreamt of you, she said.And I, you.How?I dont ...He sighed.I ran away from home, she said.I thought I was running from you, from my nightmares, from  Gilaxiad.Anna nodded.Its that word.It brought us here, called to us.We werent running away.We were running here, only we didnt know it.Justus said nothing.Whats Gilaxiad?she asked.Again he did not reply.Antal?He continued to stare ahead.Unable to see his face, she could hear his breathing quicken.Unnervingly, he whispered, Dont move, Anna.She froze.What?Why?Just dont move.Her body shook.She stood and went to turn her head.What can you see?Anna, dont move!said Ferranti.Stay still, and dont turn around.Sixty Nine      Justus stared dead ahead.They couldnt breathe the air; couldnt move without feeling disheartened; yet somehow they could still hear the sound of a distant call.A slow, lingering hiss, deadly and ominous.He knew what it was from, but no matter what he did he couldnt bring himself to move.He froze where he was.Directly behind where Anna stood, balanced upon a jutting rock face, metres high, crept one of them.Ferranti and Naffan stood, petrified.They had to run.The beast above stood still, and shifted its dark, horned head from side to side as though playing with them as a cruel and vicious predator toys with its prey.Surely it had seen them.Justus peered with bated breath as Ferranti moved slowly towards Anna, the coil humming in his hand.Anna knew something was behind her, but couldnt turn.Ferranti reached with his hand to find hers and pulled her away, ever so slowly.Where was there to run?Out of the corner of his eye Justus spotted old Naffan, who had backed up towards another tunnel.But in his haste he reversed too quickly and fell sideways into a pile of black stone, which shifted.They all heard it, and the beasts attention stirred.It seemed to perceive Naffan, before climbing down slowly and almost mechanically to their level, standing upright and rising almost eight feet in height.Skeletal and black, it moved between them.Justus gritted his teeth.He couldnt let it hurt anyone.It was his fault they were here.But he was unarmed.The demon passed by Anna and Ferranti and moved slowly towards where Naffan had fallen.Then without warning it bounded forwards, knocking Justus over and landing on top of the screaming old man.He shrieked and cried in terror, but the hiss of the creature blocked out his cries as it pulled him away.Into the dark.Ferranti seized the moment and wrenched Anna down one of the smaller openings in the rock to their left.Justus hesitantly went to follow, praying that whatever the creature was doing to Naffan he would have a quick death.There was nothing he could do for him now.The screams ended, the life suit now out of range.He turned and went to follow the others down the passage.But something was in his way.A vast shadow cut off his escape.A towering, horned wraith.It rose above him, still, silent, ravenous.The red glow of the coil faded fast.Justus froze.Light disappeared down the tunnel.He was alone.A cruel and bellowing hiss filled Justus ears and he was picked up and thrown into the air.Landing hard on jagged rock he felt beneath him and crawled for his life.No!Please no!He stretched out his arms, clinging to whatever he could, but hidden hands stole him from the ground, lifting him up and hurling him once more.He landed upon a large rock, and crawled between that and the wall, winded.He felt his way between them, crawling on his back with all the strength he could summon.A vast shade towered above.Something collided with his chest.Breath was knocked from his body.Disorientation numbed his mind.He backed up a little more, struggling to stay alive in the overwhelming darkness.Another screeching hiss filled his ears.Arms grabbed at him.He pulled himself deeper within the rock.Rage filled horns battered the black stone.In the dark he couldnt tell how close they missed him byif theyd missed him at all.In his life hed done things most men dreamed of.His crew thought he was brave.A hero.But he knew he was merely stubborn.And now stubborn is how he would die.In seconds he found his chance.The dark shadow of the horns passed by him, and Justus took hold.Deep within his crevice, he didnt let go.He wouldnt.He couldnt.The beast pulled back and he wrenched the horns within the cavity towards him.They became lodged within the gap.Hisses cried all around.The creature twisted and turned.Justus held on, pulled left and right, back and forth  Snap!The hissing stopped.A large form collapsed to the ground.Justus picked himself up and felt around.Was it dead?Where were the others?What could he do now?All was dark.All was silent, until  GILAXIAD!His stomach twisted, heart shattered.GILAXIAD!ANNA!he yelled, feeling his way along the jagged rock, then the tunnel, breaking out into a run, hurtling in the direction of the voice.But it wasnt Annas voice.It was something deeply horrifying.GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!He felt his way towards the sound, the way the others had run.He moved down a long passage.At once he could see a light at its end, dim and flickering.He ran and ran, his heart beating faster and faster.He came to the end of the tunnel.And there he saw it.* * *  Ferranti dragged Anna down the jagged tunnel so hard she thought he would tear her arm from its socket.She knew he wasnt about to let her fall back, but through the heat of the life suit and the weakness of her failing limbs, she knew she couldnt go on; they was so exhausted and the beasts were right behind.Antal!she said.Ferranti, wait!Weve left him!Keep going!he said.We can make it!But Antal!Come on!Anna looked back, unable to see a single thing, and charged headlong into Ferranti, who had stopped in front.They both collapsed to the ground, breathless and burning.Anna looked up, and in those few seconds she thought she had stopped breathing, or perhaps fallen from consciousness.Everything that had occurred, for good or for evil, had brought her to this place; and as Anna Berenguer stood in the black rock chamber into which they had charged, the enormous and terrifying, black fired and beautiful, sadly stunning, evil, and utterly unspeakable orb hovered before her, beckoning her across the abyss of space like a clear siren caught in the wind.She picked herself up and drifted forward, her heart pummelling her chest.She knew this was why she had dreamt of the black sphere; she knew it had existed, but how and for what reason she knew she was about to discover.The chamber surrounding her curved about the orb, and it was larger than she had dreamt, reaching unknown heights and depths.She came to the brink of the fissure which swelled out beneath, above, and all around the black fire.It was calling to her, and she knew what it was.GILAXIAD!she heard and the words echoed around her in a voice, dark, deep, and terrible.GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!She stretched out her hand and bowed over the gap.She had to touch it.She was meant to touch it  But a hand grasped her shoulder, pulling her backwards.Anna, no!Antal Justus cried and he hauled her back and into his arms.Anna, you mustnt!Its the orb!she said.The orb from our dreams!I know.Its calling to us!As he pulled her back Ferranti stumbled over and the two captains studied the chamber, searching in panic for another way out, pointing the coilbolt in many directions.But shrieking hisses called out, getting closer.Over there!Ferranti said.No, Justus replied.Thats the way we just entered.I cant see another way out!Anna turned back to the orb.It gave off a faint, deceiving light; rolling limbs of shadow reaching out.She looked down, and there she spotted something, half buried in a small mound of stone.Soft, glistening metal.A splintered jewel.Kneeling down she picked it up.GILAXIAD!she heard.GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!She twisted and turned in all directions.Cant you hear that?The captains did not reply.They hadnt heard it ...hadnt felt it calling.It came from the orb ...from the glistening bracelet she held in her palmthe stunning circlet of silver she had stolen from the black rock floor.Another hiss bellowed through the chamber.The bracelet was calling to her.She could feel it pulsating through her body, her mind, and her soul.She placed it over her wrist, on top of the gloved life suit.And at once she knew her mistake.The black flames leaping from the orb began to dance and flicker, jumping towards her faster and closer, licking the air around her.A strange smoke rose from her wrist and she realised the bracelet had burned through the suit, now attached to her skin.She could feel it burn.It felt good.She felt strong.Powerful.Unshakable.Then the dark flames of the orb altered, and they began to swell into a burst of bright white as though a mortal eclipse was ended; they continued to attack the far walls of the chamber and stretch around Anna like a weightless, draping blanket of light.GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!called the cavernous orb once more.The dark bracelet urged her forward.She leaned over the edge and touched the flaming sphere.The chamber disappeared and Anna looked down upon a green and blue planet; behind it the sun faded and a silver moon circled perpetually.The sun then set, leaving behind a darkened world, broken and dying in flame and death and despair ......the face of her uncle, worn and weary, looked down upon her and tears streamed down her face.He lay lifeless, pale and cold ...his image faded and Glana looked up at her, smiling; she held out in offering something small, clutched in her arms.What it was she could not see ...at once Callista materialised beside her, and reached out a hand to her, whispered, No.Anna stepped back.The dying world was gone.Anna!NO!Ferranti and Justus veered towards her but were thrown back and down to the ground.Anna shook wildly from what she had just witnessed, and found herself thrown forward too.But like a thrashing wave in the ocean she was wrenched back.Ear splitting drums rumbled through the chamber: the screams of hell and a million voices crying out in agony.Hisses and snarls rose up and around.White flame surrounded her.The captains held onto the jutting rock but Anna was unable to maintain her grip.The surge dragged her back, screaming and crying for help.Justus leapt forwards and took her hand as she fell over the edge of the fissure.His grip did not hold and she plunged, slow and silent, down into the dark.Seventy      The drums that rolled and beat paired with the pounding in Ruben Berenguers chest as his heart danced in a symphony of sporadic pulses.His soldiers marshalled before him, their coilbolts at their sides, each carrying a secure screened helmet.All would die for him today; each and every one would give their lives for the cause.And in return their faithful, legendary general was going to betray them all.The briefing had been going on for the best part of an hour.Crilshar was the most difficult planet in the entire Four Systems to assault.The star at the centre of the Second System bowed in comparison to the other three, especially in mass and power.Life existed on Crilshar only because of the fact that it was all settled below it.The many caverns, mined for centuries, offered protection from Proximas lethal solar flares, deadly radiation, and immense heat.The invasion of Crilshar was sure to be the deciding battle, and no doubt the pivotal moment, of Rubens life.And now he was sure: he would give the lives of every last legion and risk whatever war would arise as a consequence, just to see his girls safe once more.Large machines of war consumed the backdrop and a careful humming drilled through the ground, walls, and ceiling.As the drone slowed to barely a murmur everybody knew the leap had been completed.They had arrived at Crilshar.Steady yourselves!Captain Mendoza shouted.All ready at the Generals word!Ruben nodded to her, and then turned to the screen behind at the projection being transmitted from the viewing platform.There, waiting for them, the molten planet Crilshar loomed in the distance.A moment later and another screen had taken its place.The rotund, red face of Retani Iraan, the inept son of Master Gobisla, appeared; it did not bare its usual joyous smirk, but a much graver and without doubt more fearful expression.The fear, however, did not stop the corpulent man from tucking into a seven course selection of artery clogging fodder.Alongside the image sprang another.Chief Vasily stood, flanked by half a dozen Rotavarian warriors.He had agreed to remain with his vessel, the Maelstrom, and aid in the orbital strike.Regarding the General with a sturdy nod he brought a fist to his breast in salute.The General reciprocated; Vasily had been loyal ever since hed first met him on Rotavar, and he could not have been more indebted.A third picture then appeared above the other two and the thin figure of an elderly, bespectacled gentleman smiled weakly back.Von Viticus, Ruben said.Good to see you.Viticus raised his chin and his wrinkled features relaxed into a brave grin.He moved his dry lips as though chewing and blinked many times as one with an ocular condition.So, Ruben said, this is it.The Four Systems of Humanity have chosen four allies to oppose the mightiest threat.I know each and every one of you will have read, re read, and thoroughly retained the preliminary outline of attack.But of those for whom this design remains uncertain, I will say this: we attack, not to preserve Crilshan, or indeed Proximan, culture and society, but to remove the principles by which the Dishan and their forces rule without sympathy, without clemency, and without humanity.Lives will be lost.Damage taken.But within our shells of strength and metal we will descend through every last level of Crilshar, until we control the world itself!Every single soldier and every last captain, all ambassadors and politicians, leaders, and other worlders hung on to his words.We confront a dark and powerful enemy.But together victory is ours.It was done fifty years ago.It will be done today!Von Viticus spoke first.Earth is with you.Retani Iraan put down his chicken leg.The Wetanis are by your side.And Rotavar is behind you all the way, said Vasily.This is where we decide what is truly important to us.This is where we make our choice, where we take our stand, and initiate the fall of the Dishan.NOW!The screens remained linked, but the many Guards hastened to their positions.Dozens of tube shaped pods lined the bay, ready to be ejected into the atmosphere.Long, heavy, and streamline they were the perfect devices for a quick and effective planetary assault.Some contained two Guards; others held fifty and more.Ruben watched the pods begin to fill, before turning to Mendoza.When we get down there, he said, stick by me.Ill give the signal  And then we begin, she said, and licked her lips.Her mouth moved as though there was something else she wished to say.This could well be it for all of them, he knew.Mendoza knew it too.She turned her back and marched to the pod.The General placed his helmet over his head and climbed into the two man pod with her.The screen dropped into place above them.I would normally say hold your stomach  But we both know youre not going to, she said.The General considered a reply, and he knew he ought to tell her how he felt, but before he could vocalise anything an unsettling countdown began on the console before him.Thirty seconds lasted so much longer than thirty seconds should.Then it came.3 ...He took a deep breath.2 ...The pod began to shake.1 ...Here we go.0 ...A shrill whooshing filled the small space as it strained under the rapid change in pressure.Lifting the shells visor Ruben watched, eyes watering, as they left the Quasar, surrounded by dozens of other glistening pods, and the black planet approached.The descent to war began.Several grunts from behind meant he didnt need to worry about whether or not Mendoza was still conscious.The planets glowing molten surface, trapped in perpetual night, quickly came into view.The world experienced tidal locking in relation to Proxima, generating enormous amounts of friction and heat.The only thing saving Crilshar from the resulting torrid flares was its strong magnetic field.Ruben shook himself from a trance, brought on by the great strain.From below something emerged.A glint of metal struck the Generals eye.What on Titan?What?Mendoza said.What do you see?Another flash appeared, followed by several more.In the time it took for Ruben to blink, hundreds of glistening objects were racing towards them.And the answer was simple.Missiles!he said.Theyre ready for us!Perfect, he heard from behind.Quasar, Ruben said into his comm, this is General Berenguer.Be advised, enemy projectiles are currently on course for dispatched Attack Force Actha!We read you sir.Standby.The growing missiles were approaching fast.Too fast.Hundreds of them.The moment had come  Bright beams of light shot past the pod; colossal waves of burning white clashed with the approaching projectiles and burned scores of them to dust.Some careened through, and several unprotected pods disappeared in the blink of an eye.Titan be with you, my brave Guards!* * *  By now the fighting swelled furiously across the skies of Crilshar; and the shudder of great debris shook the crafts of Rotavar as they struggled alongside Earths war vessels.No longer at any safe distance, Aleksey Vasily looked out from the Maelstrom at the battle unfolding before him.Through a porthole he watched several Crilshan barrages appear from above, barbed and breathtaking, and they moved as though falling, collapsing, hurtling towards the allies.A cheer rose up as three Titanese carriers floated in formation, and they drove against the legions of Crilshar.Many of each side, Titanese and Crilshan, drifted towards each other and all deployed their assaults.Brilliant bursts of pure white and all consuming scarlet burned Vasilys retinas.It was several minutes before his vision reappeared, and many more before it became clear which side had inflicted more damage.Cheering at last broke out as the first wave of Crilshan barrages faltered.We have a problem, Chief!cried one of the errand pilots as he came charging from the viewing centre.What is it?Vasily asked.The errand pilot handed him a small screen data message.Proximan reinforcements were approaching.Victory was uncertain.He looked out the porthole.Far from the line of fire, Retani Iraan would not stray into the battle, nor would he commit his vessel to aid those now engaged.Vasily swore a dozen insults as he moved from window to window, gazing at the spiked barrages, helpless to aid the allies down below, and trapped onboard his own ship, incapable of doing sufficient enough damage to turn the battle.He sighed in despair at his position and wished the choices hed made were very different from reality.Retani Iraan had sent down his ground forces, but had yet to commit to the orbital assault.The Titanese went unaided, fighting back the Proximan offensive; the Golden Army had no chance against the combined strength of the entire Dishan Alliance.Not without the Retanis.Why arent you fighting?Vasily attempted to reach the Retani control ship via audio comm link, but it was no use.There was no reply.Outside, the battle expanded, and the Maelstrom shook as it was pulled into the centre of a Proximan raid.Have the captain informed he is in total command, Vasily said to the errand pilot.He couldnt go along with this.He had to help General Berenguer.But Chief, he replied.Where are you going, sir?Vasily summoned all of his poise and breathed out.To the Retani Control Ship.If they were not going to fight, he would, at the very least, discover why.* * *  Rockets rose from below.Pods plummeted, manoeuvring around and directly through deadly fields of fire.Molten breaches in the planet surface ran miles deep, though the foray of pods kept close to the outer defencestoo deep and they would spread themselves overly thin.As the enormous beams of burning light, generated by the orbiting battle cruisers, penetrated the surfacing shell of Crilshar, the many hundreds of plunging pods broke through and hurtled within.In an instant, dark soldiers surrounded the metal shuttles; but intense bolts of blue light discharged in their direction.Thrown back, the Crilshan sentries quickly became outnumbered by the Titanese Guard bounding from their transports.But the dark eyed beings were prepared, and in the darkness of the higher most caverns an army of thousands had formed to meet them.Organised battalions marched to the fore, chanting and drumming and heaving mighty weapons of war.Fires, torches, and bright beams were cast out by the allies, lighting the great level and the foes before them.The brave Guard held aloft the gold crest flag bearing the majestic eagle of Titan, and the men and women cheered in the darkness; light and fervent hope emerged from their cheers.And the Dark Race hesitated.The Titanese, Rotavarians, Retanis, and Earthlings all moved steadily forward: a terrifying sight and roar.Among them Ruben charged through, igniting his coil and knocking back several armed Crilshans.Mendoza kept close by, firing also, and she followed him through the skirmish towards the towering wall of the cavern.Above, through the now mechanically sealing holes in the covering, there burst through large carriers containing allied warriors, all sending up plumes of dirt and loam as they set down.Some soared ahead and rained light fire upon the enemy.Ruben grimaced as a cascade of magma, flowing dark amber down the far cavern wall, was launched up high by the Crilshan watch and struck an Earthling transport, bringing it down before it could reach the other bank.Captain Mendoza appeared at his side, lifted her helmets dark visor, and cried, You dont have much time!He lifted his own visor.You know what youre doing, Ernesta?Always, she said.Run now.My thoughts go with you, my General!An ear splitting clamour wave went off nearby, taking his hearing with it.He shook his heavy head, reminded himself why he was here: his girls were the only thing that mattered.He placed his arm on Mendozas shoulder and saluted his captain, before charging off and dashing into a tunnel leading down from the great level and away from the screams of battle.Four elite Guard followed him, coils ignited.As the tremors of combat pulsed around them the five men raced along darkened tunnels.As they descended lower and lower, meeting very little resistancethe available units now being sent abovehis men stopped abruptly outside a heavy metal gate.Ruben caught up moments later.The men appeared to be thinking, the confusion evident on their faces.What is it?he asked, removing his helmet and struggling to catch his breath.Cant we get through?No, sir.We can get through without a problem.And that itself is the problem, Ruben said.Youre right.This is all too easy.Though lacking vital oxygen, the Generals mind raced, knitting together all that he had learned, straining to figure out what was going on.Let me think about this, he said.They were prepared for us coming.Proximan reinforcements had already been dispatched before we arrived.Theyve removed all the security from these areas.He looked up.Sir, one spoke.I think this may be a trap.We cant turn back.Quickly, lets get through this gate.Taking out a deep code programmer, one of his Guard quickly began to gain access into the next room.Coilbolt in hand, crackling and spitting blue sparks, the other four stood warily on guard.Very soon the sound of many footsteps echoed along the passage, louder and closer.Quick as you can!he said.Almost there, General.A bright red light struck the wall above them.Several more followed.Were in!Coilbolts spat and discharged, roaring at the men now in pursuit.They appeared around the corner, but Ruben found himself forced into the next room.His men turned and fired.One was hit in the chest.Another fell against the wall.A third young Guard jumped through and closed the door as the final soldier collapsed to the ground.A thud as the gate sealed.Ruben straightened, cautious and unnerved.The room was dark, the glow from the two coils the only source of light.All was silent but for the two mens quick, heavy breaths.The room seemed more like a cavern, filled with manuscripts and records dating back centuries.Corridors, of which there were many, were carved from the molten rock.Shouts and blaster fire could be heard on the other side.How long until they get through?Minutes, General.Right then.Bowing his back he continued along a narrow corridor, surrounded above and to the sides with dry, serrated rock.The information he wanted was a lot more secure.But where was it?Holding the coil above his head, he turned a corner and continued down.The soldier followed.There was nothing here.No access station for the planets records.No e data panel.No Crilshan guard.A loud whine then came from the rooms entrance and a silhouette of light and shadow appeared at the corridors end.Outlines moved here and there, and the sound of many footsteps shuffled throughout the cavernous room.They were trapped.Ruben threw himself to the end of the row, just in time to avoid a grouping of Crilshans running past.He switched his coil off, holstered it, and took out his blaster.He looked about.The soldier had disappeared.Spread out!he heard.Hes in here and we have to find him!Ruben breathed deeply; his heart pummelled his tight chest.He was so tired he couldnt think straight.But the sound of his hunters caused alarm bells to ring.That was not the voice of a Crilshan!It was fearful, and had neither the burr nor the darkness of the tongue of Crilshar.That accent ...We know youre there, General!spoke the fearful voice again.Come out while you can!My lord, weve got one!Blaster fire.The boom of a coil.Shuffles and scrapes in the dark.The young Titanese soldier cried out and a bolt of red flashed through the black cavity.Cruel laughter echoed around him.He felt like slumping to the ground.Only one thought pushed him on: his girls were here, he knew it.And he was going to find them.He moved carefully down the next corridor, clutching his blaster firmly to his chest, which itself rose and fell rapidly in quickening succession.There he spotted another door.Two footsteps.Quietly.Quietly.Then out of the dark a light shone in his face, bitter cold made contact with his left shoulder, and a white hot pain seared his flesh.He fell onto his back.I have him!his assailant cried.Ive got the general.Ive caught him!But this general was not done with yet.He raised his blaster and a burning blue flash connected with the soldiers right leg, knocking him to the ground as he squealed in pain.Seizing his torch from him, Ruben attached it to his belt and threw his foot into the mans face.He then charged as fast as he could, moving for the door, wishing more than hed ever wished for anything that it was unlocked.Bullets and powerful blasts of light landed all around him.Ignoring them and the terrible pain in his shoulder he carried on.He reached the door, and he fell through.The blasts stopped.He jumped back up, and in one last ditch attempt to lose the pursuers he took out his coilbolt, jamming it into the doors control panel.A secondary door slammed down.Voices cried out on the other side.Get through there!he heard.We have to get through.We have to get him!But the lock  Just get through!the voice rang out, afraid and almost recognisable.But Lord  Tear it down!BOOOM!Ruben rotated on the spot, expecting another barren tunnel, so it came as quite a shock to find what hed least expected: the Crilshan access station for the planetary records sat before him, unguarded, and he wasted no time in hastening over.He gazed up at the powerful super computer, one of the most advanced in existence, reaching as high as the sixty foot ceiling and bearing leavers, huge pipes, and complicated circuitry all over like hairs on a dogs back.He couldnt quite understand how it had been so easy to log on and begin his search, but he no longer cared.He took a deep breath.A forceful pounding slammed against the rooms hatch.Time was short.There was no other way out of here.He pulled out his blaster and a well aimed shot took out the interior control panel.That might buy a couple of minutes.He ignored the resultant hammering and stifled bellows, and made his way through the foreign files.It was lucky for him that his Crilshan was perfect.He began to type:      </cd>  < Database Search: text    >  <    Mission Histories/search/: Station Aurora >      If Crilshar was behind what happened to his nieces, it would say so here, even if it was a clandestine operation.The reply flashed up:      </cd>  < Database Search Result:    >  <    No Results >      Furka!He tried again:      </cd>  < Database Search: text    >  <    Mission Histories/search/Mission Documents/: Agent Gordian >      One moment, then:      </cd>  < Database Search Result:    >  <    Reassigned To Order A. M.>  </cd/Error!Classified >      Order A. M, he said to himself.Ive never heard of it!The sound of voices and cries and booms outside grew louder.Any moment now they would be in here with him.He searched again:      </cd>  < Database Search: text    >  <    Classified Terminology /search/: What Is Order A. M. ?>      Come on!he cried.</cd>  < Database Search Result:    >  <    No Results >      No!He sat back, tearing at his hair.And then it hit him like a lightning bolt.It was so obvious.So damn obvious!He leaned back in, and in one last attempt to uncover the mystery that had plagued him all this time, he typed into the computer:      < Erebus >      An explosion sounded outside the room and the hatch rattled on its hinges.</cd>  < Database Search Result:    >  <    Erebus: Directive Of Order A. M.>      It exists!he cried.Another BOOOM!His mind buzzed.Erebus existed.And Gordian was reassigned; he wasnt working for the Dishan when he attacked Titan.But if not them, then whom?Another rumble shook the room.He looked around in panic.Nowhere to escape.Nowhere to hide.The pounding continued, and then one final blow struck the door.It fell into the room.Seventy One      Ruben Berenguer held his breath.Silently he watched several figures enter the cavern, holding guns and bright beams, and all were clad in dark, flowing robes with strange metal masks.Hes not here, one said.Thats not possible, replied another.The anxiety in his voice once more seemed familiar to Ruben.Hes here, hes got to be!The fearful figure moved around the room.The General stuffed his fist into his mouth.Point your light over there.Theres only one corner in here he could be hiding.The humming machinery cast back the bright beam as its light was thrown into the rocky corner, exposing an empty space.Ruben smirked.From atop a ledge, thirty foot up the computer console, he gazed down at the figures and the panicking man.How he had managed to scale the precarious live wires and searing cylinders so hastily and yet not trip or fall hed never know.The group separated and desperately began checking each shadowy crevice thoroughly.It was clear to him that these men were not from Crilshar.The way they spoke and the fact they carried torches to see in the dark gave that away.So just who were they, and what were they doing here?He clutched his shoulder, which had become worryingly numb, and looked up, sweating.Almost to the top.Swinging his leg around another wire cable he hauled himself up a little more.Im telling you, hes not here, he heard from below.We were told to wait down here for the general, answered the leader.Our job was simple.We cant go back to the Cronat without him.Hes on his way here personally!What?To Crilshar?B ...But hell kill us where we stand if we fail him!The Generals not here!I promise you!Thats it, he thought; leave, agree with him and go back.But the nervous man did not.Instead he pulled out a pistol, held it up to the others head, and blasted through his face with a mighty crack.A hush followed, and Ruben held off inhaling for fear of being heard in the silence surrounding the gentle hum of the enormous processor.But the stillness was broken as another man yelled, My Lord, Lord Mokrikov, Ive found something!Mokrikov?Ruben froze where he was.Had he said Mokrikov?What is it?he said as he strode over.My Lord Mokrikov, hes been here for sure.Mere minutes ago!Hes been searching the databases for mission histories.And?And, wait, and agent profiles.The next sentence out of your mouth had better be something useful!He knew he recognised the voice, the accent, the fear.His old friend stood below, attempting to hunt him out.But how and why?The masked man below gulped and continued typing.Yes!he cried.Berenguers last search brought up plans for this levels aeration system!Oh, no.Mokrikov and the masked men glared up and around, casting their bright beams all over.But Ruben had already moved.Clambering through a metal hatch he dropped a grenade beneath him and disappeared through the vent.* * *  In all his time as a chief of the Rotavarian Defence Force, Aleksey Vasily had never actually been into space.Not even into orbit around his own world.As a child, like all others, hed dreamt of it.But like all others, for him it was an impossible thought.And now that he was here, at the centre of this silent, raging struggle, he realised that somebody should have warned him it was this ...horrifying.Peering out of the porthole, he watched the three rectangular shaped crafts representing Earth.One remained at the forefront of the assault while the other two descended to Crilshar.For peace lovers they certainly knew how to wage war.As the Proximan reinforcements levelled themselves out to attack, the Earth vessel bombarded the Crilshan centre, joined by a salvo of Titans razor thread missiles.The enemy barrages maintained a counter storm and a single, enormous enemy vessel passed over the Chiefs small craft as it drifted through.He had never felt so insignificant.He watched closely as a line of Titanese carriers deployed another wave of pods; small specks of light plunging through the atmosphere toward the molten coloured caverns below.In minutes his craft entered the dock of the Retani Control Ship, the largest vessel in the fleet and, quite possibly, in orbit.He had no idea what he was going to say to the Retani, but he knew for certain that there was no way he could stay on board his own ship while the Retanis broke their promise.As he walked along the corridor with three of his own soldiers, a Retani chieftain stopped them where they were.You will turn around and go back to your transport, Rotavarian.The hell I will!Im going to see your master.He went to walk past, but the Retani pulled out a knife.Vasily reacted without thinking and knocked the blade from his hand, sending him back into the wall.One of his soldiers stunned him and lowered the unconscious Retani to the floor.I dont know why they dont want us to see their master, he said to his soldiers, but to be safe, wait here.But sir, said one.Do you know where youre going?Vasily smiled.Mere days spent with General Berenguer had inspired the Chief to step up his game.He had spent every waking second researching everything about their allies and enemies.Oh yes, he said.I know exactly where Im going.Now that hed made his decision everything seemed so clear.How could anyone not want to fight alongside Titan?Fear had stopped him before; but now he was a chief again.Brave.Proud.Strong.Slipping through the silent corridors he followed loud, booming voices.He recognised one from the Retani Peninsula.Taking out his Titanese coilbolt, a gift from the General, he stunned a Retani with his back to him and continued through.It wasnt long until he reached the viewing centre of the vessel, stealing footsteps until he could make out what Retani Iraan, the son of Master Gobisla, was saying.Iraan took a deep breath.What do you want me to do?Exactly as you are told.The voice which replied sent ripples down Vasilys spine.Not him.Not now.The Retani fleet is at your command, my Lord Cronat.Very good.Now have your crew follow the instructions being sent to your display.Vasily leaned around the corner and caught a glimpse of the masked man he had spoken to via image link upon Rotavar.The same masked man to whom he had swore to bring General Berenguer to.My father will not like this, Iraan said.Your father considers you a strong man, the masked Cronat replied.The invasion fleet would not have been left in your hands had he thought otherwise.You have chosen your allegiance well.Now show your father how strong you are.Vasily watched in horror as the crew of the control vessel repositioned the ship so that it faced the outer edge of the Titanese fleet.In the distance he recognised the Quasar, suspended beside his own ship.The Cronat growled, Do it!The viewing centre shook as enormous beams of white light were released from the vessel and all those in the vicinity.No!Vasily screamed.Retani Iraan spun, and at once Retani warriors were upon the young chief.He fought back in vain.The beams soared forwards.Vasily almost stopped breathing.The first struck the Quasar with catastrophic effect.Many other vessels were assaulted.No, he cried.No, no!The vessels central hulls were torn to shreds, masses of metal flying from each of them.So much death.So much hate.Laughter filled his ears as the room faded.Seventy Two      It felt as though he had been crawling for hours before Ruben finally stopped to breathe.Despite the air blowing a cool breeze through the vent alongside him, every muscle, bone, and sinew ached and burned, and the growing feeling of disorientation ebbed away at his already depleted sanity.He was so sure he had read the plans correctly; but then again he had had mere seconds with which to memorise his route.The fingers in his left hand were prickling.He yearned for it to be down to something other than his injured shoulder.He could no longer feel it at all.As despair took hold and the realisation that hed taken the wrong tunnel hit him, something caught his ear.The sound of a voice calling out with a whimper travelled through the shaft like the clear ringing of a trumpet in the wind.He crawled a little more.Rubens eyes had only faintly become accustomed to the dark, but he was certain a dim light shone ahead.The renewed hope gave him the strength to scramble to the end of the metallic tunnel.At its end was a surprisingly thin grate, which he pushed aside without difficulty.Once out he stood back and marvelled at the sight before him; a sight he knew in many centuries very few had seen.A great chamber with black ceilings reached out, lit dimly by at least one hundred widely spaced candles mounted on tall spires.It was gloomy, even by Crilshan standards.The hall was rounded, made in mockery of Titans great domes, and was split into two levels.He now stood on the upper floor and looked over the balcony, to the place the moaning sound originated.He strode slowly down the onyx steps and across the circular room.As he approached the source of the moaning he stopped and held his breath, unable to fathom the great truth he had discovered.Before him, stood tall and perilous, were the three thrones of the Dishan.Three tall, black chairs stood in line; and they looked as though they were made from the bones of a legendary creature, enormous and unimaginable in might.However, sat upon the middle of the three thrones, unable to move and swaying unkindly over the edge of the seatweighed down by skin, deformed, and pallid beyond comparisonwas the greatest of the three.Yux Dishan, he whispered, horrified at the distorted man now whimpering like a child, unspeaking and scarcely able to move his large, protruding mouth.The smell was sickening.Yux Dishan.How ...How can you be ...what kind of evil?Sounds of slamming and the clamour of voices then came from down the corridor and Ruben rushed back up the nearby steps and out of sight.Yux Dishan stopped whimpering and stared at the group now entering the great chamber.We did as was requested of us.It was Mokrikov.He strode into the chamber, flanked by a man and a woman, who were shadowed by several masked and cloaked forms.We waited where we were told, he said.It is no fault of ours that you took the order for deficient security a little too seriously.The only woman among them hurried forwards and rushed to the High Lord lay upon his throne.Hush now, my love, said Avaj Dishan, stroking her brothers dark, uneven hair and rocking his buckled form.Im sorry Ive not been to see you today.Things are happening, just like I told you they would.You did not do what was requested of you, countered the dark man stood at the centre of the room, or I would already have my prize.And you will address me as High Lord when in my chamber.I am Wivartha Dishan and you will treat me with utmost respect!Ruben watched Mokrikovs reply, which amounted to nothing more than a craven sneer as he knitted his dense, black brow.Yux whined again at the dark presence in the chamber.The true High Lord had succumbed to the genetic manipulation as many before him had done, Ruben understood.The Pure Gene had taken Crilshars true leader, and yet, nobody was any the wiser.Poor thing.Used by his own uncle as a scapegoat for crimes he has obviously taken no part in.Well?said Wivartha furiously.I will hear it.How do you address me?Mokrikovs head bowed timidly, his lip twitched.We shall see when my master arrives.Oghub, oghub!laughed Wivartha.The Cronat!His hand moved to the hilt of his long, belted blade.Lord Malizar is as welcome here as the heinous army now above us!You were not invited down among our people.Remember that, creature.But as his temper frayed, his threat was interrupted by a sharp, piercing laughter which sounded from the dark end of the chamber.Ruben peered across as the slender silhouette of Avaj Dishan wandered to the centre of the room to stand behind Wivartha.Uncle, she said, do not allow yourself to become angered by this pitiable intruder.Her voice rang, delicate and forceful.We allow them to remain with us for the honour of the great Cronat, but not because we have to.Debatable, Mokrikov mumbled.Ruben continued to watch intently as she circled the rooms centre, placing a hand upon her uncles shoulder, and moving close to whisper in his ear.His hand, in turn, released the blade hilt.The Golden Army has penetrated our higher levels, she said.They have reached the seventh bombardal and the molten works; their allies have taken the summit cavern and smashed the outer transmission hub.But the tide will, as ever, turn in our favour.Gentlemen, my dear Yux has some news for us.She flowed in between the company of cloaked men stood behind Mokrikov, and smiled.Think not of our temporary company, but concentrate on the army which battles its way through our uppermost levels at this very moment ...Ruben watched her eyes search his position; his heart fluttered....and think of the man which stands above, listening to all that we say!The entire room turned to the place upon which Avajs eyes landed.Ruben panicked; he stood and twisted to run.But he realised too late that several silver masked figures had been standing behind him.They moved for him and he laid a well aimed blow in the stomach of the nearest.He ducked the return cuff but a striking pain shot through his body as a kick reached his chest and another found the back of his leg.Then, as though pulled by invisible chains, he was forced backwards through the stone barrier and down to the ground below with a thud!It took some moments for him to come around, and he expected to receive a beating or even a sudden execution.But no one came near him.Rolling onto his front and resting on his elbows he looked up into the cold face of Wivartha Dishan.He remained still; every part of him cried out in agony.A dull pain filled his head and he looked to the floor to see the drip drop of warm blood trickle down from his brow.Then the torture intensified and he was lifted from the ground, held up by dark hands.They turned him towards Mokrikov, whose eyes pierced through him.He wished to speak, but couldnt summon the strength.Mokrikovs lips moved.Ruben could hear nothing but a clear ringing and a distant cry calling his name.He could distinguish two voices, and his heart yearned for their faces: his girls gazed back at him with familiar, soft eyes, smiling.They needed him.He couldnt give up on them now.Hed been through too much.Slowly his awareness returned and somehow the strength in his body was renewed.Suddenly he was back in the chamber.Kill him now!Wivartha cried.Not here, said Avaj.It must be done so that everyone may see!That is not your decision, Mokrikov commanded.We will await my master.The High Lords voice then filled with rage.Do not presume to tell me what I can and cannot do with my own prisoner!Mokrikovs eyes glared.The subjects of the Cronat have no prisoners of their own!This was his chance.It was now or never.How dare you?!Ruben fought the arms holding him and reached for Mokrikovs pistol.Swinging it high he slammed it into his old friends jaw.He spun on the spot and fired madly at both Mokrikov and the crowd of cloaked men, before turning to the High Lord himself.Wivarthas dark eyes met with his.A bullet released from the chamber of his gun.Pierced through tender flesh.Wivarthas eyes widened, and then fell from his enemys, down to his nieces form, which, though small, had stepped between him and the bullet.He caught her, fell with her.She gazed up at him, and then her eyes closed.Wivartha laid her on the ground.The cry of Yux Dishan echoed through the room.Mokrikov knelt on the ground, panting.Two of the masked men cried aloud from the black floor, bleeding profusely and begging for help.All ignored them.Wivartha stood slowly; a fire burned in his black and red eyes.Pulling out his blade he lifted it high in the air.At the same time Ruben raised the pistol for one final shot.As Wivartha lunged he pulled the trigger.The bullet released.But it did not reach its target.Both men stopped and watched as the bullet hung in mid air, suspended in time.As though night had fallen, a chill covered the room and darkness plummeted.A cold wind surrounded them, and the sound of a bell chiming echoed throughout the obscure cavity.Four times.Ruben breathed slowly.He stood gazing at the bullet before him.Then the gun was wrenched from his hand and he twisted to see it fall to dust before a black form, hooded and cloaked in dark robes and masked in purest silver.The being pointed to the suspended bullet and clenched his hand into a fist  an implausibly shocking impact rattled through him.Rubens legs gave way and he fell forwards, hurled to the ground.The sensation as one of unbearable tearing filled his very chest, followed by a disorientating numbness.As bone and tissue were torn and shattered the room and everyone within it faded ...Sounds were barely audible, but he could make them out as though he were in the next room.Figures moved around him, and a faint wailing called mutely.All was faint, cold, and unclear.Indescribable shock then poured into his mind.Opening his eyes, he understood where he was.Nobody had touched him, but instead all were bowed down.His breathing came in small gasps as he struggled to gulp the thin air around him, unable to move.He was going to die.And he could only think of two people.The only two people.The cloaked wraith moved nearby.Ruben watched him drift slowly about, surrounded by kneeling bodies.Bring them in, he ordered, cold, commanding, and cruel.Wivartha stayed low, as did the cloaked soldiers.Mokrikov knelt nearby, shaking.They all watched two uncloaked forms escorted into the chamber.Ruben did his upmost to make them out, but, in his truly agonizing state, warm blood seeping from the bullet wound in his chest, he could make out only one.Impossible.Seventy Three      ROTAVAR  FIVE WEEKS AGO      Rotavar will be safe.Prime Minister Edgar Mokrikov surveyed those wavering before him, stood within his grand office.Looking his chief, Aleksey, in the eye, he reached into his pocket.But as lord of this world I have failed.I am of no further use.To you, Rotavar, or our sister colony.I am so, so sorry.Of Manera there is little hope.And as silence fell on the room, darkness covering the horrified city outside, hope descended, and Mokrikov pulled out of his pocket his silver gleaming pistol, forced it up underneath his chin, and pulled the trigger.Click!Everyone took a step forward.Mokrikovs heart raced to the speed of a beating drum.The pistol hadnt fired.He pulled the trigger again.Click!Gasps filled the room.He fired again and again but still nothing happened.Chief Vasily raced towards him, prized the gun from his shaking hand, and held him close as the prime minister fell forwards in shock.He had been ready.His life was at its end.He had to finish it.But it was too late.Screams filled the room.The open door of the office found itself suddenly blocked by several figures clad in black robes and metal masks.They released small barbs at the necks and faces of the delegation.Some of the soldiers reached for their weapons but moved too slow and so fell to the ground with the others.Theyve come for me!Mokrikov cried, feebly clawing at Vasilys coat, pulling him closer.My journal!he hissed.They mustnt get it!Aleksey, my journal!Mokrikov moved for the safe at the side of his desk, but his chief pulled him over the writing table and onto the ground behind it as a torrent of barbs missed them by the length of a hair.No!My diary!The answers!My diary!My confession!He watched helplessly as Vasily leaned over the desk and fired his own pistol, spilling the blood of the cloaked figure sent to retrieve them.It was then that Mokrikov viewed, to his complete and utter horror, the man whose presence hed been dreading now ascend the steps to the heavy metal desk at its pinnacle.And the figure spoke the words he had known as a boy, the words they had learnt from he who now spoke them with an unrivalled malice:  Deep beneath the moon we lay; cut off from life, so why not stay?No, he whimpered.Please!To struggle with the rest, you see; to torture, kill, and crush the free!NO!It is time, Edgar, said the Cronat.You always knew this day was coming.You were wrong to betray your master, but he will take you anyway.Please.Come now!Not a chance!Vasily yelled and he activated the terrace shutters from the switch in the desk drawer.He took Mokrikovs arm, hauled him towards the opening balcony, and emptied what bullets he had left at the approaching man, who effortlessly threw them aside like leaves in the wind.Mokrikov slammed his fist into the shutters control panel set on the wall, quickly closing the solid partition behind them as they passed beneath.Only now there was nowhere to run.You knew they were coming, Vasily said as the old prime minister fought to catch his breath.Who are they?Theyre ...my ...people, he said, realising there was no longer any point in denying the truth, let alone hiding it.Theyve been part of my life since I was a child  Thud!The metal panel began to give way as the wraiths on the other side threw all their weight into tearing it down.Why do they want you?Vasily asked.Mokrikov took hold of his chiefs hand and lifted it between them.He bore on his palm a deep gash and Vasily winced as Mokrikov touched a single finger to it.As by magic, though Mokrikov knew there was no such thing, the soft tissue in the middle of his bloody hand knitted back together.The prime minister removed his finger and stepped back, watching the mesmerised man raise his hand to the shadowed sunlight in awe.That is why theyve come for me, he said, paying no heed to the pounding on the panel behind them.What are you?Cursed, he said.They will never leave me.Not while I am alive.Youre a Istron.Mokrikov nodded.Neither of their attention could then be focused on anything else, as they gazed up to the sister moon Manera, scarcely visible in the barrage filled sky, and watched all life on its beautiful green plains extinguished.Bright floods of white flame covered its surface, and Mokrikov turned away, weeping.He looked to Aleksey, and, closing his eyes, pushed his chief over the edge of the balcony and onto the sloped roof far below.For him there was some hope, but there was none for Edgar Mokrikova child of Europa.He turned back, a tear rolled down his cheek, and he stared into the face of his Cronat, the great Lord Malizar.Seventy Four      For years we were concealed beneath our haven.Our talents suppressed.Our voices strangled.Peter Marx would allow none to leave, to be free, to choose.Until we decided, no more!Until we chose to fight back, to leave our shelter and retake what always belonged to us.Ruben peered up from his fallen position and watched Lord Malizar move through the circle of kneeling bodies.How loud are the booming cries of desperate men?he snarled.Which hand should be stayed, and which raised, indignant with rage?Is it fair that those different are punished for the fears of the rest?Ruben sputtered, You are Istrons.We were Istrons.Now we are something else entirely.Punished and shunned we were.Now we have dominance.As though emerging from his hateful trance, Malizar spun to peer upon the general.And so you see, Aleksey Vasily was never yours.He was mine.Honourable though I am sure his intentions were, he betrayed you, Ruben.How do you feel about that?No, Vasily sobbed, having been dragged in and cast upon the chamber floor, now knelt beside his prime minister, who in turn stared at the ground.I didnt want, I  You betrayed your general!You exchanged the freedom of your world for his deliverance.And you delivered well.At the Cronats command one of the cloaked figures walked over to Rubens immobile form and placed a hand onto his chest.At once, though his lung continued to compress almost completely, his heartbeat, his mind, and his senses reached a fixed height.Adrenaline, said the Cronat.You must be awake to hear this.Why?was the only word Ruben could say to Vasily.Why?Vasily looked up.They ...They offered my home freedom.That is why Crilshar ...abandoned Rotavar?Yes, he said.After that I knew Id have to do as I promised.I did as they asked and delivered the letter, urging you to invade.But it appears it did not take much urging, said the silver masked being.Ruben heard no more.Everything had gone silent again.His heart followed his anaesthetized mind, as the second figure brought into the room was thrown forward.It was a woman.Her hair hung down past her shoulders in a way he had never seen.She was beautiful.His gaze met with hers and stayed locked.M ...Maxim?Maxim Pinzn rushed towards him and held her warm hand to his freezing brow.Im so sorry, Ruben.Maxim ...His mind couldnt take the thought.You ...I saw your body ...in your office ...you ...you ...Stay still, she said.Youre going to be all right.Just breathe ...breathe for me.There were three.Three betrayals to destroy Ruben Berenguer.But the fourth was worse still.He looked up at the masked figure which moved above him like a cloud in a restless wind.You have been a problem in my path for too long now, the Cronat said.Lord Malizar, he said.Who ...Who are you?He laughed to himself.How could I expect you to know who we are?Then reveal yourself to me.I am no longer a threat.No, he said, his deep voice a cruel rattle as he reached up to remove the silver disguise, you are not.Though numb, Rubens whole body shook as the powerful, silver eyes of Von Viticus stared back at him.He looked back to Edgar, Aleksey, and Maxim as they knelt, watching.How could they stand there, alive?How could they be part of this?Only, that was not what truly stung him at the core; the heart rending reality was that he had betrayed everyone else.And they had betrayed him.He deserved it.But Anna and Glana and Callista do not.How?he said.How  Did I achieve this?finished the Cronat ...Von Viticus ...Lord Malizar.A long time and a consummate amount of skill.I doubt you are aware of what happened within the moon of Europa fifty years ago.A ruin, he said.A loss that should never have happened.You mean to say  The Istron race did not fall, said Malizar, almost concerned that he should know that fact.It did not fall.It merely transformed.And we are what emerged.I was born Marrak Malizar beneath the moon and taught by the great leader of the Istrons: the abomination who would not share his true gift.We have spent our lives hunting him and his followers since the day Europa fell.Ruben lifted his head painfully and stared at Maxim in the dim light.You died, he said.I was there ...Maxim, you were dead.Maxim Pinzn is among the most gifted of the Order, said Malizar.From the old master whose name we do not utter, she received the echo of immortality.She would have only appeared dead to you.She was once known as Ximma Uiban.I saved her as Europa fell, when the old master fled, leaving her to die.But Edgar, Ruben pleaded.You died too!And who told you that?Malizar smirked and Vasily shifted uncomfortably.This is who you warned me of?he asked Mokrikov.In your letter?In your diary?Mokrikov nodded, trembling.Edgar is not a strong man, said Malizar.His attempts at betrayal worked in my favour this time.He brought you here, to me.But there will not be a second time, will there?Mokrikov whimpered.WILL THERE?No, m ...my Cronat.I did my ...my best, Maxim said to Ruben, open and defiant.I always knew that our real master wanted to keep me safe.And poor old Lucasta.I do miss them.Ruben smiled feebly, and whispered, Lucastas still alive.She now calls herself Callista.Maxim said nothing, and a single tear fell down her cheek.I know, she whispered so that Malizar could not hear.I think Ive always known.But when she revealed her power at our last Council I knew it for certain.And I knew with no doubt in my mind that my allegiance belonged to you.I never wanted to be part of this.You did not, Ximma, said Malizar; and he lifted his cloak to reveal his left wrist, upon which was emblazoned the image of a full Moon and Triangle.But you are.You bear the mark of my Order too.Do not forget it!Order A. M. , Ruben said.Yes.The great Order of the Allied Moon.Soon to be heirs of the Von of Earth.No, I wont let you!Maxim cried, pulling a pistol from her cloak and raising it.Malizar crushed it in her hand.Her lips locked together and her face burned blood red.He turned to Ruben.You see, General, he said, when I initiated the fall of Europa all those years ago we put into effect my plan, and preserved the new generation of Istrons.We took the children and raised them, those with echoes and those without, and then returned many to their Alignment worlds of origin with the single task of reaching the greatest positions of authority possible.Istron children at the heart of the Alignment, ready to tear it down when the order came.Hence, we have here the Prime Minister of Rotavar and the Lady of the Golden Army of Titan.Except not all reached such heights, and those that did decided they cared too much for their people.Hence we have here two traitors.Trusting them was my mistake.Not all have the conviction I myself gained by becoming a leading member of the Von under the guise of the feeble old Von Viticus.He laughed again, cold and cruel.So you mean, Ruben said, soft and slow, his heartbeat weakening once more, that Bravoral ...Malizar nodded.Lord Di sak of Bravoral is indeed ours.The planet Samos?The Kind Queens echoed powers of possession and influence leave little to be desired.And the Emperor of Enustine?Ah yes, he said.Emperor Abacco.Unfortunately we were unable to raise our Istron to a level appropriate enough to usurp the Emperor.Though the others have weakened their own space sufficiently.We will deal with our Enusti agent when we are ready.What will happen to them all?Maxim asked, once more on her knees.Regrettably, he said, and with a hint of pleasure, we no longer require their allegiance.The Dishan and the Retani Dynasty have provided armies aplenty.And you have handed us victory on a plate, General.What will happen to them?They will be executed.There are still Istrons in the Systems, Ruben said.Theyre still out there, giving hope and guidance to many.He clutched his chest as his body tensed with pain.The room started to fade, little by little.What was left of the Istrons died with Europa, Malizar said, dropping his bottom lip in a menacing sneer.Now all that is left is humanity ...and us.And I most definitely do not plan on losing the war this time around.Seventy Five      Thunder echoed through the caverns.Light and dark continued to clash as fire and smoke like death and foul flame rose up and around the higher cave walls.Powerful drums of war hammered and pound a drum beat of ruin.Mendoza and her guard were many levels deep now.Theyd arrived at the point they needed to reach.She had hoped they could stay ahead of the clashing armies, but without a means to breach their secure and guarded levels, theyd had no choice but to wait for reinforcements.But here they were.Theyd made it.Shed done what Ruben had asked of her.The containers were in place.Mendoza stood back and surveyed the battle scene before her.There were no safe ridges upon this level; it was one limitless plateau, where vast bodies of men and women now collided with incomprehensible chaos.Bloodied corpses fell to the ground or else shattered into dust and pieces.The Crilshans were stronger in body and skill than any army she had ever faced.Waves of Retani, Rotavarian, and Titanese pelted the Crilshan line, coilbolts and blasters firing in every direction.The Retani soldiers charged wildly to and fro, firing upon and hacking down any enemy they could find.But still the Crilshan line held, and the Captains thoughts became tainted with despair.On hostile land, beneath enemy soil they fought; but they were lacking the heavy artillery needed to win.Mendoza sensed victory slipping from their grasp.Soon the Crilshans attacked with a wave of their own, but their line broke before they reached the Titanese Guard, clad in their black and gold armour.Mendoza raised her own coil and accurately tore down several foes, waving her weapon in a frenzy of electric blue fire, before moving back quickly to the speedily assembled communication centre.There her comm leaders stood, giving and receiving orders via comms to the battlefield.Communication had been lost with the armada currently clashing above the planet, and they were on their own for the moment.The Retani chieftains were stationed nearby, also attempting to keep communication with the divided companies throughout the limitless caverns.But something was wrong.As she ran over, the Retani leaders were suddenly stood, looking at each other; whispering, with grave, intense faces.She couldnt tell over the roar of battle just what they were saying to each other.But seconds later it was well and truly clear.One of the chieftains looked over and his eye met with Mendozas.His eyes dimmed.The Retani raised his blaster and aimed it at the Titanese comm post.But the Titan trained warrior was faster.She lifted her right arm, coil primed, and flicked her upper limb forwards with all her strength.The ensuing blast of energy took out several of the Retanis and devastated the comm link between them.However, whatever order they had just received, it had already made it through.Mendoza turned in horror and watched as the chieftains yelled and cried fresh orders, and at once huge numbers of Retani warriors spun and advanced on the Titanese line.Surrounded by allies and enemies, hundreds of her Guard were at once overwhelmed.NO!she cried, utterly helpless.Enemy soldiers began charging through the column, impaling men and women alike with their spears and extended blades.No longer a battle, the chaos of a rout quickly became a massacre.And Mendoza had only one thought: she had to warn Ruben.Before she could move, a beam mortar detonated just ahead; the impact sent her flying into the damaged console to her rear.Her coil fell from her hand.Men were sent soaring, their echoing cries lost in the ensuing clamour of destruction and death.She picked herself up and knelt, gasping for air, winded, before struggling to her feet, grasping her coil, and charging through the tumult.She knocked down several joyous Crilshans she found in her way as they chanted and laughed at the retreating army of gold.Directly ahead, one Crilshan headed for her, and she took a deep breath, brought her coil up, and forced it through his helmet, shattering his visor and driving the shards into his face.A blow was struck across her back and she staggered forwards, releasing a bolt at a passing warrior.She took down two.She focused her eyes and saw another temporary comm station just ahead; she had to inform Ruben of the betrayal.She had to warn him.But before she could move, a hand seized her shoulder.Mendoza turned into the bloody face of the Crilshan whose helmet she had broken.His face twisted, blood spattered and bulging, and he brought his head forward, knocked it into hers, sending her to the ground.She twisted and crawled away, attempting to find her coil among the mass of bodies beneath.Blood oozed from her face.A hand found her back and pulled her up.It was him.Thud!His hand broke her jaw.She landed on her stomach sobbing, and scrambled for her life.Everything and everyone around her moved without sound.Blasts and waves of fire filled her vision.A sharp pain raged through the back of her head and her face plunged into the blood red sludge.Something heavy forced her face down into the mud.She couldnt breathe.At once she was pulled up and thrown onto her back.The only thing she could see was the dark smile and black stare of the blood covered Crilshan as he threw his blade to the ground and clambered on top of her.His hands wrapped around her throat.She clawed at his face, gasping for breath.He wouldnt let go.No, she thought; you will not take my life!His face spun, laughter rang in her ears.Her hand found her pocket, lifted the device from inside.And she released the trigger, connected to the grenade in her hand, the smile on the Crilshans face turned to terror, and everything blasted into blackness.Seventy Six      They had lost.There was nothing more Ruben could do.His vision failed as he watched the image link now projected onto the chamber wall.His fleet above Crilshar was decimated; the Golden Army shattered; a silent death in space for his brave soldiers.The rout in the higher levels had turned into a hunt.None could escape.None would know what had transpired within the caverns tonighton this black night of battle and betrayal.As the entire room watched the far wall, Edgar Mokrikov scurried towards his old friend.Im sorry, Ruben, he said.Im so, so sorry.Ruben shook his head.Maxim held her hand over his chest, compressing the wound.Let me, Mokrikov said.Allow me this.And he went to place his hand over the wound.I can help him.I can make him well again.But a pale hand took his wrist as he leaned in.No, Wivartha said, and he pulled Mokrikov up, tossing him to the ground in the centre of the chamber.You will not heal that disgrace!He deserves to die!Then Wivartha stopped where he stood, silent.Lord Malizar moved towards the old Dishan and whispered something into his ear.The Crilshan stepped back and kneeled again.The fate of Ruben Berenguer is no longer important, Malizar said, looking at Mokrikov, who whimpered where he was.You have no right to heal him, traitor.I would snap your neck were your echo not so useful.Crilshar has won victory over Titan, Wivartha said to Malizar.We served you as best we could.Malizar watched Wivartha squirm.That is true.But you have had your time, Wivartha Dishan.You have ruled as High Lord where you were neither deserving nor entitled.You have served your Cronat well.But Crilshar requires a new commander.Somebody young, strong, and able.Somebody untainted.Somebody who understands anger and revenge ...and hate.He turned to Yux Dishan, sat on his throne, maimed, disfigured, and motionless, having watched events unfold.Somebody like him.Malizar looked to Mokrikov and nodded.The Rotavarian bowed in cowardice and staggered over to the mutated High Lord.Everybody stood transfixed and Ruben pushed himself up against the debris laden onyx steps.Maxim and Aleksey looked up, still kneeling.The old Rotavarian shuffled up to the line of three thrones.Once there he pressed both hands over Yuxs deformed face, closed his eyes, and pressed down.Yux began to tremble and convulse.Hes choking him!Wivartha said, he went to move forward.Malizar reached out a hand.The Dishan stood still.At once, Yuxs folds and masses of body, bone, and skin folded inward.His high pitched whimpering grew into a loud, deep cry of anguish.Uneven hair extended down past his shoulders and his outsized robes hung away as his brittle body snapped into previously unknown positions.Within seconds a man sat back in the place of the deformed creature, and slowly but surely there stepped forwardwicked and powerful with the Dark Army at his commanda High Lord.* * *  Under no circumstances, and certainly never before another, did a member of the Dark Race weep.But this one did.A dark tear fell down Yux Dishans cheek as he staggered over to his sisters lifeless form, not caring for the blood in which he found himself immersed.And Yux rocked Avajs body, stroking her long, fair hair as she had for him every day of his unbearable, wretched life.Ruben watched, mortified at the man knelt before hima death for which he was answerable.One cruel aim deserves another, Yux said with unbearable grief.You took from me everything.I promise you, all will be taken from you.I have already lost everything ...I ever held dear, he said.The assault on Titan took somebody very close from me.The attack at Aurora took my nieces.I know they are here, and I have brought down all the force I can marshal ...to take them back.Yux looked up to his uncle.Wivartha shook his head.We are not responsible for the attack at the outpost you are referring to.Then who?I can answer that, said Malizar, flowing between them like a dark cloud.If you accept your place at my side, High Lord, I will enlighten you all to the answers you so terribly want.Yux Dishan did not answer; he simply bowed his head in submission to the Cronatthe self crowned man.Now, Malizar commanded his cloaked guard, leave us.Once the dark soldiers had left the chamber the Cronat surveyed the kneeling bodies.The two Dishan men knelt side by side.On their knees, the two Rotavarians did not raise a chin.The two Titanese, however, gazed updisgraced and at the mercy of an overwhelming darkness.Outpost Aurora, Malizar said, was attacked by my people, at my command.What?Your family is dead.No.He wouldnt believe it.He couldnt.For what?I doubt any of you have heard, not the rumour, but the tale ...of Erebus.Ruben had not.It seemed he was not the only one.Malizar motioned for silence.Old Earth mythology tells the story of Erebus.Son of Chaos, husband of Nyx, and the epitome of darkness and shadow.Now, listen carefully, because I will reveal this only once.Far past the borders of manned space there exists a planet, an uncharted world, known as Tempest Beta.It has thus far been the best kept secret within the entire history of the Four Systems.The best kept secret bar one.For orbiting the planet is an asteroid whose origin is not of this part of the galaxy.A ship under the influence of a commander of my Order discovered this place ten years ago, and I named it Erebus.So Crilshar never had it?Tears now stung Rubens eyes.No.They did not even know about it.My sister did, Yux said.What?You all undervalued her astuteness, he said.She spoke to me every day.She told me everything.She had heard the rumours, searched and probed for years, and finally learned the truth.Thats when she contacted Titan ...And told me of the Crilshan Weapon X, Maxim said.My unknown agent.It was her.I would never have imagined.Very clever, said Malizar.But now she is dead.And before you speak anymore I shall tell you: Erebus is not a weapon.Not in the sense we know.For upon it we discovered life equivalent to that of ourselves.And through it I now create my army.Army?Maxim squirmed.Yes, Ximma, army.Using the captives taken from Aurora to create a dark, unconquerable legion, whose darkness will spread across the Systems and eventually to Earth.All will obey my Order.All will submit to the Cronat: the new leader of the Istrons.They will fear us, as they should have, always.Humanity will bow to us, listen to us, and live as we tell them to live.Ruben looked to the ground.He had heard those words before.A darkness is approaching.
