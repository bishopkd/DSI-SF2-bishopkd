Ive pinpointed a few weaknesses, I lied.All I need is a bunch of guys, some decent hardware.Ray didnt want to give the idea a moments thought, I could see that, but his greed was already starting to nag.He glanced at his two guys but they remained expressionless.I didnt know what was going to come out of that snake hole of a mouth of his nextwhether hed take the bait or notbut at least Id given myself a chance.In the end he waved a dismissive hand and just reversed away from me.I grabbed the arm of a nearby chair and attempted to pull myself up, but it was a real struggle.Watch the blood!he shouted, and I fell back to the floor rather than stain his furniture.Whaddya think?he said, turning to his two boys.Van shook his head, like it was completely out of the question.Place is a fortress, he said.Ray turned to the other guy, Vans moody little sidekick, but obviously decided his opinion wasnt worth waiting for.If its true...he said, glaring at me, daring it to be otherwise.Again Van shook his head.Infinity?For sure they wouldnt be expecting anything.Van grunted.If it had been up to him I wouldnt have stood a snowball in hells chance, but Ray always was a greedy sonofabitch.Show us, he ordered, and a screen started glowing up from one of the walls.He gestured for Van to help me up.And dont think it gets you off the fucking hook either.Im no expert when it comes to technology, and my case wasnt helped by trying to pull up a map of the Infinity complex and getting an immediate NPI (not in the public interest) classification.I had to draw it, best I could, but at least it gave me a few moments to recall all the stuff Jimmyd told me.I went through the whole thing and it soon became apparent that they were grudgingly impressed by my thoroughness as I started telling them about the security cameras on the fence, the laser cannon on the roof and of course the dogs of war, the growlers.Shit!Shit!Van kept muttering every time I came up with yet another deterrent.So where are these fucking weaknesses?Ray asked, looking as daunted as his henchmen.For a moment I just stood there, wondering what the hell I was gonna say.After all, that was exactly what I wanted to know, what Id been trying to find out ever since I first clapped eyes on the place.I took a deep breath.First off, I told them, youre right: they wont be expecting anything.Theyre pretty good at throwing their weight around, but I bet its never occurred to them someone might do the same to them.Thats for sure, Van muttered sarcastically.The gates arent that heavily manned, I went on, clutching at straws.No need.All that automatic security, he commented.Not without power, I countered, again my mouth coming out with something I hadnt been expecting.All three of them turned to me, now looking just that little bit interested.If we can knock out their power, theyd lose a lot of their advantages.Theyll have fucking backup.Ray sneered.A generator?Sufficient to juice that place and all its equipment?I dont think so, I said, though actually I had no idea.Thered have to be compromises somewhere.Again there was silence and this time I could tell they were giving it serious thought.They might lose a few things if they have to go to a generator, I guess, Van conceded.Dyou know exactly where this woman is?Ray asked.Thats a helluva big place.Im working on it, I told him.Gotta couple of people on the inside.That was it: I felt a distinct tug on my line.Now they were impressed.Shes really worth all that dough?Ray asked, like he wanted to hear the word billions again.Yep, I assured him.Think about it: itd give them one helluvan advantage.Yeah, he snarled, as if it was his duty to at least make them pay dearly for that privilege.Again they fell silent.You could see why they were struggling with the idea; a few moments ago Id been a loose end that needed tying up, now Id have to becomeeven if only temporarilyan essential part of their organization.After all, I was offering them the most lucrative job theyd ever handled.We talked about it a while longerI provided a bit more padding and a helluva lot more bullshit; mostly to do with Lena and her special skills, how she could virtually turn night into dayand finally Ray let me go.The last thing he said before I went out the door was that if I screwed up again, hed kill me in the slowest, most torturously painful manner he could think of, and I didnt doubt it for one moment.I gave him my word I wouldnt, and left.I mean, it wouldnt have surprised me if that was what he had in mind anyway, that as soon as he got his hands on Lena Id get a quick couple of bullets or a burst of laser fire in the backbut it still felt like my best, maybe even my only, option.I just had to hope that somewhere in the confusion of the rescue Id be able to steal Lena away.Oh, yeah, and that Id never see Ray again as long as I lived.With the inducement of a couple of the bucks Id been keeping back for emergencies, I persuaded a delivery guy to give me a lift almost back to the churchyard.He wouldnt go the whole wayhe refused to enter the destroyed neighborhoodsbut took me as far as he dared.I didnt want to spend any of that money, but Id tried walking and it was just too damned painful.The expressions I was greeted with as I entered the shelter told me I probably looked every bit as big a mess as I felt.Clancy, Delilah cried, what the hell happened to you?You been to Infinity?Gordie asked.I slumped down on my sleeping bag, doing my best to keep any expression of pain off my face.Hanna jumped up to get me some water.Im fine, I lied, all four of them staring at me with obvious concern.I met Ray.Whoa!Jimmy gasped.Not cool.You know what families are like, I commented, pausing before making my announcement, Hes gonna help me get into Infinity.The little guy just stared.You serious?Ive thought of a few thingscutting off their power supply.Theyll have backup, he said, as if a child would know that.I know, but Im betting itll still leave them short in some areas.He sighed, neither agreeing, nor disagreeing.Big Guy!I dont have any other options!How many men does he have?Not sure.Twenty or so maybe.And how many in Infinity?They wont be expecting us, I replied, a little weakly.Jimmy got this look about him like he was wondering how best to go about patronizing me, but I shut him up by asking if he could find out how to cut off Infinitys powersomewhere away from the actual building.I just wanted to get it over with in case Lenas time was even more limited than we thoughtnot that I could push Ray anymore; in fact, I was worried that when he stopped and thought about it, he might just change his mind about the whole thing.I gotta talk to Gigi, I told Gordie.He shrugged.I dont know any more than you.She wont say where she lives.I thought for a moment.Then I guess I gotta get her to come to me.The state of the City, it shouldntve been that much of a surprise, but it took me forever to find a store with any spray paints.And for sure it didnt help that every step I made was dogged by pain.I had no broken bones, but a whole bouquet of bruises, and my head felt like a boiled egg that had had the top sliced off.That damn wheelchair, I tell ya, it was a one man armored vehicleand not something I wanted to face again.I went up to the Square and sprayed a message at the same place where Gigi used to leave them for me.It wasnt quite as artistic, but it got the point across.THE BLIND WANT TO SEE  On my way back, I sprayed it again, just along the street from where Id first confronted her, then I returned to the shelter, my body still aching and telling me it needed to rest.Presently Jimmy came to see me, mini screen in hand.Theres a substation just along the beach.Great.But What?Cant find out anything about their generator.Nothing.Whether thats deliberate or not, I dont know.Maybe they dont wanna advertise a weakness?Mm.Maybe, he replied, doubtfully.Even if they have to go to emergency lighting, itll be something.He gave a slightly begrudging nod.So whaddya want me to do?I hadnt wanted to push himin fact, I hadnt been planning on saying anything at all, but I shouldve known hed want to get involved.I hesitated for a moment, but he was way ahead of me.I could blow it, he said, plainly referring to the substation.Me and Gordie, Hanna too, if she wants.She will, I told him.I dont think Liles up to it.What dyou reckon they got on the gate?He sighed.Scanners.After that, could be anything.What are they looking for?Weapons, explosive materials, hidden life formsall sorts of stuff.There dont seem to be many guards.Yeah, he agreed, which is kind of worrying in itself.I admit, I shared his concern.I needed to know more, much more, which was why I had to speak to Gigi.She appeared that night, a few moments after everyone had zipped up, sneaking in and damn near frightening us all to death.I wasnt sure what shed have to say, or if I wanted the others to hear, so I took her outside, Gordie trailing on behind us.Whats up?she asked.You know people on the inside, right?Immediately she went on the defensive.Well...kind of.Will they help us get in there?No!she replied, scoffing at the idea.Why not?Too damn scared.I paused for a moment, not feeling comfortable about it but knowing I had to tell her.Theres a gang of us going in there, but we need help.Jeez!she groaned, like we were crazy to even consider it.You just dont get it, do you?Infinitys like, you know, a dictatorship.Everyones paranoid.The enemy they fear most is the one within.Theyre watching each other day and night.No one trusts anyone.The only person who aint watched is Nora Jaggershes head of security and the meanest all powerful bitch youre ever likely to come across.Its her rule that no one knows their roster from one day to the nextnot what theyre doing, when or who with.Even if you could persuade anyone to helpand thats one helluvan ifthey wouldnt know if they were going to be in a position to or not.I went quiet for a moment.Id been really counting on thisin fact, I couldnt see Ray going without it.Could they at least give us information about what we might come up against?An internal breakdown?Whats on the gate?Gigi shrugged.Maybe.I gotta get a message to them.I mean, they want to, course they do, but...She shook her head, as if no other words were necessary.Dyou know anything about the generators?Again she shook her head, now looking that bit embarrassed.Ill try and find out.Lenas pregnant!Gordie suddenly blurted out, I guess wanting to be the first to deliver the killer news.What?Gigi cried, her voice filled with such astonishment, such disbelief, I was a little put out.You gotta problem with that?No!I just What?Hey, you gonna jump down someones throat, take your big boots off, she said aggressively, reminding me she was an Island kid.I just dont see whats so amazing.She paused for a moment like she didnt know whether to go on with the subject or not.How many babies you seen on the Mainland?I stared into her grimy little pixie like face, immediately getting a really bad feeling....none She never commented, just waited for the information to percolate on down inside me.Where are they?I eventually asked.I dunno.Again there was silence, I had another question but it was a while before I could ask it.Is that why they took her?Gigi sighed.Could be.I thought Id felt bad before, but that made me feel a whole lot worse.I mean, was that really what this was all about: the babys organs?That something about Lena being its mother meant each and every spare part would be worth a fortune?Whether the subject just got too uncomfortable for her or what, I didnt know, but Gigi suddenly announced she had to go.The last thing she said as she hurried away was to think long and hard before going into Infinitythat there were good reasons no one else had ever attempted it.And of course she was rightand yet, after what wed been discussing, the possibility that my partner and babys bodies would be ransacked, nothing was gonna stop me.Id arranged with Ray to rendezvous at the First Original Sushi Bar.I got there nice and early, feeling I should apologize to Yoshi for whatd happened with the job in case itd caused him any embarrassment, but when I tried to raise the subject he just smiled and waved it away.I thought youd gone, he said, bringing me miso soup.Found a way through the fires.Not yet.You must.You too.Nothis is my home.Where would I go?Back to Japan?I suggested.You can travel in distance, not time, he said.I know nobody.Strange country full of strange people.He looked at me and we both laughed, each aware of what the other was thinking: that nowhere could be more bizarre than this place.A familiar limousine drew up in the street and a look of fear immediately collapsed Yoshis face.Ray!I know.We gotta meeting.He turned and got busy behind the bar, like he didnt want to be seen talking to me, and I took my soup and retired to one of the booths.Moments later, Ray exploded in, followed by his two goons, his swollen legs caged in the tapered superstructure of his wheelchair so that he entered like a launched torpedo.Yoshi went into genial host mode, offering them free drinks, directing them to my table, though I could see he was still concerned Ray might exact revenge for him paying me for the job and not checking itd been done properly.As I expected, Ray had done some research of his own.Theyd even gone down to the Infinity building to take a proper look.He wasnt exactly encouraged by what hed seen, repeatedly cursing Infinity, calling them fucking animals, as if protecting themselves from someone like him was about as low as you could get.What about these people on the inside?he asked.Despite the fact that Id known the question would come and how critical it was, I didnt have my answer off as pat as Id hoped.Yeah, yeah, theyre fine, I said.When the power goes off, theyll make sure everything stays that way.Everything?he asked, a little surprised.Well, most.General stuff or just security?Again I hesitated.As much as they can.Ray sighed, his face starting to redden.Do you have any idea what the fuck youre doing?Yeah!I retorted, theyre good guys.I trust them.Youve met them?he asked.Sure.Ray turned to Van, saying in a barely lowered aside, I must be fucking insane getting involved with this loser.There was a long pause.I knew I was on thin ice and was anxious to change the subject.I need some explosives.What the fuck for?The substation.Just for a moment, I thought that was it: the step too far.His hand actually went to the joystick of his chair.Well teach Infinity whos running this city, I said, attempting a bit of a rallying cry.I admit it was pretty basic stuff, but as I knew all too well, the only other thing guaranteed to motivate Ray apart from money was revenge.He grunted.Nothing would please me more than to settle with those bastards.From there on, it got a little easier.Both of us had ideas on how it should go and we slowly molded them into a workable plan.First we would bust our way in through the gatewhich, Ray agreed, looked a little undermannedthen split into three groups.The main one would be a decoy, that would go to the general office, steal any cash available and later, if for any reason things went badly awry, take hostages.Another group, just two or three sharpshooters, would position themselves overlooking the Specials barracks at the back and prevent anyone coming out.And Van, his sidekick, me and a few others would go to the hospital and grab the mark.And dont think I wont be keeping a close eye on you either, Ray warned.Youre coming?I said, much surprised.You think Im just going to let you waltz off with her?NoI thought I still do jobs, he said, reversing his chair a few feet and spinning it around, though he had no need to demonstrate to me what a formidable weapon it could be.After wed worked out our strategy, we went through what equipment wed need.I could hardly believe my ears.They might not have had access to M1 tanks, but it appeared they could get their hands on just about anything elseeven RPGs to bring down the Dragonflies.And something for me too, I told them.I thought you didnt do firearms anymore?Ray commented.For this, Im gonna make an exception, I said, trying to make light of it, though he knew as well as I did why I wanted to be armed.In the end, after wed gorged on Yoshis sushi, not to mention his special sakethough I noticed Ray gave him the cold shoulder, the decision whether to punish, punishment in itselfwe made our way back out onto the street.Ill be in touch, Ray said, driving his wheelchair up the ramp into the limo.Oh fuckyou dont have a cell, do you?I shook my head.Nonpeople, I explained.Okay, same time, same place.Four days.Four!I exclaimed.Theres a lot to organize!Id hate to go in there and find we were too late, I told him.That theyve done what they wanted with this woman and disposed of her.He thought for a moment, then conceded the point.Two fucking days, he said, and motioned for Van to close the door.They swept away in an effortless purr of power and money, leaving me to slowly make my way back to the churchyard.Not that I wouldve accepted a lift even if theyd offeredI mean, we were the strangest of bedfellows: half brothers who couldnt bear each others company, whod mount a whole comic opera on the others grave.He thought he was using me and I knew I was using him, but I had no other choice: for even the faintest possibility of getting Lena back, I wouldve lain down with the Devil and given him a back rub.Into the Fire        FIFTEEN I returned a couple of days later to the First Original, still worried Ray mightve changed his mind, but everything was fine.He had these explosives for methis new stuff that looks like a pack of gum but blows everything sky high, that I hoped Jimmy was familiar with.Everything was arranged for Saturday; hed chosen the weekend cuz he thought thered be fewer people around, which kinda made sense.All in all, there were gonna be twenty seven of us, including me and him, which sounded like quite a formidable team.One thing you could be sure of with Ray; all of them would be seasoned professionals familiar with violence.In fact theyd probably killed many times.We discussed a few of the finer details, me still having to drag him along occasionally when he sounded on the point of balking, rebuilding the blaze with the tried and trusted fuels of greed and revenge.We agreed to rendezvous on Saturday evening at a venue I suggested halfway between the churchyard and Infinity.No way was I gonna give him any clue as to where we were livingwho knew how itd turn out, what repercussions there might be?Friday night I was that on edge I couldnt sleep at all.If only I couldve let Lena know, maybe stretch my arm out across this city and tap on her window, tell her she might be back lying beside me the following night.I think that mustve been the thought I took with me when I finally fell asleep, cuz when I woke the next morning, I was that bit disappointed to find my arms still empty.I lay there for a few moments, my head slowly clearing, praying that really had been my last night alonethen noticed we had a visitor.Gigi mustve sneaked in sometime during the night and again made herself comfortable in Arturos sleeping bag.Dont ask me why, but for a while I just lay there studying her.The flurry of wild hair braided with seagull feathers, the sprinkle of freckles, in that moment she was looking what she was: a child, and with all a childs innocence.That was the thing with Island kids: one moment they were laughing and giggling, appearing almost normal, the next they got this real harsh look about them, like they were a pocket knife and youd just flicked the blade.I sighed to myself, knowing all too well why shed become a temporary object of fascination: I was thinking about Lena and me again, what sort of kid wed have.I wanted it to have her looks and characteritd be cruel if it had anything else.And if it turned out to be a boy, well, maybe hed benefit from a little bit of my strength, though he wasnt gonna be a big guy, not as long as I was around to show him a better way.I took a deep breath, unzipped my sleeping bag and slowly got to my feet.The aches and pains of my beating were still there, but restricting my movements much less.I had to get the fire going for breakfast.You okay, Clancy?Delilah mumbled, as I poked at last nights embers.I glanced over to her and Jimmy in their sleeping bag.Neither of them had their eyes open.Fine.Sorry Im not coming tonight.I gave a little grunt.Not really your kinda thing, and certainly not the sort of company you wanna mix with.Just get her.Bring her home.I smiled to myself.I will, I promised.Slowly, one by one, the others vacated their sleeping bags.Apparently Gigi was there to help Jimmyor more likely Gordieblow up the substation, which was a bit of a worry, cuz Hanna was also part of that team and I just hoped those two could forget their differences for one evening.We spent the day going over and over the plan, making last minute preparations, weeding out any potential unwanted surprises.Jimmy was going to wear his parka and a bandanna Gigi had lent him to cover up his face, which hopefully would mean he wouldnt get read or recorded anywhere.As soon as it got dark, the four of them would be heading off, making their way down to the beach and getting into position to blow the substation at ten on the dot.After thatwell, who knew?It was up to us and Lady Luck.When they set off across the churchyardthree kids and an old guy with a limpI got that self same feeling Id had when Jimmy and Delilah had gone off to demolish the drugs warehouse on the Island; that I was sending people whose rightful place was at home in front of the screen or playing computer games off on a suicide mission.Thank God Delilah was sitting this one outthough it did mean the two of us were left alone for a while, each trying to reassure the other that everything was going to be fine.The conversation rapidly became uncomfortable until it finally withered away to nothing.I set off thirty minutes early, making up some excuse about not being sure about finding my way in the smoke and darkness.By the time I reached the rendezvous point, and despite taking it easy, I was still a good fifteen minutes ahead of schedule.I waited in the shadows, expecting to see several limos approaching, but what turned up was one limo sandwiched between two trucks.I walked up to the limo as the window was sliding down, anticipating Ray, but there were a bunch of guys I didnt know.Behind, one of them said, indicating the following vehicle.As I approached the back of the final truck the door swung open and there, surrounded by a bunch of real hard looking sons of bitches, was Ray, squatting menacingly in his wheelchair.Tell the truth, it gave me a bit of a frightthat thing had obviously been converted into battle mode: the framework extended all the way around, armor cladding bolted on, so he looked like he was encased in his own private shell.Furthermore, he was wearing a helmet with a computer screen visor, night vision glasses and microphone, presumably so he could orchestrate the whole thing.Sure enough, he handed me an earpiece.Put this on.And dont fucking lose it.I did as asked, checking out the rest of the gang; no one met my gaze, no one was saying a word.As we got closer to Infinity I thought it was time to remind Ray hed promised me a weapon.Grudgingly he turned to Vans companion and nodded his head in my direction.The guy handed me a laser, a surprisingly modern one, with a heavy power pack grip, though personally, Ive always preferred good old fashioned bullets.Thanks, I said, just for once happy to be reunited with that reassuring tug on my inside pocket.We stopped a few hundred yards down the street from Infinity and Ray checked the time again.Six minutes, he growled.Immediately the tension inside the truck began to rise, as if wed come under starters orders; everyone was looking all single minded and serious, checking their weapons and kit.You sure you can trust this guy?Ray asked me.With my life, I told him.He grunted like there was no one in the world hed trust with that.Okay, lets go, he said into his microphone.Take it slowly.We didnt go as a convoy.The larger truck headed off first, followed by the limo thirty seconds or so later, and we finally moved off another thirty seconds after that.As we turned into the Infinity entrance, the other two were waiting in line and a couple of Specials were lowering their health masks to talk to the guys in the front truck.I gotta say, Jimmy was every bit as good as his word.Wed synchronized watches before he left and the explosion went off literally to the second.There was a loud kerrumph!over toward the sea and the air flashed and rippled out to the horizon and instantly every light in the Infinity building flickered and dimmed.That was it: the critical moment, the unknown element Id put so much faith into, that Id repeatedly assured Ray would give us the edge.Everything depended on what the emergency generator could and couldnt handleon what Infinity was about to lose.I was hoping for something close to a blackout, panic perhaps, maybe even people deserting their posts, but if I had to choose one moment when I realized our plan was about to go awry, that was it.Some things were extinguished: lights in the main building, spotlights overlooking the lawn, even the gate office was left at the mercy of something close to darkness.At the same time a couple of things came on that werent there before, and one that I instantly knew meant big trouble.Thered been this green neon sign flashing as wed turned in:  WELCOME TO INFINITY PLEASE BE PATIENT WHILE THE SPECIALS ADMIT YOU AND IF NECESSARY SCAN OR SEARCH YOUR VEHICLE  However, with the loss of grid power, another sign, pulsing bright red, instantly appeared in its place:  RED ALERT!BY THE READING OF THIS NOTICE YOU AUTOMATICALLY ACCEPT ANY SECURITY MEASURES TAKEN BY INFINITY AND ABSOLVE THE COMPANY AND ITS ASSOCIATES OF ANY FUTURE LEGAL ACTION  I didnt know exactly what Rays gadgetry was capable ofwhat he was seeing on his visorbut suddenly he looked really alarmed.Shit!Theyre scanning us!No sooner had he said it, and God knows why, the guys in the front truck panicked and started shooting.The two Specials fell to the ground.No!No!What the fuckre you doing?Ray screamed into his microphone.He hesitated for a moment as if not sure whether to go on or not, but when there was no reaction from the office he decided to chance it.Go!he screamed.Go, go!For some reason, the first truckour main one, with most of the guys in itstayed where it was, and the limo was forced to pull out and go around it.We followed immediately, speeding in the direction of the main building with Ray shouting and cursing at everyone.This wasnt the way it was supposed to have gone: blasting our way in, a fire fight threatening at any moment.Infinitys loss of power and the ensuing chaos was supposed to have been our opportunity to take them by surprise.Behind us, the main truck still hadnt moved.Frank, what the fuck are you doing?Ray screamed at the driver.Frank...?What?I cant understand a word youre saying!What?At that moment, and to our utter astonishment, the truck suddenly blew up, spraying fire and wreckage in every direction.Fuck!shouted Ray, yanking off his headset as if hed caught some of it in his ear.What happened?Van asked.I dont know!They got scanned and blown uphe was talking about swelling or something, then they started screaming The limo in front of us suddenly faltered, coughed and bucked, then came to a halt like it had run out of gas.We almost slammed into the back of it.Instantly Ray was screaming again, Go back!Go back!at our driver.And sure enough, we hadnt reversed more than twenty odd yards before the limo also exploded with that same sense of erupting from within: as though pressure had been created inside to a point where everything simply tore apart.A piece of heavy debris, maybe the back axle, hurtled straight at us, smashing through the windshield and killing our driver before he had a chance to move.Oh fuck!Ray wailed.Get out!Van shouted, knowing we were nextthat the scan was locking onto us and the truck was starting to tremble, to creak and strain.The incredible thing was, however it was being generated, it worked on everything: I could feel this pressure, this sense that the space inside my body was starting to fill, the bones of my ribcage expanding, my skull starting to crack.The back door swung open and I made a dive for it, but I wasnt alone.The floor beneath our feet moved, a ramp projected straight out into the air and landed with a crash on the ground and instantly Ray shot forward, knocking people aside.One guy ended up on the pavement, hitting his head with a real thump and lying there out cold, but the others managed to get out safely and started running back in the direction of the gatehowever, a group of Specials burst out of the main building, cutting us off with a wall of laser fire.For the first time in many years I pulled out a gun and started shooting, and I gotta say, these new weapons are something else.They take all the skill out of hitting your target; you dont even have to worry too much about aiming, just point in the general direction and the software does the rest.Mind you, it wouldnt be a lot of use if you wanted to fire a warning shot at someone.I took out three Specials in the same number of seconds and not one of them was actually in my sights.There was this loud report only feet behind meit actually made me jumpand the door from where more Specials had been about to emerge more or less exploded.I turned around and was not in the least bit surprised to see Ray had cannons mounted in the armrests of his chair.That was why that thing was so squat and stable: to combat recoil.He fired again, and this time the foyer of the building took a direct hit.Jesus, perhaps we were going to get out of this after all.But my optimism was hopelessly misplaced: a large group of Specials suddenly came streaming over from the gate, directing more bullets and lasers our way, and I realized why the gate always looked undermanned: there had to be a tunnel from there to the main building.One of our guys went to the ground, another, right next to me, got just about cut in two.Shit!Van groaned.I thought it was cuz he realized we were cut off, that we were on the losing side of things, but then he went down too, that big muscular frame of his as vulnerable as any to a bullet or laser.He mustve got off five or six rounds before his face finally collided with the ground and he stopped moving.You fuck!You fucker!Ray screamed.I turned, thinking he was angry at the enemy, at how theyd just slain his number one man, but it was me he was so furious with.I shouldve known!Anything to do with you, you fucking loser!Thankfully, I saw the way he was maneuvering his wheelchair to line up the armrests and dived to one side, scrambling away on my hands and knees as two missiles whooshed inches over my head and across the lawn, ending up blowing a hole in the fence.Another of our guys got cut down and as far as I could see, there were now only three of us left.Ray decided hed had enough, ramming his joystick forward and shooting off toward the breach in the fence, the one other guy left running hell for leather after him.No!I called after them, knowing all too well what was about to happen.Sure enough, Infinity mightve only been on emergency power, but they mustve decided long ago that under such circumstances, the growlers would take priority, cuz once again those mounds began to rise up out of the ground and silver shapes appeared out of the smoky darkness, moving at incredible speed as they went racing toward the intruders.Even from where I was, and with the spotlights out, I could sense Rays shock.His chair wobbled for a moment as if he was about to overbalance, but to his credit, he held it together and kept going, weaving from side to side, blasting his cannon.He took out a couple of them, leaving nothing but strewn piles of flaky junk, but the guy running after him wasnt so lucky.It hadnt really occurred to me til then that the guy was Vans sidekick, but I wasnt altogether surprised; hed always had that look about him, that hed find a way of surviving, of sneaking away while others did all the dirty work or dying.Mind you, he had it all wrong this time.He was frantically following in Rays wake, doing his best not to get isolated, leaping over the occasional growler wreckage, firing his laser indiscriminately, and it was probably that, a programmed response to any threat, that provoked several of those pursuing Ray to turn on him instead.He managed to shoot one of them, dodged his way around another, but the damn thing just turned on a dime and sped after him like a heat seeking missile, all the while making that eerie howling and growling sound.Theres nothing very scientific about it once they get to you: they just rip you to pieces, as simple as that.The pursuing growler was alongside him in seconds, snarling and snapping, then it just leapt at him and with one crunch from those huge metallic jaws took off his leg just above the knee.Jesus, I never seen anything like itnor do I want to, not ever again.The guy thudded to the ground, screaming at the top of his voice, and several other growlers were on him at once, sinking their teeth into every part of his body, wrenching with those massive jaws, tearing him limb from limb, stripping him bare, reducing him to nothing but a scattering of finely chopped blood and bone.A couple of Infinity bullets thudded into the ground beside me, a laser actually singed my parka and I realized I was completely cut off, that I had no other choice but to run the gauntlet myself.I set off toward the hole in the fence as fast as this old hulk of a body could carry me, praying the growlers were sufficiently distracted by dismembering the guy and their pursuit of Ray to worry about me.Rayd just about made it to the fence, in fact, I thought hed gone through, that hed escaped, but as I got closer, I saw hed checked, that he was spinning around, lining up those cannons again.He hit a couple of growlers, but they were immediately replaced by others and soon I saw the flash of a laser and realized hed pulled out his hand weapon and was firing that as well.I blundered past what remained of Vans sidekick, praying I wouldnt attract the attention of the growlers, but two of them immediately broke away and started to give chase.Jesus, they were fast!I tell ya, it was like having an express train after you.One of Rays pocket missiles swept by only feet awayI didnt know whether he was trying to hit the growlers or me.I couldnt understand why he hadnt kept going when hed reached the fencesurely he hadnt stayed to save me?Up ahead, I could see him clearer now, maneuvering his chair left and right, lining himself up for another shot.I turned around and blasted one of the two pursuing growlers, blowing its head right off.It stopped dead, there in the middle of the lawn, one foot raised, like some bizarre sculpture.I also managed to shoot a leg off the other one, but you know, Jimmy was right: it just checked for a moment as if reprogramming itself, then continued after me on three limbs.Worse still, behind it, I could see more of the group that had obliterated Vans sidekick leave his remains and join the chase.The three legged growler was rapidly gaining.I took another shot at it, and again, desperately trying to keep it at bay...and thenJesus, I almost screamed out in fear!my laser died on me.Even in that moment, I knew why: Ray had given me a laser with an almost empty power pack so that, when the operation was over and the time came, itd be that much easier to kill me.Instantly my three legged pursuer lengthened its pneumatic stride and was at my side.I tried to kick the damn thing, but it dodged me with ease; I made what I thought was a sudden swerve, but it barely hesitated.What the hell could I do?Its huge jaws started to open in a deathly smile revealing four rows of fearsome teethand yet when it went to bite me, to tear into one of my legs, its mouth wouldnt open enough and it just kind of nudged me.It tried again, but with the same result.Obviously there was a malfunction somewheremaybe itd been damaged by laser fire?Whatever the explanation, I couldnt tell you how grateful I was for the occasional frailties of technology.Despite the growler still occasionally digging at my leg, I finally managed to reach the fence as a little wild laser fire resumed from the main building, I guessed cuz they couldnt see that well and didnt want to take any chances.Ray was reversing back and forth, the wheelchairs engine screaming, and finally I realized whatd happened.He hadnt been covering my retreat; the wires from the broken fence had got tangled up in his wheels.Dont ask me why, but I went to free him.Fuck off!he shouted.Im trying to help!I guess he saw it was true cuz he shut up, but he was clearly still as mad as hell at me.I wrenched at the wire, twisting it this way and that and doing my best to tug it free, but all his to ing and fro ing had really got it tangled.Come on!he screamed, peering over my shoulder.I glanced behind me to see half a dozen or more growlers bearing down upon us, all gnashing and snarling, obviously having nothing wrong with their jaws.I turned back to Ray and out of sheer desperation tried to lift him out of the chair.You cant!he cried, not with the armor!Im bolted in!You think about those moments, what youd do in that position, but you never know til it happens.I stared into his horror stricken face, my half brother, partially my own flesh and blood, knowing he was about to die either alone or accompanied by me, and turned and ran through the fence toward the bushes at the far side of the road.I had tried to save his life, but if I thought that counted for anything, I was wrong, cuz I suddenly felt this real thud in my right buttock, like someone had kicked me as hard as they could, and I knew hed shot me: that his last action in life had been to try to kill me.I fell to the ground but I guess he mustve known I wasnt dead cuz he kept on firing, and yet within seconds all that pneumatic clank clank, the growling and howling, converged behind me and there followed the kinda high pitched scream I would never have associated with Ray.They were all over him, tearing at his body in a frenzy of flashing teeth and snapping jaws.I tried to struggle up, knowing Id be next, but I was in too much pain to do more than wriggle a few inches, then an inch or two more, the noises behind methe crunching of bones, the ripping of fleshspurring me on.Yet suddenly I heard a noise unlike any Id ever heard before: it was like a giant balloon popping underwater, or a hugely overweight jumper smacking against the sidewalk.I knew immediately what it was: the growlers had bitten through those swollen legs of Rays and the damn things had exploded.I drove myself forward another few inches, pivoting on my elbows, straining with every muscle, but it was hopeless, as soon as theyd finished with Ray theyd be over for me.Again I glanced over my shoulder.Jesus, youve never seen so much bloodthe whole surrounding area was awash with the stuff, and it was dripping off everything.The growlers had ripped through the armor as easily as they had Rays body and now, their job done, were just standing there and scanning for any other threats to their masters.As one they turned and moved toward me with that familiar slurping pneumatic clank and a renewed chorus of howling, and I scrambled and scratched at the ground, my fingers bleeding, trying to will my damaged body away.It was the weirdest thing: all of them, a pack of maybe fifteen to twenty, stopped dead the moment they had to cross the fallen fence.They were just standing there, motionless and silent.Had they lost power or something, maybe used up all their emergency reserve?They were facing in my direction, but I couldnt make out if they were still functioning or not.After a few agonizingly long seconds, as one they just turned around and clanked back in the direction of their burrows.What the hell...?What happened?And finally it hit me: they were only programmed for the complex, nothing outside, their world ended with the fence.Over on the concourse, the Specials stopped firing.I wasnt sure how much theyd seen, but presumably the growlers returning to their lairs had put their minds at restthough they were bound to send someone out through the gate to check.Before they did, I had to somehow make it to the far side of the road and hide myself.I dont know how long it tooktwenty minutes or so, maybebut Id just about managed to roll into the long grass and squirm my way up against a bush when a party of Specials drew up.They didnt stay long; just did some makeshift repairs to the fence, called maintenance and ordered them to fix it properly in the morning.No one bothered to search for me.I didnt get itthey mustve seen me running across the grassbut finally I came to the conclusion that it was Ray: the way his body had exploded, going all over the place like that, they mustve assumed it was the remains of two people, not one, that the growlers had got us both.Jeez, and how was that for revenge?I wonder how that venomous old bastard would feel knowing that his last action on this Earth hadnt been to end my life but to save it.Quite a lot of joking went on: comments about what messy eaters growlers were.Someone got a big laugh after looking at what remained of Ray and his armored wheelchair and quipping that growlers didnt normally like canned food.Soon they jumped back into their vehicle and returned into the complex, leaving me all alone and utterly at a loss.What the hell was I going to do?Jimmy and the gang wouldnt have the slightest idea where I was or whatd happened.If Infinity showed any footage of the attackand that was a big if, bearing in mind they wouldnt want to admit to their actual headquarters being attackedthey were bound to make a thing of having killed everyone, and in that case, there was every chance Id never be found, that I was going to die out there of exposure or starvation.That immediately sent my thoughts winging across the grass to the Infinity building.How close were we, exactly?Had she heard us?Maybe shed asked someone what was going on and theyd told her Infinity were under attack from terrorists or something...Lena, I groaned, dont you believe them...I came to rescue you!Jesus, it was humiliating: helplessly lying in the grass with a laser wound to my ass.If I couldve found a branch or something, maybe I mightve been able to use it as a crutch and get movingbut I couldnt see a thing in that smoke curdled darkness and I certainly wasnt up to wandering around searching.Again my eyes went to the Infinity building.Forget the risk, I couldnt help myself, it just came bursting out: Lena!I moaned, L e n a!I dont know when I passed out exactly, nor for how long, but at some point the sound of hushed voices somewhere nearby woke me.Jeez, I shouldnt have called out like that.Or maybe theyd been studying random camera footage and seen me crawl into the bushes?I heard the thud of nearby footsteps: someone misjudging the terrain in the dark and almost falling, and tried to shrink further under the bush.There were several of them, that much I could make out, whispering to each other, searching around, getting ever closer.I thanked God they didnt have flashlights, though I knew it could only be a matter of time.Definitely someone made it out, I heard a voice say, maybe finding a few drops of my blood in the grass.You sure?came a female voice.Theyre wounded.There was silence for a few moments, then one of them started slowly heading my way, tracking from side to side, maybe picking up on more blood.Those things are so fast, the female voice whispered.And hes not, the first voice commented.I turned my head, trying to hear clearer.Were they talking about me?Not at his age, the first voice added.Wait a minute: I knew that voice.Jimmy!I whispered.There was an immediate silence.Obviously Id frightened the hell out of them.Jimmy!I called again.Finally he got up the nerve to answer.Big Guy?Over here!I whispered.They started to make their way over, hesitantly, like they were a little scared of what they might find.It was Gordie and Gigi who found me and they called to Jimmy, the little guy hastily pegging it over.Big Guy!You okay?About as okay as a man whos been shot in the ass can be, I grumbled.Just get me up, will ya?With considerable difficulty, all four of them hauled me to my feet, having to pause once they got me there for my pain to subside.Okay, lets go, I eventually said.With Gigi and Gordie taking one arm and Jimmy and Hanna the other, we slowly skulked away from the darkened quasi military monolith of Infinity.What the hell happened?Jimmy asked when wed eventually got into some kind of rhythm.Infinity did.That place is a super fortress.You need a damn army to get in there.Im the only one to make it out Shit!Jimmy exclaimed.Did you see the growlers?Gigi asked.Yeahand what theyre capable of.Grab them by the front legs and pull them apart, Gordie advised, giving a quick demonstration.Hanna laughed like she couldnt believe how stupid he was and he flushed and told her to shut up.You shut up, she replied.Okay, okay!I said, wondering what had happened for their differences to have reached that level.I told them the whole story, not just as a way to smooth things over and let tempers die down, but also cuz I thought they should know how easily Infinity had dealt with us; the way our vehicles had been blown up, whatd happened to Ray, and, of course, if it even needed saying, the fact that I hadnt got anywhere near the hospital wing and Lena.Shell know it was you, Hanna reassured me.I turned and tried to give her a hug but ended up squeezing Jimmy as well.You think?course!Jimmy nodded his agreement.Yeah, shell know.I almost managed a smile, only then noticing the little guyd lost his parka and bandanna.Wheres your disguise?I asked.He shrugged, looking a little reluctant to tell me, and I caught Gigi and Gordie smirking at each other.That Ray, he said dismissively.For chrissake!Whatd he give you all that explosive for?I paused for a moment.You used too much?Just what I was given.By now Gigi and Gordie were openly giggling, and if it hadnt been them shed have had to have sided with, I reckon Hanna wouldve done the same.You blew your clothes off?I asked.Not all of them!he protested.And his eyebrows, Gordie chipped in.Its cool, Jimmy protested, running his fingertips along his singed brows.Matches my head.Next youre gonna tell me you did it deliberately I commented.To be honest, I was more than glad of the distraction: Jimmy being Jimmy, the kids giggling and teasing, even Hanna and Gordie having their little spat, cuz believe me, I was feeling pretty sorry for myself.Big guys get shot in the arm or shoulder, occasionally even the chest, not the ass.Several more times on the way back I had to get them to prop me for a few moments till the pain subsided.And the situation wasnt helped by something of a competition developing between the two pairs: Gordie and Gigi making out I was no weight at all, while Hanna and Jimmy were so intent on proving they were well up to the task that a couple of times I had to ask them to let me down their side a little.But of course that wasnt the real reason I needed a distraction.It was returning from Infinity empty handed.Id been so hopeful, so buoyed up by the thought of having Lena back with me, but now, at least for the foreseeable future, the two of us were just going to have to get used to the idea of being apart.Into the Fire        SIXTEEN I used to suffer from insomnia regularly before I met Lena.Out on the Island, not knowing who might come for you in the middle of the night, are you surprised?When I started sleeping with her, it appeared to go away, but insomnias all about establishing a pattern.Even then, if my sleep got disturbed a couple of times, my body clock assumed that was when it was meant to wake upevery night.And, of course, after Lena got kidnapped, my sleeping routine was burned to hell.One of the things about insomnia is, you might not get that many opportunities to dream, but when you do, your mind goes a little crazy trying to catch up.Its like three speeded up movies playing at the same time.I dreamed about Lena, of course, which wasnt exactly a surprise.Shed had our baby, a boy, and maybe cuz I was concerned at how long itd be before I saw her again, he mustve been twelve or thirteen, but a real monster, a Wastelord in the making.He killed Hanna.The church was still intact and I walked down the steps of the crypt to find her face down with a machete in her back, blood seeping out and filling the inscription of the gravestone she was lying on.She had her ballet gear on, tutu and shoes, as if shed dressed for the occasion.Worse still, when I turned her over, I could see hed slashed her right down the front and taken all her organs.Lena wanted me to protect him, to say nothing to nobody, but I wasnt having any of it.I got so angry with herangrier than I ever couldve imagined.At one point I actually accused her of having sex with someone elseI mean, no son of mine could behave like that, surely?In the end, I told her to choose between me and him, and you know, she never even hesitated.The last I saw, the two of them were disappearing into the smoke over by the gate.I awoke with a jolt, the images dissipating like mischievous genies returning to the bottle.After everything that had happened at Infinity, I was so tired I never imagined Id have any problems sleeping.On the other hand, bearing in mind the things Id seen, I guess it wasnt that much of a surprise.I turned over, seeking a more comfortable position, but it wasnt sleep I craved as much as oblivion.What on earth had I been thinking, trying to get into Infinity that way?All wed done was to confirm what Id already suspected: that that place was a fortress and there was no way in there, certainly not by force.A little later, after managing another fitful hour or so, I awoke feeling even more negative, and sure as hell it didnt help that Id taken that laser burn to the ass either.It had to be looked at, cleaned and dressed; course, if Lena had been there it wouldnt have been a problem, but it was well into the afternoon before I finally gave in to everyones nagging and, dismissing Jimmys sniggering offer, asked Delilah to take a look.Thankfully, it wasnt as bad as Id feared, not according to her, anyway.Though she sure didnt help matters by making all these comments about, if it had been a little more central and down a touchas if I hadnt been embarrassed enough already.She reckoned it would take a while to heal, even with the organi plasters.For sure I wouldnt be doing a great deal of sitting in the near future, but I guess I got off quite lightly, physically, that is.Mentally and emotionally, I couldnt have felt worse: I didnt only get my ass lasered, I got it kicked good and proper.Naturally, everyone came up with all sorts of alternative ways of rescuing Lena: parachuting in, checking if there were any old tunnels under the building, jamming the growlers frequencies.Gigi even said shed do what she could to find out how many there were inside Infinity prepared to help.But it was just talk, and we all knew it: a futile attempt at getting our morale back up, though actually, as the suggestions became more and more desperate, it did quite the reverse.We didnt watch the screen that oftenJimmy had a solar boost for the battery so it wasnt lack of power, nor that he was constantly playing with it, trying to make it do things it wasnt intended for.It was more that it was their world and we didnt want any part of it.But after a couple of days of lying on my side, restless, bored and uncomfortable, I asked the little guy if I could watch it for a while.I turned it on, glancing at the image and getting the shock of my life.With everything else thatd been going on, I hadnt really given it a thought, but sure as hell I shouldve.Ah, shit!I groaned What?Jimmy asked, shuffling over to take a look.Gordie and Hanna did too, though Delilah hesitated, like she didnt want to know, only finally joining us when she saw how pale Jimmy went, the expression on his face.It was him againon the screen.The big difference was that now they not only had pictures of him with his shaved head, but also his name, or at least the same misspelling of his name as on the commercial data bank: Jimy.I knew this would happen, he moaned as they showed endless footage of him from the night of the raid and from the point that he got his disguise blown off.Hey, look!Thats me!Gordie cried proudly, as an enlarged image of the four of them was shown.And Gigi!Hanna pointedly raised her eyes and shook her head, as if hed reached new depths of dorkdom.I just dont understand where they got your name, Delilah complained.And spelled that way, too.Looks like a game name, Hanna commented.What do you mean?When you play a computer gamemost people use a nickname, or a shortened version of their own.He hasnt played a game in thirteen years, Delilah said dismissively.And that was it, that was when it finally hit me: Hanna had seen what I shouldve long ago.I turned to Jimmy.He had this look on his face like hed just stepped into something left by a very large dog.Whats the matter?Delilah asked.Dont tell me I said accusingly.What is it?Delilah croaked again as I glared at the little guy, waiting for him to explain.However, he didnt need to, cuz the next thing they showed was the video image from the game hed played at the secret arcade, complete with screen information: Highest ever score and grand champion: Jimy.You put that in?I cried, barely believing what I was seeing.It was a good score, he replied weakly.Jesus, Jimmy!I groaned.Even I wouldnt do that!Thats how the screens started to read you.You dont say!he commented, like I was being annoyingly obvious.Nor was that the end of our bad newsa world from it.As always, they interviewed a spokesperson from Infinity, the journalist teasing out answers that had obviously been well rehearsed.Normally it was this no nonsense career cop type, reassuring the general public that everything was under control, but this time it was someone elsesomeone who I immediately sensed we had to respect, maybe even be that bit afraid of, as if Infinity had finally brought out their champion, the worst they could possibly do.I wasnt the least bit surprised to see the name Nora Jagger come up on the screen.Gigid mentioned her before: Head of Security at Infinity, and the way things were, maybe the most powerful person in the organization.I gotta say, I was that bit transfixed.I never seen anyone look so damn mean, so lacking in human qualities.She had very close cropped blond hair, blue eyes that pierced through you even outta the screen, and a face thatd bring down Rushmore.Mind you, the personnel mightve been different, but the message was still the same: all she could talk about was Jimy and how he was the biggest ever threat to our society.She went on to announce that Infinity was both doubling the reward for his demise and removing all restrictions on firearms.Something about the determined way she said it made you think that this was her initiative, her way of settling things, and that she thought it wouldnt take long to get results.Shit, I muttered as the interview came to an end, as much concerned by the messenger as I was the news.Jimmy!Delilah wailed in despair.The thing about the little guy is, he never makes mistakes, or not as far as hes concerned, and on the rare occasion that he does, he always manages to wriggle out of it, to put the blame on someone or something else.But this time, there was no way out.For a few moments he just stood there like an animal waiting to be tethered to an unbearably heavy load.Sorry, guys, he eventually whispered, turning toward the shelter entrance.Not cool.Hey!Delilah called after him.Lile, he cried, I screwed up!Where you going?I dont knowto get some food or water.Maybe I can manage that without endangering everyones lives.You cant go out there, I told him, worried he was so upset he wasnt thinking straight.Its hunting season and youre what everyones got tattooed on their sights.Well, you cant, he said, reminding me of my injury.Ill go, Delilah said.Lile!Jimmy protested.Listen, mister, you take one more step and itll be your last!she warned, working herself up into one of her highly volatile states.No matter how bad he was feeling, the little guy still knew enough not to go up against her.He paused for a moment, then turned and slunk away in the opposite direction, following the wall down til he disappeared from sight.He is such a fool, Delilah commented.It was a great score, Gordie commented, as if that made it more understandable.Actually, it didnt change things that much.Jimmy barely went out anyway, and never without a disguise.
