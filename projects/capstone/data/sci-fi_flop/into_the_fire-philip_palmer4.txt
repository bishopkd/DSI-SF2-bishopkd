I whispered.Kind of, she said.Not clearly.Youre very blurry.Well, thats for the best, I told her, not altogether joking.But I can make things out.Shapes...people, she said, her excitement threatening to bubble over.Thatll improve, Dr.Simon assured her.Quite quickly.I mightve been a bit sparing with the pleasantries when I first arrived, my mind elsewhere, but I tell you, not then.I thanked that man from the bottom of my heart.I mean, he might see it as a fairly standard operation, but as far as we were concerned, it was a damn miracle.Just one thing, Clancy, he told me.Id like to keep her here.I turned to him, a little surprised.Sorry?The first seventy two hours, she really should be under observation.You told me shed be able to come with me.I said I hoped...Best not take chances.I looked to Lena.I know it was crazy, but I just couldnt bear the thought of having to spend another night without her.Im coming with you, she said, swinging her legs around to get out of bed.Lena!Please!Dr.Simon protested.Just for a couple of days.Its funny, for both of us her sight was the most important thing in the world, but being together suddenly seemed almost to rival it.Im going with Clancy, she told him.Lena!he repeated, sounding just that bit angry.Really.Ive got to insist.Sorry, she replied.The image of her searching for her clothes, actually trying to find something by looking, almost stopped me in my tracks.Were we being foolish?Shouldnt we take every precaution?Maybe...Im coming with you!she insisted.I can manage.Well, I cant.Where are my clothes?she asked Dr.Simon.In the end, and despite how unhappy he was about it, she got her way.He did ask where we were living, just in case anything went wrong, but Lena refused to answerit was only when I faithfully promised that, no matter what, Id bring her back on Friday to check everything was okay, that he finally let her go.I think we both felt kind of guilty as we were leaving, a bit like rebellious teenagers.That man changed our world; hed been so generous, but he couldnt understand how much we wanted to be together, to explore the gift hed bestowed.The whole way back to the churchyard was spent kind of stumbling in wonder; stopping every now and then, letting her take things in, listening to her almost childlike cries of joy.I mean, it had been more than four years.When we finally descended the steps into the crypt everyone went crazy.She took them outside into the daylight, so she could get as clear a view as possible: standing in front of them one by one, looking them up and down, so thrilled to finally put faces to voices.Arturo insisted on showing her his transfer, rolling his sleeve up as far as it could go so she got the full effect, moving his arm and giggling when Mickey Mouse moved with it.Lenas delight, her excitement, were utterly infectious.You never heard such a lot of whooping and laughter and helpless crying.course we celebrated; using up the last of the food, knowing wed have to get more the following day, that it was probably going to be even more difficult.But do you know something?In that moment, we didnt really care.Delilah took the opportunity to sing; none of her usual chilly blues stuff, more gospel, praising the Lord, praising every possible entity who mightve assisted in any way in restoring Lenas sight.And though I couldnt help but deliver the odd note of caution, reminding them that we couldnt be certain her sight would improve, that we shouldnt forget the possibility of rejection, I think I was saying it more for my benefit than theirs.The kids joined Delilah in singing, even Gordie, without the slightest hint of a sneer or protest, and all of us ended up dancing around the crypt in our own individual manner (which for me is a kind of internal thing that you might not even notice too much from the outside).As ever, Delilah had her arms around Arturo, the Mickey Mouse Kid, teaching him how to waltz as if he was to be her partner at the summer ball.She loved him more than if shed had one of her own.For sure, Jimmy was convinced she loved him more than him.Sometimes he got a little jealous, asking her stupid questions like which one of them shed save in a fire.Mind you, I gotta say, she never gave him an answer.Later that night, as quietly as humanly possible, Lena and me made love in our sleeping bag, keeping every movement so gentle and slow, our breathing shallow, stifling our moans.I dont know why, but for some reason the silence makes it even more intense, as if the discipline of keeping quiet, of not being able to let our passion fully go, mingled a little pain with the pleasure.Afterward, we lay there silently cuddling, feeling a little naughty, wondering if the others had heard and were just indulging us.Its the same, Lena whispered.What?The crypt.I cant see any more than before.Cant see that much myself, I told her.Give it a few days and youll see a damn sight better than me.She never bothered to reply, just grunted, maybe cuz she caught the slight tone in my voice, cuz she feared which direction those words would take us in.As much as I hated myself, and I truly did, I knew itd have to come out at some point.I went silent for a little while, pretending disinterest, though, in fact, I was frantically wrestling with this madman, trying to shove him back into his room and lock the door.So was it a shock?I eventually asked.She paused for a moment, knowing all too well what I was talking about.It was the nicest thing my eyes have ever seen.Really?Yes.I forced a bit of a chuckle.Find that a little hard to believe.Ive run my hands over this body a thousand times, she said, with the first hint of impatience.Feel sorry for you, I said, knowing even before the words were out that it was a step too far, that Id crossed the line.There was one of those expectant kind of moments, like the world had shifted on its axis and something profound was about to happen, then her fist slammed into my stomach, air literally exploding out of me.Jesus!I gasped.Goodnight, Clancy, she said, turning over as if shed just given me the fondest of pecks on the cheek.Lena!I protested.And thank you for spoiling such a special moment.I gotta say, that hurt me even more than her punch.Mainly cuz it was true, cuz Id pushed her into that, knowing it would make me feel better.Youre right.Im sorry, I said, putting my arm around her.Never again, Clancy, she warned, shrugging me off.Never again!Sometime in the night she mustve forgiven me, cuz I woke with her nestled in my arms.Mind you, that wasnt what disturbed my sleep; it was feeling how tense and concentrated she was, like the prey sensing the approach of the hunter.Whats the matter?I asked.Cant you hear?I guess I hadnt been fully awake cuz when I really listened I could hear the same noise as the other night: this kind of rhythmic beating, an echoing clatter, and as it began to grow, the yelling and shouting too.What the hell is that?I said, more confused than actually asking the question.And suddenly Lena was panicking, scrambling frantically at the zip on the sleeping bag, desperate to get out.Whats the matter?I asked.Its coming this way!I listened again.At first I couldnt hear any difference.It sounded more or less stationary to me.However, after a few moments I began to think she might be right: it was growing in volumeand yes, it was coming our way.Jimmy!I shouted, struggling up.Kids!What is it?Jimmy asked, immediately going quiet, realizing what was going on.Oh Jeez!I stumbled across to the steps.Lena was already up to the entrance and I followed on behind.Just as before, the noise was a lot louder outside: Boom Boom Boom!Boom Boom Boom!Not to mention those cries scything through the night like the raw emotions of creation.Jimmy, Delilah and the kids followed us up and all of us just stood there, gaping out into the huge smoky darkness.What is it?Arturo cried, looking from face to face, as if at least one of us grown ups should know.Whatever it was, Lena was right, it was coming our way.Through the smoke, I could just make out the shapes of people running past in the street, heading in the opposite direction, doing everything they could to get away.A guy stumbled into the churchyard, looking for a hiding place and almost immediately decided it wasnt safe, that he was better off running, which was kinda ominous.I made my way over to the street, ignoring Lenas shouted warning, thinking that even in this visibility I might get some idea what was coming our way.More and more people came scurrying past.Some were kids, younger than any Id seen on the Mainland up til that pointwhere the hell did they come from?An old couple dashed past, the man coughing from the smoke, and I was pretty sure they were Islanders so I called out, asked them what was going on, but they just kept running.Whatever was scaring them, it wasnt that far away.It sounded like the beating of a thousand different drums, a hundred different surfaces, the mass crying of countless angry emotions.I also realized there was a glow beginning to color the night, not of fire, but lights.I promptly turned and ran back to the church.Whatever was coming, it was going to roll right over us.Go back down!I shouted.Delilah and the kids didnt need a second bidding, Jimmy followed them down, wailing to himself, convinced it had something to do with him.But Lena hesitated, trying to get her eyes working, squinting through the smoke.Can you see?I asked her.Something, she told me, repeatedly blinking.Maybe we should make a run for it?Its too late, I told her.We went down after the others and I dragged the old gravestone that had been used to disguise the entrance when we first arrived back into place.The only thing was, it left us in complete darkness; our wind up camping lights had run down as usual and hadnt been rewound.Moment by moment, time slither by time slither, the sound and that heavy vibration grew.It was starting to take form now: there were vehicles amongst it, heavy ones, by the sound of it.I could hear the straining of an engine being asked to do a difficult task, another one joining in, revving, roaring, then a loud crash.That was something going overa wall or a building.Jeez, maybe Lena had been right, we shouldve made a run for it.The pounding was getting ever nearer, and that war cry of a chorus, and then we heard the wall tumble over at the far end of the churchyard.We huddled together for strength in the darkness, fearing the church walls, maybe even the ceiling, were about to come crashing in on us.Delilah started to weep, sparking off little Arturo.Gordie told them to shush, but they were only silenced by the screaming of an engine, growing louder and louder, til we realized something monsterous was right overhead, lurching this way and that, colliding with everything in front of it, til finally something big mustve given way.The impact on the stone floor above us was like the deep throated shuddering of an avalanche.Shit!I gasped, convinced we were about to be buried alive.The yelling and shouting came next, and more drumming, and for the first time I realized that whoever was doing it wasnt only beating something they were carrying but also everything they passed, as if they were marking their territory, hitting everything before them: buildings, walls, trash cans, posts, anything that would resonate to their threat.It crashed over us like syncopated thunder while we waited helplessly below.Lena buried her face in my chest, hugging me with all her strength, as if determined to crush us into one before that last moment came.All of us were waiting for the crack, the first specks of dust that would tell us the floor was about to give wayand yet slowly, so slowly that at first I couldnt be sure, the noise started to recede.Whatever it was was moving on into the night.I waited til I was sure whatever it was had moved on, then fumbled my way up the steps, forced the gravestone off the entrance and peered out.There wasnt a lot left of the church, just a few stumps of wall, the rest piles of rubble.Jeez, wed been lucky: bricks and stones had fallen almost everywhere but on top of the entrance.Just a few more inches our way and we wouldve been buried under several tons of rubble, and the crypt wouldve played host to more lifeless bodies.I scuttled across a pile of broken stones, keeping as low as I could, anxious to see who our visitors had been.No prizes for guessing: there were hundreds of Infinity Specials, all in a line stretching from this side of the street to the other, every one equipped with riot gear and beating their shields and anything else they came across, shouting at the tops of their voices.They were so loud they could be heard above the massive earth moving equipment in front of them.Overhead, spotlights blazing, were a couple of Dragonflies.I tell ya, it was a full blown army.Through the smoke, I could just make out the silhouettes of those fleeing before them.It was like they were being herded, driven like sheep.Infinity were forcing them out of the area, clearing the City of those they didnt want, and yet, even when Id come to that conclusion, even though it was the only possible explanation, I knew it didnt entirely fit.I started to follow, keeping at a safe distance, my curiosity well and truly aroused.Something about this seemed somehow familiar.A time long ago...when I was a kid...And thenoh God!finally I realized what was going on.I glanced behind me.Gordie and Arturo were following and I frantically waved them away, telling them to go back.Jameson Circle is three quarters of a mile or so down the street from the church.In the old days, and I mean long before I got sent out to the Island, it was an impressive address.Now, just like the rest of this area, its all a bit run down: the grand houses have been allowed to deteriorate, divided up into apartments, or mostly just rooms for those who never stay for more than a month or two.In the middle there was once a well tended communal garden, but now its just an open grassless area with a few dying treesnowhere youd want to visit, day or night, but I had a strong feeling that was where this circus was headed.And sure enough, as we approached the swell in the street, an order was given and the Specials stopped their beating and shouting and formed themselves into a wall several persons deepa move, I noticed, that was being replicated on the far side of the Circle, where there was another accessand all those caught inside were trapped.There was a moment of sickening silence, like the feeling of nausea just before you vomit, and I realized my fears were about to come true.Once when I was a kid visiting relatives in the country, I was asked if I wanted to go beating.They were paying a few bucks, so yeah, I volunteered, despite having no idea what it was.The following day we were up before dawn, dozens of us, and driven out into the middle of nowhere, where we had to form this long line right across the hillside and slowly advance, beating everything with sticks, shouting at the tops of our voices, making a helluva racket.The aim was to flush out any game in the vicinity, to drive them toward the guns of the hunters waiting ahead.I had realized that was what was going on here.There was nothing I could do, had no way to stop it.I wouldnt have even made it through the wall of Specials.Another signal was given, a couple of shots rang out, and then all hell broke loose.It was deafening, partly cuz it was echoing away inside the enclosed circle, bouncing off the walls, but also cuz of the sheer weight of weapons being dischargedhundreds, maybe even thousands of them.It went on for the longest couple of minutes Ive ever known, then finally came to a sporadic spluttering halt.The smoke from their weapons added to the smoke already there, making it impossible to see anything.Into that brief and terrible silence other noises started to be heard: people screaming for mercy, the wailing of the wounded and dying.Those still able ran at the Specials shields, trying to force their way out, but they were clubbed and thrown back to await the next spattering around of gunfire.They were helpless.On the nearest roof and in the windows of surrounding buildings I could just make out men and women equipped with firearms, all kinds, eagerly taking aim at those hemmed in below.It was a straight out massacre.I guess they couldnt get rid of those they didnt want by sending them out to the Island anymore, so theyd started culling them here, taking advantage of what was going on to cleanse the Mainland.I dont know how many were killed; with all the smoke I couldnt really see.Certainly there wasnt a lot of movement amongst those lying on the ground.As I turned and slipped away they were already bringing up the white trucks and the clear up operation was underway.Jesus, this place was worse than the Island.Far worse.A lot of those shooting didnt look to have the faintest idea about guns; Im not even sure theyd held one before.They were just wildly blasting away, shooting randomly like it was some kind of fairground attraction.I turned and hurried back toward the churchyard feeling shocked and bewildered, the way you do when youre forced to realize the gap between you and other members of the human race is far wider than you ever couldve imagined.It was so ironic: on the very day that Lena regained her sight, she couldve been witness to this.A little ways down the street I came across Gordie and Arturo hiding in a doorway.I told you two to go back!I said, turning to check no one was following.What happened?Gordie asked.Nothing.Did they kill them?Arturo asked, looking a little distressed.Just get back to the crypt, will you, I said, really not wanting to answer that question.Why did they kill them?Gordie persisted, knowing my anger was a sign of admission.I dont know, I replied, leading them away.I guess they dont want some people in their city...It dont matter.As soon as the Doc gives Lena the all clear, were going anyway.Even if I have to put out every fire myself.For a while we walked in silence, both kids looking very thoughtful.Its like us back on the Island, Gordie eventually commented.Nah.You didnt know any better, I told him, glancing back to see Arturo starting to lag behind.Hey!Come on!Can I have a horse in the country?he asked as he caught up, his thoughts a million miles away from where I expected.What?A black one, with a white star here, he said, pointing at his forehead.I shrugged, a little perplexed.I dunno.You never even seen a horse, Gordie said dismissively.Seen pictures.I seen one, Gordie told him.When?Arturo asked, with obvious disbelief.In the park, when I was a little kid.Did you ride it?Nope.Im gonna ride mine, Arturo said, as if hed regained the upper hand.Its quite something the way kids do that, draw you into their world, their values.Scores of people had just been massacred but these two were far more interested in which of them had ever seenor riddena horse.Maybe, in a way, its kind of comforting; as if, by hanging on to a little of their innocence, we can stave off some of our harsh reality.We were almost back to the churchyard, Arturo still telling us about all the other animals he was going to have once we got to the country: pigs, sheep, a tiger.In a way, I spose it was that sense of normality, of listening to the kind of conversation Id heard a thousand times before, that made me relax a little, maybe even forget something of what Id just seen.Suddenly there was the sound of a powerful engine roaring up behind us.I turned around, hoping it had nothing to do with us, but in that precise instant we were hit by a bank of spotlights.Run!I shouted, knowing it meant trouble.Run!I protected them as best I could, keeping myself between them and our pursuers, but I realized immediately we couldnt go into the churchyard, that it would endanger everyone.Dont go in there!I screamed, Keep going!That was a helluva thing to have to say: I mean, we were utterly exposed, caught in those spotlights with nowhere to goand Id just run past our only possible refuge.We skirted around the edges of a pile of rubble that had spilled out across the street at a junction, giving us the opportunity to slip down a side road, but whoever was chasing us just bumped over the rubble and accelerated after us and was soon only yards behind, holding station, as if to make it perfectly clear that they could run us down any time they liked, that this was just a game.I felt, rather than saw, this big white pick up.The driver was repeatedly revving the engine as loud as it would go.I shepherded the kids closer to the wall, hoping thered be some shelter somewhere, but suddenly a shot rang out.I glanced back at the pickup, looking for something I could do, some way of stopping them.There was a group of four men and two women in the back, all taunting us, guffawing away as they drunkenly swayed around, trying to aim their rifles.Move it!I screamed at the kids, hoping to put the fear of God into them, to make them run faster than they ever had in their short lives.There was a sudden flurry of gunfire, as if someone had given the order, and bullets were flying everywhere, ricocheting and whining through the airand one of the kids gave a little moan.I turned to Arturo, the youngest, the most vulnerable, but he was running as fast as ever.Gordie also appeared to be moving freely.I was just on the point of assuming it was nothing, of urging them on even faster, when suddenly Arturo faltered, clutched at his side and fell to the ground, rolling over and over.I stopped and ran back; in the street the pick up screeched to a halt.Arturo was just lying there, making this kind of gurgling sound, his eyes rolling back in his head, blood spreading out from his body at an alarming rate.I squatted down, took him in my arms and went to stand up but there was another volley of shots and I got clipped in the shoulder.Id dropped the little guy before I realized, but I recovered enough to try to scoop him up againbut there was so much fire coming my way I had to scramble into this small recess in the wall, next to a tree.Again and again I tried to get out to grab Arturo, but each time I was met by more bullets snapping and pinging around me.Gordie had managed to scramble over the wall a few yards further on, but he mustve worked his way back cuz suddenly his voice came from behind me: Clancy!Yeah!Is Arturo okay?I dont know, I told him, though I had a really bad feeling.I was about to try for the little guy once more, at least to get him out of the line of fire, when the pick up suddenly mounted the sidewalk and drove straight at me, lights blazing, while automatic weapons were indiscriminately discharged.I thought they were going to run Arturo over and maybe settle with me, but the driver screeched to a halt, the passenger door was thrown open, and someone reached down and grabbed Arturos body.He gave this cry of triumph as he dragged it inside like he was landing a prize fish or something.Then they were gone, accelerating away into the smoky night before I even got to my feetbut I did catch a glimpse of the sign on the back:  Join the Infinity Clean up Campaign.Beer, burgers and your choice of weapon.What happened?asked Gordie, suddenly appearing at the top of the wall.For a moment I just stood where I was, in a state of shock, again recalling Yoshis warning about people coming for us in the middle of the night.They took him, I said dazedly.Kidnapped?he said, scrambling down the wall, staring at the pool of Arturos blood.I didnt know how to reply.In the end, I knew he would demand the truth so I just came right out and said it.No...They took his body.For a moment I thought he was going to cry, but he was a tough little guy and even at a time like that, not the sort to let himself go.You sure?was all he managed.I nodded.Ive seen death enough times over the years to be able to make a positive identification.Yeah.Dont ask me why, but we both turned and stared into the smoke where the truck had disappeared, stunned by the brutal suddenness of it, I guess.Only minutes ago, a few hundred yards away, wed been listening to Arturo telling us what animals hed have as pets in the country.Now we couldnt bring ourselves to walk away from the spot where hed been killed.Why did they take him?Gordie asked.I dunno, I replied.Id been asking myself the same question.Why did they?His bottom lip started to quiver and I wondered if he was going to lose it after all.Whats Delilah going to say?he wailed, as if he was only upset on her behalf.God, yeahwhat was Delilah going to say?Jeez, I couldnt begin to imagine...It was an irony, but just as we couldnt bear to leave, soon we couldnt bear to stay.With one last look at that pathetic pool of blood, all that remained of Arturo, we silently walked away.It was beyond all comprehension...Gone.Just like that.Arturo, everyones favorite, our mascot, our talisman, didnt exist anymore.I found myself thinking about that transferMickey Mouseand the first of what I knew would be many tears came to my eyes.Itd been so typical of him: wanting to be a little hard manat times having to bebut inside hed been just a normal, everyday kid.Gordie was right: Delilah was the one who was going to be hit hardest.She loved that little guy more than life itself, and I cant tell ya how much I was dreading giving her the news.Slowly we descended the stone steps of the crypt, our hearts so heavy it was all we could do to bear them.Jimmy had wound up a camping light, I guess cuz no one could bear to be in the dark anymore.Clancy!Lena cried, noticing the blood on my shoulder where Id been winged.Its nothing, I said.Plasterll fix it.Delilah peered around us, waiting for one more person to come trotting down those steps.When he didnt, it was like these shadows started erupting out of her.Wheres Arturo?she asked, slowly getting to her feet.There was a long and deathly silence.I couldnt bring myself to meet her gaze.Clancy?Lena asked.All I could do was to shake my head.I couldnt say the words.Dead, Gordie told them, like he wanted to prove he was man enough to say it, but his voice cracked as the word left his mouth.Delilah just stood there, her mouth slowly falling open, her eyes filling with a pain that almost hypnotized me.Oh no Lena moaned.They got this new form of entertainment, I told them.Call it Cleaning up.Looks like people pay to get drunk and shoot as many undesirables as they can.Why did you take them?Lena wailed, her restored sight fixing me with a look that cut right through me.He didnt!Gordie told them.We followed him.But everything was lost after that: there was no more conversation, no more questions or answers; everything was drowned out by Delilah collapsing to the ground and weeping so loudly and with such pain it was all you could do not to turn and run from it.It filled that crypt to overflowing, and though there mustve been all manner of grief expressed for the dead there over the years, I doubt any of it compared.Delilah howled with such force, such complete abandon, it made me fear for her frail old body.Lile!Lile!Jimmy begged, trying to get a hold on her as she writhed from side to side, but within seconds he too was cryingnot so much for Arturo, I didnt think, but cuz he simply couldnt bear to see her in so much pain.Hanna started to weep too, as silent as ever, the very opposite of Delilah, just sitting in the corner, her head in her hands, not making the slightest sound as tears ran out through her fingers and fell to the floor.For a moment Gordie stood there, staring, then he turned and ran up the steps.Be careful!I shouted after him.Lena went to Hanna and squatted down, comforting her, all the while holding my gaze.For the first time in our relationship we were able to exchange consoling looks, and I wished to God we hadnt had such a reason.I hate this place, I told her, more than anywhere Ive ever known.Why dont we go?she suggested.As soon as Dr.Simon gives the all clear.I can see; its improving already.I was tempted, but for the matter of a couple more days, it didnt seem worth it, not with something so important.Give it til Friday.Then were gone.No matter what.Suddenly Delilah stopped wailing, raised her head and looked at me with strained and bloodshot eyes.Where is he?she asked.Jesus.That was the other question Id been dreading her asking.I dont know.What dyou mean?They took him.What?I dont know why.I want to see him!she protested.Lile!Jimmy said, again trying to put his arm around her, but getting pushed away.I want to see him!she repeated, even more desperately.Hes gone, Lile, Jimmy told her, and she resumed her sobbing, though this time she did allow him to put his arms around heror maybe she was just oblivious to anything else.There was nothing anyone could say.That was our world, both out on the Island and here on the Mainland; nothing and no one was permanent, anyone could disappear, just like that, and it was up to each individual to decide how to deal with it: keep everyone at arms length, cuz feeling for them was merely an invitation to pain?Or dive in and take whatever might be going?In a way, it was a bit like getting drunk.You could be the loud guy, laughing, singing, living every emotion to the fullest, pulling down the walls and saying all the things you always wantedor you could just sit there, quietly sipping, never overdoing it, never willing to risk any kind of hangover.Into the Fire        NINE You gotta move on; in your mind, in your heart, if you dont, sadness will nail you to the floor, crush you wherever you choose to lie.Mind you, thats easy for me to say, I never spent as much time with Arturo as Delilah did.She cried right throughout the night while Jimmy tried to comfort her, but no one could ease that pain.The rest of us just lay there helplessly, hearing every word but pretending we didnt, not reacting or commenting, as if that gave them a degree of privacy.Occasionally Lena would bury her head deep into my chest, maybe to shut out Delilahs grief or to seek some comfort for her own.It was the suddenness as much as anything: just a few hours ago this place had been echoing to the sound of Arturos laughter, Delilah chasing him around, the pair of them screaming in excitement until she finally managed to tug him into an embrace.Death might be the most natural thing in the world, but its the hardest to accept.Not a word was spoken in the morning as we stirred, one by one.The only sound was Delilahs usual early morning hack, and even that sounded grudging, as if she just didnt want to make the effort.The first thing I saw when I opened my eyes was Arturos sleeping bag.I stared at it for a while, sickened by its emptiness, then, with the others still dozing, slipped over and grabbed it.I was gonna take it across the street and toss it on the fire, but with the way the world was it seemed like an awful waste.In the end, I took my secret path through the thorns to that empty space alongside the back wall where no one else went but me and hid it there.When I got back, Delilah was staring at the space where the sleeping bag had been.She looked at me with a hint of betrayal as I entered, but never said a word.Sorry, I muttered, but she remained silent.The rest of that morning was one of the longest and saddest of my life.No one really knew how to react or what to say.Tell the truth, it got a bit much for me.As lunchtime approached, I remembered how little food we had and suggested Lena and me went out to look for some.She paused when we got to the churchyard gate.The fire across the street had burned down to almost nothing, and yet there was still something fueling those flames.In a terrible way, thats a beautiful thing for me, she told me.Guess so.She wandered across to get a better look.I see what Jimmy means, she said, when it flared up again.Are you all right getting this close?I asked, remembering Dr.Simons warning about the smoke and her eyes.She nodded, but I pulled her away anyway, just in case, and we both walked slowly on, heading up toward the Square.The further we went, the more I started to wonder if maybe Id been wrong to suggest she came with me; actually seeing all the destruction was very different from being told about it.On the way back from Dr.Simons most of the City had still been intact.Here it was nothing but destruction and burned out buildings, with the occasional twisted corpse left lying for everyone to see.But she took it all wellalmost too welltil I began to wonder if maybe, as she hadnt been able to see, her mind had conjured up something even worse.Though that was a pretty hard thing to imagine.We didnt have to go that far in the end: by exploring the more unfashionable looking streets we found an area where a few stores and restaurants were still functioning and did our previous trick of rummaging through the garbage.Im not sure what sort of food it wasAsian, maybe Vietnamese or Koreanbut business obviously wasnt that good cuz we scooped out enough to last us several days.I wouldve liked to have kept going, to have shown her more, but we were both feeling guilty about leaving the others for so long, so we headed back.Do you think its getting better?I asked, referring to her sight.Yes.Things are becoming clearer all the time.Thats a shame, I said, kinda teasing myself.Clancy!she groaned wearily.Only joking!I said, grabbing her arm and pretending to restrain her fist in case she took a swing.Im not laughing.Okay, okay, fine, I said, putting her hand back at her side with the care of a loaded weapon.We wandered on, both of us trying to be as normal as possible, to wordlessly withstand the crushing weight of Arturos death, or maybe just beginning to learn to live with it.So is that it then?she finally asked.Now that I can see my own way youre not going to hold my hand anymore?I chuckled and immediately took her hand.You dont get rid of me that easy.Clancy, she said, stopping for a moment to face me, you have no idea how wonderful it is to actually see you.I smiled at her, grateful for the reassurance, but also delighted to indulge in the simple pleasure of gazing into each others eyes.And there, in the middle of the sidewalk, with passers by staring as if there had to be something wrong with us, we stood and held each other for several minutes, letting the world go by and the pain subside, knowing that, as long as the doc gave the okayand we could find a way through the firesby this time the following day wed be away from all of this.The following morning, Lena and me took what was becoming a familiar route up into the foothills to Dr.Simons clinic.Both of us were feeling this odd mixture of optimism tempered by sadness; we were excited at the prospect of going to the country, but oh so painfully disappointed that Arturo wouldnt be with us.This time we were shown straight into the docs office, though he didnt appear for a good twenty minutes.When he did, he looked unusually flustered.So?How is it?he asked Lena, immediately booting up his computer before scanning her eyes with this scope attachment.Fine.Theyre improving by the day.Thats good, he said, obviously pleased with what he was seeing on the screen.No pain or discomfort?No, none.He studied her eyes for a few moments longer, taking in every detail, then pushed the attachment away.Fantastic.You can see again, he announced.Thats it?Lena asked, a little surprised.Yes.Everythings fine.But the rejection?I asked, wanting to get it straight in my mind.That could happen at any time, right?Well...he said, as if dismissing the thought as one of no consequence, in theory, youre never free of that possibility, but its minimal.A serious bump might do it, some kind of violent disturbance, but that could happen to a normal sighted person.For a moment Lena just sat there in silence, as if with this final confirmation that she really had regained her sight, she was only now allowing herself to take it in.Thank you...thank you, thank you!she said to Dr.Simon, and after a moment, as if shed been considering it, she jumped up and gave him a hug.Its my pleasure, he told her, looking like a man who didnt like being touchedor maybe he just didnt want his suit creased.Now, theres just a couple of final tests, and something I want to give you...Will you excuse us a moment, Clancy?Then shes all yours.You wont have to come back again.The news that we were finally free to go had prompted as big a smile on my face as it had Lenas.In fact, left alone, and despite being the clumsiest old big guy in the world, I was tempted to leap up on the docs desk and do a little dance.All we had to do now was find a way out of the citya corridor, maybe, where the fires had burned themselves out and we could slip through and out into the wilds to somewhere altogether sweeter.I cant tell you how good that sounded.For sure it wouldve sounded a whole lot better if Arturo had been coming with usand I knew his shadow was gonna be there for a very long timebut I reckon he wouldve been as pleased as anyone to know we were about to go free.Five minutes waiting for Lena and Dr.Simon to return became ten and I started to pace a little, becoming impatient.I wanted to get going, collect the others and find a way out of that shithole, but I told myself it was only right that the doc should do everything necessary.I went to the window and took a look out at the garden, noticing how some of the manicured vegetation was starting to feel the effects of the smoke; even the obviously expensive and well tended plants were becoming a little brown and withered.It was just as I went to turn and resume my pacing that I saw Dr.Simon being driven away in his limousine.I was too surprised to reactI couldnt get my head around it at all!It couldnt have beenNo way!My eyes mustve been playing tricks on me.For a moment I just stood there, watching the limo disappearing down the drive, my face frozen in a frown...What the hell?I rushed to the door and took a look out.Hello!I shouted down the hallway, but nobody came.Hello!I started opening other doors, finding room after room empty.What was going on here?Had there been some kind of emergency?Had he had to leave in a hurry?Is that why hed been so preoccupied earlier?Lena!I shouted.Lena?I found a kind of laboratory, the sort of place where you mightve expected her to be, but again there was no one.I was just about to head out to look somewhere else when I noticed an empty syringe on the floor.What kind of doctor does that, just leaves a syringe lying around?Werent there rules about that kind of thing?I squatted down, picked it up and studied the couple of drops of clear liquid left inside as if I could tell what they were.Finally, I slipped it into my pocket.I was starting to get a really bad feeling about this.I went to stand up and found my stiff old joints a little reluctant to straighten.Only at the very last moment did I hear this kind of low swish behind me.I started to turn but never made it, colliding with something that hit me with real uncompromising force, propelling me straight out into the center of a dark universe and leaving me there to perish.I came to slowly, blearily, as if all the life left in me was trickling out of one barely open eye.I was in the darkI didnt know where, but it certainly wasnt the crypt.The space was far too small.One thing was for sure, wherever I was really stank.In fact, the stench was so overwhelmingly obnoxious, it made breathing difficult.At first I thought it was fishbad fish, old fish, left to putrefy in some forgotten corner, then I realized it was something else, something far worse: the smell was rotting flesh.Rotting human flesh...I started to pant.I desperately needed fresh air, but something was on top of me: a sprawling, inert, suffocating weightin fact, it wasnt just on top of me; I was surrounded on all sides.It was only when I tried to move, to force myself free, that I realized what my cheek was pressed up against, and I tell ya, I damn near threw up.I was crammed into the middle of a pile of corpses.There were bodies all around me, layer upon layer of dead people.That was the weight I could feel pressing down and from all directions.They werent quite decomposing yetthough those at the bottom were obviously well on their waybut fluids were leaking out, dripping down onto me.Blood was everywhere: I couldnt see it, but for sure I could smell and feel its salty stickiness.Again I tried to move, wriggling and pushing this way and that, all the while trying not to panic as I battled this overwhelming feeling that I was locked into some ultimate nightmarebut I couldnt.It was as if I was jammed into this big tin can, sealed in with as many bodies as could possibly fit in with me.I pushed again, as hard as I could, trying to give myself some space to maneuver, and thenJesus, the worst thing of allI gave the body next to me a real shove and my hand disappeared inside.I wrenched it back out, feeling a broken bone, a rib maybe, scratch my skin, and I realized Id pushed through into nothingnessthat body was empty.My fear mustve generated some sort of primitive instinct cuz I pushed upward as hard as I could, trying to shift those on top of me, and at last there was a squeak somewhere, the grinding of metal, and just for a moment I saw a tiny slither of the smoky night sky.Then whatever it wasand I guess it was some kind of lid or doorslammed back down and I was entombed once more.It was that metallic clank that made me think about what I was insideI knew that sound, it was really familiar.And finally it hit me: it was a dumpster, a big industrial one, by the feel of it, and Jesus, you wanna talk about karma?Id dumped the odd body in a dumpster myself in my time.Im not proud of it, and I hope for their sake they hadnt still been alive like me, cuz it was about as a bad a fate as I could imagine anyone suffering.There was no way out of there other than by sheer brute force, focusing down into the very deepest depths of me and mining whatever was left to push and shove, fighting my way through ruptured bodies, torn flesh, discarded organs, things I didnt dare think about, ignoring the blood and bile and slime and feces that coated my body, until finally I managed to punch my way through to the top of the pile and heaving the lid back, gasped in something closer to fresh air.God only knew what I mustve looked like as I tumbled out of that thing.Thankfully, there was no one to see me.I found myself in a deserted service alleyway at the back of some empty buildings, and by the look of all the crap around, it was a favorite dumping place for locals.I spotted some old paint drums nearby filled with murky rainwater, and believe me, nothing couldve been more welcome.I tried to rub my face clean before rubbing myself down, but eventually I just poured every drop I could find over me, anything to remove that noxious slime.What the hell happened?How in Gods name had I ended up in a dumpster?Did I die?Or did someone think I was so close it was only a matter of time?And where had all those bodies come from?Women, menand though it sickened me to say it, there were kids there, too.Howd they died?For sure some had been operated on...just thinking that reminded me of that sickening feeling when Id plunged my hand through the ribs into that empty cavity...The longer I stood there the more things started to open up in my mind, like someone popping that bubble wrap stuff: Dr.Simonthe laboratoryand Oh my God!Lena!I was running even before I knew it, no matter I felt all weak and shaky and was still wanting to puke my guts up, and with a pain in my head like I had an ax sticking out of it.I could see a glow in the sky and realized it was early morningsomehow Id lost the best part of a day.Where the hell was she?What had happened?And why?Why had Dr.Simon cured her blindness only to kidnap her?When I emerged out onto the street at the top of the alleyway, I realized I was in the bay area.Immediately I turned toward the hills: I had to find her and the only place I could think of to start looking was back at the clinic.I knew security would be a problem, but I was so desperate, so scared for Lena, I just charged up there anyway.They were fine when I first arrived, when they saw me looking through the gate, but then this woman came over and when she got a closer look and saw I was still damp from my shower, when she realized how agitated I was, her attitude changedparticularly when I told her I had to see Dr.Simon.I had no clearance but I begged her, over and over, til eventually she agreed to talk to the house.She returned to the gate office, perhaps to unwittingly give them the unwelcome news I was still alive.After a while, she came back out.Dr.Simons not there.Who is?No onethe housekeeper, she corrected herself.I stopped and thought for a moment.Did you see Dr.Simon yesterday?Around about lunchtime?With my friend?She stared at me, obviously concerned by my manner, trying to work out what the hell was going on here and who was involved.No.In his limo?No.You must have!She stood there for a moment, then sighed and went back inside, returning a few moments later.Dr.Simon left here yesterday at 12:08 with his driver.There was no other life form in the car.I shook my head, more to myself than to her, and gazed through the bars of the gate to the clinic.Can I just go up there for a few minutes?Not without clearance, she said, her patience obviously wearing thin.Well, Im not budging from here til I do, I warned her.She glared at me, obviously not too impressed at the prospect of having a threatening looking crazy at the gates on her watch.I guess she realized that I could create a fair amount of embarrassment before I was taken away.Eventually she sighed and went back inside.Returning a short time later she said, If you wait for a while, the housekeepers just got to do something then shes going to come down to let you in.When?I demanded.Five minutes!she snapped, walking away, and left me standing there with my hands gripping the bars, looking for all the world like a prisoner.She didnt go far but stationed herself on the steps of the officeI guess she wanted to keep an eye on me.Id seen Dr.Simons housekeeper once, but never spoken to her.I had no idea how willing shed be to talk about her employerwho knew who was involved?Though the news that thered been no other life forms in the limo worried me far more: what the hell did no other life forms mean?Dr.Simon wouldnt have just knocked Lena out and left her, surely?He wouldve had tove taken her with himin which case, maybe these people were lying?cuz if they werent, I didnt want to think what that might mean.As I waited there, pacing from side to side of the gates, repeatedly checking to see if the housekeeper was coming, I had a sudden thought: the last time I was asked to wait a few minutes around here it hadnt worked out that well.Was it instinct or what?The moment the thought occurred to me I just turned and ran, leaving the security woman calling after me.I hadnt got more than a couple of hundred yards into the smoke before I heard a Dragonfly go over.I ducked off into this little gully that followed the path of the road and hid in the trees when it returned a few minutes later and started circling.They turned on their searchlights, trying to pierce the gloom, but I remained well hidden.I was on automatic, in survival mode, not wanting to think any further than that.I didnt know if it was the security woman or the housekeeper whod called for backup, but whoever it was, it meant I could forget all about Dr.Simon kidnapping Lena cuz she was some kind of medical miracle.Our good doctor was working for Infinity, and I wouldve been willing to bet anything it was them holding her prisoner.When the Dragonfly finally gave up and thrummed off into the smoke, I broke cover and began to make my way back to the churchyard, partly cuz I needed to tell the others what was going on (after all, wed been missing more than a day) and partly cuz I couldnt think of anywhere else to go.I felt sick to the stomach.Jesus, what a fool!What a first class dumb assed stupid old big guy!No wonder I was only ever employed for my muscles.How could I have allowed myself to be taken in by that smarmy bastard?Lena had been right: the moment he told me hed waive his fees I shouldve known something was wrong.Instead, I guess he had all that time plotting, waiting for his opportunitybut why hadnt he kidnapped her when shed stayed at the clinic?None of it made any sense.And what the hell did Infinity want with her anyway?Was it something to do with Jimmy?Were they trying to get to him through her?Didnt seem very likely.I didnt think Infinity even knew the two of them were connected.Not that any of this mattered.There was only one thing my dull old heart was insistently repeating: Id lost her!The woman Id waited my whole life for had been taken from me.And as I passed yet another scene of blazing destruction, of life reduced to lifelessness, it momentarily went through my head that maybe normal order had been restored, a wrong had been righted; that there was simply no place in this hell for an angel like Lena.When I reached the sad remains of the church, wearily climbed across the piles of rubble and down the steps into the crypt, the others just looked at me.I guess they knew that me and Lenas absence meant something had gone terribly wrong, and the fact that I was alone meant they were just too afraid to ask what.For a moment I just stood in front of them, unable to get the words out, wanting to tell them but knowing that if I tried, tears would flow.I think Infinity have got Lena, I eventually managed.Of all the things I couldve said, that was plainly the one they least expected.What?Delilah cried, as if the death of Arturo made her less able to take such a blow; that it could be the final straw.I told them the whole storywell, as best I could.Dragging it up from my consciousness and fashioning it into any kind of sense felt a bit like sticking my fingers down my throat and puking my guts up.It must be me, Jimmy said.Theyre gonna torture her, find out where I am.How do they even know youre connected?I muttered.He thought for a moment, but came up with nothing.I dont know...What else could it be?Maybe its got something to do with the syringe?Gordie suggested.They experimented on her.I handed the syringe to Jimmy to look at.Something to knock her out, dyou think?I ventured.Make sure she didnt make a fuss?Even then, I reckon shedve put up a fight.She still wouldve shown up on the gate scan, Jimmy pointed out.Maybe she did?There was a pause.I couldnt bear the thought that while Lena had been fighting for her freedommaybe even her lifeId been only a few yards away, oblivious to the whole thing.Delilah sagged slowly down onto her sleeping bag.What are we going to do?There was a long silence.What could we do, three unarmed old folk and a couple of kids?I dunno, I said eventually, but Ill tell you one thing: Lenas everything to me.If its a choice between living without her or dying trying to get her back, Im gonna choose the latter every time.Hanna slipped over and put her arms around methe last person I wouldve expected to do such a thingand though she never said anything, like always, I could feel her unspoken emotions.Well get her back, Jimmy said, and the others all muttered agreement.And yet, no matter how brave their words, how reassuring they all attempted to be, it was impossible to ignore the sense of despair, of hopelessness, that settled over us.We were already grieving for Arturo and now here we were, stricken by further disaster.Even if Id been run over by a truck, I couldntve felt any more squashed.Everything inside me was knocked out or shut down, and as our conversations became progressively more desperate and the fact that I really had lost Lena sank in, I began to feel more and more frustrated.I had to do something.Eventually I headed off out, ignoring Jimmys plea that we should start looking for somewhere else to live.All I cared about was getting Lena back, and if Infinity really did have her, then there was only one logical place to start looking.The night we escaped from the Island Id been aware of the Infinity building and how dominant it was, but I hadnt really studied it.That afternoon as I made my way around the perimeter, I began to see exactly what I was up against.I ended up in this patch of scrub at the front that led down to one of the many rocky inlets in the bay, finding myself a little cover and just sitting there scrutinizing the complex, trying to work out how I could get inside.The side that faced the sea looked impregnable, yet somehow aloof.From the front it was a whole different matter: it was a lot more in your face, with concrete bollards lined up like soldiers on parade, fences which looked like they might well be electrified and a gate protected by double automatic barriers and armed guards.There was no way into that place other than perhaps flying in and landing on the helipad on the roof.No sooner had I come to that conclusion than a Dragonfly came whooshing over, its arrival triggering spotlights that even in daylight picked it out of the smoky sky, and a whole bank of laser cannons swiveled into action, primed and ready to bring it down at a moments notice.The one thing that puzzled me was the arrival of a line of half a dozen or so of those sinister white truckswhat the hell were they doing here?They just dumped bodies, didnt they?In convenient dumpsters down dark alleyways, apparently.Whatever the reason, they got the same treatment as everyone else: they were searched, swept and scanned every which way.Not until the security guards were entirely satisfied were they allowed to enter.I expelled a lungful of tired air.The longer I stayed, the more intimidated I became.I also realized something else: Id been so busy taking in all the major stuff that I hadnt registered this constant background noise.It was a kinda rolling, sliding sound, traveling up and down, and when I saw the source, I knew I shouldve noticed it before.That top wire on the fence wasnt electrified; it was a railway for security cameras.Every thirty seconds or so one whirred by, looking out for any possible intruders.I didnt know exactly where those cameras were pointing and I wasnt gonna hang around to find out either.I got to my feet, dusted myself down and stretched, hoping I looked like some hobo whod been looking for a few hours sleep but had found his chosen spot unsuitable, and headed off.The last thing I needed was them taking a special interest in me.As I wandered away, my eyes went to the endless rows of windows on that huge building.Lena, are you in there?I whispered.Dont worry.Im coming for you.
