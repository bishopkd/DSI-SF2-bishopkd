That is what makes the punishment so terrible.There is blind and remorseless cruelty; and there is what the Kaun do to us,          with their curse of Despair.It is, in my view, as different as day is to night.Our days back then were largely spent disposing of stone corpses through the hull hatch in the ships glass belly.I had no friends.We all lived separate lives, mistrustful of each          other, cruelly hating.Then one day we woke, and a hundred of us were missing.Some returned, many cycles later, with limbs that had been regrown, or new heads, and with no memory of what had happened          to them.And some never returned again.And this is when I first realised what we slaves were for.Some of us were merely scorned chattels, but many served as the warrior army of the Kaun.Furthermore, every time we woke          from our dreamless sleep, new ones had appeared in our world.Single or several samples of newly captured sentient species.And they arrived full of terror and pain; and were immediately plunged into a world of even greater terror and pain.Carulha          used to brag that every new slave needed to be made to feel as he had felt, after the death of his world.The agony of others, he would argue, in his few coherent moments, was the only way          to honour the lost dead of his magnificent, arrogant species.But I believed Carulha to be a brute, as terrible in his way as the Kaun.His wretched kind, I mused, deserved their fate;          it was the rest of we slaves who should be pitied.And so I resolved to change my world.Instead of fighting, I would make peace.Instead of hating, I tried to spread love.And this I did.For many long frustrating months.And I was mocked for it; and despised for my innocence and my foolishness.For I spoke to all I met about the need for love          and a new world order.I begged them all to share tales of their past, and to find a commonality in our sentience.I explained          that hate and anger will simply feed more hate and anger.And I told them that we needed to accept the frailty and folly of          our captors.Not to condone their crimes, but rather so we could forgive them, and thus exalt our own souls.I spoke to each creature on the ship in such manner, over the space of hundreds of cycles.I told stories of my own peoples          history to illustrate my point that violence is an evolutionary dead end.And I conjured up a vision of a world in which all          of us would exist in amity and harmony.For a long while I was ignored; but eventually my words began to take hold.I acquired a following; several of the more vicious          predators broke with Carulha and began living their lives according to my principles: routine, comradeship, storytelling,          love.And Carulha was enraged by this.He regarded it as treachery, a threat to his authority.And so once more his army of bullying cruel monsters gathered to destroy me.To rip me, as they bragged, limb from fucking          limb, and then to hurl me from the hull hatch.They met me on the Great Plain.And there I stoodall alone, for my allies had abandoned me as Carulha approached.I was faced          with an encircling army of nearly six hundred giant sentients, two hundred or more hairless bipeds, six thousand many limbed          predators, and all the arboreals.Only the Kindred did not deign to fight me, for they refused to have any part in the workings          of our world.I will admit that I was afraid; for I did not want to hurt anyone, and yet I knew that I would have to.No fucking speeches, yelled Carulha, die, you fucking cunt!and the battle began.And thus for the second time in my entire life, I fought.And I slew them by the score, and ripped them limb, as Carulha had put it, from fucking limb.I smashed the aerials out          of the sky with my tentacles and I ripped open the bodies of the giant sentients and tore the arboreals and bipeds and the          many limbed predators into pieces with my tentacle claws that moved so fast that none could see their motionthus my foes          would abruptly and inexplicably split into many parts, gushing scarlet blood.All this I did and more.And when it was all over, I threw Carulhas dismembered body out of the hull hatch, and the bodies of Marosh, Tarang, and nearly three hundred others.They would not dieI knew this for a fact, as I had known and understood          so much from my very first moments on the Hell Ship.The same way that I had known that the waters of the well of life would          heal me faster and more fully than allowing nature take its course.No, they would not die; but their souls would live for eternity in the ripped remnants of their bodies, drifting through the          emptiness of space.And when the surviving slaves saw how I had vanquished Carulha, they swore their loyalty to me.They told me that I would          be their new master!But I refused their plea.For I would not be worshipped.I would not be obeyed.I would, however, I insisted, be listened to.And so they listened.And I used my newly acquired power to change our world.And this I have done; all the good that exists          on my world, the clear blue waters of the lake, the comradeship, the use of cabins, the division of labours, the fertile plains,          the Rhythm of Life itselfall this I caused to be.Sharrock had no knowledge of all this; he arrogantly assumed I was merely a gullible and docile pawn of the Kaun.But in fact, I had defied the Kaun, without them ever realising.I had turned their nightmare slave ship into a place where sentients of many species          could live, and love, and share the joy of friendship.So I have done; of this I am proud.I found Cuzco on a crag, on Day the First, looking down at our world.The views, he told me, are wonderful up here.I looked at the views.They were indeed wonderful.Are you brooding?I asked him.Fuck away, Cuzco advised me.You are.I am, indeed, you ignorant ugly monster, brooding, he conceded.I sat with him, in silence, for an hour.Im still worried, I said eventually, about Sharrock.Cuzco snorted.No need; hes doomed.Forget the little cock faced biped, for hell be marble soon enough.You worry too much, Sai ias.But I care about him.And it was a hard time for all of us, remember?The first few years.You must have You are so fucking pathetic!Cuzco raged at me, cutting off my words.Youre like a fucking mother to the new ones!Youd          feed them the food from your mouth if you could.You sad ingratiating suck arse!You cant coddle creatures like this.Fly          or die, thats the way of the world.I helped you.No one helped me.A lie, of course.Cuzco had also been an angry, bitter new one; I had spent many hours trying to teach him how to bank down          his rage, and to find the moments of joy concealed in the bleakness of his life.Now, of course, he denied that he had ever          needed me, or received any help from me; such was his pride.He reminds me a little of you, in fact, I ventured.Go fuck a cloud!said Cuzco.Hes a biped.Im aa And he used a word that the air could not translate, but I knew it          meant he had status.He was a giant among beasts, even on our interior world.And, indeed, I often felt that Cuzco was a truly magnificent creature.He was a land giant with the power of flight; his armoured          wings made him somehow lighter than air, and so he was able to effortlessly dance among the clouds, though he weighed more          than Fray and myself put together.And his body was beautiful, in its own eerie fashion: he had two torsos, linked by bands of armoured flesh, and orange scales that glittered in the light.And claws on his haunches and torsos that could,          when he so chose, be as delicate as hands.And no head; his face was on the breast of his left body, and he had features that          were expressive and flexible and eyes that seemed to me to twinkle with delight when his mood was cheerful; though that was,          in all honesty, not often.I fear Sharrock is harbouring a secret plan, I admitted He thinks he knows a way to defeat the Kaun.Perhaps he does.You know he doesnt.Its folly.I once, said Cuzco, had ideas like that.In his first year on the ship, Cuzco had, like me, attempted to attack the Tower.And to do so he had gathered a formidable          army of aerials who had joined Cuzco in his attempt to breach the Towers invisible barrier from above.But storms had battered          them and Cuzcos six wings had been ripped off him so that he crashed like a rock in the lake, and the savage gusts of air          had ripped the entire flock of aerials into shreds.Blood had rained upon us all that day; blood and beaks and feathers and          scales and fragments of unrecognisable internal organs that pelted downwards and left our bodies soaked and stenched.Many          of Cuzcos followers were still mutilated after their mauling by the storm; and none of the aerials ever spoke to him now.Perhaps you could talk to him, I said.Counsel him to be Cuzco stood up and his hackles rose, and terrifying spikes emerged from his body.I will tell him nothing of the sort!What do you take me for, you cowardly colon full of shit?You do not comprehend, said          Cuzco, what it is to be a warrior!I comprehend it totally.My kind were masters of all creation!We vanquished all the lesser breeds in our galaxy, and we were proud of it!Your words bring you shame.You are nothing but a monster, Cuzco, I told him, wearily.Cuzco snarled; and then he stood; and leaped off the cliff top; and with grace and majesty he flew above the clouds, a patch          of orange blurring the blue sky.Monster, I said sadly, knowing it was true.If Id met Cuzco in any other setting, he would have been my enemy, not my friend.Sharrock I was tired of running; I had been running for days; yet still I ran.I knew that in the trees they were faster than me; so I seized my moment and broke through into a clearing, and knew it was          just a few more minutes to the lake        But then I whirled and saw that the wretched monkeys had me surrounded.They had clubs and knives; there were a hundred or          more of them.An army.They cackled and screamed with delight; and were clearly convinced I was not capable of causing them          any further trouble, with the odds so heavily in their favour.They did not, it seemed, know Sharrock!I clutched the stone in my hand, relaxed my body, and calculated the distance between myself and Mangan and his regiment of          tree huggers.My eyes quietly scanned the mob.I identified the dominant beasts who needed to be slain first; and then I cleared          my throat so I could deliver a battle roar to confuse and paralyse the more timid ones.I also considered how I could use the monkeys themselves as weapons; using the bodies of the dead ones to club the live ones,          whilst using my teeth to bite and sever arteries.I recalled the time on Latafa when I was faced with a baying mob of two          hundred highly trained four armed centurions, and slew them all.All in all, I concluded, my task here was difficult, but          by no means impossible.For as the historians of Maxolu all agreewith only those two irksome exceptionsI am indeed the greatest Northern Tribe warrior of all time!The monkeys roared more rage, and started to slowly move towards me.I thought for a few moments more.Calculating all my          options.Plotting my various potential battle moves.Then I quietly let the stone drop out of my hand.Do your worst, I said calmly.And they did.Hell Ship           Sai ias I laid Sharrocks bloodied body down upon the grass, and I bathed him in water from the water of life well; oozing the healing          moisture on him through the spiracles in my tentacle tips.Can you speak?He grunted, and opened his mouth; inside was a bloody void.As Id suspected, his tongue had been ripped out.His torso was          bruised and bloody, and I suspected there was severe internal damage.Theyd also eaten one of his eyes.He grunted as the water drizzled on to his naked body.Just as Id feared, Mangan and the arboreals had taken their revenge.For twelve cycles I tended to Sharrock; nursing his wounds, talking to him; telling him stories.His wounds healed, and his          tongue grew back quickly; but he was not communicative even when he did speak.After six cycles he was able to walk.After ten cycles he made a sword out of a tree branch; the wood was tough and the point was viciously sharp.He killed a non sentient          grazer and skinned it and fashioned himself a scabbard.He used the hooves to make knuckle guards, to help him with hand to          hand combat.For days he collected stone remnants at the quarry and from then on always carried a bag of stones and a sling.Will you take revenge?I asked him.You want me not to?he said mockingly; for his tongue was now regrown.I want you to forgive them, I said.You know I cannot do that, Sharrock said sternly.Please, Sharrock.For me?Never!he snarled.Those branch fucking savages tricked me.Ambushed me!I was trying to do as you told me, live in peace.But they attacked me anyway.And now, I said sadly, you will attack them?Sharrock looked at me; his pale blue eyes were calm.And he never, I noticed, felt the need to blink as many bipeds did.No, he said, calmly.These weapons are just for self defence.I gave a beating, I took a beating.Further violence would          be folly, so now Im done.From this point on, I embrace the way of peace.You really mean that?I really mean it, Sharrock avowed.I felt so proud.Over the next twenty or so cycles, I got into the habit of spending the early mornings with Sharrock by the lake side.He loved to fish; he had fashioned lines and nets and captured dozens of fish each day, all of which he released back into          the water.And he was a gentler spirit now, after the mauling from the arboreals.A status quo had been achieved; indeed,          Mangan and Shiiaa and the other arboreals occasionally invited Sharrock to share their cabin at night, and there they told          each other tales.Sharrock had passed, and survived, his brutal initiation.Sharrock talked often to me about his familyhis love partner Malisha and his daughter Sharil, and Malishas brothers Tharn          and Jarro, and their love partners Clavala and Blarwan, and their assorted childrenwith love and tenderness.And he told          some delightful stories about the stupid things that young Sharil used to do, and the even stupider things he used to do to make her laugh.And I told him that I had been merely a child when I was taken by the Kaun.I had never had sex, or known adult love; my          adolescence ended when I was captured by alien invaders and brutally beaten by the then occupants of the Hell Ship.He was clearly shaken by that story; it affected him sorely for days.I talked to him also about Cuzco and his warrior code, and I tried to get him to see how unutterably foolish it was.My people were not like that, Sharrock protested.Cuzco is just a savage; from all you say, no better than the Kaun.But          we were a cultured and a civilised people.Truly?Truly.Then tell me; how many Maxoluns have you killed in single combat?I asked him, Sharrock was shaken by the question.Hundreds, he admitted.And in war?Thousands.And you feel no guilt?None.You should.Perhaps I should, Sharrock conceded.He was silent for a while, made pensive by my words.How can that be?I asked him.How does a child become so ruthless a warrior?When I was eleven, he said, I was sent into the desert, to spend three days and three nights alone.And, he said, his          eyes sparkling at the recollection, it was hot.Fierce hot, with air that scorched the lungs.I drank water from roots.I          hid from predators, including the great Sand Baro.And I fought the Quila.These are four legged creatures, the size of my          hand, with vicious teeth, who live in the sand itself.And every dawn on our world the Quila would emerge from their sandy          burrows and bask in the sun and feed on the flesh of unwary creatures who strayed their way.I killed six thousand of them before my father came to fetch          me.And what did that teach you?Ha!That Quila will die, if you hit them hard enough with a club.And furthermore, if you judge it right, they will squirt          blood from both ends.He laughed bitterly.It taught me nothing.No, not true, it taught me how to survive.Yours is a brutal culture.Id never, admitted Sharrock, thought so, before I met you.Imagine, I told him, a world where sentient species collaborated, and helped each other, and cared for each other.Where          discovery mattered more than victory.Would that be so bad?Not possible.We achieved it.My people.Then the Kaun came and your people didnt know how to fight, Sharrock taunted me.At least we lost a civilisation, I said.You lostwhat?a barbarism?Sharrocks features were pale with shock; my words had hit home.Perhaps, he said, and I marvelled at his courage in accepting that his entire life might have been founded on moral error.And so, buoyed with confidence at Sharrocks new attitude, I decided he was finally ready to learn the real truth about our          terrible world.It is time, I told Sharrock, for you to meet your own kind.Sharrock and I travelled up past the lake to the mountain ranges, and thence into the deep Valley where the smaller bipeds          and the Kindred dwelled.The air was darker here, and clammy in the throat, and the high ground was just rock without any          covering of soil.But the valley itself was rich and fertile, and twin rivers trickled and gurgled their way through it.I had built these rivers with my own teeth and claws and the help of all the giant sentients.We created channels that were          pumped with waters from the lake; and to our delight, the lake could refill itself by some unknown automatic means, so the          rivers always flowed.And further down the valley there were fields, fresh ploughed, and grazing animals on the grasslands.We proceeded on a pebbled          path down a steep slope, as giants walked below us; I, slithering down on my segments, Sharrock running along beside me.And at the gateway to the village of the Kindred, we were greeted by Gilgara, their chief warrior: a bearded colossus who          was twice as tall as Sharrock, and who, like Sharrock, had upper arms as large as his head and strongly defined muscles upon          his torso.Sharrock bowed, clearly impressed by Gilgaras military bearing and physique, and avariciously eyed the metal sword that the          giant wore in a fine leather scabbard.You have weapons?Sharrock said.Forged with fire; the metal comes from walls in cabins that we have pillaged, said Gilgara.Impressive, said Sharrock, respectfully.Next to Gilgara was Mara; a glowering female warrior with one eye larger than the other.Mara peered at Sharrock, and a smile          grew.Fresh meat, Mara said, looking at Sharrock, and Sharrocks own smile faded.Sharrock then started to warily look around him.There were twenty or more Kindred warriors strolling out of the village to          join us, each twice as large as he, wearing furs and hides over their shoulders and groins, leaving legs and arms and midriffs          bare; and many were ornately tattooed.And there were a considerable variety of smaller hairless bipeds too; some with three eyes, some with two, or five; some with          two arms, some with four, some six arms, some eight; some with soft skin, some with tough hide; some were grey in colour,          many pink, some blue, some purple, quite a few black, many were bronzed, and a handful of exceptional specimens had colourful striped          skin.But all were of a similar morphology to Sharrock; comprising minor variations of what I firmly believed was an archetypal          biological form.And some of these small bipeds wore loose shackles with chains at their feet, to prevent them running away, and bore a haunted          look.While others wore rich leathers and strode proudly; but still wore metal shackles around their upper arms, and kept          their eyes averted from the members of the Kindred.Sharrock was studying it all, with that attentive and curious look on his face; I knew it would not take him long to work          out the power balance here.These peoples live side by side?he whispered to me.The giants and the similar to Olarans?In a manner of speaking, I explained.The smaller bipeds are slaves to the Kindred.Slaves?They have no freedom; they fetch and carry; they are flogged if they disobey; slaves, I clarified.The sharp and angry intake of breath from Sharrock alarmed me.We came here, I explained to Sharrock, for you to see this, and to absorb the lessons it holds about the reality of power          on this world, and then to leave.Have you brought this squalid wretch to join us?asked Gilgara, interrupting our private conference with arrogant brusqueness;          as if we were the food on his plate that had dared to converse.Not so, I explained, Sharrock has come merely to pay his respects.He must stay.All bipeds live in the Valley, Gilgara said fiercely.Fuck away, I said calmly.This one is protected by me.Youd live with this monster, not with your own kind?roared Gilgara to Sharrock.Sharrock stared up at the giant warrior.Why do so many wear metal bands on their arms?he asked.Each band bears a name; it denotes the master of the slave, Gilgara said, matter of factly.We are all captives here, Sharrock said calmly.But none should be slaves of Gilgara spat at him; it was a vast gob of green, and I admired the giants aim; it struck Sharrock on his forehead, and dripped          down his face; but Sharrocks stare did not falter an instant.We are the Kindred, said Gilgara.We are no creatures slaves.We serve the Leaders of this ship freely, and voluntarily.It took Sharrock a few moments to comprehend what he was being told.He looked at me; I waved my tentacles to indicate agreement,          and realised that made no sense to him, so I said: That is so.The smaller bipeds, however, said Mara proudly, are slaves, And you shall be too.Never!Sharrock said angrily.Mara drew her finely forged metal sword, and pointed it menacingly at Sharrock.Gilgara did the same, in a swift gesture as          fast as lightning spanning the sky.Sharrock tensed, ready to fight.I caught Sharrock with a tentacle and threw him on my back.Then I tentacle flipped away.The Kindred did not give chase; they knew me too well.The fucking bastards!roared Sharrock.I wanted you to see for yourself.This is why, said Sharrock, piecing together the parts of a puzzle that, until that moment, he had not realised was a puzzle.This is why you put me with the arboreals, not with others more akin to my physical type.Nine hundred cycles ago, the Kindred enslaved all the biped species.I was unable to prevent them.Why would they do such a thing?To their own kind!The Kindred are the Kindred; they have no kind.And I am the only biped who is free?Yes.Why?What makes me so special?You are under my protection.You mean, youd fight for me?No, I conceded.But the Kindred rely on me; I make their rivers flow, and their crops grow; I discourage rebellion among          the giant sentients; I keep the world from falling into anarchy and Despair.The Kindred rule the Valley.They have biped          slaves to dominate; and so they are content.We other sentients keep apart from them.We lead our own quiet lives.Well, thats going to change, said Sharrock, quietly smiling now.No, it will not change.Just watch, sweet beast.Now Sharrock is here, the world will come to its senses, and freedom will prevail!No!We cannot have freedom!Things must not change, I said angrily, For what we have achieved here is precious beyond all          measure: it is equilibrium.And Sharrock stood up; and his eyes shone with fury; and spittle came from his mouth when he spoke, so great was his wrath.Sai ias, hear this!said Sharrock, and I knew I was in for a poetic rant; a common foible amongst battle worshipping warriors.I have come to know you Sai ias, and I know your heart is full of love, said Sharrock, with his usual withering condescension;          oblivious to the fact I am old and wise, and large enough to keep him in my mouth for years on end and yet not notice his          presence when I dined.And yet you are a fool, Sharrock continued; and his voice had a rich timbre, as if he were addressing a hall of drunken          wastrels who needed to be inspired to commit acts of glory.You allow yourself to be used by these monsters, these Kaun!You preach obedience; but that is just servitude.You teach acceptance; but that is just another way of making slaves more docile.And worst of all, you all        I was bored by now; so I picked him up with one tentacle and shook him as a child shakes a toy that has lost its rattle in          the hope it might yet make some kind of rattling noise.Eventually I dumped Sharrock on the ground.He was dazed, winded, dizzy, and began vomiting profusely.All the biped slaves on this world, I told him coldly, volunteered to be so.They prefer it that way.You may despise that          decision, but you will respect it.Or else, I shall carry you to the valley of the Kindred myself; and watch as they bind          and shackle you and put a whip to your back!This was an idle threat, in fact; for, however much he vexed me, I could never be so cruel to him; but I hoped that Sharrock          would not realise that.Sharrock finally managed to get back to his feet.He staggered a little, getting his balance back.He spat the last of the          vomit from his mouth.His eyes were out of focus, and he was in shock; but his body was, I knew, resilient, and he would recover          swiftly.Yet though he was now standing, he did not seem to me to stand as tall as before.And when his eyes refocused, they had lost          their piercing stare.Why would anyone, he asked, with a bafflement like that of a child discovering that her parents are fallible,  choose to live as a slave?I had no answer to give him.The Days passed.Day the First.Day the Second.Day the Third.Day  Come, said Lirilla, and I came.I found Sharrock in the centre of the grass amphitheatre.He was unconscious; one arm was ripped and bloody; there were savage          sword wounds in his torso; and both his eyes had been gouged out.Fray stood by, scratching the ground with her hooves.What happened?I asked, after a few moments of feeling overwhelmed with sorrow.The aerials called me, said Fray.They found his body high on a mountain crag.I clambered up, and carried it here.I touched my tentacle tip to Sharrocks throat; no pulse.I lifted his body up with one tentacle and put it in my mouth.And I breathed in through my spiracles, and out through my          mouth; in; out; in; out; filtering the air so that all that remained in my mouth cavity was pure oxygen.Then I spat Sharrock out gently.His body twitched; his blood was oxygen rich now.His heart had started beating.Can you heal his body?I said to Fray, and Fray grunted an affirmative, and stood up on her huge back legs; and began to          piss upon Sharrocks bloodied body.Fray drank every day from the well of the water of life, and her piss was running clear;          so I knew this was the best way to heal Sharrock.And after a few moments stupefaction, he realised that that Fray was pissing on him.And Sharrock groaned, and sat up, and tried to dodge the torrent of healing urine; but in his confused state, he turned the          wrong way, and his eyes and nostrils and mouth took the brunt of the cascade of hot, steaming Fray piss.No need to thank me, said Fray, in her kindest tones.It took Sharrock two days to recover sufficiently to speak.When he did, though blind and scarred, he was unrepentant.You fought the Kindred?I asked.Indeed, I fought those wretched, cowardly, viler than a Southern Tribesman Kindred, he said, proudly.And lost?I concede that I lost, said Sharrock proudly, yet I was not defeated.For Sharrock will never ever EVER be defeated!I sighed, from my tentacle tips.Did you learn nothing, I said acidly.From your experience with the arboreals?Yes, said Sharrock.I learned that monkeys shit a lot when theyre up trees; you really have to keep your wits about you.You learned that revenge is futile!I roared.That was the lesson.That was why My people, said Sharrock, are in captivity.Its up to me to save them.Even if they dont want to be saved?I asked him, nastily.Even then, said Sharrock proudly; and his nobility, and his courage, revolted me.Come, said Lirilla, and this time I found Sharrock in the desert; stripped naked and baking in the sun.The Kindred had          cut off his ears and his eyelids, and carved strange inscriptions on his bare flesh from head to toe.His red skin was burned          and blistered by the suns rays; and he was parched, and croaking.And his eyes, so recently healed, were now blinded once more by the suns rays; yet even so, there was about him a look of          triumph.Come, said Lirilla, and once more I came.I found Sharrock this time in the encampment of the Kindred.His body was broken and bloodied; his teeth had been smashed          out; he had lost one eye (those poor eyes!).And I began to seriously wonder if his body could continue to regenerate after these tremendous beatings; it was taking him longer and          longer to return to his full warrior strength after each appalling defeat.But today, I realised, he was surrounded by scores of kneeling Kindred; who were offering him obeisance.I looked around.The slaves were no longer in shackles.They were free.And Gilgara, the giant Kindred Chieftain, was on the ground; blood flowed from a terrible cut in his head; and no one paid          him any heed.There was a slow thundering noise; a clapping; the Kindred were saluting Sharrocks triumph in what had evidently          been a long, and bloody, and brutal unarmed combat between Sharrock and Gilgara, the leader of the Kindred.What has happened here?I asked, amazed.I am now, said Sharrock proudly, King of the Kindred.It was a hard fought battle, bragged Sharrock.It was indeed, sire, said Gilgara, the former Kindred leader, who was now, despite his appalling injuries which made it          so hard for him to walk, Sharrocks loyal second in command.Picture the scene, said Sharrock dramatically, there was I!I was I do not, I said dryly, wish to picture the scene.Big fight; lots of blood; you won.I bested the Kindred leader in single combat!And why does that qualify you to be the leader?I said angrily.Sharrock was flummoxed.It proves I am the mightiest It proves you are the best at hurting!Thats all.The best at brawling with a stick or sword or with bare fists.Does that make you a leader?I was so enraged,          my cape became erect and my body inflated.Yes, said Sharrock.And next, I shall unify the tribes.There are bipeds like myself living at the foot of the Further          Mountains who do not acknowledge Gilgaras authority, but rather serve the tribes of renegade and nomadic Kindred.I will go and fight          these nomad giants and make them honour my leadership, and then free those slaves too.You would do that?I must, said Sharrock.I had nothing more to say to him.By now, I was nursing a terrible rage.I had helped this creature, comforted him when he was vulnerable; and now he was aiming          to become a dictator.But what could I do to stop him?The answer was: nothing!Unless of course I was willing to challenge him to a battle, and          fight and defeat him.For then he would be compelled to bend to my will.And this of course, I could do easily; so easily it was laughable.For all his warrior pride, Sharrock was utterly puny and          minuscule compared to me.I could defeat him with a single blow, or swallow him like an insect, or crush him and smash him          under my feet whilst barely noticing he was there.But I would never be willing to fight Sharrock.For I was fond of him.I thought of him as a friend.And I could not bear          to hurt him.And, too, I was fearful that in the heat of battle, I might end up hurting Sharrock so severely that he could not heal, and          he would end up crippled or even dead.For violence is a madness; once you allow it to possess you, it is not easy to return          to the ways of sanity.And this was why I had, so many years ago, forsworn violence.After my two ghastly combats with Carulha, I had resolved never          again to use brute force to achieve my goals.I had been a monster twice; I would not be so a third time.Hell Ship           Sharrock Fifty Kindred maidens came to me in the night, longing to possess my body; despite their giant size, they were beauteous indeed.But I sent them all away.Ten warriors challenged me the next day, before I had broke my fast, and I declined them all.One of them sent a sly arrow          aimed at my head and I was only just swift enough to snatch it from the air and smash his skull.I was, in truth, not much enjoying my life as King of the Kindred.I had many responsibilities; underlings constantly pestered          me for decisions about matters of which I knew nothing, and cared less; and all in all, I never had a moment to myself.I          felt as if I had inadvertently adopted a country full of needy children.And I yearned for my days as a nomad with a loyal          wife and a small family, who would happily fend for themselves whilst I went off adventuring.Sai ias was avoiding me now, I knew, and I regretted that sorely.For I had come to enjoy her company, despite her ghastly          appearance and her vexing habit of sighing through her tentacles to betoken annoyance at me.And I did furthermore comprehend          her unease; she feared no doubt I was becoming a dictator.Ha!No thought was further from my mind!Power for me was like          sobriety for a Southern Tribesman; a state of being to be temporarily, and only briefly, endured.I also saw the power of Sai iass argument about the need for us to avoid violence whilst upon this already violent world.For if we kept fighting with each other, how could we ever hope to fight and vanquish the Kaun?And yet I had been impelled to act.And as a result of my actions, there were no more slaves in my Kingdom.All the bipeds          were now free.Free?Whilst the Kaun kept us confined in this unnatural habitat?Yes, that irony did indeed trouble me.But I had done all I could.Gilgara joined me after I had broke my fast that morning, and when I went tramping in the mountains, he followed me like a          limping shadow.He was pathetically devoted to me now.I had beaten him in combat so I was his master; that was the way          the Kindred thought.It was however, I had to concede, an impressively well organised society.Instead of retreating to dismal cabins at night,          the Kindred had used hull metal tools to carve caves out of the smooth rocks of the artificial mountains; and they had installed          artificial lights in each of these caves.Stories were told there; private caves were set aside for sexual congress; the larger          caves were even decorated with artwork in what I recognised as a nave style; though abstract coloration was also a favoured          mode.The variety of biped species here was dazzling and extraordinary, but the physical similarities between the different species          also startled me.The females all had breasts with nipples and haired love niches (and since I was King, they often flaunted          them at me) and loved to discuss the minutest details about the characters of others.Whereas the males all had cocks; and          walked with a swagger; and wore groin hides and capes and boots of hues which almost but did not quite match.The numbers          of eyes varied, but all the smaller bipeds, and the Kindred too for that matter, had mouths and tongues and feet and hands          and ears.Some creatures however had healed up holes on their bellies where their mothers cord had been cut, which I found          exceeding strange.I found many of the females attractive, but did not sleep with any.I found the males highly annoying; they were all so competitive, and whiny.And I realised I was missing the company of the          giant sentients.Cuzco was a monster, but he was magnificent nonetheless.And Fray was a brute, but she inspired an awe in          me, especially when she ran; that, to me, was true poetry.And Sai iaswell.She was like no other creature I had ever met          before.But I had chosen my destiny; to teach the Kindred to respect the rights of others.And to forge the smaller bipeds into a          proud and free and unified community of individuals loyal to a common cause.If only the bastards werent so irritating.For the Kindred were by instinct and nature supreme bullies.And the idiot smaller bipeds had actually chosen to enslave themselves!These stupid less pride than a warrior who fucks his own scabbard creatureshow could they have done such a thing?And yet, I supposed, in some ways the state of slavery simplified matters.For if you are a free spirit like myself, you will          be constantly challenging the way things are.But when the world is intolerable, and life is irrevocably unjust; might it be better, perhaps, to just blindly serve?I could never pursue such a course myself of course.Nor could I truly condone the actions of these self deluded fools.But          in a curious way, I found I had acquired a sliver of compassion for my fellow bipeds and their frailties.I was soul pacing restless though.I had fought and lost and fought and lost and finally fought and won a glorious battle;          and now there were no more battles to fight.I thought again about the biped slaves still living at the foot of the Further Mountains.I had told Sai ias I would liberate          them, and I resolved to do so; because at least that would give me an excuse to leave the village for a while.So I said my farewells; icily endured the tears of maidens I had not bedded, and who did not even have the same number of          eyes as I did; and spent several hours persuading Gilgara not to follow me, before eventually breaking his stick and leaving him behind.Then I set out across the mountain trail, alone, except for my newly acquired hull metal sword and my turbulent thoughts.The winds were cold as I walked higher up the mountains.I killed a grazer and skinned it and used its hide as my cape.And          I carried the flayed body on my shoulder so I could sleep in the carcass during the icy black night when, as I knew, the heating          was always switched off.Thus encumbered, I climbed up to the highest peak, and looked down at the strange unnatural world of the Hell Ship.I was          breathing heavily now; my muscles were singing with exertion; I felt happier than I had been for some time.Then I slept the night inside the grazer upon the peak.And in the morning, I descended, bloody and smelly but pleasingly          well rested.And after several hours of searching I found the settlement in the shadow of the Further Mountain ranges, where          the nomad Kindred and their biped slaves dwelled.And then I saw that bitch.Hell Ship           Sai ias Come, said Lirilla, and I wearily got up, and began flinging myself through the air with my tentacles.This time I came upon Sharrock before the battle had begun.He had indeed, as he had pledged, journeyed to the bipeds who          lived at the foot of the Further Mountains, whose high snowy peaks loomed above our nearer mountain ranges.And now he was          engaged in single combat with a mighty Kindred femaletwice the size of Sharrock himself and massively muscled, her long red          hair streaked with silver, and as skilled at he in combat with a sword.Her Kindred allies had gathered round to watch, with their biped slaves sulkily stood beside them.All cheered as Sharrock          and the female clashed swords, and leaped, and rolled, with grace and speed and awesome energy.They were well matched; the female warrior was larger and stronger but Sharrock was fast and nimble and able to leap high          in the air whilst wielding his sword.Blades clashed so hard together I could see sparks; and the bodies of the two warriors          spiralled in the air as they somersaulted around each other; their blades lashing and slashing as they dodged and rolled and          stepped back and lunged forward in a coruscating display of martial prowess that would have been beautiful if it werent so          godsforsakenly        CHILDISH!Enough, I yelled, and seized each of them in a tentacle.Let me down, screamed Sharrock, and hacked at me with his sword.Let me down, screamed the female and hacked at me with her sword.I roared; and spat webbing in their faces; and they fell to the ground, bound and helpless.A killing rage had come upon me; I yearned to smash them into pieces.The rage passed.Let us talk, I said.In the shadow of the snowy mountains, the female warriorwho I had by now recognised as Zala, the only female Kindred with          such red and silver hairand Sharrock confronted each other; while I placed my body between them.Tell me why you fought this female, I said to Sharrock.And Sharrock told the tale: As you know, he said, I fought the giant Gilgara.Nobly he Just the facts, I said.I defeated him, Sharrock synopsised sulkily, freed my people; and then sought out the renegade Kindred who dwelled at the          foot of these mountain.And I gave them my terms; release your slaves and we will live in harmony.Hes insufferable, isnt he?I said to Zala.He is indeed, she concurred.To state my case: we acknowledge no master; we broke free of Gilgara many cycles ago.We are          free.But your bipeds are slaves, pointed out Sharrock.Well, yes.And I bested you in combat, therefore I was winning, you shit eyed bastard!Sharrock, Ive heard enough.Zala, tell your tale.I have no tale to tell; I do not answer to monsters such as you.I have said what I must say; the slaves will be freed, I demand it!roared Sharrock.And as for this bitch, this evilI          cannot find a word for one so fuckingshe has to die!Her presence cannot be tolerated!For she tried to kill me!Never had          I seen Sharrock so dementedly enraged; which was indeed remarkable, since demented enragement had been his commonest mood          during his early days on the Hell Ship.You shameless liar!Zala replied, with evident astonishment.You attacked me!I was merely defending myself!Not here, said Sharrock, calming himself visibly.Not on this pathetic excuse for a planet.On my home world.She was part          of the invading army.She serves the Kaun.There was an appalled silence; and ruefully I acknowledged to myself that I had always known this day would come.For I had recognised, of course, from Sharrocks account of his battle with the female alien on Madagorian, the red and silver haired          Kindred Zala.Do you deny it?Sharrock accused.Zala laughed.No, I do not deny it.I have no recollection of such a battle; but it may well be as you say.For I have fought,          I will not deny it, many times in the service of the Masters of this Ship.Sharrock looked at me in triumph.You see?he said savagely.She fights for the demons who control this ship; she was a warrior in the invasion and slaughter          of my world!I know, I said.There was a terrible silence.You know?said Sharrock, more stunned than if I had smote his skull with an axe.Yes.It is the way of this world: all of us know that the Kindred serve the Kaun.It is why there are so many of them; they          are ruled by the Kaun, and they in turn rule us.Sharrock seemed to have lost the power of speech.He looked at Zala and tried to spit at her with contempt; but his mouth          was too dry, and all he managed was an ugly croak.How could this be?Sharrock said faintly, his eyes radiating accusation and hatred.We are soldiers; we serve, said Zala, but there was shame in her eyes.You should also know, I explained to Sharrock, that I collaborate with the Kindred on a regular basis.That is how order          is achieved on this world; the Kaun speak to the Kindred, the Kindred speak to me.Sharrock stared at me with horror.Collaborate in what way?Information.Discipline.The training of the new ones, and, if necessary, if they fail to settle into our world, their execution.I spoke calmly, but inside my spirit was quaking with anxiety; I knew Sharrock was going to take this badly.You are the lick cock of these craven giants?said Sharrock.That is not how I would Oh Sai ias, said Sharrock, and my souls fire was quenched by his cold disdain.You are indeed, said Zala to me, our lick cock; a phrase well chosen.And she smiled, not pleasantly.I bowed my head submissively; for one of the conditions of serving the Kindred was to comply with their strict etiquette of          submissive behaviour.If you say so, Zala, then I will agree that the phrase is apt, I agreed courteously.And now that Gilgara is gone, added Zala.Indeed!I yield to your authority, mistress, I said swiftly.Zala smiled.Her look of triumph encompassed both me and Sharrock.Serve me well, beast, said Zala arrogantly.And she departed.There was a prolonged and horrifying silence.Sharrocks unblinking blue eyes were like ice.How could you, Sai ias?Sharrock said to me.His voice was calm, which filled me with foreboding.If not me, then it would be someone else, I explained.Once it was a beast called Carulha; when he died, I took over his          role, and his responsibilities.And why did you not tell me all this?Before I conquered Gilgara and assumed chieftainship of the Kindred?asked Sharrock          savagely.It did not for a moment occur to me, I admitted, that you could win.Sharrock was silent for a long time.I waited.You are a traitor, Sharrock concluded finally, in the quietest of tones.Sharrock, I explained, you cannot To deal with them, those evil conquering bastards, to do their bidding, that is truly        You have to be pragmatic about TRAITOR!Sharrocks red face was redder still; his rage hit me like a punch.I do what I have to do, I said, wretchedly.And Sharrock drew his hull metal sword from his scabbard in the blink of an eye; and he struck me with it in my face.The          blow barely registered for me, but even so I flinched.He struck me again, and again, hammering his sword against my carapace, my skull, jabbing my eyes, trying to hurt me and break          flesh but failing.Eventually he was too exhausted to lift his arm.He threw the sword down on the ground.Then he walked away.Sharrock did not return to the Valley, nor did he have any further dealings with the Kindred.And from that day on, he refused to speak to me.Hell Ship           Jak It was one of those days.I was leading the crew in an emergency drill.We performed a mock evacuation, with all five officers and ten ordinary crew          members in spacesuits.A year had passed since the extermination of the FanTangs; I was Jak the Explorer now, no longer Trader          Jak.One by one the crew filed into pods and the pods broke away from the main ship and vanished into uncertain space.I shared a pod with Albinia and Darko, an engineer.You know this would never happen in real life, said Darko, dourly.If          a missile ever got past our shields, wed be dead.Break away, I said, and Darko hit the switch and the pod broke away from the main ship.As we spiralled around weightlessly, Albinias hair lifted from her head in a halo.She looked at me.Just looked.Galameas voice came through to me via my murmur link implant.All pods detached, in fourteen point two minutes.Drill is over, return to the main ship.We re entered real space, still spiralling around, with a clear view of Explorer through our window.She looked eerily beautiful.Albinia was weeping.I apologise Star Seeker, can I help?said Drago, in terrified tones.Its like being outside myself, said Albinia, as she looked at Explorers exterior hull.I was dining alone, and a tray crashed on the table next to mine.Can I join you?Albinia said.Please do, I said, startled.Albinia slid into place beside me.I have a favour to ask, she said, in very quiet tones.I would be honoured, I replied gallantly.You dont know what Im going to ask.Id be honoured anyway, I insisted.She looked vexed.Have I offended you, Mistress She waved a hand; I silenced my own rhetoric.And then Albinia sat there, looking anxious, for quite some time.What?I coaxed.I would like to be your friend.I nodded.And smiled, graciously, savouring the gift of her presence, and the nearness of her sublime intellect.And then: What?I asked, baffled.Will you?Be my friend?Um.Yes.Of course I will.I was sweating now.This was indelicate beyond all measure.Friendship is the rarest gift a woman          may offer to a man; and for a Star Seeker to suggest it so openly to a mere Ships Master was unheard of.Good.Thats wonderful.And she beamed, like a child that has a toy that can talk back.And indeed, Im flattered beyond all measure that you asked, I said.Good.Yes, it is good.What do we do now?Albinia said hopelessly.I smiled my most charming smile.Well, I could tell you some stories of my days as a Trader.The duplicitous aliens; the          magnificent deals!Or, if you prefer, I could tell you about the time I met the Empress, in my days at the Home Court, or        You want to tell me stories?Welltheyre good stories, I said, defensively.And thats what friends do?Not really, I admitted.Friends, well.Friends take each other for granted.Interrupt each other.Give each other crap,          forget each others birthdays, then make impossible demands at the worst possible moments.I could never treat you like that, Mistress!Albinia started weeping; I was utterly confused.I did say yes, to your generous and extraordinarily kind offer, I apologised.Are you afraid of me, Jak?Of course not, I lied, fluently.You are.Well Albinia got up and walked away.I was utterly bewildered.But one thing was clear to me.I had totally fucked that one up.Couldnt we just shadow flit into the cave?asked Morval.We have to make a good first impression, I told him.A canoe?Just row, I said.The three Olaran canoe bearing myself, Morval and Phylas skimmed fast along the viscous waters.The sky was dark with purple          clouds, and the only trace of sun was a faint glow behind the largest swirl of cloud formations.It was raining.On this planet,          it always rained.The Klak Klak that was leading us surfaced and its many claws klak klakked.We looked ahead and saw the cave entrance.I hate caves, said Morval.How come?I have a fear of small dark confined spaces, Morval admitted.My simulacrum was once buried alive and the remote link failed.I spent a year under the earth before they found a way to          wake me up.Thats nothing, snorted Phylas.On my first Explorer mission, I was flogged and sprayed with salt water and Commander Galamea          refused to wake me because she thought the aliens were just playing with me.Bitch.She is a hard woman, without a doubt, Phylas admitted.How many times have you been killed by aliens, Morval?I asked.Thirty, forty thousand times, admitted Morval.Ive only been killed sixty four times, I said.Thats because youre just a Trader, Morval said.You have the easy job, Phylas added.We do the hard stuff.Prepare the way.Fornicatory traders.Take all the glory.Earn all the money!Will you quit fornicatoryishly whining?I told them.We carried on rowing, an even steady stroke that sent the canoe flying above the sticky red waves of the planets ocean.Our boat penetrated deep into the complex of caves.Stalactites made of precious gems dangled down.Fish bumped the underside          of our canoe and a few of them leaped in and were killed by Phylass energy gun.The smell of burning fish flesh became intolerable.The narrow waterway through the cave complex began to broaden, and we emerged into a high damp cavern.Thick black tubes dangled          from the rock, forming complex shapes, like a latticework.Artworks, suggested Phylas.Excrement, was Morvals opinion.Rock formations, I suggested.The canoe ran aground on the rocks and we stepped out.We were wearing full body armour, even though we were in shadow self form.The armour had been sprayed jet black and decorated          with bumps and spikes, to make us seem more attractive to the crustacean type entity that was the Klak Klak.There were six of the brutes waiting for us, each with at least twenty arms, and each arm was festooned with vicious claws.The claws klakked in unison like applause at a concert.I walked towards the largest of the Klak Klaks, went on one knee,          and attached a translating device to its chin.Can you understand me?I asked.Yes, said the Klak Klak.We come in peace, I said.No, said the Klak Klak.We wish to trade, I said.No, said the Klak Klak.Do you understand this concepttrade?I asked.No, said the Klak Klak.Is it possible, asked Phylas, for a species to be considered sentient if it only knows two words?The Klak Klaks eyes rose out on stalks and peered at Phylas.Then the eyes retreated into the black carapace again.Yes, said the Klak Klak.Let us show you our treasures, I said.And Phylas stepped forward and opened up his cargo bag.He took out a huge Balla          Pearl and held it in his hand.It glowed lustrously, transforming the dark shadows of the cave into lighter shadows.The Pearl          sang, and the sound was like a females post orgasmic smile on a sunny day.Phylas passed the Pearl to the Klak Klak, who          clutched it in his claw.Then the Klak Klak crushed the pearl and dust dribbled to the ground.Or this, I said, and took out an energy gun.I aimed it at the wall and carved a crude face, with two eyes, a nose, and          a smiling mouth.Then I grinned.Isnt it wonderful?The lead Klak Klak visibly recoiled, stepping back and raising its arms in what in any creatures body language would indicate          horror.Then he and the other crustaceans began to klak klak their claws loudly.The sound was deafening, and ominous.You have, said the leader of the Klak Klaks, hurt our wall.I laughed.Its a wall!I said.Walls cant I broke off.I looked at Phylas.Im on it, said Phylas and took a sentience reading of the walls of the cave that enveloped us.Ah, Phylas eventually concluded.Shit, he added.The wall is alive?I said, and Phylas nodded.Red water trickled down the rocks of the cavern.The black wires dangling from the rock changed colour and became pink, then          started to flash.A terrible low moaning howling sound emerged, as the wall groaned in agony.We didnt realise, I said, and the Klak Klak lunged and ate me.There was a crunching sound as the Klak Klak devoured armour and body and bones.[I woke up. ]Phylas raised his energy gun and incinerated the Klak Klak.Out of the ashes, a shadow stirred.The shadow grew, and became a silhouette.Finally the shadow became me again.Forgive us, I said, for our error.But we come in peace, and we wish to trade.The Klak Klaks starred at us through eyes that stuck out through black armour plating and a terrible silence descended.Maybe we should I began to say.Then there was a cracking and groaning sound.Phylas and I looked up.A trickle of dust slowly drifted down through the air,          forming a haze like a parachute.A terrible wailing sound emerged; it was the rock, baying with pain, declaring its hate for          the two intruders; we needed no translation for the sound was a dagger being plunged through our eardrums.Then the roof crashed down on us.I found myself enveloped in rubble.Boulders bounced off my body.Dust and rocks were everywhere, and in a matter of minutes,          I was trapped under tons of screaming, howling, roaring rock.Not again, muttered Phylas, irritably.[I woke. ]I wrote up my log that night: Negotiations failed after we were buried alive by a sentient cave.These creatures have much we would desire; but the evidence             is they want nothing from us.System placed on the Trading Reserve List, to be reviewed in one hundred years.The missile hurtled through space then teleported and reappeared and exploded an inch from the battleships hull.The image          blurred as the battleships forcefield engaged, and the explosion lit the awesome blackness of space with a red and yellow          fireball.The smaller fighter ships were V shaped and daringly fast and were firing energy beams of some kind at the battleships rear          end; tiny columns of flame erupted from the huge ships side as the en beams struck home.Pinpricks of light in the distance betrayed the locations of fighter craft that had been hit and had expired in a burning          maelstrom.Meanwhile, a new flotilla of space fighting vessels had appeared and was spewing out debris which, I deduced was          explosive.Its kind of beautiful, said Phylas, soulfully.We were in invisible orbit in the planetary system of Xd4322, watching two tribes of the same species attempting to destroy          each other in a series of colossal space battles.The planet is a radioactive shell, the sentients now live on moons and satellites, Morval explained.What savages, I murmured.Perhaps; but do they have anything wed like to buy?asked Commander Galamea, with creditable hard headedness.Bombs?I hazarded.According to our intercepted transmissions, Morval continued, this war has lasted a thousand years.One group of sentients live in the inner solar system, the other group live in the          outer solar system.They are fighting for dominance and the right to own the sun.What do they look like?asked Galamea, and Albinia conveyed an image from Explorers space cameras and projected it in the          air.I studied the image with curiosity.These were diamond headed creatures with no visible eyes or ears or limbs, whose squat          bodies were supported on three powerful legs.How do they play piano?asked Phylas, mockingly.Albinia animated the image; tendrils emerged from the diamond torso and sweet music was heard.They have no musical instruments, explained Phylas, but they sing their own internal organs.Could we trade with them?Galamea persisted.Another missile struck the alien battleship and it split apart.And then, as sentients slowly spiralled out of the ship, the          fighter craft dived in and obliterated the stranded sentients one by one.I doubt it, said Commander Galamea regretfully.Seal off the system.When I was a boy, said Morval, the Olarans only had five planets.Olara, New Olara, Olara the Third, We Miss Olara, and          Far From Olara.In those days, observed Phylas, the Olarans were a sad bunch.My father was on one of the first rift ships.He was a pioneer, one of the greatest of all explorers, Morval bragged.Ive read about him, I said.Back then, said Morval, no one knew if the rifts were stable.Your ship rifted and it might, for all you knew, end up as          random matter, or materialise in some other universe.So the courage of those early explorers was extraordinary.Ive heard it said, said Phylas, thoughtfully, that most of them were volunteers.They went into space exploration for          love, not as a result of, um, a court order.He blushed, filled with shame at his own criminal past.Thats true, Morval acknowledged.My father was an idealist.He believed the exploration of space was one of the greatest          adventures of all time.As do I!I said defensively.Youre just here, said Morval scornfully, because some female broke your heart.Who told you that?I said angrily.Its written, said Morval, all over your soul.I seethed; but could not deny the truth of his words.My father eventually settled, Morval reminisced, in a Trading Post in some far flung galaxy, and never returned to his          family.My mother didnt care; she had married again of course, long before that.And she never spoke of him; all that I know          about my father was gleaned from research.My father, said Phylas, was Then he ran out of words; clearly there was very little to say about his father.I sipped my rich juice; thinking about my own father.I had not really known him all that well, in all honesty.My mother had been the main presence in our family, as was so often          the case with Olarans.He had been an artifice monger; but I could recollect no tales he had ever told about his work.I decided          I had nothing much to add to this particular conversation.Have I ever told you, I said, about the time I tried to sell carpets to the Vengans and  I drank too much that night and went to the Command Hub to look at the stars.On a Vassal Ship I could have used the Observation          Deck and looked into space with my own eyes, but here I had to make do with camera images.Albinia was still wired to Explorer; eyes closed and effectively unconscious.I wondered when she slept, or if this for her          was sleep.I conjured up the phantom control display and flicked through different star charts until I found the night sky of my own          home world, Shangaria.It brought back fond memories; when I was ten years old Id wanted to be an astronomer and spent every          night looking at the stars.My mother used to name them for me; for she knew each star by heart.I wondered if my mother had ever loved my father.There was however no evidence for it.She was a wonderfully self contained          female, and intensely serious; my father had been a funny delightful man, but shed never once laughed at his jokes.Perhaps          that was because they were stupid jokes.I had found them incredibly funny; but then, Id been just a child.After the divorce my father had visited us every weekend and he always had a smile for me.He told me that no Olaran marriage          ever lasts more than twenty years; because females always grow impatient at the intellectual gap between them and their males.Savour it while you can, hed told me, still with a smile.Youve been drinking, said Albinia.Her voice startled me out of my reverie.
