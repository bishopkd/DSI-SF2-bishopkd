He glanced behind him, once, at the silver baseball courier ship, then turned back to the emptiness before him.Sam struggled forward against the pull of acceleration.Any chance they havent spotted us?Dar shrugged.Hard to say.Well show up on their detectors; but they might not pay attention to anything this small.Then the silver slab began to slide toward them.Do they have to be so damn observant?Dar adjusted his chair upright and tromped down on the acceleration pedal.The masseur dumped the steamroller on him again, shoving him back into the chair; he could just barely stretch his arms enough to hold onto the wheel.The silver slab picked up speed.Somehow, I dont think we can outrun them.Dar turned the wheel left; the port attitude jets slackened, then died, as the starboard jets boosted their mutter to a roar, and the lifeboat turned in a graceful U, throwing Dar over against Sam.She sat huddled back in her chair, face pale, eyes huge.No wonder, Dar thought.Hed feel the same way if he were a passenger in a boat he was driving.He straightened out the wheel and held the pedal down, sending the little ship arrowing back toward the courier ship, which was taking advantage of the pirates preoccupation to try to sneak away.Sam struggled forward, adjusting her chair upright, and laid her helmet against his.Shouldnt we be going away from them?Dar shook his head.Theyd have about as much trouble catching us as a lean cat would have with a fat mouse.Our only chance is to hide.Hide?Behind what?Theres nothing out here!A bright red energy bolt exploded just behind them and a little to their right.YEOW!Sam shrank down inside her suit.Hide behind something!Fast!As fast as I can.Dar threw the wheel hard over Sam slammed hard against his side.Whatre you doing?Evasive action.They might get smart and hook that cannon up to a ballistic computer.And Dar proceeded to lay a course that would have given a triple jointed snake double lumbago.They rattled around inside the lifeboat like dice in a cup.Were winning, Dar grated.Weve got it confused.A fireball exploded right under their tail.YEOW!Learns fast, doesnt it?Dar tromped hard on the accelerator and pushed on the wheel.They dived, and a great gleaming curve slid by overhead.Then they were out, with open space before them.Dar pressed down on the deceleration pedal, and threw himself and Sam forward against their webbing.Her helmet cracked against his.Why dont you keep on running?Cause theyd catch us.Dar turned the boat, sent it racing back toward the silver sphere and the slab that loomed over it like a tombstone.Sam stiffened in her seat.Dont ram it!No fear.Blue sparks spattered up all around the courier.I think they just mistook it for us.Then Dar pushed on the wheel again.The lifeboat dived, and the bottom of the silver sphere swam by overhead again.Why?Sam fairly shrieked.Because.The little ship spat out from under the courier, darting across the gap toward the silver slab.Sam took a deep breath.Correct me if Im wrongbut arent we supposed to be trying to get away from them?Yesand we are.The silver slab loomed right above them, so close it seemed they could almost touch it.Dar shoved on the deceleration pedal again, slowing the lifeboat by deft touches till the pitted silver plates above them were almost motionless.There!He sat back and relaxed.Weve matched velocities.With any luck, they wont have noticed us jumping under them; theyll have been too busy taking potshots at the courier.Why wouldnt they notice us?Because it would make a lot more sense for us to be still hiding behind our mother ship.Definitely.Sam glanced up at the pirate with apprehension.Even if they do start looking for us, theyre apt to overlook usunless theyve got their ventral detectors on.Which they probably have.With our luck, of course.But even if they do, they probably wont see uswere too close to their skin, in their detectors shadow.Nice theory.Sam settled back.What happens if youre wrong?Well, in that case, they shoot away from us faster than we can go, leave us sitting here, and play skeet shoot.Now I know why I always sympathized with the clay pigeons.Sam shivered.Whatre they doing?Dar turned around, looking out over the tail.Still trying to shoot through the courier  whup!Whup, what?Sam asked with foreboding.The couriers moving awaystreaking would be more likely.Brace yourselfthe piratesre going after him, and fast!Even damaged, that couriers quick!Sam frowned.Then howd the pirates catch em in the first place?Lurking in ambush.Lurking where?Theres no cover bigger than a hydrogen atom out here!Whup!There they go!Dar spun around and set himself as the silver slab slid away toward their rear.Dar pushed down the acceleration pedal, heading sunwards.We  cant  possibly outrun  them, Sam grated against the pull of acceleration.Not if theyre going  our way, Dar answered.But at the moment  theyre going  out, and were going  in.Why bother?Sam spoke more easily.As soon as theyre done with the courier, theyll come after us.Assuming were big enough to bother with.But by that time, maybe we can find a place to hide.Hide?Where?Wherever they did, while they were lurking  there!Dars forefinger stabbed out, pointing ahead, at a string of pierced diamonds backlit by the sun.Asteroids!They confused the ships detection system; it thought the pirates ship was just a large rock, closer than the others!Sam stared.Whatre they doing here?This is not the time to ask questions.Dar craned around, looking aft.Theyre still going after the courier  theyve overhauled it, theyre gonna fire a warning shot NO!Theyre starting to slow and turn!Sam stared.Why?Because theyre not interested in the courier, obviously!They just took a peek, saw our boats pod was still empty and we were nowhere in sight, and started scanning for us!Sam frowned, shaking her head.I dont get it.You make it sound as though they want us.Guess what?Dar said dryly.What Id like to know is how they knew we were aboard?Maybe they didnt, Sam said hopefully.Maybe they think were somebody else.Youll pardon me if I dont stay around to find out.Dar swerved and jammed the deceleration pedal; the ship bucked as the nose rockets spewed superheated steam, slamming them into their webbing.The shiplet danced and curvetted as Dar tried to avoid the smaller chunks of stone and metal.The ship rang like a cymbal in a percussion solo, but nothing holed them.Dar managed to match velocity with an asteroid a little larger than the lifeboat.The ringing diminished to an occasional dong.So far, were fantastically lucky.Dar killed all power.As long as we dont run into a really fast moving pebble astern, or a slow moving one ahead, were okay.This lifeboats got enough armor to take care of most of the debris.Sam released a long, shaky breath.Taking a bit of a chance, werent you?Dar shrugged.I had a choice?Now, as long as we dont get our engines smashed, were okay.And if we do?So, which would you rather bea prisoner, or an asteroid?Sam frowned.Let me think it over.Sure.Dar leaned back, folding his arms.Youll have plenty of time.The asteroids path had carried them considerably out of the pirates path; the huge silver slab flashed by overhead and well behind them.Just like that?Sam looked about her, puzzled.They just go by and leave us?Wrong, Dar said grimly.They saw us curve off and join the asteroids, you can bet on it.But they couldnt decelerate fast enough to follow uswe do have an edge in maneuverability.Theyll be back, though, dont worry.Thanks for the reassurance.Sam sat very still.Whyd you kill the power?Because at least one of their detectors searches for it.Right now, thats the only thing that makes us different from an asteroid, unless they happen to get close enough to eyeball us.Dont we reflect a lot more light?I chose a bright asteroid to hide next to.Here they come!Sam yelped.Dar poised a finger over the power button.The pirates couldnt hear them, of course, and they both knew itbut the rabbit reflex took over, and they both sat rock still as the silver tombstone drifted slowly over them in a prowling zigzag.It cruised closer, closer, and Dar felt an urge to shove his tiny boat to starboard, to nestle up against the comforting bulk of the asteroid.The pirate zagged to the rightand, as it zigged past them, it was out beyond their covering asteroid.It loomed closer and closer, but slanting away now.It crossed their path a good half mile in front of them, and kept on going.Sam collapsed back against her chair with a sigh.Thank heaven.Yeah.Dar felt himself beginning to tremble as he lowered his finger from the power button.I never thought Id be so glad to be inconspicuous.As long as it worked.Sam eyed him with dawning respect.Dar felt his pulse quickenafter all, she was the only woman for several million miles.Sam stiffened, pointing ahead.Look!Whatre they doing?Dar stared.A giant hatch had opened in the stomach of the silver tombstone.Theyre gonna send down their scout boat for a closer look!Dar lunged at the power button.Sam caught his arm.No!You said that was a dead giveaway!Dar paused, his eyes on the pirate ship.Wait a minute!Theyre thinking it over.A shuttle hung halfway out the huge hatchway, motionless.Then it started to rise back up into the mother ship, and the huge doors swung shut.But why?Dar bleated.They had us dead cold!Thats why!Sam jabbed a finger toward the back window.A huge, truncated pyramid came hurtling toward them.A vast eye seemed to float above it.The pirate ship slid into motion, gathering speed, and streaked away.Dar winced in sympathy.Idve hated tove taken that slap of acceleration  But they didnt have much choice, did they?Why not?Sam stared at the approaching pyramid.What is that megalith?The cops.Dar shrugged.Which ones, Im not surebut it comes out to the same thing.For once, Im glad to see them.Yo!Over here!Whoa!Help!Sam tried to stand up, waving her arms frantically.Damn!Dont they hear us?Sound waves dont travel too well through vacuum, Dar pointed out.I know, I know, Sam groused, dropping back into her seat.Just carried away by the heat of the moment.So are they, Dar noted, watching the police ship zip by.Now what do we do?Get out and walk?Well, presumably were in the Haldane system, since thats where we were going.And at our top speed, it cant be more than three or four months to the nearest habitable planet.I dont think I can wait that long for lunch.Oh, Im sure therere some rations tucked away around here somewhere.But I dont think well have to wait that long.I expect the police ship to be coming back this way pretty soon.Why?Sam frowned.For reinforcements?Oh, they dont need any.Did you see that eye on top of their ship?It is one very powerful blaster.Oh.Sam chewed that one over.That why the pirates ran?Dar nodded.With that eye, the police have the pirates out ranged, no matter how many guns they mount.So whyll the police be coming back?Because the pirate ship also mounts an isomorpher, and I strongly suspect that police ship is purely local.As soon as the pirate goes into H space, the policell be homeward bound.Oh.Sam thought it over.But couldnt the police catch the pirates before they isomorph?They could, Dar said judiciously, but I dont think they will.Those piratesre going to be very good at running.If theyre not, they lose profits.So theyll take risks the police wont.Like going into H space too soon?Thats possible.If you see a big explosion, youll know they tried it.They waited, staring ahead, where the police ship had dwindled to a glint of light.After a while, Sam ventured, I dont think they tried it.A speck of light glinted in the distance.Dars finger sprang out to the power button again.Not yet!Sam cried.We dont know who won!I bet were gonna find out, though.Dar waited, tense.The glint grew into a dot, and kept growing.It became a triangular dot.Victory!Dar stabbed the button, and the engine roared into life.Lets hear it for the good guys!He hauled back on the wheel, and the boat sprang up out of the plane of the ecliptic, toward the police ship.Shouldnt we identify ourselves?So they dont think were attacking?Not as ridiculous as it sounds, Dar said soberly.For all they know, we could be a torpedo.There oughta be some kinda distress beacon around here.See if you can find it, will ya?It was labeled Distress Beacon, and it only had one button.Sam pressed it, and waited.How do we know if its working?she said finally.How do you know God listens?Dar retorted.Its got radio; we dont.Faith, Sam grumbled.Does it always have to come down to that?The pyramid loomed up toward themand disappeared in a cloud of steam.They heard us!Dar yelped.Theyre decelerating!The fog cleared, and the police ship towered over them.Sam shrank back.I cant help itI feel as though its going to fall on me!And it did.The great pyramid sank toward them, giving them a flys eye view of a giant foot.Dar opened his mouth to scream just as a hatch slid open in the huge silver wall above them, swooping down to swallow them up.Saved?someone croaked.Dar wouldve thought it was Sam, but it was coming from inside his own head.Just glad we were nearby.The captain poured two glasses of brandy and held them out to Sam and Dar.His insignia gleamed on the breast of his doubletan eye topped pyramid with Space Police inside it in cursive script.Arcing above it were the words, Hal.IV, and, below it, Falstaff.It stood out in a sea of ocherno, maybe an ocean.The captain was obese, to say the least.So was his crewthe smallest of them was at least four feet around, and all were shorter than Dar.The captain also had the typical Haldane IV face: florid, with long curly hair and a jawline beard.Dar accepted the brandy eagerly, but Sam held up a palm.Thanks, but I dont believe in alcohol.The captain blinked in surprise.I assure you, it exists.We were lucky you were in the neighborhood, Dar said quickly.Well, it wasnt entirely luck, the captain admitted.We have had reports about pirates trying to ambush merchantmen at the H space jump points.But last week a freighter full of pickled herring that was supposed to come through this way, didntso we decided to guard this jump point.We only have this one patrol cruiser, so youll understand that we couldnt guard all the points.And the load of pickled herring was that important?Dar said in surprise.To us, said the captain, its vital.But what brings you to Falstaff, gentlefolk?Falstaff?Dar frowned, puzzled.Its the local name for Haldane IV, Sam explained.Just here to make a connection, Captain.Were inbound from Wolmar.The captain still sat comfortably leaning back, fingers laced across his butterbelly, but suddenly he was all vigilance.Wolmar?Really!How interesting.By the way, could I see your papers?Hm?Oh, sure!Dar slid his passport and ID out of his jacket pocket and laid them on the desk; Sam followed suit.Sorry; we should have thought of that right off.Well, you were a little flustered.The captain picked up their passports and suddenly, illogically, Dar had the insane conviction that the captain had a jewelers loupe in his eye.Everything in orderof course.The last part lacked conviction.The captain slid their papers back to them.We dont get many coming from Wolmar.The traffic does seem to run the other way, Dar agreed.But our pharmaceutical materials companys getting itchy to expand, and were heading back to the inner planets to sound out possible investors.Sam twitched; Dar reflected that he really should have told her about the cover story he was dreaming up.Didnt realize it was getting to be that big a business.The captain seemed genuinely interested.Dar grinned.It may not bebut were sure going to find out.By the way, I was mightily relieved when you noticed our boat so quickly.Were you on the lookout for us?No, not particularly.The captain frowned.Should we have been?Dar sat still for a moment, letting the shock wash through him.Well, he said carefully, I wouldve thought our courier ship wouldve told you we were missing.That is strange, now that you mention it.The captain scratched his head, then looked up.Maybe the pilot didnt notice youd abandoned ship.Uh  could be.Dar thought of how much of a lurch the lifeboat mustve given the courier ship when it blasted free.Of coursenow that I think about it, that must be it.After all, how could the pilot have noticed we were gone?How couldnt heve noticed?Dar raged.When that lifeboat blasted free, it mustve kicked the ship like a foundation anomaly!Maybe he thought it was a blaster bolt, Sam offered.It was a little hectic just then.And he wouldntve checked the passengers when the action was over?Dar shook his head.No.It washes about as well as baked on grease.They were strolling through the downtown section of Haskerville, the capital of Falstaff.The street was wide, but all the buildings had a second story that projected out over the sidewalkconvenient in rainy weather, Dar was sure, but a little depressing on a sunny day.Also, it was a little strange that all the buildings were half timbered and stuccoed.Well, its a frontier planet, I guess, he said aloud.Not reallyits a third of the way back to Terra, and its been colonized for four hundred years.What makes you think so?The architecture.Dar pointed to the wooden beams.Dont they know how to make steel?Oh, they know how, well enough.Sam smiled.I asked about it on my way out here.Seems theres very little free metal on Falstaff.Even the irons all locked up in rust, in the soil.Oh.Dar pursed his lips.So what do I use for money herenails?Sam started, surprised.Howd you guess?Youre kidding!Think so, do you?Well, just try to pay for something with an I. D. E.  BTU credit here.Ill take your word for it.Dar stopped by a storefront, looking up at the sign.I think this is the place were looking for.Maybe they do money changing here.Makes sense, Sam agreed, so probably they dont.They went into the ticket office of Outworld Interstellar Starship Enterprises, Unltd.Help you?the clerk grunted around his sausage, his eyes on the newsfax.He was grossly fat, and jowly, like all the Falstavians theyd seen.In fact, Dar was beginning to feel like a freakhe was slim.Uh, yeah.Wed like to book passage to Terra.Sure thing.The man pulled out two tickets without even looking.Thatll be two hundred pounds.Next ship lifts at fourteen hundred hours, May third.Dar froze with his hand on his wallet.May third!?But its only April fifth!Too bad, isnt it?the clerk commiserated.You just missed the last boattwo days ago.But we cant wait!Weve got to get to Terra fast!The clerk shrugged.I just sell the tickets, buddyI dont schedule the ships.Y want em, or not?Uh, not just yet, thanks.Dar turned to Sam, looking helpless.Do you change money here?she said briskly.The clerk looked up.Money?Yeah, sure!Whacha got?I. D. E.  thermsten of them, Sam said with a meaningful stare at Dar.Oh.The clerk seemed disappointed.Well, well take anything, I guess.Put em up here.He pulled out a small cloth sack and set it on the counter; it clanked.Dar paused with his cash halfway to the counter Whats that?Money, the clerk looked up, frowning.For ten I. D. E.  therms, you get two pounds.Two pounds?Dar bleated, aghast.You must think your pounds worth an awful lot!A pound of ten penny nails?The clerk eyed Dar as if doubting his sanity.Buddy, around here, thats worth a hell of a lot!Oh.Dar glanced at Sam out of the corner of his eye; she nodded.He sighed and laid his bills down on the counter Okay, here you are.Say, uhis there any connection to Terra sooner than next month?Well, if y really wanna know  The clerk leaned forward confidentially.I got this buddy, see, an hes got an inside track on this nice, used space yacht  Uh, thanks anyway.Dar took a step back.I, uh, havent done all that much piloting lately.Sam bit the inside of her cheek.Oh.The clerk leaned back with a look of disgust.No high grade, huh?Well, suit yourself.He turned back to the newsfax.Uh, yeah.Dar scooped up the moneybag.Well, uh, get back to you.You an what miner?But the clerk lifted an affable hand anyway.Good luck, chum.Well, he tried to sound friendly, I suppose, Dar said as they came out of the office.Not really.Around here, chum doesnt mean friendit means fishbait.The garbage kind.Oh.Dar frowned.What was all that stuff about high grade?And why would we come back with a miner?The kind who digs up ore, Sam explained.High grade ore.Dar glanced at her, but she wasnt smiling.He shrugged.Really serious about this iron thing, arent they?A ground car went past, hissing steam from its turbine.The body was wooden; the boltheads were plastic.Very, Sam agreed.Dars head swiveled, tracking the ground car.What do they make the engine out of?A very high temperature plastic, Sam answered.But I understand theyre short on radios.Dar turned back to her, frowning.That does require metal, doesnt it?But how does the newsfax work?Optical fiber cables; theyve got no shortage of silicon.And it can print by heat transfer.Dar shook his head, flabbergasted.Well, at least they dont have traffic jams.Sausage, sir?inquired a rotund pushcart proprietor.Dar stopped, suddenly realizing that darn near every passerby had a sausage in his mouth, chewing placidly.Well, I guess I shouldnt look out of place.Yeah, well take two.He fished in his moneybag, and brought out    a large nail.He looked up at Sam, horrified.She frowned, and nodded toward the peddler, who was holding out two sausages on a scrap of plastic.Dar stared from her to the hotdogs and back.Then he shrugged, took the sausages, and dropped the spike in the peddlers palm.He turned away, with two three penny nails and a brad for change.What do they do around here when the Revenue Service comes calling?They pay their tacks, like honest citizens.Whats the matter?Culture shock?Dar shook his head.Couldnt be; I cant find the conductor.Around here, Sam said slowly, I think thats some kind of political office.You need a drink.Good idea.Dar nodded numbly.I used to favor a cocktail called a rusty nail.On this planet, thats an obscenity.Sam steered him through a swinging door.I think youd better have an old fashioned.I think I already have, Dar muttered.The tavern was dim, in the best tradition of alcohol stations.They stepped up to the bar.Orderzh?Orderzh?the bartender slurred, blinking.Uh, an old fashioned and a martinus.Sam seemed fascinated by the blinking.Two bitsh.The bartender pushed buttons.Dar laid down a ten penny nail.Two from a ten pin, the bartender muttered.Its hand sucked up the nail; a door in its chest slid open, and ejected two glasses of clear liquid and one glass of amber.It rolled away down the bar to the next customer, leaving two flat head screws and a drill behind it.Id count your change, if I were you, the patron two stools down advised.He wore a dark brown robe belted with a length of coaxial cable; the crown of his head was shaved in a neat circle.The yellow handle of a small screwdriver peeked from his breast pocket.That bartender isnt too reliable today.I thought his lights werent blinking in the right pattern!Sam said triumphantly.Whats the matter with him?Youd have to say hes drunk, I suppose, the shave pate answered.You see, the tavernkeeper couldnt afford wire for his conductors, so he had to use tubes of saline solution.Well, that means the bartender has to have a little fluid added every morning, and it seems someone spiced his morning pickup with metallic salts today.That increased conductivity, of course, and threw all his circuits off.Which is why I got two when I only ordered one.Oh, well.Sam shrugged and took a sip.I should gripe?Sounds like an expensive prank, for this neck of the woods, Dar commented.No, not really.Its free metal thats in short supply on Falstaff.Compounds are plentiful.You seem to know quite a bit about it.Dar held up his glass and peered through it warily.From your clothing, I wouldve thought you were a friarbut you talk like an engineer.Im both, really.The stranger grinned and held out a hand.Father Marco Ricci, O. S. V. , at your service.Dar Mandra.Dar shook his hand.And this is Sam Bine.Whats O. S. V. ?The Order of Saint Vidicon of Cathode,  the friar answered.Were a society of Roman Catholic engineers and scientists.Oh, yeah.I should have recognized it.The chaplain on our transport was one of your boys.They frequently are.Father Marco nodded.The Church tends to assign Cathodeans who specialize in astronautics to such jobsits one more protection in case of a malfunction.Yeah, makes sense.Dar nodded, and his training in Chollys bar took over.If youll pardon me, thoughisnt that something of a paradox?What, having a priest whos a scientist?Not really.Any conflict between science and religion is simply the result of clergy who dont understand science, and scientists who dont understand religion.Wouldnt a scientist religious tend to be a bit skeptical about both?Indeed he would.The priest grinned.The Vaticans habitually annoyed with uswe tend to keep asking new questions.Then, why do they let you keep going?Because they need us.Father Marco shrugged.Even the Vatican has plumbing.Well, I can see that.Dar sipped.But why would the church ever declare a maverick like one of you a saint?Oh, youre thinking of our founder.Father Marco nodded.Well, they hadnt much choice, there.It was very clearly a case of martyrdom.That gives you quite a record to live up to, Sam noted.Oh, we dont plan to be martyrs, Father Marco assured them, and Im sure our founder would approve.After all, he was the practical sortand a live priest can usually accomplish far more than a dead one.Dar wondered about the usually.Well, we have a bit of a practical problem ourselves, at the moment, Fatherand you seem to be familiar with the planet.But not nativeas Im sure you could tell by my size.Father Marco was only a little on the stout side.Yes, and thats our problemwere not native, and we would like to get on with our trip.And the last freighter left orbit a few days ago.Father Marco nodded.Well, Im afraid theres not much you can do just nowespecially with the I. D. E.  police sealing off the planet.Doing what?Sealing off the planet, Father Marco said mildly.You hadnt heard?It was on the newsfax just a few minutes ago.The Interstels had a reliable tip that a telepath came in on the last ship, so theyve forbidden anyone to leave the planet while they search for him.Well, Sam said slowly, that does kind of delay us, doesnt it?Dar frowned.Whats this telepath done?Father Marco shrugged.Nothing, so far as I know.At least, nothing was said about it.Then, why are they searching for him?You dont know?Father Marco asked in mild surprise.Why, telepaths are a menace to everything any right thinking citizen holds sacredhavent you heard?Something of the sort, yes, Sam admitted.We didnt know it was exactly a widely held belief.Oh, its been all the rage for at least a month!Telepaths invade other peoples privacy, you seeyou can never tell when one might be reading your mind.You could make laws against that, but thered be no way to enforce themunless you had telepathic police; and if you did, theyd probably side with their fellows.Those telepaths stick together, you know.No, I didnt, said Dar.In fact, I didnt know there were anywell, almost.He remembered the Wolman shaman.Ah, you see?Father Marco wagged a forefinger at him.Youve known at least one person who always seemed to know what you were thinking.So has everyone, of course.Of course!Who doesnt have someone who knows them really well?It could be that, the priest said judiciously.But when that person always seems to be one jump ahead of youwell, you naturally tend to wonder.Because telepaths use what youre thinking against you, you seethey have an unfair advantage in the competition of life.They always know what youre going to do, so they always know how to head you off.Thats horrible!Isnt it just?But it gets worse.The I. D. E.  police are reasonably sure that telepaths all over the Terran Sphere are getting in touch with one another, forming a society of their own, conspiring to overthrow the government and take over.But how?Sam frowned.Couldnt the police intercept their messages?Intercept a message from one mind reader to another?Hardly.Besides, rumor has it that these telepaths dont even need to get on a starship to get a message from one planet to another.What?Thats the word.Father Marco nodded.Their thoughts travel from star to star almost instantaneously.You can see that would give their conspiracy a bit of an advantage over the forces of society.Yes, I certainly can.Dar leaned a little closer and lowered his voice.And do I gather from your tone, Father, that you dont quite believe all this?Father Marco leaned over.Frankly, I think its the biggest pot of rotten incense Ive ever smelled!What I cant figure out, Sam put in, is why people would get so worked up about something that probably doesnt even exist.Well, its been known to happen before, Father Marco said judiciously.Mass hysteria is never that far beneath the skin, I suppose.A human being is a thinking animal, but crowds dont seem to be.So I suppose its just as well that the police are taking action, even though theyre probably acting only on the strength of a rumor.Rumor?Dar frowned.How so?Tips are usually hearsay, I gather.Nonetheless, better to act on a rumor than to risk a riot.Riot?Sam protested.Youve got to be joking.Unfortunately, Im not.If the people didnt know the authorities were on the lookout, they might try to do something on their ownthen all itd take would be one whisper that so and so was a telepath, and youd have a full scale witch hunt to deal with.No, its better that   Do you mind?A portly gentleman had huffed up from a nearby table.Am I in your way?Father Marco said politely.No, but youre upsetting my party quite a bit!If you must insist on discussing politics, would you please have the courtesy to do it in your own quarters?Its in frightfully poor taste, and its ruining my digestion!Oh!Dar exchanged a look with Father Marco.My apologies, citizen.Of course, if were offending   Youll keep right on!A skinny hand clapped Dars shoulder like a pincers.Ay, give offense!Bother the lazy hogs out of their trough!Goad them into doing somethinginto living, for Lords sake!He was a short, lean, aging man, who looked to be as hard as a meteorite and as merry as a comet.And next to him   Dar stiffened, eyes widening.Next to the old man stood the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, with the body of Venus outlined by a flowing, sleeveless, calf length gown that clung to every curve.Her face was comprised of a high, smooth brow, delicate eyebrows; large, wide set eyes heavily lidded; a small, tip tilted nose; and a mouth with a hint of a smile that promised delights and challenged him to seek them.Tawny hair rippled down to her waist.It was the face from the dreams of his boyhood, the face that he had never thought could be, the face that could never let the grown man rest.The unfairness of it hit him like a stilettothat she should be with that old geezer, instead of with him!The old geezer was turning on the portly indigestion case, who had made some outraged noises.And Ill thank you to let your remarks go public!Dont you know what happens to people who wont talk politics?They stop caring about their government!And do you know what happens when they stop caring?One night, some sneaky, unprincipled scoundrel sneaks in and changes their government on them!And the next morning, they wake up and find their taxes are as high as their collarbones, and they cant go anyplace without a permit, and, taken all in all, theyre not much better than slaves!And thats what happens when you keep your remarks to yourself!Sir!The fat one recoiled as though hed stepped on slime.This is obscene!Id rather be obscene, and not absurdbut since you seem to think the other way, I think my friends and I had better go look for some fresher air!He turned to Father Marco, Dar, and Sam.How about it, oh ones with spirit?Youll find a breeze blowing by the stage thats amazingly fresh!Were going down there, my niece and Ijoin us, if youre up to it!And he turned away, limping between the tables in a rush, as though life would get away from him if he didnt hurry to catch it.The girl turned to follow himand did her gaze linger just a moment on Dar?Imagination.Had to be.But   She was only his niece!Huh?What?His head snapped around toward Father Marco.I said, shall we join them?There was a gleam in the priests eye.Uh  yeah.Seem like nice folks.Why not?Sam was a monotone in a frigid face.Its sure to be lively.They got up, with their glasses, and filed after the loud voice on the old legs.Sit down, sit down!The geezer waved them to chairs around a large table as he slid into one himself.His niece sat demurely next to him.So youre a Cathodean, the oldster greeted Father Marco.Whats a live order like yours doing in a dead place like this?Where is a minister of Life more needed than among the moribund?Father Marco countered.Wait a minute.Hold on, there.Dar held up a palm.Back that up a few lines, will you?I think I missed something.What?Howd you know he was a Cathodean?Huh?Why, the emblem of his order, of course!the old man exclaimed.This.Father Marco tapped the tiny yellow screwdriver in his breast pocket.Used to be the sign of an electrical engineerlike a fraternity pin.We just made if official.Oh.Dar pulled his head down, feeling dense.Youve got the advantage of me now, Father Marco informed the geezer.Yeah, I know.The old man grinned wickedly.Aint it great?Grandfather!the vision reproved, and the old man winced (her shoes did have very sharply pointed toes).Well, I cant have everything, he sighed.Im Whitey, Father, and this is Lona, my  niece, he added, with a glare at her.She tried to look chastened.Anything you say, Grandfather.Must you make me feel my age, lass?Whitey sighed.I know you have a fixation about absolute honesty in all the little thingsbut have mercy!I dont ask for muchjust that you call me Uncle when other people are around.Is that so much to ask?Not at all, now that they know the truth.She gave the rest of the company a dazzling smile, and lied, Hes my uncle.Glad to meet him, Dar muttered, his eyes on Lona.Father Marco cleared his throat and stretched out a hand.Im Father Marco Ricci.And this is Dar Mandra, and Sam Bine.Here y are, Whitey.A waiter set a large glass of wine in front of the old man.And you, Lona.Thank you.She accepted the cocktail with a smile that was polite, but warm too, then deliberately turned her eyes away.The waiter hesitated a moment hopefully, then sighed and turned away.Whitey the Wino?Father Marco guessed.Whitey held up his glass in a semi toast and nodded approval.Youre quick.Not really; Ive been hearing about you in every tavern and taproom for the last three parsecs.Glad I finally caught up with you.The name fitted, Dar decided.The old mans hair was stark white, and his eyes were so light a blue that they verged on being colorless.Even his skin had a bleached lookweathered and toughened, as though it ought to have a deep space tan; but he was almost white.And the second name seemed to fit, too.Hed drained half the glass at a gulp.Caught up with me, is it?Whitey grinned.If it werent for the cassock, Id worry.Father Marco grinned too.No, Im not the Revenue Service.Or an angry husband, Lona added.My dear!Whitey protested, wounded.Would I come between a man and his wife?Only if you had a chance to, she murmured, and sipped at her drink.Whitey turned to Father Marco with a sigh of despair.Ah, the cynicism of this latter generation!Are there no ideals left, Father?No faith?I believe in you implicitly, GrandfatherIm just not saying what for.To move around, for one thing, Father Marco said.You dont seem to have stayed on any one planet any longer than I have, Whitey.The Wino nodded.I can take any of these fat, complacent peoples, for just so long.Or they you, Lona murmured.Well, they usually do offer to pay my expenses to the next planet.Im getting a bit restless in my old age, Fathermoving outward, hoping to find a place that isnt sliding down into decadence.Its about time, Whitey.A tallow ketch of a man stopped by the table.And I have to keep finding new audiences.Whitey slid a flat keyboard out of his tunic and stood up.If youll excuse me for a few minutes, folks   Youre the entertainment?Dar said, astonished.Arent I always?he answered.Lona added, Not much security, but its a living.Better than it was in the old days, my dear, Whitey reminded her, before I met your grandmother.I sold narcotics back then, Fathernot entirely legally.Before I saw the lightwhen I went under the name of Tod Tambourin.He turned away toward the stage, following Lona.Sam sat stiff and rigid, her eyes bulging.Thats Tod Tambourin?Couldnt be.But Dar felt a sinking certainty.Great poets dont sing in bars.I can think of a few exceptions.Father Marco leaned back and sipped his drink.Lets judge the product, shall we?The product didnt bear judgment at all.Whitey settled himself on a low stool while Lona slid onto a high one, heels hooked on a rung, knees together, hands clasped in her lap.Whitey struck a rippling crescendo from his keyboard.It filled the room, leaving a moment of silence behind it.Into that silence Whitey pumped a vigorous song which had its roots in the best of the bad old days, a bit of bawdy nonsense about a lady spacer, who was scarcely a lady, and whose interest in space was confined to some interesting spaces.Lona sat through it, amused, joining in on the choruses with almost as much relish as her grandfather.This is the poet laureate of the Terran Sphere?Sam cried, scandalized.Dar felt a trifle disillusioned toobut not in Whitey.The song ended with a rocketing crescendo that sounded like a spaceship taking off.The patrons roared their approval, stomping and laughing; and when the racket slackened and died, it blended into a slower, almost melancholy tune that nonetheless had a feeling of quiet certainty underlying it.Then Lona began to sing, not looking at Whitey, gazing off into space a little above the audiences heads, in a voice as sweet as spring and as clear as a fountain.The words didnt quite register; they seemed to slide around and envelop Dar in a dazzle of consonantsbut the meaning sank in: a lament for the wilderness that was, but never was, the primeval beauty that men hearkened back to when the name Terra was spoken.Then Whitey joined in on the chorus, in a quiet, sad but satisfied judgment that the wilderness had passed, but that it had had to, as all things must.Then Lona took up the verse again, in lilting wonder that the same wilderness had greeted men anew, on distant planets, under suns unseen from Terra.Then the chorus again, that these too had passed, as theyd had to; and another verse, another planet, a hundred more, each greeting humankind with wilderness, to tame and then destroy within the bars of hedges; then the chorus, and one final verse, in notes that soared with triumphfor bit by bit, men had learned to live within the wilderness, and preserve itand yonder, past the marches, new planets beckoned with their foreststhe ancient home of humans, which they must ever seek.Dar sat, stunned.How could he have ever thought that poem was great when hed read it without hearing its music?Then the keyboard slashed out a great, jarring discord, and they were off into another bawdy song.And so it wentbits of poetry sandwiched in between carousing, continually taking the audience by surprise.When Whitey finally bade the audience give the singer time for a drink, Dar was on his feet with the rest of them, applauding wildly and shouting, More!More!
