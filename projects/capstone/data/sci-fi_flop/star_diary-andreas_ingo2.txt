But this seemed highly unlikely.They had hired Mandal to take care of everything.The garden was Mandals specialty, his calling and masterpiece.He had signed a contract that gave him authority over everything: This to give the colonial reformers a reliable hand, someone who did more than was required.The maintenance of the garden was more than a job, a task that was about transcendence, and that reflected the beauty of Mandals being.Mandal contacted his employers and was met with anger and skepticism.No one had used anyone for a sudden intervention.Moreover, they would not come to visit for many months.It was now up to Mandal to find and isolate the intruder: Use the weapons in the working machine and kill those responsible, if necessary.Mandal continued to Nimrod 3 and took out the weapons from the gun cabinet.One of these was a plasma based "Exploder" with a homing mechanism.The gun fired a green plasma, which was looking for organic and mechanical abnormalities and exploded on contact.The other weapon was a beam based automatic weapon, which fired green rays, very effective in close combat.Mandal decided to scan all areas on the mini planet.The intruder could be lost.There might even be more of them, waiting for him, so he would look with great caution.* * *      He approached the dwelling house with a feeling of exhaustion.All day hed searched through the various sections of the mini planet.Hed lost himself in gardens, overgrown by trees with multiple trunks; in winding bushes that looked out towards the walkways.There were plenty of absurdities: A small shrub, bioengineered like the others, full of brown cones.Sprawling scales could be observed over the cones surface.But they reminded a bit of Aquatica: Divided into two halves, an admittedly with smaller diameter and a lower one with larger diameter.There were also a number of gazebos he had visited the day before.He had walked, he had sneaked, and he had given up hope of finding the intruder.Now the only thing that remained was the dwelling house.This was the glory of the mini planet: It was light gray as the gazebos, but it was significantly larger and built in sections.Thoughts came about the Roman mansions from Roman times, but it was not an old fashioned design.It was cylindrical units that surrounded a rectangular inner sphere, where a rectangular build could be observed in its futuristic splendor.You could see the grand staircase that led up to the inner slot.Nothing had been left to chance: the larger forms were decorated with extensions from the era that existed, year 2153, one hundred and fifty years into the future.Mandal went up the stairs.He put down his exploder and took a firm grip on the ray gun.He was left to his fate.A solo artist in a universe filled with corruption and enmity.Man lived on man, young on old, and the only thing that remained was the struggle for transcendence: To reach the unreachable with limited means.The door opened to the courtyard.He was now standing in a place that spurred the imagination: The rounding of the outer cylinders was palpable, but through extensions, like bridges without railings, these cylinders were connected to the rectangular structure in the courtyard.Blue sheeting hung from the extensions.They had green rings with embellishments.Thoughts came on the chlorophyll rich grass and the bushes in the outskirts of the lawn.Mandal didnt go into the rectangular building, but went around it.He saw climbers who were looking up the walls.In a rectangular window, he could discern pink curtains: Pleated, full of shadows and light.Suddenly he saw the intruder: Near the far corner, he stood bent, digging with a tool in a garden plot.Mandal raised his weapon, took a few steps closer, fired at the enemy and hid behind the corner of the building.The heart rate rose in his chest.He glanced back toward the garden plot but no shape appeared.Mandal was puzzled.Had the enemy sought shelter behind the corner, waiting for him?Or had he gone around the corner and would surprise him from the other side?Mandal gripped convulsively round the gun and crept forward.Shadows were thrown against the interior walls, from the middle portion between the apertures in the outer wall.The gravel under his feet was newly raked.When he came to the garden plot no enemy could be seen.He waited a long time at the scene, worried that the intruder had entered the dwelling house and waited there: Like a ghost that hovered in the windows on the inside the building, between the curtains.The garden plot was yet another surprise: The thing that happened in the garden had also happened in the garden plot: All herbaceous plants had been uprooted.There remained only the pure soil raked over with expert like precision.Mandal was worried.He was afraid of the reactions from the employers, but also afraid of the total failure: To lose his garden, the mini planet and all his life.The last day turned into an intensive search.He picked up the exploder and moved over Aquaticas garden groves, terrified.He was looking at gazebos and streams.He walked up stairs where he could see the outline of vegetated hills.On the shores of small lakes he looked for footprints in the care fatted ground.But no intruder could be seen.The day turned into night.He found himself standing at the portion where the northern half of Aquatica turned to the south.He stood between two walls, illuminated by faint light that painted patterns on light gray walls.A staircase led to the southern direction, another to the north.A walkway a few meters away led to the interior of the mini planet.Mandal hesitated.The robot looked up into the sky and saw the huge outline of Aqua 6.The dark sphere made an undoubted impression of Mandals consciousness: He saw the cities on the islands, surrounded by water, illuminated by a gigantic network of light.Shooting pains along Mandals spine caused him to shiver, while he lay in the connection room.Was the intruder in there?Down in the walkway, somewhere in the interior of the mini planet?Mandal decided to return to Nimrod 3 and resume the search the next day.* * *      At dawn the first rays of light appeared at the working machine.Mandal hadnt slept well during the night.Hed dreamed nightmares about the unknown intruder.Hed been too far away to be discernible at the moment of contact.But hed leaned forward, toward the garden plot; the back had been seen on the figure.It was something that resembled a small unit on the back; a tool that was aimed at the garden plot, tubes were stretched across the shoulder blades.It was a human figure, but he was slightly longer.Mandal went to the bathroom and then to the upper floor of the working machine.He looked out the windows, being careful to keep track of the weapons.The atmosphere in Nimrod 3 was something of an electrified future: There were various panels along the right wall.The link chair was an unusual shape: As an alien control station, complete with the characteristic practicalities: A two dimensional display, resplendent in green and yellow letters.Cables for electronic circuits.Calibration equipment in black, which made the connection possible to different workers.
