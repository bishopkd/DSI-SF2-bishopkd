She passed the door to Christophers room when she heard strange noises.It was a sort of hissing.She stood in the opening of Christophers room, enlarged the gap and right there in front of her, she saw the outline of an alien.It was a humanoid standing on two legs.But where the shoulder blades would sit there was a kind of outgrowth.It had dragon like scales, which continued along the back and along the hind legs down to the feet.These werent obnoxious but rather inviting.The head also had a number of scales and the abdomen was marked by muscular bands.The alien didnt seem to suffer.Its eyes glowed with an unfamiliar darkness.And suddenly, when it realized it was being watched, it transformed to a human.Christopher stood naked in the room and watched Simone.He went off to bed and put on his pants.Its not what you think...Christopher said brusquely.Im just a human being.Ive had telepathic contact and been taught how to grow beyond human reason.Simone looked at the man.His pained appearance, his stooped figure now appeared more like it was: Christopher had shyly tried to blend in with ordinary people, adopted a reclusive attitude to not get noticed.Its all about genetics.He said, Being able to transform yourself according to your own preference.And the conspiracy, then?Simone said horrified, What is the truth about that and why do you need me?Christopher went up to Simone and looked her seriously in the eye.I needed you to assure myself that everything was true.The truth is that were alone and that the soldiers will come at any moment.The list may not be delivered; the informant must disappear or die.But we cant vanish.What shall we do then?Simone said desperately, Now youve pulled me into a conflict Ive never chosen, against better judgment!Follow me.We hide in the space station.We need some weapons.We take the informant and hide in the space station: In the mazes.Eventually, the soldiers will think weve disappeared and give up.* * *      It wasnt long before the soldiers had arrived in the space elevator.The couple had been hiding in the ventilation system, which enveloped the entire space station and could be used as a protective chamber.Harold went with them, a sweaty fellow passenger who kept quiet by the threat of an automatic.There, in the darkness, while armed figures passed below, Simone got a sense of unreality: A kind of unreality that wasnt in opposition to life.Rather, she felt she hadnt lived before but now had the chance.Shadows could be seen through gaps in the ventilation system.An infrared detector could be seen in the hands of a soldier: Distress was imminent.The soldiers stayed and watched the infrared detector.Some hid in the ventilation system: Three human forms that couldnt be others than the sought after.The soldiers opened fire.The shots bounced off the ventilation system without making holes in the light metal.The three heroes crawled forward on all fours and ended up in a small room.There was no way out of this room, other than to continue through the ventilation system to other rooms.But they were already discovered and there was nothing to do.This is where we ended up.Christopher said somewhat resignedly.All we can do is procrastinate and resist.It will take time before the others get here.Why not give up at once?Simone said.I know its only a matter of minutes, seconds.The time that the resistance needs to put an end to the threat within the U. N.   They stood there for a long time.Harold shook with fear and tears ran down his cheeks.Simone had never seen a more desperate man.She had never felt so brave, in comparison.We have no choice.Christopher said, We leave Harold here, take the automatics and open fire on the opponents.We crawl on all fours into a nearby room.The soldiers will think that were still left.They did as Christopher said.Simone looked at the light that began to penetrate through the cracks.The morning had come and white streaks of light could be discerned in the slots.The areas around them were red.Simone and Christopher crept through the narrow space.Simone did badly on a protruding screw.They could hear Harold screaming in the background: Cries of despair in an attempt to save his life.Simone and Christopher heard the sound of something give way and suddenly they fell down through the ventilation system, on the floor in the midst of the soldiers.They found themselves surrounded by them.Tanned men and women dressed in uniforms.Some directed their weapons against the invaders.Others did not.Wheres Harold?They wondered.What have you done to our man?Hes in the ventilation shaft.Christopher said, But you cant do anything now but to kill us.The other soldiers raised their guns to shoot.But suddenly there came a call on the radio.Yes.So the sought go free?Why are they free?A silence entered the room.Darkness of space reigned outside, but was broken up by the rays of the sun.
