78 times 923.45 divided by 65.23 plus 92565.286?The answer?""99031.75 is the product to two decimal places, and the square of that number is, dropping the decimal places for the moment, 980713896.Do you want it with the decimal places too?"A mentally muttered morbid curse was his only answer, and Chuck smiled warmly as his two friends came forward to beat him on the back and welcome him back to sanity."I was going to ask you what we were doing here.The last I remember is some torture or other and things getting dim; then, bango, I'm in this valley and somebody asked me that question, and by reflex of course, I put the old brain box to work and dug up the answer.I was startled so it was a good thing it was a simple question. ""That's about enough of the old self laudatory praise," the voice spoke coldly in their minds.Not only in their minds, but they realized suddenly that they were hearing it with their ears.They looked up at the ledge whence the voice had spoken and recoiled together.For there was Baksheesh.He was an ancient, gnarled, scratched and generally beat up native of the planet Haggis, that was obvious.But he was old.Generations of spiders had built webs between his claws until he was almost wrapped in a cocoon.Yet for all his age, the light of a great intelligence burned in his crystalline eyes.Nor was that all.His color...."White.I know what you are thinking," the thought crackled down at them."Hideous white like the vile Hagg Loos, not beautiful and black like the Hagg Inder.Well, I have news for you.I AM a Hagg Loos.Ha!You might very well cringe back at that news.But I am above petty politics now.Once I was as human as any other, and as mad as any, but the fortunes of war brought me here, and I crawled into that cave and came to rest over a powerful radioactive source.My madness was cured, and my intelligence soared as I was made immortal by most standards.Including my own, I must add.But to remain immortal I must toast over the radioactives.If I leave the cave, I die, so now I must return.You know my secret, but you will not betray me, for my wisdom is of the ages.I have come before you to tell you one thing that you must never forget. "It rattled its antenna wildly, and the last thought blasted like a hurricane through their minds."BEWARE THE KRAKAR!"They staggered under the mental blast, and when they looked up, the pallid creature had gone, and they were alone among the bones and chitin of the dead.16  ENIGMA IN SPACE  "Krakar ...Krakar ...now where did I hear that before?"Lord Prrsi muttered to himself, trying to place the transient memory that rattled around inside the chitin of his head.This was at the meeting of the top executives of the Galaxy Rangers, and they were having this first historical meeting in the first class lounge of the Pleasantville Eagle.Sally, who had been made president of the Ladies' Auxiliary and given a gold brooch with a miniature star on it, was serving drinks while the Rangers discussed the fateful final words spoken by Baksheesh.Sally passed around cigars, and most of the Earthmen lit up, though Jerry was enjoying a joint, and the aliens present either ate theirs or threw them under the chairs when no one was looking."I have it!"Lord Prrsi shouted and snapped his claws in excitement, cutting a solid steel lounge chair in half without noticing it."Somewhere in the transcript from one of the Hagg Loos prisoners we took when we raided their secret laboratory.Just hold on, chaps, I'll send a mental command to the computer to dig it out and beam it back to me.Won't take long. "John rapped for attention with his whiskey glass, then held it up to Sally for a refill."While we're waiting for that thought to come through, let's hear that security report that old squid head SlugTogath put together on the Lortonoi.You have the floor, Sluggy. "The Garnishee prime minister rose and coughed with two or three of his mouths, then picked up the report with the tentacles on his head and held it before a couple of his close reading eyes.He coughed again and began."This is an amalgamation of all information that could be obtained about our traditional and mentally repulsive enemy, the brain sucking Lortonoi.Evidence was taken from every race that has fought the Lortonoi, and more evidence tortured out of those who have fought cheek by jowl with these disgusting creatures.The first fact we have uncovered is that no one, not even their allies, has ever seen a Lortonoi.They arrive in their own spaceship and hardly ever leave it, since all instructions and commands are given by mental telepathy.On certain occasions, as in the secret laboratory of the Hagg Loos, they have made an appearance, but since they arrived in a great armored tank and never left it, this isn't much help either. ""So you've told us what we don't know," John said."What do we know?""I'm just getting to that part.We know that they have fantastic mental powers which they use only for evil.They appear at many places through the galaxy and aid any race they can either mentally control or which is nasty enough to go along with them.In their travels they seem to have picked up a knowledge of all the weapons and science that are around, so that any race they aid immediately goes to war with any other race nearby.Very nasty.Their goal seems to be complete control of the galaxy for their own evil ends. ""And ours is to crush them for free enterprise, a rigid class system and all the other forms of democracy we love," John shouted, and all present cheered."Now what about it, Lord Prrsi, you old red hot scorpion, any word yet from your molasses clogged computer?Seems pretty slow. ""Really quite fast, Number One.The answer came back within three nanoseconds, but I didn't want to interrupt the pep talk.It seems that while we were questioning one of the technicians, he shouted something like 'The Krakar will get you, ha ha' before he lapsed into acoma. ""Coma?""Understandable.Our questioning can be rather severe at times, but after all, they are only Hagg Loos, and working class at that. ""Can you get any more out of him?"Jerry asked."Maybe even a spot of torture if you have to. ""My dear boy!What on Haggis do you think our normal questioning is?Short of stripping off his chitin and boiling him like a lobster, there is little else we can do.He is still recovering from the last round of questioning, and I sincerely doubt that more of the same will reveal any more than this.Very strong willed, these blighters, and insane to boot. ""Why don't you try curing his madness?"Sally asked, refilling the glasses, but they went on talking, ignoring her completely.Jerry was holding forth in great detail on Earthly torture methods to see if the Hagg Inder had missed any when she raised the glass martini jug and dropped it onto his head.Well, this caught their attention a bit, and while she had it, she repeated her question."Why don't you try curing the prisoner's insanity and perhaps he will cooperate voluntarily?""Bourgeois sentimentality!"Lord Prrsi snorted."Did you have to do that?"Jerry said aggrievedly, picking a pickled onion out of his ear."I think you might have an idea there, Sally. "John rapped again for order."What about it, Prrsi you old sting tail monster?Why don't you have your shrinks try to cure this guy, put a metal box around his brain so he doesn't have a relapse, read to him from the Bible, the Magna Carta and the Declaration of Independence.... ""Fill his head with that subversive rot!""Sure, you can always kill him afterward so the word doesn't spread, but it might work. ""I say, it might indeed.I'll issue an order by thought mail ...there, it's gone.Work will begin at once. ""All right, then to new business," John said."Work on our secret Ranger base on Planet X, tenth planet of this sun Sirius, has been completed and we can move our volunteers there so the Hagg Inder can turn off their air conditioning. ""Well, thank Great Cacodyl!"Lord Prrsi breathed."I swear I am turning blue black from the cold and feel galloping pneumonia coming on.Anything below the boiling point of water gives me a positive chill on my liver. ""Save the medical chitchat for later," John said."Let's get on with this so we can get down to some heavy drinking, and listen, Jerry, that is the third joint in a quarter hour, and your eyes are getting glassy.Can you kindly hold off a bit, huh?So, more business.We sent a spy team in a fast battle cruiser to scout out the star cluster where the Lortonoi headed when they escaped last time.Just for a change we shouldn't go off half cocked racing around the stars without a bit of look see first.While we are waiting for their report, we are consolidating our position, building our base, getting more volunteers by capturing slave ships and that kind of thing.It also gives us some time to look into this Krakar thing, which has a very nasty sound to it, before we get involved in more fighting, that is, and it turns out that the Lortonoi are going to give us the Krakar, right in the old you know where. ""I'll second that motion," Chuck said."Krakar must be solved. "The medical teams went to work.Utilizing their great mental skills, as well as some Earthling techniques like aversion therapy, prefrontal lobotomy, shock treatment, dianetic auditing, and the psychoanalytic couch, they did a quick cure on the laboratory technician.As soon as he was sane, he saw the error of his ways and voluntarily told everything he knew.Everything turned out to be something, but not very much: the spatial coordinates of the place where Krakar was supposed to be and the interesting information that whoever controlled Krakar controlled the galaxy."Let's go," Jerry shouted, rubbing his hands together.Blast in, full force, take 'em by surprise, atomize the enemy, grab Krakar, and the galaxy is ours!""Best not to go off half cocked," Chuck mused."Whatever that means. ""I know," Sally said."A historical expression relating to the early weapons that had a flint and steel and were cocked "  "Shut up," Jerry hinted."If you have a better idea, Chuck old man  why, let us hear it. ""I think we ought to have a quick scout first to see what we are getting into and to find out maybe what Krakar is.If it could be grabbed by force that easily, you can bet the Lortonoi would have done it long before this.Just us Earthmen, and Sally along for cooking, and we shouldn't be away more than a day or two. ""Great, Chuck," John agreed."Sort of a holiday, and we deserve it. ""And I deserve permanent KP?"Sally asked, but no one was listening.Soon the faithful Pleasantville Eagle was ready and rarin' to go.Fuel tanks filled, oxygen brimming over, guns loaded, bar restocked.With Jerry at the controls they made great ten light year leaps toward their destination.There was a newly mounted electronic superscope in the ship's nose that threw a highly magnified picture onto a screen, and Chuck was at the controls."Nothing," he mused."Yet we are almost to the center of the star cluster where Krakar is supposed to be.Are you sure we haven't got the wrong figures or something?""Negative," John said, going through the tech reports."We have carefully plotted the spatial directions eight ways from Sunday and to one hundred and thirteen decimal places.Krakar has to be near here somewheres.I tell you what, make another jump, a teensy jump, maybe just a couple of light years this time, no more than 1,671,321,600,000 nautical miles, which is two lightyears. ""Here we go. "They jumped  and instantly every alarm in the ship blasted an earsplitting cacophony as they appeared almost in the shadow of a fantastically huge space battleship that was at least a mile long.Widemouthed gunports were ranged the length of its deadly gray metal hide, and it reeked of an overpowering air of efficient destruction.Jerry jabbed at the button that would jump them out of there, but before his thumb could touch it, mighty magnet beams locked onto the great form of the 747, a mosquito compared to an eagle now, and instantly whisked it up against the pocked metal skin of the ship.Paralyzer rays flooded the ship, and they could not move.At the same moment a jointed metal tube shot out from the battleship, and a device on the end, very much resembling an electric can opener, buzzed noisily in a circle, and a section of hull fell clanging inside the plane.Zombie rays must have been operating as well because they all stood, despite their every effort to resist, and they marched slowly into the cabin to stand ranked before the ragged opening.Heavy footsteps clumped down the tube toward them, and their hands all flashed up to their temples in a snappy salute."At ease," said the creature who entered, and their arms dropped."Name of ship, planet of origin, defensive armament, passports of crew, VD rate.Report. "They could only gape.The alien was tremendous, standing over eight feet tall and glowering down at them.It had short, solid legs and a long, thick body, which it needed since it had four arms on each side, or eight in all.It wore a neatly cut uniform of dark black  what a tailor he must have had!and a black helmet on its head.The head!Eight red eyes gleamed in a row below the helmet's lip, while below them was a nose shaped like a vacuum cleaner hose.To complete this singularly repulsive picture, his wide mouth was filled to overflowing with black teeth, most of which protruded like tusks at interesting angles."Report!"it shouted, waving a clipboard it carried in one hand, a short sword, a pistol, a club, and lots of other things in its other hands, and it still had a couple of hands free to shake fists at them.Jerry reported.Listing everything they had, though he did manage to forget the cheddite projector, their only big secret."Haven't you forgot something?"Sally said brightly,  "The ched " She wasn't sure who had given her the knee from behind so efficiently, but it stopped her.The ugly alien turned a couple of eyes her way."She means the cheddar cheese in the galley, the bagels, the baked beans and other food supplies, but you don't want to hear about that, no!"John said brightly.For an instant of time that seemed to stretch to eternity the alien glared down at them, his eyes seeming to probe their innermost thoughts.Finally, it spoke, in a deep nasty rumble."Split.If you aren't moving out of here at top speed within two seconds after we release the magnetic rays, you will be blasted into infinitesimal fragments. ""Wait a minute!"Jerry shouted angrily."You can't talk to us like that.... ""Oh, yes, I can. ""Well, you can talk to us like that if you want to.But can't you at least explain what is happening?""What is happening, as if you didn't know, ugly toofew eyes, too few arms alien, is that you are in the outer shell of the attacking forces that have been attacking the Chachkas for the past two hundred and eighty five years.We always welcome recruits to the fighting forces since a certain amount of fighting equipment is used up, and volunteers are accepted, and in proportion to their contribution of arms a similar percentage will be given in the occupied galaxy, which we will control as soon as we have Krakar "  "What is Krakar?""Who knows?Except we know that it is written that he who controls it controls the galaxy, and that is what we aim to do.Your aim too, but you missed.Your strength is too slight to get even an infinitesimal cut of the galaxy, so now beat it.Your time has run out. "The alien spun about on one thick heel and started for the exit."Do you take bribes?"Chuck called after it.It spun about, weapons raised, and Sally fainted.For one eternal moment it stood there rattling its prominent teeth and death hovered low in the air."Of course I take bribes," it gnashed."Doesn't everybody?Make me an offer. ""What do you want?Diamonds, gold, greenbacks, vodka, dirty books, jet fuel, oxygen, Hershey bars?You name it, we got it. ""I spit on your dirty books, not enough arms for fun, but a cupful of diamonds will see me through until payday.What do you want in exchange?""Just a chance to get into the fighting zone and let fly with all our weapons at the enemy; then we will head for home. ""Won't do any harm  and I can use the loot.Pour them into this pocket," he said to Chuck who had gone to the safe and returned with a measuring cup full of bluewhites.The alien scratched quickly on the clipboard and tore off a chit and handed it to them."Here's your clearance and coordinates.Get in there, fire your load, and be out within ten minutes or you have had it, buddy.That's as far as this tiny bribe goes. ""Eternally at your service, sir," Jerry called after the retreating back as they lifted the ragged disk of metal into position and welded it back into place before they lost all of their atmosphere.The tube was sucked back into the battleship and they floated free."I'm using the space warper drive to get us into position," Chuck said, spinning the controls."We'll save the cheddite projector for an emergency, for if they have any clue to its existence, they will tear the ship apart upon the instant.Hold tight, folks, here we go. "Space warped and was penetrated, and they appeared suddenly notched into position in a great globe of ships in space.As far as they could see in every direction, spaceships of every size and shape floated in this hollow globe formation and released a storm of weaponry at the object floating at the mathematical center of this sphere in space.It was hard to see just what was down there because of the fury of attack, the scintillating rays, the destructive vibrating beams, the explosive filled torpedoes and highpowered shells that were continuously rained down upon the target.They put on dark glasses and finally made out a golden sphere at the heart of all the activity.It could not have been more than a mile in diameter, yet it withstood the ravening might of the greatest engines of destruction ever assembled in the lenticular galaxy.And it fought back.Occasionally a thin red beam of light would lash up from the golden surface, and anything it touched instantly exploded with terrible effect.Entire ships went up this way, and one five mile long battleship bought it while they watched, blowing up so efficiently that it took four other ships with it in the explosion.Yet instantly, ships waiting in the second sphere filled the gaps, and the battle went on."Whoever is down there sure has plenty on the ball," John breathed, speaking for them all."Just two minutes left," Jerry said, eying the chronometer."I'll bet you have the same idea I have. "Chuck laughed  "And me too," agreed John."Right on!We set our coordinates exactly and appear inside that sphere with our trusty old bird here.All their weapons are pointed away from the golden sphere.If we get inside, the place will be ours, and we'll have Krakar!""No!"Sally begged."It is sure suicide.How can we weak Earthlings accomplish what the combined might of this alien space armada cannot?""That's just the point," Jerry answered, and the others nodded agreement."It just goes to show you that we are a lot better than them with their big battleships and extra arms and teeth and things.Give me a good old Earthman any day!Right, gang'!"Sally was brushed aside, and to enthusiastic cheers, the suicidally inclined men set the cheddite projector, calibrating it exactly at the center of the sphere, then pressed the actuating button just as their time was up.17  LO!SUCH WONDERS STAND REVEALED  There was a quick flick, and the scene changed  but really changed.An unmeasurable instant before they had been in interstellar space, part of the immense fleet that was attacking the golden globe.Now they were inside the globe, they had to be.So the plan had worked!The Pleasantville Eagle had appeared inside the space construction maybe a couple of feet above the floor.Now it fell and bounced in its undercarriage and its passengers bounced off each other, the lucky ones bouncing off Sally, who was by far the most pneumatic.There was a crash of broken glass from the galley; then everything was still."Just look out there, will you!"Chuck enthused, pointing."I have a feeling that we were not expected. "It appeared that they were not.They were in the middle of an immense chamber whose curved walls were covered with hulking machines of mcomprehensible design, all made of gold.There were many viewscreens and controls among the machinery, and small creatures were at these controls; they were too far away to make out details, but they certainly had a nasty look.While they were taking in the details and strapping on loaded guns, Sally began to tremble and moan and salivate a bit.Chuck looked at her, then slapped his forehead with the heel of his hand."Too late," he said."Remember, guys, how we all put on mind shields before we came here so our minds would be shielded.Well, you remember Sally had to comb her hair....Yeah, I guess her mind shield is still in her purse. "Instantly all the guns pointed at her as she shivered, then began to speak in a deep and resonant voice."You aliens may leave, and we will not harm you, for you are trespassing on our domain. ""Try again," Jerry sneered for all of them."This is simple research satellite, nothing more. ""You're lying, aren't you?"John said."Yes, I am lying," Sally said hoarsely, and her shoulders slumped."We Chachkas can tell only the truth, and I will never live down the shame of telling that lie.In fact ...it is too much...I cannot bear it, living with the shame.Good bye, fellow Chachkas, good bye, ugly soft aliens.It is a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done ...arrrgh!"Sally swayed and almost fell, but before they could reach her, she pulled herself erect again and spoke in an even deeper voice."Chachka Two has committed suicide, so I, Chachka Three take command.You must leave "  "Listen," Chuck broke in."We don't like to deal with the hired help.Put Chachka One on the line. ""Would that I could, he was a friend to us all.But he was crossing the floor when your monster machine appeared and dropped on him.One leg can be seen projecting from under your right front wheel. ""Accidents happen," John consoled him."In any case we are here, and this is the moment of truth.So speak.You are the guardians of Krakar, aren't you?""We are," Sally intoned."Carrying on our eons old destiny.You see before you the last descendants of the Chachka, the oldest race in the lenticular galaxy.We were old when your planet was young.While the great saurians wallowed in the swamps of Earth, our empire was at its zenith, stretching from star to star, spanning the universe.We were mighty, and yet we fell, for the lesser races were jealous of our power and warred against us, and the wars grew more and more ferocious.But with age comes wisdom, and when, almost at the end, the ultimate weapon was invented, reason prevailed and it was never used.We retreated instead, from planet to planet, signing humbling peace agreements, until we had retreated to the solar system whence we had sprung.Then a racial rot set in, for we who had been so strong were now so humble, and youngsters were not born and the fields fell into disuse and we were doomed.Our race, you might say, died of a broken heart. ""Then what are you doing here now?"Jerry asked."If you'll shut up, I'll tell you.I was just getting to the best part.You see, having discovered the ultimate weapon and then not using it gave the best minds in our race a real mental lift.Most races think they are better than all the others; it just so happened that we knew it.So this golden sphere was constructed, holding within it the best of all the science we had ever known.Into it also went the best minds of the race to carry on the great work we had begun.It was agreed that just because we had no real need to use the ultimate weapon did not mean that at some future date there might not arise a situation where it might have to be used.Therefore, we watch and wait, but to date we have seen no occasion to even consider cracking it out of cold storage. ""And the name of the ultimate weapon is Krakar?"John asked."It is.Very bright of you; All the races that have heard of it have come here with lust and murder burning within them and have attempted to take it by force. ""Not us," John said, letting his gunbelt drop to the floor so he could kick it under a chair."We have nothing but peace within our hearts, we Galaxy Rangers, and have devoted our all to the destruction of the Lortonoi, who are dedicated to taking over the galaxy for their own slimy ends.We can sure use your old Krakar, so why not hand it over?""Never!"Sally swayed."We see the guns and cannons and the rest of the crap sticking out of your winged machine, not so peaceful that.No, we have to be convinced before we turn Krakar over to anyone.And we are geared to defend ourselves.You see how little effect those ships out there have upon our indestructible sphere.We are surrounded by a wall of energy that cannot be penetrated. ""Well, we got in," Chuck said, proudly."So your defenses aren't all that darned good. ""We are aware of that.Your cheddite projector is a simple variation of our R Shi, ray, which we discarded eons ago as a childish toy, then forgot about it. ""Too bad," Jerry said, looking at his fingernails, then polishing them on his sleeve."You should have kept it around, and then we wouldn't be inside here now and sort of insisting that you turn over Krakar to us. ""Even that contingency has been considered.If any attempt is made to take Krakar in this fashion, any one of our race can press an instant destruct button that blows everything up.Krakar and the works will be gone forever.We would rather do that than have it fall into the wrong hands. ""Sort of stalemate," John mused."Look, why don't we sit down around a conference table like intelligent life forms and see what we can work out?And besides, Sally is going to have a sore throat after all this. ""We are amenable," Three said after a moment's thought."Would you be kind enough to leave your weapons behind when you emerge?You will find that our atmosphere is breathable by primitive creatures like yourselves.Over and out. "Sally staggered and clutched at her neck."Christ, my throat hurts!"she grated.While Sally gargled with salt water, the rest of the Earthlings dumped their weapons and exited.Three was waiting at the foot of the gangway to greet them."Welcome," he said in the familiar deep voice."Well I'll be hornswoggled. "Chuck gaped for all of them."These Chachkas look just like foot long, black cockroaches with little pink hands on their front feet!""Yes, and you humans look like great, soft gop worms that used to live in our swamps and ate by standing on their heads and sucking in mud.Now if we can drop the racial slander, we can get on with the business at hand.While you were making your clumsy way out of your archaic vehicle, I had a conference with the other leaders.Since we can think about a hundred times faster than you primitive forms, you might say we had a day long rap session and we have reached a conclusion.We have nothing against you, other than you look like gop worms, that is, but we only hand over Krakar for like a real galaxy wide emergency.So far you haven't convinced us.What might convince us is a complete knowledge of your antecedents, history, moral turpitude, intelligence, sexual deviations, culture, etc.If we had this we could decide if the present emergency justifies the use of Krakar. ""You're not asking very much," John told him."We could be here ten years and not supply all the info you need. ""That is where you are wrong, primitive softling.If you permit us, we can make an instant print of all your memories, including your racial memories, and with that we can make a true evaluation in a couple of minutes more.Do you agree?""What do we have to do?"Chuck asked suspiciously for all of them."Just agree, that's all, since we Chachkas are not only incredibly honest but cannot take anytlling by force, including a memory.If you agree, why then brain copying rays will instantly lash down, penetrating easily those primitive mind shields, and make a copy of everything you have lurking in the old gray matter.You will feel nothing. ""Well, what do you say, guys?"Jerry asked.The others thought for a moment, then nodded agreement."Okay, you can do it, Three. ""It's already done.I told you it wouldn't hurt.Now, while the memories are being processed, may I offer you a little refreshment?We have a fine hundred year old Napoleon brandy, manufactured instantly from your memories by our reconstitutor machines and indistinguishable from the original Try it. "They managed to work the ancient cork out and poured a golden measure into each snifter, then smacked and gasped and moaned with delight."Keep the bottle, I don't drink," Three said with an offhand wave of its tentacle."Ahh, the results are coming through.My, oh, my, you do have some loathsome material well sublimated in your subconscious minds, but that is neither here nor there.What is interesting is that the Lortonoi might very well be the galaxy wide menace that Krakar will be needed to destroy, so you boys are in luck. ""Then we get the weapon?"John asked, leaning forward expectantly."You do not.Didn't you hear the operative might in that sentence?What we will do is give you an instant communicator that will enable you to contact us instantly from any part of the galaxy.If the situation is so desperate that it looks as if the Lortonoi are going to take over, you have simply to drop us the word, then press your head against the device.We'll make a memory copy to get up to date and decide then. ""Is that your best offer?"Jerry asked."Best offer we have made in a little over eight billion years, so consider yourself lucky.The communicator is now resting within your machine.So take it and leave and good riddance.Oh, yes, one thing before you go.Our incredible machinery is powered by a matter destruction generator that generates energy by the total destruction of matter.We will be running out of mass to burn in it in about a couple of hundred years.Just to be sure, we would like to have some extra on hand.If you are interested, we'll trade you a case of the Napoleon brandy for two hundred gallons of your jet fuel That should see us through the next thousand years. ""A deal!"they shouted all together."Fine.The brandy is already aboard, and we have removed the fuel Now good bye, we have had about all of your primitive presences that we can stand. "They waved cheery good byes and tramped back into the Pleasantville Eagle, passing the bottle happily from hand to hand.A hoarse Sally emerged from the head, and they gave her a double slug to help her throat.Three had not lied, since he was incapable of it, and there on a seat in the front row was a case of the brandy, while in the seat next to it was a golden sphere about the size of a golfball with a single red button on it labeled "press me. ""These roaches sure know a thing or two about microminiaturization," John said, slipping the sphere into his pocket."Now how do we get out of here?""Maximum power, I would say," Chuck said."We can make it almost back to Haggis in a single jump.In that way the warring thousands around this sphere will have no idea that we were ever inside. ""I'll buy that," John said."Maximum power, lady and gents, so hold onto your hats. "Jerry twisted the dials to their stops, made careful alignment, then pressed the actuator button.This was the biggest jump they had ever made, and they really felt it.As if their guts were made of spaghetti and were being wound up on a big fork."Yukh," Sally eructated when they had emerged lightyears away, speaking for them all, then staggered and sat down heavily in a seat.It took them awhile to recover from the shock of the jump  the Napoleon brandy helped a good deal  and when they finally landed at the Galaxy Ranger base on Planet X, they were feeling better, as well as being half crocked, so Sally brewed some black coffee and they all drank a good deal of this before they emerged and marched grimly to the control room."Report!"John said, seating himself at the massive control console and flipping switches quickly.Most of the switches didn't work, since they were still building the place, but he finally got through to the OD."Glad you are back, sir," the alien said."That spy team you sent to track the Lortonoi is back and, boy, do they have a story to tell!""All right, don't ruin the punch line, just send the commander in here on the double. "
