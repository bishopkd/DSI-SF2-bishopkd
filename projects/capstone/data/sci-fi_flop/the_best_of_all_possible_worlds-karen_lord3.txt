He wore his hair longer, brushing his shoulders, the gilt bands in the seal brown even more fiercely bleached by the sun.He was still lean, still handsome, still golden. He had been my fiance once. My heart stumbled as a flood of half remembered yearning seemed to pour out from him and envelop me. His eyes glowed with an inhuman warmth, and I thought I heard a whisper in his voice Shadi. A strong memory to echo so loudly. Hello, Ioan, I said, and smiled proudly at how ordinary I sounded. Shadi, he said, breaking out into a huge, radiant smile.Hed always called me by my middle name.In a few quick steps he reached me and hugged me, picking me up half a meter from the  ground in his fervor.You came back.I knew youd comeback.Well, I said breathlessly, looking over his shoulder at Marias beaming face, just for a little while.He stepped back suddenly, looking anxiously at my uniform.Man, Im filthy.Sorry about that.He brushed at a few reddish stains on my shirt and trousers where the clay soil had transferred and left its mark.Dont worry.Time I changed out of this, anyway, I said, gently pushing away his hands.After changing clothes, I started for the kitchen, hearing the familiar clatter of meal preparation.As I passed the door to the small pantry, something made me turn my head.There was Gracie, standing on a stepladder, glaring at the top shelf, where a cookie jar sat just out of her reach.What are you doing up there?Come!I demanded.She tumbled from the stepladder into my outstretched arms for a hug.I squeezed her skinny four year old frame with a gleeful grin.She may not have been my favorite, but she was my namesake and it was early days.Maybe if she learned to write long letters Hey, you two.The voice was close enough to make me jump.Ioan stood behind me and wrapped his arms around both of us, bending past my cheek to smack a kiss on his daughters forehead.The slight stubble of his jaw grazed my skin.I took a half step sideways, trying to keep our bodies from brushing together.He didnt seem to notice, or care, because he moved with me in a slight sway, appearing to relish the lengthy embrace.Two of my favorite girls, he murmured, then finally let go.I turned around and set Gracie in his arms.Ill go see if Maria needs any help with dinner.He put Gracie down.Sweetie, go see if your mother needs any help.She dashed off silently. Shes so obedient, I said accusingly.Did she even have the terrible twos stage?Not really, no, Ioan said, looking after her with a smile.Not like her mother, then.She drove me mad when she was two.Shadi, he said, and that was all he said, but something in the tone made me duck my head down and walk to the door, which, unfortunately, meant going past him.He seized me by the wrist.Shadi, look at me.No, Ioan.That doesnt work on me, remember?I tugged my hand free and kept going, trying to ignore the echo in my headShadiShadi. At dinner, Maria kept talking about how long it had been.The first few times, it was heartwarming, but then it became almost nagging.When she started talking about how I could have stayed a homesteader rather than going to university, Rafi and I exchanged weary, eye rolling looks.Maria missed it and made the mistake of trying to enlist Rafis help.Rafis always talking about how much he misses you, arent you, dear?Wouldnt you like it if Auntie Grace lived with us on the homestead?I was startled.How did we get from visiting more often to moving in entirely?I think she should live her own life, Rafi muttered.Maria was furious.Rafi!You apologize to your aunt right now!Its all right, Maria, he Ioan overrode my protests.Your mothers right.Apologize.Rafi glared at him.Youre always messing things up.I hate you!Now I was shocked.Rafi!He pushed away from the table and stood up, giving me a look that was both anguish and reproach.Then he shook his head in frustration and ran out of the room.Little Gracie looked wide eyed from parent to parent, jaws motionless, her last mouthful still bulging in her cheeks.Teenagers, Ioan said carelessly with a reassuring smile, smoothing his daughters hair.They hate everybody at that age.He looked at me, still smiling.His foot gently bumped mine under the table, and for a full second I didnt feel inclined to pull away.Then something buzzed on my wrist, distracting me.I slapped at it absently, and it went away.I kept up my mask of indifference pretty well, but that night Ioan haunted my dreams in a way he hadnt done in years.Memories and might have beens tangled in a mad jumble.I remembered how it felt when our hearts and minds came together at a time when I thought I love you meant forever.I dreamed I had never left; I was in Marias place, and Rafi was truly my son.It made me angry and confused.The ability to know anothers mind does not preclude the likelihood of misunderstanding it.That was true.I knew that all too well, and thats why I hadnt married him.Then why was I dreaming about him again?I avoided him by spending more time with Maria.It was her Id come to see, anyway.If anyone had asked me what I was looking for, I couldnt have answered them.Some things you know more by intuition than by reasoning.I told myself that I just wanted to be reassured that Maria was happy and Ioan was behaving himself, but to tell the truth, her unwavering contentedness was beginning to aggravate me.What with that and the dreams, mostly I just felt guilty and mad at myself.Then one afternoon, after a large Sunday lunch, when we were sitting in the living room with the children sprawled on the carpet playing cards, Maria tried a little too hard.You know, we could use another pair of hands on the homestead, Maria said.Youre helping those Sadiri with their homesteadings.Dont you think family should come first?Her smile was oddly fixed.I frowned a bit at that.Why would you say that?You know its not like that.Then explain it to me.Here you have people who love you, who want you to be part of the family, and you act like you can barely stand to see us!Her voice cracked.Rafi stiffened, not looking at her but listening hard.Gracie stood up and went to stare out of the window.Ioan sat straighter and made a movement as if about to rest a pacifying hand on his wifes shoulder, then seemed to decide against it.Maria, youre not making sense!I said, aghast that she looked on the edge of tears.Whats the matter with you?You can have him if you want, you know.Thats the only thing keeping you away.You can have Ioan, she cried out, right in front of the children and all.I was thunderstruck.Then, when she finally burst into tears, I knew.Ioan went to her, speaking to her quietly.She got up and left the room without looking at anyone, and after a moment, still silent and expressionless, Gracie followed her.Rafi stayed, eyes wide with something like fear as he stared at his father.I knew how he felt as I too stared at Ioan.That was you.I know that was you.I got up and backed away from him.I didnt mean for her to get that intense.She always was a little too susceptible, Ioan replied with a sad, sweet smile.You bastard, I said.I warned you: if you hurt her, if you hurt any of my family, I will deal with you!Im not hurting them, he protested.I take good care of them.Theyre happy.Happy little puppets, I spat, gripping my right wrist in an effort not to slap him.I should report you to the authorities.You wont, he said simply.You love me.Never stopped.It doesnt work on me, Ioan.It never did, and thats why you couldnt keep me.That and a small problem you have with honesty.You like life to be easy, dont you, with everything and everyone exactly as you like.It was just a mistake, Shadi, but I do love you.I shouldnt have given up on us.I want you to stay.We all do.Cant you see that?He was pleading now, using words and gestures alone, unpracticed and desperate.My gaze rested on the one person in the room I trusted.He looked up at me helplessly.Rafi loves me so much that hes willing to let me go, I said.Thats what I see.Rafi jumped up and grabbed my hand, and we ran out of the house.I didnt know where we were supposed to be running to or why, but it seemed like a good idea to get as far away from Ioan as possible.Unfortunately, when I glanced back, I saw that he was right behind us, moving at a leisurely pace, knowing we had nowhere to go.But Rafi knew where to go, and in a little while a growing, humming vibration that had been pressing on my ears turned into a recognizable noise.It was the shuttle, landing once more in the field near the orchard.Fergus disembarked first, looking moody and suspicious as usual.Dllenahkh followed.He wore a novices robe with the hood up, which I thought rather suited him and gave him a very peaceful air.They came walking briskly toward us over the grass.Dllenahkh looked almost relieved to see me.We have been calling you for some time.Did you forget our departure date?I looked at the comm on my wrist.Fourteen missed callswhen the hell did that happen?And was it really Sunday already?Fergus, Dllenahkh, Im sorry!My comm must have malfunctioned, and then I forgot.I dont know what to say.Ioan came to my rescue.Im sorry.The reception out here is so variable.And weve been completely monopolizing herits no wonder she forgot.No problem, Fergus said.Were hours early.The Commissioner wont expect us till evening.I looked at him anxiously.His face was relaxed, smiling even, in fact, completely unlike him.I can leave now if you like, I said, suddenly frantic.Fergus waved a hand.No worries.Stay a while with your family.I can run the Councillor back to Ophir now, pick you up whenever you like.Its only a half hour trip.An hour round trip, I tried to remind him, a firmness to my voice that I did not feel.I felt hemmed in and scared.I wouldnt want to keep the Councillor waiting, hinted Ioan helpfully.Dllenahkh, who had been silent for all of this, quietly put back his hood and stared at Ioan.No.I dont think so.Ioan literally faltered, taking a step back.Dllenahkh continued to look sternly at him, then rested a hand on Ferguss shoulder, an uncharacteristically tactile gesture.Sergeant Fergus, would you be so kind as to go start up the shuttle?Fergus blinked, nodded slowly, and went back inside the shuttle.Rafi looked up at Dllenahkh with an expression of immense relief and gratitude.Ill go get her stuff.Thank you, said Dllenahkh, inclining his head.His gaze followed the boy as he ran off, then returned to fix coldly on Ioan.Rafi soon returned, out of breath, with my bag.I took it from him and made an impossible promise.Itll be all right.Ill make it right, I swear.He nodded, his eyes bright with tears, and ran back into the house.I gave Ioan one glance, then retreated to the shuttle with Dllenahkh at my back.He gave Fergus the order to lift off, then faced me with a very somber look.I apologize.I should have realized earlier that you needed help.I was breathing more easily as I looked out the window and watched the homestead getting farther away.Its all right.Ioan knows he cant get to me.I just wish I could do something for Maria.Its not right, the way he treats her.Then you should report him, Dllenahkh said, his tone adamant.I understand that there are procedures for dealing with Cygnians who have strong psi abilities and use them inappropriately.He does love her, I mumbled.And they might take Gracie and Rafi away from themthat would be horrible.Nevertheless, Dllenahkh said gently, he was prepared to force you to stay with them.Can you overlook that?He knows he cant get to me, I repeated sulkily.I would have gotten out of there.Not being ungrateful for your help or anything.I just dont think its serious enough to warrant a report.Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed Fergus give Dllenahkh a quick sideways glance.Delarua, look at me.Dllenahkhs voice was still gentle, but there was a hint of steel in it.I faced him angrily.Dont you Delarua me.I told you, I can handle it!Then let us be sure.Let me touch your mind, a brief touch only, to be certain that he has not influenced you.A sick feeling shot through me.I stood up and stumbled to the back of the shuttle.Keep away from me, I whispered, turning my head so they couldnt see the tears starting.Delarua Dllenahkh said again, implacable.Dont touch me, dont you dare come near me Delarua!This time it was Fergus, shouting over his shoulder from the pilots seat.This isnt you!Cant you see that?You have to trust the Councillor, because I am not setting down this shuttle until I know for a fact that you are in your right mind!He heaved a frustrated breath and continued.Ive been through training for this kind of thing, learning to recognize when someones tampered with your thoughts.And let me tell you, that man back there?Hes subtle.Hes good.Ive never known a Cygnian that could do what he did just now.Dont underestimate him.I slumped to the floor.I wanted it all locked up in my mind: the dreams, my secret longings.I thought about the shame it would bring on my family to have all this known.I pulled my knees up to my chest and pressed my fists into my eyes, struggling to be calm, to breathe deeply, to think clearly.When I lowered my hands and opened my eyes, Dllenahkh was kneeling in front of me.His face was neutral, with no trace of judgment.I spoke softly.A brief touch only?You wont look at my thoughts, my memories?He nodded.A brief touch.Not an invasion, not a link.Only what you permit.I bowed my head.A moment later, I felt his fingertips brush my forehead and press firmly as if setting his fingerprints there.Then they withdrew.That was all.I looked up, relieved.There!Thats taken care of Then it came flooding back.All the times Id silenced my own comm, the forced surge of an old passion long laid to rest, dreams that were not of my minds making, and every look of disappointment and despair that poor Rafi had given me.That bastard, I choked out.That bastard!Dllenahkh stood up and backed away gracefully.Adrenaline pushed me to my feet, and I slammed the wall behind me with a fist.Fergus, how much longer to Ophir?Twelve minutes, maam, he said.The words sounded as if they were coming through a savage grin.I marched back to my seat.Make it five.I need to speak to the Commissioner as soon as possible.Dllenahkh returned to his seat beside me.I looked at him steadily, still feeling that slick veneer of shame over my thoughts but refusing to give in to it.And Dllenahkhthank you.He only inclined his head in response, but I imagined I saw a hint of approval amid his neutrality.I didnt know why he was being so generous.He had gone straight into the heart of a brewing riot with nothing but his principles to arm and shield him.I was finally standing up for the truth after fifteen years wasted in equivocation.Yes, equivocation.It was still my call, still my responsibility.If there was one thing that shook me after Ioans influence was wiped from my mind, it was the realization that he never manipulated an emotion that wasnt already present to some degree, no matter how small.I remembered this as I went to Qeturah.It helped keep my anger and motivation high.I went straight to where she was sitting in the conference room, going over the last of the inquiry notes with Joral, Nasiha, and Tarik.She looked up at me.Im here to talk to you directly.My throat closed up, making my voice crack, but I gritted my teeth and pushed the words past the barrier.I have a problem, and I need your help.Zero hour plus one year one month nine days Dllenahkh stood on the main balcony of the hotel and regarded the city streets and distant banlieues of Ophir, dreamlike in a haze of damp morning air.He breathed lightly not merely to avoid the moisture but to keep the last of the calming air of the Montserrat monastery deep in his lungs.It had been unusually difficult to put aside the novice robe the night before.Footsteps approached, but he did not turn.Eventually Dr.Daniyel stood beside him and rested her hands lightly on the dew damp stone of the balustrade.Recognizing the diffidence in the gesture, he merely offered a nod of greeting and waited for her to speak.Thank you for helping her, she said quietly.We didnt know.He frowned slightly as he looked at her.We are all of us somewhat damaged, whether or not it may appear on our medical records.She took the gentle rebuke with a rueful smile.I have withdrawn my recommendation that you be removed from the mission team, she informed him.I understand now that the circumstances were unusual, and I trust your ability to function in the future.He bowed his head and lowered his eyes.He did not want to seem rude, but neither did he wish to appear grateful.He settled for staring at the landscape again.First Officer Delarua is insisting that she too is able to continue in her role.Dr.Daniyel spread her hands palms upward.Im not convinced, but I dont like to make the same mistake twice.Theres also the question of her psi profile.He frowned in earnest.I have seen it.It does not match her demonstrated abilities.In light of recent events, no.Cygnians have always been hard to assess.Youd expect something with Ntshune, Sadiri, and Zhinuvian lineage, but some of the strangest things come out of Terraa touch of second sight here, a little miracle there.Most of them are charlatans, its true, but even the simple power to persuade and be persuaded can be a psi ability.Were very good at fooling othersand fooling ourselves.She shook her head, momentarily pensive, then added, Id like you to keep an eye on her not only professionally but personally.He let his surprise show.She trusts you, Dr.Daniyel said.He faced her fully.Does she trust you?She let the rhetorical question pass, her gaze flickering away as if her conscience had been touched.He would have withdrawn once more into quiet courtesy, but the small glimpse of vulnerability made him push harder.Tell me, Commissioner, have you had this same conversation with Delarua?Have you asked her to keep an eye on me?Have you told her that I trust her?She relaxed and laughed lightly.Of course not, Councillor.Dont be silly.I had that conversation with Joral.He smiled in spite of himself, conceding the point.Councillor, she said, gracious in victory, and walked away, leaving him to enjoy the morning view.BACCHANAL Why me?I asked.I mean, I know youve told me, but tell me again why this is supposed to be a good idea?Tarik gave me a look that suggested that he found my nervousness absurd.Your updated psi profile indicates that you have developed an above average ability to discern and suppress imposed emotions.The Board of Inquiry has recommended that we add psi profile data to our genetic and anthropological data, Nasiha continued equably, waving a scanner of some sort over the tiny sensors stuck to my various pulse points and nerve nodes and whatchamacallits.We require Cygnian as well as Sadiri data to calibrate our readings, Tarik resumed.You are the only Cygnian with an operable level of psionic ability on the team.Therefore, you have been assigned to us for testing purposes.Thank you, Qeturah, I muttered sarcastically.Now, what are these for?I waved a hand at four injectors laid out with precision on a tray of implements.To inform you of their contents and effects would compromise the neutrality of the tests, Nasiha said in a tone that was almost soothing, which only increased my worry.Try to relax, added Tarik, easing the medtable from vertical to nearly horizontal with a swiftness that had me gripping the edges.The two Sadiri watched the readouts for a while, looked at each other, and nodded.Nasiha picked up the first injector and pressed it against my arm.I gulped quietly as it hissed its contents into my bloodstream.Seconds passed.Well, I said, slightly relieved, Im not sure what Then I screamed.After an hour spent alternately laughing, weeping, screaming, and mumbling Whoacool!I went to Qeturah to complain.She refused to be swayed.Psionic ability results from a combination of nature and nurture.It cant be measured using genetic data alone, and its an intrinsic part of what it means to be Sadiri.We need this information.Yes, but why me?I asked plaintively.I never scored particularly high on psi tests before.Cant they use some average readings from the database?Qeturah shrugged.This particular method of testing has never been done before.There is no data.Fine, I snapped.Only a few days had passed since Ophir, and already we were back in savanna country, this time at a Division of Forestry and Grasslands outpost that offered a little more comfort than a temporary camp.The aim was to prevent another Candir fiasco through better preparation, and that meant taking an extra week or two to refine our mission brief before continuing to the next assignment on the schedule.Qeturah was working feverishly on documentation with Lians assistance, Fergus was acquiring all kinds of new and exciting survival equipment and regionally appropriate advice from the rangers, Dllenahkh and Joral seemed to be spending an inordinate amount of time in meditation, and Nasiha and Tarik were torturing me.Then Dllenahkh turned up at the next session.Please tell me youre not here to add to my misery, I said with mock cheerfulness.He shot a look at Nasiha and Tarik that didnt reassure me, then sat down beside the medtable.You have found the experience thus far to be intolerable?I struggled with myself.It could have been worse, but really, not having your own emotions under control is pretty miserable, yeah.His mouth twitchedI swear I saw it!But his face was dead calm a moment later, and he said, We apologize for not previously detailing the nature of the experiment to you.However, we had the approval of the Commissioner to He trailed off, constrained by the habit of truth, and amended, The Commissioner conveyed to us the permission of the government to carry out these tests.Thanks for that, I said quietly.I had an inkling Qeturah doesnt really like my involvement in this.She thinks I should be getting therapy.Dllenahkh held my gaze for the precise amount of time necessary to warn me that I should take his next words very, very seriously.And you have refused therapy.I matched his neutral tone.Id have to leave the mission for that.Besides, fifteen years of functioning wont break down in a few months.It can wait.I believe they had hoped to counsel and treat you, your sister, and her children as a family unit.It can wait, I repeated.Some things might go better if Im not there.Now, you were about to tell me whats going on here?He looked away, withdrawing for the moment, and picked up an injector.A simplified explanation will suffice.The contents of these injectors have been designed to stimulate or suppress one of the two ranges of the limbic system that contribute to emotion.One range has satisfaction at one extreme and dysphoria at the other.The other range varies from frenzy to lethargy.The first range is additionally complicated by the fact that it actually consists of two separate scales of pleasure and pain that overlap in the lower values.For example, the emotion categorized as anticipation consists of small elements of pleasure, caused by looking forward to the moment of satisfaction; pain, caused by the fact of the present absence of satisfaction; and frenzy, manifested as an urge to seek out the aforementioned satisfaction.I blinked.Thats fascinating.Complicated little buggers, arent we?Indeed.Incidentally, it is not only those of Terran or Ntshune origin who experience this.It appears to be common, by one physiological mechanism or another, in all humans.I think I felt a mingling of mild pleasure, pain, and frenzy at that point.That was the first specific bit of information hed given me about Sadiri neurology, and I was hoping hed say more.He didnt.At present, Cygnian psi profile tests are designed to detect levels of ability that could significantly impact a persons capacity to function in a largely nonpsionic society.Strong telepaths and empaths are provided with training and a system of ethics to regulate the use of their skills.Most Cygnians are not at the level where this is required.Including me, I said with a frown.So why am I here on this medtable being pumped full of different kinds of crazy juice?Because there are other aspects of psionic ability that the tests do not address, Nasiha interrupted.For example, we have discovered from monitoring our own reactions that you are capable of quite strong empathic projection in two very specific areas.I grinned.I bet I can guess one.Pleasure, right?Yes.That is the stronger one.When your pleasure range was stimulated, Nasiha and I both experienced a strong desire to laugh that was only mitigated by increasing the shielding on our telepathic receptors.Tariks face was so deadly serious, almost mournful, as he admitted this that I had to bite back a laugh.Less intense but still significant was the projection of lethargy, Nasiha continued.I stared at her, taken aback.I bore people?You calm people, Dllenahkh said diplomatically.But it is a much subtler effect.I contemplated the ceiling for a while, processing this.Okay.So how does discerning and suppressing imposed emotions come into this?Because I was completely at the mercy of those injectors, let me tell you.Dllenahkh explained further.It is difficult, if not impossible, to stop the action of chemicals introduced directly into the body.It is, however, possible to shield from external attempts to alter brain and body chemistry.That is the aim of todays session.The three Sadiri around the medtable suddenly seemed to loom with menace.Youre going to try to influence my thoughts and emotions?I squeaked.With your permission, said Dllenahkh.I thought about it.I took a good few minutes while they remained there in silence, waiting on my word.I thought about what Ioan had and had not been able to do to me.I thought about Rafi, who, I strongly suspected, possessed a similar talent to his fathers, and wondered what might become of him in the future.Knowledge is power, I said at last.Lets do it.First, because it was already there to work with, Dllenahkh tried to increase my sense of unease.It worked.I bolted upright, choking as if pulling myself out of quicksand, but then, with an indignant Hah!I exhaled my real tension, turning fear to simple discontent, and pushed back the false sensation with a feeling of triumph.My stars, youre strong.I breathed rapidly, looking at him with wide eyes.Less with the elephant feet, please.He was examining the readouts on the monitor beside my head.My apologies, he said absently.How do you feel?Please use the scales we discussed to describe your emotions.Genuinely?I was a bit up there on the frenzy scale and even a little up on the pleasure scale.You tried to project dysphoria, and it combined with the frenzy to produce fear.So I dumped the frenzy and tossed back the dysphoria.And now I feel quite up there on the pleasure scale, thank you very much.Remarkable, said Dllenahkh.It was better than therapy in a way.While the Sadiri were getting their data and creating their new tests, I was finding out what my strengths were.For example, it seemed that I was even able to control my real emotions far better than youd expect from the way I usually behave.Id just rarely had need to do so, but the proof of it was how I had been able to not only switch off Ioans attempts to make me feel comfortable with him but also damp down my own inclination to feel that comfort.Telepathically, though, I had no talent whatsoever.I could be influenced into doing all manner of nonsensical, trivial things and rationalizing them afterward, like the time I randomly picked up an injector and aimed it at Nasiha, who, fortunately, was agile and aware enough to leap out of the way.If she hadnt shot Dllenahkh a very nasty look for that trick, I would have sworn it was all my idea.Which brings me to another point.I never saw Sadiri the way others do, as being in complete control of their facial expressions.It became clear to me that although I would never have the level of telepathy to fully sense them as they did one another, I did have a level of empathy to detect the emotions that they did not express, though I interpreted it as a physical expression.I once had a raging argument with Lian over the simple premise Joral smiles at you all the time.Lian swore I was crazy; I swore Lian was oversensitive about being the object of a Sadiri crush.Now I understand that Lian honestly couldnt see that faint hint of a smile that Id persuaded myself was there to account for my certainty that Joral derived pleasure from Lians company.Another good thing about the testing was that by the time we were ready to leave, I had acquired some respect for Nasiha and Tarik.They were wrapped up in each otherwell, fair enough.Theirs was one of the few bonds not broken by the disaster, and they deserved to celebrate that.But their professionalism and skill were incontestable, and their dedication to rebuilding Sadiri culture absolute.I found that admirable.Because the settlement we were visiting consisted of widely scattered homesteadings much like the Sadiri one in Tlaxce, we had arranged our schedule to arrive for one of their festivals.People would be gathering at a public area called the Grand Savannah over a period of two days.Initially, we had planned to spend time at one of the major homesteadings and conclude our visit with the festival, but because of the delay we were going to do it the other way around.Our first sight of the Grand Savannah was a long, high berm with an arched entrance cut into the center.Underneath the arch ran a road of flagstones.We came in government vehicles with a wagonload of gear, having left the shuttle at the outpost.Inside the earth walled enclosure was a huge field with a tent city, the colors so bright and the designs so varied that it looked like a scattering of kites on the ground waiting to take flight.There were rangers there acting as marshals, and they pointed us to a space where we could set up our camp.We hadnt been there more than fifteen minutes before a visitor arrived.Welcome to the Grand Savannah!Do I have the honor of addressing Dr.Qeturah Daniyel, head of this government mission and renowned academic in her own right?The words were measured, even stately, but there was hidden laughter in the tone.When I saw the speaker and the suppressed smile and almost wink that passed between him and Qeturah, I instantly had the impression of some shared encounter in the past.He was a notable man of the tall and distinguished variety, but there was something irreverent in the gleam of his eye that warned of a love of fun. Qeturah, in contrast, looked unusually shy and coquettish.Must have been some encounter.Leoval, she said, and her voice seemed richer and more resonant as she held out her hand to be kissed.Not too old for this yet?Leoval gave her a droll look of mock injury. Qeturah!What a suggestion!Introductions were made.At first, when he bent over my hand as well, I feared he was an incorrigible flirt, but when he proceeded to clasp arms with Fergus and Lian and bow to the Sadiri gravely with the appropriate phrase in perfectly accented Sadiri, I realized I was in the presence of a consummate diplomat.I was right too.He was a retired civil servant, and he had been one of the first anthropologists to revisit and update ancient research on the region.He made Qeturah promise to come visit him, telling her to send word by a marshal and he would have a sedan chair come around for her.Then, with that carefully modulated sense of courtesy, he bid his farewells and departed.What an interesting man, I said innocently.Qeturah gave me a sharp look.Yes, she replied firmly.He is.And a gentleman.He always found ways to help me without ever once mentioning the dreaded phrase Dalthis Syndrome.Like offering to send a chair for me thats his kindness all over.I hesitated, then decided to speak my thought.Dalthis Syndrome?Isnt that a treatable genetic condition?Yes, it is, but Ive never liked the idea of flipping the switches on my own genes, Qeturah said in a matter of fact tone.Seems like cheating.I was more than surprised to hear this.It was a bit like learning your local butcher is a vegetarian.Besides, Qeturah continued calmly, for some time I had unresolved issues about being the weak one of the family.My siblings used to tease me and say no homesteader would ever marry me, because Id be as much work to take care of as the homestead and my children would probably be weaklings too.When you start thinking of yourself as damaged goods, you put up defenses to make sure no one has the chance to reject you, so I told myself I would never get married, never have children, and never do anything to change who I was.It was only after I had my own status, my own money, and the contraceptive benefits of menopause that I began to allow myself to have a different view.Playing the cards Id been dealt became my badge of honor, not a burden.I was silent for a while, almost shocked that she was being so blunt and open with me, but then my eyes narrowed and my jaw tightened slightly.I didnt realize we were in session.Im only doing what I can.Delarua, have you been in any serious relationships over the past fifteen years?Hot, sudden anger flashed through me, but I kept control of myself, merely giving her a reproachful look before I walked off to lose myself in the crowd.Stick to genetics, I called back over my shoulder.Your counselings a bit off today.Ah, look, a breakthrough, she said with a wry smile, but she let me go.Gilda had always teased me, saying that I had a talent for surrounding myself with safe or unavailable men.I used to tell her that if she understood the meaning of the word professionalism, she wouldnt have to speculate about my love life or lack thereof.But now Qeturah had me wondering, what were my Ioan issues?When I first left, did he selfishly set something in my mind to make sure Id never get attached to someone else?Or was it my own doing; was I afraid that attracting a man like Ioan once might mean I was doomed ever after to fall for that type?Perhaps I made men possessive and manipulative, because it seemed to me that Ioan hadnt been all that bad fifteen years ago.I hated the last one in particular, because I now had empirical evidence that I could project significantly on the pleasure scale.Was I like some bad drug, ruining good men?I was growing disgusted with my own self pity.Fortunately, a distraction immediately appeared.He walked past me with a swagger, a bottle in each hand, and in his eye a twinkle that wouldnt understand the concept of rejection if it was explained to him in nine languages and fourteen dialects.Then he paused and turned back.Im off to hear the bands.Would you like to come, my lovely?I looked at him.What he didnt have in looks he made up for in self confidence.Yeah.Why ever not, I saidand yes, there was a little bit of Ill show them all!in my decision.The music was good.The stuff in the bottle was good.There was alcohol in there, but mainly it was surprisingly thirst quenching in the heat yet terribly more ish at the same time.The crowd was energetic, and there was much dancing.I lost my first acquaintance and found several more friends in succession, finally sticking with a rather nice young man called Tonio who lookedwell, maybe he looked a bit like Ioan, but only a little, okay?I forgot about the rest of the team entirely until Joral turned up where I was sprawling on the steep angle of a berm, still listening to the drums and pipes on the field below and Tonios snoring as he napped beside me.Joral looked a little apprehensive, moving as if he hoped to preserve a small exclusionary zone around himself.I watched with a smirk as two young women breached the zone, danced up against him, and moved on, leaving him frozen, as if unsure whether to be glad or appalled.Finally he pulled himself together and clambered up to where I was sitting.Enjoying yourself, Joral?I asked blandly, handing him the bottle.He looked at it blankly for a moment and then, in response to my hand gestures, tipped some of the contents carefully into his mouth.His eyes widened slightly, and he made a considering moue.Piquant and refreshing, he proclaimed, and handed it back.I am finding the experience very educational.The Commissioner informed me that she already has a significant amount of genetic data for this settlement, and while the phenotype is mostly Terran, there are sufficient taSadiri genes in the population that a combination of selection and switching could easily produce a child of Sadiri appearance and physiology.Moreover, the anthropological data clearly show that a number of Sadiri traditions have been retained.Is this festival a Sadiri tradition?I asked, having drunk and passed the bottle to him again.He took a good gulp, no longer shy, and returned it.In fact, it is not.While it does appear to have a few features of certain ancient festivitiesexcept with less blood andumother activitiesits origin is Terran, specifically the festival of Carnival.Farewell to the flesh, said my linguistic self mockingly.It needs to be followed by a fast to be true, not preceded by one.Ido not understand.I passed him the bottle once more in apology and answer.He drained it.This beverage is delicious.May I have another?I hauled another two bottles out of a nearby cooler and gave him one.He popped it open and immediately took a swig.I looked down at the Savannah.If we stay here for a couple more hours, well get to see the fire dancing.That should be good.Oh, I forgot to askdid you come to find me for a specific reason?Silence.I turned to Joral.He was contemplating the already half empty bottle in his hand with a strange little smile.Oh.Yes.Councillor Dllenahkh wishes me to tell you that after the festival, we will have a meeting with some of the elders of the settlement.Joral, are you feeling all right?I asked, concerned at the look on his face.He turned to me and smiled fully, which completely freaked me out.I feel fine, Delarua, just fine.I wonder if I should go down and try a bit of dancing.It doesnt look that hard.I hit my comm immediately.Nasiha!Somethings wrong with Joral!Hes smiling.I think hes drunk.Nasiha spoke with her usual calm.How much has he had to drink?About four hundred mils ofsomething, I stammered, trying and failing to find enlightenment on my bottles label.Theres alcohol in it.Six percent.That is far too little to affect a Sadiri, she mused.Can he still walk?Ye esIm not sure.Joral, stand up.He did so obligingly, canting on the incline of the berm with a stability that hinted at least at physical sobriety.I feel fine!I am standing up.Tell her I am standing up!Hmm, Nasiha said.Joral, return to the camp immediately.I escorted him back to camp, which is to say I herded him like an inexperienced sheepdog as he pinballed his way through the crowd, dancing from partner to partner. Nasiha and Tarik were waiting, and they immediately gripped him by the elbows and hustled him into one of the shelters.I followed them in time to see them wrestling him down onto a cot, still protesting that he was fine.They quickly took a blood sample, tested his breath, and looked at his eyes.Then they looked at me accusingly.This is not inebriation, said Tarik.Well, dont look at me, I wailed.Look at this!I waved the bottle at them.Yeah, thatll do it.I jumped.It was Tonio.I had been so preoccupied with Joral that I hadnt noticed when he woke up and followed us.He stood casually in the entrance of the shelter, completely unworried by the scene before him. Thatll do it, he said again.Its got fireberry juice in it.And what, said Nasiha severely, is fireberry juice?Its like another kind of alcohol, you know?Kinda takes the edge off your emotions and calms your thoughts but doesnt take out your legs or fuzz up your head.Mothers give it to their kids to settle them down, no worries.Works great on teenage boys, especially when they start to getyknow.He shrugged and flicked an expressive eyebrow upward while realigning the crotch of his trousers with a practiced cup and shake of his hand.Nasiha and Tarik looked at each other, then stared at Tonio.Tell us more about this fireberry juice, said Tarik.Well, here, try some.The enterprising Tonio took a small flask from his pocket and handed it to Tarik.Tarik opened the flask cautiously, poured a tiny amount into a clean sample cup, and sipped it.Intriguing, he commented.Nasiha took the cup from him and drained the remainder.Most interesting, she agreed.But this makes no sense, I complained.Why would it make Joral more emotional?Oh, forgot about that, said Tonio helpfully.Also removes inhibitions, like alcohol.Bit of a paradox.Feel less, express more.The two standing Sadiri were looking at him very curiously.This calls for further research, said Nasiha.Can you take us to someone who makes this beverage?Sure!Tonio said cheerfully.He went out, Tarik and Nasiha followed, and just as I was bringing up the rear, Nasiha turned and said pointedly to me, Someone should stay with Joral.I grimaced.Fine.Watching Joral very quickly turned into watching Joral sleep.I put him in the recovery position just in case some nasty after reaction should occur and curled up on a nearby cot, listening bitterly to the shouts and cheers and drumbeats of the fire dance show I was missing.A shadow appeared at the entrance.Tarik?I called out, tapping on a light.No, came Dllenahkhs voice.Nasiha has just informed me about Jorals condition.How is he?I sat up and yawned and looked over at Joral.Still sleeping peacefully, it appears.Where are Nasiha and Tarik?A very strange expression came over Dllenahkhs face.It was the look of a man who had seen things he could not unsee.Dancing, he said shortly.I gaped.Beg pardon?They decided to test the effects firsthand by sampling the various beverages that contain the active ingredient.They are nowblending in.A faint, cool disapproval touched his voice.Well, good for them, I say.After all that madness they put me through, Im glad theyve got the guts to experiment on themselves.But I still dont get it.Whats the big deal about this stuff?Dllenahkh moved to pick up a handheld and came to sit beside me on the cot.Perhaps a look at the data will clarify matters.Here is a summarized form of the data collected from the sensors during your experiment.And here he tapped and went to split screen view is the summary for Sadiri data. Nasiha was the test subject, naturally, in order to maintain sex as a constant variable when comparing your readings. These are Sadiri readings, I said, tracing the line of data.Those are the markers of the biochemical reactions we experience during sensory input and processing, yes.And these are mine, I said, tracing a much lower set of values. How do you live with that? I asked with muted awe. Carefully. With meditation and strict adherence to the disciplines, he replied. But without this high neural sensitivity, we could not be who we are. We would not be able to pilot the mindships, nor could we sense one another, communicate with one another, form telepathic bonds with one another. I gave a slow nod of admiration.
