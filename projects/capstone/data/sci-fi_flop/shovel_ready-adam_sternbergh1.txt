My name is Spademan.Im a garbageman.this fucker.I dont care.Dont you want Just a name.I have his address.Great.See this fucker I said dont.Okay.The less I know, etcetera.How much?What I said.To the account I mentioned.And how will I You wont hear from me again.But how do I The dead guy.Thats how.I dont want to know your reasons.If he owes you or he beat you or she swindled you or he got the promotion you wanted or you want to fuck his wife or she fucked your man or you bumped into each other on the subway and he didnt say sorry.I dont care.Im not your Father Confessor.Think of me more like a bullet.Just point.best friends.At least thats what I thought.Then it turns out shes fucking him.Please, maam.I will disconnect.And this number doesnt work twice.Wait.Is this safe?Which part?Arent they listening?Of course.So?Doesnt matter.Why not?Picture America.Okay.Now picture all the phone calls in all the cities in America.Okay.Now picture all the people in all the world who are calling each other right now trying to plot ways to blow America up.Okay.So who the fuck do you think is going to care about you and your former best friend?I see.Will you tell her No.Will you tell her when you see her that it was me who sent you.It was me.Im not FedEx.I dont deliver messages.Understand?Yes.Good.Now the name.Just the name.I kill men.I kill women because I dont discriminate.I dont kill children because thats a different kind of psycho.I do it for money.Sometimes for other forms of payment.But always for the same reason.Because someone asked me to.And thats it.A reporter buddy once told me that in newspapers, when you leave out some important piece of information at the beginning of a story, they call it burying the lede.So I just want to make sure I dont bury the lede.Though it wouldnt be the first thing Ive buried.It might sound hard but its all too easy now.This isnt the same city anymore.Half asleep and half emptied out, especially this time of morning.Light up over the Hudson.The cobblestones.At least I have it mostly to myself.These buildings used to be warehouses.Now theyre castles.Tribeca, a made up name for a made up kingdom.Full of sleeping princes and princesses, holed up on the highest floors.Arms full of tubes.Heads full of who knows.And theyre not about to come down here, not at this hour, on the streets, with the carcasses, with the last of the hoi polloi.Yes, I know the word hoi polloi.Read it on a cereal box.I never liked Manhattan, even back when everyone still liked it, when people still flocked from all over the world to visit and smile and snap photos.But I do like the look of Tribeca.Old industrial neighborhood, a remnant from when this city used to actually make things.So I come across the river in the early morning to walk around here before dawn.Last quiet moment before people wake up.Those who still bother waking up.Used to be youd see men with dogs.This was the hour for that.But there are no dogs anymore, of course, not in this city, and even if you had one, youd never walk it, not in public, because it would be worth a million dollars and youd be gutted once you got around the corner and out of sight of your trusty doorman and your own front door.I did see a man once walking a million dollar dog.On a treadmill, in a lobby, behind bullet proof glass.Feed bag delivery boy on a scooter zips past me, up Franklin, tires bouncing over the cobblestones.Engine whines like hes driving a rider mower, killing the morning quiet.Cooler on the scooter carries someones liquid breakfast.Lunch and dinner too, in IV bags.Now its just nurses and doormen and feed bag delivery boys out at this hour.Tireless members of the service economy.Like me.Phone rings.and how old is she?Eighteen.You sure about that?Does it matter?Yes.Quite a bit.Well, shes eighteen.Got a name?Grace Chastity Harrow.But she goes by a new name now.Persephone.Thats what her friends call her, so I hear.If she has any friends.Where is she?New York by now.I assume.Thats not much to go on.Shes a dirty slut junkie Calm down or I hang up.So youre just a hunting dog?Is that it?Something like that.Just a bloodhound in a world of foxes?Look, you need a therapist, thats a different number.Shes somewhere in New York, so far as I know.She ran away.I have to ask.Any relation?I thought this was no questions.This matters.To whom?To me.No, I meant any relation to whom?T.  K.  Harrow.The evangelist.Now why should that matter?Famous people draw attention.Its a different business.Different rates.As I said, Ill pay double.Half now, half later.All now, and as I said, I need to know.Yes.She betrayed his I dont care.But youll do it?A fake name in a big city.Not exactly a treasure map.More like a mile of beach and a plastic shovel.She said she was headed to New York.To the camps.They call her Persephone.Thats a start, right?I guess well find out.May I ask you another question?Go ahead.You can kill a girl, just like that?Yes I can.Fascinating.Before you transfer that money, you better make sure you ask yourself the same thing.I hang up and write a single word on a scrap of paper.Persephone.Pocket it.Then take the SIM card out of the phone, snap it, and drop the phone down a sewer grate, hidden beneath the cobblestone curb.No motives, no details, no backstory.I dont know and I dont want to know.I have a number and if youve found it, I know youre serious.If you match my price, even more so.Once the money arrives, it starts.Then it ends.Waste disposal.Like I said.Its an old joke, but I like it.Truth is, I never spend the money.2.I start at the camps.The biggest ones Central Park.At first the rich at the rim of the park hired private guards to chase them out, tear down their tents, send them scurrying, by any means necessary.Then there was a couple of incidents, a few headlines, then a skinning.Private guards got creative.Peeled a kid and hung him upside down from a tree.That didnt play well, even in the Post.All thats over now.The rich never come out to the park anymore, could give a shit about Strawberry Fields, the camps have been here three, four years, long past anyone caring.Dozens of pup tents, like rows of overturned egg cartons.Dirty faces.Drum circles and dreadlocks.I ask around.The first person who knows her has a forehead full of fresh stitches.Bitch cut my face.Band of white peeks up over his waistband.Not boxers.Bandages.Looks like she didnt stop there.He picks at a stitch.Hardy har har.Kid nearby pipes up.I knew her.Cute girl.Quiet.Pink knapsack.Wouldnt let anyone near it.You know what was in it?Drugs, be my guess.Thats what most people hold on to tightly around here.Hes a skinny kid with a shaved head, sprawled out on a ratty towel.Sleeveless t shirt and sweatpants and thousand dollar sneakers, barely smudged.The kind of kid whos used to having other people run his errands for him.I ask him the last time he left the park.Me?Why?Truce with the cops seems cherry enough.You have everything you need right here?More like I dont have anything I dont need, you feel me?Pretty girl peeks her head out of his tent before he shoos her back inside.Then he shoots me a look like, What can you do?Duty calls.I ignore it.How well did you know her?Persephone?Not as well as I would have liked.Common theme among the dudes living here, by the way.You make a move?Ask my friend with the stitches how that would have worked out.So where did she go?Just left in the night, far as I know.I woke up and all her stuff was gone.Most of my stuff too.Any clue where she was headed?No.But if you find her, tell her I want my blanket and my stash of beef jerky back.You mind if I talk to your friend in the tent?Smiles.Shrugs.Shes all yours.Pretty girl.Young.Far from home.Overalls and a red bandana tied over hair she cut herself.Seems sisterly.Figure shes more the type Persephone might have opened up to.I tap on the tent, then we walk out of earshot.we werent close.Talked a few times.Then I heard she left.Why?Made too many enemies.Or rather, unmade too many friends.Headed to Brooklyn, was what I heard.Maybe towards family.That helps.By the way, youre not the only one come asking around for her.Do tell.Southern guy.Buzz cut.Those mirrored glasses, what do you call them Aviators.Thats it.How long ago?Maybe a day.Maybe yesterday.I say thanks.Then ask her a few things I shouldnt.How long you been here?Me?A year, give or take.Wheres home?Here.Before that?Dont matter.And how old are you?Look, you cant fuck me, if thats what youre asking.Thats not what Im asking.Well, maybe you can.Dont give up too easy.Thanks for your time.Viva la revolucin.So it turns out my Persephone has a reputation.Everyone knows someone who knows someone who knows.The people who got too close to her usually have some memento.Something permanent, in the process of healing.3.Like I said, I dont like Manhattan.Like Brooklyn even less.Personal reasons.But I dont like Brooklyn.Never been to Staten Island.The Bronx only on business.Queens I could take or leave.But then, Im from Jersey.Wrong side of the river.So maybe my aversion is hereditary.Though to tell the truth, aversion and hereditary are both words my father never would have used.Might have cuffed me if he heard them coming out of my mouth.He was a garbageman.A real one.The kind with garbage.Didnt like pretension.Didnt like the word pretension.But he loved Jersey.That much he gave me.I even tried to live in Brooklyn once, believe it or not.Didnt take.But I tried it.Thanks to my wife.I had a wife.Believe it or not.And I was a garbageman too, if youre interested, a real one.The kind with garbage, like my dad.Left that too.Left most everything eventually.Whatever hadnt already been taken away.Now I kill people.The end.People get upset when you say you kill people.Fair enough.But wait.What if I told you I only kill serial killers?Its not true, but what if I told you that?Now what if I told you I only kill child molesters?Or rapists?Or people who really deserve it?Wavering yet?Okay, now what if I told you I only kill people who talk loudly in movie theaters?Or block the escalator?Or cut you off in traffic?Dont answer.Think it over.Not so self righteous now.Im just kidding.Theres no such thing as movie theaters anymore.Subway, wheezing, barely makes it over the bridge, though I swear I feel that way every time.The problem in this city used to be too many people.Now its not enough.And when only poor people use something, no one takes care of it.Roads, schools, neighborhoods.Subways too.Rusted out, empty, watch the track slats pass as we travel.Moaning drunk curled in a corner, already done for the day.Pissed his pants, and not recently either.Now to Brooklyn, that victim of tides.My father took me to the beach once, pointed toward the water, eighty yards out.I thought, No way that ocean ever gets back to here.Two hours later, it was lapping at our ankles.And I thought, stupidly, No way it ever goes back out to there.Money comes, the people come.Money goes, the people recede.After the blackouts they left, then after the boom they came back, then after the attacks they left again.Not everyone, of course.Just the people whod tried to turn Brooklyn into the suburbs, got a whiff of a dirty bomb, figured fuck it, and moved to the regular suburbs.Anyway, tides out now.Brownstones are back to being barren.Concrete blocks where windowpanes went.Concrete blocks are the blind mans stained glass, someone once told me.After the attacks, the second ones, the whole borough emptied out.A boom, bust, and bang economy.The squatters and lesser vagrants just moved right back in.Like they were returning from a long vacation.The Brooklyn camps in Prospect Park are more scattered, less crowded, less refugee pile up, more Cub Scout jamboree.Tambourines and Hacky Sacks.Come nuclear winter, Hacky Sacks will prevail.A lone sack, being hackyed, on some burnt out horizon.Well know civilization, and jam bands, survived.I ask around.Same stories.She moved through here, quickly.I could have guessed.Not long for camps.She seems to attract the unwanted element in the open air.Luckily the next step isnt too hard to figure.Supposedly shes headed toward family.And it turns out that her father, T.  K.  Harrow, the most famous evangelist in America, has a famous financier brother living in Brooklyn.Yes, I know the word financier.Just dont ask me to say it out loud.In my business, the disadvantage of the famous is that they draw more attention.The advantage is that you can find out almost anything you need to know in about fifteen minutes, either online, from public records, or through a few well placed calls.Because you know who has a good idea of who lives where?Garbagemen.They notice.Know addresses.Not everyone.But the notable ones.So I make a few well placed calls.Find out a certain Lyman Harrow lives in a mansion in Brooklyn Heights.Likes to throw things out.Expensive things.Keepsakes.People remember.Which is why I keep a few well paid contacts who are still in the garbage business.Theyre not nosy.I just tell them I work on missing persons.Dont tell them how the persons end up missing.I dont care at all, and even I find this house beautiful.Brownstone, limestone, some kind of moneystone.Real stained glass, the kind for people with eyes.And four armed guards, making their hardware visible.I wait and watch from across the street.I used to ride this route, back when I lived in Brooklyn, back before Times Square, so I can remember when neighborhoods like these were basically sponges to soak up all the excess cash sloshing over from across the river.All these grand old brownstones, bought up and gutted.Scaffolding like skeletons.Blue tarps like funeral shrouds.Crews of Mexicans tearing out the drywall.Armed with hammers.Wearing dust masks.Eating lunch on the stoops, dusted white.Haunting these houses like ghosts.No one ever wanted to keep the insides of these old houses.Just the facades.Thats what they always said about brownstones.Good bones.So it was out with the old, in with the expensive and new designed to look like its old.Gut renovations.The insides torn out and tossed in a dumpster out front.I know, because I used to pick up all the trash.But then disaster struck and Brooklyn got seedy.Now gangs of men with masks and hammers might still visit your brownstone, but theyre not coming to renovate your kitchen.Still, a few stubborn holdouts hang on.Wall Street types like Lyman Harrow, who cant stomach the thought of ever running from anything.Everyone leaves, Lyman Harrow hires security.Everyone scurries, Lyman Harrow hunkers down.Lyman Harrow, his butler, and his four armed guards.And he assumes his money should function like a moat.Which, in his defense, most of the time, it does.Wall Street types.Funny to call them that.Given theres no such thing as Wall Street anymore either.A nurse comes.Shes an unusually pretty nurse.Rings the bell.Butler answers.Honest to God butler in white tails and everything.Disappears behind a heavy door.This seems straightforward enough.I ring.Same butler.Im here to see Mr Harrow.Regarding?Its about his niece.Follow me.The butler leads me inside and up a curved staircase.The whole place is wood, highly polished, like its all been carved out from the trunk of one giant dead tree.At the top of the stairs, the butler motions for me to stop.I glimpse that same pretty nurse disappearing through a different doorway down the hall.Her hands held high.Elbows at an angle.Like shes prepping for something sterile.Butlers short but solid.Brazilian maybe.Built for more than polishing silver.Not a linebacker but definitely the kind of guy who, if you ever find yourself in a cage with him, hes the one who winds up walking out.Holds up a white gloved hand.Asks politely.Arms out please.He gives me a quick once over with a metal detector wand.Traces my outstretched arms.Brushes my coat pockets.Wand squeals.He reaches a white gloved hand gingerly into my coat pocket and pulls out a metal Zippo lighter.Flicks it open, fires it, then snaps it shut and places it on a silver tray on a table by the door.Swipes again.Down each inseam.Over my boots.Wand squeals.I shrug.Steel toe.He seems satisfied.In any case, hes mostly just putting on a show.He wants to let me know that, in this house, hes the last line of defense, and hes got more skills on his rsum than just answering the door.Stows the wand back in its stand.Turns a gold knob the size of a softball.And in we go.Lyman Harrow turns from his windows, which look out over Manhattan.You have a view like this, you dont give it up.Am I right?The furniture is mahogany.The smell is old library.The carpets are the expensive kind.With patterns.He opens his arms.He offers drinks.I decline.Well, what can I offer you then?Your niece.Grace Chastity.Youre too late.Shes already gone.My brother sent you, I assume.Thats a fair assumption.Its the only reason I let you in.Apologies for the security.But you know.The rabble.City is thick with them.Not a problem.Harrows half hidden behind a huge desk, which is bare, save for a bottle, half emptied.He pours himself another cognac, his glass as big as a fish bowl.Overall he has the unkempt air of the weird rich.Gray hair past his collar, slicked back with something greasy.Sweatpants and a crisp tuxedo shirt, untucked and open at the throat.Cant tell if hes halfway to getting dressed or just all the way to no longer caring.Then again, its a classic tapper uniform.Perfect attire for the beds.And sure enough, hes got a luxury model tucked away in the corner.Which also explains the nurse I saw.He sips.Do you know why my brother sent you?I hoped youd tell me.Well, hes plenty mad at his daughter, I know that.Mad enough to send her running to me.And to send you after her.And so on.I assume youve met Mr Pilot.Not yet.Okay.You will.In any case, Grace rang my bell.Came from those dirty encampments.But I havent even spoken to T.  K.  in ten, eleven years.And I havent seen Grace since she was a toddler.Swirls his cognac, which looks expensive even from across the room.Sniffs it.Glances up at me.Shes not a toddler now, I can tell you that.I take it you and T.  K.  arent close.No.Especially once I made it clear to him I had no interest in the family business.Which is?Heaven, of course.At least ten generations of holy men.Harrows were converting seasick sailors on the Mayflower.Then savages in the new world.Then anyone whod listen.It was a bull market.We Harrows sell heaven, thats our business.Another sip.Or, at least, we sell tickets.But not you.My brother and I both grew up to be carnival barkers in the end.We just wound up working in different carnivals.If Im going to wail and pray and fall to my knees, I prefer to do it at the stock exchange.And what about your niece?What about her?Did you help her?Oh.No.Im afraid not.Why not?I am among the, I dont know, five hundred richest men in America.And T.  K.  is at least twice as rich as I am, and commands an obedient army besides.If hell do this to get to her, send you and whoever else might follow, what do you think hed do to me if I tried to keep her from his clutches?More cognac.I dont need that trouble.Not for a little girl.My only goal was to get her off my hands as quickly as possible.My hands and my conscience.So then what.She spent the night.I owed her that much.Shes family after all.Then this morning I introduced her to a couple of men.I found them on the Internet.What kind of men?Not the nice kind, Im afraid.Man with a van, that sort of thing.There were two men, actually.And they did come with a van, as advertised.I think they make it their business to find jobs for little girls.You know where they went?I didnt ask.What about the van?Hard to say.It was black.Or blue.Black or blue.Drains his drink.No offense, but I dont generally take to interrogations by my brothers hired helpers.Not Mr Pilot.Surely to God not that maniac Simon.And while you seem perfectly pleasant, Mr Spademan.Mr Spademan, I can honestly say I dont think Id like to see you again.Understood.Thanks for your time.And thank you for stopping by.Say hi to Mr Pilot for me, when you do meet him.He cant be too far behind you.As for me, if youll excuse me, Im going to return to my bed.His unit sits in the corner of the study, tucked away, like a treadmill, though one that obviously gets a lot of use.It, too, looks out over Manhattan.Its titanium, part coffin, part luge sled.Yes, I watch luge.The only winter sport worth watching.That and skeleton, which is like headfirst luge for nihilists.I put on my coat.With this view, I wouldnt think youd need that.The bed I mean.Well, then you dont really understand the bed.He undoes his cuff links, lays them on the desktop.Rolls up his sleeves, gets ready to slip in.Steps out from behind the mahogany desk.Wearing shower slippers.Crazy tycoon toenails, untended.Grown out like talons.Head of a financier.Feet of a gargoyle.Notices me noticing.Thomas will show you out.Thanks for coming by, Mr Spademan.Like I said.Of course.The butler walks me out of the study discreetly, leaves me in the hall, then returns to help Lyman Harrow tap in.That sure is a top of the line bed.Yes sir.Thank you for coming by.Good day.We stand on the moneystone stoop.Look, if theres anything you remember about those men who came I really should be getting back inside.any marks or details.The butler considers.Looks like he could use a nudge.Think about this.Mr Harrows brother sent me to do the same thing those men are going to do, except Ill be a lot quicker.With nothing extracurricular.The butler looks away.Considers.Then holds up one white glove.Points to the back of his hand.One of the men.He had a tattoo.Right here.Do you remember what it looked like?Like a fishhook.Except twisted.Into the shape of an eight.I pull a marker and a scrap of paper from my pocket.Can you draw it?The butler waves off the paper, uncaps the marker, and sketches it on the back of his own white glove.Holds the glove up again.Sure enough, like he said.A fishhook, twisted into the shape of an eight.&.An ampersand.He caps the marker and hands it back to me.Then peels off the white glove and hands me that too.Pulls a fresh white replacement from his pocket.Dont worry.Mr Harrow gives me plenty of gloves.Likes me to keep my hands as clean as possible.I would imagine.I pocket the drawing.Thank you.He nods and digs a pack of cigarettes from a breast pocket.I wait while he lights one for himself.Then I point to the pack.You mind?He frowns.Then knocks one loose for me.I stick it in my mouth.Smile thanks.Then curse.Goddamn it.Patting pockets.I forgot my lighter.Turn my best hangdog to the butler.Family heirloom.Gift from my grandfather.You mind?Mr Harrow will not want to be disturbed.Finger to my pursed lips.Quiet as a church mouse.Scouts honor.The butlers already started on his cigarette.Considers chucking it.Takes a long drag instead.Nods toward the door.A thanks buddy backslap as I head back inside.Crush the unlit cigarette in my jacket pocket.Never smoked and Im not about to start.Must be the choirboy in me.Dont get me wrong.I went to Sunday school for about ten minutes as a kid.Didnt take.Not the important stuff, anyway.The core beliefs.Right, wrong, etcetera.As you might have guessed.The Zippos still sitting on the dainty silver tray.I snatch it up though its not like I need it.I have a dozen more just like it in a box back home.Buy them in bulk.Turn the gold knob quietly.In Lyman Harrows defense, its true that money often functions like a moat.But not today.Harrow is already swaddled and gone in the bed.Sedatives, feed bag, sensors connected.IV tubes in all the IV holes.That nurse really knows what shes doing.The bed truly is top of the line.Polished touch screens.Metallic surface I can see my face in.Harrow dozing lightly.I lean in.Hes lost in the dream, eyes fluttering under closed lids.I check to make sure hes under, which is more than he deserves.I keep a box cutter stashed in my steel toe boot, by the way.Its enough to set off a metal detector, but then, so is the boot.Not my fault if you dont double check.Pull the box cutter out, extend it, place it against Harrows throat, and pull across, pressing deeply.Hold his forehead down.It works well enough.Watch him bleed out on the leather.Blood puddles on the touch screens.Stained glass.4.Theyll find him but they wont know who did it.Someone named Spademan.Spademans not my real name, by the way.Got it from a garbage can.I head straight up to Montague Street with the white glove in my pocket and look for the first Internet kiosk I can find.Since the beds got up and running, sucking up all the bandwidth, the boring old Internet survives mostly as an afterthought, kept alive like a public utility for people who cant afford to tap in.So, like a decaying neighborhood, all the money in the Internet moved out.And, like a decaying neighborhood, the Internet is now mostly a refuge for poor folks and perverts, people in the shadows, by choice or not.Just a place where you can log on to advertise your junk, then swap it for someone elses junk, then revel for a day in new junk.Or a place where you can find a man with a van to take away your problem little girl.Yes, there are pockets.Niches.Chat rooms where like minded rebellious citizens can scrawl graffiti.Plot upheaval.Organize something like the camps.But for the most part, its just a digital cesspool.Free market, at its freest.I take the first kiosk I find on Montague, though its not really right to call it a kiosk.Its just a screen on a pole, with a metal keyboard sticking out, and a stool on an angle like a cactus arm.I take a seat, tap a key, and swipe a paycard to get started.Not my paycard, of course.Belongs to a car salesman, name of Sidney, who lives out in Canarsie.Or, rather, lived.Apparently, Sidney rubbed someone the wrong way.Who knows.Maybe sold them a lemon.In any case, paycard works fine.I log on and run a search for AMPERSAND+TATTOO.Get back a bunch of photos, but nothing promising.College lit majors, mostly, showing off frosh week mistakes.So I run a search instead for AMPERSAND+BROOKLYN.Same deal.One listing for a local bar for bookish types, long since closed.Behind me, coming down Henry Street, I hear sirens, which is unwelcome.Twin cop cars doppler past in a hurry, lights whirling, whoop whooping like a war party, heading south.I guess the butler finally found Mr Harrow.I pull out the glove the butler gave me.Examine his shaky sketch.&.
