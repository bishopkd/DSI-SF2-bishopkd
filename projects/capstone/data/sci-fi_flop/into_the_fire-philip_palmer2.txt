Just like the moving sidewalk, the first screen we came across immediately realized we had no credit implant, that we were nonpersons, and it occurred to me that maybe somewhere a warning bell might be sounding, that if we had no status or record, they might guess we were escaped Islanders.Not that it worried Jimmy, every few moments he would stop, scrutinize something, nod his head and smile when hed worked out what it was.He was like a kid in a candy store.And yet as the day wore on and still no sign of food or water, he mightve preferred it if that candy store had been real.All three of us were not only hungry ourselves, but were starting to worry about those back in the church.We did manage to pick up a few useful items in a drug store where Jimmy went to find something for Liles cough.We got some organi plasters and bandages and painkillers, thatd fallen down behind the shelves and been missed by earlier looters.Even so, it wasnt much more than a diversion and we all knew it.What we really needed was food and water, and if we didnt find some soon, we were in real trouble.Slowly, as that realization bit ever deeper, our conversation went from concerned to sporadic to a dull nothing.Jimmy lost all interest in new technology and suddenly looked both tired and ten years older.I mean, okay, sleeping bags, warm clothing, medical, all useful stuff, but the first priority had to be something in our bellies.We tried a few more places, supermarkets, delis, but it was no use, and with the night now starting to lock down, the atmosphere was beginning to change.The shadows were growing deeper and darker, the smoke wrapping itself ever tighter around everything.The time had come to get off the streets, to leave them to the real evil doers, and as much as we dreaded returning without food or drink, we began to retrace our footsteps, heading back to the church.I was too immersed in my disappointment to pay much attention to this guy approaching from the opposite direction.There was a fire behind him, all cracking and exploding, so that all I could really make out of him was a dark silhouette.As he got nearer, I could see he was well dressed, around about forty, plainly a well to do Mainlander.It did cross my mind it was a little odd, that he wasnt someone Id expect to see wandering the streets, but nothing more.He slowed and looked us up and down, two oldies and a kid, like he was assessing us for something, then he resumed his previous pace.As he went by, he muttered something out of the corner of his mouth: Food and drink.Victory West.Superfood 7.He was gone before we could even react.What did he say?Jimmy asked.Food and drink, Gordie repeated.Dya know it?Jimmy said, turning to me.If its still the same place, yeah.What dya think?Lets go!Gordie urged.I turned to Jimmy.Cant do any harm.It was amazing what an instant spring to our steps that little piece of information broughtwe began chatting again, speculating on where we were going, if there really was food there.Ill admit we were a little concerned at how wed got the information, but when youre that hungry, I guess the thought of eating overrides everything else.Course, we didnt just march up to the placewere not as dumb as all that.We approached cautiously on the other side of the street, stopping to lurk in the shadows, to see what was going on.And actually, the answer to that was a big fat zero: the place was in complete darkness.No entry had been made, nothing was broken, and the doors and windows all seemed to be intact.You sure this is it?Jimmy asked.Unless they opened another one.We just stood there, something not feeling quite right, but Gordie was all for a little action.Come on.Lets go, he said, turning to head across the street.Whoa!Whoa!I cried, grabbing him by the shoulder and tugging him back.Lets just check it out first, shall we?He gave a rather impatient sigh and slumped back against the wall.The three of us waited in silence, really not sure what we were dealing with, though it wasnt long before we realized we werent alone, that there were others watching from the shadows.See?Gordie whispered angrily.The moment someone makes a move, theres gonna be a stampede.Despite how cautious I felt, I knew he had a point.If we were going to get everything we needed, we had to be some of the first through the door.Okay.Ill get water, I said, knowing it would be the heaviest item.You two just grab whatever you can.He was right: the instant we broke cover all the others came rushing out of their hiding placesfar more of them than Id been expecting.I immediately started to run, knowing it was going to be a free for all, that having cast their doubts aside, everyone was gonna grab what they could.In the absence of any kind of heavy instrument, I hit the door with my shoulder.Theres a moment I always get these daysif Im forced to throw a punch or somethingwhen I wonder if my old bones have become too brittle for that sort of thing, but the door gave way surprisingly easily, its frame crumpling, the glass popping out and smashing on the floor.Quick as you can, I said to Jimmy and Gordie, aware of this jostling mob rapidly converging behind us.Despite it being almost dark inside, I could see there was plenty of stuff to be had.The fridges were still working, which was kind of strange, bearing in mind the lights werent, but as the store behind me erupted with angry shouting, I ran over and stuffed as many bottles as I could into my new backpack, grabbed a large container in each hand, then headed back to the exit, calling across to Jimmy and Gordie.Something was telling me to get out of there as quickly as possible.Some guy tried to grab one of the water containers from me and I had to release it momentarily so I could hit him.I mean, Id got no choice, not the way things were, with water more precious than gold.The funny thing was, as he went down, I suspected I might know him, that he was a fellow Detainee.Not that I cared, not in that moment.I leaned forward and wrenched the water container back, and as I did so, I noticed this guy crouching down behind a display.He was youngI dont know, in his twenties maybe, with long dark hair and one of those masks people wear to avoid infection.But he was too well dressed to be a looterand why the hell was he hiding?What was that in his hand, a weapon?I immediately lunged forward, knocking the display aside so as to get a better look, and as he tried to scramble away I saw what he was trying to hide: it was a camera: a movie camera, and by the look of it, infrared.What the hells going on?I demanded.Everything about his manner was exuding guilt.He never answered, just glanced nervously up over my shoulder in an involuntary gesture, as if looking for help.I turned and followed his eyes and caught a glimpse of another guy with a camera in the upstairs office window, also, for some reason, wearing a mask.Behind him I could see the dark shapes of several others.What the hell was this?Were they filming us?I hesitated, but only for a second.Something was very wrong here.I turned and ran after Gordie and Jimmy in their dash to the exit.Move it!I cried They were probably waiting for some kind of signal, but as soon as they realized someone was onto them, those dark shadows in the office sprang forward, sliding the windows back and aiming their weapons, and a hail of laser fire spat down on us.All around there was that now familiar screaming, the stench of burned flesh, the explosions of light as person after person was cut down.I think the idea was it was supposed to be a complete turkey shoot; that no one would make it out of there alive.There were two uniformed guys just outside the entrance, I guessed to cut anyone down who tried to escape, but we were there sooner than theyd anticipated and I barged one over as he was still setting up, dropping the water containers, trying to grab his weapon but losing it in the dark.His buddy joined in and I found myself having to grapple with both of them.Gordie was repeatedly punching one in the back, Jimmy kicking the other in the leg, and somehow, in all the confusion, we managed to get away.I fell over some boxes but still managed to grab my goddamn water containers before setting off down a service alleyway.Several laser shots were directed at us, scoring the brickwork, starting a fire, but with everything else that was going on, no one bothered to give chase.Jeez, I shouldve knownmaybe I did know, deep down.It was a set up, of course it was.We were too desperate, too hungry, like starving animals lured into a trap.The cameras had obviously been there to record the whole thing and use it for propaganda: Look what happens when you lootand maybe far more importantly, Look whos still in control, even without satellites.I dont like these Infinity people.Not one little bit, I muttered.Looks like theyre the law now, Jimmy said.Mm.And in which case, who the hells government?I turned and looked at him.Good question.We walked on a little further, both of us turning that over, but it wasnt such a dilemma for Gordie.The guys with the biggest sticks are always in control, he told us.I mean, you can dismiss it, you can mount all kinds of arguments based on politics and democracy, but in the end, he wasnt so far wrong.Which was a helluva worrying thought when you related it to our situation.We hadnt been walking more than thirty minutes when the screens cleared of individual advertising and all came up with the same thing: Infinity News.Sure enough, the first items up were the looting, the anarchy on the streets and the way the authorities were dealing with it.Over and over they showed the extermination of those in the supermarket, sparing us nothing: looters being lasered and cut down, getting exactly what they deserved.Bleeding corpses sprawled on the ground, close ups of the most horrific injuries and of the shock and agony of those who suffered them.Mind you, they were careful not to show what kind of store it was, or suggest that people had been trying to take food and not, as one clip led us to believe, luxury items.Not to mention pointing out that some of the dead looters were Detainees, that these people had already committed a Crime Against the State punishable by death.It was pretty fearsome stuff, and if Infinitys aim was to frighten the hell out of faint hearted looters, to convince people how uncompromising they intended to be, I imagine it worked.We mustve walked a mile or more watching the same images being played over and over til it reached a point where I could pretty well tell you what was gonna happen next.Where I knew that that woman was about to be blasted to pieces and her partner would throw himself on top of her a second too late.Where those two people would get melded together with the same shot.And where that young girl died just as she was putting a piece of chocolate into her mouth.It was a bit like being beaten senseless over and over, and even when I told myself to turn away, within seconds I was looking back againwe all were.Finally they mustve felt the point was well and truly made and they moved on to the next itemthough it was connected.At first it was such a shock I really couldnt take it in.Some stretches of street it can be as much as a couple of hundred yards to the next screen, and with the smoke you cant see anything, but as luck would have it, the next story came up just as we were approaching a profusion of screens, big and small.I turned to Jimmy, then back to the screens, then back to Jimmy again, hardly believing my eyes.What the hell are you doing up there?I asked.Into the Fire        FOUR They were images taken from a satellite, looking down on his freckly bald head with his trademark straggle of a ponytail, some with him using his stick, others not, around the Village mostly, though there were a couple out on the tips.It made me wonder if they had photos of us all or if he was picked out laterif theyd been doing a little investigating.Whatve I done?Jimmy protested.We paused by a screen so we could catch what was being said, though I think we both had a pretty good idea.Sure enough, having shown how they deal with lootersthose hell bent on civil unrest, the anarchists on our streetsInfinity were now revealing the person responsible for this situation, the monster who destroyed not just the satellites, but Life, Law and Order, and the very fabric of our society.Viewers were advised that this evil man, this master terrorist with a death sentence on his head must be apprehended, and that a substantial reward was being offered to anyone who had any information as to his identityor, even better, could bring about his demise.I turned to Jimmy.Even in the murky light, I could see all the color draining from his face.Oh, Jeez!he whined.Not cool!Without saying another word, he put his head down and began to peg it away from us as fast as he could.For some reason Gordie found the whole thing highly amusing; he just stood there laughing and pointing after him.Jimmy!I called out.He stopped and turned around and hurriedly retraced his footsteps.Big Guy!he hissed, are you crazy?Dont call out my name like that!I apologizedthen had something of a brainwave.I dug into my backpack and tugged out one of the parkas we took from the camping store.Put it on.He looked at it for a moment as if Id lost my mind, then realized what I was getting at: as long as he kept the hood up, there was every chance hed go unrecognized.Im not scared, he kept saying as he was zipping it up.Just aware Im an irreplaceable part of the team.Nevertheless, all the way back to the church, he kept a real watchful eye out.Withdrawing his head as far back into his hood as he could whenever anyone approached, then extending it out again to check all around once theyd gone.In and out, in and out, like some turtle on speed.When we finally descended the steps into the crypt, the others were so relieved by our return, and what we laid out before them, our meal turned out to be a bit more of an impromptu party.Wed found a couple of wind up emergency lanterns that, at first lit the crypt just fine, but as they began to run down, they created some disturbing shadows that kept little Arturo looking around as if he expected to see a ghost appear at any moment.Gordie, surprisingly generously for him, handed out some of the candy bars hed brought back, not only to Arturo but to Hanna as well; while Delilah started modeling her new parka as if it was an expensive fur, parading up and down, looking about as pleased as she could be.I couldnt help but wonder how long it had been since shed had any new clothes.Or maybe shed never had anything but hand me downs.Jimmyd asked Gordie and me not to say anything about him being on the screen, that it would only cause ructions with Lile.As long as he lay low, itd be fine, and once the fires died down, wed be out of this city and it wouldnt be an issue anyway.For his sake, I hoped he was right, though I gotta say, those Infinity people really worry me.Theyre not like the Wastelords: a disorganized rabble united only by a love of cruelty and violence, they go deep into everyones lives, with a power and position theyre utterly ruthless about enforcing.They might not know Jimmys name, but the fact that they were already broadcasting his image just two days after our escape was a real cause for concern.Lena gave me a big hug when I first got back.I thought it was cuz she was so pleased to see me, but she hung on for so long I realized there might be more to it.The rest of the evening she never once left my side.It wasnt like her at all.I mean, were talking about someone who spent four years alone underground, who had self sufficiency down to an art form.But over here, on the Mainland, she doesnt look so comfortable.I mean, its only natural itd take time to get used to it, but I gotta admit, she was starting to worry me.Later, warmly ensconced in our new sleeping bag, whispering to each other so the others couldnt hear, I asked her if she was okay.Of course, she replied, a little surprised by the question.Why wouldnt I be?For a while I left it at that, not wanting to make matters worse, but in the end I couldnt stop myself.Sure?What do you mean?She waited, as if she wanted me to clarify what I was saying, but she knew what I was talking about.Clancy...she sighed.Im worried about you.Well, dont!Its my problem.So there is a problem?No!she said, turning over, repositioning herself for sleep, getting used to the confines of the sleeping bag.She didnt say any more, but I could tell she was still awake.I gave her a squeeze but she didnt respond.Lena?Eventually she gave a long sigh and turned back over, I guess realizing I was going to keep on til she told me.Im no use here.Not to you, not to anyone.What dya mean?Oh, come on!It was fine on the Island, down in the tunnels, but over here...Im just another mouth to feed, slowing you down, complicating things.Are you serious?Yes!You might not want to admit it, but the truth is...youd be better off without me.Whoa, whoa, I said, tugging her toward me, no longer worried the others might hear.There are no circumstances in this world in which Id be better off without you.None whatsoever.Dyou hear me?...Lena?Yes.Please.Never ever talk about this again.Not for any reason.She gave a long sigh, as if she really wanted to say more.Promise?I persisted.Eventually I felt her nod, but it was a long way from convincing.The two of us opted to pretend the subject was closed and returned to our search for sleep, but I knew the issue was far from resolved: she was still troubled, I just didnt know how deep it went.And you wanna know something?The worst part of it?Its left me with this awful feeling that maybejust maybeI cant trust her anymore.Not cuz Im worried she might do something wrongmore cuz Im worried she might try to do something right.She might think about sacrificing herself for us, slipping away, heading off on her own, under the impression that it would be whats best for everyone.And to be honest with you, try as I might, I cant think of one thing in this world that frightens me more than that.I spent almost the entire night turning things over in my mind, thinking of what I could do or say to put her mind at rest, to convince her she was as valued here as on the Island.Once we got out of this damn city and found ourselves somewhere to live, far away from all this, everything would be so much simpler.Well, maybe thats not doing her situation justice, I mean, no matter how strong she is, its always gonna be a battle shell have to fight.It was just as the daylight was beginning to spill weakly down the stone steps that the idea came to me.At first I kind of played with it, running this way and that, waiting for the jolt when I hit the wall, when I ran up against the obstruction that told me it couldnt be done.But do you know something?I never reached that wall.I couldnt think of any reason at all why I shouldnt at least explore the possibility.I lay there until the day had well and truly arrived, still churning over what I had to do, and eventually came to the conclusion that, as always with my ideas, the best thing was to just go ahead and do it and that there was no time like the present.I managed to untangle myself from Lena, unzip the sleeping bag and make my way across the crypt without waking anyone.Later Id tell them I thought of something else we needed, that we forgot the previous day.Maybe I could pick something up just to support my story?For sure, I wasnt gonna let any of them know what I was really up to.Especially not Lena.I mean, it wasnt gonna be easy, and, actually, I probably wasnt the best guy for the job, schmoozing aint exactly my specialty.On the other hand, if I did succeed, it would change our world.Despite my new green parka, Im aware I dont cut much of a figure these days.I remember when I was working for Mr.Meltoni, I had eleven suits hanging in my wardrobe.Can you believe that?All handmade by a little Moroccan guy down on Union and set off with genuine French or Italian silk ties.Actually, that was Mr.Meltonis idea.He thought his boys should reflect his status, especially his Number One minder, but after a while, I kind of got into it myself.You feel good when youre wearing nice clothes.They move with you, instead of against you.And Ill tell you something else too, a big guy badly dressed is nowhere near as impressive as one done up to the nines.You get more respect, which means you dont have to get your hands dirty so often.Now, of course, apart from the parka, Im just about dressed in rags, which aint that surprising given that there was rarely anything in the Islands garbage big enough to fit me.I knew I needed to smarten up if I was going to get where I wanted to go.Not that I had a great deal in the way of options.All I could think of was trimming my beard with the knife Gordie found, then wetting and combing my hair back with my fingers.There wasnt a lot I could do with my pants, but I did clean my boots and give them a bit of a polish on the lining of my parka.It was better, but not a whole lot.Maybe the most persuasive thing I had going for me was my absolute determination not to let anyone fob me off, but if I thought that was going to intimidate people, I was wrong, cuz whether it took ten seconds or ten minutes, in the end, I was still shown the door.There was one other place to try, and a name that had cropped up several times already that morning.Dr.Evan Simon had his own private clinic but worked two days a week at St.Josephsand fortunately for me, that day was one of them.He was one of the new breed: techno doctors, theyre called, though compared to those we had when I was a kid, I dont reckon theyre doctors at all.There are no medical specialists any morefar as I could see, some of them know little more about the human body than I do.What they do specialize in is programming; its computers do all the work now, diagnose, treat, operate.You dont need the knowledge of years of medical school, just cutting edge data.The really gifted ones are those who create their own programsand apparently, when it came to gifts, Dr.Simon was the man, or even something a little higher.He certainly required you to fall to your knees when he entered the room, far as I could work out.Whatever, all I knew was, if I wanted a miracle, he was the most likely source, so I headed off through the smoke and debris to St.Josephs.I got directions from this young guy at reception who kept looking me up and down as if Id accidentally rolled in dog crap and he didnt know whether to tell me or not.I knew the first thing hed do once I was out of sight would be to warn security, and that meant I had to get to Dr.Simons office as quickly as possible, otherwise I wouldnt get there at all.I just sailed past his clucking secretary, pushing some assistants out of the way, and barged straight in.He was on the screen, talking to someonemaybe his PA at his private clinic?It sounded like he was going over his schedule for the week.I gotta say, one look was enough to know I was in the presence of real twenty four carat gold success.I mightve enjoyed dressing up when I worked for Mr.Meltoni, but this guy oozed his own brand of aftershave: traditional English shirt, country club tie, gold cufflinks, metallic midnight hair with polished silver sides: the very picture of success.What do you want?he asked, immediately looking over my shoulder for someone to come and rescue him.I came right out with it.I need you to look at my partners eyes.Shes blind.I wanna know if theres any chance of her seeing again.He just stared at me as if he couldnt believe my nerve.Have you got an appointment?he asked, plainly not having heard a word I said.Shes been blind for four yearsgot caught in an explosion, I told him, determined to tell him everything before I was thrown out.She cant see a thing, but theres no visible damage.Make an appointment.My secretary will tell you my fees and availability, he told me, again looking to the door.I dont have time for that!I growled, knowing Id never get back in again, that this was my only shot.I need you to see her right away.Im afraid thats impossible, he replied, getting that look about him, that tone, as if hed just realized he was dealing with a madmanone who might have to be pacified.I heard someone enter behind me and saw his look of relief.Security had arrived.Please, I begged, you gotta help her!Two guys grabbed me and one stuck a taser in my back and told me to calm down.They half wrestled, half shoved me toward the door, ignoring my efforts at digging my heels in.Please!Dr.Simon, you have no idea what shes been through.Shes the bravest woman Ive ever knownshe lived all alone for four years in the old subway tunnels on the Island, I cried out, willing him to listen.Can you imagine?Could youve done that?Please, give her a chance!There was a pause and I realized that not only had the security guys stopped pushing me toward the door, but Dr.Simon was actually listening.I know I shouldntve come here like this, but shes everything to me.And she deserves to be helped, more than anyone youll ever meet.Dr.Simon took a deep breath and told the security guys to release me and wait outside.Youve got five minutes, he told me.That was all I needed, a chanceand I tell you, I was as persuasive as Ive ever been, assuring him over and over what a wonderful person she was, that if he met her, hed know what I meant...course, he realized straight off we were Detainees, but that didnt seem to worry himin fact, oddly, it seemed to make Lena that bit more interesting to him.Shes perfectly healthy otherwise?he asked.Yeah, shes fine, I told himand she is; whatever her sight problems, and maybe cuz of her change of circumstances, these days Lena looks so much more healthy.He asked me a lot more questions, mainly about her surviving underground: what she ate, where she got waterbut after a while he started glancing at his watch and I knew my time was up.I had just one more question.How much would it cost?Do you have money?he asked, unable to stop himself looking me up and down.Ill get it, I said, though I didnt have the slightest idea how.Ive been doing research into the growing incidents of blindness in the Cityshe might fit into that program.I could waive my fees but my support staff would have to be paid.Theyre not a charity.Probably somewhere in the region of eight to ten thousand.It was a lot of money, but it had been his fees Id been really worried about.Thanks to Mr.Meltoni, I knew how much these guys charged.Thank you, I said, and I meant it.Thats really kind.He just shrugged as if it was nothing, but I was genuinely moved.A few minutes later, having made an appointment for Lena for the following day, I was in the elevator, smiling to myself, ignoring the lingering doubt that I was getting into something I didnt understand.It was the first real act of kindness Id experienced since we arrived in the City, and I gotta say, it made me feel a little better about the place.However, when I got to the ground floor, I was in for a shock.There was a whole room jam packed with those zombie sick, just like the ones on the beach.In fact, there were so many, people were queuing out into the corridor.I walked by, moving to one side to let a couple of nurses pick a guy up whod collapsed, taking the opportunity to snag several bottles of water thatd just been delivered and stuff them in my backpack.As I got to the door, I glanced back.What the hell was wrong with those people?It was well into the afternoon before I got back, and the amount of sidewalk crunching Id done, I shouldve been exhaustedbut I wasnt.I was too excited at how things had gone, what it might mean, and it was all I could do to keep it inside.The others were sitting around up top, slowly appearing out of the smoke as I approached like a circle of stones.Clancy!Whereve you been?Lena asked, obviously having heard my approach.Sorry.I went looking for more water, I said, taking out the bottles Id liberated from St.Josephs.All I could find...Oh, and I got something for Jimmy.I thought bringing the little guy back a mini screen was a real brainwave, a distraction from my behavior, but he didnt react the way Id expected.In fact, it was Delilah who eventually took it from me.Oh God!she groaned.I thought things had been peaceful.No matter how she might feel about reuniting Jimmy with his precious technology, she still started to look for the power switch.Dont turn it on, he told her.Why not?she asked.There was a pause, then little Arturo started giggling.He doesnt want you to see him.Gordie!I groaned, realizing he mustve told Arturo the whole story.What?Delilah asked.Jimmy knew he had no choice, that he had to tell her.They know it was me who brought down the satellites, he admitted sheepishly.What?she cried.He played it down, like it was nothing, that there was no way they could be sureand anyways, as soon as the fires died down and we got away, what would it matter?But Delilah was a long way from happy, especially when Arturo blurted out there was a price on his head.Jimmy!Public Enemy Number One, he nodded, with just the faintest suspicion of pride.How much is it?she asked.bout time I got something for all these years of aggravation.Nowhere near enough, he told her.Delilah stood there for several moments, glaring at him as if ten cents might be a temptation.Wheres that knife?she asked.He knew what she had in mind immediately.Im not cutting my ponytail offnot for you or anyone!Youll cut that stupid thing off and shave what little other hair you got, she told him.What?Clancy?Delilah implored.I raised one hand in a gesture of submission and used the other to tug Lena downstairs to the crypt.I couldnt go another moment without telling her.Whats the matter?she asked, once we were alone.I hesitated for a moment, suddenly not sure how shed take this.I been to see someone.Who?A techno doctor...Dr.Evan Simon.Just for a moment there was this expression on her face, like a close friend shed fallen out with a long time ago had walked into the room.Why?You know why.Clancy!Im never going to get my sight back Are you sure?What do you mean?I told her the whole story, all the places I went, the way Dr.Simons name kept cropping up, and finally, about barging into his office, and most important of all, that he thought there might be a chance of restoring her sight.But first he has to see youdo some tests.It was like all the rigidity went out of her body.She gave this kind of little whimper as if the subject was just too painful, and slowly slumped down the wall to the floor.I did it for you!I told her, not understanding her reaction.I dont care if youre blindwell, I do, course, but...on your behalf.I want you to be happy.Oh, Clancy, she sighed.I am happy.With you You were happy.On the Island.Yeah.What does that say about me?she replied.Everyone elses life was hell.Again there was silence.She reached out, took my hand and tugged me down next to her.You gotta give it a try, I said.You got to.What about money?she asked.Hes doing some research.He said hell make you part of it, I told her, deciding not to mention the other costs for the moment.She just sat there, gently shaking her head, as if it was all too much.Just see him, Lena, please?If theres nothing doing, well...But if theres any chance...She kissed me on the cheek.Youre the most wonderful man in the world.I know, I joked.Id do anything to be able to see you.I hugged her, kissed her head, burying my lips in that warm profusion of thick brown hair, aware that, actually, that was probably the last thing I wanted to hear her say.All I could do was to try to put it out of my mind, but it wasnt gonna be easy.See, if she does get her sight backand I know thats a big ifbut if she does, what the hells she gonna think when she comes face to face with this big old bag of sad wrinkles and bent bones?The next day, as arranged, I took Lena to Dr.Simons private clinic.He had patients all morning, but hed assured me hed do his best to fit us in at lunchtime.We didnt tell the others, not yet, not with so much hanging on it.Dr.Simons clinic was at his home up in the hills, where the smoke smelled a little more like wood instead of giving off that chemical odor she hated so much.It was one of those swanky enclaves, with security so tight they can read the whole place at any given moment and tell you how many people are in there, where they are, even what theyre doing.When we got to the gate they really gave us the once over: initially cuz of our appearance, I guess, but then cuz they discovered we had no implantswe were nonpeople.They made us wear those bracelets that not only monitor you, but damn near take your hand off if youre caught doing anything you shouldnt, officiously informing the driver Dr.Simon sent down that they werent happy about nonpeople in the compound and it would have to go down in the records.The guy drove us the few hundred yards up to the house without a word, obviously no more relaxed about the situation than security were.He kept glancing in his rearview mirror at us, as if he couldnt wait to get this odd looking couple on his back seat out and give it a damn good clean.Mind you, it was a nice limo: long, shiny as a dinner plate and clearly bullet  and laser proof, just like the ones Mr.Meltoni used to have.As for the house, well, it was every bit as huge and imposing, every bit as stylish, as youd expect from someone like the Doc.Naturally, we werent taken to the front door where we might embarrass one of his wealthy patients but ushered around the back and in through a side entrance, then hurried into his office.The doctor will be with you shortly, the receptionist said, as Lena immediately started to find her way around the room, feeling the large expanses of shiny minimalism, stroking some pretty expensive looking ornaments, checking the acreage of the Impressionist originals.How much did you say this would cost?she asked.Its not a problem, I told her.Just, er...a few thousand for the staff.Clancy!she protested.Nothing for him...I said, hes doing some kind of study.She groaned as if having second, or even third, thoughts.Just see him, I begged.Whatve you got to lose?Its funny: there was this moment when Dr.Simon first entered the room when I felt really uncomfortable, almost like hed forgotten somethingthe quality that made me trust him the previous day.He seemed much more businesslike, and probably cuz it was his private clinic, looked even smarter in a silver gray sharkskin suit with swirly blue silk tie and soft leather slip ons.Clancy.He nodded at me, making no attempt to shake my hand.And this must be Lena?She didnt say anything, which slightly surprised menormally shes pretty friendly.Take a seat, he told us, and Lena immediately headed for the two chairs in front of his desk.Very impressive, Dr.Simon noted.He proceeded to ask Lena an almost endless list of questionsnot only about her blindness, but also every aspect of her background, feeding every detail into his computer.Lena was plainly reluctant to fill in so many blank spaces, particularly when he asked her about her time living with the Wastelords.On more than one occasion she simply refused to answer and he was forced to move on.At last he stopped talking and started to examine her, shining attachments into her eyes, using a scanner over her head to draw across her, over and over, as if taking the thinnest slices of salami.The screen was showing all kinds of colorful imageshot spots, stimulated areas.It meant nothing to me, but the Doc was concentrating as hard as could be.Meanwhile, Lena did whatever he asked without comment or reaction.Her face was a real study of seriousness; I couldnt begin to guess what was going through her mind.Finally he got a nurse to take blood tests and a bunch of different scans, more standard stuff.At last she resumed her seat and the Doc sat across from us scrolling through the initial information.Mm.Interesting, he commented.I turned to Lena, expecting her to ask the obvious question, and when she didnt, I did.In what way?Well, as best as I can make out, it is possible.What are the odds?I asked, wanting to hear it in laymans terms.He made a face like he really didnt want to reduce it to simple terms, but eventually he hit a few keys on his computer as if checking something before saying, Well, my program, her profileits not complete but...Ive got a provisional forecast of eighty two percent success with a corneal graft.It would be greater, but theres always a risk of infection and perhaps even rejection.That doesnt sound good.The computer minimizes it, of course, but in cases like these the possibility of rejection one day never goes away completely.I turned to Lena, again expecting her to make some kind of comment, but still she said nothing.Its up to you, Dr.Simon continued, but...at the very worst, youd be no worse off.How much would it cost?Lena asked, finally joining in on the conversation.Dr.Simon hesitated, looking to me as if he expected me to say something.Well talk about it later, I told Lena, in something of an aside.Clancy, we have no money, she reminded me, obviously irritated by my continued refusal to discuss the subject.And we have no way of getting any.I took her hand and squeezed it.Lets wait and see, huh?She sighed and turned away, and I could see she was as much bemused by my behavior as annoyed by it.Faced by her obvious doubts and degree of antagonism, Dr.Simon visibly softened, even resorted to a little persuasion himself.Well, talk it over, he said.I always program in a degree of cautionit avoids disappointment later.The odds are probably a little better than I said.Wow, I commented, trying to wring a little enthusiasm out of Lena.As for the cost, Ive already told you, Im happy to waive my fee.Maybe some of my technicians, too...its possible.There was a pause, as if he felt hed just delivered his knockout blow and was giving us a chance to appreciate it, then he checked his watch and announced, I must go.Realizing I had no way of receiving a link, he pulled out a drawer and started hunting through until he produced an old appointments card and wrote the details on the back.I can fit you in on the weekend.We said our goodbyes and declined the offer of a lift back to the security gate.Lena was still surprisingly mute, despite him repeating his more optimistic prognosis.Plainly she had her doubts about the guy, and in a way, I could see why.He was certainly smooth, but there was this suspicion that he saw her as nothing more than an intriguing specimen.Clancy?she said, as we neared the gate.What?Its out of the question, you know that, dont you?Why?We dont have any money!she repeated.No matter how little it costs Its not a problem.You wanna run that by me again?We can get money.How?I didnt answer, mainly cuz Id been thinking about it all night and still hadnt come up with anything that resembled a solution.Ill adjust, she told me firmly.Once we find somewhere to settle and I get to know it, Ill be just fine.Why should you have to if you can see again?We made it to the security gate and had our bracelets removed before we were allowed to leave.You heard what he said.Theres a good chance, I persisted, as we walked away.Clancy, she begged, just leave it, huh?But of course, I couldnt, not for long.Later, back at the church, I waited for my moment, then told the others.It wasnt exactly fair: I knew theyd be on my side and start pressuring her.I guess I was just hoping that weight of numbers would eventually tell.Sure enough, they all got stuck into her, telling her that even if there was only a one percent chance, she should grab it.We dont have the money!she cried, yet again.Well get some!Delilah reassured her.How?Delilah looked at Jimmy and the little guy at me.Instantly I cut Gordie and Arturo off before they could start talking about robbing a bank again.That whole interchange mustve occurred a dozen times in various different versions, but it always died at the same pointwith no one having the slightest idea how we could get our hands on any money, let alone something approaching ten grand.Tell the truth, I didnt know what to do.The one person youd think would be most enthusiastic about the idea, who had everything to gain, was the one dead set against it.Several times she reassured me she was perfectly happy the way she was, that it was just her new surroundings making her insecure.In fact, she was so persuasive, I almost got to believing her.It was only later, waking up and finding her crying beside me, that I realized how she really felt.She hadnt been showing any enthusiasm cuz she couldnt bear to get her hopes up and be disappointed.We had no moneyand even if we did manage to get some, the operation wasnt guaranteed.It was easier for her to cope with what she had, to go on as she was.I pulled her toward me and kissed away those tears, tasting their salty sadness on my lips.Id gone over and over this a million times and I could think of only one way of coming up with the money.It was madnessin fact, it was damn near laughablebut it was all I had.I was gonna have to come out of retirement and find myself one last job.Into the Fire        FIVE The following morning I was awakened by this commotion up top, a lot of screaming and whooping.I struggled out of the sleeping bag and went up to investigate.I was immediately confronted by the apartment block across the street burning away like a billboard for Hades.Flames were leaping into the air so high they disappeared into the smoke, feeding into the general haze; occasionally exploding out in bright orange unfurling ribbons.Jimmy and the kids were already up there; Gordie, Arturo and even Hanna were letting out squeals of delight every time there was a new eruption, as if they were watching a fireworks display or something, while Jimmy just looked on, a puzzled frown on his face.That aint normal, he told me, his old eyes bloodshot from the smoke.So you keep saying, I commented absently, my thoughts still locked on finding a job and getting some money.Something causes that.I nodded, watching as a tongue of flame suddenly shot in our direction, invading the churchyard.He was right: it wasnt normal.Then again, what was, these days?Listen, Jimmy, I muttered, making sure the kids couldnt hear, I gotta go somewhere.Well, dont look at me, he said, mindful of the fact that Infinity had put a price on his head.No, I mean, alone.He stared at me, only then appreciating just how worried I was.Where?It dont matter, I replied, glancing behind me, checking Lena hadnt followed me up, but...listen, you know, if for any reason I dont come back...take care of Lena, wont you?Whoa!Big Guy!he said.No, no, its nothing, I told him, pulling him a little further away.Its just in case.Where you going?I paused for a moment, then sighed.Places I havent been in a long, long time.Where?he persisted, but I refused to tell him.I dont like this, Big Guy.Not cool.Not cool at all.Jimmy, I groaned, getting a little impatient.Okay, okay Just look out for her...Itll be fine.I gave a bit of a sigh, wanting to change the subject, to make out it really wasnt that serious.You looked at that screen?Youre kidding, right?he asked.Why not?Jimmy shook his head in that infuriating way he has when he thinks the answer should be obvious even to a preoccupied two year old.The reason I didnt want Lile to turn it on was nothing to do with me, he said, pausing to emphasize my ignorance.You know why they dont know who I am?That even with a photo they still cant identify me?I shrugged, wishing hed just say it instead of going through the usual humiliating exercise of trying to wring it out of me.Its cuz were nonpeople.You seen what happens when we pass a screen or get on the moving sidewalk...nada!We dropped off the database long ago.No one ever dreamed Islanders would ever come back.For all intents and purposes we no longer exist.Its our one great advantage, and the last thing we should do is give them any kind of informationif we turn on something stolen, it might put a search program in operation.So, no cells, no GPS, no pacemaker or implants, nothing that would help them identify us.So the screens no good?He shrugged.If I can get hold of a couple of things, make some modifications, then maybe.Just at that moment, Lena came up the steps.At first she looked a little put out that I hadnt returned to her and our sleeping bag, but as soon as she smelled the smoke and felt the heat of the fire opposite, she forgot all about it.Thats close.Yeah, and big, I agreed.I might take a look around the back.See whats behind all those brambles.Maybe well need another way out of here.Shouldve done it beforein case of unexpected visitors.Good idea, she said, sounding like she was planning on coming with me.Only trouble is, those damn things are gonna rip me to pieces, I told her, making it sound as if it would be impossible for me to get through, let alone someone who couldnt see.Actually, it was the perfect alibi.I could explore out back where the undergrowth was thickest and hopefully find somewhere to hop over the wall.Later, when I returnedpresuming nothing had prevented meId just say it had taken me longer than I thought, that Id gone on to check out the immediate area.As it turned out, my comment that the brambles might rip me to pieces wasnt that far off the truth.Several times I thought Id found a way through, only to come up against a massed army of razor sharp needles.My new parka got ripped up good and proper before I finally managed to reach this empty space up against the wall, Natures no mans land, all brown and quiet, where the sun wasnt able to reach.The only problem was, the wall out back was considerably higher than the ones at the front and sides of the churchyard.I worked my way along it, looking for somewhere to get over, and was almost on the point of giving up when, right down in the far corner, I came across this tree that had fallen across it, creating a fairly precarious bridge.Twenty years ago I wouldve been up and over there in a matter of seconds; now it was more like negotiating the tricky side of Everest.Nevertheless, I finally managed to make it to the top and found myself looking into an abandoned builders yardor maybe even something a bit more specialized, like a stonemasons.I slid awkwardly down the other side, trying to make my landing as gentle as possible, but still collided with the ground with a real thump.I picked myself up, made sure nothing was broken, and soldiered on into the acrid gloom.I really didnt know that city anymore.It wasnt so much that it had changedthough, of course, it hadmore that we didnt recognize each other.Okay, so the last time I saw it, it wasnt enveloped in smoke, there werent fires everywhere, all this chaos and destruction, but it wasnt just that.Its like when you bump into an old friend you havent seen for a long time and now you cant remember what you were to each other, how your relationship used to work.And the further I went in the direction of the old neighborhood, the more familiar the surroundings became, the less comfortable I felt.Mind you, bearing in mind what I was planning on doing, I guess that wasnt so surprising.If it hadnt been so desperate, it wouldve been funnyme, nigh on a senior citizen, hoping to get back into the muscle business.I guess I did work out on the Island a little, and yeah, no matter what, Im still a big guybut unless someone was planning on putting the frighteners on the residents of the local old folks home, it was hard to see what job Id get.Not that that was my only concern about being back in the old neighborhood.Im a pretty peaceful guy these days, but working in the business I did, youre gonna make yourself enemiesyoure bound to, once youve sworn loyalty to one particular gang.I could think of several people over there I wouldnt want to run into.Mind you, it was a long time ago, and I could only hope that most of them had moved onin one way or another.Or maybe, like me, theyd got a bit more forgiving in their old age.Id been going over and over it: the people I could look up, those who might help, and I gotta say, it was one helluva short list.There were a couple of guys I reckon wouldve been there for me, but they had to be dead, or near as damn it.In fact, the more I thought about it, the more I realized my only real chance was the First Original Sushi Bar.Bankers probably have a favorite bar where they collect, cabbies a caf, but anyone involved in crime in this city, certainly when I was living here, ended up in the First Original.It was partly the food, partly the location, but mostly, I think, the owner.Yoshi was the perfect guy for that sort of operation: welcoming, agreeable, kept his ears open and his mouth shut and occasionally even acted as broker, putting client and criminal togetherusually the younger ones, those who hadnt found a gang yet, out to make a name for themselves, or even the occasional freelancer who, for one reason or another, liked to work alone.Cant tell you how relieved I was to see it still there, a little older, in need of a lick of paint, but as I drew closer, I could see the usual gang of young hopefuls hanging around inside.There were a lot more women than there used to be, which, as an old fashioned guy, I didnt feel entirely comfortable about, but I guess thats just the way it is now.I entered hesitantly.Even in a place like that, where no one stares at anyone, a lot of people were staring at me.I hoped it was only out of curiosity and not remembering some age old grudge, but after taking a quick look around, I realized it was unlikely anyone there would have a problem with methere wasnt a soul within thirty years of my age.I heard a couple of comments about my appearance and smell but just kept my head low and made for the bar, which meant Yoshi was able to sneak up on me.How are you, sir?he cried, suddenly standing in front of me with that big beaming smile of his.How are you?Hed gone a bit gray and put on a lot of weight, but he was still wearing those crazy game glasses he liked so much, and I gotta say, I was really pleased to see him.You remember me?I asked, with some surprise.Of course!he said, beckoning me over to a stool at the bar.I sat, feeling cripplingly uncomfortable as people looked over as if a mangy stray had just been offered a bowl of something expensive.Apart from the clientele, nothing much had changed; like the outside itd just got a little older and less shiny.The same conveyor belt was clicking and clacking its way around, tempting the customers, but its progress was a lot jerkier now, at times threatening to throw the food onto the floor.You escape from the Island, sir?Yoshi asked, going behind the bar and standing in front of me.I took my time answeringI mean, he used to be a good guy, but who knew how this place worked now.Yeah, I eventually replied.We all did.Almost as if he thought I deserved it, he immediately gave me a couple of plates off the belt, amazingly, after all that time, still remembering my rather conservative taste: a slice of fresh salmon on plain rice, a little soy and hold the wasabi.I dont have any money, Yoshi, I told him.Next time, he said, again with a beaming smile.I devoured what he gave me almost before his hand had retreated to the far side of the counter.Bearing in mind what Id been eating, especially over on the Island, a couple of plates of sushi was a helluva luxury.Wow, I said, my mouth exploding with delight.Good, huh?You said it...Actually, Yoshi, I went on, thinking I might as well get this over with, moneys why Im here.I badly need some.Like really badly.To my surprise, he didnt look shocked, nor did he burst into laughter, but that might have had something to do with him coming from a culture thats always been well versed in hiding emotions.Ten grand, I continued.Not a lot of money these days, he commented.It is to me, more than you can ever imagine.He stared into my face.I think he realized just how desperate I was, but it never seemed to cross his mind to ask why.What do you want to do?No killing.He nodded his head.Let me think, he said, taking a few dirty glasses off the bar and stacking them ready to be washed.A few moments later, two guys in suits sauntered in with something sinister woven into their pinstripes.At the far end of the bar there was a stampede to vacate what were obviously their usual stools.They were so young there was no fear of them knowing who I was, but I have to admit, I felt that bit intimidated myself.The bigger guyAfro Caribbean, a diamond stud in his earran his eyes around the room, going from one face to the next, stopping when he got to me.Whats wrong with him?I muttered to Yoshi.Oh, youre new, he whispered out of the corner of his mouth.Nothing to worry about.He immediately went off to greet the two men, to give them the big hello: shaking their hands, pouring complimentary drinks, while I just quietly sat checking out those around me.With their sharp clothes and cool haircuts they couldnt have contrasted more with my reflection in the mirror on the far side of the room if theyd wanted to.Despite my efforts at tidying myself up when I went to find a doc for Lena, I still looked like a wild man.
