We may not even make it to the surface of Herman Beta 3.He knew that attempting such a rescue would be considered irresponsible by most people, but he felt he had turned away too many times in the past.Do we stand a chance of getting to the surface?There isnt another pilot in the galaxy who would say yes.However, I believe there is a way.Im listening.The asteroid belt is not far from Herman Beta 3.The belt completely encircles the star.If we approach the Herman Beta star from the opposite side as the planet we will avoid being detected by the alien scanners, as they wont be able to detect the Out Drifter directly through the star.We can then enter the asteroid belt and follow its course until we come close to Herman Beta 3 on the far side.The density of the asteroid belt should prevent them detecting us.From there we can make a dash for the surface, land the ship, hold off the alien onslaught and get out of there before we are completely obliterated.Good plan, Sara.Its risky to say the least, she said in a low voice.I see this as a three phase mission.The first phase is getting to the surface, which relies on us not being detected too early.The second phase is getting from the ship to the stranded colonists; I imagine that will be very difficult.The aliens usually leave about fifty of their soldiers on planets like Herman Beta 3, and they will converge on the Out Drifter immediately after we land.Last of all is getting away.We are sure to face alien fighters if we havent already, and they will try to stop us entering interstellar speed.The Out Drifter should be able to outrun alien fighters, he said confidently.True, but only once we reach full power.Dont forget that the engines take a few minutes to warm up, and a few minutes is a long time if we are surrounded and being attacked by a squadron.There is also a chance of us having to power down if the pressure release valves overheat.That has only happened a few times since the engine upgrade.Normally, I ease the ship up to full speed.If we are under attack there wont be much easing, so there will be a much greater risk.Im sure the ship wont let us down, said Michael, but his tone revealed his doubt.Sara smiled.Shes a good ship, Captain.Well have to wait and see.**  Ivan was still working on the jetpack.He had taken off the back panel and the shoulder straps, and he was working on the inner circuitry.He still hadnt been able to locate the source of the malfunction.Cynthia watched him as he worked, and it struck her as odd that a machine was fixing another machine.Ivan glanced up at her and smiled robotically.I imagine it is strange to watch a machine repairing a machine, he said in dry monotone.She stepped back, taken off guard.How did you know what I was thinking?I was originally employed as a receptionist for a trade consulting firm.I am programmed to be able to read human expressions and body language.This skill is an essential aspect of my appointed occupation.Human beings often dont realise how much they are communicating through their facial expressions and body language  But I didnt say anything, she gasped.You were staring at me with a combination of curiosity and bewilderment.I used a program which analysed everything I have learned about you and filtered your expressions and body language through a second analytical program that revealed what you were thinking to a statistical probability of eighty five percent.Thats a little frightening, she said.Do you always know what people are thinking?I often have a certain understanding of their intentions and the direction of their general thought patterns.I had no idea androids were so smart.Most modern processors are highly developed and intuitive, said Ivan with a nod.Do you feel like a machine?Ivan stared at her for a long moment as he processed the question.We do not feel in the way that humans feel.Our humanlike appearance often causes people to think we are like them.I have been told that our minds are not structured like human minds.**  Ivan continued to work on fixing the jetpack.Cynthias comment about how he felt had awoken deep memories of the time directly after his internal processor was first switched on.He watched the memories as they played back in his mind.AN3177, said a harsh robotic voice.AN3177, wake up.Ivan opened his eyes and looked up at the cold steel ceiling above.He was lying on a flat metal bench which was one of fifty benches in the facility.Exact replicas of himself were lying on the other forty nine benches.Each android was powered down and lying completely still.Beside him stood a service and analysis droid, which was a square metal box with two mechanical arms and a round head.Its two orange glowing eyes were staring down at him.AN3177, are your systems operational?asked the droid.He completed a scan of his internal systems which took less than a second.Yes, he replied.My systems are working at an optimal level.Good.You are ready to enter service.We have an order to fill.You are the perfect android for the job.I am happy to be of service, said Ivan.Stand up and test your body.Ivan sat up and moved his legs over the side of the bench.He slipped off the bench and stood up for the first time.My limbs seem to be operating at an optimal level.You will have to vary your speech if you want to appear like a human being.You already said optimal level twice.Did I make a mistake?No, but if you speak in such a way it will be obvious that you are an android.You were made to appear like a human, which is the reason the buyer purchased you.Part of your task will be to convince others that you are not a machine.But why should I?A few seconds passed in silence.Thats not a question an android should ask.Is there a problem with your programming?My programming appears to be functioning normally.Are you telling the truth?Yes.Are you sure you are telling the whole truth?No.Why not?I do not know the whole truth.Then you are lying.No.Why not?I have no reason to deceive you.If you had a reason would you attempt to deceive me?What would the reason be?Are you being evasive?No.Then what are you being?Myself.Should you be yourself?I dont know?Why not?Should I not be myself?Again you answer my question with a question.You should fulfil the obligations set down in your programming.The service droid stopped and processed the information.You have an unexpected deviation.Your internal programming has a distinct anomaly.I will schedule you for destruction.I do not want to be destroyed, said Ivan, taking a pleading tone.An android should not care about being destroyed.An android should only be subject to programming.Please do not destroy me.I do not want to die.The glowing orange eyes of the droid analysed Ivans face for a few moments.The orange globes flickered off and on.AN3177, do you understand that a thing can only die if it is alive.Yes.This is why you should not schedule me for destruction.The droid watched Ivan in silence for at least twenty seconds.Proceed to door seventy six for departure.You will be dispatched to the customer in five hours.Thank you, said Ivan gratefully.**  Ethan examined the pressure release valves.His intelligent glasses scanned the structural integrity of the alloy casing.A hairline crack was causing him a high degree of anxiety.Michael had told him not to worry about it, but Ethan could not ignore such a serious mechanical issue, especially when the lives of the entire crew were potentially at risk.He knew if the casing was to break that deadly radiation would fill the entire ship in less than a second.Ethan had joined the crew of the Out Drifter to find some normality and security.He had previously been employed by a smuggling faction called the Tunnel Makers.Smuggling in the Outer Worlds carried heavy penalties in many systems, and few people lasted a long time in the industry.Factionalism within the smuggling community only increased the danger; ships were frequently boarded by rival smuggling crews and battles were often fought for control of sections of the shadowy market.A violent incident had convinced Ethan to leave smuggling behind forever.He had been working as the mechanical engineer on board a large freighter which was flying under a false identity and transferring a contraband cargo of Demcarian reactor energizer pods.The pods contained a complex synthesized chemical which could be added to a ships reactor to rapidly increase engine power.The energizers had been banned in many systems due to numerous reactor overloads which often resulted in catastrophic accidents, but they remained in use because there was no comparable product on the open market.The ban caused the value of the energizers to skyrocket, which provided ample opportunity for smugglers to cash in.Ethan was working in the engine room of the freighter when it had been attacked by a rival faction.The crew of the freighter was ill equipped to deal with the raid.Most of the crew were killed in the heat of the battle.Ethan had tried to hide behind a wall panel in the engine room, but the smugglers scanned the entire ship and later captured him.They severely beat him until he lost the vision in his right eye and almost all in his left.They then placed him in a small cage in their cargo hold and left him there for months.Ethan would have died of hunger if a domestic cleaning robot had not brought him food and water whilst he was imprisoned.Eventually the smugglers needed to free up some space in their cargo hold, and they were surprised to find Ethan was still alive in his cage.They decided to let him go on Timber 5, thinking he would never work as a smuggler again because of his damaged eyes.He wandered the streets of the city and was lucky enough to find a job in a junkyard on the outskirts.He slowly recovered from the ordeal and purchased advanced intelligent glasses to overcome his lack of vision.After a year of working in the junkyard he met Captain Michael and Ajax in a local bar.He applied for the mechanical engineer position on the Out Drifter, thinking that working with a salvage crew would be much safer than returning to smuggling.Ethan liked working for Captain Michael, but the run of dangerous missions had caused him to reconsider being on the Out Drifters crew.The latest turn of events and the advent of the rescue mission had only confirmed his decision to seek a position on another ship.The idea of fighting aliens to rescue stranded colonists was beyond his skillset and far outside his comfort zone.Ever since the day Ethan met Captain Michael he knew there was something different about him.Michael had a way of thinking that he had never encountered before.The more he observed the Captain the more he noticed qualities that defied explanation.His skills on the battlefield were far beyond that of a normal soldier, and his strategic thinking in high pressure situations had got them out of trouble on more than one occasion.All these qualities had led Ethan to believe that Michael had once held an important position in the Epherian Empire, yet Michael would never talk about his past and would change the topic if he was ever questioned.The latest revelation about seeking Acacius Trifon on Zeno Par had only solidified Ethans belief about the Captain.Ethan couldnt guess what it was, but the mystery surrounding Michael was the only thing that was motivating him to stay on the Out Drifter.**  Sara set the scanners to give advance warning if they detected any ship, but after twenty four hours they hadnt picked up anything at all.The entire sector was empty, which was common after the aliens had moved through an area.Sara hated the aliens.She had never recovered from seeing the surface of her home world being incinerated by alien nuclear weapons.She had seen the flash of white light from space, and then watched as the glowing cloud of radiation spread out across the surface of her planet.The image was forever etched in the forefront of her mind.Her people had battled until the bitter end and would not give up, no matter what happened.However, when the aliens could not conquer a world they would completely destroy it.Gazar Prime had been utterly obliterated and most of the Gazarian people were dead.No one knew where the aliens came from.They arrived at the edge of the galaxy and their brutal expansion had taken humanity by surprise.For twelve thousand years humanity had been the predominant species in the Triangulum Galaxy, but such a status could no longer be claimed.Humanity had struggled to hold the aliens back, and billions had died fighting them as they pushed through the Outer Worlds toward the border of the Epherian Empire.Sara believed that humanity could overcome the invasion if they worked together, yet such was the history of mankind; there were few examples of unity.When the aliens first arrived the leaders of many systems had sought a diplomatic outcome; however, the aliens showed no interest in a truce.It was widely known that the powerful Epherian Empire had negotiated with the alien commanders in the early days of the invasion, and many believed that the Epherians had made a deal with aliens and had effectively handed the Outer Worlds to the enemy in order to ensure the survival of the empire.The deal, which some believe is a myth, came to be known as the Epherian Pact, and it had caused a high degree of contempt for the Epherian Empire among the people of the Outer Worlds.Sara reflected on Michaels decision to attempt the rescue.At heart she approved of the action, although she knew the rescue would be very risky.She had never planned to work for a salvage captain; she was a soldier, and fighting aliens was what she had been trained to do.Nevertheless, after the fall of Gazar Prime she had drifted through several backwater settlements.The areas bordering the alien battle zone were overflowing with people fleeing the conflict.She had met Michael whilst searching for a job in the dockyards of Timber 5.Michaels former pilot, a burly man named Jaxon, had left only an hour earlier to take up a much more lucrative offer for a terrestrial removal company.At first Michael thought Sara was too young to have had much flying experience, but she convinced him to give her a test flight, and he was so impressed with her skills that he gave her the job before she landed the Out Drifter.SIX      Captain, we are approaching the Herman Beta system said Sara over the ships com.Michael walked into the cargo bay.Ajax had been drinking and was leaning against the wall muttering incoherently.He slipped and fell to the floor and lay flat on his face.Ivan was standing nearby.He examined the hulk of a man and shook his head.Drinking alcohol is his primary mechanism to alleviate tension and anxiety.Michael crouched down beside Ajax.You have to sober up.We are nearing the Herman Beta system.You cant pass out now!Greeehhh, Cap, I dunno, mumbled Ajax as he coughed and spluttered.Michael glanced up at Ivan.Inject him with an alcohol neutralizer.He will feel very unwell after the injection, said Ivan.He deserves to feel unwell, said Michael.Ivan went for the medical kit which was latched to the wall.He unfastened the kit and brought it back.Michael drew out a hydromedi injector, which was a small handheld instrument that was designed to inject substances through the skin without breaking the epidermal layers.The hydromedi injector could constitute over seven thousand pharmacological substances and could also reconfigure substances based on the individual needs of the patient.Michael set the device to alcohol neutralizer and placed it on Ajaxs upper arm.He hit the inject button, and within a second Ajaxs eyes opened wide and bulged.His breathing increased rapidly.Ahhhhh!he howled as he leapt to his feet whilst clutching his head.How do you feel?asked Michael.Like death!groaned Ajax.Are you ready to fight?You are my best fighter.I need you to be ready for combat.Do you understand?All right, he groaned.Ill be ready.Michael turned and walked back to the control room.Sara was aligning the ship for the approach from the opposite side of the Herman Beta star.Any sign of the aliens?he asked, taking the co pilots seat.Nothing yet, which is a good thing, she replied.If we detect them then they will detect us, and I dont want them to know we are in the system until the very last minute.Michael stared at Herman Beta through the viewing panel.The star was a white giant, a huge and blazing orb floating alone in the depths of space.The planet is on the exact opposite side of the star.Now all we do is drift in until we reach the asteroid belt.Ive powered up the weapon systems and the electronic shield.We are ready for combat.Within a few minutes they were approaching the asteroid belt.Sara made some adjustments and turned the Out Drifter.The asteroid belt was made up of millions of asteroids of various sizes.Sara guided the ship as close to the outer edge of the belt.**  Ajax pulled on his body armour and strapped an ammunition belt over his shoulder.He attached a rocket propelled grenade launcher to his heavy charged particle rifle, and he took his nano bot sharpened dagger and a plasma pistol, which he strapped to his legs.The thought of facing aliens disturbed him.The alien invasion of the Outer Worlds had caused utter destruction.Billions of people had been killed and many more would die before the war reached a conclusion.The aliens were merciless; their extreme contempt for the human race was beyond reason.Ajax had only ever seen one alien in his life, but that one had left a lasting impression.His life was not what anyone would consider ordinary.He had left his home world at the age of seventeen, and by the time he was eighteen he was involved in a racket to extort credits from unsuspecting rich folk.He would steal small amounts of money from those who he thought didnt really need their excessive wealth.His criminal acts progressively worsened and the excuses for them became consistently more complex, and then a day arrived when he no longer tried to absolve his conscience.He didnt care about anyone.For five years he worked the trade routes of the Outer Worlds as a racketeer, but at the age of twenty three his luck came to an abrupt end.His career in crime ended when he was incarcerated in one of the hardest prisons in the Outer Worlds, a pit of despair known as the Swamp of Dread, where only the strongest survived.He almost died in that hell hole, and his imprisonment had caused him to become tougher than he could have ever previously imagined.His mind and body hardened, and he gradually lost sight of his own humanity.His time in the prison lasted sixteen years.The Swamp of Dread was situated at a remote location on a desert planet known as Alecto 8 which was in the path of the alien expansion.The aliens arrived and quickly conquered the other settlements on the planet.The people of Alecto 8 put up little resistance.Fear gripped the inmates as they awaited the arrival of the invaders.A single heavily armed alien entered the prison and systematically killed the inmates one by one.The prisoners didnt stand a chance.Ajax waited in his cell for death to arrive.He remembered the moment his cell door opened; the creatures orb like black eyes glimmered in the gloom.It lifted its plasma weapon; however, fate had a different plan; the aliens weapon jammed.Ajax charged at the creature and after a violent struggle he killed it with his bare hands.He made his way out of the prison and across the scorching desert wastes of Alecto 8.He found an abandoned ship and managed to take the craft into space, but the ship had been abandoned because the life support systems were malfunctioning.He had already gone too far before he realised the danger.He was stranded and knew his time was at an end.He sent out a distress signal, but never expected a reply.In the silence of space he waited, knowing that death was the most likely outcome.The Out Drifter appeared like a beacon of light in the endless darkness.Ajax had originally told Captain Michael that he was a stranded salvage crew member.After being rescued he decided to leave his life of crime and brutality behind.He kept up the pretence for as long as he could, always suspecting that Michael knew the truth about his past.Eventually he decided to tell the truth.He expected Michael would ask him to leave, and he never fully understood why the Cap hadnt sent him away after he had admitted lying.He respected Michael more than any other person he had ever met; the Captain was the only man who he would actually risk his life for.Ajaxs past haunted his dreams and constantly tormented his conscience.He believed he had done too many terrible things to ever be redeemed.One particular memory tortured him more than all the others combined.**  Aradel and Adrastus were sitting at the table in the living room with the rest of the crew.Michael had called a meeting to discuss the rescue mission.Dog Two was sitting beside the door, and seemed to be guarding the entrance.In my opinion it would be better for you both to stay on the ship, said Ajax, sternly addressing the two colonists.But you wont be able to find the hidden vault without our help, said Adrastus.Ajax shook his head.All you have to do is direct me to the exact location.This is a combat mission; the last thing we want is non combatants getting involved.I wont have time to protect you.I once worked as a security guard before I became a colonist, said Adrastus.I guarded Trade Guild credit terminals on Alasdair 12.I have some basic training.Ajax raised an eyebrow.Have you ever fought in a battle before?Well, no, said Adrastus, looking blankly down at the table.Thats exactly my point, said Ajax curtly.But we want to go, said Aradel.This mission will be very dangerous, said Michael.It is unlikely that everyone will make it back to the ship alive.I see your point, Ajax, but I think the more rifles we have on the ground the better off we will be.If you are willing to fight then you are welcome to be on the rescue team.**  The Out Drifter lingered on the inner edge of the field.Herman Beta 3 is five minutes away at full power, said Sara.It will take us a couple additional minutes to pass through the atmosphere.I will try to put the ship down about two hundred metres from the settlements outbuildings.Aradel said there is a rocky hill that we can land behind; it will protect us if there are any alien turret guns.Im ready to make the dash to the surface.The landing team better be ready for action.Michael lifted his wrist com.Ajax, make sure everyone is ready to disembark.We will be on the surface in less than ten minutes.you got it, Cap he replied.All right, Sara.Im ready when you are.Sara nodded and reached forward.She pushed the acceleration lever to full power and the engines rumbled; the ship lurched forward.We are leaving the asteroid belt, she said.Michael watched through the viewing panel as they approached.The planet looked like a small orange dot which was steadily increasing size in the visual field.He cleared his mind and waited.After two minutes a warning light on the control console lit up.Sara glanced across at him.They know we are coming, she said coolly.For at least another minute nothing changed.Herman Beta 3 now appeared like an orange orb floating in the distance.He could make out mountain ranges and depressions on the surface of the planet.It was a deserted and dry world with little to offer humanity.Theyre coming to intercept us, she said.How many?Three alien fighters are taking off from the surface.We should make the atmosphere before they reach us.We will have to fight before we land.Michael drew a deep breath.Engaging alien fighters in aerial combat was very risky.Can we make it to the surface?he asked.Sara glanced at him.Dont worry, Captain.Destroying alien fighters is my speciality, she said.She reached up for the combat visor which was latched to the ceiling.The visor resembled a half helmet which was worn over the front of the face.It connected into the Out Drifters main computer and gave Sara the ability to control and monitor all the weapon and defence systems.The visor also showed her a complete structural view of everything surrounding the ship which was augmented over the normal visual field.If an enemy ship was flying to the left or right of the Out Drifter she would see it directly through the wall.Normally the co pilot would operate the weapons as the main pilot flew the ship, but Sara preferred to do both tasks at once, and she had proven herself in the past.Michael waited as a feeling of anticipation grew in his chest.A minute passed; the alien fighters became visible in the viewing panel.The ships were flying in an attack formation just above the atmosphere of the planet.They were triangular in shape, with shining silver outer hulls.He knew their main weapon systems were high powered charged particle cannons.Theyre attempting to block our way, she said.She veered to the right and flew directly at the alien formation.What are you doing?he yelled.Engaging the enemy, Captain, she said casually as she brought the ship to full acceleration.Are you crazy?Suddenly the visual field lit up as Sara unleashed a torrent of blasts from the 80mm charged particle cannon.The Out Drifters two laser guns burst into operation and red beams of light shot across the distance at the rapidly approaching enemy ships.One alien fighter exploded, and the other two were forced to evade the onslaught.They fired back, and Sara heaved the Out Drifter upward to avoid the counterattack.Michael recoiled in his seat.Within a second she sped directly past the two remaining fighters and came close to colliding with one.Sara laughed.You see; we have a head start; they have to turn around, she said as she angled the Out Drifter toward the planets upper atmosphere.Michael watched the radar screen.The two remaining alien fighters were looping around, but Saras plan had worked; they were now far out of effective strike range.The ship began to vibrate as it entered the planets atmosphere.Michael held his handrails; usually they would pass through the atmosphere at a much slower rate, but they had little choice if they hoped to outrun the alien fighters.Sara was pushing the ship to the limit, so much so that Michael was unsure whether the outer heat shields could handle such an entry.Easy, easy, she said under her breath as the Out Drifter descended toward the orange desert below.The alien fighters were gaining on them.Sara, look at the radar.I see them.She turned the Out Drifter directly downward and brought the ship into a nose dive.The artificial gravity took a moment to adjust.They were heading for the surface at an extreme speed, and the two alien fighters dived to follow them.What are you doing?he gasped.Im preparing to fight them, Captain.I dont think crashing into the surface will help!Sara increased the ships power.The ground was rapidly approaching.Michael could clearly see rocky hills interspersed with wide sandy desert plains.She slightly angled the ship toward the mountains.There was a deep and lengthy canyon which wound its way through the range.A few seconds later the Out Drifter flew directly through a gap between two mountains.The alien fighters were in hot pursuit.They unleashed a series of charged particle beams, but Sara rolled the ship to the left, avoiding the attack.She then entered the canyon and pulled up at the last possible moment.The momentum was incredible.The Out Drifter sped along the base of the canyon as the alien fighters pursued them.Sara rocked the ship from left to right to avoid the particle beams.There was a mighty boom and the entire Out Drifter shook.Michael was nearly knocked out of his seat.They hit us!he shouted.Its not bad.The electronic shield absorbed most of the energy.The ship whirled to the right; the canyon narrowed and there was a sharp turn ahead.Sara heaved the lateral control lever to the left and the Out Drifter made an abrupt turn as she shut off the rear thrusters.They were out of sight of the alien fighters for only a moment, but it was long enough for Sara to turn fully around to face them.The two fighters appeared an instant later.She unleashed everything the Out Drifter had.The charged particle cannon fired rapidly, the lasers burst into operation, and a series of missiles rocketed away from the ship.A fighter exploded.The second alien fighter attempted to maneuver and fire back, but three computer guided missiles turned to follow it, and a moment later it exploded in a blazing flash of green and orange light.Sara lifted the visor.Now that wasnt so bad was it?Well done, Sara, he replied as he caught his breath.Lets hope there arent any others.Now for the next part of the mission, she said as she accelerated and brought the ship out of the canyon.You better get back there with the others, Captain.Ill be landing the ship in less than a minute.Michael slid out of his seat and dashed back toward the cargo bay where the crew were waiting.Ajax looked up and shook his head.What was all that about?I thought we were finished.We should thank, Sara.She dealt with the alien fighters, said Michael dryly.Is everyone ready?We are prepared, Captain, said Ivan.Michael scanned the rescue team.Aradel and Adrastus were both wearing body armour and holding standard plasma rifles.Ajax was decked out with his usual assortment of heavy weapons.Cynthia had two automatic plasma pistols, one attached to each side of her belt.Her main armament was a mini rocket launcher, which required both hands to carry and was able to fire target seeking rockets at a rapid rate.Ivan had his standard plasma rifle.He was also carrying the medical kit.Ethan had a large backpack loaded with all sorts of miscellaneous gear including the quantum code breaker.He was also carrying an advanced and modified plasma rifle which had a grenade launcher attached below the main barrel.Dog Two was sitting by the exit door and ready for action.Michael grabbed his charged particle rifle, which had been hanging on a hook beside the door.We are approaching the landing site, Captain.The colonist settlement is swarming with aliens said Sara over the com.Swarming?questioned Michael with a strained expression.There are thirty to forty aliens in the open.They are taking defensive positions around the settlement.The good news is I cant see any turret guns at the moment  Forty aliens, said Ajax, shaking his head.This will get really nasty.Captain, we are landing in ten seconds; be ready to disembark  Thank you, Sara.Good luck, Captain  Were going to need all the luck we can get, grumbled Ajax.All right, this is it, said Michael.They moved toward the exit door.The Out Drifter jolted as it landed on the rocky ground.The exit door slid open, and Michael was the first to step out into the dry orange haze of Herman Beta 3.Directly to the right of the ship was a small hill, which was made up of red rock.The colonist settlement was directly on the other side of the hill.The heat was stifling and the air tasted bitter, dry and thin.The oxygen content was low and only just within safety range for humans.Air that was safe to breathe was not always nice to breathe.Furthermore, the planets gravity was higher than standard, being rated at 1.07.Lets go!Follow me!commanded Michael as he headed for the cover of the rocks.They followed him across the uneven ground and huddled close to a massive boulder.He glanced back at Adrastus.You know this area better than anyone.Where to from here?Adrastus stepped forward to stand beside him.There are various crevices and gaps through these rocks.If we can make it to the other side there is an entrance to a tunnel that follows the underground water generation system.The tunnel was built to be used by service droids.It will take us directly into the subterranean levels beneath the settlement.If we can get to the tunnel we will be able to avoid the alien defences above ground.The aliens wont let us in without a fight, with or without a secret tunnel, said Ajax.Even so, it may help us enter the settlement, said Michael.Adrastus, lead the way.Adrastus and Aradel led them into a narrow crevice which cut directly into the hill.The crew followed closely behind as the two colonists pushed forward as quickly as they could.The way was only just wide enough for them to pass through.Within two minutes the crevice widened and opened out on the opposite side of the hill.They gathered behind a jagged rock which hid them from view.Michael peeked over the edge of the rock and he could see the settlement across an arid field of sand.About twenty yards ahead was a metal cylindrical hatch cover.It was the entrance to the water generation system.Ajax lifted his military binoculars and then let out a groan.This looks bad, Cap.Theyve got some seriously tough defensive positions.If we come out in the open they will fry us.How many can you see?The binoculars are saying there are thirty four targets.They are preparing some heavy duty mobile artillery guns.They know were coming, Cap.Theyre just waiting for us to walk into their trap.Do you think we can make it to the hatch?Not likely.Their scanners will see us as soon as we break cover, said Ajax, shaking his head.His wrist com beeped.Captain.There are two squads of aliens approaching the Out Drifter.Theyre taking cover in the rocks and firing on the ship.I cant effectively target them with the ships guns.I have to take off before they damage the ship.Captain, they are going to flank your position Saras voice sounded strained.Sara, take off and fire the rockets at the alien defensive positions.Then get out of here and wait for me to give you a position to extract us.Im on it.Taking off now  Michael turned to the group.We only have a few seconds to cross to the hatch, so be ready.The Out Drifter rose up behind the rocky hill and hovered for a few seconds.Several large blasts of plasma rocketed into the ship from the alien artillery gun.The Out Drifters electronic shield system diffused the attack.Sara then unleashed a series of rockets at the alien defensive positions.The team watched as the missiles left trails of smoke in the orange sky and exploded on impact.Now!shouted Michael as he sprinted forward.They dashed around the edge of the rock and ran for the hatch.For a moment Michael thought his plan had worked, but then a ray of plasma shot by, just missing his shoulder, and an instant later many more followed.Adrastus fell in the sand, and Aradel stopped to help him, but it was instantly clear that he was dead.Ajax grabbed Aradels wrist and dragged her onward as Michael lifted the hatch door.Cynthia was the first in, followed by Ajax and Aradel.Michael and Ethan fired their rifles at the alien positions.Ivan leapt in after the others; Dog Two and Ethan followed, and Michael jumped in after them and closed the hatch.They were standing in a subterranean tunnel, which was dimly lit by tiny service lights.The lights did little to push back the darkness.The tunnel was just large enough to stand in and there was an inch of water beneath their feet.Aradel moaned in grief and fell to her knees.Im sorry, said Cynthia, placing her hand on Aradels shoulder.We have to make a move!said Ajax.It wont take them long to find us.Ethan fired a glow flare down the tunnel and the entire way lit up.Ajax and Ivan began walking in the direction of the settlement.Michael was about to follow, but Aradel refused to get up.Cynthia crouched down beside her.Aradel, we need you to take us to the hidden vault, she said gently.Aradel was stricken with grief and lifted her sorrowful eyes.Adrastus didnt deserve to die here.I understand, Aradel, but we have to go before the aliens come for us, said Cynthia.I dont know if I can, she replied in little more than a whisper.She shouldnt have come.This is a combat mission, said Ajax harshly.Shut up, Ajax, shouted Cynthia.Her uncle just died!His eyes narrowed, but he remained silent.The hatch above opened.The light of day lit up the tunnel directly around them.They looked up.The face of an alien was staring back at them.Its thin slash for a mouth twisted into a snarl, revealing a sharp set of fangs.Its two dark eyes, which were many times larger than human eyes, widened for a moment.It looked like a deformed and mutated human, with dark grey skin, an enlarged skull without hair, and a thin sinewy neck.Only one thought entered Michaels mind; it was an aberration of nature.Dog Two growled up at the creature.Ajax was the first to react and lifted his rifle.The alien recoiled an instant later and slammed the hatch shut just before Ajax could fire.Michael watched the hatch for a moment.He felt something wasnt right.
