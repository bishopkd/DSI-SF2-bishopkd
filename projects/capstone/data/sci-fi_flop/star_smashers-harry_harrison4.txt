They swooped in for a landing just before sunset and trooped into the fort."See you at the celebration in a while, Steigen Sterben," Jerry said."We're going to see what Sally can rustle up for us. ""Of course, but do not be late, for this is the greatest moment in ten thousand years of history of our poor planet.Your names will ring down through the ages. ""Nix on that," Jerry told him, and the others nodded agreement."We can't take that kind of thing.We're just some guys doing our job and helping our friends and we don't go for that sort of mush, no, sir!"They tramped through the halls and through the open door and called out the name of the girl whom at least two of them loved."Sally!"Her piercing scream was the only answer.They fought each other to be first through the door and entered just in time to see her shrieking body being carried in the tentacles of a stinking Garnishee down through a secret trapdoor let into the floor.They dived forward as one, only to have the trapdoor slam shut in their faces.Cursing and struggling, they tore at the unyielding metal, and SteigenSterben ran breathlessly into the room."I heard your mental cries of anger and fear," he said,  "so I came at once. ""Sally," Chuck panted, "that thing took her down there.Help us get this trapdoor open, so we can follow and save her. "Steigen Sterben's forehead wrinkled with intense thought, and then he sighed a deep and tremulous sigh.With a despairing gesture he reached out and laid a comforting hand on the shoulder of all three of them and made a helpless gesture with his remaining hand."Struggle no more, I beg of you," he entreated."Why?"struggling, "we must save her. ""You cannot," Steigen Sterben intoned in the most funereal of tones."For it is too late.I attempted to reach her mind with mine to enable you to locate her when pfiff  with utmost suddenness her thoughts were no more. ""You mean.... ""Sadly, I do.If her thoughts have been stopped this poor girl, so far from home, is dead. "8  THE GHASTLY SECRET REVEALED  The shocked silence continued for an inordinately long time because, as you can very well imagine, no one had much to say after receiving that news.Steigen Sterben, knowing how they felt, tiptoed out of the door and left them to their sadness."She was a good old girl," Chuck finally choked out."A number one," Jerry choked in answer."Let's go fuel up the plane and rebuild that starboard engine," Jerry suggested."Good idea," Chuck agreed, and they left in silence with their misery.John let them go, knowing they wanted to be alone together, or maybe just alone, or maybe together, with their loss.He felt the loss no less keenly himself, although he had known that wonderful girl only from a distance up until a few days ago.He scuffled about the room dazedly, and when he passed the sealed trapdoor, he gave it a vicious kick and it instantly flew open.At this unexpected event he drew back, his keen senses alert again, wondering instantly what it could mean.Whatever it meant he had to investigate, even if the dark opening were filled with repellent Garnishee  in fact, he would welcome that!Take as many as possible to the grave with him.He remembered that there was an armory in the next room, and he hurried there and seized a heavy sword, then rushed back to the gaping entrance to the netherworld revealed by the open trapdoor.Filled by conflicting emotions, he did not think or reason but hurled himself headlong into the darkness.Something struck his skull heavily, and he was unconscious on the instant.When he came to an immeasurable period of time later, all was in darkness still, and bis head hurt.Not only that but there was an awful stench in the air, and he knew instantly that it was the Garnishee, he had heard they smelled bad and, wow!, was that rumor ever right.They were close around him, unseen and slithering close, and the instant a wet tentacle slithered down his face, he lashed out with a quick fist and connected solidly, and a really satisfying scream  they screamed like girls  was his reward.Then there was a sudden flare of light, and he saw that he had been right and he was surrounded by the repulsive Garnishee.Well, half right at least, because the one he had hit was really Sally Goodfellow, who had been stroking his head, who, in return, got a right cross to the eye, wbich was now producing a really interesting mouse."You're alive!"he gasped."No thanks to you, you monster!You trying to kill me?""I thought you were a monster. ""Well, you thought wrong, and gee, thanks. ""We thought you were dead.Steigen Sterben told us so. ""Old Steigy has said a lot of things that aren't so kosher.Now listen.... ""You listen.I just found out that I am sitting on my sword.When I count to three, you make a break for it, and I'll cut these creeps down.One, two "  "No, hold on, will you, and just listen for a minute. "She dived across the intervening space and hung from his sword arm so he couldn't lift it, and two of the Garnishee quickly disarmed him."Why, you ofay dyke, traitor to the human race and "  "I said listen, not flap the jaw.Listen and learn. ""Weel you tell heem all?"the Garnishee who was holding the lamp said, disconcertingly, because his mouth was just above his waist, where, if he were a human being, he would have had his 'pippick'."I'll tell him, Slug Togath, but make sure your boys hold onto him well.One shiner a day is enough. ""Why, you "  "Shaddap.Listen and learn, kiddo.We have been had.Steigen Sterben and his bunch are nothing but a bunch of weirdos who have been trying to take over this planet for ten thousand years from the law abiding Garnishee. ""Who fed you this line of guff?""I did, young man," said Slug Togath, "so please have the courtesy to permit the young lady to finish before you interrupt. ""Yeah," John sneered, feeling put down."Your manners aren't so great either, nor is your smell.And your English isn't so wonderful.Where did you learn it, on the radio?""It so happens I did.Our powerful receivers have been listening to your radio programs for years.Little Orphan Annie, BBC, Radio Free Transylvania, Buck Rogers, Radio Moscow, the works.Though you apparently have received none of our answering broadcasts, undoubtedly because of the inferiority of your receivers. "Feeling more than a little put upon, John relaxed, although the imprisoning tentacles held firm, and then listened with growing incredulity."First off," Sally explained, "the Garnishee grabbed me and then hit you on the head in the darkness so that the Ormoloo.who monitor our thoughts all the time no matter what you hear to the contrary.would think I had been killed.What really happened was they put a mind shield on my head, your head too, so our thoughts could not be read.See mine. "She turned so he could see the golden mesh of wire on her skull, very much like an alien yarmulke, and he became aware, at the same time, of one on his own head as well."Once my mind was shielded Slug Togath explained, with colored slides, the history of this planet.It seems the Garnishee are the only intelligent race here, and since they are millennia older than our Earth civilizations, they are way ahead of us in the science field and that kind of thing.They have a democratic form of government with an elected head of state, that's Slug Togath here, he is the prime minister, a two house congress, a supreme court and graduated income tax.All was like unto a paradise on Earth, or rather Domite, until the Lortonoi came along and began this war of extinction.  ""The who?""The Lortonoi. ""That's what I thought you said.But what about the Ormoloo, whom they are supposed to be fighting?""They are nothing but domesticated animals, like cattle on Earth, whose minds, what they have of them, have been seized by the Lortonoi and have been used for their evil ends. ""Well, that at least explains their eating habits  and that film we saw!""I heard about that.That film was made by the Garnishee many years ago.It's a training film for a butcher's school, showing how to cut the Ormoloo up for chops and steaks and things like that.Now shut up and listen, will you, because we don't have too much time.Where was I?Oh, yes, ten thousand years ago the Lortonoi landed on this planet and attempted to seize the minds of the Garnishee and turn them into slaves so they could use the advanced technology here since they, the Lortonoi, have never had any science of their own but only use slave races to do everything.Anyway, the Garnishee resisted, and some unsung genius invented the mind shields which they now all wear from the moment of birth.  ""How can they?"John broke in, becoming more confused instead of less."They don't have heads but tentacles on top instead. ""They can because they wear the mind shields on their brains, not their heads, stupid, so they don't need heads.Particularly since they have their brains in one of their feet. "And sure enough, now that his attention was drawn to it, John saw that each of the aliens had a mind shield on one foot."So once their minds were shielded they fought back and determined to crush the evil invaders.But this has taken a long time.From their secret headquarters the Lortonoi fiends took control of many of the Ormoloo, causing them to break free of the ranches and fields, to kill the cowboys, and to rise against their masters.By themselves the Ormoloo have the intelligence of retarded sheep, but their minds are now controlled from afar, so they organize into armies, run factories and that kind of thing, and war to the death against the peaceful Garnishee. "It took John a few minutes to digest this, but digest it he did, and his jaw firmed up, and he reached a decision."It all makes sense, Sally, and if it is true, then we'd better rush and get hold of Jerry and Chuck because they are in great danger because I am sure that all the Ormoloo want from us is the secret of the cheddite projector.But I must have some proof.I cannot take this all on hearsay, as, you will pardon my saying so, you have.It is one thing to convince a simple, though lovely, girl "  "Why, thanks a lot, buster!I have a BA in home economics!"" it is another thing to show proof to someone of my background and training in spying, warfare, intelligence, brain surgery, proctoscopy, codes and ciphers, blue ribbon cooking, and murder. "Tentacles waved, and Slug Togath waved fastest."Waving tentacles mean agreement, tovarich  or is it mister?"he said."Call me John  but that's only for my friends. ""We desperately desire your friendship soon to becalled John.Come this way, for demonstration has been prepared. "He led the way through a labyrinth of tunnels that apparently lay under the Ormoloo fort, to a dimly lit room one wall of which was made of glass."Silence," he whispered, "for we can be heard but not seen since that partition is made of one way glass.If you will look, you will see some Ormoloo whom we have recently taken prisoner. "John looked and gasped.The Ormoloo were down on all sixes, or rather what he thought had been arms had really been legs, which explained the variations in joints he had noticed.They strolled about with empty stares while some of their number ate grass from a manger.One of them mooed lowingly, and the others took up the cry until it sounded like milking time on the ranch."But what?"John gasped."Look," Slug Togath directed."Each of them is wearing a mind shield so it cannot be controlled by the Lortonoi.Now the demonstration.We have a remote manipulating apparatus in the ceiling with which we will remove the brain shield from any of these creatures that you may select.The choice is up to you. ""You're on.Okay, that one there that's making like feeding time at the zoo. "A metal arm tipped with claw fingers dropped down from above and whisked the shielding from the Ormoloo's head.Instantly it spat out the grass and stood upright on its hind legs, the light of evil intelligence now glowing in its formerly bucolic eyes.There was a rack of swords across the room, and it dived that way and seized one.Instantly Slug Togath spoke."Put down that sword and surrender.If you don't, we will injure that Ormoloo body you have possessed. "His only answer was an evil cackle."What care I for this cattle body?"the thing shouted and leaped forward sword raised."We Lortonoi cannot die, but you Garnishee can, and we will not stop until you are destroyed.... "The metal arm swooped and put the mind shield back into place and instantly a dramatic change took place.The sword clattered to the floor, and the Ormoloo dropped back on all sixes, mooing loudly, then returned to the grass and began to feed again.John had seen enough."Slug Togath, old monster, I have seen enough," he said."Put her there. "And they shook hands, or rather tentacles, or rather tentacle and hand."From now on we're on the same side.Now let's go get the rest of the gang. ""Might I suggest that discretion is the better part of valor," Slug Togath suggested."If it is discovered that you are using mind shields, you will instantly have every Ormoloo turned against you.What is important, and the first order of business, is to grab the cheddite projector.Once you have that secured we will pour out of the tunnels and overwhelm the fort, and you will be safe, as will the Pleasantville Eagle.We will have only this one chance, and we must not muff it, because all our surviving warriors are here in the tunnel, only cripples and children remain at home, since you annihilated ninety nine point nine percent of our people. ""Sorry about that. ""Not half as sorry as we are, but that is neither here nor there, and within a thousand years our population will have grown again.But now, to work!Darkness has fallen, and we will lead you through this maze of tunnels to an exit very near your flying vehicle.Remember, to the Lortonoi you are invisible since your mind is shielded.But if one of their slave Ormoloo sees you that will be the ball game.So  steal home and hit a home run. ""You hear a lot of baseball games on yoqr highpowered radio?""Far too many.Now go!Take these mind shields for your friends, and place this communicating device in your pocket, and once you have the cheddite projector in your possession, press this button labeled 'apritzxer' which can be translated, roughly, as OK. ""I can't read these hen tracks. ""Most annoying.Well, this one then, of the color red"  "You're on. ""Good luck!"Sally called out."The fate of a world, perhaps of the whole known universe, rests with you. "He pressed her hand, then was gone.The Garnishee stumped quickly along on their thick legs, and he had to hurry to keep up.Finally they came to a tunnel that ended in a raw dirt wall."Extinguish the lights," Slug Togath ordered."We have arrived.Only a foot of dirt remains between us and the surface.My men will now dig it away, and you will emerge.Our hopes go with you. "There was a rapid insufflating sound, and an opening appeared in the raw dirt and was quickly widened.Stars were visible in the dark sky beyond, and aided by a pushing tentacle, John squeezed through and onto the ground beyond.He was in a shallow gully, and when he peered carefully over the edge, he saw the fort, illuminated in the darkness, with the Pleasantville Eagle close by.He crawled that way, seeking what cover he could, drawn on by the welcoming cabin lights.He smiled into the darkness, knowing what kind of welcome his news would bring.Sally alive!What a greeting he would get!Then the gangway was close to hand, and after a quick look around to make sure that the coast was clear, he rushed up it and into the cabin.The door opened to the pilot's compartment, and Chuck came in carrying the cheddite projector."Chuck!"John called out."I have some really tremendous news for you.But first put down that gadget because I don't want it busted. ""Yes," Chuck said, listlessly, undoubtedly still filled with grief about Sally.Was he in for a surprise!"Now listen, guy  and I'm really on the level.About Sally...what are you doing?"He looked on puzzledly as Chuck straightened up again with the submachine gun in his arms, an evil grin on his features."What am I going to do?I am going to kill you, filthy alien swine!"The gun roared point blank, and darkness instantly fell.9  THE LAST BATTLE.OR IS IT?After an unmeasurable amount of time John crept feebly back to consciousness.His head felt as though it had been caught in a destruction derby, and for quite a while, all he could do was lie there quietly and not even moan because even moaning hurt.Finally, with great reluctance he forced one eye open, then the other, and discovered that he was lying in the aisle of the plane staring up at the ceiling.Hesitantly he raised reluctant fingers to his bruised skull and touched it, which did not feel nice at all, and brought them away bloodstained.Shot to death!was his first thought, but, since he was still alive and not paralyzed, he realized that was not true.It appeared that one bullet at least had grazed his skull, he hoped without fracturing it, and had rendered him unconscious.Bullet!When he realized what this meant full memory returned in a flash, and he groped, groaning, for the communicator from his pocket.For some unfathomable reason Chuck had shot him and escaped with the cheddite projector.The red button meant OK, so he stayed away from that one and played a tune of despair upon all the others since things definitely were not OK.A shrill squeaking sound and a guttural growl reached his ears, and instantly, despite the triphammer of pain it produced in his head, he was on his feet and facing this new menace, hands outstretched in the judo killer position.The eerie sounds were coming from the direction of the control cabin, so crouched in the judo defense position, he stalked there on wary tiptoes, ready for anything.Though he lowered his guard, settled onto his heels, and gaped when he saw what it was that had disturbed him.Jerry Courteney lay on the cabin floor writhing like a snake.He was on his back, his eyes closed, his fists clenched, growling like a dog, and gritting his teeth at the same time to make the chalk on blackboard squeaking sound.For a long moment John gazed at his writhing friend in wide eyed astonishment, then, through the tortured synapses of his beat up brain came the first glimmerings of understanding."The Lortonoi, who else!"he ejaculated, then groped in his pocket for one of the mind shields the Garnishee had given him.Kneeling, he slipped it into place on Jerry's head.The results were incredibly dramatic.Jerry instantly stopped writhing and growling, and his body relaxed, and he opened his eyes and smiled."Wow," he breathed, "gone at last. ""Was something trying to get into your mind and control you?"John queried."Brother, you are not just whistling 'Dixie'!Insidious mental tentacles of some hideously repulsive alien life form were attempting to take over my body  but I fought back!The hardest battle of my entire career.I couldn't throw them out, and finally, they must have decided they could not win because they settled for just dropping me down on the deck and closing my eyes.I was struggling away when all of a sudden they left, poof, just like that!""The mind shield.I put it on your head so they couldn't get through to you. ""That's pretty good, John.You wouldn't like to tell me where you got a gadget like that, would you?""It's a long story but first "  "Death to the aliens!"Jerry shouted, leaping to his feet."Three cheers for the red, white, and blue!"He seized up the oxyhydrogen torch, lit it to flaring life and dived to the attack toward the Garnishee who were crowding into the cabin.John gave him a quick karate chop to the wrist as he went by, so the torch dropped, then another quick hack on the kidneys, which paralyzed him and dropped him back to the deck again."Traitor!"Jerry growled at John when he knelt to turn off the torch and struggled to raise his hands to throttle his former companion.Two more lightning karate chops paralyzed his arms as well, so John could reason with him."It's a complicated story, I tried to tell you, but part of it is good, like look there, see who has come to take care of you. ""Sally!Alive!"Jerry gasped as the girl pushed through the tentacles and hurried to his side."It is indeed a miracle. "Her tender arms embraced him, and they kissed, and John writhed like a willow in the wind burned by the hot fires of jealousy, for he too, now, had to admit that, like the others, he was head over heels in love with this slim girl.He forced his eyes away from this painful necking scene and faced Slug Togath, who had led his noisome followers as they crowded into the plane."Here is what I think happened," John told the alien prime minister."The Lortonoi must have been very suspicious when Sally and I both 'vanished' mentally, and they may have gotten their wind up and had a bug in their ear. ""What do their digestion and their hearing have to do with it?"Slug Togath asked in puzzlement."Will you kindly shut up and let me finish?Fearing that their dark secret had been discovered, they launched a mental attack on Chuck and Jerry here in the plane.Jerry fought back with every fiber of his being, and the most they could do was hold him down mentally while they worked their plan.But, somehow, they took over Chuck's brain.They made him grab the cheddite projector and light out of here on the double.That's when I showed up, so they made him shoot me, or at least try to.He is a crack shot, so I should be dead, but since I am not, it seems he still has a measure of control and was able to deflect their aim.Once I went down he escaped with the cheddite projector and, if you will pardon my saying so, shouldn't we be taking off after him instead of standing around beating our gums?"There was a thunder of heavy feet as the Garnishee rushed for the door.Slug Togath stayed behind and issued incomprehensible orders in a strange tongue through a hand communicator."The attack has begun," he announced."We have hurled our entire remaining forces against the fort.Pray to Great Cacodyl that we succeed before their reinforcements arrive. ""Let me shake your tentacle," Jerry said, now recovered, striding forward."Sally has told me everything, and I'm glad to have you on our side.I'm sorry about, you know, wiping out almost all your ancient and intelligent race... ""Fortunes of war, we shall not speak of it again.Ahh, I have a message!"The communicator blurbled and bleeped."The walls have been breached, we are inside the fort, the attack is succeeding, though, of course, not without an incredible loss of life on both sides.Wait!What is this?Something has happened.The advance guard reports a hideous alien life form has been spotted  that must be your friend, Chuck  they are closing in but 'preprabishkom!'he is escaping!"They rushed to the windows and had their first view of the battle.Half the fort was in ruins, and flames guttered through the rest.Bodies, of friend and foe alike, littered the landscape, which was also a junkyard of wrecked war vehicles."There he goes!"Slug Togath shouted, pointing a quivering tentacle.From the ruined fort there slowly rose up a strange flying vehicle.Shells exploded around it, but miraculously, it escaped and rose even higher in the merciless glare of the piercing Garnishee searchlights.It was a steam driven ornithopter held aloft by four pairs of great flapping black wings.Smoke gushed from the chimney, and the wings thrashed and beat strongly as the flying machine gathered speed and rushed toward the horizon."Strap in, everyone," Jerry shouted, diving for the controls."We're going after him!"They barely had time to find their seats before the great bulk of the Pleasantville Eagle was roaring down the improvised runway and hurling itself into the air."I have it on the radar," John announced."It looks like he's heading due north. ""I feared that," Slug Togath said gloomily, but would not elucidate."We'll catch up with them quickly enough," Jerry said assuredly."That wing flapping gadget can't outfly this baby. "But Jerry's prediction was brought to naught, for as soon as the ornithopter had reached sufficient altitude and speed, a built in ramjet fired, and the wings were retracted, and the now jet powered aircraft sizzled north above the speed of sound.It was all that the 747 could do, throttles wide open, to keep the alien vessel on the edge of the radarscope."They have to come down some time," Jerry said, grimly."And when they do, we'll be there. "Onwards they raced in this race to save a race, a man, a world, possibly the entire inhabited galaxy, and soon dawn rushed upon them and, yes, their quarry was visible as a dark spot against the eternal snowfields that hurtled by below."What in tarnation is he doing up here at the North Pole?"Jerry asked puzzledly."Does anyone live up here?""Not to our knowledge," Slug Togath answered grimly."But we have our suspicions.It seems that during all the centuries of eternal warfare upon this planet we have never known where the secret base is from which the Lortonoi operate with their mental powers.We have had suspicions and have raided certain areas, but we feel now that these were, how do you say it, blue herrings to throw us off "  "Red," Jerry said."We say red. ""Blue reds to throw us off "  "Herrings, not reds, you got it wrong "  "Look, do you mind if I finish the story and we save the goddamn language lesson for later?"Slug Togath snapped irritably, undoubtedly fatigued and out of sorts because of the destruction of most of his millennia old race."For the last few centuries we have come to suspect one certain inaccessible location at the North Pole, an extinct volcano named Mount Krisco, and plans were being drawn up for a secret attack. ""The escaping ornithopter jet is losing speed and dropping!"John called out, hunched over the radar screen."It's going down, and it looks like it is heading toward that mountain, the big one that looks like an extinct volcano. ""Mount Krisco. "Slug Togath sighed."Is he committing suicide?"Sally screeched as the ornithopter jet dived straight at the side of the mountain."Would he were," Slug Togath intoned grimly."I realize you will be put out by the death of your friend, but this is as nothing to one who has lost almost his entire race, and it would mean the destruction of the cheddite projector which would keep it out of the hands  if they have hands  of the Lortonoi.No, too bad, such a happy course is not possible. "At the very last instant a great slab of the solid mountain swung back to reveal a black opening in the stone cliff.The 747 dived to follow, but long before they were close, the secret entrance had closed again so that they had to veer off."I'll land on that ice sheet there," Jerry said."We'll follow him into the secret hideout. "Meanwhile, Sally, who was more than a little rumpled after being kidnapped, dragged through tunnels and that kind of thing, decided she ought to freshen up or at least comb the tangles out of her hair.Unthinkingly she picked up her comb and took the mind shield from her head.Instantly, she was a different person.A look of malevolent cunning swept across her features and painted them with an evil grin while her tongue darted in and out like a snake's.With her fingers clenching and unclenching like talons she sidled across the cabin and, in a lightning quick motion seized the submachine gun and flicked off the safety."This is the end for all of you," she snarled in a voice rich with venom."Look upon your deaths, and let me revel in your expressions of horrified shock before I press the trigger and send this plane with all aboard crashing into the Artic wastes. ""Sally  have you gone mad?"Jerry cried out, flicking on the automatic pilot and jumping to his feet."No!"Slug Togath called out and put out a tentacle to stop him."That is not Sally talking.I recognize the voice as one of the Lortonoi.She must have lost her mind shield. ""Very acute thinking, Garnishee swine. "Sally laughed in the alien voice of the thing that had possessed her."But soon you will think no more.We now have the secret of the cheddite projector and no longer need waste our time on your backward planet.The galaxy is ours!"With these last shouted words she pressed hard on the trigger, and ravening bullets screamed from the muzzle of the gun.But quick as she had been, Slug Togath was quicker.He hurled his trunklike body into the path of the bullets, then tore the weapon from her hand, imprisoning her instantly with many tentacles."You're hurt," Jerry called out."Shot a dozen times at least!""Please do not concern yourself for my physical condition.We Garnishee are very tough and almost bulletproof, and the few slugs that penetrated will be absorbed by my body chemistry in a matter of days. ""Too late, too late!"Sally rasped in a hoarse voice and began to laugh madly."What does she, I mean it, mean?""There is your answer," Slug Togath pointed."The Lortonoi are fleeing our planet, escaping with the galaxy's most important secret. "Even as he spoke, there was a rumble from the extinct volcano and a flare of fire and a plume of smoke.But this was no simple eruption, a plain matter of lava and poison gas, but something far more important.With a thunderous roar a great spaceship hurled itself into the air from the mouth of the volcano and sped skyward.Faster and faster it went, shrinking to a tiny dot and then finally vanishing completely."They have escaped," Slug Togath sighed, and his tentacles went limp.Sally dropped to the floor, and John put her mind shield back on."Well, let's not worry too much, gang," Jerry said, looking for the bright side of the disaster."They won't hurt Chuck, not as long as he is of value to them, and we'll go after them and get him back safe and sound, just you wait and see. ""How will you do that?"Slug Togath asked."Simplicity itself.The old Pleasantville Eagle here is a tough old bird and already has logged a lot of hours in space.We'll fix her up for operation in a vacuum, as well as atmosphere, slap together another cheddite projector and go after him. ""A really great idea," John said raising one eyebrow sardonically."But just how are you going to go about building this projector?""Well.First get some cheddar cheese and put it into... "His voice ran down like a tired phonograph record, and he gaped into silence."Good thinking, old buddy," John said, still sardonically."All we need is a hunk of cheese to build the projector, a certain kind of cheese.But that cheese is back on Earth, and in order to get to Earth we are going to need a projector that we need the cheese for, or do you read me?In my humble American German Russian opinion we are up the creek without a paddle. "10  AN INSIDE JOB AND A NOBLE CRUSADE  It was one of those moments about which it might have been said that the emotional tenor of those present bordered on the abysmally depressed.It might have been said.It could not have been said because where there is hope, there is life, and Jerry, shocked as he was by this disclosure, still had hope, and he sent his agile mind furiously seeking a solution to this apparently insoluble problem.In the matter of seconds he had it."Hold on now," he said, snapping his fingers loudly."I remember something.When we originally left on this trip, we thought we would be away at least a couple of hours, ha ha, little did we know, and I have memories of Chuck fixing up some sandwiches to take along just in case. ""What kind of sandwiches?"John entreated in hushed tones."That's a mystery.I remember he just went out and made them.But knowing old Chuck, now a mental prisoner of those fiends but still a buddy, I know they were one of two kinds.Either garlic salami or cheddar cheese. ""I don't see us building a garlicite projector," John mused."But if they were cheese and if they weren't eaten  why, we still have a chance.Let's go look in the galley!"He led the race through the immense ship and skidded to a halt with the others right behind him at the 747's galley.Sally, whom they had not noticed leave, was standing by the counter licking crumbs from her fingers.Before her on the counter was some crunkled wax paper."Stale and pretty lousy," she complained, and belched delicately."But when you consider we have been a week now without food, I guess it wasn't too bad. ""You ate a sandwich?"Jerry rasped, and she nodded in response."You ate the whole thing?"A nod again, then silence until John spoke up in a strangled voice."What kind of sandwich?""Cheese.What else would be here?My goodness, I don't know how Chuck ever managed to eat so much of it, it really is kind of nasty.Why are you all looking at me that way and closing in slowly?So, I'm sorry.I didn't save any for you.But I was hungry, I mean.... "Her voice ran down under the glare of the circling eyes, and she took a hesitant step backward."Come on, fellows. "She smiled falsely.
