Trent watched Amy with bright eyes.Yes, maybe.Just because you have a hidden side Ive never explored.The couple broke up and went around the spaceship and engaged in pleasurable activities.Trent found a flower that needed water.He adjusted the ultraviolet light to improve photosynthesis.Amy stayed in the training room and did body movements.It wasnt just to increase the strength of muscles.It was also to raise Chi, and get back to the natural energy flow.Somewhere in the midst of it all, she began to think about what Trent had said.She had also been attracted.Attracted not due to the freethinking theyd shared, but rather by the clumsy: The fact that Trent didnt think enough.That he had sudden conclusions.That he sometimes would go off to pee without hiding it.She was attracted by the idea of the forbidden.On the trick her psyche played in moments she wasnt really there.They didnt continue the discussion.They just touched upon the thought.They let themselves be carried away by everything that was inconvenient.At last they began to suspect that they were onto something.They didnt know if it was the relationship, the adventure or something else theyd actually left.I think its bigger than us.Trent said.He sat in the training chair and pushed weights.How do you mean?I mean that theres information coming into us.The contemplation of the dust cloud, the ability we have to put everything aside.The search that is no more.This trip is something else.Yes, maybe.I suspect well change and become something else.The attraction I felt for you only increases.Youre uninterested in my comments: Up in your own world of mathematics, the physical concerns and reluctance.Amy smiled.Whats important is that I continue.Trent said, That I let myself be carried away by a feeling I dont know.I think Im starting to realize something about you.Amy said, The information Ive carried have created a distance and prevented me from seeing your true nature.Ive thought that youve led humanity forward: That our exploits have created entropy and led to some progress.But the chaos weve seen is just the beginning of something new: On a new arrangement of emotions and instincts: On a social order of unsuspected nature.Do you talk about evil?Yes, evil.Our evil is in fact the only good in our nature.What weve thought is good is in fact evil and vice versa.Trent pushed some more weights, but stopped and looked at Amy.Yes, maybe thats why we didnt feel anything for each other earlier.The couple went off to the table they were previously at, took some nerve stimulants and allowed themselves to be carried away.Theres no interstellar cloud.Trent said, The cloud is in ourselves.Its an idea we nurtured on the ultimate adventure.But the adventure is here, right in front of us.Amy laughed.Trent took to a strange habit.They regarded the interstellar cloud that stood out against the bright sky: A cloud in a cloud, as if they were in the birth chamber of the universe.Nothing was forbidden.The most evil idea dominated.Finally, the pair ended up in bed but did nothing.They were preparing for the final destination: The cloud of information that theyd nurtured on the whole trip.* * *      The social order of the colony began to stabilize.The faith in the old disappeared.The order followed a universal principle of emergence: When streamlined thought structures disappeared chaos vanished and a new order could be born.The freethinkers were no longer freethinkers.They were scientists.They discovered that the origin of life was no mystery.The information was not out in space.It was at the colony and could be recovered by analyzing all the texts.The true information was to negate all claims and think on the contrary.A new science could be born.The couple was united, had children and became messengers in the new era.Affinity      The gate between earth and eternity      It was not just unusual; it was very strange that Simone would take the space elevator to space lock this afternoon.The summer was hot and dense in the northern hemisphere surface.To look down towards the jagged contours that marked Europe was a staggering sight to the untrained eye.She saw Britains boot like design and cloudy sky that spread out from the home country further towards the northeast.It was a gigantic sea of blue and equally massive mountains of water vapor, which existed at different altitudes, and formed contours with chance accuracy.Simone shared the space elevator with a few other travelers.These would probably go further to the moon, Mars or the outer colonies.The year was 2105.Simone had fantasized all day about the man who approached her for a couple of days ago, with seriousness in his voice.The first meeting had been a purposefully muted but also strained display of something exceedingly rare: Christopher, who worked as a border controller on the space station, had encountered problems and needed a practicing psychoanalyst.His choice of words, with recurrent periods of rest, was like a bad sign.Simone didnt know the nature of the mission.Instead, the man stressed confidentiality, that the work was confidential and that the payment would be satisfactory.Simone was considering the offer, but knowing in advance that her thoughts were not rational.She had in her aridity tired of earth life and selected danger before safety.Simone looked again towards the shrinking globe.The space lock hovered above the globe, as any space station, in geostationary orbit.The difference was that this one was much bigger.It existed as a definite barrier between Earth and the colonies out there.A sort of checkpoint where space travelers could be kept under observation and space terror could be avoided.Soon the journey was over and the psychoanalyst docked with the destination.
