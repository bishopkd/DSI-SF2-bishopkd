You have a change of clothes?She shakes her head.Unzips the rainbow knapsack with the decal of My Little Pony.I half expect a tinier pony to come out.Instead, a bottle and diaper inside.You wont need those for awhile.I know.I just like having them with me.Remind me why Im doing this, you know?Makes sense.The knapsack was mine when I was a little girl.Always made me feel safe.I hope to pass it on, if shes a girl.Looks a little worse for wear.Yeah, well.I couldnt find the part of Central Park with the Laundromat.She smiles.Youre not from some youth hostel, are you?Me?No.I am from Hoboken though.Are you going to hurt me?No.Were you going to hurt me?This ones tougher.I say no.Because I would have tried to make it painless.Still a lie, I know.Well, thank you.For your help.I havent met too many people here who would help me.Not a problem.You listen to music?No.What do you listen to?I hold up a hand.Moment of silence.The city quiet.I listen to that.Lot of people tapped in here, huh?Yeah.Not most.But a lot.I guess I should be getting to bed.Yell if you need something.Im a light sleeper.She looks me over.Then asks.How old are you anyway?I told you.Its only fair.Me?Im you, plus fifteen years.She winces.Laughs again.God, I hope not.Morning.Making waffles.I mix batter, then head down to the street corner.Pick up takeout coffees, bagels, and the Post.Three comforts that outlived the apocalypse.Daily News went under and the Times long since disappeared into the limnosphere.Now its just a ticker running through rich peoples dreams.But God bless the Post.They still publish.On paper.I get back, shes up and dressed.Left her a sweatshirt, which on her grew into a dress.Sorry about the fit.All my clothes are garbageman clothes.Its clean.Its great.You sleep okay?Yeah.About three weeks worth.She giggles.What?You have a waffle iron.Yes I do.You dont really strike me as a waffle iron kind of guy.Best way Ive found yet for making waffles.Cant argue with that.It was a gift.From my wife.Eyebrow arches like a cornered cat.Really.And wheres she?Deceased.Im sorry.Cat relaxes.But slowly.I slide a waffle on her plate.So whats next?Im not sure.Ive thought about Canada.Last I heard, borders closed.Yeah.I heard that too.Plates cleared, coffee drained, waffles eaten.Me doing dishes.What can I say?I dont mind.I have a dishwasher too.Never used.I like to clean up my own mess, as a rule.She wanders over to the fridge while Im not paying attention.Stainless steel.Sub Zero.A remnant from the Wall Street types.You got any ice cream?She glances over.So sue me.Im pregnant.Opens the freezer.Inside, a single Ziploc baggie.Inside the Ziploc, a butcher paper wrapped package, about the size of a brick.Cat arches again, but playful.Whats this?Your secret stash?I step over right quick.That?No.She pulls the baggie out.Holds it up.Laughing now.Teasing.What, you deal coke?Is that how you afford this place?I snatch the bag back.No.I do a bit of butchering.Really?Its a hobby.Cool.So whats that?Please tell me its bacon.No.Not bacon.Just bones.For stock.Well, look at you, Mr Julia Child.Let me know if you rustle up some bacon.Im not a big meat eater but Ive had weird cravings of late.Rubs her belly.I stash the bag.Close the freezer.Step between her and it.Try to smile.Cant let the cold out.I dont have many visitors.So I get sloppy.Forget.A freezer is a very bad place to keep your souvenirs.10.Lazy Sunday.Me in an armchair.Her on the sofa with Sports.Regular Cleavers.I flip through the Post.A22.Tiny item.DEATH DINER DOUBLE SLAY.The American Century.I fold the paper back.Read it.Fill in the parts between the lines.Surveillance tape caught him: Buzz cut.Aviators.Left the cash in the cash drawer.Odd detail.Before he left, everyone dead, he holstered the pistol.Stopped at the sink.Washed his hands.Buzz cut.Aviators.Fondness for firearms.This must be Mr Pilot.Retracing our steps.Bus fare option doesnt seem like an option anymore.I fold the paper up, slide it under the chair.You know, you could stay here again tonight.A few more nights.Ive got plenty of sweatshirts.She yawns.Stretches out on the leather.Leather squeaks.I just might.Turns her head.Freshly showered hair.Might even learn how to sleep with the door unlocked.If youre lucky.Well, youre welcome to.Stay, I mean.I gotta ask you again.Why are you being so nice to me?Everyones got to be nice to someone, right?I get up.Pretend Im tidying the kitchen.Try to plot plan B.  She turns back to Sports.Then stops.Sits up.Stares me down.My father sent you.Didnt he?I stand like a dummy.With a dishcloth.Who?You know who.T.  K.  Harrow.Man of God.Im not religious.Dont fuck with me.He sent you.Its the only way this makes sense.Im no good at lying.Same as acting.Yes.He sent me.To find you.(Technically true. )And do what with me?Keep you safe.(Less true.Much less true. )Bring me back?Something like that.She sits up straight.Picks up the bowie knife in its sheath from the coffee table.Turns it in her fingers.Well, let me tell you about how things work in my family, just so you know what kind of people youre working for.I stopped in on my uncle.In Brooklyn.For help?You know what he did for me?(More acting.I hate this. )No.Set me up on a blind date.A double date.With two rapists.Or white slavers.Sex trade assholes.Who the fuck knows?Sounds like a charmer.Lucky for me, the only place they didnt want to stick their grubby hands was in my boot.She pulls the blade from the stained sheath.Last I saw them, they were bleeding in a van in Red Hook.I affect a shrug.Hapless Mitch all over again.Sounds like they got better than they deserve.She inspects the blade.Does come in handy.Sheaths it.As for my father.The great T.  K.  Harrow?Leader of men?Pastor of sheep?Instrument of God?Pulls the blade out again.Youve probably seen him on TV, right?Dont watch TV.Thats okay.Hes got bigger plans than that.Do you know what youve gotten yourself into?Do you have any idea what kind of man my father is?Im starting to get some idea.No.I dont think you do.Sheaths the blade.But if youre on his payroll, you should know.Puts the sheath down.Hes my father.Pulls her knees up.Hugs them hard.Yes.I know.I know hes your father.No.You heard me wrong.Hugs them harder.Arms round her knees.Arms round her baby.I said, hes the father.Hes the father.Thats what I said.11.I worked as a garbageman for ten years, more or less.Lost my father, my union card, and my marbles, in roughly that order.Father went first.Died of a heart attack he worked a lifetime to earn.Strict regimen of smoking, bacon, and television.Man loved his Jets.Claimed they were Jerseys team.Forty five millionaires in green helmets somewhere, carrying his heart into battle every week.He didnt die on the job, thank God, stink of other peoples garbage in his nose, not that he would have cared.When people asked his line of work, he never faltered.It was a good union wage and he wanted the same for me.My first day, he took me out to the truck yard, pulled the gloves on, drew a deep breath.Smell that?Thats security, son.He was felled too young, in his own backyard.The plot of ground hed bought by hauling other peoples trash.Barely room enough to fall down.My mother sat on his chest, pumping, wailing, waiting for an ambulance that came ten minutes too late.Two streets with the same name.One avenue, one lane.They picked wrong.My mother tried.She was a nurse.Not the kind that fix feed tubes to rich people either.By then Id married my Stella.A Jersey girl, she swore never to live in Jersey by choice.I said Queens.She said Manhattan.We split the difference and ended up in Brooklyn.Carroll Gardens.South, down by the expressway.The part thats not so gardeny.My parents wanted to see a family.We were trying, but we werent in a rush.We tried long enough to worry something might be wrong, but then we decided to stop worrying.We were young.My Stella wanted to be an actress.She rode the train to Times Square every day.Acting class in a shabby studio.Half my union wage.I rode a route up through brownstone Brooklyn.Nicer neighborhood than we could afford.Nicer garbage too.Boys on my truck gave us a nickname for a joke.Not garbagemen.Trash valets.Its hokey but its true.You learn things hauling trash.Lesson one.Dont buy cheap bags.They always tear.If not in your hands, then in mine.No discount bag ever went to its grave without being loudly cursed along the way.Lesson two.There is nothing, and no one, that you will become attached to in this life that you will not one day discard.Or they discard you.Or you die.Those are the only three outcomes.A bartender I know once quoted me a poem, by a guy named Idol or something similar.Every human being whos ever lived has died, except the living.Lesson three.Youll leave a trail of trash on this Earth that will far exceed anything of worth you leave behind.For every ounce of heirloom, you leave a ton of landfill.Thats not a poet.Thats me.What can I say?Sometimes youre on the toilet and youve already read all the magazines.Inspiration hits.But thats the lesson.Your real legacy will be buried in a dump somewhere.And the richer you are, the more trash you leave behind.After the first attacks, the ones on 9/11, so they tell me, they took the rubble of the towers to a landfill.Fresh Kills.Sifted through it, searching for bodies.Bits of bodies.Bits of bits.Did their best and found what they could and left the rest of it there, buried.True story.Landfill became a graveyard.The landfill doesnt care.Never more than a whisper of difference between them to begin with.Every garbageman has funny stories of stuff hes found on the job, of course.False teeth, brand new flatscreen still in the box, a fake leg, a stuffed ferret.A double ended dildo switches on, leaps out of the bag, twisting like an electric eel.Stuff like that.People dont know what to do with something, they toss it in the trash.Brush off their hands.Expect it to disappear.Like magic.Every garbageman has a funny story like that.Heres mine.We ran a route that looped past the crane yards by Columbia Street.Not six blocks from Long Island Hospital.We were done for the day and doubling back.I was on the rear, riding shotgun.Like Im security on a Wells Fargo stagecoach.We roll past three bags, dropped in a vacant lot.Look like dim sum dumplings sitting there.Illegally dumped.People miss their day so they hump their trash down the block.Cant stand the stink in the kitchen.Commonplace.These jokers couldnt even be bothered to drag the bags to the dumpster, maybe twenty yards away.Property of a private disposal company.Company name stenciled on the dumpster.SPADEMAN.Bags in the dumpster are not our problem.These three bags.Our problem.Technically our shifts done.Plus no ones watching.Still, I slap the side of the truck twice.Driver stops.Figure, our job is to keep the city looking nice.Im a new neighbor here.Lets make it look nice.Pick one bag up, swing it overhead like a hammer toss.For a laugh.Fling it in.Second bag, swing it sidearm like Davids slingshot, sighting Goliath.Bullseye.Third bag.Lift the bag.Funny heft.Lower it.Slowly.Though the Gods honest truth is that I never would have opened it if I hadnt heard the gurgle.They must have chickened out.Thought the plastic bag would finish it.Cheap bags.Always tear.I carried a box cutter to slash problem trash.Unbroken boxes, tangled twine.Shit like that.Popped the blade up.Sliced the bag as carefully as I could.Like surgery.Peeled the bag back.Baby still breathing, barely.Thats my funny story.First and last time I ever held a baby in my arms.Not six blocks from Long Island Hospital.They could have left the baby on the front door, rung the bell, run.Instead, vacant lot became a landfill.Became a graveyard.So they hoped.Six blocks.So I took the trip they couldnt be bothered to take.In some other version of the story, I adopted the baby.Named it.Raised it with my wife as our own.Told it the story, when it was old enough, of Baby Moses, left in the bulrushes, the one I learned in church as a kid.This isnt that story.I left the baby at the hospital.With a nurse.Answered a few questions.Signed a few forms.Went home to my wife.Didnt check back.Didnt want to know.And didnt tell my Stella until she read about it the next day in the Post.Saw another item in the Post a few days later.BAG BABY BURIAL.Buried deep inside the paper.Not even front page news.They needed a scandal.Baby left in a garbage bag?Story like that demands a villain.Someone to wear the black hat.No one knew who left it.So that left me.Post said I found it.Dumped it at the ER.Didnt do enough.Didnt even stick around to see if it would be okay.I took a six month leave.Union mandated.Half pay.Weekly psychiatric consultations.Daily visits to the bar.Nightly nightmares.Then the mayor finally busted the union.I tore up my card and cancelled my next visit to the shrink.And I went back to work.Someones got to pay for all those acting lessons.Even my Stella didnt understand.Not really.She let it be.But I could tell.Guys on the job too.Even the guys on my truck.Guys who were there.Figured at the very least you stay.Cheer that baby back to life.Maybe theyre right.Truth is, I wasnt going to sit in a waiting room so a nurse could tell me that the baby I just found in a garbage bag died.I peeled that bag open so carefully it was like I was delivering my own baby.So scared of what I would find inside.I couldnt do that twice.Wait for news.Wait to know.Sit there.Hunched over.Waiting.Clutching my garbageman gloves.In the waiting room.With all the other expectant dads.12.Pass me not O gentle Savior, Hear my humble cry.Whilst on others thou art calling, Do not pass me by.Street corner church service.Soap box preacher.Big crowd.More popular in these end times.Persephones news put me back on my heels.I dont like to be back on my heels.First response, usually, is extend my box cutter, find someone to apply it to.But that will not help in this situation.Much.What I need is information.So I call my newspaper buddy.Rockwell.The one who says Im always burying the lede.I leave Persephone at the apartment, tell her dont open the door for anyone, no matter what.Then I meet Rockwell at a bar on Washington.Main artery in the proud heart of Hoboken.This bar opens early on Sunday.Most do.Its not crowded inside, but its not empty either.A different kind of communion.Bartenders the owner.My poet quoting friend, Sebastian, from the Dominican.Named for the saint.So he says.Sets us up with two shots.Rockwell used to work for the Times, then he got fired.Turns out he has a lying problem, at work and in life.He once told me hes a descendant of the great American painter.Luckily I dont care much either way.Now he publishes his own paper.The Rockwell Report.Conspiracies and cover ups.Hes the sole reporter.You can pick it up on any street corner.Literally.From a big pile.He leaves them there.For free.Also runs a website, of course, on the old fashioned Internet.But he likes the feel of paper, the stink of ink, so he says.Salvaged two copy machines from a bombed out Staples near Times Square.Ran the Geiger counter over them.Only clicked a little bit, he claims.Plus he wears horn rims.So at least he looks like a reporter.Tell me about T.  K.  Harrow.What do you want to know that you dont already know?Just empty the file.Okay.Well, he runs that big church down South that sounds like a country singer.Hope Baptist.Hallelujah Hall.Something like that.Wait.Crystal Corral.Thats it.So theres that.What else?The TV.Thats where it all started.And its lucrative.That many people still watch TV?Sure.You should get out of the city more often, youd be surprised how many rabbit ears you still see.Not everyones ready to jam an IV tube in their arm every time they want to escape, you know?Plus TVs basically freeat least, besides the money you send to your favorite evangelist in a little white envelope every week.Which adds up.I guess so.As for political clout, Harrow runs a weekly Washington prayer breakfast thats attended by, like, twelve senators and forty members of the House.So theres that.He more or less got our current president elected, first genuine fire and brimstone Bible thumper in the White House.So theres that.And then hes got this new thing.Paved With Gold.This is good.This is useful.This is enough to buy Rockwell another round.Sebastian sets them down.Paved With Gold.Whats that?Its this limnosphere thing.Signs up converts.Promises them heaven right now, here on Earth.Why wait, thats the pitch.Gold mansions.Endless happiness.Harp playing fucking angels.All that stuff.Paved With Gold.You know, like the streets of Glory.I thought the road to hell was paved with gold.No.Thats good intentions.But how do people afford it?A bed alone is a fortune.Not to mention monthly tap in fees, feed bags Harrow subsidizes.Hes got a camp somewhere down South.Rows and rows of beds.So they say.Limited space, so he can only accept the elect.How he chooses, God only knows.Its his earthly mission, he claims.Reason God put him here.Deliver his people from the torments of this bodily world.Rockwell empties shot two.For him, two shots is just the stretching before the marathon.So how big is his ministry?How big?The biggest.When you can convince half the US government to get up at dawn to listen to you tell them what fucked up sinners they are, thats pretty big.I dont know much about this fake heaven of his, but hes already amassed enough gold here on Earth to pave plenty of streets.Plus the political pull.Hes got the presidents ear.All that stuff.The only ripples on his pond I ever heard about are his kids.He has trouble with his daughters.So I hear.The oldest one supposedly went AWOL.Cant remember her name.Grace something.Chastity.Rockwell gives me a look.Now why in the world would you know that?Lucky guess.Figure its got to be one of those virtues.You know.Constance.Charity.Funny.Those are his other daughters.So whyd she run?Who knows with kids these days?Broke her curfew?Daddy wouldnt let her go to prom?Probably got knocked up by her boyfriend and decided to find some sugar daddy, try out the trailer life for a little while.No doubt shell be back knocking at heavens gates soon enough.So where do I find him?The South?Seriously.I think the main Paved With Gold camp is in a Carolina.North or Southcant remember which.Same with the Crystal Corral, the church you see on TV.But hes got satellite churches everywhere.Theres even one in Times Square, or used to be.If youre looking to convert.I just want to talk to him.About a job.Well, if youd like to meet the man in the flesh, you dont have to wait too long.Hes headed here, to the city.I figured thats why you were asking.What for?Big crusade.Madison Square Garden.Hes even paying to get it cleaned up.Initiative with the mayor.You know, I hear the place is more lovely since the roof caved in.Supposedly you look up, you see stars.And if it rains?Fuck if I know.Tarps?When is it?This crusade?Dude, youve really got to get yourself a computer.Downs his third.I follow suit.So this Harrow.Does he employ muscle?Everyone employs muscle, Spademan.You dont.No.But I have you.Rockwell pulls out a notepad.Starts riffling pages.I do know of this one guy who works for Harrow.Supposedly a very scary dude.I know the one you mean.Southern guy.Call him Pilot.Wears aviators.Big on hand washing.No, thats not him.This guys black.Bearded.Name of Simon, I think.Keeps riffling.Then stashes it.Must be in my other notebook.Were both on empty, so I signal Sebastian.Set us up again.The dread pre noon nightcap.Bars cleared out a bit.Brief lull between the first thing in the a. m.  crowd and the afternoon ennui rush.Ennui.Thats Rockwells word.Claims its French.Just two good buddies on the Lords day, enjoying a Sabbath drink.Bellied up to the bar.Backs to the door.Pilot walks in.Picks wrong.Broken horn rims skid in the spatter.Rockwells forehead hits the bar.Exit wound swallows the shot glass.I drop.Sebastian grabs the sawed off he stores by the Bushmills.The shotgun speaks.Barroom.I roll.Sebastian martyred by bullets, not arrows, this time.I scamper to the mens room to solemnly reconsider my predilection for box cutters.Predilection.Another Rockwell word.Lock the door.Mens room looks out over an alleyway.Lucky.By the time Pilot puts two new peepholes in the locked door with his revolver, Im down the alley, cut right, right again, circle back to the bars entrance.Score one for the local boy.Still.Box cutter.I peek in the open door.Carefully.Bars dark.Pilot comes back from the mens room.Aviators look left.Right.Reflect emptiness.Walks back behind the bar.Steps over broken bottles.Over Sebastian.Stows his revolver in a shoulder holster.Stops at the sink.Washes his hands.Half a block away, two patrolmen watch the action like Heckle and Jeckle on a wire.Jerseys Finest.Like most cops, like the whole of the NYPD, theyre cash strapped and half privatized now, their salaries buoyed by moneyed interests with the city crying poor.So their main job is to stand watch and make sure the dreamers on the upper floors arent disturbed.As for us carcasses down here, down in the grimy urban mosh pit, they dont much care what we do to each other.I approach.Youve got shots fired at that bar on the corner.We heard.Called it in.Waiting on backup.I eye the pistol on one cops belt.His hand instinctively hovers.I reach in my pocket.Pull out my slush fund.Peel off a thousand cash.Then another.Hoping Ive guessed his caliber.Mind if I rent your firearm?Id like to make a citizens arrest.
