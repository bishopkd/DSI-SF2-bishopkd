When I was a lad, sitting on a pew not much more comfortable than this one, in a church pretty much just like this, the most terrifying thing to me in the whole wide world was not death, or the wages of wickedness, or the wrath of the Almighty Lord.It was the stares of Miss Savonarola.Harrow chuckles at the memory.She was our church organist.Tiny woman.Would sit at the electronic organ, right up there.He points a crooked finger toward the altar.She sat facing the congregation.Her eyes could just barely peer over the top of the organ.Yet I remember those eyes like twin glowing moons, hanging low on the horizon.And the funny thing about Miss Savonarola was that, before the service, she was your favorite person in the world.Shed greet you at the door and slip you sweets from her dress pocket, make you promise not to tell your folks.But during the service, let me tell you.She changed.You could hide in the back row, crouched out of sight, bury your toy in your lap, didnt matter.You got up to mischief while the pastor was preaching, she saw.Shed find you after the service and whap!Rap your wrists with a switch right in front of your parents.Wouldnt even say why, to you or to them.But she knew.And she knew you knew.And I will tell you, Mr Spademan.I am respectful and awed by my Lord in His heaven, but I dont think anyones ever kept me in line better than she did.She taught me a few things, Ill tell you that.I can imagine.I understand youre not much one for this spectral world, am I correct?Thats right.Have you ever been off body before?Long ago.Gave it up.I understand.As with any dream, a lot depends upon the dreamer.Well, youve seen a little of what my dream looks like.But let me lay it out for you.I want to lead my followers here, to this world, a refuge of simplicity and peace.A sanctuary of my own devising.He sweeps his hand over the church.Through the windows, sunlight sneaks in, pools in the corners, keeps to itself.You know whats become of the world back there, Mr Spademan.You better than anyone.It is not a place to waste your days.How you live in that poisoned swamp of New York City, I will never understand.Not when you could live here.Like this.Mr Harrow, I get that.I do.But why do people need to sign on to your dream?People should dream how they like.Because I offer them something better.More than the dream.I offer them a new life, Mr Spademan.A life after life.With no wait list.Something remarkable.That is what I wanted to show you.Do you have time for a short demonstration?Sure.Harrow gestures to someone unseen.Two girls walk in through a side door.Identical twins, short hair, bright eyes.Persephones age or a few years younger.Dressed in matching pinafore smocks.Prairie style.They stand before us, shoulder to shoulder, like soldiers awaiting inspection.This is Mary and Magdalene.Go ahead, Mr Spademan.I want you to stroke Marys cheek.Shes the one on the right.Dont worry.She wont bite.I reach my hand out and pass my knuckles lightly over her downy cheek.Soft.She giggles.Very good.And now Magdalene.Same thing.Knuckles grazing.On this pass, though, I get a little charge.The first cheek was like experiencing the memory of something.Like a reminder of a feeling you once had.The second one is like feeling it for the first time.I settle back into the pew.What do you think, Mr Spademan?As real as real.And that is my proprietary technology.You cant get that in any other dream.He dismisses the twins.They curtsy and exit, like its the end of a school pageant.Im still rubbing my hand.Thats very convincing.That it is.So whats the secret?Just that.A secret.Well Im sure it will prove very lucrative.Wait.Theres one more person I want you to meet.He stands.You might want to stand up for this.I stand.And in she walks.My Stella.17.My wife.In the same dress I last saw her in.She smiles.That smile.Brown hair in a bob.That bob I begged her not to get.Looks good on her though.I grasp Harrows arm.For balance.He gives me the satisfied look of a salesman whos just unveiled the luxury model.I assure you, its perfectly safe.Its not the real, no.But its as real as real.I look at her.Her.Here.Brown eyes a little too close together.Front teeth a little too far apart.That smile thats spring loaded to burst into a laugh.In other words, perfect.Dont be shy, Mr Spademan.Please give your wife a kiss.This is a place of sanctuary.And I promise to avert my eyes.I turn to Harrow.Shut it off.Dont be afraid.No.This isnt real.I think youll find, Mr Spademan, that those kinds of distinctions quickly become immaterial.I turn back to her.Trembling.Tell myself its not real.Its not real.Its not real.Its not real.As I say this I take her face in my hands.Feel her face.Hesitate.Kiss her.Like a man drawing breath after years underwater.I pull away.I whisper.Im sorry.Harrow lays a gentle hand on my back.You understand now?What I am offering?My Stella smiles.Her hand trails my face.Dont worry, Mr Spademan.She will always be here.And I can arrange for you to see her whenever you like.In total privacy.Frankly, if you choose, you can leave that toxic world behind and relocate here, if thats what pleases you.You wont be the first.I know youre familiar with my farm.I can reunite you and your wife and I guarantee, after a time, you wont remember that you ever werent together.So this is what youre offering?Yes.And Im guessing youll want something in return.Only something that is already mine.Sounds fair.Just one question.Anything.Not for you.For her.I turn back to face my Stella.Her look says she longs for me.I choke back something.Then say it.Whats my name?She smiles.Spademan.I smile back.No, its not.She looks confused.Says it again.Spademan.I turn back to Harrow.I want out.He waves her away.The sales pitch gone sour.She retreats out the side door.I cant help but watch her.The door closing behind her.Just like that last morning.Then shes gone.I lean on the pew.Struggle to get my balance.Fail.Look at Harrow.Tap me out.Mr Spademan Now.I know it can be very overwhelming.It reminds me a bit of that first moment after baptism.When people come up again out of the water.Gasping for air, fighting for balance.But new.Brand new.Like newborns.Come into a new life.But its not real.No.But after awhile, I assure you, that hardly matters.I want out.He grasps my shoulders to stand me up.Steadies me.All right.But first, let me tell you what I want.His smile exiled.I want my daughter back.I dont know where she is.He laughs.Lying is not an effective tactic in this world.Not with me.And you should be wary of breaking commandments.Here, of all places, in the Lords house.We certainly dont want to start down that road.What road?Breaking things.I cant do it.She is of no consequence to you.Doesnt matter.Mr Spademan, do you understand what Im offering you?Yes.And why exactly are you protecting my daughter?I dont know.Do you even know why my daughter ran away?I have some idea.Do you?Well, let me fill in the blanks.Harrow retreats to the pulpit and pulls down the massive leather bound Bible.He opens it and flips onionskin pages.I wipe my mouth, still unsteady.Sit.Im not in the mood for a parable, Mr Harrow.He looks up.Thats not what this is.He turns the book around.Upends it, cradling it in his arms, held toward me.Like its story time.On one page, the usual march of verses under a single illuminated letter, painstakingly painted.On the other page, a large photo of Persephone naked.This is my daughter, Grace Chastity.Whom I raised from an infant, as you know.Whose diapers I changed.Whose blankets I tucked in.Whose cries in the night I comforted.He flips the page.More Grace Chastity.More naked.Girls grow up.I understand that.And mine did too.All of them.Especially Grace.He flips the page.In each photo, Grace is smiling, posing, puckering her lips.In most photos theres a starburst of a cameraphone flash.In each one she is exposed.In some more exposed than others.My Grace found a boyfriend, as little girls do.They break their fathers hearts eventually.But I caught my Grace sending these pictures to her boyfriend.Shaming herself.Before him.Before me.Before God.Flips the page again.A homemade porn mag, starring his daughter.In the next shot, shes on a bed, legs spread.Fingers finding their way inside her.So you can imagine, Mr Spademan, that when I found these I was very cross.Very cross indeed.Flip.Next photo.Shot from behind.Displaying a gymnasts agility.Among other things.You dont have a daughter, do you?No.But you can understand how this might make you feel.Sure.But shes eighteen.Shes free to live her own life.Should be, anyway.Well, she wasnt eighteen when she took these, Mr Spademan.She was sixteen.And she promised me shed stop.More recently, she broke that promise to me.Again.Flip.Young Grace Chastity explores sex toys.Makes them disappear.Do you know how I found these?A parishioner.A member of my own congregation.He came to me and told me his son had brought them to him.Theyd been circulating.At his school.He closes the book.Mercifully.So I forbid her from seeing her boyfriend.Forbid her from having a phone.I forbid her from doing just about anything I could think of.And naturally, as young girls do, when the devil has their ear, she ran away.He replaces the book on the altar.Youll forgive the dramatics of my presentation.I just want to make sure you understand why I want her home.Whatever shes done to break my heart, break my rules, to humiliate me in public, to taint my congregation and flout Gods commandments, I know she will be safer with me, in my care, than rambling around out there, living hand to mouth, in the gutters of New York.So I want my daughter back.Youve already seen what I can offer in return.You know shes pregnant.Yes.Another souvenir of the boyfriend.A worthless sort.Thats not what she told me.What are you suggesting, Mr Spademan?That the father is right here in this church.Really?An immaculate conception, then?Not exactly.Harrow clutches the sides of the pulpit.Enters full on preacher mode.His cadence sounds something like Mark Ray, but soulless.The stern father, not the kind shepherd, sowing brimstone, not comfort.He starts in.For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.But ask yourself this, Mr Spademan.How pregnant is my daughter?And when exactly did she run away?Not long ago, correct?A few weeks, maybe?Why, we only just contacted you last week.Hes right.He goes on.So in your version of the story, this foul act was committed, and shewhat?Lived under my roof for another few months?And then suddenly one day woke up and decided to flee?Does that make much sense to you?Hes right again.It doesnt.He goes on.Well, let me provide you with an alternate version.In an act of brash but not uncharacteristic youthful rebellion, prompted by my admittedly severe punishments for her extremely humiliating acts of licentiousness, she had a foolish encounter with her no good boyfriend.Which she managed to hide from me.For a time.When she could no longer hide it, she ran.Which is when you contacted me.Thats correct.And now you want her back.Yes, I do.Hmmm.Well, that does make more sense, I guess.Im glad youre starting to see the whole picture, Mr Spademan.Sure.Theres only one thing I dont quite get.And youll have to forgive me.I can be a little dim sometimes.And what is that?You hired me to kill her, Mr Harrow.Not bring her home.He smiles.Someday you may know how it feels to be a father.You want to protect them, even from themselves.In any way you can.Yeah.Well.Im not buying it.But thanks.The plain fact, Mr Spademan, is that someone in my security department overstepped his authority.That individual has been reprimanded severely, as you know.I believe you received a souvenir of that disciplinary action just recently.So now you want her back.Like the Prodigal Daughter.Just like that.Something changed my mind, Mr Spademan.I saw the light, as it were.Really?What was that?I learned I had a grandchild.That altered my way of seeing things.But I wouldnt expect you would understand something like that.No.I would never harm that child.No matter his provenance.Or the circumstances of his conception.I want that child back.I want both my children back.And you wont hurt Persephone?You mean Grace?Of course not.I just want her back in my arms.Well, thats a very good sermon, Mr Harrow.And I do thank you for your time and the tour.And Im sorry.I am.But I dont think I can do that.Shes a grown woman and Im not a truant officer.I only provide one service, and if youre no longer interested in that service, we should probably just go our separate ways.Harrow steps down from the pulpit.All right.I understand.You clearly see yourself as a man of principle.I respect that.However misguided.I stand up.I want out.Now.Im tapping out.Unplug me.I know you are new to the off body experience, so let me explain how this works.This is my church.My construct.My world.You are my guest.And youll wake up when I wake you up.The light pooling in the churchs dusty corners dries up.The stained glass sunbeams snuff out.The church door creaks behind us.All the way open.Then all the way closed.I told you I learned a lesson from my dear old Miss Savonarola, yes?Do you want to know what that lesson was?I glance back over the pews.Three gentlemen approaching up the aisle.Two are huge, wear overalls, and look like farmhands who bulk up by eating other farmhands.The third is a black man.Trim build.Trim beard.Shoulders as wide as a roadblock.I look back at Harrow.What was the lesson?He smiles.First the sweets.Then the switch.18.Im not much of a brawler and this ones over in a blink.Harrows world, Harrows rules, so Im like a twelve year old fighting high school bullies in a wading pool.After a few good kidney shots, one of the farmboys gets behind me, loops his arms in under mine, kicks my knees out, and bends my arms back like butterfly wings.Pinned.I dangle.The black guy steps to center stage.Mr Spademan, hello.Pleased to meet you.They call me Simon the Magician.I am Mr Harrows head of security.Sure.Ive heard of you.Good.Im going to guess youre not a real magician.I dont do card tricks, if thats what you mean.He holds up a fist.Shows it to me.No tattoos.Just fist.Pow.Recocks.But I do have this one nifty trick that I like.Shows me the fist again.Tightens it like hes crushing coal.The skin starts to grow over the gaps between his fingers.Thumb absorbed into knuckles to make bigger knuckles.His fist reborn as a wrecking ball of bone.His world.His rules.The Magician pulls the fist back.Lets it fly.Like the plunger in a pinball machine.My heads the pinball.The left comes right after.Right left right, like a ball between bumpers.I hear ringing.Harrows delivering a sermon from the pulpit.Simon the Magician was a contemporary of Jesus.Also called Simon the Sorcerer, Simon Magus, occasionally Simon the Holy God.While Harrow goes on with the history lesson, Simons namesake lets another loose across my chin.He might be named for some magician, but like Samson, hes got a thing for jawbones.Harrow preaches.Simon the Magician was a miracle worker.He was considered the most powerful holy man in Samaria.Some thought him a deity.That is, until Jesus came along.Simon stands over me, legs spread in a fighting stance.Fists hover like bees outside a hive, looking for the way in.Hes not much for words but he puts his two cents in.Simon says: When I heard about him, I took to him immediately.Right cross.Simon says: I like to think of him as the alternative Jesus.Left cross.Simon says: You know.Black Jesus.Right cross.Ah, the old rugged cross.Harrow bangs on the pulpit with the flat of his hand.And do you know what Simon the Magician did, Mr Spademan, once he was upstaged by the one true Lord?I wonder if Im expected to answer.I was always taught not to talk with my mouth full of teeth.Harrow plows on.He converted.Followed Jesus.A convert, Mr Spademan.A smart man.Farmboy lets me drop like a feed sack.I cough.Dribble blood.You made your point.Wake me up.I cant do that, Mr Spademan.As real as real, am I right?Harrow steps down from the pulpit.Toes me with a work boot.I spit on the boot.Blood colored polish.Spit shine.You may as well put your suit back on, Harrow.Im guessing the country charmer portion of the program is over.The pity is, Mr Spademan, that we cant kill you in here.You cant die.Its not possible.Most times that seems like an inconvenient impediment.But sometimes it proves surprisingly useful.Simon stomps my head.Im really starting to hate this magic act.Mr Spademan, when I say we can do this all day, I really do mean it.All day.All night.A whole lifetime.Simon stomps my head.I spit up.Harrow, I came here in good faith.Harrow laughs.Now what would you presume to tell me about faith, good or otherwise?Simon stomps my head.Skulls werent made for this.Harrow stands over me, supervising like a pit boss watching a card sharp get his comeuppance.I want my daughter back.Knock at the church door.Some minutes later.Not sure how many.Several stomps worth, at least.Harrow looks at Simon.Simon looks at Farmboy Number One.Who looks at Farmboy Number Two.Who walks over and answers the door.Enter Mark Ray.I look up from the wide plank floor.Taste of plank in my mouth.Marks in some kind of getup.It all matches his blond curls nicely.White robe.Sandals.Gold braid belt.Hurlbat.Sorry to interrupt.Did I miss the sermon?A hurlbat looks like an ax but with two blades, set in opposite directions, one east, one west.Mark grips it and twirls it loosely in a batting stance, like a slugger waiting on deck.Farmboy Number One watches mutely.So he gives Farmboy Number One a closer look.Farmboy falls.Mark pries the hurlbat free from the farmboys face.It takes a couple of good jimmies to pry loose.Ax free, Mark walks up the aisle.Since were telling religious stories, Ive got a good one.Saint Fidelis.Heard of him?German saint.Philosopher.Friar.Wore a hair shirt.You ever worn a hair shirt?Anyone?Farmboy Number Two shrugs.Harrow and Simon stand silent, sizing Mark up.Simons fists turn back into hands.He spreads his fingers, cracks newfound knuckles.Mark continues.Its no fun, Ill you that.A hair shirt I mean.Not recommended.Do you know the hairs on the inside?Anyway.Saint Fidelis.Scourge of heretics.Known to carry And here he bows and presents his weapon to each man like a jester proudly showing off his scepter.a hurlbat.Then Mark stands.Shakes his shoulders out.Regrips.Crouches once, a quick low bounce in the knees, then sticks the ax into the middle of Farmboy Number Two.Timber.Id give him a standing ovation if I could stand.Harrow steps forward.And who are you?Im just here to pick up my friend.Were having a word with him.So I see.Dont worry.Im not here to stop the hurting.Im just here to spread it around a little bit.He takes a quick step left and hacks toward Simon, who feints, snatches the handle, twists, and wrests it free.Mark empty handed.Harrow smiles.All right.Now we can talk like civilized folk.May I ask, and I apologize if this sounds somewhat silly given the situation, but how the devil did you manage to get in here?Funny you should mention that.I know a devil.From Chinatown.Names Rick.Well.Thats all very interesting, Mr Uriel.Apparently Marks got a nickname.Mr Uriel.But this is still my construct.Yes?My church.My rules.Thats true.More or less.So Im afraid Im going to have to ask you to leave.Harrow gestures to Simon, who steps up, ax held high.Ready to swing low.Marks robe ripples in the back.Rips.Marks flesh ripples in the back.Rips.Mark lurches forward.Marks a hunchback.Then an angel.Wings unfurl.Ax meets air.Marks foot meets Simons forehead.Hard.From on high.Marks airborne.He laughs.Turns his sandal into a steel toe boot.Kicks Simon again.Harder.For unto you is given this day a boot to the head.Simon staggers.Harrow waves his hand.All right.Enough.He toes me.Simon, tap out Mr Spademan.Harrow looks up at Mark, who hovers, feathered wings trembling.I imagine you can find your own way out.19.Im awake.In a bed.In a cathedral.Not a cathedral.A bank.An angel hovers over me.Not an angel.A nurse.Behind her, Mr Milgram.He of the note.The nurse cradles my face.Be still.Let the painkillers work.My jaw and skull throb.Nothing broken but a very convincing facsimile.Pain.Killers.Two things Ive been spending way too much time with recently.Were in the financial district, the old Wall Street, where I came to meet Milgram, a neighborhood where abandoned banks abound.This ones got vaulted ceilings, like a burial vault, built for kings.Paintings on the ceiling.Angels touching men.Milgram hands me a card.Mr Harrow would like you to know his offer still stands.Milgrams a fussy type.Buttoned down.Looks like hed enjoy the back room at the Bait & Switch.Though Im not sure which end of the whip hed prefer.I take the card.One question.Yes?Why hire me if youd already sent Pilot?Mr Pilots job wasnt to kill her.That was your job.Mr Pilots job was to kill you.So, as you can see, this has been a real cavalcade of incompetence.But rest assured, we plan to set it right.I stash the card.Dont expect a call.He tries to grin, cant quite make it past a wince.Well, I suspect youll be hearing from us either way.I stop outside on the stone steps of the bank.Sit on the steps.Catch my breath.Run a palm over the cold pebbled stone, squinting at the street, which is all edges and angles and light.Its early morning.New day still has that new day smell.Sunlight scrubs away whats left of last night.Tries to, anyway.I dont go off body often and havent in a long while.Its been long enough that I forgot about this part.Bed resters call it the wake up call.A painful sensitivity when the simulations over and you first come out of it and your senses all come back online.When youre back to using your actual organs, your eyes and ears and nose and nerves all open for business again.Light searing your optic nerves.Odors numbing your nose.Sound galloping across your eardrums.The wake up call.Its painful.Everything seems too real for a time.The too sharp edges of the actual world.20.I collect myself and take the 2 train north toward Trump Tower.There are so few passengers at this hour they only run four cars to a train.And theres no such thing as express anymore.Everythings local.Making all stops.Except Times Square.We rattle through without braking.Times Square sealed off like a crypt.The first explosion was small, on the subway, a diversion.Gym bag in the first car of a Manhattan bound train.Intended to draw first responders down into the tunnel.Ambulance, EMS, fire crews, which it did.Then came the second explosion.The dirty bomb in Times Square went off about an hour after that.Chaos opened the door to chaos.Like a burglar sneaking in a side window, then unlocking the front door for his friends.It was midmorning, Monday, holiday season.Just starting to get cold.I remember theyd lit the big tree the week before.Local weatherman flipped the switch.My Stella always liked to go into Manhattan to see the Christmas windows.She didnt mind braving the holiday crush, standing twenty deep in a spillover crowd.She had a taste for magic.Silver snowflakes and mechanical elves, shilling name brand gifts.Santas helpers, doing the robot, that was always my joke.She used to talk about us renting a little flat in the Village.Nothing fancy, but on a pretty street.With trees.The city had a pull on her that I didnt share.But shed read all the romantic memoirs.The ones about a city rich with artists and poets and dreamers, the old fashioned kind.
