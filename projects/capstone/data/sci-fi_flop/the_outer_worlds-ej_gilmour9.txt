The average temperature is far below freezing and gravity is 1.06.The planet has a dark side which never faces the star.The light side, which should have been called the twilight side, has about ten major towns which are operated by different groups, mostly criminal.The best thing about the planet is its atmosphere, which is prime grade, as it was developed by the Epherian Empire about fifteen hundred years ago.The Epherians left behind giant automated atmospheric generators which are powered by the planets molten core; they continue to regulate the atmosphere and are closely guarded by every invested party.Nothing grows on Bodach Delta, apart from some varieties of moss which are adapted to the extreme cold.The people live entirely on synthesized food.The towns and bases are also powered by thermal energy from the planets core.It doesnt look like a nice place to be stranded.At least not without a good coat, she said with a smile.Lets just hope these Tunnel Makers have a way of helping us cross the Epherian frontier.**  Sara navigated the ship through the upper atmosphere of Bodach Delta.The Out Drifter glided through the thick clouds and into the darker regions below.Michael watched a mountain range appear on the horizon.The mountains were completely covered in ice and snow.Ethan was standing behind them and watching through the viewing panel.See the line of mountains in the distance; those that look like jagged spines.The Tunnel Maker base is at the northern side of that range.I expect they have some security measures in place, said Sara.They do; plasma cannons, lasers, heavy duty missile launchers and nuclear weapons if they need them.The base is also protected by an electronic and electromagnetic shield.Their watchmen will contact us when we pass their outlying sensors.Let me do the talking.Sara guided the ship along the edge of the mountain range.The external com lit up.A heated voice could be heard through the com.Who are you and what do you want?...This is Ethan Faraway.Im a Tunnel Maker requesting a landing dock.A few moments passed without anything being said.Ethan Faraway, youre the mechanical engineer who went missing years ago  Thats right; Im back.Tyr will want to have a word with you  Why would Tyr want to talk with me?asked Ethan cautiously.Hes the new boss of the Tunnel Makers  What about Vlad?Vlad died last year and Tyr won the vote to replace him  A shadow passed over Ethans face.Do we have permission to land?Dock thirteen.Follow the navigation signal  You got it.The external com light flickered off.Ethan lowered his eyes and appeared to be in a state of shock.Whats the problem?asked Michael.Tyr is not an easy man to deal with.I thought we would be dealing with Vlad.This could complicate things.Why?asked Sara.I once worked on Tyrs cargo ship.We never liked each other.Dont worry.The worst thing that can happen is they will refuse to help us, said Michael.Tyr is a madman.There are much worse things he can do than not helping us.Hes unpredictable.Im not sure if it is safe to deal with him.Maybe we should change the plan.They wont hurt us because we belong to the Outer World Salvage Guild, said Sara.They wont want our guild offside.I hope you are right, said Ethan.**  The Out Drifter entered the deep valley where the old mining town was situated.The town consisted of a flattened area of concrete landing docks to the north and a group of old hardy residential buildings on the south side of the valley.There was a large armour plated door at the base of the mountain, and there were various plasma turrets and defence mechanisms surrounding the entrance to the base and many larger turret guns at various locations around the valley.Sara guided the ship down to the dock thirteen, which was covered by a thin layer of ice.The Out Drifter gently landed on the concrete platform.You will have to put on our weather coats.Its freezing outside, said Sara.Be ready to leave in a hurry, said Michael.Im always ready, she said confidently.Michael stood up and walked to the cargo bay, where Ajax was gathering his weapons.Acacius was waiting beside the exit door and wearing a thermal regulator coat.Cynthia, Ethan and Ivan were standing with him.We dont want to scare them into a fight, Ajax.I think you should leave your rifle and grenades behind.No, Cap, I think I should take all my weapons, just in case, said Ajax.The last thing we need is a gunfight with smugglers.Just take a pistol.If you insist, grumbled Ajax.You should put a coat on, Cynthia, said Michael.Its cold outside and there is an icy wind blowing over the mountains.You wont make it to their front door without a thermal coat.Yes, Emperor, she replied with a coy smile.Michael returned the smile, but he didnt say a word.They put on thermal weather coats, and Ethan opened the exit door.A blast of frozen air hit them.Ethan led the way out and across the docks.They followed him through the piercing cold and across the rocky ground to the base front door.The double reinforced security door opened as they approached and revealed a large tunnel which cut directly into the mountainside.About twenty yards further was a second security door.Four smugglers with plasma rifles were standing ready and two heavily armed battle droids were positioned a little further back.The droids stood about ten feet in height and were armed with rocket launchers and plasma machineguns attached to their shoulders.One of the guards was a large and muscular man with short jet black hair and fierce dark eyes.He grinned as they stepped in out of the cold.Ethan!I cant believe what Im seeing.I was sure you were dead.Good to see you again!he said, holding out his huge hand for Ethan to shake.Good to see you too, Carlson.Carlson scanned the rest of the crew.His eyes lingered on Ajax, who was taller and musclier.A hint of jealously flashed across his face.Who are your friends, Ethan?This is Captain Michael Cornelius of the Out Drifter and his crew.Theyre a salvage crew and belong to the Outer World Salvage Guild.Salvors, why did you bring them here?Business of course, said Ethan.They want to be smuggled across the Epherian frontier.Do the Tunnel Makers still smuggle people into the empire?We do, but the price is very high.I hope you can afford the trip.How much does it cost?asked Michael.Thats up to Tyr, answered Carlson.He makes all the big financial decisions these days.Ethan, you can take two of your friends into the base; the others can wait on board their ship, and no one is permitted to take weapons inside.Leave your guns here and collect them as you leave.I guess its me and you, Captain.Who else should we take?asked Ethan.Ivan, youre coming with us, said Michael.Everyone else can go back to the ship.It shouldnt take long to complete the negotiations.Carlson collected their pistols and the others returned to the Out Drifter.The second door slid open and revealed a dimly lit tunnel which cut deeper into the mountainside.Carlson and another smuggler led them onward.They arrived at the far side where a third reinforced security door blocked their way.The door opened and a large domed area was revealed.At the far side of the area was an elevated podium with what looked like a throne made entirely of gold.Seated on the throne was a man clothed in black silk with a very lined face and a shiny bald head.He had a somewhat mischievous grin affixed to his lips.There were dozens of smugglers in the domed area, which seemed to be the central hub of the base.They all looked up as the newcomers entered the room.Carlson led them over to the podium, and some of the men acknowledged Ethan as they walked by.Ethan, the ugly duckling has returned, said the man on the throne with a half smile and half sneer.Hello again, Tyr, said Ethan coolly.Take off your glasses so I can see your eyes.I cant see anything without my glasses.Oh, you lost your sight, what a pity, said Tyr coldly.You know Im the leader now, Ethan, and if you still think of yourself as a Tunnel Maker you should address me as the boss.As far as I know you havent resigned yet.Let me say now: I resign from the Tunnel Makers, said Ethan loudly so everyone in the dome could hear.I always thought you were too weak to be a Tunnel Maker!growled Tyr.Im sure this isnt a courtesy visit.What do you want?We are here to do business.The corners of Tyrs lips turned upward.Tell me; what business?he asked, leaning forward in anticipation.We want our ship smuggled into the Epherian Empire.Tyr threw himself back and laughed menacingly.His laughing continued for at least half a minute.We can smuggle you across the frontier, but it will cost you eight million credits.What?Thats ridiculous!said Ethan, raising his voice.Thats the discounted price because you were a Tunnel Maker.Either you pay or you leave, and if you choose to go dont ever come back.We cant afford your price, said Michael.Then we cant do business.You can go now; get out of my sight, said Tyr, waving dismissively.Is there another way?asked Michael.I hate salvors; your kind never gives up, scoffed Tyr, snarling down at Michael with piercing eyes.Not giving up is a good quality, said Michael.Tyr sneered and gritted his teeth.Yes, it can be a good quality, but not when you are committing your energy to foolish endeavours.He scrutinized Michael for a long moment, and his eyes suddenly lit up as if he was struck by a bright idea.There is only one other way you can pay for the service.Tell us.We have had a request to smuggle some EPHX lenses to Moros Gamma.Moros Gamma, repeated Ethan.But Moros Gamma is deep inside alien controlled space.Exactly.The Morosians have requested the delivery of fourteen EPHX cannon lenses.Theyve held back an alien siege for years because they have mounted EPHX cannons on satellites protecting their planet.The cannon lenses have a limited lifespan, and they need to be replaced very soon.Moros Gamma is cut off; no trade gets in or out.All the other systems in that region have fallen to the aliens.Moros Gamma will also fall if the lenses dont arrive in time.They have agreed to pay us one billion credits if we can deliver the lenses, but unfortunately the Tunnel Maker pilots dont want to take the job.Naturally, no one wants to fly so deep into alien controlled space.All you have to do is make the delivery and bring a GCTD with the one billion credits back to us.Then we will repay you by smuggling you into the Epherian Empire.Its really simple.You know there is no way we would be able to make it as far as the Moros Gamma, said Ethan.Its utter madness.I disagree, said Michael.We will take the job.Ethan winced and shook his head.Captain, taking this job is crazy.There is no other way, said Michael.We need to cross the Epherian frontier.But we wont be crossing the Epherian frontier if we take this job, never!The aliens will kill us.The statistical probability of succeeding is exceptionally low, said Ivan.I think we can make it, said Michael.We need to know that the Tunnel Makers will keep their side of the deal.Tyr clapped and laughed.You are working for a bold captain, Ethan.I like him.His mouth twisted into a grin.If you can bring me a GCTD with a billion credits I will smuggle the whole salvage guild into the Epherian Empire for you.You have a deal.Good.I will have my men load the cargo onto your ship.FIFTEEN      What!yelled Sara.Have you lost your mind?she screamed as she stormed into the cargo bay.Men from the Tunnel Makers were loading large steel boxes containing the lenses into the cargo bay.Whats going on?asked Ajax, looking from Michael to Sara.Dont worry, Sara; we will be fine.Trust me.Trust!Captain, this job, if you can call it a job, is like trying to walk through a den full of starving lions; we will be eaten alive.I dont think we can even make it to Moros Gamma.Alien controlled space is self explanatory: it means the space is controlled by aliens!Dont be so pessimistic, said Michael with a confident smile.We have a good ship, plenty of fuel, and Ivan thinks its statistically possible.Its not pessimism, Captain, and it may be statistically possible, but the chances of success are slimvery slim.I actually said the statistical probability of succeeding is exceptionally low, said Ivan in dry monotone.Which means its actually statistically possible, argued Michael.What do you think, Acacius?The path we walk is a result of cause and effect on a cosmic scale, answered Acacius.If this is our only option then we must go to Moros Gamma.You were right to do what you did.We must find a way to Epheria Prime and we must save the Magnifier.The path has been presented to us.We will walk the path.But youre not the one who has to fly the ship, said Sara.As I have previously said; no one has to come on this mission, said Michael.Anyone who wants to leave is welcome to leave.Ill fly the ship myself if I have to.Everyone is here by choice.Sara averted her eyes and shook her head.Im not leaving, Captain, but I will definitely say when I think you are making a mistake.**  The Out Drifter lifted off and rapidly ascended toward the sky.They passed through the thick dark clouds in the upper atmosphere and within minutes they were back in space.Michael was sitting in the co pilot seat beside Sara.He watched the bright stars in the distance.No matter what I do I can never escape the aliens, she said.You know there are no aliens inside the Epherian Empire.I was hoping we would cross the border and leave the war behind, and now we are about to set a course for the most dangerous alien infested place in the galaxy.Michael nodded.You should know, Sara, the End Machine rules the Epherian Empire, and the End Machine synthesized the alien race.The machine controls the aliens and the minds of the government ministers on Epheria Prime.The real enemy is the End Machine.When we destroy the machine we will destroy the aliens.What about the Epherian Emperor?asked Sara.Nearly everyone in the Outer Worlds blames the Emperor.He sold us out to the aliens when he agreed to the Epherian Pact.Does the End Machine control the mind of the Epherian Emperor?No, said Michael.A few silent moments passed.Have you ever seen an image of the Epherian Emperor?he asked.Never.Michael looked over his shoulder and saw Cynthia standing at the door.I know what the Epherian Emperor looks like, she said boldly.Thats impossible, said Sara.He never shows his face.She continued to adjust the reactor power levels on the console.There hasnt been a circulated image of him since he was little more than a boy.You might find you know much more about the Emperor than you think you do, said Cynthia as she turned to leave and walked back toward the cargo bay.What did she mean by that?asked Sara, glancing curiously across at Michael.Im not entirely sure, he replied.I think you know more than you are prepared to say, she said, her eyes narrowing.What has the Epherian Emperor got to do with our mission to save the Magnifier?Tell me; where does the Emperor fit in?The reason the Emperor doesnt show his face in public is because he was sent into exile when the End Machine attacked Epheria Prime.Obviously you are planning to rescue him from exile.Michael smiled warmly.No, its not necessary because he is actually planning to save the Magnifier from Epheria Prime.He has a good crew and a solid ship.He just has to complete one last mission to Moros Gamma.I think hes in with a good chance.He glanced at Sara to see her reaction.Her face became stony and pale.The Out Drifter suddenly veered to the left.Michael nearly fell out of his seat as the ship spiralled out of control.Sara took a few moments to regain focus and retake control of the ship.What!she yelled, her unblinking eyes staring intensely at him.Its you, Captain.You must be joking!Im not joking, he said calmly.Why havent you ever mentioned this?There was never a need to say a word about my past, and it was dangerous to tell anyone.I have been in hiding for many years.I kept my origins secret from everyone so I could remain hidden.You have to understand that the End Machine has been searching for me since I was very young.It is only necessary to tell you now because you have agreed to help save the galaxy.I have to return to the Epheria Prime.The minds of my people have been enslaved by the End Machine.Once we destroy the End Machine I will take control of the Epherian fleet and banish the aliens from the Triangulum Galaxy forever.Sara leaned back in her seat.She lifted her eyes and stared at the ceiling.I cant believe I work for the Epherian Emperor.I hate the Epherian Emperor; everyone in the Outer Worlds hates him.Thats even more reason to keep my identity secret, and to be clear, they dont hate me; they hate the fact that the Epherian Empire hasnt helped fight the aliens.I think this will change the way I see you.Im exactly the same man you know.Sara raised an eyebrow and smiled.**  Ajax groaned as he looked down at the sleeping pod containing Gopher.We forgot to drop the thief off on Bodach Delta, he grumbled.What the hell are we going to do with him now?Michael walked over.Well have to let him out of the sleeping pod.Its not a good idea, Cap.I think we should just leave him in there and let him off on Moros Gamma.Leaving him in the middle of the war wouldnt be very nice.He wont like that.Who cares what he likes, said Ajax gruffly.We didnt ask him to come aboard in the first place.Everyone knows youre asking for trouble if you sneak aboard a ship.He admitted hes a thief.Thieves are bad news, Cap.You know from experience?Ajax lowered his eyes.I left those days behind a long time ago, but yeah, I know from experience.Acacius stepped into the room.He approached them and glanced down at Gopher.I believe this thief has a purpose.A purpose?questioned Ajax flatly.I think his purpose is to be thrown off the ship.We can still get rid of him.We dont have to aim the pod at an alien world; we could send him to a neutral world.As I said, he has a purpose, said Acacius sternly.He should remain with us.What if youre wrong?asked Ajax.Acacius stared at Ajax and didnt answer.Open the pod and let him out, Ajax, said Michael.SIXTEEN      Acacius and Michael were sitting at the table in the living room.The End Machines power is far beyond what the ancients expected.The shadow is darker than the darkest night.Your powers may not be enough to defeat the machine, even if we find the Magnifier.Is there hope?asked Michael.To understand the answer to your question we must again discuss the structure of the cosmos.You have already learned a lot, and you know how to travel between spacial dimensions and how to convert matter into energy, but you do not yet understanding of the subtleties of the universe.Im happy to learn.Indeed you are.I will tell you how the universe is structured.From a single cause arose a single point, which was the first of all things to appear in the spacial universe.The universe we experience is the result of a geometric cascade from that single point.As you know; it is obvious that a single point has little meaning by itself; it exists in relation to nothing; it is not larger or smaller, further or closer, brighter or darker than anything else.Therefore the laws underlying the cosmos gave rise to a second point, which led to the arrival of one dimensional space, which is a line between two distinct points.The distance between the two points is unknown unless there is a third point.The third point gives perspective to the first and second, thus two dimensional space arrived in the archaic universe in the shape of what we would recognise as a triangle without depth.Obviously, three dimensional space requires a fourth point.Initially three dimensional space took the shape of a tetrahedron, a three dimensional triangle, by virtue of the fact that four points are the minimum value for three dimensional space to exist.Acacius paused to take a breath before continuing.Three dimensional space is not either a cube or cylindrical as some of our ancient ancestors wrongly believed.The universe does not add points, sides and edges unless such points, sides and edges are an absolute necessity resulting from the underlying laws.As I have stated, the laws underlying the universe compel three dimensional space to arise from the previous two dimensional and one dimensional realities.This leads to an obvious conclusion: there are three additional tetrahedron spacial dimensions available beyond the primal tetrahedron universe.The reason is because the three unused two dimensional sides of the original three dimensional tetrahedron are subject to the same underlying laws which earlier caused three dimensional space to arise from the previous two dimensional reality.The three unused two dimensional sides are compelled to form their own tetrahedron spacial dimensions.The result is four spacial dimensions which oscillate side by side.Because the four tetrahedron dimensions share two dimensional sides the presence of an object in one dimension causes a gravitational effect on objects in the other three spacial dimensions; this is because every object in the universe exists in one, two and three dimensional space simultaneously.The End Machine was built to exist across the four spacial dimensions.It has power unlike any other machine.Acacius sat back in his seat.I understand the End Machine can move between the four dimensions, said Michael.I also understand that it has power over gravity, electromagnetic forces, energy and matter.How can I possibly face the machine by only being able to control photonic molecules and move between the dimensions?The End Machine actually exists in all four dimensions at once.I only exist in a single dimension.What you say is true.Human beings have an awareness of the other three spacial dimensions, and a part of us exists in those dimensions, like a reflection of ourselves.This is how we have the potential to move between the dimensions.In ancient times it was discovered that our cells have a certain awareness of what is occurring in the additional spacial dimensions.Nonetheless, the machine was constructed across the four spacial dimensions.It can conceal its central mechanism in any spacial dimension it chooses.The original hope was that the Lore of the Ancients would allow us to jump between dimensions to locate the central mechanism and provide us with an opportunity to destroy or deactivate the machine.The End Machine destroyed humanity in our former galaxy because our ancestors could not shut down the central mechanism after the machine turned against us.The machine hid its central mechanism beyond reach and used its awesome power to destroy anyone who attempted to shut it down.Surely even getting close to the central mechanism will be difficult, said Michael.Difficult is an understatement, said Acacius.I have been pondering these challenges for many years.When I encountered the End Machine on Epheria Prime I was shocked by how much space the machine was occupying in the additional three spacial dimensions.The End Machine is larger than we could have ever imagined.It has increased its power over thousands of years.The Magnifier will increase your power and help you fight the machine; however, I doubt your skills will be enough to destroy the central mechanism even if you do get close to it.What can we do?asked Michael.There could possibly be another way.The Lore of the Ancients speaks of a mysterious place beyond the four spacial dimensions.Little was known about the place beyond, but the men and women who wrote the Lore of the Ancients are said to have encountered the boundary at the edge of space and time whilst they were exploring the spacial dimensions.They hoped to go beyond the boundaries of the spacial universe to find a way to defeat the End Machine, but they did not have time to investigate the possibility before the End Machine destroyed them, ending their quest for knowledge.We have the Lore of the Ancients because their documented knowledge was handed to the pilots of the Cradle Ship which brought humanity to the Triangulum Galaxy.We have to do our best with what they left us.The Lore of the Ancients is our only chance.**  Ajax was sitting with Cynthia and Gopher in the living room.He was watching Gopher with a fierce look in his dark eyes.Gopher was trying to avoid eye contact.Yes, it is true, my dear; professional thieves do have a secret guild, said Gopher.The guild provides us with a platform for locating jobs and contracts.Sometimes jobs are too large for a single thief and the guild connects us with other professionals.Youre a pack of scoundrels if you ask me; rotten to the core, growled Ajax.Gopher averted his eyes and wouldnt meet Ajaxs aggressive stare.I agree, Ajax; often thieves are unsavoury people.In many ways I regret entering the industry in the first place, he said in a trembling voice.Thats ridiculous, stated Cynthia.Why dont you just leave the industry if you feel that way?Gopher scratched his chin and gave the question some thought before answering.Well, I guess the chief reason is that I am just not very good at anything else, he said in a matter of fact way.Ajax rolled his eyes and banged the table with his open hand.Thats a load of space rot!There are plenty of jobs you could do.Youre only a thief for the money.Greed, nothing but greed!I know what youre about, Gopher.You cant fool me.Gophers eyes widened as he melted back into his chair.You seem to know a lot about thieves.I would guess from experience, he said in a very low voice.Ajax kicked his chair back and stood up.Thats it!Ive had enough of you already!He clenched his fists and started to move around the table.Gopher leapt up and attempted to keep Ajax on the opposite side of the table.Im going to break your face!growled Ajax.Ajax, stop it!yelled Cynthia.For a moment Ajax was conflicted.His face was red and his eyes were bulging, but he found he couldnt go against Cynthias command.He took a deep breath and lowered his fists.Leave him alone.Youre ten times his size and beating him wont solve anything, she said firmly.Ajax gave a curt nod and conceded the point.Watch what you say around me, Gopher.Ill let you off this time, but only because Cynthia asked me to.Ajax turned and walked out of the room.**  Michael sat in the co pilots seat beside Sara.We are entering the danger zone, she said as she checked some of the navigation control configuration settings.You should get some sleep.Ill wake you up when we arrive.What about you, Sara?Sara shook her head.Not me, Captain.Im not going under.I wasnt joking when I said how dangerous alien controlled space is.Its not like travelling through the war zone.The aliens completely occupy this whole region.They control every habitable world.If we get into trouble there will be nowhere to turn.We are probably the only human ship out here, so that means we will stand out like a firework.I will attempt to carve a path and avoid the known occupied systems.Ill try to stay out in deep space as much as I can.If we are detected then you can kiss goodbye any hope of reaching Moros Gamma.Make sure you wake me at the first sign of trouble.Ive set the sleep pods to autowake via the main computer.You will be awake within seconds if we detect an alien ship.Well done.She peered through the viewing panel into the darkness of space, and for a moment she seemed like she was drifting off into a trance.Michael studied her face, and he could see she looked very tired.The strain of the last few weeks had taken its toll on her.Are you all right, Sara?She turned to look at him.No other captain in the galaxy would do this.You know its completely crazy.You can still change your mind.Its not as crazy as you think, and Ill explain why.The answer is exactly in the words you just used: no other captain in the galaxy would do this.Therefore the aliens wont expect it.Youre worried about them finding us, but I think they wont be looking.What ship would willingly travel through alien occupied space?The answer is that no ship would be willing.Why would the aliens commit resources to scanning empty space?They wouldnt.She didnt say anything for at least twenty seconds.Michael stared into her blue eyes and was waiting for a response.She leaned back in her chair.Captain, you should get some sleep; you will need it, she said coolly.Most of the time youre right, Sara, but just maybe Im right this time, he said as he stood up.Time will tell, Captain.Goodnight, Sara.Sleep well, Captain.**  Michael woke as the glass cover of his sleeping pod slid away.He opened his eyes.Sara was standing beside his pod.You were right; they didnt detect us.I kept to deep space and avoided the known space routes.We havent sighted a single alien ship.We are four hours out of Moros Gamma, she said, a sense of relief evident in her voice.Michael sat up and felt the blood returning to his extremities.His fingers and the palms of his hands felt numb from the extended length of time spent sleeping.Thats good news.Im glad to hear Im not completely ignorant, he said drowsily.The only thing we have to consider now is the siege.There will probably be a substantial fleet of alien ships surrounding the planet.We might be able to blast our way past, especially as they wont expect anyone to be coming from the opposite direction, but getting away from the planet, that is another question.The Morosians will have to deactivate the EPHX cannons for us to pass through their defences.Can you open a secure line of communication?Ill wait until we get closer.There is a high probability the aliens will intercept any signal we try to send.The less time they have to prepare for our arrival the better our chances of survival.Michael stepped out of his sleeping pod and walked with Sara back to the control room.Ivan was sitting in the co pilots seat and looked up as they entered the confined room.Good morning, Captain, said Ivan, his voice sounded even more robotic than usual and completely lacked any tone.Good morning, Ivan, replied Michael.What happened to your voice?The fault in my damaged internal vocal chip is degrading.There is a high probability the chip will fail, and in such a case I will be left without a voice.I will have to do something about that when we get back to human controlled space, said Michael.I would appreciate that, Captain.Michael felt guilty about not getting the repair done when he had Ivan repaired back at X5126.Im sorry, Ivan.I should have had your voice repaired a long time ago.It is quite all right, Captain.Ill make it a priority.Sara took the pilots seat and flicked the switch on the holographic projector panel.A transparent and glowing image of Moros Gamma appeared before them.The most obvious feature was the number of mountain ranges.When the Epherians first discovered the planet it was uninhabitable, said Sara.A group of ancient colonists set about terraforming about two and a half thousand years ago.Its still not considered a prime world, but it does have an oxygen rich atmosphere and the gravity is rated at 1.13.Before the aliens attacked the valleys were teaming with flora and fauna.The aliens destroyed almost everything on the surface in the initial attack.They dropped heavy conventional bombs on the human cities.Every city on the surface was completely flattened.How did Morosians survive the invasion?asked Michael.They managed to push back the first wave, even though their fleet was vastly outnumbered.They sacrificed a lot to hold back the aliens.From what I can gather the aliens underestimated the Morosian response and didnt send enough ships to complete their first assault.By the time the second alien fleet arrived the Morosians had constructed the EPHX cannons from secret blueprints based on the Epherian frontier defences.The EPHX cannons are extremely advanced and evasive satellites which automatically fire at any ship or conventional projectile approaching the planet, and it seems the aliens dont have an answer to this method of defence, yet.The only option the aliens had was to attack the surface from a distance with long range lasers, but the Morosians moved their entire population underground, so the laser attacks cause little damage.So the aliens set up a siege to stop the population escaping, said Michael.Yes, and they must have known the EPHX cannon lenses would eventually decay.I expect theyre waiting for the lenses to fail, and when that day comes the Morosians wont stand a chance against the resulting invasion, and they are too far away to flee to another system.The result would be complete obliteration of their civilization.**  The entire crew had come out of deep sleep.They were approaching the planet.Ethan was in the engine room manually checking all the systems.Acacius, Cynthia, Ivan, Ajax and Gopher were in the living room.Michael and Sara were in the control room.Sara was configuring an encrypted signal, which she hoped would pass the alien fleet without being detected and would enable her to open a secure line of communication.I will try to open up a hidden communication channel.Lets hope this works.She hit the external com switch.Moros Gamma, this is the Out Drifter.Interworld code AMB712.We are approaching with precious cargo you requested from the Tunnel Makers.
