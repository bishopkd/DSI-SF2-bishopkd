Nikitin said, Youve saved my ass enough times to earn a little blind trust.Yeah, about that Jack said and paused to look for the right words.I need to cash that trust in.I didnt exactly come back alone.We gathered as much.Charlie gave him a pat on the shoulder.Managed to spring a couple other prisoners on your way out?No.I came back with the jailer and three of his ET buddies.A silence fell over the passengers, so brittle that Jack thought it might shatter.Your partner.The guy that made it out of the Ark?Nikitin asked.Yeah.Thats him.Jack could smell the confusion.So there are humans working with the aliens?Charlie asked.No, he just looks like us.Its a disguise.Nikitin was the first to speak.Hey pal I dont think Im alone in saying that youre actually shaking my faith a little bit here.I know, but I promise Im no traitor.Im trying to  To stop the war, Lisa said.What else?Youre the same man youve always been.Still standing up for what we all used to believe in.Still trying to save lives, no matter the cost.Any which way I can.Youre a real stubborn son of a bitch, Charlie said.You always took after dad, that way.Its the only virtue Ive got.Thats a virtue, right?Lisa shook her head.Not one of the classical ones, no.Bottom line is that a big ass stampede is about to storm through here and trample this place into dust, and millions are going to die unless we do something about it.What kind of something?Charlie asked.Nikitin twisted in his seat and looked Jack in the eyes.Does your plan involve doing something dangerous or stupid?Im not sure yet, but probably both.Nikitin laughed.Right on.Count me in.Why not, Charlie said, I dont much like the colonels battle plan anyway, and Ive never been too attached to breathing.You know what hes up to?Jack asked.Mostly.Theres something super secret brewing that I couldnt get in on, but I know the major moves.Ive also heard rumors that they jury rigged the nuclear reactor into some kind of last resort weapon, in case things go real bad.Command has a real no surrender mentality, and frankly, these arent my kind of tactics.Me neither.You in, Chase?You know me, boss.I dont ask too many questions.Just point me in a direction and Ill drive.What about you, Lisa?With me?You need to ask?To the ends of the Earth and right on into hell.The jeep slowed and pulled around the circle of trees.Jack took a deep breath and said, Then its settled.Do me a favor and keep cool when you meet my new friends.They may be monsters, but theyre pretty decent folk.Chapter 48:  Salamander  The day of the attack arrived, and Elkellian was mounted up and ready to go.He felt nervous, as did his Yuon Kwon, Klethis Aum Auresh.They were eager to get things started, hoping the sprint would calm their nerves.The waiting was always the hardest part.Rider and mount strutted and paced together, while the Silgamathe many legged constructor Yuon Kwonassembled fortifications all around them.Elkellian tried to calm Klethis, whispering, Soon, honorable one.Just another few moments, and then it will be our time.The other Yuon Kwon and their Alarhya stood at ease, and Elkellian wondered how they did it.He was always a bundle of nervous energy before a battle, and he worried that it was just his nerves and not Klethis at all.It was sometimes hard to tell which was which, even for a practiced rider.He had reason to be nervous, though.This would be the last great battle.Broken remnants of the Nefrem were still scattered around the planet, but the great bulk of their military was here, and they would fall.There could be no other outcome.Elkellian cherished the thought of a day when the Nefrem were nothing but a legend, a scary story whispered to children over firelight, and the Oikeyans new home was truly their own once and for all.Then the war horns sounded and it was time.Elkellian and Klethis whooped together, their combined voices rising above the din of Yuon Kwon hooves.For freedom!they cried, their long legs launching them out over the open ground, and the advance had begun.Neck and neck, the rush of Yuon Kwon raced out across the plains toward the Nefrem fortress.Elkellian and Klethis became pure speed, each stride driving them faster until the world around became a blur and only their distant target was clear.Open soil gave way to the enemys primitive huts, and the pair cut hard to the left.Klethis agile hooves found footing between the close packed shelters, while Elkellian scanned the clutter for his target.There it was.Klethis hooves clattered, his legs bent and filled with energy, then he leapt high into the air.He was pressed against the sky.The world was eerily quiet at the top of the arc until the wind rushed in to fill it.Rider and mount cried out in unison, and spread their cannon arms like short, stubby wings.They sailed down toward the Nefrem air defense tower and fired, bright blue blasts streaking out and battering the target into a cloud of smoke and burning debris.The tower was no more.Elkellian and Klethis plummeted through the cloud, reoriented in mid air, and cranked hard to the side.As they hit the ground, they rebounded and raced off in a new direction, already on the hunt for the next tower.* * *  The sky was clear except for a single cloud.Zelliar and Vissa Aum Heirath climbed high into the air, twisting and spinning as they went, the rest of their fighter wing trailing behind in a delta formation.The rider and his flyer cut thrust and allowed their momentum to carry them up into stall.The Yuon Kwons nose just barely touched the misty cloud, then together they tumbled back toward the swollen Earth.Clouds were good omens, and since there was only one, Zelliar gave it a gentle kiss before rushing into battle.The fin surrounding Vissas hull spun into motion, and her thrust returned.Mount and rider howled as they bolted down from the heavens and opened fire on the ramshackle settlement below.The timing was exact.The Auresh walkers sprinted clear, having destroyed the air defense towers and paved the way for the Heirath flyers to finish the job.Zelliars fighter wing stretched apart and spat blue flames at the sprawling wooden city, which lit up like kindling and choked the air with smoke.They turned the Nefrem settlement into a raging firestorm, a twisting, demonic inferno crackling beneath a sky of charcoal grey.Flames reached upward, with only the dirt mound that was the Nefrem fortress standing above them, uncaring and unaffected at the center of the blaze.Zelliar had an odd feeling looking upon the fortress, as if it were moulting, shedding its skin and transforming into something else.Something unknown and terrible.No matter.He could hardly wait to see it smashed to pieces, and he wouldnt have long to wait.He called out to the rest of the fighter wing, who returned to formation and left the battlefield as one.* * *  Ten thousand Heirath Yuon Kwon filled the darkening skies as they formed up and raced away from the burning lands.At the battle line beneath them, a Kitsu named Arcotis sat atop one of the many Khoom Yuon Kwon, the massive siege cannons which sat aimed at the fortress.The Khoom could fire incredible distances, but their vision was terrible, making the Kitsu and their sharp eyes ideal companions.When the last of the Heirath were clear, Arcotis gave the signal.The great walker leaned forward, braced itself and fired its unbelievably large cannon with a deafening thump.The other Khoom and their Kitsu fired all around the great circle of the Oikeyan battle line, creating a thunderous cacophony.Their rounds exploded in star shaped bursts on the other side of the inferno, biting deep craters out of the armored mound.The rhythmic thump of the cannons continued throughout the day while the crackling firestorm raged, yet the Nefrem fortress remained.Arcotis called out adjustments, placing shells all over his target, but the building stood despite him, pitted and chewed up yet unassailable and imperious above the flames.Twilight came, and the charcoal sky turned black.The fires burnt on, unquenchable and undying, lighting the landscape in flickering yellow and orange, but still the fortress stood.Arcotis called out another adjustment and shouted Fire!above the racket.He watched yet another blast take an insignificant hunk out of the fortress, grimacing with the realization that cracking it might take all night.* * *  Daniel waited in a dark, stuffy, cramped room.There were other men at either shoulder, in front of and behind him, and he felt like a sardine.Or maybe a canned mackerel.Or anchovy.Definitely a fish of some sort.Theyd been standing there in the dark throughout the day, while the thunder of nearby artillery rocked the shelter over and over again.It didnt seem so bad at first, but after more than eight hours of standing nuts to butts, Daniel was uncomfortable in a way he never thought possible.Then a red light flicked on to signal the assault, and Daniel and the others checked their weapons one last time.Locked and loaded, a sergeant yelled.Ready to rock and roll!the others replied.Ground charges went off.The Earth rumbled and shook as thousand upon thousands of buried explosives detonated for tens of kilometers around, tearing the ground asunder and disrupting the enemy line.Alien screams and panicked cries rose above the din, as the constant thump of artillery finally came to an end.The release hatch opened with a groan, revealing the dim and smoky night, the riven landscape and raging fires beyond.Gun emplacements on either side of the hatch opened fire, spitting burning lead at the alien bastards, their bright tracers streaking the dark sky above.Go, go, go!Daniel shouted, accompanied by the sound of boots pounding dirt.All along the battle line, a flash flood of fresh human troops numbering in the millions surged from their underground shelters, filling the ragged craters left by their explosives.The teams took turns moving, odds then evens, providing cover fire while their counterparts advanced, then striving for a few more meters.They squeezed the enemy in towards the Ark and the ravenous blaze which surrounded it.Daniels squad pushed fast and hard, and as a group, dove to their bellies and opened fire.Their barking rifles punched holes in the invaders, who scrambled for cover in half demolished forts.The twitching corpses of the giant cannon walkers lay beyond, their legs shattered by the surprise attack.Move up the MG!Daniel shouted, and a gunner stomped up behind him, hit the deck and leaned into his weapon.The gun spat another stream of hot lead into the enemy hordes.Grenades arced high, rolled across the ground and exploded, raining shrapnel in every direction.Rockets whistled by, their smoke trails gleaming in the orange light of the thriving inferno.We got em.Keep up the pressure!Right flank.Pin it down.Die bastards!Daniel was sighting targets and dropping one alien after the next when he heard a sound like no other.He heard and felt it, like the buzz of a defective speaker at a concert, but amplified a thousand times.He looked all over for the source of the noise, and finally found a titanic silhouette in the smoke filled sky.An instant later, metallic bubbles like boiling quicksilver appeared around the alien troops.Bullets and rockets alike bounced off the bubbles impotently, unable to penetrate or even disturb them, while the enemy regrouped inside.Just like that, the advantage went back to the invaders, while the human soldiers sought cover and dug in.A new battle line emerged, with forces entrenched on either side, lobbing explosives forward and firing at anything stupid enough to raise its head.It ceased to be a battle, and instead became a meat grinder, churning human and alien alike into an undifferentiated smear of stinking offal.Suppressed by fire and locked in place, the soldiers on both sides fought without rest.The lines never moved more than a meter in either direction, and the carnage continued until morning.Chapter 49:  Donovans Counter Attack  Legacys bridge was oddly quiet.The three tiered ivory white room had been redecorated, now sporting a combination of human and Eireki technology, as did much of the rest of the ship.Dozens of computer workstations lined the room, each manned by a crew member busily making final preparations for the return.Marcus Donovan was floating in place at the command station, the exact spot where he was bonded to Legacy more than a year before.Hed become so adept at manipulating the gravity systems that his feet never touched the floor anymore.He was content instead to fly from one position to the next, like a proper creature of the void.This is taking too damn long, he said.Mason, give me some good news.Loading procedures are nearly complete, sir.Were waiting on the last cargo shipment right now.Much to Marcus surprise, things had gone largely according to plan during the previous nine months.The two factories, one inside Legacy and the other on the surface of Mars, had worked non stop, fed by materials reclaimed from the two small moons.The fleet of tugs completely dismantled Deimos, and Phobos was nearly hollow now.The three habitation domes of Ares Colony were transformed into a sprawling metropolis that far outpaced its population, while a half dozen destroyers and an assortment of smaller warships joined Legacy in orbit.They also surrounded Mars with a network of defense satellites, capable of putting a serious hurt on anyone reckless enough to arrive unannounced.Mason said, The last carrier is docked, sir.Were ready to go.Marcus nodded.About time.Open a priority channel to Administrator Saladin.Mason tapped at his console, and a holographic image of the administrator appeared at the front of the bridge.Youre ready to depart, Dr.Donovan?As ready as well ever be.Does my fleet meet with your approval, Administrator?Of course, Saladin said.And we both know I couldnt stop you anyway.Take care of my people, Marcus.Ill bring them back to you, sir.Good luck and God speed.The administrator ducked his head and the hologram vanished.An instant later, the walls of the bridge went into crystal mode, revealing the endless sea of stars and a particularly bird like cruiser doing barrel roles in space.Should I inform Phoenix were ready to get under way?Mason asked.No, Marcus said with a grin.Faulklands a big boy.Hell figure it out.He told Legacy it was time, and she did the rest.The starscape lurched out of position as the ship came about, then she launched toward Earth, accompanied by the feeling falling.Sarah Park checked her instruments and reported, Reading zero obstructions between here and our destination.Hollow drive at ninety percent output.Linear gravitational accelerators running at maximum efficiency.Current speed is .108 C, Earth relative.ETA in forty three minutes.Good, Marcus said, but he didnt mean it.Forty three minutes was too long.A minute would be too long, but Legacy was still running on a single hollow drive, which limited her to less than a fifth of her maximum speed and prevented the use of her instantaneous traversal system altogether.That also meant they were confined to a single star system until they could somehow crack the hollow drives secrets.With only one drive, the ship was always riding on the razors edge of failure.Legacy was a mind bogglingly powerful ship, but she was crippled compared to her former glory.And worse, overdrawing could destroy the one remaining drive, and Legacy would simply die.Without access to new hollow drives, she also couldnt construct sentient vessels like herself.The fleet was instead composed of hybrid vessels, which bent Eireki technology to human designs.They were human ships with alien aftermarket parts.Rao had made some headway in his study of hollow drive technology, but it was slow going.He theorized that the device used a gravitational lens to distort the fabric of space, warping probability and producing a fountain of exotic particles at its center.It basically generated a near infinite supply of energy out of thin air.Or maybe it sucked power out of another dimension, or out of magical pixy farts for all he knew.That power came at the price of durability.The slightest crack in the hollow drives casing would cause it to self destruct and collapse in on itself, rendering it permanently useless.There was no repairing it or salvaging its remains.There was no way to take it apart and study its insides.A hollow drive was either whole and functioning, or destroyed beyond all recognition.They were designed that way to prevent the Nefrem from replicating the technology, but it had drawbacks the designers hadnt foreseen.The forty three minute trip passed in tense silence, and then the bright blue Earth appeared and filled the bridge crews view.The Phoenix had already arrived ahead of them.Legacy briefly flashed a memory through Marcus head of the EarthGarden, as she still called iteons ago when she first arrived.The planets beauty hadnt dimmed at all with age, and it was a precious, shining gem among a cold and distant universe.The silence was filled with prayers.The crew were in the presence of something divine, something that still had the power to take their breath away and inspire their imaginations.In a few moments, they were going to stain it with blood.Marcus floated higher into the air, took a deep breath and spoke.As he did, his voice echoed through every inch of Legacy, as well as the many smaller ships contained within her.Ladies and gentlemen, welcome home.The glowing Earth filled his eyes.We stand on a precipice; victory is finally within our grasp, yet the possibility of failure still haunts us.Let this be a moment of quiet reflection before the storm.We look into our hearts for the strength to steel our resolve, and make our will unassailable.Our fury unstoppable.In just a few minutes, we will descend through the heavens and bring fire down upon the enemy.We will crush him where he stands and strike a blow for freedom, and through this conflict forge a new destiny from our blood, sweat and tears.Here above the clouds, I can finally see one thing clearly, and you should see it too.We are the future, a new humanity, and the time has come for us to take back our world.So I ask you, are you ready?The rally cry of fifteen hundred eager soldiers echoed back, and Marcus smiled.Mason, transmit on all known frequencies.Ready, sir.Attention alien invaders.This is Marcus Donovan, commander of the Eireki starship Legacy.Make peace with your gods.End transmission.Channel closed, sir.The rapid assault carriers emerged from the hangar bay and descended toward the planet with Faulklands Phoenix trailing behind.Legacy spun, took aim and spat out the five Hoplite troop transports, which streaked out and became shooting stars as they touched the upper atmosphere.The dice were cast.There was nothing left but to watch, wait and pray.* * *  Hoplite Alpha tore through the stratosphere at several times the speed of sound.The hexagonal pod glowed white hot, but the chamber inside was comfortable and quiet.A hundred soldiers were packed inside, shoulder to shoulder in rows facing outward, each encased in MASPEC Mk 2 armor.The suits were the color of dried blood, except for the clear half domes of their helmets.The Mk 2 was a more elegant and refined design, which stripped away the rough edges and mechanical look of the original, and replaced them with a more biological, rounded appearance.The new model incorporated a host of Eireki technologies that improved on human technology in every conceivable way, making the armor smaller, more agile and nearly three times as strong.Amira Saladin had literally outdone herself.As her drop pod rapidly approached the ground, she hoped it was enough.The Hoplites gravitic accelerator came to life at the last possible moment, slowing the pod as it met the ground, and giving the soldiers little more than a soft jostle.The vessels walls rotated outward and its canopy lifted, transforming it into an instant fort.Guns mounted atop it opened fire, their loud roar filling the air.The walls finished reconfiguring and revealed the world outside in the dim light of early morning.The ground was scorched and covered in still smoking cinders, and a few hundred meters beyond lay the jagged line of alien outposts.Her docking clamp released with a clank, and Sal prepared herself.You ready?Kazuo asked beside her.She grabbed her long Nikola rifle from its storage hook overhead, and said, Lets do this.The rapid assault carriers above fired fighter jets out like bullets, while armored soldiers streamed out of the Hoplite and into the smoking field.Once outside, the MASPEC troopers split into squads and advanced in leaps and bounds, assisted by small thrusters on armors back and legs.Their movements had a strange grace, and combined with their choreographed advances, the rush became a ballet.Sal and Kazuo led the pack, bracing themselves at each landing before firing their rifles into the alien horde.The weapons ejected heavy metal rounds at nearly five kilometers a second, and hit their targets like tank shells.Soft targets were torn into arcing ribbons and mist, while hard targets buckled and shattered under the impact.It only took a few moments for the aliens to react to the new threat, and their shining metallic shields slid around to protect them, but by then, the MASPEC troopers were among them and engaged in hand to hand.In her armor, Sal felt unstoppable.Shed become a war machine, an angry titan, faster than the small furry aliens, better armored than the large grey ones, and stronger than anything else in the field.The aliens mobbed her but she plodded on with grim determination, feeling bones crunch beneath her armored fists, while Kazuo battled nearby with considerably more zeal.Meter by meter, her squad thrashed through the opposition, littering the ground with shredded corpses.It wasnt long before the enemy building was cleared, and they took the roof, gaining an open line of fire on their entrenched enemy.Operations were carried out with surgical precision all along the perimeter, and the battle line was broken.Squads of MASPEC troopers stormed the forts, while their protean jets clashed with alien craft overhead.The Phoenix and its coterie of assault carriers hung in the air just above the Ark, raining down beams of burning energy on whatever remained.With a thought, a tube on Sals shoulder launched a bright green flare into the air, signaling an all clear at her position.Then she and her squad hunkered down behind the battlements and opened fire.* * *  Jack and his team sat atop a low ridge more than two kilometers out beyond the line.Human and Oikeyan alike watched the battle from relative safety, filled with disappointment, sadness and hopelessness.The one thing Jack was sure of was that hed failed.The thought turned his stomach.The arrival of strange warships and armored soldiers left them all baffled.Youre even better than I thought, Kai said.I really believed you didnt have a fleet.He trailed off with his weird laugh.We didnt, Jack said.I dont know who they are.Are those Nefrem forces?No.I mean, theres a resemblance but its superficial.Whoever they are, theyre good, though.Very, very good.So thats it, Charlie said.The cavalry arrives and we win.No offense to your alien buddies, but Im not exactly heartbroken.We should have a beer and call it a day.Kai shook his head.You think the legion will be routed?You expect them to just pack up and leave?They havent even begun to fight yet.He pointed out into the distance, where the adolescent city Yuon Kwon was only a thin, hazy silhouette.This will escalate, I promise you that.Armored Alarhya will come out of the city, and airborne reinforcements are already on their way.Expect carpet bombing if things dont look up soon.So whos going to win?Nikitin asked.I honestly cant say, Kai said solemnly, but the one thing I can guarantee is more needless death.Deadlocks are never good for either side.In a war of attrition, there are only losers.So, how do you break a deadlock?Jack asked of no one in particular.Give one side an advantage, Charlie said.Or present both sides with a bigger threat, Kai added.Then, right at that moment, Jack was struck by an idea.It was, without doubt, the worst idea hed ever had.It was perhaps the most terrible idea anyone had ever had in the grand and illustrious history of bad ideas.That was how he knew it was going to work.Chapter 50:  Right In Two  Kai sprinted out across the open steppe, the immense strength in his legs driving him nearly as fast the fighter jets above.Each stride covered tens of meters, and he hadnt even worked up a sweat yet.He would soon enough.As he came to the human side of the battle lines, he accelerated, and in several large leaps, moved from one embankment to the next, bypassing the soldiers completely and continuing into the scarred no mans land beyond.Strange weapons exploded all around, blasting soil hundreds of meters into the air, but Kai was too fast.Too agile.He danced through the field, analyzing thousands of barking weapons, and calculated the safest path through.He was built for this task.A continuous hail of hot metal surrounded him, but he weaved through it.He was in his element, and no creature on the battlefield could match him.He wasnt there to fight, though.This was just an obstacle course on the way to his objective.A warm up.He engaged his camouflage as he approached the Oikeyan side and became a ghost.The effect was imperfect, but combined with his fantastic speed and the chaos of battle, it made him virtually undetectable.Hidden in broad daylight, he launched himself high into the air and used the fighting Yuon Kwon as terrain, leaping from the armored shell of one to the next.This part of his mission was so easy it was practically a game.Then he came to the charred remains of the human settlement, which had burnt brightly throughout the night but was now reduced to smoking cinders.He sprinted at top speed, ignoring the ruins under foot and the human drop pods spitting fire over his head.He cut a path straight for the Ark.As Kai came to the final stretch, he dug down deep, found the last reserve of extra power lurking inside him, and charged.He charged with everything he had.His feet ground deep into the ruined soil and the wind howled as he blasted through the thick air.He coiled his fist back and exploded through the titanium steel door.The metal groaned and buckled inward.Massive hinges on either side sheered under the force.He was inside.His mission was half complete.* * *  Jack and Felix raced through the clotted skies, while a desperate air battle went on all around them.Cuttlefish and the strange transforming fighters chased each other in every direction, burping fire at one another as they careened about and fought for position.Charlie and Lisa were understandably uncomfortable in the vehicle, while Nikitin wasbeyond all sense or reasonhaving the time of his life.Behind them, Ferash and Dojer held their weapons at ready in case of unwanted followers.It was anyones guess how effective their weapons would be, but Dojers cannon was better than nothing at all.The young city Yuon Kwon loomed in the distance, reminding Jack of the flying saucers in every old, cheesy horror movie.The last thing he ever expected was for aliens to show up in actual saucers, yet there they were.A cuttlefish burst into flames above them and plummeted out of the sky, leaving a trail of burning debris in Felixs path.It reminded Jack this wasnt a movie; it was real life, and he was in the middle of a very real battle.I know Ive put you through a lot, but if you could go just a little faster, Id really appreciate it, he whispered to his mount.Felix picked up speed, with a jitter that showed he was straining against his limits.Thank you.They approached the flying city, a smaller version of the twenty kilometer monstrosities which had taken up residence at the Earths equator.This young one was just over a kilometer in diameter, and was an even more vibrant blue indigo than its older kin, but was otherwise identical.His interior was only opened a crack, through which damaged cuttlefish returned and fresh ones came out.The surface of the massive alien creature bristled with cannon banks spraying blue fire, while patches of liquid metal slipped across it to deflect incoming attacks.These were the defensive membranes Kai had mentioned, and their speed was startling.Pilots in bony Yuon Kwon battle armor came flying out of the ship as Felix approached, and the stream of them never stopped.The six armed creatures headed off to join the battle, and Jack could only imagine what they must be like in combat.Luckily, they paid Jack and his team no mind.No one did.To everyones surprise, Felix was ignored by both forces equally, and they managed to slip inside without incident.Even more surprising was the interior of the city Yuon Kwon, which was much different than Jack expected.The stalagmite like buildings were nowhere to be found, replaced by row upon row of short, squat hangars.That wasnt the most drastic change, though.The generator towers were opened up like flowers in full bloom, revealing the large and furiously burning stars within, connected to one another by arcing bolts of golden lightning.Each tower was surrounded at the base by an arena like structure, filled with the silver robed Sey Chen monks, all focused on the miniature stars above them.With the easy part of the journey out of the way, Jack steered Felix toward the thick nerve bundle at the heart of the Yuon Kwon, and prayed for the best.* * *  Kai navigated the maze of tunnels, and even at his unnatural pace, progress was tedious.His less than stealthy entrance triggered alarms that howled throughout the Ark.Emergency bulkheads closed, creating all new dead ends and pointless cul de sacs.Every corner presented another set of guards with itchy trigger fingers he had to avoid.They spent more time firing at their own shadows than at Kai, who blew past like a fierce wind.He missed the days when he was allowed to kill indiscriminately.It made his job a lot easier.Level by level, he penetrated deeper into the mound, running on walls as often as the floor.Each corridor was warmer than the last, and more packed with heavy tubes and pipes.That meant he was getting close to his target.So did the slow throbbing of his radiation detector.* * *  Two, burning blue rounds streaked past Felix, and the tiny flyer juked hard to the side.Weve got company, Jack!Really, he said with as much sarcasm as he could pack into the word, I hadnt noticed, Nik.Maybe I should try to evade them.Jack and Felix zoomed down toward the hangars and began weaving through the streets where the larger cuttlefish was too large to follow.It stayed above and took pot shots every few seconds.Nikitin and Ferash opened fire with their rifles, but the rounds plinked off the alien ships armor without effect.Are you planning to shoot any time soon, Dojer?Jack asked in Mirresh.The rhinos deep voice sounded nervous.Not a good idea.Dojer!The Rozom put his autocannon away and brought out his artillery weapon instead, aimed at the cuttlefish and fired.It thumped three times, and the tiny flyer rocked under the vicious recoil, nearly flipping over in the process.Jack and Felix struggled to stay upright.Whoa!Roiling balls of smoke erupted along the cuttlefishs exterior, only to be swept away by the onrushing wind a moment later.The ships hull was unmarked.Told you it wasnt a good idea.The cuttlefish fired again, this time aiming in front of the smaller Yuon Kwon.The blasts exploded in the thin alleyway ahead, and Felix instinctively made a hard kick turn to avoid the rain of debris.Smooth, Jack said, and the flyer cooed in response.Im all out of ideas, little buddy, so if youve got something, Id love to see it.Felix asserted control and came to a halt, then ducked into a deeply shadowed overhang.What are we doing?Lisa asked.Not sure, Jack replied, but for right now, just have a little faith.And they waited for the tiny flyer to make its move.* * *  Armed resistance thickened the closer Kai got to the heart of the reactor complex.The cunning bastards had figured out his destination, and fell back behind barricades to wait for him.Every new tunnel was a trap filled with hot lead, and they were taking their toll.Kai had done an admirable job avoiding their shots, but he could only do so much in tight confines, and now had several bullets lodged in his flesh.His muscles were adaptive, able to reroute around damaged areas and retain functionality, but every bullet also tore swaths out of his uniform, ruining his camouflage.He was becoming an easier target.Running at maximum output was wearing on him, too.His body temperature hit dangerous levels, and his muscles were cannibalizing themselves for fuel.He was nearing his breaking point, and oddly glad for the challenge.The deep red lights in this section strobed, and geysers of steam sprayed out from bundles of thick pipes.Kai sprinted down the tunnel, listening to the muffled sound of his feet hitting the floor.A junction loomed up ahead, and his cheerful mission computer was confident the turn led to the control room.So I should expect another barricade?But of course, Sinit, the computer replied.How exciting!Yes, terribly, Kai said.No easy way past.As he approached, the fingers of both hands keyed command sequences into his palms, then he curled his left hand into a fist.That hands knuckle guard crackled with energy, while his camouflage faded and began to glow white.It grew brighter until even the light reflecting off the walls was almost too bright to look at.He ran straight by the corridor and stopped on the other side, out of sight.The rhythmic bark of automatic weapons started and didnt stop, while shouts of confusion and panic sounded over the roar.When there was a lull, Kai went back.They were reloading.He jumped at the far wall, planted his heels and thrust against it, rocketing back down the opposite hall like a missile.Blind fire whizzed by and ricocheted around, but little of it came anywhere near him.He struck the barricade fist first, and his knuckle guard discharged into the metal.What was solid before became molten liquid spraying out in every direction.The super heated steel coated the blinded soldiers, and they screamed as they fell to the ground.Kai landed on the far side sprinted on, whispering an apology to Jack and his noble cause.* * *  The cuttlefish hunted in erratic patterns, trying to figure out where its target had slipped off to.All the while, Felix shadowed its every move, hidden just a few meters behind and below.The cuttlefish had a blind spot, and Felix knew exactly how to exploit it.After a few minutes of fruitless searching, the larger Yuon Kwon broke off and headed back toward the center of the city, apparently satisfied that his target had been destroyed.Jack and Felix followed.Youre much more clever than I suspected, Jack whispered, and Felix purred at his approval.The fact that the cuttlefish was headed toward the nerve center was a little too lucky in Jacks opinion, though.The last time he encountered luck like that, things didnt work out very well, and he wondered what sort of curve ball the universe was about throw him.The cuttlefish led them right up to the nerve center and then inside, where it finally disappeared into a darkened tunnel while Jack and Felix continued toward the heart.The inside of the nerve bundle was quiet and calm.There was no hint of the distant battle, or buzzing from the Sey Chen as charmed the miniature stars outside.It was peaceful there, and in the midst of mortal combat, that was even more alien.They came to the core of the Yuon Kwon in no time at all.It was a round chamber shaped like a pumpkin, with bulbous alcoves along the outer wall.At the center of the room was a cradle like those found in every Yuon Kwon, but regal and ornate like a medieval throne.It was set into the floor, and surrounded by a ring of outgrowths shaped like kneeling worshipers.Felix set down and released his grip on Jack, who stepped out with the others and walked cautiously across the floor.The silence was deafening.The others followed behind as he approached the cradle, step by shaking step.The pilot within was very old, his skin hanging loose and wrinkled, and covered with twisting tattoos and strange writing.Jack had a feeling like when he accidentally walked in on his parents as a kid.He was somewhere he didnt belong, interrupting something he wasnt supposed to see.He stepped between the outgrowths in the floor, reached out and placed his hand on the pilots shoulder.It craned its head back from the cradle and looked at him with its single, monstrous eye.There was no fear in that eye, only hatred.Remove yourself or be removed,  Jack said in their language.The pilot spat on him.At the same time, the rooms defenses moved into position and targeted the group at its center.Jack raised his .45 and put a round in the pilots head with one quick motion, and the defenses fell limp.He didnt relish it, but it had to be done.There were lives to save.The cradle relaxed and the pilots lifeless body slid free.Dojer dragged the corpse away with a grimace on his face, while Jack stepped forward and prepared to link up.Are you sure about this?Charlie asked.Not at all, Jack said, but its a little too late to change my mind.He wiped the pilots green blood from the cradle, then hunkered down into it and pressed his arms into the gaping orifices.The apparatus tightened around him, and his world disappeared.* * *  The reactor control room was full of workers when Kai arrived, but the sight of him riddled with bullet holes and covered in blood was enough to send them running.He sealed the door behind them and went to work.He reached behind a terminal and grabbed hold of a shielded cable.He scraped its insulation away to reveal the bare wire within, then lifted a tiny probe from his wrist computer and placed it on the metal.Alright, Im analyzing the network traffic, the mission computer said.This will take a moment, Sinit.Thats fine, he said, no rush or anything.While the AI did its work, Kai slumped down against the wall and tried to catch his breath.His body was on fire and he couldnt focus his eyes.Got it.Im simulating the client interface and probing their network architecture.How interesting.There are nodes here that were definitely not designed by humans.No matter.Ive finished mapping the network topology and have acquired root access.Shall I initiate self destruct, Sinit?Yes, he said.Set it for twenty minutes, and revoke all client credentials except your own.Emergency klaxons rang throughout the Ark.The computer went on, Done and done, Sinit.I feel as though I should mention that Ive calculated Jack Hernandezs probability of success, and it is vanishingly small.Yet I notice youre not moving.Kai laughed.Good observation.The foreign hardware has substantially increased their thermonuclear devices yield.My estimates show that the detonation will annihilate everything inside of this base and for some distance beyond.And?Ahem.That includes you, Sinit.It does.So, you intend to die here?I believe so.You swore to fight the Nefrem to the last drop of your blood, did you not?I did, but look where that got me.Im responsible for the death of eight billion humans.Ive done the Nefrems work for them.And I will be destroyed as well.The sum of Somari knowledge will be lost and gone forever.Your people will be dead and forgotten, Kai.Maybe its time.Perhaps it is at that, the AI said with resignation.After a pregnant pause, it added, This has been a very long and strange journey, hasnt it?It has, but dont worry, Kai said to his computer, itll be over soon.With that, Kai closed his eyes and tried to relax while the end approached.Chapter 51:  Symphony  Jack mysteriously found himself alone, standing in a circular room ringed with windows, revealing nothing but whiteness beyond.The floor and ceiling were perfectly reflective, creating a vertical hall of mirrors with Jack trapped in the middle.He was confused, and getting a little tired of it.Hello, he called out, and his voice echoed back at him.Is anyone here?He walked, but after a few steps, he was pretty sure he hadnt gone anywhere.He felt like he was moving, but the windows were no closer than before.He ran but with the same result.He cupped his hands to his mouth and called out, Hello!?There was no response.His imagination flared.Maybe he never escaped the prison.Maybe theyd been inside his head all along, and the past couple weeks were nothing but an illusion.They showed him the door, and he happily led them straight back to the Ark.He needed to get a grip.One way or another, the world he was in had to be an illusion.It was a false veneer, hiding something important.What was it?He tried to recall the past couple hours, but the memories were slick and difficult to get a hold of.They were loose, and came apart like over boiled meat.If he could only concentrate, he might be able to figure it out.He closed his eyes, metered his breathing and tried to focus on a single point.His inner voice ran non stop, full of panic and distress, but he focused and tried to let go.Just let it go.He breathed in and out, and perfect silence came to him for just an instant.There was peace, and he felt the other there with him.The other was massive and powerful beyond belief.He opened his eyes and the room was gone, replaced by the simultaneous view from ten thousand eyes, stitched together into a bewildering panorama.A battle raged all around, and flying objects wove complex patterns through the air.Jack felt and saw them all at once, and it was too much.Pain clawed into his head like a hot dagger.He screamed.The circular room returned, with its windows looking out on nothingness.It was filled with silence, as a glass overflowing with water.He was alone again, even though he knew the other was there.He heard another voice in the distance that just barely crept above the silence.Jack?the voice said full of worry, are you okay?I think so, he said, or maybe he didnt.He was so confused.I dont know.He was in some kind of cell, but he wasnt sure whether it was for the others safety, or his own.Maybe both.We dont have much time, the distant voice said.Images flashed by so quickly he couldnt make any of them out, like someone fanned a photo album in front of his face.When the images were gone, he was left with a dull, metallic taste in his mouth.None of it added up.He closed his eyes and said, Again.The images flashed by, still too quickly for him to make sense of.Slower, he said.I cant keep up.They came again, but this time he caught sight of a few.Vessels like sea shells, being torn apart in space by invaders.The images flew through his head again and again, until they finished with a roar that knocked Jack off his feet.When he opened his eyes, he was still standing.The other had shown him an invasion.It was a war against an unstoppable enemy who ate the dead.Jack could feel the others anger.It was all around him, a giant set of jaws that were slowly closing.He was on trial.He closed his eyes again and concentrated, but this time had a different focus.His thoughts were still slippery, but he reached down into them and dragged out every memory he could find.He brought to mind the face of every man, woman and child hed helped during his career with the Corps.Every sad refugee and bleeding wound.Every last one.It got easier as he went, and soon the images came on their own.Then he changed course, veering into the wastes of China where the aliens built piles of the dead and left them to rot.He remembered the family he found in the cellar, and all the refugees who joined his pilgrimage to the West.He remembered his first glimpse of blue sky after months traveling through the dust, and the pain he felt when he learned his whole world had been smashed apart.Finally, he remembered standing in the alien city, willing to kill his own rather than let the enemys innocent children die.Then he was back in that damn silence filled room.At least he knew why he was there, now.Youve done to us what they did to you.Are you satisfied now?His voice didnt echo this time.It stopped dead.Are you listening to me?He closed his eyes and sought out the silence, and just like last time, the ten thousand eyes all over the creature flooded into him, but this time he was ready.The pain struck, and he felt like white water rapids were trying to sweep him away, but he clung on and focused.Focused.There.He fought against the tide and shut out all the other eyes.He found the one he wanted.Out beyond the battle line, a hundred million human refugees streamed out of the Ark.They were running for their lives, and would never make it far enough in time.Neither would any of the soldiers still fighting on the line.Jack imagined a white hot blast followed by a mushroom cloud, and hoped the image was clear enough.The other turned from anger to panic.It couldnt understand why.It dug through Jacks head trying to find an answer, but he held the answer close and wouldnt let it out.He wanted to let the other sweat for a little while.Then he spoke slowly, unsure of precisely how the other understood him.Because this war will destroy us all.It will slowly bleed both sides dry until theres no one left to bury the dead.The other listened.Unless we can find some kind of peace.Some way to work together.All Ive done is make the threat more immediate, and now you have an opportunity to change the rules of the game.You can save millions of innocent lives from their own weapon, and create an opportunity to build a different tomorrow.Together.It wasnt sure.Neither am I, but the only other option is to do nothing and watch everyone die.Im not convinced thats such a bad idea, but the choice is yours.It wanted to know how.Jack imagined the silver robed Sey Chen all throughout the city, gathered in crowds around their miniature stars.Then he brought to mind an image of their shiny defensive membranes.Jacks mind was suddenly flooded with information from all over the Yuon Kwon, and he cried out.The other stopped, and Jack was back in the safe room.Not all at once.I need you to help me.All was quiet for a moment, and then the other tried again but with only a trickle instead of a flood, while Jack gritted his teeth and held on for dear life.It wasnt enough.He couldnt keep his head above water.He was swept away against his best efforts, and the two became one.Chapter 52:  The Quiet  Amira Saladin stopped firing as the humongous alien disc flew overhead and filled the sky.Its passing was followed by a pressure wave that knocked everyonehuman and alien alikeoff their feet.At the same time, all of the shiny metallic bubbles disappeared from around her opponents, leaving them unshielded.Something was happening.Something important.Whats going on?she demanded over the command channel.The channel was full of chatter and she couldnt tell if anyone answered.Then she noticed a group of words that kept repeating.Nuke.Get down!She crawled toward the edge of the battlement and watched the disc go by, then saw the wave of panicked refugees flooding across the burnt landscape between the Ark and their line.More came out of the fortress every second.It was a stampede, and it was coming right for her.Then she saw the most amazing and inexplicable thing she could ever imagine.Bolts of lightning crawled all over the Ark, and the metal hatches began to glow red.The disc stopped above it, and thousands upon thousands of liquid metal tentacles reached down and stabbed into the hillside.They tore through the fortress, rooted around inside and came back with a dense chunk of over wrought machinery covered in billowing clouds of steam.The bolts of lightning clung to that machine, as if trying to drag it back into the hole.With the machine held beneath it, the disc blasted up into the heavens and disappeared.A moment later, the sky was filled with a blinding flash as intense as the midday sun.Sal hadnt seen anything remotely like it since she was five years old, when the Sirius supernova filled the sky.Seconds later, she realized how close to being annihilated they had all come.Judging by the quiet all along the line, she wasnt alone in that.* * *  Space.The upper edge of the atmosphere was so pristine and beautiful.So empty, perfect and still.Amiasha Aum Samaraya had barely escaped the terrible explosion.The Sey Chen within had worked their magics and shielded him from most of the blast, but he was still badly wounded.His outer shell was cracked and smoking, and there was so much pain everywhere, outside and in, that he could think of nothing else.He tumbled through the void.Aimless.Broken.He was so young, but maybe it was his time to die.Jack!a distant voice called.Gravity pulled him downward.He fell down toward the alien planet, hot air rushing up and over him.So much terrible heat.Death approached.He could let himself break apart, and burn up in reentry.Then his pain would be over.Perhaps he had done enough to earn an honored place in the great beyond.You have to wake up!Whose voice was that?Amiasha scanned everywhere within himself, looking through each of his ten thousand eyes for the source of that voice, until he finally came to the chamber.There was something strange going on inside.They did not belong.Land bound.Oikeyan and Nefrem gathered in a circle around the cradle.His Alarhya dead on the ground, and a Nefrem joined to him instead.Who was that Nefrem?Please wake up, Jack.Flash.He was looking at his own body lying in that cradle.He was the city and the Nefrem at once.The tide rose up and swallowed him again.After all of this, couldnt they just let him die?Let his suffering end.The armor along his bottom was flaking away, exposing the soft inner flesh.He felt only the searing, white heat, blotting out every other thought.The pain brought silence.The silence was a gateway.Jack surfaced again, twitching between the circular prison and the reality of Amiasha Aum Samaraya plummeting through the Earths atmosphere.It would all be over soon.Jack!But it wasnt just Jack that would die.Lisa, Charlie and Nikitin would also.Ferash and Dojer, too.It wasnt just Amiasha who would die.Sey Chen in the thousands would perish.He couldnt allow this.Thrust.His tired and bleeding organs surged into action, and he pushed.He fought against the unrelenting pull of gravity.Still the ground approached.Still the searing heat increased.He poured everything into the struggle, but it wasnt enough.He didnt have enough.When no hope remained, only then did he hear the chorus of the Sey Chen.They sang quietly but with beautiful voices, and their strength grew with every passing moment.Their singing filled him with light and life.The five stars burned inside of him, brighter, stronger and hotter than ever before, and he found new power.Thrust.The ground approached, and Amiasha Aum Samaraya braced for impact.He howled out as he crashed into the Earth, and the ground split beneath him.The world quivered at his touch.He was down and it was complete.* * *  Are you okay, Jack?He couldnt tell.His head hurt bad, like hed been on an all whiskey diet for two weeks straight, and he felt displaced.Displaced?He groaned.Can you open your eyes?He tried.Something was short circuited in his brain.He knew what he wanted to do but couldnt find the switch.The darkness was kind of a relief.Then he found it, and his eyes slowly creaked open.Everything was blurry.There was vaseline on the lens.Lisa?Yup, she said.His eyes began to focus, but the splitting headache continued unabated.This seems familiar.I could really get used to seeing your face when I wake up.She smiled.We dont have to run anywhere, do we?Not this time, hero.Thank God, he said, and tried not to fall back asleep.At that, he failed.Chapter 53:  Aftermath  Marcus Donovan and Vijay Rao walked down a wide, blue green street overflowing with activity.There was so much foot traffic that Marcus could hardly see a few feet in front of him.It was another fine example of humanitys ability to cope in even the most dire of circumstances, and it impressed him and Legacy to no end.Four months had passed since the Battle of the Ark, which unexpectedly ended with both sides withdrawing.The strange events at the end left the humans and Oikeyans equally vulnerable and confused, and retreat was the only option that made any sense.A tense cease fire followed.Who couldve expected this?Marcus asked.I stopped making predictions about the future, Rao replied.Was costing me too much money.They pressed on through the crowd, and Marcus marveled at the multiple levels of the city up above, each built on its own web of catwalks.This was his first visit to the Oikeyan city called Amiasha, which had removed the Arks self destructing fusion reactor at the height of the battle, and saved countless lives.Afterward, the ship came crashing back down to the ground a few kilometers away, then took root in order to heal itself.There was some kind of mutiny aboard the ship, but the details remained a mystery.The Oikeyan legion abandoned it, and beat a hasty retreat back to their colonies in Africa.Meanwhile, the Ark had been torn to shreds, and a hundred million human refugees were once again homeless.It didnt take them long to come and investigate the city ship, like children poking a dead animal with a stick.But this animal was still alive.Just barely, but alive.What they found was simply amazing; the only aliens left aboard the ship were the pacifist Sey Chen, who welcomed the refugees with open arms.The rest, as they say, was history.Still, there were too many mysteries about that day for Marcus liking, and clues were few and far between.Why was the Arks self destruct activated in the middle of the battle?How did the city ship become aware of the impending explosion?Marcus had come down from orbit to find out.As they walked down Amiashas crowded streets, Marcus and Rao turned and cut through one of the many markets where people were busy selling all kinds of wares.At the far end, where the tents thinned out, they found the man they were looking for.He wore a set of army fatigues that had obviously been mended a few too many times, and his skin was thoroughly pitted and scarred.It looked like someone had splashed molten lava on him.Still, he was all in one piece, which was better than many soldiers could say, and hed found work as a guard for one of the new merchant class.Excuse me, are you Sgt.Karpov?Commander Donovan?Marcus nodded, and Karpov snapped a salute.Marcus returned the gesture clumsily, sure hed never quite get used to it.I wanted to ask some questions about the day of the battle, if thats alright.Absolutely, sir.I understand you were working guard detail in the reactor section.Is that correct?Yes, sir.Tell me what happened.Its all in my report, sir, the scarred soldier said.Thats alright.Id like to hear it in your own words.And Karpov told his story.Unfortunately, it matched the debriefing reports to the last detail.Someone or something had breached the Ark at the height of the battle.Many described it as an invisible monster that ran faster than bullets.Karpov saw only a blinding light that rushed his position and melted a steel barricade with its touch.His was just another of the hundred ghost stories that came out of that day.When Karpov finished, Marcus thanked him and went on his way.Someone out there had the missing puzzle pieces, and Marcus Donovan wouldnt rest until he found them.Sixty Seven  		All beneath the heavens call my Tao great.Because of its greatness, it seems strange, 		But if it werent strange, it wouldve faded long ago.There are but three treasures I cherish and cling to: 		The first is mercy, the second economy, 		And the third is indifference to winning.From mercy arises courage; from economy, generosity; 		From humility, the power to effect change.These days, men belittle mercy, yet celebrate courage; 		They forget economy while exercising generosity; 		They cast aside humility and always strive to be first.Thus do they court their downfall.Through mercy, struggles can be surmounted, 		And defenses made impenetrable.This is how the universe preserves and protects.
