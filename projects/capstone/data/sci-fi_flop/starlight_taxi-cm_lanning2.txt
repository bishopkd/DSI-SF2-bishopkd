He stopped outside of a red brick apartment building that went up for at least 20 stories.The street was mostly empty, and it was about 9 p. m.  local time.This is the hard part of the trip, Jin said, shrinking in fear.Just say what I said, and you should be fine, the driver said.No...I meant...the part where I tell you that I dont have any money for the fare, Jin said, squinting and raising his arms to protect himself just in case the driver decided to punch him.The driver yelled at the irresponsible adult for at least ten minutes before Jin reached for the black nylon case and handed it to the driver.I did manage to swipe this before I left.I was hoping youd accept it as payment?The driver furiously unzipped the black nylon case to reveal a pizza box from Sizzeranos Pizzeria.His scowl faded immediately when he realized what he held.Are we cool?Get the Hell out of Starla, Jin.Dont ever call me for a ride again, the driver said, giving the kid an out.Yes sir, Jin said, rushing out of Starla, but still taking care not to slam Starlas doors, lest he make the driver mad again.Well...thats fair, I guess, the driver said, opening the box and taking a slice of cheese pizza.As he took a bite of the surprisingly still warm pizza, his eyes widened.He was in love.Oh yeah...no wonder I cant afford this, the driver said, taking time to enjoy his dinner.3: Time to Let it Go  The drivers mind drifted.Itd been at least 20 hours since hed last slept, and it was starting to wear on him.As Starla coasted between Earth and Phobos, a moon of Mars, he began to to wonder about his next clients.They claimed to be a couple of actors over his earpiece, but the driver was always cynical of peoples claims.Hed driven far too many bad people to operate under the One Galaxy Republics justice system of innocent until proven guilty.That was something theyd picked up from an old country on Earth before national borders were erased.In the drivers mind, everyone was guilty until proven innocent.Even little girls who sold cookies could possibly be guilty of swindling people out of hard earned money.And as someone who didnt make or have much money, he got tired of that real quick.The driver turned up Starlas heat a notch and looked at the yellow beams of Intergalactic Road 26 in front of him.Come on, man.Dont stare at those beams or you wont ever stop looking at them, the driver told himself.He knew if he stared at the yellow light under Starla, hed fall into its hypnotic gaze and want to sleep all the more.This was his last run of the day.He couldnt take any more.I swear, if I didnt have tomorrow off, Id kill that bastard of a boss, the driver muttered.As Phobos came into view, the driver remembered his clients claim to be actors.He realized that may have been the case as Phobos was nothing more than a giant movie set.It contained small patches of environments used for movies.Hollywood had paid to have the ugly thing terraformed just so movies and television shows could be filmed there.There was a small forest, a two mile wide lake, a jungle, a desert, and even a mountain.Somehow, they fit all that and a hotel for the celebrities to stay in on the small moon that had dimensions measured in just a few kilometers.Starla entered Phobos, and the driver noticed the forest underneath him.The lake was visible not long after going over the forest.At the end of the desert was the hotel.The 50 story gray building was a magnificent piece of work...and itd have to be to contain a shopping mall, bowling alley, archery range, swimming pool, movie theater, and more.Son of a bitch, the driver said, pulling under the large overhang in front of the hotel.Two massive glass doors slid open as the two men he guessed were his clients walked toward the taxi with duffle bags.Following behind them was a heavy set balding man, and he was yelling pretty loud.He was wearing a black suit and red tie, and his arms were flailing about as if independent from his body.The two men walking in front toward the cab were ignoring the balding mans yelling.When they got to the cab one tapped on Starlas trunk.The driver hit a small red button to the left under the steering wheel, and a hiss was sound as hydraulics came to life and the trunk opened.One of the drivers clients was taller than the other and a little lankier.He had long wavy brown hair that covered his ears but didnt go below his shoulders.The other client was a little shorter but built like a brick outhouse.His hair wasnt buzzed, but it was shorter and spikey.The balding man was yelling more, You cant leave yet!We still have five scenes left to shoot before the end of the week!Well see you when we feel like it.Until then, screw off, the client with short hair said, opening the back passenger door and getting into Starla.He slammed the door angrily, and the taller client threw up his arms at the balding guy and said, Look.Just give us a day or two to chill.Don snapped, and I cant guarantee I wont do the same if I dont get off this rock.Let me talk to him, and Ill see what I can do, but until then, you have to give us our space.Gritting his teeth, the balding man was silent as the client with longer hair closed Starlas door.He was much more calm than Don.Okay driver, haul ass to New York City, Don said, leaning back in his seat.The driver turned around to look at his clients.Don was wearing a brown jacket over a white t shirt.He was wearing a pair of expensive jeans and a pair of costly brown boots to go with the shirt.The other client looked at the driver with a glance that said, Youll have to forgive my partner here.He was wearing a blue button down shirt over a green t shirt and khakis.Am I taking you both to New York City?Yes please, the other client said.Sammy, you gonna crash at my place?Maybe we can have a sleepover and braid each others hair.Oh!And we can talk about who Bobbie is going to take to the prom!Shut up, Don.Im only going with you to get you back here in a couple days, Sammy said.I am not coming back for the next two weeks at least, Don said, closing his eyes.Im going to give you two days before I drag your ass back by force, Sammy said.Bring it, idiot, Don said.Moron, Sammy muttered.As Starla began to head back toward Earth, the driver recognized the two men sitting in his back seat, and he didnt know why it took so long for him to.They played brothers on a television drama called Pieces.The two werent related in real life, but they might as well had been.They bickered like brothers, and theyd had plenty of time to get that routine down.Theyd played the same characters for 19 years.Whod have thought Id have Detective Garth Lewis and his partner Cas in the back of my taxi, the driver thought, smiling.He was a few seasons behind, but he did enjoy watching Pieces in his spare time.As Starla took the three men back toward the Earth, the actors began to discuss how long theyd be gone.Don kept trying to negotiate, but Sammy wasnt budging from two days.When a frustrated silence fell over the two, Don leaned forward and asked, So...do you know who we are?I do...Detective Garth, the driver said, smirking.I knew it...I can always sense a fan, Don said.Sammy asked, You watch the show?Yeah...I mean I am a little behind.It has been a few months since I watched an episode, but I think I left off where Cas second wife was killed, the driver said.Poor Meg, Don said, chuckling.The three discussed the show as they drove back toward Earth, and then Sammy asked a question the driver didnt feel comfortable answering.So...do you still like the show?Don turned to look at Sammy, and the driver could sense tension building.This clearly wasnt a question Don wanted asked.That said, the driver was beyond tired, and he didnt shy away from telling the truth even when he was fully rested.I still consider it entertaining, the driver said.Don smiled, leaning back in his seat again.Sammy wasnt quite done with his questions, though.He said, But...?Don scowled and looked at his coworker.But...I do find myself wondering when you two will end it, the driver confessed.Oh Lord...why did you have to say that?Geez, Sammy, Don said.He put his hand over his eyes and sighed.He looked like he had been punched in the gut 20 times.This was clearly a subject Sammy wanted to be on, but Don could not have wanted to be any farther away.Id like to end it with this season.We have a good wrap up, and I think it might be time to move on, Sammy said.Sammy!We have been over this!We are not leaving the show.We have a great thing going here.Why do you want to wreck that?Don...I wanna go out while weve got a good thing going.I told you this on Wednesday.Why havent you processed it yet?Because youre talking nonsense.Ive got nothing to process.You and I are renewing our contracts when we get back, and theyll carry us into season 21, Don said, still scowling.And then what, Don?What do you mean and then what?Then we negotiate for more episodes like we have for the past 19 seasons, Don said.The two continued to bicker about what they wanted to do, and the driver sensed a silence coming up.He figured Sammy would drag him back into their argument, and he didnt want to get involved.He didnt have the energy.He reached down to his left between the seat and door and pulled out a pack of cigarettes.Hed gone through the first half of the pack on the way to Mars, and hed probably finish before he got home.Oh, hey.Could you not smoke please?Ive got asthma, Don said.Or maybe I wont finish these before I get home, the driver thought, grumpily putting the pack back.You dont want the show to end though, right?Don wasnt the drivers favorite person right now, so the driver answered his question candidly.I think the show should have ended when the first director envisioned it to...at the close of season five, the driver said.Don scoffed.Oh...youre one of those fans, he said.Sammy punched him in the shoulder and said, You asked him, remember?Shut up...I dont want to talk to you.You want to ruin what we have going.Don...come on.Im tired of arguing with you.Weve been the same characters since we were 17 years old.Dont you think its time to give something else a try?He looked down and refused to make eye contact with Sammy.These guys are in their 30s...theyve spent the majority of their lives as these characters.I dont blame Don for not wanting to leave his comfort zone, the driver thought.Come on...even you were saying youd like to try movies.You cant do that if youre Detective Garth every year, Sammy said.The space between the actors was practically nonexistent as Earth came into view.I know you didnt ask, but my two cents are...you finish this last season.You go out with a bang, and then you two can move on to other projects, the driver said, chiming in.Don looked over at Sammy and said, You think the fans feel the same way?I think weve worried about the fans for 19 years.Its time to think a little bit about what we want, Sammy said.Starlas engine was the only thing heard for a few minutes until Don said, Take us back.Excuse me?Take us back.I think we have a painful conversation to have with our director, Don said.You got it, the driver said, changing directions in Earths atmosphere and heading back to Phobos.Sammy put his hand on Dons shoulder and said, Thanks.Shut up, idiot.You shut up...moron.The driver sighed.He realized now that by convincing these two actors to move on with their lives, hed added more time to his shift and delayed his own moving on...to bed.Youre both assholes, the driver muttered.4: She Wanted Some Attention  The driver sat in a cafe.He hated coffee, but there was something about the environment of coffee drinkers he always admired.They lived in their own world, poets, word magicians, sorcerers of syllables.The driver also hated all the healthy food cafes served, so, he couldnt figure out why he occasionally tried different ones for breakfast in the morning.He sat in a red leather chair looking over the days news on a glass tablet computer.It had an 11 inch screen and was completely transparent except for the content he was viewing.His eyes moved from left to right as he read a story about a small group of freedom fighters who killed a cop in Istanbul.The driver had given his breakfast an honest attempt before giving up altogether.He liked greasy food for breakfast...sausage...bacon...fried potatoes...but what sat at his side was none of those things.I didnt think you could screw up a sausage biscuit, the driver muttered as his stomach growled.His eyes wandered over to what the cashier had said was a piece of sausage on an English muffin.The bread was completely flat and tasted weird.Its texture betrayed the driver, and that made him angry.On his right he had a glass of milk that hed finished half of.It took that much to wash the horrid taste of the nasty flat bread from his tongue.Quit looking at me.You had your chance to be my breakfast.Now youre going to be fed to that dog outside as soon as I finish my milk, the driver muttered, looking at the pathetic breakfast hed attempted to eat.His earpiece buzzed, which meant that in another second or two, hed be getting directions to his next passenger.The driver took off his brown pub hat and scratched his shaggy brown hair.Driver 2269, a passenger has requested a ride from the Neo Rome back to Earth, a womans voice said.Roger that.Ill head that way, the driver said, reaching over to grab the last of his milk.After finishing it in two gulps, he grabbed his breakfast and put the glass tablet back on the table in front of him.The sliding glass door leading out of the cafe opened up, revealing a large crowded walkway encased in metal and glass.The cafe was part of a floating plaza.Dozens orbited the Earth and usually contained three or four different shops and restaurants that travelers would stop at.This one was a little out of the drivers route, but he got up a little early to try the cafes breakfast...unfortunately for him, it wasnt worth the trip.Along with the cafe was a bookstore next door and a small shipping warehouse on the other side.The entire plaza was encased in glass and had its own atmospheric controls and stabilizers to keep the place level and full of artificial gravity.The entire plaza must have been about 300 yards long and at least half that wide.Lying down outside the cafe tied to a metal sign was a red husky.The driver approached slowly, but the dog didnt get up.Its owner was inside drinking coffee with her girlfriends, and the dog was docile enough not to care too much.It had faith she would return within 30 to 60 minutes and finish the walk theyd started.The huskys ears picked up as he approached.Now that the driver got a good look at the creature, he realized it was an older dog.The fur was faded somewhat in color, and it explained how the animal was so calm with all these people walking by.The driver respected its calm demeanor and slowly head out a hand for the dog to sniff before moving any closer.The animal lifted its nose to his hand and smelled it.Deciding the driver wasnt a threat, it stretched and slowly got up on all fours to greet its new potential friend.As it rolled over on its side stretching, the driver saw he was dealing with a girl dog.He placed the English muffin in front of the husky, and the animal proved she wasnt as picky about her food as the driver.She chowed down on the thing while the driver patted her head.Her left eye was brown while her right eye was blue, and she had tiny patches of white fur above her eyes that looked like eyebrows.Youre quite a beautiful gal, you know that?It was then that the driver heard yelling.Before he could look back into the Comet Cafe, a gunshot rattled off, and a man with a small revolver ran out the door before it could even fully open.He didnt notice the driver, but the driver noticed him well.He had slicked back black hair with spiky bangs facing downward.His red eyes were long and narrow, and he was wearing jeans and a denim jacket.The gunman took off running for the port and was gone rather quickly.The husky didnt appear scared, but she was keenly aware of the commotion.Authorities and paramedics showed up within minutes, but the commotion settled down when it was clear that the victim of the gunshot was dead.They moved her carefully out into the walkway on a hover stretcher.Her face hadnt been covered yet, and the driver noticed at once that it was the huskys owner.Her pretty young face now forever frozen in a look of shock was quickly covered with a white sheet, leaving only her blonde hair to see.The dog noticed her too and began to bark and pull on its leash.One of the officers walked over to the dog and the driver.My name is Lieutenant Bradley with the One Galaxy Republic Law Enforcement Division.Did you get a good look at the suspect?I did.You got a pen and paper?The lieutenant, a larger bald black man reached into the pocket of his black pants and pulled out a small notepad.He opened it and pulled a small pencil out from the top of the notepad.
