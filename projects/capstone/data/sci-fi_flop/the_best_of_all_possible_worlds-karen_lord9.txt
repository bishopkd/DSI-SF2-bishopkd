If youre getting any bright ideas that might help those two, youd better share.Do something without thinking it to death for a change.I didnt get it.Qeturah toed the line and he was fine with that, yet hed written me off because I hadnt been enough of a maverick.I was peeved and let him know it.Enough, Sergeant, I said sharply.Central Governments taking care of Kirtahsg, so stop blaming me for that.Besides, I have at least as much reason as you to care about what happens to Lian and a hell of a lot more reason when it comes to Joral.I took the comm from him and examined it curiously.It was a top of the line military grade comm, far better than any wrist model or civilian handheld.Bullshit, he said.Sadiri or Cygnian, were all endangered when were facing death.Got anything useful to contribute, maam?I looked at him and wished for a moment that I was on better terms with this man.I might.But Ill need to take this comm with me, just for an hour or two.I was lying.I didnt know how much time I needed.He swore under his breath.I stared at him impassively.You can choose to say no, Sergeant, but say it quickly.Times wasting.Big bluff.I hoped it would impress him just a little.Was that Qeturahs trick?Act as if youre in command, and suddenly theyll start following your orders?Take the damned comm, he said at last in resignation.I took it all right.I took it straight to Dllenahkh.Youre staying at the Sadiri Consulate while youre working in the city, right?He raised an eyebrow at the incongruous juxtaposition of the mundane question and my conspiratorial whisper.Yes.Any way to get an immediate private audience with your pilot friend?The man whos seen things mere mortals only dream of?The man whos been to several futures and who may or may not have the advanced technological know how to use the fact that Ferguss comm is still picking up a clear signal from Lians halfway across the globe and through a ton of rock?Dllenahkh then did something completely Sadiri and utterly adorable.He blinked at my babbled words, filled in the blanks speedily, and arrived at a course of action.Come with me, he said.Our leaving broke up the meeting.Qeturah looked a little bemused, but Fergus gave me a stiff yet encouraging nod.I so badly wanted to tell Nasiha and Tarik, but I didnt dare risk the possibility that they werent supposed to know about Naraldis unique experiences.They hardly noticed.They were once more wrapped up in each other, and this time I didnt mind one bit.Thank you, Dllenahkh, I said as I got into his aircar and belted myself in.He frowned in puzzlement as he tapped in our destination.Why are you thanking me?I havent done anything yet.You listen to my crazy ideas and make sense out of them.Thats worth some thanks.He let the autopilot take us and turned to face me, eyes flashing.What you describe as the product of a mental imbalance, I would classify as swift, intuitive thinking to arrive at creative solutions.There is no passion like the passion of a Sadiri complimenting your mind.For a moment I was speechless, completely speechless.I gawked up at him like a lovestruck teenager.Youyou really mean that.You know that I do.Why is it so difficult for you to believe that?I rested my hand over his, a gesture of apology and truce.I believe it, I said softly.He looked down at my hand and slowly turned his so that we fitted palm to palm.Touching him was never a simple matter, but touching him now, when his emotions were so close to the surface, was like standing on the seashore with the tide drawing out, pulling the sand from under my feet.I wanted to fall into the water.The aircar smoothly grounded.The Sadiri Consulate is in fact very close to Central Government Headquarters.Were here, I said, trying not to sound disappointed.A quick comm call to the Consul ensured that he was at least a little prepared when we invaded his living room for an impromptu meeting.He was too professional to show irritation in front of me, but he still managed to give Dllenahkh a very pointed look when he said, I believe it was clearly stated that you were to tell no one about my travels.Dllenahkh was unperturbed.Im sorry, Naraldi.I was under the impression that the restriction did not apply to Sadiri above a certain level of government.The Consul looked at mein fact, he looked at my head and its fuzz of dull brown hairin silent comment at the un Sadiri sight of me, then surrendered with a small shrug.Show me the communicator.I handed it over and watched him excitedly as he opened it up and pondered the innards, taking occasional glances at a handheld for reference notes.Then he sat back, eyes narrowing as he contemplated his drumming fingers for further enlightenment.Eventually, he returned to the handheld and made some quick audio and written inputs, at least one of which was a message by the distinctive sound of the send chime.At last, he pulled a datachip out of his handheld, stood, and gave it to Dllenahkh.Dllenahkh, if you will permit the indignity to your position, kindly deliver this personally to the Consulates communications office.It is of a sensitive nature and must go out as soon as possible.Dllenahkh bowed, gave me a quick reassuring glance, and left the room.I watched him go, feeling even more lost than before.Your Excellency, I said plaintively, could you tell me whats happening?The Consul sat down again, his expression suddenly tired.Can I, or should I?I do not want to raise your hopes unduly, Ms.Delarua.You assumed correctlyI do have technological knowledge that might result in a swifter rescuebut knowledge can only go so far.I would need a certain level of existing technology to effect a quick solution, and such technology is not yet available.My heart sank.He saw how my face changed and relented.There is a small hope.I have sent a message for help.I cannot be sure it will be answered, but I can do no more.Who is it?How long will they take to get here?For all that I tried not to sound excited, the words still came out too quickly, too eagerly.He lowered his eyes, and his jaw tensed as if he were biting back words.After a brief silence, he sighed and answered, I am sorry, Ms.Delarua.I really couldnt say.I opened my mouth to plead with him, then paused, closed my mouth, and frowned slightly.Couldnt say, I repeated.His quick upward glance begged me to understand.Couldnt.My heart began to pound.I swallowed and tried to compose myself.I think I understand you, Your Excellency.At leastI hope I do.THE UNLIKELY ANGEL On the first day after I spoke to the Sadiri Consul, I went to visit my mother.This was a bit of a mistake because Maria and Grace were still there, Rafi was only home from school every other weekend, and my mother had taken to spending long periods of time at another retiree friend whose apartment was uncluttered by offspring.Okay, perhaps that sounds a little unkind, but that was my first impression of the situation.Then, when I got there, I was entirely on my mothers side.Maria was refusing to continue therapywait, refusing is too strong a word.She was apathetic.Gracie was at the other extreme, suddenly acting out after years of suppression.My mother was at her wits end and would escape for a little sanity from time to time.Darling, shes my daughter, and I love her, but shes making me crazy, my mother confessed to me.We were sitting on her balcony, plotting strategy and carefully ignoring the yells coming from the kitchen as Maria struggled to get Gracie to finish eating lunch.I put on my dead calm, responsible voice.This family already has its full quota of crazy, Mom.Lets not go over the edge.Therell be no one left to act as anchor.Well, what can I do?I mean, I was even thinking about proposing to Connie just to have an excuse to get out of the house permanently.Then I could leave this place to Maria and I blinked.Proposing to Connie?What happened to the guy you kept talking aboutDavi was his name?Well, dear, she said, lowering her voice to a hushed whisper, I didnt want to shock you, but it was Connie I meant all along.Davis her husband, but I think Ive almost persuaded her that shes better off without him.I tilted my head and pondered.Mom, I said, youre still a homesteader at heart, so Ill say this gently.Are you sure shes interested in you or is it both of them?My mother began to scoff, paused, and looked suddenly startled, then confused.Right; then it seems to me wed better make sure you hold on to your apartment for a little while longer.Better if Maria and Gracie come to my apartment.Ill be doing more work down on the Sadiri settlement anyway, and itll be harder for her to avoid therapy when shes near all the best institutes.But, dear, my mother protested, are you sure you want to do that?I mean, unless theres someone youre thinking of moving in with, I wouldnt wish Maria on you either.Too much Ntshune in my family.Too damn much.Her eyes lit up.There is someone, she said, leaning forward avidly.Go on!Whats he like?How old is he?Oh, it is a he, isnt it?Hes Sadiri.Furthermore, hes a Sadiri savant who is, in fact, older than you.But I think we were discussing your love life?I chided her with lofty dignity.Oh.I do seem to have made a mess of that, she said ruefully.I zapped a contact from my comm to hers.There.Thats my friend Gilda.Shes lovely and approachable and will give you all kinds of good advice about negotiating the currents of city polyamory.Justdont date her.Please.I would find that awkward.I picked up my handheld.Im making arrangements for Maria to move into my apartment within a couple of weeks.Please find a way to talk her into it by then.Ill do my best to push her back to therapy, but I think even a part time job would work wonders.The credits from the divorce and compensation are only going to last so long, anyway.Now, hows Rafi?Terribly unhappy, she admitted, looking very distressed.I felt a pang of dismay.Shed been our rock all the time we were growing up.She shouldnt have to shoulder these burdens at her age.Never mind.Ill go see him tomorrow.Thus it was that on the second day after the Consul sent for help, I went to visit my nephew at his boarding school.Fortunately, Rafi wasnt so much terribly unhappy as quite naturally stressed by the new environment and the fact that he had come into it in the middle of the school year, when friendships are already sealed and group allegiances formed.He also viewed his being there as a kind of sentence rather than a privilege and a mark of distinction from the average Cygnian.We walked the immaculate school grounds, and I tried my best to cheer him up.They all show off so much.Talking mind to mind.Levitating scraps of paper, even, he said, glum and resistant to consoling.I looked him over, noting his extra six centimeters of height and a face that was moving from cute to handsome with less adolescent awkwardness than the norm.He could be popular.He must not be trying.Ive seen your psi profile.Youre stronger than any of them.Why dont you show off a little yourself?He shrugged.I could make everyone like me, but that sort of thing is frowned upon, oddly enough.As for the telepathytheres no one I really want to talk to, I guess.Hmm, I said.Whos in charge of your welfare around here?My House Master, I suppose.Why?He looked a little wary.Dont embarrass me.I gave him an incredulous look.When have I ever not been cool?Dont turn all teenage on me now.Just answer me one thing.Do you still like elephants?A quick consultation with his House Master ensured that Rafi and one other student would spend the next half term holiday on an educational visit to the forest uplands.Theres more than one way to be popular, my boy, I told him as I was leaving.Elephants are cool.Eccentric aunts who send you and a fortunate friend to ride on elephants, they too are cool.Youre lucky Ive had no reason to dip into my holiday fund this year.I cant do this too often.Anyway, once should be enough to seal your reputation.He grinned at me.He knew I was up to something, more than was evident on the surface, but he trusted me enough to be amused and excited rather than worried.And by the way, I added, Id practice my telepathy while I was out there if I were you.Loudly.Vacation is no reason to slack off.Transferring the lease on my apartment and spending such a large sum on impulse meant that I had to consider my future sooner rather than later.And so on the third day after the Consuls leap of faith, I collared Nasiha in her temporary office at the Sadiri Consulate and asked bluntly, Want to work with me?She raised an eyebrow.You appear to have made certain assumptions about my future plans.Or perhaps Im trying to influence them.She smiled then, just a little.I had noticed that in spite of the fact that your breach of the Cygnian Science Code has caused you to be barred from empirical research, you have somehow managed to become the cause of academic papers by others.I would welcome the opportunity to examine the phenomenon further by continuing our association within an entrepreneurial framework.Tarik?I asked.It was interesting, this new vocal shorthand.I was finally living my life as if I had no time to waste.Nasihas gaze softened, and I was reminded just how much those two did love each other, although they would have found some other way to phrase it, no doubt.We have assessed various locations in terms of safety, stability, and support networks.We have decided to spend at least one year living in the Tlaxce Sadiri Settlement so that our child can be born there.After that, Tarik will probably return to working with the Science Council while I remain as primary parent for the first seven years.At the end of those seven yearswho knows?I may return to the Science Council while he becomes the primary parent.We may all return to New Sadira or to whatever planet we may be assigned.But that is in the future.I smiled.Tarik is a good husband and will make an excellent father.He loves you so much.Nasiha gave me an amused look.Of course.And I love him.For two days after that I didnt try to save the world or solve anyones problems.I worked on my reports diligently from home, having wisely turned down the offer of office space at the Sadiri Consulate.With everything that was happening, I didnt trust my professionalism that far.At home, I could at least periodically get up from my desk, look at the calendar, and scream into a pillow set aside for that purpose.Then I got a call from Dr.Freyda Mar herself.I heard youd come in, but I thought I should wait a bit.Im so sorry, she said.Freyda, its so good to hear from you.In spite of everything, I smiled when I heard her voice.Things have been a bit grim, but where theres life, theres hope.Thats so, she agreed.Look, Im going down to the homesteadings this afternoon to start the weeks rounds.Would you like to come with me?My gaze drifted to my handheld.I had been checking my messages in the minutes before Freydas call.A rather large number of the messages were from Fergusseveral variations on the tune of his comm and the fact that I had not returned it, no doubt.Since I had last seen it in bits and pieces in the Consuls living room, I was beginning to think that it might be a prudent move to try a change of scenery.Why, thank you, Freyda!Thatd be perfect.We can catch up.Freyda was as kind as ever.She opted for nav but no autopilot so that I wouldnt feel pressured to make small talk for the entire journey.I dived right into the important stuff, using my new blunt and direct mode.You and Lanuri.Progress?Her face was calm, her tone lighthearted.You are aware, Ms.Delarua, that government officials are not encouraged to fraternize with colleagues.It might interfere with efficiency.What they do at the end of the assignment is, of course, their own business.Entirely appropriate, I agreed.There was a small silence, and then we burst out laughing.I can play Sadiri for about ten minutes, tops, I admitted.Longer if Im really concentrating.So, you guys looking to get married soon after?She nodded happily.Yeah.Its funny; I didnt even have to make any moves.Once I started looking at things differently, it all seemed to unfold naturally somehow.How do you attract a Sadiris attention?Sound intelligent, she answered.Tell them something they didnt know or hadnt figured out for themselves.How do you know youve got their attention?Intensity like whoa, I said immediately.They drop everything and listen to you and then come up with all kinds of reasons to keep you around.How do you know they like you?Unusually touchy.Brushing fingers when handing you a cup or a handheld.Protective, solicitous behavior.Very quick to catch you if you stumble or lose footing, very concerned if youre unwell.Personal distance decreases significantly.Then one day, next thing you know, hes holding your hand and gazing into your eyes, she concluded dreamily.But do you ever kiss?I wanted to ask that really badly.I just smiled instead.She smiled too.And you?Better ask when my assignments formally over, Dr.Mar, I said archly.Then I fell silent, remembering the number of days till then and also the unknown number of days before the Consuls miracle would arrive.Might arrive.When we reached Lanuris office, he greeted me with unexpected warmth, clasping my hand and saying, It is fitting that you should be here for the memorial.What memorial?I asked, confused.He looked slightly concerned.You have not received word?The rescue has been called off.Increased seismic activity in the area has made it impossible for excavation to continue safely.The unopened messages from Fergus, I thought.The room slid slowly to one side, and I was surprised to find that Freyda was gripping me by the shoulders.I shrugged her off.Im all right, I insisted.I took a step and swayed.I just need to sit down for a bit, I amended in a small voice.They were very attentive.They took me to Lanuris residence and made me sit still and drink tea.It was all I could do.My brain simply shut off, refusing to accept any possibility that I would never again hear Lians laugh and Jorals earnest voice.The following day, I was at a Sadiri memorial service or, as I preferred to call it, a funeral for bodies that were very likely still breathing.Two memory trees were planted before the Local Council Hall in a ceremony that was a curious mix of Cygnian and Sadiri traditions, and then the attendees retired to the Hall for a few solemn minutes of awkward interaction.I found it indecent.They could have waited, I said angrily.Nasiha, who didnt even know about the Consuls call for help, also found it unseemly, but she tried to excuse it.The chances of survival are now negligible, she stated, her morose expression suggesting that she disliked the sound of her words even more than I did.Furthermore, the council was of the opinion that delaying the customary rituals would give the event more weight than is warranted.Its the settlements first funeral, I murmured.Yes.And there will be more, in time.That is the point.These young men must learn to face death again.But couldnt they at least have waited till we knew for sure?I demanded.She shrugged.They have no reason to believe in miracles.I do, I said fiercely.There was, however, a limit to the sympathy Nasiha and I could share.Thank God for Freyda Mar, because we exchanged a single glance across the crowded room, made our excuses, then went together to a private corner, fell into each others arms, and wept silently for fifteen minutes or so.How did you know?I asked her when we had both composed ourselves.She smiled ruefully.Lanuri says that when I want a hug but Im afraid to ask for it, I clasp my hands behind my back.Youve been gripping your wrists for the past hour now.I had been trying to avoid even the sight of Dllenahkh, afraid to ask him if he had any news, afraid to glimpse something in his eyes that might destroy my hope, but when she said that, I had a yearning to go find him.He seemed to know I wanted him, because the moment I looked in his direction, he disengaged himself from a knot of grim faced councillors and came toward me.Delarua, he said abruptly, where are you staying?Dr.Lanuris residence.Im going back to the City with Freyda tomorrow, when shes finished her rounds, I replied.Come back with me now.Okay, I said immediately.On the way there he explained to me what needed to be done.Naraldi does not wish to involve himself directly, nor does he wish the Consulate to be implicated in any way.I have the reassembled comm.He wants you to take it and wait at your apartment.Someone will come to you at the designated time.I looked at him, looked at him properly, and dared to allow myself to feel.When did you sleep last?I asked quietly.He glanced aside in that way he had when he was hesitating to speak the truth.I How many times had we slept in a groundcar on autopilot?Too many times.I touched the controls, darkening the windows and adjusting the seating.Take a nap.We can talk when we get to the City.We lay down side by side.Dllenahkh started to move, hesitated, and then reached out to place his hand gently on the side of my face, reminding me of the time he had helped heal me.Instead of the expected delicate brush, a heavy warmth poured into my brain.It felt like nothing Id experienced with him before.What are you doing?I asked, holding very still.Making sure you wont forget anything, he replied in a near whisper.I would have questioned him further, but before I could, I fell into a deep sleep.And so, the following day, the eighth day after meeting with the Consul, I nervously waited in my apartment, holding the comm in my hand.I didnt know what to expect.Would there be a mundane buzz at my door?Would the heavens open and the earth shake?I knew neither who nor how in this adventure, and the only thing that was keeping me sitting expectantly in my living room was faith.The reality was somewhere between the two extremes of my imagination.First there was a voice, a very ordinary voice except for the fact that it seemed to be coming out of thin air.It said simply, Naraldi sent me.Then I blinkedand there it was.I jumped out of my chair.It was too bizarre to inspire awe.I had never seen a Sadiri mindship in real life, but I knew their look, something like a manta ray, very smooth and dark and naturally designed to slip through any tear in the fabric of space time.Not only was this like nothing I had imagined, I was sure it was like nothing anyone had imagined.It kept to the oceanic theme, at least, for it resembled the keel of a boat, all carved and sanded wood in the shape of a high, curving bow.But there was no boat, only a tall figure wearing a close fitting metallic jumpsuit and a helmet, with one hand resting on the wood as if keeping the keel upright.Was there an invisible boat attached?I stared.Oh, good.You didnt scream, or fall down, or run away.The voice was slightly muffled at the beginning, and then the shining helmet was removed to reveal an equally shining face and a wide, white cloud of hair.I quickly revised my interpretation of what I was seeing.I should, I said reproachfully to the gilded stranger.Youre naked.He looked down nervously, then gave me a stern look.Dont scare me like that.I havent lost pubic sphincter control since I was twelve.Oh?I said faintly.A worried expression came over his face.That was a joke.Please dont take me seriously.Pubic sphincter.As if there could be such a thing.He gave a short, awkward laugh, then shut up and looked at me sheepishly.The conversation was getting away from me, getting away from any semblance of common sense, in fact, so I tried to bring it back under control.Im Grace Delarua.How do you do?I said, stepping forward and holding out my hand.The stranger eyed my hand, then looked at me doubtfully.He put his helmet back on, this time with the faceplate open, and reached out to me.Well, if youre sure.It was only in the moment when the brass bright skin touched mine that it struck me why this would be a bad idea.Too late.The world vanished.I shut my eyes tightly and tried to scream, but it wasnt working.The strangers voice rang clearly in my head, sounding disconcertingly like my own tone and rhythm and idiolect.You can call me Sayr, by the way.I didnt think youd want to travel with me.I just came to get the comm so Id have a point of reference, but this ways good too.Ahhhhh!I finally managed to make some noise.It echoed so loudly that I opened my eyes immediately.There was nothing before me but a pure, rich darkness that made me welcome the solid feel of rock under my feet, because without it I would have imagined myself floating in outer space.Suddenly, a glow appeared to my left, making me jump.Sayrs entire arm had gone luminescent, and he was studying a faint overlay of lines on it.For a bemused instant, I wondered why he was looking at his veins, and then I realized it was a map.So this is where you were when you saw the light come through.Hmm.The terrain has changed quite a bit.Would you like to try calling your friends?I hesitated: one second to understand that I was on the other side of the world, once more underground in the abandoned city; two seconds to wonder whether Sayr was human or machine or both; and one more second to remember and be grateful for Ferguss comm still held tightly in my left hand.I turned it on, fumbled with the lit control panel, and selected Lians ID.Unavailable.Leave a message.It wasnt even Lians voice, just the generic recording.I held the comm out mutely to Sayr.His eyes widened and glittered in the dark, reflecting the glow of the comm display.Ive found them, he said.The comm went dark as the connection cut out, and for a moment I was convinced I was alone in the dark.Then I told myself not to be silly.As if Sayr would leave me alone in a derelict mine with an active volcano rumbling nearby.That would be irresponsible.He was probably in deep thought or something.I tried to be quiet so as not to disturb him.His voice rang out so close, so sudden, that I almost fell down in sheer fright.Sorry I didnt take you, but its easier when there arent any collective memories What?You left me here?I squeaked.It was too much.I immediately began to hyperventilate.Bright sunlight seared my vision, and icy air pricked my skin.I gasped and screwed up my face, but at least the shock put an end to my dry sobbing.When I was finally able to squint my eyes open again, it was to see Sayr standing close to his keel, one hand in the usual rest position on his transport and the other patting me reassuringly on the shoulder.Look, he urged.There they are.Theyre calling Emergency Services now.Everything will be fine.We were on a hill, where exactly I wasnt sure, but it was cold enough that I knew we were still near the polar regions.There were indeed two figures, tiny in the distance, heartwarmingly familiar and blessedly alive.They sat huddled together, arms around each other.I stopped shivering with cold for a moment to shiver with pure joy.I had no more time to be sentimental.In another twinkling of an eye, we were back in my living room.Thanks for the experience.Sorry I cant stay longer.His face went from friendly to serious, and I knew what was coming next.Wait!I wailed.Before you wipe my memory, cant I ask you some questions?A question?Just one question, please?Sayr paused, eyeing me warily as if suspecting me of employing delaying tactics, which might have been partly true.What would be the point if you cant remember the answer anyway?Id have a sense of satisfaction, I said, guessing wildly.That would be enough.Let me hear the question, he said, still wary.I took a deep breath.This was my chance to find out the meaning of life.Is it true that the Caretakers save people who are essential to the human race?The words were rushed and inelegant, but I couldnt risk waiting in case he changed his mind.Fortunately, the query appeared to interest him.Thats a complicated question.It has a complicated answer to go with it.Thats fine, I said encouragingly.I sat down in a chair and raised my hands hopefully, trying to project the image of a supplicant who would be grateful for the merest scrap.His face relaxed, slightly amused at my eagerness.Im going to tell you in such a way that youll remember the answer but not the question or the asking of it.I suppressed a wriggle of excitement that would have been most unbecoming to my mature years.He left the keel standing by itself at the edge of the room, settled himself cross legged on the floor, and began.In the beginning, God created human beings, which is to say God put the ingredients together, embedded the instructions for building on the template, and put it all into four separate eggs marked Some Assembly Required.One egg was thrown down to Sadira.There humanity grew to revere and develop the powers of the mind.Another egg was sent to Ntshune, and the humans who arose there became adept at dealing with matters of the heart.A third egg arrived at Zhinu, and there the focus was on the body, both natural and man made.The last egg came to Terra, and these humans were unmatched in spirit.Strong in belief, they developed minds to speculate and debate, hearts to deplore and adore, and bodies to craft and adapt.Such were their minds, hearts, and bodies that they soon began to rival their elder siblings.When the children of God saw the Terrans and their many ways of being human, they were both impressed and appalled.Some declared, See how they combine the four aspects of humanness!Through Terra, all will be transformedSadira, Ntshune, and Zhinuinto one harmonious whole.Others predicted, How can any group survive such fragmentation?They will kill one another, and the rest of humanity will remain forever incomplete.After some discussion, it was decided to seal off Terra from the rest of the galaxy until Terran civilization reached full maturity.It was also decided to periodically save them from themselves by placing endangered Terrans where they could flourish and begin to mix with other humans.He smiled as he concluded, And that, my dear, is five creation myths for the price of one.Are you satisfied?Thats a childs bedtime story, I said, but not too critically, because Id actually enjoyed it.Sayr shrugged.Doesnt make it any less true.Are you a child of God?I asked, keeping my tone light and conversational.He didnt buy it.Arent we all?One question only, my dear.Now, if youll forgive me, this wont take a second.There was a silence.Sayr began to frown.I looked at him anxiously, baffled at his growing irritation.I see youve been memory protected, Sayr sniffed.This is such a difficult time period to work in.You people know too much already, and you always want to know more.Youll have to come with me.No!I insisted, beginning to panic again.Im home and safe, and Im not going anywhere else with you and thatthing!Frustration edged his voice.Stop hyperventilating.You know I wont force you to come with me.But you leave me with no choice.Im sorry, but Ill have to do it the old fashioned way.He stood up, glaring at me, but the glare transformed once more into that sheepish expression.Youyou wouldnt happen to have any alcohol handy, would you?I had two bottles.One was a lovely, light, triple distilled spirit made with honey, spices, and herbs that Id picked up on my travels and was saving for a special occasion.The other was an utterly miserable sherry that someone had given me in one of those office gift exchange things about two years previously.I punished Sayr by making him drink one glass of sherry for every two glasses of spirits he had me guzzle.Unfortunately for my thirst for vengeance, I was only able to force him to endure two glasses.After that, I was hugging the bottle with one arm and holding him with the other, and I was far too cheerful to care when he danced us closer to the keel and got his hand onto it.The room vanished, to be replaced by another, unfamiliar room, dimly lit and exuding the stillness of a workplace in after hours mode.I stumbled forward, unsupported, my gentle abductor having absconded for parts unknown.To my great relief, there was another body nearby to lean on.Dllenahkh was there to meet me.He greeted me warmlyyes, warmly!I know what the word means!He hugged me!Or helped me stand upright.Maybe.But he was happy!He was practically burning with it.You cant mistake something like that.Then I looked around and was moved to comment.This isnt my apartment, I said indignantly.No, indeed.We are in the Consulate, Dllenahkh replied.Now, why did he?I frowned, trying to think.What happened?I thought this was supposed to end in alcoholic amnesia.The last two words came out a little garbled.I pressed my fingers to my face, trying to wake up the numb patches.We grew concerned when we did not hear from you, so Naraldi contacted Sayr.After Sayr briefed us on the situation, Naraldi advised him that alcohol poisoning was not the best way to approach the problem.I recommended that he bring you here instead as soon as possible.Just put your arm about my waist.There.Now this waynothe other direction This explained the times when Sayr had been muttering grimly to himself.I thought hed merely been cursing the sherry under his breath.But where are we going?I asked after a while.To Central Government Headquarters.The rest of the team will meet us there.What about the Consul?I whispered to him as we navigated the corridors.Id like to see him before we go.Thank him.He is occupied in his office, but I believe he would not mind seeing you, Dllenahkh replied.Try to focus.It will dispel some of the alcohols effects, and you will be able to speak more clearly.I breathed deeply, brought myself under some control just as Nasiha had taught me, and steadied my steps.By the time we reached the corridor to the Consuls office, I was faking sobriety pretty well.Im ready, I declared.Dllenahkh smiled slightly.Take your time.Wait here.He went to a door a few meters away and pressed for admittance.The door opened and stayed open, which is how I got to hear everything.Ah, Dllenahkh.We were just talking about you.All is well?Yes, Naraldi.I contacted Emergency Services, and they were able to confirm that Lian and Joral are both expected to make a full recovery.I am about to depart for Central Government Headquarters to meet with the other members of the mission team, but Ms.Delarua expressed a wish to thank you personally before we go.She is waiting outside.Naraldi immediately came to the door, looking out rather than inviting me in.I stood straight and tried to look professional, discreetly putting my handsand the bottlebehind my back.Your Excellency, I said with a very small, very careful bow.Thank you so much for all your help.He walked toward me, Dllenahkh following close behind.Ms.Delarua.I am glad to see that you have proved yourself more than competent in your post.Thank you for seeking me out and inspiring me to ask something I would not have thought to ask.Fortune favors the audacious, apparently.Dllenahkh came to stand next to me, radiating such an aura of satisfaction that youd have thought the Consuls words had been intended for him.Ms.Delarua has long been an asset to our settlement.Providing insightful solutions to unforeseen problems is a talent of hers.The Consul looked at us steadily, such a look as made me surreptitiously step a little farther away from Dllenahkh, out of his personal space.I see.And this would be why you protect her from mental tampering?To maintain her talents at their peak?He slowly shook his head in mock sorrow, and I realized with a jolt that this was Dllenahkhs Lian, the one person who would always notice when the kohl had been applied and be happy to point it out too.I wish you well, he continued with a smile and nod to each of us, making the pronoun plural.We gave him our good wishes in turn, and then, still emboldened by alcohol, I raised my voice for the silent visitor in the Consuls office.Thank you, Sayr!There was a pause, and then a voice cautiously sang out, Youre welcome!The Consul regarded me with a mixture of amusement and mild reproach.And thank you too, Naraldi, I repeated softly and far more soberly.Im sorry about what happened to Sadira.You helped save two dear friends today.That means a lot to me.He bowed his head, perhaps in farewell, perhaps to hide the fact that his eyes were suddenly shining with tears.Then he went back into the office and closed the door.It was a poignant moment that I spoiled by suddenly smacking my forehead.What is it?asked Dllenahkh in concern.I left Ferguss comm underground, I exclaimed.I looked down regretfully at the bottle in my hand.I hope hell accept some honey spirit instead.Zero hour plus two years twenty days The Regular Meeting of the Sadiri Council on Cygnus Beta had recently concluded.Councillors gathered in the anteroom of the Council Hall, taking refreshment and talking among themselves.They seemed far more relaxed than usual, and Dllenahkh wondered if the gravitas and endless debate of the early days of their founding had been mere posturing to hide a fear of inadequacy.But then again, he thought, relenting, perhaps that was an uncharitable view.After all, there had been a lot of good news of late: Jorals safe return to the settlement, new ties with what were now called the heritage communities, and an increasing number of betrothals and marriages between Sadiri and taSadiri.There was much to celebrate.Congratulations, Naraldi said, appearing at his side with cup in hand.Im glad to see that the council knows how to reward success.Dllenahkh sipped at his drink and grimaced, a reaction that was only partly due to the strength of the tart, sweet cordial.Then why does this reward feel like another task?Perhaps it is, and if so, you have only to succeed again.Look at youyou could be an elder in truth.Now its only a small homestead on a spare bit of council land; in the future it becomes an odd name on a map, the ancient town of Dllenahkh, founded by some obscure civil servant a year or two after the Scattering.Dllenahkh opened his mouth to ask if Naraldi had seen such a thing, realized very quickly that he had absolutely no desire to find out, and changed his question.Will you come visit?You can stay as long as you wish.He held Naraldis gaze slightly longer than would be required for an innocent query.Naraldi narrowed his eyes, understanding.So, you have heard.More than that.I can see the evidence with my own eyes.If it continues, if the Sadiri Government doesnt remove you as Consul, there are going to be some awkward questions asked.We must keep it quiet for now.Perhaps I will simplybounce back to my age before my travels, but the doctors cannot tell me what caused it to begin or how long it will continue.They want me to go to New Sadira to be monitored.Naraldi sighed deeply.It is hard enough being tied to one planet.The debriefing period after my travels was long and arduous, but I had some freedoms.This time I suspect they plan to permanently confine me to a room filled with sensors and scanners.Dont let them, Dllenahkh said abruptly.Youre still a pilot, arent you?Ask for a ship.It was beautiful to see the hope brightening Naraldis face.You think ?And yet, if old age was their only excuse for retiring me, why not?He touched his bare scalp with a smile that was almost shy.I shall have to let my hair grow again.But discreetly, Dllenahkh warned teasingly.Remember, there will be less gray than before.Naraldi looked around, still with that sheepish smile, like a boy expecting to be caught in a prank.I will visit, he proclaimed in a whisper.When they give me a ship, I will come to see you in your new domain.It was clear from his demeanor that he did not mean a common docking in orbit and a mundane transit to the surface.You wouldnt, Dllenahkh whispered back, but it came out sounding more like a dare than an admonishment.Was this age regression contagious?I would, and I will!I have mastered the art of safe, clandestine planetfall.How else do you think I managed during my travels?Dllenahkh was about to answer when a strange sight distracted him.Councillor Haan, one of the more sedate and self important members of the council, stood nearby, shoulders bent and shaking with silent laughter, tears pouring from the corners of his eyes.Two other councillors beside him were grinning happily, completely unsurprised at this unusual behavior from their colleague.Dllenahkh stared at them, then glared at the liquid in his cup.Fireberry cordial, he guessed.Dont drink any more, Naraldi, its Dllenahkh, youve been away from home for too long.Of course its fireberry.Its almost a tradition after council meetings these days.Theyre better for it, if you ask me.Oh, dont look like that.I forget youre a purist.Here.Naraldi kindly and gently removed the cup from Dllenahkhs hand.Let me take care of that for you.AN IDEAL HUSBAND Okay, now that all the unpleasantness is over, I can talk to you about something important, Gilda said with hushed excitement.I narrowed my eyes at her with suspicion, took a sip of my cocktail, and waited.So?You.Him.Whats it like?She halted me as I began to open my mouth.And dont you dare say who?or whats what like?or anything so silly.The last reports had been submitted, and the end of mission ceremony and reception were finally taking place with all team members present and accounted for.There had been a bit of silly media, like those who wanted to turn Lian and Jorals story into a romantic holo, but once Lian firmly redeclared as gender neutral and Joral stated that they were merely colleagues, it died down again, leaving the two free to hang out together and assess potential brides for Joral.There had been a bonding experience during that underground adventure, but not the sort the media was hoping for.The other bit of media, which I should have anticipated, depicted me as Dllenahkhs consort in all but name.Faithful companion, close colleague, partner in crimeyou name it.Not lovers, surprisingly.I suppose, since we werent as young and pretty as Joral and Lian, the media wasnt interested in what we got up to in bed.Gilda, on the other hand, was a lot less picky.Its fine, I said with dignity, and meditatively licked a portion of salt from the rim of my glass.
