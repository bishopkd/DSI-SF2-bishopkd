You can see how fast my hand is moving and you can see exactly where it is.Nonetheless.It is especially true for things so tiny, they cannot be seen and who move so fast, they cannot be captured.Then how do you know they exist?The numbers prove it, he said, brandishing the notebook again.It all related to my poor Impossible Cube.I miss it so.The beauty.The symmetry.The way it twisted the universe about itself.Everything about it was perfect.Perhaps you can still rebuild it.As I said, I am beginning to think this is not possible.Can you tell me any more about the way it was destroyed?Alice remembered watching Gavin holding the Impossible Cube beneath the Third Ward as he sang a single crystal note that shattered everything around him.Everything but her.Then he dropped the Cube, which fell through every color of the spectrum and vanished in a white flash the moment it touched the floor.Only what Ive told you already, she said.Nothing new.Doctor, the way the Cube twists itself   It does no such thing, Dr.Clef interrupted, agitated.The Cube is a constant.It twists the universe, but since we are in the universe, we think the Cube is twisted.Of course, of course, Alice reassured him, though she had no idea what he was talking about.But I meant that it might be better if you left the Cube alone.Perhaps it isnt meant to be re created at all.An odd light came into his eyes.Do you think so?Quite.Hmmm.Maybe I should leave it alone, then.Did you bring back any raspberry jam?I have not had any in quite some time.Oh!Alice jolted back to the nonscientific world.We did bring more food, but no jam, Im sorry to say.Gavin and Feng are down in the barn.We think we have a way to move the ship, and well need your help.Dr.Clef rubbed his hands together.A project!I will be pleased to take part.Madam?The door to Alices stateroom opened and Kemp poked his head into the corridor.Is that you?Of course it is, Kemp.Thank heavens!He bustled into the corridor.Ive been having a dreadful time keeping the little automatons under control, and I finally had to lock them up.Were completely out of food, and   Yes, Kemp.Youve done an admirable job and we couldnt have survived without you.Now, come down, both of you.Kemp managed to look pleased despite his lack of facial features.Madam.On deck, they filed past the little generator, which had only recently been switched back on.It contentedly puffed steam and paraffin oil smoke, a shockingly daring woman smoking a cigarette.Above them, ropes creaked and the envelopes lacy endoskeleton glowed blue, indicating that it was receiving power and lifting the hull.They all climbed down to the barn floor.At the entrance of the barn was Gavin, who had abandoned his black clothes for an ordinary work shirt, brown trousers, and a cloth cap.He looked like a handsome young farmer.With him was Nathan Storm, his own cap barely concealing his sunset hair, and a team of four horses pulling a wagon, which carried a pile of material covered in canvas.Whats this?Whats this?Dr.Clef asked, and Alice made introductions.Dr.Clef clapped his hands in glee.The circus!A perfect place to hide ourselves, then.But how will we hide the ship?With this.Gavin pulled the canvas off the wagon, revealing a pile of wheels and axles.Dr.Clef clapped his hands again.Of course, of course.I should have seen.Shall we work now?I told you he would understand quickly, Gavin said to Nathan, who only lit his pipe.They hauled the Lady out of the barn and tethered her a few feet above the ground so they could set to work.The endoskeleton continued to glow its lacy blue, and Alice felt nervous and exposed, like a fat rabbit on a meadow with hawks cruising overhead, but there was nothing for it.Alice, Gavin said, could you bring down your little automatons to assist?And then  She cocked her head.And then what?Uh maybe you could go for a walk?Or just stay out of sight behind the barn.This shouldnt take long.Her ire escalated.Because you dont think Im qualified to help?How can you possibly think   No, no.He held his hands up.I just dont think you should see this.It was the wrong thing to say.Her voice rose and her metal fist clenched.Im too ladylike, is that it?Not at all.Uh oh, Nathan said.So Im not a lady, then?Alice said.What?No!I just Alice, youve never seen a clockworker in a full work fugue before, have you?And its not appropriate to me because Im a lady.She folded her arms.Its foolish to give up a pair of hands because of some misguided principles.Im helping, and the sooner we get started, the better.Gavin closed his eyes.All right.Lets get started, then.They had to work quickly, before they were spotted and word filtered back to Phipps, wherever she was.Alice was no slouch at mechanical work, but even she was amazed at Gavin and Dr.Clef.They both circled the pile of parts and tools for some time, studying them, with her little automatons hovering and skittering nearby.Kemp and Click also awaited orders.A blank look came over first Gavins eyes, then Dr.Clefs.They dove into the parts with great glee and rushed with them toward the Lady, barking orders to the automatons as they went.Alice followed along, and was startled when Gavin thrust an axle into her hands.Grind these ends smooth, he boomed.And be quick about it!Maybe then I can ride you into battle.Then he turned away and flung a handful of bolts at one of the little whirligigs, who caught them in midair.He didnt even seem to recognize Alice.At first she felt indignant.Then she felt sickened.She told herself it was the clockwork plague, not him, and when a clockworker entered a fugue, nothing mattered but the work, but she still felt like shed been slapped.What are you waiting for, girl?The usual offer to tup you for half a sandwich?Gavin snarled.His eyes were wild and his hair half stood up.Oil streaked his face and hands like blood.Move!Face flaming, Alice did as she was told, and when she was finished, accepted another snarl from Gavin, this time to tighten bolts.The little automatons flitted and scampered about.He snatched her automatons and spiders one by one, opened them up, and changed their memory wheels around.They squeaked in protest, and Alice bit back a cry of alarm.Dr.Clef worked elsewhere, shouting orders at Kemp and Nathan.Click stayed out of the way.Alice felt as tense as the metal she tightened.Faster!Gavin bellowed at her.Youre slow and clumsy.Typical of dog meat.Alice kept her head down, feeling small and stupid and hating herself for it.Gavin had become another person, a sneering stranger, and she didnt like him.Telling herself that it wasnt his fault didnt help much.After being barked at for the fourth time, she began to see why so many clockworkers were forced to build automaton assistants.The only saving grace was that Gavin and Dr.Clef seemed to be working three times as hard as anyone else.Hey!Gavin dropped the automaton he was altering and dashed over to Dr.Clef, who was frantically reworking a set of wheels.Those measurements are wrong, you fat idiot.Youre off by a good sixteenth inch.Dr.Clefs jowls reddened.Youre not half the man your mother is, you grease faced dog.The tracks are clearly   Did you think I cant see the obvious?Gavin barked.My mind is sharper than any tool youll ever touch, and certainly a good deal larger.Dr.Clef picked up a sledgehammer and hefted it with an ease and power that caught Alice off guard.She had forgotten that the clockwork plague enhanced his strength and reflexes just as much as Gavins.We will see how large a tool I have.Just a moment!Nathan plucked the hammer from Dr.Clefs hand.Over there, Doctor.Does that axle look crooked to you?And, Gavin, Alice said, hurrying forward, I dont think that automaton is functioning properly.Both clockworkers turned, distracted, and moved fairly quickly to their new tasks.Nathan set the sledgehammer down.Clockworkers dont work well together in fugue, he murmured.I can see that, Alice said.You!Gavin snapped.The one with an ass like a bag of laundry!Bring me that box of parts.Dont shout back.You just saw how it only makes them worse, Nathan said quietly.And dont take it personally.Alices jaw was tight.Im trying.In a surprisingly short time the Lady sported three sets of train wheels on her underside, and all the automatons had been modified.Still, the sun was setting, and Alice felt dirty, greasy, and half starved, and the steady stream of invective stuck like pitch to her skin.It would never come off.Were done, she called up to Gavin, who was busy carving ivy leaves into a box that he had mounted on the deck.The box had two buttons on it, one red and one green.His hands moved with inhuman speed.Gavin!Were done!Not close, you ignorant filth.Do something useful with your fingers besides twiddle yourself, and bring me a screwdriver.Setting her mouth, Alice strode up the gangplank and grabbed him by the shoulders.He shook her off and snarled at her like a dog.A blob of spittle flew from his mouth and landed warm on the back of her hand.She jumped back, eyes wide at the monstrosity of it.How dare you lay hands on me?he snarled.Keep your disgusting hands to   Water doused him from head to foot.It plastered his hair to his scalp and ran off him in rivulets.Gavin gasped and gaped for a long moment.Alice scrambled backward and Nathan set down his bucket.Are you yourself, then?he asked Gavin mildly.There was a long pause.Gavin dropped the tools, and they thudded on the planking.Are we done?What time is it?Why am I all wet?His voice was normal, and held none of the sneering tone shed been hearing all afternoon.She felt so relieved, she was afraid she would half burst into tears, but she was angry, too.Why hadnt he come out of it when she talked to him?We had to snap you out, Alice said stiffly.Thank you, Mr.Storm.We should get moving, before someone spots the ship and gossip spreads.Gavin uselessly mopped at his face with his sopping sleeve.Did it work?Are we ready?Why wont anyone answer me?Im assuming it worked.Alice forced her voice to stay level.Looking at Gavin made her angry at the way he had treated her.Its not his fault.Its not his fault.He told me to walk away, she told herself.But it didnt help.You and Dr.Clef were doing nothing but decoration, and we probably shouldnt wait for that.Youre mad at me, he said.Did I say or do anything to you?God, Alice, Im sorry.I dont   Not now, Gavin, she said.We need to move.Gavin looked like someone had kicked his puppy.She knew she was being unreasonable, that she should apologize or offer to hear him out, but she couldnt seem to do it.Were ready up here, she called over the gunwale.Nathan had disembarked.The Lady was still floating a few feet above the ground, and her new wheels just barely cleared the green grass.Dr.Clef, also out of his fugue, was hitching the horses to the front of the airship with Nathans help.Give it a little more power, my boy!Dr.Clef called up.Gavin went to the paraffin oil generator and adjusted the dials.The purring grew louder and more steam emerged.The endoskeleton glowed a little brighter, and the Lady rose higher, but only about a foot.Clear!Nathan called from the horses, and flicked the reins.The four horses started forward, towing the ship, which slid forward at a quick, even pace.It works, Alice said.So far, Gavin said cautiously.And we can come back for the wagon later.Im just not so sure about the rest.Alice whistled, and whirligigs flew from a dozen different directions to hover in front of her, their brass parts glittering in the dying sunlight.Most of them were carrying at least one spider.Thank you for your help, she said.Were nearly set for the next step.Please stand ready.Looking excited, they flew up into the rigging like a cloud of mechanical bats.Do they understand please and thank you?Gavin asked.They seem to work better when I use those words, so I do, Alice said.I cant explain it, so I dont try.Her words came out curt.Look, Alice, Im sorry I   Oh look the tracks!The railroad tracks ran alongside the road Alice, Gavin, and Feng had taken into Luxembourg two days ago.No one was on them at the moment.Nathan guided the horses around until the airship was hovering just above the tracks.Down!Nathan called.With another glance at Alice, Gavin slowly powered down the generator.The blue glow lessened and the Lady sank like a woman settling into an armchair.Alice looked over the side.Kemp, Dr.Clef, and Nathan pushed and nudged the hull as it went down, making sure the new wheels lined up with the tracks.With a clunk, the ship dropped into place.Perfect, Dr.Clef said.Everything matches.We have an hour before a train comes, Gavin said.So lets hope this works.He put his hand over the green button on the newly mounted box on the deck, the one with half carved ivy leaves on it, and paused.Several moments passed, and Alice finally said, Whats the matter?I hate to do this to her, Gavin replied quietly.It feels like Im crippling my sister or my mother.But it needs to be done.He slapped the green button.In the rigging, all the automatons instantly came to attention.The spiders rushed over the ropes and the whirligigs spun into action.Under the new instructions Gavin had spun into their memory wheels, they unfastened the Ladys outer envelope.Their tiny fingers popped seams with quick precision, and the sides of the envelope peeled away like petticoats to reveal a glowing wire corset beneath.Alice realized she felt a bit embarrassed, as if the Lady were undressing in public, and she told herself not to be silly.The spiders dodged into the endoskeletons framework, and got to work on the interior balloons.As the last pieces of the envelope drooped away, the four interior ballonets deflated with an unhappy sigh, leaving a pile of cloth inside the curlicue endoskeleton.The outer layer of cloth dropped to the deck, and Alice found herself buried in silk.She struggled out of it and found Gavin emerging as well.His expression was sad.My ship, he said.But Alice could only manage a curt nod.The endoskeleton, meanwhile, continued to hover, and the whirligigs rolled it up like an enormous piece of chicken wire with the deflated ballonets inside.It was still powered by the generator, however, so the roll hovered high above the deck.Without the additional lift of the envelope, the skeleton didnt have the strength to lift the Ladys hull, and the ropes kept it from floating away.Gavin swept silk away from the generator and powered it slowly down.The wire roll, which was the same length as the ship and about five feet in diameter, sank slowly to the deck, drooping ropes as it came.The whirligigs and spiders rode it down, and Alice could swear they were silently cheering.She and Gavin pushed the roll a little to one side so it wouldnt land on the helm and finally eased it down to the starboard side of the deck.The hull creaked and settled as the weight shifted.Nathan snapped his reins, and the four horses jerked forward.It took them a moment to get started, but at last they moved ahead, pulling the newly wheeled airship smoothly down the tracks.Were not done, Gavin said to the whirligigs, which rushed down to the wagon and, working as teams, hauled up two large canvas signs.Gavin hung one over one side of the ship and Alice hung the other over the opposite side.In garish letters, they read Kalakos Cirque International du Automates et dAutres Merveilles.Its like putting whores makeup on a queen, Gavin muttered.Alice was sure she wasnt meant to hear that comment, so she ignored it.She climbed down a rope ladder, dropped to the ground, and trotted a short distance from the tracks to get a good look.The airships gunwales looked like the railings that graced the top of most circus wagons.Silk covered the name The Lady of Liberty painted across the stern, and the banner signs completed the trick.The airship looked like a tall wagon or high train car being hauled somewhere for repairs or a bit of publicity.Alice climbed back up.Kemp was back on deck, along with Gavin.Nathan and Dr.Clef drove the horses below.Click had disappeared, but Alice was confident he would show up again.He always did.Go below and hide, Kemp, Alice said.Youre illegal here.Take the little ones with you.Shall I bring tea first, Madam?Kemp said.Im not hungry anymore, Alice replied.Kemp withdrew.The horses were making good time on the tracks.Already they were nearing the boundary of the city.The fields and trees were nearly dark, and the sounds of the city voices, horses, clattering machinery, laughter, music floated past in snips and pieces beneath shy stars.A faint breeze from the country brought smells of earth and hay.Alice drummed her mechanical hand on the gunwale with little clicking sounds.I tried to warn you, Gavin said quietly.And Im not going to fall all over myself apologizing.Dont expect you to.He shrugged casually, but Alice could see the stiffness in his posture.I didnt bring the plague on myself, and I dont like it that youre treating me as if I did.The anger flared again.What are you talking about?I gave up everything for you, Gavin Ennock.I gave up a marriage and abandoned my position in society and, God help me, I even destroyed the British Empire, all to save you.You wanted to watch me work and whatever you saw scared you.Gavin flung his cap away and spread his arms.Get a good look, Alice.Im the monster your dear aunt made me.Dont you bring Aunt Edwina into this!Alice cried.She was just as insane as as  As I am?Gavin finished for her.Go ahead.Blame me.Blame her.It doesnt matter.In a few months Ill be dead.Then you can rush to England and see if Norbert will take you back.He stalked over to the other side of the deck and stared viciously out at nothing.Alice turned her back on him, stiff with fury.The city slid past with a faint rumble and scrape of train wheels.The Lady swayed a little.It felt distinctly odd, the familiar rhythm of a railway car on the open deck of an airship.Some of Alices anger gave way to nerves.Somewhere out there, Glenda and Simon and Phipps were looking for her.For all she knew, they were one street over, or just around the corner.She shivered and glanced back at Gavin.The anger came back.It didnt matter that it was the plague that   Yes.It did matter.She looked back at the streets and buildings, now only lit by occasional streetlights and yellow lamps in windows.This part of the city was mostly residential, and there was little street traffic at night.Three of the doors each had ragged red Ps painted on them.The deserted sidewalks and cobblestones suddenly seemed an echo of her life.The plague definitely mattered.It was all that mattered.It had stolen her entire family and her future, turned her into a fugitive, and forced her to make choices that would change the entire world.It wasnt fair.It wasnt right.And it made her so angry.Movement caught her eye.A tattered, gaunt woman shuffled along the sidewalk as the airship glided past.She wore a battered straw hat and sores split her skin.The light from a streetlamp made her flinch.Plague zombie.A lifetime of reflexes made Alice flinch away, but once she recovered, she turned to tell Gavin, but then thought otherwise.What business was it of his?Alice scuttled down the rope ladder.The airship moved slowly, and Alice easily dropped to the street.Nathan and Dr.Clef didnt see her and continued on with the horses.She didnt want to shout and call attention to herself, so she simply dashed over to the zombie woman, pulling off the glove that covered her left hand as she went.It would be easy enough to cure the poor woman and catch the ship back up.She couldnt save her family, but she could save this woman, and so many others like her.She had to do it, or what was the point of everything that had gone before?The zombie woman barely reacted when Alice slashed her, but straightened fairly quickly.Much of the misery left her face, replaced with relief.She blinked and looked around, like a blind person seeing color again.Alices heart lightened.Every life she changed for the better made her own existence a bit more worthy.The zombie now a full person again wandered away with an expression of wonder.Excusez moi!Another woman Alice hadnt noticed stepped out of a doorway.Etes vous quelle?Alice started, and her light mood evaporated.Am I she, who?she asked cautiously, also in French.The woman was young and very pretty, with enormous blue eyes.The one who cures people, she clarified.People with the plague.The airship cum wagon was pulling out of sight, but if this woman also needed help, Alice didnt see how she could refuse.I am she, she said.The woman abruptly caught Alice in a hard embrace.Thank you.Thank you, thank you.You are an angel.She broke away, suddenly embarrassed, and said, But where is your friend?My friend?The one whose music gives you power to cure them.Oh.Alice thought about correcting her, then thought the better of it.Hes hes nearby.There are more who need you.Many more.Can you come?Please?The airship was curving away, nearly gone.Alice chewed her lip.She was still angry, but she wasnt stupid, either.I cant come right now, but I will, I promise.Where?To the Church of Our Lady, she said, at the top of the hill in the center of the city.Ask for Monsignor Adames.I promise, Alice repeated, and ran back to the clattering airship.At the front with the horses, Dr.Clef was telling Nathan, The closer one comes to its position in time, the farther one wanders from its position in space.She had just reached the ladder when a trio of men on horses cantered around the corner, the horses iron shod hooves clattering on the cobblestones.The men wore smart blue uniforms, and one of them carried a torch.The woman fled into the shadows.You!one of the men shouted at the airship in French.Halt!Nathan and Dr.Clef stopped the team.Gavin poked his head over the gunwale, a startled and worried expression on his face.Alice hurried up the ladder, her hands chilly with apprehension.Where were you?Gavin hissed at her.Never mind, she whispered back.Get out that nightingale.What?Just do it!Yes, Officer?Nathan asked pleasantly, also in French.He sucked at his pipe with outward calm, but Alice could see tension in him.Dr.Clef had slid to the side of the team opposite the two police officers and was keeping his head down, away from the torchlight.What are you doing out at this hour?the first man snapped.He was older, and wasnt carrying the torch.We are with the circus and had to move one of our cars, Nathan replied.It was the only time the tracks were free.Where are your papers?Here, sir.All signed and stamped.Nathan drew a set from his pocket and handed them over.The man with the torch held the light so his superior could examine them.The third man took his horse around the other side of the disguised airship, clearly to make sure no one slipped away and vanished.Alice held her breath, hoping they would take the explanation and leave.The officer gave the papers only a cursory glance.We have reports of certain dangerous criminals from England and America.A woman with brown hair and a younger man with pale blond hair.I was afraid of that, Gavin whispered.The Third Ward has connections all over Europe.Phipps must have talked to the police.Im from Ireland, Nathan said.What about him?The older officer pointed at Dr.Clef, who was still huddled behind the horse.Hes mute, and an idiot, Nathan said.His mother was a sideshow freak and he was born funny, but horses love him.I still need to search this wagon, the officer said.Alices heart beat fast now.Before she could lose her nerve, she shouted over the gunwale in her heavily accented French, What is wrong down there?We should not stop for long, you know.Whos there?the lead officer called up.He drew a sword.Show yourself!Alice tied a handkerchief over her hair in an impromptu head cloth and peered over the side.I am Lombarda, lion tamer extraordinaire.Who are you?Lieutenant Ovrille of the Grand Ducal Police, he said.Come down immediately!We are searching the wagon!If you like, Alice called back.But the lion, he will not be happy.Ovrille paused.What lion?The cage, it has broken, you see.That is why we are using this wagon.The lion, he is up top, and I have no leash or cage right now, and it is far past his mealtime.He is quite hungry.Fortunately, he does not feel women are a threat, no?The other officer, the one with the torch, looked uncertain.Sir , he said.Our orders are clear, Ovrille said stubbornly.We are to search everything even remotely suspicious.Yes, yes, Alice called.Please come up, then.But make no sudden moves, especially if you ate meat for supper.I do not know how much longer I can keep him quiet.She changed her tone of voice, as if she were speaking to a child.Can I, baby?No, I cannot.I just cannot keep ums quiet!Ovrille dismounted and reached for the rope ladder hanging over the side of the airship.Alice gestured sharply at Gavin, who fumbled with the nightingale and finally managed to press its right eye.It opened its beak and the lions roar from the previous evenings parade snarled through the night, a little quiet but realistic enough.Ovrille froze.No, no, no, Alice cooed loudly.It is all right, little one.The man is not here to hurt you.He is not for you to bite.You must sit quietly and let him   Gavin pressed the nightingale again, and it played the roar a second time.Ovrille snatched his hand away from the ladder as if the rungs were hot pokers.The officer with the torch backed his horse away, as did the man who had gone to the opposite side of the airship.What are you doing?Alice said.I believe I have him under control.Come up now before he again becomes angry.Another roar.Ovrille went back to his horse.Yes, well, he said.I think we can let it go this time.Are you sure?Alice said.We would not wish for you to get into trouble.If you let him lick your hand first, he probably wont bite.Just go, Ovrille ordered.Huh.As you wish, then.Nathan tapped the horses, which jerked forward, and the airship creaked along the tracks.Once the officers were out of sight, Alice blew out a long breath.Every muscle went limp and she collapsed to the deck.I never want to do that again, she half sobbed, half giggled.You thought it was bad for you.Gavin sank to the deck beside her.I had no idea what you were saying and had to guess about making the nightingale roar.Good that youre intelligent, then.There was a long pause.Alice wanted to say something more, except words wouldnt come.The anger curled around her heart like a dozing tiger and held everything in.Alice envied Gavins easy way with words, how he could say whatever was on his mind.After a while, Gavin brought his cupped hands with the nightingale in them to his face.When he brought them down again, he tossed the nightingale into the air.It spread its wings and fluttered about for a moment, then flitted over to settle on Alices shoulder.Alice knew that the nightingale, meant to carry recorded messages, would fly back and forth between the last two people who had touched it.The moment it landed, the little bird sang in Gavins voice.I picked a rose, the rose picked me,  Underneath the branches of the forest tree.The moon picked you from all the rest  For I loved you best.Alice closed her eyes at the beauty that surrounded her but still couldnt respond.Most people think, Gavin said, that if the melody of a song is written in a minor key, the accompaniment or counterpoint has to be played in a minor key, too.But thats not right.The counterpoint can be the major fifth chord, if you leave out the mediant, the one note that clashes.She made a small, noncommittal noise.Ahead of them, the tracks stretched through the city, turning neither right nor left, taking the airship down its predetermined path.Ive never been in love before, Alice, he continued.And Ive never been a clockworker.So I dont know what all this means.I can only play the music fate hands me.When I sing, all my songs tell me that I want to be with you.If you dont want to be with me, just say so.Suddenly she couldnt bear it any longer.She sat up and grabbed his hand.His fingers were strong.The nightingale hopped back to his shoulder.I hate the plague.I hate what its doing to you.To us.I dont want to let you go.I cant let you go.But Im frightened of what the plague might do.So am I, he said quietly.It steals memory from me, and it steals time from us.We have to get to China and find a cure.What if there is no cure, Gavin?she asked suddenly.What if the Dragon Men cant do anything, or they just wont, or we cant find a cure in time?He squeezed her hand.Alice, the plague might be able to steal my sanity, but it cant steal love.No matter how insane I go, there will always be a part of me that loves you.And she still didnt know how to respond, so she didnt.That didnt seem to bother Gavin.They sat on the deck in simple silence together until the airship pulled onto the spur that led to the park Dodd had rented for the circus.When the ship came to a halt behind the dark circus train, Alice headed for the ladder.Get your fiddle, she said.We arent done yet.What are you talking about?Ill explain below.Nathan was already unhitching the horses with Dr.Clefs help.Alice explained how she had met the woman.She said there were more who need me at the Church of Our Lady.I know where that is, Gavin said.So do I, Nathan put in.Dodd and I have gone there for confession once or twice.Gavin blinked innocently.What did you confess?That you were an arse.She said to ask for Monsignor Adames, Alice said.I need to   There you are!Dodd ran up and caught Nathan in a hard embrace.One of the horses snorted.Jesus, you scared me out of my wits.Im fine, Im fine, Nathan gasped.Whats wrong?Mingers.Dodd let him go.Gendarmes.They turned the whole circus upside down looking for Gavin and Alice and demanding to know if we were hiding you.No one said anything, of course, but thank God you werent here.Are they still looking?Dr.Clef asked.I should think so.They seemed pretty intent.They called you criminals, and Dr.Clef a danger to society.Was a woman with them?Tall?Dark hair?Metal arm?Gavin said.Dodd shook his head.You mean your Lieutenant Phipps.She wasnt there, but I heard them mention her name.What about Feng?Alice said.He was easy to hide.Dodd waved a dismissive hand.We have two families of Chinese.She didnt even ask about him.Thats a relief, then.Alice tugged at Gavins elbow.We need to go.You cant go now, Dodd said.Didnt you just hear?Phipps has patrols looking for you all over the city.Youll be safe here theyve already looked but you cant go out.I promised, Ringmaster, Alice said.Those people need my help.Every moments delay means another plague victim might die.So unless you intend to lock me in a lions cage, get out of my way before I knock you down.She will, Gavin told him.Fine.Dodd made the same dismissive gesture.But you arent going alone.Certainly not!Alice said, and Dodd looked surprised that she was agreeing.Only a fool would do that.And a number of people who arent coming should know where Im going so they can mount a rescue if I dont return in a reasonable amount of time.Gavins coming, of course.Am I?Gavin was grinning.You are.You know where the church is.Feng must come, too.That leaves Mr.Storm, who also knows where the church is, on rescue duty with Dr.Clef and the ringmaster.As long as youre running my circus, that man sighed, you might as well just call me Dodd.Chapter Six  They took several moments to gather equipment.Alice wanted to get the firefly jar from Feng, and Gavin wanted weapons.He couldnt bring himself to use actual pistols, however.A lifetime of training had instilled a healthy fear of anything that created flame, a deadly threat on an airship.Even after several weeks on the Lady, which used newfangled helium, Gavin still shunned gunpowder for the cutlass of shatterproof glass favored by airmen.Unfortunately, he no longer had a flechette pistol, which used compressed air to fire glass needles.The circus, meanwhile, had gone back to sleep, recovered from its encounter with the gendarmes Phipps had commandeered, but Gavin wondered how long before they returned and how many theyd encounter on the way to the church, which was why he wanted weapons.He looked at Dr.Clefs power canon where it lay on the Ladys deck, and sighed with regret.Its too heavy, Gavin said.I wouldnt get twenty yards.Perhaps you could make modifications with this.Dr.Clef held up a spool of alloy wire, the same stuff as the endoskeleton rolled up and lying on the port side of the deck.Can you do it alone?I have fear that we shall fight if I assist.Gavin looked at the wire and at the power cannon.His brain leaped ahead, and he saw wires and pulsing power and batteries.He ran his hands over the cannon, able to feel how it all fit together, every bolt, every shard, every pathway, right down to the tiny pieces so small they couldnt hold a name.He saw a number of fascinating ways to reshape them, gently move matter and energy along a number of different venues.He was only vaguely aware that Dr.Clef, that annoying Dr.Clef, had withdrawn, and the vibrations of his receding footsteps on the deck came out as long, distorted strings that vibrated against the air and kicked it about.Gavins fingers flew, snatching up tools and setting them down again, braiding wire, snipping metal, connecting pieces of the universe in new ways.Gavin?The high pitched voice intruded, interrupted, interjected.He turned to snarl at the interruption   and saw that it was a woman.He knew her.He had feelings for her.He struggled for a moment.She had broken his concentration, which made him angry, but she was also someone to be trusted, someone he didnt want to be angry at.The contradictory feelings warred for a split second, equally matched.Alice.Her name was Alice.The new fact tipped the balance, and in a flash he remembered that she wasnt someone who deserved disdain.He twisted inside like a cat changing its mind in midleap and yanked back the retort.Alice?he gasped, and realized he was panting.A trickle of sweat slid down his cheek.Whats going on?I was going to ask you the same thing.She had changed into trousers, which Gavin found strangely attractive on a woman.They accentuated her hips and showed her legs.She was wearing a tighter fitting blouse as well, and it clung to her neck and breasts.Her braided hair caught the moon and held it.The silvery light shifted, moving in a shower of particles, then splashing as a wave, but doing both at the same time, just as the Impossible Cube had twisted and changed before his eyes.It was beautiful and terrible all at once, and Gavin couldnt look away if he wanted to.For a moment it was hard to breathe.What is that?she asked.Did you make it?Gavin held up the object in question.An eight foot braided lash trailed to the deck from a heavy brass handle, and the handle connected to a cord that ran to a backpack with a battery in it.Dr.Clefs power cannon lay dead on the deck, its brass entrails scattered across the wood.It looks like a whip, said Feng, who had also climbed up.He was dressed in what looked to Gavin like soft black pajamas from head to foot.Show us, please.Gavin shook off the last of the clockwork daze.He shrugged into the backpack and flicked a switch on the handle.A low thrum D flat, he automatically noted throbbed across his ears and pulsed against his palm.The metal lash glowed incandescent blue.The weight eased in his hand as the power pushed Dr.Clefs alloy away from gravity.Gavin swung.The whip flicked through the air, quick as a demons tongue, and slashed at the barrel of the power cannon.The barrel didnt move.For a moment, neither did anyone else.Then the barrel fell neatly into two halves that thudded to the deck.There was a long, long pause.I watched someone called the Great Mordovo cut his assistant in half this afternoon, Feng said at last.I do not believe you should show this to him.Alice swallowed visibly and shifted her pack.That took you all of half an hour to make?I didnt keep track of the time.Gavin flicked the switch off.The glow vanished, and the whip grew heavy in his hand again.He coiled it and hung it on the right side of his belt, opposite his glass cutlass.You must be careful, Dr.Clef admonished, approaching from his previously safe distance.Every slash takes power, you know, and the battery does not last forever.Then lets go now, Gavin said.Ill carry your fiddle, Alice said.The three of them slipped away from the circus and hurried down the city streets.Gavin led the way, since he knew where they were going, and Feng brought up the rear, with Alice in the middle.The air that stole over Gavin was growing chilly and damp, with an early breath of autumn to it.In the distance, a church bell repeated a dark F that pressed lonely against his ears.A scattering of lights glowed in houses or shops, but most windows were dark, and the moon coasted through a field of stars like a bright airship through a cloud of fireflies.Even the public houses were closed at this time of night, and the trio had no good reason to be on the street, which meant any gendarme would stop them for questioning.Gavin slid into another shadow, trying to control his nervousness.The cutlass and whip lent him a whiff of power, but one pistol shot could bring him down, or worse, bring down Alice.Gavin didnt know if Phipps intended to capture or kill at this point, but capture would mean transport back to England for hanging, so it didnt make much difference.He kept one hand on the smooth whip handle.A pair of horses clip clopped from around the corner ahead of them.Gavin grabbed Alices hand and pulled her into an alleyway.Her backpack clinked slightly, and the noise made Gavins heart jerk.Feng seemed to have disappeared.The riders rounded the corner and trotted down their street.Gavin pressed himself face first against the rough alley wall, leaving the packs uneven shape sticking out.He could hear Alices butterfly breathing next to him, feel her body heat mingling with his.She clutched his fiddle case, and he felt oddly comforted that she held it.When the pirate captain had threatened to throw it off the Juniper, it had felt like the mans filthy fingers were running over Gavins soul, but Alices touch made him feel that the fiddle was safe, even with danger only a few steps away.The horses clopped past the mouth of the alley, and moonlight gleamed off pistols holstered at the riders belts.Gavin held his breath.He had turned his face away from the street so his fair skin wouldnt catch a stray beam of light, and he was looking right into Alices eyes, just visible in the scattered wave of photons.They were wide and brown and beautiful, even when filled with unease.One of the riders paused at the alley mouth and said something in French to his companion, who also paused.Fear made blood pulse in Gavins ears.Alices lips parted, and her breath came in short gasps, but she didnt move.The man spoke again, every word as harsh as a drop of melted lead.And then they were gone, their horses trotting away to fade in the distance.The weight of fear vanished so quickly, Gavin thought he might float away.The tension went out of Alices body as well.Gavin surprised himself by leaning in and kissing her.She stiffened again, then kissed back, her mouth warm on his.When they parted, he pressed his forehead against hers.Why were we scared?Alice murmured.You could have torn them in half with that whip.I could have, Gavin replied.Thats exactly why I was scared.The street was still empty, no sign of Feng.A cough over Gavins head made him grab for the whip, but Alice put her hand on his arm.Feng was perched on a windowsill two stories above them.His dark clothing made him look like the shadow of a spider.Carefully but steadily, using rough bricks and other windowsills for footholds, he descended to the sidewalk.Im impressed, Alice asked.I have climbed in and out of a number of windows in my life, Feng said.More than once with a husband in hot pursuit.It is interesting how well one can climb with the correct motivation.They hurried away, dodging the gas lamps.Occasionally, they heard footsteps or horses hooves a street or two over, and every time they hid in alleys or doorways or under stoops, though they didnt have any more close encounters with police.The streets wound steadily uphill, and Gavins legs started to ache from the steady climbing, and the battery pack pulled at his shoulder muscles.After a while, he said, Where are the plague zombies?That made Alice pause.I dont know.We should have seen at least one or two by now.Perhaps the priest will know, Feng said.They finally arrived at the Church of Our Lady.The huge stone building loomed over Gavin, buttressed high and stiff, surrounded by a low wall and a square marked off from the street by a line of stone pillars that stretched between them like an iron lattice.Stained glass windows shut themselves against the night.It is large, Feng said.I imagined a small stone church, not an entire cathedral.I think theyve applied for cathedral status with the Pope, Gavin said.They have to apply to call it a cathedral?Feng looked doubtfully up at the walls, which seemed half fortress, half heaven.I would enjoy seeing the paperwork for that.The Papists do have their ideas, Alice said.Where do we go in?The main doors, half large enough to admit a dirigible, were obviously locked and barred, and the idea of knocking on such enormous timbers felt ridiculous.They followed the wall around until they found a more normal sized pair of doors in an alcove.Feng knocked hard, then pounded at some length.Gavin nervously dropped his hand to the whip.Time passed, and the door wrenched open to reveal an old woman in a dressing gown and nightcap.A candlestick glimmered in her hand.She demanded something in French, and Alice responded.Gavin caught the words Monsignor Adames.The woman looked doubtful, but finally gestured them inside and shut the door behind them.Gavin found himself in a small room, but he could sense a great echoing space beyond.She wants us to wait here, Alice said as the woman padded away, taking the light with her.Gavin waited in uneasy blackness with Alice and Feng beside him.None of them spoke.The emptiness beyond seemed to eat words, or even the idea of speaking.Time didnt move.Gavin sensed the weight of the pack on his shoulders, and the heft of the whip handle in his hand, and the pull of the cutlass at his belt.Alices and Fengs breathing beside him pushed about tiny amounts of air that puffed against his face, bounced off and swirled away in chaotic forms that held patterns just beyond his understanding.He reached out and put his hand into one and felt it scatter and flee.Another swirl of breath bounced off him, creating patterned chaos on his skin, and if he just concentrated hard enough, he might be able to understand it, perhaps even control it, even   Gavin!Alices voice broke into his thoughts.Are you coming?Chaos swirls against my skin, he said, but the pattern remains out of reach.How can I touch it?We shouldnt stay up here, said a mans voice in lightly accented English.Just bring him along.And then Gavin was within the great empty place, standing before a half sized statue of a woman on a pedestal holding an infant the Virgin Mary.Behind her, windows of stained glass rose above an elaborate altar.She stood on a crescent moon and wore robes of gold and crimson.In her right hand she held a scepter.The baby Jesus cradled a ball in his hand and stretched out the other in benediction.Both mother and child wore tall crowns of gold that sparkled with jewels.Candles flickered around her feet and in the candelabra behind her, lending her an otherworldly glow.Consolatrix Afflictorum, said the man, and Gavin noticed for the first time he wore a long black robe and a white priests collar.Comforter of the afflicted.If you believe the legend, she dropped out of a tree trunk in 1624, right around the time the black plague struck, and she cured a number of people.In 1794, the clockwork plague appeared, and so many people overwhelmed the Jesuit chapel outside the city, we moved her in here.But you take her out and bring her around the city just after Easter, Gavin said softly.Eight days afterward.The Octave.The priest blinked.He had receding gray hair and a thin build.Youve heard of it.No.Its just obvious.Gavin flicked a glance at the statues pale brown hair and dark brown eyes and rounded beauty and machine like scepter in her hand, then glanced at Alice.She looks like   Dont, Alice said.But she really   I said dont, Alice said again, and her voice floated to the high ceiling.She repositioned her backpack.Monsignor Adames, I have a cure for the clockwork plague, and one of the people I helped told me to come here.A cure?Adames repeated.I dont understand.Her touch cures the clockwork plague, Feng said.Her touch, he echoed, then gave a small laugh.Im sorry if I seem doubtful, but well, Im doubtful.I believe in the holy miracles, including the ones that founded this very church, but   I play the fiddle, Gavin interrupted, and I sing.Monsignor Adames fell silent.Then he said slowly, There are rumors.Ive heard of a beautiful woman with a sword and an angel with a golden voice who appear to cure the afflicted at night and who are pursued by brass demons during the day.I thought they were nothing but desperate stories from people who want comfort.But now  How can we help?Alice asked.Adames hesitated only a moment.This way.He caught up a candle from the statues feet and led them to a door behind one of the carved, earth colored pillars lining the cathedral.A tight spiral staircase twisted downward.Adames pulled back the skirts of his robe with his free hand and held up the candle with the other to light the way as they descended.Youre an angel?Feng said to Gavin on the stairs.May I be the one to write your family about that?Please?At the bottom was a stone passageway, low and cramped.The top of Gavins backpack brushed the ceiling.Soot from thousands of ancient candles streaked the walls.Damp darkness pressed in from all sides, hushing Gavins footsteps.A number of alcoves and rooms opened at regular intervals, some with doors on them and some without.Adames led them to one alcove, and pressed against the back wall.It turned on an axis, and he ducked through the opening, motioning for them to follow.The large room beyond was fitted out as a hospital ward.Iron bedsteads lined the walls, and about twenty patients lay in them, some asleep, some twitching or moaning softly.Gavin automatically pulled back from the smell of sickness in the place, then forced himself to enter.One corner was set up with cupboards and tables covered with medical equipment and supplies.Washtubs and buckets held both water and effluvia waiting to be disposed of.Lamps hung on the walls to provide soft light.A woman in a nuns habit bustled over, and Gavin realized with a start that she was an automaton.The habit hid her body, but her face was metallic, as were her hands.Vater, she said quizzically, wer sind denn diese Leute?English, Berta, if you please, he said.I dont think our guests speak German.Are there any changes?Some.Bertas voice buzzed slightly, and the grill that made up her mouth didnt move when she spoke.Clarissa has become worse.I fear she wont last the night.Adames crossed himself.Perhaps we can help now.Monsignor!Alice said.I thought the Catholic Church strictly forbade human automatons.Thats why we keep everyone down here, he said blandly.Berta can minister to our patients without catching the disease herself or passing it on to others, and she doesnt require rest.Im trusting you and God to keep the secret.We are the only hospital in Luxembourg for those afflicted by the plague.Is it not against priestly vows to disobey your Pope?Feng asked.It wouldnt look good on our application to be declared a cathedral, Adames admitted.And if the Pope learns of it, we will forever remain a church, and I will never become an archbishop.Its still a sin, Alice said.How do you reconcile that?We sin when we miss the mark of perfection, Adames replied.
