she asks, and I can hear the urgency in her voice.Im not supposed to be here.If someone finds me here, this whole plan is ruined.Which is exactly what a spy would say.Try to push for a decision.But I dont have many other options, and Im running out of time.If this saves me from more simulated drowning, its enough.Okay, I say.How are you going to get the pumps out?Its night, she says, and Im on patrol duty.Malcolm is supposed to be checking in, but he has a thing for me, and I think I can convince him to give me an hour or two.That still sounds risky, I say.It is.But you said you need those pumps.I nod.Ill be back for you soon, she says.Be ready.Wait, I say.Whats your name?Sarah, she says.Then she leaves me to wait.In the dark.And I start thinking about my poor choices.SEVEN All those years ago, back at the police storage facility, I had crept back in to hear a male voice I didnt recognize.The only two men on this job were Mal and me, and I knew Mals annoying tone well enough.So I kept a tight hold on my fathers revolver and moved forward, crouched low to the ground.And heres one of the parts that Im not proud of.I thought of leaving.I had the feeling that the job was losing gas, and I thought to myself, Your airship is still outside.You could grab it and leave.I thought it.Two things kept me there.One was obviously Claudia.Our relationship was ...difficult to define.I dont know that I was in love with her.Not the way the books describe at least.It was ...something else.She was closer than a friend, not quite family.We fucked, yes, and I enjoyed it but she was, I dont know, a kindred spirit.Someone who had my back.Someone whos back I always had.I wasnt going to just abandon her.The other thing that kept me there was, frankly, the stash.The score.It was supposed to set me up for a long time, and I wasnt going to turn my back on that.But I like to believe that Claudia came first.As I moved forward, I could hear the words more clearly.Cheyenne said, You sold it to me!The male barked a laugh.So that youd do all the hard work.We figured youd set up a team, clear the area, break in, and, uh, take all the risk.He had a deep voice, with a kind of slow drawl to it.We, I noted.He said we.And you did!The man said.His voice sounded delighted.So now weve come to, uh, take whats ours.After we take care of you.You are a liar and a coward, Cheyenne said, her voice sharp.I wear all kinds of shoes, the man said.Then I heard a gunshot.It sent me moving around the corner, the gun up, trying to take in what was happening.I saw the open room.Mal stood by the table, and Cheyenne was in his arms, a large, bloody gunshot in her chest.She jerked, gasped.She wasnt coming back from that.Tess and Claudia were nearer to one of the armored vehicles.Thankfully okay.We proved to be five men, standing in the middle of the room, holding rifles and shotguns.Considering that only Mal and Claudia could shoot, they seemed to have the drop on everyone.But they didnt know I was there.I raised my pistol, bracing my shooting arm with my left arm, and I fired, aiming for the stranger nearest me.I remember he wore a puffy, black, leather jacket, and the shot hit him in the shoulder.I was lining up my next shot when the room erupted into a mess of gunfire.Two of the men turned to shoot at me, one of them the man that I hit.Mal reached for a gun and began to fire, but one of the men turned to shoot at him, with no cover, and the other two started shooting at Claudia and Tess.Shots filled the air as we all began firing.Then we all dropped into cover.I ducked back around the corner from the room.Claudia and Tess took shelter behind the vehicle.I saw Mal dive behind some weapons cases.Theres too many, I kept on thinking.I fired from my cover, keeping my eyes on the newcomers.I couldnt tell what was happening to Mal or to Claudia and Tess.I heard a cry, male from the sound of it, but I couldnt be sure.Then hell ripped open.An explosion in one corner of the room.Then another.Then smoke.We were packed into the space with explosives and weapons all around.I couldnt tell who was using them or who might have been hit.I just knew where Tess and Claudia were.I ran.Forward.I held the revolver down by my waist, close to my body, so it couldnt get easily knocked away.When I reached where the men had been, I fired.Once.Twice.Three times.I didnt know if I hit anyonefriend or enemy.By that time, my ears were ringing from the gunfire and explosions.A fire was raging in one corner of the room.Something whizzed by my head, a near miss, but I kept moving.Finally, I reached the armored vehicle, moving my way around the side with my free hand, trying to keep hold of the revolver as I coughed and choked.A hand fell on my arm, gripped tight, and yanked me.I brought up the revolver.And had to stop myself from shooting at that last moment.I caught sight of Claudias face through the smoke.She pulled me to where Tess crouched.Can you get this thing working again?I yelled.Shots were still going off.I think so, Tess said.Then do it.I turned and fired, trying to give her cover as she climbed into the drivers seat.Claudia fired as well, using a gun she no doubt took from the stash.In the swirling smoke, I saw several dark figures.Muzzle flashes, from shotguns and worse.Automatic rifle fire peppered the area, and we had to duck down.I was leaning against the Big Black Beast when it roared to life, the vibration shaking through my bones.In!I yelled to Claudia.She slid open the door and pushed inside, and I was right behind her.Drive!I yelled to Tess.Where?Were going to have to break through the door.Quickly!She pushed a few buttons, shifted a stick, and then we were moving.It took a moment for the engine to truly kick in, and then we were rushing straight at the door.Hold on!Tess said, through gritted teeth.I braced myself, trying to stay low, behind the front set of seats.We hit hard.Despite my attempts to hold myself secure, I crumpled against the front seats, and Claudia crashed into me.Tess jerked in the drivers harness.Shaking my head clear, I saw that the door had buckled but was still in place.Again!I roared.Tess shifted again, pulling the thing into reverse.Gunfire raked across the back of the vehicle, and I hoped that its armor would hold.At least anyone behind us would have to move for fear of being run over.Tess tried to give us as much room as possible to move, and we collided with something, some of the boxes or one of the tables.I fell against the back door, feeling the vibrations of the gunfire against it.I dont know how many times we can do this, Tess said.Just do it.She shifted and pushed forward, trying to gain momentum.This time I wrapped myself into a harness and Claudia did the same.I braced for impact.It was worse this time, jerking us forward, whip like.My head felt like a stone on the end of a piece of rope.When my vision cleared, I could see that the door had come loose of the frame on one side, and daylight was peeking through.Almost there!I screamed, trying to ignore the pain in my muscles and bones.Tess didnt reverse this time.She just gunned the engine, pushing it as far as it would go.The big tires bit against the ground of the warehouse, and the door buckled further.Steam or smoke or both poured out of the front of the Beast, which I now could tell was buckled as well.Gunfire still peppered us, and in the back I could see the where the bullets had stressed the metal.More bullets, and they could pierce it.Turns out I didnt have to worry about bullets.One of the men must have gotten his hands on an explosive of some kind because the whole Beast shook as something hit it in the rear and ripped a hole in the back.Flame licked at its edges, and I could smell the fuel.Whether that little bit of impact helped, or whether Tesss persistence worked, we finally pushed through the door and into sunlight.I scrambled forward, pulling on my harness, grabbing the wheel and helping Tess to steer, remembering the layout of the cars.We hit the one right in front of us, sending it spinning away, then another on the side.Head straight for the Cherub!I slid to the back of the Beast, looking through the jagged hole there.Flames still licked at its edges, but I could see the warehouse.The men had come out through the ripped open doors, firing at us.And there, for a moment, I saw him.Mal.He was stumbling forward, bloody and blackened.But alive.But just next to three of the men.Our eyes met there across the space.His were pleading.Mine were ...well, I couldnt see them, could I?I turned back to Tess and said, Keep moving!The meters passed, and we were halfway to the ship when another explosion ripped into the back.The Beast jumped in the air but came down again, and Tess pushed it forward.I pulled Claudia to me as the flames spread throughout the back, the structure an open, flaming mess.I was pretty sure one of our tires was flat, based on the angle of the floor.When I turned back, though, we were almost to the Cherub.In a last move of genius, Tess swerved, spinning the Beast so that its side would be between us and the warehouse, giving us better cover.Out!I yelled and we pushed out of the near side and ran for the Cherub.Behind us there was more gunfire.I moved as quickly as I could to open the ramp.Turns out I didnt need to.The ramp was open.As I stumbled up it, my head ringing, my bones aching, I saw why.A man, probably one of the same crew, writhed on the ground inside the cargo bay.Hed stepped on one of my traps, a bear trap that I had hidden under some old ballonet skin.The trap had bitten deep into his legs.I ignored him for the moment as he moaned.I needed to get us up into the air.Claudia, deal with him!And guide Tess in.Wouldnt do to have her get her leg bitten off, too.Claudia did what she did, even managing to dump the man out of the Cherub as I warmed up the engines.Then I was taking us up, pushing the engines to full before one of the strangers could fire an explosive at my baby.As we pulled away from the ground, Claudia came up to me.What about Malik?she asked.I couldnt meet her eyes.Hes probably dead, I said.Then, as if trying to convince myself.We cant go back for him.Its not worth the risk.I remember her face in that moment, concerned, sympathetic, maybe even a little disappointed.But she nodded in the end.I pulled away into the sky, pushing thoughts of Mal behind, grateful that we had escaped with our lives.The score was a bust.We had been played.We came away with nothing.But at least we were alive.At the time, that was more important than anything else, any haul, any agreement, anybody.Or at least thats what I kept telling myself.But its no wonder Mal hates me.EIGHT I only realize Ive fallen into something resembling sleep when I start awake as the door opens.As my eyes search the darkness for a face, I hear Sarah say, Quick, get up.I do and she pulls out a knife.Turn around, she says.I hesitate for a moment, but then I realize that they could have and still could kill me anytime that they want.So I turn around, and she slips a knife into my restraints.She saws at them a bit and then they pull away.I immediately start massaging my wrists where the bindings bit into them.So far Im buying that she really wants out of this place.I stand and try to ignore the protests in my body.The wave of lightheadedness that washes through me.Lets get the fuck out of here.Sarah opens the door to make sure the hall is clear then, before I can push my way out the door, she pulls a bundle out of a backpack and tosses it at me.Whats this?Its a uniform, she says.Put it on.Why?She sighs.Because in the clothes youre wearing right now, you stand out.Put that on, and a cap, and you wont raise suspicion right away.Good idea, I say.The uniform is carefully folded.I quickly strip off my clothes and put on the uniform, handing my clothes to Sarah.She stuffs them into her backpack.The uniforms a little tight in the shoulders and loose around the waist, but it mostly fits.My boots arent exactly the same as theirs, but theyre dark enough that they should pass a quick look.I return to the hallway when Im done, fitting the cap down on my head.She grabs me by the shoulders, and for a moment I almost hit her.But I control myself when I see her face.You have to promise me, she says.No killing.I frown.Your friends have guns, I say.I dont.Im not going to promise if it comes down to them or me.Guns, yes.Ammo, no.What?She sighs again.Were low on ammunition.This place?A Navy base?I assumed youd have ammo coming out of your ears.She shakes her head.A lot of it was taken when the outbreak hit.Weve been forced to trade away some of what remained for food and other supplies.Theres a small cache left, but its rarely used.Were all trained in unarmed fighting.Just seeing the number of guns scares a lot of people away.I nod.I have to admit that I fell for it, too.Its a risky but smart gamble.Captain Danning and Commander Marcus carry loaded weapons, though.Of course, I think.Cant risk a mutiny.Shes still looking at me.Expectantly.Okay, I say.No killing.It feels like the truth, but I cant be sure.We get Whistler and Chase and then get out of here, I say.We start moving down the hallway.Wait, I say.Our weapons.They were stored in the guard station.We need to go there, too.Are you crazy?she hisses.Thats the most heavily guarded part of the base.We cant go back there.I need that revolver, I say.She meets my eyes.No.Were standing in the middle of the hallway, and any minute now someone could walk down it and spoil our plan.She doesnt seem like shes going to budge.Not now.Fine, Ill deal with it later.But Im not leaving without my fathers revolver.Okay.Lets go.Now that were out in the light, I can see what Sarah looks like.Shes young, less than twenty, I would guess.Brownish skin, short, black hair.Slight.Yet theres something in the way she stands, her posture, her movements.Evidence of some kind of training.We walk down a few corridors, take a left then a right, then another left.The hallways are empty.I bring that up to Sarah.Were spread pretty thin here.There arent as many of us as there used to be.Were all of you born here?I ask.You dont recruit from the outside?We used to, Sarah says.When I was a child.But not anymore.Captain Danning stopped trusting anyone who wasnt Navy.She was afraid that letting outsiders in would distract us from our purpose.Pretty much all of us left have Navy in our blood.I think about that.Are they really just the descendants of the base personnel?It would make sensehere they had security, safety.So they just ...stayed.And theyll just stay here, guarding the base, until what?She sighs.The captain believes that a call will come.That after all of this time, whats left of the United States government will reestablish itself and take control of the country.There have been rumors for years that theyre regaining ground back east.Then why not try to join them there?Sarah stops walking for a moment to look at me.Like my question was crazy.Because this is our charge.This base, and everything it contains.The captain sees it as a sacred duty.If this base were to fall ...she believes that can never happen.Thats why shes interrogating you.She believes youre here for other reasons.She thinks youre after our secrets.She starts walking again.I dont give a Ferals ass about your secrets, I say.They can die with them, I think.Waiting for a call that will never come.You keep saying she believes.What do you believe?Shes silent for a long moment.I dont ...Im not sure.She halts me for a second, her palm out.She looks around the next turn.I used to believe what the captain believes.And now?She looks back at me, her face a map of conflicting emotions.I think that its a big world out there.And I think I havent seen any of it.And I think if I stay here, I never will.She moves on.But you said that you left the base a few times.Supply runs?Yes, she says.When I made ensign, I was allowed to go on supply runs.Foraging?She shakes her head.Mostly just trading.We have gardens, but were always a bit low on food.She holds up a hand again at the next hallway.This time I poke my head around after she does.A guard stands there.He looks bored.Let me deal with this, she whispers.Sarah turns the corner and walks up to the guard and starts talking to him.The guard looks to her, and I see a tenseness in his posture.His voice raises, and she starts trying to talk over him.One hand reflexively goes to the butt of the gun around his shoulder.Its going bad already.Without really thinking, I round the corner and shout at the guard to attract his attention, then start running toward him.His alarm grows and he turns full on to face me, and I hope that Sarah was right about him not having ammunition.Then she grabs him from behind.One arm goes against his neck, and the other arm grabs the first.The guards own hands rise to try to grab Sarahs arm, but she holds firm, even when her feet come up off the ground as the taller guard bucks.Just as Im reaching them both, the guard goes down, Sarah dropping to the ground with him, keeping her grip secure.I stare down at her.That was great, I say.I told you I would deal with this.It didnt look like it was going well.Her face screws up.Hurry up and open the door.The guards keys are clipped to his belt, so I grab them and open the door.Chase is inside, a bag over her head.I pull it off, then pull her out of the cell.Sarah is already pushing the guard in in her place.Hes starting to stir, so I bunch up the dark cloth bag and stuff as much of it as I can into his mouth.His eyes flicker open and look at me in alarm, but then Im pushing him down and shutting the door, locking it with the keys.Sarah is already freeing Chases hands with a long bladed knife.What the fuck is going on?Chase hisses at me.Were getting out of here, I say.What about the pumps?Ive handled the pumps, Sarah says.In return for you taking me with you.Chase opens her mouth, and I can tell shes going to ask more questions, so I cut her off.No time.We have to get Whistler out and then we have to get back to the Raven.Chase frowns.Ill get you out, Sarah insists, but you cant kill anyone.Try it and Ill stop helping you.Got it?I ask Chase.Okay.She says.Sarah passes her a uniform, too, and she puts it on, tucking her hair underneath the cap.Whistler?I ask Sarah.She nods and leads us down more corridors.I tell Chase to get behind us.Even with the uniform, her unique haircut is more likely to give us away.And none of us have any viable weapons.Sarah slows and turns back to us.Whistlers being held around the next corner.She pokes her head around.There isnt anyone guarding the cell.Ill stand outside with Chase.You go inside and get Whistler.She hands me the knife.I nod.Im still holding the keys from the guard Sarah took down.She and Chase take up position while I open the door.When it swings open, I have a shock.Commander Marcus is standing in front of me.The Commander turns to me in surprise and I slam my fist, still holding the keys, into his face.Then I drop the keys, grab his head, and slam it into the wall.I punch him in the side, then kick his leg.He crumples to the ground.Hes down on the ground, and a hot rage fills me.I start kicking him, delighting in the impact of my boots on his body.How do you like it?I ask.This feel good?I stare at his face even as it contorts in pain.Its too groomed.Too perfect.Too clean.I think about him carefully shaving himself.Cleaning himself.Safe here behind walls, with big guns to keep others away.Its false.The world is dirty and rough and chaotic.He offends me.His cleanliness offends me.He needs to be dirtied up.Roughed up.Bloodied.The moment the thought hits me, I realize what Im doing and fall back, panting.I was ready to kill this man.I hear Mirandas voice in my mind saying, simply, Ben.And most of the rage and anger falls away.Its not important.None of this is really important.I feel the cold of the oily water as it soaked into my skin.Imagine Miranda there.I shake my head.When I look down at Marcus, hes not moving.Unconscious, then.I turn to see Whistler looking at me with a strange, intense expression of enjoyment.It sends a shiver down my back.Now do I get a turn?No, I say.We need to get out of here.I move around and cut through the restraints.One of their people is getting us out of here in return for a ride out with us.I never agreed to taking anyone else with us, Whistler says.I clench my jaw.Shes getting us out of here, so were taking her.Shes also getting us the pumps.If you want to return to Mal without them, then its on you.Whistler glares at me, and I can see the thoughts warring inside that thick head.Fine.Well take her.I notice another bag on the ground, discarded, and I pick it up and wad it into the commanders mouth like I did with the other guard.It should help buy us a little time.Then I catch sight of whats strapped to the commanders leg.A very familiar revolver.In Mals leg holster.I reach down and remove the holster.Its my fathers revolver all right.Makes sense.Marcus was the one who pulled it off of me.If ammo is as tight as Sarah said, I can see him holding onto this.I leave the commander on the floor and exit with Whistler.This is Sarah, I say.Sarah, your commander was in there.You didnt hurt him, did you?she asks.I scratch my head.Just a little bit.He put up a struggle, I lie.Hell live.She moves to the door, looks into the window.What she sees apparently satisfies her.I didnt want anyone hurt.Hell pull through, Whistler says.Lets worry more about us instead.Agreed, Chase says.Fine, Sarah says.Lets go.I can take us out a different way.I know where the patrols go.We can get into a car and avoid them.What about our weapons?Chase asks.They took Sully off of me.Sarah looks at me, pleading.The weapons are probably still near the gate.If we go that way, theyll definitely be alerted.But I can sneak you out the back way.Down to the water.Then we can circle around to wherever your ship is.Sounds good to me, I think.I already have my revolver.I realize that makes me a hypocrite, but fuck itWhistler and Chase arent exactly my friends.Take us out the back way, I say to Sarah.The thing about the base is that its actually pretty large.Fenced in, yes, but the living quarters, according to Sarah, arent that close to the water and the officers use a series of cars to get around inside the grounds.Its into one of these that Sarah ushers us.Ill keep the lights off, she says.I should be able to navigate well enough in the dark.Ive been doing it most of my life.Are there other cars out here?I ask.Yes, she says.But Im hoping well be able to avoid them.The car is an open topped vehicle, with four seats and a simple windshield.The hope is that right now we look like four uniformed, completely belonging in this base individuals.And with the lights off, hopefully we wont call attention to ourselves.What about the pumps?Whistler hisses.I put them in a raft, dropped them into the sound, Sarah says.The what?Whistler asks.The water, Sarah says.The current should take them north.I put a tracker in with them.We should be able to find them once we get into the water.Or the air, I say.Im starting to get desperate to be back in the air.Im sick of water.Being on it.Having it forced into my body.All of it.The car hits a bump and we all go lurching.Watch where youre going, Whistler grunts.I cant see very well!Sarah says.Im doing the best that I can.Leave her alone, I say to Whistler.I realize that Ive started thinking that Sarah is on my side, and Whistler and Chase arent, but that isnt exactly true.I dont know that I can trust Sarah or that I cant trust Whistler and Chase.I just want to get back to the Phoenix.Weve been driving for a little while when we see the flash of lights nearby.Shit, Sarah says.I watch as the lights swivel toward us and another car, one very like ours, starts moving toward us.Theyre coming after us, I say.I know!Sarah says.She guns the engine and we shoot ahead, which throws me back against my seat.But when I regain my position I see the other car matching speed with us.I think I see two people inside the vehicle.Try to keep her steady, I say.I draw the revolver and fire behind us, trying to hit one of the two dark figures I think I see inside the car.There has to be someone driving it, I think.At the very least.No!Whistler screams into my ear.Shoot for the lights!So I do.Or at least I try to.Sarah is swerving the vehicle around, and I cant seem to get a steady bead on anything.The first shot seems to go off into darkness.The second follows it.The third shot hits the vehicle, but I dont see it do anything.And now Im down to a handful of shots left.Im just lining up a fourth shot when we hit something.Hard.For a moment, I feel the impact, and then were spinning through the air and Im tossed from the car onto the hard ground.The trauma of the last few days has weakened me and its all I can do to maintain consciousness as I roll against the ground, trying to suck in air, feeling the abrasions on my skin as I slam into the ground.Amazingly, my revolver is nearby, just out of my reach, or at least I assume so judging by the three identical images that are spinning through my vision.As those three images resolve into one, I see a soldier, a man in a Navy uniform, moving toward us, a rifle in his hand.He fires and I see the muzzle flash, hear the retort of the gun even through my ringing ears.I dont have time to think much, no time to analyze or plan.I scramble for the revolver, scoop it up into my grip, and sight on the soldier.His shots are tearing up the ground around us, and I squeeze the trigger.Once, then twice.I dont know what hits and what doesnt, but I see him jerk back and fall to the ground.Then, energized by my little victory, I scramble to my feet and move forward to the other soldier, revolver out.I move toward the vehicle, but ...theres no one else there.Just the one.Sarah comes running up beside me, grabs onto my arm and pulls it down.I told you not to hurt anyone!Her voice is on the edge of hysterics.I turn to look at her, suddenly cold.He was going to kill one of us.You.Me.Whistler or Chase.I had no choice.She runs to the body, bending down over it, but I grab her and pull her off and toward the other car.Ours is tipped on its side, and I dont know if it works or not.Get in, I say, pushing her toward it.She turns to me, defiant, with tear filled eyes.Get in, I repeat.There are going to be others coming soon.With more guns.And they will be shooting to kill.I didnt want it to happen like this, she says, in almost a sob.It is happening like this, I say.And we have to get out of here.Sarah stands there for a moment, her shoulders heaving.If you dont leave with usnowthey will get you.The best I think you can hope for is a life in a cell.She looks up at me and suddenly seems to come to.She knows better than anyone else what kind of punishment she might face.And I can see it dawning on her.Get into the car.We need to get to the water.She nods, dumbly, and gets into the car.Whistler gives me a quick nod and gets in as well, followed by Chase.I run back to the fallen soldier, pick up his rifle.Hes moaning and writhing on the ground.I have no idea if hell make it.I guess it depends on whether other people find him or not.I consider putting a bullet in himit might be the merciful thing to dobut the truth is, more than the promise I made to Sarah, I dont want to waste the ammo.So I crawl into the car and tell Sarah to go.We ride off into the night.We reach the water without incident.With a little coaxing, Sarah gets the raft and together we lower it into the water.She seems in shock, and while a small part of me sympathizes, I find the larger part of me has no patience for it.She made her decisiondecided to turn on her crazy cult family, and this is what happened.After their torture, and trying to kill me, and all of us, I just have no patience left.So we all jump into the raft and pull out into the sound.Will they come after us?I ask Sarah.Shes huddled up in one corner of the raft, knees up near her head, her hands over her face.She doesnt answer me at first.Sarah, I say, firmly.She looks up at me.It all went wrong, she says.Will they come after us?I ask again.She shakes her head.No.Not right away.It will take them a little while to figure out what happened and where we went.Like I said ...were spread thin.By the time they can organize, we should be picked up.Which brings me to my next question, I say, looking to Whistler and Chase.How are we going to get the Raven to come to us?Nobody answers, but Sarah reaches into a pocket of her uniform and pulls out a flare gun.Whistler takes it.Its a good idea.Normally I would be worried about someone else seeing it, but if Sarah is right, were ahead of them.If we can get close enough to the Raven to signal to them, we should be okay.All I can think of, though, is Miranda.As I sit in the back of the boat, salty spray peppering my face, I just see her in my mind.Its because of me that her life is in danger, because of my actions that shes at Mals mercy.I have to save her, I think.Have to get her out of there, bring her back to Tamoanchan.Fix things.As Whistler fires the flare into the sky, I think that theres more than just one sinking ship to save.NINE As the Raven approaches the Phoenix, I notice the other airships flying in formation above it.I count five in total, a mix of designs from cargo ships to small passenger dirigibles.But what draws my eye is a long, flat airship, its envelope a matte grey blue that almost seems to blend into the sky.Ive never seen a ship like it before.Whats that?I ask.Chang looks up at me, then where Im pointing.He smiles.Thats Maliks ship.The Argus.Figures, I think.Mal would have a unique ship like that.I wonder where he got it.Hes been very busy since I saw him last.Whistler verifies our identity over the radio and then lowers us to the Phoenix.Looking down on it from the Raven, I almost think I can see it riding low in the water.We descend and the ladder is lowered and I push my way to it.Whistler gives me a look, but I give Whistler a look right back that says dont fucking get in my way.The ladder barely hits the deck before Im down it.Mal is there with several of his people.Armed.I spare a look for Mal.I got your pumps, I say.Whistler will tell you all about it.Then I push through them, heading for the stairwell.I hear Mal behind me saying, Let him go.I tear down into the bowels of the ship, calling after Miranda.I vaguely remember my trip from the lower levels up to the deck, so I try to retrace it, heading down, running up and down corridors, calling her name all the time.I run from one stairwell to another, descending deeper into the ship.There are lights down here, but theyre dim, emergency lighting of some sort.I go down, ever down, until I hit water.Until I find where the ocean is encroaching.Miranda!I yell.Miranda!I splash through the water, hoping to hear her answering voice.But I cant hear it.I pause, realizing that my legs are kicking up water, that the sound might be blocking her.Nothing but the creaking of the ship.Somewhere I dont want to look, a voice that I dont want to hear starts whispering to me.What if she?No.Miranda!I keep on like that, calling, searching, quietly despairing, until a voice stills me.Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin.I turn and see Mal, perched on the edge of the stairs, looking at me.Where is she?I ask.He smiles.A wide, self satisfied smile.The dim lighting makes him look demonic.She is safe.The smile grows even wider, something I didnt think possible.Shes aboard my airship.What?Come now, Benjamin.Do you really think that little of me?That I would toss away the life of an innocent?But you said I said exactly what I needed to do to cause you pain.To make you work for me.To get you to dance.You care for Miranda, that much is obvious.Why wouldnt I use that?You bastard.Clearly, Benjamin, you still have a lot to learn.So much.You use whatever tools are at your disposal ...without compromising your own integrity.Your morals.I know, I know.You think me a beast.A villain.He shrugs.Perhaps I am.Perhaps I have been.But Im not the only one.I feel my shoulders slump.Hes defeated me.I got you your pumps, I say.He nods, crosses his arms in front of his chest.So I was told.As well as another guest.That was the cost of getting the pumps out.Mal nods.So Whistler said.He waves a hand through the air.Its a small matter, he says.Assuming your pumps work.They should, I say.Well see.So what happens now?My people will replace the pumps.Perhaps our newcomer will help us.If they work as promised, things will return to normal.We will continue to Hawaii as planned.And Miranda and me?I ask.I will fulfill my part of the promise, he says.You will come with us to Hawaii.And then?He shrugs.I havent yet decided.And if the pumps dont work?I ask, dreading the answer.He smiles wickedly.If not, Benjamin, I will enjoy seeing you suffer.Now.He examines his gloves.Have you ever heard of keelhauling?No.Its an old nautical punishment.I found it in a book.The ...criminal is tied to a rope and pulled across the ships keel.The bottommost part.I think that will be a fitting end.And what happens to Sarah?That I dont know.Maybe shell stay with us.Maybe shell go.It all depends.I meet his eyes.The pumps will work.He holds his hands out, palms up.Then we all will prosper.I want to see Miranda.He smiles again.I want to have a working, non sinking ship.Then he turns and climbs the steps, slamming the heavy metal door behind him.Mal locks me in with the people working on the pumps.My fate was tied up with the pumps, he said.Might as well be there in the thick of it.Two of Mals men, accompanied by Sarah, are now splashing through the flooded Phoenix.How is it going?I ask Sarah.She frowns up at me in the dim light.Were not allowed to use open flame down heretoo much engine oil and other substancesbut Mals people have a solar charged light that theyre using as they replace the pumps.Ben, let me work, she says before turning back to the task at hand.Shes been chilly to me since we left the base.She thinks I broke the rules by shooting that soldier.I would feel guilty except I know that it was either him or one of us.Besides, he might have lived.If he got attention in time.The truth is, I dont care either way.Sarah and the two men are working to release one of the broken pumps, crowded in around it.I get the feeling that the water is interfering with their efforts.My problem is that theres not much for me to do.I cant fix the pumps.I cant really help them with fixing the pumps.All I can do is think about the rising water.And Miranda.Wherever the fuck she is.Hold this, Sarah says, splashing over to me.She passes me a large wrench.She wipes a hand across her head, smearing it with greasy water.Whats between you and this Mal?Its a long story, I say.Okay, she says, holding up her hands.Dont tell me, then.I need to concentrate.Sarah returns to the pumps, and I watch her and Mals men work.The sad part about all of this is that a part of me appreciates what it is that Mal is doing.Leading his people away.Trying to give them a home, some security.Ive never been much of a joiner, I only started working with the boffins in the last year, but in another place, another time, I might do something similar in his place.But to give up the air...Whats really bothering me is that even if they get these pumps working, its back to my cell for me.Miranda will be safe, which is good, but Ill be a prisoner until we reach Hawaii.I took my shot already, and Mal easily disarmed me.Its unlikely that Ill get another chance.So where does that leave me?Is this what I have to look forward to?Another week or so belowdecks before the end?God, I miss the sky.I miss the Cherub.I miss Miranda.We need to get back to Tamoanchan, to make sure everyone is okay.And if they are?Ive been thinking about it, in bits and pieces.Returning to the Frothy Brew for a beer.Visiting Rabbi Cohen.Seeing Sergei.I even had this vague, unformed idea of maybe getting my way back onto a ship.Running forage for the island.Making myself useful.And staying near Miranda.Things always go wrong when I leave Miranda.I shiver as the freezing water soaks into my bones.Its hard to tell how quickly the water is rising because it always seems to be around my thighs.Any luck?I call out.In the last few minutes?Sarah says.Fuck.I try to think about what Miranda would do in this situation.She rarely ever freaks out.She has a methodical mind.I used to think it frustrated me, but here in the dark I realize that I admire it.I admire her.Her mind is a thing of beauty.Maybe I should try to emulate it more.So ...whats next?This isnt the end.If the pumps are restored, I wont get keelhauled.Which would be very good.Then Mal puts me back into my cell, but only until we reach Hawaii.Then hes going to have to get me off the ship.Whatever punishment he sees fit to deliver will work best in front of an audience.Thats how Mal works.There will be opportunities.I just need to see Miranda.Then together we can try to make an escape.But back to Tamoanchan, Ben?My natural cynicism jumps all over this, but I try to channel Mirandas optimism.Why not?Maybe I can steal an airship.Take us back up into the sky and away from Mal and his people.I got my ship back from the middle of an armed helium plant, didnt I?And that was without Miranda.Of course all of this depends on me not being keelhauled.So I really hope that Sarah knows what shes doing.Any progress?I call out.She doesnt answer this time.Just throws back her arm, flips up her hand and extends her middle finger.Its an old gesture but one that hasnt lost its meaning.Cute.How else to get back to Tamoanchan?Im no sailor, but maybe we could steal a raft or boat.Surely wed have to wash ashore at some point.Maybe we could get passage aboard a passing ship.Have them put me down somewhere like where I met up with Diego.Somewhere on a route where he might find me.But thats a long shot, especially since Diego is a beaten and bloody mess at the moment.No easy answers.What Im good at is flying.Surviving.Killing Ferals.Being a bastard.You know, the usual.I wonder if maybe I could track down Claudia.My oldest friend, former lover, comrade in arms, and the most dangerous woman Ive ever met.Last I saw her, she was still on Gastown.I hope she didnt get herself caught in all the chaos that was happening.If I could get in touch with Claudia, then she could take us to Tamoanchan.But ...I dont know how I would do that.And for some reason the thought of having Claudia and Miranda on the same ship makes me uncomfortable.Things were much easier before I went and started having feelings.Then I think about Lord Tess.Maybe she would know a way to get back to the island.She certainly knew about Tamoanchan.Maybe she could put us in touch with someone who could take us there.I have to return anyway to pay her back.The more I think about it, that looks like the best option.She came through with the pumps.And if were lucky, Mals people will drop us right there.All this assuming, of course, that the island is still there.That other raiders didnt strike it.That it hasnt been destroyed or evacuated or I hear a wet coughing sound followed by a whoop of success from Sarah and the two men.You got it working?I ask.The first one, she says.Even in the dim light I see her smiling.But it works.The others should be easy.I feel a weight lift from me.The pumps look like theyre going to work.Sarah splashes over to me, a worried look on her face.What is it?I ask.She says in a whisper, I know these pumps.Ive worked on all kinds of pumps like these.Some of our working artillery is on the Fincher.Its in the water.We have to keep the pumps operating, otherwise she goes down.I think youve proved your skills, I say.She nods, then looks back at the men quickly.From what I can see, these pumps didnt just break down.She pauses for a moment, her face serious.I think someone deliberately damaged them.I narrow my eyes, lowering my voice to match hers.Are you sure?Id report it to my commanding officer.Hmmm.Mals little coterie might not be as cozy as they seem to be.The question I ask myself is, do I tell him?At one point, I would have without question.Now ...?I wonder if its something I can use to get out of this mess.An information exchange of my own.Ill figure it out later, I think.See what that knowledge might be worth.Sarah asks for the wrench, and Im about to pass it to her when I hear the door to the room start to open.I think they must have been hovering outside the door to have come so quickly after the first pump was replaced.I step back as it opens.And a body falls through it.TEN FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA Ben is back.Not that Malik told me, of course, but I was able to pick it upfrom some of his people, from overhearing them talk.They have him trying to get the pumps working againbut apparently hes not alone.Which seems strange.My instincts tell me that if he brought someone back, its because its help that we needor at least that he believes that.Ben isnt overly trusting, though, so if he believes, theres a good chance that it will work.I hope.I dont know that I trust that much in Ben these days.He did return, thats true, but then I was never in that much danger after all.What matters most is the future.Everything right now hinges on the pumps working.If they dont, then the ship goes down and Malik will take his revenge on Ben and theres nothing Ill be able to do about it.If the pumps do work, Ben goes back into his cell.Until we reach Hawaii.Then ...I dont think I can protect Ben any longer.Everything Ive seen says that Malik wont be able to let this go.Let Ben go.Hes held on to this hate for too long.He needs some outlet for it.And he needs spectacle.Malik once came in to see me for a cut on his arm, near the shoulder, something that he sustained while making repairs.He took his shirt off so that I could examine it.He had scars all over his torsocruel looking scars that were probably the result of torture.He didnt explain, but I got the feeling that they were the result of Ben leaving him behind.Those marks might as well be the language of his hate, etched into his skin, never to go away.So, yeah ...hes going to want his revenge.I do believe that Malik will let me go, though.He still likes me, and he has no cause to punish me.So even if he keeps Ben, I would be fine.There are some people I know, who would tell me to let that happen.That no matter what happened to Ben, I should get out, get free.They would say that the data in my pocket is worth more than any one man.That it could save hundreds, maybe thousands.Only ...I could never do that, of course.I couldnt leave, knowing Ben was headed for death.I couldnt let one man die, especially Ben, even if it would save more.So I have to figure out a way to get off of this boat, to get both of us off of this boat, and then we both need to get back to Tamoanchan as quickly as we possibly can.Tamoanchan...Im deathly afraid that something happened to the island.I find myself thinking often lately of Clay and Sergei.I left them all alone to go off with Ben to Gastown.And now I wonder, why?Ben needed help, I know, but I abandoned my people to do so.Went with him to chase after the Cherub.In the end it got me the data from Gastown, but my thoughts keep returning to Sergei and Clay.I hope that the people of Tamoanchan have been good to them, and have kept them fed and supplied.I hope that nothing went wrong with Alpha, our resident Feral test subject.When Ben convinced the Council to set them up on a nearby island, isolated, alone, I was so angry with him.But as Ive had time to think about it, its the only realistic way we could have received permission to study a live Feral in an inhabited outpost.Were smart people, we have protocols, but maybe Ive caught some of Bens fear of Ferals.Even the best designed system can sometimes fail.But its not just Clay and Sergei who I think of.I think of all the others back at Apple Pi, all those who died or went missing after the raiders attacked.It took years to assemble that group of expertssome of the finest minds in biology and medicine and virology.We were never sure what happened to most of them when our lab at Apple Pi was sacked.Some of them died, of course.Im not naive enough to think otherwise.But Ben, who was there, assured me that some of them escaped.How many or who?I dont know.We didnt have time to even look for them, to try to trace anyone who might have been there.As soon as we found Ben, it was on to Tamoanchan, then Gastown, and then Ben and I were falling into the water, watching his airship explode above us.Theres been no time to breathe.Until now, I suppose.Ive also been thinking about the kiss.I guess it was natural for Ben to kiss me just before we jumped to what could have easily been our deaths.I think that might have been the only type of circumstance that would make him throw caution out the window like that, but ...Id like to think it was more than that.I could feel it; so could he.There was much more beneath it.I once read about fungiabout how you might see just some small sign of them above ground, but that they could extend for miles, perhaps, underground.Thats how I think of how Ben and I feel about each other.It wasnt always obvious, not the least to ourselves, but there was a lot more living and breathing and, yes, lurking under the surface.Yes, I guess I am calling my feelings for Ben fungal in nature.They do seem complex and occasionally grow in interesting directions.Things are muddied, of course, by Claudia, by all accounts Bens former lover, recently returned to his life.I know that Ben has feelings for me, but does he also have feelings for her?I dont think of myself as a possessive person, but Im also not interested in competing with someone else.Its something we should probably talk about, but ...first things first.First we have to get off of this ship.Then we can figure this all out.First we have to escape.It was during dinner with Malik, our usual meeting, that I made my decision.As Malik opened another bottle of wine, I thought to myself, I cant trust this man.It had nothing to do with the wine.Just his motivations.He would always hate Benthat much was clearand the pumps Ben brought back wouldnt ultimately make a dent in that hate.We atefresh fish as usualand drank.As the wine in the bottle dwindled, I encouraged Malik to pull out something stronger.Cmon, I said.We should celebrate.You have your pumps.Your ship isnt going to sink.Well see, he said.But the truth is that I am optimistic about our chances.He took a long swallow.You didnt think I would let you go down with the ship, did you?I wasnt sure, to be honest, I said.I shrugged.Maybe.I dont really understand you.Yet.Please, he said.You must believe me.I do hate Benjamin, but you ...well, I have no problems with you.Prove it, I said.How?Open a bottle of something so that we can celebrate.So he did.Whiskey.Or rather not just whiskey, as he said, single malt scotch, a beverage far superior, in his opinion.The one he opened he swore tasted like the sea, and though I was skeptical, it was very evocative.One drink turned into two, then more.All the while, I became more charming and more flirtatious.All the while he loosened up and had more.The thing that I know that he didnt is that I can pretty much outdrink anyone.I havent met a person who can beat me.So I matched him as much as I dared, pouring more for him in the first place.Benjamin doesnt deserve you, Malik slurred.You should stay with me.Be our doctor.Live with us on Hawaii.Thats a tempting offer, I said.Can you sweeten the deal?
