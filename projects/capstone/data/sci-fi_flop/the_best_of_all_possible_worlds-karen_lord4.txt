Now that youve discovered the properties of fireberry, will you use it as an alternative to meditation?It may serve for recreational use, but I do not believe it is to be depended on in the long run.One might find oneself in a situation where the ingredients are not available.However, the disciplines can be taken anywhere that the mind goes.He gave me a considering look.Would you recommend this sense suppressant for regular use?I thought about it.I pondered Qeturahs comment about how playing the hand shed been dealt became for her a badge of honor.That can only be an individual decision, I hedged.Then let us consider a specific example.Would you recommend it for me, for example?No, I said finally.Like you said, its who you are.I wouldnt want you to be anything less than yourself.I dont know if that makes sense, but there it is.There was a rustle at the entrance, and Nasiha and Tarik came in.They were glowing with energy but smiling only very slightly.I was a bit relieved.I had been afraid they might come in laughing or doing something shocking.Nasiha was carrying a small bowl in her hands.First Officer Delarua, she said with a touch of breathlessness, we apologize for making you miss the festivities by asking you to watch Joral.Please accept this traditional regional dish as a token of our regret.I took it with a smile and a twinge of anxiety, but when I looked at it, it was familiar to me.A genuine grin spread over my face.Thank you, Nasiha!I love chocolate decadence cake!I broke off a bit and put it into my mouth.Now, this was a drug worth taking.My taste buds positively hummed in bliss at the creamy richness.I closed my eyes and moaned.There was an odd echo.I opened my eyes and caught Nasiha and Tarik watching me avidly, their palms pressed lightly together in a poor attempt at intimacy.There was a slightly guilty look on Nasihas face, but it was spoiled the next instant by a suppressed giggle.The two then exchanged a smoldering look and departed hastily.My mouthful turned to ashes.I swallowed it with difficulty and set down the dish.Perverts, I said truculently.Now Ive lost my appetite.Eat your cake, said Dllenahkh, and there was definitely a tinge of amusement in the tone of his voice.Theyre gone now, Joral is asleep, and my shields are strong.NEVER FORGET I hated talking to Qeturah about certain things, but for certain things she was the only source of information.Shes decided she hates me, hasnt she?Qeturah looked down at her handheld.Im not privy to the counseling notes of this case.Liar.Has she told Rafi not to write to me?She met my eyes at last.I dont know.But I do know that if you write to him, we will make sure that he sees it.I nodded and walked off before she could start on me again.I could write to my godson.That was all I needed to know.That made things easier.Dear Rafi I had to write.I couldnt call, because they were all under protection until the lengthy and thorough process of Ioans assessment and trial was concluded.Fergus had been rightthe authorities hadnt seen anything like Ioan on Cygnus Beta, and they werent about to take any chances.Dear Rafi, how are you, how is therapy, Theyd probably read whatever I wrote.Analyze it too for both our sakes.How are you all doing?Im fine, I grimaced at the handheld.After several efforts, the only unchanging bits of the message were Dear Rafi and Love, Aunt Grace.Perhaps I should just send that.Perhaps it was too soon.I could try again next week after I got back.I tossed the handheld into my backpack and sealed it up.Ready, Lian?I asked the aide.Lian, who was securing our shelter to a much larger military issue backpack, gave me a narrow eyed look.This is a date, right?Why are you harassing me, Lian?I sighed.Payback?Lian replied, wrestling on the pack with the ease of years of experience.At least I cant be accused of fraternization.Neither can I.  Nor cradle snatching, Lian said, taking it up a notch.Tonio is not that young!I snapped defensively.He is not that old, Lian countered, amused.Okay.Im sorry if you interpreted my entirely professional attempt to warn you about being too friendly to Joral as a demonstration of inappropriate and frivolous interest in your social life.I believed I was acting in the best interests of my colleagues.Now, can we have a little dtente here?Lian leaned forward, took hold of my face in both hands, and looked at me searchingly, all the while on the edge of laughter.You are wearing kohl for a field trip.Forestry fatigues, boots, and kohl.Whats that for, hmm?To impress the elephants?Then Lian backed off, smirking, and left before I could think of a scathing rebuttal.We had temporarily split up the team.Qeturah, Fergus, Nasiha, and Tarik were going to continue along the settlements of the grasslands, using the shuttle.And you remember Tonio, the guy who looked a little bit but not really like Ioan?It turns out he was a ranger, off duty for the festival but still very much a civil servant.Qeturah seemed to think it would be a good idea to ask Leoval to pull some strings and have him assigned to us as a guide and extra security.One of those serendipitous things Ive learned not to question.So Lian, Dllenahkh, Joral, and I were going with Tonio on a side expedition into the forest uplands to the north.It was a place too thickly wooded for shuttles and too changeable for roads, so we were going to use a traditional, efficient, and proven form of transportation: elephants.I was excited at the prospect, but when we arrived at the mahouts village, I was a little surprised.Theyre a bitsmall, I said in puzzled disappointment, resting a cautious hand on the shoulder of the elephant assigned to me.It wasnt much taller than a large sized cart horse.It flapped its ears at me in a friendly fashion and winked its small, long lashed amber eye.Lian smiled at my expression.These are forest elephants.The savanna elephants are the largest of the species and the ones you see most in the holovids.I was still excited.Big or small, elephants are elephants, after all.Just before we mounted, when I was sure no one could see me, I quickly kissed the shoulder of my beast and murmured, Hey, sweetie.Hey, darlin.That was Tonio, appearing suddenly by my shoulder.He gave me a laughing look that suggested he was either amused by or attracted to women who kiss elephants for no good reason.Or both.When not under the influence of alcohol or fireberry, Tonio was witty, cheerful, and sharp with a kind of suppressed electric energy.Even better, he was looking less and less like Ioan to me.He wore a short hooded cape that was nonregulation but very useful under the dripping trees, and occasionally, when he turned his head a certain way, it framed his strong profile in a way that called attention to his mouth.Well defined, curving, with a fullness to the lower lip that cried out for a biting kissa very nice distraction.And then Id look away again to see Lian watching me and quietly laughing.In addition to freely mocking me, Lian was generally more talkative than usual.This is where my mothers people come from.There are legends of remote monasteries where the monks walk on water and fly through the treetops.Tonio rolled his eyes, not with sarcasm but with pure mischief.This is where my fathers people come from, and there are tales of huge stone statues which point, using one appendage or another, to the secret entrances of ancient temples.There are also reports of intricate, anatomically correct carvings on the walls of those temples which demonstrate the sixty two approved sexual positions of the Marriage Code.I looked away hastily, biting my lip against laughter.Lian would tease me about always laughing at the things Tonio said.Our first river crossing occurred within minutes.The elephants, being excellent swimmers, got across quite happily by themselves, using their long trunks to snorkel through the deep water.The two legs passed dry shod over a small footbridge of rope and wood, and apart from the dubious joy of riding wet elephant, it worked very well.The second river crossing was nothing like the first.Wheres all this water coming from?asked Lian, looking at the cascading run in dismay.It was too flat to be called a waterfall but too steep to be an ordinary riverbed.There were two footbridges: a high one placed well above the churning water, strung from tree to tree upstream, and a lower one whose planks were ominously wet, resting directly on the riverbanks.The water flowed more placidly there, with greater depth and fewer rocks, but when I got closer, I gulped.The bridge was not a bridge; it was a lookout over a huge waterfall.We will take the high bridge, the mahout announced.Joral looked up at the loose sag of the swaying, fraying ropes.The high bridge does not appear to have been maintained for some time, he noted.The low bridge is too dangerous, the mahout insisted.We will swim with the elephants.Ordinarily, I would say listen to the man.His land, his river, his elephants, right?But that turbulent current was not at all reassuring.Tonio shrugged.I prefer to stay dry, he announced, and stepped lightly onto the low bridge.It gave a tiny sway, revealing that it was not wood but rope that connected the bridge to the bank landings, but he reached the other side easily.Joral and Lian quickly followed his example.By then, the mahout had ignored the general rebellion against his advice and was swimming over with the elephants, paddling easily near the head of his own beast.Dllenahkh looked at me, his eyebrow quirked in a well, arent you coming?expression.Still with slight misgivings, I went before him onto the bridge.We were hardly halfway to the other side when we heard it coming, like thunder.Dllenahkhs quickening steps set the bridge swaying so that I stumbled.He took my arm briefly to steady me and then urged me on with a light push.White water came pouring down the slope, crashing toward us with terrifying speed.Panic kept my feet moving as the wooden planks began to heave beneath me.Still trying to move forward, I watched in helpless fascination as the water surged over and under the bridge, tipping and twisting it vertical.I remember the fall.The weight of my pack pulled me immediately backward and horizontal.I looked down between my feet at the white froth of breaking water and saw Dllenahkh move quickly, reaching for me, fingers sliding along my left leg and coming to rest firmly around my ankle.Not the slightest hint of anxiety or surprise showed on his face, so it took me a while to realize that he was falling too, a vast weight of water following behind his back.He hauled me toward him, grabbed my belt with his other hand, and hauled again, reeling me in.Then he looked beyond me with an expression of intense concentration and pulled my head protectively against his shoulder.We hit.Water is hard.I lost breath, memory, and finally consciousness.I found awareness again in a dream.I was riding my elephant through wooded marshes, dry savanna, and dim green forest.He moved slowly, strongly, each step striking ground solidly yet gently.Swaying slightly with his gait, I leaned over so that my mouth came close to the languidly fanning giant ear.Dark you are, and golden eyed, I whispered to the beast.I lay on my stomach along his broad back and patted his huge head.He brought up his trunk and found my face without seeing, gently touching my cheeks and forehead.The skin of the trunks tip was soft, its dexterity handlike.His breath surrounded my face like a hot tropical breeze.I smiled.I felt so comfortable.Then the gentle brush against my skin vibrated strangely as if dragging over a patch rougher than elephant skin, like scabbing on a nasty scrape.When did that happen?I woke upand I mean woke up, because my eyes were already open and waiting for consciousness to return.There was a half healed scab on my cheekbone.There was also a warm hand on my face.I instinctively grasped it with my left hand as I blinked and tried to focus.Not one meter away, lying like me on a thin pallet on the floor, was Dllenahkh.We had been given tunics of roughly woven linen and light blankets of some material I could not identify.Dllenahkhs eyes were shut, his face perfectly blank, but it was his hand that rested on my face.As I began to draw away, there was an impression in my mind of a golden eye that winked and faded out.Wait.Dllenahkhs eyes were still closed, but it was his voice that spoke, the voice of someone whose vocal chords have been unused for hours.Stay still.I stopped moving, biddable in my drowsiness.Warm tendrils untangled from my nervous system, withdrawing gently but swiftly like the leaf brush of startled mimosa.I frowned, feeling their absence like the niggling pain of a familiar but forgotten name.Dllenahkh cleared his throat, sat up slowly, and said, Thank you.I tried to speak, choked on a dry throat, and merely nodded.He gazed at me sleepily, then looked around the room.There was a low table against a nearby wall with two covered plates, two cups, and a pot.He slowly rearranged his legs to sit on his heels before the table, poured the cups full, and handed me one.Drink.Your body needs water and energy.I took the cup with slightly shaking hands and drank deeply, reclining on one elbow.It was both bitter and sweet and not really something Id usually drink, but I downed it as if it were the most delicious thing in the world.Dllenahkh drank slowly.His eyes scanned my face and looked me up and down in a cataloging fashion.How do you feel?Are you in pain?I set down my cup, lightly touched the scab on my cheek, felt along my arms and ribs, arched my back, and pointed and flexed my toes.I think everything works.A little sore, which is to be expected from being battered by water and rock.How about you?I am well, he replied.Is it you I should be thanking for the quick heal?I asked.In part.The adepts showed me how to link to you and guide your body in the healing process.The adepts.Interesting.I would investigate that thoroughlyafter increasing my blood sugar level.I drained my cup and scooted to the table to pour out more, but I was soon distracted by the covered dishes.When I took a peek, I found nothing familiar, but the aromas were subtly tempting.I uncovered and offered a plate to Dllenahkh, part courtesy, part bribe.Tell me everything, I said.I couldnt remember much after that first icy plunge, which was probably a mercy, because when Dllenahkh began to describe, albeit in a terse, unemotional way, how we had been sucked down by the swirling currents, I began to shiver.I have no doubt that whatever my injuries had been, I would have fared far worse had he not shielded me from the hardest impacts.As for the adepts, apparently we had washed up at one of the legendary monasteries via some underwater cave or passage or secret way that lurked behind or beneath the falls.I wanted to feel excited about such a beautiful clich coming true, but mainly I felt hungry, worried, and very unsure about the place we had stumbled into.This was not an Indiana Jones classic holovid; it was real life.Dllenahkh had no such qualms.I do not understand how they have managed it, but these savants possess knowledge that goes far beyond the era when the taSadiri would have arrived at Cygnus Beta.Parallel development of theories and practices, perhaps?A kind of NewtonLeibniz effect?He pondered.It is a gross oversimplification to compare the discovery of calculus to the evolution of some of the most sophisticated techniques of mind and meditation the galaxy has seen, but I understand your point.Perhaps both branches of the disciplines exemplify a natural progression in Sadiri thought.How do you know so much about them already?I asked.Dllenahkh looked away from me, not wanting to lie but clearly not wanting to answer.I finally got a clue.Telepathy!And strong enough not to need touch for conversation.That is something.Dllenahkh sipped his tea and made a noise that sounded almost like satisfaction.They have advanced the disciplines to a level even beyond what we attained in the monasteries on Sadira.Will they go to the Sadiri settlement here or even to New Sadira?I asked shrewdly.His eyelids lowered slightly, a dimming of his quiet enthusiasm.They do not wish to reveal themselves.Not even now.Well, that doesnt help anyone.I sighed, feeling very tired.Will they speak to me, or am I too brain dumb to be worth the effort?Dllenahkh smiled at that.I believe they are being mindful of your condition.You were unconscious when we arrived and have only recently awakened.Very kind of them.Well, let them know from me that a light is more useful on a high hill than under a bushel.And after youve thanked them for their hospitality, ask them when we can go home.I spoke as if the mission team was home, and I suppose thats what it had become to me by then.I spent most of the rest of that day in bed.While I was sleeping, Dllenahkh left the room to lodge elsewhere, so I woke alone in darkness.I lay peacefully listening to the sound of rainwateror perhaps it was a heavy night dewdripping from the eaves outside until the sun came up and filled the room with light.Minutes later, someone arriveda small girl woman dressed in a light woolen robe, her hair so closely cut that it was a mere shadow on her scalp.Good morning, I said in Sadiri.She looked confused and shy.Good morning, she answered hesitantly in my local dialect.I will bring water for you to wash and your clothes so you can dress.I realized my backpack must have made the journey when I saw that the clothes she brought were those I had been carrying, not wearing.When I finished my simple cold water ablutions and got dressed, she brought me a number of items in baskets, laid them neatly alongside a wall, and departed.Brilliant!I said first, recognizing the contents of my backpack, undamaged by water.Those Forestry types know how to design proper gear.Blast it, I said next.There was a carefully wrapped bundle of material that, when unfolded, revealed the many many fragments of my handheld.No quick message sending.Speaking of which, where was my comm?Dllenahkh came into my room, no doubt in response to my cry of dismay.Hey, Dllenahkh, I said cheerfully.They have women here!You cant keep this treasure from the other Sadiri.But Im surprised its a mixed community.Dont these kinds of groups separate the sexes so they wont get distracted from philosophizing or something?Dllenahkh folded his hands into his sleeves, an action that brought to my attention the fact that he was now wearing a robe very similar to the local style.As they rarely use shielding among themselves, they are already aware of each others minds, and physical separation would not serve any purpose.Instead, they have an integrated societycelibates, singles, wedded couples, and childrenall in full telepathic communication.What a way to live!I exclaimed.I bet some areas stay shielded, like the couples quarters.Before I could laugh at my own words, I saw Dllenahkhs lips twitch in a way that was all too familiar to me.I see, I said soberly.I have got to stop laughing at things.Theyre turning out to be true too often for comfort.Now, have you asked them how were going to get back?Have you eaten the morning meal as yet?he asked.No, I said, frowning.Did you just avoid my question?I would prefer to discuss it over breakfast, he replied.He knew where to go.As I followed him, I noticed that in spite of the near silence of the place, the few people we encountered directly greeted us verbally, sometimes in Sadiri, sometimes in my own dialect.The men kept their heads clean shaven, and the women allowed themselves only a shadows length, like the girl I had seen earlier.Not all wore robes, but all garments were of solid colors and in simple styles.In contrast to this superficial uniformity, their faces and bodies were strikingly, variably expressive, a constant reminder of the thousands of ongoing conversations that I could not hear.After passing through a kind of communal refectory and gathering a tray of fruits, grains, broth, and tea, we found ourselves on a balcony that looked down a green gully with a small window of blue sky at the end.The trees dripped moisture, though the early morning mist was quickly burning off as the day warmed up.The breeze was cool, the view breathtaking, and the companyenigmatic.He ignored my questioning looks and urged me to eat.Only when nothing but lukewarm tea remained to be consumed did he sit back slightly on his heels and look reflective.I was once closely connected to a monastery on Sadira, what you would term an oblate.Although I worked as a government official and lived in secular society, my free time was devoted to the study of the mind and its potential.I forgot my cooling tea and listened avidly.I had never dared ask any Sadiri about their life before the disaster, and though I knew Dllenahkh better than any of them, all my knowledge of him was newly minted, scarcely over a year old.My time on Cygnus Beta has been spent similarly.I work in the local government of the homesteadings, and I teach the disciplines at various levels.Mainly, because I cannot be everywhere, I train others to teach.It sounds to me, I said very softly, loath to interrupt him, as if you are among the most advanced of the savants on Cygnus Beta.He seemed to ponder momentarily.I would say your assessment is correct, with one exception.I have not sought the highest levels: the development of the skill required to pilot a mindship.May I ask why not?He looked at me as though it were obvious.Unlike the Zhinuvians, who link and delink from their technology with ease, Sadiri pilots are uniquely bonded to their ships.I do not wish to deny myself the profound bond that may be experienced in the connection between human minds.He paused and gazed at the distant patch of sky framed by leaf and vine.For me, finding this place is like finding a treasure.I have asked about leaving.There is no problem with us doing so.They only require that we leave behind all memory of this place so that it may remain hidden.I pursed my lips.I wasnt comfortable with gaps in my memory for obvious reasons, yet I could see that maintaining the security of this community was more important than my own personal issues.Very well.When can we go?He gave me an intent look.But must we go?I was aghast.He was serious.Dllenahkh, I cant stay.Iwe have people depending on us to return.He spoke abruptly, almost an interruption.While I appreciate that Cygnians are capable of forming attachments within a very short time period, I believe that Tonio I cut him off, stung at his obtuseness.I was talking about Rafi.I think even Sadiri understand family responsibility.And dont you think Joral depends on you too?Joral understands that he can rely on the guidance of any elder Sadiri of our community Yes, I said impatiently, but they wont be you.You guys are like family, you know?There are so few of us left that all Sadiri may be considered family, he said stubbornly.Then why cause him pain by letting him think youre dead?I said gently.Dllenahkh said nothing, but I saw a flicker in his gaze that suggested I had scored a hit.After a short silence, he said, Since you insist on returning, you could tell him that I am alive.After they wipe my memories?I said sarcastically.His look was determined and perhaps a touch irritated.You will not forget this.I will see to it.I went back to my room and packed up my things, even the bits of broken handheld.When I came out again, Dllenahkh was there with an elderly monk who looked at my readiness and smiled slightly.Few choose to stay with us.This is to be expected.It is not a life that everyone can understand.I felt more than mere courtesy compelling me to reply, and I did so in my best ceremonial Sadiri.Few are truly free of obligations and responsibilities to others.Otherwise they would stay, if only for a while, because your harmonious society soothes both mind and spirit.He inclined his head in gracious acknowledgment of both the words and the sincerity.And yet I wonder, I went on, emboldened by his gentleness, why your secrecy is so importantimportant enough to tamper with a persons mind.Dllenahkh began to frown, clearly considering this rudeness, but the monk bowed his head in apology, accepting the seriousness of the question.We tried, once, to be open to the world.The effects on the community were distressing.You see, many people believed that we were the Caretakers and began to demand of us more than we could provide.And you are not We are not now, nor have we ever been, the Caretakers, he declared solemnly.I almost sighed in disappointment.I had no strong feelings about the matter, but I had the usual amount of curiosity.Their powers are far beyond us, he continued.So you have met them?I asked quickly.He smiled.I really couldnt say.He led us out of the building and into an orderly garden of green grass, dark rock, and low clusters of pale gold flowers.A central gravel path led to a glass smooth pool that appeared to have no edge but blue horizon.I felt a tiny surge of worry.There is no safer way?Dllenahkh inquired sharply.None that outsiders may see, was the placid response.The monks walk on water and fly through the treetops.So, this is what I think it is, I said in leaden tones.She has only recently recovered.How can you be sure she is strong enough?Dllenahkh turned to me suddenly.Delarua, stay.No, Dllenahkh.Rafi, remember?Joral.Qeturah.Even my sister Maria, who probably wishes me dead.And yes, even Tonio, who Ive known for all of two weeks.Then Im coming with you, he declared.Dont.I shook my head.Dont do this; dont make me feel that I stood between you and your dream.His look of resolve told me he had already made up his mind.If I am permitted, I will return some day, after I have completed my assignment.You were right, Delarua.There are people depending on us to return, and it was a lapse on my part to persuade myself otherwise.I glanced at the monk.He stood looking at us, as unsurprised as if he had known Dllenahkhs mind before Dllenahkh had known it himself.I took in a huge breath of relief.Well, then, what are you waiting for?I said with a grin.Get your stuff.I walked the gardens with the monk while Dllenahkh was away.I know we had a good in depth conversation, because I felt lighthearted at the end of it, and Ive learned to trust my emotions.He must have taken particular care to remove all trace of his presence in my mind, because I cannot remember a single thing that we spoke about.I do remember when Dllenahkh returned, once more outfitted as a member of the mission team.My mind felt a space clearing, as if a single drop of oil had touched and spread, pushing back all other influence.I looked at the monk, knowing but needing to hear him say it.He smiled and gestured at the pool.Walk on water.Fly through the treetops.Farewell.Indiana Jones holovid fans, eat your heart out.We did not walk; we ran.Our feet struck the water firmly, gripped impossibly, and propelled us to the horizon at the pools far edge.We hurtled into an element that should have destroyed us: high vaulted air with a breeze too light for the wingless to hope.And yet we soared.We swooped down the narrow valley, following the line of the river as if it were an arrow to our destination.I was tempted to look back to see if there was a line of robed figures just beyond the edge of the pool, wafting us gently homeward, but I knew that was just a silly cinematic image, possibly a memory from some ancient holovid.So I looked forward in wonder, seeing the kind of birds eye view of the landscape that even a shuttle cant give.Some people, of course, have to prove they cant be awed by anything.Telekinesis is a natural consequence of intensive psionic development, he remarked after a minute or so.Shut up!Youre spoiling it!I screamed.(I may also have shrieked Wheee at some point.I admit nothing. )However smooth our descent as we followed the water down, I began to realize something.I think were going to get wet againaughhhhh!But it was only to our knees, and the current was comparatively tame.As we slogged to the nearest bank, heavy and earth bound once more, I heard the most beautiful sound, the chirp of my own missing comm, miraculously coming from Dllenahkhs pocket.He had the decency to look slightly ashamed as he fished it out of hiding and answered the automated emergency call.When he signed off, I held out my hand accusingly, thinking of my conveniently smashed handheld.He placed the comm on my palm with a small, regretful smile that made me relent.He was right.There was no need to worry about me.You could have stayed, I admitted.I believe I acted appropriately, he replied, both smile and regret erased from his features.It would not be helpful to hold dual loyalties at this stage.I wanted to believe him, so I dropped the subject before I could persuade myself otherwise.After that, the only thing left to do was find a shuttle size clearing, sit, and wait.It was a grand reunion.There was the expected hugging (by some of us at least!)and mutual relief and general elation at being home safe and sound.Only Qeturah looked grim and almost tearful, and it struck me that she must have convinced herself that she had been responsible for sending us to our deaths.I gave her a tiny chastising shake of the head for thinking such folly.It turned out, however, that she had other things on her mind.Theres someone waiting to speak to you on the shuttle comm, she said.I perked up even more.Rafi!Excusing myself hastily, I ran to the shuttle and quickly keyed on the monitor.Grace.Marias eyes looked shadowed, as if she had been crying and might start again without warning.Hey, Maria, I said tentatively.I really had no idea what to say.She smiled weakly.Good to see you alive and well.I gave a small smile that wasnt entirely kind.Thought I was dead?The stricken look that flashed across her face convinced meshe had wished it.I exhaled and looked away, tears stinging my eyes.Look, I Grace, please We stopped talking.You first, I said eventually.Okay, she said, and took a big breath, bracing herself.Iweve got a long road ahead of us, me and Gracie.The influence went on for so long, they cant just put things back the way they should be.Rafis all right, though.Hehes more like you.Grace, you must promise me, if I cant take care of him, if they try to take him from me, youll look out for him?Be his guardian?Ill sign whatever I have to.I just want him to be with family.Of course, Maria, I said, tears now falling freely.Of course.We spoke for a few more minutes.I told her a message would be coming for Rafi very soon.I apologized for not having done more.She told me not to be silly, and she even sounded as if she meant it.I left the monitor with eyes red but face wiped dry.Then I saw Tonio outside and realized I had to brace myself for another encounter.He was perfect.He took me by the hand and led me away to a quiet place under the eaves of the forest.He sat down on a fallen log and pulled me gently into his lap.Unexpectedly, in contrast to his calm face, his emotions sang against mine in a mutual cacophony of mingled joy and sorrow.Perhaps we were both a little giddy, a little susceptible to the melodrama of the moment.Perhaps not.Now stop that, I said, swallowing down my tears.Youre so loud the Sadiri will hear you.He gave me a wide eyed look of innocence.Perhaps youre projecting your feelings onto me.If thats true, then drop the perhaps and tell me so directly, I challenged him.Hmm.I didnt think so, I added as he looked away for a moment with a wistful smile.Weve had too little time, you and I, he said quietly.And now you go that way, he continued, nodding toward the forest, and I return this way.He looked in the direction of the savanna.So it goes.No jokes?I said breathlessly.No lighthearted humor to make it easier?He gave a half smile, touching my cheek softly with the back of his hand.I dont want easy.I want true.Then this, and I kissed him lightly on the lips, is not easy, but it is true.He pressed his forehead to mine, then kissed me, a kiss as brief as mine had been but far more intense.Worth it, he sighed.I know, perhaps it wasnt a grand passion by the usual standards, but can anyone understand what it meant to me?To have had for however short a time the interest and attention of a man who was strong enough to walk away from me and strong enough to let me walk away from himit might be too much to say it healed something in me, but it was a start.Theres a nice little postscript to this adventure.Two weeks later, long after we had left the area, Qeturah informed Dllenahkh and Joral that a remote village in the forest uplands had made an unheard of effort to contact Central Government authorities.It seems they learned about your quest to find taSadiri brides for your homesteaders, and theyre impressed with your courage.Theyve submitted genetic samples as proof of their eligibility and wish to send a delegation of women to the Tlaxce settlement.Thats marvelous!I exclaimed.I wouldnt be surprised if Yes, I was going to say it.I was going to start talking about the place Id been to and the people Id seen and the things I was supposed to keep secret.But instead my voice dwindled and choked off, my mouth closed, and my teeth clenched shut so fast that I bit the tip of my tongue.Lian gave me an odd look, but otherwise no one else remarked on my strange little coughing fit.Dllenahkh, who had noted with concern and sympathy my sudden stop and watering eyes, came to me after the meeting.I may have neglected to mention that the injunction placed on us to say nothing to others on this matter is far too strong for me to remove, he said softly.No kidding, I said, and tried to squint down at my outstretched tongue.But you have guessed correctly.I am grateful that they found a way to acknowledge our need without compromising their way of life.The words were neutral, the tone calm, but his eyes sparkled with triumph.I smiled at him.Ive got something for you.I reached into a pocket.It had been in a batch of knickknacks Id picked up for Gildas kids, but for some reason I hadnt sent it on with the rest.Never did thank you properly for saving my life and healing me and getting me back safe.Sohere.He took the small brown object, bemused.Then his lips twitched.Highly appropriate.I thank you.It is good to have someone with whom I can remember this.He gravely affixed the teak elephant to the collar of his tunic and gave it a pat of satisfaction that reminded me of my own dealings with the real life, full size versions.Zero hour plus one year two months twenty four days Some mornings, inspired by good weather and exceptional scenery, all four of them meditated together.In the initial days after his return from the hidden monastery, the communal sessions became more frequent, perhaps out of relief and gratitude that he had returned.For Dllenahkh, it was more; he could now sense the latent connections that would lead them into that deeper communication shared by the people of the monastery.It took away the bittersweet nostalgia of the old familiar ritual and replaced it with the new excitement of this is what we will become.One day, Commander Nasiha lingered to speak to him after meditation.I have been thinking, she said.Delarua could benefit from some of the techniques of the basic disciplines.Pleased that she had spoken his innermost thoughts, Dllenahkh responded promptly.That is an excellent suggestion.When will you start?She gave a brief nod in begrudging acknowledgment of the compliment and the trick, fixed him her usual direct look, and pressed on.We both know that you are far better qualified to train her.That might be considered a conflict of interest, he remarked.She kept her face expressionless, and that was as bad as an out loud laugh.Oh?How so?Patiently, Dllenahkh explained, I do not wish to be seen as another Ioan.She blinked, shocked.Councillor!I did not mean Neither did I.  He tried to explain without compromising the safety of his bridled tongue.Of course, but the fact remains, she can trust me while we remain colleagues and equals.Becoming her teacher would shift the balance of power, and I would prefer not to lose her friendship.For I have already done too much to alter that balance.He was relieved that he could not speak of what he had done, because for all his good intentions, he felt strangely close to the edge of guilt.Healing Delarua had been unexpectedly exhilarating, partly due, no doubt, to the thrill of learning a new, nearly miraculous skill, but also perhaps akin to the transcendence of bonding with a mindship and feeling the bones, tendons, and nerves of another beingnot as a puppet master but like a dancer fitted to a partner, able to suggest a movement with a light press of silent, invisible communication.I will teach her, Nasiha said with a firmness that was as good as an oath.Thank you, Commander.If I may make a suggestion, be subtle.She may appear fearless, but she is very quick to retreat if she feels pressured.I will be careful, Councillor, she promised.THE FAERIE QUEEN Her hair was a cloud of silver foam growing back from her temples in tiny soft curls, then expanding up and out in fierce glory.Few crowns of the traditional mold could encompass it, but none was necessary when diamonds of all colors, rose and white and gold, sparkled freely throughout her tresses, transforming the cloud to a starry nebula.Her eyebrows were golden and perfectly shaped, each one a gentle, delicate arc.Dark pupils stood out starkly in sea gray irises; long, light brown eyelashes framed all with a sleepy sultriness.Her look was forgiving of the ordinariness of others and understanding of their natural desire to adore her.Slender limbs made her sprawl elegant; the very fineness of her bones drew the eye along her lines and subtle curves.Her skin defied common sense; it combined translucency with an amber tint, revealing an intricate tracery of blood vessels under the paler skin of her inner arm.She would have made an artist weep for shame that neither brush nor tint could do her justice.A catalog of my own flaws began to scroll through my mind.The uneven texture of my hair, whose inability to decide whether to curl or ripple meant that a crew cut was the best out of a bunch of bad options.The mundane brown of that same hair.Flat, broad eyebrows strongly marking my face, eyes that needed the help of kohl to become remarkable.Thick bones and muscles that spoke of sturdiness rather than graceha, the irony!Cedar brown skin that might have been just acceptable if it hadnt been for the faint dusting of freckles across my nose and cheeks.Ah, there.I consoled myself.We had very much the same nose, a happy medium that was neither big nor small, broad nor pointed, just well proportioned and joined harmoniously to the forehead with a gentle dip.I held on to the image of my nose and tried to feel confident as I looked down it at herinsofar as it is possible to look down at someone seated on a throne elevated on a dais.The Tlaxce Visiting Mission of the Central Government of Cygnus Beta thanks Your Majesty for her kind invitation and wishes to avail itself of the opportunity to renew to the Seelie Court the assurances of its highest consideration.The impressive part wasnt the high diplomatic language.It was the fact that I was able to resurrect enough of my Cymraeg to say this without pause or stammer.The Faerie Queen inclined her head graciously.Be welcome, she said.It had been blissfully mundane for almost three weeks, exactly what I needed after the excitement of waterfall jumping.We had flown the shuttle south and made our way across open farmland, visiting settlements with scant humanity and an overabundance of ruminants.I might have glanced once or twice at the gray edge of wooded hills to the west.I might even have wondered a little, but when Qeturah told me that we had obtained clearance to go to Faerie, my immediate reaction had been that it was a Bad Idea with a capital B I, because I was damned if I was going to explain to the Sadiri how a community of their people had ditched their own culture wholesale to actualize an obscure Terran myth.But I was stuck with the job, so I went ahead and tried my best.Reports are sketchy.Faerie has been closed for more than a century, because visitors tended to treat it a bit like a theme park.Smart visitors, I thought cynically to myself.But they say that for centuries the land was populated by two taSadiri clans who were constantly at war with each other.They had endured a particularly bad run of hostilities when a strange Cygnian turned up with an intriguing solution to their problem.Since the main cause of their war was the question of which clans rituals and dialect should take precedence, the compromise was for both clans to learn an entirely new identity.Tarik was utterly disbelieving.This makes no sense.Do you mean to tell me that two taSadiri tribes abandoned millennia of tradition for a society drawn from folktales and fictional writings?Im afraid so, I said, trying not to smirk at his appalled expression.As a belief, it was rather seductive, actually.Long lived, superior, and mentally dominant over the weaker Terrans, the Elves were clearly an indication of some covert pre embargo Sadiri visit to Terra.If youre out of your skull, that is.Who was the Cygnian who told them this?asked Dllenahkh.Some crackpot academic descended from the Druids of Ynys Mn who made it his business to know all ancient and modern manifestations of Celtic culture.They say his forefathers founded New Camelot.I dont know.Frankly, I find it all a bit silly, but theyve heard about us and theyve invited us, and we cant very well say no.Fortunately, I had set their expectations so low that when the shuttle set down on the bald brow of a tree ringed hill, we were relieved to be greeted by ordinary Cygnians dressed in contemporary attire and with only slightly glossy hair, drawn up in a welcoming party around the Queens throne.They did, however, hold firmly to their own language, and until Tarik could get a translation program up and running, that meant yours truly was the main conduit of communication on our end.The Faerie Queen was eloquent but slightly insane, and this made translation difficult.After descending the dais to greet the Commissioner gravely, she turned her attention to the rest of the team as introductions were made.Initially, she nodded perfunctorily at each name, but then she began to walk among us, her slender height both imposing and fragile.Lian earned a lingering look, Nasiha another grave nod, but at Fergus she stopped and considered.With a sideways glance at Qeturah, she murmured, Probably hers, and went to Joral.Taking the poor young man by the chin, she examined him and proclaimed, Young, before moving on to Tarik.Nasiha, who was quicker on the uptake than the rest of us, seized her husbands hand and stared challengingly at the woman, who merely smiled and came to stand before Dllenahkh.Keeping her gaze on him, she beckoned me over.You represent the newly arrived Sadiri on Cygnus Beta?she asked him.I translated, and Dllenahkh nodded.I do, Your Majesty.She was perhaps three centimeters taller than he was, not counting the fifteen centimeters that was hair alone, but he was three times broader and just as self possessed.She suddenly smiled brilliantly, as if deigning to recognize him as an equal.I will speak to you, she declared.You, she addressed me, still without looking at me, will translate.The rest of you are granted the freedom of the Seelie Court until our discussions are completed.I repeated this in Standard for the benefit of the team, looking anxiously at Qeturah.She smiled reassuringly, but her eyes signaled caution as she said, Tell her that in accordance with government practice we would be happy to set up shelter near the shuttle.The Queen was appalled at the idea.Nonsense!she said, looking at Qeturah as if she were both mad and discourteous.It is far too dangerous to stay on the ground at night.We have prepared lodgings for you.Qeturahs gaze followed her pointing hand, looking up walkways into the heights of huge trees where wooden platforms spanned branches and surrounded trunks in a vast tree city.Thank her kindly for us, First Officer Delarua, she said somewhat breathlessly.Our platformor tbren as they called ithad no barrier rails, something that seemed to worry no one but us, but they did offer us rope netting to string over and around our bedding, perhaps as a deterrent to sleepwalking.I was careful with mine that first night, hooking it securely to a branch above and tucking it under the bedding.This made waking up suddenly at midnight even more exciting as I promptly got tangled up in the mesh.What is it?Whats happened?I whispered frantically as I unknotted myself.Ferguss deep murmur was slow and calming.Someones trying to break into the shuttle.Lian and I are going to check it out.I hesitated, then flung off the netting with one final effort and felt my way to the edge.A hand rested warningly on my back, another hand muffled my start at a scream, and a voice whispered in Cymraeg, Stay.It was likely someone wed met during the day, but the night was dark and all faces dim.Probably the only person whod stand out would be the Queen, with her bright hair.What is it?I whispered.Do you know?Unseelie, came the whispered answer.For a moment I was baffled, and then I grimaced.Ah.The bad guys.Yes.They rule the land at night and go underground at dawn.They do not come up to our treetops, and we do not descend to their caves.Thus we preserve some measure of peace.I thought the whole point of becoming Elves was to stop the conflict.The hand on my back shifted as if vibrating with laughter.I will tell you about it tomorrow.It makes a good tale.Who are you?How will I know you in daylight?I am the teller of tales and singer of songs.You will make a good song, I can feel it.Which one is yours?Disjointedness of thought and speech seemed to be an Elvish trait, but I understood when a shadowy hand waved to the rest of the group, who were awake and quietly talking into comms and to one another.Tarik and Nasiha are husband and wife.The restwe belong only to ourselves.Ah.There was a hint of laughter in that response, and I wondered too late how strong these Elves were in telepathy and empathy.I sat up and put some distance between myself and the strange Elf with his overly friendly hand.Here come your guards, said the storyteller singer, and there indeed were Fergus and Lian returning.Perimeter alarms scared them off, said Fergus.Someone tried a light mental tweak on us, but it didnt take.I quickly explained the little I had just learned.Thats not reassuring, said Qeturah, a frown in her voice.Remember the legend of faerie glamour?Lets stay together as much as possible and be on the alert for influence.With the immediate danger over, the Sadiri soon composed themselves to rest with their usual economy of fuss.Qeturah drew Lian aside for a quiet conference.There was little chance of my getting to sleep in a hurry, what with all the adrenaline of the past few minutes, so I shifted a little closer to Fergus.He was putting away some of his gear and politely ignoring me, as usual.Id long ago figured out that for a man like Fergus, a man who shunned unnecessary talk, I was a walking nightmare.Im a bit surprised, I began, adjusting my voice to copy his measured cadence, hoping not to startle or vex him.Some of the taSadiri weve encounteredwell, its one thing not to have the mental disciplines, but they seem almostuncivilized.There was a silence as he paused for a moment in his work.Are you joking?he said at last, sounding wary.I was baffled.No.What did I say?Theyve got all kinds of ways to reform criminals now, but what do you think the Sadiri used to do with their delinquents in the old days?I was struck mute.The concept of a lawbreaking Sadiri had not even crossed my mind.The perpetual stereotype of the judging, superior Sadiri was too strong, even in me.They used to ship them off planet, fast and far.
