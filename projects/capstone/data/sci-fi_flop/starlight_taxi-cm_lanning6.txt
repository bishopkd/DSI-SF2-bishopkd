Chris lose his job?He was so good at it, the driver thought.Ill be right there, the driver said.He looked over at Karmen, who stared back at him quizzingly.Im gonna need a rain check.Chris lost his job and needs a ride home.Normally, Id tell him to shove it, but I need to get to the bottom of this, the driver said.Karmen was about to object, but she remembered how close Chris and the driver were, even if they didnt show it.The guy was more than just a boss for him.I understand.You go, and Ill be here when you get back, she said.Thanks, the driver said.He walked over, kissed Karmen, and left.His head popped back in for a second and said, Oh, Solstice is outside.Shell paw when she wants back in.Can you let her back into the house, please?Karmen flashed him a thumbs up, and he ran out the front door toward Starla.He opened the door and started the cab before he even sat down.Okay, Starla.I need you to get me somewhere quick.I apologize in advance if Im rough on you, the driver said, shooting up into the air and heading at once for the Starlight Taxi hub on the East side of Lefont.Weaving through the traffic of downtown, the driver came to a familiar parking garage.The bottom floor was the office for the Lefont Starlight Taxi hub, one of four hubs on the planet.The driver parked Starla out front and walked up to the front wooden door.The concrete building was old...made from a time when taxi cabs rode around on wheels and only things with propellers flew.The door flew open, and the driver walked into a reception area where a middle age black woman with braids sat behind a desk directing some taxi cab driver to his next destination.He back there, Pattie?She nodded and went back to her job working a digital switchboard directing dozens of cab drivers through the galaxy.Walking down a small hallway, the driver passed the employee lounge on his right and kept going.He came to a wooden door with a metal plate on the outside that said: Hub Director.Going inside, the driver saw a depressing sight.Chris desk was nearly empty.He usually had a few pictures of his wife on it, but all those frames were in a box he was now packing with a few pens.Hey boss.The larger man wearing a blue button down shirt and jeans looked over at the driver and said, Glad to see youre not so pale anymore.You look much healthier now that you got that nasty parasite out of your system.Yeah...which is more than I can say for you at the moment, the driver said.Hey, youre looking at a formerly successful man in his mid 50s.It aint pretty when you lose your job, which may happen to you since Im gone and cant save your ass anymore, Chris said.Hey man...what happened?Forced early retirement happened.Im 55, and if I worked for Starlight Taxi for another five years, Id be eligible for a full retirement package.If they force me to retire early, they just cut me a one time check, and they arent out all that money, Chris said.He pulled out a brown glass bottle of Jim Beam, apparently the last thing left in his desk.He had a small glass in his other hand.Isnt it a little early for a glass of bourbon?Its a little early for retirement.Shit happens, Chris said, pouring himself a drink.This is destroying him on the inside if hes resorting to bourbon before closing time, the driver thought.Isnt there something you can do?Nope.Its called forced for a reason.If I fight it, I dont even get my one time retirement check.Maybe you can get a job somewhere else and then retire?Thats not how it works.You work for a company for decades, investing time, building up for a big retirement package.You cant just jump ship, work for five years, and then retire.It doesnt go that way, Chris said, taking a drink.That old man manages 60 drivers here.He works us hard, but he gives back what he gets out of us.In the past, hed fought for raises, against layoffs, and even for more vacation time.The guy had been like a dad to some drivers...namely me.Sure, not everyone liked him, but he didnt deserve this, the driver thought.Damn office politics, the driver growled.Give me a few more minutes, and Ill be ready for you to take me home.Sorry my car broke down.Its just the cherry on top of a sundae of greatness that is this day, Chris said, finishing his drink.Rain check.I have to go.Before closing time, Ill get your job back.I promise, the driver said, leaving.Dont.Youll just get yourself fired, Chris said.Go easy on that bottle, Chris, the driver said, raising his hand and waving without turning around.On his way out, he cut through the employee lounge and entered the locker room.He was going to need an ace in the hole if he couldnt get Chris job back.Walking over to locker 176, he opened it.Rummaging through it, he saw what he needed.He shuddered, thinking of having to play that card, but thats why it was called a last resort.The driver walked outside and got into Starla.He was heading to the executive office of Starlight Taxi and going straight to the top.Going through middle management would be worthless.Hed stroll in and make it happen, no matter what.After everything Chris had done for him, hed not let him down now.Damn old man.I had plans with Karmen today, the driver muttered.Starla hummed as he sped toward San Francisco, where the executive offices were for Starlight Taxi.The space taxi business wasnt growing like it used to.It was inevitable that as the cost of technology fell for electron transporters, which allowed for instantaneous travel between points, the taxi business would continue to dive.Right now the business was safe because electron transporters were expensive and only for a certain class of people.That would change in the coming decades.Using taxis to get from planet to planet would go the way of on site recording for movies.With the advancement of technology, certain things faded away.Thats the way the world worked.Its one of the reasons why no vehicles had wheels anymore.Not long after he left Lefont, the driver had maneuvered Starla through the lower atmosphere and was now coming down in San Francisco.Most of the city was hills and tight little roads winding between tall buildings that housed some of the most diverse industries on the planet.Over Starlas radio came an ad with the voice of David Lester, the CEO of Starlight Taxi.Traveling between planets is expensive, but it doesnt have to be.For an affordable ride, call Starlight Taxi, David said.Ugh...I hate our slogan, the driver muttered, muting his radio.He scratched his head and put his pub hat back on.He didnt know what hed say to David, but he was not leaving without results.Passing a small farmers market, he drove a few more blocks and came to the building that housed the executive offices for Starlight Taxi.It was a concrete tower that went up about 20 stories.A red neon sign with the name of the company hung near the top of the building.Parking in front of the building, the driver tapped his wrist against the silver parking meter.One thing that did not change through the years was parking meters.They looked the same as they always did.The insides now were networked and contained the necessary components to accept wireless payments, but outside, they the same as when people used to put coins in.Going inside the lobby, the drivers shoes met shiny tile floor.He walked over to the elevator and got inside.A receptionist dressed neatly in a black skirt came running over, but he had already pushed the close door button.The driver took the elevator to the top floor and stepped out in a hurry.There were only a few offices on the top floor, including Davids.Hed never been in this part of the building before, but he guessed Davids office was the biggest.Men and a couple women in suits looked at the out of place cab driver as he passed their glass offices on the left and right.At the end of a small hallway, he opened a thick wooden door and strolled into the lobby just before Davids office without stopped.The receptionist, a man wearing a tight orange dress, eyed him and asked, Can I help you?Whoa...that is definitely a dude, the driver thought.Im here to see David, the driver said, walking toward his door.The receptionist moved to block the driver, but he was too slow.Although, he did move faster in his matching orange heels than the driver thought possible.Opening a glass door into Davids office, the driver walked in with the receptionist not far behind.Sir!You cant go in here!David, startled, looked up from his desk.It was about twenty feet away from the driver.He had been doing some sort of paperwork when the two of them stumbled in.Im so sorry, Mr.Lester.I couldnt stop him in time.Ill call security, the receptionist said.I drive for you, Mr.Lester, and Id like to have a word.Im not here to get in trouble or show off a boiling rage.I just needed to talk to you quick because its an emergency.The receptionist stopped upon hearing the driver worked for Mr.Lester.Youre a cab driver?From Lefont, the driver said.Its okay, Tanya.Ill handle him.You can leave us, David said.He got up and walked over to us.He had short red hair, black rimmed glasses, and was wearing a purple suit with a black tie.Tanya?Really?That doesnt quite seem butch enough for that receptionist, the driver thought, raising an eyebrow.The guy wore more makeup than Karmen.Yes sir, Tanya said, leaving and closing the door behind him.Quite a receptionist you have there, the driver said.And youre quite a candidate to be a cab driver.I dont deal much with drivers, but I guess what I heard is true, David said.Whats that?Theyll hire just about any bum off the street to drive one of my cabs, David said, clearly unimpressed with the drivers appearance.Look, I didnt come here to discuss dress policy with you, the driver said.David walked back over behind his desk and sighed.Of course not.You came to ask for a raise or something, Im sure.You probably thought that as the CEO, Id be impressed you had the stones to walk in here and ask me face to face, so, Id just give you whatever you wanted, David said, sitting down and going back to his paperwork.Im not here for money, the driver said, standing in front of Davids desk.There was nowhere for him to sit.Oh?Then what are you here for mr..., David trailed off, waiting for the driver to give his name.Im not here to talk about me.Im here to talk about your Lefont hub director Chris Thompson, the driver said.You want him fired for treating you unfairly?The opposite.He was forced into early retirement today.I want you to give him his job back, the driver said.David looked up, a little more interested.Im actually familiar with Loper.Hes been a good and long running director out there, David said.Then why did you force him into early retirement?Im the CEO.Do you really think that I deal with each employees retirement account?I have nothing to do with people being fired.But you can give him his job back, the driver said, putting his hands on the edge of Davids desk.Youre right.I could, with one easy phone call.Will you?No.Why not?You just said hes been a good employee.David leaned back in his chair, clearly not threatened by having the driver so close to him.He pulled out a notepad and started writing in it.Do you know how much a retirement package costs?No.You put in at least 30 years here, and Starlight Taxi gives you a pretty great pension.Unfortunately for me and the investors, those packages get costly, and we have plenty of aging drivers that have been with us for a while.With the financial forecast looking grim for taxi companies in the coming years, do you really think we can afford all those retirement packages?The budget has to be trimmed somewhere, David said.David turned the notepad around and showed some mathematics to the driver, but he was clearly unimpressed.Look, just make an exception for him.Hes only one manager.Surely one employee wont drain your entire budget, the driver said.Youd be okay with us forcing everyone else that gets close into early retirement?You seem to like Chris a lot, but could you live with knowing just how many people were going to be forced out of their benefits that only he gets to keep?The driver was silent for a moment and looked outside, seeing a ship fly by the skyscraper.Look, sometimes we make hard choices.I dont like our forecast, but we gotta do what we can to prepare for the slow decline of business.That means cutting retirement benefits.Chris just happens to be a casualty of that decision.Scowling, the driver growled, Why dont you just take a paycut?David stood up, matching the drivers anger.Because Im the fucking owner of this business.Thats why, he said.Get out of your rich world for two seconds and realize that poor people like us have to exist, too.We need a paycheck to pay bills and put food on the table.Hey, you think that you can run the company better?You want a desk up here on floor 19?Join us.See how long you hold on to your moral compass.I make tough decisions every day.If you think you can run this business without making sacrifices, Ill get you a desk right next to mine.Hell, you can have my desk.Im not talking about running this company!Im just after one mans job.Cut all the retirement packages you want.Just give him his, the driver said, slamming a fist into the desk.You think hes the only hard worker deserving of a retirement package?Why does he get special treatment?Because I strolled in here and asked.Thats why.A little old cab driver walked right up into the CEOs large office and asked, the driver said.Well thats real cute, but it isnt how it works, David said.The two were at an impasse, and David held all the advantages.The driver was getting desperate, and the heartless bastard before him wasnt giving up an inch of ground.Tell you what, if I had one less cab driver in Lefont to pay, thatd come close to evening out the budget, and Id let Chris have his job back and retirement package in a few years.Do you want to sacrifice your job?The driver knew that wasnt an option.He lived paycheck to paycheck, and any disruption would put him behind on bills, likely getting him thrown out of his house.Hed do anything for Chris, but he had to be smart about what sacrifices he made.Thats what I thought.Get out of my office, David said, sitting down and getting back to his papers.The driver straightened up and turned slowly.Then, thinking, he stopped.What if another driver lost her job?What are you talking about?You said Chris could have his job back if you had one less cab driver to pay in Lefont?What if one of the drivers suddenly stopped getting paid?David started to smile.He was seeing a new side of the driver, and the drivers heart hated what was coming next.The driver was never a real righteous or religious man, but he knew when he was making an immoral decision.His stomach started to churn knowing what ace in the hole he was getting ready to play.Go on, David said, giving the driver his full attention.Jamie Foster...her work locker has narcotics in it.Its locker number 176.Thats a fireable offense, the driver said, looking away from Davids gaze.He swallowed, knowing Jamie was a single mom who worked even harder than he did.The driver clenched his fists.Youd be willing to let this woman get fired for Chris to keep his job?Sometimes you make tough decisions, the driver muttered, still looking outside.Clouds were gathering, and a few drops of rain hit the glass.See?You thought you had a moral high ground trying to save a mans job, but in the end, youre willing to take away someone elses job to give him his, David said.Just...make the call, the driver said, quietly.David tapped his earpiece and said, Get me the switchboard worker for Lefont, Tanya.The driver clenched his fists harder.His whole body burned.He knew this was twisted...but this was the only way.He felt like he was going to puke, but he stood as still as a statue.Hi, this is David Lester.Who am I speaking with?Pattie?Hi Pattie, how are you doing today?The phone conversation was pleasant, but it was about to go south fast.Sure, well we have rainy weather now.Id trade you for that Lefont sunshine, David said, laughing.He got down to business after shooting the breeze with Pattie.Pattie, I need a favor.Go check locker number 176 for me and let me know if you find anything out of the ordinary, David said.He looked over at the driver, winking.The line was silent for a minute or two, and Pattie came back with news of the contraband.Thats too bad.Pattie, please contact the authorities and inform Ms.Foster that she is to return to the office immediately.When she arrives, inform her she has been terminated for violating corporate drug policy, David said.He gave her a few other instructions and then hung up.Im sorry, Jamie.Youre a good girl.A lot of drivers knew you took a pill or two to take the edge off.Until now, I was willing to mind my own business, but I needed this...Chris needed this, the driver thought.After that call, David contacted the Human Resources department and reversed Chris early retirement order.They sounded confused as to why the CEO cared, but in the end, he was the boss.They had to do what he told them.Well, there ya go.Dirty move you pulled having a co worker fired, but like you said, we make hard decisions sometimes, David said.The driver turned and left sighing.
