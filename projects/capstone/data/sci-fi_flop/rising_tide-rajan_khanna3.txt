Above her, a mostly still intact skylight sends light down to us.Most of the other glass has been boarded up, especially at the lower levels, but she left the skylight intact.Its something of a wonderglass doesnt usually survive long these days.On the levels above us, on little balconies, stand some of Tesss guards.She may be too valuable to touch, but that doesnt mean shes stupid.Right now they probably have guns trained on us.Precision weapons.If they want us dead, were dead.But were old friends, I keep telling myself.I like libraries, though.Goes hand in hand with liking books.A lot of the places Ive come across have been wrecks.Books burnt or waterlogged.Yet there are always treasures to be found, even in places like that.They can be sad places, though.Take the Seattle Public Library, for example, up north.I found a picture of it once in an old magazine.It looked like something out of a dream.But, these days ...Like I said, glass doesnt usually survive these days.Standing next to Tess is a young man with dark skin and a mess of short, spiky dreadlocks on his head.His face is uncovered, and he appears unarmed.Tess claps her wrinkled hands together.Well, well, well, she says.If it isnt Benjamin G.  Gold.I smile at her.Glad to see you remember me, I say, wishing I had never let slip my middle name.Not even Miranda knows that.She smiles, and it crinkles her cheeks into a mess of fault lines.I remember everything.Some things dont change, I say.Yet I think you have.She crooks a finger at me.Come closer.I do.The glasses are thick lenses inside thicker plastic frames.Glasses always impress me, as rare as they are, but on Tess they dont surprise me.She looks me up and down.Well, youre in trouble, but thats a given or else you wouldnt be here.She squints.Youve been through something harrowing recently.And ...theres a woman.Now how the hell would you know that?I ask.She smiles again.That ones easy.You have a long, wavy hair stuck to your beard, as if you had embraced someone recently.That could have been a mans hair, I say.She holds up a liver spotted finger.Sometimes you just have to play the odds.Who is she?She is none of your concern, I say.Im here for information.She gives me a disgusted look.Of course you are.Thats why people come to me.I dont just sell knowledge, I trade it.You know that.So ...whats her name?Miranda, I say.Ah, she says.Back in the Clean, there was a singer named Carmen Miranda.She used to wear fruit on her head.Now why in the hell would you know that?A commission.For a rather ...wealthy client.Fascinating, I say.But Im not paying for that.She laughs and it sounds like a wet cough.What does she do?Is she a pilot?No, wait, shes not.What does she do, my boy?I grit my teeth.This is all part of the dance, I know, but Im eager to get on with this thing.Shes a scientist.Lord Tesss eyebrows lift.She smiles.That is a treat, young man.What particular flavor of Biology.Virology.Shes studying the Bug.She gets a contemplative look on her face.Some things do change, she says.Well see, I say.What is the nature of your relationship?What?What is she to you?She used to be my employer.She holds up her finger again.Used to be.What is she now?Its a good question.One Im not sure of the answer to.I think back to the kiss we shared before we jumped out of the Cherub.A friend, I say.A comrade in arms.She frowns.I thought you said she was a scientist.She is.But were in the same fight.Against?The end, I say.Her smile returns.I dont think youre telling me everything, Benjamin.I think theres more there, more stones to turn over, and some valuable finds beneath.Im telling it straight I say.You do know that theres this little light that comes into your eyes when youre talking about her, dont you?Its clear shes special.If thats true, keep her close.The Sick doesnt like special people.It tries to stamp them out.Theres an underlying sadness to her words, and I suddenly realize that she once had someone special.And lost them.Id love to hear the particulars of her life, but the truth is that I couldnt afford it.So what is it that you want?she asks.And here we are, where I need to be, and yet I cant stop thinking about the Valhallans that just left here.Youre keeping interesting company these days, I say.What?The two that left before us.She snorts.You know I dont take sides.If you can trade for what you need, I give it to you.Just like that.She nods.This is a business.She smiles.Now Im telling it straight.I sigh.It makes me uneasy, but this is what I came for.I need help.Fast.Theres a ship.A military ship, and its sinking.The pumps that keep the water out, at least some of them, have stopped working.I need replacements.And quick.Before the boat sinks.Uh huh, she says, nodding.She shifts in her chair, and I catch a quick grimace of pain.I just have one question.Go on.Her face loses all trace of humor.Why do you think I would help our old friend Malik?I stare at her.How did you Tattoos.His people tend to get them.Your escort has one on his wrist.Orkney.I remember seeing that mark on his wrist when he rolled up his sleeves.A flame, I think.Or maybe a star?I turn to look at him.Hes not paying attention.His eyes are on the shooters above us.Shit.Hold on, now, I say.Let me explain...Do you know what he did?He came looking, after what happened back in Arizona.I thought he was dead.But he showed up here one dayone of the drawbacks of people knowing where to reach meand he was Mad, I say.Mad would be an understatement.He came in here full of threat and swagger.And when one of my people tried to get in his way...I can see her hand trembling at her side.Hes lucky he made it out alive.Im sorry, I say.Whats almost more surprising is why hes working with you after what you did.You know how it is, I say.He needs something, I know how to get it for him.And what do you get in return?I pause.I get to keep on keeping on.Youre going to have to tell me the whole story.I loosen my scarf just a bit.Its a long story.Uh huh, she says.I have time.I turn and look back at Orkney and Whistler.Orkneys scratching his stubbly head.Whistler is staring at me.Perhaps you two could leave?Lord Tess says, directing it toward them.No way, Whistler says.He doesnt leave our sight.Tess gives me a sad look as if to say, I tried.I tell her.First everything from the destruction of the Cherub onward, and then she starts asking me about how that happened, and I go farther back, telling her about how I hooked up with Miranda and her team, about how Gastown raided the boffin base, about how I lost the Cherub, ended up on Tamoanchan, how I got the Cherub back but how I had to stop the raiders on their way to the island.Im not telling you the name of the settlement or where it is.I say.I know all about, she leans in and whispers, the T word.What?How?Knowledge broker, remember?I narrow my eyes.Would you sell that information?She stares at me.This is my business, she says, her voice hard.And I dont need to explain or elaborate about how I run it to you or to anyone.I provide a service and I have for a long time.Its a service valuable enough to keep me protected.I just stare back at her.Shes not going to tell me and I still need information from her.After a long pause, she continues.There is an art to this.I know, for example, that the location of ...that place ...is a valuable commodity.I also know that were I to sell this location to some in this world, they would attempt to raid the island or even destroy the settlement there.As such, the value of that knowledge would decrease as would the number of customers and sources that I currently have available to me.So that is something I have to weigh heavily.I get it, I say.And I do, of course.But Im not under any illusions.I trust that Tess will keep the information secret ...only until a better offer comes along.Shes not a saint.I need to keep reminding myself of that.So youre looking for the location of replacement pumps, she says, finally.I take a breath.Yes.Its to help Mal, yes, but theres more than that.He has Miranda.Shes aboard the ship.If I dont get back in time to fix it, well...She shakes her head.Youre still asking me to help Malik.I lower my voice.This arrangement is temporary.Hopefully so is my time there.Im basically a prisoner.Believe me, I am going to do everything I can to find a way to ...part ways.So?So ...like you said, Mal and I arent friends, either.At some point hes going to get whats coming to him.And you want me to keep you alive long enough so that you can do it.Thats about right.She chews a thin lip.Pumps, huh?I nod.And I came to the best knowledge broker in the world to help me.She shakes her head.Thats laying it on a bit thick, dont you think?Can you help me?I ask.She holds up her finger as if to stop me.Do you have the details on the ship?I nod and fish out a crumpled piece of paper from my pocket, the specs that Mal gave me.She looks the paper over.This is beautiful penmanship, Benjamin.Thank you, I say.Can you help?I think I might.I just need to consider for a moment.Wait here.She gets up from her seat, shuffles off into a back room, through a large, thick curtain.Shes using a cane these days, I see.I wonder how many years she has left in her.And what happens to all that knowledge when she goes?I turn and smile at Whistler.Isnt this fun?I ask.Whistler scowls back at me.Orkney smiles at me.Hes missing several teeth.A right laugh, he says.I look at the young man.Whats your name?I ask.Rufus, he says.Hi, Rufus, I say.Im Ben.I know, he says.I shrug.Whats your job here?I assist Lord Tess in her research.I nod.Its a good idea, getting others to help her.To be her eyes and fingers.I suppose that makes him next in line for the throne.Hes learning the ropes.Smart move.But then Tess only seems to make smart moves.Except for that one time back at the police storage unit.How long is this going to take?Whistler asks.It takes as long as it takes, Rufus says.It sounds rote, like hes said it or heard it plenty of times.Some of Tesss commissions must take days.Weeks, even.But hopefully not this one.Youre welcome to wait back on the Raven, I say.Whistler scowls at me.Is she doing okay?I ask Rufus, gesturing in the direction of where Tess disappeared.Yes, he says.Shes a tough old bird.I think I hear a note of disappointment in his voice.Tess shuffles back out a few moments later.I believe I can help you.Relief drops my shoulders and shakes some of the tension away.Thats good news.I turn to Whistler and Orkney.Hear that?Good news.Theres a naval base, Tess says.They should have the replacement parts that you need.Where is it?She holds out a paper.On it are some coordinates.Washington, she says.The locations there.Its not the best of news.I was hoping for closer.So we just have to do some foraging?I ask.Not exactly, she says.The base is ...inhabited.Oh.They should be willing to barter with you.My information tells me theyre reasonable.But...Yes?Theyre a little strange.Eccentric.They may need a little convincing.I shrug.Im used to the boffins.Eccentric describes them just fine.And Ive been doing a lot of hustling lately.Their leaders name is Danning.Captain Danning.Its written down.Thanks, I say.I need you to do something for me, though, she says.Your story, as interesting as it was, doesnt pay for this.I nod.What do you need?Whatever information you can give me about the facility.The layout.The names of the people there.Defenses.So on.Why?I ask.Are you thinking of attacking it?Its information, Benjamin, she says as if speaking to an idiot.Its kinda my job.Okay, I say.Ill do what I can.And then were even?She narrows her eyes.If the information is good, then yes.Okay, I say.I press my palms together.Thank you.For putting the past aside for now.I turn to Whistler and Orkney and wave the paper at them.We have our location.Good luck, Benjamin, Tess says.Im about to walk away, then I think of something.One last thing, I say.Any news out of Gastown?Tess tilts her head.Interesting question.Why so interested?I shrug.No particular reason.Had some friends headed out that way recently.Just was wondering if it had gotten crazier.She nods, seemingly satisfied with that answer.Seems like they had a bit of trouble lately.On the city?I ask.On the city and down at their helium plant.I heard they sent a big group of their people and ships down to investigate and protect the plant, and while they did, something else went on in the city.Theyve severely restricted access to the city while they deal with it.Ships cant even get in.I try not to smile.Knowing that we threw a wrench into the works there makes me happy.But I still worry about Tamoanchan and retaliation.Thank you, I say.Dont worry, she says.Youll pay for it.Eventually.And thats the problem, I think.Eventually, the cost will always catch up to you.And in the end it always ends up seeming greater.SIX The good thing about the location of the naval base is that its pretty much a straight line north from Lord Tess.Still, judging on the Ravens speed and the distance, its going to take us a good ten hours or so.Ten hours of being with the happy fun brigade.I feel somehow like Im back in the ocean, bracing for waves.Just when ones passed, another is on the way.My job is to keep my head above the water.If I sink, Miranda sinks.Literally.But what Tess said to me is making me nervous.Theyre a little strange.Eccentric.They may need a little convincing.If Whistler holds true to form, Ill have escorts down there, which means my hands will be tied.On the other hand, Im somewhat glad for the backup.This is one of those cases where the enemy you know is better than the enemy you dont.Im almost feeling okay with the situation when I feel the Raven start to slow and then shudder to a stop as the anchor is dropped.What the hell is going on?I ask.Storm, Chang says.Gotta wait it out.I run to the gondola window, look out at the dark clouds ahead of us.Can we go around?No, Whistler says.We wait.The clouds are dark and thick, and Im sure the wind is picking up out there.Its the safe thing to dothe storm could easily blow us off course.As I look, lightning stabs through one of the clouds.Tick tock.Tick tock.If this were the Cherub, I might chance it.Her engines were strong and she was sleek, and if I could skirt the edge just right ...But the Raven isnt the Cherub.Shes got those two guns and shes clunkier.And I dont know how good Chang is at flying her.So ...we wait until the storm clears.Hours pass.I spend most of the time pacing the Phoenixs gondola until finally sitting against one wall, knees up, trying not to think about Miranda.Then, after what feels like an eternity, Whistler gives the order to raise the anchor and we begin to pick up speed.The timing means that were going to arrive at the base in the early morning.Which means at least well have daylight.Every moment that passes, the Phoenix sinks a little more and Miranda moves closer to a watery grave.I start running calculations in my headhow long it will take to get there, how long it will take to get back.The unknown is how long it will take to get the pumps.Best case scenario, we make a quick deal and get on our way in just a few hours.The Raven is loaded with barter to help broker the deal.And I have to admit that Mal was smart.Theres food, equipment, metals, weapons.Enough to get some kind of deal together.I hope.Because this is going to be the hardest part.Because these people are strangers, and I dont know what they want or how theyre going to react.As difficult as Mal is, I know him, and I know, now, what he wants.Were headed into uncharted territory.I dont want to let Miranda down.We cant fly directly over the base because of the risk of anti aircraft guns.Its a base, after all.Theres no way of telling if the artillery works except to risk being hit by it, and that doesnt really appeal to any of us.Instead, Chang drops us off well outside the range of the guns and we move in.We is Whistler, Chase, and me.Orkney stays on board the Raven with Chang as backup.Someone needs to man the airships guns if it comes to that.So we plod it to the bases edge, not too quickly but not slow either.Right now were on the ground and in the open, and that makes us easy prey for Ferals.Im armed with my fathers revolver.Right now, its strapped to my right thigh, where it belongs, in the holster that Mal got me.I managed to convince Whistler to give the revolver back to me since we were going into a potentially dangerous place and me having it meant one more for the team.Its lower than Im used to, which will change my draw style, but its better than fishing for it in these coat pockets.Whistler seems to be settling in to the idea that Miranda matters to me and so Im not going to try to get free at the first opportunity.Whistler is right about the first thing, not about the second.But I have the gun back, and thats smooth flying.Chase is the Ravens other gunner, a tall, thin woman with short hair and a pale complexion.Her hair is long on the top and shaved on the sides, a reddish shade of blonde.Theres something about her that seems a little unpredictable, but then I dont know her very well.Chase has a sawn off shotgun that she calls Sully in a makeshift sling across her back.I dont know what Whistler has beneath the long coat.But were all armed, and thats something.Odds are, though, that the base is holding more than just a few people.We move in a coordinated fashion, the first time either Whistler or Chase have treated me as one of theirs.But the threat of Ferals has a way of bringing people together.Whistler moves forward, eyes on the base, and Chase and I scan around us, looking for anything moving toward us.I was going to insist on being the one out front, but I trusted myself more on Feral duty.If only I had eyes in the back of my head.We move steadily, persistently, closer and closer to the base.I want to look at it, but that would mean taking my eyes off of my area, and I dont much feel like doing that.I am being forced to trust Whistler, and its a tough piece of meat to swallow.Instead, I scan the overgrown road and the trees and the space between them.I wipe sweat from my forehead.Then I hear Whistler say, Stop.And I do.The area looks clear, so I spare a glance for the base.Four figures in matching uniforms face us with rifles aimed right at us.Theyre behind a gate with bars close enough to keep us from getting in but perfectly fine for letting their bullets right out.I put my hands into the air, and Whistler and Chase do the same.This is your show, Whistler hisses.I move forward ever so slightly.Please, I call out.Were here for your help.We have barter.Can you take us to Captain Danning?Three of the people dont budge at all, keeping their weapons trained on us.The fourth moves to the gate and opens it.A sense of relief fills me.Still, Im ready to reach for my pistol if I need to.When the gate is fully open, the one guard waves us in.I move forward, making sure that Whistler and Chase move in behind me.When we pass the boundaries of the gate, the three guarding us shift positions so that they have better shots on us.Two are women, one is a man.The one on gate duty closes the gate again.When thats done, the gate sealing with a loud clunk, he comes over to me.I need to check you for weapons, he says.Hes tall, lean, dark skinned.Hes surprisingly clean shaven, well groomed.He pats me down and removes my fathers revolver.Then he moves to Chase and Whistler, confiscating Sully and several weapons from Whistlera pistol and a large blade that I think is a machete.He also takes a few things that look like blocks from Chase.All of these he secures in a guard station by the gate.Then he orders two of the soldiers guarding us to escort us to the captain.They take us to a large, outdoor courtyard surrounded by a chain link fence.I try to take in as much as I can of the base, hoping to describe it for Lord Tess later.More guards wait for us in the courtyard, because of course there would be more of those.Is Captain Danning meeting us here?I ask.Then light explodes across my eyes, and it takes a moment to realize that Ive been hit in the head.Next thing, I feel a pressure on the back of my knees, and I go down to a kneeling position, landing hard on my knees.Something is pulled down over my head and tightened around my neck so that I cant see, then another blow hits me in the head and I lose everything for a few moments.When I come back to myself, Im being dragged backward, someone on either of my arms, securely holding me beneath my armpits, and my hands are tied or somehow restrained behind my back.Fuck, I think to myself.I could struggle, but theres two of them, I cant see, and they are armed.Im not.And with the way my head feels, I dont even know if I would have my balance.Fuck.Then, as Im running scenarios through my head, I get tossed down onto the ground, and I hear a heavy door close.Fuck.Fuck.Fuck.I find myself starting to growl, a sound that builds until its a deep scream.From one cell into another.And all the while Miranda is stuck aboard the Phoenix.This is not how its supposed to happen, I think.And then I start to laugh.I cant help myself.Great eruptions of laughter bubble up from deep inside of me.Did you really think the world was going to change for you, Ben?It took us a handful of hours to get to Lord Tess.Then the rest of the day and night to get to the base.One whole day used up, and Miranda only has maybe two more.Tick tock.Tick tock.The water keeps rising.The inside of the bag on my head smells like old sweat, and I try really hard not to think about who wore this last and all the fluids they left on the inside.Its old sweat, I tell myself.Even if infected, the Bug would have died out ages ago.I keep telling myself that.And I keep thinking of Miranda.Of her aboard Mals warship, the water getting ever higher.God, Miranda, theres so much we need to talk about.I keep thinking back to that kiss we shared, just before I dropped us out of my airship.That kiss that seemed to speak of months of feelings we never acknowledged.I mean, it kind of snuck up on me.I always thought Miranda was pretty, in a sort of earthy, rough around the edges way.She was nice to look at, and I thought that was it.But it seems like something else had been building.First admiration and appreciation, then something more.Now ...where are we?What are we to each other?I find that I really want to know.But I need Miranda for that.Think, Ben, think.If nothing else, that should be your mantra from now on.I test my bonds againthey seem to be secure.That makes sense.These people are on a military basethey would have access to good equipment.I scoot back on my butt until I hit the wall, and I get myself to my feet.I may be trapped, but I dont need to be a victim.Using my hands, I slowly move around the circumference of the room, trying to figure out how big it is, see if theres anything else in here with me.Its slow going since my hands are behind me, but I manage to do it.Its not a typical cell, at least not compared to those Ive seen in police facilities.There are no bars.Just hard walls and a door.The door doesnt appear to have any openings in it, though I guess there must be some kind of window, so that they can look in without opening it.Only its too high for me to feel with my hands restrained.Im racking my brain for my next move when they come for me.The door clacks and opens, and as I start to speak, my voice muffled by the bag, two people grab me by my armpits and drag me out of the door.For a brief moment, I think about trying to struggle, trying to get lucky and make a break for it, but I cant see and Im restrained and they can and arent.And Im guessing theyre armed.No, Ben, I tell myself.Bide your time for now.And hope theyre not taking you to an execution.Im getting really sick of biding my time.They march me down what Im guessing is a corridor, then around a bend, then into another room.They force me into a chair, two of them holding me down, and with quick, practiced movements, they release my hands, pull them behind the back of the chair, then latch them up again, I think securing them to the chair.Then I hear footsteps recede.A moment later, the bag is pulled away and I blink in the light.A woman, pale skinned, tall, and wearing a uniform, takes a seat opposite me.Her uniform is different from the others I saw.More formal.Tan in color.There are flecks of color on her collar.Some sign of rank, I guess.My name is Captain Danning, she says.Im in charge here.Well, Captain, I think theres been some kind of misunderstanding here.I came, with my friends, to ask you for help.Lets have your name first, she says.I sigh.Ben.Ben Gold.Very well, Ben, she says.You say you came here for help.What kind of help?Im in need of pumps.The kind that keep a ship from taking on water.I realize I dont know what theyre called.I was told you had some here.Her eyes narrow.And you expected me to just hand over these pumps to you?No, I say, hoping I sound suitably appalled.Im not naive enough to expect charity in the Sick.We came with barter.Captain Danning tilts her head.Came from where, exactly?I take a breath.I dont know this woman, and she just threw me into a cell, so Im not exactly inclined to be forthcoming.On the other hand ...Miranda.From a ship.Seaworthy?About heres where I would normally clamp down and make her work for the information.But do I really need to protect Mal?And even if she had designs on, say, his ship, should I stand in the way?I care only about Miranda.But something about selling Mal out to this woman feels wrong.Yes, I say.Seaworthy.For now.She nods slowly.Ah.I see.So we need replacements.Heard from whom?Sorry?You said you were told that we had pumps.Oh.I nod.Lord Tess.Shes a knowledge broker.She waves a hand impatiently.I know the name.Then you know how she operates.I came to her with my problem, she suggested you.I shrug.So I came to try to barter.Danning stands up and starts to pace in front of me, her hands clasped behind her back.I notice shes wearing gloves.Strangely bulky gloves compared to her outfit.She starts to nod, once, twice, again, again.I get it.She stops and stares at me.Then, taking me by surprise, she slams a fist into my face.My head snaps to the side, and as Im still reacting, another blow takes me from that side, snapping it right back again.Two more follow.My head is screaming with pain and shock and surprise.She grabs my hair with one gloved hand and pulls my head up so that Im facing her.Now tell me why youre really here.Im still reeling from the punches.Things escalated so quickly.I told you, I say, spitting blood.The pumps.Thats it.Oh, Ben, she says, in utter disappointment.Youre going to make this hard, arent you?I try to catch her eye.I feel blood dripping from my nose and down over my already swelling lips.Im being straight with you.All I need are pumps.Lets settle on barter and Ill be out of your way.Well leave.She smiles, but its a predatory thing.All teeth.I dont think so.Her fist flashes again, and this time I black out for a moment.When I come to, Danning is gone, but the pain remains.What have you gotten yourself into, Ben?And more importantly, how are you going to get yourself out?Theres no one else in the room with me.Its empty, save for the two chairs and some ceiling lighting, which Im guessing must be rigged to solar cells.The door to this room also has a window set in it, and Im pretty sure I see a brief flash of movement through it, proof of guards outside.But theyre not looking at me right now.I pull at the bonds around my hands.Theyre tight against the chair back, and the chair looks to be metal.No chance of breaking it, then.I push my weight back, and it rocks.Not bolted to the floor.I push down with my feet and jerk the chair backward.It slams against the floor, me still attached, and I almost cry out as the movement sends a jolt through my whole body, originating somewhere in the vicinity of my spine.The back of my skull slams against the back of the chair, and I need a moment to grit my teeth and bear out the pain.I rock the chair to the side, but it doesnt move.Too much of my weight is pushing it down.But I manage to swing my legs (which arent restrained) to one side, and with some wiggling and shifting, I manage to get the chair on its side.Its even less comfortable as my body wants to slide to the ground, but its attached to the chair, so my one arm is stretched.But now I can test my bonds again.My fall didnt seem to do anything to loosen them, but the angle has shifted.If only I could see better.Metal wont break, but it could be soldered together.That could mean weak spots, especially after decades of use.Im starting to form a plan of dragging it to the wall and doing what I can to slam the chair into it when the door opens and someone comes in.This time its not Danning.A man with dark brown skin introduces himself as Commander Marcus.He also wears a formal uniform, but his looks more cared for than Dannings.Crisp.Clean.Likewise, his appearance.Not a touch of stubble on his face.His hair neatly trimmed.He doesnt react to my position.Lets start fresh, he says.Just you and me.I nod.Captain Danning, well, shes my commanding officer and all, and shes a great soldier and a fine captain, but she has a tendency to be a little hard, he says.Its the pressure of command, you see.Have you ever led?I shake my head.No.It seems Im the only one, too.Mal is a leader of men.Even Lord Tess.Me, Im still the loner.Its a difficult job, Marcus says.Its a lot of responsibility.His words drip sympathy.Appreciation.So you have to forgive her.I grin at him and it opens the wounds on my lip, turning the expression into a grimace.Maybe when I cant feel her fists on my face.He shakes his head.We can put a stop to all of this.Get you some bandages.All I want to know is the truth.Then Ill tell Captain Danning and it will all be okay.Just tell me why youre here.Like I told Captain Danning, I came for the pumps.Thats all.And you need these pumps because you have a ship out there?One thats operational?Yeah.Whats her name?The ship?Yes, he says as if Im an idiot.Uh ...the Phoenix.He frowns.That doesnt sound like any naval ship Ive ever heard of.I dont know.She was probably renamed.Names dont always keep in the Sick.What kind of ship?I dont fucking know, I say.Its big.It floats.It has a big back end.And yet you came from there?I lick some blood from my lips.Im what you would call a recent arrival.He nods, pacing in front of me.His face is thoughtful.Then he stops, looks down at me calmly, then kicks me in the stomach.I gasp with the fresh pain, and he continues to kick.My chest.My shoulders.My stomach.My thighs.He avoids my head.I grunt and yell as each kick adds a new star of pain to the constellation thats lighting up inside of me.Through it all, Im aware that hes being oddly restrained.Precise.As if he doesnt want to damage me too much.Makes senseI cant talk if Im dead.A broken rib or two ...fine.But no more.I repeat the truth again and again.Eventually he gets tired and moves off.I lay there and pant, and moan.And think about what Im going to do to him if I ever get the chance.And through it all, I see Miranda.Tied to the same pipes I was, waist deep in the cold, dirty water.The water rising every hour.Tick tock.Tick tock.At some point, some others come in to put my chair back upright, and the change in position makes my body hurt in all sorts of different ways.Im just glad that Im not coughing up blood.Not yet, anyway.But even breathing hurts as my abused muscles expand and contract.All I have left right now, aside from the pain, is a white, blinding rage.I think about all the things I can do to my tormentors.I think about beating them in retaliation, but thats not really my thing.All that contact.All that blood.And I dont like inflicting pain.I dont relish violence.Except in this moment.The thoughts expand in my mind, each one more violent than the last.Guns, knives, large rocks.I think about bringing the Raven in and using her gunsone for Danning, the other for Marcus.I know, its not very productive, not useful in any way, but it helps me get through the pain and it gives me a sense of hope, strangely.Something to look forward to.Im picturing what I can do with an old spoon when the door opens again.This time they replace the bag, then take me out and drag me to another room.Im lifted and slammed onto a table or something.I feel my feet up higher than my head.My arms and legs are locked into different restraints.Then they pull the bag from my head.Now its coated with my sweat.My blood.Dannings face, upside down, above my own.Ben, Ben.Youre not being cooperative.So we have to get serious.Im going to ask you one more time why you came here.Why you really came.And then things are going to get bad.From upside down I can see that her features are all thin lines.A thin slash of a mouth.A straight, narrow nose.Thin eyebrows that arch in neat angles.Okay, I say.Fine.The truth.I came because, well, I want to join up.I smile at her and feel my scabbed over lips crack.What do you say, will you take me?She shakes her head.No, wait, I say.It was because I heard you had the last Twinkies in all of North America.She walks away.Or was it that I thought you could help me with a fungus problem I have?Do it, is all she says.A damp cloth is placed over my face, and a hand holds it down over my nose and mouth.Then water starts washing over it.I start to drown.I try not to let the water in, but at this angle and with the cloth, its flowing right into my nose and down my airway.I try to shut it out, but I cant.I start trying to move, twisting, pulling on my arms and legs, but theyre held fast and all I can think of is that Im drowning.Im drowning.Water is in my nose, my mouth.Oh, God.Oh, God.I cant breathe.I cant breathe.Oh, God.Im going to die.This is it.Really it.Im dead.Im The water mercifully stops and its sweet relief.The cloth is removed, and I splutter and cough and through it all I taste and smell vomit.In my mouth.In my nose.That was seven seconds, Danning says, returning to view.A taste.Next time, we double that.Unless you tell me the truth.I told you the truth.My voice is a watery croak and my throat aches with the effort.Knives of pain spear through my sinuses.You said you were working for your friend with the boat.But your companions tell a different story.That you werent one of them.That you were a newcomer.That they didnt know your agenda.Fuck.So tell me what youre really doing here and Ill get you back to your cell with a meal and something warm to sleep on.At this part I really just want to tell her to fuck off.Tell her that she can eat Feral shit and choke on it.But is that only killing Miranda?Should I make something up?Try to do what I can to get out of here?What will you do to me, if I tell you what you want to know?I ask.Youre just going to let me go?It depends on what you tell me, Danning says.Ill need to know it all.But we can start with a little relief and go from there.I dont want to keep you and I dont want to kill you.She sounds sincere.So very sincere.Something about that seems reachable.Please, I say.I need to get out of here.Someone I care about ...shes in trouble.And the longer I spend here, the closer she gets to death.I came here to help her.Shes a hostage?Danning asks.Yes.And you were sent here to get something to trade for her life.Yes.What was it?I close my eyes and take a deep breath.I told you.Its the pumps.Its only ever been the pumps.She snarls and shakes her head.I thought we were finally going to be honest with each other.And yet you persist with your lies.What do you take me for, Ben?The moment, if it was ever there, is lost, and my momentary hope sticks in my throat along with the vomit.Its replaced, almost instantly, by rage.Maybe thats why I spit in her face.Its a good one, full of snot and spit and vomit.And it hits her on one cheek.Shes so shocked, she freezes for a moment.Then the panic sets in.No matter where you are in this worldout in some camp on the ground, up in an airship, or safe behind military walls, the fear of the Bug, of infected fluids, gets drilled into you.She puts a gloved hand up to her face, her eyes wide, then turns away.I smile.I cant help it.If Ive scared her at least a little bit, it was all worth it.My excitement is short lived, as one of the men with her slams a rifle butt into my head.Then ...nothing.When I come to a few minutes later, Im back in my cell.Theyve replaced the bag and left me in a crumpled, beaten heap on the ground.My whole body is throbbing with pain, and theres still water in my nose and throat, a kind of raw, abused feeling there, but now is as good a time as any to sleep for a bit.So I do.I wake up to the door being opened again.I hear it slide, then hear it close again.Did they leave something for me?Did they end up feeding me?I get to my knees, trying to figure out how to feel around in front of me without possibly stumbling into it.Then the bag is tugged off of my head.Its dark in my cell, the only light coming in through the rectangular window that I knew was there.A figure, also in uniform (hell, they all seem to be in uniform) stands there.Almost hesitant.You come for another beating?Or is it drowning time again?My voice sounds like someone elses.Neither, comes the voice.A woman.Somethings weird, though.What would you do if you got out of here?she asks.I would go back where I came from, I say.But I need what I came for.And thats a pump?A bilge pump?Yes, I say.Several.She bends down so that were face to face.I cant make out much, but she seems young.Youre not going to get your pump.Never.Captain Danning wont authorize the release of any military equipment.Not to civilians.Is she even using them?All of them?It doesnt matter.She follows the code.I need those pumps.I hang my head.Shake it.How were you going to get them out?she asks.I narrow my eyes.Is this more interrogation?Youre here to be the really nice one?No, she says.I can help you.Thats what Danning said.No, you idiot.I can get your pumps.How?I ask.We have some in storage, in one of the unused machine shops.I should be able to get a few out, but it depends on how you planned to get them away.Why would you do that?I ask.Because I want to get out of here.She pauses.I need to get out of here.You want us to take you with us?Yes, she says.I consider this for a moment.I cant blame her, seeing who her friends are, but I also dont trust her.Why?She hangs her head, shakes it.I just do.Not good enough.She looks at me, and I think I see the hint of tears in her eyes.I grew up here, she says.I was born into this life.Then why would you want to leave?She starts pacing.Because Ive spent my whole life stuck within these fences.They dont let you out?She shrugs.Ive left a few times, on supply runs.But thats it.Sorry, kid, I say.Youre not convincing me.Way I see it, youre safe here, protected, with plenty of weapons to keep you set up that way.You dont understand, she says, shaking her head.Captain Danning ...she thinks that we have this charge, and its all that matters.What kind of charge?That were holding the base.And all it has.Until the government is reformed.The US government?I ask.Yes.Really.Yes.I see.Weve ...weve been here for generations.The children of officers here when everything happened.When the ...disease spread.Weve been taught to uphold the Navy way.The code.To fulfill our duty.Only you dont believe, I say.Its not that, she says.No?I, just ...the way the Captain treated you.And the others.She thinks youre after our secrets.After our...Yes?Never mind.I think about what she said.Try to imagine what it would be like to grow up in this kind of place.To be young again and want, what, freedom?My own life?It makes sense.So you want out, I say.Yes.You help us get the pumps, and we take you with us.Yes.It feels eerily familiar.I remember a man named Atticus back at Gastowns helium plant.He helped Rosie and me find our way around the plant.We originally took him captive, but he was all too willing to help.All he wanted was for us to take him out with us.I told him I would think about itI never told him I would take himand then he died.Helping us.The truth is that I need her help.I dont have many other options, and I know that the next time they come to get me, its back to the table.And the drowning.And I dont know that Ill last the next time.Maybe Ill tell them about Tamoanchan.Suddenly I have sympathy for Diego, who was tortured on Gastown and gave up its location.Okay, I say.You get us all out of here, and Ill take you with us.But you have to get us the pumps.You get that?Consider your life tied to them.I can do it, she says.The pumps at least.Getting you out of here isnt going to be easy.But you have a plan?Yes, she says.Well have to move quickly.Thats fine by me.First I need to get the pumps.How did you come here?I close my eyes.Time to start blindly trusting.Airship, I say.It dropped us off so we could approach on foot.She grabs the back of her head as if thinking.That could work.You cant approach the basewe have guns for thatbut ...if I can load the pumps into a raft, I could get them into the water.Your ship would have to pick them up from there.It could work.And it would prevent us from having to bring the Raven near the base, but ...I consider that this could be a trap.A way to get her back to our ship so that all of us could be captured.It would be a good plan, too.And yet ...shes only one person.If she frees all of us, and gets us back to the Raven, wed outnumber her easily.Unless theres something Im missing.What do you say?
