The outer door opened into the slaver's airlock, where an ugly creature at least seven feet tall was waiting for him.It was humanoid but repulsive and carried a whip, which it instantly put to work driving Jerry before it, tossing a sack of credits back over its shoulder as it left.Jerry moved along quickly enough under this impetus and soon after found himself chained to a bar in the metal wall between two other slaves.They looked at him apathetically as is the slave's wont, but he took a greater interest in them."How do you do," he said to the slave on his right, a creature who was very humanoid, though bright red even to the eyeballs, and who had what might be called a normal left hand  if seven fingers are normal  but instead of a right hand the arm had a bony sword from the elbow down.This sword looked hard and efficient and rather sharp so that when the creature only answered with a guttural snarl and a jab at Jerry with the sword, he adroitly dodged aside and caught the red jaw of the other cleanly with his fist and laid him out for the count."Very neatly done," a deep voice resounded from beside him."One should never waste time talking with the red swordsmen of Vindaloo.They have tiny minds and only know fighting, whereas my people of Bachtria are civilized and intelligent.May I introduce myself  I am called Pipa Pipa, but you may call me Pipa if that pleases you. "The individual who spoke was chained to Jerry's left.A fat, green, dampish sort of alien with a great white belly.His eyes protruded from his head, and his mouth slashed across the entire width of his great head.He must have come from a water world because his knobby fingers were connected by webs."My pleasure," Jerry said."My name is Jerry Courteney. ""Then I may call you Courteney?""Jerry would be better. ""I understand," Pipa croaked."Hist, the overseer comes, we must not be seen talking or it means the lash. "He sighed deeply."Not that it matters.Everything means the lash. "He sighed again as the whip fell across his back, and the overseer went down the line lashing right and left."On your feet, you scum of the universe," he bawled hoarsely with rough glee."We have arrived at your new home.You'll love it here.The DnDrf mines of Haggis!"A sound, something between a moan and a groan, emanated from the filthy ranks, for this was known as the end of the road for slaves, from which none ever returned.With reluctance they rattled their chains as they were unlocked and driven toward the door."This is the end!"Pipa groaned."I shall never see my home pond again. "Jerry wanted to give him some measure of cheer, but he dared not, not yet.The mind shield in his sinus prevented his brain being read like an open book, but he knew that all the others could have their thoughts tapped at any time.He must keep his secret safe!The time would come....Whips cracking like lightning, the slavers drove the hapless slaves down the gangway and into the frigid Artic wastes of Haggis.Of course, they were frigid by Haggisian standards, which meant the temperature was around 100 degrees by Fahrenheit standards, which is bearable, though not very comfortable.As each slave emerged, the slavers stripped him and  or her of all their clothing so they could survive in the dry heat.Jerry's Hush Puppies were cut from his feet with the slash of a blade, and his sundered tie died Levi's followed them.All that remained was his jockstrap, and he was ready to fight to the death to keep this  and not only for the mini mind shields  but because it was bright purple, the slavers thought it was part of his body (which shows you how slavers think) and they pushed him on with the others.Ahead were the mines.It was a scene of utter desolation.All about lay a sulfur desert, cooking and shimmering in the heated air.Above hung the great blue sun of Sirius, frying brains in their brain pans and shooting out hard radiation to batter genes and start the mutations mutating.Ahead lay a mountain range, and set into the nearest mountain was a solid collapsium* door just six feet high.Above this door was engraved in letters carved out of the solid rock "Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here" or something like that.[* Collapsium is an artificial material made of atoms with their binding energy reduced so they sort of collapse in upon themselves and are dense and heavy and that kind of thing. ]Jerry could not be sure because he could not read Haggisian, but it seemed a reasonable guess.The whips cracked even more fiercely as they drove the reluctant slaves toward this grim portal."Now hear this," the master slaver bellowed through a loudhailer from a position on a rock where he could survey the gathered, trembling, fear infested slaves, who were quickly whip cracked into silence."I'm only gonna tell this to you just once, so cock your ears and bend your antenna or whatever.This here is the mine I been telling you about.That door there is the first of seventeen just like it.The drill is that it opens, one of you slobs goes in, then it closes before the next door opens.You go through that etc.etc.until you are in the mine.It is my poisonal suggestion that you step lively because three seconds after a door opens a fifty sixthousand volt current is sent through the compartment you will be standing in.So in you go, crying and weeping, but in you go.Once inside, you will find more slaves working away at mining the DnDrf.The Hagg Loos don't bother about how the stuff is mined, and they don't care neither.Grinding machines inside grind it to a fine powder, and it is pumped out through a one inch pipe.One ton of it a day.As long as that ton comes out every day, food and water are pumped in through other pipes.No workee, no eatee, as the expression goes.So do your best, work for your chow, resign yourself to a last look at the sun for eternity, and off you go into endless darkness. "The whips cracked again as the outer door opened, and the first slave was booted into position.One by one the others followed until it was Jerry's turn, and he took a last despairing look at the burning plain, the slaver ship, the insulated buildings where the Hagg Loos were; then in he went.With an unoiled screeching the portal closed behind him, and darkness descended."I'm doing it for you, Chuck," he said staunchly, then sniffed and wiped his nose with the back of his hand.When the next door opened, he skittered through quickly as he heard the onrushing 56,000 volts zinging through the cables toward him.It was a nightmare voyage with an even more nightmarish ending.As Jerry stepped through the last door, a great, hairy, ugly, brutal monster of a slave caught him in the back of the neck with a club (that looked suspiciously like a human femur), sending him sprawling.But surprised as he had been by the sudden and unprovoked attack, Jerry's reflexes were still superb, and he rolled with the blow so it did not stun him, fell and twisted and caught the brute's shin with a solid kick that knocked him to the ground.Then, before the foul creature could recover, he dived on it and clutched hard with a Japanese headlock that renders the victim unconscious in five seconds and dead in ten.He applied full pressure.The thing tried to speak through its filthy beard.At the end of four seconds it gasped, "Urgh ...Jerry...don't... "and instantly became limply unconscious on the fifth second.Jerry thought about this for a few seconds more, wondering how the creature knew his name.After eight seconds had passed, he looked at it more closely, and at the end of nine seconds he released the pressure so that blood reentered the thing's brain, and it did not die.Its grimy, bloodshot eyes opened tremblingly, and it glared up with bestial hatred."Chuck, that is you, isn't it?"Jerry asked.The thing blinked fuzzily and muttered, "Me name Chuck...how you know name?""Poor lad," Jerry said, helping him to his feet and dusting him off."They have been walking through his brain with spiked boots, and they shall pay for it, and someday, I promise, he will be restored to full mental and physical health.Do you understand, Chuck?""Let's go eat.Chuckee hungry. "Jerry patted the Chuck thing on the shoulder and led him toward the chow trough, where the others were guzzling, concealing his deepest feelings at this terrible fate that had struck his best friend.He felt no desire to compete with the others for the thin gruel that they lapped up by the handfuls.It looked and smelt like mashed mangelwurzels.In fact, it probably was mashed mangel wurzels; these fiends would stop at nothing.So, while Chuck dived into the swill, Jerry looked around at the demoniac scene  and that was a good word for it, for the cave was dimly lit by flickering flames that leaped from niches scraped in the stone walls.These fires were fueled with some sort of dark lumps; he noticed this when one of the slaves dragged over a bucket and dumped some of them on a fire.A loud creaking and groaning filled the air as other slaves worked hard at the great handles of a grinding machine.This was fed with chunks of some black substance wheeled up on carts.The mill reduced it to a fine powder which was dumped into a funnel and vanished down a pipe."DnDrf!"he gasped aloud, the terrible drug that drove aliens mad, then ate away their chitin.Reluctantly he sidled up for a closer look and kicked at a glistening chunk that had dropped from the mill."You know," he mused to himself."If I did not know that this was the hideous drug called DnDrf, I would say it is nothing but a lump of coal. ""It is only a lump of coal, for DnDrf is coal," a grating voice said from behind him."You think you are a smart guy, huh!"Jerry was beginning to catch onto the interpersonal relationships in the mine, so he ducked and dodged before turning so that the club, a human femur with a stone head, whistled by without hitting him."Try that again and you are a dead thing," he said to the thing wielding the club, crouching at the same time in the karate instant death mode.The creature stopped and looked at him bemusedly, and he looked at it.It wasn't much to look at.Humanoid in form and about his height, it was covered with lumpy brown hide that had a crumbly texture.Only its eyes gleaming whitely from its misshapen head."I am called Fevil Dood," it grunted."And I am top slave in this compound.Do you want to challenge me?Means fight to the death. ""Quite the opposite," Jerry simpered in a sucking way.A plan was already beginning to form."I will obey all your commands and am completely at your disposal.Just tell me the drill here and show me where I fit in. ""Unghh," the thing grunted, reluctantly lowering its weapon."Better be telling the truth, or you die like quick.Me and my boys run this place and do no work other than bash skulls in.You and other slaves dig the DnDrf, crush it, and pump it out, a ton a day.You do this every day, and we let you eat and drink and live. ""What do you get out of it?""We eat and drink and live; only we don't work. ""Seems a dull existence.I should think you would be planning ways to crack out of here. ""Forget it.You here to stay.We all thought about it; now we don't think about it any more.So work. ""Sure.But why did those two guys stop working?""Where?"Fevil Dood roared, raising the club and spinning about.Jerry instantly gave him a chop on the neck that dropped him, unconscious, with a thud, to the ground.Working fast, Jerry plucked one of the mind shields from its hiding place and then sat on the alien's rough brown chest.With one hand he held Fevil's mouth shut, and with the other he pinched shut his nostrils.Even though unconscious, Fevil began to feel short of breath and groaned and writhed.When his skin was turning purple under the brown, Jerry relented and opened one nostril.As the torrent of air was sucked into his nose Jerry dropped the mind shield into the slipstream, and it vanished into the recesses of the creature's head.At this moment Fevil arched his back and sent Jerry spinning away.Seizing his club, he roared and attacked."Now just one moment," Jerry explained, dodging the blows."If you will please stop that for a moment, I'll tell you what's going on. "The angry boss slave was not interested in explanations, though, and roared and chased Jerry about the cave, cheered on by the other slaves, who were glad of this bit of entertainment plumped into their monotonous existence.Jerry was getting tired of this, so the next time he ducked a blow he plucked up a lump of coal  and suddenly whirled about.The athlete who had batted .999 consistently and had pitched forty two no hit games in a row could hit the target he aimed at, oh, indeed he could!The coal whistled through the air and clunked off Fevil Dood's forehead and laid him low one more time.Jerry seized up the club and chased the other slaves away, then sat and waited, club raised, for the defeated superslave to recover.Recover he did, within moments, and glared up at the raised club."So go ahead and kill me already.See how you like being boss of these dumbheads. ""Shut up!"Jerry hissed."Listen quietly or I will brain you.I knocked you out so I could insert a mind shield in your nose.I am here to lead an escape from this mine. "Pevil Dood's eyes popped out three inches, on stalks, at this news."You know, you're right," he mused."I am a simple telepath but realize now I am getting no messages.So that means no one can listen in on my brain either?""Dead right.Now if I give you the club back, will you help me organize the slaves for a revolt?""I'm your alien!"he bellowed, leaping to his feet."Let's go!"They went.One by one his gang of bullyboys and overmuscled slobs was called aside and bashed on the head so a mind shield could be inserted.Once consciousness was recovered and the plan explained, the recruit instantly aided the head banging of the others.This went on until all the mind shields had been dispensed to the waiting sinuses, and the gang of eager thugs gathered around."Gather around," Jerry ordered, "and I will explain the escape plan.Our part will be to "  "AHHHHHHHHH!"Fevil Dood said loudly.Jerry glared at him."Will you kindly shut the hell up?"he hinted."AHHHHHHHHH!"was his only answer.He went on, trying to ignore the interruption."As I was saying, our job is to overpower the guards outside. ""But," a great thug covered with tarnished scales asked,  "how do we get out?""That will be done by "  "AHHHHHHHH CHOOOOO!"Fevil Dood exploded, sneezing with great force.With such great force indeed that his mind shield was expelled from his hairy nostril and shot across the cave to vanish in the darkness."Gesundheit," Jerry said, politely."What is this meeting?"Fevil Dood asked in clipped, suspicious tones."What are you all doing together?Why cannot I enter your minds?Aha, I see it all in the dim mind of this stupid creature!You are planning escape!"Thunk the club said as it contacted the side of Fevil Dood's now rather bashed up skull."He lost his mind shield," Jerry explained, "and a Hagg Loos took over his mind.Now that they know we must push on with the plan!""You're not just gnashing your fangs," a slave said, rather well endowed himself with fangs."Take a look at the rest of the mob!"Every slave in the immense cave, other than those in this brave little band, had now ceased work and turned in their direction.Zombielike they raised their hands and clawed their fingers, their eyes blazed with alien fury as, with a shambling, hideous motion they advanced."They've been taken over by the guards," Jerry shouted."Fall back this way, men.I'm sending out the message to start the attack. "He bit down hard in a certain way upon a certain tooth."Ow!"he screeched."I've gone and broken a damn filling.Wrong tooth. "Now, biting down in a certain way upon the right tooth, he actuated an incredibly tiny, yet exceedingly powerful subetheric radio which sent out a prerecorded signal.Out the signal blasted through the seams of coal and the solid stone, out across the searing plain and into space and through the mountain range behind which the waiting Pleasantville Eagle was waiting.He hoped."Fight men, fight, for the signal has gone out and help is on the way. "It was an unequal battle, because for every slave bopped on the head and knocked out, two more sprang forward to take his place.And the slaves were ruthless, just slaves to their possessors' slightest whim, not caring if they were maimed or killed.On and on they came, and the defenders retreated step by step until their backs were to the stone wall and their numbers greatly diminished  Then, when all appeared to be lost, something incredible happened.A glare of light blasted forth, and they all stopped and gaped.Well, it wasn't really much of a glare, in fact, it was kind of dim, but their eyes were so used to the eternal darkness that it looked like a glare to them.For, in a single microscopic instant of time, all the indestructible series of one way doors had vanished and in their place was a smooth walled tunnel leading to the outside.The cheddite projector had whisked away all the portals and part of the surrounding rock so that the way to liberty was open."The way to liberty is open!"Jerry roared."Follow me!"His gang of club wielding rowdies roared in answer and galloped through the other slaves who were now milling about disturbedly, some still under brain control, others released from this vile bondage.Down the tunnel Jerry ran, waving the club, fleet footed and fast  one stumble and he would have been trampled to a pulp  and out onto the plain to engage the emerging guards in battle.Behind them in the cave the other slaves found themselves free of control and also headed for liberty.Although the Hagg Loos fought like the mad devils that they were, they never stood a chance.For not only did they have to face their enraged slaves, but from the plane burst John and a squad of Garnishee, as well as five Hagg Inder warriors, led by Lord Prrsi, who charged out of the cargo hold.The battle was short, sweet, and bloody, and soon nothing but fragments of steaming Hagg Loos flesh littered the landscape and the last defender was dead."Into the plane!"Lord Prrsi ordered."Reinforcements are on the way, and I don't think we are up to facing their entire battle fleet. ""Hold on!"Jerry called out, battling his way against the stream of slaves pouring into the 747."Where's Chuck?After all, we did come here to release him; that was the idea of the whole thing. ""He's not in the plane or in this bunch," John mused."Then he's still in the cave," Jerry called out and ran that way in the instant."Come back!"Lord Prrsi ordered."We cannot wait, for if we do so, we risk the loss of the cheddite projector, as well as all aboard your ship, not to mention the ship itself. ""You just stay there and wait for me," Jerry commanded."I'll only be a moment.Fight if you must, but just hold on a bit"  Then he was pounding into the cave once more and, frankly, getting sort of pooped and out of breath after the recent bout of activity.Inside the cave he could see nothing, since his eyes were now adjusted to the glare outside."Chuck!"he called, and "Chuck!"again, but there was no answer.Stumbling blindly along, he made his way to the food troughs  had he heard a slurping noise?and there, sure enough, was his buddy, head down in the gruel and slurping away."We have to get out of here!"He pulled at Chuck's resisting shoulder."Booger off!"was the growled answer."Chuck eet him food. ""Jerry's arm was sore when he raised it, and the edge of his hand hurt when he administered the karate chop to the muscular neck below him.It was a job to get the dead weight of his friend onto his shoulder, but he did manage, then staggered out of the tunnel once again.A steak and a hot bath was what he needed after this, he thought to himself, and maybe a couple of good belts of bourbon.Then the entrance was ahead, and he staggered and stumbled and stopped.High above he could see the diving forms of Hagg Loos fighters, weapons glistening and ready.But, before him on the battle scarred plain where the Pleasantville Eagle had stood there was nothing.Absolutely nothing.They were alone, trapped on this enemy planet so far from home.What a hideous way to die....13  TRAPPED ON HAGGIS  It was a moment of ghastly paralysis for this intrepid space explorer, who, at this instant, was beginning to regret very much the whole idea of space exploration.What to do?Suicide seemed about the only answer, and he let the unconscious Chuck slip heavily to the ground while he considered possible means of terminating a life that was just about as good as terminated anyway.The moment passed, and he abandoned thoughts of suicide for the moment, mainly because he could not see any easy way of doing it, short of drowning himself in the mashed mangelwurzels which didn't sound attractive at all.Above him the Hagg Loos fighting ships raced and cavorted and occasionally banged off their guns at suspicious objects on the ground below, but other than the cooked lumps of slain Haggisians and an occasional slave corpse or two, the landscape was empty.Or was it?What was that strange sort of rattling, slithering sound that came from behind the heaped up rocks?Reflexively, Jerry withdrew into the tunnel mouth, pulling Chuck after him.The scraping grew louder and louder until, with horrifying abruptness, the great pallid form of a Hagg Loos appeared.Its poison barb twitched, its faceted, evil eyes stared at the tunnel  and then it attacked!Fast as it was, Jerry was just as fast.With Chuck in tow he sprinted into the mine and dived for the grinding machine."Enter at your own peril!"he shouted, raising a handful of the deadly coal dust, coal dust to him, but drugaddicting DnDrf to the Hagg Loos who now clattered into the cave after him."You heard me," Jerry cried, backing away."I mean it.One step more and I let fly and you are an addict for life until your chitin rots away!"But the Hagg Loos warrior ignored him and still came forward.Good as his word, Jerry let fly unerringly with the coal dust, which shmeared itself on the enemy's white chitin.And still it came.Jerry abandoned the coal dust ploy and seized up one of the clubs, not much of a weapon against the yard long nippers of the enemy, but if fight he must, why, then he would die fighting."To me, Chuck, to me!"he called out."I may have to die fighting, and a little help would be appreciated. "But the help was not coming.Chuck had regained consciousness and was back at the mangel wurzel trough, noshing away with bestial slurping sounds.The enemy advanced until its great form hovered over Jerry, and he drew back his club for one last blow when a trapdoor opened in its abdomen and a mop of tentacles popped out."I know those familiar tentacles," Jerry exulted, hurling the club aside."That is you, isn't it, Slug Togath?""None other," came the gloomy answer."Left behind by force despite strong reservations as to wisdom of abandonment, to aid in effecting your escape. ""Damn good idea on someone's part.Am I allowed to ask just what you are doing inside one of the enemy?""Not enemy, giant robot machine constructed after you were sold to the slavers.It seems that the Hagg lnder albino spy on this planet was interrupted during a secret message, and they have not been able to contact him yet.So this robot was built, and I agreed to take it into the enemy city to see about the spy, but under controlled conditions and etc., not just dumped at the North Pole like this. "His tentacles wriggled with self pity as he gave his TS card a good verbal punching."Cheer up, old Medusa head," Jerry chirruped, patting him on the back, inadvertently giving him a black eye at the same time since, of course, he had eyes on his back as well."You've got help on this mission now, one and oneeighth good men to help you.Chuck being the one eighth, about all he is good for since they crunched his brain. "Chuck happily slurped an answer."Look, tell me about it later, will you?"Slug Togath said nervously, peering in all directions, which of course was easy for him to do."Climb into this damn thing so I can seal the hatch before any of them spots us. "And this they did, only getting Chuck away from the mangel wurzels with some difficulty and by promising him an Ormoloo burger if he was a good boy and climbed into the Haggis machine and sat quietly.This was done and the hatch slammed, and Jerry looked around approvingly at the well organized, though cramped, quarters.A control seat in the head with vision screens to operate the machine, with special controls for the poison sting in the tail which also housed a supersonic crumbler beam.Tool and food compartments were on both sides, a compact galley, recruiting posters and VD warnings on the walls, a folding cot, a color TV next to the bar, and a chemical toilet tucked discreetly in the rear behind a curtain."Not bad, not bad at all," Jerry approved as he sizzled up a burger for the salivating Chuck, who was strapped into a chair.It smelled so good he made one himself and was munching away under the disapproving eyes of Slug Togath."I know your Earthling axiom about Nero fiddling while Rome burned," he disapproved, "and we have the equivalent in our axiom about how only a crogis nardles while his friend's mother cakarakas. ""Sounds sort of dirty," Jerry mumbled around a mouthful, "so don't bother to translate.While eating I have been thinking, and I have a plan of escape, but first I've got a couple of questions.Like do you have a mind shield for Chuck, since the enemy might think something was wrong if they caught his brutish thoughts emanating from the neighborhood of this thing's big intestine?""Not to worry.The entire device is mind shielded.They will catch no stray thoughts. ""That's a good beginning.But what about if they should try to contact what they think is their buddy here and get no thoughts in return?""I assure you, all this was taken into consideration when the device was constructed.There is a programmed brainwave transmitter hooked to the antenna.This is the board that controls it By selecting the correct button, it will broadcast thoughts of immense concentration, including the message 'buzz off and don't bug me now,' the random thoughts of deep sleep, and so forth. ""What is this button labeled 'section 8'?""Well, as I am sure you know, all the Hagg Loos are insane to a greater or lesser degree, usually greater, driven that way by the maddening hard radiation of their sun, the great star Spica.Many of the creatures have periods of frothing insanity at which time the others leave them completely alone.That is the frothing insanity button."Then that is all I need to know!"Jerry shouted and did a little victory dance."My plan is now complete.Prepare to escape. "As soon as the plan had been explained to him, the dubious Slug Togath became an enthusiast as well and joined in the preparations.Using the great front claws, they dug into the powdered coal dust and hurled it all over the white body of the machine.Then, with all claws full of more coal dust, they raced for the entrance, and before they emerged, Jerry pressed the section 8 button.Oh, what a hideous sight it was to the Hagg Loos warriors who were emerging from the fighting ships.For, in their institutional madness, they fear nothing in the universe other than the dread DnDrf which would bring on addiction, rotted chitin, you know the drill.So they took one glimpse at what appeared to be one of their number just coated with the deadly substance, stoned out of his mind obviously and radiating nuttiness on every wavelength, and coming in their direction.They split.Those still in their ships blasted off instantly.Those near their ships dived into them, in many cases slamming the doors in their comrades' faces.These, and the others too far from the ships, instantly fled at top speed into the frigid 110 degree Artic wastes.It worked like a charm.Slug Togath labored at the controls, his tentacles a blur of motion as he spun the machine about and headed for the grounded spaceships, their owners fleeing before him.Still mentally broadcasting crazy like crazy, he clambered the machine into the first one with an open port, slamming and sealing the port behind.The control cabin was in the nose, and in a matter of seconds he and Jerry examined and figured out how they worked, and whammo!the ship blasted free from the ground and rose erratically inte the air.Moments later they were alone, arcing up into space in a high parabola."What's next?"Jerry asked pouring himself a large martini cocktail and draining it almost instantly."Food for Chuckee," that pathetic voice entreated, so Jerry went and fried up another batch of Ormolooburgers."They'll try to intercept us and blast us out of space, so we are getting out of space before they can report and locate us.This orbit will bring us down a few miles outside Haggis City, where we will abandon the ship and proceed to the rendezvous with the Hagg Inder spy, or at least to the place where he is supposed to be, to determine the nature of the trouble. "Night arrived suddenly as they caught up with the planet's rotation, and darkness concealed their fall."Controls are set," Slug Togath reported."When this ship lands, we have just four seconds to get out of it before it takes off on a random course that I have programmed into the computer.I am sure that they will disintegrate the ship so that all the DnDrf in it will be destroyed.As long as we are not seen emerging we will be safe. "With these words barely out of his mouth, Slug Togath dived the ship behind a screening row of hills and into a shallow valley.The instant they touched the door sprang open, and the machine, under his deft control, sprang through it  and just in time, for the closing portal actually brushed the poison sting of the immense form.Whooshing and roaring, the ship took off and, no more than a few seconds later, a flight of fighting rockets rushed by overhead, following it.the first light of dawn painting their white forms a bright blue."There is one thing you have to do before we leave here," Jerry said.filling a plastic bucket with water at the sink."Take this and a scrubbing brush and get out there and remove every particle of coal dust so this thing is pristine and clean again. ""Whaddaya mean I have to do?"protested Slug Togath."I'm a prime minister at home and rm not used to that kind of menial labor. ""Agreed, but you also have a hide so tough it bounces off bullets, which is more than I can say for my all too tender flesh.This machine is air conditioned, but the thermometer tells me that it is a cozy two hundred and fifty degrees outside, which would fry me instantly.On your way, old Medusa, consider yourself a volunteer!"Grumbling, the Garnishee slipped through the door, admitting a wave of roasting heat, and began a clean scrubdown fore and aft.Jerry had another belt at the gin and then closed his eyes for a quick and well deserved nap.Chuck, stomach full at last, dozed as well, and it was real neat until another blast of heat announced Slug Togath's return."Pfffft," he said, and dust came out of his mouth when he spoke.His hide was wrinkled, and he was only about half as thick as he had been when he went out.Jerry looked on with interest as the Garnishee hooked a plastic hose to the faucet on the sink, then stuck it into one of the orifices in his body and turned the water on.He began to swell slowly and to lose the desiccated look."Little hot out there?"Jerry asked innocently, and smiled at the glare shot back at him from about a dozen bloodshot eyes."As soon as you fill your tank, we'll get on with the job.Did you say what was the name of the secret agent we had to contact?""I didn't say," Slug Togath burbled with hydratory relief."It is a secret. ""Well not from me, for chrissake," Jerry said petulantly."Give. ""Operator X 9," Slug Togath whispered."Better to commit suicide than to give that name away. ""I'll remember, I'll remember.What next?""We go to Haggis City.As we were landing, I noticed a monorail line not too far from here.Perhaps we can obtain transportation that way and not drain the batteries on this machine. ""Sounds good  lead the way. "Bluey fingered dawn had brightened the landscape as they climbed out of the rift and looked down at the plain.Sure enough the towers of a monorail line cut close by, and they could see a station not too far distant.They hurried the machine in that direction and only slowed when they saw other Hagg Loos ahead.More and more appeared, crawling out from under rocks where they lived, waving good bye to their mates, giving their young cheerful nips on the chitin with their claws as they departed."It looks like we hit the rush hour," Jerry mused."All the commuters going to work in the morning.Do you have a broadcast mental program for this?""I should think so ...here, how about this one.'Memories of an Orgy', a program designed to be eavesdropped on but not interrupted. ""Say, I'd like to hear that one myself!Though on second thought maybe I wouldn't.All those claws, crackling chitin, waving antennae.No, let them enjoy it. "Strolling casually, they joined the Hagg Loos, who were moving along the rock pathways and converging on the station.More than one antenna dipped and trembled in their direction  that recording must have been a doozy!but they were not bothered.Clambering up the stairs, they had only a short wait before the shining cars of the monorail train whooshed into the station.There was a rush for seats, and of course the experienced commuters got there first and snapped open the metallic sheets of their morning newsfax and hid behind them.The ride was not a long one, and before they knew it, the train had stopped at the immense Padng tun station in Haggis City and the commuters rushed for the exits.Slug Togath made sure that they went slower than the others, then pointed out why."See  as each one approaches the exit, it produces a pass of some kind which it shows to the officer stationed there. ""We have no pass?"Jerry queried."You took the words right out of my speaking hole. ""Then let's try in the opposite direction, back along the track.There will be freight exits, workers' entrances, something.And they will be a little more deserted if there is any trouble. "Clattering along casually on its twenty claw tipped feet, the hulking form of the Hagg Loos robot trotted away from the rushing workers.The platform ended in a metal gate with an unreadable inscription, and after a quick look around, Jerry cut the gate in half with a quick snick of the claws.There was a ramp beyond that plunged into the bowels of the station, so into the bowels they plunged.
