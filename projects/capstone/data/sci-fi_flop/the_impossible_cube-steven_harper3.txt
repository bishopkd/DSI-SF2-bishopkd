He got a room with someone.Wanna do the same?Alice made a disgusted sound.Do you do this often?Argue with a pretty woman or get drunk?Never mind.At least youre coherent.I need to show you something.This is Madame Nilsen.She doesnt speak English.The woman, who was carrying a lantern, smiled shyly at the mention of her name, and Gavin gave her a lopsided grin.Hi.Im dying, you know.Not that she cares.Mme.Nilsen shook her head.Alice spoke to her in French, and the other woman led the way with her tin lantern.Gavin said, Do you think the clockwork plague will let me learn French?Or Chinese?It sure as hell wont do anything else useful.Youre maudlin.Ive never seen you maudlin.Yeah.He rumpled his hair.Imagine.Just keep walking, Alice said.Itll sober you.I dont want to be sober.I deserve to be drunk.But I dont deserve you to be drunk.Keep walking or Ill show you how sharp these claws can be.Gavin almost sat on the street in a childish pique, but changed his mind and continued walking with his arms folded instead.After some time, they arrived at the top of a winding street.The climb put Gavin a little out of breath, and, as Alice predicted, cleared his head a bit.On the hills below and above, the city had darkened completely.Street  and houselights made a field of stars on wrinkled velvet, as if the night sky had fallen and shattered on the ground around them.Mme.Nilsen selected a tall, narrow house, knocked, and called out.After some time, the door opened, and a man and woman, both middle aged, appeared.They wore nightshirts and caps.Mme.Nilsen spoke to them in rapid French, and Alice joined in.The couple looked mystified, then hopeful.At their gestured invitation, everyone entered the long, narrow house that smelled of bread and ashes.Whats going on?Gavin asked as they climbed a steep staircase.In Luxembourg, they were always climbing.Theres plague here, but they dont want anyone to know, Alice murmured.If word of it gets out, the house will be quarantined until the family throws the victims into the street.Why do I have to be here?I want you to watch what Im doing.Now puzzled, Gavin followed the group into a bedroom.A boy lay on a bed, twitching in fever sleep.Loose hanks of pale blond hair lay on the pillow.Automatic fear touched Gavin when he recognized the clockwork plague, even though he was already dying of the disease in his own way.The boys parents looked on with worried expressions as Alice pulled off her glove, revealing the spider.Its eyes glowed red when she touched the boys bare arm.Then she swiped his skin with the claws, drawing blood and spraying a bit of her own.The parents gasped as one, but Mme.Nilsen talked to them and they calmed, though they remained watchful.Alice touched each of them in turn, but the spider eyes glowed green.The mother sat on the bed and stroked her sons forehead, her cheeks wet with tears.Gavins throat thickened as he felt her sorrow, fear, and love.There, Alice said.Now we wait.Mme.Nilsen slipped out to go home.Gavin rocked on his feet, waiting uncertainly.Perhaps you should sing, Gavin, Alice said.He stopped rocking.What?Sing.Itll pass the time.She turned her brown eyes on him.Sing the moon song for me.Please.Argument or no argument, he couldnt refuse her any more than the sun could refuse to rise.I see the moon, the moon sees me  It turns all the forest soft and silvery.The moon picked you from all the rest  For I loved you best.As Gavin sang for Alice and the boy, a boy who struggled to heal as Gavin himself had done so many weeks ago, something inside him broke, shifted, and re formed.The plague hurt a great many people, more than just himself, and Gavin, flying high above the earth or wrapped in music, had forgotten that.He pulled out his fiddle to accompany himself for the second verse.I once had a heart as good as new  But now its gone from me to you.The moon picked you from all the rest  For I loved you best.The leering eyes and sticky blood of Madoc Blue faded a little.The sharp memory of Tom Danforths lifeless corpse falling from the rigging dulled around the edges.The opaque stone walls that trapped him in Edwinas tower thinned.And then another memory came back to him.He himself was lying sick in bed, hot with fever.A woman Ma bent over him, bathing his face with a cool cloth.A man with pale hair played the fiddle and sang just for Gavin, his voice rich and low and perfect, and Gavin felt better, enveloped in the soft love of both parents.I have a ship, my ship must flee.Sailing oer the clouds and on the silver sea  The moon picked you from all the rest  For I loved you best.The memory vanished when the song ended.The boys twitching eased.His breathing evened out, and the fever faded.He opened his eyes and looked straight at Gavin for a long moment.A connection between them held for a second that lasted an age, and Gavin felt that the boy somehow understood what had just happened.Then the boy smiled and dropped back into sleep.Tears wet and refreshed Gavins cheeks, and he felt both exhausted and exhilarated.The boys mother flung her arms around him, weeping with joy, and his father swiped at his eyes with his sleeve.He said something to Alice in a choked voice, and she answered gracefully.They spoke at some length, and Alice nodded.Whats going on?Gavin wiped his own face and put his fiddle away as the father padded quickly out of the room.He knows of someone else who has the plague, Alice said.Do you think I should refuse?Gavin put a hand on her shoulder.I never wanted you to stop helping, Alice, he said.I just dont want you to get hurt because you dont know when to stop.Look at you you didnt even take a wrap, and youre shivering.Even though she didnt speak English, the mother seemed to notice the same thing and with a firm gesture that she was to keep it, gave Alice a quilt to pull around herself.Alice accepted.You have to watch yourself, Gavin added, or Ill tell Kemp on you.Alice gave a little bark of laughter at that.Then come with me.Anywhere.You know that.The father returned, dressed, and led Alice and Gavin outside to another house, where two adult brothers were down with the plague.Alice, the quilt still pulled around her, cured both of them while Gavin played, and one of them begged Alice to go to his nieces house.Along the way, they encountered a pair of plague zombies rooting through a rubbish heap, and Alice swiped at them as well.At the nieces house, Gavin stopped Alice and demanded that she be given food and drink, which the newly cured niece was happy to give before asking Alice to visit yet another house.And so it continued.As the night wore on, Alice hurried from home to home under cover of darkness, her quilt drawn around her like a cloak while she cured a number of people with the clockwork plague, and each one seemed to know someone else who was sick.The chain of people took them all through Luxembourg, to homes rich and poor, lonely and crowded, wood and stone.Gavin made sure Alice was given a bite to eat and a sip to drink in every household.Alice cured priests and drunkards, bankers and thieves, doctors and patients.Some offered money, always hesitantly, as if they might offend.Alice tried to turn them down, but Gavin stepped in and accepted.If they can spare it, we can take it, he said, fiddle in hand.I wont turn down someone who cant   Of course not, Gavin said.But even saints have to eat.And get to China.When dawn checkered the eastern sky, they left the final house.The air was crisp and clean and bright.Morning noises horse traffic, food sellers, factory whistles, doors opening and closing, people shouting and talking filled the street.Housewives and storekeepers swept the cobblestones in front of their homes and shops.Gavin noticed with a start that Alice was pale and shaky from the slow but steady blood loss, and she kept the quilt wrapped tightly around her body and head.Gavin himself didnt feel tired in the least clockworkers entering the later stage of the plague often went days without sleep and he mentally kicked himself for not remembering earlier that Alice did need rest, especially after everything shed been doing.He flagged down a cab and gave directions back to the pub where hed been drinking the night before.Alice leaned against him and dozed off, and he was surprised at how light she felt.The pub was closed, but Gavin found the cheap hotel where Feng had gotten a room and used the money Alice had earned to get them a room while Alice collapsed into a lobby chair.At the last second he remembered not to give his real name and signed them in as Mr.and Mrs.Tom Danforth, in honor of his late friend.He had no intention of actually sharing a room with Alice Fengs room would have to do when Gavin finally felt a need for sleep and he would have to hope Feng didnt have a woman with him but it was easier to fabricate a married relationship than explain to the clerk, who only spoke a few words of English.They met Feng, alone, on the way up the dark and creaking stairs, which saved Gavin the trouble of tracking him down.Explanations followed, and Alice went into her room without further discussion.You will not follow her?Feng said.He was wearing his scarf and goggles and on his back he wore the pack with the precious jar of fireflies in it.My lady friend last night enjoyed herself immensely, and I can give you advice, if you need it.Gavin sighed as they squeaked back downstairs on threadbare carpet.Although he was getting used to Fengs forthrightness and his interest in romance, it was still a little unsettling, and he could understand why Fengs father had despaired of him ever becoming a diplomat.Fengs undeniably exotic good looks doubtless made matters worse Gavin imagined he found it easy to sweet talk his way into any number of beds.Fortunately, he did seem to understand that showing even the slightest interest in Alice would result in a personal and rather brief experiment with the force of gravity from the deck of the Lady of Liberty, either at Gavins hands or Alices.I wont share quarters with her, Gavin said.Not until I can make an honest woman of her.And when will that be?They reached the little lobby again and a glimmer of brass caught Gavins eye.His blood went cold and he nearly dropped his fiddle case.Susan Phipps and Simon dArco were talking to the clerk.Run, he whispered hoarsely, and bolted back up the steps.They both smashed straight into Alices door.It splintered open.She lay on the bed and she was still dressed, a fact for which Gavin felt grateful.He scooped Alice up while Feng grabbed the bedspread from underneath her.Alice squawked as footsteps pounded on the stairs leading up to their floor.Gavin glanced at the window, but they were three stories up.No escape that way.They would have to fight their way out.He frantically assessed the room.Bed.Bare wood floor.Window.Thin curtains.Chamber pot.Washstand.Mirror.Light.Feng.Bedspread.Sheets.Fiddle case.Put me down!Alice barked.Gavin flung her back on the bed along with his fiddle case.He ripped the curtains off the wall with one hand and snatched up the rooms paraffin oil lamp in the other.Then he dug into his pockets for a match.Simon burst into the room, and Feng, who was standing beside the door, flung the bedspread over him like a net and kicked his legs out from under him.Simon went down with a muffled yelp.Phipps appeared in the doorway, more cautious.She held a pair of tuning forks in her hands.You!Alice cried from the bed.Caught you, Phipps said, you son of a   Gavin threw the lamp at her.She automatically parried it with her metal arm, and the cheap glass shattered, covering both her and the bedspread with lamp oil.Gavin popped the match alight with his thumbnail and applied it to the sheer curtain he was holding.Fear clenched his every nerve as it began to burn.Fire was the enemy of every airship, and to die in flame was the secret nightmare of every airman.He remembered Captain Naismith aiming a blazing crossbow bolt at the envelope of the Juniper, and how close he had come to dying in an inferno.His hands shook, making the fire dance.You wont, Phipps said flatly, and moved to strike the forks.Gavin ran straight for her, trailing flame.Phipps leaped backward, her eyes wide with fear, an expression Gavin had never seen on her before.Alice recovered herself and bolted after him with Feng right behind her.A bit of blazing curtain flapped behind them, preventing the oil soaked Phipps from pursuing right away if she wanted to avoid bursting into flame.Smoke and heat scorched Gavins face and heated his hands.The clerk stared at the trio from behind his desk as they fled outdoors.The sun shone on the bright, cobblestoned street.In the distance, calliope music played and people applauded.Traffic and pedestrians were currently giving the hotel a wide berth, though, because Glenda was standing on the sidewalk in one of the big mechanicals.Wotcha, she said, and reached for Gavin and Alice with big metal hands.Shit!Gavin flung the flaming ball of cloth at Glendas head.It bounced off the clear bubble encasing her, but the woman jerked out of reflex, which gave Gavin, Alice, and Feng a chance to dodge around the machine.This way!Gavin grabbed Alices hand and ran.Glenda recovered quickly and spun to face them.Gavin jumped into a nearby cab, pulling Alice with him.The startled driver didnt even have time to protest before Gavin shoved him out with a Sorry!and snapped the reins.The horses, already nervous about the mechanical, leaped forward.Feng managed to leap aboard as well, despite the rucksack that weighed him down.The cab jolted down the street with the mechanical in pursuit.Brass footsteps thundered behind them.Alice shouted at people to get out of the way, and Gavin grimly steered the frantic horses.Glenda swiped at the cab, missed, and gouged a chunk out of the street.People and horses screamed and scattered.Other automatons skittered out of the way.Fear gripped Gavins heart.Even if they got away now, their situation remained dire.Phipps was a bulldog, willing and able to track them, and Gavins conspicuous airship made the situation worse.They had to escape, not only now but in the long term.Where should we go?Alice cried, echoing his thoughts.How do we get away?And then he knew.It came to him in a flash of inspiration, and he had no idea whether it was inspired by the clockwork plague or his own imagination, but either way, it might work.Hope replaced some of the fear.I have an idea, he said.But we left my fiddle.I have it, Alice said, brandishing it.Didnt you notice?God, I love you.Faster!Feng shouted behind them.Glenda swiped at the cab again, and this time she clipped it.The cab yawed sideways, and Alice clung grimly with her free hand.Gavin hauled on the reins, turning the yaw into a full out left turn around a corner.The cab tipped on two wheels, then righted itself with a crash that slammed Gavins teeth together.The move caught Glenda by surprise, and she had to back up to make the turn, which bought Gavin a bit of lead.He shouted at the horses, but they were already going flat out.Glenda!Alice called over her shoulder.You dont have to do this!The Third Ward is dead!But Glenda either didnt hear or didnt care.The mechanical came after them with implacable determination.The horses were slowing, tired, allowing Glenda to make up the lost time.Gavin listened.The streets here were nearly empty and the calliope music was growing louder.He pulled the horses to a stop and jumped out of the cab.Jump!he said as Glenda brought both mechanical hands down.Feng and Alice leaped free as the mechanical smashed the cab to pieces.The panicked horses galloped away, dragging the remains with them.Glenda turned to face the trio, her expression stony.What are you doing?Feng demanded, but Gavin was already moving.Come on!He dashed down a side street, giving Alice and Feng no choice but to follow.There were still no people in evidence, but the narrow street was cluttered with front stoops, carts, piles of coal, and other street detritus.The trio leaped and twisted around it all, but Glenda was forced to slow a little.Ill catch you eventually, she shouted.You cant keep running!Gavin burst out onto a main street and into a crowd lining it.The calliope music leaped into full volume.Coming up the street was a man in a red top hat and a red and white striped shirt with garters just above the elbows.He wore a cloak flung back over his shoulders and he carried a silver topped cane.Behind him lurched a great brass elephant, puffing steam from its tusks.Its gait was oddly uneven.Scarlet signs on the animals sides spelled out Kalakos Cirque International du Automates et dAutres Merveilles in graceful, garish letters.Behind that came a horse wagon with an calliope on it played by an automaton, followed by the rest of the circus clowns and acrobats and lion cages and girls on mechanical horses, all waving and smiling.The crowd that had gathered to watch stared, unsure if Gavins actions might be part of the show.Without a pause, Gavin shoved through the crowd and made for the ringmaster at the front of the parade.He snatched the mans hat off, revealing sandy hair.What the hell?the ringmaster said, then blinked.Gavin?Great to see you, Dodd.Gavin flicked the cloak free.Just go with this and Ill explain later.Gavin, what are you ?Alice began, but he shoved the top hat on her head, tossed the cloak around her shoulders, and ran around the other side of the lurching elephant without looking to see if Feng and Alice followed him.They did, however, and that was fortunate.Glenda reached the mouth of the side street, but her view of her quarry was blocked by the elephant, who bumbled along as if the people didnt exist.Up top, the mahout looked down at them warily.Take off your goggles and scarf and your shirt, Gavin whispered to Feng, keeping pace with the elephant.The circus has Chinese.Youll look like an acrobat.Give me the rucksack.What about you?Alice buttoned the cloak and drew it around herself, hiding her body and Gavins fiddle case.And how do you know these people?Feng handed Gavin the rucksack, pulled off his shirt, and wrapped it around his head in a crude turban.He had a build that could pass for acrobatic, at a distance.Several people in the crowd had noticed Glendas mechanical, but they seemed to think it was part of the parade.They pointed and gasped with amazement.Glenda was momentarily stymied.She couldnt move forward without crushing people or sweeping them aside and hurting them, which Gavin didnt think shed be willing to do.A clown in white makeup, orange wig, and blue nose hurried up with a broom and a bucket.What are you three doing?Do you speak English?Bonzini!Gavin said.Remember me?Gavin?the clown gasped.What in ?Im looking for two men and a woman!Glenda boomed from the mechanical.They just came this way.Theres a reward!Thats torn it, Alice said.No, Feng said.The crowd speaks French and German.Thanks, Bonzini.Gavin plucked the wig and nose from the clown, jammed them onto his own head and face, and grabbed Bonzinis broom and bucket.The pack with the firefly cure in it went on Gavins back.Hey!Bonzini protested.But Gavin was already moving farther back, now using the calliope wagon and then a lion cage for cover.Alice and Feng came with.Glenda gave up on the crowd and was now nudging people aside so she could move onto the street.The calliope continued to hoot out something in D major.Split up, Gavin said.Why cant we just keep hiding behind the calliope?Alice hissed.The wagons high enough for her to see our feet.Gavin brandished the broom.Hide in plain sight.Smile and wave and tell anyone who asks that Dodd said it was all right.Gavin followed the lion cage with the broom over his shoulder, taking care that the bristles blocked Glendas view of his face.Behind Gavin, a pair of jugglers tossed clubs and balls.Alice and Feng dropped farther back into the parade, smiling and waving as they went.The parade moved ahead with aching slowness.The horse drawing the lion cage dropped manure onto the street right in front of the spot where Glenda had finally worked her way through the parade audience to the curb.Gavin swallowed hard and kept his head down as he paused and swept the smelly stuff into the bucket.Glenda scanned the street with flat, hard eyes.Gavin felt her gaze rest on him for a moment, and he forced himself to put a jaunty spring into his step, though tension dried his mouth and tightened his knuckles on the bucket.He was just a lowly sweeper clown.Not worth examining closely.Glenda narrowed her eyes and her mechanical took a step forward.Gavin held his breath.Then Glenda turned and stomped away.The crowd cheered and pointed at her, still sure she was part of the parade.Gavin let out his breath and stole a glance over his shoulder.Alice and Feng smiled and waved near a troop of acrobats.The automaton on the calliope finished its song and swung into another one.Gavin continued on his way with the bucket full of manure.Eventually the parade made its way to a field at the edge of town.The big striped tent called the Tilt, Gavin remembered rose up among a number of smaller tents and circus wagons.Off to one side waited the red locomotive and bright boxcars Gavin had seen from the airship earlier just before a clockworker fugue had taken him away.If not for the clockwork plague and the unexpected memory of his father, he might have recognized the train right away instead of recalling it later.He had also seen the flyers for the Kalakos Circus plastered about Luxembourg by the advance man, but they were in French and he hadnt paid close attention to them.He wasnt sure how he had missed the name; the French version wasnt so very different.The parade continued right up to the complex of tents.Behind the parade came an enormous crowd, all ready to see the show.The performers quickly scattered, some toward the Tilt, some to the sideshow tents, and others to direct the oncoming crowd toward the ticket sellers, who wore stovepipe hats with oversized tickets attached to the top so people could locate them.An intricately decorated mechanical clock at the entrance of the Tilt ran backward, counting down the minutes until the performance began.A life sized female automaton was attached to the clock, and even as Gavin watched, she jerked to life.She had only head, chest, and arms, and Gavin assumed this made her sufficiently inhuman to make her legal under Luxembourg law.Mesdames et messieurs!she called in a voice that carried from one end of the circus to the other.Le spectacle commencera dans cinquante cinq minutes!Mesdames et messieurs!Le spectacle commencera dans cinquante cinq minutes!And then she went still.Nearly an hour before the show, according to the clock.The extra time, Gavin recalled, gave the audience a chance to buy tickets, then get bored and decide to spend money at the sideshow.A firm grip took Gavins elbow.The ringmaster wants to see you in his car, said Bonzini, and you better not have sneezed inside my nose.The ringmaster kept an entire train car to himself.Alice took off the red top hat.Feng pulled on his shirt and tried to smooth out the wrinkles.Bonzini ushered the three of them inside, but didnt enter himself.The car had a large bed, comfortable chairs, two wardrobes, a small stove, full bookshelves, and a perfectly functional bar.It hadnt changed since Gavin had seen it more than two years ago.Neither had Dodd, who was waiting for them.Good God, Gavin, he said, his face split into a wide grin.I hope you have a good explanation for nearly wrecking my parade today.Who are these people?And wheres Cousin Felix?He pulled Gavin into a warm embrace without waiting for an answer, and Gavin suddenly found himself at the top of an upswell of emotion.His throat thickened, and words wouldnt come.The memory of Captain Felix Naismiths last moments slammed through Gavin, and he saw the captains expression as a pirates glass flechette sliced his flesh and ended his life.He heard the small sound that escaped the captains throat and felt the thud as the captains body slammed into the deck.Dodd read Gavins expression.No.Yeah, Gavin said thickly.Uh, this may take a while to explain.Mesdames et messieurs!Le spectacle commencera dans cinquante minutes!I have fifty minutes, Dodd said.Alice set Gavins fiddle and the rucksack with the cure in the corner and everyone sat down.Gavin introduced Alice and Feng and then started in with the loss of the Juniper to pirates, moving to the death of Dodds cousin, Captain Felix Naismith.Dodds face hardened as the story progressed.Alice went to the little bar and came back with a half full glass, which Dodd drained with a shaky hand when Gavin finished.I havent seen him in almost two years, Dodd said in a hoarse voice.I had no idea he was dead.Oh, God.What am I going to do?Gavin didnt know what to say.Alice and Feng, who didnt know Dodd at all, sat in uncomfortable silence.Mesdames et messieurs!Le spectacle commencera dans vingt minutes!We go months without contact, Dodd said, but that was all right.I was so glad when he got off that stupid scow he played second mate for and got on a real ship, and he was so happy when Boston Mail gave him his own command.Youngest captain in their fleet, he is.Was.Now hes gone.Shit.Alice coughed, and Dodd raised his glass to her in apology, then stared off into space.Dodd was young himself for a circus ringmaster, barely thirty, with large brown eyes that made him look even younger, despite the side whiskers.Gavin glanced at him, then around the little car.Whenever the Juniper was in a European port, Captain Naismith checked to see if the Kalakos Circus was in town too, and if it was, he always took Gavin and Tom with him to visit.The cousins caught up while the cabin boys got free run of the show.After the performance, Dodd gave them treats from the grease wagon, or even a windup toy from his workshop.Im sorry to bring bad news, Gavin said.I miss him, too.And Tom.But theres more.Gavin gave a thumbnail sketch of how Alices aunt Edwina had used her cure for the clockwork plague to manipulate Gavin and Alice into joining the Third Ward so Edwina could destroy it, and how Lieutenant Phipps was now chasing them   Wait, Dodd interrupted.He pointed at Alice.Youre a baroness who can cure the clockwork plague?He pointed at Gavin.And youve become a clockworker?Gavin nodded.Yes.Now we   What do you do?Dodd interrupted again, this time pointing at Feng.Walk on water?With a good running start, Feng replied.Mesdames et messieurs!Le spectacle commencera dans cinq minutes!A sharp knock came at the door, and a red haired man with startling blue eyes poked his head into the car.He wore an Arran fishermans sweater and a cloth cap.Dodd?Shows on.Are you  Gavin!Good Lord, lad, its been ages.Where are Tom and Felix?Dodd rose a little unsteadily.Theyre dead, Nathan.Oh, Jesus.Nathan strode in and caught Dodd in an embrace that went on for rather longer than most Englishmen or Irishmen felt comfortable with.Gavin suddenly put together a number of cues that had completely escaped him when he was younger.He glanced at Feng, who cocked his head, and the ridiculousness of the situation occurred to him.A baroness with an iron spider on her arm, a plague infested airman, and an undiplomatic Chinaman hiding from a giant mechanical with a circus ringmaster who fell in love with men.A wave of mirth suddenly overcame Gavin, and inappropriate laughter bubbled in his throat.Alice glared at him.Feng looked surprised.The laughter bubbled up again, and this time Gavin couldnt stop it.He laughed and laughed and pounded the little table with his fist and laughed some more.The odds of any of this happening were so high, they were impossible to calculate.Just the idea that his own ancestors would meet and produce offspring that would end in him while Alices and Fengs own families were doing the same thing, completely unaware that the culmination of their work and toil and sex would end in a circus with a ringmaster who dabbed it up with men.Trillions upon trillions of events, both enormous and minuscule, had to take place in perfect sequence in order for this meeting to occur and if any one of them had failed to happen, the three of them would be somewhere else or perhaps they wouldnt even exist.Best of all, they wouldnt even know the difference.Maybe they didnt know the difference now.Gavin doubled over, cackling and howling at the joke.Voices and faces swirled in a twisted rainbow around him.A slight stinging to his face told him hed been slapped, but it didnt faze him in the slightest.He laughed and laughed and then the world went black.Sometime later, Gavin bolted awake.He always bolted awake.The attack by the pirate Madoc Blue and the lashing Gavin had endured afterward had destroyed peaceful sleep and gradual waking.By now, he had forgotten what it was to slip calmly out of slumber and greet the day without sweat on his forehead and his heart in his mouth.He sat up and found he was on the bed with his shoes off.The sunlight had moved, and the car was dimmer.At the little table sat Nathan Storm, his sunset hair gleaming in the low light.The man was smoking a pipe, and the pungent tobacco smoke floated in a blue cloud near the ceiling.Everyone else was gone.Nice to see you among the living.Nathan puffed gently.Wheres Alice?Gavin asked.Exploring the midway.She slept and then wanted some air.He drew on the pipe again.That was interesting.You were cackling like  Gavin found his shoes on the floor and laced them on.Like a lunatic?Yeah.Clockworkers are mad.You know that.Whats it like?Nathan said.Its hard to describe.Gavin sighed.The plague shows me things, strange things, true things.Im not insane.Not really.You sounded pretty mad.You really hurt Dodd.Gavin winced.Shit.Oh, shit.Im sorry, Nathan.His pipe went out, and he tapped it into a bowl on the table.Youre apologizing to the wrong person.He and Felix arent werent really cousins, were they?That earned him a short bark of laughter.You were young, werent you?They met in Hamburg when Felix was working some leaky old airship and Dodd was still winding spiders for Viktor Kalakos.They tried to stay together, meeting up in whatever large cities they could, but it just didnt work.They did stay close friends.Dodd doesnt have any other family, so he started calling him Cousin Felix, and it stuck.And now you two  Not now, Gavin.For years.Since before Felix started bringing you to visit.Right.Gavin rubbed his face and remembered Simon, whose romantic tastes ran in the same direction.What were the chances?The corners of his mouth quirked, and he quickly ended that line of thought.Even clockworkers can be stupid.Damn right.You want something to eat?Ive got beans and bread here, unless youd fancy a candyfloss.At the mention of food, Gavins stomach growled, and he went light headed.How long was I away?All the way through the first show.The second starts in a few minutes.Nathan brought him a plate at the bed as if he were an invalid, but Gavin got up and ate at the table.He felt perfectly fine, except for the hunger.Wheres Dodd?he asked around a mouthful.Nathan looked surprised.Dodds in the ring.The show must go on.If youre done eating, lets go find your two friends so you can tell me what youre really here for.I dont think you hid in the parade just to have an excuse to deliver bad news.Outside, afternoon was fading into evening.The Tilt and the tents cast canted shadows over brightly painted wagons.Gavin knew from his previous visits that the wealthier performers lived in the wagons, which were rolled into the trains boxcars when circus left town.Poorer performers lived in tents.Other tents housed the sideshow exhibits and the animal cages.Smells of fried food and cooking sugar mingled with calliope music.Men, women, and children wandered about.A few stood in line outside the main entrance of the Tilt, handing over their tickets so they could file inside to find seats as the clock automaton shouted in French that the show would begin in one minute.The performers were out of sight behind the Tilt, awaiting cues and entries.There you are!Alice threw her arms around his neck in a near choke hold and kissed him.You scared the life out of me.Us.Im sorry.I need to apologize to Dodd.You must wait, Feng said.The performance will begin soon.Mr.Storm, could we go into the main tent?We should not be out in the open in case Phipps has tracked us here.Nathan nodded and took them past the ticket taker into the Tilt.Inside, tall rows of bleachers were bent around a wide red ring, and chatting, laughing people filled most of the spaces.Sawdust lay scattered on the ground.Food sellers moved among them with trays of rich smelling roasted peanuts and pink cotton candy.Off to one side, the automaton played its calliope.Just as the group arrived on one side of the ring, the tent flaps on the opposite side exploded open and Dodd strode into the Tilt.He had his red hat back, and his silver topped cane waved in time to the music.Behind him came the mechanical elephant, its feet thudding unevenly on the packed earthen floor.The mahout looked a little seasick at the uneven footsteps.Then came a rainbow explosion of clowns and a group of horses, both live and mechanical, accompanied by slender girls in white feathered dresses, and behind them came acrobats in tight red shirts.A trainer led a lion on a leash and made it roar.For the hell of it, Gavin snatched the recording nightingale from his pocket and pressed the left eye just as the trainer made the lion roar a second time.Then he held the nightingale to his ear and pressed the right eye.It opened its beak and roared like a little lion, which made the real lion look around, startled.Alice shot him a hard look.Oops.He hadnt realized it would be so loud.Gavin stuffed the nightingale into his pocket and looked innocent.The parade, a smaller one than the one in town, stomped round the ring and stormed out to cheers and applause from the audience while Dodd went into the center and leaped onto a small platform with stars on it.Bienvenue, he said, au le Kalakos Cirque International du Automates et dAutres Merveilles!The audience, pleased that Dodd spoke their language, burst into more applause just as a troupe of clowns somersaulted into the ring.Dodd got out of the way, and the show began in earnest.He caught sight of Nathan and his entourage lurking at the edge of the bleachers and trotted over.Im sorry, Gavin said before he could speak.We clockworkers do stupid things sometimes.Its not an excuse, just an explanation.Im sorry.Dodd nodded.Youre my last link to Felix, Gavin.I cant be angry with you.I need help, Dodd, Gavin told him.The audience laughed.And only you can give it.The ringmaster looked wary.How?In the ring, a clown pedaled around on a unicycle with a bucket of whitewash, which he threatened to toss over the audience.Gavin swallowed, suddenly nervous.Dodd was part of the idea hed gotten earlier, when Glenda was chasing them with the mechanical.He hadnt had time to think about it further since the chase had started, and now that everything had slowed down, the days events were catching up with him.He glanced at Alice.She and Feng were counting on him.If Dodd refused to help, theyd be in serious trouble.We found out that plague cures have been invented or discovered more than once, Gavin said, but England and China have suppressed them.English cures were never able to cure clockworkers, only regular victims, but the Chinese ambassador told us the Dragon Men Chinese clockworkers might have a full cure.The clown flung his bucket, but turned it aside at the last moment.The audience whooped at him, half laughing, half fearful.So you need to get to China, Dodd said.Im sorry, Gavin.We arent going to China.Gavin shook his head.We dont need to go that far.I have an airship, but shes easy to spot and track.Its how Phipps and the others followed us to Luxembourg.We need to lose them and earn enough money to fuel the ship for a flight to Peking.Whats that to do with me?The circus is a perfect cover, Gavin blurted out.Youre heading east.I can hide the ship on the train, and we can hide among you, do some work to earn money.Once we get far enough along, well leave.Oh, Gavin I dont know, Dodd said.I like you.Hell, youre almost like a little brother to me.But the coppers already give us the hairy eye when we come to town.Feng muttered something in Chinese that sounded like a swear word, and Gavins heart sank.The clown drew his bucket back one more time.Phipps has no real jurisdiction outside England, Gavin said, still trying.Doesnt seem to stop her.And I dont know that I have any paying work for you.Look, I want to help, but   How long has that elephant been lurching like that?Alice interrupted.The clown threw the buckets contents, but all that came out was confetti.The audience laughed and cheered.What?Dodd said.Uh two months, perhaps three.We bought it from a clockworker several years ago, but it seems to be breaking down.No one knows how to fix it.Is that so?Alice said.Interlude  I was that close, Lieutenant, Glenda fretted.I practically had them in my hands.So did I, Phipps reminded her.And I am not worried.There are only so many places they can run to, and Alice is on a mission.What do you mean?Simon asked.Once again, they were in a hotel room, though this one was rather better than the previous one.Clean, airy, with fresh linens on the beds and flowers on the nightstand, and a water closet on every floor.Once again, Glenda perched on a chair, Simon sprawled on the bed, and Phipps paced the floor.Havent you been listening to the talk on the street?Shes curing people, one by one, with that gauntlet of hers.Phipps unconsciously flexed her own brass hand.They break local laws about entering houses of plague, Gavin Ennock sings, Alice Michaels scratches people with that sword of hers, and people call them angels for breaking the law.They managed to hide the airship, Glenda growled.Theres been no sign of the thing.Theres also been no sign of Dr.Clef since the affair at the greenhouse, Simon put in.That worries me a little.It worries me, too, Phipps admitted.Though it may mean he has died.Glenda muttered, Life is never so easy.You do have a point.Phipps sighed.We must operate on the assumption that Dr.Clef is still alive and very dangerous.The trouble is, weve been underestimating them.All of them.Gavin is a clockworker, with all a clockworkers requisite cunning.And madness.Glenda poured herself a glass of water from a pitcher on the table.Ill wager Alice is enjoying herself.At any rate, well never find them at hotels now.Theyre going to be wary of public houses.Unfortunately, they could hide any number of other places, including the homes of grateful plague victims.Already the pieces were falling together.Strategy and planning, three and four steps ahead.If this happens, then that.If that happens, then this.Though it was difficult to think through the anger and the fear.She wasnt afraid of what Gavin and Dr.Clef might do not really.She was afraid of failing and earning that tiny shake of her fathers head, the one that tormented her every night when she went to bed.Phipps drummed metal fingers on the windowsill, as was fast becoming her habit.Was she doing the right thing?The just thing?Was she pursuing Gavin and Alice and Dr.Clef out of true justice, or because her father   No.She couldnt afford doubt now.Aloud, she said, The smart thing would be for them to hide, true, but they wont do the smart thing.I repeat to you: Alice is on a mission, and she cant accomplish it in hiding.Thats how well get her.You mean to set up an ambush, Simon said.Absolutely.I believe now is also the time to visit the gendarmes and cash in some Crown influence.They can search the city while we set a trap at the appropriate place.Whats the appropriate place?Glenda asked.At the highest concentration of plague victims, of course.Phipps gave a grim smile.I want to run a check on the mechanicals first thing in the morning.And then were going to shop for bread and wine.Chapter Five  Alice shut the huge access panel on the elephants left side and set the spanner on the workbench with a clank.Grease stained her face and blouse.The Tilt felt big and empty now, with its rows of vacant bleachers and high canvas roof.All the sawdust was trampled into the ground, and the bleacher rows were littered with dead peanut bags.Dodd stood nearby, watching closely, while Gavin and Feng occupied front row bleachers.That was fascinating, Alice said.I even made some improvements on the memory wheels and increased the visual acuity.Meaning what?Dodd asked.It doesnt necessarily need a rider.Look.With a sidelong glance at Gavin and a certain amount of pride, she gestured at the big brass elephant, which came smoothly to its feet and plodded steadily around the ring, hissing and puffing steam.Alice gestured again, and it stopped.She felt like a sorceress who had conjured a steaming elemental from the depths of the earth.Gavin applauded, and Alice turned a little pink.She had to admit that she had done this in no small part to impress him.After everything he had done this morning rescuing her from Phipps, getting them away from Simons mechanical, and ingeniously hiding them in a circus she felt a need to impress him.All right, Dodd said.We have a deal.So youll take us with you?Gavin said.Alice made the elephant sit like an enormous dog.This was fun.Absolutely, Dodd said.We havent had anyone who can service the machines in a long time.Thats why we were heading to Kiev.Kiev?Feng got to his feet, concerned.Is that wise?The Ukrainian Empire is the source of the clockwork plague.Is it?Alice straightened.Ive never heard that.Its never been proven, Gavin said slowly, and not something everyone discusses.Kiev does seem to have the earliest cases of plague on record.Earliest cases?Feng said.Thats an understatement worthy of my father.According to the histories, in 1750 the Dnepro River boiled in the center of Kiev and the plague rose up like a dragon and devoured the city.The river boiled?Alice repeated.What on earth does that mean?No doubt some hyperbole found its way into the history, Feng said.Which only goes to show that the stories are unreliable, Dodd pointed out.Boiling rivers indeed!Then the plague rose up again ten years later, Feng continued, undaunted, and one more time twenty years after that.Kiev seems to attract the plague.No one has more cases of it, and no one has an earlier source of it.Then why go there?Gavin said.The plague is at an ebb right now, Dodd told him.Besides, we have Alice, and everyone in the circus is immune by now.The Ukrainians do have world class automatons.They do have pots of money.And they love a good circus.If we keep our noses clean, we can sell out two shows a day for a month.Weve played there a dozen times before with no trouble.Its true they dont like Jews or Catholics, but we have neither in the circus.I was thinking we would go south, through Turkey, Feng said, obviously ill at ease.That would be out of our way, Gavin pointed out.And the Ukrainians have paraffin oil, dont they?They practically invented the stuff, Dodd said.Russia pays them tribute in petroleum, and theyve done some incredible things with it.Ive already arranged to rent space and Linda says she saw us in Ukraine, so   Linda?Alice interrupted.She and her husband, Charlie, tell fortunes in the sideshow, Dodd answered.Theyre very good, especially since Charlies accident.You base this decision on a fortune teller?Feng said incredulously.And everything else I mentioned, Dodd said.Look, Ive already decided that were going.If you want to come along, come.We can use Miss Michaels.The rest of you are dead weight, but   Hey!Gavin said.I can play the fiddle!And he sings, Alice pointed out, feeling defensive.I could walk a tightrope, too, Gavin muttered.And learn the trapeze.Wouldnt take more than ten minutes.Stupid clockwork plague gives me stupid extra reflexes.May as well make some extra money out of it before it kills me.The Flying Tortellis would drop something on my head if I put you in the ring, Dodd said with a grin.Besides, youre supposed to be hiding.I was joking about the dead weight.You really do have trouble with British humor, dont you?Now, look   Ive never visited the Ukrainian Empire, Alice interrupted.But if its the center of the plague, I should certainly go there with Gavin.Why are you so unhappy, Feng?They are Cossack barbarians, Feng spat.They build and pollute and fight.They care nothing for balance or beauty.You worry about balance?Alice asked archly.And the Chinese put them in power, Gavin said.That doesnt make them any less barbaric, Feng shot back.In any case, I want to go there with Gavin,Alice repeated.She stood the elephant back up and sent it to the side of the ring.But please explain that remark about power.Feng crossed his arms.England had an arrangement with China, he said.After the Napoleonic Wars ended, it became clear that parts of Europe the west and the Ottoman Empire the east could unite and become a threat to Britannia and China.Our governments didnt want that to happen.So we came to an understanding.Britannia took the west and China the east.I dont need a history lesson, Dodd complained.Will the elephant work for anyone, Miss Michaels, or just you?Alice waved him away.Anyone, Ringmaster.What do you mean by took, Feng?Took charge.Feng was pacing again.Napoleons nephew was supposed to rule France after the old emperor was exiled, but the man died.With no strong ruler, France fell into civil war, and now it is four fragments.Why do you think that was?Prussia is ten tiny kingdoms who never agree.Why is that?Your Calvinists and Lutherans war with each other as well.Why does this happen?Youre going to tell me the Third Ward keeps everyone off balance.Indeed.Up!Dodd said, gesturing.Up!Miss Michaels, he isnt moving.You have to use your left hand, Ringmaster, Alice replied absently.I assume China has a role as well?China, Gavin put in, destabilized the east.Russia and Poland had split Ukraine in half and were draining it dry.The resources gave both countries enough power to make China and Britain nervous.Then the clockwork plague hit Ukraine again.For some reason, it created more clockworkers than normal in Kiev.A Cossack captain named Ivan Gonta ended up with a special talent for war machines, and his superior Maksym Zalizniak used Gontas inventions to start a revolution.The elephant got up and lumbered around the ring.It picked up speed, steam trailing from its tusks.Dodd waved frantically at it, but it didnt slow down.Oh!I vaguely remember something about that from a history book, now that you mention specific names, Alice said.Gonta and the other clockworkers put together hundreds of war machines and slaughtered thousands of Russians and Poles until they abandoned Ukraine to the Cossacks.Hello there!Dodd shouted.Runaway elephant!Did you ever stop to wonder where Gonta and Zalizniak found the money and materials to build all those machines?Feng asked.Alice gestured sharply, and the elephant screeched to a halt.I have the feeling it came from China.Was that a malfunction?Dodd asked.Because I swear I did the exact same thing.Feng nodded.The emperor chose wisely the Cossacks are content to defend their borders without expanding them, and they make an excellent wedge between Russia and Poland.I am your boss, Miss Michaels, Dodd said.Of course you are, Gavin murmured.At any rate, Feng concluded, the ruling Cassocks are actually crueler to their own people than the Poles or Russians ever were.Its the nature of the warrior class.And were walking right into them?Steaming into them, Dodd said.We have a train.But I told you not to worry.They love us.Now, show me how to work this damned elephant.Alice gave him a wide smile.Whats the magic word, Ringmaster?As a hint, Ill tell you that it isnt damned.Gavin laughed, and Alice thought it was the most musical thing she had ever heard.Later that afternoon, Alice opened the hatchway on the Lady of Liberty in her hiding place at the abandoned stable and climbed belowdecks.The familiar narrow corridor faced with doors greeted her.The creaking space felt eerie and claustrophobic without Gavin here.Alice went past her stateroom all the way down to the end and slid the last door open.Inside was the tiny laboratory Gavin had built into the airship.The entire place was set up for efficiency.Tools hung on the bulkheads, tabletops folded up, tiny drawers kept everything pigeonholed.It even had a tiny forge, which was currently glowing and made the room hot and stuffy.The place was also hung with half a dozen clocks.They ticked madly, their exposed gears whirling.Stuck everywhere were pieces of paper, large and small.Every one of them had the same drawing, one of a three dimensional wire cube that twisted Alices eye.Part of the back passed over the front, or perhaps the front passed under the back.The drawings were done in pencil, charcoal, colored ink, and one medium that looked suspiciously like blood.Dr.Clef was standing in the midst of all this with his back to Alice.He seemed to be scratching something in a notebook.Click leaped down from the rim of a porthole and hurried over to her, purring loudly.Alice scooped him up.His skin was cool and smooth.Click, she said.Oh, Ive missed you.Dr.Clef turned and pushed his goggles up.Alice!When did you come back, my dear?I have not seen you in weeks.Weeks?Alice stroked Clicks brass back.Doctor, its been only two days.Oh.Are you sure?He glanced at the clocks.How interesting.Did you know that gravity affects a clock?Er no.Look at these.He pointed at the ones closest to the ceiling.They are moving at a slightly different rate than the ones down there at the floor.It gets more noticeable when I put them on top of the ships envelope.It is because they are farther away from Earths gravity.They look the same to me, Dr.Clef.Dr.Clef shrugged.They are not.Are you trying to re create your Impossible Cube, Doctor?she asked.With difficulty.He pointed at a small cable spool on the worktable.It was wound with fat, stiff looking wire.I have managed to reforge some of my special alloy using nails and other scraps from the barn, but I do not think I can re create the Cube itself.And I do miss it.Whats the problem?It is was unique in all time and space.Dr.Clef sighed.I am beginning to think it cannot be re created, for that would violate the basic nature of its uniqueness.But look at what I have learned while I am trying.He held up a notebook with a number of formulae scribbled in it.When you measure certain events, you change them.You can, for example, discover how fast a certain piece of of matter is moving or you can learn its location, but you cant pin down both.It is very odd.Ridiculous.Alice waved her free hand.There.
