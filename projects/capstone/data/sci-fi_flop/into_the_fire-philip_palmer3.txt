No wonder Id attracted so much interest when I walked in.Mind you, it wouldnt harm my ability to put the frighteners on someone.As I ran my eyes along the bar, person after person averted their gazeuntil I got to Yoshi and his two new companions.They were looking over, obviously in discussion about me.A few moments later, Yoshi returned.Maybe I have a job, he muttered, making sure no one overheard.Yeah?Not so difficult, but delicate: letting someone know theyre not wanted anymore, time to move on.Okay, I said.It sounded a little odd, but I was grateful for anything.I also realized that Yoshi mustve vouched for me.Theyll take you to their boss.Sorry?The client.I frowned at him, now not understanding.If they had a boss and there was a job, why werent they doing it?Who is it?Yoshi gave me that fixed smile I remembered so well and I nodded my head, knowing I shouldnt have asked.For some time I just sat there, waiting for the two guys to finish eating, wondering what the hell I was getting myself into.Why would these two need someone else to put the frighteners on?The big guy was as tall as me but probably weighed twenty or thirty pounds moreand it wasnt fat, either.His companion, a sharp faced little Latino, looked as if he killed people all day just for fun.Eventually, they finishedno bill, I noticedand made their way to the door, giving me the slightest of nods to indicate that I should follow.Out in the street I saw them get into this big black limo.I think you must have to have some kind of permit to drive in the City now.You see plenty of official cars, Infinity vehicles, public transport, but I just realized private autos were few and far between.Which means whoever I was dealing with had influence.They started the motor before I could get to them and slid down the road forty or fifty yards.I guessed they didnt want anyone in the First Original seeing me getting in their vehicle.I caught them up and the big guy opened the back door, neither of them responding to my muted greeting.The Latino floored his foot almost before my ass touched the seat.Being driven through the smoke filled streets of the City was to truly appreciate what kind of world wed come back to.We went for block after block and there was nothing, just islands of burned debris with ash swirling around them, blackening peoples faces and clothes.Occasionally we were forced to make a detour, even turn around once or twice, as fires exploded into the sky before us.You wanna talk about Hell?The City fitted the description perfectly.And to think Id once believed nothing could be worse than the Island.The other thing it was impossible to ignore was the number of zombie sick around.I dont know what percentage of the population they represented, but in some areas they were obviously the majority.They looked so weak that even the effort of stretching one foot in front of the other was too much for them; I watched one slowly move his leg forward and hit the ground, looking as if he thought his foot might break.I also couldnt help but notice that a lot of the authority figures, even everyday Specials, were wearing masks like the camera guy in the supermarket had, presumably to protect them from contracting zombie sickness.But all this was no more than a backdrop to what was going through my head: Id jumped at the chance of this job partly cuz Id feared it was the only one Id be offered, but now I was starting to wonder if Id been a little too hasty.Who knew who these two worked for?I hadnt met anyone from the old days, but that didnt mean they werent around, and actually, when I stopped and thought about it, there were some worrying possibilities.If Id wanted the money for any other reason but Lenas operation, I wouldnt have gone anywhere near this.When we arrived at the house of the client, I felt even more uneasy.It was massive and forbidding, with two huge and hungry looking dogs patrolling the garden.Whoever Id come to see was obviously someone feared and respected.For the second time since returning to the Mainland, I was escorted in through the tradesmens entrance; through the kitchen to a hallway, where I waited while the bigger guy went to talk to his boss.He didnt make any attempt to lower his voice.I heard him quite clearly making a joke at my expense, saying I was just the man for the job, that Id frighten the hell out of anyone.There was a pause while I waited for the boss reaction, to hear what he had to say.Okay.Bring him in.In that moment, it felt as if a sinkhole opened up inside me, that all my insides were sucked down into it.No...It couldnt be       Into the Fire        SIX It says a lot that I hadnt thought about him, hadnt so much as mentioned his name, in more than ten years.I mean, the way things have been, all that time the satellites were in control, I thought he wouldve moved on, maybe even died, but obviously not.Its a weird thing having a half brother, especially when hes the only family youve got.Its the part you dont know that makes you distrust him, and the part you do that confirms your suspicions.I was thirteen before I even knew he existed.He just came up to me one day in the street, leaned right into my face and sneered, Hey, Im your big brother.I didnt have a clue what he was talking about.He was quite a lot older than me, and twenty or thirty pounds heavier, and shit to admit, pretty intimidating.I didnt know what to say, ended up just shrugging and walking on, hoping he wouldnt follow.The next thing I knew I was flat out on the ground, blood pouring from my forehead, with him on top of me yelling about showing my big brother respect.I thought he was crazyan escaped inmate from the local nuthouse, until I got home and told Ma, who immediately went all quiet and thoughtful on me.She headed off to her bedroom and I realized there was more to this than Id imagined.I never saw the old man as the cheating kindthe beating kind, sure, the bitter and twisted kind and, on the odd occasion, the joking and crooning kind, but then again, if you get drunk that often, I guess at some point youre gonna be just about every kind going.Turned out hed had his fair share of affairs, most of them no more than a block or two from our home.He was never the most energetic of individuals, couldnt be bothered to play further awayperhaps he preferred to save his strength for lovemaking.During that period, he managed to father a couple of kids with different mothers.Ma never actually knew what was going on, not for certain, though for sure she had her suspicions, but she decided just to turn a deaf ear to all the whispering.After he died, it became even more important to her that she didnt know, that she didnt have her whole life undermined.It was my misfortune to unknowingly put an end to all that make believe.I dont know what it was about Ray, maybe he had a hang up about being illegitimate, but once hed introduced himselfonce hed started to terrorize and torture mehe just wouldnt stop.Every day on my way home he would catch me somewhere and give me a good beating.It got so bad you could actually follow the trail of blood on the sidewalk to my home.But, no matter what he did, how hard or often he hit me, I always tried to get him back, feeling that bit better if I could get in one good shot, maybe even give him the suspicion of a bruise.Though that was a problem too: if I did, it just made him even more angry, even more vicious.I stuck it for a while, in the way you often do when youre a kid, cuz you think you got no choice, then one day I got these books from the library, bout working out and different martial arts and stuff.It took me almost two months before I finally managed to nail him.That afternoon, I used this move Id been working on over and over and not only dumped him on his ass but gave him a black eye tooa real big, bright purple shiner.course, he went crazy, beating me up so bad I had to go to hospital, but at least I had a brief moment of revenge.The only problem then was, how was he going to react?The next time I saw him, was he going to maintain this new level of fury?cuz I gotta tell you, I wasnt sure I could take it, not on a regular basis.A couple of days later he brought a friend with him and they beat me up good and propersplit my lip, blacked both eyes, cracked my ribsbut, do you know something?It didnt matter.In fact, I almost smiled my way through it, you know, cuz I knew I had him, that if he needed a friend to help him deal with me now, it could only be a matter of time.I cant tell you how sweet my eventual revenge was, the day I left him lying unconscious on this patch of waste ground, still cursing him as I walked away, even though he couldnt hear me.I didnt see him again for ten years and by then I was working for Mr.Meltoni, learning the tricks of the trade, running some pretty sweet little numbers, or so I thought.Though actually, at that age, youre not really thinking, just enjoying the ride.Theres only one problem with being top dogtheres always someone sniffing around, baring their teeth, wanting to take a piece out of you.We got to hear about this new gang moving into the area, real mean sons of bitches, prepared to do anything to get themselves a reputation.They carried out a couple of high profile killingswell, more like massacres really, taking out Mr.Meltonis clients restaurants as well as the customers who happened to be in them.But it wasnt that that upset so many people, it was Francesca Cassano.She was only five, cute as hell, the daughter of a banker.They kidnapped her, and when he didnt come up with the ransom fast enough, hung her from the bridge over the expressway for everyone to see.In fact, the suspicion was that they never intended to negotiate, that all they really wanted to do was enhance their bad ass reputations.When we found out who was to blame, I was pretty sickened to hear Ray Ormerods nameI mean, no one was sure whod actually done the deed, but I knew that son of a bitch well enough to know he was capable.In no time, a turf war broke out; theyd take out one of ours, wed take out two of theirs and vice versa.It couldve gone on forever if Mr.Meltoni hadnt come up with this really smart plan.He knew their boss, Frenchie Martin, had a few horses and that he doted on this one in particularDancing Boy.He really loved that animal; nothing was too good for it.It had a stable a dozen Detainees wouldve been proud to call home.If itd been Dancing Girl, I reckon he wouldve slept with it every night.Mr.Meltoni managed to get to one of their stable boys and have Dancing Boy poisonedcourse, it wasnt that that was so clever, it was knowing how Frenchie would react.He was heartbroken and insisted on a massive funeral for the horse, with all the pomp and ceremony of a king or president.The only thing was, that same stable boy scooped out some of Dancing Boys insides and stuck a bomb in there.You aint ever seen anything like it.There was this special graveyard up in the hills, complete with church and properly ordained minister, for the pets of very rich owners, and every one of Frenchies guys was ordered to turn up to say goodbye to Dancing Boy.It needed a dozen of his strongest, including Frenchie himself, to act as coffin bearers.Mr.Meltoni detonated the bomb from his limo up on the highway.There was the most almighty explosion, this loud kerrump!and, not to put it too indelicately, body parts flew everywhere, horse, human, who knew?God knows how they put them all back together, how they divided things up for all the funerals that followed.Maybe they didnt bother, just did it by weight.It became a bit of a joke around the neighborhoodhorsemeat salad and French dressingyeah, I know, not exactly in the best of taste, but thats how we people are, we like to make jokes about death, to prove it dont really frighten us.We thought that would be an end to it, but its times like that, when theres a power vacuum, that those not prepared to do the work to fulfill their ambitions sometimes seize the initiative.It didnt take him long.Within six weeks, Raywho, at the moment the bomb went off, had been behind the church taking a leaktook over what little remained of Frenchies operation.A year later no one was mentioning Frenchie Martin anymore; itd become Big Rays gang.And yet, to my surprise and I guess, his credit, he didnt return to the path of confrontation; he let it be known he wanted to talk to Mr.Meltoni.I had no choice but to go along and listen to their discussions, to see that piece of shit try to elevate himself to the same level as my boss, my only comfort being that I was sure Mr.Meltoni would put him in his place.But do you know something?Crime is just another business.When it comes to making money, to doing the right thing for the company, people are prepared to overlook anything.Its the same with politics.International relations, beliefs and morality are one thing, but money always speaks a damn sight louder.People will lie down with anyone and forget all manner of evils and atrocities as long as theres something in it for them.They worked out a deal where they could focus their energies on taking care of their individual businesses and not on trying to kill each other: Mr.Meltoni let Ray have the parts of the City he never really got to grips withplaces like Chinatown, where he felt cultural differences made it too difficultand from then on, they became the best of friendswell, like I said, this is business, so they acted like the best of friends.Nevertheless, there was no choice but for me to go along with it, to occasionally welcome Ray and his boys to Mr.Meltonis home, even pour him drinks and stuff.You can imagine how much he enjoyed thathow he went out of his way to humiliate me whenever he could.I never told Mr.Meltoni he was my half brother, I mean, as far as I was concerned, he wasnt; I wouldve denied it to anyone, God himself couldnt have tortured it outta me.The last time I saw him was when Mr.Meltoni died, right after the funeral.He approached me in the parking lot, came over to offer me a job; said it would show continuity, that his rivals would be less likely to wage war against him if I was involved.I dont think he believed me when I said Id had enough, that I was going straight.Maybe he thought I had ideas of my own, or perhaps he was just incensed at me having the gall to turn him down.One way or another, he got really ugly, telling me I was too stupid to do anything else, that I had no education, no other experience, that Id end up on the street.Which, did he but know it, turned out to be right on the button.That was the reason I got sent out to the Islandbut Id still rather have what I had over there than carry on living the life of a criminal.In the end I just turned and walked away from him, like I did that first time we met, leaving him screaming after me, cursing me from the window of his limo as he was driven away, telling me that if I didnt join him, I was against him, and Id be taken care of.I never saw him again.Not from that day to this.I thought about turning around and running out of there, getting away from that place as fast as I could, but I guess I hoped I was wrong, that after all those years how could I possibly be sure it was his voice?I was beckoned into this rather palatial room, all gilt edged this and velvet that, and in the middle of it, like some unwelcome sore denying the existence of all beauty, sat this huge old man I instantly recognized.He looked utterly grotesque, slumped in this wing backed chair, his heavy chin on his chest, a few strands of long, greasy hair flopped across a flaky scalpa comb over hed given up on long ago.His complexion was so red he looked like he was covered in a rash.But none of this mattered in comparison with the leg he had propped up before him.You wouldnt have believed the size of it: it was like some monstrous bandaged mummy.I could see his left leg was also swollen, but the right one was almost twice its size.I just stood there, waiting, knowing my appearance, the changes over the years, could only hide me from him for a few seconds.It was almost comic: one moment he was staring at me like I was a cross between a curio and a clown; the next this expression had collapsed to be replaced by recognition.What the fuck, Van?he yelled.The Afro Caribbean guy looked at the door, as if he thought someone else had come in.Whats the matter?Is this who you brought me?Yeah.Jesus!I thought he was perfect What the fuck do you want?Ray demanded, turning on me.A job, I said simply, deciding to bluff it out.You gotta be kidding.There was a long silence, no one quite knowing how to react, Ray expelling these grunty little noises while he tried to collect himself.You said someone unknown who looked like hed frighten the hell out of anyone, the Afro Caribbean guy protested.Fucking idiot!Ray snarled.He paused for a moment, staring at me, taking in my appearance.What the hell happened to you?Where you been?Around.You stink, he said, wrinkling up his nose as if hed just caught his first whiff of me.I never said anything, but a look came into his eyes and I knew hed worked it out.Youre an escaped Detainee!he exclaimed.I didnt deny it, which was all the proof he needed.All this time you been out on the Island!So?Jesus!he cried, somehow managing to heave the many folds of his face into a twisted smile.You ended up on the Island!After all those high and mighty words!Best news I had in years.To my surprise, he started to laugh, this kind of sickening gurgling, like he was rolling rocks around in his throat, and his two guys, plainly relieved to see it, joined in.What happened to your legs?I asked.He immediately stopped, glaring at his propped up leg as if it was something alien to him.Rotting, he told me.Rotting and poisonous.One day they reckon they might swell up so much they explode.Isnt there anything they can do?He shook his head.Its not just my legsits taking over my whole body.Nothing can stop it.Germs have developed a resistance to our resistance.Less than twenty five percent of antibiotics work now.Im sorry, I said, with very little conviction.Sure you are, he said, adjusting his leg.There was a pause in which I realized that was probably as civil as either of us was going to get, and if I had something to say, it had better be now.Whatever this job, I promise you, itll be done to your satisfaction.All I want is ten grand.Yoshi mightve thought it wasnt a lot of money in this day and age, but Ray wasnt happy about it at all.Though whether that was cuz he thought it was too much, or cuz he didnt want to pay it to me, I dont know.I know Im older, and...yeah, we had our problems, but at least you know I do things right.He paused for a moment, taking in a lungful of ragged air and expelling it, apparently giving it some thought.After all, business is business, I added.He nodded as if Id just cited a universal truth that no one could deny.Or maybe it was more that he wanted the job done urgently and I was just right for it.You look the part, thats for sure, he said begrudgingly.Seen better looking things crawl out of my ass.He laughed at his own joke, as did Van, the Afro Caribbean minder.I even smiled myself, just to keep things moving along.Eventually he sighed and gestured to Van to pass me a photo.Theres this guy, bothering someone I used to know, making a real nuisance of himself.I want him to leave her alone.I immediately understood what it was all aboutan ex had got herself a new man.Ray couldnt have her anymore and didnt want anyone else to either.He wanted whoever it was frightened off, but just in case they ever told her, it couldnt come from him, or from anyone known to associate with him.It had to be utterly anonymouswhich was why theyd made sure no one saw me get in the limo.I dont want him dead, Ray insisted, though obviously with a degree of reluctance.Fucking bitchll only blame me.I want him out of the picture, but still visible.Okay.Give him the address, he told Van.I was out of there five minutes later, barely able to believe my luck.Of all people, Ray wouldve been last on my listand yet, just like when Mr.Meltoni made peace with him, wed come to an arrangement.He still hated me, he made that plain, telling me never to go to his house again, that Id stunk it out, to collect my money from Yoshi.But when all was said and done, I could be useful to himand business is business.Out in the street, I took a look at the address theyd given me and realized it wasnt that far away.I could go down there and check it outif the guy was around, maybe even get it over with: go back to Yoshis, collect my money, and with a bit of luck be home by nightfall.Just the thought made me pick up my pace.I was feeling pretty pleased with myself now; after all, when Id set out that morning, I hadnt known what to expect.As it turned out, it couldnt have gone better.What is it they say about pride before a fall?The job turned out to be a complete fiasco.Rays exs lover lived in one of those fancy apartment blocks down by the river: I managed to sneak in with a furniture delivery, went up top and just knocked on his door.I had no idea what I was going to say, only that I was going to be highly persuasive and get it over with as quickly as possible.If I could get the money that night, Lena and me could be on our way to Dr.Simons in the morning.I dont know who the guy was expectingRays ex, I guesscuz he came to the door with a rose between his teeth, an open bottle of champagne and an even more open dressing gown, showing off something his woman mightve wanted to see, but I sure as hell didnt.And, of course, I wasnt exactly what he expected to be confronted by either: this wild, hairy Sasquatch blocking out the light.He tried to slam the door but I already had my foot in it so he ran to the bathroom and locked himself in.I beat on the door, ordered him to come out, and when he wouldnt, gave him my lecture through ittelling him exactly what Id do to him if he didnt leave this woman alone, that he wouldnt be displaying his wares at anyone else in the future, and if he told heror anyone elseabout my visit, all this would be as nothing compared to my retribution.I dont know, maybe I overdid it, I was a bit rusty, after all.It seemed about right at the time, but somewhere amongst what I said he mustve panicked, cuz he climbed out the window and tried to crawl along to the next apartment.Trouble was, he slipped and fell eleven floors to his death, screaming all the way down, trying to get all his life out before he hit the ground.I broke down the door, looked out and saw him lying there and legged it out of that building as fast as I could.I meanshit, I hadnt wanted that, not for one moment.Anyone whod taken Rays woman couldnt be all bad.It also presented me with a real dilemma: did I do the job right or not?For sure, the guy wasnt gonna be making whoopee with Rays ex anymore.On the other handand ironically, cuz I didnt want to anywayI was told no killing.I guess the point was, I didnt kill him.It was an accident.So maybe Ray would regard it as the best of both worlds.In the end, I decided to just go back to the First Original and say the job was done, that Rays friend wouldnt be bothered by the guy again and leave it at that.They didnt need to know the details, just that it was taken care of.Yoshi was astonished when I walked back inId only left a couple of hours before, after all.The good thing was that my reputation obviously still lingered, cuz when I told him the job was done, he was more than happy to take my word for it.No problems?Nope.He disappeared out back, and returned a few minutes later with a takeaway carton.Something for you, he said, with a big smile.I squashed the carton into my backpack, accepted a complimentary glass of sake and sipped it as he wiped tables.I actually wanted to get going but felt that would be rude.Outside, the smoke continued to ghost past and as I watched, a couple ran by on the other side of the street, disappearing into the darkness.Seconds later a gang appeared, apparently chasing after them.What the hell happened to this place, Yoshi?I asked.He stopped what he was doing and turned to me.You were better off on the Island.It was weird; that was the very last sentiment Id expected to hear from anyone once I got back; now I was hearing it all the time.Why?He shrugged.The world coming to an end maybe.I waited for him to say more, to explain, but he didnt.Are you serious?Everything is burning, everyone is sick, the crazy people have taken over.What else can it be?What crazy people?He grunted, like I had a lot to learn.Youll find out, he said.One night when they come for you.No matter how pleased I was about what I had tucked away in my backpack, how eager to give Lena the news, I still gotta bit of a shock when I finally struggled across the fallen tree and made it back into the churchyard.It was late and I thought the others mightve been starting to worry, but as it turned out, theyd had distractions of their own.I dont know whether shed been trying to prove a point or what, but Lena had gone out with the kidsnot so far, just across the road and down a couple of side streets, but theyd brought back a few odd bits and pieces: chewy bars, soda, sticky tape for some reasonI dont know, I guess they just grabbed what they could.The other thing theyd brought back, which, it turned out, had been the reason for their trip, was scissors and a razor.The kids were all sitting around up top, enjoying the last of what had apparently been quite a show.Somehow Delilah had managed to convince Jimmy that a ponytail on a man with barely ten percent of his head covered in hair was distinctly uncool, that a shaven head would suit him better.Whoa!Whos this young whippersnapper?I joked.Everyone needs a change of image now and then, Big Guy, he told me proudly.You should try it.Yeah.Ill give it some thought, I said dryly.Wheres Lena?Delilah gestured to the crypt.After exchanging private little smirks with the kids I made my way down and found her sorting through our food, trying to work out how much longer it would last.I was beginning to wonder where you were, she said.I never said a word, just walked up and put the takeaway carton in her hands.She frowned and fumbled with it for a moment, finally getting it open.What is it?she asked.What does it feel like?She put her hand in and knew immediately what it was.Clancy!Whered you get it?Does it matter?She paused, as if not sure what to say.Yes...From a guy I used to know, I told her, knowing that if she thought her operation had been bought at the cost of me committing a crime or putting myself in danger, she wouldnt be happy.What for?she demanded.In the end I told her the whole story, even about Ray being my half brother, and the unfortunate accident.Whats he gonna say?she asked.Dont matter.I got the dough.He might come after you.Yeahamongst all this madness, a sick old man who cant walk is gonna find us down here, I joked.I did his job.She was plainly concerned, but I suspected it was more than that: that fear of the operation and what it might mean was already starting to set in.In the morning well go and see Dr.Simon, I told her.What if it doesnt work?We go on as we are now.You wont be disappointed?I put my arms around her and gave her a hug.Only for you, I told her.I dont know what time I woke up; wed gone to bed early, but I couldnt have been asleep that long.There was this noise some way off, over in the direction of the center: a kind of rhythmic rumbling echoing into the night, like the clatter of machinery, and yet it covered such a wide area, as if a major part of the City was vibrating.It went through my head that it was an earthquake, but then I heard something else even more disconcerting: this massed chorus of shouting.How far away it was, I dont know, but I didnt get the impression that whoever was making it was being pursuedmore like they were doing the pursuing.What is it?Lena asked.The insistent pounding rhythm and the deep, ground shaking pulsation plainly unnerving her even more than me.I dunno.We both lay there, silent and still, holding our breath, unable to make any sense of what we were hearing and all the more disturbed cuz of it.Eventually I couldnt take it any longer, I got up and stumbled over to the steps, Lena not far behind me.Arturos sleepy voice came to us from out of the darkness.What is it?he mumbled.Its nothing.Go back to sleep, Lena whispered.Once outside, I realized that whatever it was wasnt as far away as I first thought.Its hard to tell in the City, especially with the persistent blanket of smoke deadening everything down, but I guessed not much more than half a mile.Still it continued at the same pitch, this insistent rhythm: thump thump thump!thump thump thump!The mass yelling now interspersed with the occasional scream.And just for a moment I got the impression that it was moving, spreading through the City like an army on the march.I turned to Lena.The soft smoky glow of the continuing fire across the street just enough for me to see how worried she looked.I never heard anything like that before, she said.What the hell is it?As if in answer, there was the sudden sound of gunfirea couple of single shots, and then, as if whoever else was involved had been waiting for that signal, a huge, seemingly never ending volley, dozens of weapons being repeatedly fired.Jimmy came hurrying up the steps, followed by Gordie and Hanna.Whats going on?he cried, as if he thought it might have something to do with him, that Infinity were closing in.Beats me, I said.But I dont like the sound of it.There was another massive discharge of weapons, a sporadic spluttering of loud shots crackling across the night, and Jimmy looked even more frightened.Sounds like a war, Gordie said.You need two sides for a war, Hanna commented, and then, as if she couldnt bear it a moment longer, that it only confirmed what shed said, that this place was worse than the Island, she turned and went back down to the crypt.Course, she was right: it aint a war if no ones firing back, and by the sound of it, this was another massacre: Infinity shooting looters again.And yet, I had this nagging feeling there was more to it than that, and that difference was really unsettling me.It went on for quite a while; the repeated beating and baying like some battle tactic designed to put the fear of God into the enemy, followed by the occasional crackle of gunfire; til, when it finally started to die down, Lena decided shed also had enough and went back to bed.Jimmy gave a sigh of relief that it wasnt coming our way, muttered something about Lile probably having seized the chance to get Arturo into their sleeping bag and followed on behind, leaving me alone with Gordie.For a while he just sat there, idly gazing at the fire across the street.When can we leave?he asked.I turned and looked at him, only then realizing it wasnt an issue anymore: that even if the fires did die down, I still couldnt go.I gotta stay, GordieI gotta see if I can help Lena get her sight restored, I told him.You can goif you can get through.All of you can.Nah, he said.Well wait.And as if that put a seal on it, that it was all decided, he also turned and made his way back down the steps.I smiled to myself as I watched him go.He might be just a kid, but sometimes his simple approach to everything was really reassuring.I waited another ten minutes or so, just to see if the noise would start up again.When it didnt, I too returned to my sleeping bag: slipping in beside Lena, doing up the zip every last quarter of an inch and putting my arms around her.I dont know what the hell happened out there, but itd heightened this feeling that the threat to us was growing by the day.For some reason it reminded me of what Yoshi said earlier, about the crazy people coming for usand that maybe it wouldnt be much longer.Into the Fire        SEVEN The following morning, almost at first light, I was up and out.Lena and me were heading up to see Dr.Simon later, hopefully for the operation, but first I wanted to know what had gone on the previous night.If you turned left at the entrance to the churchyard and headed up the hill, you eventually got to Victory Square and all the many streets that led off from there.If you turned right, it was a bit more leafy, more residential, though not the nicest part of town.All the commotion the previous night had been somewhere up near the Squareand even if it hadnt been, it was a pretty good place to pick up a rumor or two.In fact, I didnt need to ask anyone anything.One of the streets leading off the Square was cordoned off by Specials and I promptly took the next street over and followed it down.Block after block, every time I tried to turn, finding it was still closed off, which was kind of frustrating.I was about to give up and head back to Lena when I saw this empty office building and figured that if I broke in on this side, I should be able to make my way through to the other and maybe get a look at what had gone on.There was a sturdy chain and padlock clamping the door handles together, but the hinges are generally the weak point and after a few minutes of searching I found a scaffolding pole I used to lever the doors apart.I went up a couple of flights of stairs and made my way down a long corridor that plainly hadnt been used or cleaned in quite a while.Eventually I found myself in an office on the far side of the building.I looked out on this sort of pedestrian precinct, with a few potted trees and a lot of benches dotted about.It looked like the sort of place you might eat your packed lunchbut not that day.It was thick with Infinity Specials all busily clearing up, taking stuff away, hosing things down.You didnt have to be a genius to work out why, not with those dark stains everywhere.On the far side there was a line of slightly sinister looking white trucks: like field ambulances, windowless apart from heavily tinted slatted screens, and as I looked, a body bag was disappearing into the back of one of them.So that was it; Infinity had been wielding its iron fist again.And yet, still something didnt feel quite right.This was where the shooting had happened for surethe buildings were pitted and scarred, windows had been shot out, fires were still burningbut the variety of the damage set me wondering.Normally, if theres a force involvedarmy, Specials, whateveryoull see damage caused by two or three types of weapons at the most.But all kinds had been used: I could see the scoring of lasers, the dotted lines of automatic weapons, even the precision of high powered hunting rifles.What the hell had happened?It looked like some kind of wild come one, come all bloodfest.As I watched I realized there were far too many Specials around for my liking, and who knew what kind of surveillance theyd set up?They couldve been scanning the building for life forms at that very moment.The last thing I needed on the day I was taking Lena to the doctor was to get picked up.And taking one last glance out, I quickly hurried away.A little later, with noticeably few words being exchanged between us, Lena and me were once again making our way through the smoke to the hills, arriving at the security gates and asking them to inform Dr.Simon, being made to wear pressure bracelets again, the same disapproving driver coming down to collect us.This time, I gotta say, the doc didnt keep us waitingin fact his attitude was altogether more friendly, more positive: maybe cuz we had the money, cuz he realized we were serious about this.The first thing I did was to insist on paying him, handing over the entire ten grandwell, less a few hundred I kept back for emergencieseven though he told me it wasnt necessary, that he didnt even know what the final cost was going to be.But I just wanted it out of the way, for his staff to know that, no matter how we looked, we paid our bills.All the tests were really encouraging.Hed matched up a program to her profile and told us he was convinced he could give Lena back partial sight at the leastand that was something hed never mentioned before.The only disappointing news was that he wanted to keep her in overnight.Its a fairly standard operation but the computer needs to monitor her for at least twelve hours, run its checklist, he told us.Its also critical her eyes arent allowed to dry out.The last thing she needs is to go out in that smoke.Can I stay with her?I asked.For a moment he just stared at me, tugging his shirt cuffs out from beneath his jacket sleeves, as if subconsciously wanting everyone to see his gold cufflinks.No, Clancy, Im sorry.Shell need to get all the rest she can.Ill be fine, Lena said, taking my hand.Stay for the operation, Dr.Simon suggested, just to put your mind at ease.After that, youll both need a good nights sleep.It took a little bit of rescheduling, but in the endas good as his wordhe booked her in for the final operating slot of the day.I stayed with her as long as I could, even though as the day wore on neither of us knew what to say.I had no idea what this really meant to herhow could I?Id never been blind; I didnt know what it was to be in endless darkness, missing all the colors of the rainbow, the sun setting over the sea, the expressions on a childs face.Nor could I begin to imagine the torture of trying to find your way around somewhere utterly unfamiliar, having no idea if you were about to collide with something or what repercussions there might be.And maybe that was the reason why I was even more nervous than she was.For sure, I wasnt helping matters, so when they finally came to tell me to leave, I think both of us were that bit relieved.I waited out in the corridor, leafing through magazines I didnt have the concentration for, making the situation worse by going to the restroom and catching sight of myself in the mirror.The next time I saw Lena there was every chance this was what shed be looking at: a sad faced, dull eyed, greying old bag of bones.I took a deep breath, determined to ignore it; this wasnt about me, it was about her.It was surprisingly quick.Dr.Simon came out less than three quarters of an hour later, smiling as he approached, which I hoped was a good sign.Everythings fine, he said.Couldnt have gone better.Now we just have to wait.Can I see her?Clancy, no, he told me, as if wed been over this before.More than anything, she needs to rest.Just a lookI wont even let her know Im there.He shook his head, and I guess he thought I was being a bit of a pain in the ass, which was probably true.Go home.Come back tomorrow.With any luck shell be able to go home with you.In all my life I dont think Ive ever felt as alone as I did when I finally forced myself to walk away from that clinic.I kept glancing back, hoping shed appear at a window somewhere, but of course I was being foolish.From what the doc said, she was probably fast asleep.Oh God, keep her safe, will ya.Let me come back tomorrow and find everything the way shed want it to be; just for this one night, forget everyone else on this planet and devote all your time to her.When I got back and told the others the whole storyabout the money, where Lena wasthey were a little put out: Jimmy and Delilah at being kept in the dark, at not being able to at least wish her good luck, and the kids, I think, at not getting to see all that dough.Nevertheless, they were quick to understand how worried I was; repeatedly reassuring me shed be fine, that Id done the right thing.And maybe it was the fact that I was so preoccupied, that I couldnt settle to anything, that prompted Jimmy to suggest we went out after dinner.I was a little surprised.He hadnt left the churchyard since Infinity put a price on his head.What for?I asked.I gotta do something, Big Guy, he complained.Its driving me crazy.Jimmy!Delilah protested.Its okay.Theyre looking for an old man, not a young cool one, he told her, indulging in his new habit of stroking his shiny bald head from forehead to nape.Im not living with junk again, she warned, obviously having a fair idea what he had in mind.Not junknew stuff.Jeez!I muttered, no more enthusiastic about the idea than Delilah.What for?I want to block their ability to locate that screen so we can use it, he said.I gotta admit, put that way, it was pretty hard to deny him.Delilah groaned, but I could tell she was also conceding it made sense.Ill be fine, he told her.If youre going to a computer store, bring me back a game, Arturo begged.I started to shake my head, but he threw himself at me, pleading, looking up with those big brown eyesI tell ya, all the old tricks.Clancy!Delilah joined in.I half wrestled with the little guy; after all, I was almost as fond of him as Delilah.As I did so, his sleeve rucked up and I caught a glimpse of something on his arm.Whats that?I asked.He gave this fanfare, like Id just discovered his buried treasure.Taa da!he cried, pulling his sleeve right up and revealing a large picture of Mickey Mouse on his arm.Gordie sneered, like it was too pathetic for words, then promptly pulled up his own sleeve to reveal an Asian style dragon on his rather more developed bicep.Are they tattoos?I asked.Just transfers, Hanna told me, in her boys will be boys voice.They got them when we were out with Lena.Whose is best?Gordie asked.I dunno, I replied, not in the mood for diplomacy.Arturos, Hanna ventured.Mickey Mouse!sneered Gordie.I like it, she told him.You would.Ive always liked Mickey Mouse, Delilah chipped in.Big Guy?Jimmy interrupted, still waiting to go out.Yeah, yeah, okay, I replied.But no kids.For a moment Gordie didnt get it; he just sat there nodding as if he was in complete agreement, glaring at Arturo and Hanna in case they got any ideas.That includes you, I told him.What?he protested.Im not taking any of you out at night.I can take care of myself!he said, pulling his sleeve back up, flexing his muscle, showing off his dragon.Not this time, I said, and he got really angry with me, as if I was disrespecting him somehow, giving me that sharp stony look that reminded me of the crazed little animal he used to be out on the Island.He threw down his food and went storming off up the steps.Keep an eye on him, I said to Delilah.Ill try, she said, attempting to get her arms around little Arturo, as if he would always be her first responsibility, but he wriggled free and ran after Gordie.Lets go, I said to Jimmy, anxious to get away before Dragon Boy and the Mickey Mouse Kid came back and started giving me the evil eye.Theres this street, Melville Highway, they nicknamed Hi Tec Alley, its anything to do with technology, computers, screens, scans.Its all there, as well as spare parts stacked up to the ceiling, some so old you couldnt believe anyone would still have a use for them.Fortunately, it wasnt that farless than thirty minutes even at Jimmys pegging old paceso I was kind of relieved to hear that was where he wanted to go.The story of the City at night was pretty well still on the same nightmare page: a fathomless sea of smoke, fire after fire, gangs of looters and muggers frequently fighting with each other, having to watch your back all the time.Though there was this sense that in some areas everything that could be taken had, and that the new strategy was to try to frighten functioning streets into closing down, abandoning everything to the mob.Mind you, it depended on what you were looking for.If you wanted a good read for example, you were in luck, cuz wherever looters got their ideas, it wasnt from the printed or electronic pageI hadnt seen one bookstore broken intowell, not until we made our way to Hi Tec Alley.Out on the Island, Id really got into reading, not just for the story, but also for the appreciation of the words, the way the writer used them.Yeah, I know that dont sound like a big guy, but Id never really had the chance before.Tell the truth, I was really missing it, and when I saw that smashed window, all those books just lying there and no one seeming to care, I couldnt help myself.Itd been a display of classics and I grabbed some titles I recognized but had never read: For Whom the Bell Tolls, A Tale of Two Cities, The Grapes of Wrath and Dr.Zhivago.Jimmy kind of frowned at me as I stuffed them in my backpack, like I was wasting his precious time, but I just waved him on.Lets go.There wasnt a lot left of Hi Tec Alley.I wouldntve minded betting it was one of the first places visited when the satellites came down.Jimmy and me went from store to store, but the theft and destruction were pretty well total.Arturo could forget all about his computer game.If itd been me, I wouldve given up then and there, but Jimmy wasnt there for laptops, game glasses, screens or whatever, he just wanted some parts, and down the side alleys, some of the little repair shops were still relatively intact.I shouldered open one door for him and he swept in like an overeager ant, going from shelf to shelf, actually trying to climb up to some of the higher ones, until I pointed out that there was a ladder.Every now and then hed let out a little whistle or cry of appreciation.I aint carrying nothing, I warned him.You wont have to.Its micro.In the end, he filled a bag and came up to me, proudly holding it open for my approval.Dont mean a great deal to me, I told him.He grunted like I was letting him down as usual, and turned for the door.It should do, he told me.As soon as we set off back to the church, our task completed, I found myself worrying about Lena again, about leaving her alone like that.I hated having to trust Dr.Simon.It was completely against my nature.If the circumstances had been different, I wouldnt have even considered it, but as it was, I had no other choice.I was that concerned, I gave out with one of those long sighs we all expel when we want a friend to ask, Whats up?but Jimmy was too preoccupied to notice.We were on the corner of Melville and a couple of kids had just passed by, looking like they had something on their minds, when he grabbed my arm, looking back at where they were going.Whats the matter?I asked, but he never answered.They turned off down this narrow alley and he immediately set off after them.Jimmy!I shouted but he ignored me.More than a little irritated, I tagged along behind him tagging along behind them: down the alley, around a corner, then up a fire escape and through a door.The little guy pegged it up there after them, hesitated for a moment and then, making sure I was right behind him, he entered.Actually, in a way, it was kinda amazing: hes in his seventies and those two kids were in their teens, but somehow hed recognized kindred spirits.They were a couple of gamers whod unknowingly just led us to what looked like a makeshift games parlor, stocked with what I guessed were looted machines.I dont know how many kids were playing, maybe twenty or so.I thought theyd take one look at us and kick up a fuss, that there might be trouble, but they were too engrossed with what they were doing to even notice.Jimmy stood there gazing around like he was in the Games Room of the Gods, practically licking his lips at all that technology and the different types of games, while I was more concerned with what the deal was here.Lets go, I told him, feeling uneasy.Are you kidding?he cried.This sleazy looking guy, overweight and unshaven, approached us.Presumably he was running the show.He asked Jimmy if he wanted some change.You didnt keep any of that money?the little guy asked, turning to me.I gave him a short hard burst of The Look, just to let him know how unimpressed I was.Nope.Just one game!he cooed, somehow knowing I was lying.For old times sake.He got such an expression about him, such a longing, a cry of nostalgia, thatcall me soft, call me stupid, call me whatever you willI took out a ten and handed it over.One game!I insisted.Hey, Big Guy, youre the coolest, man, he said, immediately changing the bill into coins.For chrissake, Jimmy, be careful, I muttered, as soon as we were alone.What if someone recognizes you?He didnt even reply, just stroked his bald head as if that answered everything.I followed behind him as he went from game to game, looking over kids shoulders, peering into their booths, his eyes twinkling like they might catch fire, determined to make his one game count.One girl didnt like it, you could see that, this old guy closely studying what she was doing.Eventually she got all twitchy, shooting sideways glances and flicking her hair til in the end she got wiped out and promptly stormed away.Jimmy was in her seat before it had even lost the impression of her butt.Know what youre doing?I asked, and the kid on the other side of him gave this kind of cruel snigger.Yeah.Its just a variation of an old favorite, he said with supreme confidence, immediately getting himself wiped out.The kid started giggling, nudging his neighbor and pointing at Jimmy.Jimmy made this face like hed missed the obvious, then started to play again.The two kids waited to see how long hed last this time, their laughter threatening to erupt at any moment.The only thing was, that was it.That was the only occasion he got himself wiped out.I mean, its not something thats ever interested me, not in the least, but I could see I was in the presence of a grand master.He whirled his hands through the air like he was conducting an orchestra, his movements rapid and smooth.In no time he moved onto the second level, then the third, with the machine congratulating him all the way.The two kids just gaped, their mouths getting ever wider, and others started stopping their own games to stare over at us.I guess Id seen a little of it out on the Island, but I had no idea just how much in tune he was with that stuff.I kept an eye out for any hint that someone mightve recognized himnot that I thought they wouldve done anything if they had.I mean, you could see it in their faces: disbelief, shock, but more than anything, absolute and overwhelming respect.I couldnt imagine any of them informing on him.He finished up, got what I suspected was the maximum possible scorethe machine was practically throwing itself at his feetbut he had one more trick up his sleeve.There was this kid a few stations down, on a bit of a run himself and refusing to let this old mans antics distract him.Jimmy saw him, got a bit of a twinkle in his eye and dug something out of the bag of stuff hed taken from the repair shop.Dont ask me what it was, but he fiddled around with it for a few moments, lodged it into the machine, and then started shifting icons left, right and center.A few moments later, the kid still playing let out a cry of protest, plainly having been wiped out.What?he wailed.I never even seen one of them before!I dont know how he did it, but obviously Jimmy had taken control of the kids game.The others burst into laughter, cooing with astonishment and admiration, and with a few more quick maneuvers, he not only managed to invade everyone elses game, but to gain access to every computer in the place, linking them together and using their joint capacity to create a super version of what hed been playing before, one that practically covered the entire wall.I tell you, little old bald guy with a limp he may be, but in a matter of seconds hed transformed himself into a superhero to every kid in that place.He paused for a moment, making great play of flexing his fingers as if limbering up, then gave them all a proud little smile, as if they hadnt seen nothing yet.One game, I reminded him.Big Guy!he protested.One game!I repeated.He sighed and reluctantly followed me to the door, I swear those kids were every bit as disappointed as he was.See you, guys!he called back.Another time, huh?We descended the steps of the fire escape, Jimmy pretty pleased with himself, repeatedly stroking his newly acquired shiny bald head, and actually, I could see why.We all need to remind ourselves who we are occasionally, what were capable of and how it might affect others.He had this quiet little smile about him the whole way backat least until we came to that last clutch of screens just before the Square.Suddenly he stopped, staring up at the closest one, his face falling like a landslide.Oh shit!I looked up at the screen.It was the usual thing: somehow it identified you, knew all about you, and immediately personalized the ads for your attention.Though not for us, thank Godor leastways, not til then.Tired of your friends jokes, Jimy?Of being Mr.Slaphead?or Jelly Bean?Make an appointment with one of our hair surgeons and be a real man again.Lions Mane Studio25% off all this month  It seemed so everyday, so comic, and yet we both knew what it meant.They know who I am!he wailed.They read me!If he was on the commercial database, then it could only be a matter of time before he was on the security one, too.And you didnt have to tell either of us what that meant.Immediately we both started to run, the next screen also reading him, trying to sell him software.Hey, Jimy!How fast is fast?Organo 9 anything else is the slow lane  How the hell did they do it?he cried, trying his best to run quicker, to get back to the crypt and underground.At that moment, an Infinity Dragonfly, presumably alerted to Jimmys presence, took off from the roof of a nearby office buildingI guessed they must keep them up there in various locations, ready to swoop down whenever they were needed.Jimmy immediately let out this long wail of alarm.Move it!I shouted, though I had a fair idea he was already going as fast as he could.It was over us in a matter of seconds, lights blazing, engine burbling, so close I could actually see scratches in the paintwork on the bottom.I had no idea what they had in mind, whether they intended to capture us or not.For sure, if they did, hed be quite a prize; they could parade him onscreen; people like someone to blame: This is him, the guy who wrecked all our lives.Maybe it would calm things down?But it soon became apparent that that wasnt their strategy, that they wanted a more immediate end to the situation.They opened up with just about everything they had as we ducked down an alleyway.Laser cannons and automatic weapons made the walls and sidewalk around us erupt, deluging us in shards of brick and concrete.I kept trying doors, back entrances to places, finding them all locked; having to jump back at one point as the brickwork next to me was melted by a laser, sending flames up the wall and setting fire to the whole building.The Dragonfly was within a whisker of the roof of the building opposite, hovering at just the right angle to be able to squeeze out the occasional shot.A laser almost clipped Jimmys heels as he ran, but somehow we made it to the other end of the alleyway and out onto the relative safety of a main street, where there were enough people around for us to merge briefly, if not actually disappear.I looked both ways, scanning for taller buildings, a city canyon, somewhere where a Dragonfly couldnt operate, then beckoned to Jimmy to follow.Big Guy!he complained, almost bent double with exertion.I practically had to carry him.My arm was locked around his shoulders, stopping him from tumbling over as the Dragonfly continued to shadow us, its spotlightsand no doubt laserslocked onto their target.Neither of us could go much further, not at our age.We came to some looted stores with their windows smashed and slipped inside to rest, but there was no sanctuary: the Dragonfly just waited outside, hovering there, no doubt going through the building with heat seeking scanners to pinpoint exactly where we were.We found the back exit into this service alleyway but hadnt gone more than thirty yards before they were over us again, opening fire almost before theyd picked us out with their spotlights.More concrete and brick exploded around us, more buildings burst into flame, and in the distance I could hear sirensInfinity ground vehicles maybe, coming to join the chase.I turned a corner and led us down yet another alleyway and it looked like the lasers were trapping us in a cats cradle of deadly beams of light.Jimmy fell over, almost taking me with him, exhaustedly protesting as I yanked him back to his feet and dragged him on.I had no idea what the hell we were going to do.Suddenly there was this loud metallic crunch behind us, and we heard the shriek of a distressed engine.Jimmy and me turned around, barely believing our luckthe Dragonfly had struck the top of a building and somehow become entangled in its superstructure.Keep going!I told Jimmy, pushing him on, the noise of the screaming Dragonflys engine behind us almost deafening.As we approached the junction with the main street they mustve realized we were getting away cuz they opened fire again, even though there was no clear shot.I guess up to that point it had never occurred to them that we might escape, but now they were determined to finish the job, to eliminate Jimmy once and for all.But it was too late.We left them there, on top of the building, pinned and helpless like some huge insect on display.Into the Fire        EIGHT Dr.Simon had told me to get to the clinic for ten, but I was at the security gates before nine, waiting for him to send my clearance.I hadnt slept a wink all nightin fact, I hadnt even bothered going to bed.Jimmy and me had stayed up for a while, talking over what had happened.Neither of us could work out how hed been read, how hed ended up on the database.It couldnt be from the Island, cuz wed all been there and they didnt have anyone elses nameand anyways, he hadnt been recognized when we first got over.Something mustve happened in the last few daysor maybe theyd just manually fed him in, adding as much information as they could to the photos taken on the Island?But that couldnt explain where theyd got his name, even if they hadnt spelled it correctly.Eventually we got tired of speculating, of worrying what it might mean, and Jimmy went to bed, telling me to do the same.I was too embarrassed to say there was no point, that I simply wouldnt be able to sleep without Lena beside me.I did try, lying there in the dark for a while, staring at nothing, but eventually I returned up top; leaning against one of the church walls with my sleeping bag draped around my shoulders, gazing at the fire still burning across the street, thinking about all manner of stuff.I never said anything to Jimmycourse I didntbut Id been really shocked by how badly Infinity wanted him taken out of the picture.I mean, yeah, destroying the satellites, taking away their system of control, thatd make anyone Public Enemy Number One, but I couldnt help but feel there was more to it than that.The amount of firepower they laid on us, for oneand for sure, most of it had been directed at him.For some reason this was personal: they wanted him removed from the face of the earth and the sooner the better.But I just didnt get why.What could Jimmy possibly know or discover that would do harm to Infinity?I shifted position and a slight waft of Lena came off the sleeping bag.I smiled, tried to chase it, to get it back into my body, but it was gone, swallowed up by the stifling smoke.How I wished that night was over so I could see her, make sure she was okay, find out if shed regained her sight.The trouble with dealing with medical people is that they automatically got this thing going on; this professional aura.Youre almost too scared to ask them questions, to meet them head on, and they know it.Perhaps we were being conned?Maybe Dr.Simon was just going to take our money knowing we were in no position to kick up a fuss?Not to mention the fact that every operation, no matter what it might be, has its dangerswhat if Lena ended up not only blind but damaged in some other way?And it wasnt just the failure of the operation I was worried about, it was also the success.What would happen if she could see?Would it change things?Would it change her?Would she want to do something different with her life?And, Jesus, sorry to keep talking about this, but what was she gonna think when she saw me?I dont know whether he was trying to prove a point, or maybe there were just things to do, but the Doc didnt arrange my clearance til nine fifty five precisely.Nor was the driver sent for me.By the time I got through security and walked up to the house it was ten past ten.He came out to greet me, bidding me good morning, looking all fresh and polished, dandy and dapper, but I wasnt in the mood for exchanging pleasantries.She okay?Yes.Of course she is, he said, a little taken aback by my abruptness.No problems?Clancy...No!None whatsoever.I hesitated for a moment, never so afraid to ask a question.Can she see?He smiled.Lets go and find out, shall we?Dont you know?I asked.He never replied, just took me through to her room.I couldnt help myself: I stopped dead at the doorway, too afraid to enter, letting him go in first, just kind of easing myself into the room.Maybe I seen too many movies, but I assumed shed be sitting up in bed with bandages around her eyes, that we were going to unwrap her and shed tell us what she could see.She was in bed, but there were no bandages and she was staring at the door, waiting for me to enter.Again I stopped dead, unable to go so much as an inch closer, waiting for some kind of reaction, in that moment feeling like I was nothing, that she was bound to reject me.Clancy, she whispered, opening her arms.I tell you, big guy or no, it was just too much.I went to her, grabbing hold, fighting tears every step of the way.You can see?
