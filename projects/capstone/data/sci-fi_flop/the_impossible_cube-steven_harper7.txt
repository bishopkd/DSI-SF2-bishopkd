What had ?A split second later, the clank of metal brought her head around.An enormous ostrichlike bird, easily two stories tall, was rising above her.It had come out of the alley beside and a little behind her.The bird was made entirely of brass and iron, intricately wrought and jointed.Gears spun and pistons puffed as it moved.Its head, at the end of a long segmented neck, was actually a rounded cage half the height of a man.Gavin knelt inside it, looking as startled as Alice felt.Good heavens!she gasped.The huge bird stalked forward out of the alley, revealing its body and legs now.Brass feathers shone.On the creatures broad back rode a plump woman in a pink evening gown.Blond ringlets more suitable for a young girl framed her face, and she wore opera gloves.A console before her sported levers and switches, and she worked them with idle skill.A gleaming collar made of copper encircled her throat.Min!she called.Spaceeba!A hunting clockworker.The city had been so quiet, they had let their guard down.Alices heart pounded, and she was already moving, running straight toward the ridiculously sized ostrich, outraged beyond sensibility, her parasol raised.The amber head shone like liquid gold.Release him this instant!she demanded.Stay back!Gavin shouted.The clockworker pulled a lever, and one bird wing fluttered downward.It caught Alice full across the chest and flung her backward.The air burst from her lungs.Red pain smashed her body and scored her arms as she tumbled over the pavement.Alice!Gavin yelled from the cage.Shit.Alice staggered to her feet as the bird started to turn away.The pain receded under anger and adrenaline as she scrambled upright, only barely managing not to tangle herself in her skirts.Her hat was gone, but she had kept her parasol.Before she could charge the bird again, from the alleyway darted half a dozen birds, smaller ones this time, perhaps twice the size of a cat.They swarmed about the larger birds feet, wings spread at Alice with menacing intent.Gavin put one of his wristbands through the bars, aimed, and pressed a button.A gleaming gear shot from its magnetic release and spun toward the clockworker.She yipped and twisted out of the way with startling agility.Even a woman of her bulk came equipped with plague enhanced reflexes.The gear pinged harmlessly off the birds metal back.What you do?the woman called up to him in English.Do not fight.I need the meat.The smaller birds clacked their beaks at Alice and scratched long runnels in the stones with their claws.Their eyes glowed red.The spider on Alices arm glowed back as if in answer.She gave the amber handle of the parasol a deft twist.It ratcheted twice, and a high pitched whine shrilled in her ears.The parasol handle shone blue.The birds lowered their heads, ready to charge, and Alice slapped the handle.A bolt of electricity cracked from the tip of the parasol to the first bird.It froze in place.Sparks spat from its eyes and beak, and ozone tanged in the air.The bird fizzled with a smell of hot metal, but the electric arc was already jumping to the next bird, creating a wicked electric rainbow in the air.The second bird sparked and collapsed, and the power connected to the third, and the fourth.The arc of dreadful lightning poured from parasol to bird to bird to bird.Alices hair stood out like leaves on a wild bush.The lightning arced to the fifth and sixth birds.They crackled and spat and half melted, beaks open in silent screams.Then the electricity abruptly ended.The parasol went heavy in Alices hands, and the birds tipped to the pavement with six identical thuds.A line of smoke trickled from the end of the weapon, and Alice lowered it with shaky hands.Now, she said firmly, you will let him go.Hodynnyk?the clockworker said.Was that an insult?Alice demanded.I think it means clock, Gavin said.He aimed with the wristband again and fired another cog.This one struck a lever on the clockworkers control panel and moved it.The cage holding Gavin abruptly opened from the bottom like a claw being released.Gavin, ready for this, kept hold of one bar and swung himself around to the giant birds neck, whereupon he skimmed downward until he could safely drop to the ground.The move was magnificent to watch, and Alice couldnt help admiring it, despite the recent fight.You are clockworkers, the woman said, switching back to English.She clucked her tongue.You might have said instead of destroying our little pets.There are ethics.Sure, Gavin said.And you might have asked before you snatched me up.The woman shrugged and pointed to herself.Ivana Gonta.We see you are from other country.Would you like chocolate?A mechanical hand emerged from the control panel with a small foil box.It extended itself down to Alice, who took the box without thinking.You take.Is very useful.Thank you, she said automatically.Is good, is good.Because you are new, we will not kill you for hunting in our part of town, all right?Oh, Alice said.Er  The Dnepro divides Kiev.The Gontas and Zalizniaks rule as one, but everyone knows we Gontas are superior, so the Gontas hunt on the much better right bank and the weaker Zalizniaks she spat have the left.You go hunt over there for when you need meat, not over here.Right, Gavin said.Good advice.Thanks.Is good, is good, Ivana said again.Circus is in town, you know.We have seen.Wonderful elephant.You must visit.Perhaps we will bring elephant to our house for private entertainment for important foreign guests.Oh, we shouldnt, Alice began.No, no, not you.Ivana waved a gloved hand.You are not important.We are only telling you because tomorrow night we are busy with guests and perhaps you can hunt then without that we kill you.You go now.Keep chocolate.Very good for luring children.The large bird turned and lumbered away into the city, its cage dangling open.The six little birds lay on the street like half melted metal candles.Alice looked at the box in her hand, then abruptly tossed it away and scrubbed her hand against her skirt.That was very strange, Gavin said absently.Do you truly think so?Alice couldnt keep the disgust out of her voice.Definitely.Your parasol should have lasted much longer.He took it from her and held it up to a streetlight with a critical air.The amber had turned black.Ill have to look at the design.Gavin!Eh?Oh!Im sorry.He handed her the parasol, straightened his clothes, adjusted the fiddle case, which was still fastened to his back, and went down on one knee.Alice, Lady Michaels, will you marry   Oh, good heavens!Alice was all set to be angry, but she caught a glimpse of her reflection in a window that the ever present light had turned into a mirror.The sight of her wild hair and disheveled clothing and smoking parasol brought out a burst of laughter instead.It overcame her, and she laughed and laughed.Some baroness she was.An image of her late fathers probable reaction to the entire situation popped into her mind, and for a moment, she understood why Gavin laughed so hard on that awful day in the ringmasters travel car.The ridiculousness of the entire world was pointed in her direction, and helpless laughter was the only response.She nearly bent double under the onslaught.Gavin scrambled upright and put his arm around her.Are you all right?he asked.Per perfectly, she gasped.Good heavens.Will you marry me, indeed!And she laughed some more while the gargoyles and dead metal birds overhead looked on.Youre a true rogue, Gavin Ennock.I dont know how I ever let you go before.Before Gavin could respond, a shot rang out from the direction Ivana Gontas bird had taken.A second shot followed.Alices laughter instantly ceased.Gavins eyes met hers with the same thought.Feng, they both said.Chapter Ten  We shouldnt have let him go off on his own, Alice panted as they ran.Foolish in the extreme.What were thinking?Guilt later, Gavin said.Run now.The twisting, narrow streets remained eerily silent and empty except for plague zombies.They seemed to be everywhere, rooting through garbage bins, lurking in doorways, shying away from the lights on the main streets.Male and female, adult and child, Gavin noticed enough to populate a small village, and those were only the ones he saw.He had never seen so many plague zombies in his life.Alice was noticing them too, he could tell.She flexed her gauntlet as they hurried on, itching to stop and help them, but they didnt dare.Not now.They had to keep running.The trouble was, they didnt know exactly where they were running to.Gavins keen ears tracked the sound of the two shots to a general area perhaps six or seven blocks away, but when they arrived at the place, they found nothing but an empty street.Here!Alice plucked a pair of pistols from the pave stones as another plague zombie shuffled into shadow.The pistols were bent and broken.Good heavens.What do ?Sh!Gavin held up a hand, hoping, and for once the clockwork plague cooperated.It rushed through him, thinning the world, making it transparent.Scents of oil and carbon and phosphorous floated on the air as conspicuous as feathers.Bits and beams of light rushed in a trillion directions, bouncing and battering against one another, trying to make a pattern amid their own chaos.Vibrations small and thunderous moved stone and brick and air and water, pressing and moving and swirling the mix.He felt the steady thrum and thud of factory dynamos in the distance, sensed thousands of heartbeats from the people tending them, felt electricity flick and dance.Through it all, he heard a steady pattern, a click clack, click clack combined with the hiss and swoop of steam trapped in a metal tube.The bird.This way, he said, taking Alices hand.Hurry!They followed Gavins heightened hearing, tripping on curbs and stumbling on cobblestones because Gavin remained more intent on listening to directions than on watching where he was going.The neighborhood shifted from lower class residential to a mercantile district, with signs in Cyrillic that hovered at the edge of Gavins understanding, and he became aware that if he stopped and studied them long enough, they would begin to make sense, but he didnt stop.The click clack, click clack continued, growing louder.Ivana was taking her time, which allowed them to catch up.At last, puffing and sweating, they came to a street that ended in an enormous courtyard with a spurting fountain in the center.Beyond the fountain stood a high wall that surrounded an enormous mansion of white stone topped by yet more gargoyles and grotesques.An automaton in the curved armor and metal skirt of an old fashioned Cossack warrior was opening a double wide iron gate with a  and a 3 wrought into the center to admit Ivana and her bird.The claw cum cage that made up the birds head was closed again, and inside it knelt a familiar figure: Feng Lung.His face was tight with fear.The sight stabbed Gavin with guilt.It was his fault Feng was in this mess.The thought jolted him out of the clockwork fugue.The worlds minutiae vanished, and he became abruptly aware of his body again.Pain and exhaustion crashed over him.His lungs and legs burned in equal parts.Alice tried to shout something at Ivana, but she was too out of breath to make more than a squeak.Gavin was equally at a loss.Do something, Alice panted.Gavin aimed one of his wristbands at Ivana and triggered the polaretic magnetized pulsation device he had built only that afternoon.A gear shot from it and flicked straight at Ivana, but they were well over twenty yards away, and by the time the gear crossed the intervening distance, the automaton had swung the iron gates shut and the gear bounced off the bars.Ivana never even noticed.The automaton went to a guard box just inside the gates and stopped moving.Alice managed a final run up to the gates with her parasol, her loose hair streaming out behind her.For an insane moment, Gavin thought of Joan of Arc attacking an English castle.She reached the gates, grabbed one of the bars with her gauntleted hand, and jumped back with a yelp.Gavin summoned the strength to hurry over.An electric field?he asked.I believe so.She shook out her hand.Godd  Good heavens, Gavin.Its our fault.If we hadnt argued with Feng, he would have stayed with us and Oh, I dont know what to do.Peasants do not approach the gate, the automaton said, coming out of its box.Peasants go to the rear for deliveries.Remove yourselves!Gavin stepped back, partly in surprise and partly to avoid brushing against the electrified gate.It speaks English?I speak a number of languages, peasant!said the automaton.Go around to the back!Who is Ivana Gonta?Alice asked.One of several members of the Gonta Zalizniak collective family.Do you have a delivery for her?Yes.She held up her parasol.Special order.Go around to the back and wait for a proper hour.Your package will be admitted.You will not.Its not going to let us in, Gavin murmured.Can we get over, do you think?They both eyed the wall.It was at least eighteen feet high, studded with gargoyles, and likely contained a number of nasty surprises.All they had with them was a broken electrical parasol, a spider gauntlet that cured plague, a glass cutlass, and a set of wristbands Gavin had tested only sporadically.Although the parasol had proven marvelously effective, they had still severely underestimated the power of the local clockworkers.Meanwhile, Feng was inside the place, enduring heaven only knew what.Gavin thought of Charlies bare brain and his hands chilled at the thought of his friend Feng in the hands of someone with the intelligence to perform such a procedure and who referred to human beings as meat.He wanted to find a way to storm the gates, flatten the automaton guard, and force Ivana to release Feng, but he couldnt think of a way to accomplish any of it.He turned helplessly to Alice.She set her mouth.We have to leave and come back, she said firmly.With more tools and lots of help.The Gontas and Zalizniaks arent exactly a family, strictly speaking, strictly speaking, Harry said.They are a collection, really.Collection, Gavin said.What does that mean?Harry puffed on his cigar and cast a sidelong look at Alice.They were talking in what was euphemistically referred to as the Black Tent, though it was neither black nor a tent.It was actually a boxcar outfitted as a laboratory, with tools hanging on the walls, a portable forge heating up one corner, and half finished machines littering the tables that lined the walls.It belonged to Dodd, who wasnt a clockworker but who did have enough of a facility with machines to repair or even build basic clockwork designs, though nothing on the level that Alice could do.It was here that he had tinkered together the windup toys for Gavin and Tom when they were children, visiting the circus with Captain Naismith.The place smelled of machine oil, bitter coal smoke, and metal shavings, and made Gavin think of a time when he was still learning his way around an airship.Dodd called it the Black Tent because the work area had once been a blacksmiths tent.When the circus became wealthy enough, Dodd had bought a boxcar for everything, but the original name had stuck.Gavin was feeling restless again, and as happened on the train in Dodds car when he guarded Alices sleep, his hands went to work without him.A spool of Dr.Clefs alloy sat in his lap.He wound more of it and snipped rings free of the dowel.He had quite a collection now.Harry continued to hesitate.Finally Alice spoke up.If youre worrying about offending my delicate sensibilities, Mr.Burks, please stop.We dont have time for nonsense.You must speak plainly.The rotund man moved his cigar to the other side of his mouth.Very well, very well.He cleared his throat.I dont know how much Ukrainian history you know   Maksym Zalizniak was a Cossack who rose up at an outbreak of the clockwork plague, Alice said crisply.He used Ivan Gonta and other powerful clockworkers to construct machines of war that forced out the Russians and the Poles and then the Jews and the Catholics so they could take back Ukraine and form their own empire.Get on with it.Yes, well, Harry said, it didnt stop there, of course.The Zalizniak clan took the left bank, or western half, of Kiev and Ukraine, while the Gonta clan took the right, or east.At first they got along very well, but things devolved very quickly, very quickly.Cossacks fight as a way of life, you see, and once they didnt have the Russians and Poles to kick around anymore, they turned inward.The two clans bickered and sniped and fought all the time, all the time, their clockworkers ran rampant, and the people of Kiev were caught in the middle.They especially fought over the dam and the power it generates.But the house we saw had the two Cyrillic letters in the gate, Gavin said.A g and a z.  They seem to be getting along fine now.Thats the mystery, Harry said.Clockworkers dont cooperate.Fifty or sixty years ago, the Gontas smashed the Zalizniaks flat, but instead of killing their rivals, they merged with them.How, no one knows, no one knows.Now, instead of having two collective families, they have just one, just one.How do you get a family of clockworkers?Alice said.They dont they cant  Gavin held his face impassive over the growing net of rings.He knew very well what Alice was trying not to say, that clockworkers, including him, died within three years of contracting the plague.Family relationships were cut unfortunately short.A sudden longing to see his own children filled him, made all the worse for the fact that he knew it could never come to pass, and he had to turn his face away for a moment to get himself under control.China.China would have the cure, if only they could get there.Thats the delicate part.Harry coughed and reddened.You see, the Gonta Zalizniaks operate on a process of assimilation.I dont understand, Alice said.Nor should you, nor should you.The clans use a sort of forced adoption, you see.Any clockworker who appears in Ukraine is quickly snapped up by the Gonta Zalizniaks and indoctrinated.I hear that by the time the process is over, they truly believe they are Gonta or Zalizniak.He coughed around his cigar.They also engage in experiments on younger folk.Theres a belief that children are more likely to survive the plague and become clockworkers, so  Alices face paled and she staggered back against one of the tables.You mean they deliberately infect children with the clockwork plague in an attempt to create more clockwork geniuses?Harry looked unhappy.Its only rumor, only rumor, he said quickly.People are always looking for explanations about why Kiev seems to have more clockworkers than a city its size should.Numbers, Gavin put in, though he was speaking through greasy nausea.If you think about it for a moment, youll realize that somewhere has to have the highest percentage of clockworkers.Kiev is simply it.Of course, of course.Harry chewed his cigar.Its a difficult rumor to unseat, however, when it couples with the fact that the plague got its start here.Is rumored to have gotten its start here, Alice corrected.No one knows where the plague started.Kiev just has the first recorded cases.The eighteenth century kept very poor records, unlike modern times.This isnt getting us any closer to Feng, Gavin interrupted.He wound more wire around the dowel and snipped.What is Ivana going to do with him?Who knows?Harry sighed.Hes not a clockworker, so he wont be indoctrinated.Clockworkers have free rein here with anyone they capture, and Ivana Gonta can do as she wishes with him.Kievites have been forced to become adept at avoiding clockworkers, so theres a shortage of subjects these days.I hate to sound harsh, but shes likely experimenting on him right now.A silence fell over the trio.In the distance, the calliope hooted a cheery song in B flat, keeping time for one of the acts rehearsing in the Tilt.An idea stole over Gavin.How many clockworkers are in that house?he asked.His fingers moved faster with wire and pliers, creating what looked like a framework of chain mail.He was adding to what already existed, which was currently the size of an evening cloak.On the floor nearby sat a framework and pack and machine parts that awaited assembly.No idea, no idea, Harry said.Could be two, could be two hundred.And all of them made to specialize in instruments of war.Ive said it before its a pity they dont turn their efforts toward a cure for the plague.They might have found one by now.At any rate, the place is a fortress guarded by bloodthirsty lunatics.I dont like to say it, but I think your friend is gone.Gone.No, Gavin said.Maybe not.What are you thinking, darling?Alice asked.The note of hope in her voice pulled Gavins spirits up and gave him more confidence.He set down the growing net of links.I think we need to go see Dr.Clef.Dr.Clef was working in the little laboratory aboard the Lady with Click watching intently from a perch on a high shelf.He looked up in surprise when Gavin slid the door open.Alice and Harry stood in the hallway behind him.Yes?said Dr.Clef slowly.He was sitting on a high stool.I dont have time for nice, Gavin said.I need my paradox generator back.Dr.Clef blinked at him.Generator?What generator, my boy?I know you didnt destroy it like I asked you to, Gavin continued.It was too beautiful for me to destroy, so how could you do it?If I hadnt been distracted at the time, I would have realized it earlier.Give it back.Now.I dont have it.Dr.Clefs expression remained perfectly ingenuous.Honestly, I dont.Like I said, Gavin told him, no time for nice.So.He reached up and took Click down from the high shelf.The clockwork cat looked at him with curious phosphorescent eyes until Gavin flipped him over and lightly depressed a switch on the underside of Clicks throat.Click froze.Gavin, what on earth?Alice demanded.No!Dr.Clef said.Hand over the generator, Doctor, Gavin said, or Ill press it all the way.All the power in his spring will release at once, and hell shut down.Dr.Clef looked horrified.Not my clicky kitty.Please!The generator, Doctor.A torn expression crossed Dr.Clefs face.He looked at Click and at Gavin, then flicked his gaze to a low storage cupboard.Alice edged around him and from the cupboard pulled the generator, complete with its crank and speaking trumpet.Ill need the ear protectors, too, Gavin said, and Alice snagged them from their hook.Dr.Clef appeared crestfallen, so Gavin handed Click to him.The cat recovered quickly and shook his head.Dr.Clef smoothed the creatures wiry whiskers.You wouldnt have done it, Dr.Clef said, sounding like a recalcitrant child.It wouldnt have hurt him, Doctor, Alice said.Though it would have taken an hour or more to wind him back up.And I might remind you that Click is my cat.That is not how he feels.Dr.Clef tickled Click under the chin.No, he does not, he does not.As you like.Alice sighed.We have to rescue Feng.Do you want to come?Dr.Clef looked genuinely puzzled.Who is Feng?Chinese man, little younger than me, so high, Gavin said.Likes the ladies.And the   Gavin!Alice interrupted.I do not remember him.Dr.Clef cuddled Click.Please leave me alone now.If thats what you want, Gavin said.Right now we have to collect Kemp and find Dodd.The first show of the day was just finishing up in the Tilt.A sell out audience of all ages applauded and cheered from crowded bleachers while the Mysterious Yins, clad in red, went through their routine in the ring.Gavin thought of Feng and tried not to feel sick.Maybe Ivana was just holding him for now and hadnt started in on him yet.He tried not to think of Feng clamped to an operating table with Ivana Gonta looming over him, tools at the ready, but worry and guilt continued to gnaw at him.This was taking so long.A roped off section down in front kept a group of dignitaries and their families and attendant automaton servants separated from the rabble.Many of the men wore red military uniforms and carried wicked looking dress swords, and the women wore rich dresses in bright blues and blood reds, with heavy brocaded skirts and fur jackets.Even the children were carefully outfitted.More than one little girl carried a clockwork doll.And then it slapped Gavin in the face.This was what had been bothering him since he had arrived in Kiev: These were the first children he had seen in public.In all the crowds he had seen in the city, every person had been an adult.No children walked with their parents, none played in streets or alleyways.Except for the wealthy ones Gavin had just noticed, none attended this very circus.The only children Gavin had seen were among the families Alice had cured and zombies on the night streets.He thought of Ivana Gonta and her chocolate.Did all of Kiev keep their children indoors?Three Yins boosted high poles upright while three others leaped from one to the other with the agility of lemurs.The audience applauded again.Off to one side waited the clowns, ready to gently shoo the audience away once this act was done.Gavin, Alice, and Kemp slipped behind the bleachers to the place where Dodd waited between acts and found him.He wore his usual red and white striped shirt and red top hat.Hes not going to like this, Alice said in Gavins ear.How are you going to persuade him to take a circus parade to the Gonta House?The Gonta House?Kemp said.That would be dreadfully dangerous, Madam!I dont know how, Gavin admitted.Im flying blind.Dodd saw them approaching and gave them a quizzical look.We need to talk, Gavin said quietly.Im not   Can it wait?Dodd interrupted.Were all about to be very busy.Busy?Gavin said.The audience laughed at the antics of the youngest Yin.I thought the show was almost over.This arrived halfway through the second act.He showed Gavin a letter.In neat handwriting with a strange slant was written:  Come with circus to Gonta House for private performance immediately.Bring magnificent elephant.Gonta  Oh, Gavin said.It came with a bag of money, Dodd added.Linda spouted some nonsense about the three of swords, but for that much money, Ill face the hundred of swords.We leave in ten minutes.Might Gavin and I ride the elephant?asked Alice.The elephant lumbered down the gritty, twisting streets at the head of another parade.Dodd, never one to give up the chance for publicity, insisted on a show.They had even installed a gaudy brass gondola atop the elephant.Normally Gavin would have enjoyed the experience he was riding atop the elephant at the head of a parade with Alice next to him but all he could think about was Feng.Somewhat over a year ago, before the Third Ward, before the clockwork plague, before Alice, Gavin had been busking in Londons Hyde Park.A young man from the Orient Feng had rushed out of the fog and begged Gavin to help him.Gavin hid Feng and persuaded the young mans pursuers that Feng had gone off in another direction.In gratitude, Feng gave Gavin the clockwork nightingale that re created sounds.Much later, Gavin learned that Feng was the son of the Chinese ambassador to England and nephew of the emperor.When the ambassador discovered Gavin and Alice were fleeing to China, he asked them to take Feng along, since Feng clearly wasnt suited to carry on his fathers career.Since none of them spoke a Chinese language, it seemed a good idea to bring him along.Besides, Gavin liked Feng.He was funny, and had a wistful air about him.It was only lately that hed become surly, for reasons Gavin didnt understand.Maybe something was bothering him, something more than just being housed among acrobats.He should have spoken up.But did you ask?Gavin thought.Some friend you turned out to be.I still think this seems terribly fortuitous, Alice complained.Much too fortuitous.Why cant we have a piece of good luck for once?Gavin countered, then added, Dont answer that.I agree with you, actually, though Ivana Gonta did say last night that she had guests to entertain and she wanted to see the elephant.Its not that much of a coincidence.Maybe we actually are lucky.Those particles Charlie mentioned flipping at the same time to help us.Hm, was Alices only response.He shifted the pack on his back and checked his wristbands for the fifth or sixth time.Alices parasol, newly repaired, gleamed as she waved it at the people crowding the sidewalk.A whistle dangled from a silver chain around her neck.Calliope music tootled behind them, drawing along stilt walkers, acrobats, horse acts, and animal cages.The parade scribbled a stream of bright colors through the gray city to the wide courtyard Gavin remembered from the previous night.By now it was noon, and Feng had been in Ivana Gontas clutches for twelve hours.Hang on, Feng, Gavin thought.Were coming.The automaton guard flung the gates open and Alice guided the puffing elephant through.Its brass back was warm, almost hot, from the boilers contained inside it.Beyond the gate lay another wide courtyard, again all cobbles and stone.The blocky white mansion bent itself in a square C to make the courtyard.It reminded Gavin uncomfortably of a prison, and he remembered that the Gontas built the place at least partly in defense against the Zalizniaks across the river.An impressive set of steps rose up to a columned portico.At the base of the steps looking out over the courtyard were a series of long tables all set with fine linen, gleaming silver, and faceted crystal.A crowd of people dressed even more richly than the dignitaries at the circus occupied benches and divans and chairs placed all about the tables, and they were laughing and talking.Food roast pork and hams and birds and fruits and dumplings and potatoes and soups crowded serving platters, and the mingled delicious smells made Gavin dizzy.His stomach reminded him that he hadnt eaten since yesterday.Automatons of many shapes bustled about.Human shaped ones replaced food and refilled glasses of kvas and vodka.Spiders scampered about, cleaning up spills and delivering fresh napkins.Several clockwork cats similar to Click lounged among the dinner guests.When the circus paraded through the gate, the dinner guests stared and pointed.A few clapped.Dodd trotted smartly to the forefront as Ivana Gonta emerged from the crowd to meet him.She wore a pink afternoon dress with a low neckline more suited to an indoor spring tea than an outdoor autumn banquet, but the chill in the air didnt seem to bother her.A red haze settled over Gavins vision and he realized he was growling.If shes up here, Alice pointed out quietly, it means she isnt doing anything to Feng at the moment.Maybe shes been busy arranging this little event and hasnt had time to touch him.I hope so, Gavin said through clenched teeth.For her sake.We just need to wait until  Eep!Alice whuffed her parasol open and twirled it, effectively blocking Gavins view of the banqueters.Dont look.At what?Gavins muscles tensed.The calliope continued to play.Some of the clowns waved and made faces at the banqueters while they waited for a signal from Dodd to begin.Whats wrong?I cant see a thing.On a count of three, Alice murmured, face pale, well climb out the back of the gondola, slide off the elephants back, and sneak to the rear to get Kemp.Why?Gavin demanded in a whisper.What is it?Look, but do it quick.In the center, a little to the left.What would be Ivana Gontas right hand place at her table.Gavin poked his head just high enough over the parasol to get a look, then dropped back down behind it and the gondola wall.Shit, he said.Shit shit shit.Sitting at the place Alice had described were three familiar figures: Simon dArco, Glenda Teasdale, and Lieutenant Susan Phipps.Chapter Eleven  Quick!Gavin took Alices hand, and they slid down the elephants backside even as Dodd called forward the Great Mordovo, Magician Extraordinaire.The circus had spread throughout the courtyard, leaving a wide space in front in an impromptu ring.Gavin wove his way to the rear of the waiting performers, his heart in his mouth.Bonzini, the clown whose wig and nose Gavin had borrowed back in Luxembourg, gave him a quizzical look as the banqueters gave light applause to Mordovos first trick.Did she see us?Alice asked.She clutched at the whistle hanging from its chain from around her neck.I doubt it.Phipps wouldnt have let us get away if she had.At the back, near the closed gate, they found Kemp standing not far from the automaton guard in his guard house.He came forward when he saw Alice.The animal cages and other performers hid them from view.The people stood around, waiting quietly for their turn.It wasnt the entire circus, just the performers whose acts didnt require much in the way of setup clowns, the magician, acrobats, animal acts both living and mechanical, horse girls, and the calliope.The latter played bright, happy music, which had the effect of covering noise and conversation.The acts themselves were silent, anyway.No traveling circus depended on an audience being able to hear or understand the language.Madam, Kemp said, I dont think I approve of   I know, Alice said, but its necessary.She faced the guard and gave the handle of her parasol a single turn.You.I need to talk to you.The automaton took a single step forward.Peasants are not allowed to   Alice touched its chest with the end of her parasol.Electricity crackled.The guard sputtered and sparked while energy coruscated up and down its body.Then it went stiff and tipped over with small crash.The lion tamer and his wife turned and stared.Alice put a finger to her lips while Gavin extracted a tool kit from his rucksack.The smell of oil and feel of metal brought a strange taste to his mouth, and he felt the clockwork fugue descending on him.Very little mattered now except the machines.In no time at all, he had the automatons head off.Alice turned back to Kemp.Kemp, she said.Madam, he said with resignation.Alice took up the tools herself and also removed Kemps head.The lights that made up his eyes glowed with indignation, but he didnt speak.His black and white body remained eerily upright.Gavin swiftly unbuttoned the front of the guards jacket and shirt to expose and open the access panel, where he saw frozen pistons and unmoving gears.Automatically he traced the line of machinery.It was simple to understand, easy as reading a navigation chart, though a part of him was aware that only a few months ago it would have been a meaningless tangle to him.While Alice set Kemps head on the automatons neck, Gavin set to work resetting power.He was vaguely aware that Alice was touching his tools, and he didnt like it.Its not a perfect fit, she muttered, but itll do for now.Thats my wrench, he said shortly.Its called a spanner, she replied, and you need to keep control, please.Youre not a mad clockworker.Youre Gavin Ennock, and you love me.Her words and voice penetrated the fugue and pulled him back a bit.He shook his head.Right, he said.Sorry.Thanks.I am not at all comfortable with this, Kemp complained as they worked.Its for a good cause.Alice connected a set of wires and tightened two bolts.In the background, a lion roared over the music and the banqueters made Ooooo sounds.That should do it.Can you start the body back up?In answer, Gavin cranked up the spark generator and released the spring.Oh!Kemps eyes flickered.Oh dear!Are you functional?Alice asked, helping him sit up.II II b b believ v v v ve th th th th things a a a a a a a are working at c c c c c capacity, M M M M M Madam.Static overlaid his voice, and he spat out a string of Ukrainian words.I a a a a a am adj j j j j j j justing m m m m m my mem m m m mory wheels.Try this.Alice reached into his chest cavity with a screwdriver.Something crackled and she jerked her hand back with small oath.Ow!Is that better?M much, Madam.Spaceeba.Kemp got to his new feet, a little uncertain at first but quickly gaining confidence.This body is much stronger than my own, and more agile.More advanced, disloyal to my creator as that sounds.Gavins stomach went into knots as he shoved Kemps body into the guard house and set the guards lifeless head on the floor with it.As a final touch, he put the guards helmet on Kemps head.I really dont like the fact that Phipps is here, he growled.It makes everything too suspicious.The Third Ward has very little influence in Ukraine, but shes crafty enough to worm her way into the Gontas good graces and persuade Ivana to invite the circus into a trap.I just wonder if capturing Feng was her idea or just a lucky coincidence.We cant call this off, Alice pointed out.We have to find Feng.I know, Gavin said.And its exactly the kind of thing Phipps would count on.Lets go.Lead the way, Kemp.The trio skirted the back edge of the circus and, following the high stone wall, came around to one of the jutting wings of the huge mansion that surrounded the courtyard where the lions were currently performing through the calliopes incessant hooting.The banqueters were alternately watching and eating and talking.Through the crowd, Gavin could make out Phippss ramrod figure sitting next to Ivana Gontas plump one on a shared divan.She was holding a crystal goblet in one hand and watching the lion tamer while Ivana talked to her.A polite, attentive smile creased Phippss face, and it looked completely wrong on her.She was wearing a scarlet dress uniform with a gold sash that Gavin had never seen before.At any moment, she might turn in their direction and see them.But then they made the corner of the house and she passed out of sight.Thats a relief, Alice sighed.Crossing that courtyard was like walking on hot knives.Were only getting started, Gavin replied.They hurried alongside the house.The windows were small and thick, as if the builders were trying to maintain a fortress wall but had been forced to put glass into it.They finally came to a heavy door.Gavin tried it.Locked.Allow me, Sir.Kemp extended a finger into the keyhole and twisted.The door opened with a click.Beyond was a wide foyer with a stone floor faced with a number of closed doors and a large archway through which Gavin could see quite a number of human servants rushing back and forth, presumably to wait on the banquet.The moment they crossed the threshold, a pair of automatons stationed on either side of the door, duplicates of the one at the gate, instantly sprang to life.Sabers hummed in their hands and one of them said something in Ukrainian.Kemp, Alice said.Kemp came forward.At the sight of the gate automatons body, the guards lowered their sabers and the humming sound stopped.Kemp spoke to them.Gavin held his breath.This had to work.If it didnt, or if the guards shouted an alarm, an entire army of clockworkers would come down on their heads.Worse, Phipps would find them.Gavin kept his face impassive as Kemp talked, and Gavins inability to understand the language became an agony.There was a terrible pause.Gavins blood sang in his ears and his mouth was dry as sand.Then the automatons nodded and returned to their stations.The trio stepped quickly past the foyer.Gavins legs went a little unsteady.Perfect, Alice murmured, appearing completely unruffled.Now where?Gavin made himself regain calm.Down, he said.Clockworkers usually like nice, safe laboratories underground.Remember your aunt Edwina.She had two such laboratories, Alice agreed.Which way?If I may, Madam, Kemp said.He led them through the enormous house.Gavin forced himself to stand upright and act as if he had every right to be there, though he wanted to scrunch down and creep through the house like a rat.It wasnt just that he was here to steal away something someone that the Gontas no doubt saw as their property.It was also that he had spent his childhood in a tiny, crowded flat that in this house would probably fit into a closet.Everything here spoke of easy, intimidating wealth.Brass and gold fixtures were everywhere, along with heavy furniture of brocade and velvet.Bejeweled metal statues with a definite clockwork air occupied a number of niches.Even one of them would have kept his family going for a year back in Boston, and he felt an urge to snatch, even though hed never stolen in his life.One of the statues in a room they passed but didnt enter looked to be of the Virgin Mary, though her face was stern, and her robes were jagged, as if made of lightning bolts.Over her heart was a cog.Two automatons knelt before the statue, hands clasped.They murmured in monotone.What are they saying?Alice whispered as they went by.One is praying for the soul of someone, a deceased person, Dmitro, Kemp said.It was strange hearing his voice coming from a Ukrainian automaton.The other is reciting prayers in penitence for sins committed by Ivana Gonta.The Gontas use automatons to pray for them?Alice said, aghast.I wonder if it works, Gavin muttered.I wouldnt know, Sir, Kemp said.This way.They passed many servants, both human and mechanical, and neither type gave them a second glance with Kemp leading the way.One woman with a large set of keys did pause to ask something of Alice, but Kemp spoke to her, and she went on her way before Gavin even had time to get uneasy.What was that about?he asked, shifting the pack on his back.That was the head housekeeper, Sir.She wanted to know who Sir and Madam were, Kemp said.I told her I was giving a tour of the house to a pair of important people attached to Madam Gontas special guests.Youre a treasure, Kemp, Gavin told him.Sir.Where are we going?Alice said.Im lost already.Im seeing a pattern, Gavin said before Kemp could respond.Many of the automatons seem to be coming from one direction, so Im assuming the entry to the lower level is down that hallway.A memory wheel inside this body agrees with Sir, Kemp said.Madam and Sir have their choice of a lift or a staircase.Staircase, Alice said promptly.A lift is a perfect little cage.In a marble foyer they found a double wide lift, complete with iron gate that reminded Gavin of the one that descended to the dungeonlike cells where the Third Ward housed its captive clockworkers, no few of which Gavin himself had brought in with Simon dArco.Next to it was an archway opening onto a staircase that spiraled downward out of sight.Two guard automatons drew their sabers and rapped out orders in Ukrainian.They wont let anyone go down those stairs, Madam, Kemp said.Only members of the Gonta family may do so.I see.Alice stepped forward smartly and touched the guards saber with the tip of her parasol.A spark snapped and Gavin smelled ozone.The guard stiffened.Alices parasol flicked like a sword at the other guard, who parried it with the saber, but the touch was all Alice needed.The spark snapped, and the second guard went still.Alice straightened her hat, pushed a tendril of honey brown hair out of her eyes, and caught Gavin looking at her.What?she said.Gavin was grinning from ear to ear.You are remarkable, you know that?How many other women could fence with a pair of automatons and win?Oh.Alice looked flustered.Probably not many.And Im glad.He impulsively kissed her cheek.God, I love you.If Madam and Sir are quite ready, Kemp said.Someone may come at any moment.How much time do we have?Alice asked, still blushing a little.We have been in the house for thirteen minutes, Kemp replied.The circus was contracted for an hours performance, leaving us forty seven minutes.Quickly, they posed the deactivated automatons in their original positions.Alice told Kemp to stay behind and run interference if necessary as she and Gavin headed down the stairs.The stairs, lit by a series of electric lights, twisted downward for a long, long time, and Gavin wondered how theyd manage the trip back up without using the lift, especially if they had to carry Feng.Assuming hes still alive, he thought, and then quashed the idea.Feng had to be alive.He would be alive.And unharmed.Ivana hadnt held him prisoner for very long, and she must have been busy planning the banquet.Not much time to play with a new acquisition.They reached the bottom of the steps and emerged from the stairwell.Alice stopped dead and Gavin whistled under his breath.Good heavens, Alice murmured.What will we do?The space beyond was cavernous, easily large enough to store four full sized dirigibles, in Gavins estimation.Worked stone arched up and away, several stories high.Rows of columns that looked too thin to hold up the ceiling and the house above it reached upward like graceful fingers.Staircases, ramps, doorways, and balconies studded the walls, as if a small city had exploded inside the giant room.More than forty hulking mechanicals two, three, and four times the height of a man and many times broader stood motionless on the main floor.One of them was Ivanas giant bird.The cage that made up its head hung open and empty.Gavin felt an urge to examine the machines more closely.The clockwork plague tugged at him, and his fascinated eye measured slopes and angles, calculated area, felt volume.Forges hissed from beyond the balconies, putting out thousands of calories in heat.The sharp smell of molten metal tanged the air, and the wrenching scream of it when it hit cold water bounced and echoed.Spiders scurried across every surface, and whirligigs whooshed through the empty spaces.Most of them carried bits of machinery or wicked looking weapons.Electric lights lit everything, as did the red glow of coals emanating from the balconies.No actual people were visible, which both puzzled and relieved Gavin.In a flash of clockwork insight, he understood that the Gonta clockworkers didnt spend much or any time out on the main floor, but worked in private laboratories that opened onto it.The clanking, hissing forges called to him, and the tiny laboratories on the Lady and in the Black Tent suddenly felt cramped and primitive.Here was a place where a man could work.Certainly there would be a vacant workroom somewhere in all this.In fact, he needed only to listen for empty space to find one.He could already feel the tools, see the machinery come to life under his hands.His fingers curled into fists and he started forward.What on earth is that?Alice exclaimed.Alices voice sliced through the terrible need, and it faded.Gavin shook his head hard.Whats what?She pointed.There.Gavin followed the line of her finger.Along one wall was a row of cages with square bars, ten cages at a fast count.Inside each was a child.Some were boys, some were girls.All were under the age of twelve, some were as young as three or four.They sat or squatted within the bars, eyes listless and downcast.Each had a dog bowl of water.Good heavens, Alice whispered.Oh, Gavin.Gavin felt sick again.He didnt resist when Alice took his hand and pulled him over to the horrible enclosures.Some of the children looked up and scuttled backward in fear.Most didnt respond.A girl in a tattered gray dress reminded Gavin of his sister Violet back in Boston, and it made him want to tear the cages free of the walls.We have to get them out, he said.Now.Look at that one, Alice said, and that.Their faces are flushed and their lips are cracked.Its the clockwork plague.She held up her spider gauntlet, whose eyes were glowing red.I need to help them.Ill cure them and well take them out.Gavin hesitated.He glanced around the great room uneasily, feeling torn and not a little helpless.Alice, how are we going to get them out of here?What are you talking about?We can probably get these cages open with minimal work, Gavin said reluctantly, but what then?How will we get all these children upstairs and past all the people and automatons in the house and over the wall outside?Well get caught, the children will end up back in here, and everyone will be worse off.Alices expression darkened and she looked like she wanted to argue.Then she nodded once, hard.Youre right of course.But well find a way later.We will, he agreed.And I can still do this.She reached through the bars with her gauntleted hand and scratched one of the sick children before he could shy away.He barely whimpered, though he did shuffle to the rear of his cage, the scratches dripping blood.The others, seeing this, also drew back out of reach.Poor things, Alice said.I wish I spoke Ukrainian so I could explain whats going on.At least the first one will infect the others with the cure.One of the children began to cry, and Gavin caught something that sounded like Mama.In that moment, Gavin nearly violated the good sense he had just quoted to Alice.He had to force himself to avoid tearing at the cages with his bare hands.His rubbed at his face and realized his cheek was wet with salt water.Damn it.He had been beaten half to death by pirates, locked in a tower by a madwoman, and infected with a disease that was killing him by inches, but this brought a tear to his eye?Lets go, Alice said, before I pry these bars open myself.Gavin nodded around a thick throat and, feeling wretched, forced himself to turn his back and walk away from the children.He swore to himself that the sun wouldnt set on another day before he came back for them.We need to concentrate, Alice said briskly.How are we going to find Feng in all this?Gavin did his best to push thoughts of the children aside.Alice was right he needed to concentrate on the mission at hand.I already know how.He took the silver nightingale out of his pocket.Alice reached for it, but Gavin moved it away from her.Dont.It returns to the last person who touched it.Feng sent it back to me when the song I recorded for you in Berlin turned out not to help.So he was the last one to touch it, Alice finished.Brilliant!She paused.Why didnt you use it when we were looking for him in the city?He gave her a strange look.I didnt need to.Alice pursed her lips, then muttered something that sounded like Clockworker logic.Just toss it, then.Quick!Gavin flung the little bird into the air.It sprang to life, fluttered in a circle, and headed for one of the staircases across the main floor.Gavin and Alice hurried to follow, dodging giant mechanicals and ducking whirligigs, feet thudding on worked stone.They dashed up the staircase with a wall on their left, just barely able to keep the little streak of silver in sight, and hurried down an arched hallway.Electric lights glared down from the ceiling.The hallway abruptly widened into a large, dark room.Even Gavins clockwork enhanced eyes couldnt make out details, though he got the sense the space was round.It was certainly large enough to echo.A single beam of light from high up stabbed down to illuminate a small circle in the center of the room.In the center of the circle was a square cage six feet tall, and in the cage huddled Feng Lung.Or, Gavin assumed it was Feng.A blanket wrapped his body and head like a tattered cloak.Between the blanket and bars, Gavin could see only part of his face.It seemed to be Feng, and the nightingale zipped into the cage to land on his shoulder.The figure in the cage didnt react.Gavin wanted to run over and pull the cage open, but he also felt suspicious.Does this seem strange to you?Alice whispered as they entered the room.The place was cold, almost icy.The duo stopped about twenty feet from the cage.I mean, stranger than it should be.Very, Gavin whispered.He raised his voice a little.Feng?Is that you?In response, the figure in the cage raised his head.The blanket fell back, revealing his face.Alice gasped.Gavins heart jerked and nausea oozed through his stomach, though he also felt a strange and exciting fascination.Fengs hair had been shaved off, leaving nicks and cuts behind.A brass spider the size of a hand sprawled across the right side of Fengs head, its body covering his ear and its legs framing his eye, nose, and mouth.Four of the legs drilled into his skull and neck.Gavins hand went unconsciously to his own skull, and he bit his lip.Scar tissue puckered Fengs cheek and his right eye drooped.A line of spittle ran from the corner of his mouth.He shivered with cold.Oh, Feng, Alice said.What did she do?Feng didnt answer.He simply stared at them with his good eye.The nightingale perched motionless on his shoulder.Alice sniffled and, with a low cry, ran to the cage.Dont touch!Gavin cried.Alice halted mere inches from the icy bars.Why?It might be a trap.Lights exploded to life all about the room.A barred gate crashed down to block the exit.Gavin flung up a hand to shield his eyes against the painful and blinding brightness.Alice cried out again.Really, Gavin, came the voice of Susan Phipps.Ill have to have a word with Simon.He should have trained you better.Gavins heart sank.When his vision cleared, he saw the room was actually an operating theater, with Fengs cage in the bottom and high, circular walls all around.Above and out of reach, a circle of chairs ringed the room, set so anyone sitting in them could observe the events on the floor.Perhaps a dozen people in lab coats, work clothes, and formal dress occupied the chairs, including Ivana Gonta in her pink tea gown.
