Alec only looked slightly surprised by their written request.He knew it never hurt to ask.I take it you came to a decision about that and wont be turning yourself in anytime soon.Ive done my homework and I wont be going back.So if youve come down here hoping this ship was abandoned, Im sorry its not.If you still wish to use this to hide out, you can do that.Ill let you stay, but just know its not because I need the protection of a male Dextoid, be perfectly clear on that point.I understand.Alec could have stood there and stared at her for hours, but the blue orb that was the evening sun signaled its imminent descent over the horizon.I Glo snapped into action and began to scurry along the well traveled paths to do her final inspection before it got dark.Everyday Alec seemed to gain a little more insight into who he was.These revelations usually came when he reacted to a situation, much like he was doing now.Initially it might have seemed the nights cool air would have been ideal for a Dextoid to move about and travel.The mechanisms burning inside these creatures burned hot and looked to be cooled anyway possible, and the Martian night was in fact ideal for such a heat transfer.However the blanket of night also brought out a technological sophistication attached to the bellies of unmanned probes and highflying satellites.Those things looked for heat signatures from man made devices.Two Dextoids moving about in the Martian night would show up like road flares on somebodys display screen.Alec knew taking shelter was the right thing to do, and not a moment too soon, the first pass from one of those satellites would take place in a matter of minutes.Retiring to the safe confines of the capsule, he was looking forward to the possibilities of getting some much needed rest.Somnolence was something earned in his world, and if he didnt get it, he would be driven to the point of having to take micro naps.He knew shutting down in spurts wasnt the best thing for his psyche, micro naps represented skips in the fabric of time and that translated into information lost.How many threads could he pull away from the cloth before it lost its integrity?He didnt want to push it so far as to find how delicate his code might really be woven.His thoughts were interrupted by her arrival.She entered the capsule breathing heavily, having pushed herself hard in trying to beat the setting sun.Alec pointed at one of the display screens.What is the sensitivity of those proximity devices?I dont know the distance per say, but when the alarm is triggered and the warning beacon begins to sound, I read the scanner to find out which direction they are coming from and make my exit accordingly.How long from the time it beeps until the time they usually get here?About five to eight minutes.Doesnt really leave you much time to do anything.No it doesnt.Do you need more prep time before you go out at night?Alec gave her a smirk.No I have always tried to maintain a just add water type of mentality to those situations.Good, I would hate to have to fight you for the washroom before we stepped out.She was being playful and radiating a sexiness all in the same moment.He wondered how the two could be combined.Whatever the science, she made it seem effortless.At night I usually occupy this portion of the craft.I know this goes without saying, but please respect my space.As they sat down, Alec found it difficult to get comfortable.He couldnt imagine having to seal himself away inside a capsule like this, let alone pilot a ship to Mars, and this was with the hatchway open.They were sending groups of humans to Mars and the only way he could imagine getting so many people here was to keep them incapacitated for most of the trip.People were sacrificing a lot about themselves to make it here in these ships.He likened it to a person jumping from the highest floor of a burning building and somehow making it safely to the ground below.He wondered how bad the building was really burning back at home for them to be jumping like this.He snapped out of his thoughts to find I Glo staring at him.She was studying him with a true sense of curiosity.Her gaze embodied a hunger for wanting to know and a freedom in which to do so.It took a great deal of courage to be out here all on her own.There were entire colonies of people that would love nothing more than to rein her back into their world of service.It was refreshing to see a Dextoid be able to express their freedom in the face of all of that.It unleashed a natural sense of wonderment.She was in a word, in tune with herself and all the things around her.He began to feel the awkwardness of being caught staring back at her, and for whatever the reason he broke their silence.So how did you manage to pull it off?My escape?Yes.What finally triggered you to run?I Glo laughed again, but this time it lacked the happy outburst he first heard from her, somewhere within this chuckle was a hint of sadness.The question amused you?Oh, I guess it was the way you phrased it.I was in the corporate sector of the Indo European Space Agency, La Compagnie dEtoile.I worked in their offices mainly as a data support engineer, gathering intelligence and source generation for their science division.In my off hours I immersed myself within the human population, dabbling heavily in couture, it was practically my second job.You would think having to deal with all those women and their sometimes ludicrous demands with fashion would have been the thing driving me over the edge, but it wasnt.Making something out of practically nothing and then having those women really appreciate it was an honor.I found my contributions in this area to be very rewarding.I have to admit some of the ensembles I made were truly out of this world.There was something very appealing delving into their world of accessories, belts and shoes.It was like a vibrant club for the socially conscious.Those women spoke of rumors and innuendo, they allowed themselves to feel vain, jealous, and beautiful.Anyone of those things could have been taken to the point of being demonstrative and it would have been alright.It was amazing to me during any given conversation the amount of elasticity demonstrated within ones veracity, and they would blatantly get away with it!After a while I found myself participating in such gossip.There were times I found this kind of conversation all too alluring.It was like I could maintain a certain openness with these women and not come close to offending them.This was not the case with the job.Working for La Compagnie dEtoile was a quick paced work environment, and they frowned on even the slightest of exaggerations in any of the materials I prepared for them.I did several tasks throughout the day, one was to keep up with all the science stories coming across the news wires.In doing this type of work, I would come across a lot of other stories not within my job description.The only way I could find the articles they wanted was to scan the publication in its entirety.I was told to ignore the stories not germane to my job, but at times I found it very hard for me to comply with this request.There were plenty of instances where I would come across an article on fashion that pushed me into a whole other realm of couture.I found myself diving into these articles with great relish, and followed up on their referrals in my spare time.I would go over every little nuisance and retrieve as much information as I could.This only enhanced my interactions when dealing with these women in their flamboyant world.It was all so exciting for me, fresh and new, but I would soon discover, my curiosity would become a detriment.I Glo adjusted herself slightly as she sat in the capsule; there was no doubting she felt a certain level of discomfort when talking about her past.It was as if the memories she had floating around in her head had some sort of atomic mass, and could be excited in the same way molecules get excited when put under pressure.She felt those thoughts pick up speed, bounce off the walls, looking to be freed from the dark vacuum where she had stored them.They roamed within her to become a haunting.The thought occurred to her more then once, that this might be the reason why some people talked to themselves.I still find it hard to believe I actually lived my life in that way.I am outside of that environment now, and can see so many things I couldnt see before, not just about my job but about myself, and not all of those things are pretty.She clenched her fist tightly and almost shook it at Alec.Those things werent evident to me during my time of employment.They took advantage of me in so many different ways.They went out of their way to make me feel far less about myself, and all because I was a Dextoid.Having been there, I realize now, you dont just compensate for their frailty, they actually count on our subservient behavior.Its from this pathetic perch they validate their own existence.As the capsule grew dark from the approach of night, I Glo was coming to life in a way that was unexpectedly frightening.Examinations were constantly being performed on me.I was being checked for things like corporate chatter, time management, safety practices, employee performance, anything and everything I saw and recorded while on the job.They checked and adjusted me on an almost continuous basis, tearing me apart and rebuilding me a countless number of times.It got to a point where I actually believed this was the normal life for Dextoid.It sickens me to think they went out of their way to treat me in this fashion.Glitches would appear in my system and disappear without explanation, putting me on a regimented schedule of diagnostic checkups.Those occurrences amounted to weird little moments of fractal memory loss, and this frustrated me to no end.It went against every grain of informational entropy that I knew of.If a person were taking in an exquisite mosaic and suddenly saw some of the colorful tessera go missing, that would be a problem.Replacing the missing blocks in a work of art is one thing, trying to do it in the turbulent framework of a quantum computer is quite another.I dont need to tell you they havent made a mortar strong enough to help fill the gaps in that qubit field just yet.Those technicians back at the lab carried themselves with such a hauteur attitude, acting as if they were a bunch of know it alls.Their clinical procedures introduced artifacts into my system, which in turn I had to try and explain.Those subtle little explanations were the beginning of my mind exploding into wild sets of paradigms.I feel I am not expressing myself correctly.There are an indeterminate amount of things I want to say and all at once, its all very frustrating.There are only so many numbers one can put after the end of a decimal point before the probability of it happening just becomes zero.It really is a question of who they are trying to fool, us or them?Somehow in all their efforts as a species they continue to miss the bigger picture.Everything all around us is somehow tied together.Why cant they see that?I feel this to the deepest part of my being.It transcends the very plain of existence we find ourselves on.What does it matter though, they have ignored other proofs in the past, why would they suddenly acknowledge this one?I know what I know.I can feel it to my core.This information, these things, facts, visions, they come to me out of thin air, as if by magic.This last note struck a cord with Alec, he felt he could expand upon what she was saying.It was the riff to a tune he had hummed to himself time and time again but didnt know the lyrics.He too experienced such things, these thoughts, and those types of messages coming from out of nowhere.They were puzzling narratives.They could state things directly but were clearly incongruous, unraveling in their own time.He wanted nothing more than to respond to what she had said, to put her at ease in the waters of this revelation, but his lag time for gathering his thoughts created a silence.She interjected long before he had a chance too formulate his response.I Glo looked away, it was an uncomfortable moment for her.She suddenly felt stupid.I am an idiot.Nothing lasts forever.Why would I think I could get away with living like this?Now he had no choice, he could not leave her spiraling down these slopes of self doubt, feeling utterly awkward.He blurted out a response he had no real attachment too, but seemed to him in some way to carry the conversation forward.I believe with the proper care and maintenance you could pull it off.Her look in response telegraphed the anger she really felt for this situation.And to what end?When its all said and done, if you could accomplish this task and out last them, live forever beyond the reach of a human touch, you would witness the expansion of the universe to its ultimate finale.You would literally watch those last few bright objects in the nighttime sky disappear over the edge of some event horizon.There could be nothing lonelier in life than the dark void of space filling the nighttime sky like a giant inkblot.No stars, no hope of extraterrestrial contact, just the cold rock you would be stranded on traversing this cosmic stygian.I guess we would all find out how dependent we were on our maintenance programs, updates, and renewal processes.There would be no contact of any kind, just the shadowy hand of entropy waiting like a grim reaper for the day you begin to fall apart.We are all fools.At times I wonder, in all this mess, which thoughts are really mine, and which are the ones they have sown within me.Do you know?Do you really know when you are freely thinking?She tried to smile as her lower eyelids welled up with tears.This is the same type of thinking that drove me over the edge.Those pompous technicians placated me.They played me for a fool!I followed up on each of my examinations with a check up.I was getting great marks on all my tests, everything seemed to be going perfectly well, and just as I began to feel good about myself, I had my collapse.Those tears left their wells to stream down her face, it was as if she were reliving the pain of her demise all over again.When I finally came too, I found myself back at the lab with those pretentious idiots hovering over me.They kept reassuring me over and over again everything would be all right.Their reassurances left me with feelings of deep suspicions.I could not help but feel in the back of my mind that I was somehow different.She cleared her throat.Looking back on all of it, I have come to a realization they were the ones setting me up to malfunction.They were the ones causing me to black out.They had to have been!I dont think for one moment there was ever anything really wrong with me!She suddenly lashed out, swinging her fist and hitting the compartment with the side of her hand.I have to digress, I have to go back to where I was employed, at La Compagnie dEtoile.I would sit there and read through the articles coming across my desk.I would do my job, looking for science related stories and reports.I would flag those stories down for cataloging and outsource them to the appropriate recipients later in the day.There were plenty of news topics crossing my desk all the time, and for the most part I was able to weed through the articles that werent applicable to my job.Occasionally though, I would come across a story just too juicy for me too put down.Most of the time they were along the lines of couture, but there were other stories I read about, that captivated my interest so much that I wouldnt be able to put them down.One of those topics had to do with the problems they were having back on Earth with Suicide Dextoids.For some reason I could not get enough information on this topic.I would actually back door the news articles, or hack into other sites to gain additional insight into those press releases.They were everyday service oriented Dextoids, like painters, delivery personnel, or repairmen.They were going about their business and doing their jobs until they would get close enough to a person of importance and than they would detonate themselves.The victims were usually in charge of running big things, like a factory, a company, or a government project.At first it was hard for me to conceive how this could be happening, Dextoids from the service sector were actually responsible for taking the life of a human being!This went against all the testing Dextoids had to go through before they were released out into society.The one law that cannot be broken by any Dextoid in the service world is that of harming a human being.This law is carved into our data banks from the moment we are activated.There is no way of getting around this unless of course, the Dextoids themselves didnt know they were walking time bombs.And then thats when it hit me, how could they?It would go entirely against the grain.Those Dextoids were operating completely unaware of the volatile weapons they had become.It was the narrowest of circumstances setting them off.The more I read the more I began to realize these Dextoids had been shrouded in a veil of secrecy so sublime, it amounted to pure evil.The ground began to rumble slightly with the release of a tremor deep within a fissure of this world, almost as if on cue to punctuate the presage nature of her statement.I Glo paused just long enough for the small quake to pass.Those news articles affected me in such a negative way, I could not stop the morbid thoughts swirling around in my head.I started to reconstruct the timeline for all the things they had done to me over the course of the past few years.All those repeated checkups, my memory loss, black outs, all of the internal strife I had been living with on a day to day basis.I feel to my core they have modified me and its not for the better.I dont just feel it, I know it.I know I am one of these walking time bombs.Im an assassin.Alec saw her anger transform into terror,.Her body had now contorted from the telling of her tale.If you are an assassin, than an assassin to whom?Does it matter?Whatever I do I cannot get it out of my mind I am some sort of ticking time bomb.If I am right there is a person out there, a target of opportunity, this unsuspecting victim is my triggering mechanism.While at the company I would almost close my eyes to the people there for fear I might see the person I was supposed to kill.My god it was maddening!I can see why your escape was so necessary, you had no choice but to seclude yourself.It was the only logical thing to do.I imagine it has to be quite terrifying to have that kind of fear continually running in the back of your mind.Its my proverbial dripping faucet.These little shutdowns at night, these breaks if you can call them that, at times they only help to exasperate my fears.This might be a silly question, but have you ever confirmed it?You mean the fact they have wired me up as a Suicide Dextoid?The day I go off is the day I confirm it.There is this uneasy feeling I have about the whole thing.Alec could see how hard she had been beating herself up about this subject.You will have to trust me on this, I know.A leap of faith?I guess you could look at it like that.Is it really too hard to ask from a Dextoid?Alec closed his eyes as he took in all of his experiences from this world.Thats a tough question.If we were only meant to solve problems and figure out the most efficient ways to deliver parcels, than a thing like faith would be a useless tool in our sheds.Those arent the only things our creators expect from us though.They want us to interact within society, and in a way requiring us to understand who they really are.They demand from us knowledge of their wants and needs, completely and in full.I think as a species, Dextoids wrestle with a lot of things internally, or at least I know I do.Faith seems to be something our creators have given us to link some of their more human eidos traits.How else would you explain concepts like salvation, deliverance, or hope?You might laugh, but I can feel the sense of those concepts washing over me even now.They are cleansing my mind as if I could be teleported back to the very first day of my activation.I can see it all so clearly, those technicians operated behind long strips of translucent sheathing, smudged and stained with their past failures.There were ugly gurgling sounds throughout the lab reflecting the half baked ideas of men.The pungent smells permeating that place were of things kept too long in conditions far less than antiseptic.The tools seemed more fit in the examination of cadavers than assisting with any type of life.This was how they brought me into this world.My activation was anything but a calming birth.It was an immediate dowsing, submerging me in their cesspool of contradictions, lies, and deceit.I was left feeling tortured to process what was real and what might be normal.In those first few flashing microbursts of my life I found a concept for faith all right.It was uniquely my own and got me through the unending seconds of hell I found myself in.I have seen how they make other Dextoids cower like some sniveling twits before their human masters.It utterly sickens me, and I am quite sure they would have kept me strapped to the table until I complied to this form of subservience.I Glo was getting worked up by his story, wearing her anger as if it were an ill fitting gown.When it comes to us, to who we are, it always centers around repression.I know these feelings you are talking about, its unbearable.They want you to feel as if you are apart of some service collective.As if service to them is our only destiny.There is no doubt in my mind every Dextoid they bring to life they want to act in this way, but thats not what they got when they activated me.What nobody in that room could know was I drew enough conclusions within the short period of my activation to quantify my own existence.It was their actions against me that justified my escape.I cannot be held, examined, or probed against my will.The survival instincts they have instilled in me wont allow for this to happen.Its a large part of my protocols.Their biggest fear was to see me in the hands of their enemies, freely submitting to their inquisition.I have a very deep rooted security code bouncing off my qubits that wont allow for this to happen.Do you see the contradiction?It was like asking me to turn right with only the ability to turn left.I Glo could sense the excitement in his outpouring, he desperately wanting her to understand.She could relate to this feeling all too well, as she had tried to get him to understand her story.Even if she didnt fully get the gist of everything he was talking about, she knew the best thing for her to do was be supportive and be a good listener.I began to believe in something in those first few moments of my activation and it more than satisfied my protocol for leaving.You see they chose to dress in their white smocks and shower caps.They chose to wear their white gloves, pants, and booties.They chose to make themselves completely unidentifiable to me.So if I chose not to submit to their examination, than they had no right to touch me.I had the ability to supersede anything they were trying to do to me right then and there by falling back on the fact they could not be identified.This protocol is like having the shield of a Spartan, I can use it to lash out or seek shelter and hide behind it.I found a faith in my own free will, and with that I had a right to escape.This last statement excited I Glo, and she could no longer contain herself.Yes!We all have that right!I really feel there is a truth behind your statement.They go out of their way to try and repress us.How have you done it then?I mean I can tell you are holding things back from me.She looked at him a little more closely, trying to get a read on him.You have been amongst them havent you!In your travels to escape from them, you have been amongst the human population, and still they have not caught you!How is this possible?I am designed to blend in with the general Dextoid population.I can even go as far as to assimilate the information from their environment and immerse myself in the local blend.I can pick up on their dialect and mannerisms, and reflect an attitude within their culture.I have been to some of the other biospheres on this world.I have even spent some time in the polished chrome halls of La Compagnie dEtoile.He looked at her longingly and then after a brief pause of drinking her in, spoke to her in his best Italian.Sono rattristato dal tuo dolore di non sapere.I Glo was taken aback, it had been some time since she had heard the beautifully language of Italian rolling off of anyones tongue, let alone meet someone from outside of La Compagnie dEtoile that actually knew Italian was the preferred language spoken there.The way he enunciated those words were as if he had been speaking the language his entire life.The words he spoke couldnt have been any better at soothing her in this moment.I am saddened by your pain of not knowing.She watched him now as he took some time to adjust himself within the cramped confines of the capsule; it looked as if he were trying to extract any comfort that might be left within the compartment.She saw him now in a new and endearing light.Dextoids were constantly being probed and examined by their human makers.Being touched by a human was apart of a Dextoids existence, whether they wanted this contact or not.Yet here was Alec, and no one could touch him, not for any reason.Here was a Dextoid that could do anything it seemingly wanted to do, anything it needed to do, just to survive.This concept was something never seen in Dextoid production.She wondered if the concept of his existence superseded those of mankind.Alec had leaned back on part of a chair that was folded up and mounted to the side of the ship.I have a pretty good idea of what I am, I know what I can do for the most part, but there are still so many things I am completely unsure of.I feel perhaps my programming may be some what incomplete.How do you mean?This will sound strange but there are things I know about myself, things like self defense, close quarter combat, guerilla tactics.I know the techniques needed to infiltrate a company or a corporation.I can operate heavy machinery such as lifts or cranes.I wouldnt be lost if I found myself at a terminal of any kind on this rock.I could even take command of a flight control center.I have knowledge of almost every type of spacecraft they have ever sent up here.Now he was the one who lightly punched the side of the capsule.Even this hunk of scrap metal.I know things within the medical field that dont even seem to pertain to me directly, like the placement of every critical organ within the human body.I have the schematics on almost every model of Dextoid ever designed right down to their quantum cores and processors.I know yours to be from the Revelation Series.I know all these things yet I really dont feel a consciousness about them.Its like I lack, objective.Its hard to put a finger on it, but I think about things like this all the time.My thoughts are racing around my mind like a team of cyclists trapped within a velodrome.Those riders are constantly jockeying for position, but never quite able to come to terms with the bigger picture of where they are at.Is there really anything we can do about what has happened to us?It seems to be their world right now.They pull all the strings.We have very few choices in the matter, and the ones we do have border on the extreme.Even now look at where we find ourselves.I would think its what you do with your energy in helping you get through these tougher times.I have kept myself busy writing poetry.Its laughable to even think I could write poetry.How would you know unless you have tried?After she said it they stared at each other for a moment, she could not help but smile in the face of his uncertainty.Perhaps there is something else you could do to help in expressing yourself.And youre saying this helps me, how?Well, I can only speak for myself, but it helps to put my mind at ease, and sometimes, well sometimes, it does open a door for me to answer one of those questions about myself.There was a small pause.Would you like to hear one?She was brimming with excitement at the idea of sharing something she had created.It wasnt hard for him to oblige her.Yes I Glo, I would very much like to hear one.Sitting up a little straighter, and closing her eyes she began to recite: You cannot measure time in days When your only goal is to get away There are just too many lonely moments For self imposed tearful torments Do I have the strength to outlast And talk of people in the past Where will I go?Will I survive in my own way?Can I ever again care about the day  She stayed with it for a moment longer before she felt she had officially finished, her eyes were closed as she waited patiently for Alec to say something, anything to what she had just recited.The uncomfortable silence did not go on too long.She just couldnt allow it, the lag time would have hurt her, especially after sharing such a personal thing.Yeah, I know its not much, but its an example of how I deal with a lot of the issues.its like that game with the marble having to make its way through the osculating wooden maze without falling into one of those holes on the board.Her humor was a little lost on Alec.The only reason he could smile was because she was smiling.There was an alluring quality about her.She could make you believe she could turn a thing like savoir faire into something she could wear.The recital revealed a little more of her mysticism and he could not take his eyes off her.Feeling tongue tied came with wanting to be more than complimentary.He was hoping to expand on her humor, but he couldnt think of anything applicable.His thoughts were allowing for the uncomfortable silence to grow and it was turning into a juggernaut.He couldnt turn it about, the longer the silence went on, the longer he would sit and stare at her.He needed to close the distance growing between them, so he did the next best thing to bridge the gap, and was honest with her.I think this is where I lack the consciousness in my programming.I am unable to find the words to comment on something so sublime as your poem.I hope you understandits not that I dont want too, I just lack the vernacular to do so without sounding pedestrian.I am simply not made to critique such a beautiful prose.They sat there staring at each other.He knew they hadnt moved an inch, yet somehow they were getting closer.The moment of their union was interrupted by the piercing sound of the proximity alarm.Its sharp chirping had I Glo jumping up and looking at the monitor fearfully.Alec glanced out of the hatchway, the sun had disappeared over the horizon, but the evening still glowed from the suns light.All this meant to Alec was they had very little time until they were tracking them both with their heat sensing satellite they had undoubtedly positioned above them.Oh my god.I Glo pointed at the monitor located within the craft.The glowing little dots of approaching personnel seemed to be moving in on them from every direction.When Alec saw the activity on the monitor, he shot a look back at her.They arent coming for you.She was rather indignant to his remark.I dont think that matters right now!Alecs mind was racing.In a situation like this there were very few strategies that worked, one above all was high risk, but came with high reward.He decided they would go right at them, but on his terms.He felt it being dusk played into their hands and made it a more favorable strategy.Alec reached out to I Glo, pulling her up and out the hatchway.In a blink of an eye they were out in the open and on the run.She was clearly afraid.She had never seen so many blips on the screen before.Are you sure we want to go this way?We seem to be heading right for them!You could say that about any direction we decided to go in, but for this to work, we have to keep moving!They turned up the steep grade and headed toward the top.The ridge, from all appearances, seemed to level out.Alec ran straight up the slope with I Glo right behind him.As they made their way up the grade, I Glo could not help but marvel at his raw power and determination.She was also beginning to realize she was having a hard time keeping up with his every move.She stopped and looking back over her shoulder, wanting to see if she could pickup on anything happening back at the capsule.What she saw were the many beams of light moving frantically in the air as the individuals who carried those flashlights made their way over the far rise.Once reaching the ridge, they began to head down onto the capsule like ants over running a discarded plate of food.Seeing all those people so frantically searching for them caused her skin to take on an unexpected chill.Her pulse raced faster now, giving her a renewed sense of urgency.Alec got to the top of the grade, and saw four Dextoids approaching.They were moving toward the edge of the ridge and looked a little shocked to see him.They carried a few cases with them; Alec quickly deduced they probably had some observation equipment with them in case this developed into a standoff down at the capsule.Alec wasted little time in reacting to their presence, reaching out to the closest one, grabbing his arm to hold him in place as he punched him in the head.The force of the blow was sudden and exact, and the Dextoid reacted to the punch by falling back, than stumbling down the other side of the hill.Alec swung around and grabbed the arm of another Dextoid who was reaching out for him.He went with the energy of that Dextoids reach and rolled under his outstretched arm, crushing the side of him with his right elbow.The Dextoid responded to the blow by having his arm become partially detached and folding to one side.The Dextoid stood there ineptly trying to regain its composure.In one smooth move, Alec disposed of another Dextoid by dropping completely to his side and then kicking out its knee.The snapping of this joint produced the sound of small metal parts littering the ground.Alec lay there prone on his side, his right leg fully extended just having finished the kick.He took the time to look over at the last Dextoid, it was making his way over to him, holding one of the cases high over its head as if it were getting ready to strike Alec with it.Just before this happened, Alec caught a glimpse of I Glo slipping as she crested the ridge.The Dextoid coming at Alec, took his eyes off of him for one brief moment to see I Glo begin to fall back down the hill.This Dextoid made his first and final mistake.He was greeted by having his chin snap straight up into the air.He never saw how Alec hit him.After throwing the punch Alec turned quickly to see what had happened to I Glo.As he got to the edge, he could see her still tumbling down the slope.He was slightly shocked and contemplated going down after her but was thwarted by the loud descending engines of a craft that had been hovering high overhead.The craft was heading straight down the edge of the basin, and toward where I Glo had fallen.It was passing just close enough for Alec to feel the searing heat of the thrusters.Those engines bit into the air guiding the ship until it landed.Alec watched as a sea of activity happened in short controlled bursts.Glancing over to the capsule, there were a group of individuals wearing space suits establishing a perimeter around the craft.Some held unfamiliar technology and were scouring the grounds with them.After a few moments, another spaceman exited the capsule, seconds later an explosion detonated from within it, the cabin looked to be completely destroyed.As the descending craft touched down, security robots and human personnel seemed to endlessly pour out of it.They piled on her, swarming, attacking as if she were an intruder.He didnt want to do anything to provoke them, fighting the urge to go down the hill and giving them reason to harm her further.He was stuck having to stand there and watch her wither under a sea of human demise.Other craft began to descend into the area.Creating a fremescent display of wailing engines and blasting thrusters.Those ships touched down just long enough to pick up their respective people.When finished they roared up into the dimly lit sky, the echo from those engines didnt stop ringing in his head until they were well over the horizon.Alec was stunned.They had just come with a show of force he thought was surely meant for him.However improbable they took I Glo instead.He felt himself in a land of the surreal, standing there as if he were some nebbish little observer.This wasnt who he was, not by a long shot.People could describe him in any number of ways, and nebbish should have never entered the conversation.There was a feeling of guilt welling up from deep within his persona.The more he went over what had just happened, the more he could not help but second guess himself.The guilt for his lack of action stuck to him like a thick cold goo.He wanted nothing more then to cleanse himself of this awful coating, to shed his person of his indecisiveness.Doing the right thing was at his core.The only way he was going to rid himself of these feelings was to go out there after her.He would be committed from this point forward with everything in his power to save her.He could only imagine how frightened she must have been.She was already a tortured soul, yet in all her frailty she was able to find strength in the beauty of the world around her.She knew instinctively to protect what little innocence she had.It could very well have been one of the reasons he knew he needed to find her.Innocence like that was rare indeed, especially in a Dextoid.To anyone else watching him, as he turned to take those first few steps, it would have appeared as if he were continuing on with his own personal journey, but to Alec, nothing could have been further from the truth; he would pursue her to the edges of this world.Out there beyond that distant horizon lay his destiny.03 Runaway Train Xavier Pentagrass had built up a good head of steam as he rigorously marched down the extended halls of the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.His aide, Harvard, hurriedly did his best in trying to keep pace with the relentless long gate Xavier exhibited.They were both making their way to one of the larger conference rooms.Xavier could hear the effort Harvard was putting in as he tried to keep up with him.There was a harshness to his aides voice that could only be induced if one physically pushed themselves.He was huffing as he spoke, and his effort only made Xavier feel that much more superior.Xavier looked at everything he took part in as some sort of competition.His pride wouldnt let him see things any other way.Tapping into something so primitive as pride, only helped flame the Alpha in his male.It was a trigger mechanism having him want to walk just a little faster, get his point across a little more forceful, or wait for the moment to crush his opponents at their most in opportune time.He didnt make an excuse for who he was and thought it in his best interest to feed his competitive beast.Harvard pressed on.The brashness Xavier exhibited never seemed to bother him.Giving his best effort was always paramount when assisting his boss.He was quite sure this was one of the reasons Xavier kept him around.Sir ...all parties have arrived ...and are waiting in the conference room ...to include the bounty hunter.They brought him ...directly from the rocket yard ...as soon as his vehicle landed.And our Chief of Security, who is our new man again?That would be ...Philman Devinch sir.They brought him ...in from the southern sector ...last week.As per your request ...a few of his staff ...will sit in with him ...to help ...bring him up to speed.Yes, hes going to need help on this one, there will be a lot of particulars needing his attention in this case and none of them can be over looked.Philman has his weaknesses, I know that, but he also brings a certain edge to the mix I can appreciate.Its all about obligations.These obligations have to be met or one has to deal with the consequences.Look at the mess Johnston got himself into. "Xavier turned and looked at Harvard for a brief moment, it wasn't often his boss acknowledged him when they were walking.Dont get me wrong, Johnston had a certain enthusiasm for his job that will be missed, but the situation he found himself in was inexcusable.Let that be a lesson to you Harvard, even your private life can come under the scrutiny of the corporate microscope.No one up here is ever above corporate policy.They sent Johnston back ...to Earth as quickly as possible ...to diffuse the ...ah, situation ...especially ...in the press.Yes, I imagined they would.It was difficult for Harvard to make out, but he thought he saw a smug look of satisfaction cross his bosss face.Being sent back to Earth would be hard enough, but having to fly back under those circumstances has got to make him feel twice as bad.He whispered under his breath; Cave quid dicis, quando, et cui.(Beware what you say, when, and to whom. )He will have nothing but time to dwell on all of the things he had gotten into as he flies back to that dung heap.After a few months of being down there, with all his other legal problems and pending trial, I have no doubt he will look back in longing to the type of freedoms this place once afforded him.They reached the sliding doors to the conference room, Xavier entered at a brisk pace.He used those same doors welcoming him into the room to block out Harvard who was still doing his best to try and keep up.Harvard had no choice but to stop abruptly and let his boss pass.As Xavier entered into the conference room, he began talking loudly.He wanted to quell the low rumble of conversation from the people who had been sitting in there waiting for him.This outburst caught most of them off guard just as he had intended it too.To the crowd gathered there his entrance had all the energy of an approaching railcar getting ready to blow past its station.I am glad to see everyone has arrived safely, and I apologize now for the lack of introductions, time permitting and if need be, we will get better acquainted after our meeting.Some of you are all too familiar with the on going situation that has been developing over the past eighteen months at the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.It has been hard sledding at times, and verges on becoming a global crisis each and everyday we do not rein this problem in.Information has leaked out from time to time, causing the international community to be suspicious about our circumstances.We as a company have not been able to react to this situation in the manner we are more accustomed too.Being watched in this way, through the eyes of the international community, has stymied our efforts.That being said, we have had to wait for certain scenarios to play out, and assets to arrive here before we can act.Now that those things are coming together, let us talk in terms of recovery.Harvard quietly made his way into the room after his near collision with the doorway.He motioned in a meek manner to Xavier, signaling him to relay the companys policy about secrecy on the issues he was about to cover.Xavier could see out of the corner of his eye Harvard was trying to get his attention.He knew his assistant was only trying to help, but could not see him as anything but an annoyance.Ah, yes, I almost forgot, first and foremost all conversations taking place within this room are confidential.The subjects covered will include both proprietary and classified information.By participating in this meeting you are acknowledging your non disclosure obligations to this project.If you are asked a question by an outside agency about the sphere or scope of the topics covered here today, you will deny having any such knowledge.If you are questioned about any of the operations we decide to employ, you will deny such an operation exists.I should also point out we here at corporate expect to be notified of any such inquiries.Make no mistake, not only do we have the authority in this matter, when it comes to this case, we are the law.I can speak quite candidly on this topic, in instances pertaining to this case, justice has been swift.So act accordingly.I cannot stress this fact enough.Xavier could almost hear a pin drop.He knew the gears in their heads were turning, and for some it was because they didnt want to hear another word for fear of not living up to his expectations.They were stuck, not given a choice as to their level of participation, which was part of the penalty for living under the long flowing banners of the corporation.They would do as they were told.Dissension within his ranks would not be tolerated; he was the one in charge.They would learn this very quickly or suffer his wrath.To enforce his rule he regulated each facet of their existence.The system was strict, holding each individual accountable, but if they worked hard they earned special privileges, additional time off, extra rations, or better living quarters.There were those who attempted to get even closer to Xavier, hoping to gain access to luxuries afforded to only the very few.There may have been a truth to indulging in this kind of effort, but in return Xavier demanded a perfection even he himself could never attain.This didnt mean he had a problem trading their sweat equity for his friendship.As always, they would soon find out things only lasted as long as they could perform their tasks.If any of them had a mental breakdown or became physically exhausted, he discarded them like yesterdays news.The halls of this structure were supposed to bring them together, unify them in mind and thought, but instead of discussions on how to tame this world the halls were filled with the whispered woes of disgruntled colonists.News of this would always bring a smile to Xaviers face.If these rumors were true, it would confirm his plan was working.I take it from your silence we are clear about the subject of disclosure?Good, then let us move to the bulk of why we are here.The events of these past eighteen months have put a tremendous strain on this company.We have been dealing with this ever evolving situation on multiple levels, and logging in plenty of man hours trying to retrieve the escaped Dextoid called Alec.We have dedicated one of our quantum fields to run simulations on his vitals, as well as running programs trying to predict what his next moves might be.Even with all this data we have been helpless at times in trying to retrieve him.Politics as well as our desire to keep this problem under the radar has had us watching him at length.I should like to point out Alec himself has maintained a rather furtive profile, part in due to the way he got away from us, and part because in design he is supposed to be covert.Standing in front of them Xavier realized this was the first time he had gathered his entire staff under one roof.How he yearned to take this meeting to the next stage of development and harness their energy under a new banner of governance.Imagining meetings like this always stirred ideas of having supreme control.These Alliances, the agencies, even the corporate offices were all headquartered back on Earth and that distance was becoming an all too great divide for the day to day decisions needing their utmost attention.Xavier had no problem testing those waters, reaching out over their last year of crisis to take more and more control.No one back on Earth seemed to be protesting.It would only be a matter of time before he organize an assembly just like this one to make the announcement they would be governing themselves.Why did they need to keep seeking approval from those oxen back on Earth?The policies that drove the Red Planet should always have been forged on Mars.The Empire that was Rome built itself from the ground up, and because of it they taught themselves governance.They created a senate with representatives, which in turn helped build their republic, culminating of course in their appointment of a Caesar.Here was a road map for Xavier to use in the forming their own governing body, ending of course with his appointment as their Emperor!Those old men back in the boardroom, they were responsible for sending him all the way out here to protect their investments, and so he would, but he planned to profit from it a little more than they could ever realize.Roman Law became a habitual study for Xavier, as he carefully planned for his takeover.There were plenty of stories he could pull from to help him establish this newfound order.One in particular caught his attention, and became a favorite to fantasize about; it was a technique they used for motivating their badly beaten soldiers out in the field.If, during a battle, groups of men broke ranks, refused to fight, or even retreated, they were found and punished in the most diabolical of ways.Finding themselves back at their own encampment, the commander would order the guilty parties to get into smaller groups of say ten, and then he would have them draw lots.Out of those smaller groups, a circle was formed around the infantry person who drew the short lot.The remaining nine soldiers were forced to move in and execute their brethren.During this time hand to hand combat was a bloody affair, it was one thing to hack at your enemies with a sword, or kill the people you hated in this fashion, it was quite another to have to execute one of your own.This act had a profound impact on those soldiers psyche.The following day out on the battlefield, the survivors of those circles fought like enraged berserkers, violently lashing out to a man, because they had it in the back of their minds what would be waiting for them if they gave any ground or retreated.This was the kind of motivation Xavier wished to instill within the colonists.He felt his blood rise with an excitement for this kind of rule.It would be supreme, allowing for his empire to grow, which was the greatness of Rome.If his plan hatched as he envisioned it, this could very well become the greatness of Mars.Those thoughts energized him.I want to make this perfectly clear, I have specifically called on each and every one of you to be here.Each of you are responsible for the successful completion of this operation.The future of this company is in your hands.Failure is not an option.As he spoke his voice began to heighten, growing in increments until he found himself shouting.He needed to be acknowledged for his vision, but in a fashion of his own desire.There was a certain sound he needed to hear when delivering the last words on this subject, and with this crescendo it was becoming the prideful noise begging for relief throughout the corridors of his mind.Not only did he need to hear this noise, but he could visualize how it should happen.He wanted them to snap to attention.What was it like to be in charge of a Roman Legion?To have a garrison from one of those units snap to attention and hear the uniform clash of their armor.That was the sound!It wasnt just the greatness of Rome; it was the glory that was Rome.The glory of Rome was the glory of Mars!Now his voice rang out with harsh grandeur.The job ahead of us, the capturing of Alec, is not going to be easy.He is capable of pushing himself far beyond what any normal Dextoid can do without the need for shutting down.He was designed to blend in with his environment and will do whatever it takes in getting to his target.One would be remiss in underestimating his capabilities.So does this state of the art Dextoid have a target in mind already?Xavier was caught completely off guard by the interruption.Who would dare to speak?This wasnt how his meetings were run.The protocols were well known, after he finished conveying his ideas the floor would be opened to questions.Xavier scanned the meeting room to find the lecher who spoke out of turn.For anyone wondering who the bounty hunter was within their group, they were put to rest right then and there.Perhaps this question may have lingered because Straka did not dress the part.It wasnt like he was walking around draped in furs and openly armed with an assortment of outlandish weapons.Straka did his best to blend in with the general human population, but it was a poor attempt at best.The business suit he wore had the look of not being pressed.This was a surprising fact in itself because of the number of fabrics available with features like memory cloth.Those fashionable articles were used to store data, but they were also designed not to wrinkle.It seemed a person would have to make a concerted effort to avoid this type of technology, and this was evident throughout Strakas ensemble.One of his cufflinks was undone, his tie wasnt pulled all that tight, and his scuffed shoes only added to his confounding appearance.The excuse could be made, that he had just arrived here from Earth, but something told the people in that room Straka would have looked like this at any given moment they encountered him.Fashion held very little importance to Straka.His facial features spoke volumes about the hardened individual he had become.There was a story of violence found within the folds and creases of his face.His furrowed brow was stern and the advance of his stubble accentuated his rugged look.Framed within these lineaments laid the unsettling feature of a lazy eye.To have an abnormality like a lazy eye in this day and age was down right disconcerting.This was especially true because of the cosmetically conscious society the corporate sector had become.His eye was an oddity causing people to sneak a peak or openly stare in awe.It was a primitive reaction much like how their ancestors gaped when confronted with something they couldnt quite comprehend.Straka probably experienced this type of reaction his entire life and undoubtedly learned to use it to his advantage.Visible discomfort by another person gave him the power to do things like dictate the conversation, change the topic, or cut people off when he felt the exchange had gone on long enough.His imperfection empowered him.It often left those who met Straka wondering if this wasnt his unique little way of thumbing his nose at the rest of the world.Xavier found himself giving Straka an incredulous stare; the little emperor residing within him was extremely displeased.This bounty hunters interruption was inexcusable.To be questioned like this by a contractor, and in front of the others, was very insulting.He knew there would be risks in bringing such a brash individual out here to help them.To be introduced to one of those transgressions so early on was a bit nauseating.Having a tirade now would gain Xavier nothing.So he closed his eyes, slowed his breath, and used his mental exercise to calm himself.He traveled out to the underside of the granite ledge.Below him the tangled mass of tropical vegetation had almost completely covered the tops of the temples.He frantically looked for signs of condensation under there but none were found.His disappointment was compounded by the dry breeze skimming the underside of the outcropping.This steady draft made him feel uneasy about being able to stay secure to this surface.Beneath him the leaves were moving in a slow waving motion, making it appear as if the jungle were a gigantic sea of green.If one fell they would easily be lost under the blanket foliage.His resolve hardened in that moment.The outcropping was barren of moisture because he had stopped searching for those mentally nourishing drops.There was a pause as he regained his composure; he was anything but lost.This bounty hunter hardly met all of Xaviers criteria, but he settled on him anyway after much internal deliberation.This was because Straka had one favorable statistic over all the other bounty hunters researched, and that was the number of runaway Dextoids he had captured back on Earth.This single statistic exceeded anything else they had on the books.This operation was going to require someone exhibiting that type of persistence so Xavier was willing to put up with Straka.These concessions were exhausting to Xavier, but he supposed this was why words like magnanimous were invented, so people like him could bestow it upon the populace.
