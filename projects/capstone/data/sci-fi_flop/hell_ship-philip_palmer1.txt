           Sharrock I could see flames in the night sky; and fear for those I loved burned in my soul.I had been riding for five days and five nights through the red and lonely desert.My throat was parched, and my skin was          like ash.And I had been dreaming, vividly, of the pleasures I would soon enjoy: a lazy bath in warm and perfumed waters;          a slow massage of my angry muscles; a richly sensual copulation with my beloved wife Malisha; a long draught of rich wine;          and, finally, a deep, soul enriching sleep on a mattress filled with shara feathers.All these dreams ended when I saw the glow in the sky.The clouds above and beyond the gnarled escarpment of grey rocks were          bloodied by red flame; white floating pillows now transformed into ghastly red carcasses.And I knew that my village had been torched.I dismounted my cathary and knelt, and put my ear to the soft sound conducting sand.And I waited, until my mind and ears          were in tune with the planet and its hidden truths.And then I heard:        A faint humming noise, like the murmur of blood running along a warriors veins, and I guessed that it was the sound of a          skyplane hovering.Shrill receding cries, remote, celebratory, in a language I did not recognise.The hooves of riderless mounts, aimlessly pit pattering.The low moans of warriors and wives and husbands and children; sad cries of dying grief that mingled agony with impotent rage.I heard also, faintly but unmistakably: the soft, hoarse death gasps of throats scorched by sun fire blasts; the pants and          grunts of those enduring brutal wounds; the wretched sobs of wounded children; the despairing howls of mothers cradling their          lost beloved.A massacre.I took out a shovel from my saddle pack and dug a deep hole in the sand.Then I took my cathary by the reins and led her down          into the hole, and coaxed her to lie down.The beast whinnied and kicked, but I stroked her mane and whispered in her neck ear          and calmed her.Then I lay beside her, still whispering, and the winds swept sand over us, and before long we were buried          deep and invisible.After four days buried in the sand I crawled my way out.The cathary was in a coma by now, and I gently massaged the creatures          heart until her eyes flickered.I drank from my canteen and spat the water into her moisture holes.And then slowly the cathary          got to her feet, and shook her head, and whinnied, and was ready to ride once more.It took two hours for me to ride through the teeth and gaping jaws of the rocky escarpment and reach my village.The flames          had died down by now.The bodies that had burned so fiercely as to light the evening sky were now but charred corpses.The          shrubs and trees whose blazing leaves and bark had sent daggers of flame to falsely dawn the sky were now no more than patches          of ash.The tents were still intactno fire could ever harm thembut the mountains and foothills of the dead stretched before me, like the remnants of a bonfire in an abattoir.Too many          to count, too blackened to recognise.And all were dead now.No moans, cries, whimpers, sobs.This was a village of the dead, and all those I had known and loved          were gone.I was sure beyond doubt that my wife Malisha was trapped somewhere in the decaying mass of suppurating flesh.And I supposed too that my daughter Sharil must be one among the many          black and silently howling tiny bodies I witnessed inside the tents, whose impregnable walls had kept out the flames though          not, tragically, the heat.This was a systematic slaughter.There would be no survivors; only those wounded beyond hope of          recovery would have been left behind.I could see plainly that the warriors had all died in combat, and I counted more than a hundred of them.Their bare faces          were frozen in screams, and their swords were gripped in hands, or had fallen close to their bodies; but no traces of gore          could be seen on their sharp and fearsome blades.No glorious battle this, but a long distance act of butchery.My friends, all.All but a few were wearing body armour, and this puzzled me.For I knew that only a long and sustained burst          of sun fire rays could burn the hard weave plate in such a way.And the warriors of my tribe were too swift and agile to be          trapped in the path of such deadly beams for that long.But all were dead anyway, sundered into pieces by a fast moving beam          of power that could incinerate bodies encased in armour in an instant.And dead, too, were the husbands and wives of warriors, and the daughters and sons of warriors.And dead too were the Philosophers,          forty and more or them, small and helpless and beautiful as they were, caught up in a battle they were unable by temperament          to participate in and slain like ignorant beasts.Which tribe could have done this thing?The Kax?Or the Dierils?Or the Harona?All had sworn peace in the days after the          Great Truce.But truces could be broken, and there was no underestimating the guile and malice of these island tribes.Or could this be an act of revenge by the exiled Southern Tribes, who long had hated our peoples of Madagorian for expelling          their vile nation from our planet?I had lately spent six months in the decadent and perfumed city of Sabol, on a mission          that almost cost me my life and the future freedom of our entire race (and yet, let it be known: Sharrock was not defeated!)And so I knew only too well how hated we were by these fat and effete Southerners, with their technology and their mechanoids          and their passion for ceaseless expansion through space.Could they have done this?Did they send their sleek and powerful space vessels to wage war upon their former home?Surely          they would know that such an act of barbarity would incur our deepest wrath, and their own inevitable destruction?I realised I was weeping.Not for my dead wife or my murdered child, for that grief lay deep in my heart and would torment me until my dying day.No, I wept from shame, that I had not taken my place          with my fellow warriors and died in glory.Instead, I had buried myself in sand and lay there like a corpse until all those          who were slowly dying had agonisingly perished, and their attackers were long gone.The shame ate at me like a double edged knife carving a path through my innards; but I knew I had done the right thing.Sometimes,          a warrior must be a coward.I filmed the carnage carefully with the camera in my eye and then inspected the sands where the battle had taken place for          forensic evidence; for the performance of this vital task was my purpose in surviving.I found no enemy bodies, even though          some of our warriors had clearly fired their projectile weapons and sun fire guns in the course of the bitter conflict.In          places, the red sands themselves had been burned by the crossfire; and the rock escarpment and the grey mountain ridges were          pitted with bullet holes and heat scars.I surmised from all I had witnessed that the village had been attacked by stealth fighters of some kind, armed with weapons          more powerful than any I had ever encountered, and with armoured hulls that were impervious to the rifles of our warriors          and our anti skycraft cannons.Our warriors would have had only minutes to prepare for battle; that would explain why they          had not taken to the air in their own fighter jets.I knelt before the body of one of the dead warriors who had been killed but not burned, and recognised him as Baramos, a noble warrior indeed.Baramoss guts had spilled from his body and sandworms were eating them.I ignored that and took out          my thinnest dagger and thrust it into Baramoss skull, and split the bone open.Then I used the tip of the blade to root inside          Baramoss inner ear until I retrieved the dead warriors pakla.This would provide the scientists and Philosophers in the city with all the information they needed; every word uttered between          the warriors in the course of the battle would be recorded here.Baramos had been, I recalled, as I gouged the pakla out of his brain, a magnificent fighter and a fine scientist and (so his          wife had often bragged) an astonishing lover and also (as I knew from my own experience) an inventive and poetic story teller.I spoke a prayer for the dead, and then I called my loyal cathary over to me, and I stroked the creatures mane and kissed          its snout with genuine fondness.Then I took out my second largest dagger and slit the beasts throat, and stood back as blood spouted from her slit artery.Her knees buckled, and she sank to the ground, staring at me; and then she died.I regretted the death.But I dared not leave the creature here, where it would, as hunger assailed it, be bound to feed upon          the corpses of the dead.That would be a sacrilege; the carrion birds could and would do their worst, but no cathary should          ever eat the flesh of a Maxolu.The ground shook beneath me.I was startled, and almost lost my balance.I looked up, and saw the skies were black.A distance missile and skycraft battle was in progress, I deduced, above and inside the city, which I estimated was 234,333          paces away from my current position.The missiles that were being dropped on the city must be enormous, because they were          sending shudders along the planets crust.And clouds of black smoke were now billowing in the sky to the northeast of me,          a clear indication that high toxicity weapons of some kind were being employed.I muttered a subvocal prayer to release the hidden doors of the skycraft hangar; and stood back as the sands shuddered, and parted, and the skycraft deck was exposed.But at that moment a sandstorm sprang up, with an abruptness that shocked even me, and I was flung upwards and backwards,          and battered with sharp grains of red sand.I rolled over, letting my body go loose to avoid injury, then clambered to my          feet and ducked down low with my back arched and my hands clutching my knees; and tried to walk towards the hangar.But the          blasts of the gale were too strong, and I was once again snatched up by the teeth of the snarling wind and sent tumbling like          a broken shrub branch along the desert dunes.Finally, I managed to hook my wrist grapple to a deeply buried rock, and my flight was halted.I turned over and lay face          up as if I had been staked to the sand to die.A streak of lightning shot across the sky above me, like a three pronged spear.The clouds were bright silver moons now, as countless missiles exploded in mid air and seared their softness with angry flares.The ground shook again.Was this, I wondered, the end of me?Was Sharrock finally, after all his many adventures and countless terrifying brushes          with angry death, to be defeated?No, I thought.Never!I waited until there was a brief lull in the battering gale, then I detached my grapple and crawled on my belly over the sand,          my eyes shut tight as the wind ripped at me with dagger stabs of blinding pain.I felt as if I were climbing up a high mountain          made of turbulent seas, as the soft sand moved beneath me and the wind tried to tear the skin off my body.The world above was red whirled sand; and the ground below was treacherous liquid softness; and thunder roared; and my veins          could feel the pulse of electricity in the air as the lightning flared.And I dug deep into my soul, until I touched that part of me that will never ever be defeated; and I crawled, and crawled, into the sharp teeth of the savage spitting storm.Eventually, I reached the dip in the sand that marked the hangar decks opening, and I tipped myself over and fell downwards          into the sand mountain, and slowly slid to the bottom.I was now entirely buried in sand, with grains in my nostrils and ears          and eyes and no way to see.But the sand was slitheringly soft, and I was able to slide my way through it, not breathing,          and not opening my mouth or nostrils for fear of suffocating on sand grains.It took me thirty minutes, almost to the limit          of my lungs capacity, before I reached the side of the hangar bay, guided throughout by my infallible sense of direction          and mental map of the hangar area that allowed me to see precisely where I was without the use of eyes.Once I had touched the wall, I fumbled with my hand until I found the clicker that turned on the hangars fans; and then I          clicked it.And I was now inside a sandstorm, clinging on to a rail like a cathary breaker clutching his mounts silky mane as a tornado of red sand grains          rose up and around me and then flew upwards into the sky like a comet.And when the world was clear again, I coughed like a dying beast, and tried to spit but my mouth was too dry.The fans continued          to whirr, creating a single oasis of calm air within the swirling sand all around.And I opened the store cupboard and clad          myself in armour, slipping into the soft but impregnable bodyweave that yielded to my bodys every muscled contour, and fitting          the black mask tightly on my face so that I became a shadow with no visible eyes.Then I chose the fastest of the fighter          jets that were parked on the deck inside invisible wall overcoats; shut down the invisible wall with a signal from my pakla;          and clambered in.I sat in the cockpit, buckled up, and spoke the silent prayer that would tell any friendly pilots or skycraft controllers          nearby that my craft should be accorded urgent passage.Then I started up the skycrafts engines and it bucked instantly upwards, then soared effortlessly into the air like a stone          hurled by a warrior up at the moon.I flew over the massacre site, hovering above the mounds of the dead below me, and wondered if          I should use a missile or an energy beam to burn the rest of the flesh off the corpses bones.But that might, it occurred to me, attract the attention of the enemy.I did not even dare to send a message from my pakla          to the city with news of the massacre, for fear it would be intercepted and used to home in on my position.No, I would have          to deliver my message in person.I switched my engines on to full and the skycraft ceased hovering and leaped forward through the air like a wild maral pouncing          and snatching a bannet from the sky before swiftly fleeing its victims brutal mates.The speed weight crushed me to my seat.And as I flew, I had a moment of reflection on what I had lost; my friends, my village,          and my two deep and abiding true loves: Malisha, my wife, so truthful, so funny, and so passionately loving.And Sharil, my          daughter, three years old, sweet, and mischievous, cursed with my own dark roguish features, yet blessednay thrice blessed!with          her mothers beauty and wit, and radiant smile.For a moment, I recalled these two and I felt their presences.And for a longer moment still I was appalled at their evermore absences.But then I had no more time to mourn.I took the plane up high, out of the atmosphere, until I could see the cratered pockmarks of our purple moon and the unmistakable          towers of our lunar city.But I realised that the towers had all fallen, and the moon was pock marked a thousand times more          than usual.Then I banked and ripped downwards through the sky of Madagorian, and proceeded at a fast diagonal towards the          capital city, Kubala.Then I saw it.It was one of the enemys skycraft, without a doubt.A vessel larger than a battle plane, and bizarrely coloured in varying          hues, and shaped, extraordinarily, like the stem of a harasi tree.It was invisible to my matter sensors, and the dazzling sunlight          on the hull made it opaque to ordinary vision too.But the faint heat emanating from the craft was clearly visible to me through          my enhanced vision mask eyes.I smiled, in anticipation of vengeful victory, and launched my missiles.Then my craft kinked, in a savagely fast manoeuvre that was designed to avoid any return missile fire.The Philosophers had dreamed the single seat skycraft to be winged creatures that embodied air and speed and grace; they were          to be supple beautiful flying machines that merged with the minds of their pilot, so that flesh and machinery beat with a          single heart.And our warrior scientists had followed the Philosophers dreams precisely and with unmatchable skill.And so my craft, a tiny dot in the air, was now as much sky as sky plane; it was a bird and a cloud and a raindrop; and yet          it was also a killing machine with near unquenchable reserves of bombs and missiles and devastatingly powerful fast fire guns.And my sky craft had another eerie power; it was able to change direction abruptly and swiftly without the effects being felt          by the Maxolu warrior in the cockpit.So that when I piloted the plane, I could fly faster and more unpredictably than any          bird that had ever lived.I and the plane that was part of me skidded across the sky, and reversed and looped, and plunged towards the ground, and recovered          from the plunge, and accelerated at a speed so near to light that time itself, as measured by the skycrafts clock, very near          stood still.All the missiles achieved direct hits, for my aim was unerring; but the enemy vessel clearly had some kind of protective invisible wall,          so the explosions splashed harmlessly off its hull.Then I flew beneath the enemy ship and extended my crafts nose spike and I flew directly into the other craft.The spike penetrated the hull, and I fired a fusillade of delayed action missiles into the vessel, then snapped the spike, and flew          like the heel of a skate upon ice across the blue sky and watched.The enemy battle ship jerked out of control as the bombs exploded inside it.It veered wildly from side to side, then started          to fall from the sky.Then it vanished.And reappeared behind me and I saw it through my all around mask eyes and I fired a hail of burning gas through the rear of          my craft and saw flames burn the enemys hull, and was once more dancing around the sky.The enemy ship was billowing steam from side vents now, a clear sign that there were fires within and its hull was compromised.It fired a battery of projectiles and energy streams towards me, but my dancing pinprick of a fighter craft eluded them all.The enemys huge battle ship was faced with a single Maxolu skycraft, and it was losing.I felt a surge of triumph.And then I saw that the enemy vessel was descending, and landing.It burned the grass in a field and touched down with no          jolt, and the side of the craft opened up and I saw far below mein the image magnified by my mask eyesa single figure step          out.I increased the magnification on my eyes still further; and was surprised to see that the figure emerging from the ship was          a female warrior carrying a sword.Was this a challenge?The enemy battleship lifted into the air once more and flew off.The warrior remained, alone, on the ground.The message was          clear: a one on one combat was being proposed.I plunged downwards, with a jolt of joy that was like falling off a cliff, and landed my craft on the seared grass.I knew          this might be an ambush, but I had to take the risk.For according to the laws of my world, any battle and war can be decided          by single combat, no matter what the sizes of the respective armies.But now I wondered: would these enemy warriors hold to          such values?For I had, of course, realised by now these were no ordinary warriors; they came from elsewhere, from some other planet around some other star that existed far away in the universe of          stars that encircled us at night.My enemy were aliens, and they had invaded my world.I stepped out of my craft.I removed my mask, so I could taste the cold morning air on my cheeks, and shook my long hair.Then I took my sword and scabbard out of the cockpit pouch, strapped it over my back, and walked calmly towards the alien          warrior.The warrior was female, as I had already seen.But, close up, she looked like no female I had ever before beheld.She had          fangs, like an animal, which protruded from her mouth; and no ear flaps.In the centre of her forehead was a third eye.She          was largetwice as large as myselfand powerfully muscled.And she wore no body armour but was clad in tight bright yellow          animal hides that left her legs and stomach and arms bare.Her hair was bright scarlet and streaked with silver and blew in          the wind.And her skin was pale, more white than red, and entirely lacking in soft ridges.The contrast in our sizes was almost comical; I was a dwarf beside this giant.She was without doubt a magnificent specimen          of her species, warily graceful, with bulging shoulders and arms and stocky legs.And there was a steely look in her eyes          that assured me she knew well the bitterness and the joy of combat.I stared up at her appraisingly and without hate; for hate will slow the warriors hand and eye.What tribe are you?I asked.You do not know my tribe, the warrior replied, in a husky low voice that made my flesh tingle with the eerie unfamiliarity          of its tone.What is your name?I continued, patiently.Zala, said the warrior.And yours?And she stared at me impassively, unafraid to meet my eyes.I am, I said proudly, Sharrock.She stared at me, unimpressed.Hiding my disappointment at her lack of response to my, by all objective criteria, legendary name, I added: You are, I take it, not from our lands.I am not.Tell me then, whence do you come?She was still staring into my eyes; shamelessly, and in my view arrogantly.I felt a flash of rage and stifled it.I would kill her first; and then I would savour my wrath.Far away, she said, in what sounded to me like sad tones.Another planet, around another star.As I had suspected, I told her, formally.For your ship is like nothing I have ever seen.Your appearance is hideous and          strange.You are an alien.In your terms, I am.Why do you wage war upon us, you whore fucking, turd eating monster from afar?I asked her, with ritual invective.She laughed.Answer my question, o withered hole!I insisted, and she laughed again.We come, she said with open mockery, o pathetic male with a tiny prick that I will eat and feed in morsels to my female lover          in order to conquer and destroy you.Why?I said, stung at her unfamiliar insult.Why not?said Zala the female warrior, tauntingly.Once again I had to bite back my rage; for I truly despised this warriors lack of respect for tradition.Her peoples war          with my people should not have been fought like this!A formal declaration should have been made, and hence due warning given;          poems should have been spoken, songs composed, regrets expressed.All this should have been done, to create a war that would          have been ennobling for all concerned.Instead, they had simply ambushed our valiant warriors, massacred our defenceless families and Philosophers, and left them          all to rot.Which planet do you come from, you tainted by vulgarity and laughed at by small children shit covered harlot?I said.She grinned, clearly amused by our social ritual of rhetorical abuse.It has a name, she said casually.You will not know          it.It is far away.Your astronomers will never have seen it.All you need to know is I am a warrior of a once great world.Will you fight me?I will.If I kill you, your world is forfeit, the alien warrior said arrogantly.Very well, I said calmly.And if I kill you?That wont happen, said the alien warrior Zala and she lunged forward with her long curved sword, the hilt clutched in both          her hands.I dodged easily and drew my sword from its scabbard on my back with one hand and swung it fast at her and she recoiled and          barely dodged it, then I wove forwards to the left and then to the right, ducking and rising in a single flow, then thrust          the tip of the sword towards her bare midriff.But she leaped in the air and danced on the flat of my blade and kicked my          head and somersaulted over me then plunged her sword back and over her own head at me, without turning around.I was awed at her speed, but evaded the blow and swept my own blade a thousand times in the air in a series of continuous          movements.Zala countered each sword strike with a speed that impressed me, for we were both fighting faster than the beatings          of a baro birds wings.But I was stronger, and the next time she leaped in the air I leaped high too and clutched at her face with my fingers and          plucked out one of her eyes.We both landed, swords held upright and clashed steel once again.Blood dribbled out of her empty eye hole.Her face was a          cold mask of hate.I felt a surge of joy; this was glorious combat.Then her blade went through my heart and I exulted, and with my dagger I sliced off her hand at the wrist and stepped back.I grunted in pain, and also in delight.For her severed hand and blade were now trapped in my chest, with the tip of her sword          protruding from my back.But my second heart was easily able to sustain my body.And now the alien was fighting swordless          and one handed, with scarlet blood gushing from the bloody stump of her right arm.But Zala just laughed and drew her second sword, and I lunged again and she dodged and stabbed my leg and so I butted her          face and swung my own weapon in a rolling pattern of cuts that shook sparks from her blade.Then with my left hand I stabbed          once more with my dagger and slashed at her throat so powerfully it severed her head, and the head fell off her body and bounced          on to the sands.And I paused, and for a moment allowed myself to relax; but her head continued to laugh.I was shocked at this; then I realised that the head must have its own blood supply.And, too, the headless torso was still          holding its sword and was undeterred by the loss of its head; with speed and bravado it leaped at me and carried on fighting,          blind yet unerringly accurate in its sword strikes.I was on the defensive now; the headless torso had renewed strength and was able to somehow perceive where my body was and          even anticipate my moves in ways I could not fathom.And all the while the head on the sand laughed, as its body fought me;          and I forced myself to ignore the absurdity of it all and lost myself in battle lust until my blade swept down and rent the          warriors body in two.The two halves of the alien warriors torso twitched on the sand, blood gushing, organs spilling out.The battle was over;          or so I thought.But then the right half of the warrior lifted its sword again, and tried to stand up.And the left half of the warrior drew          a knife and rolled in the sands, trying to get upright with only one foot.The warrior was still not dead.Still not dead!I brought my sword down and split the head into two halves.Blood splashed, and I could see the grey folds of the creatures          brain.Her tongue was split in two, but her two separated eyes were staring at me and still she was laughing, even though          it was a gurgle and not a real laugh.Die you devilish fucker of evil monster!I screamed.The two halves of the head spluttered with delight.I lowered my sword.I was defeated; no matter what I did, I could never kill this creature.What will happen now?I asked.But the sundered head could no longer speak.And there was, I felt, sadness in her remaining          eyes.And at that point, Zalas head started to shimmer before me, and I realised I could see through her face and sundered smile          to the sands behind.Then her head slowly vanished, and her body too, like mist dissipating in the morning heat.I marvelled at this magic.What powers did these creatures have?And what utter, taunting, disgusting malice.This was not          war, it was mockery.I looked around.The alien battle ship had not returned.And in the distance, a false bright red dawn on the horizon revealed that the city          itself was ablaze.And I saw that the sky above me was now black with single Maxolu fighting craft; but they werent fighting, they were just          spiralling aimlessly.There was no battle being fought, merely the sad savouring of abject defeat.I had a sinking feeling          of despair.The ground below me shook again.But these werent bombs exploding in the distance; this was an earthquake.And I realised that the sand beneath me was hot; my feet were seared with heat through my boots.I cleaned the blood off my          sword and dagger, then sheathed them.The ground shook again.I braced myself.Then the ground erupted.The sand was scattered into the air and the rock below was exposed, and it split before my eyes,          and red liquid lava poured out of the rents.The earths hot crust was erupting out of the ground directly beneath me.And at the same time lightning once more ripped across the sky, vast forked bolts that stabbed the air and made it scream.And a loud roaring sound filled my ears, and then a wind sprang up from nowhere and knocked me off my feet.I staggered upright          and saw hot volcano spew rolling towards me like tides in a raging ocean.The sky was empty now, all the Maxolu craft had          been obliterated by the savage winds.The air itself shimmered with heat, as if it were ablaze; and hail rained down on me          and burned my face.I knew now that my world was dying and there was nothing I could do to save it.A river of lava flowed fast towards me, and engulfed my knees and thighs, and burned off my trousers and boots and the flesh          of my legs and arse beneath, and I tasted ash and my own blood as I accidentally bit my tongue.My skin was hot and my body          hair was sparking, and waves of heat oppressed me like a pillow used to suffocate a convicted coward.I howled in despair.I could not run, or move in any way.My legs were ablaze, the flesh was turning molten.Then the red hot volcano spew engulfed me, up to the chest, then up almost to my neck.I thought about my wife, Malisha, and          my baby girl, Sharil.And I mourned their deaths, as my tough flesh began to burn, and my bones were seared with heat, and          my eyes stung with ash that turned my tears into hailstones.Sharrock defeated?I wondered.Never!I vowed.But in my heart I knew I was doomed.And then                Jak My name is Jak.I was, once, a Trader.And this is my story.The green hided soldiers led Cantrell and myself through dark moist corridors of rock until we emerged into the FanTang Council          Chamber.The Chamber was high ceilinged and awesome; it was a huge hall set within a cavern hewn out of a mountain.Its white marble          walls were inlaid richly with gold and silver and precious stones, and the pillars and pilasters were decorated with bas reliefs          carved with remarkable delicacy and beauty, notwithstanding their brutal content.The air was toxic, a blend of oxygen and gaseous cyanide, and I breathed in deep draughts, savouring the thrill of inhaling          certain death with no actual peril.Cantrell stared at me sourly.Let me do the talking, I said.Here they come, said Cantrell.The FanTang leader stepped up before us.He was at least a basal taller and broader than the other FanTangs we had met.His          green porcupine hide was ridged with spikes, and he had glittering eyes on every part of his body except his head.Ears?I whispered.That was covered in the briefing, snarled Cantrell.I wasnt listening.Ears?Cantrell sighed.Where your girlfriends nipples are, those are its ears.And so I stared at the monsters nipples; they were as sharp as a daggers point.I counted six of them; and I wondered, idly,          if this creatures aural organs could also lactate.Then I lowered my head, and scraped my right foot on the ground five times, the FanTang ritual for greeting.You did hear some of the briefing then, Cantrell hissed.I cast him a brief but brilliant smile; then looked at the FanTang leader, lowered          my head, and scraped my foot on the ground five times once more.Hello, again.But the FanTang leader did not move.His three advisers did not move either.They glared fiercely with body eyes that appeared          to be made of glass; and their open mouths dripped saliva through fangs on to the cavern floor.And I noticed that the spikes          upon the bodily carapace of the FanTang leader were stained with what looked like red celled blood.We wish you to hear us, I said, in fluent FanTang, and the FanTang leaders glassy eyes all blinked, in unison.I took the translating pads out of my sackhaving reached the limits of my idiomatic FanTangianand knelt, then crawled on          my hands and knees to the FanTang leader.I held out the translating pads.The giant FanTang took the pads.I touched my own chest with my hands.The FanTang copied the gesture and the adhesive pads gripped his breasts and then the          listening pads were in place.We wish you to hear us, I said, in Olaran, which was then translated into the FanTangs language by the listening pads.Can you in fact hear and comprehend us?I said.The FanTang leader was still.I can hear, he said in his own language, and the translator did its job, and I heard the worlds          in Olaran.I crawled back on my hands and knees to rejoin Cantrell.Mission accomplished, I said grinning.How does this work?the FanTang leader asked, querulously.Its a translator, I explained.It translates.We have seen this device before, said the FanTang leader.You sent swamp wolves into our camps and they spat these things          on to our bodies and the wolves howled at us and we understood them and marvelled, and then we slew them.And what did they say?Cantrell asked, dryly.Dont, the FanTang leader admitted, Kill.Us.Cantrell sighed, disapprovingly, and the translator turned the sigh into words: [Disapproving exhalation. ]The Fan Tang leader was startled.We sent the swamp wolves, I explained smoothly, to prepare the way.We know that you are afraid of us.We are not afraid of you!roared the FanTang leader.We come from deepest space, in ships that spit fire, and you are right to be wary of us, I said diplomatically.We are not wary of you!You blew up, I said impatiently, all our scout ships with your nuclear missiles.In our culture, that counts as wary.Wary, perhaps, conceded the FanTang leader, but not afraid.Our ships were piloted by robots, I said.Non living creatures, not alive.You did us no harm.We bear you no grudge.You are our enemy, it is therefore your duty to hate and destroy us, the FanTang leader rebuked me.It was by now apparent that these creatures were small minded, ignorant, bloodthirsty savages; nonetheless, I persevered.We are not your enemy, we are your friends, I said, as carefully and clearly as I was able.We come not to fight war, but          to make peace.We do not wish to conquer, we wish to trade.What, said the FanTang leader, is this word peace?And what is trade?Peace is the opposite of war.Surrender is the opposite of war, the FanTang leader explained.No, not fighting is the opposite of war, I said.Collaborating.Being friends ing.Concord.Not killing each other.These parent fucking monsters have no fucking idea, Cantrell muttered sourly.The FanTang leader roared, but in a cheerful way; I realised it was a laugh.Parent fucking, that is a good phrase.We can          adopt that in our own language, the FanTang leader said gleefully.Trade means we give you what you want, you give us what we want.We want your deaths, said the FanTang leader, and took out a stick that was tied to his belt, and shook the stick so it          became a sword, and struck off my head.[I woke, in agony.I forced myself back down on to my couch. ]That wont help you, Cantrell said mildly.Blood poured out of my neck stump; I made it congeal.My heart stopped beating; I made it beat again.I opened my eyes and          found I was on the floor staring up at an odd angle at the entourage of green, angry, aristocratic FanTangs.We come in peace, my head said mildly.The FanTang leader jerked in shock.My torso sat up.My hands picked up my head and put it back on my bloody shoulders.The broken blood vessels rejoined; the          neck healed, leaving an ugly scar.I stood up.You can survive the loss of a head, said the FanTang leader, marvelling.Cant you?I said, mockingly, and took out my ray gun and fired it, a flech to the right of the FanTang leaders skull protrusion.A chunk of the marble column behind the monster vaporised, with a sharp hiss.I fired again, and the rock table vanished.I fired a third time, at the feet of the FanTang leaders monsterly advisors, and a hole appeared in the ground beneath them          and they leaped for safety.(Good shooting, murmured Cantrell. )If we fought a war, I explained gently to the FanTang leader, you would lose.Yeah!You parent fucking bastards!added Cantrell, viciously.The FanTang leader emitted a sad, pathetic howl.He looked around helplessly.I am humiliated, he said, feebly.Not so, I said calmly, and handed the monster the ray gun.Look.A gesture of trust.We come in peace.Here is my magic          weapon.I give it to you to show that I trust you.We come in peace, which is not war, which is better than war, which is        (Quit while youre ahead, murmured Cantrell. )All we want to do, you see, I said patiently, to this savage green hided brute with skin like lava and no control whatsoever          of its salivary glands, is trade.You give me your weapon!said the FanTang leader, marvelling, holding the ray gun as if it were awell, as if it were a          deadly weapon of extra FanTangian origin that had just been given to him as an unexpected present.That shows much respect!And trust.And        He pressed the button on the side, and the gun fired.And folly!the FanTang leader roared, delighted by his own rhetoric.The blast ripped me into pieces; I flew through the air and landed in fragments, and my blood gushed on to the floor messily.Then the monster pointed the ray gun at Cantrell, and fired again.[I woke, in agony again.I took a moment to recover my wits.All was going according to plan. ]I returned into my shadow body.It was a perfect simulacrum of my real body, accessible to all the senses including touch.But it was, at the end of the day, no more than a computer simulation, which I could easily control with the power of my thought.And so this time I allowed my pools of blood to coagulate and merge until they stood upright and formed a human silhouette.My severed limbs slicked across the floor and reformed and rejoined, and my arms then placed my head back on my body, until I stood before the monsters as a flaccid blood emptied sac          of skin.Then I opened my mouth         and I drank my own blood silhouette, like a squelched fruit travelling backwards in time; and resumed my normal shape.Beside me Cantrell did the same.The two of us tottered on wobbly legs, regaining our balance, then stared as terrifyingly          as we could at the FanTang leader and his associates.We ask you to surrender, I said, using the only relevant term this creature seemed to grasp.The FanTang leader gaped; the flow of saliva became a flood; and I screamed: SURRENDER PARENT FUCKER OR YOU DIE!while beside          me, Cantrell grinned approvingly.I surrender, o mighty one, said the FanTang leader humbly, and cravenly.We ask for your sword, you defeated and abject, um, defeated creature, I demanded; and the FanTang leader took his sword          from his belt, and shook it until the blade grew and gleamed, then handed it to me, hilt uppermost.I hefted the sword.It was light, but powerful.I guessed that small worlds technology was involved.This was, despite the          aliens brutality and grotesque salivation, a pretty sophisticated culture.We ask for, nay, we demand, your life, I said, with what I felt was considerable aplomb; and I swung the sword and lopped          off the FanTang leaders head.The creature roared, and fell to the ground and died in evident agony, green blood spouting from its head less torso; while          the head itself rolled slowly across the cavern floor until it hit a wall.We now offer the hand of friendship, I said, icily, to the surviving FanTangs.Rebuff us again, and you will all die.The FanTang advisers bowed their heads, in a clear gesture of submission, clearly reassured that I was finally talking their          language.How do we, one of the advisers said humbly, trade?[Back in my simulacrum tank, I grinned. ]My shadow self, stained with splashed blood, bent and twisted where my body hadnt properly reformed, still managed to retain          its customary dignified demeanour.I shall, I said coolly, explain.Come on, stretch, said Averil sternly.After five days in the simulacrum tank, I was stiff and muscle wasted and yearned to lie down and die.But I pushed myself          hard, stretching my leg muscles, shaking out my shoulder muscles, and turning my headwith a satisfying crack of my neck vertebraein          a perfect circle, to get it nicely limber.Swivel those hips, Averil ordered, and I swivelled my hips so that my groin exchanged places with my arse, and vice versa.And back!I swivelled my hips swiftly back to their normal position, and blinked, seeing stars.Floor jumps!I dropped to the ground, pushed up and down, jumped into the air, and made an X shape with my arms and legs.Hold!I held my position, hovering in mid air, breathing through my diaphragm to keep my air sacs inflated.And land.I landed.Sweat bathed my muscular body now, and I could see that there was a sparkle in Averils eyes.She was an exhilaratingly intelligent          woman, squat and powerful, with a shrewdness in her features that made my heart skip.Run on the spot.I began running on the spot, my legs arcing high with each pace, and Averil followed suit.We ran side by side to nowhere,          with an effortless stride.I could see the dampness of her strong shoulders.I could see her muscles moving beneath her smooth skin as she ran.I knew her game, and I was enjoying it.Okay, stop, said Averil, and rub down.I grabbed her, and touched her all over with my hands.Rub yourself down, I meant!she said laughing.I kissed her lips.My tongue flicked into her mouth.Not here, there are cameras, she protested, mildly, kissing back.I disconnected them.You disconnected them huh?On the offchance.On the offchance of what?On the offchance of this.I fumbled with her leotard, slipped the catch, and it fell away from her body.She was naked, her body was hot and flushed          and soft.I kissed her breasts, then put my hand between her legs and touched her sex, its hardness and softness, and its          pulsing heart.I slipped out of my own leotard and stood before her naked; and with her gentle fingers and warm palm she caressed          both of my erect cocks.Yes!she moaned as I entered her, and then she screamed, and her body gripped me, and her muscles squeezed me, and her kisses          dampened my cheeks.I love you, I murmured, gently, as her passion grew, and she screamed, and swore, and her body bucked and spasmed until          finally she came, with adorable violence.Averil lay panting in my arms.And I savoured the pleasure, the unique joy, of being able to liberate her joy.That was fabulous, she conceded.I smiled.I had made my female happy.I was content.Let me see, said Chief Trader Mohun, and I opened the casket.Jewels, I said, passing over an elaborate chain embedded with precious stones and tiny golden ingots carved with complex shapes and soft white things that looked to me like the teeth          of FanTang infants, though I chose not to enquire too deeply.Fabrics, I added, and passed over a sheet of softest silk, made from the webs of Blaga sized creatures called Shibbols who          were kept in underground FanTang farms where they wallowed in excrement and never saw the light of day.Weapons, I concluded, and showed Mohun a selection of swords, axes, knives, bolas, hurlable metal spikes and throwing darts,          all moulded and carved with impeccable artistry.We can sell these to the Kala, Mohun said, beaming, for avarice was the candle that lit his soul.They love weaponry of          all of the sharp, nasty and stabby varieties.And body parts, too of course.I know, I said, smiling nostalgically.Ive seen Youve seen their diamond eyes?Ive sold their diamond eyes.Wrested from the corpses of slaughtered Banzoi.They are, indeed, beautiful artefacts; eyeballs          that can be worn as jewellery.I like the Kala, said Mohun, thoughtfully.They are indeed, I concurred, easily duped, and often overpay by huge margins.And whats this?Mohun said, inspecting the air image of an evil looking body ridged monster with hundreds of dead staring          eyes and skin like food that had been hidden and forgotten about centuries ago.The FanTang mummify their dead.Ah, said Mohun delightedly, as if I had bathed him in Magola oil with soft hands that had never known a hard days work.They use a kind of resin that turns decaying flesh into, well, decaying flesh that doesnt actually smell.The effect is          striking.A perfect ornament for the hallway or courtyard.Perfect!Theyll sell their mummies to us?Not willingly.But we have small print that will cover it?Our print, I assured him, is so small that microbes can make necklaces of our Os.And what do they want in return?Wealth, power, and the ability to smite their enemies and conquer the universe.Mohun roared with laughter.Predictable.What can we actually give them?I think theyll settle for technology that will allow them to geo engineer the other planets in their system.We can offer that, Mohun conceded.And they also want access to our shadow self technology.Also not a problem.And theyve guessed we have a way of travelling instantly through space.They want us to teach their scholars the essence          of rift theory.Out of the question.Thats what I thought.How about showing them how to teleport?Yeah, I guess we can do that, said Trader Mohun, with a sly smile.Good, I said, riffling mentally through my notes.Their animals are edible to Type 430s.Their plants are delicious, apparently,          if you have a second stomach.All very satisfying, said Mohun.Well set up a trading post.Have you signed the contracts with them?I shook my head.Not yet; give me a few days more.I have every faith in you, Trader Jak.A drink?said Mohun.Always, I avowed.Mohun poured two thimbles of rich juice.We sniffed, then swallowed, then slammed; and I felt a familiar          pin prick in my eyes and a pounding in my brain.We each took a deep breath, as the rich juice entered our brains and sent our thoughts into violent paroxysm.And then tranquillity descended upon us.Our moods became mellow.And we engaged, for a quarter hour or more, in chit chat          about our favourite colours and textures and smells; and reminisced about the soft touch of Madyouran silk upon ones body, and the tenderness of the Laumarax star flower, and other such          memories.They are, the FanTangs I mean, an appalling species in many ways, I told Mohun.Violent.Warmongering.Scornful of other          species.And yet all the indications are that they will honour a deal; and, with sufficient intimidation from us, will refrain          from trespassing on other planets in the Olaran Trading Zone.And if they dont?Oh the usual precautions, I said.One cannot be too careful.The celebration banquet was, as one would expect from a Trading Fleet as sophisticated and cultured as our own, magnificent.It was held in the Banqueting Dome of the Court Ship, a glass shelled room which offered a spectacular view of the stars around          us.I wore my Fogan life robe, made of silk from the finest queen Fogan spiderbirds.The robe had once been a shawl that was wrapped          around the new born me; at which time it bonded with my spirit so it would always be perfectly attuned to my moods.Tonight the robe was cheerfully scarlet and blue and bejewelled and dazzling, and swept behind me as I walked.I wore a tight          tunic over my muscled torso and my legs and arms were wrapped in wool plucked from young Mantrian Shaals.You look wonderful, said Averil, who wore a rich pure white Drax hide gown, her hair pinned back to highlight the smoothness          of her high forehead.Slyly I ogled her acuity; she was indeed sublime.Kiss my lips, I requested, and she did; my lips were lightly coated in electrically charged jewel dust and sent sparks into          her tongue.Beneath my robe, my entire body was coated in the same dust, which kept me in a permanent state of sensual excitation.A good days trading, said Chief Trader Mohun, as he ushered me to my seat at the banquet table.I admired the arrangement of the dishesa thousand tiny portions in a pyramid that hovered          above the table.As each course was eaten, the pyramid would re form into ever more appealing new shapes.I sat, and looked around, admiring the beauty of my fellow Traders and the majesty and understated authority of the assembled          Mistresses of the Fleet.However to my dismay I saw that there wereseated directly opposite me, like black thunderclouds in a clear blue skytwo grim faced          Space Explorers.Dressed in drab grey synthetic fabric tunics with no bodily or facial adornments and not a trace of, well,          finesse.The younger one was pretty enoughthough hardly beautiful by the standards of the Court Shipbut his companion was old and          bald with eyes like black holes.This wizened old spacefarer had skin like withered hide, and a scowl that made me shudder.I conjured up my most charming smile, and vowed to never let myself become so decrepit.I am Trader Jak Dural, I said to the Space Explorers, and it is an honour to encounter such famed adventurers; Ive read          so much of your exploits.The old one glared; the younger one beamed.Do you even know, the older one said, who we are?Its on the tip of my tongue, I said sweetly, checking my factology via murmur link.I am Morval, once I was Assistant Chief Trader to the Empress, said the one whose name, I now knew, was Morval.I recall your name; the honour is all mine, I replied.Morval!One of the most legendary arseholes in the history of the Olaran Home Court!My name is Phylas, said his young companion, and flicked his tongue so I could see he did at least have a jewelled stud          embedded in it.You have, I take it, been many years in the wastelands of space?I asked.Thats what we do, said Morval grimly.Im hoping, added Phylas, for advancement into the Trader Fleet one day.Once your suspended sentence has lapsed, added Morval, cattily, though it was hardly a surprise to me; only the old and          the criminally disgraced would serve with the Explorers.Is it a crime I would have heard of?I asked brightly.Phylas scowled, and his youthful good looks were marred.Forgery of alien artefacts.Skilfully executed?Apparently not.Then you deserve, I said, uncharitably, everything you got.I gather, said Morval, that the negotiations with wretched FanTang have been successful?He had, I noted approvingly,          changed the conversation with some degree of tact.Early days, I said modestly.And Morval grunted, with open scorn.This system was one of my most appalling missions, Phylas admitted.I found it well, appalling in many ways.They boiled us alive, Morval informed me.Or rather, our simulacras.It was a test of course.When we survived, they agreed          to meet our trading team.Theyre a monstrous species, I agreed.Cruel, said Morval.Treacherous, added Phylas.Vicious, clarified Morval.Barbaric, muttered Phylas, further clarifying what did not need to be further clarified; I realised these two had spent          a great deal of time together in deep space.Bloodthirsty, Morval countered.How, Phylas burst out, can you do business with monsters like these?I was amused at his navety.What would you rather do?Isolate them!Then theyll never, I pointed out, improve.Ah, said Phylas, the light of insight in his eyes.So were really using trade as a way of making barbaric civilisations more civilised.Define civilised, I said coolly.Not eating your young, or enslaving a rival sentient species.Fair definition, I conceded.But our job is not to conquer, or to manipulate societies.I sipped my wine, and felt a glow as it slid down my inner throat, then entered my outer throat, and then proceeded downwards          into my stomach where I tasted and savoured it again.Our job, I explained, is to make the universe a better place, through the fairer distribution of its treasures and its          artefacts of sentient created beauty.And I showed them the jewel that hung around my neck; a diamond the size of a Toowits egg; a gem of the rarest beauty.Jewels, said Phylas.Its all about jewels?Pretty much, I admitted.Plus fabrics, objects of artistic merit, music, novels, filmsmainly, though, jewels.And I selected and ate my first morsel of food from the aerial display; a crustacean paste spread upon the liver of a snowbird.It was, as I had anticipated, sublime.The second bottle of wine surpassed the first; it had a rich tang like the bass notes of a stringed larura mingled with the          promise of sunshine on a cloudy day.Indeed, each course was a joy to be savoured a dozen times in each of my taste organs.I gorged myself, and drank until my          vision swam.Then I circulated around the table, conversing with a wide variety of Traders and Mistresses and crew.All agreed the mission looked to be a triumph, and Mohun had already selected the Traders who would remain in the permanent          trading post.Yet, despite the pleasant company, and the sensory epiphanies of the food and the several buckets of alcohol I consumed, I          carried a stone in my soul.For whenever I looked at Averil, I saw she was aglow; and I inwardly wept.When the meal was over, the singing and music began, and the table sank into the floor.Cushions replaced our dining chairs,          and some brave souls swayed in time to the rhythm of the tabadrums, moving like birds trapped in viscous air across the sway floor.I joined Averil and hugged her hips with my palms, and kissed her temples, and admired the diamond around her neck, which          was glowing in time with her heartbeat.It was the pair of my own diamond; the two stones began to glow in synchrony.What are you thinking?Averil asked, playfully.About how wonderful you are, I told her.Flatterer.Its true.All males are flatterers.And all females are angels.Liar.I smiled.I worship you, you know that?Averil smiled, and picked a fruit from a floating tray and ate it with a flamboyant swallow.I know, she said casually,          and her hand brushed her hair, drawing my attention to the vastness of her exquisite brow.And still, she glowed.The ships Commander approached us.She too was wearing an exquisite white gown, and exuded effortless authority.Congratulations, said Commander Laeris.Thank you Commander.Theyre a vile bunch, the FanTangs, arent they?the Commander said, laughter in her voice.Ive rarely seen viler, I smiled.The Commander kissed Averil on the temples, courteously, and the two of them basked in the joy of being female.Hes quite a catch, the Commander teased, and Averil burst out laughing, and her skin glowed even more brightly.And my spirits sank, further thanI have no metaphor for how far they sankand I felt bleak melancholy sweep over me.For, you see, honoured listener to my tale, whoever you might be: the females of my species always glow in the hours after          passionate, love filled sexual congress.And yet I had not fucked Averil since yesterday.Two of the ships most distinguished females stood on the stage and began to sing, unaccompanied, a melody of eerie beauty.I listened, and watched, wallowing in awe, yet sick with despair.And I stared at Averil with desperate intensity as she listened to the delightful ditty; rapt and focused, visibly appreciating          each tiny nuance; and I marvelled at the lustre of her intellect.She glanced at me, with an unexpected look of regret.Then her eyes flickered to one side and her glow increased in radiance.I followed her gaze.Mohun.Mohun!The Chief Trader was a hundred years if he was a day.His face was old as parchment.He was physically fragile.How could          she prefer him ?I left the Banqueting Dome and walked back to my cabin.I sank into my bed, and wrapped the sheets over my face and mouth          and tried to pretend I was hibernating, as my ancestors used to do.Mohun!My pain had an echo; for, many years before I met Averil, I had been married to a stunningly intelligent and percipient female.And she too had betrayed me.My beloved was called Shonia, and I had asked her to be my bride when we were holidaying in the Olaran city of Pandorla, on          a narrowboat on the river Kal.Amusingly, she claimed to be shocked by my effrontery in proposing to her, and pretended to slap me with rage.However, she misjudged both the distance between us and her own strength, and managed          to swipe me off the boat with a single powerful blow.Still laughing, Shonia dived in after me and the two of us swam to shore,          followed by the angry curses of the boatman.We had been equals, back then.Shonia had refused to be bound by convention; and when we married, she allowed me equal rights          and status.She had even tried her utmost to give me sexual pleasure, despite the frustrating limitations of our species biology.(We Olaran males, you see, cannot achieve orgasm; it is natures way of keeping us in our place, as my mother always said. )For a whole year my soul nearly burst with joy.I believed I was the luckiest Olaran male in all of history; for I was in          love, and I knew that the female I loved also loved me.And then one day I had woken to find Shonia asleep and glowing, and I had realised this wasnt my glow.She was connecting,          sexually and spiritually, with another.A month later I received a note from Shonia revoking our marriage, and asking me to leave our family home.I never saw her          again.And thats when I signed up for the Trader Fleet.To forget my grief.Now it had happened for a second time.And, after this second betrayal, my old grief had returned and merged with my new grief, to create a doubly grieving knife          (a metaphorical knife, I hasten to add, though perhaps I did not need to) that jutted from my soul.I beg pardon, I said formally to Averil.You are forgiven.I have proved an unworthy partner for you, I said.Another has proved more worthy, said Averil, concluding the divorce ritual.Then she grinned.Oh come on Jakis this really          such a big deal?To me it is, I said stiffly.In this day and age?Many Olarans dont mate for life any more.We could just be lovers.I could not endure that.They call them fuck friends.I could never be that.I love you, Averil.My words resounded like off key notes.I know you do, she said.Then I must leave the Fleet.Thats your choice.I will join the Explorer ship, I threatened.A wild gamble on my part; it failed utterly.Whatever, she replied, casually.I could be killed, I pointed out.Its a dangerous universe.We may never see each other again.Thats too bad, said Averil in bored tones.I sighed, forlornly.Averil, I shall think of you always, I said, with undimmed ardour.No doubt, said Averil pleasantly, you will.I packed my possessions into a box.Holos of my parents.A key ring with all my metal mind storage files, from childhood on.My identity pass.My bank folder.It was not much, after a life in service.I was well off, admittedly, but Id stock piled          no treasure, and Id never been assigned my own planet.All the money Id earned at trading, Id spent on my women.First          Shonia, then Averil.I should have been more cunning, I realised.There were many males who kept their independence by embezzling from their own earnings before passing on their pay to their wives.I had never pursued that route; I was too much of a romantic.Or, I mused, too much of a fool.Mohun snorted.Youre throwing your fornicatory life away, he pointed out.I care not.You have talent.What do you careyou betraying son of a slattern!I sneered.Mohun forced a smile; but I could tell he was hurt by my words.But you are still my friend, I added, and the relief shone in his eyes.Listen Jak, he said to me softly.I cannot deny that your former wife Averil has a truly gorgeous mind and lip smackingly          apt judgement.And I am, of course, privileged to be hers.Indeed you are.Indeed I am.Mohun was holding back his tears; and I respected that.For if he had wept, I would undoubtedly have done so too; and we would          both have been lost.However, I should stress, my dear friend, Mohun continued, that my love affair with Averil and your consequent humiliation          were not my choice, nor my desire.I nodded, to acknowledge that eternal truth; females choose males.I shall never see you again, I said, and walked out of the Chief Traders cabin, to begin my new life.Sai ias I felt so very sorry for him.He was, like all the new ones, angry; and savagely so.And bitter; unreachably so.Possessed by a wild desire to take revenge          for what had happened to him and his people; and deranged, too, by grief and sorrow, at the loss of everything he had ever          known.And, as was always the case, he vented these feelings upon me.You murdering daughter of a pustulent rapist who fucks whores bitch!he roared, and then he spat at me, a rich mouthful          of acidic spit that stung the soft skin of my face and left a sticky residue on my cheeks.You malice tainted shit eating sloshy farting father fucker, how could you do it?How could you do it?he roared, accusingly.I yearned to touch him, and to soothe his rage; but I knew that myfrom his perspectivemonstrous appearance made my very          presence an ordeal to him.Monster!Youre uglier than a two headed mutant baby monster!he angrily told me, as he paced around his confining cabin.If you say so, I replied, in the mildest of tones, but that just enraged him all the more.All in all, my heart burst with sympathy; I knew just how this poor, sad creature felt.For I had once felt that way myself, many years ago.And I remembered my rage then, and marvelled at its absence now.Let me explain to you, I began gently.Im going to fuck you with a spear in your throat and your eyes and arsehole!he screamed.I wouldnt like that, I informed him, very much.Evil bitch that even a fat arsed Southerner wouldnt screw!Festering cock meat!he screamed, spittle falling from his mouth.He was quite hysterical now, and entirely oblivious to the gentle irony of my last comment.Later, I said, kindly.I will explain it all, later.I dont know how you can tolerate that foul mouthed creature, Fray said to me.At least, I said, as tactfully as I could, since Fray was legendary for her indolent refusal to help her fellow captives,          Im doing something to help the poor unfortunate soul.You think so?sneered Fray, with that tone of hers which implied only a fool would say such a stupid thing.I do, I said softly.For it is my self appointed role: I greet the new ones, teach them the ways of our world; and thus          I ease the pain of their transition.You sad pathetic arse sucking beast, Fray said to me, shaking her head bewilderedly.And then she roared, a powerful rising          roar that deafened me, a raw hoarse trumpet sound that embodied all her rage, and pain, and grief.I took a moment to let my hearing return to normal.Hell come to terms with it, I said, quietly and sensibly, the same way we have.Fray roared again, implying she had by no means come to terms with it, and the sound made my skin prickle with fear and          regret.I watched the sun go down.It was a beautiful sight.The yellow orb became a red staring eye; its gaze swept slowly across          the landscape, shedding a scarlet radiance on the white snow capped mountains and the calm blue lake.As I watched, ivory          clouds were metamorphosing to become daubs of orange upon an orange black sky.The richness and beauty of this setting sun effect was, as it was every night, awe inspiring.Then the sun was switched off, and pitch darkness swathed my world.I lit a torch, and its faint beams cut a tiny slice out          of the night.It was time to retire to my cabin.That night I told my cabin friends a long and, in my opinion, delightful story about my mother.She wasor rather had beena          wonderful creature, full of warmth and love, and I had never seen her flustered or angry.(Except of course, at the end, as          she embraced me, her only surviving child, in those soul wrenching minutes before she died. )And this was the hilarious story of my mothers journey to the seabed to fetch pearls from the jaws of the vast and fearsome          kar fish.It was the day of the tenth anniversary of my birth, and when she arrived at my party, bloodied but triumphant,          she was able to shower me with the richest of gifts: black pearls that sang and were warm to the touch; shards of coral fish fragments          that caught the light like a rainbow; and live seabites that I could hold beneath my tongue, and which made me feel as if          I were (as my distant ancestors had been) a lazy seabeast swimming through the oceans, allowing food to drift effortlessly          into my mouth.That was my mother!Shed risked her life to make me happy that day.And such kindness, in my opinion, is a rare and a special          thing.There was gentle applause when I finished my story.You loved your mother?asked Fray.I did, I told her.Fray snorted.Her species, I knew, had no concept of maternal love.One time Fray had told us, with relish, a story about how Frayskind          mothers loved to eat their young; and shed gone into considerable detail about how enjoyable it was to crunch upon the bones          of newborn Frayspawn, and to munch the skulls of toddlers who had, in some unspecified way, been errant.Our response to her          tale had been unamused, and indeed hostile.Fray had, I recalled, been extremely offended at our narrow mindedness and lack of empathy for her cultures moral values.I watched the dawn.The sun was a rich and glorious ball of fire, as it always was.And its red rays lit the waters of the          lake and made them ripple like flames furiously flickering, as they always did.I looked at the Tower, standing bleak and eerie on its craggy summit that loomed upon the island at the centre of our worlds          only lake.And I felt a breeze on my face as the wind was turned on, and the fields of purple grass began to sway.I drank from the well of life, and it was rich and refreshing, and cold.I tipped the dregs from my cup over my face and felt          my black hide moisten.You must eat, I told the prisoner softly, for the hundredth time.It is one of the most important things the new ones have          to learn; the necessity of eating both regularly and well.Eat, I said, but he ignored me.Please, I beg you, eat, I implored, but his eyes were blank and he did not move.Then he turned to me, and his face became a sneer, and once again he spat at me (clearly a gesture of disdain in his culture),          and he screamed, with spectacular fury: Fuck your puckered arsehole, you soul stealing fucking bitch!And I could tell he yearned to be able to attack me, and mutilate my body, and perhaps even kill me; but he dared not, for          my every tentacle was larger than his single torso.He was, to my eyes, a quaint and tiny creature; very prone to rages, and gifted with an extraordinary breadth of eloquent          invective.Most of his insults cast aspersions on aspects of my femininityfor my voice to his ears was unmistakably femaleor          my inability to practise monogamy, or the size and condition of my sexual organs.Often, he ascribed to me a fondness for          eating my own excreta, which in fact I do, so I wasnt too offended by that one.And, on other occasions, he indulged himself in vivid fantasies about my demise.One of his favoured insults, as I recall, was: May your small brained children eat your mouldering fucking flesh so they          can shit it out and feed it to the fucking Baagaa [rodent like creatures who were indigenous to his planet]!Another classic taunt was: Youre just an ugly mother raper whose children ought to turn into mutant freaks so they can fuck your arse then eat you alive!Or rather, this is how it came out in translation; in his language, he later told me, all this could be expressed by a single          one syllable word; a miracle of linguistic economy, in my opinion.He also, and often, encouraged me to swallow the cock of a Sjaja [a large furry animal indigenous to his planet] and choke          to death on it.His language was, all in all, deplorable, even after being toned down by the translating air.But I had no linguistic taboos,          so his words did not hurt me.If you dont eat, I explained to him eventually, you will be in pain.You will suffer intestinal disorders.Your body will          start to consume its own fat reserves.You will not die, but you will wither away.At this point he began screaming and weeping, but I continued:        Your skin will be like parchment, I told him.Your heart will be hard as a stone.Your blood vessels will scar your body          like blue streams in a rocky desert.And this process cannot be reversed.Eat, or the flesh will fall off you and it will          never grow back.I dont plan to live that fucking long!he said savagely.Show me your arms.Fuck away, you bitch with a withered arsehole that stinks of death!he sneered.Show me.He hugged his arms tightly to his body.I gently but firmly pulled one arm away and looked at the wrist.It was gouged and          ugly and full of pus.The teeth marks were still visible.But the artery had resealed and there was no trace of infection          in the wound.You must understand, I pointed out to him, that you cannot die.What have you turd fucking monsters from Hell done to me?he asked, with desperation in his tone.I had, I must confess, become fond of the poor wretched creature by this point.Though his ranting did annoy me somewhat;          and I found him, to be candid, rather ugly, although these things are of course highly subjective.He was a thin bipeda morphology I used to loathe, though I was becoming used to itwith two eyes in the front and one mouth;          and, at this very moment, his face was wet, which I knew from considerable experience of this species type indicated a show          of emotion.Then, as his face dampened still further, he lay down and curled his body up in an unnatural posture which I presumed to be          defensive and defeated.So I waved my arms and blew soft air on him through my tentacle tips, and was appalled when he began          to scream.I withdrew a few paces and, still in my gentlest tones, explained the truth about our lives, the thing that we all of us have          to face.Your body has been improved, I said.Your rejuvenation powers have been enhanced.A bullet cannot kill you.A knife cannot          kill you.A broken neck cannot kill you.Age cannot kill you.Disease cannot kill you.But if you do not eat, you will become          a living skeleton and the pain will drive you to the brink of insanity.This is evil beyond evil, you creature who should never have been born!he roared.Then he began to writhe and spasm, and he howled in horror, fists tight clenched, tortured by the fact that his formidable          (by small biped standards) physical strength could not be used against an enemy such as this: his own body.You must, I told him sternly, eat, or you will regret it, bitterly and self reproachfully, for all eternity.That night, Quipu recited to us a poem; it took six hours to perform, using a complex system of calls and responses between          his five garrulous heads.His poem was extremely good but a little repetitive.It was the story of a god who played tricks          with all his creatures by disguising himself as various exotic animals indigenous to Quipus home planet.The final trick          was when the god arrived on Quipus world disguised as an alien invader.
