  We include this section as a courtesy for new readers who did not have the opportunity to peruse The Doomsday Vault, the most excellent first volume in this series.The information may also prove useful to experienced readers who require a bit of a refresher, or who lack a mechanized cranial implant with fully realized library.Thoroughly experienced readers are encouraged to leaf their way over to Chapter One, where they will find Gavin Ennock in awkward and perilous circumstances.The year is 1857.Nearly one hundred years earlier, a new disease ravaged the world.The plague causes rotting of flesh, and also invades the hosts nervous system, causing motor dysfunction, dementia, and photosensitivity.Victims lurching through the late stages inevitably became known as plague zombies.However, a handful of victims end up with neural synapses that, for a brief time, fall together instead of apart.Advanced mathematics, physics, biology, and chemistry become as toys to them.But as the virus slowly destroys their brains, they eventually lose their grip on reality.Their attachment to mechanical inventions and their detachment from normal human emotion earned them the name clockwork geniuses or clockworkers, and the disease itself became the clockwork plague.Two nations England and China built opposing empires using the fantastic inventions supplied by captive clockworkers, and only the delicate balance of power holds the two empires in check.In The Doomsday Vault, we encountered Alice Michaels, an impoverished woman of quality who had finally caught the eye of wealthy industrialist Norbert Williamson.Norbert promised to pay Alices familys debts if she married him and provided their eventual child with a title.Alice reluctantly agreed.Mere hours later, she rescued from great danger a handsome young street musician named Gavin Ennock.Before Gavin met Alice, he served aboard the American airship Juniper.An unfortunate encounter with pirates left him stranded in London with no means of employment save playing the fiddle on street corners.After Alices dramatic rescue, Gavin found himself attracted to her, and she to him, but her circumstances and his social standing didnt allow for a romance.A great many adventures followed.Alices aunt Edwina turned out to be a clockworker.Plague zombies attacked London.A great mechanical beast kidnapped Alice, and Gavin rescued her with the help of a mutated walking tree designed by another clockworker.Gavin and Alice learned of a shadowy organization called the Third Ward.The Ward, led by Lieutenant Susan Phipps, has been charged by Queen Victoria herself to scour the world for clockworkers and bring them back to London, where they build inventions for the good of the Crown and the detriment of the Orient.Aunt Edwinas diseased mind created a pair of cures for the clockwork plague, but such cures would upset the careful balance of power between the British and the Chinese, so the Third Ward locked Edwinas work in the Doomsday Vault, which houses only the most dangerous of inventions.Infuriated, Edwina infected Gavin with the plague in hopes of forcing Alice to retrieve the cure and, in the process, kill everyone in the Third Ward.Edwinas plan worked almost.Alice and Gavin stole the cures, but stopped short of murder.Aunt Edwina did not survive the release of her own airborne cure, and Alice found herself the disconcerted owner of a mechanical gauntlet that can cure the clockwork plague with a scratch.Unfortunately, neither of Edwinas cures helps clockwork geniuses; they only cure people in danger of becoming ordinary plague zombies.Alice left her betrothed and declared her love for Gavin.She attempted to cure Gavin of the plague and failed; Gavin was becoming a clockworker.Alice and Gavin fled London in a small airship, with Lieutenant Phipps hot on their heels.Joining them are Gabriel Stark (a clockworker who calls himself Dr.Clef), Feng Lung (the son of Chinas ambassador to England), Kemp (Alices mechanical valet), and Click (Alices windup clockwork cat).They are heading for China, which has its own supply of clockworkers, and may have a more powerful cure that can restore Gavins fading sanity and save his life.Chapter One  Gavin Ennock snapped awake.His temples pounded, his feet ached, and his arms flopped uselessly above his head.Far above him lay green grass strewn with twigs.It took him several moments to understand he was hanging upside down by his ankles.At least he wasnt naked this time.Hello?he called.Below him, nothing moved.He shifted in confusion, and the iron shackles around his ankles clinked like little ghosts.How the hell ?The last thing he remembered was walking back to the inn from a much needed trip to the bathhouse and someone had called his name.Now he was hanging head down amid a bunch of trees.Most were little more than saplings, but a few were full sized.Gavin didnt know trees, but these certainly didnt seem normal.Their branches twisted as if with arthritis, and the leaves looked papery.Two or three bloomed with bright blue flowers, and bees bumbled among them.The forest itself was contained within a domed greenhouse, three or four stories tall.Gavins head hung fully two of those stories above the ground.Glass walls broken into geometric designs magnified and heated angry summer sunlight.The whole place smelled green.Water trickled somewhere, and humidity made the air heavy.Breathing felt almost the same as drinking.Poison ivy vines of fear took root and grew in Gavins stomach.Hey!Blood throbbed in his head, and his voice shook more than a little.Is someone going to tell me whats going on?From around one of the trees limped a man.His back was twisted, and his sparse brown hair clumped unevenly against his skull.This and his scarred, gnarled hands gave the initial impression that he was old, but Gavin, who wasnt yet twenty, quickly realized the man was barely older than he was himself.The man was a clockworker, and the plague had left him with physical and mental scars both.Shit, Gavin muttered.Is he awake?The man had a French accent.Yes, he is awake.Im an agent of the Third Ward, Gavin called down to him, lying.When I dont report in, theyll send a team to see what happened to me.You dont want that.Let me go, and   The twisted man threw a lever Gavin hadnt noticed before, and Gavin dropped.The ground rushed up at him.His stomach lurched, and Gavin yelled.At the last moment, the twisted man threw the lever again and Gavin jerked to a stop five feet above the ground.His ankles burned with pain, and the headache sloshed hot lead inside his skull.I think he has no idea who I am.The twisted clockworker pressed a scarred hand to Gavins upturned cheek in a strangely tender caress.The gesture created an odd convergence of opposites.Gavins captor stood firmly on the ground.His body was as twisted and warped as his trees, his face was scarred beneath greasy, sparse hair, and he wore a filthy robe that looked like it had once belonged to a monk.Muddy hazel eyes peered at his captive.Gavin had even features, white blond hair, and blue eyes.His black shirt and trousers contrasted sharply with his fair skin and hair, and his fingers were straight and strong.The clockworker cocked his head, as if hearing a voice or voices.Then maybe he should look around and try to remember who I am.Maybe he should.Gavin considered socking the clockworker, but discarded the idea bad leverage, and even if he managed to knock the other man unconscious, he would still be trapped in the shackles.His earlier fear gnawed at him again, mingling with the pain.Now that he was lower, he could see nearby a large stone worktable littered with wicked looking gardening tools, a large control panel bristling with levers, dials, and lights, and, incongruously, a brass and glass pistol.A power cable trailed from the stock and ended in a large battery pack.Listen, Gavin said with growing desperation, I can help you.I can   The man turned Gavin, forcing him to look at the trees.I dont know if he remembers.Maybe he will if I point out that the forest is old but the greenhouse is new.What do you all think?What are you talking about?It was useless to argue with clockworkers the disease that stoked their brains also lubricated their grip on reality but Gavin couldnt help himself.You arent making   One of the trees moved.It actually leaned down and in, as if to get a closer look at Gavin.The blue blossoms shifted, and a glint of brass caught the light.Long wires and strips of metal ran up the bark.Gavins breath caught in his throat.For a moment, time flipped backward, and he was fleeing through a blur of leaves and branches that were actively trying to kill him.A tall, bearded clockworker in an opera cloak rode one of the walking trees, steering it by yanking levers and pressing pedals.His partner, Simon, shouted something as Gavin spun and fired the electric rifle attached to the battery pack on his back.LArbre Magnifique, Gavin whispered.This is his forest.But the greenhouse wasnt here before, and you arent him.I heard him mention my father, LArbre Magnifique, the clockworker said.But I dont believe he asked my name.He paused again.Yes, that was indeed rude of him.He should know my name is Antoine.Gavins mouth went dry.Fantastic.What were the odds of two clockworkers showing up in the same family, or that Gavin would run into both of them in one lifetime?The shackles continued to bite into his ankles with iron teeth.Look, Antoine, your father is alive and well, Gavin said, hoping he was telling the truth.In London.We gave him a huge laboratory and he invents great uh, inventions all day long.I can take you to him, if you want.Antoine spun Gavin back around and slugged him high in the stomach.The air burst from Gavins lungs.Pain sank into him, and he couldnt speak.Ah, Antoine said.Do you think I hurt him?I do.Another pause, with a glance at the trees.No, it was not as painful as watching him kidnap my father.He turned his back to Gavin and gestured at one of the towering trees.That is true.My father only taught me to work with plants.I will teach myself how to work with meat.Slowly.An object flashed past Gavins face and landed soundlessly on the grass where Antoine couldnt see.It was a perfect saucer of glass, perhaps two feet in diameter.Startled, Gavin looked up toward the faraway ceiling in time to see a brass cat, claws extended, leap through a new hole in the roof.The cat fell straight down and crashed into some bushes a few feet away.Antoine spun.What was that?It took Gavin a moment to realize Antoine was talking to him and not the trees.It was my stomach growling, he gasped through the pain.Dont you feed your prisoners?A string of saliva hung from Antoines lower lip.Yes.I feed them to my forest.The leaves on the lower bushes parted, and the brass cat slipped under the worktable, out of Antoines field of view.It gave Gavin a phosphorescent green stare from the shadows.A ray of hope touched Gavin.Your father is a genius, Antoine, he said earnestly.A true artist.Queen Victoria herself said so.The trees whispered among themselves, and a storm crossed Antoines face.You are right!He should never mention that horrible womans name, not when her Third Ward agents took my father away from me!Simon and I captured a tree with him, remember?The tree turned out to be really useful, Gavin continued, a little too loudly.The pain from the punch was fading a little, but his ankles still burned.It helped us track down a clockworker who hurt a lot of people.Another glance at the trees.Ah, yes.I miss Number Eight, too.What?No, I have definitely improved your design since then.Look at yourselves.I can make you blossom and create seedlings that grow their own metal frameworks, if only you have enough minerals in your roots.The entire forest will walk at my command!I only need more money.Money to buy more metal for my hungry trees.Through the hole in the roof flew a small whirligig, its propeller twirling madly to keep it aloft.It trailed a rope.The whirligig zipped down to a support beam close to the ground and grabbed it with six spidery limbs, leaving the slanted rope behind it.Two of the trees creaked and leaned sideways, as if they were searching for something.Antoine, sensitive to their moods, started to turn.The unnatural position of Gavins arms started new pains in his shoulders.The aches made Gavins concentration waver, and he had to force himself to speak up and divert Antoines attention.Where are you going to get money?he said.You live in a forest.Distracted, Antoine turned his attention back to Gavin.He doesnt know that I will collect a reward for capturing him, yes, I will.But will I play with him first?Also, yes.Gavin froze.What reward?What are you talking about?Is it a large reward?Enormous!Antoine began to pace.The cat watched him intently, and when Antoines twisted back was turned, it bolted out from under the table and took a flying leap onto Gavins back.Its claws sank into Gavins skin, and Gavin sucked in a sharp breath at the pricks and stabs of eighteen claws.Ow!Click!Gavin gasped.Antoine glanced sharply at him, but the cat was hidden from view behind Gavins body.Click?I said Im sick, Gavin managed.Who could be offering a reward for me?Ive been in France only a few days.That would be Lieutenant Susan Phipps.Gavins blood chilled.No, he whispered.Ah.Did you see the way I frightened my new subject?A pause, and his expression turned churlish.But I should be allowed to play before I turn him over to Lieutenant Phipps.Just a little.Just enough.What about Alice?Gavin couldnt help blurting.Is there a reward for her, too?Would I like to double the reward?Click the cat climbed higher just as Antoine snaked out a hand and pulled Gavin closer by his hair, which gave Gavin an excuse to yelp in pain.Where is your little baroness?At that moment, a woman in a brown explorers shirt, trousers, and gloves slid through the hole in the roof and down the slanted rope.Her hair was tucked under a pith helmet, and her belt sported a glass cutlass.Her expression was tight, like a dirigible that might explode.Alice Michaels.Oh God.Gavins chest constricted and he felt a mixture of love and alarm, devotion and dread.He was so glad to see her he wanted to go limp with relief even as he was terrified the clockworker would capture her as well.We split up, Gavin gasped, too aware of the cat on his back.What the hell was the damned thing doing?Right after we left England.The Third Ward was chasing us and we decided it would be safer.Youll never find her.Do I believe him?No, I do not.Do I think his Alice is somewhere nearby?Yes, I   MONSEIGNEUR!boomed one of the trees.MONSEIGNEUR!ROCAILLEUX!Everything happened at once.Antoine snatched up the brass pistol from the worktable.Click scrambled up Gavins legs to his ankles and extended a claw into the shackles.Alice whipped the glass cutlass free with one hand and sliced the rope below her.Clinging to the top piece like a liana vine, she swung downward.With a clack, Gavins shackles came open and he dropped to the ground, barely managing to tuck and roll so he wouldnt hit his head.Antoine fired the pistol at Alice.Yellow lightning snapped from the barrel.Thunder smashed through the greenhouse.An anguished shout tore itself from Gavins throat.The bolt missed its target, and four windows shattered.Alice landed several yards away from the circle of trees, stumbled, regained her feet in waist high shrubbery.Click dropped to the ground in front of Gavin.Antoine took aim at Alice again.Now enraged, Gavin tried to come to his feet, but his legs, chained for too many hours, gave way.Instead, he snatched up Click and threw.Click landed on Antoines head with a mechanical yowl.Antoines arm jerked.The pistol spoke, and thunder slammed the air as the yellow bolt tore through the top of one of the trees.Another window shattered.ROCAILLEUX, the tree cursed.To a tree, anything rocky was bad.Alice crashed through the bushes toward Antoine, who was still struggling with Click.Blood flowed from a dozen tiny cuts on the clockworkers face and head.He finally managed to fling the cat aside and bring the pistol around on her.Alice!Gavins heart wrenched with terror for her.Already he could envision the smoking hole in her chest.Antoines finger tightened on the trigger.Without pausing in her stride, Alice swung the glittering cutlass and severed the power cable.It spat sparks and dropped to the ground like a dying electric snake.A magnificent move, and Gavin grinned.But instead of hesitating, Antoine swung the barrel of the pistol.It clipped Alice on the side of the head, and she stumbled.Pute!Antoine snarled.Do I care if I get a reward for her alive?No, I do not!Angered again, Gavin wrenched himself to his feet and rushed at Antoine, but the clockworker was ready, and stiff armed Gavin in the chest.Antoine looked old, but he was actually young and strong and gifted with heightened reflexes by the disease that was also burning through his brain.Gavin possessed similar strength and reflexes, but he was still hobbled by his hours in shackles, and he staggered back.Alice recovered herself, but instead of going for Antoine, she ran for one of the brass limned trees.Antoine snatched up a set of huge hedge trimming shears and flipped a switch.They chattered and chopped as he ran toward her, foam and spittle trailing from his mouth.Alice scrambled up the tree.Antoine swung the shears and gouged out a chunk of brass and bark just below her boot.ROCAILLEUX, the tree said.Knives and needles slashed Gavins sore muscles, but he ignored them and forced himself to move.He slammed into Antoine from behind, stopping the clockworker from swinging the shears again but not knocking him over.Instead, Antoines plague enhanced reflexes allowed him to spin and jab at Gavin.The shears snapped at Gavins arm, and he barely yanked it out of the way.Air puffed past his fingers as the blades closed.He grabbed Antoines wrist and twisted, hoping to force him to drop the shears, but Antoine was stronger than he looked and Gavins stiff muscles continued to disobey him.Antoine slowly forced the shears back around until the blades were snapping at Gavins neck.A warm drop of saliva dribbled from Antoines mouth onto Gavins cheek.Will the boy pay?he hissed.He will!The tree Alice had climbed creaked and bent.Gavin!Down!At Alices shout, Gavin relaxed and let himself fall.It never occurred to him not to.He dropped to the grass, leaving Antoine standing above him.One of the trees branches swung around at chest height.Gavin caught the surprise on Antoines face just before the tree swept him aside like a toy soldier knocked off a table.Hurry!Alice called.Climb up.Gavin struggled to his feet and jumped onto the lowered branch.Click followed, his claws digging into the bark and offering a clear advantage over Gavin, who had to cling as best he could while the branch hauled him up to the main trunk.Alice, surrounded by pedals, cranks, levers, and pulleys, was seated on a bench built into the wood.She spun one of the cranks, and the tree straightened again.Then she grabbed the front of Gavins shirt and pulled him down for a long kiss.The world stopped for a moment.The pain in Gavins body receded, and Alices warm lips pressing against his own made him feel both safe and calm, even as they stole his very breath.He kissed her back, so thankful to see her that tears came to his eyes.They parted.Thats for being alive when I came to get you, Alice said, then slapped him lightly on the cheek.And thats for getting captured and scaring me half to death in the first place.I love you, too.Gavin said.Now, run!Hell recover in a minute, and Im not up for fighting him.I dont suppose you brought Dr.Clefs power gun.Too heavy to carry down the rope, darling.Alice held out an arm and whistled.The whirligig buzzed in and settled on her shoulder.Click took up a position on the bench beside her.Were safe for the moment anyway.These trees dont move unless you tell them to.Do you want to drive?I never handled the original Tree back home.Below, Antoine had already regained his feet and was staggering toward the worktable.Antoine can control them from the ground, Gavin said tersely.Go!Go now!Alice didnt hesitate or ask for further explanation, which was one of the many reasons Gavin loved her.She hauled ropes and yanked levers.The tree stomped forward on a bifurcated trunk that ended in balled roots.Antoine reached the worktable and the control panel.Alice stomped another step forward, and another.She had nearly cleared the ring of mutated trees.Will I kill them?Antoine screamed from the control panel.Will I?Hes losing his mind, Gavin observed as Alice worked.Hes not even answering his own questions.Antoines hands moved swiftly over the panel, flipping levers and twisting dials.A low pitched hum throbbed through the earth and vibrated even the tree.FEUILLU, said the tree.Is that French for leafy?Gavin asked.Yes, Alice said.He must like the vibrations.I find them most uncomfortable.Its a very low C, said Gavin.You and your perfect pitch.Good heavens, how I missed you, darling.Antoine yanked a large lever, and all the other trees snapped to attention.Destroy them!Uh oh, Gavin said.Can you move faster?The tree is trying to follow Antoines orders instead of mine, Alice replied grimly.But I seem to be getting the hang of it.The tree picked up speed even as the other trees four of them turned as one and stomped in Alices wake.Alice, for her part, was guiding their own tree straight toward the perimeter of the glassy greenhouse.Gavin clung to the branch with white fingers.The noise was incredible.Heavy trees thudded across the ground like an army of gods, the vibrations that controlled the others throbbed in Gavins bones, and Antoines shrieks chased them faster than a flock of ravens.Its still fighting me, Alice shouted.Her arms and legs worked the controls in a blur.It wants to do what the others are doing.How are we going to get out of here?Gavin called over the noise.I dont see a door.Cover your eyes!was all Alice said.ROCAILLEUX, screamed the tree.They hit the greenhouse wall.Glass exploded in a thousand directions, and Gavin lurched forward.His feet left the branch, and he was flying through the air.The tree hadnt smashed completely through, and its top third was caught on the remains of the greenhouse.Gavin tumbled forward, but the clockwork plague suddenly took over.The universe slowed.Green leaves and glittering glass surrounded him like strange snowflakes.Just below him were the trees branches, and he was aware of the drag coefficient of the bark, which places would slow him down and by how much.He saw every bump and nub, every side branch and twig, and his brain instantly mapped out a route that would take him to safety.Behind him floated Alice, and he calculated the arc of her flight pattern as well, then readjusted his own route accordingly.The universe burst back into motion, and his body, finally free of its earlier stiffness, turned the dive into controlled leaps and jumps down the trees branches until he came to rest on solid ground outside the greenhouse exactly where he wanted.Then he whirled and caught Alice.Her helmet flew on without her and cracked against a boulder.Gavin nearly went over backward, but just managed to keep his feet with Alice in his arms.Thank God.He held her tight, feeling her heart pound against his chest.The universe could come to a complete stop now, and he wouldnt mind in the slightest.Thank you, kind sir, she gasped, pushing a lock of tousled honey brown hair out of dark brown eyes.That quite took my breath away.Clockwork reflexes, Gavin said.I should be in a circus.The tree was now standing with its lower branches sticking out of the glittering greenhouse, while the upper part was still trapped inside.Behind it stampeded the other trees.Click trotted out of the wreckage, his metal ears back, and the whirligig whizzed overhead, unhurt.Now what?Gavin asked, setting Alice down.You do have a plan, right?She took his hand.Yes: run!A rutted dirt road twisted through the woods ahead of them, and they sprinted down it.The late summer breeze should have been uncomfortably warm, but it felt refreshing after the hot, still air of the greenhouse.Behind them, glass smashed and tinkled as the trees hit the side of the greenhouse, but they were tangling up with one another, and they were further hampered by the fact that all of them were making the exact same motions under Antoines control.Gavin, Alice, and the two little machines rounded a bend in the road, leaving the greenhouse and its howling inhabitant behind.Why didnt you have Click cut an exit at ground level instead of coming in through the ceiling?Gavin puffed.The glass is thicker at the base to support weight, Alice pointed out.Its thin on the roof.So where are Dr.Clef and the Lady?Shouldnt they be ?A crackling crash brought them up short.From out of the trees beside the road about fifteen feet ahead of them burst a pair of mechanicals.They were nearly two stories tall, with squat, round builds, heavy legs, long arms, and gleaming brass skin.A glass bubble enclosed the top of each.Inside one rode a young man with dark, curly hair that peeked out from around his hat, and inside the other sat a woman in a long skirt, puffy white blouse, and fashionably small hat.The man pointed one of his mechanicals arms at Gavin, and the hand ended in an impressively large gun barrel.Aw, no, Gavin groaned.Simon, Glenda you arent serious.Surrender, Gavin.You too, Alice, said Simon dArco into a speaking tube.His voice, carried outside the bubble, sounded tinny and distant.Weve got you, the woman added in a similarly tinny voice.And you know it.I know nothing of the sort, Glenda, Alice shot back.What if we tell you to piss off, Simon?Gavin said.Are you going to shoot me?Squash me?We were partners in the Ward for months.And you were half in love with me, he added silently.You destroyed the Ward, Gavin, Simon said.Its gone now.The Queen herself disbanded it.Our last mission is to arrest you for treason and bring you back for trial.Now that youve released that cure, Glenda added, well have no more clockworkers to hunt down.The few we have are dead or dying.And millions of other people will live, Alice replied hotly.I dont regret it for a moment.You thought of nothing but yourselves, Glenda snapped, showing some agitation.Nothing!The Ward was everything to me, Alice.I gave you a chance with the Ward and with Gavin, and this is how you repay me?Were not going back to England, Simon, Gavin said.So are you ready to shoot me?He doesnt have to shoot you, said a voice that made Gavin stiffen.He only has to delay you.Just like Antoine did, and admirably.From the trees stepped a second woman.Her black hair, only slightly streaked with silver, was pulled into a twist.She wore a blue uniform with hat, boots, and epaulets.The coat was cut to show her left arm, which was entirely mechanical.It also had six fingers.Her name was Lieutenant Susan Phipps.In the name of Her Royal Majesty and the Third Ward, Phipps said, I place you both under arrest for sedition, treason, and attempted murder.No, Gavin said, though some of the bravado had left him.Phipps by herself was more imposing than even two agents in mechanicals.He made himself stand upright, though he was sweating under his arms.Sorry, Lieutenant Susan but we all know that Glenda and Simon arent going to hurt us.We saved you from that doomsday invention Alices aunt dropped on headquarters.I dont mean to sound disrespectful, but it wasnt very smart to bring those two.You should have brought someone who doesnt know us.Theyre loyal, Phipps said, unruffled, and wont disappoint me.Unlike some.Gavin couldnt help flinching at that.When Gavin was only seventeen and stranded in London, Phipps had offered him a position as an agent of the Third Ward.She had seen him through his training, encouraged him, opened doors for him.She had lifted him out of the gutter and handed him the keys to the world, and he had betrayed her.Im sorry, maam, Gavin said.Look, Im not happy about what I   Oh, shut it, Gavin, Alice interrupted.We learned the Empire had been keeping the cure locked away to ensure the plague continues creating clockwork geniuses.You let thousands of people die excruciating deaths, Phipps, and have no right to debate morality.Thousands more will die because you released the cure, Phipps said.Because of you, China will have clockworkers for much longer than we, easily long enough to take over the world, and that conflict will cost countless British lives.So come quietly, or come noisily.It makes no difference.Noisily?Gavin said.What do you mean by ?Phipps reached into her pockets with both hands and came up with a pair of tuning forks.Gavins eye automatically measured their length and thickness with clockwork precision.When struck, they would produce the notes D and A flat.For the second time that day, his blood chilled.Run!Alice screamed, but it was too late.Phipps clanged the forks together.The two notes rang down the road.Dual vibrations tore ugly ripples through the air faster than Gavin could react, and the discordant interval, a tritone, slammed into his brain.The noise made its own string of numbers inside his head, and they spun around him, refusing to coalesce into anything that made sense.A tritone has, at its base, the square root of two, and it is the only musical interval that is expressed as an irrational number, a number that does not truly exist, and yet at that moment it did exist in the sound Gavin was hearing.The paradox that he could hear so clearly tore at his mind and made his head dizzy with pain.He clapped his hands over his ears, but the sound was too loud to shut out.He was vaguely aware of Alice shouting something, and he heard clunky mechanical footsteps.Hard metal hands scooped him up.The tritone began to fade, then clanged again, and Gavin cried out in fresh pain as an explosion rocked his body.Chapter Two  Gavin landed hard.The terrible tritone faded, and the mind numbing pain and dizziness went with it.Dust clogged his mouth and nose.Coughing and spitting, he levered himself upright.A great hole, perhaps ten feet across, had appeared in the road.Gavin lay on one side with Alice and Click and the little whirligig.Phipps and the two Ward agents were on the other.Glendas mechanical was sitting down like a toddler who had lost its balance and landed on its backside.Phipps had kept her feet, but she had lost one of the tuning forks.That was one good thing, at least.That is called a warning shot, bellowed a voice from above.I believe my energy cannon can manage another.The boom may not be so large or exciting, but it will suffice.Over the road and just above the trees hovered a familiar dirigible the size of a generous cottage.A gondola shaped like an unmasted sailing ship hung from a cigar shaped envelope that was clearly too small to provide enough lift for such a mass.A lacy blue endoskeleton Gavin had forged and bent himself glowed like captured sky beneath the envelopes thin skin, and a long rope dangled from the stern, which sported the words The Lady of Liberty.Leaning over the gunwale was a portly man in a white coat and heavy goggles over a bulldog face.He was pointing a small cannon down at the road.Phipps, Glenda, and Simon didnt move.A river of relief swept over Gavin.Dr.Clef!he shouted.Youre my favorite German.Very glad to see you are safe, my boy.Alice looked calm and unruffled, but Gavin read a symphony of strain holding her upright.I dont suppose, she called up, that you could provide a ladder?Seconds later, one end of a rope ladder tumbled down.Alice clambered up first, and Gavin followed with Click.The whirligig flew.We can still follow you, Phipps shouted up at them.We found you now, and well find you again!Ignoring her, Gavin pulled himself over the edge to join Alice.His shoes came down on solid planking, and he felt some of the tension drain away.The airship, the Lady, was his place, his home.Wood and hemp made their familiar creak as the envelope strained against her ropes, trying to pull the ship higher while her lacy skeleton gleamed a magnificent azure blue.The generator that ran on paraffin oil muttered and mumbled to itself on the deck, emitting steam and feeding a steady stream of power to the Ladys skeleton and to her propellers.Dr.Clef, a clockworker once captured by the Third Ward, had developed the alloy that pushed against gravity when it was electrified, but Gavin had been the one to put it into the envelope of a dirigible.At the helm stood a stocky, sharp faced Oriental dressed in a pirate shirt that suited him perfectly.He was just over eighteen.His trousers were tucked into his boots, and like Alice, he kept a glass cutlass sheathed at his belt.He saluted Gavin with a rakish grin that made him even more handsome than before.No, no, Dr.Clef was calling down.He continued to aim his power cannon at the ground.Dont move, please.My finger trigger, it itches.Thats trigger finger, Gavin said.And you let Feng pilot the Lady?It was that or give him the cannon, Dr.Clef replied mildly.I did consider pulling apart the clicky kittys brain and using it to create a wireless device that would allow me to control the ship from a distance, but the young woman wouldnt hear of it.Bloody right.Alice picked up Click and let the whirligig land on her shoulder.Feng, get us out of here!Which way?said Feng Lung with a trace of China in his words.Any way, as long as its east, Alice said.Feng swung the helm around.The propellers on the Ladys nacelles hanging from the outer hulls whirled to life, and she picked up speed, still trailing the rope.Alice set Click down and pulled it in.You slid all the way down that to get into the greenhouse and rescue me?Gavin said.I must be awfully special.Indeed you are, Mr.Ennock.Alice coiled the rope on the deck, then turned and collapsed into Gavins surprised arms.Her body shook against his, and wet, sloppy tears dampened his shirt.Dont you ever do that to me again, you you cad.His own throat thickened and he held her, clumsily at first, then tightly.Im sorry.Im so sorry.After a moment, he added, What did I do?Alice gave a hiccupping laugh and straightened.Oh, Gavin.Dear God.You scared me half to death, thats what.So true, Feng said from the helm.After you went missing from the hotel, she went mad.Berserk.She would not sleep; she would not eat.When we tracked you to the greenhouse, she almost rammed it with the ship.I insisted to be pilot then.Oh.Im sorry, he said again.Should I write letters in the sky to warn you when Im going to be captured?Certainly.Alice pulled off her leather gloves, revealing a metal spider wrapping her left hand from forearm to fingers.Its legs ended in claws that tipped Alices own nails, and tubules running up and down the spiders legs flowed scarlet with her blood.The dark iron gleamed, and the spiders eyes glowed red, indicating that she had just touched someone infected with the clockwork plague Gavin, in this case.It was another of the daily reminders that he was dying, and it was inextricably linked to the woman he loved.The thought made him both sad and angry, and he wanted to wrench the spider off her, even though he knew it wouldnt work.The spiders joints squeaked slightly as Alice fumbled at her sleeve for a handkerchief, and then she remembered she wasnt wearing a womans blouse.She reached into her pocket for one instead and dabbed at her eyes.Ill kill the next one who captures you.I swear it.Theres going to be a next one?Alice cuffed him lightly on the shoulder, then knelt in front of him to pull up his pant cuffs.If Phipps has her way, there will be.Uh what are you doing?I need to check your ankles.Those horrible chains Antoine kept you in couldnt have been good for them.This will be easier if you sit down.He sank into a deck chair and let her pull off his shoes, wincing as the leather came away from swollen flesh.Alice made a low sound.I wish youd been wearing your boots instead of just shoes, she muttered.They might have protected you better.Does this hurt?She gently massaged his ankles.Yes, he hissed through clenched teeth.But dont stop.She looked up at him, and he saw tenderness in her eyes.It melted the pain and relaxed every muscle in his body.He slumped in the chair, unable to move as her strong, careful fingers went over his feet and worked at the muscles.Oh my God, I love you, he groaned.Always and always.And I love you always, she replied.Even when you blaspheme.You blasphemed just a second   Now you need to explain what happened, starting from the moment Antoine took you.Not yet, Madam.A mechanical man emerged from belowdecks.His features were only painted on, as was his black and white outfit, yet he carried himself as if he were starched and fully clothed.The only hint of expression lay in the flickering firefly lights that made up his eyes.He set a laden tea tray on a deck table beside the spot where Alice knelt.You havent eaten since Sir was captured.And then you must have a massage yourself to ease the tension.Wonderful, Kemp.Dr.Clef rubbed his hands together.Do you have any of those lacy sugar cookies?I have had quite a craving, and the patterns twist through dimensional rifts on golden wings.You have had your tea, Doctor, Kemp said.I will make more if I have time, but I have more important concerns at the moment.The cake and sandwiches on the tray sent up smells that called to Gavins stomach, though he wasnt yet willing to move away from Alices ministrations.What time is it?he asked, trying to get a glimpse of the sun around the envelope.Two fifteen, Kemp replied.Tuesday.Gavin bolted upright, and Alice released his foot.Tuesday?How long was I ?Youve been missing for three days, darling.Alice took a teacup, which rattled in her metallic hand.Its been hell.Three days?Gavin sank back onto the chair and bit into a ham sandwich without really paying attention to it.I thought it was only a night.Antoine has powerful sleep drugs, Feng said.Gavin stared past Alice at calm, blue infinity.He should feel safe, at home in the ship he had created with his own hands.She ignored gravity, soared silent currents, explored the limits of daylight.Set him free.But all he felt was violated, stripped of his clothes and then his skin.He wondered how long he had hung unconscious in Antoines greenhouse, a piece of meat in the hands of a twisted homunculus.His gorge rose, and then he was at the gunwale, the few bites of sandwich falling to the forest far below.The pieces seemed to fall slowly, pushing aside the billions of tiny bits that made up the air.The bits rubbed against the falling pieces and raised their temperature as they fell closer to hell.We could harvest the energy of the pieces, he said.The billions of bits would make a hellfire and cook twisted hunks of homunculus.Sir?Kemp handed him a cup of tea.Gavin swished and spat over the side.The tea spread in both droplets and a stream, both wave and particle.He watched it, an eternity caught in a split second.Then the tea vanished.Wave to particles, he muttered.Wave them away.Alice had had the good sense to keep her seat, though her face tightened as Gavin sat back down in his own chair.Youre talking like a clockworker, she said, her voice heavy with worry.Its already starting, isnt it?Its all mixed up inside me, Alice.He rubbed a hand over his face and tried to cheer up, but the violation and the fear dragged him down.Im sorry.Your aunt knocked me out, locked me in that tower of hers, and infected me with this plague.She treated me like a piece of meat.So did the pirates who captured the Juniper and made me fiddle for them.Now I learn Antoine held me for longer than I knew.He stole time from me, and I dont have time to steal.She took his hand across the tea tray.Well get to China.If anyone can cure clockworkers, they can.The Dragon Men are very powerful, Feng agreed from the helm.They can do anything.Hmm.Dr.Clef opened a chest and unrolled an enormous chart on a table near the helm.Peking is approximately seven thousand miles away, if we fly over Istanbul and the Gobi Desert.We could detour south into India, around the Himalayas, but that would add another four thousand miles or so.This ships top speed is fifty miles per hour.If we travel for twelve hours each day, the journey will take us approximately twelve days.Thats all?Alice said.It doesnt seem like   This is also assuming, Dr.Clef continued, that the ship always travels at top speed it cannot and that we have the wind behind us we do not and that the engines or helium extractors never break down they will and that the sky never sends us any bad weather it shall or that any number of other delays do not delay us.I believe it will take closer to two months, perhaps three.Oh.Alice nibbled her sandwich as a cloud drifted past.Well, that will still be plenty of time.He was infected last May.Its only late August.It is not much time, said Dr.Clef.He is already beginning to babble.You see things, dont you, boy?Beautiful things.Like the universe is handing you its keys, one by one.Gavin thought about his vomit and the falling tea water.Yes.And you love and hate the tritones, Dr.Clef continued.Square root of two, lovely and deadly as infinity.Just the memory of that horrible, enticing number and the brain bending sound that went with it made him shudder.He nodded.I shouldnt be so far along, Gavin said quietly.Dr.Clef shrugged.There is a range.Some clockworkers last only a few months, others last for two or three years.Edwinas version of the plague was experimental, so who knows what it was like?You shouldnt have become a clockworker, but you did.You should have shown no symptoms for several weeks, but you have.Losing yourself and talking about what you see is a sign of the final phase, where I am.You have about three months left.Four months if you are lucky.You will be a raving lunatic by the time we reach Peking, and then Alice will still have to find a Chinese clockworker who can cure you, and that assumes such a clockworker even exists.So you will die, my boy.But dont worry.He clapped Gavin on the shoulder.They say once we clockworkers go completely mad, we do not even know what is happening, and we enjoy it.We can go mad together, yes?Why did you bring him with you?Feng asked.He jumped on board the ship while we were running away from the Third Ward headquarters, Alice said dully.Perhaps I should have kicked him off.No.Gavin straightened.Im not going to give in to this.Well find a way to get to Peking, and well find a Chinese clockworker   Dragon Man, Feng interrupted.We call them Dragon Men.Dragon Man, Gavin continued, who has a cure.If we cant find time, well make time.An odd look came over Dr.Clefs bulldog face.Make time.But we do have a more powerful problem.Feng moved the Ladys helm to adjust for a current.This ship is very easy to see.Many airships fly, but none of them glow blue.Shes very beautiful, Gavin said, feeling defensive.The motor gave a pleased sounding hiccup and went back to its normal quiet murmur.True.But beauty has its price, Feng said.Hers is that she attracts attention.Also, if Third Ward agents are spreading word and money to look for us, we have more trouble.How do they do it so quickly?Several clockworkers in England and in Europe invented wireless communication devices, Gavin said.You can send messages at the speed of light to any other wireless device that listens to the same frequency.Theyre better than a telegraph because you dont need to raise poles or string wires.We cant outrun such a message, Feng pointed out.As it is, we lost three days when you were captured.I imagine that was what your Lieutenant Phipps wanted to catch us up.It is fortunate she seems to have no airship.Yeah.Well have to think of some way to hide better.I just wish we had more time.You said that.Alice set her cup down with a clink of metal on china and came around behind his chair to put her arms around his neck.The iron gauntlet was chilly.And youre right, darling.Well find a way.Well find time.Her touch made him feel better, despite the spider.Even though he was barely nineteen and she was twenty three, he felt no difference in their ages.Alice had been initially put off by it.The gap had been one of the reasons she had resisted admitting she loved him.Gavin touched Alices hand, letting himself drink in her steady presence.And she was so beautiful.Her deep brown eyes set off her honey brown hair, and her triangle face and little nose and rounded curves all came together like the parts of an intricate fugue, compelling and hypnotic.He still found it hard to believe she was with him and that it had taken her so long to break societys rules and leave her horrible fiance.She leaned down.Her scent wafted over him, and he kissed her softly in the free and open sky.The kiss intensified, and a thrill went through him.He could do this.He could conquer the whole damned world, as long as Alice Michaels stood beside him.Very sweet, Feng said, breaking the moment.But I have no idea where I am going.They broke away and Alice coughed, a bit flushed.Id help, but I never learned how to read a navigation chart.Right.Gavin got up and took the charts away from Dr.Clef, who was now staring into the distance.My Impossible Cube had time, he muttered.All of it.At once.But you destroyed it, my boy.My lovely, lovely Impossible Cube.Not this again.Alice sighed.Click!Click jumped down from his vantage point on the gunwale and strolled over to rub against Dr.Clefs shins.A mechanical purr drifted across the deck.Dr.Clef glanced down.Ah, you send me the clicky kitty as a distraction.It will not work.I am so very forlorn.Still, he picked the cat up and stroked the metal ears.It wont work at all, will it, clicky kitty?It will not.It will not.Germans are so good at despondent, Gavin observed.He pored over the charts.If we keep our current course, well reach Luxembourg by tomorrow.I know the place it gets a lot of airship traffic, and the Juniper stopped there several times.Do you think the other airships will give us camouflage?Alice asked.Honestly?No.Gavin gestured at the softly glowing envelope.She stands out, even among airships, and the envelope isnt big enough to lift her without turning on the generator.Then why did you build your ship this way?Feng asked.Youre such a clicky kitty, Dr.Clef cooed.You are.Gavins stomach turned over.Because I could.You dont think about consequences when youre in a a clockwork fugue.You just build.I didnt even know I was a clockworker when I built the Lady.I thought I just had insomnia.Whatever the reason, we have a conspicuous ship, Alice said, and the Third Ward is spreading word of a generous reward for our capture.Is the clicky kitty hungry?Would he like a saucer of arsenic?Gavin sighed and leaned over the gunwale, the fresh breeze on his face, solid wood beneath his bare feet.Forests and fields stretched to the horizon, emerald meeting azure, broken only by a railroad that ribboned through the green.Alice joined him.What are you thinking?That youre right.The ship is too conspicuous, he said.Were too conspicuous.You have that gauntlet that wont come off.Feng is Chinese.Dr.Clef is Dr.Clef.And we have all these automatons.I mean, you can order Kemp to stay hidden   We have to for at least a while, Alice interrupted.Human seeming automatons are illegal on most of the Continent.Only in the western part, Gavin said, where the Catholic Church is powerful.Once you get past the four French Kingdoms and the ten Prussian Kingdoms into Poland and the Ukrainian Empire, no one cares.Oh.Alice looked miffed that she hadnt known this.Kemp will be glad to hear that.But I was saying that Click has a way of showing up wherever he wants, Gavin continued.Were a very distinctive group, and you know Phipps has described us carefully.Come, clicky kitty, Dr.Clef said.We will go below and you will watch me while I work.Would you like that?You would.If I took such a tone with Click, Feng said to no one in particular, he would disembowel me.Why does he allow Dr.Clef the privilege?A train passed beneath them, puffing smoke and spurting steam.The whistle a G, Gavin noted automatically sounded high and thin up in the air.The locomotive was painted bright red, and the cars sported bright colors as well.It looked like a childs toy.Something about it tugged at him, but he couldnt say what.Well have to figure something out soon, Gavin finished.Luxembourg is the only place nearby where we can stock up on paraffin oil for the generator, and we have to stop there.And the food stores are nearly nonexistent, Kemp added.Madam and everyone else were searching for Sir, and I was not allowed to shop.Thats another worry, Alice said.Money.We dont have much left.The Ward wont be paying our salaries anytime soon, and I rather doubt Norbert would be willing to wire me any money now that Ive left him.Gavin stared across the free sky as tension tightened his muscles again.Even here, on his own ship, problems weighed him down.He wanted needed to leap over the side and coast away with nothing but bright and flowing air beneath him.The clouds twisted in the air currents, droplets hovering like trillions of tiny spirits buoyed by   Alice touched his arm.Youve been staring for a long time.Would you play for me?A long time?He blinked at her.How long?Over an hour.She handed him his bow and fiddle.Maybe this will focus you.Gavin looked around, bewildered.The sun had moved a considerable distance.Dr.Clef, Click, and Alices whirligig were nowhere to be seen.Only Feng remained, still at the helm.Gavin looked down at his fiddle.It had been his constant companion ever since he could remember.His inborn perfect pitch let him pick up songs almost instantly, which meant he was able to play street corners in Boston at an early age and bring the pennies home to his mother and siblings.He had secretly fantasized that one day he would play in a music hall or even in an orchestra.But later, on his twelfth birthday, Gramps had brought him down to the Boston shipyards and introduced him to Captain Felix Naismith of the Juniper.From that day on, cabin boy Gavin Ennock had barely touched the ground while he played for airmen and ran their errands.Then came the attack.In seconds, both Naismith and Gavins best friend were dead and Gavin was forced to perform for pirates.They had stranded him in London.Unable to find work on another airship, hed gone back to playing the streets for pennies until Alices aunt had snatched him away and locked him in her tower.For three weeks, hed had nothing to do but play the violin until Alice had appeared and rescued him.And then he had rescued her, and then she him, and so it went.He drew his bow over the strings and was about to begin when Alice abruptly held up a hand.For a dreadful moment, he thought hed made a mistake and she was stopping him.It was one of his secret fears that hed made a mistake while playing where someone could hear.His playing, like his pitch, needed to be perfect.It often felt as if someone were watching over him, waiting to pounce if he played wrong, though he couldnt say why.But Alice said only, A moment.I want to try something first.From her pocket, she took a small bird made of gleaming silver.Sapphires made up its eyes and glowed softly at the tips of its claws.My nightingale, Feng said.Yours now, Gavin.I am glad Antoine did not get it.I found it in the hotel.Alice set the bird at Gavins feet and pressed its left eye.Now, play.Gavin nodded and swung into a song familiar to all airmen.He played a verse, relieved when he got through it with no mistakes, then sang.For to see Mad Tom of Bedlam, ten thousand miles I traveled  Mad Maudlin goes on dirty toes to save her shoes from gravel.Still I sing bonny boys, bonny mad boys, bedlam boys are bonny  For they all go bare and they live by the air, and they want no drink nor money.Tom of Bedlam was the unofficial song of airmen everywhere.The idea that men who lived by the air went naked and didnt want for drink or money held immense appeal, and the songs infinite verses were made for pounding out on wooden decks.Gavin started to sing the second verse when Alice jumped in herself:  No gypsy, slut, or clockwork shall win my mad Tom from me  Ill weep all night, with stars Ill fight, and the fray shall well become me.Gavin laughed and joined in for the chorus.Still I sing bonny boys, bonny mad boys, bedlam boys are bonny  For they all go bare and they live by the air, and they want no drink nor money.The orange sun sank to the horizon and shadows snaked among the trees below.The sputter and hum of the generator continued beneath Gavins music as he played and sang his way through Bedlam with Alice clapping her hands to the beat beside him.
