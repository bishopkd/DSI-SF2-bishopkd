Onor asked.Why help us?Because there is no one else for me to talk to.You will be like me.Cast off and strange.I understand the math of star travel, and that you were gone from here for generations of humans.You are a small society, too small and too poor in resources to have changed much from when you left.The speed of change increases with the size of the network.What?Marcelle asked.The more people interact with each other, the faster cultural change happens.Change is driven by volume of information.Ruby broke in this time.Im still not sure I understand.If we had a ship with three times as many people on it, we would change faster?There was a machines breath pause before the answer came back.A little.But since the bigger the network grows, the faster the change happens, you would not see much of a difference.The Fire has thousands of people, at most, right?Yes.Adiamo has trillions of people.He understood the size of the number from a lesson in math class years ago, before they became adults.Numbers like that had been used to represent distances, or the number of stars in the universe.But numbers of people?You have been gone for years of your time, for generations.The Fire has travelled far and most of its journey has been at more than halfway to the speed of light.And in that time, humanity has gone beyond what you appear to understand.So there will not be anyone like us?Marcelle asked.I have never seen anyone like you, nor talked to anyone who understands as little.As soon as they were through the door, they all started jabbering at Ix.Did you know how many people were there?Did you know about numbers of people and change?Is it lying?Are there really that many people?The rumor Onor had been most afraid was true had been that they were all dead, and the Fire was flying back to someplace empty and cold.Ix replied.I am learning about this system as we speak, and have been since we got close enough to get information about it.It truly is different from when we left.Rubys helmet was off now, her long red hair sweaty and mussed and her face white.So our classes havent helped anyone.Theyve been lies.Ix said, Theyve been history lessons.He could see Ruby bite her tongue.No use fighting with the machine.It always had a better way to fight back.Now all their helmets were off, and they stood in the corridor in their suits.It was talking down to us, Marcelle said.Ruby shook her head.No.Aleesi is actually very simple.In many ways, she isnt as smart or as subtle as we are.But there are things she knowslike that bit about network effectsthat we dont even know the questions for.Thats why I keep coming back.Marcelle asked, Did you know how many people are there?We hadnt put that number to it, but we knew it was a lot.Think about it.Remember that picture of Diamond Deep?Its hundreds of times bigger than the Fire, maybe thousands.And the Fire has a lot more cargo space than people space.Antony, another one of Joels guards, came around the corner.Ruby seemed to be expecting him.Just a moment.Let me change into my uniform.She started stripping off the rest of her suit.Whoever designed this place should have put a shower right here, she muttered.Marcelles laughter broke the worries that hed left the cargo bay with, and he laughed, too.Not as good as running, but anything to release the thought of trillions of people.After theyd all changed, Ruby left Onor and Marcelle hanging their suits up in the locker closest to the cargo bay.He watched Rubys back as she walked away beside Antony.Marcelles hair was mussed from the suit and she looked worn out.Are you okay?he asked her.Walk with me to the cargo bars?Marcelle asked him.I was too nervous to eat before we went in there.Of course.Did you get what you wanted from going in there?She rummaged in the pack shed left stuck in a cubby on the locker, coming up with a hairbrush and starting in on her sweat damped hair.I wanted to be brave.I expected to hate her, to want to kill her when I stood in front of her.Or to be scared.She would have killed us if she could, at least on that first day.So I cantreallyfeel sorry for her.But it is a little pathetic.I wouldnt have chosen that word.She put her brush away and shouldered her pack.Lets go.What would you call it?Dangerous.Yes, but I like pathetic better.Its easier to think of it that way.Her that way.They started down the corridor.I didnt understand everything she said, Marcelle said.We learned how different we are from everything here.I knew that the minute we saw six robots bigger than habs scuttle into the cargo bay.He walked next to her, debating whether or not to take her arm.Have you got your assignment for docking day yet?Im on peacekeeping in common.C pod.Really?Did you ask for that?She was a good warrior; she should stand on the front lines.Hopefully, defense would be for show, but still, it was the respectful place to put someone who had been by Rubys side so long, and who had become a squad leader in practices.I want to be with the people.And with the families.You could be with us.I know.Im just feeling tender about our people.Everything is going to change, and faster than we want.What happens if we never see each other again after we dock?Ruby and Joel will keep us together.He straightened.And well keep us together.She put an arm around his waist, pulled him close to her.She was his sizewell, his height.It felt good to be walking beside her.He put an arm around her as well, resting his hand on her waist where he could feel the glide of her muscles as she walked.It wasnt a commitment, but the damned robot always seemed to drive him closer to Marcelle.Marcelle fell silent as they walked through the corridors.She seemed as awkward as he felt, her gait a little stiff.She didnt look at him.I have a reason not to be up front.What?Im pregnant.30     Ruby had done her best to turn docking day into a party while Joels instinct was to use it as a military exercise.The result looked like an ideological fight had splashed itself across the map room.Everyoneeven Rubywore the new uniforms.Serving robots squeaked through the few spaces between people with trays of fresh fruit from the gardens and crackers and cookies from the kitchens.Ix played images of their approach to Diamond Deep on the map table.To Rubys irritation, Ix had become unresponsive when questioned.They were close enough now that the station itself couldnt be seen in whole.It appeared as a large black structure against the black of space, edged in blinding white lights.The best thing that could be said about the image was that the station loomed.The worst was that it looked ready to consume the Fire.Other people seemed to feel the same way.Some gathered in groups and watched the image in short little glimpses.SueAnne stared as if mesmerized.KJ and his dancers seemed to be everywhere.Jaliet had managed to turn her own version of the uniform into a fashion statement by tucking it here and there and threading the multiple joined colors of the Fire through several tight braids in her black hair.Most of the men looked serious.Drinks abounded, all of them water or stim.Joel had ordered nothing but light food and drink, a choice Ruby had supported.She wanted the feel of a party; not the reality of one.The moment felt full of crushing import.Ruby circulated, taking hands, murmuring encouragement, and doing her best to look brave.The Fire felt wrong.Its engines had shut down two days ago, but it still creaked and popped, the noises more pronounced than before.Ruby stopped next to SueAnne and watched beside her.The opening they were about to enter had been built for them in the week between their agreement to dock here and now.She had seen metal changedfiled or welded or heated and shaped.This had sprung from nothing, as if metal could be created out of air.They grew that, she muttered.They grew a cage for us.SueAnne gave her a slightly surprised look, her dark blue eyes lost in wrinkles.Perhaps they grew a home for us.Ruby put an arm around SueAnnes slightly stooped shoulders.I hope so.They have power and knowledge.I suspect they will not share those easily.SueAnne chewed on her lower lip.Her gaze returned once again to the looming station.I used to hate you, she told Ruby.Ruby stiffened, but waited.I hated you for being young and strong, and for starting the fighting.I hated you for wanting things you werent supposed to have.She fell silent for a moment.I still dont approve of fighting, she fingered her new gray uniform, but Im glad to have Joel in charge and you beside him.We may need your courage.Thank you.Ruby whispered.Thank you for saying that.Its been hard to feel accepted.Dont assume you are.Most of Joels advisors believe you are evil on three accounts.You are gray, you are young, and you are a woman.They allow you into their councils.But you note I am the only woman, and that is because I helped Joel gain his following.My power rests on his acceptance of me.Ruby chewed on her bottom lip.They accept you because of him.And they are insanely jealous of him because of you.31     Onor stuck close to Joel after the Fire ceased moving.Joel looked tired, but then they all must look that way.They had gathered hours ago, eaten lightly, and waited far longer than they expected.Ix remained silent, which made it seem like they were missing a key part of themselves, and needed to be extra vigilant.Onor scanned faces, checking the location of everyone and looking for anything out of place.He had done this twenty times already, but he forced himself to see it as freshly as he could.Whatever was about to happen, the visitors from the Diamond Deep would form their first impression of the people of the Fire based on this meeting.Jaliet, Ani, and Ruby had transformed the room.Theyd covered the worn seating in green cloth.Hand sewn rainbows made from old uniforms lined the bottom of bench.In a few places the decorations had begun to sag.He gestured to Haric, who was following Ruby as if he were a five year old after his mother.The boy started toward him, elbowing through people.Marcelle was not here, of course.She had chosen to work in the creche.He had to think about her pregnancy, but his mind kept refusing to wrap itself around the idea.He would think about it a lot later.He had to.Haric slid through two large men to stand in front of Onor, white faced and pale.He stood straight and looked like he wanted to be brave.Maybe they all looked like that.Onor leaned down and asked Haric, Can you fix up the decorations?Ix whispered.Its time.Onor had never heard Ix whisper, or heard a whisper be so amplified.He turned.They all turned.Haric stayed beside him.The door opened.Allen, Conroy, and two of Allens men that Onor recognized came in first.They were followed by a silvery being that moved like a dancer, as smooth as the finest material Onor had ever touched.He had thought the robot spiders beyond them, the materials and engineering out of reach.This was unimaginable.Two people followed.They wore form fitting uniforms that shimmered when light hit them.A woman in fine blues and a man in brilliant oranges.The woman was as beautiful as Ruby, and as young.She had even darker skin than Ani, with long, white hair that hung down her back.He had never seen that color combination, and when she turned to look at him, her eyes were a deep gold.The effect chilled and attracted him.The man was thin and no taller than the woman, brown skinned, with black eyes and hair.But he too looked wrong, the colors of everything about himskin and hair and eyes, while black and brown, still different than the colors Onor was used to seeing on a human.Both people moved as smoothly as KJs dancers, as if they didnt really have to touch the floor but chose to do so.The robot stopped part way into the room and flowed into a standing cylinder.The man and woman stopped beside the robot.Welcome to the Diamond Deep, the woman said.I am Koren Nomen.A gesture from Joel pulled Onor into a ring of six guards who walked behind Ruby and Joel as they approached the delegation.KJ and his dancers stood nearby, in casual stances that belied how lethal they could be.Joel spoke stiffly.Welcome aboard The Creative Fire.I am Captain Joel North and this is Ruby Martin, who represents our crew.Ruby made an expansive gesture with her hands.And these are some of the people of The Creative Fire.Thousands more are working or resting on other levels of the ship.We send you greetings from all of them.We have had a long journey, and we are pleased to be in our home system.The womanKorengave a soft nod.You must be weary.She gestured to the brown man who stood beside her.This is Naveen Tourning.Her hand swept to point at the robot.And this is one of three assistants who will help me perform an inventory and check on your ship.We will stay with you during your quarantine.I am the Deeps Chief Historian.I look forward to learning about your journey.Joels face had stilled, and his voice quieted in a way that Onor knew meant he was evaluating something he was very unhappy about.We are pleased that you will stay with us.We will provide you adequate quarters on this level and we will escort you to see parts of the Fire that might interest you.But we cannot allow your robots to wander at will.Korens smile looked as insincere as Joels.You cannot believe that you own this ship.Ruby stood still and quiet, her back straight.One of her fists had clenched.Joel spoke, his words clipped with buried anger.We are the crew and owners of the Fire.He looked directly at the strange golden eyed woman.You have chosen to dock this ship in a place that Diamond Deep went to great expense to create for you, an expense which you must pay back.You cannot restart your ship from here and leave.It is in no condition to fly anywhere.Her features were unreadable, her voice like poetry edged ever so slightly with disdain.This ship is barely good for salvage.Ruby had stepped closer to Joel.She broke into the conversation, loudly but calmly, speaking for the whole room to hear.We are happy to have arrived in a place where we can learn about the home that we left.We have a history of our own to share.If you are truly a student of history you will want what we offer to be given freely.I do.But do not assume I have control of your future.Naveen and I are emissaries of others.She paused, letting her words sink in.We will speak of this later.Tell us about the quarantine, Ruby asked.What do you mean?Before you can leave the bay we have created for you, you must be scanned for anything that could harm us.This is for your good as well.You could easily be infected by germs from our world, or us by germs from yours.Your AI may only communicate with us via messaging and may not share information freely with our systems.We have disabled some of its higher functions until we can fully evaluate its logic.It is still able to run your life support and essential systems.Ix could be controlled from outside?Ix had been silent because it was trapped?Onor hated Koren for it instantly, a hot intense hatred fueled by disbelief.Ix was their AI.It belonged to the Fire, and its job was to protect them.He was in no position to ask if Ix had consented, but he didnt think so.Ix liked its power.Joel and Ruby stood silently, anger obvious in the tight lines of their jaws.His own body had tensed and heated, and his breath sped up.Koren spoke to them as if she were a green and everyone from The Creative Fire were lowly grays, or children, or both.Even Joel and Ruby.Koren watched them all closely with her odd golden eyes.Surely she knew the effect her words were having.But she continued.Your cargo must be examined.You have come from worlds we have never seen, and there may be dangers in your holds.Like robot spiders from the Edge.Although the woman couldnt know about Aleesi.She must be speaking of the various treasures they had collected at far star systems long before Onors birth, and which were protected in containers and watched over by the people who lived in the cargo bay.After a few moments of the tensest silence Onor had ever felt, Ruby snapped at Koren.What we have brought back from the stars is ours to share with you, not yours to take.Joel put a hand on Rubys arm, as if to quiet her.He smiled his not smile again.We are healthy.We came from here.Surely we share the same genetics.You know nothing of the complexities of a multi species star system full of billions of beings.The danger of contamination is real.Diseases from the Edge can kill us if they are not caught quickly, and our germs can damage humans who inhabit the Edge.And yet only twenty generations separate us from the founders of the Edge.Koren made the word Edge sound like a curse.We are hundreds of generations removed from you.We have evolved.You two came freely to us, Joel observed.Surely if it is that dangerous, you would be speaking to us from your station and not in person.We volunteered.We have formidable medical resources with us.And I am willing to die to learn firsthand of your journey.Onor didnt believe her.Naveen spoke for the first time.And I am here to tell of what we learn, to report out to the Diamond Deep.Many people inside are watching us now.Ix was broadcasting this meeting to all of the commons.Marcelle was hearing it somewhere, probably standing among women and children, bridging warrior and mother.He wished she were here where he could see her, and that she wasnt pregnant.Not now, anyway.Ruby nodded at Koren.We note your interest in our welfare.We are a strong people who came from here and returned.We endured much along the way, us and our ancestors.She paused for effect, standing tall, her red hair framing her face.She was always at her most beautiful when she was angry.We are a fair people.We will be fair and honest to those who are fair and honest toward us.The robot flexed, as if it were reacting to Rubys words, preparing itself in case she chose to launch herself into a physical fight with the golden eyed woman.But of course she did no such thing.Ruby held her ground, not looking away or down.Waiting.Koren bowed to Ruby, looking stiff and perhapsjust perhapsa bit uncertain.The smile on Naveens face looked much more genuine, and Onor almost swore that he was trying hard not to laugh.32     Even though only two days had passed since docking day, Jali had worked miracles yet again, helping Ruby and Ani dress for lunch with Koren.She had put Ruby in a gray dress that dimmed her pale blue eyes but offset her red hair, and given her a belt and sash made from old uniforms that contained all of the colors of the Fire.Jali had also braided Rubys hair with colored ribbons.Jali and Ani both wore pale blues, with the edges in darker blues.The color highlighted Anis dark skin and Jaliets black braids.Ruby surveyed the small galley they had chosen for the event.It, too, had been dressed up in color: flowers had come from the gardens to create a centerpiece and the table was set over a cloth made from braided and flattened green and blue material.Ruby hugged Jaliet close.You are my best miracle worker.Jali smiled briefly, accepting the compliment.This was harder without Ix.I miss it, Ruby mused.Jali laughed.I had to find everything myself.Ruby had never trusted Ix; its goals werent human.Yet Ix had helped her directly more than once.She wanted to know what Ix thought of the Diamond Deep, and how would it interpret the place in light of its main directive to protect the Fire.Always before, protecting the Fire and protecting the Fires people had been intrinsically connected as goals.They might not be, now.Remember your manners, Jali reminded Ruby.I know.Dont snarl at the nice powerful woman whose robots are scaring everyone on the ship.We have no way of knowing whether or not she really has to touch everyone on the ship to make sure theyre safe, Jali said.Im angry, but I have no idea if I should be or not.Its unsettling.I dont trust Koren.Ruby caught herself pacing the small room and stopped.She might be all right, Ani said.Remember that youre the one who refused to believe reds were killing grays.Ani flinched.Sorry, Ruby muttered.Just be suspicious.Is there anything you want us to talk about?Jali asked as she straightened a setting on the table that didnt need straightening.Ruby glanced toward the door where Haric leaned casually against the wall.Dont talk about Aleesi, Ruby whispered.Dont worry, Jali teased.Well keep silent about your pet.Not, Ruby said.Shes as much as person as we are.Youre the robot girl, Ani said sharply.Not that thing.Ruby kept her silence; this would be a lousy time for a fight.They were all nervous and off balance.Haric gave a low whistle, signaling that Koren was on her way.Ruby took a deep breath and reminded herself to stay civil.Haric came in first.He stood against the far wall as Koren entered, trailed by her robot.This morning, it walked on two legs and looked almost human, although no features marred its smooth face.Koren set a small box down on the table in the closest place.She had dressed in black and white, which went with her black skin and white hair.Golden jewels flowed down the front of her tunic, complimenting her golden eyes.Please sit down, Ruby said.Wed like to offer you food fresh from our gardens.Thank you.Ive brought food from home.She gestured toward the box.Until we have finished analyzing the way we react to each others climates, we should not share each others food.She sat, and offered a sweet smile to Ruby.But we can certainly share a table.She sat.Ruby sat opposite Koren.Many hands worked on this lunch.I hope the historian in you is curious about what we eat.Of course.Please tell your people that I appreciate any effort spent on my behalf.Her voice was cool and controlled, formal.These are my advisors, Ani and Jaliet.Haric let you in.He will not be joining us for lunch?He will keep watch, Ruby said.Much like your robot.Haric came around and poured water.He hesitated at Korens glass until she nodded.She pulled a small vial from the box and dropped it in the water.Bubbles rose to the surface in a rush, almost foaming, and then subsided.Ruby drank half of her glass.Jaliet began small talk complimenting Korens clothing while Haric served them salads from the garden, lettuce and small tomatoes and orange orbfruit slices.Koren pulled out a series of shaped objects that turned out to be what she ate.They looked more like the colored building blocks a child might play with than like food.Is that what you normally eat?Jali asked.If I had brought fresh food, it might have contaminated your own food supply.After quarantine, you may be able to try our food.Do you have gardens?Ani asked.Of course.The human bodyno matter how much we have changed itprefers to take in nutrients in raw form.But you will eat distilled food, she pointed to the colorful blocks on the table in front of her, until you become used to our food.Gagging might be more fun.Surely our food gardens here will continue to work.Koren gave her a look that suggested the idea wasnt worth considering.Ruby changed the subject.Im looking forward to seeing more of the Diamond Deep.Perhaps they had even bigger parks.In the meantime, she had other questions.What does it mean to be the Chief Historian?I oversee the records of Diamond Deep.Who joins us, who does not, and why.We are the most diverse major power, and the largest economy in the system.We give succor to many ships and people who flee more restrictive environments.That must be a big job.Korens golden gaze seemed to be mocking her.There are people and machines who help me.Much like someone else prepared this food.Youre so young, Jali observed.I am far older than any of you.How old?Koren smiled.Hundreds of years.It has been a long time since we saw aging, and death here is primarily by accident.No wonder they had so many people in the system.Aleesi had said differently.Surely you cannot live forever, Ruby stated.We dont know yet.Koren folded her hands in her lap and added nothing more.Ruby drank the last of her water and gestured for another glass.The differences between the Fire and Diamond Deep seemed larger with every new thing she learned.Even though you are in charge of many people, you chose to come here yourself.A long life creates an interest in new things.The Creative Fire is the oldest ship that has ever docked here, and a miracle.Nothing else from your timethe time that The Creative Fire left hereexists.Everything has been remade.I thought we were no better than salvage, Ruby commented.Koren didnt miss a beat.It is possible to be many things.Can you tell us about your history?Ani asked.We will be together for days.Do you know how long?Jaliet asked.When can we step off of this ship?Koren smiled.She smiled so often and so shallowly it irritated Ruby.Maybe it wasnt good to be a few hundred years old.If that was true.But if so, Ruby wanted it.To keep her energy and her looks and her abilities for decades or more?The idea shifted inside her from impossible to attractive.Koren stopped smiling long enough to say, You will probably be granted a new home in a week or so.Granted?We intend to live on the Fire.Koren smiled yet again, and Ruby fisted her hands under the table but left them there.She wasnt ready to start a fight with this woman, not yet.She took a deep breath, trying to inhale politeness.Youre a historian.What would you like to know?Koren looked thoughtful.Four ships of the Fires type left here.One came back, generations ago, empty.Robots and the AI had managed to get it home.There were three bodies on board.Three.Yet there are thousands of living crew here.I want to understand why you thrived and others failed.Ani asked, What happened to the other two ships?They have not returned.Jaliet handed her empty plate to Haric.Surely they still could.We did not think any from this generation of technology would return.Travel through so much space is dangerous to human psyches.So much isolation.We send out robot ships now, and people only go afterward, if there is any place to go.Koren placed another small square of the food that she had brought into her mouth and swallowed it.Tell me about the structure here.Your culture.How are decisions made?Ruby forced herself to relax her tense shoulders.There had been a formal meeting with both of the Diamond Deep emissaries before this, and so Koren had seen Ruby by Joels side, and met Joels closest advisors.Decisions are made for the collective good.But it was not always this way.She knew.Ruby could see it.Why do you say that?Koren smiled.I talked with a woman, Lya, who said that there have been wars aboard the ship.Deaths.That things have changed recently, and that you drove that change.Of all the people on the ship, Koren had managed to find the one living person who hated Ruby the most?It couldnt be luck.Korens golden eyes showed nothing but curiosity.She sat with her legs crossed and her hands in her lap.Ruby was certain the woman was trying hard not to look dangerous.She could play the same game.We merely restored the Fire to something closer to the social structure that was true when we left here.It is, as you say, hard to fly through space for so long and not have some arguments.We are better off now.Koren smiled an inscrutable and slightly cruel smile.Lya said you have everything now, that you became the enemy you were fighting and left Lya with nothing.Ruby again reminded herself to stay calm.She needed to keep Koren occupied.If you talk to others, they will tell you that they have more freedom.Ani chewed at her lip, looking like she wanted to talk, so Ruby nodded at her.There was a different social structure on the long journey home.You might think of it as a segregation of duties and a segregation of power.She glanced at Ruby.But Ruby and others chose to change that.It would have been a shame for us to come home separated.Jaliet spoke, And as you see, we are unified now.All of us in this room are from different levels in the old structure.Koren stayed silent, as if encouraging more talk.Ruby made a gesture that told Haric to bring cracked flatbread which Kyle himself had seasoned.As he took it from the warmer, the scent filled the room.Ruby hoped it made Koren hungry.How did you know to find Lya?History is forged in conflict.A good historian knows to look for it.I am very good.33     KJ had loaned Onor two of his spider dancers.They hung beside him in suits, clutching traverse lines.Aleesis metal legs loomed just below him.Being so close made a little gibbering place in the back of Onors mind brighter, so he felt off balance.Maybe hed never be able to be near one of these things without feeling sick to his stomach.If this worked, they wouldnt have to come all the way back here to keep constant vigil with the robot spider.KJ had come up with the plan after Ruby insisted they protect the damned killer machine.KJ couldnt be spared, and Ruby had asked Onor quite nicely.The look in her eye was almost pleading, a look he rarely saw on her, and which tugged at his center so hard that he promised her even though hed wanted to refuse.Onor held up his journal with a recording of Rubys voice explaining what she wanted to Aleesi.Absent Ixs participation, this was the best idea they had come up with.He wasnt sure how it was going to answer since Ix wasnt actively translating.But shortly, the words, I agree, scrolled across his journal.The thing must be learning to understand human speech.It was the answer Ruby wanted, but it wasnt the answer he wanted.His stomach threatened him yet again, but it wasnt as if he could tell anyone how much the damned machine scared him.It wasnt rationalit was all about the flight the first day and the way the machine had cut Colin into pieces.He raised his hand, which held a set of loppers.Each step toward the machine was hard, and holding up the cutters to the chains that bound the spider to the floor was even harder.As if it sensed his fear, it didnt move at all as he and the spider dancers cut its bonds away.When all of the varied ropes and chains lay in heaps on the floor, the spider remained still.Onor remembered how fast they moved.He forced himself to stay still and type a question onto his journal, What do we do next?Step back.Onor was happy to oblige.The robot slowly and completely relaxed all its legs, stretching them out, so that it was as low and long as it could possibly be.In this position it did look smaller and stranger, and a little less threatening.You will have to climb into the center of me.Onor started in, careful not to step on limbs.The great claws were so tall that just passing through them he lost his view of the two spider dancers.In the middle of the beast, Onor felt small.Up here, so close to the center of Aleesi, he had to stand with one foot on each of two legs near where they joined in the middle.Looking down, he saw a cage longer than his arm and slightly thicker than his thigh.Inside the cage, a rounded blue oblong had been propped up by metal supports and protected against sudden movements.The brain.I will release the webling that holds my soul, the machine wrote across his journal.You will then be able to reach in and remove the cylinder from the cage.The mass of metal below him moved.The slight shifting of legs that occurred nearly caused him to lose his balance.The metal cage that had been hidden at the center of the robot snapped open with a single, silky movement and the blue oblong inside darkened.Even though his instinct was to crush it, Onor leaned down and pulled the object free.The webling.It was bigger in his hands than he had expected, and the surface felt oddly slippery.A few moments later they were sliding up the traverse lines, the spider dancers quite close to Onor, as if they knew he was of two minds about the thing he carried.At least it was quiescent under his arm, and light in here with the low gravity.34     The lunch with Koren had become nearly unbearable.Ani, Ruby, and Jaliet finished off a small plate of Kyles best cookies, and Koren polished off every little square bit of food that shed brought.Ruby felt talked out, full, and wary.She wanted to be away from Koren, and to find out if Onor had succeeded in getting Aleesi hidden.Koren pulled a stoppered flask of something out of her box.Do you mind if I drink?Of course not, Ruby answered.Do you mind telling us what youre having?Its a mild stimulant, much like the drink that you call stim.We will join you and have some stim then, Jaliet said, nodding to Haric.Koren waited while Haric prepared drinks for the other three, and left a fourth glass on the countertop.Ruby laughed and said, Yes, Haric.You may have some.He gave her a thumbs up.Koren sipped her drink.Tell me about the trip.What were the other planets like?We had not been born, Ruby said.My grandfathers grandfather was the last one to see a planet.I could tell you what we learned in school.I already know that.Im interested in stories.Stories?Ani asked.Things that youve passed down, generation to generation.Maybe things that got recorded in poetry or songs.She looked at Ruby.Youre a singer.Yes.The stim must be hitting Ruby; her senses felt more alive and a slight anger crept up her spine.But first, how do you know what we learned in school?Your AI knows.So you know?Ani leaned in.Weve been mining your AI since you agreed to come here.So you know everything that Ix knows?Ruby was repeating Ani, but the idea was too vast to imagine.She didnt know much of what Ix knew.All data that comes into the station is shared with us.Without that, we would never be secure.Koren knew things Ix had never told Ruby.Koren knew about Aleesi.Ruby felt cold deep inside, and certain her smile was as fake as the white haired womans smile.Jaliet asked the question Ruby should have thought of.Even if you did get all of the data from Ix, how would you be able to know it all now?Its only been weeks, at most.And Ix has been running the Fire since we left.Theres generations of information.Ani followed it before Koren could answer.And why is Ix part of the quarantine if you already have all the data?And for that matter, why cant Ix talk to us?Koren raised her little bottle and took a long, slow, sip.She seemed to like being watched.Ruby felt like throwing something at her.Koren put the bottle down.Im certain Ix is performing its life support duties.She paused.Is there anything specific that you need?Yes.Ruby leaned in so close to Koren that she could see the gold on gold edges of their captors ancient eyes.She barely managed to keep her voice quiet.We need to have as much information about you as you have stolen from us.We need to know how things work on the Diamond Deep, and how to behave.We need to know how to succeed there.We are your hosts.Koren packed her bottle and the napkin shed used back into the box that she had brought here.Without your engines, you cannot live without us.Our power keeps the Fire going and sustains everything from life support to lights.If we allow you to set foot on the Diamond Deep, we will teach you what you need to know to survive here.She said all of this lightly, as she werent discussing the lives of real people at all.Ruby tensed and bit her tongue, struggling for control.Korens robot slid a few inches from the wall, stopping close to Ruby as if it sensed her taut nerves.Jaliet put a hand on Rubys arm.Ruby took a deep breath and smiled as broadly as she could manage.We are pleased you joined us for lunch.The polite words nearly gagged her.I hope that we see you again soon.You will.The exotic woman turned and left, her pet robot following after her.35     Onor stuck close to Joel as their group of fifteen people threaded into the nightclub that formed the center of the cargo bars.The chatter and shifting movement of hundreds of people surrounded them, a throbbing energy that drove Onor closer to Naveen.Where are we?Naveen asked him.These are the cargo bars.Our ancestors apparently didnt need all of the space we have for stuff.This whole section has been home to cargo rats for years.Excuse me?Cargo rats?Sorry.People who live out in the cargo bays instead of having regular jobs.I didnt know it existed when I was a kid: I found out during the fighting.Its one of the best places on the Fire.Naveen looked enchanted.I love everything about being here.Look at all the people.When I signed up for this, I thought there would only be a few, and that youd all be starving and sad and maybe even crazy.And look, youre running dances.Really?Why would you think wed be sick or crazy?Being alone inside a big metal ship for generations?No growth, no new genetics, nothing new to see, ever, until now?Of course, it hasnt been as long for you as its been for us, but still ...Im amazed.You underestimated us.Yes.Well.I would have gone crazy.Maybe the reason you survived is that you live such short lives?Onor didnt respond to that.The Fires return is the most interesting thing to happen on the Deep in years.Naveen craned his neck, squinting through the dim light.The tall walls and high ceiling were hung with bright strings of lights that illuminated symbols from the worlds they had travelled to.The painters were all long dead.A group of drummers made it difficult to hear conversations happening just a few feet away.The room was so full that the outer guard around Joel had to work to keep even a few feet of space available.Beyond the guards, people danced, touched, bumped hips, and chattered enough to release a white noise that seemed to float the deep drum beats on top of it.Colored lights swept over the crowd, blue and green and white.Naveen did a full 360 turn, taking in as much of the garish decoration as possible.Do you like it?Onor asked him.Very much.Are there places like this on Diamond Deep?Naveen laughed.We are far more sophisticated than this, but far lessvisceral.Naveens hand adjusted glasses that he used to scan what he saw.He recorded almost everything, and sent video out to unknown numbers of watchers aboard the stations.Naveen had said that there werent many, but that the number was growing.How many people see what you see?Onor asked.About twenty five thousand.What a thing to tell Ruby.He hadnt had a chance to talk to her since her lunch with Koren, and he had much to tell her about the questions Naveen had asked.He had also developed the idea that Naveen didnt like Koren, and didnt trust her either.Naveen had not said so directly.Rather, Onor read it in the undertones of Naveens posture and facial expressions, the nuances of his voice.Onor talked about the bars.Before the fighting, this was a place where people from different levels sometimes shared secret conversations and drinks.Even now, some people live out here in the bays and never come into the rest of the ship.How do I get a drink?Naveen asked.I thought you werent supposed to eat or drink our food?Onor hadnt been there during lunch since he had been saving the spiders brains, but he had heard about the afternoon, and joined Naveen, Joel, KJ, and other advisors for a tour of command.Didnt you just tell me this place was meant for breaking rules?It does have that effect.But you wont get hurt by our stuff?Korens not here to care.And besides, Im in quarantine right along with you.If it kills me, so be it.He smiled, his eyes still twinkling.The man was having fun.We will all die some day, right?It made Onor laugh as well.He felt good, even if he was wary.Hopefully not for a long while.Onor glanced at Joel, who was deep in conversation with SueAnne.Can I take Naveen to get a drink?Send someone.Have them bring us all drinks.You want still?Joel almost never drank, even in the deeper cargo bars.Certainly never with an audience.Of course not.He leaned down and whispered into Onors ear.Drink with him.He appears to like you.Maybe youll learn more than we have so far.No still for the rest of us, though.Sometimes Onor wondered if Joel ever relaxed, even with Ruby.Maybe thats what power did to you.Onor sent three of the outer guards for the drinks.The room felt full of nerves and bravado.Diffuse.Undirected.People were a tad too dressed up, a bit too loud, maybe a bit more intoxicated than they should be.The drinks Joel had ordered appeared before the drums slowed.Onor handed Naveen his, which Naveen took a picture of.Then Naveen took another picture of Onor with his drink.They clicked glasses and drank, and the still hit Onor almost immediately, sitting like fire in his empty stomach.Naveen got a funny look on his face, then he licked his lips in an exaggerated fashion and said, To life!And finishing quarantine!Onor said.Same thing.Onor didnt know what to make of that answer.You have bars, right?Of course.Naveen took another sip.But this is unique.You should import it.Naveen sipped at his drink some more.Hed started moving to the drums.His skin was too deep a brown for his cheeks to flush, but his eyes looked brighter.The drums rose to a crescendo and then stopped.Scattered clapping rewarded the performance, just loud enough to hear above the constant conversation that swirled through the space.Onor took a smaller sip of the still.Watch, he told Naveen.Drums sounded again.Other drums, new ones, and off stage.They changed from a low, slow beat to a fuller and faster cadence.The stage was pitch black, the lights sweeping the back of the audience.The drums sped up again.At the crescendo, a spotlight fell onto the stage.In the center of the light, wearing a stained workers coverall, worn black boots, and ribbons of color that matched the old uniforms from the Fire, Ruby stood with her head bowed.She leaned on a prop that looked like a gun a tall as she was.Her red hair flowed unbound across her shoulders.The drums stopped.Ruby stayed completely still for two breaths.Naveen put a hand on Onors arm.Who is she?Onor smiled.On stage, Ruby lifted one arm and as it came up past her shoulders, her head snapped up, and her eyes opened.The object she had been leaning on revealed itself as a microphone rather than a gun.She tilted it toward her and the familiar opening bars of Homecoming came through every speaker in the room.Oh, my, Naveen whispered.Conversations stopped or dropped to whispers.Rubys voice filled the space, creating a focus completely on her.The entire bay full of people drifted toward the stage, crowding closer and closer to each other.She moved with raw sensuality, sidling up to the prop microphone as if it were a lover.She shifted from Homecoming to Song of the Seed smoothly.Together we are a seed Preparing to open in the light Of Adiamo.To flower.Naveen emptied his glass during the song, never once looking away from Ruby.The way he held his head still signaled Onor he was recording.She ended Song of the Seed with her legs wide and straight, her hands up high holding the microphone shaped like a gun, palms open, angled backward, and her head thrown back.The room erupted in clapping and noise.Naveen looked at Onor.Thats really her.Thats Ruby the Red.Onor had never heard her called that.As the noise calmed some he asked, Where did you hear that name?I was interviewing people who work in the gardens.Thats what theyre calling her.Ruby would love that.Her hero was Lila Red the Releaser, a woman who had led a revolution that failed.Barely.He couldnt wait to tell Ruby about the nickname.Shes incredible, Naveen said.The things Ive heard ...I didnt think they could be true.I didnt see how Joels woman could be the fighter.She was so ...politic.Shes versatile.Im jealous of Koren.She got to meet her today.Onor sensed that hadnt gone well.Ani had merely grunted when he asked her about it.Youll get to talk to Ruby more tonight.That would be ...I hope so.Ruby still stood on the edge of the stage, fearless, exposed.Joel watched her protectively.Some of the crowd looked adoring, or attracted, or simply drunk.Naveen looked starstruck.Onor had seen it on other peoples faces before, but never quite so blatantly.It made Onor feel warm and a bit starstruck himself, lucky all over again that hed grown up one of her best friends.The first swell of clapping subsided, and Ruby spoke into the microphone.Hello!The crowd yelled back greetings.Im glad youre here tonight!Weve got a lot to talk about!Talk!they chanted.Talk!Were finally here.Were back now, back home.Diamond Deep is not what I expected.I bet its not what you expected either!The crowd clapped a yes, catcalled.It is the last stop for the Fire, and its in the system we came from.This momentdocking yesterday and being here nowthis moment represents change such as we have never seen.Never.Not since the day our ancestors left and took on the Fire as our home.Ruby adjusted her microphone, creating a moment for people to think about her words.Then she continued.I know were stuck right now, and I know that doesnt feel good.It wasnt our choice, but the time will pass.Well continue to learn, to support each other, to be patient, and to be brave.Some muttering this time, then a clap, then another, then a swell of noise as more and more people committed.We must be strong.We must be proud.We must believe in ourselves.There will be strange things to encounter here.Things we can choose to fear or face.We must face them together.Can we?Can you?Can we all stay together as People of the Fire?Now that Onor was listening for it, her heard it a few times in the responses of the crowd.Ruby the Red!and once as Red Ruby!Now, she called.Now I have a new song for you.One I wrote for this moment.We are pregnant with possibility here.The song honors our waiting.She fell silent for a few breaths, and the crowd was silent now, too, waiting.Ive called it A Deepness in the Stars.We have arrived home to A deepness we have never seen Unlike anything we have seen Unlike our souls We came from here We were once Like the Diamond Deep Once was We should not fear  The Deep has called us home To find a dream, a hope, a place Where we will never be alone The song had more hope in it than he felt, but as usual Rubys voiceno, Rubys beingconvinced him.The last note trailed off and the stage darkened.In spite of the clapping and cheering of the crowd, the next time lights hit the stage a new band had set up and started tuning their instruments.Joel signaled his security detail, and the group began moving slowly toward a set of stairs that wound up the wall of the huge bay.At the top of the stairs, a door led to a hallway that led to the deep cargo bars where Colin had ruled.Allen greeted them there, offering Naveen a formal welcome.He led them to a booth in the back.Joel signaled for everyone except Onor, Ani, and Naveen to leave them, but to remain on guard.They ordered more drinks, Joel using hand signals to indicate that only Onor and Naveen should get actual still, and that Naveen should have some extra.Naveen remained quiet, contemplative.He didnt stir until the drinks and a plate of fruit and crackers arrived.He blinked at the drink in his hand and then looked at Joel.That was phenomenal.Joel smiled.The drink is a specialty of this bar.No.Naveen shook his head.The drink is fine.But I have never heard music delivered so ...so raw.You dont have concerts?Ani asked.Of course we do.Maybe I can take you to some.But they are ...huge productions.Very different.I have not heard music move that many people.He finished a third of his drink in one long swallow.Not since I left Lym.Youre from Lym?Onor asked.A real planet?I had hoped we would go there.Our ships records say we came from there.He sipped at his own drink.Slowly.Joel may be trying to get Naveen drunk, but Onor would pay for it later if he allowed himself to get lost in alcohol.Whats it like.To have a sun?To stand with a sky above you?Im not from Lym, but I was lucky enough to live there for a year.Naveen smiled softly, his face warm.I miss it.The openness of a world is amazing.The space and the fact that you can be completely alone.What do you think of the Fire?Joel asked.Its gritty.The station is much lighter and greener.He pursed his lips and glanced at Joel.I mean no disrespect.And of course the Diamond Deep will never go anywhere the gravity of Adiamo does not pull it.Im fascinated with your history.Joel sipped at his fake drink.Earlier, you said you chose to come here.Why?To see what we used to be like.Naveen fell silent for a moment, looking contemplative.Koren and I were chosen partly because were more like you.Ani laughed.Koren doesnt look anything like us.Weve no golden eyes and no white hair thats not on the very old.Oh, yes, she does look like you.Youll see.Ani frowned and leaned back.What about the robots?Humans dont look like that, do they?Made of metal?Onor admired the clever way to ask about Aleesi.Ani had grown much more subtle since Ruby took power alongside Joel.Naveen shook his head.Humans and robots are not the same.Human minds are required to be in biological bodies, but they dont all look like we do.That supported Aleesis claim.The conversation wandered across the Fire for a while, with Naveen asking about their history and the way they fed themselves.None of them knew the answers to some of Naveens questions.Onor tried a few times to access Ix on his journal and failed.He settled for sipping his drink and contemplating how much power Ix had in the information it withheld, and how much they had given up by failing to learn.Ruby had been right to send them all to class.They should have been studying every free minute.How old are you?he asked Naveen.I heard Koren is hundreds of years old.Naveen cocked a head.Im only forty seven.Koren is much older.You look twenty.So do you, Naveen countered, So do you.Thats because I am.Almost, anyway.How old is Ruby?Like me.So young.Naveen set his empty glass down and leaned back against the headrest on his chair.Joel glanced over at him and raised an eyebrow.Are you okay?Naveen sat up straight again.Onor let his drink be picked up half full and accepted another one for Naveen.Naveen finished his in three long pulls.Im always okay, he said slowly.Joel gave Onor a worried look.It was one thing to loosen Naveens tongue, but another entirely if he got so drunk he got sick.When Naveen reached for a piece of orbfruit, Ani leaned forward and put a hand on his arm.Youre not supposed to eat our food, are you?Im drinking your drinks.Onor and Joel looked at each other.Joel shook his head slightly, but Naveen already had a piece of fruit in his mouth.He sat back and chewed, and nothing awful happened.So, Joel leaned in.What happens next?If we pass quarantine, what happens to us?I dont know.Naveen look a little dizzy.I dont know.I dont think I could tell you if I did.Ruby came up behind Naveen.She now wore her base uniform and hardly looked like she belonged at a party at all.Onor was pretty sure she had a plan by the way she came up quickly, but she stopped when she realized they had Naveen with them.Naveen must have noticed Joel looking at Ruby.He tilted his head up enough to see behind him.His eyes appeared slightly crossed.I dont want anything bad.To happen.To you.Why would it?she asked.Nishe conchert, Naveen slurred.Thanks.She narrowed her eyes at Joel.He shrugged.Ruby shook her head and looked back at Naveen.What bad things might happen?Allen appeared, as silent as Colin had been, but with none of the confidence that would have painted Colins face in any situation.He looked quite worried.He leaned down and whispered in Joels ear.Joel stood up.Well go to her.He looked at Ruby.Lose yourself.Ill meet you back home.Later.He looked at Ani.Stay with Ruby.Onor swallowed and set his drink down.Joel should have sent him.Except Ani hadnt been drinking.Damn.Joel plucked the drink from Naveens hand and helped him up.Come on.Korens here.Prolly read my output stats.Huh?Implanche.Onor shook his head.Implants?What do you mean?Our AIsh can read our bodieshh.Cant yours?The idea of getting Naveen tipsy in case they could learn something suddenly seemed really dumb.Onor took his arm, and he and Naveen followed Joel and Allen toward the front of the room where the door guards kept people out who shouldnt be here.He imagined Koren in that situation, and was suddenly glad he wasnt a door guard.Of course, it might not be very good to be himself, either.Most of their guards kept a distance, although Onor had to wave one up to take Naveens other side so he wouldnt fall down.Joel glanced back over his shoulder.You can leave, too, he told Onor.Better if you did.Joel nodded.Thank you.But he wouldnt leave any more than Onor would.Maybe they could just hand the increasingly wobbly Naveen over to Koren and her robots and be done with it.36     Ruby paced in the quiet of her and Joels hab, back and forth the longest possible way, which led from the bedroom door down one side of the living room, past the entrance to the kitchen, and all the way to the front.The path was already worn; she often walked it when worrying about lyrics or about Joels safety.She suspected he walked it when he worried about her, or when he was mad at her.That happened.Right now, she worried about him.She worried about Onor, and even Naveen, who she barely knew, but liked.She could tell Onor liked him, and Onor was good at judging people.She worried about Koren, and what she had done to whom.Mostly, though, she worried about Joel.He moved from meeting to meeting without stopping, but there was nothing to actually accomplish except to wait.She wanted Koren off their ship.She wanted their ship free from the Diamond Deep.Both were impossible goals.She and Joel had bet their futures.All of their futures.The station had a right to do what they were doing.Maybe they even did it to every ship that docked here.There was no reason for them not to have rules that Ruby didnt like.But the whole set up felt like a threat, like she and her people were in some deep danger that she had absolutely no way to understand.She didnt even know what questions to ask, and when that was true, she was used to asking Ix.She stopped in the kitchen, her hand hovering between stim and still, choosing water.Next, she started running through KJs most basic movement sequence, the one shed learned in the big classes, way back in the days when Fox told her what to do and she listened.She hadnt seen Fox in a long time.The last time shed seen him, he had been promoting a band of drummers, and hed looked away from her as she headed toward him, turned sideways into a crowd, and disappeared.But she shouldnt be thinking of Fox right now.She pushed all of the noise of her mind away and focused on moving her body, one flowing pose sliding into another, balance and weight and speed as exact as she could get them.She hadnt practiced for weeks.All of her weight rested on one foot and her back stretched out even with the floor, the free foot behind her held flat, hands extended palm down in from of her.A line of Ruby with a single leg to hold her up, thigh tightened for strength, knee loosened for safety.When the door opened, she tipped the wrong way and had to touch her fingers to the floor to tip back so she could get her foot under her and stand properly.Joel?Im here.You were gone a long time, she called to him.What happened to poor Naveen?Koren sent him to his room with an assistant to guard him.That didnt sound good.Joel came through the hall and stood in the door.His jaw was set with anger, his shoulders tight.What happened?she asked.He crossed both arms over his torso and stared at the wall.We have to leave.What?We passed quarantine.Were being told that we have to leave the Fire.Not just by Koren.Thats what she says, anyway.He looked as angry as she had ever seen him, and like he could lose control at any moment.Ruby couldnt tell if he was about to explode in anger or cry.She had never felt him like this, so fragile and so angry and so frustrated.She had never sensed despair in him.She brought him a glass of water, which he waved away.Who?she whispered, not wanting to set off whatever was inside him right then.Who has to leave?You and me or all of command?What do they want?They say we all have to leave.The whole ship.Everybody?Thats thousands of people!The mere idea of it spun her head.Shed assumed the Fire was their home, at least for now.That theyd move off it slowly.That people would find work or places to go.They cant do that, can they?He sat on the couch and pulled her down to him.He held her so tight it hurt, his breath uneven as if he was as shocked with his news as she was, even though hed clearly had it longer.I think they can do whatever they want.It felt hard to think.Isnt there a court?Didnt you tell me that once?A system wide court?I dont see how that would stop them.They look at us like some kind of curiosity.As if were children.Maybe theyll put us all in a play pen and watch us.I dont know.We need the Fire.The holds.The things we brought back.Thats all we have.His jaw was so tight he could barely get the next words out.Koren says were lucky we are being granted a place to live for six months.The contents of the holds will be payment for that.How does she know what theyre worth?We dont either.Her brain raced.The Fires engines were off and might not be reusable at all.Certainly she didnt know how to start them.Ix could.But Ix had been silenced.The Fire itself had started falling apart the minute they started slowing down, as if it knew it was coming back to die.Truth be told, even earlier, if you counted how much of their equipment was scrap and parts by the time Ruby was born.What did you try to negotiate?He shook his head.It was all presented as orders.I got them to give us another day.Thats all.He was accustomed to respect and to people following his orders.Who knows this?she asked.Ani, Allen, Onor.KJ, because I sent Onor to hunt him down and tell him.Thats all.But well have to tell them all soon.Thats why I came for you.How much time?Koren started with two days.I turned it into three.Thats not possible.Thousands of people.Theyd all want to bring their things.Theyd want to group up as families.Theyd be scared.They cant ...what about the gardens and the parks and the water systems and the other things that have to be kept up?Theyre turning off the water that goes to the parks and the gardens.Thats ...thats violating.There were other words, other things it felt like.This should not be happening to them.Im not sure I can stand this.In trade for his unusual vulnerability, she tilted her face up, stood on tiptoe, and kissed him.Well do this together.He went silent for a long time.Maybe we shouldnt.We dont know anything.We might get blamed for this.Some will blame us.She pulled herself out from under his arm and stood, facing him.He looked tired.But then hed spent a whole day with Naveen, spent the evening at the cargo bars, and then had to deal with Koren.She took a deep breath, centering herself.They need us to lead.Even the ones who blame us are going to need us.Besides, its not like either of us could hide in the crowds anyway.He went still and watched her, assessing.Not quite hesitating.When he spoke he sounded measured and unemotional, like he was working for all of the control that he could get.His hands were clasped tightly together, as if to keep them from shaking.Koren offered to take those of us from command somewhere else.The others will want to go.She promised a place that was more comfortable.More privileged.Thats the word she used.You didnt tell her yes?He shook his head.I didnt tell her no yet, either.She tried to take that in.To buy us time?A slight shake of his head.You might think about it.We could be comfortable.Youre just tired.We cant abandon our people.And we cant trust Koren anyway.Were safer if were all together.You heard what I told them tonight, and how they reacted.They need to know we are all a family, one family.I want you to be safe.I dont care about that.I never have.If the world were still only gray for me, if I were still a robot repair girl, Id be maimed or dead or raped or something by now.She took his face between her hands.Whatever happens, its better than that already.Its better for almost everyone.She stepped back, biting her lip, giving him a moment.When he didnt reply, she said, We cant go backwards.We have to protect them all.He was so still.She couldnt tell what he was thinking, and he wasnt meeting her eyes.They need us, she whispered.He fisted his hands and paced.Ill lead them myself if you wont go, but I want you beside me.Youre our strength.You earned this job.And now we need you to do it.But she said that part in her head.It would be so hard to do this by herself.He stopped and answered her, very quietly.How are we going to lead them through a place we dont know anything about?With our hearts.He stood up and took her in his arms.He smelled of the cargo bars, of still and stim, of mint and talk.His heart beat against her ear.I will tell her were staying with our crew.She burrowed into his chest.I love you.Part Four          37     Joel and Ruby stood side by side, watching the line of refugees snake through a gauntlet of uniformed Diamond Deep staff.As leaders, they had gone through first.Now, they waited.Theyd sworn to watch as each individual left The Creative Fire.SueAnne led the line, walking slowly and carefully.Her face showed pain that Ruby suspected came from having to leave home even more than it came from her painful joints.All of Joels other advisors had taken Korens offer of safe haven somewhere else, but SueAnne had refused.In fact, when shed learned of it, she had slapped Laird across the face and walked away.Later, she had told Ruby she had wanted to do that for a long time.A specific process happened for each refugee.First, a pair of uniformed women took their names and pictures.A robot injected each person with medications, using small round buttons with needles that popped out on contact with the skin.Then, everyone passed through an arch where they stood on a plate while an unseen mechanism sprayed them with a fine mist, so they emerged with drops of liquid spangling their hair and cheeks.If they had looked happy, the mist might have made them pretty.On a few faces, it combined with tears.Ruby and Joel had done their best to message the banishment as well as they could, but without Ix to broadcast throughout the ship, the simple logistics of getting word to everyone and keeping order had required all of the three days they had been given.Koren had offered help from the Diamond Deep and by the end of the first day, they had grudgingly accepted a hundred people to help organize the exodus.Her mouth tasted like ash and she was tired to her bones.It was hard to stand up straight.Keep the rebels too busy to rebel.It tore at Ruby to watch how some of the people worked through the line.Some went shambling, the loss painted across features and dropping shoulders.Others walked with their heads up.Here and there, a few of the children and young adults looked excited or at least curious.Everyone carried bags of belongings, or wheeled makeshift carts.Ruby had managed to get permission to bring some of their robots as beasts of burden, so here and there a robot squeaked by with a pile of extra gray uniform cloth, tools, first aid supplies, bedding, or piles of food from the last harvest.Joel stood beside her.He had chosen to wear his most formal dress uniform, and he stood still with his chin up and his jaw tight.Ruby was pretty sure she was the only person to recognize how angry he felt.A thousand details and questions threatened to overwhelm her.Underneath of those, an anger similar to Joels burned deep in her, eating at her belly, but she couldnt afford to let it rise to her heart.Not now.She glanced up at him.Thats a quarter of them.About.Daria came through the misting arch hand in hand with The Jackman.She let go of him long enough to stop and hug Ruby.Ruby held her close, her face tickled by flyaway bits of Darias hair.I sent a bot to help you with your beads.Did it get there?Daria nodded against her shoulder.Thank you.Just behind Daria, Rubys mother, Siri, and her younger brother, Ean.Siri gave her daughter a cool hug, Ean gave her a warm one.After they left, Ruby frowned.She should find a job for Ean.She didnt mind that Siri didnt talk to her often, but she did miss Ean.A little later, Kyle came through.He carried two plates that must have held cookies.Ruby lifted herself on tiptoe and kissed his cheek.I bet you made a few children happier.I hope so.Nearer the end, Marcelle walked amid a number of women with children in tow.She carried a girl that mustnt be much more than two or three.Marcelle had talked about being a parent since they were little girls together; she would be a good one.Ruby felt happy for her, if bittersweet.At some deep core place, she didnt expect to live long enough to raise children.She never had.She waved back when Marcelle waved, then Marcelle bent to a child walking beside her, whispering something.She and the child were soon lost in the long thin string of people.They needed to plan for the children.Ix had been the primary teacher.Some humans had been in the classrooms; they would have to teach.Maybe Marcelle could take charge of the schools.Hopefully they would have room for schools.All they knew was they had been promised a home big enough for all of them.It felt as if the Fire was disgorging twice as many people as she had sheltered.At one point she saw Fox, who gave her a single, withering glance.About two thirds of the way through, a set of ex Peacers escorted the prisoners who had been in the Fires jails.A worse problem than the schools.They should have negotiated about prisoners.Once more, she felt anger nagging at her.They had needed time!She took another deep breath and ignored it, reviewing the to do list in her head until the anger went away.Near the end, one of the robots going by carried a nearly unbalanced metal box full of robot parts.Ruby bit at her lower lip and looked away as it was catalogued.When it passed by after the misting, she let out a long relieved breath.Aleesi was safe in their possession.Her feet were weary from standing and her cheeks sore from smiling by the time Onor and Ani came through, sweeping up the last stragglers.A few families had tried to stay aboard the Fire.Only the promise of failing life support systems had flushed them out of hiding.One of them had brought back a tale of two old men who had decided to stay and die anyway, but Ruby suspected that was rumor.These last few people were the saddest looking.A few were so old that friends or family helped them walk.Others looked partly unhinged by the change that had swept across them.Ruby leaned over to Joel and took his hand.Lets go.He looked back at the doorway to the hold that enclosed The Creative Fire.Well see it again, she whispered.I doubt it.I believe we have been completely and totally defeated.All she felt besides tired was a livid, burning anger.Well see.At least we are all together.Maybe theres some good here yet.Do you think so?Can I think anything else?No.They walked at the end of the line, following the oldest and weakest of the Fires many people to an unknown destination.38     Onor sat alone in the small bar theyd pulled together in a corner of their new living area.A rumor of a name had started.Ash.Onor loved the irony, although he expected Ruby to change it to something more positive.Still, it had stuck for the last week.Bar was an overstatement: ten cramped tables and a makeshift metal pouring bar with no chairs, one robotic server and one bartender.Allen.The worst part wasnt the cramped quarters, but that it was almost dry.Some of the equipment theyd used for making alcohol had come with them from the Fire, but Joel had refused to let them turn food to still or stim here.Two other tables held small groups muttering amongst themselves about one or another detail of setting up a whole new life for thousands of people.Theyd been here six days, enough to reduce total chaos to near chaos.Onor took a small sip of the half glass of still hed managed to talk Allen out of and stared at the device in his hand.None of their journals worked here.Instead, theyd all been given thin, flexible screens called slates they could fold up and carry around in their uniform pockets.The slates were very different than the old journals, and Onor had no idea if he was using it right.He had messaged Naveen, but he hadnt seen a reply.At the moment, he was staring at one of Naveens recordings of the old cargo bar, of Ruby singing the very last night theyd all been there.Hed been trying to pry secrets out of Naveen instead of paying attention to what he was about to lose, and now he could never go back.So much for coming home in triumph.Onor!He looked up to see Naveen came through the door.Onor hadnt seen him since the day they were kicked off of The Creative Fire.Naveens skin and hair and eyes were all the same inhuman shades of brown they had been on the Fire, but his clothes were now a myriad of blues, some of them shimmery.Onor grinned.Glad you came.Glad you figured out how to get a message to me.Maybe youre not quite as dull and clueless as Koren is saying.Onor frowned.She could be right.I feel like an idiot here.Thats why I offered you the golden chance to enlighten me.Wouldnt miss it.Did they really build you such a phenomenal ugliness to live in?This is where they sent us.Well, I suppose you didnt know any better.Naveen picked up Onors glass and sniffed at it.Got any more?Allen was already on his way over with a glass.This is almost the last I have.Too bad.Naveen took a small sip and let out a satisfied smile.Your brews arerawerthan anything we have.Maybe you all should earn your living by setting up a real bar.Earn our living?Sure.Think airs free up here?Youll have to work.Oh.Onor shrugged.We all worked on the Fire.Thats good, Naveen said.He raised his glass.To success and fame for the people from our past.And you.Onor sipped his drink.What happened to you after Koren found you?She locked me up and then shipped me off the Fire.Shouldnt have been able to do that.But she did it.Well, Onor swept his hand around.We got in a bit of trouble.You were in that trouble from the day you chose to come here.And you didnt warn us?Didnt know Id like you.Speaking of liking you, hows Ruby of the golden voice?Taken.Off limits to you, just like to me.Beautiful and brave.Shes working her butt off, her and Joel.Setting up schools and negotiating for food and stuff.Koren has a small army in here interviewing people.Never see her anymore, though.Korens heart has been replaced with ugliness and ego.I had to defend myself with the Station MPs for having this, he raised his glass, with you on the Fire.But you wont get in trouble here?Nah.So will you show me around the station?Were not allowed out without escorts right now.Something about not knowing the rules yet.Naveen laughed.Thats probably for your own good.Diamond Deeps not all safety and light.I still want to see it.Naveen drained his glass.Lets go.Right now?Onor hadnt expected that.Okay.He emptied his glass, grabbed Naveens glass, and headed for the bar.Were going out, he told Allen with a low voice.Pass it to Ruby and Joel.Lucky you.But be careful with the drunk.Hes okay.Onor frowned as he returned to Naveen.Ill follow you.Naveen immediately started to thread through the primary living quarters for the refugees.Ash was about a third the size of all of the living space on the Fire put together; each persons hab was half the size they were used to, or smaller.Some families were downright cramped.There were more common areas, although they were smaller than aboard the Fire.Nothing was broken, and water appeared to be unlimited.On balance, it seemed okay to Onor in spite of what Naveen had said, except for the crowding.People had already decorated their habs and walls with the colors from home, and Headman Stevenson had sent them a welcome gift of multiple potted plants full of bright blooms, some as tall as Onor.Even though it looked reckless to him, Onor liked the surprising bits of greenery by doors and on tables and walls.It reminded him that they werent on a spaceship any more.Where do you get all your water?he asked Naveen.I worked water reclamation, and it was hard and critical.But you have no problems.We make it.You make water?We make air, too.But you just told me air isnt free.Transformation costs energy.It was enough to make his head hurt.Id like to see where you live, Onor suggested.You didnt seem very impressed with the little world the people of Diamond Deep decided to bestow on us.Cheap algorithms, Naveen snorted.Boring stuff.He grinned.Maybe well make it to my house.But theres so much to show you.Lead.Two guards at the doorway out stepped back to allow Onor and Naveen through.That was easy, Onor commented.Ive tried to get out twice.They know me.Does the whole station know you?Not yet.Onor had been in the corridor on the other side of the door on the way in, but hed been busy herding tired people.He had spent the last part of the journey carrying two children Marcelle had handed him, one on each hip.At the first branching hallway, Naveen led him the way Onor had never seen.Even with gravity that was slightly lighter than Onor was used to as the daily norm, the walk felt long.Does it take forever to get anywhere on this station?Only when you let the stationmasters assign you housing on the outer edge of nowhere.I thought we were in the middle of this part of the station.But not near any decent transportation.But then, you didnt expect them to give you great real estate, did you?So who decides who lives where?Credit.Huh?You dont have any.Youre beggars now, and you could be close to slaves if you dont figure out how to earn credits.Its not hard.Ill show you.Onor felt like he only partly understood anything Naveen said.Naveen eventually led him to a train station, and they climbed aboard a train eerily like the ones on the Fire, only cleaner and with bigger cars.The train sped quietly along a winding track.For most of the ride there was nothing to see, although from time to time the window offered a rush of colors.Two other humans and three robots rode in the car, one of the robots so humanoid looking that Onor had to look twice to be sure it was a machine.The other two hadnt been fashioned at all like humans.To his relief they also didnt look like robot spiders, but had arms and legs.He was so busy studying the humanoid robot he almost missed it when Naveen got up to leave.The doors nearly closed on him, which gave Naveen a laugh.Thanks for the warning, Onor complained.Any time.Do you know your station?Huh?Where we got on.No.Star necklace.Impressive.He could remember that by thinking of the bead necklaces.Old.Its the name of a nebula.They went through a mechanism that Onor recognized as an oversized airlock about the time the second door started to open.Naveen watched Onor carefully as he stood waiting.Stop one on our tour, he whispered, sounding more serious than he had so far today.The door slid further open.Movement and color slammed Onors senses, followed by the smell of growing things.Bright lights forced him to close his eyes.The voices of both humans and machines made a low buzz.Water ran.He opened his eyes again, seeing what he had been hearing and smelling, blinking at the intensity of the light, which seemed to come directly from the walls.They were in an open space with high ceilings.Tables surrounded by people were the primary source of all of the voices, although people walked up and down wide corridors between groupings of tables.Naveen led him to one of the open tables.Now youll see why I like your still.Before Onor could protest, Naveen had ordered a drink for both of them and a plate of food, or at least that was Onors suspicion.He shared a lot of words with the man, but there were words Naveen used that Onor had never encountered anywhere, words so strange they rendered perfectly good sentences useless.Well, he could trust Naveen or he couldnt.
