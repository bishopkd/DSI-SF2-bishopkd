And precise measurement, which we couldnt do here, with the lab rocking.Gavin began to pace within the shack, stepping over Click without really seeing him.One moment, please, Alice said.But well be in Berlin in a few hours.Dr.Clef flipped to a fresh page in his notebook.The train will stop.Now, see here, Alice said.And well be able to buy more materials in a large city, Gavin said.We may have to build a few tools first, but   Wait.A.  Minute!Alice shouted.Both men blinked at her, as if only then remembering she was there.Clicks green eyes shuttered open and closed with little clicking noises that were clearly audible despite the rushing wind outside the shanty.Whats wrong, my dear?Dr.Clef asked at last.You see how well we are working together.Is this not a fine thing?You should not be discussing any of this, she said, one hand pressed to her bosom.Her heart fluttered about her rib cage like a frightened bird, and she felt a little sick.Youre treating the idea of changing something as fundamental as time itself like nothing more than some schoolboys science experiment.This is its Good heavens, I dont know what this is!Why would you do such a thing?Gavin looked at her, truly puzzled.Its for you.Alice hadnt thought she could be more shocked, and was even more shocked to learn shed been wrong.His words sent an electric jolt through her gut, and she found herself pressed against the wall of the shanty.What do you mean?You need more time, Gavin said.We need more time.You need to spread the cure and recover from it.And Im well, I dont have much time left.If I can find a way to change the way time flows for us, I can speed us up or slow the world down.Youll have more time to recover.Well have more time together.We can save the world, Alice.Just like Monsignor Adames said.Nausea and more than a little fear sloshed around Alices stomach.The very idea of tampering with time, let alone doing so in her name, screamed with wrongness.Alice tried to reply, but all that came out was a squeak.She tried again.Gavin, Doctor you cant be serious.I would never ask for such a terrible thing.I know.Thats why Im doing it.He reached for her hands, but she snatched them away.You dont understand at all.This is a horrible idea, Gavin.Its the sort of thing the Doomsday Vault was built to contain.What if you make a mistake?What if you speed time for us and the rest of the world goes ahead as normal and that tears a big piece out of the earth itself?I wouldnt make such a mistake, Gavin soothed.Truly.I dont make mistakes.You make mistakes all the time!Alice felt like she was arguing with a tree.You decided to escape the worlds most powerful police force in an airship that cant fly without making a spectacle of itself.You used that whip of yours without knowing how much power was left in it, and it fizzled away right when you needed it most.Just now you tried your your thing on Dr.Clef without considering whether or not it might damage his brain.No sane scientist would  She clamped her lips shut and turned her face away.That was the problem, wasnt it?Gavin wasnt wasnt  She couldnt bring herself to complete the thought.A hand took one of hers.Gavin looked her in the face, his expression worried and agitated at the same time.Im sorry, he said.Im so sorry.Youre right.Its Im going in strange directions, Alice.Im changing.My brain runs ahead of my mind, and I dont think.No, thats wrong.I do think.I think too much, and these ideas come to me, and it doesnt even occur to me that there might be something wrong.It scares me, Alice.I dont know what to do.Alice squeezed his hand in both of hers, flesh on metal on flesh.The spiders eyes glowed red.Its the plague.You have to fight it, Gavin.For as long as possible.Help me, he said simply.Lead me.Ill try.It was hard to speak around the lump in her throat.Ill never stop trying.Dont fail, Gavin said.Adames said I can cure the world, but you mustnt fail.Maybe thats what he meant.I am confused, said Dr.Clef.What are we doing?Were realizing what we should and shouldnt do, Gavin said.This he gestured at the paradox generator was a mistake.Ill destroy it now.He drew back his foot to kick the generator over the side and let it smash on the rocky railroad bed.Then he hesitated.Whats wrong?Alice asked.I cant do it, he said.I worked so hard on it, and its so beautiful and perfect.How can I destroy it?Then Ill do it.Alice leaned down to pick up the generator herself, but Gavins arm on her shoulder stopped her.Dont!he cried, then let her go with a start.I mean, you cant oh, God.I dont want its so beautiful, Alice.Alice pursed her lips, frustrated but understanding.I see, darling.Perhaps theres another way.Dr.Clef, Im going to take Gavin for a little walk.While were gone, I want you to destroy this thing.A horrified expression crossed Dr.Clefs face.But it is as Gavin said so beautiful!We cannot!Of course we can.Gavins voice hardened and he showed a bit of anger.We must.Do you understand me, Doctor?Dr.Clef cocked his head.I can, he said slowly.If I must.You must, Gavin said.We cooperate now, and you must.Then I shall.He sighed.I promise.Ah, well.It does make fun to knock things apart, yes?Alice embraced Gavin hard, and belatedly realized her cheeks were wet.Thank you, she said as the engine whistled again.I love you always.And I love you always.They joined hands and strode out into the wind.Dr.Clef and Click watched them go.A look of bemusement crossed his ashy face.Then he picked up the discarded paradox generator and rocked it like a lost child.A single tear, and then another, leaked from his eye and splashed on the wooden casing.Click rubbed against his knee.Mein armes Unmoglicheskubus, Dr.Clef moaned.My poor Impossible Cube.He has abandoned us.Abandoned!And now I must destroy this thing of beauty.Click continued to rub against Dr.Clefs knee, and Dr.Clef stroked his metal sides.They were gray with soot as well.You understand, my clicky kitty.You are a delightful machine and would not alter your path, just as this train would not.Could not.But that boy, he is brilliant, far more brilliant than I, yet he follows his genitals to obey the woman.How can they save the world when they dont have enough time, my clicky kitty?How?The boy and the girl need more time.The boy needs more time.He needs more time.Tears ran down his face and he rocked the paradox generator in his lap, lost in memory for a moment.Then a change came over his face.Sadness and despair dropped off, gave way to crafty resolve.We must show them they are wrong, mustnt we, my clicky kitty?he cooed.Yes, we must.Yes, we must!I can use the boys theory and his generator to re create my Impossible Cube, cant I, my kitty?Yes, I can.Yes, I can.Once I have my Cube back, I will be able to stop time forever, and that will give the boy and the girl all the time they need.At last the boy will have more time.Yes, he will.Yes, he will.I will stop time forever, my clicky kitty.Forever!Click only purred as Dr.Clefs joyful laughter poured out of the shanty.Chapter Eight  Kiev was the opposite of Luxembourg.Funny how two places could be populated with human beings but be so completely different, Gavin mused as the train puffed and growled through town.Although the city was built on a series of seven hills with a winding river at the bottom of the valley, the place had no greenery in it whatsoever.Not one tree, flower, or blade of grass grew anywhere.Stone and steel, smoke and sludge hemmed Gavin in.Street after street of blocky buildings crouched low over cobblestoned streets.Gargoyles clung to rooftops and intricately carved monsters crawled across archways.Forests of chimneys belched out clouds of smoke or flashed plumes of yellow flame.Pipes urinated endless streams of waste into the river.A crowd of workers huddled outside a factory, hoping to be called in for a job.More people moved up and down crowded sidewalks.The men wore gray shirts, and the women wore brown dresses and head cloths, and they kept their heads down as they walked.Bright colors seemed to have been outlawed, and the lack pulled Gavins spirits lower and lower with every passing moment.Something else bothered him about the crowds, but he couldnt put his finger on it.Mechanicals ruled the streets.Skittering spiders and brass horses and hovering whirligigs clogged the pavement and the air above it.Automatic streetcars rattled down their tracks, drawing iron boundaries behind them.They all pumped out steam and coal smoke, turning the air thick with white mist and yellow sulfur.Gavin turned away from the window with a feeling of nausea.The something he couldnt figure out continued to bother him, and it gave him a slight headache.How can people live here?he said.People live in all kinds of places, Dodd said philosophically from his own chair near the table.Many of them cant go anywhere else.My usual thought is to be grateful I dont have to stay.Gavin thought of his ship, his graceful Lady, now being hauled inexorably into this stony trap by an iron demon, and wondered how grateful he should be.He sighed.Once Alice had finished distributing the cure here, and once they were reasonably safe beyond the reach of Phipps, they could reassemble the Lady and fly for the Orient.As it was, he felt restless and out of sorts after days of inactivity.They had arrived in Berlin to find reward placards with Gavins likeness on them plastered over nearly every empty surface and a notice about him that circulated daily in every local newspaper.Alice, who hadnt been with the Third Ward long enough to be photographed, had escaped such treatment, but her description had been bandied about, as was Fengs.This forced Gavin to stay hidden either aboard the Lady or in Dodds car during the circuss entire time in Berlin.Alice and Feng risked slipping out to spread the cure around and brought back reports that underground stories of a woman with a demons hand and a man with an angels voice were already circulating.A number of Alices patients asked Feng to sing, and he quickly demurred.When I sing, Feng said, donkeys die in the street.So one night Gavin spent an hour with the little nightingale, recording the same song over and over until he was satisfied hed done it perfectly.He gave it to Feng so he could play it for Alice on her nightly missions.But some time later, the nightingale came fluttering back to him.His careful music was gone, and the nightingale instead spoke in Fengs voice.The lady wants you to know that the nightingales music is pretty, but not the same as yours, it said, and it makes her sad to hear it.More than once, Feng himself happily remained behind to accept from a grateful cure recipient what he called additional gratuity, a practice that infuriated Alice and Gavin both Alice on moral grounds and Gavin because it meant Alice was forced to travel back to the circus unescorted through Berlin streets.Feng, however, seemed unfazed by their fury, and Gavin understood more fully why Fengs father had decided not to allow him to continue as a diplomat in England.When Alice returned from these midnight excursions, she collapsed into a deep sleep that lasted long enough to make Gavin nervous.He spent hours sitting by her bunk, just to be near her.The iron spider on her arm lay between them, glaring red and bubbling with blood.He barely got to speak with Alice, hardly even saw her awake.This mission to cure the world drove her to exhaustion, and while he couldnt fault her for it, he found himself wishing she would give up some of her intensity.Leaving London and Alices fiance behind was supposed to have granted them the freedom to love each other, but instead they found even less time for each other than before.How could Gavin compete with a world of plague victims?At times he wanted to shake her and shout that he was dying, that any day his life could end, and she would have all the time she wanted to spread the cure.But he didnt.The devotion and intensity made Alice herself, and changing any of it would make her into a different person, someone he wouldnt want to spend his remaining time with.He could either love her or change her, but not both.Dr.Clef didnt seem to share Gavins unhappiness.He stayed locked up in the ships laboratory, scribbling with pencil on endless sheets of paper or with chalk on a slate, and manipulating long sections of his alloy into odd shapes.Gavin had been afraid that he was trying to re create his Impossible Cube, but Dr.Clef waved this idea aside.It is as I told you, he said blandly.I cannot re create it, now or ever.But he would not say what he was working on.As time passed, Gavin took to spending more and more time in Dodds car.It was larger and more comfortable than any stateroom on Gavins ship, and Dodd seemed glad to have him, his sole connection to Felix Naismith, though they never spoke of the man.Enforced idleness didnt sit well with Gavin, and his hands worked without him.Even now, as the train puffed through Kiev, he wound wire around a wooden dowel, slid the dowel free, and snipped the length of the resulting coil with cutters, creating a pile of little rings.At last the train screeched to a stop.It had taken a spur of track that cut past an enormous open square, perhaps three hundred yards on a side and bordered by tall buildings, beyond which rose columns of smoke and flame.Half the stone square was crowded with market carts and sooty freestanding tents.The other half, the side closest to the tracks, had been painted off, clearly set aside for the circus.Just beyond the tracks lay the slate gray Dnepro River.Oil glistened in a rainbow sheen on its surface far below the cut stone banks.Steel boats of varying sizes chugged along in orderly procession, their stacks spewing yet more smoke into the already overburdened air.The moment the train halted, the door to Dodds car jerked open and in popped a portly man with long mustaches under a bowler hat.His name was Harry Burks, and he was the advance man, the person who traveled ahead of the circus to start the publicity and smooth the way with local officials.He spoke a dozen languages and loved nothing more than spending an evening in a pub making new friends.Gavin had never known him to forget a name or a face.Dodd!Harry boomed.Right on time.Good, good!You know how the Ukrainians feel about punctuality.Whats the news, Harry?Dodd asked.Nothing major, thank heavens, thank heavens.We have the southern half of the market square for as long as we need it, and we can leave the train on this side spur, though I had to promise the chief of police and the town council and their families front row tickets along with the usual bribes.Placards are already up all over town, and Ive taken out advertisements in all the usual places.Im also trying something new paying hansom cabs and spiders a small fee to paste placards on themselves.Walking advertisements, you know.Well see if it helps, if it helps.Fine idea, said Dodd.And remind everyone not to go out after dark, Harry warned.Kiev clockworkers can snatch anyone off the street after sunset, and theres nothing you can do about it, nothing you can do.Dodd nodded.Will do.And the other matter?Harry gave a sideways glance at Gavin.Not a word, not a word.Your little friends may have been the toast of Berlin, but no ones talking about a reward for an American boy or an English girl, and clockwork cats are all the rage in Kiev.I think you can come out and breathe some smoky air at last, my boy.A load of tension drained from Gavin, and he slumped in the padded chair.Freedom at last!But, Harry continued, holding up a finger, there are other rumors.Im hearing tales about a young woman, an angel who cures the plague with a touch, with a touch, and of her young lover who makes beautiful music for her.Uh oh, Gavin said.How is word getting around so fast?Who knows, who knows?Harry shrugged.But there is more.The newspapers are saying there are fewer new cases of plague, and more of those who have it are recovering.Recovering!People are beginning to hope.That should give you reason to be careful, my boy, especially here.Im always careful, Gavin said, though even as he said it, he knew it was mostly a lie.But why here?Dont forget that Kiev is supposedly the birthplace of the plague.She certainly has more zombies and clockworkers than anywhere else in the world, and its a pity the Zalizniak and Gonta put all their resources into machines of war.They might have found a cure of their own, otherwise.At any rate, if the general population learns where to find you and that young lady, youll be overrun, like Jesus and the lepers.So watch your step, my boy, watch your step.An image of Alice caught in a mad mob of desperate plague victims flashed through Gavins mind and his fingers went cold.Understood, sir, he said.Dodd rubbed his hands.Lets get set up.I want the midway ready by nightfall so we can make parade by tomorrow afternoon.Outside the train, a crowd was already gathering under the gloomy sky, though everyone stayed carefully outside the painted boundaries.Here, no one stepped out of line.Once again, something about the crowd nagged at Gavin.He examined the people, trying not to stare, but still he couldnt work it out.They looked perfectly normal.Perhaps a few more than the usual had clockwork pieces or prosthetics, but that wasnt it.Gavin shook his head.It would come to him later, he was sure.Performers in work clothes spilled out of the other train cars and slid open the boxcar doors.The animals within howled, roared, and growled with agitation, glad to see sunlight, however hazy.Gavin sympathized.An official looking man dressed in a blue uniform and accompanied by a brass spider the size of a collie strode up to Dodd and spoke in Ukrainian, to which Dodd smiled blankly.Harry stepped forward and took over, withdrawing a sheaf of stamped papers from his coat pocket while the circus buzzed to life and the drab crowd watched with interest.The cool autumn air was heavy with acrid smoke and steam, no little of which was added by the circuss own locomotive.Gavin smelled coal and ash and dust and polluted river water, but the city air wasnt as close as the air within the train car, and Gavin stretched, enjoying it.Despite frequent visits when he was younger, Gavin had never been part of the circus setting up, and he turned to Dodd with a certain amount of excitement, especially after spending nearly a month in hiding with so little to do.What can I do to help?he asked.You have no idea what youre doing, Dodd said frankly, so the best thing you can do is stay out of the way.The circus performers worked liked a well oiled mechanical.First the mahouts led the elephants, both mechanical and biological, out of the boxcars while other roustabouts hauled out enormous rolls of canvas and bundles of wooden stakes with the ease of long practice.It wasnt possible to pound tent stakes through cobblestones, but before Gavin could wonder about that for too long, he saw a pair of roustabouts slide a stake into a hole that already existed, drilled long ago for exactly this purpose.It meant that the circus had no flexibility about what tent could go where or how big each could be, but it did allow a circus or other events to exist in the center of a city with no parks or grassy squares.The roustabout teams pounded the long stakes into the earth below the street with sledgehammers while teams of other workers laid out canvas.Once two rows of stakes were all in place and the red striped canvas was laid out between them, the roustabouts pushed two long poles under the canvas and propped them up to create an opening underneath.Two more poles were placed farther in to lengthen the opening, which made enough space for the next step.The mahout whistled, and the mechanical elephant puffed and snorted its way into the dark interior.Roustabouts followed with more long poles.Gavin, itching with curiosity, couldnt stand it anymore.He ran down to the tent and ducked inside.The brass elephant, now operating with perfect efficiency under Alices careful repairs, was dragging tall, heavy tent poles upright, thereby shoving the tents roof higher and higher.Gavin stood out of the way, feeling like a child near the enormous mechanical beast in the increasingly larger space.Once there was enough room, more elephants live ones were brought in, and the work went faster.The three enormous center poles took a trio of elephants to haul upright, with the trapeze artists and spiders up in the rigging to ensure they were set properly at the roof.Other spiders scampered about, fastening ropes and tying knots.The center ring was hauled in piecemeal and fitted together like a jigsaw puzzle.An automaton wheeled the talking clock woman to the entrance and wound her up, touched her metal cheek, and went off to help with other jobs.More people brought in bleacher seats to assemble, and the tent became loud with clacks, clatters, clinks, and shouts.For once, the clockwork plague kept its distance, and the analytical side of Gavins brain remained quiet, allowing him to watch in wonder as the Tilt assembled around him like a genie rising from the desert.Incredible, isnt it?said Alice.Gavin hadnt noticed her slip up to next him.A smile automatically burst across his face, and he leaned in to kiss her.She still looked a little pale, her skin contrasting sharply with the dark metal of the spider on her hand.How are you feeling?he asked.Not entirely myself, but one can only sleep for so long, she said with more candor than she usually allowed herself.Thank you for watching over me.He flushed a little.I thought you were asleep.I heard you singing in my dreams and knew you were there.She squeezed his hand, and the entire circus slowed and stopped.He became aware of the softness of her skin on his, the warmth of her breath, the pulse of their hearts.He never wanted the moment to end, but the second hand on the clock outside ticked forward, and the noises smashed back into existence.We need to go, Alice said.Where?Linda wants to see us.Outside the tent, the midway and sideshow were taking shape.Animal cages and brightly painted wagons were rolling out of the boxcars, and several smaller tents were going up.No one merely talked.They shouted and hollered, bellowed and bawled, trying to attract as much attention as possible for the circus.Lions roared, seals barked, elephants trumpeted.The sounds bounced off the hard buildings that bordered three sides of the square, creating a swirling cacophony that both unnerved and exhilarated Gavin.As they picked their way through the chaos, Gavin noticed the dam for the first time.It rose high above the oily Dnepro upriver, clearly visible in the dank air even though it sat between two hills well over a mile away.Water gushed through spillways, and Gavins sharp ears picked up the faint roar of it all even above the noise of the circus setting up.Wow, he said.How did they build that?I have no idea, Alice said.But Im sure its the reason Kiev has so many electric lights.Come along.Where the sideshow was setting up, they came to a canary yellow wagon, its wheels chocked into immobility.The door sported a sign: MADAME FABRY.The sign also showed a crystal ball, stars, and a palm, in case the viewer couldnt read English.Gavin knocked, and the door flew open to reveal a tallish woman who Gavin happened to know was over sixty but could have passed for ten years younger.Her thick brown hair was covered with a gypsy scarf, and she wore glasses.Her overly patched skirt and blouse part of a costume, now that they were setting up rustled about her busy frame as she put her hands on her waist.Well, its about time you got here, honey, she said brightly.Her accent was American, probably Midwestern, though Gavin had heard her speak with a Southern drawl more than once.Arent you supposed to say, Youre late, or something like that?Alice said.Why would I say that, sweetie?she said.Oh!The fortune telling.Right.No, dear, I save that for the flatties.Gavins been rude, is all.Dozens of cookies and butterscotch sweets Ive given him over the years, and then he hides in the circus for weeks without coming to see me even once.Sorry, he said, unabashed.Ive been a little busy.Kemp said you wanted to see us, Alice said.Yes, yes, come in.Linda ushered them into her comfortable wagon.Against the back wall stood an intricately carved bedstead with a plump featherbed and duvet covering it.Wooden cupboards hung from the walls, and a tiny stove took up one corner.A table folded down from the wall, with stools to sit on.But Gavins eye went straight to the automaton.He stood in the corner opposite the stove in a case of glass and metal similar to a ticket booth.From the waist up he looked like a brass man wearing a brown jacket and red vest.From the waist down, he was a complicated mass of metal and gears no legs or feet.His jointed fingers gleamed in the light of the lamp hanging from the ceiling off the rivets on his face and neck.The top half of his head was made of glass, and suspended in some sort of clear medium within which floated a human brain.Copper clips and wires were attached to it, and little electric sparks flicked and jumped about like fireflies.No matter how many times he had seen that, it took Gavin a moment to remember not to stare.Alice put a hand to her mouth.Hi, Charlie, Gavin said.The automaton opened his mouth.Gavin, he said in a metallic voice.And this is Alice?I am, she said.You have the advantage of me, sir.Sorry.Charlie Fabry.Id offer to shake hands, but He tapped the glass in front of him with a brass finger.And youve met my wife already.Quite, said Alice, and Gavin knew her well enough to see she was trying to cover shock.Charlie used to be a wire walker, he told her.He fell during a show and would have died, but a clockworker happened to be in the audience, and well, you can see the result.Gives you a whole new insight, Charlie said cheerfully.No appetites, fewer needs, simpler wants.Liberating.He leaned forward with a creak until his nose nearly touched the glass and his voice dropped to a raspy whisper.You can see what you never saw before.I dont understand, Alice said.Weve been discussing your little trip to the church in Luxembourg, honey, Linda said.Alice looked startled.You know about that?Everybody knows about that, Linda said.Not much goes on without everyone hearing about it eventually.I read in the newspaper that a large piece of the church was destroyed, too, but the vicar is planning to rebuild it even bigger, which will help when he applies to have it declared a cathedral.Is that what you wanted to ask about?Gavin put in.Lord, how I do talk.No, honey.This is.Linda lifted a handkerchief from the fold down table, revealing three tarot cards.The first card portrayed a skeletal figure swinging a sword over a field of grain and was labeled XIII.The second showed a burning tower falling to pieces.Two men fell screaming from it, and it was labeled XVI: LA MAISON DIEU.Laid crosswise over the dying tower was the third card, on which was rendered a man in priestly red robes.He held a golden staff in one hand and made a gesture of benediction with the other.This card was labeled V: LE PAPE.I dont know anything about tarot cards, Alice said primly.I avoid this sort of thing as nonsense.Place your hands palm up under the window, if you would be so kind.Charlie slid aside a small opening at the bottom of his glass case, much like a ticket taker might.After a moments hesitation, Alice obeyed.The spider on her left hand left her palm bare, but the metal clanked against the shelf beneath the window opening.Gavin watched warily.A pair of red lights beamed from Charlies eyes and ran over Alices hands.She jumped, but didnt pull away.The lights ran over every inch of Alices hands, then went out.Very interesting, Charlie said.You have refined tastes, but you work with your hands.Youve been touched by the clockwork plague more than once, you are deeply in love, and you cant get this spider off your arm.And you can tell all that from my palms, can you?No, thats just gossip around the circus.Your palms say the future is going to be difficult.Your fate line is ragged and rough, especially after your heart line.That means your future will be twisted and shredded by emotional decisions.You can change that, of course, but itll be entirely up to you.Didnt Gavin say you were a wire walker?Alice asked.Why are you telling fortunes?I was a wire walker first, Charlie replied genially.But now that Im freed of my body, I can see a great deal that other people cant.It lends itself to fortune telling.So youre not reading my palms at all.Alices tone was shrewd.Charlie shook his head with a faint creak.No.I pretend because no one believes pronouncements from thin air.Thats not true, Alice said.We believe pronouncements from teachers and parents and others in our lives.You didnt believe Monsignor Adames.Gavin blinked.How did you know we talked to Monsignor Adames?The church mess was in the newspaper, and I can see how people in the circus might put that together with our absence, but we didnt even tell Dodd that we talked to Adames, or what he said.I saw it.Charlie ran a metal finger over the glass casing that topped his head.Everything is connected.I told you that.Bits of pasteboard can give us a crude glimpse into the future, and the particles that run through my brain give me even clearer knowledge.Alice said, Thats   Nonsense?Ask your Dr.Clef about that, Charlie said.According to some very interesting theories hes been busy proving as we speak, certain tiny particles affect one another over long distances.Turn one particle, and its twin, no matter how far away it is, will turn as well.Just like flipping a card.Clef also claims that time is nothing but an illusion created by our own limited senses, and that as many as eleven other dimensions exist beyond our ability to see, but they still affect what happens to us.Everything is connected in one way or another, and once you accept that idea, the possibility that three tarot cards could fall out of Lindas deck and my electrical systems could play Camptown Ladies at the very moment you had a conversation with a man named Nicolas Adames doesnt seem very far fetched.Linda, who had been waiting near the table all this time with her hands folded, said, Honey, let me tell you what the cards mean and then you can decide what to do about it, all right?Very well.Alice sighed, clearly not convinced.She took up a stool next to the table and Gavin stood behind her.Strangely, he didnt share her skepticism.In the long moments when he watched over Alice, he sometimes found himself drawn into deep places, places where things could exist everywhere and nowhere all at once, where tiny, graceful objects appeared and disappeared so quickly, it was difficult to say they had hardly existed at all, where almost everything was vast, empty space that threatened to swallow him up, where matter was made of an infinity of tiny, delicate strings that vibrated and sang with a wonderful perfection that made him weep with joy and envy.And just as he was reaching out to touch them and change their song, alter matter itself, Alice murmured in her sleep, and the sound snatched him backward and upward into a bumbling world of impossible hugeness that could only be manipulated by tearing it apart by fire or grinding it around gears.It was maddening.If there were a way to better understand how it all fit together, he wanted to hear about it.Linda took up a stool opposite Alice while Charlie watched from his booth.Tiny jolts of electricity arced across his brain.Normally, honey, Id dim the lights and burn some incense and have Charlie make some whoosh whoosh noises, Linda said, but you arent flatties, so Ill give it to you without the show.We appreciate that, Alice said.How do you tell fortunes to people who dont speak English?Gavin asked.I speak more than just English, honey, and Charlie speaks what I dont.The pictures on the cards tell the rest.Most of my business is actually from women who are expecting.Why them?Gavin said.They want to know if its a boy or a girl.I dangle her wedding ring on a string over her middle and tell her what the baby will be based on which way the ring moves.Then I write it down in my book.She gestured to a leather bound diary on a high shelf.I have predictions going back twenty years.Alice leaned forward, interested despite herself.And how many come out right?Lord, honey, I have no idea.Probably half.I cant tell a thing from a wedding ring.I just tell them what they want to hear.Part of the show.So what happens when youre wrong?Gavin wanted to know.Usually were long gone by the time the babys born, dear.But sometimes when we come back to a city, Ill get an annoyed mother who shows up with a daughter, ready to fight because I told her shed have a son.I tell her that I didnt get the prediction wrong.She heard me wrong.Then I get my book down and show her where I wrote shed have a daughter, and Im off the hook.Because you write the opposite of what you say, Alice supplied.Linda nodded with a smile.There you have it, honey.It wont do to have the fortune teller come out wrong.So why should we believe you now?Alice demanded.Do or dont.Linda shrugged.But you arent paying me and I like you both, so I have no reason to make anything up.Alice didnt look convinced, but Gavin said, Fair enough.Tell us what the cards mean, Linda.Sure, honey.Look closely.She gestured at the cards on the tiny table in front of her.All three cards come from the trumps.They indicate large, important events that are difficult to control or change.The first card that fell out of the deck was the mystery trump, which everyone calls Death.Before you panic, let me tell you that it doesnt mean someones going to die.It means one thing will end so something else can begin.You cant stop the end from coming, but you can decide which direction the new thing will take.Since it fell out first, I assume thats whats coming first.All right, Alice said.The second trump card is the House of God.Its as bad as it looks utter destruction.Unlike the Death card, this is an end out of which nothing new can begin.It doesnt mean someone will die, but it might.Its not a good omen, honey.Lindas words sent a chill over Gavins skin, and her cheerful tone only made the dreadful prediction worse.Alice, however, remained unmoved.I see, was all she said.The third card landed across the House, Linda continued, seemingly oblivious to Alices attitude.This is why I called you in to talk to you.Charlie told me what the priest said to you, and this card is the Hierophant or Pope.He symbolizes religious leadership, power, and discipline.When one card lands across another, the crossing card is interfering with the card beneath.In this case, we have a religious leader who is interfering with total destruction.And just as these cards landed on the floor, Charlie told me what your priest said.That flood and plague will destroy us all if I fail, Alice murmured.No.Gavin put his hand on her shoulder.He said flood and plague will destroy us all if I fail.He said that I can cure the world, but you have to let go.Let what go?Alice growled.She held up her spider hand.This?I wish I could.He said that you have to let him go, Charlie said gently.Alice rounded on him.How do you know that?I believe I already explained that.And the fact that I do know lends credence to what Adames said, Charlie replied.Gavin can cure the world, but only if you let him go.Otherwise the world will perish in flood and plague.How am I to let Gavin go?Alice was getting truly worked up now.I dont hold him.I dont chain him down.Hes free to leave anytime he wishes.But when the words left Alices mouth, a pang went through Gavin.He shook his head.No, he said.Alice halted and twisted on her stool to look up at him.What do you mean?I cant leave you, Alice.His throat grew thick, and his jaw trembled.I could never leave you.I love you always.Her eyes softened.I know, darling, I know.She took his hand.But Im not holding you.Im not forcing you or chaining you.Am I?Youre leading me, Alice Michaels.The snaps and sparks that danced across Charlies brain created a hypnotic pattern of particles that blurred the edges of Gavins vision.Words poured from his mouth in an electric river.You go, and I follow.You pulled me out of that tower of destruction and changed me, and then you took me through the city of white and changed me again, and now youve led me down to the city of sulfur to change me one more time.You bring me places, Alice, and I cant stop you and I dont want to stop you.Is it a bad thing, Gavin Ennock?she whispered.I dont know.The half trance fell away, and he gave a little laugh.Ive never been in love before.Alice smacked the table with her free hand.Whats the point in making prophecies if they dont make sense?Why cant a fortune teller or priest simply say, Dont leave the house on Wednesday; youll be hit by a streetcar?The monsignor did say he couldnt see everything properly, Gavin reminded her.At least now we know that I have a role in spreading the cure, too.Theres one more card, Linda said.I saved it for last because it landed some distance from the others.From her pocket she pulled another card and laid it face up on the table.It showed a white haired man seated on a throne surrounded by water.He wore blue robes, a yellow cloak, and a crown.In one hand he held a large cup and in the other he held a scepter.This is the King of Cups, Linda explained.Hes a fair haired man, very artistic, patient, and unselfish, but given to flights of fancy.He cares deeply about others and shares their pain.Gavin picked up the card to examine it.That sounds a little like me, but   Its not you, honey.Kings are older men, and fathers.The remark sliced through Gavin like a knife made of ice.His fingers went numb and he dropped the card again.It landed on the table.For a moment he couldnt speak.Then he said, This is my father?Probably, Linda said.Court cards are usually people, and kings are often father figures.It fell away from the others, which tells me that the person is far removed, but coming closer.Gavin touched the card with a shaky finger.I always thought he was dead.Where is he?What is he doing?Why did he leave me?Us?I dont know.Linda looked sympathetic.I just know hes out there somewhere, and your destinies are intertwined.Alice gathered up the cards and handed them to Linda, her posture once again brisk.We know nothing of the sort.Im sorry, Linda.I know you believe what youre saying, but I simply cant.Listen, honey, Linda said, the reason for casting fortunes isnt to tell you what will or will not happen.Its to let you know the choice is coming so you can look at your options and prepare yourself instead of being hit blind.Believe or dont believe it doesnt matter.Weve had the conversation, and you cant unhear it.She reached into her pocket and handed them each a small candy wrapped in paper.Butterscotch?Im not twelve anymore, Linda, Gavin said, but the remark came out a little dazed.Honey, youre young enough to be my grandson.As far as Im concerned, youre six.She shooed them toward the door.Now, get out there and change the world before it changes you.Chapter Nine  The zombie straightened.Its eyes cleared, and it slowly wiped the drool from its chin with a sore encrusted hand.Alice lowered the spider gauntlet with a sigh.Shed lost count of the number of people shed cured now, but the relief and satisfaction she felt for each case never lessened.This was seventh or eighth plague zombie shed cured tonight, and she was feeling a little light headed now.Behind her, Gavin played his fiddle, something sweet and soft, and she drank the music in as the zombie shuffled off into the shadows of Kiev.Berlin had been difficult without Gavin, more than she wanted to admit.She drew strength from every note he played, and Feng was no substitute, even when he played Gavins music with the little nightingale.My father taught me that song, Gavin said.Im sure he did.Hm, Feng said.How can you miss a man you barely remember?I just do.Gavin sounded testy.You wouldnt know what its like.You had a father all your life.You got to live with him, work with him, see him every day.And live with his disapproval, Feng added.Maybe its better not to have a father.Then you have no one to disappoint.Perhaps you should think of that.Now, look   Boys, Alice said tiredly, I know were all nervous, but Im not up for mediating an argument.I would prefer to move on now.Gavin looked away.Sorry.Now where?Feng asked in a subdued voice.It doesnt really matter, Alice replied, and tried to make herself sound more cheerful.You know, its rather nice to walk about and not worry about being followed by Phipps.Phipps, no, Gavin fretted, but Kievite clockworkers are another story.Remember what Harry said they can take anyone they like off the streets after dark.Every time I play, it draws attention.Thats the entire point, Alice said, trying not to show she was uneasy, too.How will people find out the angels are in town if they dont hear your music in the dark?Besides, youre armed.Hm.Gavin touched the glass cutlass at his belt and fingered the heavy, brass adorned bands that encircled both his forearms.Feng checked the pair of pistols at his own belt, a hard look on his handsome face.We do not know for sure that Phipps has failed to follow.She will eventually notice that we twice appeared in the same city as the circus.Alice clutched the amber handled parasol Gavin had given her and stole a reflexive glance down the street, as if Phipps or a clockworker might leap out of the smoking sewers to carry them off.Then she admonished herself for being silly.It was well after midnight, and the gritty street was empty of pedestrians, if brightly lit.This latter aspect had taken Alice by surprise.By day, Kiev looked dark and moody, ready to pounce on newcomers.But at night, the city gleamed with lights.Every street and byway was hung with them, and many doors and windows shone with a steady, unwavering glow.Alice actually found it more unnerving than beautiful.Light should flicker and pulse and live, not remain steady and dead as a granite statue.She wondered whether it existed to ward zombies off the main streets, or to let prowling clockworkers see better.Even if Phipps does make that connection, Alice said, itll take her a few days to track us down, and well be leaving soon.How much money do we have?Not as much as I would like.Gavin took off his cap for a moment and rumpled his hair.People didnt donate much in Berlin.Dodd owes us some more for automaton repairs, and he wont pay us until the circus has done a couple more shows here.But yeah once we get that money, we should be able to buy enough paraffin oil to make a run for Peking.Ahead of Phipps.Proschennia mene, said a quiet voice.A young woman in a head cloth had emerged from one of the nearby houses and now edged uncertainly toward the trio, ready to run at the first sign of danger.Thats you, Feng, Gavin said.I have nothing else to do, Feng muttered half under his breath.Nowhere else to go.Before Alice could say anything in response to this remark, Feng greeted the girl in careful Ukrainian and spoke with her at some length.Alice was glad Feng, someone she trusted, spoke a certain amount of Ukrainian China watched the Ukrainian Empire carefully and many diplomatic families learned at least some of the language but Fengs behavior was different of late.The rumors have reached Kiev, he reported, just as Harry said.Lilya here heard Gavin playing, and she has braved the clockwork night to ask if Alice can cure the plague.Lead on, Alice said.Lady mine.Feng, Gavin said, is something wrong?No, he said shortly.Please, let us merely come along.Alice exchanged a glance with Gavin.He had noticed it, too the closer they got to China, the more shuttered and surly Feng became.They needed to discuss this, but now was clearly not the time.In the tiny, low ceilinged flat where Lilya lived, Alice cured the girls parents, who were both lying abed with fever.Gavin played until their pain lessened.Feng, whose facility with the Ukrainian language was the reason they brought him along, asked Lilya if she knew of anyone else who needed help.As Alice expected, Lilya did, and she threaded them through grime laden blocks of houses lit by dead lights, chattering volubly with Feng, who listened with animated interest.Whats she talking about?Gavin asked.Nothing in particular, Feng replied loftily, and said something in fast Ukrainian to Lilya, who giggled.Keeping a wary eye on dark sky and narrow street, they dodged beneath gargoyles to the next flat, where Alice cured three children, her parasol under her arm.The joyful parents pressed food on Alice and money on Gavin.She still felt odd about taking cash for curing the plague, but she reminded herself that they needed to buy paraffin oil if they wanted to reach Peking, and Gavin never asked for money.He only took what was offered.That went well, Alice said as she brushed bread crumbs from her skirt and straightened her hat.She avoided trousers on most of these outings on the grounds that the spider gauntlet drew more than enough attention.A woman in trousers would only compound the problem.She looked about the flats tiny kitchen, which smelled of watery cabbage and rye bread.Wheres Feng?They found him just outside the flats back door, which opened onto a stone courtyard shared by several blocky houses.He was caught in a passionate embrace with Lilya.Her skirt was hiked up to an embarrassing level and her blouse was open.Feng!Alice gasped from the doorway.Feng drew away from Lilya and blinked at her in the light that spilled from the door.There were no lights out back, and the shadows had half engulfed the pair.An oily smell wafted in from the river, covering everything with an olfactory patina of chemicals and damp.Do you mind?Feng said.Not this again!Alice blurted, shocked.What do you think youre doing?The same thing you have done for weeks, Feng said as Lilya straightened her clothes, only you do it with Gavin.Alice became aware that the inhabitants of the flat were standing behind her, as was Gavin, and she felt her face redden.Youre This is She recovered herself somewhat.Feng, we have to leave.Now.Of course.He nuzzled at the girls cheek.Lilya knows of another house of plague and we must go right this moment, must we not?Exactly on your schedule, and no one elses, because you are English.Either he was oblivious to Alices outrage or he was a master at ignoring it, which only added to Alices fury.The girl was all but hanging out of her blouse and Fengs arousal was all too evident.There was certainly no possibility she could reenter the house and face the looks of the two strangers, so she marched down the back stoop and around the corner of the house, her face growing hot again as she heard Feng bid the couple good night in Ukrainian.Gavin came after.You are quite a What is it you say?A piece of work, Feng drawled.He was holding Lilyas hand, and she was all but skipping along beside him, apparently now enjoying her adventure.She was pretty, he was handsome, and they would have made an attractive couple under other circumstances.I dont know what you mean, Alice snapped.A few blocks away, a stack erupted in bright yellow flame, then went out with a whump.You and Gavin carry on very plainly, like two animals in   Watch your words, Feng, Gavin growled.Why?Will you strike me?Feng shot back.I am tired of hypocrisy.You two have no stronger a connection than sweet Lilya and I do.You are not married or even engaged to be married, so by the rules of your own society, you are a pair of Gavin inhaled sharply, and Feng shifted ground a pair of very bad people.Yet you enjoy yourselves together for weeks.And then you have the nerve to tell me I should not do the same?Enjoy?Alice whirled on the narrow sidewalk to face him, almost too affronted to speak.Smoky fog curled around her body, and the amber headed parasol banged against her shin.What do you mean by that?Feng made a scoffing noise.That is so English of you.Perfectly willing to tell everyone else what is right while you ignore your own rules.You and Gavin sent me to hide with those acrobats so you could   What do you mean enjoy?Gavins face was turning red.What are you telling people about us?I need speak not at all.Which is how well I get along with those smelly monkeys you forced me to live with.We thought that youd get along with them fine, Gavin said.Just because they are Chinese?Ha!Feng spat, and Lilya cast about uncomfortably, clearly uncertain about what was going on.They are not fit company for the emperors goats, let alone his nephew.As much to hide you with a family of Scottish coal miners.That isnt the point, Alice snapped.You are accusing me of   Yes, it is always you, Feng snapped back.You, you, you, and that cure of yours.You dragged me all over Luxembourg and Berlin and Warsaw and now to filthy Kiev for your cure.So you can save everyone.The world revolves around the great Lady Michaels, who guards her chastity during the day so her not so secret lover can spend himself on her at   Alice slapped him.Her hand left a mark that changed from white to red on Fengs ivory skin.Feng stared at her.Alice stared back, a little startled at herself.She had never struck another person in her life.But the fury continued to burn and she refused to move or flinch.Beside her, Gavin tensed, fists clenched.Lilya looked ready to run away.The narrow street stretched in both directions, its unwavering lights pinned to earth like half dead stars.Keep your filthy false accusations to yourself, Feng, Gavin said evenly.After a long moment, Feng said, Translate on your own.He turned on his heel and stalked away.Should I go after him?Gavin said.Certainly not.Alice turned to the still uncertain Lilya and gestured with her iron gauntlet.Go on, girl.Lilya may not have understood the words, but she got the message.Timid again, she led Alice and Gavin to another flat, laid out exactly like the previous one.Lilya explained to the mystified inhabitants why Alice had come and then fled immediately, leaving Alice and Gavin no way to speak short of smiles and sign language.Still, Alice managed to cure a man, a child, and a baby, which cried incessantly after Alice scratched and bled on it.Although the family appeared grateful, the wailing infant put a definite damper on their mood.Alice and Gavin left as quickly as they could.That was difficult, Alice said once they were back outside.Now what?We should probably just go back to the circus.Gavin scanned the smoky street and its looming gray buildings.He coughed at the soot in his throat.Well have to walk, too.Doesnt Kiev have even delivery vans that run at night?That wretched Feng, Alice muttered, taking Gavins arm as he slung his fiddle case over his back.Whats gotten into him, anyway?No idea.He seemed pretty angry.Alices chin came up, which made her almost as tall as Gavin.Im certainly not going to apologize.She paused.Do you think we should apologize?Like intelligent men everywhere, Gavin fell back on prevarication.Uh  She continued talking, half to herself.I mean, it isnt as if we did anything wrong.I honestly thought hed get along better with people who spoke his own language.Absolutely.It may have been a little presumptuous to assume hed be happy with a troop of Oriental acrobats just because he himself is from the Orient any more than I we might be happy socializing with any random person we met from England or America.You may have a point.She gave a heavy sigh as they walked.Their footsteps echoed down the eerie, empty street.You dont suppose the entire circus has been gossiping about us, have they?I mean, you dont suppose everyone thinks we that were  If they do, it doesnt seem to bother them, Gavin pointed out.No one seems to mind Dodd and Nathan.I cant quite get over that, she said.Two gentlemen, and everyone knows.Which part cant you get over?The two gentlemen part or the everyone knows part?Well, Alice amended, I cant say I cant get over it.Its not as if one never hears of such things.Its just that one never discusses them.You seem fine discussing it with me, Gavin pointed out.Yes.It seems I can discuss any number of things with you, darling, and thats one thing that makes you so special.She sighed and laid her head on his shoulder as they walked.For a moment, it felt as if the entire city belonged to her and Gavin alone.Even the plague zombies seemed to have retreated.A number of thoughts were working their way across her mind, and with no one else about, she allowed herself freedom to express them.I suppose I was rather self centered.I know Feng feels disgraced and hes nervous about facing his family again, and on top of it all, we I drag him all around these cities to visit plague victims and zombies.She sighed again, feeling more and more guilty.He said such awful things, though.Am I being womanish to feel bad about arguing with him?I dont know what that means, Gavin said.All the women I know would sooner smack you than sorry you.What women?My ma, for one.Shed smack you cross eyed if you mouthed and I dont ever remember her apologizing, but speak against one of her kids and you were in for a world of trouble.Do you think Ill ever get to meet her?Alice asked.I dont know.Gavins eyes grew sad.I dont know if Ill ever   Dont!Alice cut off the rest of the sentence by squeezing his arm with her iron clad hand.Her parasol knocked against her knee.Im being thoughtless again.Well see her; of course well see her.Shell have to be at the wedding.Gavin halted.Is that a proposal, Lady Michaels?Come to think of it, I never did actually propose to you, did I?Oh!She colored.Good heavens!II didnt mean to   Yes, you did.You certainly did.Alice floundered.The evening was turning out far more peculiar than she had imagined it might.The street seemed to skew sideways, and words spilled from her mouth in a dreadful torrent that she couldnt seem to stop.I didnt mean to push you into anything, though I rather assumed that once we found a spare moment we would want to formalize our relationship, not that were particularly traditional people anymore, but my title and my upbringing both mean I was hoping for something more traditional, and even though we were in a church in Luxembourg we never even had a moment to ask Monsignor Adames if   Gavin shushed her.Ill make it easy for you.He got down on one knee on the cobblestones before her and swept off his cap.His new wristbands gleamed in the lamplight.Alice couldnt help clapping a hand to her mouth, not sure if she wanted to laugh or burst into tears.The horrible businessmans offer she had gotten from Norbert last year came inevitably into her mind.He had offered her an emerald ring over a delicate luncheon of poached salmon and champagne.Gavin, dear, gallant Gavin, knelt on grimy cobblestones in a foreign city that stank of oil and steam.She couldnt imagine a more perfect proposal.Alice, Lady Michaels, he said, will you   And then he was gone.Alice stared in uncomprehending disbelief at the stones where hed been kneeling.Gavin had simply disappeared.It wouldnt register.
