Isnt that what they say?Simon stoops and pulls a pair of plastic goggles from the duffel bag.Straps them over his eyes.Then slowly works the nozzle of the pepper spray can into the slit in the tape over Ricks mouth.Ricks legs kick, trying to topple the chair backward, but it doesnt topple.Just rocks.Simons boot stills the rocker.But you know what Ive discovered?Works the nozzle further into Ricks mouth.Best way to make a non lethal weapon lethal?One last jam.Rick gags.Just treat the man like a crowd.The hissing of the spray goes on long enough that the neighbors assume its the roach guy making his regular visit.At least until their own eyes start to water.When Mina catches up to him, Rick is bent double on the floor, toppled, still bound to the chair, coughing up foamy blood.Not coughing.Coughed.She falls and cradles his head until her palms burn.Eyes raw.She coughs, cries.Simon stands over her.Gives the empty can one last rattle.Death rattle.Then dumps it in the duffel bag.Stows the goggles too.Then retrieves a knife thats nasty enough to have no other use than cutting people.She looks up at him, eyes swollen, welling, and spits.The fuck are you.Fuck you.Ill fucking kill you.He stands her up.His own eyes puffy and raw at the rims, in some parody of mourning.He smiles.Dont worry.She spits again.Not words this time.He puts his meaty hand behind her head and clutches her skull.Then with his right hand he presses the long blade vertically against the thin skin of her forehead.She barely squirms.Rotates the blade counter clockwise.Presses again.Sign of the cross.Leans in.Whispers.Go tell them what Ive done.On his way out, duffel bag slung over his shoulder, Simon stops briefly on the street to berate himself, like a man on his way home who forgot to buy milk.Damn.I should have asked him what the tattoos meant.28.Meanwhile at Trump Tower.Persephones alone, reading.A book.Middlemarch.Almost done.Marks off trawling Chinatown, again, looking for a cheap bed for an hour.Maybe two.Im in Hoboken staring into an icebox.Persephone curls up in the leather chair.Knock at the door.A voice calls.Hey.Its Dave the doorman.From downstairs.Got a delivery for Mark Ray.She puts the book down, perturbed.Calls back.Sorry.Cant open up for anyone.Doctors orders.Come on.Its me, Dave.From downstairs.No can do, Dave from downstairs.Seriously, its me.Take a look in the peephole.She tips up on tiptoes.Daves face all funny.Dave the bug.Flat footed again.Sorry, Dave from downstairs.Cant do it.He knocks three times on the door with a gun.Shots echo.Door dimples.Three fresh pimples like a teen before prom.She calls out.Dave the dumbass.Its steel reinforced.Dont you know that?Knob turns.Door opens.Dave invites himself in.Then I guess I should use the master key, huh?But shes gone.He closes the door quietly and locks it behind him.Not a huge apartment, and theres only one way out, unless you plan to rappel.Pistol pokes its nose into the kitchen.Dave follows.Still in his Sergeant Peppers uniform.Brocade at the shoulders.Epaulets.Captains hat.God, hes always hated this thing.Snaps the kitchen lights on.Empty, and from what he can tell, all knives accounted for in the wooden block.Silly girl.Hot, though.Very hot.She should try wearing something other than sweatpants.Out to the living room.Picture window hung like a masterpiece.The sparkling city.Now, a view like that, he would kill for.Actually, thats kind of what hes doing right now.Taps the bathroom door open with the gun snout.Yanks the shower curtain back, Psycho style.Rings rattle.Not in there.Not that dumb.And so into the bedroom.Appropriate, he thinks.Convenient too.She knows Dave the doorman.She knows all the doormen by now, of course, but she remembers him in particular, because of the way he looks at her.Its the same look she remembers from certain older men in her congregation.Men in the subway.Boys in the tents.Two men in a van.From her father, that one night.Shes seen plenty of looks in her life, learned them all, catalogued them, kept mental index cards on all their alarming variety.I want you.I want to love you.I want to fuck you.I want to hurt you.I want you to know I want to hurt you.Some people undress you with their eyes.Some people go a lot further than that.Dave does, often.So maybe, just maybe, this will work.Dave the doorman leaves the lights out in the bedroom.Stands framed in the doorway.A square splash of city light falls on the bed, so he spots them.Bra.Panties.Discarded.And, from what he can tell, recently worn.Dont tell me I caught her in the middle of a shower.Better yet.Bubble bath.He steps in gingerly, makes the here kitty kitty noise, like in a movie.Not too many more places left where she could be.Maybe the closet.Maybe shes in the closet watching him right now.He prods the panties with the gun muzzle.Scoops them up.Retrieves them from the end of the pistol, like a fresh caught fish on a hook.Balls them up.Inhales them.A perfumers inhale.Eyes slip closed for a second.Her hand joins his from behind, her body up against his, breasts pooled against his back, and he almost thinks, for a second, that he conjured her.Her hand is clutching his hand thats clutching the panties and now shes pushing them into his mouth.Panty taste.Her other hand takes its best educated guess at where his kidney is and slides the knife in, searching.Twists it twice, a full rotation.Like working on a stubborn screw.To leave a more raggedy wound.He struggles to shrug her off but shes already disarming him.Funny what you can pick up after a few weeks living in tents.Gun falls softly to the plush carpet.He follows.Less softly.She straddles him.Improvises on his neck with the blade.Shes not a medical student, after all.But more or less anything thats there to be cut, she cuts.The plush soaks up most of what pumps out.She has discovered a streak inside herself of late that she does not recognize.She tries to credit it to carrying the baby.If credit is the word.Something instinctual, born of being a mother.Some new primal drive to protect.Though that doesnt quite explain it.Those two guys in Red Hook, for example.She lingered long after she should have left them.Working.Slowly.And now here.Dave the doorman.In his sad little epaulets.She wonders where it comes from.Or if it was always there.Latent.Maybe her father saw it in her all along.He kept a claw foot tub in the basement for one purpose.Called it the Baptismal.Bare lightbulb jumped when he yanked the chain.Black shadows danced like a campfire.Started back before she could remember, really.Became a weekly ritual.Saturday nights.Her mother standing silent as he marched her down the stairs.Faucet roared, openmouthed, until the tub filled to the top.Then the timid mouse squeak as he twisted the spigot shut.Last drop trembling on the mouth of the faucet.Drip.He made her strip down.Kneel naked on a stepstool.Curl over.So he could dunk her head underwater.One.Two.Three.Pull her up.One.Two.Three.Pull her up.All the while reciting scripture.Her long hair, her mothers pride, never cut, left a wet slash on the wide wooden boards of the wall as he yanked her up quickly.Then dunked her.One.Two.Three.Four.Five.If shed been especially bad.Then he handed back her flannel nightie, folded neatly.Freshly laundered.Told her, Now you are clean.Her mother never once mentioned it.Not once, and then she died.The weekly ritual.She almost came towhat?Not enjoy it exactly.But rely on it?Maybe thats it.This weekly cleansing.The comforting consistency of rules.It let her know that, whatever she did, she could be exonerated.Washed clean.Through this weekly reminder of her fathers unwavering love.Though as a teenager, she started to feel rightly more ashamed to remove her nightgown.And her father had to find a sturdier stepstool.Still.Nothing happened.Not of that sort.Maybe to Rachel.But not to her.Not to her.Until he saw those pictures.He exploded into her bedroom wielding the glowing tablet.The light from the tablet lit his furious face.Slapped her with a bony backhand.First time hed ever hit her.Drew blood.Just a trickle though.Then he marched her downstairs.She accepted it meekly.Stripped.Knelt.Prayed.As he held her under.One.Two.Three.Four.Five.Six.Seven.Eight.Nine.Long enough for her to worry this was more than punishment.Still under.Every muscle tensed.Tendrils of blood curled and sniffed around her face like a school of curious fish.She gasped and breathed water.She had to breathe something.He pulled her up.She spat and sputtered and tasted something salty and metallic and then he pushed her under again.One.Two.Five.Eleven.Nineteen.She lost count.The frigid water set her ears to ringing.She was curled over, on her knees, naked.With one hand he held her head under.His other hand went wandering.Sounds of the room muted.He was saying something.Not scripture.Her eyes open underwater.Sick.Feeling a fullness.Edges of her sight blacking out like a curtain falling.He pulled her up.Fingers still in her.The next time under she just let go.Stopped struggling.Started to float.Loosed her breath in a school of lazy bubbles.Perhaps shed always deserved this.One last bubble, like a hiccup.The room so faraway and quiet.Calming.She only felt a joyful sinking.Fringed in black.Black bubbles.Arriving to carry her upwards.To whatever reward awaited her.Then a last rude yanking and a gasp and one last watery slash painted on the wide plank wall, crude calligraphy left by the wet brush of her long hair, never cut, her mothers pride.And now here.Dave the doorman.In his sad little epaulets.Painting his own wet slashes.He long ago stopped spasming.Yet these dirty fucking panties still wont fit all the way in his mouth.So she cuts him a wider smile.Thats better.Something about becoming a mother, she tells herself.Thats what she likes to think.Mothers pride.Then she likes to stop thinking, and that helps, for awhile.29.By the time I get back to Mark Rays apartment, there is a body, and a wet swamp of blood, and Marks there, and he is crying.Im sorry.I should have been here.Im sorry.Hands me the note.A kids scrawl.Thumbprints in blood like lipstick kisses in the margins.You said you would protect me.Persephones gone.We lock the front door behind us and figure weve got at least three days until someone reports the stink.Speaking of three days and stink, Harrows Crusade is rolling into town.In three days.Ready or not.Back in Hoboken, I read about Rick in the Post.Body in a dumpster.Tattoos closed the case.GANGLAND SPRAY SLAY.The Post really needs to find a new synonym.Mark Ray doesnt drink, doesnt smoke, doesnt curse, but right now, on my sofa, hes drinking, smoking, and cursing.The smokings not going so well.He gets through two puffs.Ricks brand.In memoriam.These are fucking gross.Stubs it out.Pardon my language.Swigs a beer.Holds it up to the light.So people throw away their whole lives just for this?Its an acquired taste.Mark puts the bottle down.Okay.What now, mastermind?Youre the mastermind, Mark.Im the muscle.Well, we have to find her.Thats first.Is it?What for?We havent exactly done a bang up job on her behalf so far.Are you kidding?You saved her.The only person I really saved her from so far is me.Everyone else, not so much.Mark stands up.Paces.Hard to imagine how he ever lies still in a bed.He turns to me.So what then?Thats it?No.Like you said.Three true outcomes.Okay.Well.Giving her to them is not an option anymore.Not that it was.No, it wasnt.So thats out.And without her, we have no prayer of luring Harrow into the dream.Which is fine, because without Rick, we have no prayer of crashing their construct in any case.Unless you know of someone else who you trust who can pull that kind of thing off.Not offhand.So that parts out.Which also means Im more or less useless to you now, because if it comes down to a street fight out here, in the nuts and bolts, realistically, youre on your own.Seems so.And I dont know what you may have in mind, but I cant see a way for you to pull this off cleanly by yourself.Me neither.So there you go.There arent three outcomes anymore, Spademan.Only two.Maybe not even two.Just one.Which is?He kills you.He kills her.He kills us all.Thats a terrible outcome.No kidding.Mark slumps back on the leather sofa.Knees bobbing.Cant sit still.I can tell he wants badly to puzzle this out.I can also tell he can barely wait to tap back in and be rid of this puzzling world.But he wont abandon me.I like him for that.He also doesnt have his answer yet.But I do.So I tell him.Youre wrong, Mark.There are still three outcomes.Really?Are you planning on sharing them with me?Yes.Three outcomes.He kills me.I kill him.Or both.Mark stares me down.Silent for a moment.Then scoffs.Sure.Back to the kamikaze plan.Brilliant.You said yourself, no way we get close enough to Harrow out here and still get out alive.Yes, but youre missing the most important part of that statement, which is the getting out alive part.You and I both know shes out there right now, running.Alone.Thanks to us.Thanks to me.And Harrow wont stop until he finds her, Mark.You know that.Which he will.Spademan, stop it.Its suicide.I shrug.You have a better idea?Come on.Its not an option.It was for you.Heres the part I cant explain to Mark.Its been a long time since I needed to do something.Ive done a lot of things, but not out of need.And Ive learned there are a lot of ways, and ugly places, where things can end.Backyards.Garbage bags.Subway trains.Most people dont get to choose.We dont discuss it further.Watch football instead.While Mark works on acquiring a taste for beer.Overtime.Fumble.Miami scores.I flip the channel.Fucking Jets.Another note.This one hand delivered.Slides under the door like a base runner stealing home.By the time I get the door open, hallways empty.They just want us to know that they know.Notes from Milgram.I believe I mentioned wed be getting back in touch.30.Milgram meets me the next day at dawn at the Hoboken waterfront in a stretch limo.Morning air is just cold enough that you can barely see your breath.The suns rising across the river, over the city, peeking through the curtain of towers like a shy actress on opening night.Lights come up.A farmboy, this one in khakis and a button down, frisks me with impressive inventiveness.Makes certain not a square inch goes unfondled.Finds a few hollows Id forgotten existed.This Harrow fellow.Real hands on operation.At all levels.Farmboy pockets the box cutter he finds hidden in my boot.Left there more as a test than anything else.Milgram dismisses the muscle.Just the two of us in the backseat.He knocks twice on the dark glass.We drive.Milgram gestures at Manhattan.Its a bit of a clich, I know, this meeting in the limo.But its quiet, its private, and its a great way to see the city.The skyline passes.Actually, it doesnt pass.We pass.Amazing, isnt it?After all thats happened?The city still has a grandeur, dont you think?I tend to favor this side of the river.Well, why not?Over there, they have to look at sunset over New Jersey.You get to watch the sun rise over New York.Pastor Harrow doesnt understand the allure of this city, frankly.Sees it as a cesspool, a kind of new Sodom.But I get it, though.I do.New York.The greatest concentration of human potential in the history of the world.So much so that they had to start piling the people one on top of the other.An island so crowded it had nowhere to go but up.Yeah, well, its not so crowded anymore.Im amazed you stayed, all these years.After what happened.So many people vacated.Not all.No.But most.And many of those who stayed simply dropped out of life, holed up in their metallic cocoons.Welllook at this woman.Thats curious.A jogger huffs up the waterfront, trailing steam clouds, like a locomotive.Ill admit, its a strange sight.I havent seen a jogger in years.Now thats hopeful, isnt it?People out again.Out in their bodies again.Thats what our crusade is all about, Mr Spademan.New York.Reborn.I understand you have some other business in the city while youre here.He forges on.A salesman.Knows when to engage.When to ignore.Its an enticing idea, isnt it?Rebirth.Especially for a man like yourself.What you went through.I would thinkwell, you know.Memories.Regrets.They can form a toxic cloud of their own.A different kind of fallout, I imagine.Milgrams dressed in a navy suit.Red tie.Perfect knot.A politicians uniform.He flicks at his lapel, brushing away some blemish only he can see.Wears a lapel pin.A tiny silver cross.Readjusts it.Turns back to me.You must wonder from time to time.What if someones wife had missed her train?Or what if her teacher had called in sick and the acting class was cancelled?Orand these are just hypotheticals, mind youwhat if her husband calls her back for one more good bye kiss in the doorway of their apartment?So she sets off five minutes later.These troubling questions of timing Milgram, Im going to cut you off right there I just mean it can all feel so random, so meaningless.Thats all we try to do, Mr Spademan.Bring meaning to peoples lives.Order.Persephone told me what you like to do.For example, to her friend.Rachel?Yes.A troubled girl.Milgram looks away, out the window, like a shy little boy caught in a lie.I like to believe shes in a better place now.Im sure you like to believe that.Let me interrupt the sales pitch, Milgram.You, me, Harrow, were all of us a little bit sick.Some of us sicker than others.And I dont see a way that any of us are getting out of this alive.Well, thats a very dark view of the world.Not dark.Just a view.Well, let me offer you an alternate view.We have asked something of you.To give us someone.Weve made an offer in return, and its a good offer, and that offer stands.But let me add one more thing.I dont need a sweetener.Hear me out.We have something else we can offer to you.Someone, actually.Like I said Do you recall how many people were involved in the attacks that day?I never read the papers.There were six.That they know of.That they caught or were killed.The two in the van.The two they caught in Brooklyn who helped build the bombs.The one who supposedly left the first bag on the train.And the money man.The elderly one.So thats six.The Dirty Half Dozen, as they dubbed them.Sure.And then of course whoever coordinated those car bombs that came after.They never proved those were related.All chaos is related, dont you think?In any case.Our Dirty Half Dozen.The Times Square bombers.Do you know what always fascinated me about their plan?What?The precision of it.I mean, you really have to marvel.A subway bomb, then a second one, precisely timed, and then a van that drives down to Times Square all the way from upstate.Sure.Very impressive.Gold star.But do you truly believe that, in an operation that well executed, that precise, youd leave a bag to ride unattended on a train forwhat?Half an hour?From borough to borough?Hoping no one spots it?No one gets suspicious?No one sees something, says something, as they used to say?I dont really care about logistics.Especially in hindsight.They say the bag with the bomb on the train rode in alone all the way from Brooklyn.Just like your wife, Mr Spademan.Your point?There was a seventh man.Thats bullshit.A motorman.Thats not true.He worked for the MTA.Begged off his shift at the station right before the explosion.A half hour earlier than scheduled.Called ahead.Claimed to be nauseous.So?So there is one place you could leave a bag and no one would notice.Right at the front of the train.The motormans car.Sure.But who would You leave the bag, radio ahead, complain that youre ill.Replacement driver meets you, takes over, spots the bag, figures you left it, figures hell drop it off for you at the next stop.But there was no next stop.If thats true, if its even half true, how come no one knows about it?How come the police never tracked this guy down?They put every fucking speck of every person from that day under a magnifying glass.Trust me.I dont know.What I do know, Mr Spademan, is that this motorman is out there.And no ones asked him these questions yet.He puts a hand on my arm.Pale as soap.Perfect manicure.We thought you might be interested in asking him yourself.Okay, Milgram.But why tell me now?Why not before?For most men, the promise of the dream is enough.More than enough.Theyll happily make that bargain.Milgram works past his habitual wince to an actual smile.We understand that youre different.Persistent.And ruthless.I must say, I thought we had you cornered.But what you did to the Chinaman?I almost admire it.Im not even sure how you knew hed turned.You mean Rick?You fuckers killed him.Sent your errand boy Simon.Milgram squints, as though Ive just told him a joke he doesnt understand.Then continues.In any case, Mr Spademan, here is our proposal.You give her to us, we give him to you.I will drop you on his doorstep personally.Hand delivered.Give you two a little privacy.Maybe you get to put that box cutter to use after all.Milgrams presentation is over.Hes clearly pleased with himself.Folds his pearly hands in his lap.Leaves me to ponder.We ride in silence while I consider what hes told me.No real reason to trust him, but then, this is too big a lie to be a lie.Hed never dangle this if he couldnt deliver.Consequences would be far too grave.A seventh man.Out there.Unpunished.Theres no way Ill ever give Milgram anything he wants.But Ill admit it.I feel it.Temptation, I mean.Years ago, Mark Ray asked me if Id ever been tempted by religion, and I told him thats not the kind of temptation I have to worry about.The limos circled back to my block.Milgram drops me at my door.A considerate date.I get out.Let me think about it.He leans across the expanse of black leather.Please do.Pastor Harrows in the city this weekend, as you know.Hed be happy to meet with you.In person this time.Assuming we can work something out.You have my card.Until then.The limo drives off.I turn to head home.On my doorstep, my box cutter.The one they confiscated.Red ribbon tied around it, like a gift.31.Im sitting with Mark Ray on the front steps of the library.Watching the lions watch the city.This is the first day we met.Hes finishing his story.The one about temptation.Mark had two friends.Beth and David.Beth hed known since middle school.David since diapers.They grew up in the church together.Sunday school.Youth choir.Easter pageant.Wednesday night volleyball, followed by prayer.In their teens, Beth and David started dating.It seemed natural enough.Beth had blossomed into the belle of the congregation.Brunette.Hourglass.David plenty handsome too.Sandy haired and smiling.They swapped chastity vows and promise rings.Perfect couple.A billboard for Gods good bounty, bestowed on those He loves.On those who obey.They looked like Adam and Eve strolling Eden, pre serpent.Everyone said so.Save Mark.He couldnt help himself.He was gripped with lust.He hoped Bible school would quell it.He got accepted to all of them, and chose the one farthest away.At Bible school he walked the ring road on campus with other women, in among the chastely courting couples.On your third walk around the ring road, you were allowed to hold hands.Still, at night, alone, the lust found him.Gripped him.He lay in bed after lights out.Gripped himself.
