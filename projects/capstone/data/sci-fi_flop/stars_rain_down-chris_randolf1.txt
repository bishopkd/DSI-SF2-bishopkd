  There was nothing left but a single fortress, its armor tarnished and its silhouette a black mark against the burnt sky.The metropolis surrounding it had been pummeled into bloodstained rubble and shattered glass, and the scene was the same across twelve continents.Where the Somari empire had once flourished in all its glory and arrogance, now only the fortress remained.At its foot, where the air was clotted with shrapnel and ragged flames, the last survivors of the Trans Continental Army made their final stand.They had been pinned down and slowly strangled to death, forced to take cover behind the mutilated remains of their civilization while spitting fire at anything that moved.Without hope for victory or escape, they were walking ghosts fueled by rage, too stubborn to admit they were already dead.And still the invaders pressed on, coming at them from every direction.Enemy infantry advanced tirelessly over broken ground, leading the way for mechanized monsters whose artillery howled through the swirling dust.Each blast bit into the fortress failing armor and inched the war closer to its end.Meanwhile, within the fortress and far from the crumbling line, sounds of the fight became a baleful symphony.Cannon fire beat an uneven rhythm, accompanied by a melody of screaming jets and the bark of ten thousand rifles.Strained voices cried out in chorus, then were silenced once and for all.This song came to Kai while he slept and dreamed.He ran from one nightmare landscape to the next, chased by a living machine that devoured the ground beneath him.The unstoppable beast chewed up and swallowed whole civilizations to feed its hunger, and still it craved more.Then an explosion rocked Kais incubation tank and he was awake.The nightmare world dissolved only to be replaced by the chaos of reality.He blinked and blinked again but his eyes refused to focus.The world was blurry and ill defined, tinted by the cold blue gestational fluids.Something wasnt right.The incarnation process wasnt complete, but he knew there had to be an explanation.A staccato series of explosions thumped at the chambers walls, and Kai struggled to keep cool.It was no time to panic.He pressed his eyes closed and slowly opened them, and this time the image became sharper.The laboratory was in shambles; sparks danced from the ceiling, and rows of mangled birthing tanks dangled limply from their umbilical cords.A pair of genetechs in red gowns rushed over to him, one carrying an armload of clothing.The color had long ago drained from their faces, and their wrinkled hands shook as they went to work at the console.Their expressions spoke of terror mixed with sadness.Somehow, Kai kept his head in check.The string of lights at the top of the tank changed color and their blinking pattern became insistent.He understood the message, but the gravity of it didnt strike him.Not that it mattered.There wasnt any way to prevent what came next.There was a rumble and the ratcheting of mechanical locks.The viscous fluid drained from the tank a moment later, exposing his partially developed skin to fresh air.There wasnt any pain.Not yet.Then the front of the tank opened and dropped him onto the cold metal floor where he curled up like a newborn.He wanted so badly to remain calm, but he had no chance.There was simply too much pain, and it grew so loud that it blotted out every other thought until only a mewling animal remained.His mind retreated while his body rebelled.The tendons of his jaw stretched around a silent scream, and a series of quick convulsions violently ejected liquid from his lungs.More blue fluid splashed across the floor, reflecting the flickering ceiling lamps on its silken surface.The genetechs were speaking, but Kai was somewhere else.Somewhere far away, out of communication range.It took several long minutes for the wounded animal to subside, and finally allow rational thoughts to re emerge.Its too early, one of them said.Nonsense.His nervous system is fully formed, and cellular automata are functioning within acceptable parameters.Sinit Kai, can you hear me?Yes, he mumbled feebly.His mouth was an unfamiliar instrument.Why?he managed to ask.The older genetech crouched down beside him.The scientist might have been a mountain once, but decades of erosion had left him shriveled, withered and craggy.Our time has run out, Kai.You must leave this place while the path remains open.Kai coughed and more fluid wrestled its way out of his throat.I need to get to the front lines.The war  The genetech placed a hand under Kais chin, and gently lifted his head.There is no war, he said.All you hear is the last gasp of the dying.Its a funeral, the other genetech said.How?The scientist shook his head as he spoke.We lost at Sylus Gate, and the rest of our defenses collapsed in a cascade.The other said, Locara, Asheth, Telarius Point, and finally here.Each one a total defeat.Kai looked down at his incomplete hand.The structure was in place, but patches of half formed skin scarcely covered the lattice work of muscle machinery.If his estimates were correct, that placed him in the eleventh day of incubation.His entire world had been conquered in just thirteen days.His mind raced.Im still asleep, he said.The genetech said, I hope youre right, and that you soon wake.As the last word came out of the genetechs mouth, the far end of the chamber exploded.Flames clawed through the wall, and spit forth shards of razor sharp metal.Something clicked in Kais head and engineered instinct took over.He plotted the trajectory of every moving object in the chamber and launched into the air, twisting and contorting to avoid the shrapnel that ricocheted all around.An instant later, the room was quiet once again, and Kai found himself crouched over the genetechs remains.The hail of metal had shred them to pieces, and their blood now mixed with the blue gestational fluid in swirls.In spirals.Go, one of them gasped.The lowest level.The machine waits.Then he was gone.Kai stuffed the bundle of clothes under his arm and ran.The tunnels leading away from the laboratory were twisted, warped, and empty except for the sound of his feet pounding across the stone floor and the rumble of approaching fire.He was running through a graveyard, and the graveyard was burning.Level by level, he wound his way through the maze of corridors and descended deeper into the ground.All the while, sounds of the battle grew louder as one floor after the next was stripped away by the unstoppable fury of the invaders.He reached the last subfloor and sprinted toward the central hub while the heavy bulkheads closed behind him, permanently sealing the crypt.Then he was there, wherever there was.The room was another lab, this one bright white and circular.It was clean and totally untouched by the war that had demolished his planet.A sarcophagus like capsule stood at its center amid an overgrowth of cables and machinery.Kai wasnt sure what to do next.He dug through the bundle of clothes until he found a mission computer, a hollow metallic cylinder with an eery sheen, and he latched the device around his wrist like a shackle.Once closed, it adjusted itself to his arm and then he felt the familiar tingle of it interfacing with his nervous system.The computers screen lit up and words began to scroll by, which he simultaneously heard echoed in the back of his head.Its voice was childlike and boisterous.Initializing Initialization complete.Greetings, Sinit Kai.You will be pleased to know that all of my systems are functioning at maximum efficiency.The older models werent so cloyingly personable.Sure.Great, he said as he slipped into his uniform.Whats my mission?Youre a rude one.No matter.Your mission is simple.You need only step into the capsule, and it will do the rest.Kai fastened the last of his buttons and tugged his jacket to make sure it was straight.The self healing material of the uniform sealed itself against his half formed skin, and the last of the pain disappeared.I dont follow.What does this capsule do?How strange.I thought Sinit class infiltrators were supposed to follow orders without question.Things change, Kai said.And I seem to be the entire chain of command now.The computer took a moment to process that.Well, if you absolutely must know, the capsule is an experimental transit system.Theres a significant chance it will deliver us to a distant star or it may annihilate us in a lovely show of lights.To be quite honest, Im not sure which is more likely.Comforting.Kai didnt take long to make his decision.At least the capsule offered some chance of survival.He stepped inside and tried to make himself comfortable.To what end?Our intelligence operatives were able to determine the enemys next target, and the device is programmed to deliver you there.Upon arrival, you will have two objectives.The capsule closed, and hissed as its pressure seals locked into place.Get on with it, machine.You are terribly impatient, you know that?I was getting there.Your first objective is to protect me.I was implanted with a shard of the Primogenitors holographic data core, and I now contain the entire stored knowledge of our people.Our accomplishments must not be forgotten.Your other objective is to deliver a message.The hiss slowed to a halt, and was followed by a series of warbling tones that caused the capsule to vibrate.Their volume raised until the entire vessel became one great tuning fork.Then it happened.There was a bright flash, and the capsule climbed up and up through the many layers of the ruined fortress and further into the bleeding sky.The teeming ranks of the enemy stretched away in all directions, covering the land to the far horizon.Once the capsule was clear, a furiously burning light swelled up out of the fortress and engulfed the land.It raced out and swallowed the invaders, burning and crackling as it went.As the planet shrank away from Kais view, the whole world was eaten by the blinding power of that light, and then it all blinked out at once.What in creation?Kai asked.There will be no surrender, Sinit Kai.The Somari race died today, but the enemy paid dearly for their victory.The whole situation was too surreal.Kais head swam and he prayed to wake up, but it was no use.He was alone in a strange capsule hurtling through the blackness of space, and the world he knew was gone.Tell me, what message am I to deliver?Tell the universe that the Nefrem have awakened.Tell them the devourer is coming.The mission comps words echoed through his mind as the remains of his homeworld disappeared from view, and he heard them over and over until he finally drifted off to sleep.It was a sleep haunted by a billion wailing ghosts, and the spectre of strange worlds yet to come.Chapter 1:  The Hidden  Dr.Marcus Donovan was looking through a rectangular porthole.A thick pane of clear polycarbonate separated him from the cold emptiness of space and the radiant blue, green and white flecked Earth some 300 kilometers beyond.It was mid morning down there in New Zealand, and he idly wondered what details escaped his sight from this distance.You ever get tired of staring out the windows, Marc?Without turning, he knew that Dr.Vijay Rao, his best friend and second in command, was floating in the doorway.They had played out this scene a hundred times before on a series of orbital platforms looking out over every continent but Antarctica.It was their routine.Tired?Maybe someday, Jay.Not today.I honestly wish I had your love for it.I mean, I was pretty starry eyed my first time up, but I could forget there are windows at all these days.Know what I mean?Marcus dragged a dark brown finger across the transparent surface, tracing the line where blue green water met the thin beige strip of beach so far away.No, dont think I do.This is the whole reason Im here.Mom always said I had my head in the clouds, but she was only half way there.He turned, pushed himself away from the window and floated toward the open door, lightly brushing at a series of hand rails as he went.I take it the arrays ready to roll.Rao waved him on.She passed all diagnostics with flying colors.Just waiting for you to throw the switch, boss.Lead on, Marcus said, and together they made their way through the heart of the Copernicus Observatory like creatures born to weightlessness, until the narrow tunnel opened up into the spherical command center.The walls there were covered with workstations, each with its own technician and glowing terminal, except at the rooms equator where a ring of windows revealed the Earth beneath them, the sun above and countless stars in every direction.Commander on the bridge!someone shouted, and the crew snapped to attention.Damn jokers, Marcus muttered.He wasnt a stickler for protocol, or anything remotely like formality for that matter.The Global Aerospace Foundation drove him batty with that stuff, and everyone knew it.Back to your stations, people.Were three weeks ahead of schedule, but theres still work to do.He pushed off and drifted out into the middle of the room, and stopped by gently colliding with his own station.Rao trailed a meter behind him.Jansen, bring the generators up to full output and start cycling the capacitors, Marcus said.Already on it, sir.Park, bring the array about.You know where I want to look.Aye, sir.We only get one chance at this.Lets make it count.Rao patted him on the shoulder.Youre a liar, Marc.The only reason youre up here is to tilt at this little windmill of yours.Marcus cracked a smile.One mans windmill is another mans giant.Ms.Park, are we ready?Coordinates locked and ready to scan, sir.Rao put on a gamblers smile.Bet you fifty credits we only come up with rocks and empty space this time.Make it a hundred and youre on.They shook hands, and Marcus turned, saying, Commence scanning, full spectrum at eighty five percent intensity.With that, the Copernicus Observatory was momentarily filled with an ear splitting whine as its massive capacitors discharged, followed by the deep electronic hum of its multi megawatt scanning array.No one spoke for minutes as they awaited the first results.Ms.Park finally called out, Were receiving data, sir.Should I pipe it over to the main viewer?Yeah.Lets see what weve got.A three dimensional holograph blinked into existence in the center of the room, at first indistinct like a roiling cloud of smoke.Park worked furiously at her station and the image became more crisp, but it remained speckled with noise that frustrated any attempt to make sense of it.Marcus pushed away from his station and toward the projection.Thats no good.Raise the background radiation filters threshold another twelve percent.Aye, sir.It came into focus with crystal clarity.Ill be damned, Rao said near whisper.Im out another hundred bucks.Hello again, Zebra One, Marcus said to the image, greeting it like an old friend.He watched the displays clock tick away, and when it reached thirty five seconds, the object vanished from sight.He wasnt at all surprised.Youre getting slower, you little tease.Should we continue scanning, sir?No point, he said.Thats all well ever get with this equipment.Switch over to the deep space survey program.Mr.Shen, inform Bangalore the array is on line.Tell em were prepared to hand off control to the ground.Marcus Donovan pulled his datapad out of its holster and dialed back the recording to the thirtieth second, and there floating in front of him was the anomaly hed personally discovered seven years earlier.He was stationed aboard the Brahe Array at the time, an orbital telescope like Copernicus but older and mustier, tasked with routine scans of the asteroid belt.Thats when he stumbled upon her, a dozen kilometers long, oddly striped and density all wrong to be an asteroid.Then, before he could get a decent look, she was gone just as suddenly as hed found her.That first peek was only five seconds long, but it changed his entire life.During the months that followed, Marcus used every spare minute aboard Brahe to re scan the belt, but he only found rocks and more rocks behind them.He personally oversaw diagnostics and checked each piece of hardware by hand, and he went over his data with a fine toothed comb, but he always arrived at the same answers: there was no malfunction, he had seen something, and now he could not.Marcus named the anomaly Zebra One for the strange stripes along her length, as well as her talent for disappearing into the grass.His secret obsession transformed him.He grew from an undistinguished junior researcher into one of the single most dedicated, knowledgeable and experienced minds in deep space study, and it wasnt long before the Foundation took notice.Offers poured in from more prestigious stations, and with nothing left for him aboard Brahe, he left.The next few years, he toured through every station that would have him, and picked up a reputation as a true blue problem solver.He became the Foundations patch kit, their answer to projects that were over budget or behind schedule.All the while, he continued hunting for his zebra, and at each stop he enjoyed another brief glimpse of her before she vanished from sight.With each look he grew more obsessed.His reputation spread and he attracted some of the best, brightest and most eccentric minds in astrophysics, like Dr.Vijay Rao.Before he knew it, Marcus was in charge of a thirty man team of problem solvers, who came to be called the Gypsies because they never stayed anywhere for long.They moved onto a station, dragged a troubled project back on track, and then departed for the next.When the Foundation finalized plans for the Copernicus Observatory, the Gypsies were offered first crack at bringing the newest and most expensive deep space sensor array on line.Marcus jumped at the offer without a second thought.Now, six months later and more than three weeks ahead of schedule, Dr.Marcus Donovan was staring at the clearest freeze frame yet produced of the object of his obsession.She floated there among the asteroids, half blanketed in a layer of sediment, but revealing patches of glistening hull here and there.She was some kind of vessel, of that much Marcus was sure.He keyed his pad and the holograph rotated slowly.It was now clear that she had two separate hulls, one more than thirteen kilometers long, and the other about two thirds that length.Rao floated up beside him, staring in disbelief.Ive been riding you all this time, but I cant say it I think youre right, Marc.Of course Im right, ye of little faith.Marcus was still staring intently at the holograph, soaking in every fresh detail.Not to be an ass, but last month, I seem to recall you betting fifty credits that my theory was, and I quote, wrong wrong one hundred percent wrong.When will I stop gambling?Hey, take a look at that, Rao said, changing the subject.The stripes arent visible.Marcus dragged his finger across the datapads screen, and the display cycled through different EM bandwidths.He stopped when it showed the object in dark blue streaked with glowing red orange stripes.The amount of fine detail was startling.Ho leee cow, Rao said.Those stripes are internal.If I didnt know better, Id say the patterns look biological?When the words registered in Marcus head, the structures took on a whole new shape.Rao was right.They werent stripes at all; they were branching veins connected to some central organ.Ummm  Marcus fumbled at the keypad and rewound ten seconds then started advancing frame by frame.Little by little, the veins grew brighter, then dimmed and grew brighter again.He rewound and watched it again, and one more time.The veins were pulsating.It she was alive.Youre a genius, Jay.No shit.Marcus mind was racing a little over 299 million meters per second.Alive.Zebra One wasnt a vessel at all, but a living creature that had been lying dormant in the asteroid belt for at least the past seven years.Judging by the accumulation of minerals, she might have been there much, much longer.How long?What did it mean?He couldnt even begin to imagine the ramifications of his discovery.Then he made a decision that was too long in coming.I need to see her, he said quietly.Rao said, Come again?Marcus blinked and then shook his head as if waking from a daydream.I have to go see her, Jay.By hook or by crook, any damn way I can.Sure thing.Let me call the Appropriations Committee.Ill just tell em weve found an enormous space serpent, and that we need a ship so we can take her out for lunch.Thatll be rubber stamped without a second thought, yknow, what with their stance on extraterrestrial life.Marcus watched the recording loop several more times.Sarcasm duly noted, he said, and started to chew on his lower lip.Then his eyes lit up.Didnt you write a long winded paper about exotic materials?My graduate thesis?Theoretical Conditions for the Formation of Metallic Hydrogen in Deep Space.Marcus smirked.Lovely title.Youve lost your naming rights.Okay Zebra One?You make a fair point.Dr.Rao, what would you say if I asked you to help me falsify months worth of sensor readings?Rao scratched his head while dozens of emotions momentarily bubbled to the surface and disappeared.When the bubbling stopped, he said, Tell you what knock fifty credits off my debt, and Ill forget about the pesky ethics course I took as an undergrad.Youre a scoundrel and a scholar, Jay.You shouldve asked for the whole debt.Really?Too late.Weve work to do.Chapter 2:  First Response  Jack Hernandez was rechecking his equipment when the ride began to buck and shake.The metal cabin dipped and shuddered violently, but the U shaped metal restraint over his shoulders kept him planted firmly in his seat.At this point in his career, trans atmospheric flight was slightly more exciting than riding a commuter train.Man, hell of ride, aint it?Corpsman Walters asked.He was trying to sound cheery, but the quivering in his voice hinted otherwise.Jack didnt bother to look up.Skip, right?Nothing but a little turbulence.You just hang tight and everything will be peachy.The cabin lurched up and then back down again accompanied by a rumble like nearby thunder.Jeeez Us.You ever ever wonder what would happen if something went wrong?Whats to wonder about?The tranzat is biting back into the atmosphere at twenty times the speed of sound.If anything went wrong, wed be hamburger.Wouldnt even know what hit us.It occurred to Jack that last part might have been a faux pas.He lifted his head and looked over at Walters, who was strapped into an identical seat to his right, with both white knuckled hands clenched around his shoulder restraint.This was Skips first drop and it showed.Jack gave him a little pat on the shoulder.Relax, newbie.Ive been through more drops than I can count, and this is nothing out of the ordinary.Right, guys?The twenty members of the San Jose Bravo Brigade ignored him.Each was strapped into their own seat on either side of the leviathans cabin, separated by five meters of floor filled with equipment.A few were checking their gear like Jack had been, while others were thumbing through magazines.Lisa Albright had her headphones on and was listening to some band no one else had ever heard of, and Leonid Nikitin was sound asleep and snoring.See, Jack said, as if his question had been met with unanimous agreement, nothing to fret your little head over.Right about then, the blue lamp at the front of the cargo bay came on; drop was imminent.Oh boy.Now Skip, I want you to take a nice deep breath and try to relax.Can you do that for me?Skip nodded his head rigidly.And if you gotta puke, you damn well hold it until were back on terra firma, or Ill watch you scrub down the whole boat.A quick series of loud mechanical thuds echoed through the cabin as the docking clamps released, and then the leviathan shifted and slid free of its cradle.The windows along the length of the cabin, which had been black throughout the rest of the trip, were suddenly filled with blindingly bright blue sky, the javelin shaped trans atmospheric transport that had dropped them, and a half dozen other glimmering orange leviathans also in free fall.Jack thought the view was just marvelous.Skip Walters screamed.Thinking back, Jack had screamed his first time, too.Not today, though.Not for a half dozen years.These days, he loved plummeting out of the sky.It meant the trip was nearly over, and hed soon be pounding dirt in another foreign land.Skip screamed until his lungs were spent, but before he could take his next breath, the cabin was filled with the sound of the leviathans twin rotor blades rhythmically chopping at the air.The free fall was complete, and the helicopter was flying under its own power.Another second later, it leveled off and began its approach.As the leviathan descended and came around, the rear door opened to reveal forested hills and a monstrous plume of smoke rising high into the air.The helicopter tilted back, providing a good view of the grassy Earth below, while the two heavily laden pallets at the back of the cabin slid down the ramp, sprouted parachutes and drifted away.Then it was down, down, down to the ground.The leviathan slowed, and its suspension groaned as the landing struts dug into soil.The pilots voice broke in over the loud speaker, Welcome to lovely Santiago De Compostela, Spain.Once your restraints pop, youve got five minutes to disembark.No more.Take your crap with you, and thanks for flying Emergency Response Corps Air.The U shaped restraints audibly popped and then raised themselves over head, and the brigade stomped down the ramp.Skip charged out ahead of them, and after three long strides across the ground, he was on his knees and evacuating his stomach violently in the grass.Lisa Albright nudged Jacks shoulder to get his attention.First drop?she shouted over the thunder of the leviathans rotors, motioning toward the new corpsman.Jack nodded and said, Another fine day in the Corps.He glanced into the cabin to make sure his people were out and transmitted an all clear, then motioned toward Skip.He and Albright flanked the vomiting corpsman and moved him over to the side, while the emptied leviathan lifted back into the air and was away.They were in a clearing at the southern mouth of a two kilometer valley, surrounded by densely forested hills on the other three sides.The sky above was thick with leviathans, the biggest swarm of which buzzed around the smoke plume to the North.Theyd be dropping smoke jumpers and loads of fire retardant.Another steady stream of the helicopters headed east over the city of Santiago De Compostela, and Jack supposed the local air field was off in that direction.His brigade stood in a rough circle waiting for orders, and a dozen other groups of orange jumpsuits were clustered throughout the clearing.It had taken them a full hour to come in from Vandenberg, which meant they were last to the party yet again.The whole summer had been that way.Jack flipped through channels on his wristset until Logistics came up, opening a direct line to whoever was hosting the party.Then he tapped his headset and began transmitting.San Jose Bravo Brigade present and requesting assignment.A voice with a thick Spanish accent came back.Roger that, San Jose Bravo.Whats your specialty?Wilderness search and rescue, and first aid.We have surgical personnel on hand.Hold.Report to Med Station Three for triage detail.Coordinates are as follows The voice rattled off a long string of numbers that Jack hardly paid attention to.Roger, over and out.He took a deep breath and clicked his headset off.The Bravos werent going to like this.With any luck, they wouldnt shoot the messenger.Good news, folks.Were on triage again.Again?the lot of them asked in chorus.Come on, Jack.I didnt join up to stick band aids on boo boos, Leonid Nikitin said before jamming a cigar in his mouth.The man was pale and towered over the rest of the brigade like an old fashioned lighthouse.He had a point; he had extensive experience in tracking and wilderness survival, skills that were totally wasted at a triage station.The same went for the rest, who all had first aid or first responder certs, but were specialists in other fields.All except for Dr.Lisa Albright who was a real bona fide MD, but even she preferred to be in the bush.Jack couldnt do anything about it, though.Hed tried before, and it was a lost cause.Cut me some damn slack, Nicotine.Its hard work ignoring you all day.Hows about you complain to someone higher up the food chain, and let them ignore you for a change?Nikitins lip quivered until he couldnt contain it any longer, and then he let out a huge belly laugh that flung his cigar to the grass.The rest laughed, too.That was a good sign.Tedious work was bad enough with a good attitude.With the wrong attitude, it could be torture.From there on in, the Bravos were all business.They descended on the tent that was Med Station Three and didnt so much relieve the exhausted Madrid Echoes as push them out of the way.They came up to speed in minutes and dug into the work of examining, sorting and usually treating the refugees who had fled the raging wildfire.The bulk of their patients had cuts and scrapes, and few suffered anything worse than a touch of smoke inhalation and first degree burns.There were plenty of oxygen tanks on hand, and the Bravos were surprisingly good at putting pseudermal band aids on boo boos, so those patients moved through the system quickly.The fact that they had a physician meant they could also treat the few who required real care, instead of sending them on to the busy ICU tents or the city hospital three long klicks away.By the time sunset rolled around, the Bravos were running on empty.Up above, the billowing clouds burned bright magma orange in the setting suns light, made starkly visible against the pallid and darkening sky.The raging fire stretching across the low hills could now be seen like a great glowing serpent, hungrily digesting the blackened trees within it.The crews couldnt stop the fire, but word came through that they had contained it, and the remaining danger to the area was negligible.The stream of patients finally thinned down to nothing around then.Lets think about packing it in, Albright said.Jack took a look at his watch and discovered it was coming up on 2100 hours local.Theyd been working for ten straight hours, but the exhaustion didnt hit him until he did the math.He tuned back to the logistics band, and was just about to make the call when a loud burp like a hail of automatic gunfire sounded from the hills.The initial burst was followed by a handful just like it, each weaker than the one before.The weary corpsmen throughout the camp snapped to attention.What the hell was that?Nikitin barked.Since when is this a combat zone?Jack switched back to the report channel and hurried messages from firefighters flooded his ear.some type of small community.Musta missed it.could be a weapons stockpile.Debris everywhere  Survivors.Fifty, maybe a hundred.Hard to tell.Some badly injured.Send medevac.Barrier broken at section twelve.Need immediate air support.I repeat, need air support!Jack clicked the headset back off with a sigh.He didnt need to hear anymore.Grab a fast bite and a cup o joe, Bravos.More work on the way.It didnt take long for leviathans laden with new refugees to return from the hills and start unloading.Men, women and children painted in a mixture of soot and ash stumbled out of the cargo bays, while the rest were carried out on stretchers.All three med stations, almost empty just moments before, now had more work than they could handle.Injuries were more severe: third degree burns and the kind of wounds Jack had only seen near combat.Bullet holes from small and large caliber rounds, flesh shredded by flak, whole limbs missing in some cases.The orange jumpsuits were soon painted in an even coat of blood, making them hardly distinguishable from the patients in their care.The work became a blur.There were no patients anymore, just wounds.Jack was applying a beige pseuderm bandage to a badly bleeding arm whose owner occasionally grunted from the pain.The patient was a tough customer just as theyd all been.Then Jack felt a tap at his shoulder and heard his name, and it snapped him out of the trance.Standing behind him was young Skip Walters with concern all over his face, and behind Skip, a mother and daughter.The little girls face was so dark with soot that her bright eyes seemed to glow, and even though her shoulder had a deep gash in it, she wasnt crying.She looked lost, and was shaking like a leaf in the cool night air.Jack, these people  What!Jack barked, in no way a question.He was tired.It was late.There was work to do, and his fuse was dangerously short.Skip motioned to his upper arm, then pointed to the mother.The tattoo.These people are separatists, Jack.He leaned closer and whispered conspiratorially, Terrorists.When the last word came out, Jack went on autopilot.His hands finished applying the bandage while he stared at Skip with cold eyes.Nikitin, help the girl, he growled, and his fingers latched onto the new corpsmans collar.He strode out of the tent dragging Walters stumbling behind him into the darkness.His pace quick, his skin on fire, Jack slammed Walters against a titanium supply crate and punched it hard with his free hand.The wall rang like a hammered gong.His grip moved from collar to throat.Remember this because I only tell you once.The Corps helps everyone the same.Everyone!If you ever hesitate to help anyone again if I see you even think about it, Ill God damn kill you myself.Are we clear, Corpsman?Yes sir, Skip croaked.His eyes were wide with fear.Both mens hearts were racing at full speed.Jack took a deep breath.His grip loosened, and he straightened the young corpsmans collar.Now get back in there and do your damn job.Skip took off running with a fire under his heels, two parts fear and one part shame driving him.He wouldnt need to be told again.The kid would probably make it, Jack hoped, get with the program and fly right.Maybe even make a good corpsman some day.His first day had been a bad one, though.Then Corpsman Jack Hernandez, knuckles bleeding and muscles burnt, turned and headed back into the massacre.San Jose Bravo Brigade worked long into the next day.Chapter 3:  Snake Oil  The Global Aerospace Foundations main campus was a huge complex covering two square kilometers outside of Bangalore, India.The architecture married gothic and high tech, with great swooping roofs that gave the impression of the buildings themselves reaching for the distant stars.To Marcus Donovan, it was a modern day revival of renaissance cathedrals, pure pomp and self importance, evoking the immeasurable vastness of space and by comparison, mans own insignificance.Other times, he just thought it was huge and ugly.The main doors were on the eastern side, surrounded by a half circle of stone columns arrayed as a sundial.They tracked the suns daily and yearly journeys through the sky, a simple reminder of Earths endless whirling journey through space.Beyond that sat a sunken courtyard with a black memorial wall, inscribed with the name of every human being known to have perished in space exploration.The monument was inspired by the Vietnam Memorial still standing in old Washington DC, and oddly, both monuments were made of granite from the same Bangalore quarry less than ten kilometers away.As usual, Marcus passed the wall without pausing, and promised himself hed stop and read the names next time.It was always next time.Leaning heavily on a metal cane, he limped past the wall, through the towering columns and headed straight for the automatic glass doors.He was thankful for that last detail.His tours in space were growing longer and more frequent, and that coupled with his natural aversion to exercise made every return to gravity more difficultmore painfulthan the last.This time, hed endured two weeks of physical therapy after touchdown, and his legs still felt like chewing gum in July.He wouldnt be walking at all without the cane, and normal everyday doors were more trouble than he cared for.As he limped up to doors, the GAF emblem loomed above.It was a circular seal with shape that could have been a great red bird soaring to the stars.He wasnt sure, really.The design was terribly abstract, and the bird could as easily have been a spaceship, a boomerang, or mans indomitable will to greatness.It was anyones guess.The foundations motto was written in golden letters around the seal, reading Ab terra, ad infinitum et ultrum.Marcus failed high school Latin, but he was pretty sure that meant, From Earth, to infinity and beyond.He often wondered if a certain cartoon studio paid for the product placement, and that thought always put a smile on his face, no matter how onerous the task before him.This time was different, though.Utterly unique.Usually, Marcus was there against his will, bureaucratically kidnapped in order to give seminars about his methods, or appear before this board or that committee to explain himself.Not this time.No, Marcus had a plan, and had pulled in favors from every corner of the Foundation for an opportunity to sit in on the Budget Oversight Committees monthly meeting.That didnt stop him groaning on his way in.The interior was as unfriendly as the exterior, and largely empty as a final proof that its construction was all pretense without purpose.Marcus thought symbolic of the culture of waste that had crippled the Foundation for decades, and he ground his teeth while calculating how many exploratory missions could have been funded on the cathedrals budget.If he had his way, the Foundations bureaucracy would be pared down to two dozen full time accountants who would meet once a week at an all night diner, but he thought that dream a little far fetched, even for him.The half kilometer journey to the Goddard Meeting Hall was swift thanks to the network of moving pavement, or what he called the Great Conveyor Belts of Doomhed always had a flare for the dramaticand he arrived early for a meeting for the first time in his life.The feeling was strange, maybe even a little refreshing, but nothing he intended to grow accustomed to.He took a seat and somehow survived the next three hours, which were slow, tedious and boring in the extreme.One rotund bureaucrat after another stood at the head of the long table, pointed sweatily at ill conceived charts and graphs, and failed to describe in words what his diagrams failed to describe in pictures.The inability to come to a point must have figured highly on their resums, and Marcus stifled laughter when the thought occurred to him.Once the last presentation was blessedly oversomething about cost cutting measures in the office supply divisionMarcus was up.It was show time.He limped uneasily to the head of the table and tried to find some comfortable way to lean on his cane, and failing that, settled on leaning uncomfortably instead.His pose was not the absolute picture of masculinity, but it would have to do.He reached into his pocket and removed a wireless drive that doubled as a remote control.With the click of a button, it interfaced with the rooms projectors, uploaded his presentation, and then sat in waiting for his next command.Gentlemen, Marcus said and cleared his throat.Weve heard a lot today about cost cutting measures: department re organization, energy conservation, toilet paper recycling and what have you.He paused to let the barb sting.What none of these men told you is that theyre only offering band aids that will, in all frankness, do nothing to stanch the Foundations financial bleeding.No amount of schedule shuffling can fix our problems.He took a look around at the blank faces surrounding him and then went on.Those of you familiar with my work know that I operate a little differently.Im not here to give you a lick and a promise.I care about results, and I know you do as well.The old codgers were awake, and Marcus had their attention.Technically, the difficult part of the job was already done.He pressed a button on his remote; the rooms lights dimmed and the large screen behind him displayed an image of a bright, eye shaped burst against a backdrop of stars.Twenty five years ago, Sirius B went supernova and filled the night sky with a light that re ignited mankinds imagination.Interest in space exploration rocketed to levels not seen since the Cold War, as people all across the globe once again looked toward the heavens and wondered what secrets the universe might hold.He tapped the control and the screen now showed the Earth, its moon, and Mars.The Foundation was established and we quickly constructed more than two dozen permanent orbital facilities.Telescopes, the Midway Refueling station at Lagrange Five, and the two greatest achievements of our time, the Helios and Hyperion Solar Energy Arrays which made low cost power a reality.We then went on to establish Tranquility Research Station on the moon, and Ares, the first permanent colony on Mars, which today supports more than seven thousand colonists.That list is just mind boggling, isnt it?Thats a hell of a lot to be proud of But thats all in the past.What about today?Well, as you all know, Ive just returned from Copernicus Observatory, the only new off world facility built in more than ten years.Think about that for a moment.Twenty years ago, the Global Aerospace Foundation was a media darling.We were the future, possessed of our own epic drive and determination, and working without rest toward a single goal: to press forth into the darkness and spread humanity to the far corners of the cosmos.My question is what the hell happened?He clicked the remote again, and the planets were replaced by an artists rendering of the space elevator climbing up its tether into the void.That particular image was exceptionally famous, and had become a punch line in the Foundation offices.In response, a rather predictable groan filled the air.This is what happened, gentlemen.May I politely direct your attention to the elephant in the room.The space elevator is our most ambitious project.It holds the promise of virtually eliminating the cost of orbiting payloads, and it could finally realize interplanetary travel on a massive scale.If we stop to consider the elevators potential, its a wonder weve accomplished so much without it.Another click of the remote, and the inspirational rendering was replaced with a photograph of a metal frame work, a skeleton of steel girders floating high above the Earth.A small maintenance crew was visible working at one end.And heres where the project stands today, more than six years past the planned completion date.The elevator has proven to be a logistical nightmare, and its failure has destroyed our momentum.Those bare girders thats where we throw all our money away.Marcus clicked again, and the display switched to a very simple diagram, one he hoped even bureaucrats could grasp.It was a green circle on a white background.He pointed to the image as he spoke.This delicious apple pie represents all GAF expenditures since the project began.Nine tenths of the circle turned red.The cherry portion is all of the funding thats been diverted to the elevator.A fifth of that area then turned blue.and the tiny little blueberry slice here was the original cost estimate.What, then?Chief Administrator Chandra asked without a hint of amusement.Youre not seriously suggesting we cancel the space elevator?Not at all, sir.I have a much more revolutionary idea: We finish it.Marcus advanced to the next image.This one was an aerial photograph taken over Cape Canaveral launch center, where a monstrous rocket sat on the pad.The single biggest obstacle is precisely what the elevator is designed to fix.Our inability to put its largest components into orbit has become a fiscal sink hole.Even our largest multi stage lifters arent up to the task, and the components are too complex to be assembled in space.Essentially, we need the space elevator to finish the space elevator.Were chasing our own tail then, a droll voice at the far end of the table said.No, no were just attacking the problem from the wrong angle.Nobody wants to admit it, but weve run face first into a brick wall.We need more thrust and that requires more fuel, which in turn means larger, heavier and more sophisticated craft.Our answer has been to slap secondary rockets onto a lifter, and when those dont do the trick, we add support rockets to the secondaries.More components means more potential points of failure, and I dont need to remind anyone here the human price weve already paid for that failure.Maybe we could change public perception of atomic rockets, but I just dont see that happening anytime soon.That leaves one possible answer: a more energetic fuel source with a higher thrust to weight ratio.The image changed again, now displaying a dense scattering of rocks against a field of stars.One rock was eerily out of place.It was a long cigar shaped object with a strange black sheen and ripples along its length.Gentlemen, I believe I have that fuel source.For the past year, my team has been investigating an anomaly we discovered in the Themis family of asteroids, which weve labeled Zebra One.We couldnt figure out what Zebra One was made of, but when we brought Copernicus on line, we made a very interesting breakthrough.My associate, the esteemed Dr.Rao has determined that Zebra One is in fact a solid mass of meta stable metallic hydrogen, more than ten kilometers long, most likely separated from Jupiter by a prehistoric impact event.By conservative estimates, the thrust provided by metallic hydrogen would be more than three times greater than that of our current liquid fuel.This would not only answer our problems in constructing the elevator, but also provide a platform for further space exploration.And its just floating out there, ours for the taking.Marcus had struck a chord and he knew it.The entire committee was so deep in thought that he worried some had slipped into comas.It was more than a minute before Chandra spoke again.I assume youve come here with a plan today, Dr.Donovan?Marcus always had a plan.He clicked his remote, and now the screen showed a shimmering metal space ship in orbital dry dock.Its shape was blocky and strictly utilitarian, the surface bristling with dishes and antennae.Thats correct, Chief Administrator.With the committees approval, I intend to repurpose the Shackleton Exploratory Vessel, which like most Foundation projects is over budget and behind schedule.My team is prepared to take up residence on board and finish construction, after which well set course for Zebra One and conduct initial survey and mining operations.We estimate the Shackleton should be capable of towing at least ten thousand tons of cargo back to Earth orbit.And the Shackletons mission to the Galilean moons?Marcus turned off the projector, and the rooms lights came back on.Postponed, sir.Im sure everyone here would agree that the space elevator should be our first and only priority.The Galilean moons can wait until after mining efforts are fully under way.Well Youve made a very compelling proposal, Dr.Donovan, and we thank you for coming today.The committee will deliberate and contact you with a decision.With nothing left to say, Marcus dipped his head and left the room.He was glad to be out; the silence inside was heavy, and he had no idea which way things would swing.He had to believe hed done his best, and trust that his offer was too sweet to pass up.He also prayed that his reputation was enough to cement his place on the ship, otherwise there would be hell to pay.Of course, thered be some hell to pay anyway.As he stepped onto the Great Conveyor Belt of Doom, he began to feel the first twinge of regret.He wasnt a dishonest person by nature, and this exercise amounted to deception on a scale he never imagined.There were billions of credits riding on his manufactured data, and the sudden weight on his conscience was immense.His only relief came when he thought of the hoodoo math that proved humans were, without any shred of doubt, alone in the universe.A dangerous dogma had risen from that math, and with any luck, hed soon have the physical evidence necessary to bury it once and for all.Chapter 4:  228 Days  Marcus Donovans con worked.Less than a week later (3.3 picoseconds in bureaucratic time), the Budget Oversight Committee agreed to his plan and the Gypsies left on the first shuttle out.They spent the next two months finishing and reconfiguring the 170 meter long Shackleton Explorer.The Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto probes were removed and placed in storage for some future Jupiter expedition, as was the bulky orbital scanning array, while seven modular cargo containers and a state of the art extra vehicular mission unit were installed in their place.The cargo holds were packed full of mining equipment and explosives which Marcus realized would have no use on the mission, but he couldnt figure out a way to ditch them without raising questions.The Shackleton lost the planetary scanning equipment, but still retained its own substantial suite of sensors.The countless forward facing antennae made it look something like a harpoon for use against impossibly large whales.It also featured a pair of opposed habitation pods that jutted out from the main hull on their own stalks, which were designed to rotate around the central axis and supply the crew with more than half Earth gravity during the long voyage.What the Shackleton lacked in amenities, she made up for in advanced equipment.Mostly, anyway.The interior of the Shackleton Explorer was a perfect match for her exterior, being both functional and inhumanly spartan.No plush seating, no Corinthian leather; only the bare essentials, and in some places slightly less.Marcus couldnt shake the thought that he would be hurtling through space in a tin can lashed haphazardly to a nuclear reactor.He and his crew were about to become real space cowboys, riding out across the wild frontier.Like the ship, Donovans Gypsies were also reorganized.Most of his research staff made the transition: Sarah Park stayed on as sensor operator, and Mason Shen on communications, while Nils Jansen had no interest in leaving Earth orbit and found posting elsewhere.The grizzled and stoic Hector Pacheco continued as crew chief, but his work crews were entirely purpose built, so the hands that assembled the ship were replaced with professional low g miners before launch.None of the Gypsies were qualified to operate a nuclear powered exploratory vessel, so it was necessary to comingle their ranks with the original Jupiter mission crew.Marcus was put in charge of the mission, but Commander Alex Faulkland remained in charge of ships operations.Faulklands team would be responsible for navigation, maneuvering, and the day to day maintenance of the nuclear drive systems, while Donovans people would conduct the survey and mining.For the first time in his career, Marcus wished the Foundation had a rigid rank structure with a clear chain of command.The current arrangement was too ambiguous for his liking, and he had no clue who would prevail if (or more likely when) a disagreement came about.This feeling was made worse because he detected some hard feelings among Faulklands crew, and he harbored no illusions about who they would side with.The ships original mission would have set records for the most distant manned mission, and there was a lot of pride attached.Marcus just had to hope they were all professional who could adaptable to sudden changes in plans, because the one thing he knew for sure was that sudden changes were on their way.The rest of The Shackletons bunks were filled with Raos research team, which included Dr.Juliette St.Martin, a former leading theoretical exobiologist who returned to medicine when the political climate got stormy, and Professor Harris Caldwell, who was brought on as a geologist officially, and as an archaeologist somewhat less officially.With the ship completed and its crew assembled, The Shackleton Expedition left Earth orbit with little more fanfare than a Good luck from Bangalore, and then embarked on a wandering five month trek.Thrusters engaged and the Earth slowly shrank into the distance, until nothing was left around the ship but the sun and pin prick stars.Weeks and sometimes months stretched out between the short thrusts that transferred the ship from one orbital trajectory to the next, during which time, the crews only challenge was to fight boredom.The battle was a fierce, but there were thankfully no casualties.Then, after watching the same movies over and over until every line was memorized, after countless card games and late shifts making small talk, a couple hundred long days after Marcus plan was approved, they finally neared the fringes of the Themis family of asteroids.Marcus and Commander Faulkland were in one of the habitation pod dining halls, which stretched the definition of hall.It was a tight compartment just a smidgen bigger than any other on the ship.The men were seated on either side a metal table, where they were sipping reconstituted sludge from small plastic sacks.It was supposed to be coffee, but the resemblance was faint.Marcus had come to really enjoy that sludge, but it was an acquired taste.He nudged the deck of magnetized playing cards on the table, which had been shuffled but otherwise ignored for hours, and Commander Faulkland waved him off.Couldnt focus on a game right now, Faulkland said.That was the last thing Marcus expected to hear from the greying and hard faced commander.Way you tell stories, I figured you could play a hand of poker with your pants doused in burning napalm.Faulkland chuckled and took a slurp of his black sludge.Its not the mission.Ive got a weird feeling.Somethings not right.Marcus felt a pang of guilt.Hed hardly felt them at all since they left Earth orbit, but now they were coming back with a vengeance.He decided it was finally time.Listen can I come clean about something?I know ya been cheating at cards, Marc.Buy me a steak when we get back home, and Ill think nothing of it.Why did everyone always think he was a cheater?No, no About the mission.Just then, the intercom lit up and produced an F sharp.Commander needed on the bridge.Weve arrived at Waypoint Lambda Five.Roger that, bridge.On my way.He flashed a toothy smile at Marcus and said, Showtime.Whatever you wanted to tell me can wait for later.Probably not, Marcus muttered, but the ships commander was already through the door.Marcus had no choice but to follow.The bridge was like the rest of the Shackleton, except another inch more spacious, and every surface covered with a dizzying array of switches, dials, readouts and other things Marcus had no business fiddling with.It was also the only part of the vessel with a view of the outside, which at that moment was filled with a vast field of asteroids looming in the dark.Faulkland climbed into the captains chair and strapped himself in.The rest of the bridge crew were already at their stations and fastened down with five point harnesses.Take a seat, Doctor.The last word had a sarcastic sting to it, as it always did.You dont want to be floating free during this.The commander grabbed a black handset, pressed the button on its side, and in response, the F sharp rang out again.As he spoke, his voice echoed through the halls.Attention all crew and passengers.We are now preparing for final deceleration before entering the asteroid field.Find a suitable harness and strap yourself down, or youll be in for an unpleasant ride.Marcus clicked his belt, and then his eyes were filled with those asteroids.He picked through them trying to find his target, wondering if she might be visible from this distance, but it was no use.Zebra One was still too far out to identify, if she was visible at all.Alright, thats long enough.Mr.Macek, bring us about one eighty counter vector.Roger, Macek called back.As soon as the word was out of his mouth, the ship began to spin along its axis and the view of the asteroid belt ran from Marcus hungry gaze.Maneuver complete, Commander.The commander tapped his personal display and scratched his beard, then looked up and said, Sixty percent thrust for 326 seconds, on my mark.The room was silent as a tomb while waiting for the command, and Marcus imagined the commander was stalling just for dramas sake.Mark!Faulkland barked.Then it began.The entirety of the Shackleton was filled with a roar as its engines magnetically accelerated ions into space.The sound was shocking at first, but it was so constant and pervasive that Marcus numbed to it quickly.He was reminded of a class field trip to a hydro electric dam in the fifth grade.Hed been impressed enough by the massive structure itself, but the trip took on legendary proportions when he stood beside the dams thundering outlet.It was only then that Marcus began to understand some fraction of the billions of metric tonnes of water held on the other side, and the almost unimaginable force contained within.Now he was in the depths of space, imagining that dams immense strength at his back, straining against the Shackletons momentum.He started to wonder how the ships reactor compared to the dam, but abandoned the math.Better to enjoy the ride, he thought, and so he relaxed and stared out through the thick polycarbonate panes.He was pressed into his seat with a force equal to Earths gravity, and with a little effort of imagination, he was lying on the ground back home, watching the glittering night sky.During an earthquake.Next to a waterfall.The engines fearsome thrust lasted for just under six minutes, and then cut off as abruptly as it had begun.The sudden absence of noise left Marcus feeling hollow and reverent, like sitting in a church as the bells finished ringing.The ship came back around and the windows were again filled with a field of charcoal black stones that stretched into the distance.They were closer now, close enough that the size of the asteroids could truly be appreciated.As Marcus stared on in amazement, he wondered how humbling that view might be to the architects of the Foundations cathedral.Not very, he mumbled, only to realize he was talking to himself out loud.Faulkland glanced over at him.Come again, Doctor?Marcus looked a little sheepish.Nothing, Commander.My internal monologue slipped out.At the start of the voyage, a comment like that would have been followed by an uncomfortable silence, but Faulkland was accustomed to the Gypsies eccentricities after five months together.He just nodded and said, Understood.A view like this is liable to shake the best of us.The commander took another moment to admire the view, then grabbed the intercom mouthpiece and announced that it was once again safe to move about the ship.With the very talented Mr.Macek at the controls, The Shackleton slipped into the asteroid belt like a surgeons scalpel, using only the lightest thrusts to carve a path to their objective.The passing asteroids grew to even more fantastic proportions as the ship progressed, many dwarfing the largest mountains on Earth.Rao entered the bridge compartment quietly and found himself a spot next to Marcus.A glance at his face revealed a scientist in rapture, suddenly closer to the subject of his research than hed ever thought possible.He was the first in his field to view these asteroids with the naked eye, and Marcus thought he could hear Raos heart thumping madly in his chest.Faulkland indulged the eager scientist and asked, Would you care to tell us what were looking at, Doctor Rao?Of course.Without skipping a beat, Rao moved closer to the windows and started pointing out features on the asteroids, the way a tour guide introduces animals in his zoo.These are largely C Type asteroids, composed of silicates, sulfides  Then, 228 days after Marcus made his presentation at the Foundation headquarters, after a half hour of Raos excited lecturing on the composition of rocks, The Shackleton Expedition finally arrived at Zebra One.Chapter 5:  Contact  As the Shackleton Explorer approached its destination, there was nothing ahead of it but empty space.The atmosphere on the bridge had been peppered with excitement and discovery a moment before, but it was now thick with confusion.Then the ship passed through something.It was like a thin film or the surface of a liquid, and there was suddenly something massive out in front of them, so large that it filled the entire viewport and made all the nearby asteroids seem shrimpy by comparison.The object was long and thin like a cannon, and Marcus knew from his studies that it stretched more than thirteen kilometers from end to end, with a secondary structure attached to its hip that, while shorter, was still more than eight kilometers long.Seen for the first time in person, the sheer scale of Zebra One was confounding.The air of discovery rushed back into the bridge, electrified with total astonishment.It was moments before anyone could muster the ability to speak.Faulkland spoke first.He furrowed his brow, pursed his lips, and said, Ms.Park, bring up the survey image of Zebra One.She looked to Marcus questioningly, and he nodded his assent.An instant later, the image Marcus had presented to the GAF was floating above the holographic projector at the front of the bridge, right beside the viewport where the real thing could be seen.The image showed an object of the right dimensions, but with a glistening exterior that was black like obsidian, and ringed by a series of vertical ridges.The real Zebra One was entirely different, a greenish shimmering iridescent surface half caked in a layer of sediment, and bristling with tiny spires that evoked Roman architecture and insect anatomy all at once.Faulkland looked back and forth between the reality outside the window and the holographic fake.On his face, Marcus recognized the look of a man who had just been cheated at cards.Doctor Donovan.You wanted to come clean about something.I did, Commander.The beleaguered commander ran a hand through his greasy hair, past veins that were starting to throb on his forehead.Now would be the time.What in hell am I looking at?Marcus unbuckled himself and floated out to the front of the bridge, taking up station beside the projection.Park, please bring up the original.The image of his fictional asteroid was replaced with the final scan from Copernicus.Commander, this is Zebra One, an artifact of unknown origin which my team and I have been researching for the past seven years.We havent been able to determine what she is exactly, but I suspect shes not from our neck of the woods.Rao, awkward and nervous, said, Wait, its not metallic hydrogen?I must have been mistaken.It was half way between a weak lie and a bad joke.A growl rumbled deep in Faulklands throat.I dont appreciate being lied to, Donovan.Youre telling me this is what?Some kind of alien craft?Maybe, or maybe the alien itself.We couldnt be sure from Earth, which is why were here.Faulklands arms were crossed, and he was staring straight through the massive artifact.
