He flopped onto a sofa and pulled out his tablet.I know what the link is.I know why these particular stock samples were taken, and I think I know who may have taken them.Sharon sank down beside him as he activated the tablet.The treelike structure reappeared on the screen.There is a relationship between the genetypes, and this is it.Its a genealogy.What?She shook her head.That cant be right.We checked to see if any of the stock had been traded between gemtechs Maybe the stock hadnt, but these key sequences have.Traded or stolen, I dont know.His fingers slipped across the screen, pulling up infographics to demonstrate.Were not talking about normal parent to child transmission or sibling to sibling variants here.The relationship is limited to specific segments that have been spliced into otherwise completely unrelated genomes, engineered for completely different purposes.If you organize those sequences by the genetype file dates you can see how they change subtly, over time, as more and more alterations are made.So youre talking about something like generations?Parent, child, grandchild?Exactly, but generations as defined by manipulations in the lab, not natural procreation.Think of it as a genealogy of the engineering.He tapped back to the original schematic.The majority of the genetypes lie in parallel, not in sequencelike lots of kids out of the same parentsand came onto the gemtech datastreams over roughly a fifteen year period, which ended roughly twenty years ago.The sequential ones are iterations, subsequent tweaks of the same segments of code.Thats why there were three Gempro samples missing, two Recombin, and so oneven though within Gempro, within Recombin, the samples were from completely different product lines.Which tells us something about the sequences themselvesthey must have been incredibly powerful, incredibly important for something, to be used this much over this long a timespan.So someone was trying to get hold of...Sharon stopped and thought.Of all the descendants from a single sample?One individual?I think so.The similarities at the point they enter our picture herehe tapped at the trunk of the tree, a mangrove like structure with multiple lines that split and split againare very close indeed, sometimes just a couple of base pairs.But its not every descendant, its not going all the way to the end of the line.This is the main difference between what the hacker was looking at and what the thief ultimately stole.They followed up on some lines for a generation or two, stopped right away at others, but whenever they lose interest it seems to be because the next stage is a major transition.Sometimes its an end product and sometimes a dead end, but either way something completely transformative happens.I was able to check most of them.This one was a gillung precursor.This one forms part of the Recombin supersensory lines.And this came from the archive of one of those cybernetic graft labs that was shut down around eighteen years ago.Sharon shuddered at the memory.Who was the ancestor?You mean the original genome?I dont know.The lab was probably working from a cultured cell line, its impossible to tell anything about the individual it came from.Whoever they wereand bear in mind were going back at least forty years here, maybe longerthey must have had some mutation that proved particularly useful in a whole range of alterations.So much so that the gemtech that owned it kept on modifying and supplying the same sequences for literally decades.You can see how the engineering markers accumulate over time.Can you tell what the mutation was?No.Im guessing for such a wide range of applications it had to be something really subtle that would have an impact throughout the organism, something that enhanced the primary modification.Or complemented it.Maybe it made metabolism more efficient, or sped up neural development.Something like that.The thought that had been nagging at him, unshaped and inchoate, nagged at him some more and then fled again.He resolved to focus on it, try to bring it to the surface and understand what his enhanced intuition was trying to tell him, later that night when the business of the day was done.For now he held himself upright against the cushions and stayed quiet, watching Sharons face as she did her own processing.Right, she said finally, slowly.So the point of the hacks was to identify and locate every engineered version of a particularly potent set of genetic sequences that somehow got distributed throughout the entire gemtech industry.The point of the thefts was to secure physical samples of each of those versions, right up until the point where they got amalgamated into an end product.They dont want the end products, but they do want all the steps along the way.She looked at him for confirmation.He nodded.He suspected she was rehearsing the report she would be making to Masoud.Okay, so.Who took them, and why?What use are they to anyone now?That last one I dont have an answer for, but I think they were taken to complete a collection of the entire genealogy.And I think the key to who lies in the sequences that arent here.Look.He tapped in a command and pointed to the gemtech logos that now pulsed above each avatar of stolen genestock.Whos missing?She scanned them quickly.All the big gemtechs are there, except for BelNatur.We knew that already.Yes, but BelNatur should be there.And I know that because of this.He pointed to three mangrove trunks that arose at a later point on the time axis from the main clump, and bloomed into the logo of Gempro.The obvious assumption is that BelNatur simply never acquired any of that stock, so there was nothing for our hacker thief to steal from them.But thirty years or so ago BelNatur supplied the key sequences for these genetypes to Gempro.And the stock from Gempros work with those three was stolen.Theyre the same sequences.BelNatur did have them.Ive got them showing as a gap in the genealogy.Why werent the BelNatur versions stolen as well, then?They couldnt have been, because they were never at the EGA.I checked.And the genetypes arent in the BelNatur datastream archive either.But they have to exist.Fucking hell, she muttered.Her face had gone a bit gray.They would have had to be pulled out of inventory and excised from the records before the confiscation orders were even issued.They must have been.There would have been a window between the date of the hacks and the government crackdown.A narrow one, but enough.So either BelNatur is behind the whole thingor they just withheld their own samples of that stock and tampered with the datastream, knowing there was some value in it worth the risk.In which case the thief will probably try to steal theirs too.If he hasnt already.I think the first of those is far more likely, though I dont know if the culprit is the company itself or a former employee.Ive got you a suspect.He swiped the screen with its jungle of genetypes away and called up another app.A face appeared on the screen, and Sharon shuddered.The dossier of facts from the polices own investigation scrolled up beside it.This one always felt a little weird to me, a little too obviously in the clear, so when the rest of it started to fall into place I went back and did some digging.Technical director of a highly regarded integrated ops datastream company gets hired by the new European Genestock Archive, nothing strange there, except it was his old firm that installed their system in the first place.He knows it inside out.And look at where he worked before.He tapped at some links that were not part of the police file Sharon had supplied, and sat back in triumph.Thats just another private company.Wait, what?She leaned forward, squinting in disbelief at what had popped out of the opened links.Its a wholly owned subsidiary, once you track it back through a couple of shells.Holy.Fuck.The face continued to swivel slowly on the screen, left profile to full face to right profile: square, self satisfied, thoroughly respectable.Sharon stared at it as though it had just sprouted horns.I need to haul him in.Work out what his angle is, if hes working for someone...Yes.Rhys squirmed, looking and feeling momentarily embarrassed.I did almost hack his credit account, see if I could find evidence of a payoff.But then I thought you probably wouldnt be okay with that.Rhys.Sharon barked out a laugh with little humor.He could see the tension in her shoulders and hands, the way she sat poised on the edge of the sofa as though about to spring into action.No, Im afraid I would have had to disapprove if you did that.Leave the breaking and entering to the professionals.Yes, maam.Her smile held real warmth now.This is amazing.Youve cracked it, do you realize that?She grinned.Achebe will be beside himself.Thanks, but Ill feel better about it once we know what hes done with the stock.Rhys frowned at the tablet.I still cant work out why anyone would want those sequences now.Where did they come from in the first place?Who was the supplier?We need to hunt through their archive, see if we can understand what makes them so important.Thats another mystery.Its a gemtech Ive never heard of.Theyre not in the EGA datastream archive, and I couldnt find any record of them other than whats right here.Theres no trace at all.Sounds a lot like KAG, came the whisper in the back of his brain, and part of the connection he had been groping for clicked sweetly into place.It startled him so much he almost lost the thread of what he was telling Sharon.Some outfit called Phoenix.Binary       FIRESTORM       Binary       21  1703114AS TO: Zara Klist FR: Jonah Wycliffe RE: Phoenix ProjectUPDATECONFIDENTIAL The audit has been accelerated as per your instructions, though I am of the view that, so far at least, it raises as many questions as it answers.To summarize: the Phoenix Project appears to have begun as an attempt to understand, exploit, and mediate the properties of a uniquely mutated genome.There is no indication of where your late great uncle procured the original Phoenix genestock; the corresponding genetype did not bear any obvious engineering tags, certainly none that identify it as a product of Klist Applied Genomics.It has been suggested that it may have been developed by a rival establishment and come into his possession under questionable circumstances, and that this would explain the truly remarkable arrangements he put in place in order to keep it a secret.I must say I consider this explanation to be unlikely.As a stratagem it is far in excess of requirements, but more pertinently it does not accord with my memory of Dr.Klist, who was a man of unimpeachable character.I cannot imagine him stooping to such unsavory practices.What is clear, however, is that he was aware of the remarkable regenerative power of the Phoenix genome.It appears that it was this that allowed it to accept ever more radical modifications, many of which we have indeed seen filter back into the broader KAG genetype pool, to our undeniable benefit.(Though some, I fear, may also have filtered OUT, and made their way into the inventories of our competitors.While it was Dr.Klists edict that any commercially useful discoveries be returned exclusively to KAGmirroring the standing order he left with Finance that any such offers from the Phoenix Project be accepted without question and fairly compensatedthere has in practical terms been no mechanism in place to ensure that his instruction to THEM would be carried out.From the reports I have received regarding their ambitions for expansion, I have doubts as to whether what they earned from KAG over the years constituted the entirety of their commercial income. )Dr.Klists directive to the original Phoenix team clearly did not anticipate that they might become independently ambitious.According to the rediscovered charter documents, their objectives were meant to be twofold: to maximize the commercial potential of the genome, yes, but equally to find a way to allow the Phoenix to reproduce.His notes indicate that early attempts at cloning her failed.However there is no indication of any outstanding ability possessed by this female phenotype that would explain the desire to simply replicate her unmodified; still less to produce viable ova, and thus circumvent her native infertility.So the motivation behind this aspect of the Phoenix Project remains a mystery.Dr.Klist left a sealed protocol to be followed in the event of success, but no explanation.I confess I can understand why the researchers became increasingly focused on pursuing the more interesting, and more lucrative, avenues of inquiry presented by so remarkable a mutation, and why this trend became the norm as years and decades passed.Dr.Klists other priority would have become increasingly remote as the original researchers retired and new ones arrived; to the extent that this objective of Phoenix appears to have become forgotten.Eli leaned back, rubbing his eyes, and tried to think through whether what he was learning about the nested doll history of BelNatur had any relevance at all to the task Aryel had set him.It was becoming clear that this had been a particularly strange episode, and that efforts had been made to delete all records of itbut whether that cleansing had been ancient, from before the KAG datastream had even been placed in BelNaturs archives, or was of a more recent vintage he could not tell.He was following a trail of ghosts, imperfectly resurrected from a digital graveyard, and he had to admit it was the mystery of the thing that intrigued him.Part of that mystery was why they had been resurrected at all; he was no master programmer, and his standard issue searchbots should not have been able to reconstruct whole communications from shreds of data.Had the Phoenix correspondence been trashed but not wiped, were the bots struggling to pick related bits from some invisible midden of BelNatur detritus?There must be an explanation for the ephemeral nature of the ancient messages; it had thrown him badly, the way the files he closed after reading more often than not disappeared as though they had never been.Some popped open again when he frantically entered search terms composed of half remembered phrases, others did not.But format conversions and name changes had finally done the trick with those he did pin down: allowed him to mirror copies to his private stream so he could access them again.He could only assume that the deletion process itself had somehow undermined the safeguards that would normally prevent files from being copied offsite.He had grabbed as many as he could that way, focusing first on preservation and deferring consideration of the contents, until Callans worried face in the corner of his vision told him it was time to go; and had then sent up a silent prayer, that he would be able to find his way back in on their return tomorrow.He hoped for that even more strongly now.The story he had unraveled so far, mostly told in fussy, verbose reportage from the unknown Jonah Wycliffe and punctuated occasionally by acerbic responses from the equally unfamiliar Zara Klist, was tantalizing in its incompleteness; it felt as though he were reading some gripping pre Syndrome thriller, and had had to pause halfway through.So twenty years earlier, more or less, KAG Labs had discovered that its founder had left behind more than a Nobel Prize, the gratitude of a planet, and the foundations of early gemtech.Eli knew of Jarek Klist of course.Every schoolchild learned by rote the names of the scientists who had saved them from the Syndrome: a modern day communion of saints.He knew too that the current chief executive of BelNatur was descended from the legendary geneticist, but he had never heard of Zara.If Jarek was her great uncle she would be what to Zavcka, a second cousin once removed?So there was no more than a generations difference between them.Zara and Zavcka must know each other.The older woman had been at the helm of KAG when the Phoenix Project came to light, judging from the memos between her and Wycliffe.But it seemed she was not long to remain; filetags suggested that the messages had been deposited in the BelNatur archive within a year of being sent.Had the outgoing leader got her younger relative a job with the megacorp to whom she had just sold the family business?Perhaps Zavcka had inherited some sort of sinecure?If so she had certainly made the most of it.He shook his head sharply.Focus.Zavcka would know that her familys heritage was woven into the fabric of the company she now commanded, but it did not follow that she knew about Phoenix.Or that it was more significant than any other sordid, secret project in the tarnished history of gemtech.But what had happened to it, and what indeed had become of Zara?He could learn no more from reading the correspondence yet again.He tapped up another searchbot and began to look for Zara Klist.He was almost ready to go to meet Herran and Callan outside Maryam House the next morning when Aryel came in over his earset, sounding weary.Eli, Im so sorry.I should have gotten back to you last night...Dont worry about it.Hows Rhys?The news is bad, but he seems okay.Hes dealing with it better than the rest of us.Gwens been in a state, Reginald isnt much better.I think its just hit, you know?How serious his condition is.Cant they do anything?Theyre trying.Hes staying calm and rational about the whole thing, but Im not sure were helping.Things were a bit fraught.He finally got awayI dont blame himand went to spend the night with Callan.The rest of us stayed up late talking around and around and around it.Callans not going to want to come in today, is he?Thats okay, I can take Herran on my own, hes communicating really well now.Or we could just skip it, take the day off.That might be better.He felt a pang of regret at the thought of the delay.I think youll find Callan ready and waiting.Rhys is back here now.Somehow in the middle of everything he managed to make a breakthrough in Sharons case and hes working on tying up loose ends.She paused as though considering whether to say more, and evidently decided against it.He says the distraction is helpful.He ought to take it easy.Yes, thats what we all keep telling him.He says surely we have better things to do than stand over him, fussing.Is there any way I can help?Tell me what you called to tell me last night.I could use some distraction myself.He explained about the searchbots and the mystery they had unearthed, read her some of the messages.There was a sharp intake of breath at the subject of the memos, a small sound of incredulity at who they had been written to.Then a silence far too intense for mere polite attention.When he stopped there was a long, long pause before she spoke.Eli, you dont know how important...Ive been trying to find out what happened to KAG Labs for years.And this discovery they made, this secret project, it was called Phoenix?Youre sure?Yes.Why, does that mean anything to you?She was talking over him, a thing she almost never did, not hearing or not answering his question.And KAG didnt know about it?Seriously?Seriously.Up until the date of these memos, KAG thought Phoenix was just an obscure little lab out in the wilderness that every now and then offered them some really innovative R&D.They apparently didnt know they were supposed to get exclusive access to its findings.Even though it was nominally deeded to the corporation, it was also shielded from any interference or oversight.Funding was via an endowment that Jarek Klist set up before he died.So, until these memos, KAG wouldnt have been aware of what Phoenix was up to.Not beyond what the researchers saw fit to sell back to them via the arms length arrangement Jarek created.I see.Another long beat.He imagined her blue eyes narrowed in thought, the absentminded nibbling at the inside of her lip.How was it discovered in the end?How did they find out?By accident.It seems the Phoenix people wanted to expand the facility, and the reply to their application got copied to KAG.Who of course had no idea they were a trustee of the property until that point.The whole thing unraveled pretty quickly from there.A short, musical laugh in his ear.Municipal bureaucracy uncovers gemtech black lab.How delightful.What happened then?I dont know.Thats as much as I was able to get before we had to leave.Im going to see if I can find out more today.But Aryel, all this stuff is more than twenty years old.I mean, whatever Phoenix was up to, however bad it was, it doesnt tell us anything about BelNatur, then or now.Its interesting, but it isnt the part thats important.Im not sure about that, she murmured.But tell me the part you think is important.Ive been trying to find out about Zara Klist.The woman who was in charge of KAG when Phoenix came to light.What about her?It seemed strange that Id never heard of her, given how famous the Klist name is.Id always thought that KAG Labs folded after Jarek Klist died, but it turns out it went on for another twenty five years...That much I did know.Did you?Well...then you probably know they increasingly focused on core research, in vitro splices and sequences, just a link in the gemtech supply chain.Solid, but not spectacular.A big departure from the ethos it had when Jarek was around.And you think that was down to Zara Klist?Not just Zara.Jarek had a daughter, another Zavcka, who worked with her father for many years until she was killed in a skiing accident.Some time later her daughter, Zytka, joins granddad Jarek.Hes in his eighties by then.Zytka runs the company alongside him, just as her mother did, and takes over after his death.It would appear that Zytka is our Zavckas grandmother.Stone silence on the earset.Aryel?Im here.Where does Zara fit into this?She appears to come from a South African branch of the familyJarek had a brother who went out there as a young man.I remember reading a print interview with Jarek while I was a student, from when he won the Nobel Prize.He was talking about his grief at how his brothers family was devastated by the Syndrome, and Id gotten the impression that no one had survived.But clearly someone did, because a hundred years later up pops Zara and takes over KAG.From Zytka?No, from a caretaker board.There appear to have been provisions that kicked in whenever there wasnt a Klist available.So Zytka steps down after fifteen years or so, they run things for a while, and then Zara shows up.Interesting.I take it Zara disappears after the sale of KAG?Not right away.She sticks around for a year or two as a BelNatur board member before she resigns and returns to Africa.And the current Zavcka?The current Zavcka shows up on the BelNatur executive management team around ten years ago.Shes notoriously private: Apart from whats on her CV no one knows much about her.And that is pretty much all I could find out on any of them.Curiouser and curiouser.Yet another meditative pause.What do you think it means, Eli?I. ..honestly, Aryel, I dont know if it means anything.The Klist patriarch clearly set things up to ensure a member of his family would always have the top job in the company he founded.Nothing too strange about that, but it bothers me that there is so little sign of them anywhere else.I tracked down a few records, just enough to verify marriages, births, and deaths, but I couldnt find anything deeper than that.Anything personal.Or social.There are a few business related mentions, but nothing thats purely about them.Therere hardly even any pictures.I found a few of Zavcka the First, mostly taken in the company of her father, and thereve been more of Zavcka the Second since she took over BelNatur.But the only ones I could find of the others were a media shot of Zytka at Jareks funeral, and a portrait of the BelNatur board of directors during the time Zara was a member.Even their husbands dont seem to have much of a life onstream.Hardly any pictures or posts from them either.Is it only husbands?I mean, are all the Klists women?It appears so.Theres no mention of any of them having sons.Do they look alike?He was confused for a moment, as much by the urgency in her tone as the question.You mean the women?Yes, the women.Zavcka the First, Zytka, Zara, Zavcka the Second.Do they resemble each other?Not really.Well, hang on.He flipped through the images on his tablet.Come to think of it, they do.Different hair colors, but the faces are very similar.Can you send me what youve found?Sure.He tapped up her comcode.On its way.Apart from the fetish about female names starting with Z, the thing I cant wrap my head around is how does a dynasty as rich and powerful as the Klists go through generation after generation and leave so little trace of themselves behind?That doesnt just happen.It feels intentional.Im sure it is.But why?What are they hiding?I always thought Zavckas reclusivenessour Zavcka, Zavcka the Secondwas just a quirk.Now it looks like a strategy, one thats been maintained for over a century.And I cant imagine any good reasons for that.Do you think it has anything to do with the Phoenix Project?He bit back the reflexive dismissal, and reminded himself that Aryel Morningstar never asked stupid questions.Well, it obviously started long before the secret lab came to lightwait, you mean maybe Zara wasnt really surprised?Something like it might even still be going on?I dont know yet either, Eli.But I think youre right to worry.Her voice had gone reflective, tired again, a little sad.Let me think about it, see if I can come up with anything else.And...and if you learn anything more about Phoenix, please come talk to me.Binary       22 Sharon kept her smile tight and hard, and as devoid of amusement as a training sergeant on examination day.She knew that the sleepless night had left lines and shadows around her eyes, and counted it an advantage for this particular interview.Let there be no illusions about just how much trouble her guest was in.He did not look much better; few people arrested before dawn and taken into custody without the benefit of shower, shave, or coffee did.She could see, in the way he twitched against his rumpled shirt and ran his hand over a chinful of stubble, all the while glancing at the silent young witnessing officer who stood at the rear of the room, that he was trying to work some sympathy out of his state of general dishevelment.The faade of embattled and indignant innocence had been fairly well kept up, but cracks were beginning to show.Sharon rested her hands on the table, absentmindedly flicking a thumb against the curve of her wedding ring before she noticed the motion and stilled it.Tell me about the genestock.What about it?I dont know anything, I told you.I didnt even know it was missing until you showed up.Combative as before, and with the same air of disdain; but there was a touch, just the faintest shred, of fear about him now.She knew he would be trying hard to conceal it.Come now, Mr.Nance.If anyone was in a position to know everything about it, including how to remove it without triggering the alarms, its you.The only reason you took the job in the first place was in order to steal the genestock, isnt that right?The barest flicker of recognition before his face went back to a carefully blank hostility, but it was enough.She knew she had him.I dont know what youre talking about.Why did you conceal your previous employment?Ive never lied about where I used to work.And anyway, its not like it was illegal.It might have had some bearing on whether the EGA decided you were the right person to install their security and run their operations.I never worked for BelNatur.Lets not get bogged down in technicalities.They owned the business, they funded the operations, they were the primary client.Theres nothing illegal about that.So you agree that you did work for them.No, I said A pause.He would be replaying the conversation, trying to avoid catching himself in a contradiction.Sharon made her smile even flintier and pressed the advantage.I wouldnt want you to get confused, Mr.Nance, so lets recap what we know, shall we?You earned an extremely generous bonus payment during your final year, really remarkable considering that human gemtech had been severely curtailed, the Declaration was about to be issued, and BelNatur was in deep financial and legal trouble.But you helped them out in turn.You used those funds to buy out the subsidiary you worked for, transitioning its intellectual property and technical expertise into a new firm under a new name, a firm in which you had a major stake.You then won the contract to set up the EGAs integrated datastream and security systems, based largely on, and Im quoting here, remarkable insight into the inherent weaknesses that the Archive must be aware of, and the potential threats against which it must remain vigilant.The irony of that statement is really quite breathtaking.She paused for breath herself, and took stock.His fists were clenched on the table, and his mouth was clamped shut.So then, having made such a huge success of your new ventures first big commission, you immediately wound it down in order to take a much more modestly paid position running the system youd just installed.My guess is you got that job based on the premise that no one else could understand it and take full advantage of its capabilities as well as you.I suspect that was absolutely true, though not in the way the EGA imagined.What I find fascinatingshe made a show of leaning forward and tapping up information on her angled tablet screen, though everything she needed was already thereis that your partner in the business, JKE Investments, didnt seem to object to this at all.In fact, even though the whole thing ended up posting a considerable loss, theyve since made several rather large payments into your Abu Dhabi credit account.Which I notice isnt mentioned anywhere on your European Federation tax return, by the way, but well leave that aside for now.She looked up, held his eyes and let the last vestiges of the smile slide off her face.Who is JKE, Mr.Nance?He managed a smirk.It was fairly unconvincing, and there had been no mistaking the spark of worry at the mention of that name.You tell me, since you know so much.Ill be able to do that very soon.One way or another.I admit the datasearch is taking a little longer than expectedtheyre very well shielded, far more than is reasonable for an ordinary private investment trust.But were closing in.Weve already gone through the first layer of extraterritorial satellite registration, down to the Caribbean, across to Dubai, back up into space and now over toshe squinted at the feed scrolling up the edge of the screenEastern Europe.Almost home.You need to consider, Mr.Nance, that if I find them and find out what theyve done with the stock before you get around to telling me, Im not going to have any reason to go easy on you.He tried to cover his unease with sarcasm.Oh, is that what youre doing?So far that is exactly what Im doing.I dont know what happened to the genestock.I cant tell you something I dont know.Who did you hand it over to?Who says I handed it over to anyone?So you still have it.No I dont.Then who did you give it to?No one.I told you.She regarded him gravely for a long moment.A dead drop?Is that what youre trying so hard not to tell me, Mr.Nance?Im trying not He stopped, shook his head and spat, Im not trying to tell you anything.Yes you are.Youve been trying to tell us how clever youve been for a couple of weeks now.You just didnt expect us to turn out to be as clever as you.And there it was at last, the reaction she was looking for, shaken out of him by the shock of her ambush: a wash of pallor, jaw slack for a moment with surprise, a jolt of real fear.Rhys had been right.And how interesting, that it was this revelation that concerned him most.Sharon sighed, putting a little theater into it.Time to drop the final bomblet that Achebe had uncovered last night while they were pulling the case together for the warrant application.You know, Mr.Nance, when I met you I thought you looked familiar but I couldnt put my finger on why.Turns out it was because Id met your brother only a couple of days before.You resemble each other.Hes taller and thinner, of course, and he hasnt changed his surname.You have.Why was that, Mr.Nance?He stared at her, bewilderment at the sudden change of subject sliding quickly into fury, then into something else.For the first time there was naked hatred on his face.Sharon could hear the other officer react to it, a sharp intake of breath and a shifting of stance.I decided it was for the best.I dont have to explain why.Were you trying to distance yourself from your family, or shield them from your anti Declaration activities?Or just make it harder for anyone to work out what you used to do for a living?I wanted a new name.A new start.People do that all the time.He spat it out, struggling for composure.They dont, actually.Its quite rare.Also, most people dont have a brother who leads an evangelical UC splinter group.Did his actions at the concert that night have anything to do with why you decided to let the police know that a major theft of highly engineered genestock had taken place under their noses and there wasnt a damn thing they could do about it?I didnt He stopped.She thought he was trying to work out whether it could be to his advantage to admit blowing the whistle, while still denying the theft, and was unsurprised when he apparently concluded it wasnt.My brothers activities are embarrassing.Are they?Is that why you spent an hour onstream with him the night he was arrested, and why you posted his bail?Hes my brother.Hes never done quite as well as you, has he?Never had the grades, the career, the sense of conviction.Hes a fairly ineffectual character, really.But still youve supported him, like a good brother shouldalthough if he embarrasses you it could only be by not taking as tough a Reversionist line as you would like.You share a lot of his views, Mr.Nance, and you hold them far more strongly even than he does.Weve been taking a look at your life onstream, all your handles and the forums you post to.Its been very enlightening.Your brother made a fool of himself that night, but its clear from the comments you made that thats not how you saw it.You felt he had been humiliated by a pair of gems and the institutions that now protect them, and it made you angry.It made you want us to know we were being made fools of in turn.So you pointed us at the stolen genestock, you gave us the finger, because you wanted to see us run around in a panic; and you were certain we could never trace either the theft or the tip off back to you.But you were wrong, Mr.Nance.And here we are.He was breathing hard now, face red, teeth grinding behind white lips.The explosion was close, and after it the collapse.She needed to push just a little harder.Historys going to repeat itself, Im afraid.Your brother will get a slap on the wrist, a telling off from the judge, a hundred hours or so community service.You, on the other hand, will get the full whack.Criminal conviction, custodial sentence, seizure of assets...He came up out of his seat, teeth bared, slamming his body against the table so that it and the tablet shook.The chair fell over behind him.Even though she had been expecting something like it, it took all Sharons self control not to flinch as he screamed into her face.You think you can do anything to me?You nasty, unnatural, traitorous bitch!You cant fucking touch me!You think I dont know who you are?What youre married to?Sharons right hand was up and clenched, the signal to the officer who had surged forward behind her to hold position.She resisted the urge to punch Nance with it.Hard and fast in the larynx, be weeks before he could speak again.You think Im afraid of you?!I have protection, you hear me?You cant prove anything!You Sit down, Mr.Nance.You dont deserve to carry a badge!Call yourself police Sit down!It was a controlled shout, honed by years on the beat: low and sharp as a whip crack, and with all the command she could put into it.He stared in amazement as she sat at ease, as though nothing had happened, and then took in the officer standing behind her with stinger baton half drawn.Sharon said, very softly, Im not the one you need to be afraid of.She let the moment stretch, let the reality sink into him, until he stepped back from the table with his hands open and raised.A flood of invective continued to tumble out, low and vicious, as his eyes stayed fixed on Sharons face.She flicked two fingers up and the officer moved, hand still on the baton, to right the toppled chair.Shut up.Thats enough.The chair slammed back into place.You cant talk to Inspector Varsi like that.Its fine, constable.Sharon spoke peaceably, fingers laced together on the table again, posture deliberately relaxed.Mr.Nance is entitled to his opinion.Sit down, Mr.Nance.She injected steel into her voice.I wont tell you again.The chair was prodded against the back of his knees, none too gently.He went quiet and folded down onto it.The constable stood behind him, fists on hips, until Sharon gave her the nod and she strode back around to her place, the color still high in her pale face.Guess its okay to dish shit out to our own, but no one else is allowed.Good to know.She returned her attention to Nance.Youve made a very big mistake, Mr.Nance, she said, quietly, so that he had to stay quiet himself in order to hear.Use the adrenaline crash, dangle the possibility of a way out.And I think you know that now.You might have had protection once, but you wont anymore.If you hadnt sent us that message theres a good chance no one in the EGA or the police would ever have discovered the theft.And I think, Mr.Nance, thats what JKE wanted.And expected.It was never part of their plan to have the police hot on their trail.I think whoevers behind them is going to be very, very pissed off when they find out just how badly you have screwed things up.And they will find out.Theyre not going to be looking out for you then, are they, Mr.Nance?No, theyre going to be getting as far away from you as they can, theyll be finding ways to drop the whole thing on you.Isnt that right, Mr.Nance?He was shaking his head, whether at her or himself she did not know.There were traces of spittle on his lips.They wont...they cant Oh, I think they can, and I think they will.And you think so too.He sat there for a while, shoulders slumped, head hanging down.He would finally, she thought, be taking in the entire depth and breadth of the hole he had dug for himself.When the words came, they were bitter and broken.What do you want?She sat back and let out a long, silent breath.Her reply was no less bitter.I want details on how you beat the system.I want to know all about JKE.And I want you to tell me about the dead drop.Their icons snapped into place, the hair thin lines that linked generation to generation glowing bright as the program he had written matched up sequences, measured the infinitesimal shifts of mutation and manipulation, and confirmed the suspicion that had nagged at him all night.Rhys stared at the screen as he and Gwen slotted with the neatness of inevitability into the genealogy he had worked out the day before.He did not know whether to howl with rage or dance for joy or cry.He had formed the conviction that it would be worth checking, worth testing, probably pointless but just in case, no reason to think they were but no reason to believe they werent.Then he had fallen asleep while wrestling with the paradox that unless he already had his genetype for comparison, he had no way of finding out whether an analog of it sat somewhere on the Phoenix ancestral tree.A circular conundrum, an insoluble riddle.Until he woke up with the answer.A full genetype included the huge, unwieldy dataset of the underlying genome; but without the index of engineered mutations and the epigenetic directory of intricate molecular switches that regulated their expression, it was barely useful.Everyone relied on those registers; every analytical tool was keyed to them.They extracted meaning from millions of base pairs, translated the information, organized it.They told engineers and doctors and desperate young gems not only where problems lay, but where solutions could be found.Having the genome alone was like having a complete set of grid references, but no actual map.And that was all he had of himself and Gwen: just their genomes, decoded by the hospital, a string of six billion inscrutable indicators.And the genomes into which the Phoenix sequences had been inserted, sitting like bedrock beneath the rest of the hacked data, so obvious he had been unable to see it.And the indices that mapped those sequences back to their insertion points, that he could use to compare with the same points for himself and his sister.And there they were.He traced the lines with his finger and mulled over the implications.So KAG Labs had also been a Phoenix client, and like Phoenix had disappeared.On its own this information was of little use.But he was connected to Phoenix, and by more than just coincidence.The segments of his own genome that the medical team had identified as being where the problem most likely lay were a tidy subset of the sequences he had found embedded in stolen genestock.Somewhere in the layered history of splices and recombinations, something had gone terribly wrong.Somewhere in that same history, in the panoply of variants that the thief had taken, would be the key to putting it right.Think, Rhys.A rustle on the edge of hearing, a hint of spice and musk, a sense of presence.He said, Hi, Ari, and looked up.Hey.She stopped at the threshold where the narrow perimeter walkway opened into the expanse of the living room and leaned against the wall, surveying him.Ive got some news.So have I, he thought.But youll tell me to back off, Ari, leave the business end of it to Sharon, get permission before I hand these genetypes that Gwen and I are related to over to the analysts.Im not sure I can do that.But Im not sure what else I can do.What news?Ive just found out where KAG Labs went.She told him.Hang on.Youre telling me KAG is now part of BelNatur?Yes and no.BelNatur absorbed them completely; theres not even a listing on the datastream.The messages Elis searchbot found were resurrected from trashed files.Think there might be some trashed genetype files there too?If there are itll be more than he can do to search them out.He said he saw no sign of any filetype other than messages.Itll take some proper forensics work to see if theres anything else there.Can we ask?He stopped.His mouth had gone dry with foreknowledge of what the answer would be.Aryel was shaking her head grimly.Yesterday, certainly.I neednt even have mentioned Elihes not sure how he accessed this stuff, and clearly he wasnt meant to.But it wouldnt have mattered.I couldve just said that after much research weve learned that KAG Labs was acquired by BelNatur almost twenty years ago, and weve a KAG gem with a serious medical condition, and would they like to further enhance their reputation by helping to save his life?And the head of the company would have had no choice but to say of course, anything we can do to help.But today...Today the gem who needs saving is the same one who just implicated them in a criminal conspiracy.He felt panic rise in his chest.But maybe its not them, maybe this guy Nance was working for someone else.Maybe theyre in the clear and theyd still be willing to help.She sighed deeply.I have a horrible feeling that they are involved, Rhys.Maybe not the whole firm, but the person at the top, the person Id have to ask.I cant go to her directly now, not without compromising Sharons investigation.We have to wait.For how long?Until the threads shes tugging at unravel a bit.Until BelNatur is either under formal investigation itself, in which case we can get a warrant to search the archive under an imminent threat clause.Or until its cleared, in which case were back to where we were yesterday, and I can approach Zavcka Klist.You dont think thats the way its going to turn out, though.I doubt it.And an investigation creates all sorts of problemsfor the infotech project and what we hoped to get out of it, for Eli, potentially for Mikal.Its going to take a little time to work through, Rhys.Probably a couple of weeks.I dont have time, Ari.Im close to another episode, I can feel it.I might not have two more weeks.She came away from the wall and lowered herself onto a chair opposite, reaching out to ruffle her fingers through his hair as she sat.The gesture reminded him of how he and Gwen used to cuddle up on either side of her when they were little, one under each wing, while she read them stories or taught them their math.Or let them amuse themselves, playing beneath and behind her while she buried herself in her tablet, her focus complete as she studied the world into which they already knew she would one day venture.Ari, the adopted big sister, always loving and caring but always with a bigger mission.I will get what you need from them, I promise.I wont fail you.But you need to be patient and to trust me.And whatever happens, you need to stay well.He nodded soberly, not meeting her eyes.All these other considerations, all these other people and priorities.A spark of rebellion flared in him.It isnt just Dr.Walker.Herrans there.If he knows what to look for he can find it, easy.Theyd never even know.Binary       23 Getting back into the deleted KAG sub archive proved easier than Eli had expected.He had the trick of it now, and Rhys would have been interested to know that he had already spent a minute or two trying to determine what else might be accessible, and disappointed to learn that he had found no trace of any genetype files.There were indeed other dull gray links into what would once have been its datastream, but these really were broken; no amount of tapping and typing would prompt them into life.Eli was almost relieved.What he most wanted to pursue, the message files, were still there; still evanescent, but capable of being cornered and copied if he worked fast.As he grabbed and mirrored, grabbed and mirrored, he realized they were not as jumbled as he had at first thought; he might not be seeing every exchange between Zara and her army of minions, of whom Jonah Wycliffe appeared to be the commander in chief, but what he was getting was clear and chronological.It was also very limited in scope.This was not a random selection of retrieved messages from the lost datastream of KAG Laboratories.They were restricted to a narrow timespan around the discovery of the Phoenix Project, and had two other things in common: Every one was a communication from or to Zara Klist, and every one had Phoenix as a subject line.It was as though the searchbot had gone looking specifically and exclusively for evidence of how the chief executive had dealt with the discovery of the secret lab.Finally he had another half dozen or so messages, neatly stacked below those from the day before.The first appeared to be a direct response to the explanation Wycliffe had sent.1703114AS TO: Jonah Wycliffe FR: Zara Klist RE: Rv1: Phoenix ProjectUPDATECONFIDENTIAL Reports appreciated but fail to address primary concern: what are these people up to NOW?Regardless of ones opinion of JKs instructions, the fact remains: they should have been followed to the letter, they were not, and enormous funds have been spent instead onWHAT?Nguyen has advised that sequences acquired from Phoenix, while generating high value output, were probably inexpensive to develop.Meanwhile cryptic references to breakthrough modifications and extreme tolerance levels (with which I am becoming progressively less amused) suggest in vivo experimentation, for which neither they nor we are registered.Are they growing live prototypes down there?If so how many, whats the cost value, and what are the legal implications?If they dont want to be shut down immediately they had better start explaining what it is theyve got thats so special.The tone of that felt both familiar and pass; like something her younger relative would once have said.Eli shook his head as he tapped up the reply.The more of her he read, the more Zara reminded him of the Zavcka he had met four years ago.It made him wonder again about the transformation, about whether it was really possible for someone so entrenched in a particular way of thinking to change so much.1803114AS TO: Zara Klist FR: Jonah Wycliffe RE: Rv2: Rv1: Phoenix ProjectUPDATECONFIDENTIAL I have finally extracted a bit more from Dr.Panborn, who reacted with much indignation when informed that without specifics we are not inclined to treat her claims as anything more than hyperbole; and with horror at the realization that, unless they give us reasons to think otherwise, she and her colleagues are at this point entirely dispensable.Reasons have been duly advanced.She confirms that in vivo experiments have indeed taken place, though somewhat irregularly.This has been alongside the in vitro work that we knew about.They have been attempting to develop marketable applications of what she insists truly is a breakthrough.It began with an initial test batch back in 100, which was (as is generally the case) largely disastrous; the lead researcher at the time used an inter species splicing technique as a rather flamboyant method of assessing the degree of anatomic plasticity that the Phoenix sequences could render tolerable.The resulting dysmorphia was as extreme as could be hoped, but the integrity of core organ systems was nevertheless largely preserved.One of the subjects in particular displayed none of the typical indicators of cognitive or physical deficit, despite a vastly altered physique, and indeed has appeared to develop more or less normally.Attempts to replicate her have failed, though Panborn insists this is beside the point.In her own words: The prototype is a female juvenile who has a functional pair of additional limbs.Furthermore, her overall anatomy, metabolism, hormonal and neural function appear perfectly adapted to what is an unprecedented modification.This systemic cascade of complementary mutations has been a scientific treasure trove, and has informed our understanding and further refinement of the relevant sequences and switchesseveral of which KAG has already had the opportunity to work with.The extra limbs, though functional, are not in our view inherently useful (there are some on the team who consider them to have aesthetic value, though that is a matter of opinion).However, their core architecture should be amenable to the design of a platform with significant industrial and combat applications, and we are actively developing the relevant modifications to test this.As a parallel development, we have had significant success recently combining a variety of metabolic, sensory, and neural enhancements within a standard physique package, and are within a decade of bringing the results to market.So there you have it.Cybernetics is a fashionable field at the moment, and one in which we have only a peripheral stakeif Panborn is not being overly optimistic then there really could be some significant value in their current research.I gather there remain about a dozen live specimens from a total of 4 batches (50% survival rate, not bad), mostly late infancy to early preadolescent.The exemplar prototype is of course already adolescent.The resident expert on her is a Dr.Owen, who was part of the original batch design team and has carried primary responsibility for its results ever since.They seem to consider the lack of registration an irrelevance, given the current low levels of enforcement.Panborn continues to insist that Phoenix should and must be left alone, though I sense with somewhat less conviction.How do you wish to proceed?Eli read the quotation from Dr.Panborn again.Premonition settled over him like a cloak, like the charcoal gray shroud a diminutive gem with sky blue eyes and a face as delicate as porcelain had once worn.He reached to tap the next file open, slowly, like a man in a dream.His finger shook.1803114AS TO: Jonah Wycliffe FR: Zara Klist RE: PhoenixSite visitCONFIDENTIAL Advise Panborn, Owen etc.to expect us at 17:00 on the 20th.Non negotiable.Industrial and combat?Based on that am inclined to arrive with hazmat and full security detail.They have 24hrs to convince me to make it you and me on the XJet instead.Supplementary limb pairs have been attempted before.Spectacular failures.If theyve managed a neuromuscular infrastructure compatible with combat implants it would be well worth developing, though I am not inclined to alter our own registration status in order to do so in house; there are reputational issues to consider, and I am not convinced that the publics newfound interest in gem welfare will dissipate soon.But in any event, such a breakthrough is not compatible with Panborns refusal to provide images or a more detailed description.Suspect we may be going to visit the circus.Does this prototype of theirs have a second pair of working arms, or does she gallop on four legs like a horse?Anger now, at the contempt, the callousness, the gratuitous nastiness of it all.Whoever she was, whatever she was, no fourteen year old girl deserved this.And shame, because none of it was ancient, none of it was beyond responsibility, he was already a young man in college when these words were thought and said and sent.He had read and heard such things before, many, many times, and shame took hold of him and shook him like a dog shakes a rat, every single time.Shame and anger and disbelief.It cant be, he thought.Not her.No one could ever have spoken of her like that.He had almost convinced himself as he opened the reply from Wycliffe.It was uncharacteristically short.1903114AS TO: Zara Klist FR: Jonah Wycliffe RE: Rv1: PhoenixSite visitCONFIDENTIAL They are expecting us and are pretending to be pleased about it.When asked for details on the prototype, Panborn shunted me to Owen.Owen refused to respond and shunted me back to Panborn.I was finally able to get them both on a voice conference, which has just ended.They attempted to explain their reluctance by claiming that sending any visual or audible record offsite would prove too great a security risk; but said they were worried that if they simply described her I wouldnt believe them.This went on for some time.I finally extracted a verbal description, though they were not wrongI can hardly credit what they have told me.They say she has wings.Callan glanced out at Eli, hunched over his tablet in the sound dampened seating area, and turned back into the lab.There was a spring in the step of the researchers today, and Sevi wore a broad smile, though the circles under her eyes told of a sleepless night.You understand it now?Seriously?I think so.Theres a lot more to do, but that went exactly the way I hoped it would.She was beaming as she stood beside Herran, half reclined in the chair with the sensor net on his head.Was that okay for you, Herran?I know it was a little different from what weve done before...Okay.Do you mind if we run a few more tests like that?Not mind.If we get the results I expect we can refine the parameters pretty quickly, but well have to stop in between to recalibrate.It might get a little boring for you.Not boring.I work.He raised his tablet, clutched as always in his small fist, and waggled it slightly.Callan lifted an eyebrow in response.These last few days of disruption, filled with the things Herran normally dislikedbeing tested and endlessly talked to, being taken away from homeappeared to have had the unexpected effect of making him more expressive.They had been greeted this morning by Sevis bubbly conviction that the neural translation team had finally made a breakthrough in its attempt to decode the binary structure of his mind, and Herran had reacted with more than his usual remote equanimity: He had engaged in the conversation, he was interested.For the first time Callan found himself questioning whether he really understood how Herrans compromised psyche functioned at all.Now the little gem did his half body turn toward the doorway, though from his seat he was unable to see through it.But he looked pointedly in that direction, before turning back toward Callan.Eli okay?Yeah, just busy.Working.Mm hmm.Something came up yesterday, I think.But hes fine.Herran gazed at him steadily for a long moment, then blinked hugely and solemnly.As the long lashes fluttered down and up again Callan realized with surprise that it had become a gesture, an element of body language, like another persons shrugged shoulder or his own raised eyebrow.Where did he learn that?From Mikal?Eli fine.Rhys not fine.What did you hear?Hes okay, he hasnt become ill.Could get ill very bad.I know.I. ..he might, Herran, but he hasnt yet.Theres still time.Need find genetype.Quick quick.Yes...Callan wondered if Herran had been hacking Rhyss medical files.He wouldnt put it past him.A shadow fell across the door, and Eli poked his head in.Hows everything going?Really well today.Sevi, nodding in her direction, thinks shes cracked it.Have you?Oh.Thats good.He looked dazed, distant, a little sick and not really interested in what Sevi might or might not have cracked.Herran looked at him, unspeaking, and blinked.Callan looked from one to the other and thought, Something is going on here.Im missing something.But Sevi was too elated to notice.Looks like it.She grinned at Eli.We were thinking about it wrong, layering our own assumptions over Herrans reality.We thought he must be like a person with primary and secondary languages, and that binary would be the secondary one.But its not, its as native for him as human speak.More so, maybe, because more of his brain is dedicated to it.Now that we understand how he organizes the information we should be able to move a lot more quickly.Thats good.Eh, Herran?Good.Do you think?Eli looked from Herran to Callan to Sevi, as though searching for something.He seemed lost, disoriented.If everythings okay here, do you mind if I step out for a bit?II have to see Aryel.Again that stricken look.Somethings come up that I really need to talk to her about.Callan found himself suddenly afraid, for no reason he could name.He nodded dumbly, unable to formulate even a basic question.Sevi chirped, Fine by me!and turned away to set up for the next test.Herran blinked.Go, he said.Aryel explain.Binary        Legacy She is a cousin this time.She resolves to be a daughter in the next incarnationit makes things so much easierbut the maternal link had begun to feel dangerously overused.So she made herself distant, thrice removed, and wonders now how much else has escaped her notice while in exile.He hid his gift to her, from her, and he hid it in plain sight.A strategy not unlike her own, and she is as aware of that irony as she is of the sick feeling in the pit of her stomach at the other uses to which he has had it put.So she was this to him too, and she swallows down the knowledge, and tries not to mind.There are more immediate concerns.His covert enterprise was never intended to stay hidden so long, and she must take steps, quickly, to ensure that the discovery of one secret does not reveal the other.That irony would not entertain.Especially not now, when she is long accustomed to her isolation, long reconciled to the fact that what had mattered most to him matters not at all to her.She is content with fictional procreation.How strange, she sometimes muses, that one possessed of such vision could not think of legacy other than in the old, tribal terms: ancestral blood in the veins, familiar features on bright young faces, wisdom whispered through the lengthening night.She has no need of such distractions.She is her own birthright.Even if his wayward disciples had remained true to the task he set them, even if they had found the solution he so longed for, she is far from sure she would have availed herself of it.But they succeeded at something.They have fashioned a different prize, it seems, unsanctioned and unexpected, but no less valuable for that.The mystery of it excites her, and in this at least she has no doubt that her father would be of the same mind as herself: It is his gift to her, and she wants it.Binary       24 Heres the thing, Sharon was saying.I dont believe he didnt know who hired him.Even if he never dealt with them directly, which is what hes claiming, it does not make sense to me that hed take those kinds of risks unless he knew who was behind it and he was confident they were going to hold up their end of the bargain.Not to mention that, as a hard line Reversionist, hed want to know he was getting it for people who werent far apart from him in terms of ideology.But he will not name names.She gazed up at Rhys out of the screen of his tablet, her brow still creased in annoyance.Her voice came directly into his earset, and he had activated its damper field so he could not be overheard either.Not that they were likely to be; he was in his bedroom with the door closed, and a strangely pensive Aryel had gone up to the roof garden.But Gwen could come back at any moment from whatever recording session or publicity opportunity had been scheduled that morning, and he knew too well how sharp her hearing was.Why is he refusing to talk, if hes got no reason to be loyal to them anymore?I dont think its loyalty, Rhys.Hes scared.Hes so scared hes not even constructing good lies anymore.He tried to convince me that it was all done onstream and for the final phase he was sent a list of the stock they wanted, but then he got caught out trying to explain how he knew about the hacks.Do you think he was also the hacker?He may have been, although we dont have any direct evidence for that.But he definitely knows his way around gemtech datastream securityseems he developed a good chunk of it.And considering that the whole point of turning anonymous informant was to show off what a bunch of mugs we are compared to what a talented little criminal he is, its possible he only included the hacks because he was responsible for them too.That part, the whistleblower thing, that was because of Gwen?Seriously?Believe it or not.Small world.It just seems really stupid.People do stupid things when family is involved.He got so angry about his brother, he lost the plot.He could see her frown deepen and her eyes slide away before she set her jaw and looked straight at him again.It was a cue Rhys recognized from their work together, the thing she did when she was uncertain but about to plunge in anyway.I wondered...I know I should be leaving you alone, Rhys, and if youd rather just step away from this now Ill understand.Gwens involvement was a complete fluke, but I thought I should tell you...and you said having something else to concentrate on was helpful...It is.Actually he wanted to be focusing on the problem of disinterring his genetype from the bowels of the deleted BelNatur archive, but he had learned more about what he was looking for from working the case than in all the previous years of searching.Instinct told him to keep that avenue open; and besides, he had grown too fond of Sharon simply to tell her no.Is it his Reversionist links you want me to look into?No need, Achebe has that covered.And anyway its not illegal, justindicative.She grimaced slightly.Its trying to uncover who he was working for and what happened to the dead drop that has me stumped.It feels like its all right there, you know, but I cant pull the pieces together.I thought maybe you could spot whatever it is Im missing.Ill do my best.What was the dead drop?A disused mailbox set into the wall of an alley in the financial district.A what box?Whats that?It was a pre Syndrome message distribution system, back when everything had to be printed and sent to geographic addresses.Theyd get pushed through a slot and fall into a chamber behind, and then an official would come along with a special tool to open the chamber.They were made of metal, waterproof, fireproof...So it would hold temperature.Yep, I thought that when we opened it up.Very cold, even though its a blazing day.Theyre still accessible?Theyre not supposed to be.There are only a handful left in the entire country, mostly inset into buildings or walls of historic value.The slots are supposed to be sealed shut, but this ones been tampered with.Its rigged with a catch: If you know where to press itll open and then snap shut again once you let go.Nance said the genestock vials were sealed inside a super insulated flexcase; it would have slipped right in.He made two deposits.He also said his instructions were via ghost message, you know, the kind that auto delete?One way only, so he had no way of telling anyone when hed made a deposit.And he was explicitly instructed not to try, just to drop whatever he had whenever he had it.And I do believe that, because he seemed truly baffled about how anyone was going to know it was there, much less get it out.Hacked security vidcam.Easy.Except there arent any eyes on that alley.Its not really a shortcut to anywhere, just a dogleg between buildings with major roads at either end.Sheer walls on both sides, London brick.As for getting into the thing, one of my guys had to borrow what we needed from a museum.There must be something.A microcam.We scanned for vid signal and found nothing.But guess which building is right around the cornerliterally fifty yards or so from the end of the alley.I couldnt believe it; I hadnt realized it would be so close until we got there.BelNatur.Yep.Guy even strolled up and introduced himself as head of security, asked if there was a problem in the area he should know about.I checked he was who he said he was and we had a little chat.Said they didnt have any cams on it, seemed surprised the city doesnt either.But he said it was far enough away from their building, and anyway they havent had any security concerns for a few years now.Hope nothings changed in that respect, Inspector, if we can be of any assistance, blah blah.It was like all the stories Mikals been telling me about the new and improved BelNatur.She paused.But.But.Seems a little too close for coincidence to me.
