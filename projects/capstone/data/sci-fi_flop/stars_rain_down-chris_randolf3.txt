What now?one of the other four jumpsuits asked.Find water, Nikitin replied.He looked up and down the ravine they were hiding in.This used to be a creek, I think.Should lead us toward water, give us a little break from the wind as we go.Jack could hear two or three more flying cuttlefish in the distance.Either that or his head was worse than he thought.Yeah, itll keep us out of sight, too.Anyone know where we are?Nikitin shook his head.Fat chance.Everything looks like landfill, and this shits so thick I cant find the sun.Could you make out any landmarks from the cockpit?Jacks memories were still scattered, coming back in flashes that faded just as quickly as they arose like embers spitting out of a campfire.He closed his eyes and tried to play through it, and all he saw was a dust cloud stretching off to the horizon.Nope, he said.Nikitin looked down at his watch.Well, well have a better idea at sundown.I should be able to figure something out, what time zone were in at least.Until then, lets make tracks.Weary and bruised, the corpsmen climbed back to their feet and dusted themselves off.The jumpsuits that were once bright orange were already growing dingy, turning the same shade of brown as everything else in sight.Jack knew that Nikitin was doing the right thing; they had to keep moving.The weight of their situation might sink in if they stood still too long, but there was always hope as long as they were moving forward.Better to keep going, keep pressing on toward something, toward anything at all.Settlements clung to running water, and with a little luck, they might find some scrap of civilization that had survived the massacre.For the first time, Jack realized he wouldnt even mind running into Blade Aerospace or Carbon Corp troops.Nikitin looked up and down the ravine again.To Jack, both directions looked equally inhospitable, but using some method that he couldnt guess at, Nikitin picked a direction and said, That a way.The rest of the corpsmen started to march.Nikitin waited to pull up the rear with Jack.You alright to walk, pal?Yeah.Just needed a couple minutes to recharge.Good.Nikitin gave him a hardy slap on the back that hurt more than it should have.You know me, Jack.Im not real big on this leadership crap.The sooner you can climb back into the hot seat, the better.Leadership meant responsibility, and that had never been Nikitins strong suit.He was a real hero type to be sure, the kind that went to the zoo ready to jump into a lion cage at the first shout of My baby!He would never let Jack down, but he preferred to have the option.Leaders dont have that luxury.Jack was just the opposite.He ate up responsibility like a shark after chum.Gimme a few klicks to get my head on straight.Sure.One other thing, though, Nikitin said, and he craned down to Jacks level.Thanks for saving our bacon in the viathan.That was some true blue hero crap, and wed be a pudding splat without you.The memory of a spinning cabin flashed through Jacks head, accompanied by the feeling of tumbling out of the sky.Hed never heard Nikitin thank anyone for anything, and at first, he didnt know what to say.The only answer that came to mind was the trite catch phrase from the old ERC recruiting commercials.As he started to recite the words, Nikitin chimed in and they said them together.No need to thank me.The Corps saves lives.Its what we do.Chapter 11:  Anatomy  The thing that really struck Marcus Donovan about Zebra Ones interior was the emptiness.As his team trundled down the long corridor, there were no access panels, controls or anything for a person to interact with.There hadnt been any junctions, nor were there any markings indicating where theyd been or where they were going.He wasnt foolish enough to expect a wall map with a big red arrow labeled You Are Here, but anything at all would have been nice, and something resembling writing would have been even better.Instead, he was left to wonder whether the original occupantsthe nativesused written language at all.It was possible that their writing was in a wavelength he couldnt see, but the teams few peeks into infrared and ultraviolet revealed nothing worthy of note.Still, he felt like the natives must have had some way to keep track of their location, and as his exploration continued on, the possibilities occupied his thoughts.Small round ventilation organs ringed the corridor every twelve meters, and it was possible they released pheromones, or some other chemical marker that neither his team nor their equipment could detect.Communication by stink, as it were.That led to an image of man sized ants and Zebra One as their hive, but neither idea excited him very much.The team had detected several fluctuating EM signals in upper radio frequencies, and Marcus toyed with the idea of electromagnetic communication.That was momentarily interesting until he imagined the natives as bipedal platypi, electro sensitive duck bills and all, and he cast the idea aside.Besides which, the signal could just as easily have been some kind of electrical equipment, and his team hadnt discovered any meaningful pattern in them.For just a moment, he wondered if the natives were telepathic, and Zebra One had been trying to communicate with him since he arrived.Maybe, he said to himself, hed stumbled into the land of acid trip kaleidoscopes and crystal balls, with a totally blind third eye.Perhaps hed brought the wrong kind of gypsies along.The thought made him burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, which attracted unwanted attention, and prompted one of Juliette St.Martins check ups.While she inspected him, Faulkland and the others took a closer look at the glowing walls.The light followed them as they traveled along, so that they were continually in a lit section of corridor about ten meters long that faded to reddened darkness at either end.Is it just me, or does it feel like were walking in place?Faulkland asked as he moved his hand along the wall.An electrical pattern traced the motion of his fingers, exactly as had happened outside, but the effect was less striking here.The miners were unconcerned with the lack of progress, but that wasnt surprising; theyd spent most of their professional years walking through nondescript tunnels.Ignoring the alien architecture, this was all just a days work for them, Marcus figured.Not that he knew much about any of them.They kept to themselves, and every attempt to find common ground had been rebuffed.I wont lie.Im feeling kinda frustrated, Marcus said.Walking a straight hallway with no turns isnt exactly my idea of high adventure.Maybe this is a service duct.We could turn back and try another iris, Juliette said.Marcus never liked turning back.Not yet, he said.Ive got a feeling were missing something here.He started to chew on his lower lip.The problem felt familiar, or at least the frustration did.It felt like trying to solve a riddle.He hated riddles.They werent real problems, as far as he was concerned.Real world problems had multiple solutions, each with its own strengths and drawbacks.They could always be solved through some combination of persistence and creativity, or failing that, they could be circumnavigated.Riddles, on the other hand, were contrivances.They were tricks with only one answer that was intentionally hidden behind misleading words and false imagery.To solve a riddle, it was necessary to throw away ones preconceived notions.Either that, or hit the person with the answer.Marcus weighed the two options and considered the cutting torch on his belt, but he wasnt ready to cut the Gordian knot just yet.That only left re examining his preconceptions.Someone tell me what a tunnel is.Marcus was thinking out loud, and realized he sounded like a perfect idiot.One of the miners answered, A passageway through solid material, connecting two or more places, sir.It takes you some place you want to go, right?I guess, another miner replied.Not much point in building a tunnel to somewhere you dont want to go, is there?Yeah, youd think.Except that so far, this tunnel hasnt gone anywhere at all.Maybe the problem isnt the tunnel, but where we want to go.The words came out of his mouth, but didnt seem to make sense.Not yet.He was still putting the pieces together.Judging by the sour look on Faulklands face, Marcus wasnt only confusing himself.Are you on the right pills, Doc?Just trying to get outside of the box.Im not even sure what Im saying.Juliette picked up the slack.No, you might be on to something.Weve been working under the assumption that there are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels, criss crossing the interior and connecting everything together.So we picked a direction and marched off, ready to go wherever the tunnel led, right?Sounds about right, Faulkland said.What if weve got it all wrong.What if the entire vessel is made up of bundles of these things.Not hundreds of kilometers, but thousands.With that much complexity, no one could be expected to find their way.One solution would be to open only the tunnels that lead to your destination.Faulkland had his arms crossed again.So youre suggesting that weve been headed nowhere in particular, and the tunnels been just pleased as punch to take us there.Essentially.Not that it helps.There was quiet while everyone considered that, until one of the miners stepped forward.Something else is bothering me.There are no trams or carts anywhere.Who would force their work crews to walk this far, present company excluded?Marcus grinned at that.Maybe the natives could get around faster than us, he offered, but that didnt seem sufficient.I have a different idea, a miner with a young voice said.I keep looking at this weird corridor, and Im listening to that thump thump thump, and I know this sounds crazy but I cant help thinking were in a great big vein.Like maybe its designed to pump us around to wherever the ship wants us.Thats not bad, Juliette said.Not bad at all.So how do we convince her to take us somewhere?I dont know, maam.The miner sounded dejected, as if hed just failed a pop quiz.Marcus smiled and patted him on the shoulder.No worries.If you came up with all the answers, Id be out of work.Not that he would have minded a couple more answers just then.A lot of good ideas had come out of the discussion, but there wasnt anything actionable.There was nothing Marcus could work with, yet he knew there had to be some answer.He refused to believe the tunnel went nowhere and connected nothing.He started thinking back to Iris Charlie, which theyd passed through only an hour before.Was it really his proximity that opened the door, or was it something else?He played back the event, trying to recall every small detail.In the memory, he floated closer and reached out his hand, then the iris melted away from his touch.A fraction of a second after the memory ran through his minds eye, he heard a strange noise.At first, he didnt pay it any attention.Doctor Donovan, Faulkland said.Tell me you did that.Marcus looked up and realized that one of the walls had vanished, revealing a branching tunnel identical to the one they were in.I dont think I did.There was an idea running through his head, but it sounded too ridiculous to be true.It wouldnt be silenced, though, and there was only one way to test it.He tried to imagine the opening of the iris in reverse, the fluid material of it sliding back into place.As he did so, the wall closed almost exactly as he imagined.He repeated the process several more times, now imagining the wall itself opening and closing, and each time it did just as he imagined.It was even growing more responsive.I did that, Marcus said quietly to himself.Acid trip kaleidoscopes and crystal balls.Son of a bitch.How?Juliette asked.He needed a moment to think, and held up his finger to pause the teams questions.How far did this go?He imagined the wall closing only half way, and sure enough, it moved to match, leaving a round hole in its center.How about words?He ran the word open through his mind as clearly as he could, but there was no response.Doctor St.Martin, do me a favor and imagine the wall opening, just the way it has been.Youre joking, right?Do I look like Im joking?She closed her eyes and a moment later, the wall slid open.When she opened her eyes, she looked like a child who just unwrapped a bicycle on Christmas morning.Did I do that?she asked.You did.Without a pause, Juliette started performing the same tests Marcus had a moment before, until she was thoroughly convinced that she was in control of the wall.She finished her tests with a flourish, twisting the surface of the wall into a spiral before finally closing it.My God she said breathlessly.The ship can read minds.Do you understand what this could mean?Not only does it support the existence of psychic phenomena, but there are bigger implications.Stranger ones.The ship can understand us even though were not the original inhabitants.That could mean sentient thought constitutes a universal language.While Juliette flew off into the theoretical, Marcus was starting to dig into the practical.What other images would the ship respond to, and how would she respond?He had an idea how to tell her where he wanted to go, and there was no time like the present to try it out.Marcus closed his eyes and focused on their camp site near Iris Charlie.No response yet.He ran through every detail, calling to mind images of their equipment on the floor and the mission transponder.Nothing.He decided to go global, imagining the entire ship, and then zoomed in on Iris Charlie itself.Then it began.Marcus?Juliette asked in a worried voice.He opened his eyes, and realized he was floating in mid air.He had been concentrating so hard that he completely missed the feeling of being lifted off the ground, and now he was suspended perfectly in the middle of the passage.The lighted walls started to pulse, beating a pattern back toward where they came from.The heart beat thump of the tunnel grew louder and more fierce.Whats going on, Doctor?Faulkland shouted.I dont know, but I think Im about to find out, Marcus said.As the last word came out of his mouth, he was away and falling down the tunnel at unimaginable speed.It took every ounce of his will power not to scream as he plummeted down the passageway, only to come to a halt seconds later.He was back at the camp site.Jesus Christ!Marc?Are you there?Marcus, respond damn you!The tunnel lowered him back down, and he allowed himself to collapse.Lying on the floor with his arms outstretched and his heart racing so fast and hard that it rocked his whole body, Marcus Donovan began to laugh.He laughed until tears ran down his cheeks, and he didnt stop until he was exhausted.Im fine, he finally managed to say.Im great.All the way back at Iris Charlie.This changed everything.Their original plan to map out the interior wouldnt work.In fact, it didnt make sense anymore.They would need to conceive a whole new style of exploration, where the destinations came first.The survey information was a pretty good place to start, along with the original scans from the observatories.With any luck, theyd be able to communicate pieces of her anatomy in images she could understand.Donovan to all teams.Ive made a discovery you might find interesting.Chapter 12:  Exterminators  As Jack and his team pressed on through the raging dust storm, he continually had to remind himself they were still on Earth.Hour after hour revealed nothing but devastation, and the once blue skies were hidden from view.All they could see was the cracked and withered land beneath their feet, while a brown fog, thick with debris, blotted out everything beyond.The world was unrecognizable except for the fallen trees that littered the ground.It might as well have been Mars, or the ninth ring of Hell for that matter.They followed the twisting ravine, breaking every hour for a rest that Jack kept short.He knew they had to keep up their momentum as long as they could, and cover as much ground as possible before night fell and reduced them to total blindness.Each one was carrying dry rations and two liters of water in their service pack, which meant food for a week and water for a day.Considering the kind of strain they were under, he didnt want to estimate how long theyd last without a fresh source of water.In normal circumstances, their supplies would have been more than enough, but no one had ever imagined a situation like this.It was a grave oversight which Jack was paying for, and their only hope for survival lay in Nikitins hunch.As they went, the cycling sound of the alien cuttlefish never ceased.Jack could always hear at least one of them nearby, moving in circular patterns.He knew from experience they were search patterns, and he did his best not to imagine what was happening every time they stopped.Each time, it was just long enough to unleash a volley of their screaming weapons before continuing on.The ravine provided enough cover to keep them out of sight, and Jack suspected the aliens scanning technology wasnt very thorough.Less sensitive than a leviathans by a wide margin, at least.Several times during their journey, the silhouette of one of the cuttlefish passed overhead, and each time, Jack expected it to swoop down and incinerate them, but it never happened.After more than three hours and fifteen kilometers over broken terrain, Nikitins hunch panned out.The dry ravine met a live river, knee deep with fresh water.Another hundred meters on, they could just barely make out the shadow of a settlement.Theyd made it.Jack motioned for a huddle.Me and Nicotine are gonna scout ahead.The rest of you, break out purification kits and refill your packs, then find somewhere to setup camp.Gather brush for camouflage while youre at it.If the village is a bust, well overnight here.Got it?Roger, they said and broke from the huddle.Everyone sounded exhausted.Albright patted Jack on the shoulder, then held out the flare gun and two shells for him to take.The gun was made of brightly colored plastic and looked like a toy, but never the less filled him with unease.Hed cleaned and bandaged so many wounds that the thought of any gun made him angry.For emergency use only.Load cartridge, cock hammer, aim at sky and pull trigger, Albright said.Im not sure if well come running or get the hell out of dodge, but either way, Id feel better if you had it.Fair enough, Jack said.If you see the flare, just leave.If were not back in two hours, do the same.He took the gun, popped the breach and looked inside to make sure the chamber was empty, then tucked it into the strap of his service pack and dropped the shells into his pocket.She didnt say a word, just nodded her head and joined the others busy at the waterline.Nikitin appeared beside him, raring and ready to go.Makes ya feel like a big man, dont it?Nikitin didnt have any aversion to firearms, and never failed to give Jack crap about his.He had a small collection of rifles back home that he treated like children, and he usually spent his vacation time alone in the wilderness, hunting big eyed creatures that never saw it coming.Jack never could figure out how Nikitin dealt with the cognitive dissonance.I dont want the damned thing.You want it?Naw.Might confuse it for a real gun and try to play hero.Better leave it with someone level headed like yourself.Come one.We should get a move on before it turns dark.The two of them climbed up the side of the ravine and back into the battering winds of the dust storm.They kept their heads down and scurried from one pile of debris to the next, creeping up on the village in ten meter bursts.They could make out more details at each stop, and it wasnt a pretty picture.Broken walls and shattered wooden beams came into view, against a hillside in the background which had long ago been cut into scalloped and irrigated terraces, now pockmarked with jagged craters.They stopped at a pile of masonry and waited, on the look out for any kind of movement, but there was too much dust in the air to see anything clearly.For a moment, Jack was tempted to grab Nikitins binoculars, but he only wouldve seen dust and more dust beyond it.They crossed the last stretch of land and immediately pinned themselves to a brick wall.It was connected to two others which were still standing, the third having fallen in towards the center of the building along with the roof.Every other building in sight was much the same: barely held together, with hand painted Chinese signs on whatever walls remained upright.From there, Jack and Nikitin skirted the edges of the village and listened for voicesfor any signs of peoplebut there were none.They silently passed one shattered building after the next, some still smoking from recent attacks.Jack imagined that Nikitin was feeling just as hopeless as he was.Then they caught sight of movement.Both men reacted the same way, instinctively ducking for cover in a darkened doorway.The buildings roof was in pieces, and the rubble inside left only as much space as a closet.It was a wonder both of them fit inside.They tried to breathe as quietly as they could while they watched the road and awaited the silhouettes approach.It was moving slowly and coming straight down the center of the pavement, and as it drew closer, Jack thought for a second that it was wildlife.Another moment later, he changed his mind completely.It wasnt large, maybe as big as a teenager, and it walked slowly on all fours while calmly surveying the area.Its body looked oddly shaped for that kind of movement, though, with proportions that were altogether too human.Front and rear legs were the same length but shaped differently, the front pair being more spindly and ending in fully formed hands.As the creature passed by, Jack could see that it was wearing a mechanical mask not unlike his own, from which two long, pointy ears protruded outward and upward.It was also carrying some sort of ornately decorated rifle on its back.Although distinctly exotic in design, an embossed branch and leaf design made the weapon look like some kind of Victorian relic.A noise sounded in the distance, like a horn or an animal howling, and the creature stopped in its tracks.It stood up on its hind legs, took a last glance around the area and thankfully missed Jack and his partner in their hiding spot.Then it turned toward the source of the noise and leapt off, returning to all fours and sprinting as a jackrabbit would.Follow it?Nikitin asked quietly.Unless youve got a good idea, Jack replied.They crept out, making sure the coast was clear, then started off towards the source of the noise.They moved from one broken building to the next, using rubble piles for cover.It didnt take them long to make it to the far end of the village, where another discovery awaited.They crawled on their bellies to the top of one particularly large mound of debris and peeked over the edge, only to find one of the alien cuttlefish sitting motionless on the other side.Nikitin took a quick scan with his binoculars, then handed them to Jack who took his time studying the scene.There was something going on in the space between the ship and the village, but Jack wasnt sure what it was.The aliens had collected a pile of human bodies, which were watched over by a handful of the jackrabbit creatures, and another type of alien that couldnt have been more different.The new type reminded Jack of nothing so much as a bipedal rhinoceros, although the similarity only went so far.They were massive and walked fully upright on thick, tree trunk legs, while their equally thick and muscular arms hung far out to the sides.Jack could just barely make out another, smaller set of arms closer to the middle of their torso, which they kept hidden away.What skin he could see was rough and grey, but most of it was hidden beneath an armor that glittered like the inside of a geode.Those armor plates extended to their long heads, where it ended in a sharp horn at the tip of their snout.The rhino creatures had something even weirder on their backs.At first, Jack thought they might be backpacks or machines until he saw one move.It was twitching.He continued to stare in wonder, making sense of the shape little by little.It looked like a giant water strider, with its long legs clinging to the rhinos back.He briefly wondered if the bug might be controlling the rhino, but there was no way to know.Whaddyu think?Nikitin asked in a hushed voice.I dunno.Collecting them for food, maybe?Jack was a little surprised at how detached he sounded.At how detached he felt.He couldnt figure out where all his moral outrage and disgust had run off to.He felt as if the pile of bodies should affect him more.Maybe.I wouldnt treat food that way.No ones loading them onto the ship, either.That was true.The creatures didnt show any real interest in the pile of corpses.It might as well have been a pile of scrap wood on a construction site.This wasnt for show; it was just business.Then Jack heard plaintive cries that were all too human, which grew louder until two rhinos emerged from the thick dust dragging a young woman by the arm.She was screaming at the top of her lungs and thrashing against their grip, but it was no use.After another moment, a third kind of creature appeared behind them, floating in mid air, swaying back and forth gently like seaweed in high tide.This thing looked to be made of the same material as the ship, covered from head to toe in sharp bony outcroppings.Everything about it hinted at sea life, even the glowing blue green eye set off centered on its head.It was like some kind of floating prawn/human hybrid with a mermaids tail, and six thin, waving arms.The two rhinos dragged their captive to the pile of bodies, and Jack pieced together what was going on.Without thinking, he pulled the flare gun out with one hand, and lifted a flare from his pocket with the other.He cracked the breach and loaded it.His hands began to shake and he was sweating all over.Leonid Nikitins hand pushed the gun back down.We cant save her, Jack.The woman screamed louder when she caught sight of the bodies.The sound pierced Jacks ears.There had to be a way to stop this.Frantically, he looked all around, trying to find some weapon, some answer, but there was nothing.They were surrounded on all sides by the hollow corpse of a village, and the sounds of a doomed woman.For the first time he could remember, he was ready to kill.His heart was thumping like the pistons of a locomotive, and he was ready to kill them all with his bare hands if he had to.Before Jack could climb to his feet, Nikitin pinned him back down.It was effortless.He moved his head close to Jack, and so very near a whisper, he said, There are only two ways this plays out.Either she dies alone, or we all die together.There is no third option, hero.I know you wanna save her.Its what you do, but that just aint happening this time.There are other folks out there we can still help, though people who need you, Jack, and Im gonna make damn sure you survive long enough to save em.You understand me?Jack struggled under Nikitins armso slobbering mad he couldnt form wordsbut he couldnt move a centimeter.He might as well have been pinned under a school bus.There was no escape, and so he watched with unblinking eyes.A rhino lifted the thrashing girl up and dangled her above the ground, and the floating prawn man made a motion with one of its many arms.It was a command.In response, the rhino palmed her head in its mammoth hand and snapped her neck.The screaming stopped.Jacks hot breath filled the oxygen mask and he grunted in anger.Down below, the rhino tossed her limp corpse onto the pile and walked away to join its companions.Business as usual.A passage opened on the outside of the ship, and all but one of the alien creatures walked in.A lone jackrabbit waited longer than the others, all the time staring at the pile of bodies, then it shook its head, sprinted up the ramp and was gone.The fin surrounding the cuttlefish started to wave, and the clothes washer sound started.That noise filled the air as the ship lifted into the sky and disappeared.Nikitin released his grip on Jack the moment the ship was away, and they both lay there in stunned silence.It took ten long minutes for the lone thought in Jacks head to stop repeating, commanding him to kill them all.When he finally returned to his senses, he said one word.Bastards.Been a real bad afternoon, Jack.No shit.Dusk was swiftly turning to night.But tomorrows another day.Another day like this, Jack thought.He was close to calm again, but his chest was still shaking.Thats what they say.Lets get the others and bring em back here.Theres still plenty of shelter.We grab some shut eye, and hunt for supplies in the morning.Something tells me there arent any survivors, and the bastards wont be back any time soon.They waited another minute there atop the rubble pile, collected their thoughts, then climbed back down and headed off toward the stream.Chapter 13:  Eye in the Sky  The Copernicus Observatory hurtled around the Earth, completing each lap in just over an hour and a half.Phileas Fogg would have been positively green with envy.Under normal circumstances, the stations suite of multi wavelength active and passive scanners would be staring out away from the bright blue globe, penetrating into the depths of the darkness beyond, but this wasnt a normal day.Copernicus continued on at its dizzying pace, but the lights were out and the three technicians charged with babysitting it had forgotten all about the stars.Instead, they hung around in silence, together watching the fate of their planet while trying not to think too hard about their predicament.The invasion had been carried out with frightening efficiency.Strange discs arrived from out of nowhere, jammed all frequencies, and then bashed everything in orbit apart.The only possible explanation for Copernicus survival was that the station was powered down during the attack.Whether the invaders thought it broken or had simply failed to notice it was up for debate.Either way, none of the three men aboard was in any hurry to flip the generators back on.The next phase of the attack happened while Copernicus was on the other side of the world.The station came back around, streaking over Europe and then the Mideast, and as it approached Pakistan, the crew caught sight of twin mushroom clouds reaching high into the sky.Two objects had struck with unimaginable force, one in India and the other in China, leaving vast craters and dust clouds that swelled up and swallowed the entire continent.After that, nothing could surprise the crew of Copernicus.The invaders torched the orbital launch centers which ringed the equator, removing any ability to mount an offensive in space, and then they bombarded population centers all around the globe.Their communication cut off, cities everywhere were hit completely unaware, with coastal regions receiving the brunt of the punishment.They erupted into short lived balls of blue flame that left nothing but charred ruins and the immolated bodies of the dead.Human civilization was annihilated in three hours, before even one alien bothered to set foot on the ground.Then, with the ashes of empires still smouldering, the seven vessels made planetfall in Africa and South America.The action was over by the eighth hour, and with the atmosphere recyclers turned off, the air inside of Copernicus Observatory was getting stale.All three crewmen were suited up but refused to don their helmets.Without radio communications, being sealed up would be too much like being alone, even though none of them had spoken in hours.Sometime after it was over, Marco Esquivel broke the silence.So, he said, are we slowly committing suicide or what?What the hell?Hopkins asked in dismay.I dont know, Jansen said, ignoring Hopkins as usual.We cant call for help.Doubt theres anyone left to call if we could.What about Midway or Tranquility?Ares?Theres gotta be someone somewhere.I mean, we survived.Someone else must have.Hopkins was a frantic mess, just like any other day.Marco put his hands behind his head like he was lying in a hammock on a Fijian beach.I guess.The invaders came right to Earth, so those guys might still be alive.Radio is screwed, though.Janses nodded.Wont know for sure till we kick the power back on.Wait wait wait, Hopkins said, waving his hands about.We cant turn the power on.Thats the only reason they didnt frag us in the first place.Jansen took a whiff of the air.He didnt need any instruments to know that oxygen was running low.No power, no oxygen generation.So theres our choice: do we suffocate all slow like, or do we perish in a glorious ball of flame?Marco chuckled.Pretty clear which way youre leaning.Why not?Put me down for the blaze of glory, too.Hopkins crossed his arms in frustration.Sons of bitches.Fine.Do whatever you want.Ill see you in hell.Jansen drifted toward the control panel.Thats the spirit, Hop.You got what the French call a joie de vivre, you know that?His hands danced through the generator activation procedure, and the console beeped in approval.After another second, he could hear the stations generators starting to cycle.Hopkins had turned ghost white.Even whiter and sweatier than normal, in fact.What do we do if they come for us?Jansen said, Say cheese.Die, Marco offered.I suppose if it makes you feel better, you could go outside and chuck a stapler at em.Who knows maybe they have a secret vulnerability to staples.You could be a hero.Im pretty sure Im gonna give em the finger, Jansen said after some thought.But not just any finger.I mean, this would be a historic flip off.The finger of the ages.See, I wouldnt just be giving them the finger on account of myself, but as a representative of humanity.Hopkins pouted.I fucking hate you guys.With good reason, Jansen agreed as he looked out the window at the smoking ash heap that was his planet.Bad news, though.Were all youve got left.Hopkins groaned for a very long time, so long that Jansen began to wonder if the man might be part whale.Hopkins certainly looked the part, with his big bald pasty white head.Maybe one of those melon headed whales, or a pilot whale.When Hopkins unnatural groan finally finished, Jansen looked back to the console and saw that the generator was running at full output.In other news, he said, fiat lux.He hit ENGAGE and the lights came on, followed shortly afterward by a draft of sweet fresh air.Thank God, Marco said.It was starting to smell like a jock strap in here.Jansen smiled sheepishly.Sorry.Skipped my shower this morning.Hey Hop, why dont you give the comms a try?The whale man swam over to the comm console.Sure thing, Nils.So you can blame me when the aliens blow us away, right?Youre catching on.Getting anything?Gimme a second.The whale man slapped the console several times with his sweaty flipper.Nope.Whole networks static.Marco, still in his imaginary floating space hammock, laughed.Alrighty.There might be someone to call, but we still cant call them.That brings us back to slow suicide.Real slow if you like.Weve got supplies to last for a couple months.Maybe more if were stingy.Christ.Do you have to be such nihilists?Jansen gave Hopkins a dry look.Hey man, I dont hear you coming up with any brilliant escape plan.He didnt want to die.Not at all.It just seemed like the only option.He realized that the lack of options might stem from his atrophied imagination, though.Heres an idea.Instead of whinging, why dont you use the contents of that massive cranium and come up with some way out of this?Marco had floated all the way across the command center, where he reached out and knocked on one of the numerous control stations.The dull metal clank echoed through the chamber.Copernicus is, like, the pride of the Foundation, right?Were inside a shiny new multi billion credit deep space scanning doo hickey, and youre telling me theres no way to send an e mail?Waaaaait, Hopkins said, dragging the word out while his brain spooled up.I bet the active scanners can cut through the interference.We fire up the actives the microwave laser or the infra red, and use it to send Morse code or something.Jansen sighed.Its a maser, dumb ass.And not to rain on your parade, but I dont know Morse code.Do you know Morse code, Marco?Do I look like a boy scout to you?Marco chuckled derisively and went on.Screw that noise.Use the comm networking protocols to generate a packet stream, and pipe it through the maser.Instant output device.You can do that?Jansen asked.I thought you were just a wrench monkey.I took network programming in college, so maybe?Probably not.Wont know till I try, though.You think Hopkins can do the bullshit he said?Jansen looked over at the sweaty, quivering mass of flesh that was Larry Hopkins, and they all shrugged in unison.Sure.Why not?Were literate, college educated men.We have tech manuals.Weve got more time than we can shake a stick at, and we dont have any TV to distract us.Im filled to knees with hope.Marco climbed into a chair.Sarcastic bastard.So, what message do we send?Survivors on Copernicus.Send help.Hopkins said.Marco looked skeptical.Yeah.Thatll bring em running.How about Busty bikini models on Copernicus.Starved for love.Come quick and bring beer?Jansen looked down at the generator panel, and the long list of systems waiting to be activated.None of them had a purpose anymore.He idly wondered how things might have turned out if Copernicus were a great big railgun instead.Then he read the word telescope and an idea caught fire.Nobody out there has any clue what went down.Not Midway.Not the Moon.Not Mars.Why dont we point our big fat telescope at Earth, and show them whats happening?Not bad, Marco said.Hopkins nodded enthusiastically.Yeah, I like it.Each of them floated silently in their own corner of the command center.They had a plan and a vague idea of how to accomplish it.The deadline was months away, and since they were all professional technicians, they wouldnt bother to start for at least another week.Not as if anyone was left to fire them for laziness.As he stared at the wounded Earth and started to zone out again, one thing really burned Nils Jansens biscuits: Donovan and his nerds were tens of millions of kilometers away, completely ignorant of this whole catastrophe, and having the time of their lives.Hed had his suspicions before but now it was official he made the wrong damn decision.He hated when that happened.Chapter 14:  Valentine  The members of the Shackleton Expedition were having the time of their lives.It didnt take them long to master Zebra Ones unique method of transportation, and soon they were flitting about and mapping the ships internals faster than they ever could have dreamed.There was a specific approach that proved most effective: an explorer pictured the entire vessel in their mind then focused down to their intended destination, and the ship took care of the rest.Once a person had been to a location, though, all they needed do was picture it again and off they went.The system was learning.A third of the group were especially talented, able to pick up the process in under a minute, and were then able to get around effortlessly.Most of the rest could navigate the ship after a half hour of practice, and a few needed a couple hours, but precisely two simply couldnt get any response at all.One of them was the cantankerous Professor Caldwell, and the other a young miner named Terrel.Both tried well into the second day under mounting frustration, but the ship wouldnt take them anywhere.Zebra One otherwise reacted to them normally, providing light and displaying the electrical pattern when they touched the walls, but they were both eventually forced, rather embarrassingly, to travel with someone else who could operate the transit system.Doctor St.Martin latched onto both men and became their permanent tour guide in return for a chance to study them in detail.She very badly wanted to understand how the transit system and its psychic interface worked, and she believed that the two mens inability to use it might hold part of the answer.It was also discovered that any of the irises could be opened from the inside with a thought, similar to how one operated the transit tubes.From that point on, the stream of personnel on and off the giant alien ship was constant.Teams worked in rotating shifts, composed of everyone aboard the Shackleton except for a skeleton crew of three who watched from outside.That crew included Mason Shen who finally allowed himself to get some sleep, only to immediately return to the communications puzzle the next morning.There were never fewer than five people aboard Zebra One at any one time, including Marcus Donovan and Commander Faulkland, who each felt compelled to stay following their first incursion.They claimed to be quarantining themselves to avoid infecting the rest of the crew, but no one much believed them.In truth, each man was in his own way enamored with the strange alien vessel, and it would have taken a platoon of marines to drag them away.Exploration began in a handful of key areas.They were all hollow cavities detected during the years of scanning, which the Gypsies deemed most likely to hold important systems.The team targeted the smallest ones first, and each cavity offered wonders stranger and more perplexing than the last.There was a great vaulted arcade with a ceiling lit in every color of the rainbow and columns curved like a ribcage.There was a dank cavern full of organic structures that looked like fruiting fungi, and a branching network on the lower decks that was best described as a swamp.One of the most mystifying was a perfectly circular room with concentric rings of clear water set in the floor.Professor Caldwell suspected the room might have had religious significance to the natives, but it was more a hunch than anything.No one else had a better idea.There were also areas that were less mysterious.They discovered several large cell like networks of rooms that were undoubtedly living quarters, each complete with its own sleep area and not unfamiliar waste collector.The quarters were clustered around evenly spaced dining halls, while small recreational parks were always nearby.Much of the forward fifth of the craft was full of rod shaped structures connected in series, starting very large and getting progressively smaller and more numerous as they approached the bow, all focused on the huge cavity at the front of the vessel.Debates erupted over the purpose of that cavity, with many hoping it was a scientific array, but quietly suspecting it was a weapon.Late on the second day, a few teams started to examine the secondary hull, which was two thirds the length of Zebra Ones main hull and attached by five thick struts.Unlike the primary, the secondary hull was streamlined and mainly hollow, devoted almost entirely to a series of interconnected chambers.Each one housed different kinds of machinery, including a legion of segmented manipulator arms attached to gargantuan support rings.All of that equipment, alien as it may have been, bore a striking resemblance to construction equipment back on Earth.Unless the expedition missed their mark, the secondary hull was a factory complex.The largest factory ever seen, in fact.The only question remaining was what it was supposed to build.On the morning of the third day aboard Zebra One, Marcus Donovan decided it was finally time to take a look at her heart.Back on the Copernicus Observatory, it was the discovery of a network of veins connected to that organ that convinced him and Rao that the vessel was biological.Now that he was aboard, hed seen the sheaths that contained the thick, fibrous veins, but it was anyones guess what was inside the heart itself.The structure was the size of four skyscrapers bundled together, and it lay at the center of the primary hull.Marcus was sure that it was the main power generator, and he absolutely had to know how it worked.Faulkland volunteered to join him, which surprised no one; the two had become inseparable since they came aboard.Rao also came along, being twice as eager as the others to learn how the aliens generated power.They ate a quick breakfast, looked over the old scans to get a fresh image of their destination in mind, then each of them pictured the heart and was flung through the endless maze of corridors.The entire journey of five kilometers took only a dozen seconds, and undoubtedly imparted them with enough momentum to splash them against a wall like water balloons.Marcus wouldve preferred not to think about that, but just couldnt stop himself.At the other end, the artificial gravity gently lowered him back down to one of the raised octagonal landing pads.Identical pads existed at every corridor entrance.Much like everything else on the ship, no one knew whether they were decorative or served some particular purpose.Faulkland followed a moment later.He floated down beside Marcus, followed by Rao who was shaking with adrenaline and had his eyes closed.Considering the fact that Rao usually had to be sedated before orbital launches, merely closing his eyes was a significant step in the right direction.Marcus had expected the heart to already be lit when he arrived, since it was ostensibly powering every other light on the ship, but no such luck.In fact, it took longer for the room to react to human presence than any other theyd explored.When the walls finally began to glow, in a cool blue rather than the warm amber of elsewhere, they found themselves in a small cul de sac with no obvious opening apart from the one theyd come through.Think shes screwing with us?Faulkland asked as he, like the other two, slowly scanned their surroundings.I dunno.I hope not, Marcus said.The vessel hadnt been anything but accommodating so far.He might even go so far as to call it obedient, but was careful to keep a tight lid on thoughts like that.Just in case.Rao drew the probe from his shoulder and started to take readings.Maybe the generator is dangerous.Radioactive.Do you think she would reroute us away from something potentially lethal?Thats not a bad thought, Marcus said, taking a few cautious steps forward.But then where did she take us?It seems strange having a corridor lead to a dead end like this.Faulkland laughed.Wouldnt be the first strange thing, now would it?I guess not, Marcus said.It didnt add up, though.A dead end wouldnt just be strange.It would be pointless, and he had trouble believing there was a single millimeter of anything pointless aboard.No.I think its an ante chamber.She wants to make sure were serious.Marcus stepped forward and took a good look at the wall in front of him.The room looked unfinished, like someone had just given up and stopped.It was an ante chamber.It just had to be.He closed his eyes and imagined the wall opening, just as hed done with countless others.Nothing.He kept at it, concentrating on all the small details, envisioning them turning to liquid and sliding away.There was a noise like bubbling tar.Success.Marcus opened his eyes, and before him was the strange heart of Zebra One.Come on, he said.He stepped forward onto a platform that hung over a great dark abyss, and his two companions followed a couple steps behind.A moment later, the pale blue light grew and revealed the depths of the huge structure, a cylindrical room extending five hundred meters into the distance, criss crossed and covered with slender catwalks whose surfaces all faced toward the center.Marcus couldnt discern which way was supposed to be down, and he started to suspect there was more than one down in that room.The view was dizzying.The catwalks radiated out from a massive apparatus in the center of the chamber, itself suspended on a great spindle that spanned from one end of the chamber to the other.Marcus had no doubt that the apparatus was the generator, the source of all power on the vessel.Pale blue glowing cable veins in every diameter imaginable were connected to it, and branched throughout the room like overgrown cobwebs.The light of the room and the cable veins alike gently throbbed in the same one two one two pattern that could be heard everywhere inside Zebra One.The generator itself was encased in a bone like framework of iridescent struts that made it difficult to discern the shapes within.All Marcus could tell from the platform was that something inside was glowing brightly and rotating, causing the bone struts to cast shifting shadows across the rest of the room.Should we take a closer look?Faulkland asked.He sounded cautious.Marcus was assumed that if cowboy Faulkland sounded cautious, any normal person should be pants wettingly terrified.The shafts of lights cast out from the generator were bright but not blinding.Would it be hot?Could it be radioactive?Marcus honestly didnt know whether they should continue on.Rao?Im not detecting anything dangerous.Its your call, Marc.He looked left and right, tracing the path of the symmetrical walkways that led in towards the machine.Seems to me that being reckless has gotten us this far.Be a shame to stop now.Thats the spirit, Faulkland said, and gave him a firm slap on the back.A glance to his other side revealed a nervous smile inside of Raos helmet.Since both routes to the generator looked identical, Marcus mentally flipped a coin, motioned to the left, and the three of them began their march.The first stretch of catwalk was perfectly flat and they crossed it quickly, but after about thirty meters it twisted so that its surface was at a perfect right angle.Their first steps onto the twisted section were apprehensive, but they soon realized the walkways surface was always down, no matter how it contorted.Marcus found the process disorienting, like being trapped inside of an Escher painting, and the vertigo forced him to watch the floor under his feet while he walked.At some of the more extreme changes in orientation, he had to fight the impulse to jump from one surface to the next.Rooms like this one would certainly take some getting used to.It took them twenty minutes to reach the innermost cage of walkways, which were oriented so that the generator apparatus was three meters above them.Marcus didnt look up from his feet until they were on top of the generator or below it, or beside it maybe.Prepositions were failing him.When he did finally take a look, he was instantly overcome with awe.Within the bone framework were five devices arrayed in a series, one intact, and four others that had been shattered like light bulbs.The complete device was like nothing Marcus had ever seen before, with a design that interwove flesh and technology into a single hybrid whole.It had two distinct components: a clear outer casing and a strange collection of organs contained within.The casing was a rounded off pentagon ten meters in diameter and six meters deep, made of a glass like transparent material.Each corner held a dense bundle of ducts and unfamiliar machinery, and was connected to the others by a thin metallic band that traced the devices perimeter.That band was covered in geometric shapes which glowed in every hue, and looked as if they might be controls or readouts.The interior was dominated by a muscle like circular organ that was roughly textured, and bore a striking resemblance to the iris of an eye.A hazel eye, rust colored toward the center and shifting to luminous green at the edges.It was suspended in the middle of the casing by five bundles of twisting, woven vines that seemed organic near the iris ring, but grew progressively mechanical as they approached their mount points.The most fantastic part was the small, whirling willow wisp that floated in the hollow of the iris.It was the source of the bright blue light, and was surrounded by glittering particles that turned from white to gold as they raced out, danced and faded like champagne bubbles.Marcus had no idea what it was, but even after a lifetime of staring through telescopes at the wonders of the universe, the willow wisp was easily the most beautiful thing hed ever seen.The device, or perhaps the willow wisp, made a sound like voices singing in chorus, arranged in perfect fifths, wandering slowly up and down an octave.It was as beautiful as the sight, and together they created an overwhelming feeling of tranquility.The three men were completely spellbound.They stood there staring in slack jawed wonder for untold minutes, silent for fear of accidentally disturbing the peace.Marcus broke from his trance and finally spoke.Im going to touch it, he said.He heard his own words, but they sounded like someone else.It sounded like something Faulkland would say.He reached up toward the framework and the ships artificial gravity simultaneously released him into the air.He wasnt sure if that was his own doing or not.He crossed the space ever so slowly, then came to the framework and grabbed on.It quivered under his touch.He climbed from one bone like strut to another until he found an opening large enough to squeeze through, and then he climbed inside.The willow wisp at the center of the device was even more beautiful as he approached.The glittering particles that rushed away from it flocked together like birds, weaving in and between scarcely visible tides of fluid light.Marcus reached out and gently put his hand against the clear casing.As he did so, the willow wisp dimmed and the particles swirled back toward the center of it.It retracted like a flower at night.Whats going on, Doctor?Faulkland asked.I dont know, he said.As the last word left his mouth, the light returned, blinding, bright and fierce, accompanied by a deep roar and throbbing waves of pressure.Marcus felt like he was suddenly standing in front of an industrial spot light, or maybe an oncoming train.Then all hell broke lose.Chapter 15:  Evermore  The generators outburst washed over Marcus and slammed him into the framework.He tried to shield his eyes from the light to no avail, and blinded, he somehow managed to climb through an opening in the cage and emerge on the other side.Marcus didnt know what was happening, but he knew it was his fault.Hed just woken a sleeping bear, and an old fashioned mauling was on its way.It took him several seconds to regain his sight, and he found himself back on the catwalk with Rao and Faulkland.The generators outburst only lasted a moment, after which it settled back down to a level still brighter and more active than when they found it, accompanied by a new, dreadful and furious song.The lights throughout the room were dimming and changing color.They turned blood red.Reports started to stream in from all over the vessel.Anyone else hear that?Like an animal screaming.everything is convulsing  Its all going batshit.Marcus couldnt separate all the voices in his communicator.There were too many people yammering at once.The walls of the room began to writhe.irises appear to be seizing  What the hell is this?All the lights in the chamber went out completely, and then began to strobe.From the reports, they were doing the same all over the ship.Base to Donovan, were seeing a lot of activity out here.The vessel is changing color, and all the sediment has broken free.Rao shook his head, his eyes wide.We oughta get out, Marc.Marcus never had a chance to make the decision; it was made for him.All three men were simultaneously lifted from the catwalk and flung towards the corridor they had come from.They all screamed, and more screams crackled over the comm channel.The ship began to scream as well.Surrounded by the ships screeching, plaintive cry, Marcus accelerated down the blood red tunnel,.He hurtled faster and faster through twisting tubes, and the walls became a blur.He was moving so fast that the tunnel lost its shape, all the detail gone except for the strobing lights and the swiftly approaching darkness.Base to Donovan, come in!Its moving!Donovan?!Marcus was about to die.His remains would be liquified, totally beyond identification.Hed always hoped to face his demise with class, but instead he was frothing at the mouth and screaming like a child.Then he saw the light at the end of the tunnel.Before he could decide what to say to his maker, the light engulfed him and it was over.His arms were crossed in front of his face as if they could possibly stop whatever was coming, and he was twitching like a broken servo.As he lowered his arms, it took him a second to realize he was, in fact, still alive.He was floating a couple meters above a landing platform in a stark white room.There were four other corridors with their own platforms, and in front of each were clusters of his staff in shiny white pressure suits, hanging in place like fruit in gelatin.Base to Expedition?Anyone?Gravity kicked in and everyone dropped to the floor.Were okay, Mason, Marcus said as he dusted himself off.His breathing was ragged and the words came out stilted.He slowly climbed to his feet, and saw the rest doing the same.Were all okay.The room, stark white and glistening like ivory, was one they hadnt explored yet.It was broken into three tiers, each lower than the last and connected by ramps with molded hand rails.The domed ceiling above was circled by a string of pill shaped lights which blazed a bluish white.Marcus and his people were on the highest level, where the five tunnels and their landing platforms were located.Other than the platforms and the dazed crewmen standing on them, all three tiers were empty as a sound stage.Zebra Ones screaming could still be heard, but it was muffled as if this room were somehow insulated from the rest of the ship.Marcus had a strong sense of safety, although it might have just been in contrast with the terrifying journey that brought him there.I think she took us here to protect us, he said.Mason Shens voice came back.Good to hear ya, sir.With all the screaming well, I thought the duty roster was going to be a lot shorter.Zebra Ones still going crazy, so weve pulled the Shackleton back to a safe distance.Define crazy, Rao demanded.The irises are opening and shutting.Tentacle like appendages are thrashing about at the mouth of the secondary hull, and all kinds of colors are playing across the skin.Its pandemonium, sir.What the hell did you do, Marcus?He was absolutely sure Juliette had asked him that exact question before, in that precise tone.Many times before, in fact.I woke her up, he answered.Something below his line of sight caught Marcus attention, and when he looked down, he made a strange discovery.The floor directly beneath him was glowing.It was a disc of bright amber, which pulsed in and out.He glanced around at the rest of the crew, but none of them had a similar disc under their feet.Faulkland looked him up and down.
