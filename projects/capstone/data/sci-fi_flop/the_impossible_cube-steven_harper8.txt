All of them wore copper collars with buttons on them.Among them sat Susan Phipps, flanked by Simon dArco and Glenda Teasdale.Shit, Gavin said, and not even Alice admonished him.Indeed.Phipps still wore the scarlet dress uniform and gold sash, though now she had added a matching hat with gold braid on the brim.Im actually disappointed in you both.You should have known it would be childs play to connect you with the circus and follow you here.The Countess Ivana was pleased to be involved.She has a new experimental subject, and I have you.Youre traitors, Susan, Alice said.All three of you.You dont even see it, do you?Youre traitors to every human alive, and you live in hell.Youre imprisoned in the circle, Glenda pointed out.Her blouse was a deep yellow.Not us.Simon, Gavin said, you were my best friend.Help me, instead of stabbing me in the back!Simon looked at Gavin and swallowed.His fingers clenched and unclenched.Then he looked at Phipps, set his mouth, and straightened his black jacket without saying a word.Gavins heart dropped.What did you monsters do to Feng?Alice demanded.Very important experiment, Ivana called down.She was sitting behind a console similar to the one Gavin had seen on her bird the night before, her hand on one of the levers.You should be proud that he has become part of Gonta heritage.And Zalizniak, put in a man sitting near her.How did you do anything at all?Alice continued in the same demanding voice.She shook her parasol angrily up at them, drawing every eye to her.Gavin slowly slid his rucksack off, his eye on the lever in Ivanas hand.You didnt even have him for a full day.That is Gonta Zalizniak way, said the man who had spoken earlier.He wore a lab coat with red brown stains that Gavin didnt want to think too closely about and a whirligig with spikes on its tiny feet sat on his shoulder near his copper collar.He pointed to himself.Danilo Zalizniak.Our sister was not the only one to work on him.We all worked on him together.Thats what you tell everyone, Alice huffed theatrically.But we know clockworkers dont work together.They all want their own way and eventually tear each other to pieces.Quite literally, in some cases.For a moment, Gavin flashed on the conflicts between himself and Dr.Clef.How long before one of them tried to kill the other?Assuming Gavin survived the next few minutes.Ah, that is for normal clockworkers, Danilo said.We are not like them.We serve the family.And Gavin saw the pattern.Thats what the collection is, he said.You dont think of yourselves as individuals.You dont even call yourself I.  Its always we.Ill bet you werent born with the names Danilo and Ivana, either.Danilo grinned a demons grin.You have good brain.We would like to see it.He and the baroness are mine, Phipps said.You have the Oriental boy.As we agreed.So, so.Ivana removed her hand from the lever and waved it negligently.Perhaps we wish to change the terms of our agreement.What do you mean?Glenda demanded.Simon remained silent.Do you think that you are the only ones who know of this cure your Alice carries?said another woman.Her voice echoed about the chamber.It interests us very, very much.This cure is already destabilizing Europe, and we approve.We predict that within five years, all European clockworkers will be gone because cure will destroy plague.Chinas machinery will continue to grow, and she will easily take all of India and Africa and possibly west coast of America before cure reaches her empire and stops creation of more dragon men.By then it will be too late.China will reign supreme.No, Phipps said flatly.Feng, Alice whispered.Can you stand up?The young man stared blankly, and Gavin couldnt tell if he had understood her or not.Feng, Alice whispered again, you have to stand up.Stand up!Feng instantly got to his feet.The blanket fell away.He was shirtless.Corded muscle moved under ivory skin recently scored with a series of terrible scars that ran across his chest and abdomen.Tiny, neat stitches held the edges together.Gavins nausea returned.Hadnt the spider on his face been enough?What else had they done?Like or not like, Lieutenant, Danilo said.It will happen.We want it to happen.Why would you want that?Simon burst out.His voice was hoarse with stress.It would destroy your family.Already, Alice is spreading the cure through your city.Who will become the next generation of clockworkers?Is nothing, nothing, said an old man who sported a set of steel teeth.We have our own supplies of plague.You are truly stupid man if you think that we Gontas and Zalizniaks could not manipulate plague when it started here, in our own city.You can cure the plague?Alice gasped.She grabbed Gavins hand with her bare one.But Id heard you couldnt.Of course we can, said the old man.It is our secret.And we can infect people with it, and we have ways of increasing chances that victim will become clockworker.Is why we need children.Can you cure clockworkers?Alice blurted before Gavin could ask the same question.Ivana gave her a scornful look.Why would we look into such things?Stupid English.Even if we wanted to destroy our clockworker family, plague changes itself when it makes clockworker and becomes quite incurable.Waste of time.Enough discussion, Phipps said.I will take my prisoners and leave now.Nah, nah, said Ivana.If lovely baroness fails to reach China, Chinese Emperor will rule most of world, and probably hurt Ukraine.This is bad for Gontas and Zalizniaks.Lovely baroness must reach China to spread cure more quickly and destroy Chinese Empire as well.We have agreed.Gavin gasped.The Gontas and Zalizniaks were on their side?But we still think curing China is a bad idea!Danilo Zalizniak protested.We think that baroness must not reach China.Britains weakness will let Ukraine expand west.Ivana touched a button on her collar.Danilo cried out and clutched at his own collar with both hands, his face a rictus of pain.We believe we came to agreement, she said mildly as Danilo rocked in his chair.Is this not so?Speak English for benefit of our guests.No!Danilo howled.No!We  You are wrong!You Gontas are   Ivana touched a button on her collar again, and Danilo screamed.Alice put a hand over her mouth.Gavin stared, both sickened and transfixed.The other clockworkers watched in complete silence, though some of them presumably Zalizniaks looked unhappy or angry.Phipps sat in the center of them all, clearly trying to swallow her outrage.Gavin suppressed a mean smile.For once, she had miscalculated, overplayed her ability to persuade clockworkers.Baroness must reach China, Ivana said.Her tone was quiet and kind.Do we agree, brother?Yes, Danilo whimpered.And we should give her all aid necessary.Is this true?Yes.Another tap on Ivanas collar, and Danilos face instantly relaxed.He slumped down in his chair.Glenda and Simon exchanged startled looks.What did we agree, brother?Ivana asked, her finger still hovering over the copper at her throat.That that the baroness should reach China, Danilo whispered.And we should help her.Just so.Ivana touched a different button on her collar, and Danilo arched his back with a great gasp, but this time the expression on his face read pure pleasure instead of pain.His mouth fell open, and he groaned.Ivana released her collar, and Danilo relaxed.There we are, she said.We may clean ourselves up and change into different trousers, if we desire.We are grateful, sister.Tears streamed down Danilos face.Grateful.He got up and stumbled out of the observation area.We are sorry you had to see that, Ivana called down to Gavin and Alice.This is why experiment with Oriental boy is so important.If it works, we have no more arguments.Well, Gavin said, setting his rucksack on the floor and opening the top, if you want Alice to reach China, I suppose that means we should be on our way.If youll just open that gate  We said baroness must reach China, Ivana agreed.You, on other hand, are quite different.We need advanced clockworkers.You will join Gontas.Or Zalizniaks, said the old man.Gavin had been expecting something like this, but the actual words still chilled him.Alice, meanwhile, had her traveling tools out, the ones rolled up in black velvet embroidered with Love, Aunt Edwina in gold thread.Ivana manipulated her console.A pair of long metal arms extended from the ceiling.They held a copper collar.Another pair of arms reached down with them, intending to grab Gavin and hold him.Dont fight us, the steel toothed clockworker said.It will go easier.Believe us.No!Phipps rose.He belongs to me!Sit!Ivana barked, and grabbed Phippss metal hand.Two other clockworkers grabbed Simon and Glenda before the Third Ward agents could react, and handcuffed them to their chairs.Glenda shrieked in outrage.Simon kicked at his captor, who easily dodged away.The metal hands snatched at Gavin.Gavin!Alice cried.She had a set of lock picks in her hands.Get Feng!Gavin shouted, and the plague slowed time.He dodged the set of grasping arms and snatched the collar from the other set.Angles and trajectories drew themselves in the air for him.He moved his arm a precise two degrees to the left and half a degree down, and threw the collar.The gleaming discus spun through the air and hit the first lever on Ivanas console, the one she had been holding when the gate crashed down and the lights came up.The lever deployed, and gate cranked upward.What are you doing?Ivana howled.She was still holding Phippss arm.How dare you?She reached for the lever, but Gavin raised his wristband.More angles, more trajectories.The magnetic polarizer sent a tiny gear spinning toward her, and it pinged off a button on her collar.Instantly, every clockworker in the gallery, including Ivana, screamed in pain.They clutched at their throats and howled.Phipps, her metal arm still caught in Ivanas grip, jumped and jigged in place as well, though she retained enough self control to send Gavin a look of pure venom.The mechanical arms reaching into the cell went limp.Glenda and Simon struggled against their handcuffs, but to no avail.Hurry!Gavin said to Alice.Before the electricity stops!Alice already had the cold cage unlocked.She yanked it open, but Feng didnt move.Feng!she said.Come on!At her words, Feng left the cage.Gavin snatched the set of ear protectors from his pack, put them on, and dashed out the doorway behind them.The three of them pounded down the long corridor, Gavin clutching the rucksack in front of him.They ran down the steps to the great room, and Gavin headed for the spiral staircase leading up to the main house, but Alice turned, towing Feng with her.What are you doing?he asked, pulling one ear protector aside so he could hear her.Im not leaving these children behind, she said.He sighed.I knew you were going to say that.And I agree with you.Lets go.Alices cure had already spread to all the children, thanks to the close quarters of the cages, and they looked healthier, more alert.She bent over the lock on the first cage, and the whistle hanging around her neck clattered against the bars.The child inside backed away from her.Its the same kind of lock they had on Fengs cage, she said.I can open it almost as fast as with a key by now.Theyll come any minute, Gavin said.Alice didnt respond.In seconds, she had the door open, but the ragged little boy inside refused to come out.Feng, can you tell him were here to take him away?Feng didnt respond.He simply stood near the cage, the spider plastered across half his face.Feng!Alice said.And then Gavin had it.Feng, he said, tell the children in Ukrainian weve come to take them out of here.Tell them weve come to take them home.Feng spoke musical Cyrillic syllables.The boy looked doubtful even as Alice unlocked the second cage.Why does Feng listen to you?she asked.You have to give him a direct order, Gavin said.Its what the Gontas were working on absolute obedience.Alice looked sick.Thats horrible!Well figure it out later, Gavin said.Open the cages before the Gontas recover.The second and third children were more eager to leave their cages, which convinced the first child.Alice had just freed the tenth and final child when a horde of gibbering, angry Gontas appeared at the entrance of the hallway leading back to the operating theater.Ivana was at the forefront.They quickly spotted Gavin, Alice, and Feng.With a shout, they ran down the stairs.They had paused long enough to arm themselves, for they bristled with weapons energy pistols, thunder rifles, vibration knives, quantum swords.They boiled down the steps, bounding with plague enhanced speed, and rushed toward the three escapees and the children, who cowered in fear.Their demonic howls echoed off stone walls, and spittle sprayed from their mouths.Phipps was nowhere to be seen.Perhaps the electric shock affected her more because of her metal parts.Simon and Glenda were no doubt still in handcuffs.Alices lips moved, but Gavin had put the ear protectors back on and he could no longer hear her.Feng looked unfazed, but adrenaline zinged through Gavins arteries.The Gontas and Zalizniaks werent going to capture now.They intended to kill.Praying his plan would work, Gavin let the rucksack fall to the floor, revealing the paradox generator.He pointed the speaking trumpet toward the pack of screeching clockworkers and spun the crank hard.This time, even through the ear protectors, he heard the faint sliding sound of the tritone paradox.It simultaneously climbed and dropped, spinning and swirling.The gaps between the intervals were all tritones, an auditory square root of two that itself stretched out into infinity, but each tritone was paired with a mirror of itself, a parallel.Instead of being painful, the sound became perfection.The sound twisted the universe into new shapes, teased the ear the way a stars gravity teased a comet.Gavin heard only a tiny part of it, and he felt a singular joy.The effect on the clockworkers was electric.They stopped dead in their tracks, dropped their weapons, fell to their knees with the backs of their hands dragging on the floor.Every one of them stared at the generator with an open mouth.Most of them drooled like half dead demons.Get the children, Gavin said, though it was difficult to speak.Well have to take the lift.Alice mouthed something at Feng, who immediately herded the children toward the lift with Alice coming behind.Gavin stayed to keep the paradox generator going.And then Danilo Gonta appeared at the top of the steps in his bloodstained white coat.He was wearing ear protectors.Gavin tensed.Shit, he muttered.He hadnt noticed Danilo wasnt among the crowd of Gontas he held captive with the generator, or remembered that Danilo hadnt returned after Ivana had sent him from the operating theater.Both of Gavins hands were occupied with the generator, and Alice and Feng were already halfway to the lift with the children.Danilo bounded down the stairs and stopped just a few steps away from Gavin.He didnt have a weapon, but that didnt mean he was unarmed.Gavin took an uncertain step backward, still cranking the generator.The faint but perfect beauty of the tritone paradox was a constant distraction.The clockworker reached into his pocket.Gavin tensed again, and Danilo pulled out a metal stylus with a glass bulb on the end.A wire ran from the other end of the stylus and disappeared up Danilos sleeve.He moved the stylus across the air, and it left a trail of light.Gavin stared in fascination, and he almost forgot to crank the generator.We can hear this sound a little, Danilo wrote in glowing letters.It creates unity!It is perfection!Name price.Gavin shook his head.Alice and the others were almost to the lift now.Danilo waved the stylus and the words vanished.He started over.We will let you and children go.We will send you on special train to China.We will stop Phipps.Where was Phipps, anyway?Gavin had a hard time believing she had been incapacitated for long.No, Gavin said, his voice muffled in his own ears.Youll use it to control each other and other clockworkers and God only knows what else.Danilos face hardened in clockworker anger.Then we destroy you and your circus and take friends for test subjects.Feng opened the gate to the lift and Alice herded the children aboard.She gestured at Gavin to come.He thought about an army of Cossack clockworkers and their weapons tearing through the Kalakos Circus, of Dodd and Nathan and Linda and Charlie and all the others being carted down here, infected with the clockwork plague or strapped to a table and cut open like Feng.Was that worth an invention he had intended to destroy in the first place?His hand slowed on the crank.You have to promise to let everyone go, Gavin said.Done, Danilo wrote over the heads of his drooling family.And to arrange for that special train.Danilo underlined the word done.His lips also moved as he muttered to himself, and Gavin, used to reading lips on windy airships that often swept sound away, saw him add Ivana and other words he assumed were Ukrainian.The clockwork plague helped him make lightning connections in Gavins mind.Realizations snapped and clicked together, and Gavins blood went cold.Danilo was lying.He had no intention of letting anyone go.He they wanted to use the generator as a weapon against the Gonta clockworkers, and Danilo Zalizniak would do or say anything to get his hands on it.The Cossacks, who had already broken a compact with Phipps, would have no compunctions about breaking one with Gavin.He sped up the crank.No!he shouted.Ill see you in hell first.Danilo leaped at him with a snarl, smearing golden letters.But Gavins combat training with the Third Ward took over.He jumped straight up and caught Danilo in the chest with a snap kick that barely interrupted the generators lovely drone.Danilo fell back and slammed into Ivana, who toppled over without caring.One side of Danilos ear protectors came off, exposing him to the tritone paradox, and a look of ecstasy descended on his face.He sprawled across Ivanas plump body, already drooling.Your second orgasm of the day, Gavin said, and kicked him in the crotch.Thats for Feng and the children, you son of a bitch.The thud as his boot connected felt good.For a moment, Danilos face vanished, and it was replaced by Madoc Blue, the pirate who had cornered Gavin on the Juniper and tried to take his trousers down.He was the first mate who had sliced the flesh on Gavins back with a whip.Gavin hadnt had a normal nights sleep since.Nightmares made the dark restless, and every morning, Gavin jerked awake, his heart pounding.This terrible man drooling on the floor before him was the symbol of everything that was wrong in this world, everything that had gone wrong in Gavins life.And he was helpless.It occurred to Gavin with terrible certainty that he could end the entire problem here and now.It would be childs play to kill every Gonta in the room, even with the generator occupying his hands.He could knock the Gontas over, one by one, and stand on their disgusting throats until they suffocated, or break each of their loathsome necks with well placed kicks.And all the while they would thank him for the lovely, deadly music.He and Alice and Feng and the children could walk out of the house, free and clear.How sweet that would be.He planted himself, aimed the first kick that would snap a Cossack neck.And then a touch on his shoulder brought him around.Alice was there.Come on!she mouthed.Hurry!Gavin hesitated.Alice.Beautiful, practical Alice.She was standing beside him, in the same place, in the same danger, and yet it never even occurred to her to execute the Gontas.She plucked at his sleeve.Why the wait?she mouthed.Come!How would she react if he killed a group of helpless people, no matter how filthy and foul?And how would he react later?Only a few days ago, the thought of killing a man with his energy whip had filled him with fear and disgust.Now he was calmly considering destroying a roomful of people.What was he becoming?What was this city turning him into?His skin crawled even as his hand continued to turn the generator.He wouldnt let himself become their sort of demon.Lets go, he said.Still playing, he turned his back on the Gontas and let Alice lead him to the lift.Chapter Twelve  The lift gate clanged shut and Gavin stopped cranking the strange machine in his hands.Instantly the eerie, nail biting noise ended, and Alice breathed a sigh of relief.Gavin popped the protectors off his ears and hung them around his neck.Theyll stay in that stupor for a few minutes longer, he said.We need to hurry.The lift was crowded with the ten children, Gavin, Alice, and Feng.Feng, with the dreadful spider sprawled across half his face like a brass scar.It made Alice sick with guilt to see it and the scars that puckered his chest and torso.She felt bad enough after seeing Feng, and the thought of leaving the children behind in those cages well, that was quite impossible, no matter what the risk to her own safety might be.Alice spun the crank on the lift control and moved the lever, unable to read the Cyrillic characters but hoping UP and DOWN would be in the same places as an English lift.The lift jerked upward, making the children gasp in fear.They shied away from Feng and clustered around Alice likes chicks around a hen.Two of them clutched her hands, despite the iron spider on her left.This was, strangely, her first prolonged contact with children, and she couldnt decide whether the odd circumstances of the occasion should make her laugh at the ridiculousness of it or howl with outrage at the injustice.Are you all right, Gavin?she asked instead as the lift continued to rise.Im fine.He held up the generator.Danilo Zalizniak offered the earth for this.What in heavens name for?So the Zalizniaks could get the upper hand on the Gontas and Im guessing expand their empire.Good heavens, Alice said.I hadnt thought of that.The moment we get the children to safety, we must destroy that thing.She paused, still holding the slightly sweaty hands of the two children.Gavin was grinning at her, and the wide, handsome smile was still enough to make her breath stop, especially when it was aimed at her.What is it?Feng is in terrible trouble, we could be chopped into pieces at any moment, and the second we leave this lift, were going to be fighting our way through god knows what, but youre thinking about the children.He continued to smile.You saved me back there, you know.She blinked.Did I?I thought you were saving me.Not at all, he said seriously.You led me into hell, Alice, and now I know youre going to lead me back out.The lift slammed to a halt, and for a horrible moment Alice thought the Cossacks had stopped them, but through the gate she could see the main floor of the great house.Feng, she said, open the lift.Feng leaped forward like a puppet on strings and slammed the iron gate aside with the sound of a death bell.Alice felt sick again at the way his scarred body obeyed, but made herself focus.Right now, they had to get out of the Gonta Zalizniak house intact, and if success required her to bark orders at Feng, she would do it.Kemp was waiting for them in the marble foyer.The surreal sight of his familiar head on a different body gave Alice a turn, even though shed been prepared for it.I see Madam and Sir were successful in their attempt, he said.Excellent work, if I may be so bold.Thank you, Kemp, Alice said.She herded the children out of the lift.They were gaining confidence in her now, seemed to understand that she was there to help, and they were more willing to follow her.They were fearful, innocent, and trusting, children who had lived through things no child should dream of, let alone experience.She felt a deep need to ensure their safety and was quite sure she would die to protect them.For a moment, she wondered if this was what it was like to have children of her own, though she didnt think that she would want to start off or even finish with ten of them.She did a quick head count and led everyone toward the front door, her parasol at the ready.Feng and Kemp took up the rear, with Gavin among the children.He looked like a rather distracted young father on an outing, and Alice pushed the thought away to examine later.The house seemed to be in confusion.Human servants rushed about or stood uncertainly in corners.A smell of burned food hung in the air.Alice put on the air of a lady and strode confidently, ignoring everyone around her.No one would dare challenge her; it would never occur to her that someone might.Keep moving, keep moving.Check the children, ensure none had wandered away.Push past the handwringing housekeeper who babbled at her in Ukrainian.Thread through the maze of rooms.Nearly at the exit.Keep moving, keep moving.She found herself in the middle of an enormous two storied room with red marble floors and pillars.A grand staircase swept up to a balcony that ran around the entire chamber.High arched windows provided light, and ten foot high double doors stood opposite her.A patch of floor in front of the doors gleamed like a diamond.Alice glanced around, halted in confusion.It was the wrong room.She had taken a bad turn somewhere.This is the entry foyer, Kemp said helpfully.The front doors are straight ahead of Madam.Alice hesitated and fingered the whistle on its chain around her neck.I think we should find a side door.I dont want to walk out onto the front steps and into the middle of that party.Ivana Gonta sent everyone home some time after Madam and Sir took the lift down, Kemp sniffed.According to the servants, she was quite rude about it, even by Cossack standards.It is why everyone is in such a panic.The circus left, except for the elephant, which wont obey orders from anyone.Perhaps it has broken down.So the entire banquet existed only to lure us here, Alice said.Who cares?Gavin said.We have a clear sky.Lets go!A door up on the balcony slammed open and a stream of mechanical guards, all dressed in red uniforms, stormed down the stairs.Faster than any human, they lined up in ranks in front of the main doors.The other doors in the great room crashed shut and locks clicked.The children clustered around Gavin and Alice, whimpering in fear.Alice spread her arms to embrace and reassure as many of them as she could, though her own heart was racing.Madam!Kemp cried.Madam!His body marched over to join the automatic army, his arms and legs stiff, his head turning left and right.Alice started to go after him, but Gavin took her shoulder.Wait, he cautioned.We dont know what were dealing with yet.Good advice, said all the automatons at the same time, in the same voice.Even Kemp.The absolute unity of the sound made Alices skin crawl.We are masters here.You will not leave.Madam!Kemp added.Who is this?Alice demanded as she turned the handle of her parasol.We are Gonta Zalizniak, said the automatons.All of them, including Kemp, drew swords.You couldnt get out of the basement in time to stop us, so you took over your guards.Is one of you controlling all of them, Alice asked, not really caring but trying to stall so she could think, or do each of you control one automaton?You will not leave.The swords vibrated with a sound like a pack of snarling dogs.Madam!I am trying to change the memory wheels, but I cannot.Help me, Madam!Where are Phipps and Glenda and Simon?Alice asked.The automatons and Kemp took a step forward in unison.You will not leave.Stop us.Gavin shoved the ear protectors back over his ears and cranked the generator again.The eerie sound rippled through the red marble room.All the automatons and Kemp jerked their heads in unison, then laughed together.Gavin stopped playing in confusion.Siren song is very beautiful, the automatons said, but not so enticing when we hear through metallic ears.Alice will exit and go to China.Gavin and pretty Oriental boy will come back downstairs with children.But first we will slice one or two open while you watch.What?Alice cried.Why?To punish you and Gavin, little baroness.To show that you are not in charge here.If you behave well after that, we promise to use nitrous oxide on Gavin and children before more experiments, though little baroness will have to take our word on that.Feng was trembling and his torso was sheathed in sweat, though his spidery face stayed impassive and he remained where he was at the back of the group of children.Alice glanced at Kemp, then back at the children.Damn it.She twisted her parasol handle again, and the high pitched whine shrilled.Her hands shook.Madam, what are you doing?Kemp asked.Madam, please dont!Im sorry, Kemp, she said.Im so sorry.And she fired a bolt of electricity.The children cried out and scrambled backward.The crackling bolt struck the center automaton square on and spread to the others, including Kemp.Alice bit her lip, but held her grip firm.All the hair on the back of her neck stood up, and the smell of ozone tanged the air.The automatons stood still for a moment.Then they laughed again, even Kemp.One of the automatons extended a hand.Its forearm separated from its upper arm and shot across the room, still connected to the body by a stiff cable.The move caught Alice off guard, and the automatons hand was able to snatch the parasol from her hand and haul it back.It snapped the weapon in two and flung it aside.No, no, no.We know about electric umbrella.We saw it work.Theyre standing on glass flooring, Gavin said.They arent grounded.Good heavens, Alice whispered, staring at the gleaming patch of floor.Kemp remained silent.You have no weapons now, the automatons said.You belong to us.The little clockwork army, including Kemp, spread out into a semicircle and stormed forward, their terrible growling swords at the ready.Before Alice could react, a bolt of red energy slashed through the air and punched through the chest of one of the automatons.It keeled over backward.Its sword went still.Alice spun.On the balcony behind and above them all stood Susan Phipps in her scarlet uniform with a large rifle in her hands and a battery pack on her back.Her brass monocle stared coldly down into the stone foyer.Beside her, also armed, were Simon dArco in black and Glenda Teasdale in yellow.Sorry it took so long to get here, Phipps said.We had to raid the Gonta armory first.Oh God, Gavin muttered.Fire!Phipps ordered.Glenda and Simon obeyed.The air crackled with energies Alice couldnt name.Gavin dropped the paradox generator, and they pushed the children to the floor while terrible thunder boomed overhead.The smell of hot metal filled Alices nose.It went on and on.Several of the children began to cry.Heat pressed on Alices back.And then it stopped.Alice raised her head and slowly got to her feet.Smoke choked the air and it took some time to make out the warped figures of the automatons scattered about the floor, arms and legs skewed at odd angles, bodies and heads half melted.The marble floor was pitted and scorched, and the glass plate in front of the door had shattered into a thousand pieces.The children coughed and continued to cry.The sound wrenched Alices heart, but she forced herself to concentrate on the matter at hand.Madam, said Kemps voice from among the wreckage.Madam.Madam.Madam.Alice gasped upon hearing this, heartened at this small bit of mechanical life among the strange carnage.Beside her, Gavin got to his feet.Feng remained upright.No one had told him to duck.Madam.Madam.Madam.Phipps came down the stairs, followed by Glenda and Simon.The brass barrel of the energy rifle glowed a soft red.That was satisfying, she said.I imagine the Cossacks themselves will come upstairs eventually, but we should have time.And my shackles are rather more effective than the ones those disgusting clockworkers used.Glenda put a hand to her ear, which had a metal cup over it.I have access to the memory engines that run the house, Lieutenant.The Gontas have abandoned the automaton controls and are coming now.The smoke caught in Alices throat, and she had to cough before she could speak.Susan Lieutenant I cant go back with you.Im not offering a choice.In that moment, all the frustration and anger and fear shed been keeping under control got away from her.Why are you doing this?she burst out.What do you have to gain?The plague in England is dead.There are no more clockworkers.The Third Wards purpose is no more!Phipps strode forward and grabbed Alice by the front of her blouse in a metal fist.Her breath smelled of stale bread and long forgotten wine.Alice grabbed Phippss wrist with her own metal gauntlet, but Phipps was stronger by far.You endanger the world.You diminish me.You destroyed my reason to exist.Let her go, Phipps!Gavin barked, but Simon pointed his rifle at him, and he went still.The paradox generator sat uselessly at his feet like a half dead flower.So now youve replaced your purpose with an obsession to destroy me?Alice countered.Is it worth the cost?Youve dragged Simon and Glenda into hell, and these children are paying the price as well.Let us go to China, Susan, and well restore balance to the world.It wont be the balance you remember, but itll be balance nonetheless.Madam.Madam.Madam.Phippss six fingered hand tightened on the white cloth at Alices throat, and Alice found it a bit hard to breathe.Balance is restored only through justice.I will have justice.The Gontas will be here in two minutes, Lieutenant, said Glenda from behind her rifle.Susan, Gavin said evenly, we shouldnt be talking about this here.These children need our help, our assistance, our aid.Isnt that also your duty, your responsibility, your obligation?A fine try, Ennock, Phipps said.But Im not a clockworker.Listen to me, Lieutenant.The words came out half choked, and Alice could barely draw breath through the iron grip at her throat.She fumbled for the whistle on its chain, but couldnt get to it.You have a chance here to build instead of destroy.You can save these children and thousands like them.Just let us go.Phipps stared at Alice, her ice blue eyes meeting Alices brown ones.She wavered.The grip at Alices throat relaxed and she could breathe freely again.Relief made Alice relax.Everything was going to be fine.The children continued to huddle around Gavin, and she wanted to tell them it would be all right now, but she had no way to   No!Phipps snarled.Her grip tightened again.No!No!No!I will have justice!Glenda, chain them both.Simon, keep them covered.If they move wrong, shoot to kill.Alice first.Thatll keep Gavin in line.Madam.Madam.Madam.We have barely sixty seconds, Glenda reported, setting her rifle aside and producing a set of heavy handcuffs.Feng!Alice cried in desperation.Attack Phipps!Feng instantly launched himself at Phipps.The move caught Phipps off guard and he slammed into her, knocking her down.Alice went down, too, but Phipps released her grip and she was able to roll free.Gavins wristbands snapped a cog at Glenda, who ducked by reflex.Gavin shoved through the crying group of children and swept the rifle from Glendas hands with a hook kick.It hit the floor and slid away.Simon spun and aimed his weapon straight at Gavin.The tip glowed red.Feng and Phipps rolled across the floor, trading and blocking blows faster than Alice could track.No!Phipps chanted.No!No!No!No!Feng was getting tired, and Phipps landed several choice hits on him.Alice struggled to her feet, fumbling for the whistle.Gavin faced Simon across the glowing rifle barrel.Simons eyes were sunken, his hair disheveled, his black coat torn.Are you going to shoot me, Simon?Gavin said.Simon Peter dArco, the man who killed his friend and partner?I have my orders, he said hoarsely.What orders come from your soul?Gavin asked.You once gave up happiness to give me Alice.I cant imagine that someone so unselfish would kill for shallow reasons.You never wanted me, Simon said.So I found someone else, and Phipps ripped me away from him to follow you.It always comes back to you, Gavin.You!Im sorry, Gavin admitted.I know youre angry.But is anger worth my life, or the lives of these children?Madam.Madam.Madam.Glenda was moving toward her lost rifle.Simon twisted a lever, and the red barrel glowed scarlet.Alice froze, the whistle at her mouth, as Simon fired.The energy beam shot past Gavin and hit Glendas rifle.It leaped away, a molten mass.Glenda swore and jumped back.You traitorous bastard!Phipps leaped to her feet, dark hair wild.Feng staggered upright, still trying to attack but not possessing the coordination.Ill see you court martialed, dArco!The door at the top of the balcony burst open, and clockworker Cossacks boiled into the room.Ivana was at the forefront.She waved a sword that would have looked ridiculous with her pink tea gown if the vibrating blade hadnt sheared a marble bust in half as she passed.The other Gontas bore similar weapons, including a number of projectile arms.Shit, said Simon and Gavin together.Alice blew the whistle.It shrilled high and loud, like a baby chick crying for its mother.There was a small moment of silence when everyone in the giant room paused, as if startled that Alice would do something so ridiculous.Alice stood in the middle of the frozen chaos.The children huddled together, frightened and without a protector.Feng staggered about, still trying to obey orders and attack Phipps, but betrayed by his battered body.Kemps head droned sorrowfully to itself.Gavin and Simon remained side by side, dark and light, newly become brothers.Even the Gontas and Zalizniaks paused momentarily in their charge.And then an angry trumpeting answered the whistle.A faint rumble grew stronger, and the front doors smashed open.They wrenched off their hinges, and Alice ducked as one door flew over her head and crashed at the foot the stairs just as Ivana and two of her siblings arrived there.Ivanas dying scream was buried under six inches of solid oak.The mechanical elephant stampeded over the remains of the automaton army, trumpeted again, and came to a halt near Alice.It made a formidable wall of brass between her and Phipps.Get aboard!Alice barked.Feng, get the children on the elephant!But Gavin and Simon were now halfway across the room from Alice and the mechanical animal.Gavin snatched up the paradox generator and the two of them ran for the elephant, but one of the Gontas on the staircase lobbed a small device that landed in the space between Gavin and the elephant.It exploded with a strange pop that only rocked Alice but knocked both Gavin and Simon sprawling.Gavin slid backward across the smooth floor, away from the elephant and toward the staircase.Alice shouted his name.Gavin managed to regain his feet.By a miracle, he hadnt lost his hold on the paradox generator.Simon, meanwhile, flew in a different direction entirely and fetched up against one of the walls.He pulled himself upright, rifle in hand.The Cossacks laughed and tried to clamber over the wreckage at the foot of the stairs.One of them gave it up and turned to aim a large, multibarreled rifle in the elephants general direction.Go, Alice!Gavin shouted.Take the kids and go!No!Alice cried, horrified at the idea.I cant leave you!But the space between them was wide, and the Gontas were already aiming a number of other weapons.The air would turn deadly in seconds.The children were climbing up the elephant and into the brass gondola, using handholds welded onto its hide for just this purpose.Feng urged them along, but they were slow, and there was no way to get them all in before the Gontas started their barrage.Gavin held up the paradox generator and grabbed the crank.Of course!The Cossacks couldnt resist it.All he had to do was freeze them in place long enough for   Alices eye fell upon Gavins ear protectors lying on the floor some distance away.The bomb had flung them from their place around his neck.Her stomach clenched with terror.In that moment, she knew what he intended to do.Gavin, dont!she screamed.You cant!I love you always, he mouthed and gave her that heart stopping grin.Then he turned the crank.The unearthly sound of the tritone paradox sighed through the room.Most of the Gontas and Zalizniaks, those who hadnt been crushed by the door, froze.A look of pure bliss descended on their faces.Their weapons thudded to the stairs.Gavin mirrored their expression.His handsome features passed into an ecstasy only he could understand as he mindlessly cranked the handle, transporting himself and his fellow clockworkers into rapture.Alice hated the filthy sound, and tears streamed down her face.She couldnt reach him, he couldnt reach her, and he would play until he dropped from exhaustion or a Cossack killed him.And just as Alice feared, three Gontas had had the foresight to throw together ear protectors of their own, and they shoved past their entranced brethren.Two aimed rifles straight at Gavin.No, you dont!Simon fired his own weapon.Red energy spat from the tip and shattered part of the stone banister.The Gontas ducked.Alice cried out.Gavins bought us time!Simon shouted at her, still firing.Dont waste it!Glenda, stay where you are.Alice, get those children aboard!At that moment, Phipps dashed around the elephant.She had taken advantage of the confusion to retrieve her rifle, and she aimed it at Alice, but Alice made an infuriated gesture, and the elephant swung its trunk round and slapped Phipps aside like a fly.Phipps went tail over teakettle and landed hard.The rifle arced away, far out of reach.Leave, Susan!Alice shouted above the noise of the rifle fire and the paradox generator.I dont have time for your pettiness.If you want justice later, run now.Simon continued to fire.His expert marksmanship kept the three Cossack clockworkers pinned down, but Alice wondered how long the rifles energy would last.The moment Simon stopped his attack, the Cossacks would turn their fire on Gavin, and Alice had no way to save him.Gavin played his perfect tritones, forever beyond her reach.In moments, he would be dead.Alice felt sick and helpless as the final two children climbed aboard the elephant.Come on, Lieutenant!Glenda cried near the gaping front doors.Phipps looked torn for a moment.Then she dashed outside.Glenda went after her.Simon fired another volley at the Gontas, but the rifles power was already weaker.Go!he shouted.Were out of time!Alice gestured, and the elephant curled its trunk so Alice could step aboard it.I wont leave without Gavin!Madam.Madam.Madam.Theres no choice!Simon said.You have to let him go.Ice washed through Alices veins at those words.I I  Let him go!At that moment, Simons rifle ran out of power.The room fell silent except for the ghostly sighs of the tritone paradox.The protected Cossacks, who were hiding behind the stone banister, raised their heads above the rail.Their own rifles came up.Something inside Alice snapped.The world went into a blur, and she was only half aware of what she was doing.A scream tore itself from her throat, and the elephant thundered forward with Feng and the children clinging to the gondola on its back.And then the mechanical beast was standing between Gavin and the Gontas.Rifle fire, some of it energy, some of it projectile, pinged and hissed off the elephants brass hide.Alice leaped down, yanked the generator out of Gavins hands, and slapped him sharply across the face.Weapons fire continued to pock and snarl on the other side of the elephant.Wha ?Gavin said.Move!she shouted.He moved.In seconds, he was in the gondola.Alice hurled herself back onto the elephants trunk and ordered the beast to turn and run.It obeyed with a lurch as the Cossacks continued to fire, though the elephant still provided protection as it picked up speed.The smell of scorched brass filled the room and a chunk of metal peeled off the mechanicals side, exposing mesh and gears like muscle and bone.Machinery squealed as if it were in actual pain.The other Cossacks remained in their trance, but that wouldnt last long.Above Alice, children cried and screamed.The elephant was limping badly, and Alice could hear the pistons labor.More than one was bent or misaligned, though it was still able to speed along faster than a man could run.Alice clung grimly to its trunk, praying it wouldnt break down.Simon ran lightly along the wall, heading for the door as well, but the Cossacks were concentrating their fire on the elephant instead of him.He arrived at the door and bent down to scoop up Kemps head just as the elephant reached him.With a quick move, he tossed the head up to Gavin in the gondola, then grabbed a handhold as the elephant thundered past and swung himself up.Madam.Madam.Madam.The elephant bolted onto the portico outside and down the front steps to the deserted courtyard.The banquet tables, still bearing the remains of the feast, stood between the elephant and the gate, which by a miracle stood open, no doubt from when the rest of the circus left.The elephant smashed the tables to flinders and charged into the street.The rifle fire died away.A number of emotions tried to push their way into Alices head and heart fear, relief, pride, anger but she forced herself to stay focused on the task at hand.Reach safe distance from the Gontas.Guide the elephant safely through the street.Bring the children back to the circus.Would the Gontas pursue?Alice had no idea.Right now, she had to get back to the circus, where there was help.Alice!Gavin called from above.Alice!His voice brought back the wave of sentiment.She ignored it, and him.Now that he was safe, she needed to deal with practical matters.Once they were back at the circus, they could talk.The elephant ran.Madam.Madam.Madam.Alice!Gavin shouted again.The journey was its own version of hell.Alice was terrified the Gontas were following, and she didnt dare slow down, but neither did she want to trample anyone, and the dirty, narrow streets were difficult to navigate.Thank God she knew where she was going.People and traffic leaped out of the elephants way, some meekly, others with angry shouts.The elephants feet thudded unevenly on the cobblestones.Alice turned it one way, then another, always heading for the Dnepro River and the circus.The circus became a goal unto itself, a haven she had to reach at all costs.The elephant slowed, lurching more and more.A loud hissing started in one of the little boilers inside its chest.But Alice could see the Tilt between the buildings.Madam.Madam.Madam.And then they were there.The circus was in something of a mess.People dashed in a number of directions, working and shouting and unhitching horses from wagons.Animals bellowed and screeched in their cages.And then Alice remembered that they had been rudely dismissed from the Gonta Zalizniak house and must have only just returned.Alice!Gavin called again.God, Alice.Get up here!This time Alice listened.She quickly climbed up to the gondola, cursing the difficulty of doing so in a skirt.Simon helped her in.Feng stood in one corner of the gondola, his scarred face impassive, Kemps head at his feet.Nine of the children lay or sat on the floor, some of them crying softly, most of them numb.Gavin knelt, cradling the tenth, the little girl in the ragged gray dress.It was the girl Alice had first cured.Gavins jaw was trembling, and then Alice saw that the front of the girls dress was stained with blood.All the strength went out of her and she dropped to the floor of the gondola beside the child.No, she whispered.No, no, no.Is she ?Dead, Simon said.Rifle fire hit her when you went back.Guilt and horror crushed Alice to the gondola floor.Tears welled in her eyes and her throat closed.She took the little body from Simon and cradled it.The little girls body lay in her arms like a warm rag doll.Her mouth lolled open.Alice wept.This child would never see her parents or play house or bite a slice of bread or kiss a boy or breathe spring air.All her hopes and memories had vanished like fog in sunlight, as if they had never existed.A month ago, when she had eaten breakfast with her family, shed had no idea that one day her corpse would lay in the arms of a stranger on the back of a mechanical monster.And it was Alices doing.Alice wished desperately that she could change places with her, but God was never so kind.Gavin touched her shoulder and Alice wanted to bury herself in his arms, but she wouldnt let herself.What solace did this girl have?Her family?You couldnt let go, Simon said in a flat voice.She died because you went back for Gavin.Madam.
