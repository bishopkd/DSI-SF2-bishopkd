  JEST 89,000 VOLTS  "Come on, Jerry," Chuck called out cheerfully from inside the rude shed that the two chums had fixed up as a simple laboratory."The old particle accelerator is fired up and rarin' to go!""I'm fired up and rarin' to go too," Jerry whispered into the delicate rose ear of lovely Sally Goodfellow, his lips smacking their way along her jaw towards her lips, his insidious hands stealthily encircling her waist."Silly!"Sally giggled and wriggled free of his powerful, yet tender embrace with a solid blow of the heel of her hand against his chin."You know that I like Chuck just as much as I like you. "Then, with a saucy toss of her shoulder length locks she was gone, and Jerry looked after her longingly, fingering his bruised jaw."Come on, Jerry, the accumulators are crackling with barely restrained power," Chuck shouted."Here I come. "Jerry entered the shed and closed and locked the door carefully behind him, for there were discoveries and yet unpatented inventions here that would set the largest corporations in the land to licking their lips.It just so happened that these two young men, still students at a secluded State College in drowsy Pleasantville, had two of the keenest minds in the country, perhaps the entire world.Tall, dark haired, broad shouldered Jerry Courteney, handsome as a Greek god with a whimsical smile forever playing about his lips, would never be taken for the topnotch engineer that he was, the man who walked off with every medal and every award in every field that he chose to study.He looked less like a scholar than the rugged frontiersman he really was, for he had been born up on the far northern border of our country, on a homesteaded ranch in Alaska north of the Arctic Circle.In that rough environment he had grown up with his four strapping brothers and strapping father, who strapped them all quite well when they got out of line, as high spirited boys ever will.The others were all still there, hewing a precarious living from the virgin wilderness, but much as he loved the icy silences and whispering trees, Jerry had been bitten by the bug of knowledge, just as his arms were bitten by the ravenous mosquitoes so his skin was tougher than shoe leather, and had made his way from school to school, scholarship to scholarship until he reached State College.Chuck van Chider, no less of a genius, had had a far easier time of it.A blond giant of man with arms as thick as a strong man's legs, he was the heart and spirit of the State Stegasauri, the championship football team, the man who could open a hole in any line, who could carry the ball through any number of grappling foe.When he remembered to.Twice during the last season he had stopped stock still with the game surging around him as a solution to a complicated mathematical problem suddenly presented itself to him.He went on to win these games, so his teammates never minded the blank moments, and he was also the heir to the van Chider millions which also did not make him any enemies.Born with a platinum spoon in his mouth, his father had prospected a platinum mine on the very spot where the Pleasantville Mental Hospital now stood; he had never known want.Before the mine had played out, the shrewd Chester van Chider had sold out and used the money to buy the tiny cheese works outside of town.By the addition of inert ingredients and deliquescing agents to the sturdy cheese he had built a world wide market for Van Chider Cheddar  and a fortune for himself.Though discontented radicals from the lunatic fringe often said his cheese tasted like rancid sealing wax, the public at large loved it, mostly for its deliquescing agents which absorbed water from the atmosphere so that after a few days, if you didn't eat fast enough, you had more cheese than you started with.Chester van Chider was a shrewd businessman, unlike the greedy operators who bought his platinum mine only to have it play out a few weeks later, this blow being so great that most of them ended up in the aforementioned looney bin built on the minesite.The keen business mind of the father was reflected in the mathematical genius of the son.In some ways as different as night and day, blond and dark haired, wiry and stocky, the two friends were very much alike inside.They had strong hearts and rugged digestions  and minds that were as keen as any that could be found.All around them, in the cluttered laboratory that had once been a simple shed, lay the fruits of their mutual genius.A tossed aside bit of breadboard circuitry that would one day revolutionize long line transmission of electricity, a bit of scribbled paper that elaborated a simple equation for squaring the circle.These were the playthings of their ever curious minds  and their latest plaything now filled the room and hummed with life.A massive, hulking, 89,000 volt particle accelerator that they had put together from surplus electromagnets and a rusty water boiler.High density batteries of their own invention brimmed full of electricity, and all that was required now was to throw the great gang switch to send the charged particles smashing into the target."Put the rubidium on the target area, will you?"Chuck called out, busily at work adjusting a meter, his thick, strong fingers as delicate as those of a master watchmaker at the precise job."Right on," Jerry answered and reached for the sample of the rare metal they were bombarding  but seized instead a piece of Van Chider Cheddar from the large wheel they always kept nearby.It was a moment of youthful madness, a harmless jest brought on perhaps by the still warm memory of those precious lips against which his had so recently rested.Filled with the joy of life, he prized the damp piece of cheese free and slapped it onto the chamber and sealed and evacuated it."Stand clear," Chuck shouted."There she blows!"With a mighty crackling the batteries discharged completely, and the sharp smell of ozone filled the air.Visible only as a sudden fine beam of purple Ught, the particles struck the target and vanished."Experiment eighty three," Chuck said, licking a pencil and making a note on the chart.The clamps pulled free and the cover came away and he looked in at the target and his eyes bulged and the pencil fell from his limp fingers."I'll be double gosh darned!"he whispered.Jerry could contain himself no longer but burst out laughing at his friend's astonishment "Just a joke," he gasped through the laughter."I put some cheese in place of the rubidium. ""This is cheese?"Chuck asked, and withdrew a spherical black lump from the target area.This time it was Jerry's turn to gape and gasp, and Chuck enjoyed a good chuckle at his friend's discomfiture.But the fun once over, they turned their attention to the sudden mystery."It was cheese before it was bombarded," Jerry said, suddenly serious, looking at the shiny black pellet through a strong lens."There are a number of unusual chemicals in my father's cheese.Somehow they united under the bombardment to form this new compound, once the large quantities of hydrogen and oxygen had been freed from the water.What can it be?""We can find out easily enough  but I have just had an idea.Take a vacuum tube.... ""Of course, I had the same obvious idea.Put this new substance in place of the cathode and hook it up and see what kind of signal it produces. ""Exactly my idea. "Jerry smiled."But we need a name for this substance. ""I think cheddite fills the bill. ""Bang on!"They cracked the glass casing of a hulking PF167 power tube and put the mysterious fragment of cheddite in place of the cathode, Jerry deftly wiring it into the circuit while Chuck took a glass rod and quickly blew a new envelope for the tube.A few moments more sufficed to wire the tube into a breadboarded amplifier circuit and to switch the power on."Give it some more juice," Jerry said, frowning at the meters hooked up to the output of the circuit."She's taking all we have now," Chuck answered, spinning the great theostat to its final stop."Well, then there's something mighty fishy here.Look.The current is pouring into the circuit  but it is not coming out!Not a needle has flickered from the stops.Where is all that energy going?"Chuck scratched his wide jaw in puzzlement."It's not coming out as volts or ohms or watts, that is for sure.So it must be radiant energy of a different kind.Let's hook up a hunk of aerial to that output and see what kind of signal it is putting out. "A handy metal coat hanger served that function well and was wired into the circuit while test instruments were set up around it."I'll give it just a millivolt first," Jerry said as he threw the switch.What happened next was as soundless as it was shocking.The moment the current went into the circuit something was broadcast from the coat hanger aerial, because a coat hanger shaped chunk of wall instantly vanished.It happened soundlessly and in a fraction of a second of time.Jerry hurled off the current, and they rushed to the wall.Through the new opening they could see the board fence that circled the backyard  and the same strange force had also taken a coat hanger shaped section from the fence as well."And spreading," Chuck mused."That hole in the fence is two or three times as big as the first opening. ""Not only that," Jerry said, squinting along the edge of the hole."If you look, you'll see a stub of a mast next door where the Grays' new color TV aerial used to be.And, let me think for a second, yes, I'm right.That missing section of fence is where the landlady's cat sleeps in the afternoon.And he was sleeping there when I came in. ""This will take some thinking out," Chuck said as they hammered boards over the opening in the wall "We had better keep it to ourselves for a while.I'll send an anonymous check to the Grays for their aerial. ""We better think about an anonymous cat for my landlady as well. "A sudden knocking on the door startled them both, and they exchanged glances, for it was the landlady calling to them.Mrs.Hosenpefer was a good woman, though advanced in years, a widow who had run her home as a boardinghouse ever since her husband, a switchman on the railroad, had met a tragic end under a boxcar that his advancing deafness had prevented hearing approach.Somewhat guiltily the two young men opened the door to face the white haired widow wringing her hands with despair."I don't know what to do," she wailed, "and I know I shouldn't bother you out here, but something terrible has happened.My cat"  both listeners recoiled at the word "has been stolen.Poor Max, who would do that to a sweet harmless animal like that?""Just what do you mean 'stolen'?"Jerry asked, fighting desperately to keep the tension out of his voice."I can't imagine why, some people will do awful things these days, it must be the drugs.Here I thought my Max was asleep on the fence out there"  the two listening men stirred ever so slightly at the words  "but he wasn't.Kidnapped.I just had a phone call from the sheriff in Clarktown that somebody had thrown Max through a window or something right into the middle of the Unreformed Baptist choir practice.Max was very angry and scratched the soloist.They caught him and called me because of the tag on his collar. ""This call came through now?"Jerry asked, innocently."Not a minute ago.I rushed right out here to ask for help. ""And Clarktown is eighty miles away," Chuck said, and the chums exchanged pregnant, significant glances."I know, an awful distance.How can I get my darling Max back?""Now don't you worry an instant," Jerry said, gently ushering the bereaved woman out."We'll drive right over and get Max.It's in the bag. "The closing door shut off her cries of gratitude, and the experimenters faced each other."Eighty miles!"Chuck shouted."Instantaneous transmission!""We've done it!""Done what?""I don't know  but whatever it is, I feel it is a great step forward for mankind!"2  A SHOCKING DISCOVERY  "We'll just have to go back to the old drawing board" Chuck sighed gloomily, looking at the large hole in the ground where the boulder had been and at the larger hole in the nearby hillside."We just can't control the cheddite projector no matter how hard we try. ""Let me have one more go," Jerry muttered as he probed the depths of the device with a long shanked screwdriver.For security's sake they had built their invention into a small portable Japanese television set, and so cunningly contrived the inner wiring that it still functioned as a TV as well.Jerry finished his adjustment and switched the set on.There was a quick glimpse of a vampire sinking his fangs into a girl's fair neck before a secret button activated the cheddite projector.The TV screen now displayed a complex wave form which changed shape as further adjustments were made."I think this is it. "Jerry grinned as he sighted along the aerial."I'm going to focus on that stick and move it over by the ridge there.Here goes. "There was no sound or visible radiation from the device, but the cheddite force sprang out, unseen yet irresistible.The stick did not move.However, a great rock a hundred yards away disappeared in a fraction of a second and reappeared over the lake behind them.The sudden tumultuous splashing was followed instantly by a wave of water that washed around their ankles."Our problem is control. "Chuck grimaced unhappily, wiping off the TV set."There has to be a way," Jerry said, his words as firm as the set of his jaw."We know that the cheddite produces a wave of kappa radiation that drops anything in its field through into the lambda dimension where space time laws as we know them do not exist.It appears from the mathematical model you constructed that this lambda dimension, while congruent with ours in every way, is really very much smaller.What was your estimate?""Roughly, our spiral galaxy which is about eighty thousand light years across is, in the lambda dimension, about a mile and a half wide. ""Right.So anything moving a short distance in the lambda dimension will have moved an incredible distance in our own dimension when it emerges.That's the theory all right, and it checks out to fifteen decimal places  but why can't we make it work?"It was then that Jerry realized that he was talking to himself.Chuck had that glazed look in his eyes that meant his brain was churning away busily at some complex mathematical theorem.Jerry recognized the signs and smiled understandingly as he packed the cheddite projector and test equipment into the back of their battered jeep.He had just finished doing this when Chuck snapped back to reality as suddenly as he had left."I have it.Molecular interference. ""Of course!"Jerry said gleefully, snapping his fingers."It's obvious.The kappa radiation is deflected ever so minutely by the atmosphere.No wonder we couldn't control the results.We'll have to carry on the rest of the experiments in a vacuum.But it will be some job to build a big vacuum chamber. ""There's one we can use not far away," Chuck said with a chuckle."Just one hundred miles ... "They burst out laughing together as Jerry pointed straight up."You're so right  there's all the vacuum we need up there.Just a matter of getting to it. ""The Pleasantville Eagle will take care of that.We'll say that we're testing, what?Navigational equipment.They'll let us borrow her . "The Pleasantville Eagle was the plane that flew the football team to all its games.Since it was a 747, it flew most of the spectators as well.Both Jerry and Chuck were trained pilots, as well as superb rifle shots and champion polo players, so had relieved the pilot at the controls many times.They had modified and improved most of the electronic equipment on the big plane so it seemed only natural that they would have improvements for the navigational rig as well.They would have no trouble getting permission to test fly the plane, none at all.Particularly since Chuck's dad had donated the plane to the school in the first place.They hurried back to the lab and had just finished building the cheddite projector into a navigation frequency receiver when there came a familiar light tapping at the door.Both young men sprang to open it, scuffling goodnaturedly before throwing it wide."Hi," Sally Goodfellow said cheerfully, strolling in casually, a vision in a green cotton summer frock, almost the same green as her lovely eyes, her shoulder length hair the color of golden cornsilk."What are you two guys up to now?""Same old stuff," Jerry said offhandedly as Chuck winked broadly behind the girl's back.No one, they had agreed, no one was to know about the cheddite projector until they had tested it thoroughly.They had taken their oath on that, and as much as they loved Sally with every fiber of their beings, they would not break that oath."What old stuff?"Sally asked, not deceived for an instant."Improved navigation aid.You're just in time to drive us to the field so we can install it on the Eagle.We have the jeep engine apart, rebuilding it. "Sally arched one delicate eyebrow."You really think I'll buy this story about navigational aids?I know that is one thing your new invention is not.Remember how you told me the flying wing design was a kid's kite?And the paralysis vibrator was a soldering gun?So what do we really have here?"Both of them had the good manners to blush, but in response to her questioning they only returned mumbled evasions and rushed to load the equipment into the back seat of her yellow convertible.Seeing that frontal attack had failed, she decided on subtlety which worked well for her for she had a fine mind, almost as good as that of her father, Professor Goodfellow, the school president."Sit up here with me, Chuck," she said, patting the front seat invitingly."Jerry can ride in back and look after your old equipment. "Chuck was only too eager to oblige, and they chatted happily all the way to the airport, driving into the glory of the summer sunset.Sally parked under the great wing of the Pleasantville Eagle so they could unload.Jerry saw Old John shuffling between the buildings with his trusty mop and pail and called him over to help them.Old John was an institution at this institution, a black gentleman of advanced years."Dat's some mighty heavy stuff you have dere.Too much for an old man like me. "But there was a glint of unspoken humor in his eye as he bent to lift the hundred pound transceiver in one hand.A lifetime of hard labor had made no weakling of him.They made their way through the cavernous plane to the flight deck above the nose, where they set to work at once with their soldering irons while Sally watched with growing curiosity."Do you have the axis traction forceps?"Jerry asked, half buried in the equipment."I really need them to get at this baby,"  "They're not here," Chuck answered after rooting through the tool box."Maybe we left them in the car.I'll go look. "He made his way back through the now darkened plane to the car and found the forceps where they had slid under the front seat.Whistling quietly through his teeth, he was making his way back through the gloom of the great cabin when a voice called to him."Chuck.Over here. "It was Sally, sitting by a window and beckoning him toward her, the last light of day touching her sweet profile with gold.He went over to her, and she smiled."There's something I want to show you," she said, and when he was close, she pulled forward the top of her scoopneck dress."No bra," she husked.Even in that dim light the blush that suffused Chuck's fair skin could be seen as a rising tide of scarlet.Yet, despite his shyness, his reflexes were still hard at work."Not until you tell me what the new invention is. "Sally laughed saucily, slapping aside his questing wrist as she pushed shut the neck of her dress."Sally, honey, you know I can't, gee, we have an oath.... ""I have something twice as good as an oath," she murmured, pulling her dress forward again."See?The invention?""It's, well, hard to say. "His voice was thick and turgid."You'll find a way. "She guided his hand."Here, this will help. "In an almost hypnotized voice Chuck began to talk.But, even as the first words left his mouth, he heard a tiny clinking sound and, his attention drawn now, was aware of a darker form in the darkness of the cabin.With great reluctance he drew away from Sally and turned on the light above the seat."Who's there?"he called out, clenching one great fist."Come out. "There was a rustle a few rows down, and a familiar figure emerged."Just cleaning out the ashtrays, suh," Old John said."Gotta be spick 'n span for the next game. "They both laughed, and Chuck patted the old man on the shoulder."Better go clean the trays in the aft section," he said kindly.Old John ambled off, and Sally sat down again, Chuck dropping heavily beside her, and they were just getting back on the job where they had left off when the rasping of the loudspeakers caused them to jump up hurriedly."Chuck," Jerry's voice said."Just about done up here.Bring that forceps on the double, and we'll see if this old thing really works. "There was repressed excitement in the tiny cabin as Jerry made the last connections."There," he said, leaning back and wiping his grease stained hand on a piece of cloth."Ready to go.All that has to be done is to take her up and try her out. ""Oh, please," Sally begged."Please let me come with you.I know it is something exciting. ""Exciting isn't the word for it!"Jerry chortled."This is the greatest ball of wax to ever come down the pike, you wait and see.Once we prove the theory tonight."The whole world will know by tomorrow when we break the news," Chuck said."So why don't we tell Sally now?She's a good sport and won't spill the beans. "They nodded in silent agreement with each other."Why not?"Jerry grinned."It is only something that will revolutionize transportation, that's all.I won't go into exactly how it works, it's a little complicated, and besides, it's a secret.But to put it simply the cheddite projector here will move this entire plane a couple of hundred miles in a fraction of a second, bang, just like that. ""What a saving on fuel!"Sally gasped."You're not just whistling 'Dixie'," Chuck agreed."But more than just the saving in fuel will be the saving in time.With this gadget aboard, all a plane has to do is take off and hover over the airport, press the button, and zing they are over the other airport, maybe all the way across the country. ""It could be important for defense too," Jerry said, suddenly serious."The Air Force will have to be the first to know. ""If it works," Chuck said, inserting a note of caution into the conversation."But by tomorrow we will know for certain. ""For you," a guttural, husky voice, rich with menace, said, "there will be no tomorrow.I'm taking over. "As one they spun about and looked at the open doorway, their jaws dropping in unison.Old John stood there, but suddenly, as though a mask had been ripped away, they saw that Old John was not as old as they had thought.Was that powder that turned his hair gray at the temples?He stood straighter, alert, a sneer slashed across his features.A Russian 7.62mm Shpagin M1941 PKS submachine gun was cradled in his arms, the gaping, deadly mouth pointing unswervingly in their direction.3  AN UNEXPECTED JOURNEY  Shocked, unbelieving silence filled the cabin like a gray fog.Chuck shook his head as though to clear it, for this situation was impossible, Sally spoke, gasping, speaking for them all."This is impossible!"In response the sneer on Old John's features only widened, and he slapped the blue steel of the gun with one hand."This is not only possible but it is a 7.62mm PKS capable of firing twenty two shots a second  so put up your hands,"  They raised their hands."Think of what you are doing," Jerry entreated, appealing to the man's higher senses."You're throwing up a good salary, security, a fine pension soon, for what?For some desperate plan that cannot possibly work.Who paid you to do this  the Black Panthers'!""I am far beyond your petty bourgeois internal disruptionary feuds," he sneered viciously, reaching into his pocket, while the gun barrel never wavered a fraction of an inch, and taking out a green cap which he pulled on at a jaunty angle over one eye.As his hand came away, they all gasped in unison for there, blazoned boldly on the front, was a great red star with the gold letters CCCP below it.He smiled coldly at their consternation, "You will now stop calling me by my cover name and will refer to me by my correct title of Lieutenant Johann Schwarzhandler of the Soviet Secret Police. "As he said this, he clicked his heels together, the sound loud in the tiny cabin."You can't mean it. "Chuck gaped."You're no Russian.I mean you don't look like a Russian.I mean, you know, Russians, blond hair and cigarettes hanging from their lips.... ""Prejudiced capitalist honky swine!You think that every black man in the world is a willing slave to his imperialist masters.You forget that there are parts of the world where the free air of socialism is breathed by the unshackled arms of workers freed from the repressive toils of the so called free enterprise system.My father, who was born on One Hundred and Twenty fifth Street in the city of New York, breathed that free air while reluctantly serving in your warmongering Army in Germany and married my mother, who was from the People's Democratic Republic of Germany, but enough, I waste my breath talking to you.Suffice to say that after my father's untimely death my mother returned to her ancestral home, and I grew to stalwart manhood under the snapping red flag of freedom. ""Treacherous turncoat Commie swine," Jerry murmured through clenched teeth."Flattery will get you nowhere.Now do as I say " Chuck stepped forward, mighty fists clenched, and the muzzle of the gun swung toward him.Instantly, Jerry dived for Johann.But the Soviet spy was too fast for him.He stepped back and swung the gun, and a single shot cracked out, booming loudly in the confined space.Jerry dropped, a growing red stain on his shirt, and Sally screamed."Do not move," their captor ordered."You have no chance to escape, as I have just demonstrated, since I am a perfect shot.That single bullet penetrated Jerry's biceps, and you will find the spent slug lodged in the second volume of American Airports in the navigator's cubby.Now  about face and march out of here!"They had no recourse but to obey.Sally wrapped her scarf around the neat hole drilled in Jerry's arm, and they walked reluctantly down the brightly illuminated corridor of the plane until they came to the toilet area."Far enough," the Soviet spy called out."Each of you into one of the booths, and I want to see the occupied lights come on. "With dragging feet they followed the cruel instructions, and Jerry had one last glimpse of Sally's endearing smile and the wave of a tiny hand before the prison door clanged shut behind her.Then Jerry entered his own cell and busied himself washing and cleaning his wound and binding it up again, gritting his teeth and ignoring the pain.Suddenly his sensitive nostrils twitched, and he jumped about.Yes!There was a glowing red light at the crack around the door, and the paint was beginning to blister.Muttering an oath under his breath, he unbolted the door and hurled his weight against it.It did not even quiver.The thud of his body and his groan as he realized he had hit the door with the wrong shoulder were echoed by sardonical laughter from the corridor outside."Yes," a wickedly jubilant voice called out, "The doors to your cells are welded shut, for I brought the oxyhydrogen torch with me that you so carefully provided.Now that you are secure I can tell you that not only am I an excellent shot, but I am also an expenenced pilot with thousands of hours on aircraft of all kinds.You undoubtedly thought I would attempt to steal your invention and escape and that you would then track me down and recapture me. "The silence that followed indicated the acuteness of this observation."Well, you were wrong.I shall now fly this plane to Mother Russia, where experts will go over it inch by inch, and also over you inch by inch as well!"His wild laughter sounded over the thud thud of their helpless bodies bounding off the cruel steel of their cells.He knew that if he had told them earlier of his plan, they would have died fighting rather than be carried into foreign bondage.But now it was too late.The sound of Johann's retreating footsteps sounded the death knell to their hopes."It's all over then?"Sally sobbed, her voice clearly heard by the others through the thin but sturdy walls of their prison."Nothing is over until death draws the final curtain" Chuck said stoutly to cheer her up."I'll put my mind to this. "He instantly began thinking and lost contact with the others no matter how loudly they shouted and banged on the wall.Jerry gritted his teeth and clenched his fists and ignored the pain that tore at his arm."I just don't know the word 'defeat'," he said grimly, and Sally took heart from his words and washed her tearstained face, then sat on the john and put her makeup back on.She had faith in Jerry.But Jerry was losing faith jn himself.First one engine, then another started, until all four of the giants were rumbling with power and the great plane surged forward toward the runway.What could he do?He swept the limited environs of his cell with the eyes of a trapped animal.How could he escape?He realized then that a mixture of panic and pain was beginning to take over and that would not do.American grit was not defeated that easily.He took a deep breath and forced himself to think.Two minutes of concentrated thought gave him the answer.By that time they were airborne, which was all for the good since the noise of the engines would cover any sounds he might make.He carefully emptied all money, rubbers and credit cards from his plastic wallet and with infinite patience and his pocketknife he cut the wallet into thin shreds in the stainless steel sink.He then added a specific amount of liquid soap and kneaded the resultant mixture to a doughy mass.Any ninth year chemistry student could have figured this one out, and he marveled at his slowness in taking so long to think of it.These two innocent substances, plastic and soap, when mixed in the proper proportions and heated to the correct temperature  he held his cigarette lighter under the sink for exactly four minutes and twelve seconds  polymerized into a powerful explosive.It was ready!Working quickly, he pressed the plastic mixture into the doorjamb from roof to floor, where it instantly congealed.Then, getting a firm grip with his fingers and tensing his powerful muscles, he tore off the top of the monomatic toilet, exposing its innards.Rushing against time, he pulled out the length of wire that controlled its operation and pushed its bare copper ends into the now stiffened plastic explosive."All or nothing, " he said jauntily and pressed himself as far back in the corner as he could and held a wad of wet paper towels before his face and, with forceful decision, pressed the switch to flush the toilet.The diverted current raced through the wires and into the plastic explosive....If there had been a watcher in the corridor, which there wasn't, he would have seen a crackling red explosion gout out from around the door, followed by a burst of smoke, followed by the door itself which flew into the chairs opposite.Followed by a ragged, smoke stained and scorched, yet still jubilant figure that staggered to freedom clutching the wet paper towels."What was that?"Chuck called out, jarred from introspection by the explosion."The liberty bell," Jerry said and coughed out a lungful of smoke."Let's just hope our Russky friend on the bridge didn't hear it.Now look at that  he was obliging enough to leave the torch here. "Moments later the doors were open and the three friends reunited.While the two men shook hands firmly and began planning their bid to retake control of the plane, the industrious Sally found a first aid kit and put unguents on Jerry's burns and redressed the wound in his arm."Rush him and grab him," Chuck growled, his great fists clenching as though they already had the enemy neck in their grasp."He's too shrewd for that," Jerry disagreed."He'd shoot us like clay pigeons before we got halfway to him.We need a better plan.Any shooting and someone gets hurt or the plane is wrecked.I have the feeling he would rather dive this thing into the ground than surrender. ""You're right.We need sound thought, not brutal violence, and that's my clue to put on the old thinking cap. "His eyes glazed in a familiar fashion, and Jerry, ever a man of action, ignored his burns and bruises and pulled Sally down into the seat next to him and got his arm around her and nibbled his way up her neck to her mouth and was putting all of him into a gustatory soul kiss when Chuck snapped his fingers and rejoined them, too carried away by his new idea to notice the rapid pulling away, straightening of clothing and wiping of chins."Here it is, and it can't be stopped.You remember we set up the cheddite projector to work through the radar aerial on top of the plane, right?""Right!""Okay.So the field envelops the entire plane.What I am going to do  me, not you, Jerry, so don't argue, not with that busted wing  is sneak into the radio operator's cubby where we installed the equipment.Even if that Russky spots me, I can reach it before he can plug me.Then I'll have a couple of seconds before he can set the automatic pilot and come after me.Two seconds is all I need.I'll set the direction on a hundred and eighty degrees and give it a thousandth of a volt, and you know what that means. "Jerry's forehead puckered as he did some quick calculation."As near as I can figure it, that will put the plane over the middle of Hudson's Bay in Canada. ""Rightl There will be just enough fuel left by then to reach an airfield in Canada, but not enough to fiy to Russia or Siberia or Cuba.We can play it by ear from there. ""A good plan, and the only chance we have.Let's go!"The muttered roar of the great engines covered their approach as they crept stealthily through the first class lounge toward the open door of the pilot's compartment.Through the opening they caught a quick glimpse of the hijacking spy's head as he sat at the controls, outlined against the star filled sky beyond.Chuck shook hands quickly with his friends and smiled happily when Sally stood on tiptoe to give him a quick kiss.Then, with a wry wave of his hand, he began creeping forward.He had almost reached the door to the radioman's cubby when something disturbed Johann, some noise heard or perhaps a spy's highly developed sixth sense.At first he moved his head uneasily; then he looked about suddenly and spotted the burly American so close behind him.He roared a brutal curse in some crude foreign tongue and grabbed up the submachine gun and fired  all in the instant.But Chuck, with a superb dive of finely tuned athlete's muscles, had plunged through the door an instant before the bullets tore into the spot where he had been.Johann was right behind the screaming slugs, running forward with his gun ready and still mouthing curses, when Chuck hit the controls.A spin of two dials, and he slammed home the actuator switch just as Johann burst in on top of him.Something happened.Something impossible to describe, a twitching sensation perhaps that each of them felt through their entire body, through the entire fabric of space.It was as though their insides were nothing but an immense string on a bass viol and something had plucked that string.It was indeed an unusual sensation, and even as it occurred, other things were happening.The great jet engines gasped and died.Johann gave Chuck a quick chop with the butt of the gun that plunged him into unconsciousness, then spun about.The stars beyond the window seemed sharper, more clear  and something else.Light flooded the cabin as the great airship tilted and an immense planet swam into view below.Filling half of the sky, glowing with reflected sunlight.A planet far greater than Earth.And girded with great glinting rings that floated in space around it.4  A VICTORIOUS BATTLE ENDS IN TERROR  The Russian spy was petrified by the sight, stock still and gaping.It was a sight to paralyze anyone, and concealed in the ship behind him Sally had been seized by the same paralysis.But not Jerry!He had been expecting something and had planned for this moment, in fact was scarcely aware of what was happening outside the plane.The instant that Johann had appeared and turned his back Jerry raced soundlessly to the attack, hurling himself forward like a human bullet.In fact, if there had been observers, they would have discovered that he had broken the Olympic record for the ten yard dash.The paralysis was only momentary, and the spy was turning and raising his gun but  too late!for Jerry was upon him, his arm drawn back, his fist cocked.
