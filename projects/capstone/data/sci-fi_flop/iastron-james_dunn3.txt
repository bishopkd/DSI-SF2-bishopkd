She turned  No!Justus shot up from his bed, covered in sweat, his breathing faster than he could cope with.A figure stood in the open doorway at the end of his bed, its silhouette blocking most of the light from the corridor outside.Sir, spoke the figure.Were here.The sliding door shut and Justus swung his legs out over the edge of the half sized bed.Bastard nightmare, he said, clutching his head as though it would remove the aching pain within.Struggling to disregard the dream and the girl hed seen, whilst at the same time debating with himself her strange presence, he attached a leather belt to his red tunic over which he wore his deep black coat.Putting on heavy boots he strode out of his room, down a corridor, and into the cramped cockpit of the Nyx.There stood the man that had woken him, joined by two soldiers clad in dark armour, and finally Constantine Lesper, who leaned over in conversation with the two pilots now steering the ship into  Justus gasped.Astonishing, isnt it?Lesper said, grinning.He didnt reply, but stepped forwards in awe.Before them soared the most beautiful, stunning, and somehow terrifying sight he had witnessed in his twenty six years: reflected in his now dilated pupils there glowed a striking storm of inexorable bursts.Words and colours could not describe the sight.The wrathful sea which conquered the entire world glowed in flashes of sapphire and amethyst, the lightning spreading across an alien globe of unspeakable beauty.Welcome, Lesper said triumphantly, to Tempest Beta.However, the place they were headed was not the planet.The Nyx navigated around the world for some twenty minutes, in the direction of a small moon which clung in pronounced orbit.Justus turned to Lesper, who had been watching his reaction with keen intent.Were not going down there?I hope not.No.Were headed for that.The commanders heavy finger aimed awareness to the dark moon in the distance.Whats special about the moon?Lesper approached the captain until they were close enough for him to whisper.Its not a moon, Captain.Not a moon?Then ...Then what is it?Thats why were here: to find out.He turned sternly to the pilots.Dont take us too close to the wrong side now.Last thing we want is to get pulled down.Chances are we wont get back up.Justus recalled the departure from Rotavar.When they had left on an obviously non Crilshan vessel through the impassable blockade without hindrance he had questioned Lesper as to what kind of project he was being taken to.His reply had been silence.When hed brought it up a couple of days after leaving hed been told not to ask anything more of it.What is it if not a moon?Not a moon in the traditional sense.Technically speaking it is now, but there was a time when it wasnt.But  Captain, please.Ill tell you all you need to know later.For now, trust me.They continued to approach the body of pure black rock when Justus saw to his amazement a large triangular structure obtruding from the surface.It was as dark as the rock itself but reflected metallically the dazzling tempest below.The ships engines were cut once over the massive metal base and slowly they descended through its dark crown.Justus heart hammered his chest at what he was about to witness as he was led to the back of the ship.Wait here, Lesper told him.Youll be taken to your quarters right away.I will call you to see me later.And he left Antal Justus stood in the cold cargo hold as the Nyx made its final, rickety descent into the Weapon to Destroy Worlds.* * *  The weapon to destroy worlds!Justus said as he stepped foot off the Nyx and descended the cargo ramp.Like hell it is!He moved cautiously down the ramp to be met with the sound of diligent men and women circling the Nyx, manually strapping in clamps and braces, and taking a moment to look upon the visitor.Furthermore, what he found at the bottom was the last thing hed expected.A dark haired, attractive woman, with arms crossed and lips pursed, stood awaiting his arrival.Normally hed keep his face stern so as to keep up his credibility as an officer for as long as he could, but her general mannerwhich yelled, I absolutely dont want to be herecaused him to grin widely.It appeared she appreciated this even less than his presence.Antal Justus, he said, holding out his hand.Lips still pursed, she regarded him for a second, before taking his hand firmly.Youre the captain?she replied, her accent familiar, her tone somewhat dissatisfied.I am, he said.Youre from Earth.Spot on.You can tell?Id pick the accent out of a thousand.Well done.She tilted her head ever so slightly, as though taking him in.While not going so far as to call her a goddess, he wouldnt have been far wrong.She offered a mature charm, very much like Adra Dimal had.Thats what had always attracted him to his old co pilot.After a moment she said, Im Avne Ketrass.Follow me.And she turned to lead him through the dock.The Weapon to Destroy Worlds?he said a second time.How on planet Earth could this place be considered a weapon?What?Ketrass said.Ohnothing.Good.Come.The dock itself was relatively small compared to most hed seen; it was deeper than it was wide.The ship had descended through the centre of the great structure and moved down to emerge at an undersized opening.There were two vessels docked at present, including the Nyx, and it appeared there wasnt space for even one more.Nevertheless, some two dozen overall clad men and women went about their business, working and conversing in hushed mutterings.Justus wasnt sure what he had expected, but this certainly wasnt it.Ketrass led him down the orderly corridors leading off from the dock, which he found sorely reminiscent of the large battle cruisers used by the forces on Earth.The layout certainly seemed similar, but he couldnt be sure, having only been aboard said ships the once.He hurried to keep up with her vigorous pace, but wasnt complaining with the view she provided from behind.Beneath her long, white lab coat he could make out Ketrass slender, toned form.She obviously took care of herself, but he guessed it was nothing less than a prerequisite of living under the demands of artificial gravity.No doubt hed have to take up a daily exercise regime of his own now too.So, he said, hoping to break the silence, who built this place?Shhh, Ketrass hissed.No talking.Just keep up!He continued, I mean this really is some feat.Youre out here, days away from civilization, above a dangerous planet in a foreign system.I hope theyre paying well!He was forced to stop all of a sudden as Ketrass halted and twisted toward him.Look, she said, you may be here for the money or the thrills or whatever your kind seem to look for in life, but Im here for the knowledge.Im here because no such discovery has ever been made in two thousand years of space exploration!And to be honest I dont have the faintest idea why Lesper recruited you in the first place!She turned her nose up proudly and carried on fuming down the hallway.Justus loved it when they were feisty.He smirked and followed.Ill take it thats a no to the good pay thing then.They continued marching through until they reached a straight corridor filled with a dozen doors, spread out on each side; the low ceiling above, Justus noticed, was packed with pipes and unkempt looking cords and cables.Ketrass opened the door to his immediate right and showed him in.Dirt and grime greeted them; strange stains covered the walls and bed, which was decorated a revolting grey.Youre here, she said, smirking.To anybody else it might have been hell, but Justus had spent years living in much worse.Love it, he said.What times breakfast?She frowned.Five, Accentaurib time.You can tell the time cant you?I get by.Make yourself comfortable.Youll be here for the foreseeable future.He opened several cupboards and a large rat scampered out and through the open door.Not coming in?he grinned.She let out a huff of air.As much as Id love to join a greasy stranger Ive just met in a room I wouldnt step foot in if you paid me, I actually have a job to do.What is it you do?She winced, but not at his question.Feel free to wash.Showers just down the hall.The sooner the better!Justus raised his eyebrows.Charming.I hope not.And get your hair cutits a mess.She disappeared before pulling herself back.Oh, and welcome to Erebus, she said as she vanished, sliding the door closed with a puff.Erebus, he repeated to himself as he listened to the shrill peep of another rodent somewhere within his mattress, before collapsing back on the new bed, hands behind his head.She likes me.* * *  Justus did as Ketrass so stoutly insisted the next day and showered properly for the first time in a long while, recruiting a reluctant neighbour to remove his long, grimy hair.It turned out shorter and smarter than hed ever worn it.He felt like a new man.Then again, he was: the old Antal had been left behind in the scorching desert of Rotavar.True to his word, it wasnt long before Commander Lesper called him to a meeting on the other side of the station.After changing into his new military uniform of pure black, Justus was once again escorted by a testy Avne Ketrass.Captain!boomed Lesper as he entered the office, standing from behind an ornate looking counter.Good to see you.How did you find your quarters?Theyre ...well theyre  Good!Good!He ordered Ketrass to leave them and physically placed Justus into a chair, sitting himself on the other side of the table where he continued to tidy away hurriedly any exposed papers lying out in view.Justus caught sight of the silver diary hed risked life and limb to deliver as Lesper swiped it into a drawer.Ignoring his instinct to ask about it, he bit his tongue and looked around.Mounted on shelves, just above the Commanders polished forehead, balanced strange drawings, a stuffed Aegean cat, and a vomit inducing pickled bird.Among the homes of many in the outer Systems, there hung the golden platea map of the Four Systemsas well as the old dictum, which Justus was unable to recall.Upon the Commanders wall, however, was mounted a strange image hed seen walking through the halls of Erebus station: a dark circle within a perfect triangle.Lesper eventually turned and activated something within his still cluttered desk.A familiar melody began to play: drums and strings and brass combined.So, he said, placing his large hands together, it appears you and I share much in common, Captain.Justus frowned.Do we?Yes, we do.Identify this music?The drums rose louder.Cymbals crashed.Earth march, Justus said.It was one of my favourites growing up.You and me both, Lesper replied.Good childhood?Strange question to ask.Oh, you know, this way and thatbusy lifealways moving.Quite right.Lesper sat back.Now Im sure youre dying to hear whats actually going on in this ...remarkable place.Naturally.Lesper lowered the volume of the Earth March and said, Hows your contemporary astronomy?Its been better.Youll have to improve out here.Ive managed so far.Quite.Well, a quick lesson for you here then.You already know the Second System, Proxima, is the closest star to humanitys home planet.After that come the Alpha Centauri stars, now Accentauria and Accentaurib.Voyagers have mapped out and visited many more, primarily Crulux and Fugio One, among others.We sit now, above Tempest Beta, a planet in outer orbit around the star Sirius.We are on our own out here.Get yourself into trouble, dont expect any help.Now, Ill start at the beginning.We found this place over a decade ago.Within a year we had built this station on top of, and within, the black rock moon.The weapon to destroy worlds?Indeed.Erebus?Ah yes, guessed my little riddle, did you?Actually Ive never heard of Erebus before.Ketrass mentioned it.Of course she did.Well youll be pleased to know this place isnt actually a weapon, little less a device to annihilate planets.Once our ship discovered the asteroid, keeping mum was not everybodys strong suit.Naturally word got out.The weapon story, simply put, became rumour control.My idea.We set about spreading all sorts of notions and theories, poles apart, about places such a contrivance could be kept.And we remain hidden a decade later because of it.So what actually is this place?Lesper leaned back in his chair and looked up at the mould invaded ceiling.We believe it is an asteroid from a far distant system which, some thousands of years ago now, became caught in Tempest Betas colossal gravitational field.This station was built so we could investigate the series of caverns leading into the asteroid.The rock here is like nothing we have ever seen.The minerals and deposits weve found give us hope that there may in fact be life here.Alien life?Justus leaned forward.Alien life.I thought such possibilities were just stories, false hopes from our past which those with any sense dismissed at childhood.We all heard the stories as children, Lesper said.Most of us shelved them in time.But Im sure therere plenty among us, myself for one, who still hope were not alone in the cosmos.Justus smiled weakly.The reality, long accepted by scientists the Systems over, was that, though man had journeyed beyond his home world for over two thousand years, never stopping exploring and learning all that he could, intelligent life was nowhere to be found.I think youre right, he said.So why am I here?Well thats simple, Captain.He pulled from beneath the table an expensive looking bottle of liquor.Security.When we got wind of your exceptional rescues and volunteer operations, especially the one on Enustine, we decided you were the man for the job.If youre happy to take over, youre the stations new military head.What happened to the last one?Retirement, Im afraid.Ill health.Sounds like a poor excuse, but you should have seen him.And whos financing this thing?You let us worry about that, Captain.He opened the bottle and filled two glasses to the brim.You have other duties.And theres plenty for you to see.Ketrass will take you on a tour and act as your guide while you settle in.Justus laughed, reached for a glass.I get the feeling shell like that!They sat for some time longer, drinking and chatting about Justus various exploits.The Captain couldnt wipe the smirk off his face.Hed always been worried that he would never leave anything behind, never do anything that mattered.That had always been his fear.But they had wanted him.This far out expedition had chosen him from one hundred billion people.And that made a galaxy of difference.Twenty      Lets get this straight, Avne Ketrass stated bluntly as Justus sat on the black leather medical table.Im not interested in anything youve got to say.I really dont care what you think of me.And Im only doing this because Lesper asked me to.I hear ya, the new captain answered with a smirk.He unbuttoned his black shirt and slipped it off.Ketrass eyes descended to the long, thick scar across Justus chest.He wasnt the most attractive man shed met, but he was certainly the first reasonably appealing male she had seen in all her time there.At thirty three, Avne had experienced her fair share of bastards, or men as they preferred to be called.She had been part of the Erebus Project for the past five years, and not a single second had been spent focused on anything other than her work.That wasnt about to change because some cocky ass had arrived.Even if he did look good with a haircut and new uniform.She swallowed slowly, averting her gaze to the metal tray behind her upon which lay various surgical blades and apparatus.Ketrass turned and noticed him grinning.She smirked back, revealing a large and lethal looking needle gun.Justus winced, tripping over his tongue in sudden surprise.Hellhoha!Where in hells that going?Nowhere too important, she said.Drop your pants.MY PANTS?!he cried, backing up on top of the table.Ketrass burst out laughing, and Justus shoulders dropped upon realising she was teasing.He dropped his legs back over the edge of the table, this time grinning nervously, and Ketrass brought the gun forwards, forcing it into his right neckline, just above the collarbone.Bleedin hellfire!he hollered, gritting his teeth in shock.And whats this for?She waited for the clack and pulled it out.Every member of the station is implanted on arrival with a station beacon chip.In case of emergency.That way everyones position can be identified in a single click.Ever needed them?Nope, she said smugly, taking a small contraption from her coat.And this is your PCD.My what?Your comm device.Itll keep you updated on the day to day running of the station.Keep it with you at all times.She handed him the small screened data comm device, about the size of her hand.He took it and switched the PCD on.Whats this?he asked, referring to the image of a circle and triangle.Oh that, she said.Thats our image, I think.You think?Well, its all around the station.I imagine it has something to do with our sponsors.All this time and youve never asked?She lifted her arms up and gestured out of the clear window.Look around you, she said.Im a little preoccupied with the discovery of the century.Itd bother me, but sure, whatever.Look, I dont care.They dont tell me.I dont ask.Justus, having already averted his attention back to the device, asked, Where do those passages lead to?He pointed to a map of the station which had appeared on the PCD comm.Two tunnels descended into the asteroid, one on either end of Erebus Station.The structure seen on top of the orbiting asteroid descended below the surface, much deeper than one would imagine upon first glance.The Captain read the text out loud, explaining each area: Sections One through Six.There wasnt anything of interest in any of the first five sections, Ketrass knew.But Section Six was different.Nobody was allowed down there except Lesper and Professor Kramerand anyone else they decided was deserving of the privilege.Ketrass had almost been down there, just once, but at the last moment been shunned.He looked up at her keenly.Honestly, she said, I cant tell you.Why?She strode to the other end of the room.Because I dont know.If theres anyone that does, its Commander Lesper and Professor Kramer.Kramer?Hes our head scientist here.Doesnt anyone have an idea?he asked, following her across to a large machine and placing his shirt back on.Ketrass initiated the contraption and it pulsated and shook into power.Well theres plenty of conjecture, she said.There must be something down there, or else they wouldnt have kept us out here so long.Justus frowned.She wished she hadnt used the word kept.Hed find that out for himself soon enough.Whats stopping you finding out whats down there?he asked.Ketrass heaved a long sigh and a smirk spread slowly across her austere features.Could it be there was actually more to him than thrill seeking and money grabbing?She doubted it.Whats stopping us?she repeated, pouting thoughtfully.Ill show you.But first, stick your hand in there.She motioned to the machine humming hungrily before them.A small hole, large enough for him to put a hand through, invited those curious, or perhaps foolish enough to lean a limb inside.He seemed to consider it carefully, for all of seven seconds.Left arm, wrist upright, she said as he leaned in.A moment later he was staring at her in utter horror.Oh, I should have mentioned.It might hurt a little.Better late than never, he said, once again through gritted teeth.As soon as the two clamps were released Justus yanked his arm from the device and surveyed the damage.A tattoo?he asked her.And there was me thinking you were slowly slicing off my handmy favourite hand, may I add?!Of course it is, she said.Poor baby.Wasnt there something you were going to show me?If youre not in too much pain.The Captain gestured with his tattooed wrist, upon which was now emblazoned the dark Circle within a Triangle.Lead on.Twenty One      Justus breathed out.His lungful of air floating in the space before him.It was mighty cold, and his uniform offered much less warmth than he would have liked.Once again he followed Ketrass down long, dark corridors.She strode ahead quickly while he occupied himself with his PCD comm as they descended various sets of ladders.Lower and lower.And then Ketrass simply stopped.Another elevator opened up before them, and again they descended into the dark depths of the asteroid.Moments later they were at the bottom, and ahead, along a dark corridor, stood a heavy metal hatch with a hard iron frame.This is the entrance, she told him.The entrance to what?She opened a long cupboard to their left and picked out a dark yellow bodysuit.Handing him one, she took her own from a row of ten and climbed quickly inside.Justus stepped into his and placed one of the nearby helmets over his head.Top heavy and incredibly uncomfortable, it immediately sent his balance into turmoil.Top of the range, ey?he said.Ketrass looked at himor at least he thought she did.He could just about see out of his helmets screen, and the inside wasnt lit, so he definitely couldnt see into hers.A piercing whine entered his helmet, followed by his guides calming voice.You hear me?Ouch, yeah, he said.Not so loud, gobby!A jarring thud connected with his helmet as Ketrass fist cracked the side.He smiled, then proceeded to follow her through the large hatch and into a small room; from there the hatch behind them closed and she opened the second hatch on the other side.As she did, she paused without turning, and said, I hate this bit.Justus would have asked why, but when she opened the last hatch and they stepped through the doorway it became well and truly clear.As though the temperature inside his suit had just plummeted, he suddenly felt terrible.Sick to his stomach, he underwent a flashing recollection of how he had felt that day on Rotavar ...the day of the invasion ...the day hed lost Kaara.He felt dizzy, sad, angry, and numb, as though he could concentrate on nothing else.Get out your torch, she said, reaching for hers.The one in your side pouch.If Ketrass had felt the same, she certainly didnt show it.They stumbled down a black rock cave, torches in hand, until they reached a ladder.They descended, emerging through a larger section of the cave.There she stopped, breathed in, and patted the black rock wall.Touch it, she said.Err, Ill pass.No, really.I get that.Come on.Im good!Fine, she mumbled.These tunnels are almost palaeolithic in purport.Ive been down here many times, and on each visit part of me half expects to stumble upon cave drawings of some sort.Cave drawings?As in ...cavemen?Oh, look at me, she said with a titter.Im being silly now.Justus snorted.Had she just giggled ...like a girl?They continued on and Ketrass explained her fascination with the tunnels.As a xenopetrologist it was her job to investigate the alien rock and materials down there.Her mother had done the same before her death.Theyd travelled to numerous new worlds together, and her mother had taught her the trade.She never mentioned her father.Explains a few things, Justus thought.All in all, her career sounded fascinating.Touch the rock, she said.I dont want to.Scared?Yes, he said.She led them on.They had only been moving for a minute or so when  GILAXIAD!What?Justus stepped forwards and took Ketrass arm, spinning her round.What did you just say?She shrugged him off.I didnt say anything!Yeah, you did.You said  GILAXIAD!He spun, shining the torch down the way theyd come.Nobody was there.GILAXIAD!He twisted the other way.That portion of the cave was empty too, so far as he could see.What are you doing?You cant hear that?GILAXIAD!Hear what?GILAXIAD!It echoed like a banshee, bawling along the passage.Justus recognised the voice; it was the same voice from his nightmare.But how?He walked down the cave tunnel.Wait!Ketrass said.I canttheres someone down there!GILAXIAD!He took a few steps, and then without warning the light went out.Ketrass torch still worked, and she pointed the beam in his direction.Justus drummed his torch on the palm of his hand.Nothing.Its dead, he told her.No, its not.Come back this way.Gilaxiad!the voice called, faint yet chilling.He walked towards Ketrass.He still felt sad, scared, angryunnaturally so.After a few steps the torch flickered and then came back on of its own accord.How?he asked.Nobody knows, she said.Some kind of interference.Justus stepped back.The light went out.Forwards again.It came back on.Gilaxiad ...To his surprise, Ketrass took his hand.Dont worry.It happens with all our equipment.Navigation kit just seizes up.Life suits and breathing tanks work, but all other life down here is sapped so quickly they dont last very long.He twisted back to look down the tunnel.Captain?His heart thudded.Captain?Justus?Justus turned back.He wished he could see her face.He felt so exposed, unable to hear anything but Ketrass voice, incapable of seeing much else.You dont have a clue whats down here?he asked.There have been numerous expeditions, she explained.Do you feel odd right now?Odds not the word.You feel angry ...sad?Yeah.Numb?Yeah.It gets worse the further down you go.Its nothing more than an endless maze of rock strewn tunnels.The people here have a name for it.Lespers idea of a joke.They call it the Black Labyrinth.The Black ...Labyrinth?He shivered.Very ...funny.She gestured into the darkness.Imagine going down there.No light.No way of knowing where youre going, which way to get back, or whats down there.I dont think I want to, he said, looking around, grateful that the echoing voice had stopped.Ketrass deep breaths filled his helmet.So youll understand why were short of volunteers?Justus snatched a few deep breaths himself.He hoped that wasnt the reason theyd brought him to the station.This is why everyones still here ...why theyre keeping you in this place?I think so, she said.Until we know whats down here no ones leaving Erebus.Not even you, Captain.The heavy feeling of despair clung to Justus as they made their way back up to their own quarters.Ketrass undoubtedly felt the same.Her unnaturally pasty complexion, combined with the fact she appeared to be shivering, made that obvious.He had decided to walk her back to her room, worried that she wouldnt make it, and so they both stumbled through in a dark silence.Passing nobody on the way, Justus merely wanted to return to his own room, curl up in bed, and sleep it off.But when they reached Ketrass room she turned and looked up at him through sensual, sea green eyes.Lonely eyes.Yearning eyes.Why did you agree to come here, Captain?Judging from what Ive just learnt, he replied, you dont even know what here is.Here is a hell and a haven, she said.Nobody comes here unless theyre running from something.And what are you running from?She stroked her hand through his dark, freshly cut hair.You talk different, she said.Not like everyone else.Do I?Theres something about you, I dont know what it is.But this much is clear to me: you shouldnt have come.It was a mistake.Ill decide that for myself, he said, and he leant forwards, touching his lips to hers.Soft but firm; sensual and altogether lusting.She clutched him by the shirt and pulled him in.He didnt resist, and drew the door closed behind.Twenty Two      The brash clatter of broken crockery met the blaring profanities launched from Ruben Berenguers mouth.He left the shattered plates on the floor and walked from the kitchen, through his apartment, and collapsed onto the couch.Lifting his portable data device he gazed down at the newly delivered report.It couldnt be true, it just couldnt.He switched the digi page and sent a message to one of his captains: My apartment.Now.General B.   Ruben knew what he had to do.But there were other matters just as serious as that he had just received.He switched the page again and opened up another file.Erebus, Erebus, Erebus, Ruben mumbled to himself as he flicked through the old and confidential reports.Erebus, Erebusah, yes!He widened the screen with his thumb and forefinger and whizzed through page after digi page of detailed reports.Most were made several years ago, connected by the subject line designated The Ascending Rumour of the Weapon Erebus.Instability within the Four Systems, pirating and bandit groups, weapon proliferation, and illegal narcotics were all challenges faced by Titanese Intelligence Operatives in the forty third century.Titanese spies were among the best, the very best, but the rumour of the Weapon X was different.Some of Titans best moles and agents had been lost in the search for Erebus; and finally, when nothing could be found, the Council had unanimously opted to surrender the investigation.He opened another report, dated about eight years earlier, which revealed that a very familiar Lady of Titan had been in charge of the investigation at the time, back when she was on the Council as Intelligence Director.Lady Maxim Pinzn had been very influential in closing the investigation into the Weapon X.  He hadnt known that.He stood, stunned.Blood rushed to his face, and he threw the device across the apartment.It landed in the middle of the kitchen, smashing the screen and denting the worktop.His heart beat in his temples.Could he trust no one?After lying down for a while, Ruben picked up his weary body and walked across the silent room to the floor to ceiling window.The city below blushed with a blood red glow as he gazed out from his high positioned home into the darkening night.The conditions of night and day meant nothing to the people on Titan, as heat, cold, light, and dark were rarely associated with the artificial sun as on other, non surrogate worlds.Most failed to appreciate its tremendous importance, as it was the heat and light from the device which kept them all alive.The Surrogate Sun was not an actual sun itself, but rather a series of intense beams emitted from inner arcs within each dome.Without it not a soul would survive.In order to function as a world which did have the heat and light from an actual sunand despite one day on Titan being the equivalent of around sixteen Earth daystime had been organised to imitate the hours, days, weeks, and months used on Earth; and it had been that way since the Twelve Cities were first founded.If he looked vigilantly, he thought he could make out a figure, furtively making its way through Central Citys shadowy streets, past Central Tower, and towards the Generals lofty home.The furtive figure soon arrived.Are we alone?Captain Diego Ferranti asked as he entered the apartment and removed his hood.The girls are in their rooms, Ruben replied.I dont think I was followed.If you were, there is nothing we can do now.Say nothing now and follow me.He walked across the room and opened another, concealed door, disguised as a bookcase, to reveal a small corridor.He led the young captain down and through to a reinforced door at the end.General Ruben Berenguer Azar de la Pea, he spoke into the voice recorder, and the metal slab shifted.Inside was a sealed room, adjacent to the other, and it was laid out with enough equipment to organise and deploy a small battalion of the Guard.Nigh impregnable, the soundproofed space stopped any listening devices dead in their tracks, and tracked signals and movement throughout all of Titan.Ill bet this has come in handy, the captain said with a slumped jaw.The General smiled.Like you wouldnt believe.Ferranti sat upon a stool at the central table and Ruben faced him across the workstation lined with various weapons and sections of military hardware.The captain placed his hands in his pockets in an obvious attempt to resist the urge to handle anything.So, Ferranti said, I gathered from the hour of your message that somethings going on.What was so urgent you had me come across two cities?Apologies for the hour, Captain.Thats ...fine, sir.I had you come here tonight, Captain, because you are one of the very few soldiers I can trust completely.Ferranti nodded, but remained silent.You have proven this to me time and time again, in battle and otherwise.He smiled.And yesterday, in the Council.Ah ...well ...Im sorry about ...that, General, he said, blushing, but I do feel strongly when it comes to your leadership.I couldnt let him question you  Yes, yes, I understand, and its that kind of loyalty I need right now.You see, Mauldeth and Pinzn are working together.Ruben stood and strode the length of the room.Theyre keeping things from the rest of us.And they think I dont know, but I keep my ears sharp.Pinzn, to use her exact words, seems to think me an interfering demagogue.Ferranti scoffed.So theyre screwing.Is that it?Unfortunately not.As far as were concerned, Mauldeths going to get his way with every last damn policy.As well as abandoning all aid projects currently in motion, theyre planning on recalling the entire Titanese fleet from duties throughout the Systems.With none of our soldiers out there well have an invasion much like Rotavar every other week.What are you thinking, General?Im thinking we go over and above the Council itself.We both know the outcome wont be good for those involved, but the prospect of a Titan controlled by Crilshar is something I wont entertain in a thousand years.Nor will I, Ferranti said, stoutly.Ruben placed his hands behind his back.How do you feel about taking the Stellarstream on one last aid mission?I assume you mean Rotavar?Ferranti smiled.The General sat back down slowly.Do you trust me, Captain?With my life, sir.Good.Because I wholly suspect the Dishan have acquired agents inside Titan.The explosion in the dock was meant to cause such a reaction as there has been in the Council, and it has made them blind to the fact that ensuring Rotavar is free is of upmost importance.We need their backing in order to gain the other Alignment worlds trust.And so we must liberate them without delay.Sir, Ferranti said, shifting in his seat, when you speak of agents, is it to General Mauldeth that you refer?Ruben thought for a moment.I dont think its safe to assume anyone is trustworthy at the moment, except for those within our inner circle.So, what do you say?Ferranti grinned.When do I leave?Ive already considered this.He activated the table and a projection emerged from the centre into the air between them, offering a map of Accentaurib.At its centre, closest to the systems sun, drifted Rotavar.Nearby were the planets Samos and Enustine.With the dock now completed, he said, I imagine we could have your ship prepped and off within the next forty eight hours.You may, Im afraid, have to miss the eight hundred year celebrations this week.Not a problem, General.Perhaps its for the best considering my track record.Very true.I shall arrange for the flight instructions to display your destination as the Martian Colony, for obvious purposes.If they knew where you were really going wed have two court martials before youd even left the System.We can coordinate an actual account over the next hour.By the time you arrive on Rotavar, Captain, it will have been almost a month since the invasion.Truthfully, I dont know what to expect.I know only that we have to help.What surveillance we do have tells us the blockading force has moved to the nearby Enusti Systems, leaving a possible ground force of thousands.They dont think any help is coming?Ferranti asked.No help is, Ruben replied with a glint in his eye.The Cherished Star will be waiting to rendezvous with you once you reach the Fourth System.Though even together you will be outnumbered  But we both know if it were easy you wouldnt be sending me, Ferranti said with unabashed assurance.Another thing, Captain.The crew is to be briefed only once they have arrived in the vessel currently in orbit.Not before they leave the Twelve Cities.Understood.Normal routes?Of course, he said.Stay away from any Impossible Vectors.Dont go making any dangerous leaps.Id rather have you reach Rotavar in six days and in one piece than in four and four thousand.Understood.Is there anything else, sir?Unfortunately yes, there is more, he said, unquestionably sedate.What is it?Ruben exhaled.The attack at the dock  Was not an assassination attempt, Ferranti finished.The General found himself slightly taken aback.Very astute, Captain.I wasnt sure youd believe the story.Of course not.Then you realise the device wasnt meant to kill me, or even to destroy my craft, but to cause enough damage to the dock that we would be unable to prepare a proper counter strike on Rotavar.Not to mention the damage it would do to our standing within the Alignment.Indeed.However the initial investigation swore to us that the explosives which destroyed the Quasars shuttle were placed inside the craft.What I was told before I called you tonight is that a grave error had been made when they gave us that report.This evening I have been informed by the in depth analysis team that the explosives in question were without doubt those of the Dishan Alliance, but also that they were detonated and exploded on the outside of the shuttle.Ferrantis face fell at the news.That means  Yes, the explosives could not have survived our arrival scans if on the outside of the craft.So they were placed on after your return, Ferranti said.Which means that those responsible are ...Ruben nodded.Still here.Twenty Three      The orb blazed a horrifying black.Callista gazed around the enormous chamber and happened upon three figures.All were covered in some kind of deep space gear, and they stood, awestruck, before the orb, ablaze in blackness.Somehow Callista knew that one was Anna Berenguer.Anna drifted toward the orb which seemed suspended in a mighty fissure between the black rock.There stretched a break between the chamber and the sphere, and Anna leaned over the opening to touch the colossal fire.NOOO!Callista Berenguer woke abruptly from her sleep, senses dulled.Candles burned and flickered around her in a hue of furtive calm.Seldom did she wake so sharply, and neither did she stir before her dream had ended.Something had intruded.Something was wrong.Anna was in danger.She persuaded her frail form off her bed and looked at the clock above her, recalling that the day was Annas birthday.It took some thirty seconds before she realised that the sound of music filled the room.She moved to turn down the music, striking a match and lighting a couple of candles on her way.She left the small music projector so that it continued to play softly.It was an old piece of splendid strings, a grand waltz the likes of which she enjoyed many years ago.She recognised it as one Anna always asked her to play when the young girls curiosity for planet Earth was beginning.Unsure as to whether she had unintentionally started it in her sleep she made to hobble over to her corner desk, which was cluttered with papers.When she heard movement in the dark behind her she turned sharply, unable to see a thing.She lifted her staff from the bottom of her bed and moved carefully across to where shed heard the movement.Nothing there.Still sleepy, she continued over to the small, circular window, blocked out by a broad, makeshift screen; and she looked out into the dark of early morning.Nothing.At once, strings resonated through the small space.The music she had turned down low began blasting out, shaking the ground beneath her.The screen slumped down, plunging her back into darkness, and she almost collapsed to the floor.Callista forced herself to focus and gazed out across the room connected to the one she was now in.Somebody was there.She could just about sense them.And there was no mistaking that dark cloud of malevolence.The old womans eyes shot to the nearby door.She could make it out if she were quick.Breathing in deep, she darted immediately for the way out.Unfortunately, in her haste, she took the music projector with her, sending it crashing to the floor.She froze in unsullied silence.Did you think it would be that easy?a cold voice whispered from the next room.Oh, no.Say what you have to, Crilshan!Very good, the wraith said, creeping forward.I knew you would see me that day.Even in a crowd of thousands a Istrons abilities are not to be underestimated.Dont move, she uttered.He kept walking.How could he ...I have to say, old woman, how surprised I am that you didnt go straight to your noble general with news of my presence.Thought youd deal with me yourself, did you?Leave!Thought Id be so easily removed?I am commanding you to go, FILTH!Oh, I will go.But first there is something I must do.You are the only one to have seen me.Dangerous position to be in, dont you think?As he walked towards her, the candles nearby seemed smothered and went out, the growing dark concealing his face.Now, he said, I think you should sit down, Istron.You dont want to get hurt, do you?The elderly woman looked to her door as it groaned slowly open and two more dark figures entered.Little by little, she backed up, beginning to pant, dropping her staff, and wondering how she could ever get out.She had indeed thought it possible to deal with the man herself; thought it better not to burden Ruben further when he had so much to deal with.She had scoured footage and reports of suspicious activities for the last two weeks since the attack, attempting with a determined effort to track the Crilshan down.If she had known that he was not alone ...Do not enter!she told the other shadowy forms with what strength she could.But they did not stop.Your tricks will not work on us, witch, the dark man said, amusement in his voice.His face was disguised by the dark, but she watched as he reached up and tapped on the ear coverings fixed over his head.Ive been watching you.I know all your secrets.She could hear her own heart beating wildly in the deathly silence that had fallen.Then it happened.A breath touched the back of her neck.A hand took hold of her left arm forcefully.Another grasped her right.The figure laughed beside her.She couldnt guess how many there were.Try not to make too much noise, spoke the callous man.This will most likely hurt a great deal.A sharp pain pierced her neck.She yearned to scream out, filled with agony, but a hand covered her mouth.Her weakened muscles rippled into spasm.She could feel herself getting rapidly weaker ...unable to breathe ...powerless ...incapable of crying for help.Her time had finally come.The cruel laughter around her faded and Callista fell into darkness.Twenty Four      Gasping for breath, Anna vaulted from her bed.Stood still in the fresh, cold light of early morning greeting her from the open terrace, she peered around.Something was wrong.Something ...awful.Panting and sweating wildly, she lay back down.Her dream had been more real than she had ever experienced it.No longer was the black fired orb alone.She had been stood before it, drenched in light.But she hadnt been there by herself; a tall, pale man had been there with her, just watching.And one word:  Gilaxiad ...It had been repeated, over and over, in a deep, thunderous voice.Whatever it meant, it terrified her.She turned over and closed her eyes.Gilaxiad ...* * *  It began with a necklace.Anna woke from what little sleep she had managed and, once dressed, stumbled down the steps leading from her bedroom, down to where her sister and uncle both stood, already dressed and sporting eager faces.Happy birthday, dear!uncle Ruben cried.Yeah, Glana added.Happy eighteenth birthday, Annie.She dropped down into the comfy couch behind her.Thank you, Anna said, forgetting the nightmarish night and simply enjoying the attention.She lifted her sister from her seat and hugged her too.Her uncle had prepared breakfast, so she was as good as carried over to the table, which was complete with a vast muddle of fruit, cakes, and meats.All of her favourites.So Anna, Glana said as the three sat around the kitchen table, whats Gilaxiad?Anna almost spat out a mouthful of pear.She looked up to her uncle, who appeared interested.Its ...err ...I unno, she replied with a full mouth.She swallowed slowly.Whered you hear that word?You were shouting it out in your sleep again last night.Again?Ruben said.Yep, shes been barking it out every night this week.Anna gave her little sister daggers.Thank you.Shes also in the room!Ruben frowned.Who is it then?A boy?Anna considered her answer.Yes, its a boy ...in my class.Andres ...err ...Gilaxiad.I see.Exotic name, isnt it?he said, not wholly convinced.Exotic?Glana laughed.Its hilarious!Youd better hope Jon doesnt find out youre dreaming about another guy.You keep quiet, you!Anna told her, but Glana and Ruben burst into laughter.Anna eventually succumbed and let out a smile.Didnt you invite Jon for breakfast?Ruben asked.I ...well ...he had to work.He said he had things to do still ...at the dock.Yes, I imagine its rather busy down there today.The first crafts will be launching in a matter of hours.Is Callista joining us?Anna asked, guiding the conversation away.She should have been here by now actually, he replied.I should call her, just to see when shell be arriving.Yes, she said.Do that.She didnt care what he did, provided he didnt ask any more about Jon.She had avoided him for days, hoping he would change his mind about leaving.Hopefully he would be at Titans eight hundredth celebration later that night.Maybe she could persuade him not to leave.She had no choice; she had to make him stay.Ruben strolled over to the bookcase and went to raise the comm, but it clanged before he picked it up.He answered and his expression adjusted.Yes, he said to whoever was on the other end.Yes, today would be terrific.He held his hand over the comm, and looked at the girls gravely.Excuse me, he said, before disappearing into the next room.Think its about tonight?Glana asked, taking a huge chunk out of a piece of burnt bread.Perhaps.Anna frowned.Security for tonight must be severe.The threat of another attack and all that.Hmmm, Glana responded, not really listening.She was busy fooling around with something beneath the table.She looked up, grinned at Anna, and placed a beautifully wrapped gift onto the table.I was going to wait until later, Glana said, but ...well ...you know me.I cant keep a secret for very long.Anna smiled and picked up the parcel.She opened it carefully to reveal a book, worn and dirty, bearing the image of a planet, beautifully blue and green, on the front cover.I cant see the appeal myself, she said.But Callista told me youd like it.Been trying to get it for ages.They dont make them like that anymore.Anna beamed.Its brilliant!She flicking through the browning pages: A GUIDE TO EARTH ...A LONG AND COMPLEX HISTORY ...THE GREAT CITIES OF THE WEST ...SEVEN RIVERS OF EURO ...GIZA NECROPOLIS ...THE VON: A FAILING LEGACY?...I cant wait to read it!She placed the battered book down and noticed another small box, no larger than her palm, positioned at the end of the mound of food.Whats in the box?she asked.Its from uncle Ruben.Her sister leaned in closer.Its a necklace.The special one?The one Callista gave to him?Yep.Youre right, Anna said.Youre terrible at keeping secrets!Glana blushed and continued to eat her own breakfast quietly.Before long the General marched back in, placed the comm back on the wall, and picked up a large, red apple.Just my office, he said, crunching into the fruit.Im going to have to go in this morning.You know how things are.He looked to Anna.Ah ...okay, she said.Did you contact Callista?No, no I didnt.Are you going to?Yes, yes I will.He went to pick the comm back up, but again it rang before he was able.He swore loudly, before composing himself and answering.General Berenguer here.His expression changed again.I see ...okay ...thank you very much ...oh yes, I shall!He slammed the comm back into place, frowning, asked Glana to go to her roomwhich she did, albeit reluctantlyand walked over to Anna.She stood.That was Vizor Guerrero calling from the Institute, he said, ringing to inform me that you havent attended classes all week.I ...I know I havent, she said.And why is that?I ...its hard to explain.Try.If its anything to do with what I do, with what you heard at the meeting the other day, then you have nothing to worry  Its not, she said.Well, it is.Sort of.She sat down, and he followed, placing his hands together on the table as he always did when concentrating.You can tell me, he said, smiling kindly.Its just ...I thought, with everything thats happening ...that you would stop me joining the Forces, stop me becoming a member of the Guard.Anna watched the smile disappear from his face.He did not reply.Its true!she cried.Youre not going to let me!Id hoped this could wait, he said, clearing his throat.But with all this chaos at the moment, I just feel its too dangerous for someone so inexperienced to go throwing themselves at this.But Im not inexperienced!Why else would you and Callista train me, if not to do this?We were preparing you.But youre not ready  Of course I am!Im willing to take the risk  But I am not!he said.Weve already lost my brother ...your father.We lost your mother when Glana was born.I wont let you risk your own life against those brutes.Isnt it my choice?Not while I am general!he shouted, his frail face now such a deepening scarlet that it resembled his half eaten apple.You have no real idea what its like out there, Anna!I know, she said.You never tell me.Because it makes me sick.People throw around the word terrifying with no thought.Out there its beautiful, yes.But also disgusting.Vile.Sickening ...Then why do you go out there?So that you and everybody else dont have to discover that for yourselves!Anna could not reply; she didnt know what to say.He had promised.He never broke his promises.What would she do if not join the Guard?It had been her life: preparing to follow in her familys footsteps.But what would be the point if she could not join when she would be needed most?All she wanted to do was help.The General had joined the Guard at her age, after completing his studies at the Central Institute.He had done what was common at the time and joined the Guard, recruited to the interstellar vessel, the Quasar.He had made his way up the ranks quickly, and all who saw and spoke to him knew he did what he did with the greatest conviction.Thats all she had ever wanted.Anna hung her head low and said nothing.Jon had been right.He knew her uncle would not allow her to do what she had always wanted.Now all she wanted was to see Jon.Uncle Ruben took her hand and smiled weakly.Anna looked at him; once the picture of perfect health and strength, now weighed down by a darkness she both hated and feared.He reached across the table and picked up the small box containing the necklace, placing it between them.Its your birthday, he said calmly.Focus on that.Theres a lot for you to be excited about, Anna.And, standing, he walked towards the door.Annas father, Dathlan Berenguer, had attended the same Institute as his older brother.It was there that he met Nolkiet Odto, with whom he fell madly in love.Soon after their marriage, Nolkiet had given birth to Anna.Sadly, Nolkiet departed three years later, while giving birth to Glana.For her father and uncle, nothing had ever been the same after her death ...Anna watched the General open the front door.But she had to stop him.She had to know one thing.Will you ever let me join, she asked, and he turned, if things get better?He looked at her through dark, jaded eyes.Well speak more of it again, Anna dear, soon.Enjoy your day, and Ill see you at the celebration later tonight.With that he left, and a tear rolled down Annas cheek as she opened the box to reveal a silver necklace, beautiful and stunning.But her stomach dropped as she picked it up to find at the bottom of the chain a small stone.It was smooth to touch and perfectly spherical.Contrasting with the silver, it was pure black.Dark.Beautiful.Terrifying.Breathing deeply she placed it back into the box and left it on the table, still littered with unfinished breakfast.Anna stood and left the apartment, now with one purpose: to find the only man she could trust.Twenty Five      Drums beat, one hundred tremendous trumpets sang in utter harmony, and warm air welcomed a thousand elegantly dressed guests as their excitement echoed through the Central Citys brightly lit streets.The armed Guard stood by while a parade marched through, and the light erupting from the display as it passed the Central Tower could be seen right across the towering horizon.Glana Berenguer watched the parade in awe, dressed in a long, sweeping gown in the Twelve Citys colours of purple and gold.She couldnt remember a time when any celebration had been as big.Shed stake a guess that it would not have been in her lifetime.After the procession marched on she turned and floated along with the rest of the crowd, along the piazza, and past the fountain which had been altered to gush with golden water.The women around her all wore the same colours, and the men were clad in tunics of black, silver, and for some gold as well.Up the steps leading from the marble courtyard and into the bustling entrance hall of the enormous tower, Glana looked up.The great height and beauty of the building took her breath away.As she stood still, however, a gentleman emerged behind her.His cold hand touched her bare shoulder.She turned sharply, startled and expecting to see Anna.But the man stared at her and didnt speak.He smiled eerily in his black cloak, and bore a scar across his cheek, jaw, and lips.A silver half mask obscured the top portion of his face.You are Glana Berenguer?he said, his accent odd.Glana did not reply.Frozen, her heart beat with no space to breathe.Again his hand touched her shoulder, and he allowed his sharp fingers to stroke her upper arm with the lightest touch.Oh dear, he said coldly, almost whispering.How sad to glimpse upon such innocent beauty, while the end is nigh.Ex ...Excuse me?Slowly, the man snapped his neck to either side, before pausing.Enjoy your party, little girl.All will change tonight.And he backed away, before turning and passing through the crowd and out of sight.Glana shuddered.She stood still for a few moments.Dozens of bodies surged within the grand hall, and they walked around her as though she were a servant, or not there at all.She gathered herself eventually and turned to enter the hall.It took some minutes of searching the various clusters of lords, ladies, guests, and the uninvited who had decided to sneak in anyway, before she noticed her uncle.She moved swiftly to his side and didnt speak with anybody.Old Anthea Godno attempted to attract her attention, but Glana hid behind a rather bored looking waiter until she had lost the old trout.The face of the sinister man still hung in front of her; her body continued to shake as she imagined his face, his scar, the putrid smell of filth on his breath.She wanted Anna there with her.It had been almost an hour since she had seen her last and the room was already full.Her uncle laughed loudly nearby, entertaining a group of his captains, their wives, and husbands.Fascinating indeed, he said, before turning to Glana.Youre unusually quiet tonight, dear, he said as he handed her a glass of wine.Just a little tired.Has my sister arrived?She said she was on her way, darling, interrupted Anthea Godno as she walked over and kissed her uncle on the cheek.I saw her upstairs not thirty minutes ago.Seemed so startled to see me.Bless!Glana grinned nervously, wishing the squeaky voiced little dwarf would waddle off already.Perhaps I should go and find her, uncle Ruben said.I really should have seen her this afternoon, and not left her to get ready on her own.Oh, shell be fine!hollered Anthea, clouting his shoulder and causing a portion of his wine to fall from his goblet and onto Glanas sandaled feet.Im not so sure, he said, massaging his left temple.Ive only just realised I forgot to get in contact with Callista.I havent seen her yet either.Neither have I, Glana added.It wasnt like Callista to be late, or to miss Annas birthday.Something wasnt right.She considered telling her uncle about the funny man outside.Come to think of it, with everything that had happened lately, it was too important to ignore.She had to tell him.Uncle?she said.Yes, dear?Good evening, lords and ladies of the wonderful moon of Titan!Together Glana, Ruben, and Anthea, along with everyone else in the grand room, turned towards the source of the voice, expecting to see somebody stood at one of the upper tiers of the hall.But no one was there.Glana recognised the voice immediately.The man from outside!She took hold of her uncles jacket.I have to tell you something  Shush, he said, his eyes darting around the room.Congratulations Titan!the voice said, for managing to remain resilient, even when the opposing force was stronger, greater, and considerably more deserving of victory!Nearby soldiers were at once rushing out.Uncle Ruben said something to one of them, who in turn shook his head in panic.What was going on?Then he turned to her.Glana, when did you last see your sister?Err ...at home, she said.She might still be there.In her room.She wouldnt let me in  Its coming from the central public address system, a nearby Guard informed the General.Uncle Ruben cursed.That wasnt good.Glana knew that the public address system was installed throughout the whole building, and was connected to numerous other important towers within the Central City.Youre sure?Ruben asked.Yes, sir, the soldier replied.He ignored the soldier.Youre sure thats where shell be, Glana?She nodded.Tell me, the cruel voice continued, where is the almighty general, Ruben Berenguer?Im here!uncle Ruben shouted, stepping into the middle of the dance floor while everyone around him parted.Im here and Im listening!Who are you?There followed a momentary pause, as though whoever spoke was considering their answer with care.Im the man who tore to pieces your docking city a few short weeks ago.Im the man who has been living among you for some time.And Im also the man behind tonights attack.What?screamed several of the crowd.Lets get out!yet more yelled, and throughout the hall people began moving in every direction.Everyone, calm down!Ruben shouted.Tell me who you are!Let us speak in person.Can we not do that?Again there was a pause amidst the uproar, as crowds of purple, silver, black, and gold made to leave the party as fast as possible.The General stayed rooted in his position; Glana stood firm behind him; Anthea Godno wavered behind her.Several of the Titanese Guard moved towards her uncle, while the others fanned out amongst the crowd, attempting to keep order.Go to Titans headquarters, came the eventual reply.Go to the office of Lady Pinzn.And go alone.No Guard or people die.I am coming as well!another voice uttered.Glana watched General Slimar Mauldeth shuffle across the dance floor and stand beside her uncle.If you face one general you speak to both!Very well.But no more.And come unarmed.Glana wished he wouldnt go, but deep down she knew he had no choice.He turned to her quickly and knelt upon one knee.I need you to go and find your sister, he told her.Its so important that you do.He looked up to the closest soldier.You will escort my niece to my apartment and find Anna.Keep your comm close.Yes, General.Once you have them both, take them below the city to the underground bunkers.Wait there with them until I send word.Right away, General.Ruben looked at Glana.Yes, uncle, she said.He turned, and with Mauldeth limping alongside, ran from the Tower.Twenty Six      The streets of Titan were in disarray.Distraught bodies and terrified faces rushed towards the Command Dome, hoping to catch a glimpse of the unfolding situation or else fleeing as far as they could.Such disorder was hard to calm or control, but the Titanese Guard could be seen all over, sweeping through the cities and doing all they could to keep unrest to a minimum.At least until they discovered what was really going on.The two generals sat in the back of a slow moving ground vehicle, caught up in one of the pockets of confused but curious city dwellers, as they made their way through.Ruben watched Mauldeth occupy himself by rolling the tip of his staff around in his hand, tapping the bottom on the floor of the vehicle.Mauldeths left leg had been damaged several years back in a ruinous clash with a mob of Proximan mercenaries, and despite the possibility of near perfect prostheses, the stubborn general wouldnt have it.It simply meant that now they couldnt cross the city by foot, and time was fast running out.Have we contact with Lady Pinzn yet?Ruben asked.Mauldeth glanced up, shook his head.You do realise, he said, that Im aware of yours and Maxims private discussions?Mauldeths eyes narrowed.And are you aware of what they concern?No.But given the present circumstance I think it would be sensible to inform me, dont you think?Perhaps, he said, lip twitching.You know, Ruben, I was always amazed at your ability to observe the moral plateau and claim the sensible stance whenever it suited you, but turn your back on the rules if it took your fancy.Life isnt always black and gold, Slimar.You should know that.The swarthy general shrugged his shoulders and looked out into the streets.The great structure of the Command Dome was in sight.Ruben looked out and considered checking on his nieces.He sincerely regretted how his discussion with Anna had gone that morning, and he prayed she was still in her room and soon to be on her way to safety.He placed his comm away and forced himself to dismiss the worry.Now more than ever he had to focus on the task at hand.The ground vehicle stopped.Both clambered out and pushed through the gathering crowd.They bypassed the security line holding back anyone from entering the Dome, and entered to witness a dozen bodies filling the floor, saturating it in stomach turning puddles of iridescent blood.Whoever did this will pay dearly!Mauldeth growled.Ruben took out his coilbolt.Yes, they will.Noise from the sirens and the crowd soon subsided.The levels were deserted, and they quietly made their way higher.Lady Pinzns office was located on the sixtieth level.On the way, the tiled floor and clear white walls were again stained with the blood of battle.How many had attacked, Ruben could not guess.Their footprints now trailed a shimmering crimson path behind them, but their aged stomachs had tackled sorer sights.Maxim Pinzns door was shut when they reached it.They said unarmed, Mauldeth reminded him.Ruben nodded, deactivated his weapon, and placed it upon the floor.Slimar Mauldeth opened the door and entered first.The office within was so unnervingly dark they could only see through the glow from the nearby buildings.But as their eyes adjusted to the black what they saw caused them to freeze.Surrounded by silence, Ruben could not only hear his own heart beat, but that of his fellow generals as they both stared, painfully, at a lifeless body laid peacefully upon the thick wooden desk.She lay on her back with her hands clasped and resting on her middle.My ...My lady, Mauldeth wept, moving towards her.What have they d ...done to you?Ruben placed a hand on his shoulder, his wary eyes having picked up on something else.Good evening, generals, came the cold voice from the party.Whatever happens here tonight, Mauldeth said, retribution will find you.Maxim Pinzn has betrayed her people, the shadowed man said.Her retribution is lay before you.What did you do?We injected her with a nerve substance.Quite deadly.Ruben focused and quickly became aware of several figures hidden within the shadows.Dont move, he whispered to Mauldeth.The same one I administered to your old Istron this morning ...No!Ruben cried, charging forwards.Unarmed and helpless, there was no point in fighting, but he didnt care.He threw Mauldeth off and charged towards the voice, but a form sprang from the shadowed corner and a blow struck his head, knocking him to the ground.He landed on his hip and agony filled his body.Seeing this, Mauldeth raised his hands, silent.Several figures, hooded and cloaked and wearing masks of silver metal, stepped into the shallow light.Do as they say, Mauldeth said.Ruben had no intention of dying.But neither did he intend to submit to the whims of these creatures.He scanned the room from his position on the floor, analysing each figures position, weapons, and possible weaknesses.But he could see no way out.This general speaks sense, spoke the wraith.I will not take orders from a Crilshan!Ruben spat.The blades they held made it clear who they were, and only one enemy had ever had the audacity to attempt something like this.Id listen to him if I were you, Berenguer.If you wont take our commands, do yourself a courtesy and stay silent.We dont need you to talk.Only to listen.He bunched his hands into fists.Do not speak to me of courtesy, filth!I know why youre here, and I can tell you your task is worthless.Your lord will not have a throne for long.A sudden blow struck the back of his head and he fell forward onto his knees, grunting in pain.The leader stepped forward, the only Crilshan not wearing a mask.The General noticed a thick scar stretching down one cheek, all the way to his mouth, and across his lips.Gordian, he said.I should have known ...The Crilshan behind Ruben clutched his hair and pulled his head back, exposing his neck.Gordian pulled out his own spiked blade and thrust in, the tip touching to his throat.Yes, Ruben Berenguer, I am Gordian.Servant of the High Lord Yux Dishan.Ibrahatima katha!Let the darkness run through your veins like pure, untainted blood.The blade dug into his skin.No, Mauldeth said.Theres no need to harm either of us!You agreed to speak, so speak.I represent this world as much as he does.Give your message to me.The Crilshan simply turned, amused, and said, Oh General, if you had any idea what my message is.Yours is one of death and darkness, I know that.And no such messenger will be welcomed here whilst I am a general of Titan.You and your precious cities represent deception and lies, Gordian said, and he turned to Ruben.Unfortunately you wont have time tonight to enlighten your famous Berenguer as to what youve been doing of late ...what youve been speaking of.Ruben looked to Mauldeth in panic.Was it to do with his and Maxims meetings?What were they discussing that he didnt know?What have you done?he cried.Im sorry, Mauldeth answered.If wed known ...the Dishan ...its more than that, I  Oh no!Gordian said.Im afraid youre going to take your transgressions to the grave!He pulled out a blaster, aimed it in his direction, and pulled the trigger.A black surge shattered the entire length of the windowed wall behind him; the glass plunged a sloping sixty floors.Slimar Mauldeth looked at Ruben, a single tear moving down his repentant expression, and he breathed one last word.The General understood.Erebus.Gordian kicked Mauldeth square in the chest, casting him out into the open air, where he plummeted alone to the stone far below.Though he struggled with all his might, Ruben couldnt summon the strength to fight the Crilshan holding him.Gordian turned and cried, Ha!The cripple fell like a rock!You bastard!Gordian stopped laughing.He was never important, Ruben Berenguer.But you are.I bring word from the High Lord Dishan himself.But it is not a message.It is a warning.He looked into Gordians dark eyesred and black.Nothing you say now will mean anything!Gordian ignored him, as though he had suddenly recognised the sirens which filled the city.Do it!he ordered one of the masked men, who in turn activated something fixed to his wrist.Out of the shattered window a dozen explosions filled the cities, fire burning and black smoke soaring up to the domes inner arcs.The sirens and screams were drowned out by the creatures laughter, all around the fury filled general.Gordian leaned in close.You are to end opposition and hostilities with my lord and his armies.You will recall your forces from the Systems and agree to the sovereignty of the Dishan Alliance over the Alignment ...and Titan.And if we dont?Gordians scarred lip curled.If you dont, my device will ensure you all die tonight.Twenty Seven      Anna stepped out of the shadows on the far side of the street.Jon Deloueste stood waiting.They met at the Surrogate Sunset, which cast a tender orange and ruby red glow throughout the domes, eight hundred years to the night since their home became a free world.Only, it was not as free as everyone supposed.Passage from the solitary moon was reserved for the senior council members, the super rich, and the Titanese Guard.Since she would never be any of those Anna had little to stay for.If she remained on Titan her uncle would never let her join the Guard; she would be sentenced to a life confined within the domes, unable to leave or fulfil her greatest wishes: to see space; to travel amongst the stars and glimpse upon other planets, moons, and civilizations.And if leaving meant she could hold onto Jon then leaving is what she would do.She had written a letter for her uncle and sister, but had torn it into many pieces.The goodbye she had written and torn up several times was not the one Anna wanted to say.Unsure of what parting message she wished to express, she had ultimately decided not to leave a letter behind.She was running away, and wasnt proud of it.What would a letter mean anyway, when the message was clear?Titan was no longer her home.The two ran together for several minutes through the darkening central streets before Jon took them down a quiet alley.The sound of festivities filled the surrounding area.What took you so long?Jon asked as he lifted a large sheet of canvas to reveal an electric powered motor scrambler, with space enough for two.Im sorry, she said.Upon leaving she had bumped into Anthea Godno, who, though kind hearted, was impossible to silence when she began to talk.Wed better be quick, he said.Who knows who or what well have to dodge on the way to the dock.I thought you had all this planned out, she said.He smiled and signalled for her to clamber on.She mounted the scrambler, wrapped her arms around him, and took a deep breath.The two took off down the lively streets.Anna held onto Jon tight.Even surrounded by uncertainty she felt safe with him; he would always protect her.The thrills and the intense beating of her heart, coupled with the cool air blowing through her dark tresses, held the excitement she felt within.It was a breathtaking exhilaration.They were going to do it.They were going to make a new life and do all the things they wanted to do.Unfortunately, they had only reached the connecting city when a piercing siren sounded behind.At once she considered the worst: that their leaving had been discovered and her uncles men in pursuit.Jon took them on a series of detours as the sirens became louder, lights flashing up into the inside of the dome, and they managed to pass from the central city through another, and finally toward their destination.Her old life echoed behind and the sirens gained upon them, louder and closer.The rolling sound of thunder then crashed through the Twelve Cities.Eruptions of light far above.A trail of blazing fire carried through the domes, the flames climbing higher than even the tallest buildings could reach.Jon stopped the scrambler.They looked to each other.Both wondered the same thing.Could it be possible?Was Titan under attack once more?A military convoy reeled nearby and the light from the searching vehicles startled them into rushing off.An enormous, towering building succumbed to the fires and flames and explosions within, and collapsed close by, the black smoke pursuing them as they tore past.The dock was in sight.Were nearly there!Jon cried over the furore.But Anna was already questioning their choice to leave.Titan was under attack.She wanted to go back, to Glana and her uncle and, strangely enough, Callista.Maybe we shouldnt go!she shouted.Youre joking!Jon said.This is the reason were leaving.Im going to protect you now!Theres no turning back!And he was right.The scrambler pulled away from a hovercraft passing overhead, and they burned down another alley.Anna couldnt find the breath to reply and fought to hold on tight as Jon pulled a dangerous manoeuvre to avoid yet another party of Titanese Guard on the next street.Several vehicles pulled up ahead.Jon swerved, sending the scrambler and its two passengers flying through the air.Dancing lights flickered and a burst of lightning shot towards them.* * *  The assassin Gordians words raced through Rubens mind as he stood gazing out of Maxim Pinzns office, pillars of smoke filling the sphere before him as the stench of burning turned his stomach:  If you dont, my device will ensure you all die tonight ...What device?Could he have meant Erebus?Minutes had passed since the Crilshans had fled.Many of the Titanese Guard had been killed in the encounter, and now he stood alone.His men had begun the hunt.The masked intruders would not get far.Yes, he said into his comm.Were still go.The Stellarstream must leave.Other members of the Command had attempted to stop Captain Ferrantis vessel from leaving.But they did not know the significance of this launch.The Stellarstream has my clearance to depart.As you wish, replied Captain Mendoza.Can I suggest one thing, Ruben?Go ahead.Activate the Surrogate Sun.Daylight will help us flush these vermin out.And there it hit him.That was Gordians design.No, he said.Are you sure?We  No, he repeated.The Surrogate Sun.Was it possible?Ruben?The last Titan Crilshan war, a war in which his father fought, had been waged with such ferocity, such deception, such trickery.The old tactics of terror used by the enemy were so devastating that the free worlds had almost fallen to the Dishan.If Ruben knew anything of Crilshar, and he certainly did, then he knew that the House of Dishan were great admirers of the old ways of war.And one plan in particular stood out.Ernesta!Ruben cried.Yes, sir?I want an immediate lockdown of all twelve cities!Have your teams search and evacuate key areas in the interior of the domes, starting with Central Tower.At once, General, she replied.What, may I ask, are we looking for?Years of training allowed him to contain his panic.Explosives, Captain.Enough to wipe out the entire Twelve Cities.Or more specifically ...the Surrogate Sun.Twenty Eight      Dazed and aching, Anna realised quickly that she was moving along the ground, her legs behind her, as cloaked shadows pulled her through, each with a tight grip on her arms.Down an empty back street, they dragged her out of sight of the search lights and military convoys.Jon, she said, are you all right?Im here, he grumbled.Where are you?Whats going on?Quiet!spat one of the men as they dragged her into the back entrance of a small building adjoining the alley.They threw her to the ground in the dark; the thud of Jons body landed beside.Around them a gruff, raspy voice spoke a language she recognised.It was a dark accent.It was ...Crilshan.Armata ibanakra, he said.Manaw ikri!A dim light appeared in the corner and Anna could make out three or four figures, all wearing strange masks.Who are  Quiet, girl!one said.Then he shouted, Ichita Gordian!Ichita Gordian!Replies from the adjoining room.Dont move, Jon whispered.The Crilshans closest to them looked to each other, and one pulled out a blade.Dont hurt us!Jon said.Why?Who are you?The raspy voice echoed around the room.I am Jon Deloueste.And this is the niece of none other than General Berenguer!Jon, no!Anna cried.Big mistake.The Crilshan approached her, clutched her face firmly.He stunk of sweat and dirt.Excellent!he cried, backing away and clapping his gloved hands together.We have them both!What?she said.Both?Anna!rolled a cry amid a tumult of stifled tears as Glana Berenguer was lugged from the adjoining room and thrown to the ground, where she crawled into her big sisters arms.Glana!How did they get you?They were waiting ...at home ...they killed the guard, and ...Quiet!the Crilshan snarled.The room went silent.
