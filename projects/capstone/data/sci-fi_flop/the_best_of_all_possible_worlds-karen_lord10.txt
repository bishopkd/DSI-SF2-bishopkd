But what do you do?Hes soproper.I gave her an exasperated look.It was no good trying to tell Gilda that some people didnt divulge such intimate details, because she always did whether you wanted to hear it or not and expected the same of her friends.Up till now, Id been mercifully exempt by virtue of a boring lifestyle.Eventually I shrugged.We hold hands, I confessed, lowering my voice.Thats all?she said in enormous disappointment.Well, its more complicated than that.A sort of telepathy thing.Oh, and sometimes we sleep together.I should indulge my vengeful streak more often.I timed it perfectly so that she actually inhaled her beverage in shock.You do what?she hissed as soon as she got her airway clear.I relented.Oh, come on, Gilda.Clothes on, adjacent cots, same shelter.Thats all.He told me I help him sleep.It was true.The way the team had been paired up and the fact that Qeturah had her own shelter meant that Id usually had a smaller shelter to myself.My dreams had never completely untangled from Dllenahkhs thoughts, both waking and dreaming, after the memory reset thing, and he found that I was at least as good as an hours prior meditation for stopping the falling nightmare before it got out of hand.He explained to me that proximity would facilitate the effect and quite calmly asked if he could come discreetly to my shelter for a few hours sleep from time to time.I casually said yes, and it was literally an hour later that I experienced a jaw drop moment, suddenly realizing what I had agreed to.It didnt take Gilda that long.She slowly shook her head and looked at me as if seeing me for the first time.Man.Still waters.Her gaze flickered, focusing behind me, the slightly guilty expression betraying that it was Dllenahkh approaching.I turned and smiled at him.Councillor?Ms.Delarua, he replied, pausing to nod courteously to Gilda.A moment of your time, if I may.I followed Dllenahkh a few steps away to a clear space, which, as the reception was well attended, meant stepping onto one of the balcony niches of the reception hall.Some journalist snagged a holo of us in conversation, standing framed in the niche with the twilight colored sky filling the French window behind us.I never even noticed when she took it, but theres a copy of that holo on my desk now.I have a suggestion for you, he began.Your residence in Tlaxce City is no longer appropriately sited for the work you will be doing.My own career changes have rendered the location of my previous lodgings less than optimal.I have, however, been recommended for ownership of a homestead close to transport links to both Tlaxce City and the Local Council Hall.Of course, it is too much for me to handle by myself, but I have in mind an arrangement which may serve as a model for other homesteads in the future.Dr.Mar and Lanuri plan to marry next month.I believe you already know that Nasiha and Tarik will stay on Cygnus Beta for a period of time.Two of my colleagues from the Council offices, Istevel and Kamir, have asked to transfer from government work to homesteading until they are assigned partners by the Ministry, and Joral has requested the same.Would you care to join us?Pardon?I had been so busy cataloging the names and the news that the invitation, tacked on like an afterthought, at first made no sense.Would you like to live with us on the homestead?This would greatly facilitate your consultancy work with Commander Nasiha.I spurred my whirling mind to stop for a moment and think clearly.This homestead, it sounds pretty sizable to be able to support so many people.It is.I pondered.Nasiha, Joral, Tarik, Freydaquite a lot of my favorite people in one place.It sounded pretty cool, especially if the homestead were big enough for a balance of independence and interdependence.I shook my head, laughing inwardly at myself.Working with Sadiri, living with Sadiri, speaking Sadiri more often than notit seemed that in my own life the Sadiri had won the culture wars quite handily.And then, of course, there was Dllenahkh himself.I freely confessed to myself in that moment that he was someone I didnt want to say good bye to, not ever.It seems to be an efficient arrangement, I decided, looking up at him with a smile.Yes.Thank you, Dllenahkh.Even after I said yes to Dllenahkhs offer to live on his homestead, I had plenty of opportunity to ponder the decision anew.Some days later, as Gilda helped me pack up the last bits of my City life, she filled me in on what people were saying.Some felt Dllenahkh was besotted with me even though I was quite clearly not taSadiri and therefore completely unsuitable as a spouse; others believed I was besotted with him and therefore so desperate to stay near him that I was willing to molder away on a homestead.Some thought he was using me to project the image of a proper Sadiri family man, homesteader, and government representative; others were convinced I was using him to further my own private sector career and gradually rehabilitate myself in the government and the scientific community.Finally, one rumor all but accused us of conducting an elaborate xenofetish experiment that would only end in tears.To the general concerns, I could have added several more.Was he attached to me because of the mission experience?Did that mental connection that I couldnt speak about and my helping him with his nightmares constitute some kind of undue influence?If so, would the influence fade as soon as he was once more in a full Sadiri community with all the telepathic support that entailed?Oh, shut up, Gilda, I said irritably.Youd think I was going to marry the man, with all that talk.She looked hurt, but before she could complain, there was a chime at the front door, and I gladly went to answer it.Excuse me.Ms.Grace Delarua?It was a government courier with one of those buff envelopes that had so often been the bane of my life.They tended to represent upheaval at the best and misery at the worst.I felt a pang of fear.Whats this?I said, taking it unwillingly.Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance.Sign here, please.I signed for it and closed the door, relieved but confused.Family Planning?said Gilda with an arched brow.I registered.It was a whim, I said.I had indeed registered, about three months back when we were in a fairly well connected town.Nasiha had complimented my meditation progress that day, and Dllenahkh had also made some very favorable remarks concerning a report Id produced in both Sadiri and Standard.For some reason, the resulting heady rush of pride had led me to do all manner of things to prove to myself that I was definitely one hundred percent fine in all areas of my life.Then why dont they just contact you via comm or handheld?Open it!she demanded.Curiosity overcame prudence, and I opened it in her presence, laying the official document flat on the dining table.We stared at it.She swore softly, then laughed out loud.I said nothing.Well?she pressed.I put it back in the envelope.Come on, lets finish packing.I need to get down to the homestead as soon as possible.Even with nav and autopilot, the groundcar made it down to the homestead within about two hours, which was not long enough for my blood to cool.After the car passed the main gates but well before it reached the residences, I saw something in a field that made me put on the brakes.It was the first time Id seen them, but it was easy to guess what they were: Sadiri dogs.There were three of them, slightly bigger and thicker bodied than the wild savanna dog, still adapted for a heavier gravity than ours.It was evident in the way they leaped and raced, testing their new strength and speed.Three men were with them, at times running alongside them, at times standing still and observing closely.I thought they were playing with them, and then I realized they were training themwithout leash, whip, or biscuit.There was also a small group of horses fenced off in a paddock at one end of the field.As I watched them, one of the men put his dog to stay and walked toward the paddock.The horses moved skittishly away, but one of them paused and sidled to the fence, quite possibly coaxed by some silent encouragement.The man gently put a hand to the horses shoulder and began stroking its nose reassuringly.The horse was calm and content, but suddenly the dog came trotting forward, making the horse startle, throw up its head, and scamper off.Unfortunately, the would be horse whisperer was too close and got a faceful of hard horse skull that rocked him off his feet and onto his backside.The dog nuzzled him solicitously while his two colleagues unhelpfully burst out in loud laughter.Good day.You are Ms.Grace Delarua?A young man peered into the passenger window of the car, leaning forward with a diffident curiosity that reminded me of Joral.He was dressed for rough, dusty work in trousers and shirt made of thick cotton twill.A canvas bag rode over his shoulder, clinking occasionally as he moved.I turned off the humming engine of the groundcar, surprised that I had not heard anyone approaching.Yes, I am.Good day.He bowed politely in greeting.I am Kamir.I see you have noticed the animal trainers at work.Those are our new dogs, a small stock that we will eventually crossbreed with the local savanna dogs.There was both pride and excitement in his voice.I thought they were restricted to New Sadira, I said.Policies have changed.Hybridization is popular now.His words sounded slightly teasing to my sensitive ears.I narrowed my eyes at him.Where is Dllenahkh?He straightened and pointed down the road.Approximately five hundred meters farther along the road, working at the smithy with Istevel.Thank you, I said, making an effort at courtesy as I restarted the car.Enjoy the rest of your day.The smithy was easy to find, a long, low building with the distinctive dish shaped structure of a solar forge looming over it.Broad double doors stood half open to the breeze, showing two figures within.One man was holding something in a pair of tongs, moving it slowly back and forth under a beam of concentrated sunlight.Another man stood nearby, seemingly content to merely examine his colleagues technique.Their reflective face shields reminded me of Sayrs helmet, but everything else was low impact, easy maintenance technology that emphasized self sufficiency.I hesitated.Theres something very poetic and pastoral about men working at a forgealbeit a solar forgeand on another day I would have appreciated the scene, but I reminded myself that there were more important matters to be dealt with.I turned off the car, grabbed the envelope, and made for the two smiths.I nodded to the working smith first, then focused my attention on the other.You are the most indirect man I have ever met, I snapped.Dllenahkh pushed up the visor of his face shield and squinted at me.I do not understand.I impatiently waved the official document at him.Ah.He nodded to Istevel, stripped off his fireproof gloves, took off his face shield, and approached me cautiously.Perhaps we should go elsewhere to discuss this.We walked about a hundred meters away to where the ground sloped under the shade of a few small trees.I sat down, carefully looking straight ahead.There was a faint rustle of leaf and dried grass as Dllenahkh seated himself beside me.May I?he asked, and took the document from my hand.I sneaked a look at him.Taking off the face shield had ruffled his hair into a slightly untidy tumble of sun lightened brown locks.His skin had darkened after the years break from office work.With a start, I realized that he now looked far more Cygnian than Sadiri.He examined the document.The Ministry is informing you that my application to be registered as your life partner has been approved.Our signatures and the signature of a witness are all that is needed to complete the process.I know that.I sounded a little frantic, so I made myself repeat the words calmly.I know that.But how is this possible?The only way I could get this kind of document is if you registered before me and put me down as your sole preference.And at the very least I should have received some prior notification My voice faded.I remembered a time when any government correspondence appearing on my handheld had been rapidly consigned to the bin after a cursory look.Id received a lot of irrelevant notices in the days when the left hand of Central Government was still processing my resignation and hadnt bothered to inform the right hand.Dllenahkh merely blinked once as he watched my face change, but the amount of amusement he managed to convey was astonishing.I am only surprised that they took so long.I understand that the testing is highly intensive, consisting of genetic profiling, psychiatric assessments, and financial auditing.However, due to the nature of our work, all of the data was readily available.Youbooked me in advance?I was stunned.He looked at my expression, parted his lips to speak, and paused.Go on, I said resignedly.You can tell me anything; you know that.I have certain responsibilities, he began tentatively, a man feeling his way on unexpectedly treacherous ground.Not only as a councillor of the settlement but also as a Sadiri, one of few remaining.I turned toward him slightly, listening.Thus, it is extremely important that my actions are beneficial not only to myself but to the Sadiri people as a whole.Understood, I replied.He looked at me closely.I have tried to set an example.Careful and deliberate choice of a spouse, with objective assessment by a qualified, neutral third party, is precisely what the young Sadiri of this community need to see.Wellcongratulations, I said awkwardly.It was difficult to be angry at him yet impossible to be pleased about the situation.He sighed.I do not know how to do this.I know I have displeased you in some way, but I am unable to ascertain how.I spoke honestly if impulsively.I suppose its no secret that Im fond of you, Dllenahkh, but whether that matters to you at all, I justngh!In a swift move that shocked me speechless, he set his hand behind my head and put his face into the side of my neck.He left the imprint of his teeth there, then soothed the skin with the tip of his tongue.It was a fraction more than a kiss and a little short of a marking.His hair brushed the lashes at the corner of my eye; there was the slight abrasion of his shadowed jaw against my cheek.He was tender and brutal, and I had no defense against him.Mmm, I said, completely incoherent.I am relieved to hear, he whispered under my ear, that you are fond of me.It matters to me a great deal.Dont tell me you didnt know it, I said shakily.He rested his forehead against mine and spoke temptingly near my mouth.It would not have been right to tell you before you told yourself.I might have listened, I protested weakly, focusing with difficulty on his lips and wondering if he could be slowly trained to find mouth to mouth kissing acceptableenjoyable, even.He drew back and gazed at me.You know I will not give you emotional protestations, he said, and his eyes seemed troubled.Then tell me what you will give me, I said.Trust.Companionship.His eyelids lowered, and his voice grew husky.Children, if you wish.Will you consent to be my wife?I cannot imagine being better suited to any other person.Me?I laughed softly.Undisciplined, emotional me?Id rather not do without you, but I wont be a burden to you, and I cant change my nature.Nor I, he replied, but if the past two years are any indication, we have had some success at meeting each other halfway.Thenyes.His gaze grew tender.I believe the arrangement will be mutually Satisfactory, I interrupted.Beneficial, infuriating, passionateIm sorry, did I hit a sensitive spot there?I had grown courageous enough to touch him, and my hands light passage over his side appeared to be causing him some problems if the hitch in his breathing was any indication.There is something you must know before we proceed, he said, capturing my hand.I am aware that many Ntshune societies and a few Cygnian ones practice short term monogamy.This is not the Sadiri way.Dont worry; its not the Cygnian homesteader way either, I said.And they wouldnt have matched us if we didnt agree on that.I know.But, Grace, what I am asking is this: Do you want a Cygnian marriage or a Sadiri marriage?I silently questioned him with a puzzled frown.He let go of my hand and looked into the distance as he tried to explain.We have a need to form a meaningful telepathic bond with something or someone.There is a Sadiri saying: a man with a mindship is half immortal, but a man without a wife is half alive.Some men can overcome this need by using meditation techniques, but never before have so many men faced a future without hope of marriage.They had no choice but to send us away from New Sadira.There were terrible incidentsmen fighting over women, assaulting women, harming themselves, even threatening mass suicide.Our society was breaking down.I saw such thingsthings I still cannot speak of.He gripped his wrist, a sign of distress I knew too well.Then dont speak of them, I hushed him.Not yet.Not till youre ready.Never, if it comes to that.He spoke very quietly, still not looking at me.I have relied on meditation for many years, and I can continue to do so for many more, but I ask you now: Will you bond with me?I leaned against him, feeling the tension in his body subside.I said yes, and Ill say it again.You know I trust you.He took my hand and pressed it to his cheek.I closed my eyes and felt a surge of energy pushing from him to me and back again, very like the warmth and reassurance of a rocking hug.At last, calmed and consoled, we moved away from each other.He returned the document to its envelope and handed it to me.We will speak more on this later, after you have rested and settled in.He left to return to the smithy.I lay back on the grass for a few minutes, mind blown.La, sir, this is so very sudden!And yetit wasnt, was it?Wed already moved beyond the baseline Sadiri courting rituals identified by Freyda.I knew we had been heading toward a declaration of sorts.I suppose I thought that the declaration would be multistage, perhaps an I love you followed by a Do you love me?rather than a Here, sign this document thatll say were married.But dithering wasnt a Sadiri habit, and neither were I love yous.I heaved a huge sigh and sat up straight.I needed a drink.By happy chance, so did Freyda.First I bullied her into helping me get my stuff into my rooms, and then we took a well deserved break in her sitting room.She had already completed her own move in, and as I complimented her taste, she looked around at the decor and furniture with contentment.Im so glad Lanuri went along with my plan to move early and get things organized before our wedding, she said.I made it sound as if it was the obvious thing for me to do now that theres a new biotechnician in place and Im free to start my book, but I think he knows my real motive.And whats that?I asked, making myself comfortable against the cushions as she poured the wine.Im hiding, she confessed in a semiwhisper.From Zhera.I rolled the name through my brain a few times.Isnt she one of the female elders who arrived recently?She seems to be the head of them, and shes terrifying.I thought they were supposed to be cuddly grandma and auntie surrogates for the settlements young men.She seems to think its her job to whip all the new wives and fiances into shape.I saw her systematically interviewing a group of them at the Council Hall offices.Some came out in tears.Well, as long as she doesnt second guess the Ministry, I said.I suppose she wants to stamp her authority on the community from the start.Oh, and speaking of fiances Freyda was overjoyed at my news but not in the least surprised.Finally!Did you sign it?I grinned, feeling a bit bashful but very pleased at her reaction.Well, not there on the spot, naturally, but I will.After you guys.Dont want to steal your thunder and all.She waved a hand dismissively.You and Dllenahkh were inevitable.Lanuris considered you all but bonded for ages.Hmm.So has Nasiha, I said wryly, taking a sip of wine.Are Sadiri suitors too subtle for us, do you think?I think its the lack of drama.Once theyve got things figured out, they simply go forward without making a fuss.I sat still for a while, heedlessly letting the chilled wineglass warm in my hands and drip condensation onto my lap.I remembered when I first read Dllenahkhs thoughts in my dreams.He had been trying, I think, to figure out how to signal his desire to move from friends to something more.I wondered if that had been when hed booked me.Cheeky of him to assume Id say yesand yet he knew my mind so well that hed probably been right to think in terms of when rather than if.Well, then, said Freyda, eyes gleaming wickedly over the rim of her glass, now that were in the same boat, lets talk about how much of our privacy were willing to give up.What?I asked, confused.She gave me a worried look.Hasnt Dllenahkh spoken to you about that?My God, Delarua, dont you know?You mean the telepathic bond thing?I said, clueing in at last.Yes, I mean the telepathic bond thing, Freyda said in amazement at my unfazed attitude.Yes, of course I know about it.Why are you looking so worried?Freyda set down her glass and leaned forward.Are you sure he told you everything about it?Yes, I said, beginning to grow irritated.He said Sadiri men have a need to form meaningful telepathic bonds.He certainly didnt give me the impression that meant having no private thoughts whatsoever.I realized even as I spoke that he had said we will speak more on this later, but I was too embarrassed to admit to that now.Well, there is some choice about how deep the bond goes, but considering what Dllenahkhs wife did to him I spewed a mouthful of wine half through my nose and half through my mouth.Im sure it was as unpleasant to observe as it was to experience.His wife?I wheezed.Oh, shit, said Freyda.She grabbed a double handful of napkins from the table and pressed them on me.I cleaned myself up, glaring at her, but she avoided my eyes as she babbled, Im so sorry.II think Ill let Dllenahkh tell you about that.No, youre going to tell me.Now, I said grimly.She hesitated, but then she folded her hands together and looked at me with an earnest expression of sympathy and concern.You know most of them have marriages arranged for them when theyre fairly young, right?I grew impatient.Yes, of course.But he never mentioned a wife.She died in the disaster, like so many others.But even before that, they were separated.Separated?What does that mean for Sadiri?I demanded.He said they didnt do temporary monogamy.They dont, Freyda confirmed.Thats why it was such a big deal when the marriage and the bond were dissolved.I breathed out slowly.Oh.Oh, poor Dllenahkh.So he was divorced is what youre telling me.Freyda looked uncomfortable.There was a bit more to it than that.You see, bonded Sadiri men can be possessivevery possessive.Dllenahkh found out his wife was unfaithful to him.He beat the other man senseless.What?I gaped at her in disbelief.She had to be making it up.It sounded like a bad, sordid holovid.Broke his jaw, Freyda said bluntly.He was never charged for it.The Sadiri have different rules for a crime of passion.Its treated like a kind of temporary insanity.When he came to his senses, he told her he was releasing her from their bond.Oh, I said, unable to find words.Im sorry Im telling you this.Obviously he doesnt like to talk about it, and ordinarily I wouldnt have found out except that Lanuri told me.I think he was trying to be completely honest with me so I could objectively assess the pros and cons of a close bond.She hung her head and glared at her wineglass.It didnt work.Im even less objective about it now.Its going to be lots of fun trying to look him in the eye now that I know this, I muttered.Why didnt he tell me?Its not an easy thing to tell, she reasoned.Please, please dont let on that I told you.I feel terrible about this.Ill pretend I never heard a thing, I said miserably.Pretense did work for a little while.There was so much to do in those early days on the homestead that there was no time to revisit the bonding issue with Dllenahkh.That was my excuse, a good excuse and an honest one, but eventually fate took matters out of my hands.Dllenahkh continued to train others in the mental disciplines, and there was a meditation hall on the homestead for that purpose.I didnt use it myself.I could meditate just fine in my own room, and there was also a meditation room in the main house.But I did pass by it on occasion, and once I was walking with Freyda when we heard the sound of a voice raised in anger.We exchanged puzzled looks, then naturally drifted closer to listen to what was going on.withhold more than you teach!You are only concerned about your own status and power in this community.I withhold nothing, Dllenahkhs voice returned calmly.I can only say that reliance on meditation alone is inadvisable.And yet you managed for decades.You succeeded.Why not another?It was never intended as a permanent solution to solitude, as you are attempting to make it.The Ministry can help you select an appropriate spouse, and there are also chemical suppressants available to ease the pain of your loss.I recommend that you choose some remedy, and quickly.There was a crash, and Freyda and I instinctively grabbed each other and cowered.It was a very good thing we hadnt been standing right in front of the window or we would have been hit by the heavy wooden bench that came through.We did get covered in slivers of glass.Then we heard people scuffling inside the hall.Peeking through the broken shutters, we saw the beginnings of a fight.Dllenahkh was trying to restrain rather than injure, but his student seemed quite serious about doing some harm.The other students hovered uncertainly, mainly getting themselves and the furniture out of the way but otherwise looking on anxiously, waiting to be told what to do.I instinctively surged forward, but Freyda caught hold of me.Are you mad?she demanded.You cant go in there!She was right.Dllenahkh ducked a blow, and his antagonists fist left a sizable crack in the paneling of the wall.With a firm hold and a quick pivot, Dllenahkh brought him down to the wooden floor with a booming crash.Two students quickly piled on, keeping him pinned with their weight, while Dllenahkh put one hand to his forehead and the other around his neck, squeezing with careful timing until he slumped into unconsciousness.Take him to the main house, he ordered, not even out of breath.Class is dismissed for today.Then he looked at the ruined window and saw us.His eyes went wide.Are you hurt?No, I said, brushing a tiny smear of blood from my wrist.He saw it and frowned.Honestly, were fine, Freyda insisted.Go deal withwhatever it is you have to deal with.Well get this cleaned up.He looked like he wanted to say more, but instead he nodded, still frowning, and followed his students out of the hall.Freyda turned to me, and her face changed.Are you sure youre all right?I didnt know what to answer.Id accepted Sadiri strength in a be a dear and shift the groundcar out of this trench for me kind of way, but it was the first time I had seen a Sadiri in full, uncontrolled rage.Freydas story came back to my mind with a new vividness, as did Dllenahkhs somber reminiscences about how the men had behaved after the disaster.Worse yet, I had been willing to view Dllenahkhs account of events in the context of the severe trauma that all Sadiri had experienced, knowing too well how their telepathy made them susceptible to collective anger and pain.But what of Dllenahkhs own loss of control, years and years before, in a sane and stable society where women were not a scarce commodity?It was appalling to contemplate.Freyda guessed at the train of my thoughts and began to babble apologies again.Ill be okay, I said.Really.Lets go inside and get this glass out of our hair.That night, I dreamed of elephants stampeding.I woke up suddenly in the dark, disoriented at first, then feelingknowingthat something wasnt right.I put on a robe and went barefoot up the stairs to the roof terrace.It was a clear, starry night but cool enough that the wooden flooring was already drenched with dew.A shadowy figure was lying atop the broad wall: Dllenahkh, not yet dressed for bed, wide awake and staring up at the sky with no regard for the four meter drop below.I walked right up to him and looked down, frowning.Why are you still up?I asked him.His eyes softened; he blinked, and some of the tension left his face.Still, he did not look at me but kept his gaze on the stars.I did not want to disturb you, he answered.I knew he had some inkling of my nightmare.I knew he had sensed fear and tension and all manner of things that I had never associated with him before.But this was Dllenahkh.He would never push me for explanations, only wait with patience and openness until I was ready to come to him.I decided to be blunt.What I saw today scared me.You see, someone told mequite by accidentabout your first marriage.There was silence for a while.Then he began to speak slowly, choosing his words with care.I believe I was at fault.I took our mental bond for granted and was often not physically present.In addition to my career, I was very much focused on my studies of the mind, an interest that my wife did not share.One day, during a meditation session, I attainednoglimpsed the state that our mindship pilots regularly experience.Before that day, I had viewed their vocation as a lofty but lonely endeavor.Afterward, I understood why they are called half immortal.ItI cannot describe it, what it felt like, how it changed me.I was a man struck by lightninga benign, sentient lightning.I wrote poetry.I laughed.I told every pilot I met, and they smiled indulgently and said what a pity it was that I was not free to be bonded to my own mindship.I could not change my life.Becoming a pilot would have meant making a different decision when I came of age, and there had been no mindship pilots in my line to inspire me to choose that path.I had to content myself with what I had, and yet I could not let go of what I had seen.I studied further and became advanced in meditation theory and practice.I considered this an admirable endeavor.She took it as evidence that I was arranging my life to exclude her.She could have told me that she wished to marry another.I would not have welcomed it, but I would never have stood in her way.Instead, she purposely hid it from me, arranged for me to discover them together, and stepped back to view the result.Oh, I breathed.Oh, cruel.Yes, as cruel as she believed I had been to her.In the years after our separation, I immersed myself in even deeper study of the disciplines, looking for ways to ensure that such a thing could never happen to me again.In spite of all that had occurred, I still yearned for a bond with another human mind, but if it had not been for the destruction of Sadira, I might have easily persuaded myself to become a pilot.Why didnt you tell me all this, Dllenahkh?I said faintly.His mouth tensed.I should have.I would have in time.There was a small pause, and then he admitted, I feared losing you.Well, Im here now, I pointed out.He turned his head to look at me then.You are.I do not understand why.Think, Dllenahkh, I chided him.Clearly something about you convinces me that you are the best possible choice.And what is that?he asked very softly.I sighed.So many things, but the first on my list right now is that I do believe you love me.I know you are capable of living without that emotion, but you choose not to.I would not classify love as an emotion, Grace.That startled me.Really?Certainly it comes attended by various physical reactions which manifest as emotions, but it is one of the drives.Oh, I said.Like hunger, or wanting to procreate, or the desire to protect ones offspring.Yes.I have identified you as the most appropriate mate, probably through an unconscious assessment of pheromones, mental capacity, and, of course, social compatibility.So, youre saying you like how I smell, you like how I think, and you like to hang out with me?I was amused but genuinely warmed at such a unique declaration of love.He sat up suddenly and turned to face me, swinging his feet down to the floor so quickly that I was half afraid hed go over the edge.What is love to you, Grace?There was an intensity to his gaze that made the blood rush to my face.I began to stammer something, then fell silent.Breathing quickly, I took hold of his hand, bringing it to my cheek.You tell me, I whispered.He drew me into his arms and into his mind.He saw how I valued his selflessness and trusted his integrity even when he exasperated me by being inflexible.I showed him my admiration for his physical strength, intelligence, and psionic abilities and the gentleness that complemented all those qualities.I even allowed him to see that I had found him physically attractive from the moment we first met.So, he said lightly, and I knew he was teasing me because he was somewhat shaken.You believe that I possess certain characteristics that you would like to be passed on, via genetic transfer and mentoring, to your children.I began to laugh.I am surprised at the strength of your appreciation for my shoulders, he continued, still teasing, still holding me close, fitting me neatly between his knees.Theyre nice and broad, I said, running my hands over them to emphasize my point.Nor was I previously aware that you had any special regard for my eyes.Deep, dark, and intense.They make you look almost Ntshune, I murmured, cuddling closer as his hands stroked my back.I apologize for not being honest with you earlier, he said, his voice low and soft so I could feel it rumbling in his chest.And Im sorry for even dreaming that youd ever hurt me.I wont abandon you, Dllenahkh.Invincible or vulnerable, whatever state youre in, youre stuck with me.He tightened his arms around me.A fact that gives me great satisfaction.He sighed as he slowly brushed his nose up the side of my neck and breathed heat under my ear.Theres justone thing, I said hoarsely, trying not to become completely distracted.You mentioned pheromones.Theres another way to assess chemistry.Taste and smell are, as you know, closely linked.He pulled back slightly and gave me a wary look.I believe you are trying to entice me to attempt kissing.Maybe, I said casually.Just one?Please?He gave a gentle, tolerant smile and closed his eyes.I am in your hands.I didnt want to shock him or put him off, so I started with small, chaste kisses pressed firmly to his jaw.Then I quickly, lightly touched my lips to his mouth, very much a drive by kiss, and paused to assess his reaction.His hands twitched on my back, but he did not pull away.Again, he said softly.I am beginning to see the value of the practice.I obeyed, this time allowing a tiny bit of tingling gold to breathe from my lips to his, just as he had taught me to do from palm to palm.He leaned in to capture it with an appreciative murmur, added a little more of his own, and kissed it back to me.The physical mechanics were still inexpert, but his energy curled in boldly and unraveled right down to my toes, making me gasp at the sensation.I am not averse to including this option in our repertoire, he mused.But I clearly require more practice.Again, please.Reader, I married him.Aboutoh, three times, I think.First there was the signing of the Ministry document, which we did on our homestead with Qeturah as witness and a few close friends around.Then my semilapsed Bahai mother insisted on a Bahai wedding ceremony.I warned her that I was well past the age laid down by the Ministry for mandatory parental permission, but to my surprise and secret pleasure, Dllenahkh was quite taken with the idea.We held it on the banks of Tlaxce Lake, with more of our City friends in attendance and even a few from the other provinces.Dllenahkh presented my mother with the nonobligatory bride price of a quantity of pure gold, which hed had fashioned into the shape of a hummingbird.She loved it.She told me, Of course Im leaving it to you in my will, but its such a nice gesture.It shows he really treasures you.The third time was a secret.We went to the forest uplands, to a certain temple, and there we were bonded by law, by religion, and by mind in a silent ceremony with a few physically attending and hundreds more mentally present.I dont want to say too much about that, sorry.Not secret but far too close to my heart, I think.I get a bit teary just remembering it.Deep breath!Moving on!We did have one dramatic event, something rather akin to a speak now or forever hold your peace moment.I should have guessed that in time, what with all the bride interviews, the infamous Zhera would have come across a woman from the temple and extracted her secrets using nothing but the sheer force of her presence.Or, to speak more charitably, they had likely recognized her worth and extended an invitation to her.Whatever the reason, she showed up at the end of our wedding ceremony, richly robed and closely attended by two young nuns as if she already owned the place.Her glare called to mind the evil fairy who gets vexed at being left out of the royal christening and decides to lay down a curse that will afflict not only the poor innocent babe but the entire kingdom as well.So, Dllenahkh, thou hast bonded again.She spoke a very old and stylized form of Sadiri that hinted at too many hours spent reciting rituals with subordinates and too few minutes engaged in normal conversation with peers.I have, Zhera, he replied courteously but briefly.Thy choice of spouse seemsunwise.I seethed quietly but said nothing.She might think herself qualified to sit in judgment over the young ones of the settlement, but as a grown woman I wasnt going to put up with any nonsense.While I struggled to keep my cool, Dllenahkh calmly defended himself.I would not call it unwise to marry a woman who is capable of strong euphoric projection.Still striving for control but now for an entirely different reason, I wondered how he managed to sound so bland and yet so insinuating.Zhera, to my continuing astonishment, did not frown or show any kind of disapproval.Her stern look gentled to one of mild amusement, and the straight line of her mouth relaxed.Irreverent youth!I did not think to live to see thee considered an elder of our people, but thou hast done well.Child!That last was addressed to me.I tried not to flinch.Maam?He is a good man, a dependable man, but when he tends to frivolity, and she glared at Dllenahkh, as he has in the past, thou must not encourage him.Yes, maam.I mean, no, maam.Whatever you say, maam, I gasped, not so much overwhelmed by her command as utterly flabbergasted at the sudden realization that he had baited her and she was teasing him.When she swept out again, I turned to him, eyebrows raised in amazement.Friend of yours?He smiled slightly.It is difficult to ascertain what that word means to Zhera.To me, she is a teacher of note from whom I learned much about the philosophy and science of the mind.To her, I am still the young acolyte who was sufficiently foolhardy to answer back once.She has never allowed me to forget it.Why did you tell her about the euphoric projection?I complained.That was embarrassing.He raised an eyebrow.Was the statement inaccurate?Well, strictly speaking, no, but you certainly gave the impression that you had already experienced such a thingconjugally.He pondered for a while.I see.Perhaps not an untruth but certainly a misleading statement.I believe there is only one remedy.I looked at him in trepidation, wondering if he was going to speak up and make another public announcement about my alleged abilities.We must investigate thoroughly the potential truth of this statement.Um, I said, because although the words were quite innocently delivered, the look he was giving me was making my knees weak.Yes.That would be entirely appropriate.Might I recommend that we retire to our assigned chamber?The shielding built into the walls will ensure that no acoustic or mental noise will get inor out.I was quite sure at this point that my bosom was heaving in maidenly confusion.Um, that sounds lovely.He looked at me curiously and rested a finger lightly against the throbbing pulse in my throat.You are agitated, he said with grave interest.You are amused at my agitation, I countered.He inclined his head, acknowledging the touch.I am experiencing a measure of excitement combined with increasing pleasure, which is perhaps manifesting as an expression of amusement.It was the first time he had ever used the scales to describe his emotions.I love it when you talk dirty, I whispered, and sealed the moment with a kiss.Now It was well before dawn, and Delarua was scrambling around in semidarkness, wrestling with her clothes and tripping over her own boots.Already dressed, Dllenahkh observed her from his seat at the one clear corner of the bed.Hurry.Well be late.As usual, she caught the meaning rather than the syntax.In a minute!As usual, he listened to the undertone of apology rather than the tone of frustration.He glanced away to signal his patience and saw her handheld in the middle of the bed.He did not intend to read it, but his attention was caught by the title: The Homestead Years.Being the second volume of the draft memoirs of Grace Delarua (not famous yet though not through lack of trying, but hey, theres still time).Dont look!She yanked it out of his line of sight and stuffed it in her satchel.My apologies, he said.He doubted it contained anything that would surprise him, but with Delarua close bonding meant games of fake privacy and pretended ignorance.He found it oddly endearing.Ready, she said breathlessly at last.But I still dont see why we cant go in the car.The car has nav installed, he hinted with a raised eyebrow.We neither need nor want nav where were going.She raised an eyebrow in turn, intrigued.Lead the way, then.By the time they got the horses saddled up, a faint dawn light was beginning to glow.A few minutes easy walk was sufficient to take them out from under the trees at the heart of the homestead, through the outer pastures, and onto the main road.They journeyed for a while along their own boundary line in a silence that was companionable and more.Delarua spoke only once.Were going down to the sea.Yes, he answered aloud.She laughed.It was an adventure to her, an adventure and a mystery all wrapped up in anticipation.She radiated a warm, pleasant buzz, and several vivid pictures suddenly flickered through her mind.He thought for a moment, understood, and smiled at the compliment.She had imagined her mind would be bare before his, naked under a scorching desert sun, with neither shelter nor refuge.Instead, it was like playing hide and seek in the light and shadow of a forest, discovering and inventing a new language of double meaning, subtlety, poetry, and image.As a linguist, she was captivated; as a lover, she was enraptured.Nothing could be said the same way twice.Their destination, a small bay earmarked for future Council development, was all sand and dry, unpopulated scrubland yet perfectly suited to the purpose.Pale, shallow water stretched for hundreds of meters up to the line where it met abruptly with depths of dark blue ocean.Dllenahkh scanned the darker colors carefully and sighed with relief.They were too late to witness the splashdown but in time for everything else.He dismounted, held the reins securely, and watched the horizon.After briefly eyeing him with curiosity, Delarua did the same.Dllenahkhs horse sidestepped nervously.He reassured it with a brief mental touch.Whatwhat is that?Delarua gasped.A hectare of distant ocean was shifting.Solid grayness gradually emerged, surging up like a wave, but slowly, so slowly that barely a ripple chased over the waters surface to the beach.Its center was stiff, ridged, and ponderous, but the edges curled and fanned delicately with exquisite control.Is it ?she whispered softly, her mind a racket of thoughts and emotions.Yes, he confirmed.Small, unharnessed, unladen, but unmistakable.An aperture like a blowhole appeared on the back of the leviathan.Only then did its size become clear as a tiny human creature was ejected in a gentle rush of water to tumble over the side and into the ocean.Eyeless yet aware, the beast carefully washed its living cargo to shore with a lazy flap of its foremost fringe.Delarua kept her eyes fixed in fascination on the small dot traveling inland.Dllenahkh also watched until he sensed some other movement, another shifting patch of gray amid the blue that made him startle and starebut the sea calmed and kept its secret.No longer old but not yet young, Naraldi stepped out of the gentle surf, shaking salt water from his hair.It was just long enough to trouble his eyes, drenched dark in hue with a few white streaks gleaming bright.His pilot suit flashed in the sun, bringing an image of Sayr to Delaruas thoughts.She laughed out loud in sheer happiness, remembering, knowing.Dllenahkh!Grace!Naraldi hailed them gladly.Have you any space in your realm for a rootless wanderer?Dllenahkh felt a sensation of overwhelming, devastating dj vuanother time, another beach, Naraldi rising up out of the ocean to destroy the universe with a few words.His mind had been punctured in that instant, leaving behind a fragmented, perilous memory that could spin him into endless orbit around nothingness.For his own sake, he had learned to forget that day.Now his mind fractured again to take in the reality that he was standing by the sea and hearing Naraldis voice, not merely without desolation but with actual gladness.Memory and moment combined violently, and he struggled to shield Delarua from the sudden maelstrom.She did not look at him.She did not have to.She took firm hold of his hand and silently gave him her storm of joy to navigate instead.Welcome, Naraldi!she cried.Welcome home!
