A lot of their so called science outposts and religious retreats were nothing more than places to dump undesirables, people who didnt quite fit in.Worked out for the best, ironically.Pity the demographics are so skewed.I exhaled very slowly.Youre telling me that of the Sadiri who survived, there are diplomats and judges, pilots and scientists, nuns and monksand jailbirds?Yep.Almost makes you laugh, doesnt it?I felt a bit foolish.Fair enough; it was Cygnian culture and language that was my speciality, but I had begun to pride myself on becoming a bit of an expert in Sadiri matters over the past few months.How do you know all this?I asked resentfully.Used to work in Galactic Patrol, he replied.Been far and wide myself, even as far as Ain.Lots of interesting tales about how Ain got founded, but I think its obvious.You do?I thought I knew what he was going to say.Political differences arise, conflict follows, and the more adventurous faction goes off to make a new world of their choosingor the losing side gets kicked out.That was Punartams story, and which version you got depended on whether the person doing the telling was from Punartam or Ntshune.Prison colony for the worst offenders.Probably people like your He stopped, stiffened.Like Ioan, I said, my stomach plummeting as if the tree had suddenly removed its support from under our feet.Something like that, he said, wary again.Maybe he feared I was going to get all confiding or burst into tears.Go to sleep, he concluded abruptly.I cant keep proper watch with people nattering in my ear all night.I was now suspicious that the Queens overwhelming presence was glamour assisted.I tagged along behind her and Dllenahkh the following morning as they walked in the mellow light below the trees and he told her about Sadira, the Sadiri settlement in Tlaxce, and New Sadira.As I translated, I absently probed at my emotions but found nothing amiss.After she dismissed us and swept off with her small entourage, I asked him directly.How does the Queen strike you?Cautious, he replied.She has clearly heard reports, but she assumes nothing and waits for me to confirm.A very scientific approach.Well, yes, but is there anything more?How does she feel to you?He raised a faintly puzzled eyebrow.Bored.Lonely.Do you find her beautiful?I asked at last.Ah, he said in dawning comprehension.You are worried about the possibility of glamour.No, she uses none.Well, if any of us could tell, it would be you, I grumbled.Do me a favor.When you get a chance, ask her about the Unseelie Court.We were invited to a formal dinner that night.I could not help smiling at the seating arrangements.Qeturah was given a couch on a smaller dais with Lian and Fergus nearby, and the Elves who attended her were mostly male and, well, damn good looking.Nasiha had the smallest dais with Tarik at her side, Joral slightly below, and again some very good looking attendants.I had no such luck.Perhaps this matriarchal society required that I have at least one pet male of my own to qualify for special treatment, or perhaps I was still too useful as a translator.I was stuck just a little back from Dllenahkh, who was seated at the Queens right hand.On the bright side, it seemed that the most attractive attendants had been reserved for the Queens dais, so during lulls in conversation I amused myself by ranking them.One of them, an eight point five on my scale, was quietly tuning a stringed instrument resembling a cithara.He caught my eye and smiled.My eyes widened, and I elbowed a startled Dllenahkh in the ribs.Quick!Ask her about the Unseelie Court!I hissed.He complied, with only a disapproving quirk of the corner of his mouth to chastise me for my behavior, and I dutifully translated.The Queens eyes went from lazy to furious for a moment, then she instantly regained her calm.It is true, she said.It appears that war, when deprived of one reason, simply seeks out another.We are still a people divided, having selected different aspects of legend to embody.And yet it is better than it once was.How so, Your Majesty?asked Dllenahkh.Clapping her hands, she caught the minstrels attention.Tell them a story of the Elder Days, the one about the woman with three sons.The minstrel set down his instrument, stood, and addressed the court in a mellifluous tenor.A woman had three sons, and when they were grown, the first came to her and said, Mama, I love a girl and wish to marry her.She replied, Son, this gladdens my heart, but of what lineage is she?Alas, Mama, he told her.She is half Terran.His mother raised her hands and shook her head and said, A tragedy, but I will cope.The second son came some time after to inform her of his desire to marry, and, worse yet, the bride he had selected was half Terran, half Ntshune, with no taSadiri in her at all.But again his mother raised her hands, shook her head, and said, A tragedy, but I will cope.Finally, the third son came to her and said he was engaged.When she inquired about the girls lineage, he answered smugly, She is all taSadiri, Mama.Wonderful news, his mother cried.Of what family?She is of the Other clan, he confessed.Whereupon his mother rose up with her blade and slew him without another word.The bard waited for me to finish translating, then spoke low for my ears.I hope you have rendered it well.It is one of my best tales, handed down from my grandmother.Tale or family history?I murmured teasingly in reply.He merely smiled enigmatically.Conflicts are less intense, less bloody than before.Some blame the admixture of our blood; others credit our new traditions, the Queen said.And some say there is yet a third reason, murmured the bard as he returned to his instrument.Peace, child, all in good time.What my impertinent great grandson wishes me to tell you is that some of the women of the Seelie Court are long lived, specifically the women of my house.The Queen looked around at her attendants.Suddenly, their devotion and her goddesslike air no longer seemed unwarranted.In many cultures it is considered discourteous to ask a woman her age, Dllenahkh said.If I may beg your pardon in advance, would you satisfy my curiosity?I took care to translate the elegant framing of Dllenahkhs request.I believe I succeeded, for the Queen smiled at him and said graciously, I am nearly three hundred and forty seven Standard years.Cygnian law prohibits extending the life span by genetic means, Qeturah noted.It is a risky proposition, with uneven results.The Queen shrugged.What was done was done so long ago.Were we perhaps seeking to restore the years that the mixing of our blood had taken from us?And yes, the results are uneven, as you can witness.But it has provided a core of stability in our society.You are a land of true matriarchs.Is that why there is no king in your court?Dllenahkh inquired.The Queen seemed delighted at this question.There have been two in the past, but these days I follow the example of other women of my House and content myself with my attendants.There was a slight choking sound as Fergus inhaled his drink, no doubt finally realizing the significance of his placing at the Commissioners feet.Qeturah smiled and patted his shoulder.Hush, dear; no explanations.This is no time for me to lose face.What a life, Lian said to me afterward.Ive never seen a woman with a harem who so obviously deserved it.I hope she keeps a close eye on her family tree.It would be very awkward to seduce ones great grandnephew.Theyre a small population, I agreed.I wouldnt be surprised if there was a little mutual kidnapping going on with the other Elves.Yep.Anything for fresh blood, Lian said.I frowned to myself, not quite knowing why.The discussions continued.What made matters particularly difficult was the fact that the Queen became enthralled by the sound of the Sadiri language and pressed Dllenahkh to speak only in that tongue.Cymraeg is very poetic, even romantic, and Standard less so, though serviceable enough.Sadiri is absolutely perfect as a programming language, but when it comes to matters of the heart, it falls a little short.This became obvious when the tenor of the conversation began to change.Why dont you tell me Im beautiful?she said randomly one day.It would be appropriate if you were to comment on the aesthetics of my person, I communicated to Dllenahkh.His eyebrows rose the merest fraction.The fact that you are an extremely attractive woman is sufficiently obvious that it does not require my repeating it.Need I tell you what so many others have told you before?I replied to her.She laughed lightly.I bit my lip in frustration.Any progress with that translator?I asked Tarik moodily as he worked on his handheld, comfortably seated on edge of the tbren with his legs dangling over high green infinity.He gave me a steady look.It will not be ready before the end of our sojourn here.Blast, I muttered.Im so tired of this.On the last day of our stay, the Queen seemed in a reflective mood.She took Dllenahkh and me up to the highest tbren, whose view extended beyond the trees, across the valley, and to the gray shadowed horizon with its high, distant mountains.A small group of attendants followed as usual, and her minstrel played his cithara in the background, singing in some variant of Cymraeg that was unfamiliar to me.The business of the ElvenSadiri exchange had long been concluded, with the result that the only talk remaining between them was small talk.Dllenahkh noted in grave Sadiri fashion that the music was pleasingly harmonious.It is a love song, she said to him, but her eyes were on me, her smile mocking though not yet cruel.Shall I translate it for you?She signaled to the minstrel with a languid movement of her hand, and he began again, singing softly to the complex melody while she translated in perfect Standard:  The mind is a golden vein seamed in crumbling rock (also known as rotting quartz).And why had it amused her to have me tagging along as an imperfect interpreter when she could easily have spoken for herself in Standard?I would never understand what passed for humor among the Elves.The golden mean becomes a kindness as she learns to sip the echo of his smiles.That was a nice little turn of phrase there.The echo of a smilethat reminded me of the subtlety of Sadiri facial expressions.That Sadira died, that her heart was shorn of innocence by a conscienceless man,  the hell?She couldnt possibly mean And yet my spine stiffened as the lilt of her voice and the sly slant of her looks suffused each word with a far too personal significance.that she tempts him to laughter and other ruin, that they ache, that they find their way, slowly, delicately, respectfully passions slow but inexorable burn  I was too embarrassed to look at Dllenahkh and too curious not to, so I settled for a furtive glance that only told me that he appeared to be perfectly still and controlled.Its not the sun that blinds her, nor the golden rays of impossibility in an infinitely permutable and permissive landscape.Light diffuses through suspended sand.They dance, exquisitely slowly, an elegant sarabande.She concluded the verses with a gentle flourish of her wrist and fingers.I have so much time and so many to choose from, she said to me with a beautifully condescending smile.I can afford to be generous.Then she gracefully inclined her head, gathered up her entourage with the casual command of a glance, and withdrew, leaving us alone on the lookout with the minstrel still quietly playing nearby.My ears were burning.It was impossible to pretend that I did not understand who the song was referring to, and what she had just hinted.Dllenahkh cleared his throat.I have recently received some new projections concerning the planned infrastructural improvements for the Tlaxce homesteadings.Would you care to go over them with me?I believe there are some points that may be of interest to you.Yes, lets.That sounds fascinating, I quickly agreed, and we made our way back to our tbren with no further incident.That afternoon, we said our farewells and flew on toward our next assignment, stopping overnight at another Forestry outpost.I was curious to know what the Sadiri had thought of the Elven solution to taSadiri strife, so I approached them as they sat outdoors at twilight, talking among themselves in Sadiri.I know weve already had our formal debriefing, I said with careful politeness, but I was wondering what you thought of the Elves of the Seelie Court and what recommendations you might make concerning them to the Sadiri settlement.It was an interesting encounter, but I do not aspire to become a member of a harem, Dllenahkh said.As far as I could tell, he was teasing me, but I was too mortified to appreciate the effort at light heartedness, especially since Joral, Nasiha, and Tarik were wearing various expressions of suppressed amusement, which was, for them, the equivalent of a belly laugh.Yeah, about that, I muttered, examining my boots.Im sorry she got the wrong impression about us.I swear, I translated as best I could, but You are distressed, he said in genuine surprise.But surely you cannot think that this is the first time people have speculated on the nature of our relationship?I was finally able to look up, my jaw slack with amazement.What?It is true, Joral confirmed.It was one of the first things Tonio asked me when he was attached to the team.Tarik and I have discussed the possibility more than once, Nasiha admitted.They looked at Dllenahkh, who grudgingly confessed, Lanuri continues to exact a most un Sadiri revenge for what he terms my well meaning meddling in his personal life.He has been affixing advice to the end of every piece of official correspondence he sends to me.He is of the opinion that my apparent slow progress with you is an indication that I need help.I laughed out loud, not least because I detected more than a touch of Freyda Mar in that statement.Then Tarik spoke up.As more people learn about the missions work, there is a growing sense that it would be fitting if one or both of the single Sadiri on the team were to find wives by the end of the year as a sort of symbol of success for the broader undertaking.My features struggled to find the right response to this news and settled on pained incredulity.Thats ridiculous.For what Dllenahkh and Joral are doing, those people should have Sadiri princesses lined up for them when they get back rather than speculating about every ragtag and bobtail they happen to work with.Dllenahkhs eyebrows went up, as expected.I am not familiar with that phrase, but if the tone is any indication, I would have to say that you are hardly in that category.Most kind, I scoffed.Look, you guys feel free to keep searching, but Ive got some contacts at the Ministry of Family Planning, and once youre both registered, we can draw up a list of candidates of a certain caliber.Most kind, Dllenahkh said blandly, but for a moment I felt a strange flash of something electric, almost as if he were angry.Well, its the least I can do for unwittingly blocking your prospects, I said lightly, hiding my bewilderment at his reaction.I think it is an excellent idea, Joral said.You could register too.I I faltered, trying to find a good excuse.Qeturah was already convinced I needed therapy, and I wanted to keep the Sadiri on my side.I dont see why not.Set a good example and all that.But lets be sensible about this.Youve got more choices now.Women are coming to you and inviting you to visit them.You could even return to the Seelie Court, maybe convince a few to become fully Sadiri.It might take a little time, but Nasiha looked amused, whether at my backpedaling or at the idea of Joral as Sadiri missionary to Elven women, I wasnt sure.Well, Joral, what do you think of this option?she asked.Joral pondered for a while, then snapped out, Unacceptable.I was not the only one startled at the sharpness of his tone.Everyone seemed to straighten slightly as he went on with increasing intensity.I want a wife, and children, and a family of my blood.I want sons and daughters who will look like my brothers and sisters who are gone, who will speak Sadiri and learn of Sadira and practice the mental disciplines.I want to see them married and grow old enough to see my grandchildren and great grandchildren.I am the last of my line, the sole survivor of my family, like so many others on the homesteadings.The Councillor is right; why should any of us seek to be a member of a harem?Why should we desire frivolous things?I want Joral Leave him be.Shockingly, the fierce words that cut off Dllenahkhs attempt to bring Joral back to proper Sadiri behavior came from Nasiha.She knelt before Joral and spoke passionately.We desire these things too.These are good things to desire, right and appropriate things.We shall see these things come to pass for you and for others.Your line will not die out.I backed away, a lump in my throat.Collective grief is one thing, but the Sadiri are very scary when they get intense.I turned to see Lian watching wide eyed from a distance and gladly found my excuse to leave.Lian, youre not going to help out Joral any time soon, are you?I murmured.Lian answered with a head shake, still staring past me, awed at the sight of overwrought Sadiri.Well, if you have a sister or a friend to recommend to Joral instead, that would be a nice gesture.Ill look into it, Lian said absently.I keep forgetting how important this is to them, you know?Im just as bad, I said morosely.Teasing you about Joral.Treating him like a boy and not a man.Treating Dllenahkh like Lian eyed me with great interest.Like?I frowned, trying to think.I dunno.As if hell always be around to be my sidekick.Like Ill never have to share him with a wife and children andhah, from all theyre saying, grandchildren too.Dont laugh at me, Lian, but I was jealous of that woman monopolizing his time and attention.Ive never felt like that before.Hmm, said Lian.Well, I wont laugh at you.We walked away and gave them some privacy, but later on I caught Nasiha alone just as she was coming out of her quarters.So, I began cautiously, is it too early to congratulate you?Nasiha struggled, keeping her face neutral and her chin aggressively up, but then she exhaled and glared at me with a kind of proud defeat.It is remarkable how you are able to be so perceptive in some areas and so obtuse in others.Yes, it is too early.It will be too early until, as Joral said, I can see my great grandchildren.Then you may congratulate me.I wont be alive then, I said cheekily.Ill leave you a congratulations message that you can open whenever it seems right to you.Nasiha gave me a determined look.I believe young parents will become a new Sadiri tradition.You may yet be alive to see the fourth generation, perhaps even the fifth.I nodded, imagining it and finding it good.Id stick around just for that.Maybe even tweak a gene to be sure.She completely shocked me in the next moment.She put a hand on my shoulder not at all affectionately but more as if she were bracing me for something.It would be advantageous for us to seek the assistance of suitable non Sadiri for the education and care of our child.Tarik and I have agreed that given your experience and knowledge of the Sadiri language and culture, you would be the natural choice.Ah, I said, panicked and wide eyed under the strong grip of her hand.This is an important duty.What does it entail?You would function as an elder member of the family.A godparent, if you will.ThenI would be honored, I replied in wonderment.Nasiha seemed to calm down at this assurance.She released my shoulder, tilted her head, and considered me.You were not fooling us earlier.Something about marriage frightens you.I opened my mouth to remonstrate, and she raised a silencing hand.Do not try to lie to me.Remember, I have documented your empathic and telepathic data, and I know a little about your ex fianc.I understand your difficulty.You do?I said.Nasiha in the role of supportive confidante was boggling my mind.Yes.You have concerns that you may influence your spouse without intending to or that you may again be influenced without your knowledge.These are rational concerns, but your inability to deal with them properly is turning them into irrational fears.What do you suggest I do?I said almost meekly.You must learn how to shield your emotions and thoughts.You must learn how to protect yourself and others.There are aspects of the Sadiri disciplines that can help you achieve this.It is a practical solution.It is, I agreed.My sense of relief at her blunt but insightful summary was so great that I felt myself grow an extra centimeter, as if a burden had literally been lifted from my back.I wondered, not for the first time, if the Sadiri had any concept of therapy in the gentle, lengthy Cygnian sense.I doubted it.It might just have been Nasiha, but there was an attitude of going straight in with a sharp blade instead of beating around the bush.Excellent, she barked out.We will start tomorrow.She walked away, leaving me stunned and not a little fearful of what the morrow might bring.RIDI, PAGLIACCIO Training with Nasiha going well?asked Qeturah absently, tapping out a report with a practiced staccato rhythm.We were working in a place called Crue, a midsize town that straddled a few key trade routes.The population was large but constantly changing: merchants, tourists in transit to more interesting places, and of course our fellow civil servants keeping the wheels of government moving smoothly (or, to quote Gilda at her most cynical, keeping the speed bumps of government before the greased wheels of commerce).It had little to offer in terms of taSadiri culture, but we were there for a teleconference of a more agreeable kind.The midpoint of the mission schedule was approaching, and the media wanted to give us a little attention.Qeturah and Dllenahkh had been interviewed, and the rest of the team got a piece of the spotlight as well.It was also a good time to catch up on paperwork and reports in actual offices with full size desks, courtesy of the local branch of Central Government.Quite well, I replied, not hiding my pleased surprise.Shes almost patient with me, but not too much.Keeps me sharp, yknow?Those early mornings alone would keep you sharp, she said drily.Of course Nasiha would not sacrifice her own meditation time for me, so I had the dubious honor of rising even earlier than the average Sadiri for my training.Well, shed better let me off just this once, because tonightll be a late one.We were going out on the town.Id discovered that both Dllenahkh and Joral had managed to duck Gildas cultural tours, and Qeturah thought we needed a little change of pace.She, Nasiha, and Fergus opted for something contemporary in the form of a holovid at the local cineplex, and the rest of us were going to risk a stage production by a touring company.It was certainly rustic, right down to the paper playbill and glossy poster tacked up outside the theater.The End of the Laughter.I recognize this one, said Joral.Is this the adaptation of Enough, the taSadiri tale of a man who kills his unfaithful wife and her lover?No, said Tarik, shaking his head firmly.You have made a common error.In this one, he kills the man that he mistakenly thinks is her lover while her real lover gets away.This is an adaptation of the Ainya play Deception, not Enough.Okay, not meaning to muddy the waters, I said, but Im fairly certain that what we have here is a version of Otello, one of the old Terran standards.Kills his not unfaithful wife on the say so of a man who was out to get him.Lian approached the poster more closely and read the fine print at the bottom out loud.Based on the Italian opera Pagliacci.We crowded around the poster.Who dies?asked Tarik with interest.And was the infidelity real or alleged?Is there some other production we might attend which does not illustrate that dysfunctional pair bonding is endemic in most cultures?asked Dllenahkh with heavy disapproval.I sighed and rolled my eyes.Everyones a critic.Come on.Lets go in.Lian was already making for the foyer, and I began to follow when I sensed something strange in the atmosphere.Turning back, I saw that the Sadiri had paused, almost in midstride, and were watching a pretty girl with tumbling black curls dashing toward a side alley, presumably on her way to the back entrance of the theater.She held a coat and a handbag tightly in one hand and a pair of shoes in the other, as if she had grabbed them while running out the door and hadnt had time to pull herself together.It might have been better if she had, for she was wearing one of the skimpiest dresses I have ever seen.Her legs were pretty much uncovered, and I have no idea how she managed to run so fast with so little support for her upper assets.All the skin on view, and there was plenty, radiated a muted shimmer.Ive seen some women try to imitate that look with silicon  and mica rich lotions, hoping to be taken for a Zhinuvian woman with flexible limbs and even more flexible morals.It never looks the same.Heads everywhere were turning, not just the Sadiri ones.There was a small collective sigh when she disappeared from view.I stared at my colleagues in amazement.Youall of youyou were looking that girl up and down!I didnt know whether to be appalled or hugely entertained.First Officer Delarua, Joral said in a tone so severe that he almost sounded like Dllenahkh in chastising mode, while it is true that we are Sadiri and therefore not prone to mental distractions, we are more than capable of aesthetic appreciation of the feminine human form.I had no answer to that, so I rounded on Tarik.Well, then, youyoure married!I am allowed to look, he said uncertainly.Id confirm that with Nasiha if I were you, I said skeptically.Dllenahkhs voice was utterly composed.There is no need to be concerned, Delarua.Sadiri possess far too much mental control to be susceptible to the mesmeric influence of Zhinuvians.Oh, and that makes it better, does it?I said.I was this close to wagging a finger and calling them naughty boys, so I made myself back off.I went and whispered to Lian instead, and we broke down in quiet tears of laughter at the concept of horny Sadiri.Our seats were midhouse near the central aisledecent enough for what we were seeing and hearing.It was of a style referred to as neo opera.It combined an absence of technological enhancement with a blend of contemporary styles of music, which meant that the performers had to be both vocally powerful and versatile.I wish I had time to tell you about the whole neo opera movement and how it relates to the rustica backlash against audio smoothing and augmentation in musical performance and realissimo effects in holovidding.I will say that there is a simplicity in the staging.Not minimalistthats another stylebut a simplicity that pretends at amateurism but most definitely isnt.I wasnt the least surprised to find that the mysterious golden girl was the leading lady, Nedda.Only a diva could risk turning up that late and not expect to be fired.I was surprised at the modesty of her costume, covering to neck and ankle and wrist.She was good, perhaps a little weak in the singing but with a presence and expressiveness that made up for it.Her husband, Canio, was played by a tall, dark, brooding type who seemed destined to go the Othello route, because this girl was just too popular.In addition to having a lover, Silvio, she had also attracted the attentionsunwanted, alasof Taddeo.Silvio was unexpectedly weedy and scholarly, but Taddeo was boyish and sweetly besotted, offering a kind of comic foil to the unrelenting and obsessive passion of the two older men.The performers were not Terran method actors.Method actors call up a strange mask of remembered emotion and fit it to the situation on stage.You can feel the reality of it, but something jars a tiny bit if you know what to look for.These ones were of the Ntshune verisimilitude school, which is very similar but can only be mastered by those with a touch of empathic ability.Basically, the actors draw on one anothers feelings, and sometimes one great actor is all that is needed to provoke the right emotions and reactions from the rest of the company.Im mentioning this to give a reason for what I was doing.I was reading the actors.Sadiri ethics on telepathy do not match Ntshune ethics on empathy.To the Sadiri, thoughts may be shared but are still considered private for the most part, and emotions are definitely private and must be shielded against as much as possible.Most Ntshune are comfortable reading anyones emotions.Its part of how we communicate.We wouldnt pry for feelings that arent intended for us, but projected emotions are fair game.A lot of Ntshune influenced Cygnian cultures have internalized this distinction.So when I turned and whispered excitedly to Dllenahkh that I was picking up real jealousy from one of the actors on stage, he gave me a look that made me feel like Joral on the receiving end of a lecture on Sadiri comportment.I was confused.During the intermission, he pulled me aside and asked sternly, What has Nasiha been teaching you?I gave him a very old fashioned look.What I did in there has nothing to do with what Nasiha is teaching me.I was simply reading the actors, as I always do.He didnt back down.The training you are receiving will improve and focus your empathic abilities, making casual use particularly unethical at this stage.I thought that you of all people would appreciate this.Dllenahkh!Theyre actors!Im not digging for state secrets; Im trying to enjoy the play at another level!Now, lighten up, please.People are looking at us strangely.I dont think theyve ever seen a Sadiri arguing before.He exhaled slowly.I am not arguing.I had only been teasing him, but there was a tiny bit of stress on the word not, and for a moment he closed his eyes a fraction longer than a blink.Of course you arent, I said quietly, suddenly repentant.I wont do it again if it bothers you, okay?During the second act, I found myself distracted by Dllenahkhs unusual moodiness.He sat beside me, his attention entirely on the stage, but there was a set to his features that spoke of endurance rather than enjoyment.I began to feel guilty, but then when I glanced at Joral and Tarik, they appeared absorbed and interested.Not just a general Sadiri thing, then.Then I saw it.It wasnt empathyit was clearly visible on the mans face.Canio looked across at Nedda, and his eyes spoke murder.I grasped Dllenahkhs arm.Tell me you didnt see that.Grace, he remonstrated, firmly removing my hand.I did something then that was definitely unethical.In that rare moment of skin to skin contact between our hands, I reached out to read Canio.An ugly wave of jealousy and hatred came from Canio, washing over us like fouled water.Dllenahkhs hand convulsed on mine, for a moment gripping so tightly that it hurt, then fell away quickly.How did you do that?He sounded more stunned than disapproving this time.Shhh!Listen!I whispered frantically.It wasnt the right word perhaps, but he understood, because slowly, almost unwillingly, he put his arm along the back of my seat and rested his palm discreetly against my temple.I concentrated on the scene before me.It was a moment of high drama when Canio is acting the part of Pagliaccio and becomes so overwhelmed with jealousy and passion that he forgets he is on stage and pressures Nedda to tell him the name of her lover.When he picked up a knife, I shivered; when he chased her off the ministage, caught her, and stabbed her in the belly, I jumped and turned away.I wasnt the only one in the audience who did so, but I was probably the only one whose disbelief hadnt been suspended.Dllenahkh broke contact with my temple and gripped my shoulder reassuringly.Silvio was the next to be stabbed, but there was no emotion behind that one, only the actors facade, the leftover grimace of pain and disgust from the earlier attack.I shivered again.I have to get out of here, I muttered.I stood up and left just as the last notes of the final song were ringing out.Lian was the first to come to me as I paced up and down in the foyer.What was that about?You looked like you were going to be sick.Are you okay?Yes.No.I dont know.I paced some more, biting my nails.I dont know what happened in there.Well, whatever it was, youve made Joral, Tarik, and Dllenahkh go into deep discussion.I stopped, suddenly self conscious.Really?What are they saying?Sadiris not my thing, remember?Lian remarked.Here they are.Just ask them.They looked horribly serious, more serious than even a Sadiri had any right to look.I cowered instantly, anticipating criticism.Im sorry Apologies are not necessary, said Tarik.We wish to know more about your experience of what happened during the performance.Dllenahkh looked around the foyer, now filling with people on their way out.But not here.Let us return to our lodgings.Qeturah was already asleep when we got back, but after Tarik brought Nasiha into the sitting room of our hotel, Lian frowned, shrugged, and went to get Fergus, so there was almost a full house for the meeting.Dllenahkh spoke immediately to Nasiha, not even waiting for her to be seated.Your pupil did something unusual tonight.Instantly intrigued, Nasiha settled herself in a chair and said, Oh?She was able to obtain strong readings of an actors emotions during the performance, Dllenahkh stated.Nasiha looked disappointed.Oh.She is capable on occasion of almost Ntshune sensitivity in reading peoples emotions, but so far she has not been consistent in displaying this ability.It is nothing to be concerned about.That was not what was unusual.I straightened in surprise.During the time she was detecting his emotions, our hands touched.I found myself in that instant able to read, albeit faintly, the thoughts of the actornot his emotions, his thoughts.I found this sufficiently intriguing that I attempted, with permission, a unidirectional link with Delaruas mind.I found myself reading not her thoughts but the actors, and with even greater clarity.Nasiha frowned.Some Cygnians are capable of noncontact telepathy; however, it usually requires a strong level of projection from both parties.Moreover, we have already noted that Delaruas telepathic abilities are almost nil.There is more, Tarik said, giving Dllenahkh a significant look.Dllenahkh returned the look steadily as he spoke to Nasiha.I consider that the actors thoughts clearly indicated an intent to commit murder.The actor was playing the part of a jealous husband, Tarik pointed out.It sounded as if he had appointed himself devils advocate.What is your opinion on this, Delarua?Nasiha asked me.I dont know.I didnt hear any thoughts.I didnt know thats what Dllenahkh was doing.I thought he was picking up the emotions, same as I was.It wasnt acting, I can tell you that.When he took up the knife I shuddered again, feeling sick.It might be prudent to advise the authorities, said Dllenahkh.Advise them of what precisely?asked Tarik mildly.This was going nowhere.Look, Nasiha, why dont you just come see for yourself?I blurted out.Sit next to me, put me in some kind of parallel link or whatever it is you need to do.I would be interested in attending if only to determine what your mind is doing, she mused.Wait a minute, Fergus objected suddenly.Shouldnt you clear this with the Commissioner?Of course we will, Fergus, Lian said.But theyre not kidding about this.It could be something serious, and it cant hurt to be sure.I was glad Lian had been there to see our reaction and was therefore on our side, because when we informed Qeturah the following morning, she wasnt convinced.I cant stop you from going if you think its really necessary, she said, but it seems a waste of time to me.You could come with us, I suggested.The more objective witnesses, the better.Im not that fond of neo opera, she said wryly, and I dont see why I should have to suffer.You can call me if anything happens.Lian stayed with her, but she let us take Fergus.Tarik stated that he would prefer not to sit through the entire thing again, and when he admitted that, Joral was happy to volunteer to stay behind as well.I didnt mind.I was well contented with the troops Id been given.They did at least come to see us off in the hotel lobby that evening.Nice dress, said Lian, all raised eyebrows.And the kohls made a reappearance too, I see.Nasiha insisted that we get front row seats.A little more effort is required, I said, primly adjusting the knee length hem of my sapphire blue dress.Ha!See?The others were also dressed for the occasion.Im not a clothes horse, but I can appreciate when someone finds a style that works for them.Nasiha was stunning in a severe, high waisted, long sleeved burgundy dress that came to her ankles.Dllenahkh and Fergus had only to blend in and chose to do so with the traditional black: Dllenahkh very dashing in a high collared shirt under a hip length tunic with matching trousers and Fergus in a similar shirt, but with a short jacket that, to be honest, showed off the close fit of his trousers rather nicely.I had no idea what to expect when we took our seats in the theater, Nasiha on my left, Dllenahkh on my right, Fergus next to Dllenahkh.Nasiha must have sensed my trepidation, for she said to me, Delarua, all that is required is for you to relax.We will do whatever else is needed.I inhaled deeply, nodded, and began the calming exercises she had taught me, closing my eyes for better focus.I felt when she touched her palm briefly to my face and when Dllenahkh did the same.Then she murmured, Your mind senses us dimly.How curious.I assume Dllenahkh is the elephant, which means I am the cat.I chuckled to myself.I hadnt thought about it, but yeah, thats how I picture you.She was silent for a while longer.This is most strange.Dllenahkh, was yesterday the first time that you linked your mind to Delaruas?There are connections between your minds that suggest a deeper level of bonding than could be achieved by a single one way link.Shh, said Dllenahkh, sounding a bit stifled.The orchestra is starting.I was very relieved that he spoke, for my usual reaction to any mention of our time with the adepts was an uncontrollable clenching of the jaw.The production remained free of incident till intermission time and beyond.As the ending of the second act drew near, I sat forward slightly, eager to catch a glimpse of something to prove we werent crazy.But Canio was passionately acting, nothing more.Nedda was giving an uneven but enthusiastic performance.I began to scan the other characters: Silvio, Taddeo, random people in the chorus.Nothing seemed unusual except that Taddeos acting was a bit flat compared with the day before.I frowned, wondering if I should feel disappointed or relieved that nothing was going to happen.It is the knife, Nasiha whispered suddenly.It is, Dllenahkh confirmed.For a moment I was baffled, and then understanding coalesced into a horrific image.The knife!I yelled.Dont use it!Its real!I started to move.I didnt expect anyone to take my yelling seriously.This was a touring production; they were probably too accustomed to shouts of Look behind you!whether they were called for or not.Canio was a professional, all right.He didnt even blink at the interruption as he came down from the tiny stage onstage to confront Nedda in his manufactured fury.He pulled back his arm, blade at the ready, and drove it at her abdomen.But Nedda knew.Somehow, between my shout and (who knows) some telepathic or empathic sense of her own, she did not stand to take the blade full on, as she had done the night before.She turned her body, but too late to avoid a slash that tore costume and skin and drenched all in blood.She stumbled, fell to her knees, then collapsed completely.Thoroughly fooled, the real audience gasped and applauded in appreciation for the unexpected twist of high quality special effects.The stage audience, on the other hand, reacted very badly, well aware that things were not going as rehearsed.A mad, high scream sounded over the general uproar.Finish it!Finish it!Snatching the knife from the distraught Canios immobile hand, Taddeo lunged for Nedda where she lay gashed, bleeding, but not yet seriously harmed.It was enough time for me to scramble up the central stage steps and throw myself at him.Dont ask me how this happened.I am no superwoman, and I would never have done that sort of nonsense in a million years, but I blame the empathic connection.My adrenaline was as high as his, and I was terrified that someone was going to die in front of me.I must have surprised Nasiha and Dllenahkh, because they moved belatedly and had to contend with the bedlam of the audience pouring down the stage steps and jumping into the orchestra pit.I realized my folly when he turned the knife on me.I twisted frantically and felt the blade tug my dress as the fabric was pierced and sliced from belly to shoulder.The point of the knife went mercifully up the space between my breasts and just missed my carotid artery.Then he disappeared in a crunching thud, Dllenahkh and Fergus side tackling him with such force that I swore one or two of his bones must have broken somewhere.Ow, I said weakly, and sat down suddenly on the stage, trying to hold the top of my dress together.Are you injured, Delarua?Nasiha asked, crouching down beside me.No.Well, yes, but not by the blade.I think I pulled a muscle ducking that knife.Even as I spoke, I was looking around her to see what Neddas fate had been.She was sitting up, surrounded by help.Someone had already brought out a medkit to begin treating her wound.I shall call the Commissioner, said Nasiha, looking around in faint distaste at all the confusion.It will help if a high ranking official corroborates ourunique evidence.She was right.If it hadnt been for Qeturah, we might have ended up detained for questioning, but her presence plus Sadiri gravitas meant that Nasiha and I were interviewed very courteously by a constable in one of the dressing rooms while I tried to patch the bodice of my dress with strips of gaffer tape.When the constable was finished, she informed us that the rest of the team were waiting for us in the green room and we were free to go.Wont you tell us what really happened?I begged her.Cant give out the details of the case before trial, maam, she said laconically.Then she looked at my pleading eyes and relented with a shrug, Lets just say that a mnage  trois can get really messy when it implodes.Give me a straightforward one on one any day, but city folk like to get creativeno offense to you, maam.None taken, I said.Im homestead born and bred myself.I just work in the city sometimes.Smiling at that, she thanked us and left, taking her handheld with the record of our interviews.I stood up and shifted my shoulders uncertainly, looking in the brightly lit mirror at my pathetic repair attempt.Do you think thisll hold, Nasiha?Or am I asking for trouble?Excuse me?The shy words were accompanied by a soft knock.The girl with the glow, Nedda, the star herself, was at the door, peering in anxiously at me and Nasiha.She had changed her clothes and was carrying a garment bag over her shoulder.Apart from a slight shadowing under her eyes, she looked very much alive.Youre okay!I said gleefully.You really are okay!She broke into the biggest grin.They tell me I have you to thank for that.She put her hand to her mouth, seemingly horrified.Oh, your dress!Your pretty dress!Some women are like that about clothes.Skin heals, but a really good dress is irreplaceable.I wasnt even scratched, I told her.But you cant go out like that!She cleared the counter of cosmetics with a sweep of her arm and flung the garment bag down.I watched as she unsealed it, impressed at the drama with which she invested every move, then began to stammer and demur when I understood her intentions.Nonsense, she insisted.Here.I had it cleaned just yesterday.It rivaled the head turner of the previous night.Dark gold, extremely short, and with creative, decorative ventilating slits in the bodice, it would have caused an entire colony of Sadiri to stumble.Oh, I cant wear this!I exclaimed.Youyouve got the legs for it.I dont.Yes, you do, she chided.Try it on.I stammered some more.Her face fell.Youre right.Maybe if I wore dresses like that more often, she said, nodding at Nasihas austere look, I wouldnt have so many problems.No, dont say that!I cried in dismay.Why would you say that?Dont make this your fault.It is certainly not your fault, said Nasiha.You are not even sufficiently Zhinuvian to impose any mental influence.Nedda looked suddenly happy.You can tell?Oh, thats such a relief!One Zhinuvian great grandparent, and I get smacked with the glimmer skin and the shiny hair and stupid attitudes from men and women.Funny thing, genetics.Actually, Im mostly Ntshune; can you believe it?I can, I said cheerfully.Dark eyes, wildly curly hair, sunny disposition We grinned at each other.I started to strip.There was no way I was going to make this nice girl feel bad by refusing her help.Oh, it does fit!Just a bit longer on me, but thatsooooh, hey, youve got antigrav boosters in here!Niiice!I threw caution, and my bra, to the wind, the former metaphorically, the latter literally.Its perfect, she proclaimed.Keep it.Something to remember me by.She sealed her bag again and waved to us as she headed for the door.Thanks again!Bye!I laughed happily.Test her, Nasiha.Ill bet she projects significantly on the frenzy scale.Hmm, said Nasiha.She is indeed very beautiful and extremely vivacious.I hope you meant what you said to her.What?That this is not her fault.There was a small silence.Wow, youre taking lessons from Qeturah now?I said, but without rancor.Okay, I get it.Barring the unethical use of Zhinuvian strength mesmeric influence, I am not responsible for any foolishness that a man might care to perpetrate on my behalf.Good.Now let us rejoin the others.Or rather, and here she looked at me with eyes that narrowed ever so slightly with amusement, I will go and arrange transportation while you rejoin the others and tell them to meet me outside.I think it will be kinder for Tarik if I am not present when you walk in wearing that dress.Self consciousness returned in a rush, but before I could reconsider, Nasiha had already departed with the shreds of my dress and my bra.I pulled myself together and went into the green room, walking with my head down as if guilty of some immense social crime.When I finally dared to glance up briefly, I almost wished I hadnt, because it only made me want to giggle.Jorals eyes were suddenly trained on the ceiling, Tariks were fixed unseeingly on the ground, and Ferguss mouth was open as he stared at me.DllenahkhI didnt have time to notice what he was doing.My dress was ruined, I said defensively to the floor.Of course, said Qeturah smoothly, and how kind of them to provide you with something to wear home.Behind her, Lian exploded into a fit of snorts and chuckles.If anyone would like to lend me a coat, I said, my tone dignified and affronted.The night is quite warm, said Dllenahkh innocently.Are you sure that a coat will be required?
