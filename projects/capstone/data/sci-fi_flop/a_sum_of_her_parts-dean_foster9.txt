Exhibiting utter disdain for the crackling flames it continued its measured approach.This wasnt right, she told herself as she started to back up.Something here was not natural.All cats were at least wary of fire.The tawny quarter ton beast in front of her was coming on as if the torch wasnt there, as if she held nothing in her fist more primevally threatening than a sprig of parsley.By now both of her companions were awake.Taking immediate notice of the nocturnal visitor they had similarly armed themselves with blazing branches.The male Meld began yelling at the lion even as he scrambled to keep the fire between it and himself.Meanwhile the other woman hurried to add the remainder of the wood they had gathered onto the blaze.This caused the flames to shoot several meters high.Without breaking stride, the lion walked majestically through the center of the conflagration.A few wisps of smoke trailed from the tips of its mane as it emerged on the other side.At the same time the light from the blaze was strong enough to reveal the small box of tan colored metal that was mounted on the back of the big cats skull.Her initial reaction had been more accurate than she knew: this lion was indeed not natural.It had been magified.At the same time as she threw her makeshift torch at its face and turned to run she caught a glimpse of something else poking out from the depths of the magnificent mane: a tiny black spot sporting a bit of gleam in its center.A vit camera.Grabbing a handful of sand as she ran and ignoring the screams and curses of her comrades she threw the sand in the lions direction, hoping to hit its eyes, and raced for the ravine they had crossed earlier.In its depths she might find shelter; an overhang, a cave, something.Behind her the cries of panic had turned to shrieks of agony and pain.They were nearly drowned out by the butchering roar of not one but several desert lions.A regular perimeter patrol, she wondered as she fled, or a special surprise dispatched from Nerens specifically for the purpose of disabusing the freed prisoners of any notion of escape?The ravine lay just ahead.Ignoring the sharp rocks that cut and tore at her bare feet she plunged over the side.Out of sight was not out of smell, but at least this way the maniped cats could not be put on her trail by controllers monitoring the activity from Nerens.The co opted carnivores would have to find her on their own.Judging from the awful sounds of rending and tearing and the snapping of bone that filled the night behind her, the lions, magified or not, were likely to settle down to feed.If sufficiently preoccupied with their hominid meal they might well forget about her.Moving fast along the sandy bottom of the ravine she sought to put as much distance between herself and the continuing carnage as possible.When she finally did stop, utterly out of breath and with leg muscles screaming, she could hear nothing behind her.Shed done it, she told herself.She was the only one to escape the slaughter.But then, in the final analysis she was the only one who mattered.By the time company security arrived at the scene to clean up after their feline patrol, probably in the morning, they would find only the remnants of bodies that had been dismembered and consumed.Sufficiently masticated and disarticulated, the remains of two might well pass for three, in which case they would not come looking for a single survivor.Living to tomorrow night would tell her if she was safe from the further attention of Het Kruger and his minions.As the seconds and then the minutes ticked away with no hint of leonine attention she was increasingly convinced that was indeed the case.If only she had not sat on the snake.The Sum of Her Parts     14 Kruger was relaxing in his office contemplating his vit wall when the call came.As it did on alternate days the projected depth image had automatically changed.This morning it was showing the boulder flecked beach of Anse Source dArgent in the Seychelles, perhaps the most famous if not the most beautiful beach in the world.Wavelets the color of peridot broke on smooth white sand while unseen gulls called softly.A study in feathered obsidian, a black paradise flycatcher sat on a rock preening its extraordinary tail feathers.Irritated at the interruption, Kruger muttered a curt order.Advanced by verbal command the image refreshed.Now it depicted the verdant depths of the western Amazonian rain forest.The chatter of monkeys replaced the calls of gulls.Being surrounded by sand he was not as enamored of beach scenes, no matter how spectacular, as someone else might have been.As he turned back to the vook he had been reading, his desk communicator sounded a second call.This time he acknowledged it.He listened to the details, verified receipt of the transmission, and rose.What had gone wrong with the world that he should receive three such notifications in the space of a single week?What was thisintruder season?With a sigh he deactivated the vook, which automatically marked the vit illustrated page he had been reading, picked up his portable communicator, and headed for the door.Back soon, I expect, he told his receptionist.Another set of infiltrators.Another?She eyed him in disbelief.Danae was beautiful, they both were single, and their relationship was strictly one between two professionals.Sex was easy to find, he knew.Competent staff was not.Sounds like it, from the description.Only these two somehow got insidedeep insidewithout setting off a single alarm.Made it all the way to Research before one of our people, thank Oompaul, spotted an incongruity.You dont think they actually could have penetrated Research security, do you, Mr.Kruger?Based on the brief description I just got I dont think they could have penetrated security at the Tusker Bar in Pretoria, much less here.But they did.His expression was grim.There has been a lapse somewhere.A serious lapse.I will find out where the gap exists, and it will be plugged.She watched him leave the reception area and returned to her own work.For all Het Krugers buff construction, gentlemanly politeness, and manicured speech she would never have considered embarking on a relationship with him.The chief of security was solid as a rock, through and through.Emotionally as well as physically.THE CONTRAST WITH THE previous quintet of intruders could not have been more striking.Just by looking at the pair Kruger could tell they bore no relationship, professional or otherwise, to the infiltration team that had preceded them.Taking up his usual position in the interrogation room he regarded the two new prisoners thoughtfully.Like their now deceased and dismembered predecessors they were bound arm and leg and had been fastened securely to the back wall.The longer he examined them, the less he thought the bindings necessary.These were not trained assassins or sinister agents of industrial espionage.One was as thin a man Meld as the security chief had ever seen.Hanging in his bonds the scruffy Meld alternated strings of curses with wracking sobs.His Natural companion was a highly attractive and to Krugers practiced eye recently maniped redhead who seemed as out of place in the depths of the Namib and the bowels of Nerens as a maniped multilimbed ecdysiast delivering a lecture on Kierkegaard at Oxford.What the devil were these two doing in Nerens?More important, how had two such obvious amateurs succeeded in penetrating not one but three separate concentric security perimeters without setting off a single alert?Though his employers might feel otherwise, his personal responsibilities demanded that he show more interest in the latter conundrum than the former.One thing was certain: he would learn nothing by speculating.His right hand did not move toward the communicator resting in his shirt pocket.No ominous apertures appeared in the ceiling in response to a command.Immoderate methods of persuasion would not be necessary with these two.At most, a few selective descriptions of what could happen to them if they refused to cooperate should be sufficient to overcome any hesitancy.Muting the aggravation he felt at this latest interruption in his copacetic daily routine, he sighed and began.What are your names, please, and who do you work for?He did not even have to threaten.The slender Meld spoke up without hesitation.Everybody calls me Whispr, and this is my friend, Dr.Ingrid Seastrom.The woman looked shocked.Whispr!How could you ?Kruger cut her off.Your friend is being sensible as well as perceptive.These walls contain many monitors of diverse ability.As you hang there they are reading your blood pressure, heart rate, neurological output, cranial cortex response, and enough additional physiological factors to tell me whether you are lying or not.He nodded approvingly at Whispr.I can see that this interview will go quickly and responsibly.And then youll kill us, Ingrid muttered bitterly.Not necessarily.Termination, in every sense of the word, depends on your responses.Now, who are you working for?Head down, she stared at the floor.Go ahead and talk, Whispr.Youre going to anyway.Im sorry, doc.I know people like this.Theres nothing to be gained trying to fool him.Itd only go harder on both of us.Again Kruger nodded.Extremely sensible.Continue.We work for ourselves.Kruger pulled his communicator.Not to order incineration of the speaker, but to check the readouts from the concealed monitoring instrumentation.He was more than a little surprised to see that the ganglion of sophisticated apparatus insisted that the speaker was telling the truth.Though he knew they couldnt be wrong, the security chief was still reluctant to accept the results.Yourselves?You dont strike me as the kind of independent operators Im used to dealing with.So you say youre working for yourselves.To what end?Why did you risk your lives to break into a private, secure facility in the Forbidden Zone?Ingrid sighed.Whispr was doubtless correct.There was nothing to be gained by trying to withhold information from this man.But if the opportunity presented itself, they could be less than directly forthcoming.In my work as a practicing general physician, she began.Kruger interrupted again.Youre telling me that you are truly a licensed doctor?Really, yes.Once more the security chief checked the readouts on his communicator.Once again he found it difficult to credit the information he was being given.If the monitors were to be believed, like her companion the woman was also telling the truth.In the absence of comment or question from their captor Ingrid decided it would be prudent, or at least acceptable, to continue.In my work I came across some objects fashioned of what appeared to be metastable metallic hydrogen.A material that should not existat least, not on the surface of the Earth.Her head came up.Might as well plead for mercy with her eyes as well as her voice, she thought.I became obsessed with it, with trying to learn how something like that could be manufactured.I started trying to research it.She nodded to her right.Through circumstances that we neednt go into I made the acquaintance of this gentleman here.Gentleman.Whisprs bonds seemed to slacken a little.who is far more street wise than I am.Her gaze returned to their dubious but attentive interrogator.I employed him to help me negotiate certain strata of society that would eat me alive were I to try to penetrate them by myself.Somehow she managed a smile.As you can see, we made a pretty decent team.We got this far.We were so careful.She looked down at her booted feet.In the end we were tripped up by something quite ordinary.Kruger was understanding.You would be surprised, Ingrid Seastrom, how often that occurs in my line of work.Its so often the simplest things that undo the best made plans.As he listened she laid out the details of the journey that had taken her and her companion all the way from the civilized surrounds of Greater Savannah to the barren depths of the Namib.She spoke plainly and straightforwardly.It sounded like someone dictating a will.These were ordinary people, he told himself.He didnt need expensive concealed instrumentation to tell him so.Perhaps that was how they had made it this far; by relying on their very ordinariness.If he didnt think they were anything special it was reasonable to assume that those responsible for a succession of safeguards stretching all the way back to Cape Town might think likewise.For those seeking to accomplish the impossible it is a wonderful thing to be overlooked and underestimated.He would not commit that sin.They had penetrated Nerens and nearly made it into Research.There must, there had to be more to them than was discernible at first sight.Despite his initial impression he did not discount the possibility that they might be the most sophisticated infiltrators he had ever encountered, capable of fooling not only him but the perceptive mechanisms that were designed to flush out even the most accomplished liars.Bringing his communicator up to his mouth he murmured a command.A fresh set of instructions appeared on the screen.He touched one.Two pairs of finger thick metal rods rose from the floor, one set flanking each of the prisoners.Each rod was topped by a fist sized silvery metal sphere.His fingers hovered over the communicator screen.Youve been very cooperative, but now Im going to have to ask you some questions you may not want to answer.There are no questions I wont answer.Sensing all too well what was coming Whispr began to twitch fearfully in his bonds.Nevertheless One of Krugers fingers started to descend.Just me, just do me!The skinny Melds voice rose for the first time since the security chief had entered the room.Dont hurt her!Startled as much by his outburst as by its subject matter, Ingrid gaped at him.Kruger paused.Interesting.Spindly as you are I wouldnt have thought thered be room enough in that shriveled frame for chivalry.It doesnt matter.Personally Id be glad to grant your request.Professionally Im afraid I cant allow any plea, heartfelt or otherwise, to interfere with business.But it did matterat least to Ingrid.Lips slightly parted, she continued to stare at her companion as she waited for whatever was to come.The opening of the sole door behind Kruger beat the descent of his finger to the communicators responsive surface by a second or so.Whispr just stared, but Ingrid couldnt help herself.She gasped audibly at the sight of the two grotesquely corpulent figures who shambled into the interrogation chamber.Though they were quite real, they made no sense.Especially to a physician.In an era of readily available cosmetic melds beyond anything people of earlier times had ever dreamed of there was no reason for any human being to look like the newly arrived couple.While every imaginable physical fetish could be readily realized, gross obesity was one she had never encountered either in person or in the medical literature.There was no body type that could not be altered, no genetic idiosyncrasy that could not be realigned.Adjusting hormonal imbalance was as straightforward as mixing a cocktail in a bar.Given the multiplicity of easily available alternatives, why would anyone choose to look like this?She could not keep from staring.The gobsmacked unswerving gazes of the two prisoners in no way unsettled the waddling pair.No doubt they were used to such appalled stares.Leaning toward the security chief, the woman whispered in his ear.Kruger did not pull away in disgust as another might have.Instead, he replied with equal softness.It was apparent that he knew these two well and they him.The security chief concluded the brief conversation by murmuring into his communicator.He appeared neither disappointed nor pleased.The deceptively innocent looking metal standards remained upright where they had emerged from the floor and did nothing.Moments passed while he and his outrageously corpulent visitors engaged in conversation that was inaudible to the two prisoners.This ceased only when the door opened again and they were joined by a fourth figure.At the appearance of this new individual Whispr let out a small moan.For the second time since she had been pinned like a fly to the wall, Ingrid gasped.The newcomer was short, stocky, elderlyand familiar.Kruger nodded toward the new arrival.Are these by any chance the two Namericans you thought might show up somewhere in the Namib near Nerens?Napun Mols gaze focused on Whispr before shifting to Ingrid.It was strange seeing his frustratingly elusive quarry here like this, helpless and collared after the long, long chase they had led him on.A part of him expected them to vanish in a puff of smoke, forcing him to resume the trail yet again.But only a very small part of him.I anticipated that they would be detected and picked up much farther south.The last thing I expected was to find them within the confines of the facility itself.Affecting a nonexistent innocence, the older man looked up at the much bigger Kruger.There would appear to have been a breach of security.Krugers muscles went taut.If there was anything he loathed it was having his competency questionedespecially when the accuser happened to be right.His reply was just shy of a snarl.Youre damn lucky you come with the kind of company rating that prevents me from hitting you with more than the occasional bad word.Please.Mol waved it away.Sometimes I am too direct.I mean nothing by it but at the same time I cannot help it.It is my manner.Turning back to face the prisoners he raised his voice slightly.No doubt you are surprised to see me here.A late young lady who was part of an ill conceived bunch that broke into the sangoma Thembekiles house in Cape Town succeeded in accessing a small amount of information from the witch doctors box storage.The young lady could only remember a single word, but because of its repeated use and singular nature it stuck with her.Right to the end, I might add.That word was Namib.Now, knowing full well your interest in a certain piece of riffled company property and your self confessed desire to learn its meaning, the knowledge that you were heading for the Namib could only mean you intended to try furthering your knowledge at the one place in this part of the continent that might offer such information.That would be the Nerens facility.He shook his head, the gesture expressing a mix of admiration and regret.I confess I never expected you to get this far.I thought you would be picked up on company surveillance and brought in before you could get ten kilometers out of Orangemund.With spread hands he indicated their surroundings.Yet here you are.Inside Nerens itself.I am as astonished by your persistence as much as I am charmed by your navet.He turned to Kruger.Excuse me a moment.This has been a very long and tiresome time coming.Walking up to the two captives, the elderly assassin halted between them.Who presently has the thread?Despite his earlier insistence that he would answer any question, Whispr now said nothing.It was neither his place to do so nor his decision to make.As for Ingrid, she saw no point in trying to delay the inevitable.I do.Itsshe bit her lower lipits in a safety compartment in my brassiere.Left side.Mol nodded.Safe and warm.Reaching into the top of her overgown he felt around briefly until he found the compartment, unsealed it, and removed the storage capsule.Within the small transparent cylinder the thread gleamed, intact and unharmed.He held it up between them.His expression roiled her stomach like month old milk.Did you expect me to linger over the recovery?He shook his head sadly.I favor the kind of physical infarctions that involve rather more than casual tactility, Ms.Seastrom.As a doctor, you will have the opportunity to appreciate the diversity I can bring to more in depth physiological exploration.He smiled unpleasantly.Very soon now, I hope.Kruger was growing impatient.Such taunting displeased the professional in him.I still need to find out how they managed to get inside.Certainly, certainly.First things first.I have waited this long; I can wait a little longer.Stepping back, Mol took one last long look at the capsule and its contents whose recovery had consumed him for more weeks than he cared to count.Except for its silvery sheen the storage thread within looked little different from hundreds of others he had seen and used himself.Its composition and contents were none of his business.Pivoting, and with some ceremony, he placed it in the pudgy palm of the indifferently coiffed overweight man.I declare this SICK, Inc.property officially recovered.This concludes the formal part of my assignment.One that I regret took up entirely too much time, at considerable expense both to the company and myself.Turning back to the prisoners he locked eyes with Ingrid.He had begun to perspire ever so slightly.There will be no charge for the follow up interrogation, which I expect to also take a considerable amount of time.He glanced at Kruger.I will unearth that which you wish to know, as well as satisfying myself as to the processes followed by these two in managing to evade my notice for such an extended period of time.You may of course participate if you wish.The snake smile returned.Or you may just watch.I think Ill give both a pass.Krugers distaste was evident.Ill read your formal report.Mol shrugged indifferently.It may take several days.I intend to make it so.Whenever its done.Krugers distaste intensified as he turned to leave.As Mol turned back to the prisoners and the security chief headed for the door, the fat woman lurched lightly forward.For the first time, her voice rose to the level of audibility.The words that emerged were formal and oddly stilted.Try as he might, Whispr couldnt place the accent, nor could Ingrid.We will assume control of the interrogation at this point, the woman announced.Her companion had lumbered up beside her.At closer range Ingrid saw that despite their weight neither of them appeared to be breathing with much effort.She was surprised that there was no indication of respiratory stress.Dwarfed by the massive pair, Mol nonetheless protested vigorously.Pardon me?I have spent many frustrating weeks chasing this pair of thieves across two continents, at considerable risk to my constitution and, in one instance, to my physical person.Oftentimes I was sustained principally by the expectation that I would eventually be able to conclude the matter personally.The obese man trained enormous dark eyes on Mol.Far too large to be natural, they must have required an extensive optic meld, Ingrid knew.Something about the sheen on the corneas left her puzzled.Your individual concerns and preoccupations are of no interest to us, Mr.Mol.You were engaged because you are a professional and were given a job to do.You did not fail, but you did not exactly succeed, either.The individuals in question and the stolen item presented themselves here, for capture and recovery not by you but by the forces of Chief of Security Kruger.Nevertheless, it is taken into consideration that you carried out all that was asked of you, and you will therefore be recompensed accordingly.But this interrogation is now concluded.We will conduct the follow up.While Ingrid accepted that the fat mans final pronouncement was less than reassuring, she was enormously relieved that further questioning would not be carried out by Napun Mol.Like a dog forced to watch as its favorite bone was taken away by its master, the elderly executioner persisted.If its answers you wish from them, no one is more skilled at information extraction than myself.I have the experience and the desire.I plead with you; leave them to my care.I fear, declared the vast woman from the depths of her bloat, that the methods I perceive in your heart would involve extracting more than information.The decision is final.Mol was left standing and shaking with disappointment.After all he had been through, after all the slights to his skill and experience, now even this small compensation was to be denied him.What can you possibly want with these two?They are beneath ordinary.What good can they do you?The big man seemed to swell beyond the bounds of his already immense girth.If she is truly a competent physician then she can possibly be made useful.We always have need of pliant doctors.She is not to be harmed.Kruger was buoyant as the door to the interrogation chamber shut behind him.Napun Mol might be the most highly thought of hunter tracker in the companys arsenal, but he was also an arrogant old prick.It had been a quiet delight to watch as the two executive untouchables pulled his expected prey right out from under him.Cut him down a notch.Arshloch, he thought as he rounded a corner.No less than the thwarted Mol, Kruger wondered why the untouchables had decided to spare Ingrid Seastrom.Why did they always have need of pliant doctors?Well, it was none of his business.He had a break in security to locate and plug and plenty of paperwork to attend to.It was all out of his hands now in any case.The untouchables did not explain or elaborate upon their decisions.They did not have to.From the time the installation at Nerens had been established it was understood that within the facilitys boundaries, the corpulent commanders words were law.That suited the security chief just fine.It was much easier to follow orders than to propagate them.Within the interrogation chamber Mol was pointing toward the back wall.What about him?Fixed in the assassins glare like a moth under a magnifying glass, Whispr tried to shrink back into the whiteness.Ingrid held her breath.The paired masses of flesh consulted.We have no interest in him and he is of no use to us, the man finally burbled.You may do with him as you wish.Mol looked satisfied.If he could not play with the striking doctor, he could at least amuse himself with her companion.Small consolation but better than none.Like hell he can!Corpulents and killer alike turned at Ingrids shout.Having already surprised herself, she plunged onward lest she think too much about what she was doing.Unless Whispr is allowed to stay with me and remain unharmed, I wonthelp youwith whatever it is you have in mind for me.Looking to her right she mimicked her companions voice along with his earlier words.Dont hurt him.This is absurd!Mol protested.I am entitled to some satisfaction!The untouchables conferred.As a tense Ingrid and Whispr looked on, the woman spoke to the assassin.Your monetary recompense will be doubled.Consider that your satisfaction.As far as Mol was concerned, it was a dismissal.The woman turned her attention to the prisoners.Perhaps at the same time she gave a hidden signal, or perhaps her male associate conveyed unseen instructions with chunky fingers.However the command was transmitted, it resulted in the bands that secured the prisoners limbs debonding.Both Whispr and Ingrid promptly collapsed to the floor; two piles of skewed limbs and cramped muscles.He lives as long as you cooperate.As he addressed Ingrid, the fat mans voice was perfectly flat and devoid of emotion.He might as well have been warning a child that she could keep her teddy bear so long as she minded her manners at the dinner table.His companion was gazing unblinkingly at the elderly but ramrod straight hunter killer.Is there a problem remaining, Mr.Mol?No, the oldster replied curtly.No, theres no problem.I will deal with my disappointment.Collecting himself, he mustered a smile.I am, as you say, a consummate professional.The additional funds you have promised will allow me, among other things, to indulge in the diversion you have blocked here.You are comfortable with this?the woman persisted.Mol adopted his most avuncular mien.Still smiling, he walked over to where Whispr was now sitting up with his back against the wall trying to rub some feeling back into his legs.At Mols approach his fingers ceased their ministrations.Inclining slightly, even elegantly, forward at the waist, the assassin proffered an accommodating hand.I have only been doing my job.In a sense, you have bettered me.In my entire experience this has never happened before.Yet still I extend my hand.Whisprs reply was cold and even.You tried to kill me.Me and Ingrid.Several times.I watched you kill other people.Mols acknowledging nod was barely perceptible, as was the mockery in his voice.How fortunate you have never had to kill other people.His eyes fastened on Whisprs.Have you, riffler?Whispr stole a quick glance at Ingrid.Then he reached up and took the assassins hand.Aware that the oversize eyes of both obese executives were on his back, Mol pulled firmly until his former quarry stood standing before him, swaying slightly.He eyed the stick man appraisingly as the latter cradled his slightly bruised fingers.I have always felt height overrated.In my profession, anyway, the last thing one wishes to do is stand out.Turning, he walked over to Ingrid and once again extended a helping hand.Having watched him assist Whispr to his feet without incident, she accepted the reaching fingers.Yanking on her arm forcefully and with artfully concealed power, he pulled her hard up against him and jammed his aged lips against hers.Those fleshy flaps, at least, remained unmelded.They tasted of a moral and physical decrepitude no biosurge work could purge.His sallow breath rose from lungs that, no matter how skillfully and repeatedly had been maniped, were still reflective of his age.Before she could pull away he gently but firmly bit her.She yelped and wrenched free of the noisome embrace.Or rather, he let her go.Had he so desired, he could have held her against him no matter how many kicks or punches she tried to deliver.Ever mindful of the heavy lensed executive eyes monitoring his every move, he had released her.Stepping away, she put the back of her left hand against her mouth.It came away stained crimson.He smiled one last time.All the blood Im going to get today, it would seem.Goodbye, Dr.Seastrom.Whatever the untouchables decide to do to you, consider yourself fortunate.With that he turned, strode wordlessly past the pair of hulking decision makers, and disappeared through the doorway.Behind him he left a slowly strengthening Whispr and Ingrid facing their podgy, soft voiced saviors.If savior was indeed the right word.At least whatever happened now they were free of and safe from the perverse and deadly attentions of Napun Mol.Even if they ended up dead it would count as a victory of sorts.She tried to read the man and his female colleague and failed.Their expressions never varied and it was impossible to tell what their heavily maniped eyes concealed.Judging from their words, not empathy.They had preserved her and Whispr from the attentions of Mol out of a self interest that had something to do with her being a doctor.Please come with us, the woman requested.No explanation, no elaboration.Under the circumstances Ingrid decided that a thank you for saving them from Mol would have been superfluous.Not that it would necessarily pass unrecognized.She just suspected it would be ignored.They were not bound prior to exiting the interrogation room.There was no need.They could not possibly escape the complex without being recaptured.Ingrid almost smiled to herself.It had proven easier to break in than it would be to break out.So confident were the overweight escorts of their prisoners security that they led the way down passages and hallways without once looking back to see if Ingrid and Whispr were still following.Maintaining an unexpectedly fast pace for such a hefty couple, they forced their prisoners to break into the occasional jog to keep up.Along the way they passed dozens of other employees, Meld and Natural alike.A few glanced in the direction of the two oversized striders and their trailing captives, but no one said anything.What do you think they want with us?Whispr spoke as they all but ran down one corridor after another, making remarkable time through the complex.I dont know, I dont know.Whatever it is, it cant be worse than what Mol had in mind for us.Her companion had reverted to his usual optimistic self.Sure, you say that now, but when we get to wherever it is that were going Have you noticed, Whispr?I think weve been heading north.You think maybe theyre taking us to Research?He considered.That could be a good thing or a bad thing.Good if theyre going to explain what their research here is all about.His voice fell.Bad if theyre intent on making us part of it.He hesitated, swallowed.I really appreciate what you did for me back there, doc.Ingrid.She meet his gaze evenly.Earlier you did the same thing for me, Whispr.Archie.No.He shook his head firmly.I screamed on your behalf out of desperation.You had a choice.You put yourself on the line for me.She shrugged, suddenly embarrassed.Youre the only piece of useful equipment I paid for that Ive got left.Huh, he grunted.Youd better check again.I think the warrantys expired.The entrance to Research before which they finally slowed and stopped was different from the one they had tried to bluff their way through previously.But there was a similar desk set off to one side, and the chair behind it was occupied by a guard clad in a uniform identical to the one worn by the all too alert young employee who had called them out.What happened next was instructive.The guard looked up, then immediately and without comment returned his attention to whatever he had been perusing on his box monitor.He did not ask questions of Ingrid and Whisprs escorts nor did he seek any form of identification.Recalling previously observed security procedures Ingrid expected one of the massive interrogators to run a retina check, or flash a glowp tag.Their escorts did nothing.Despite this, the massive doorway swung silently inward to admit them.Without being bidden, the two mystified Namericans followed.Two more security barriers had to be passed.Following the third they found themselves in a series of brightly lit corridors and rooms whose functions Ingrid could not divine despite passing rank after rank of glistening equipment.Men and women, Naturals and Melds, and most notably several more of the exceedingly large people labored intently and often silently at tasks whose purpose remained a mystery to her.As far as Whispr was concerned he might just as well have stepped through the looking glass into Wonderland.Not a bit of the suddenly bewildering surroundings registered on his experience.The most apropos adjective he could think of to describe what he was seeing was expensive.Directed into a small room they were instructed to sit.The walls, ceiling, and floor were a pure, flawless white, as was the single simple table and several chairs that constituted the only furniture.Their new surroundings made the recently vacated interrogation chamber seem dirty.Ingrid felt as if they had been injected into a square eggshell.Their escorts did not sit.Waddling to the far side of the room the female began dragging sausagelike fingers over the slick plasticky surface of one wall with all the adroitness of a concert pianist essaying a sonata by Schubert.Wherever her blunt fingertips lightly made contact with the wall, strange glowing shapes appeared in their wake.Swathes of pastel color took on depth and shadow as the nebulous rainbows she conjured became solid.Ingrid thought of languid Greek letters entwining in linguistically incestuous relationships.As to whether the writhing, morphing shapes represented language, advanced mathematics, or something else, she could not have said.Real pretty.Whisprs comment reflected his characteristic preference for brevity.If its show and tell time Im afraid our hosts are out of luck: I left all my toys at home.Not for the first time Ingrid could only sit back and admire his bluster.Raising his voice, he unflinchingly addressed their captors.Mind telling us what this is all about?By way of reply the male escort came near.Huge dark eyes peered into Whisprs own.An emboldened Whispr held the stare unblinkingly.At least, he did until the fat man began to unzip his face.The Sum of Her Parts     15 While Whispr uttered a little gargling sound and drew back, Ingrid simply sat and stared.As the mans skin split down the middle she could see that his female companion was likewise shedding her epidermis.The halves of two humans formed wrinkled piles at their owners ankles.What stood revealed in their wake was not a pair of butterflies.Oh shit, Whispr mumbled.He repeated it over and over.As a defensive mantra it was singularly unhelpful.The expos was the more shocking for the fact that it was unpreceded by any hints.Neither their captors ventral or dorsal sides had revealed the slightest indication of a seal or seam.Now their skin and clothing lay mounded up around their feet.Or where their feet would have been if theyd had any.Where the fat woman had been standing, a complex of meter long golden spires unfolded.Each terminated in points save for several that devolved into smaller prehensile spires that replaced sloughed off hands and fingers.From the center of the architecturally admirable being a pair of glistening lenses protruded on stalks to contemplate the two stunned Namericans.Light shimmered on this confusion of limbs that appeared to be fashioned of pure buttery gold.Could this motile clash of golden spears still be considered a her?Ingrid wondered.Stepping clear of his mound of shed epidermis and now unnecessary clothing, her companion had also straightened up.At least he was composed of flesh and bone, Ingrid concluded as she studied the creature.This notwithstanding the fact that the head seated on the flexible neck consisted of a single spherical multilensed yellow eye, or that both arms terminated in single lensed eyes of a more familiar sort, or that lenses different from the other two shone from the vicinity of his bare hips.Covered in centimeter long brown fur, the torso was centered on a sturdy square base from whose underside jutted four legs.A gripping tentacle protruded from each knee.The female had stepped out of a sketch by Wright while her associate would not have been out of place in a Lovecraftian popent.As a still stunned and speechless Ingrid and Whispr looked on, the mlange of golden spires ambled stiffly over to the table where they sat.Though no mouth was visible, a voice emerged from the clashing, organo metallic depths.Not only were the words it uttered comprehensible, the vowels emerged in a surge of syntastic liquidity that was positively soothing.You are confused.That is to be expected.Are we also expected to be frightened?Whispr had pushed his chair as far away from the table and the being in front of him as the wall behind him would permit.Because thats really what I am.Oblivious to any intended irony, the spire being focused her singular gaze on the slender Meld.That is to be regretted even as it is understandable.Ingrid swallowed hard.Whatare you?Youre not, you cant be Melds.But we are.Though it was impossible to tell where the great compound orb that topped the males body was looking, his multitude of lesser eyes were inclined in her direction.Though not as you are thinking of us.In the End there are only Melds.Im not a Meld, she countered reflexively.Ive had a couple of recent manips, but theyre only cosmetic and easily reversed.Baby steps, observed the female.For purposes of further dialogue you should know that my name is Sarah.Sarah.Ingrid found that she had been invaded by a frightening calm.Sarah the perambulating, intelligent sculpture.And you may call me Johan.The voice of the spires companion emerged from somewhere within the thick fur that covered its body.Ingrid fought to hold on to her sanity.You said that youre not Melds as we are thinking of you.What does that mean?What did you mean when you said that in the end there are only Melds?Through a subtle physical shuffling that might have been used to indicate emotion, Sarah realigned her gleaming golden integuments.We are Melds, doctor, but we proceed from a different starting point.When I say that we are not Melds as you think of us, that is because we are not human.Tilting his head back Whispr rolled his eyes at the ceiling.Sure youre not.Lowering his gaze once again he looked over at Ingrid.I dont know whats going on here, doc.Maybe this is some elaborate variation on the usual interrogation of intruders scenario.He gestured at the two utterly incomprehensible figures standing before them.But I do know that these are just melds.Or automatons.Probably designed to jar us out of our mental comfort zones so that well be scared enough to do whatever they want.Ingrid was less willing to dismiss the claim out of hand.As a doctor she could not envision how any human body could be pushed, shoved, and crinkled into the quadrupedal eyeful that was Johan, far less into the structural impossibility that was Sarah.Still, where the eyes could be fooled the mind would follow.Youre saying that you arealiens.Indeed.Johan spoke in the same flat tone he had employed when he had been encased in the camouflaging fat suit.Ingrid noted with interest that his crowning compound eye was capable of full rotation, like a hematite sphere suspended in a magnetic field.What must it be like, she wondered, to be able to see in every direction simultaneously?What unimaginably elaborate neuroptic connections were required to process so much visual information?For that matter, where in that furry mass was the controlling brain located?Sarah was clashing toward the door.Come with us.As they followed the two no longer disguised shapes, Ingrid found herself trying to make eye contact with several of the other overweightor perhaps simply oversizedfigures they passed in the wide corridor.None glanced in her direction, though several did speak to and exchange gestures with the outr shapes who were leading the way.Did all of the obese shapes contain within them spires or seers?Or were there other forms, other shapes even more extreme than those represented by Sarah and Johan?Were their radically different escorts the purveyors of outrageous lies, nothing more than extreme Melds as a scornful Whispr insisted?Or ?Aliens?Truly, she thought, what was more alien to human experience than the existence of metastable metallic hydrogen?Except possibly quantum entangled nanoscale cerebral implants.Her head was pounding.Was Nerens the headquarters for some kind of invasion?Assuming, she told herself as calmly as she could, that more than one kind was possible.When they reached an oval opening at the end of the corridor, Johan stepped to one side and gestured with an eye arm.Please.It took Ingrid a moment to discern the outlines of the vehicle she was being askedpolitely, she notedto enter.Transparent as a soap bubble and to all outward appearances no thicker, it had a single curving bench but no visible instruments, machinery, or means of propulsion.Whispr held back.We go in there, he murmured, and maybe we dont come out again.She met his concerned gaze.Like we have a choice.What alternative do you propose, Whispr?She gestured back the way they had come, down the length of what was only one corridor among many.That we make a break for it?Turning away from him she nodded understandingly at the thing that called itself Johan, stepped into the bubble, and nearly lost her balance.Unexpectedly, the floor gave slightly under her weight, like a transparent spring.Devoid of options, as his companion had coolly pointed out, a wary Whispr followed.Their escorts joined them.Ingrid had to concentrate in order to be able to see the walls of the oval opening close.There was no door.The surrounding material rippled like a pond that had been struck with a stone as it sealed tightly behind them.A moment later the bubble began to move.It did not accelerate sharply, but once in motion neither did it ever seem to slow down.Other than the occasional appearance of an overhead light, the tunnel down which they were speeding was pitch black.Within the bubble it was not completely dark, however.Portions of Sarahs golden limbs emitted a pale purple efflorescence of their own.So absorbed was Ingrid in her own thoughts that she did not notice when they hit the midpoint of their journey.There must have been a midpoint because that was when the remarkable vehicle began to slow.She estimated that they had spent the same amount of time decelerating as they had in speeding up.When it finally stopped moving, the bubble came to a halt opposite a portal exactly like the one through which they had entered.How far do you think weve come?she asked her companion as she exited the transportation device.Or did we just go in a big circle?Whisprs expression was grim.Plainly he was preparing himself for the worst.Cant say.Tunnel was too dark, no landmarks, impossible to estimate direction or speed.More than a kilometer, less than a hundred, maybe.I think there near the end we were traveling on a downward grade.But Im just guessing.His smile was crooked.I expect its all guessing from here on out.In the course of the short walk that followed, Ingrid noted other Melds who were recognizably human, but only one or two possible Naturals.Their familiar shapes helped to mitigate the shock of encountering one being after another who made Johan and Sarah look positively normal.There was the giant who was forced to walk hunched over.Nearly all white, he (for unsupportable reasons she thought of it as a he) managed the feat only because a dozen or more short legs ran the length of his upper torso from where the hips began to where the long, backward dragging arms protruded.The headshe turned away from moonlike eyes and piercing azure pupils that floated freely from one side of the iris to the other.The giant was the largest of the creatures they passed, but far from the most exotic.A pair of perambulating, big eyed seashells came toward them.They flanked a very ordinary looking Natural woman.Workpad in hand, brown hair tied behind her in a bun, she reminded Ingrid of hospital staff she often encountered while having lunch in one of her home towers restaurants.Striving to catch her attention, Ingrid gazed fixedly in the other womans direction.When the Natural walked right on past without acknowledging the stare, Ingrid considered calling out.Ultimately she decided to hold her peace.She and Whispr were still prisoners, still considered intruders and trespassers.Untimely vocal outbursts might not be the best way to ingratiate themselves with their escorts.There was an individual who looked like an emaciated horse crossed with an industrial robot, several walking crystals with rotating faces, and a whole platoon of creatures that might have been meter tall upright millipedes save for their bright rainbow colors and the dozens of tiny gloves they wore on their multitude of hands.If these were merely Melds, as Whispr stubbornly continued to insist, then they represented manipulations of the human body far beyond anything she had ever heard of, read of, or dreamed of.So extreme was the eclectic panoply of shapes and sizes that they passed in the passageway that they looked to be the product of magic and not science, as if they had been maniped at the hands of a djinn instead of those of a biosurge.She was looking back at still another biological impossibility when they turned a corner.As her attention shifted forward once again she found herself smacked by a sudden dollop of vertigo.Whispr had to grab and steady her to keep her from falling.For once she welcomed the contact.Someone had punched a hole in the world in front of them and filled it with sublime.IN AN IMMENSITY OF darkness floated a black ovoid bleeding chrome.Only its vitreous sheen, reminiscent of polished onyx, enabled her to distinguish it from the surrounding blackness.
