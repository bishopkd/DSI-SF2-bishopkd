I supposed Fergus would have to be the sole security resource to ease Lians burden.They could have hired someone new, but with the mission already more than half over, I guessed it wasnt feasible.Right, I said, cheerfully.So Ill be sure Lian gets everything within ten days, some partial and some completed as weve agreed on here.Thank you, Dr.Daniyel.Its been an honor to work with you.I rose and held out my hand.She shook it, looking confused.Ill be seeing you at dinner, wont I?Perhaps.I planned to turn in early, given my shuttles departure time tomorrow morning.Youre leaving?She seemed stunned.Iahthought that was the whole point of the exercise?I said not at all sarcastically.I was getting confused too.I thought you would travel with us until we reach the next major city, probably Chukai, about two weeks from now, after our next scheduled stop.I frowned slightly.I assure you, I will get all the documents sent to Lian within the specified time.Thats not She trailed off, sighed, and rubbed her forehead.Very well.I wish you all the best, Delarua.And the same to you and the team, maam, I replied.News travels very fast.Lian was the first to corner me after the meeting.Youre leaving tomorrow?There was a definite note of accusation there.Lian, you guys are leaving tomorrow too.I dont work for the government anymore, remember?I thought youd be around for a while, show me some lab procedures, that kind of thing, Lian said almost plaintively.I sighed.Apparently I wasnt the only one for whom things were just now sinking in.Lian, trust me; for your protection and mine, we shouldnt work in a lab together.You could appeal, Lian insisted.No, no.I think my confession made it a pretty airtight case.Besides, appeals take forever, and Id rather get on with my life.Im sorry.Im sorry too, Lian said, and then, unexpectedly, hugged me hard.(Yes, I know, and no, Im not telling!If you want to know so badly, you can go ask Lian yourself!)Fergus is sorry, Lian said, stepping back.I chuckled.No hes not.Lian smiled wanly.Well, youre right.But he should be.You saved his ass from a useless last stand.Hes never liked me.Im too frivolous for him, I said, speaking with just enough lightness to make it clear that this did not bother me.Hes jealous, Lian said, blunt and unashamed of it.He says Ive gone all girly and giggly since I started hanging out with you.You dont giggle, I said indignantly.You laugh mockingly.I should know; Ive often borne the brunt of it.We laughed briefly at that.It helped.Still smiling ruefully, I said, He thinks Im a small minded bureaucrat, and Dr.Daniyel thinks Im a loose cannon.I went too far, or I didnt go far enough.Im beginning to think Im just an idiot.What do the Sadiri think?Lian asked with typical shrewdness.I puzzled for a moment, then smiled more broadly.Id hazard a guess that they think my actions were completely unethical yet highly appropriate.Saying good bye to the Sadiri was hard because I had to be stoic about it.Nasiha had all my details, and I knew I would see her and Tarik again, and perhaps a godchild as well.As for Joral and Dllenahkh, were there any professional reasons for us to associate again?I wasnt sure.I spoke my farewells to them in the late afternoon.They unbent enough to shake hands, and Joral even looked a bit concerned.But Dllenahkh was quite cool and unfazed, and for some reason that upset me.I made some excuse about packing and turned to go to my room.Delarua, if I could have a word?I turned back.To be perfectly honest, it wasnt only saying good bye that made me feel odd around Dllenahkh now.There was a little voice in my head saying breezily, I dont find the Councillor objectionable in any form or fashion, accompanied by the same comic image of myself tra la laing with my hands clamped to my ears.I have some matters to discuss with you.I would be grateful if you would consider having dinner with me this evening.I understand there is a restaurant not far from here which specializes in Ntshune cuisine.Sure, I said with a casual shrug, ignoring the little tripping sensation in my chest.Just to be certain, I put my mental shields higher.The moment we were actually seated in the restaurant, it all clicked back to normal.He wanted my opinion on his idea of bringing female elders to Cygnus Beta, and it was such an interesting concept that I forgot to feel awkward.I talked about the importance of grandparenting for family groups, the stability that Sadiri societies seemed to find in the matriarchal model, and the need to mimic as far as possible the societal structure of New Sadira so as to encourage a parallel cultural experience for the Sadiri of Cygnus Beta.He listened closely, absently plying his utensils as he ate, and at one stage he grew so absorbed that he sat back, put his hand to his mouth, and gazed at me intently.I believe I had just suggested implementing short term apprenticeships for young Sadiri in the Interplanetary Science Council, the Galactic Foreign Service, and the Galactic Judiciary to cycle new parents out of active service for a long enough leave to spend the formative years with their offspring before optingor notto return to duty.You told me once that there are so few of you left that you must all consider each other as family, I said almost breathlessly.Well, this is the proof of it.I understand if the other Sadiri cant find you wives, but surely they can spare you family.He nodded long and slow in a way that seemed an agreement to more than my last words.I remember some months ago, you warned me that the Sadiri must beware of a misplaced sense of superiority.I have thought long and hard about this, and I have come to the conclusion that while superiority may be our most obvious flaw, it is not the most dangerous one.He pushed aside his plate, leaned his elbows on the table, and regarded me earnestly.I believe that our main flaw, and one I acknowledge in myself, is not that we consider ourselves superior but invincible.This makes it difficult to ask for help, even from our own.He dropped his gaze and began to fiddle with the table linen, a departure from his usual self control that was both touching and worrying.We were sent off to Cygnus Beta, told it was for the good of all Sadiri.What could we do?We went bravely, convinced of our ability to withstand any trialno, determined to do so.Failure was unthinkable.He stilled his hands and exhaled deeply.I can only begin with myself, to set the example.I have a proposal for you.Here he raised his hand and smiled slightly.Not, let me hasten to add, of the kind that would please Commander Nasiha but one that I believe will not disappoint nonetheless.On several occasions you have proved your insightfulness concerning Sadiri society.Would you be willing to continue working for us on this mission?My heart leaped up, but only for a moment.Id had time to ponder my offhand comment to Nasiha, and I saw the difficulties.Id say yes in an instant, Dllenahkh, but its not that simple.What Ive done, theft of genetic materialIm barred from working in Central Government and local government.I might be able to work on the homesteadings in a private capacity, but this is a government mission.I cant accept.And there it was, that little smugness.We are aware of this.However, the Sadiri settlement on Cygnus Beta is in a unique position.While we are, of course, subject to Central Government in terms of the administration of the homesteadings, we have been granted a unique autonomy which leaves ultimate responsibility for the homesteaders with the Government of New Sadira.We selected you for this mission.We can rehire you.My jaw dropped.It was too good to be true.He saw it and tried to inject some caution.I do not have the final word.You must be interviewed and assessed before a decision can be made.I thought, if you did not object, that we might take the morning shuttle to Karaganda, a town with excellent teleconferencing facilities.The interview would take place in the early afternoon, and we would have our answer by the end of the day.Thenyes!By all means, yes!I stammered.Goodness knows how I slept.I was a wreck, wavering between sweet dreams and grim nightmares about the possible outcomes.Dllenahkh and I rose early, and to my great pleasure and mild surprise, we meditated together with Nasiha, Tarik, and Joral before our departure for the shuttle station.The journey to Karaganda was made shorter by a much needed nap, and then it was time for a brief stop at a hotel to have a light lunch, freshen up, and change before the interview.Dllenahkh did not fuss when he came to my door to find me still scrambling to arrange my attire just so.He gravely advised me, eased my worries about the state of my hair, and even helped me arrange the wrap around my head and shoulders and clasp it into place.An unusual piece, he remarked.I realized that his hand had paused on the clasp, which was in the shape of a hummingbird.Nasiha chose it for me.Most apt.Nasiha has excellent taste, I agreed.I took one last look at myself in the mirror, standing calm and straight as any Sadiri.Then I wrung my hands semitheatrically and shook them out from the wrists.Look at me.I wasnt even this nervous for my first interview for a government post.Dllenahkh turned me around and took my hands.His grip was gentle, very warm, and purposely reassuring.He held me immobile with only a look, waiting until he saw my frown vanish, my shoulders relax, and my lips tentatively smile.I have the highest regard for you, Grace.I am sure that I have not erred in my assessment of your character.Thank you, Dllenahkh, I whispered.The teleconferencing center was state of the artit had to be to give such clear reception from Karaganda to Tlaxce City.It meant I had to remind myself not to jiggle my feet or pick at my nails in the mistaken belief that I was not completely in view.I stood alone at the head of the conference table and waited for the holo of my interviewer to appear.When it did, I saw that he had already seated himself, and he indicated with a nod and a gracious wave that I should do the same.I sat as gracefully as I knew how and waited patiently for him to speak first, as befitted an elder.For he was old, aged by years and more, with a timeless sorrow in his eyes that spoke of a galaxys worth of loss rather than a mere planets.He reminded me of the monks of the forest uplands, for he kept his hands tucked into the long, wide sleeves of his tunic and his head was clean shaven.He did not smile or frown, but there was an unusual relaxation to his face that made me wonder whether Sadiri dignity became tempered after long years of wear.Grace Delarua, he said, speaking my name not in greeting but musingly to himself.Tell me about yourself.I once worked for Central Government, sir, I said.Im a biotechnician by training, but recently Ive been doing a lot of liaison work with the Sadiri.Thats how I ended up on the mission, helping the Sadiri as they research different Cygnian societies to see if anything of Sadira has survived.But I think you already know this, sir.Yes, he said, drawing out the single syllable slowly.That was the icebreaker, if you will.Tell me, Grace Delarua, do you like working with the Sadiri?A Sadiri elder talking about icebreakers?I was so baffled at this effort to put me at ease that it almost had the opposite effect, but I went on bravely.Yes, sir.Theyre efficient, no nonsense types and easy to work with because of it.Soyou dont simply feel sorry for them?Sorry for themoh!It had actually taken me a split second to realize he was referring to the disaster.Well, Im sure we all want to help as much as possible, sir, but I dont think thats my main motivation.Id work with them even if Sadira hadnt been destroyedbut then of course theyd hardly have any reason to put up with me.His lips twitched, but where Dllenahkhs would have quickly returned to a disciplined line, his retained a slight upward curl of humor, then leisurely came back to the default professional position.About your actions on Kirtahsg, how would you assess them now?The words were delivered with perfect neutrality, but the atmosphere grew tense.I realized that this was, in a way, the question I had been brought there to answer.There was no other option but honesty.A friend once told me that feeling invincible leads to the mistake of not asking for help.It seems to me Ive made that mistake more than once, and I may have done it again.I understand the Commissioners disappointment that I didnt have faith in her ability to take care of the matter in the usual way.I could have asked for help, or advice, at an earlier stage when things were still salvageable.I didnt.I acted as if I was the only one who could get the job done.That was, in hindsight, a mistake.The grave nod of acknowledgment gave nothing away; it was as perfectly neutral as the question had been.But, I said slowly.An eyebrow quirked silently, inviting me to continue.But Im mostly Terran, which means sometimes I dont do whats sensible and methodical or even appropriate.Sometimes I listen to my intuition.Im sorry, sir, but thats who I am, and at the end of the day all I can do is take responsibility for the consequences.I miss a lot of cues by holovid, something about unconsciously relying on empathy when in proximity to others, but I couldnt miss the warmth in his eyes.Thank you, Grace Delarua.That will be all.Would you please ask Councillor Dllenahkh to join me for a moment?I stood and bowed, then went out in a daze to deliver the message to Dllenahkh.He was in there for much longer than I had been.When he emerged, he looked extremely pensive and not a little disquieted.What took you so long?I demanded anxiously.Did he change his mind?No, no, Dllenahkh assured me hastily.We did not discuss you at all.The Consul isan old friend.We were talking about other matters.I eyed him closely.AhDllenahkh, I cant help but notice you look a bitunnerved.Are you sure everything is all right?He nodded firmly, though his eyes were distant and his mind clearly elsewhere.Yes.Everything is perfectly fine.That kind of certainty sounded very familiar.I had often employed it myself.Do you want to talk about it?I dont think he began, then trailed off and finally looked at me properly.I will if I can.Someday, but not now.Fair enough, I agreed.It helped that he looked more startled than upset, as if whatever news he had heard was surprising rather than distressing.Now, I continued, changing the subject, how are we going to distract ourselves till evening?It turned out that Karaganda also had excellent museums and art galleries.We wasted a pleasant two hours before Dllenahkhs comm went off just as we were in search of a caf.He paused on the pavement, gave me a quick glance, and opened it to answer.His responses were terse and not at all illuminating, but something in the way his spine lengthened and his head went up, something in his slow intake of breath and the expansion of his chestit all added up to a positive result.Im in?I asked lightly as he closed the comm.They have consulted with Central Government and with the Commissioner, and although you are barred from conducting any scientific research whatsoeveryes, youre in.You have been assigned as my cultural attach for the duration of the mission.After thatwe shall see.I ducked my head down and laughed a low, long laugh of sheer relief.So here I am, back where I started, working with you again.Would you like to tell Nasiha, or shall I?he asked in a whimsical voice, as giddy as a Sadiri could get.If you choose your words carefully, you might get her to start planning our wedding ceremony or perhaps even arranging for our childrens betrothals.Nasiha does scare me sometimes, I said wryly, then laughed out loud again, unable to help myself.It was okay.I didnt have to leave.I didnt have to tell him good bye.What he did next was almost, but not quite, a rolling of the eyes.It was more of a flash upward to heaven in a give me strength kind of way followed by a sigh and a rueful smile.She is very eager to see the new generation of Sadiri.Im sure he felt the euphoria of the moment, same as I did, but out in public, on a street with people walking by, it was easier to express it with quiet laughter and gentle quips at our colleagues expense.Displacement behavior, Qeturah would have called it, and Nasiha would have agreed, but I could hardly throw my arms around him and kiss him.That would have been even worse than hugging Joral.And yetthe day was shading into twilight, we were on a tree lined avenue below a street lamp that had just flickered on, and for an instant I felt as if I were in a holovid at the point where the Ella Fitzgerald music starts to swell.I stepped up to him, hovered on the edge of his personal space, then came closer.He eyed me warily but did not move, held, I think, by a curiosity stronger than any decorum.I stretched up on tiptoe, careful not to touch any part of him, half closed my eyes, and deeply inhaled the scent of him at the join of his neck and jaw.Then I stepped back and smiled sweetly.His eyes followed me, still wary but also alight with a sort of intrigued amazement.If I may ask, why did you do that?I feltlet me confess ita little feminine thrill at the deepened tone of his voice.Just checking, Councillor, I said smugly.I wanted to confirm that I was correct in telling Nasiha that I do not find you objectionable in any form or fashion.Zero hour plus one year seven months fifteen days Lian rarely spoke to him, perhaps in part to avoid Joral, perhaps still conscious of that time he had needed the persuasion of a pistol to follow instructions, but Dllenahkh was not offended.Lian was perfectly professional and mostly kept to the Commissioners side, with Delarua and Fergus being the only social exceptions.(He did wonder once if Lians distant attitude might stem from a mild bias against Sadiri, but he quickly rejected the unwanted thought. )A few days after the upheaval in the teams roles and allegiances, he went into his shelter to find Joral staring in fascination at a plainly wrapped box on his small desk.What is it, Joral?he inquired.Corporal Lian brought it for you, Joral said, still staring at it.Dllenahkh frowned in puzzlement, shifted Joral gently to one side, and opened the box.Inside was a small card atop a quantity of springy padding.He read the card.To Councillor Dllenahkhwith thanksLian  He cautiously parted the packing wool.Oh Joral began, and fell silent.How did Lian find this?Dllenahkh asked in amazement.It was a bottle of Sadiri spirits, only three years old, which was young for that particular brand but still incredibly precious as the last from a now extinct distillery.Imay have mentioned something, Joral said.He sounded miserable.Dllenahkh looked at him in surprise, but in an instant it was terribly clearLian, talking to Joral, asking questions, showing interest for the first time, and it was only to get information out of him.He cleared his throat.A kind gesture, no doubt connected to our managing to retain Delarua as a colleague.We should He paused and rested a hand on Jorals shoulder to better transmit his concern, regret, and reassurance.We should have a little now and save the rest to drink at your wedding.Well drink at your wedding.The phrase was a common Sadiri jest said to young and old, married or not, as a roundabout way to wish them well.It sounded hollow and strange.Or yours, Councillor, Joral replied bravely.That seems more likely to happen.There was no bitterness, none, only mild teasing.Yours and mine, then, Dllenahkh said, playing along.After all, I must set a good example, mustnt I?Yes, Councillor, Joral agreed, sounding more like himself.Good.And tomorrowtomorrow we will both register with the Ministry of Family Planning and Maintenance.Fetch the glasses and lets drink to that.FALLING I yawned widely, raising my handheld to my face to hide my weakness from my Sadiri colleagues.The late nights were killing me.Id had some vague idea that since I was in effect an addition to the Sadiri team, I would have less work to do than Id had when I was with the government.After all, Joral was there, Nasiha was still going strong, Tarik remained as quietly diligent as ever, and Dllenahkh led from in front as always.Surely the work would not multiply in order to accommodate the number of persons available to do it.Yes.I know.Youd think Id never worked in the Civil Service.When Dllenahkh said he had the highest regard for me, it wasnt just a consoling compliment.It was myriads of reports and manuals downloaded to my handheld for background knowledge, attending all Sadiri led meetings, writing my own contribution to the mission report being compiled for the Sadiri government, and speaking the Sadiri language on every possible occasion to strengthen understanding of the nuances of the vocabulary.Do you know that there are about ten variants of the Sadiri word for the right thing to do?Theres the thing thats right to do because its beneficial to all concerned.Theres the thing thats right to do because its been done that way for the last seven generations.Theres even the thing thats right to do because it will impress your superior.And they mostly get translated asyou guessed itappropriate.I think theres a particular inflection that means this may or may not be the right thing to do, but if I say that it is, you might shut up and get on with it.I knew I was in deep trouble the day Dllenahkh said to me, It would be appropriate if you completed the Advanced Grammar module by the end of next month, and he managed to combine two variants and that tricky little inflection with just three syllables, a rising tone, and an encouraging little smile.I have never worked so hard in my entire life.Of course there was no way I was going to let them down.Theyd taken a risk bringing me back onto the team in a nose thumbing gesture to Central Governmentalthough, to be honest, it was less of a nose thumbing and more of a we are continuing to experience the traumatic aftereffects of the disaster and would welcome any concessions to maintaining stability and familiarity in our interactions.For a people who claim that deception is inappropriate, the Sadiri know how to spin a manipulative sentence or two, let me tell you.Failure would be an embarrassment not only to myself but also to the people who had bailed me out.No way was I going to let that happen, but there were never enough hours in the day.Qeturahs carefully suppressed pleasure at my return transformed into mild alarm, and finally, after nearly two solid months of watching me run myself into the ground, she pulled the doctor thing on me and took me aside.You look like hell, she said callously.Well, dont spare my feelings, I retorted.Instead of flattering me, why dont you do something helpful like writing a small prescription?She gave me a very long look, then handed over a packet of the small adhesive patches I remembered all too well from my university days.Im only giving you a weeks supply of these.Use them sparingly and do not come back for more.If you havent adjusted to your new duties without chemical aid by the time they run out, youll have to find another solution.Fair enough, I said.It made sense.I didnt want to build up a tolerance to them, and in truth I only needed a little extra time to bring myself up to speed.I used nearly all of them, but only at most dire need.I was almost in the clear, but then there was a visit coming up, and a rescheduling of another visit, and a possible insertion of a new visit on the schedule, and suddenly more work appeared to fill up the space that had been cleared on my handheld.Which led to the present scenario: me fighting sleep during an interminable late night meeting.I fished the last patch discreetly out of my pocket and pressed it gently to my side, letting the warmth of my skin activate the adhesive.The kick was palpable but muted.Id be good for another two hours, nothing more.Better make it count.May I collate the pros and cons that have been laid out thus far?I volunteered.We might find a decision easier to arrive at with a visual representation of the matter.Two hours later, the meeting was wrapping up and I crashed.I dont mean it figuratively; I literally got up, stumbled, and fell over.I lay there on the ground, miraculously unhurt in any way, thought, How comfortable, and closed my eyes for just a second.I raised my head to find Joral and Dllenahkh looking at me expectantly.The visual representation, Delarua?Dllenahkh inquired.Oh, yes, I said, coming alert at last.But I cant do it without accompaniment, you know.Thats why Im here, said an amused voice.I turned my head to see the minstrel bard of the Seelie Court tuning up his cithara, quirking an eyebrow at me in a way that managed to be both cheeky and quite sexy at the same time.Excellent!I said happily.I was afraid you hadnt gotten the memo.Pshhh, he said dismissively as he slapped a miniamplifier onto the wooden frame of his instrument.Miss a sweet gig like this?Not likely!I sang the first few notes of the report so we could calibrate our output, then prepared to begin in earnest.Suddenly, I caught sight of Nasiha and Tarik walking a tightrope between a tree and our tbrenwalking away from us.Hey, guys, arent you going to stay to hear the report?I asked, feeling a bit hurt.Nasiha giggled.Watch your feet, Grace!I had been walking toward them as I spoke, but when she said that, I stopped short and looked down in a panic at my shoes.There was nothing underneath them but air, leaves, branches, and more air.AHHHHHHHHHHHH !Thud.I jolted awake, thrashing wildly with the bedsheets.My hand brushed my side, snagging on the patch.I removed it and was about to throw it away when I dimly saw some strange markings on it.The light on my wrist comm illuminated it enough for me to view the words SEE ME in Qeturahs best medical scrawl.I groaned, tapped off my comm light, cast the spent patch aside, and walloped my pillow resentfully.A dream about a good looking man should not end in sudden death and a sanctimonious note from your doctor.Add to that the embarrassment of having passed out cold in front of DllenahkhBut I was too tired to dwell on any of it.I curled up to fall asleep instantly.EEEEEEEE!You know its bad when youre falling to certain death and all you can think for your blessed last thought is Damn, have I got a girly scream.Thud.I collided not with the unforgiving ground but with a pair of strong arms and a broad chest, all connected to a form and face that I knew well.What the hell?Dllenahkh?I thought.My hero!I cooed as he swooped up into the open sky, carrying me safely.This is bad and wrong, I tried to say.Put me down, you idiot!I can fly for myself!No words came out to break the silence, but he did in fact slow down and land at the edge of a cliff overlooking the ocean.There was an overpoweringly Technicolor sunset going on at the horizon line, and the air was heavy with the scent of sea spray.He gently set me down, gazing into my eyes with a savant strength intensity that suggested that some heavy data analysis or problem solving was going on in that complicated brain.Gently again, he tilted up my chin with the knuckle of a curled forefinger, slowly closed his eyes, and brought his lips closer to mine.And the light went out.When I opened my eyes, it was to see the beautifully mundane poles of a camp shelter over my head and feel a government issue cot under my back.I groaned.Fade to black?When did my erotic dreams ever fade to black?Come to think of it, when did my erotic dreams get so crappy and G rated?One of the side effects of the stimulant patches was odd, trippy dreams, but that was plain weird.I didnt want to dwell on what my subconscious was doing, so I swung myself upright and decided to start the day.I woke myself some more by washing in cold water, then dressed and dragged myself outside.Lian was nearby, sitting beside a field stove, and there were good smells in the air.Qeturah said I should let you sleep in, so I kept breakfast warm for you.With a flourish, Lian uncovered a plate of pancakes.I eyed the scene distrustfully for a moment, waiting for Lian to break into song or the pancakes to flap away, but when all remained sane, I muttered, Bless you, in heartfelt relief and sat down with a rumbling stomach.How late is it, anyway?And where is everybody?I mumbled through mouthfuls of pancake and syrup.Wrapping up the visit to Piedra, Lian replied, waving a hand vaguely southward.Its about lunchtime now; the shuttle should return soon.That was quick!I said.I know it was just a courtesy thing, since we have so much data on them already, but I thought we were going to do an overnight, not a day trip.Lian gave me a puzzled look.We did.Did what?We did do an overnight.How?When?Without me?Take it easy.No one expects you to bounce back immediately from yesterdays ordeal.I frowned.What ordeal?Lian hit the wrist comm, whispered furiously into it for a few seconds, then faced me again with a smile that leaked panic at the edges.Would you like to go lie down again?Within twenty minutes, the shuttle had returned.It wasnt the worried looks that shook me, nor the raised brows; it was the speed with which Qeturah, Dllenahkh, Nasiha, and Tarik got me onto a medtable with sensors stuck all over my skull.Uh, guys, would you like to tell me whats wrong?What is the last thing you remember?asked Dllenahkh calmly as Qeturah circled the medtable adjusting things, Nasiha compared the readings on the monitor with the data displayed on her handheld, and Tarik scanned his handheld furiously, possibly looking up reference texts.We had that really late meeting about the feasibility of including the Traveling Clans in our schedule given their low genetic score but strong retention of Sadiri traditions.Uh, Ive been meaning to talk to you about that.You do know Cygnians need more sleep than Sadiri, right?Because I think Ive been running a little short, and as flattering as it is to be included in everything you discuss, perhaps I could just read the summaries afterward and add a note expressing my views.Nothing after that?asked Qeturah, gently waving some scanning device back and forth across my field of vision.Well, apart from some very vivid dreams and not very restful sleep, the next thing I recall is this mornings breakfast.Which, incidentally, I didnt get the chance to finish.May I finish my breakfast, please?I was beginning to feel irritated.They removed the sensors and guided me solicitously to a seat, which only made me angrier.Dllenahkh sat opposite me and said quietly, The meeting to which you are referring took place not last night but the night before.Ive lost a day?I said, disbelieving.Amnesia is one of the possible effects of the drugs you were given, said Nasiha.Given?By whom?I asked sharply.She glanced quickly at Qeturah, who in turn gave Dllenahkh a somber look.His mouth tensed, then his expression became neutral once more as he spoke to me.We would prefer to avoid telling you what happened yesterday so that we can be certain any memory that returns is of the event rather than of our account of it.Its possible the drugs are still interfering with your hippocampus, said Qeturah quickly by way of diversion.What?I asked, taking the bait.Thats the part of the brain involved in the formation of long term memory, she clarified.Oh, yeah.Been a while since first year neuroanatomy, I mused.I sat still for a moment.I checked myself over, twiddling my toes, flexing my fingers, running my tongue over my teeth.I didnt feel any pain or soreness.Whatever had happened to me, it hadnt been damaging in any way that I could sense.I relaxed just a little.Well, the fact that you havent medevacked me gives me some small comfort, I began.Funny you should mention that, said Qeturah ominously, because I was thinking about that option right this minute.Were on the edge of the desert.Wheres the nearest neurologist?Look, Im walking and talking, and I feel fine.Thats what you said yesterday, murmured Lian unhelpfully.Qeturah looked at Nasiha and Dllenahkh.Nasiha seemed unusually quiet to me, and Dllenahkh had a slight frown on his face.One day, Qeturah said to me, still looking at the two Sadiri as if asking for their permission.One more day, just in case all thats required is for the last of the drug to cycle out of your system.By then well be on our way to Mordecai, and they have decent medical facilities.That was satisfactory.I went back to my food.I spent the afternoon brooding over what had happened.It felt funny and not particularly nice to have this big gap in my life that everyone else seemed to know about but me.The concerned looks were beginning to wear on me.I pulled out a small, old fashioned paper journal that Qeturah had given me back when she was still trying to have me get in touch with my feelings about the Ioan business and wrote down what I could remember of my strange dreams.Then I confronted Nasiha in the shelter she shared with Tarik.I think you were very much involved in what happened, I told her frankly.Ive never seen you so subdued.Can you tell me anything?She bowed her head slightly, just enough to avoid meeting my eyes.Until your own memory returns, I think I should not.I looked at her.She had been wearing civilian clothes more often than not after our shopping trip, complaining that the Science Council maternity uniform was neither comfortable nor flattering.Wheres the cat clasp?You always wear it.I no longer have it.Please, Delarua, do not ask any more questions.I am sorry.Tarik, who had been quietly working a few meters away, suddenly put his handheld down, stood up with a face like thunder, and strode outside.I attended the Piedra debriefing, which is to say that I sat there and no one made me leave, but the conversation often seemed to weave around me as if I were merely an observer.As usual, I took notes for my own reports, but something made me take more thorough notes than usual: audio and vid recordings, several file attachments, and also little personal notes for anything I found strange or significant.For the first time ever, I had a strong desire to stay up late with the Sadiri.So, I asked Joral, what do you guys get up to when the rest of us are asleep?The Councillor and I are studying Cygnian culture, he said.Literature, art, film, history; it is very interesting.Last night we began a series on preholo cinema.Oooh, classics?Remastered, for the most part, Joral admitted.Remastered?I clutched at my heart with an agony that was only half feigned.Philistines.Might as well turn in, then, I said, and yawned for the fifth time in as many minutes.Just in case, I gave Lian the dream journal and pointed out which folders on my handheld contained my most recent notes.Then I went to bed, falling asleep far more quickly than I expected to.Of course this meant I was able to wake up early enough to see Dllenahkh off at the shuttleport, though why I should have gone out in all that damp, unhealthy fog is beyond me.To make matters worse, he was dressed oddly and talking nonsense.Ive got a job to do, too.Where Im going, you cant follow.What Ive got to do, you cant be any part of.Grace, Im no good at being noble, but But?I prompted, genuinely curious.That wasnt how it went, was it?He blinked and said in a more normal tone, Is there a purpose to my being noble in this situation?I am not convinced it is the best choice to make.The slight frown cleared from his face, he seemed to mentally shrug, and then he tilted up my chin with his forefinger.Heres looking at you, kid.He bent his head toward mine, and again, unsurprisingly, the scene immediately faded to black.Whats with that?I mumbled out loud.Delarua?Are you awake?I stretched, tangling my feet in the thin blanket over my cot.Yeah, more or less.Oh, shoot!I sat upright suddenly.Nasiha!Im sorry I overslept, but you saw what I was like last night at the meeting.No way was I going to make it to meditation this morning.She regarded me silently from her seat in a chair not far from my cot.She was already dressed for the day, of course, and there was a medical scanner in her hand, which she held poised as if about to sweep it in my direction.Which meeting would that be, Delarua?Dont you remember?The Traveling Clans issue?I replied, puzzled.I see, she said, tapping her comm.In a very short space of time, a small group had gathered around my cot: Nasiha, Dllenahkh, Qeturah, and Lian.I selfconsciously wrapped up in my blanket and gaped at them.Ive lost two days?I said incredulously.They did not argue.Nasiha showed me the date stamped medical readouts.Lian accessed my report notes on my own handheld and gave me the beginnings of a dream journal in my own handwriting.I got up, trailing the blanket behind me like a badly wrapped toga, and paced around in undershirt and shorts, staring at the items in my hands and absorbing the information.Ive lost two days, I said faintly.I felt my way back to my cot and sat down, dumping everything beside me and numbly passing a hand over my face.Whats going on?Whats happening to me?We believe that something is disrupting your ability to form long term memory, said Qeturah.Each time you go to sleep, your consciousness resets to the last event stored in long term memory.This is probably caused by a malfunction of The hippocampus, yes, I know, I mused.But that doesnt explain why Im remembering all my dreams.Qeturah and Nasiha spoke at the same time.How do you know that?You remember your dreams from last night?I looked up, surprised at their intensity.Yes, I know about the hippocampus memory thing.Didnt you tell me about that sometime, Qeturah?And yes, I remember three dreams from last night, but two of them are described in that journal.Three dreams in one night is more than a little busy, so I think I must be remembering the night before.Subconscious memory formation.I thought so, said Qeturah triumphantly.I did tell you about the hippocampus yesterday, Grace.You said you did basic neuroanatomy, but youd forgotten about that.My mind was whirling.Give me a moment.Ill be able to think more clearly once Im properly dressed.I promise, Ill come straight to the lab right afterward.I didnt, though.As I collected my thoughts, a strange idea came to me.I had never seen Casablanca.Heard of it, of course, read many a quote, even, but seen itnever.That old black and white stuff was for the real movie buffs, and in spite of my teasing Joral, I wasnt one.I wandered to their shelter in search of information to test my hypothesis.Joral, I said, tell me, what movies did you watch last night and the night before?He raised a puzzled eyebrow.Last night we saw the earliest Cygnian adaptation of Casablanca.The night before that, we watched the 3 D remake of Superman, which is famous for its interactive special effects.If you would like to join us tonight, we are thinking of viewing the original E. T. : The Extra Terrestrial.This wasnt a huge surprise.Cygnian cinema, both preholo and holo, is filled with benign aliens and refugees from war and disaster.Thank you, Joral.I smiled.Ill think about it.Dllenahkh, could I have a word with you outside?We walked a short distance from the camp to the edge of a small plateau and gazed down at a vast, barren landscape.I was reminded of the time wed huddled together, watching the savanna dogs in their den.Now we were looking at a rocky desert land, with the low towers of Piedra faintly visible in the haze of fine sand and heat.I was sorry Id missed seeing that famous city up close.So, youve been watching a lot of old movies.I glanced up at Dllenahkh.Tell meyou ever imagine me in them?Or ratherus?There was a profound silence.Dllenahkh turned to face me fully, the expression on his face somewhere between alarm and embarrassment.Why do you ask?Dont be coy.Superhero catches falling girl.Rick says good bye to Ilsa.Thats what Ive been dreaming, and thats what you and Joral have been watching!He actually paled.That would suggest that I have been influencing your dreams.Worse.Im dreaming your thoughts!And while were on the subject, what is it with those strategic blackouts?You got something against kissing?Give the Sadiri credit; even in the midst of pure, unmitigated mortification, they never stop thinking.I have it, he said suddenly.I understand what is happening to you and how to correct it.Quick, let us go to the lab.I could try to tell you what the detailed explanation was, but why bother when you can access for yourself the paper coauthored by Qeturah, Nasiha, and Tarik.Suffice it to say that my brain chemistry had been altered by the drugs I had been given, with the result that my hippocampus was no longer storing long term memory throughout the brain.It was all being stored exclusively in the hippocampal gyrus, which is the region of the brain responsible for telepathy.Coincidentally, this is also the region that I seem to be unable to access consciously, which is why I get a null result on telepathic ability.However, with the addition of another chemical from the stimulant patch, I had become a subconscious telepath.I was reading Dllenahkhs mind from a distance in my sleep.How cool is that?And were going to do what?I asked them after the detailed explanation had been repeated to me two or three times.The Councillor is going to attempt repairs when you enter REM sleep tonight, Nasiha said, her voice regaining some of its usual confident vigor.He will access the memories in your hippocampal gyrus and adjust your neurotransmitters to recommence storing memory in the usual way.I looked at Qeturah for confirmation, but she merely shook her head helplessly.Im all at sea with this telepathy business, Grace.Youre going to have to trust Dllenahkh.Well, thats a given, I said easily.It was a small thing, but the moment I said it, Tarik flashed a brief glare at Nasiha, then retreated once more behind a veneer of propriety.Because there was only one medtable and limited space, they put an extra cot in the shuttle and dotted us all over with sensors to record the unusual event.Then they turned on the environment controls, turned off the lights, and shut the door.For a short while, there was the glow of Dllenahkhs handheld as he sat on the cot and made some last minute notes.Finally he turned it off, and the darkness was absolute.I heard the cot creak slightly as he lay down.Are you going to stay awake all night?I said softly.If necessary, he replied just as quietly.I may snore, I warned after a pause.I shall try not to listen, he said with mild amusement.Is something wrong between Nasiha and Tarik?It might have seemed a nosy question, except that it came out in the plaintive tones of a child wondering why Mommy and Daddy are arguing.Tarik is struggling to find the right way to deal with a certain matter.Nasiha is concerned for him.They will be all right, Grace.There was a very long pause during which the silence rang loudly in my all too awake ears.You going to tell me about the kissing thing or not?He exhaled audibly.I suppose it was too much to hope that you would forget that.Kissing is not a Sadiri custom.To us it seemsunhygienic.And yet much of Terran romance appears to center around the practice, to the point where potential partners may even be rejected solely on the basis of a lack of proficiency in this area.Well, it is rather unhygienic, I admitted, but there are variations, you know, ranging from a kiss on the cheek to the full on, bite for blood kiss.There are plenty of Terran cultures that dont find the extreme versions attractive.Where do you fall on this spectrum of preference?he asked.For a moment I had a kind of mental stumble that made me glad Dllenahkh hadnt linked to me yet: Hes asking me how I like my kisses!Then I pulled myself together.I suppose Im a bit tame by urban standards.I prefer a no fluids approach myself, just minimal moisture at the most.I was very proud of my clinical tone.Umdoes your culture have an alternative to the kiss?I heard him sit up, felt him take my right hand.He gently uncurled my fingers and turned my palm toward him.I opened my mouth to say, Oh, yeah, that thing Nasiha and Tarik do.But the words died on my tongue.First he simply touched his fingertips to mine, which was pleasant enough.Then he lightly traced the length of my fingers, moving slowly, a low hum of sensation for the front of my hand, a warm tingle for the back.Finally, he set his palm to mine.Ohh!I exclaimed, enlightened and entranced.It felt like warm, golden lightnot the muted gold of late afternoon but something more sharply metallic, conducting its own electricity along the nerves in my hand directly to my brain and throughout my body.There was a ripple like lighthearted laughter, a more solemn surge like a deep contented sigh, and then a comforting ebb and flow like the rocking of an ocean wavevery soothingvery relaxingvery good of you to put me to bed, Councillor, I said, smothering my chagrin under a jesting tone.Memory returned to me, bright and sharp as life, but strange as dj vu in a hall of fractured mirrors.We sometimes forget that most Cygnians need at least eight hours of sleep, Dllenahkh said apologetically as he set down the last piece of baggage in the hotel lounge.In the future, we will try to arrange our meetings to take place at a more convenient hour and within a shorter time frame.Dont make promises you cant keep, Councillor, I said with a teasing grin.Then, much to my dismay, I saw Qeturah glancing in my direction as if considering whether or not to deal with me in public.I decided not to give her the chance.It was the work of a moment to slip out of the hotel with Nasiha on the pretext of a quick stop in town to take a look at a nearby craft market.I hadnt considered the extent to which clothes are protection.Ordinarily, Nasiha would have been wearing her Science Council blues and I would have been wearing one of my Civil Service uniforms, but we had both taken to wearing civilian clothes bought in that region.That must have been why they thought we were fair game.One moment we were walking down the road, and then we were gonedragged into an alley, choking rags drenched in some sedative pressed over our faces.Nasiha was too strong and too quick for them.I saw the man who grabbed her go flying over her head.At that point, I blacked out completely.When I came back to consciousness, it was in a paralyzed body.I could feel the vibration of an aircar under me, but I could neither open my eyes nor move.I heard shouts and the sound of running feet, and then I felt the sudden crush of a quick liftoff.I struggled and finally cracked open my eyes just as they picked me up by the wrists and ankles and swung me out of the open door of the rising car.The aircar hadnt risen very far, perhaps no more than five meters.If Id had the use of my limbs, I would have feared at most some contusions, a broken wrist perhaps.But I was limp and helpless, and I waited to feel all my bones break and my skull shatter on the hard ground.But thats not the way it went.I collided not with the unforgiving ground but with a pair of strong arms and a broad chest, all connected to a form and face that I knew well.You caught me, I murmured to the presence in my mind.Of course, he answered, but below the calm was the fear and wonder of having arrived in the nick of time.Nasiha?I saw an image of her, wrap torn away and face furious, spinning around helplessly in a now empty alley as the gang got away through the close gaps between the buildings like rats scurrying into a maze.I saw an image of Tarik outside the hotel, face peaceful one moment, then wide eyed with horror, sprinting away instinctively to find her via the telepathic link they shared.In three minutes, Lian and Dllenahkh drew up in a groundcar and hauled him in.Tarik found Nasiha all right, but it was Dllenahkh who found me, reaching out with all his strength to sense my half conscious awareness, as faint as the whirr of a hummingbirds wings.I was unreasonably perky when the drugs wore off.Cant remember a thing!I said cheerfully.Look at meIm walking, Im talking, Im fine!Qeturah scanned me, scowling at her instruments as they confirmed my words.Very well.But youre not coming with us to Piedra.Youre on twenty four hours rest and observation.I think Nasiha would have stayed with me if Tarik hadnt tried to order her to do so.In the end it was Lian who volunteered to watch over me.Poor Tarik, I said, thinking of his silent shows of anger and understanding at last how even a Sadiri, especially a Sadiri, could be almost incapacitated by fear for the well being of his wife and unborn child.
