Run!he shouted, grabbing Aradels arm and dragging her to her feet.They ran in the direction of the settlement.The tunnel behind them exploded and began to cave in as the aliens bombed it from above.Ivan was the first to reach the door at the far side as more explosions rang out behind them.He pulled the latch which led directly into a stairwell.They dashed after him as the tunnel completely collapsed.Ethan slammed the door and latched it shut.An instant later the door buckled from the pressure of the cave in on the other side.That cuts off our escape, said Ajax flatly.Where to from here?asked Michael, looking to Aradel.These stairs lead into the engineering building.We will have to cross an open space to the main life support building.The vault is situated in one of the subterranean levels of the life support building.We are going to be out in the open with a legion of aliens, said Ajax as he lifted a hipflask to his lips.You shouldnt drink when were on a mission, snapped Cynthia.The last thing we need is a drunk.Ajax shook his head and smirked.This just might be my last drink.I saved this Ludicrous Lava for a special occasion, he said as he took another swig.Enough!We have to make a move, said Michael.The aliens may think we are dead, but they will want to be sure.We dont have time to waste.Lets go.Michael quickly ascended the stairwell, holding his rifle ready as he progressed.At the top of the stairs they came to a metal door.Ajax, Ethan and Ivan pointed their rifles at the door as Michael heaved it open.Directly ahead of them was a large enclosed room containing a variety of factory machines.The power was out and the only light was the reddish glow which issued down from glass portholes in the roof.The main door was directly across the far side of the room.Lets go, whispered Michael.Keep your eyes open.Michael was the first to enter.He made his way across the room to the door.They followed closely behind him.There was a small glass viewing panel which was only a few inches across and mostly covered in red dust.He peered through the glass; four aliens were standing in the open.They were all about five feet in height.Their heads looked too big for their bodies and their skinny legs bent forward at the knees.They were wearing silicone based synthetic alien war armour, which was a living suit that covered their bodies like an outer layer of skin; the suits were a few inches in width and dark grey in colour with a surface that looked like exposed flesh.The battle suits strengthened the aliens, increased their running speed, and could repel indirect plasma, particle beams or conventional projectiles.Each alien was carrying a standard alien plasma gun, which were highly advanced weapons with automatic targeting capability.Across from the aliens was the entrance to the life support building.Michael knew they would have to fight if they opened the door.Aliens, he whispered, looking back at the others.We have to fight our way to the vault.Ready when you are, Cap, said Ajax as he pointed his rifle and armed the attached grenade launcher.The team lifted their weapons in readiness.Michael signalled and then pulled the door open.Hello everyone!growled Ajax as he opened fire.A moment later all their rifles were blazing.The scene lit up as the aliens attempted to take cover.Three of them were instantly killed, and the last leapt behind a pile of rocks.Within a second the alien started firing back.Streams of plasma whistled by.They took cover behind the edge of the door.Ajax returned fire, but the alien was safe behind the rocks.Dog Two growled and charged forward, leaping over the rock.The alien screamed as Dog Twos massive jaw clamped around its neck, ending its life in an instant.Come on, yelled Michael.He ran out into the open.Ajax and Cynthia followed, and the others were not far behind.Instantly they were surrounded by crossfire as more aliens were converging on their position.Ajax launched grenades in all directions as his rifle unleashed.Cynthia fired her rocket launcher.Michael raced for the life support building door.Within a moment he had grabbed the handle, ripping it open.He turned to survey the scene.Dozens of aliens were advancing.Several blasts smashed into the wall beside him.The team, one by one, dashed into the life support building as Michael and Ajax fired back at the aliens.Ajax, get inside, shouted Michael.You first, Cap, said Ajax with a half smile as he unloaded grenade after grenade.Michael backed away into the building, and Ajax slammed the door as he followed.They were standing in a large room with a concrete floor.A stairwell led directly down to the underground levels.There were only a few metal boxes in the room.Damn it!The door doesnt have a lock, said Ajax.We only have a few seconds.Michael turned to Aradel.Hurry!Get to the vault.We have to go down the stairs to the lowest level.It will take me a couple minutes to open the vault once we arrive, said Aradel.You could have told us that before, said Ajax as he loaded another magazine into his rifle.Im sorry, said Aradel.We have to hold the aliens back until she opens the vault.Ill hold them as long as I can, said Ajax.Cap, we cant return this way.Is there another way out of the building?asked Michael.There is a service shaft with a ladder that leads up from the lower level and opens at the back of the building, said Aradel.An explosion rang out and the door blasted off its hinges.Ajax fired into the opening.Get out of here!he shouted and streams of plasma lit up the room.Aradel dashed down the stairs and the others followed.Ajax took cover behind a large metal box and continued to fire out through the door.His rifle was blazing and every few seconds he shot a grenade through the open doorway.The stairs took them down to the main sleeping quarters where they found another set of stairs that led into complete darkness.Ethan fired a flare into the lower level.They made their way down and entered a large room with metal walls and a concrete floor.The room was full of boxes of supplies for the colony.Michael scanned the area; he could see the ladder against the right hand wall that led to the exit shaft.Aradel crossed the room to the wall at the far side.She placed her hand against the metal and nothing seemed to happen.The lock is connected to a hidden sensor in the wall, she said.I have to hold my hand on the wall for sixty seconds without breaking contact.Its the only way to release the lock.They waited; the seconds dragged by.Michaels wrist com beeped.Cap, theyve taken out the entire wall.I cant hold them much longer.This place is as hot as hell said Ajax.Fall back to the stairwell, said Michael.Im trapped behind this damn metal box.Theyve got me hemmed in.I cant break coverLeave meIm not getting out of this one alive  Michael turned back toward the stairs and loaded a fresh magazine into his rifle.A surge of adrenaline rushed through his body.Im going back up there.Once you free the colonists get up the ladder and contact Sara to extract you.Dont wait for me.He lifted his wrist com.Ajax, Im coming to get you.Cap, Im hit.Its really bad.Im losing blood  Just hold on.SEVEN      Cynthia and Dog Two followed him as he ascended the stairs.He glanced back over his shoulder.Cynthia, leave this to me.Go with the others.I dont want to leave anyone, not even Ajax.Youre going to need my help carrying him, she replied firmly.Michael stared into her eyes for a moment.All right, Cynthia, but dont be afraid when the time comes.Im not afraid, she replied.All right then, follow me.They ascended the stairwell and reached the level above.Michael quickly climbed the second stairwell and held his rifle ready.He reached the top of the stairs and could see Ajax crouched behind a large metal box.He was bleeding from a wound in his upper chest and another just above his right knee.He was still clutching his rifle and firing back at the aliens.The entire front wall had collapsed and several aliens were firing from outside the building as others were advancing on Ajax.Dog Two growled and bared his teeth as Michael dashed around the corner.He opened fire as Dog Two charged across the room and brought down one of the aliens.A small rocket exploded beside Dog Two, sending him flying back across the floor and crashing heavily into the far wall.Cynthia sprinted toward Ajax and grabbed his arm.Come on!she yelled as she lifted him up off the floor.He held on, his arm across her shoulders, as she heaved him back toward the stairs.Bright streams of plasma blasted past them.The gaping wound above his knee was preventing him from walking on his own.His face was pale; he had lost a lot of blood.His head was hanging and he was struggling to keep his eyes open.Michael headed back toward the stairs as Cynthia helped Ajax down the stairwell.Dog Two followed.They reached the level below.Michael lifted his wrist com.Ivan, are you still in the building?No, Captain, we freed the trapped colonists, and we are heading for the south side of the settlement to meet Sara.The aliens know about the exit shaft.You will have to locate an alternative exit  Damn it.Michael held his rifle ready and waited.What are you waiting for?asked Cynthia.We cant climb the ladder.The aliens know about the shaft.The only way out is the way we came in.But there are too many aliens!she said.We dont have time.Ajax has lost too much blood!Hes losing consciousness!Michael could see the shadows of the aliens entering the stairwell.He closed his eyes and remembered back.Vivid memories of his home world flowed through his mind.Epheria Prime, home of the Epherian Emperor, the prize of the Epherian Empire, and the first world to be colonised in the Triangulum Galaxy.He was standing at the height of the imperial palace at the centre of a large circular terrace which was made entirely of white marble stone.The bright blue sky glowed above.He was only ten years old.Standing not far away from him was a tall and strong man wearing a long black cloak.His head was entirely bald, his face angular, and his skin was dark brown.His strong and dark eyes were staring down at Michael.You must always seek the silent place in your mind, said Gereon.A time will come when an endless calamity will descend on the galaxy.I will teach you to return to the silence.In the silence you will find the answers.Gereon, why must I learn such things?he heard his young voice ask.We dont need the Lore of the Ancients.It has been more than twelve thousand years since humanity arrived in the Triangulum Galaxy.Surely the End Machine would have found us by now.The machine will never come.These lessons are a waste of time.A waste of time you say, said Gereon, looking sternly down at the young boy.Yes, nothing but a waste of time, repeated Michael, proud of his own certainty.Gereon turned his back and took several steps away.The End Machine has not forgotten us.One day it will come and when it does everything will change.It took little more than a year for the machine to destroy every human world in our former galaxy.Humanity had no answer.One day someone will have to stand against the machine; the Council of Ancients knew this.You, Michael, must accept your place in the cosmos; you must learn the Lore of the Ancients as it was taught to your ancestors.If you refuse the day of destruction will come and all you know and love will be taken from you.But why cant I use the power now?You teach me these skills, yet you tell me to keep the power to myself.Your powers are very dangerous.Your power, if misused, would one day corrupt you.The Lore of the Ancients requires you to keep your powers hidden until the day the machine arrives in our galaxy, and if the machine does not arrive in your time then you, and the next teacher, must pass the Lore of the Ancients to your descendent.The Lore of the Ancients was developed for one reason: to defeat the End Machine.You can only use your powers to save yourself if there is no other way.Michael suddenly opened his eyes and returned his attention to the stairwell.The aliens were approaching.He lowered his rifle.We cant give up!said Cynthia.Im not giving up, he said as he focused.Three aliens came into view.Michael stared into their dark eyes as they made their way down the steps.They stopped in their tracks and pointed their weapons directly at him, but they didnt fire.For a moment they watched him.The walls began to tremble and shake as the dim light in the room flickered.Cynthia watched Michael as she held Ajax who had already lost consciousness.She thought her mind was playing a trick.Michael appeared to be transparent.The light in the room was passing directly through his body.The floor was vibrating and the concrete walls were shaking.The aliens stood frozen in place and were transfixed by Michael as he stepped toward them.They stepped back and fired their weapons.Michael disappeared from sight and reappeared directly behind the aliens.He grabbed one of them by the neck and the creature screamed in horror as its life force drained from its body.He cast aside the dead alien and turned to face the two others.They dropped their weapons and ran for their lives.One of the aliens let out a shrill scream.Michael raised his hand and the hideous creature reached up and grasped its head in pain.It fell and tumbled down the stairs.The other alien suffered the same fate a second later.Michael disappeared again and reappeared where he was originally standing at the bottom of the steps.The light returned to normal and the walls stopped trembling.We have to go, he said as he helped Cynthia lift Ajax off the floor.What did you do?I saw you disappear.The aliens, theyre dead!Theyre not all dead; only those inside the building.Cynthia, dont speak of this to anyone, he said as they ascended the steps with Dog Two following closely.But what happened?she asked.That was impossible.I cant explain, he answered as they reached the top room.Michael lifted his wrist com.Sara, we need an extraction.Im just taking off at the south side of the settlement.Ive taken some heavy hits from the alien mobile artillery gun, Captain.The electronic shield is less than fifteen percent.I have to stay back; otherwise they will destroy the ship.Im sorry, Captain, you have to get clear of the settlement before I can extract you  We will have to fight our way out.Do you have a preferred landing site?he asked stoically.On the south side of the rocky hill.Near where I dropped you off  Ill contact you when we get there.Michael turned to Cynthia.Ajax was unconscious on the floor.He knew that they wouldnt be able to carry him out of the settlement and simultaneously fight the aliens, and he could see that Ajax would not survive long enough to reach the outskirts.We have to leave Ajax behind, he said.The words were painful to say, but he knew that there was no other way.But hes not dead yet, Captain, and there is no way Im leaving anyone behind!I would rather stay here and die with him!We have to go.Cant you use your magic?I saw what you did to those aliens.You can save us.Michael lowered his eyes.I already took a great risk doing what I did, a much greater risk than you can possibly understand.What risk?You saved us once.Save us again!Captain, please!Michael closed his eyes and silenced his mind.He looked into time and space and could feel the darkness was drawing nearer.He could sense the End Machine was searching for him.It was reaching out across the galaxy.Using his powers had sent a signal through the stars.Using them again would be like shining a light beacon in the night and would surely reveal his location.The machine would descend on the entire region and hunt him down.He wasnt ready for such a fight; he had never finished his training.His mind was weak compared to the incredible power of the End Machine.The End Machine had been searching for him ever since the day he was exiled from the Epherian Empire.Hiding his powers was the only way he could hide himself.Cynthia, close your eyes.Dont open them until I say.You will feel intense pain, but it wont last.What are you going to do?she asked in a low voice.I will save us, he replied sternly.He lifted his wrist com.Sara, take the Out Drifter as far as you can away from the settlement.Captain, Im still planning to collect the three of you  Go, Sara.Thats an order.Go now or the ship will be destroyed....But, Captain!...Sara, you have to!Yes, Captain  Michael lifted his right hand and the tips of his fingers began to glow.Beams of bright light blasted out in every direction.He concentrated and could sense the entire environment surrounding the building.His mind expanded further and he could see the aliens were preparing to attack with heavy rocket launchers.He strained with all his might as he began converting matter into energy.He closed his eyes as a shockwave of raw energy was unleashed throughout the settlement.Cynthia screamed and felt the pain as he drew her, Ajax and Dog Two into another spacial dimension.The entire settlement became an inferno.A flash of blinding white light ripped apart the life support building and all the surrounding buildings.The nuclear inferno instantly incinerated the aliens and their weapons.Everything was on fire, and a massive shockwave spread outward from the settlement.For at least a minute they were surrounded by intense heat and flames; but the flames, radiation and raw energy passed directly through their bodies without causing them any harm.They were like ghosts in a horrific scene of fire and smoke.Michael held them back for as long as he could.He strained to the limits of his strength.He then had to release them as he couldnt hold them back any longer.They transitioned back into normal three dimensional space and waited among the ruins as the residual radiation and heat scorched them.Cynthia opened her eyes and looked around at the scene of destruction.Plumes of smoke rose up from the ruined settlement.Everything around them was on fire.It was a scene of utter devastation.Sara, he spoke as his vision was fading.Captain, there has been an explosion.Are you all right?...The aliens are gone.You can safely land the ship.Come and get us.EIGHT      What happened down there?Were you carrying nuclear weapons?asked Ethan.I wasnt, replied Michael as he sat up.Ivan had been treating their injuries in the cargo bay since they had been collected from the blast zone.He was using the handheld skin refabricator to treat their burns.Ajax had been placed in deep sleep as the available medical equipment was not able to treat his severe injuries and could only prevent him from dying.They intended to take him to the nearest advanced medical unit as soon as possible.Ethan had an injured left arm which was covered by an advanced wound dressing.The wound dressing released painkillers whilst nano bots worked on subduing the bleeding and healing the damaged tissue.I dont understand, said Ethan, shaking his head.And I have no idea how you survived the blast.You were at the central point of the explosion; you should have been vaporised, but here you are, and you only have some minor burns.What happened?Thats what I want to know, said Sara as she stepped into the cargo bay.I saw the entire station light up.The explosion destroyed everything within a radius of five kilometres.I thought you were dead, Captain, and then a few minutes later you are on the com asking for me to come and get you.Your survival defies the laws of physics.How did you survive the explosion?Michael didnt answer.He looked over to where Cynthia was sitting against the wall.She was staring directly at him, bewilderment and shock evident in her eyes.Sara turned to Cynthia.What happened, Cynthia?Even if I could say I wouldnt know how to explain what I saw, and he told me not to tell you, replied Cynthia.Saras eyes darted back to Michael.You have to tell me whats going on.Captain, you have to explain.Michael lay back down and stared up at the ceiling.Its better that you dont know, Sara, he said in a low voice.The only thing thats important at this moment is that we get as far away from Herman Beta as we possibly can.When we arrive at Zeno Par and find Acacius Trifon I will explain everything.I reset the course to Zeno Par, said Sara.I have already revealed too much, but I will tell you this much.Your minds are like beacons in the darkness of space; your thoughts are not hidden from prying eyes.What are you trying to say?asked Sara, raising an eyebrow.There are no machines that can read thoughts directly.We have not reached that level of technological advancement yet; nevertheless, our ancient ancestors were far more advanced than us, said Michael.They developed machines beyond any we know of.Their technological knowledge was hidden from humanity at the time of the first arrival in the Triangulum Galaxy in order to stop us ever developing such machines again.Are you saying these machines exist in the Triangulum Galaxy?asked Ethan.You may have heard of the time before humanity arrived in this galaxy.One machine rose up and turned against humanity.The human race faced imminent extinction.We escaped our former galaxy, yet that machine has searched for us for thousands of years.It is a singular consciousness with power beyond imagining.The End Machine will not rest until it has consumed us all.**  An enormous swirling shadow was advancing through space at a blistering rate.It sucked out the light and energy of stars as it made its way toward Herman Beta.The shadow had detected a glimmer of light across the galactic expanse.Such light would need to be extinguished before it could grow in power and brightness.**  They had rescued four young colonists from the vault on Herman Beta 3.Ivan and Cynthia had prepared a meal for them, as they were clearly malnourished.We didnt think anyone would ever come for us, said Harry, a scrawny boy with blond hair.We had two rifles and three magazines.We were making plans to leave the vault and fight our way out.You wouldnt have survived the fight, said Aradel.Im glad you waited to be rescued.We are all that is left of our colony, and if it wasnt for the crew of this ship we would not have survived.What will we do now?asked Becker, who was a fifteen year old girl with tanned skin and cropped hair.Captain Michael has agreed to take us to Zeno Par, said Aradel.From there we will find a transport to a civilised world where we can start over.We have suffered, but soon we will be safe.I promise.**  The Out Drifter felt very crowded.Michael decided the sleeping pods were the only way to escape the confines of the ship and the relentless questions of the crew about the events on Herman Beta.The End Machine was a multidimensional singular consciousness.It could read the minds of people across the dimensions of space and could examine the thoughts of billions of people at once.Michael pondered the question as to why the machine had not yet destroyed humanity.He had been aware of the presence of the End Machine ever since he had been cast out of the Epherian Empire, yet he could not understand why it was holding back.It had the power to wipe out the human race, but for some reason the machine had chosen to hide its presence and wait.He hoped Acacius had the answers.Acacius Trifon was a teacher of the Lore of the Ancients; he was the only man in the galaxy who could help Michael fight the End Machine.**  Cynthia sat on the floor in the back corner of the cargo bay.She was staring at the wall as she tried to process what had occurred.She replayed the events in her mind over and over again but she still couldnt make sense of what she had witnessed.She knew one thing was true; Michael was not a normal man, and it was questionable as to whether he was a man at all.Whats troubling you, Cynthia?asked Sara.Cynthia lifted her eyes; Sara was looking down at her.Its the Captain, she muttered.What do you think he meant when he spoke about advanced machines?I dont know, replied Cynthia.Cynthia, we both know what happened on Herman Beta 3 was impossible.People cant survive an explosion like that.What did you see?I cant say.What I saw doesnt make sense.It wasnt scientifically possible.What doesnt make sense?What wasnt possible?asked Sara.I really cant say, said Cynthia, averting her eyes.Cynthia, tell me.Cynthia slowly lifted her eyes.I think Captain Michael is not human.He has strange powers.What!exclaimed Sara, involuntarily stepping back.She glanced over her shoulder at Michaels deep sleep pod.You think hes an alien?I cant explain it, but what he did cant be done by a normal human being.Did Michael cause the explosion?Cynthia nodded, and Saras eyes widened in shock.How did he save you from the blast?He has abilities, Sara.He can do strange things.His hands were glowing like a bright star.I had to look away because the light was so intense.He caused the explosion, and he protected us from the blast.Aliens cant cause nuclear explosions with their bare hands, said Sara sternly.**  The glass cover slid off Michaels sleeping pod and he woke instantly.Ivan was standing beside him.We are approaching Zeno Par.How is the ship?Operational.Thats good to hear, said Michael as he sat up.Michael and Ethans sleeping pods had opened at once.Ivan had left Aradel and the young colonists sleeping in their pods.Sara and Cynthia had chosen not to sleep for the duration of the journey and they gave their pods to the colonists.Michael walked down to the control room as his body recovered from deep sleep.Sara was sitting in the pilots seat.An image of Zeno Par was in the centre of one of the console monitors.She glanced over her shoulder and gave a smile as he stepped through the door.Did you sleep well?Yes, thanks, he answered in a gravelly voice as he sat down in the co pilot seat.She hit the holographic projector.A three dimensional image of Zeno Par rose from the console and floated directly in front of them.Its a prime world with pristine forests and oceans full of life.The gravity is rated at 0.98.The planet was owned by the Epherian Empire up until they left the sector.The majority of the population left over the last year because of the expansion of alien controlled space.Zeno Pars territory borders the alien battle zone.They are waiting to be invaded.There are five major cities.The population stands at two hundred million; thats a fraction of what it used to be.I dont know how you plan to find your friend or where you want to land.I should be able to find him once we arrive, he said.With your powers?she asked, looking at him out of the corner of her eye.What powers?Cynthia told me what happened on Herman Beta 3.I dont know anyone who can cause nuclear explosions with their bare hands.Cynthia told you, he said, looking away.I pressured her until she did.Dont blame her, Captain.Shes a good woman.I know she is.Are you human?she asked nervously.Michael leaned back in his seat and smiled warmly.Of course I am.If you really are human and its not magic then what is it?He didnt answer for a moment.I cant explain what I did, Sara.I knew you were going to say something like that.Sara, please understand me; these are important matters.The survival of the human race hangs in the balance.I will tell you everything when it is safe to do so, but first we have to find Acacius Trifon.Everything will become clear when we find him.Sara nodded and returned her attention to the hologram of Zeno Par.NINE      The Out Drifter descended through the wispy clouds of Zeno Pars upper atmosphere.Sara turned the ship toward Oceanside City, which was a massive metropolis set on the eastern coastline of the main continent.The city expanded inland for hundreds of miles and thousands of spires and towers rose up to heights beyond the lowest level of clouds.Sara hit the switch for the Out Drifters external com.Oceanside City Watchtower; this is the Out Drifter; Interworld code AMB712; mandated by the Outer World Salvage Guild.We request a class four landing dock.Greetings, Out Drifter.This is watchtower seventy one.You have clearance.Proceed to landing dock seven thousand, six hundred and five.The fee for a class four landing dock is set at sixty guild credits for twenty four hours  Thank you.The Out Drifters landing navigation computer connected with the watchtowers signal and started to guide the ship down toward the city.Before long they were flying through towering spires and skyscrapers.The sun reflected off the glimmering blue ocean which extended beyond the horizon.The flight path took the ship deep down into the lower levels of the city and guided them toward a landing dock.The lower levels of the city were shrouded in the shadows of the massive skyscrapers and were occupied by poorer residential areas and an assortment of dingy bars and clubs.The area was also where the cheapest landing docks were located.The Out Drifter glided down and entered an area which was almost devoid of natural light.The glow of many multi coloured neon signs cut through the thick smog and gave the city an eerie feeling.The ship entered a large opening in the side of a building.There was a wide concrete platform within the building with ten bays for ships to land.The navigation computer gently set the Out Drifter down and the engine powered off.Michael walked back to the cargo bay.Ethan, Ivan, Cynthia and Dog Two were standing beside the exit door.Aradel and the four colonist teenagers were standing at the other side of the room.Aradel approached as Michael entered.I want to thank you and your crew for saving us, Captain Michael.You really put your lives on the line and risked so much to secure our safety.Im glad we could help.We will be leaving your company now, she continued.I have heard that Zeno Par is a good planet, but the open information networks are reporting that the aliens are coming, so we plan to leave as soon as we can to avoid the invasion.Where do you think you will go from here?asked Michael.We will take the first available transport to the Green Home System.Michael nodded.He had heard of the Green Home System.The Green Home worlds were ruled by a benevolent government.Its a good choice.You should do well if you go in that direction, and Green Home is not in the path of the alien expansion.We may have a year or two of peace before we have to move on, she said.I wish you all the best.He then turned to Ivan as Sara walked into the cargo bay.Ivan, I want you to help find a transport for Aradel, Conner, Davis, Harry and Becker.You can pay for their passage from my personal account.After theyre safely away I want you to return to the ship and take Ajax to an advanced medical lab and get him back on his feet.Ill go with Cynthia and Dog Two to find Acacius Trifon.You dont have to pay for our journey, said Aradel.We didnt risk our lives to leave you strandard on a planet in the direct path of the alien fleet.I want to be sure you get away safely.Aradel respectfully bowed her head.Thank you once again, Captain Michael.Meeting you and your crew has been a blessing for us.
