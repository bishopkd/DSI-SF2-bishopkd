What it did do, though, was to enhance the feeling that Infinity were starting to close in, that with every day their grip was slowly tightening.It started me thinking: maybe itd be possible to get through the fires now?The only reason we were all still there was Lena.The others didnt need to stay, especially not Jimmy, with all the problems he had, not to mention Delilahs one lung still sawing away at that solid wall of smoke.Why didnt they just go on and leave me to find a way of rescuing Lena?But when I tried to raise the subject, no one would even hear me out.Of course, I was touched, I truly was, but some people mightve thought it was a little foolish.Everything felt so hopeless noweven the length of time since Id last seen Lena was starting to work against me.Maybe she didnt wanna be rescued anymore?Maybe things had changed?...I dunno.Lying propped on my side on that sleeping bag for hour after hour, I was imagining all sorts of crazy stuff.Which was why a visit from Gigi, something she brought with her, couldnt have been more timely.She appeared that afternoon, not bothering with any greeting, just strolling up and handing me a piece of paper.I stared at her as I unfolded it, having no idea what it might be, but the moment I started to read, it was all I could do not to break into tears.My love, I dont know if youll ever read this.I think whoevers smuggling it out is taking a big risk, but I have to grab this opportunity.You have no idea how much I miss you.There isnt a minute goes by when Im not thinking of you.I dont know whats going on, or why they took me.I hear the occasional whisper, but people are too scared to say much.Even Dr.Simon wont tell me.All he says is Im special.Theyre treating me okay, dont worry about that.Whatevers happening, Im sure, when its over, well be together again and finally able to make our home in the country.Im sorry, I cant write any more.No matter what happens, Clancy, I will always love you.Nothing can ever change that.Lena PS Do you know Nora Jagger?Whatever you do, dont go up against her.I have to say, for a while there was quite a wrestling match went on between me and my tear ducts, and I only won cuz I was so surprised by something shed said.Doesnt she know?I said, turning to Gigi.What?That shes pregnant?Gigi shrugged.Dunno.You have to get word to her!She glared at me with real aggressionthe Island blade abruptly flicking open.Do you know how hard it was to get this out?Yeahsorry, I said.I am grateful.Shes a woman!If she doesnt know yet, shell work it out soon enough.I nodded my head, though I wasnt entirely sure what she meant.I guessed she was talking about having a period but...I thought...if a woman got stressed or went through a big change of routine or something, might she miss the odd one?Which could be confusing.Mind you, Im just a dumb old big guy who never had a real girlfriend before Lena, and for sure I wasnt asking for clarification from some kid with seagull feathers in her hair.I read the letter again, studying it more closely.For the first time since it happened, the pain in my ass was entirely forgotten.Whats with this Nora Jagger woman?I asked.It was funny, even though Gigi paused for only the briefest of moments, you knew that somewhere in there was a whole world of information.Some people call her the Executioner.Thats legal?Delilah asked.Not officially, but accidents do happen when shes around.People die of injuries sustained alone in cells, commit suicide when they have everything to live for, fall outta locked windows, that sort of thing.Jesus, I muttered.The thought that Lena was apparently familiar with this woman was not sitting well at all.She had all her arms and legs cut off, Gigi suddenly announced.What?Delilah grimaced.Well, not exactly...she lost an arm in an accidentsurvival trainingand had an artificial one specially made.It can do anything a normal one can but its ten times stronger.She liked it so much, she had her other arm and legs replaced.I stared at her, not exactly sure what my reaction should be.You dont believe that?Yeah.I do.Come onits just talk, people trying to build themselves a demon.Gigi firmly shook her head.I dont think so.I chuckled like I was dismissing it, but not with complete conviction.Just from seeing that face on the screen, those eyes, I wasnt sure Id put anything past Nora Jagger.Howdya get the letter out?I asked, changing the subject.Gigi shrugged.Cant tell you.Hanna sniggered, like it was all a bit absurd.What?Gigi demanded, and I immediately stepped in between them.Okay, okay!Thank you.I gotta go, Gigi said, glaring at Hanna as if she was the reason.Gordie stood to walk her out, the way he always did now.What is it with you two?I asked Hanna, the moment they were out of earshot.Nothing, she said, as if she didnt have a clue what I was talking about.I thought about pursuing the subject but instead returned my attention to the letter, reading it again, even checking for a smudge of something, a crumb maybe, anything that would connect it with my Lena.It wouldnt be fair to say that Jimmy (or should that be Jimy?)sulked for the next few days, though he did keep to himself in a way Id never seen before.He barely said a word over meals, only spoke when spoken to, and the moment he could, sneaked away to be alone.Delilah and the kids did the scavenging, bringing back what they could, though they werent exactly a formidable team and on a couple of occasions the stuff theyd spent all day finding got stolen from them.My ass was beginning to heal and I started doing some exercises to free it up a little.It wasnt exactly stimulating, but at least it gave me something to think about rather than endlessly brooding on Lena.I watched the screen a couple more times, as much to get another look at Nora Jagger, to see what she was up to, as anything.Shed obviously decided to take over the search for Jimy herself, suggesting that no one else could be trusted.I tell ya, that woman looked so damn vicious, so cold blooded, I could see how rumors about her would circulate, and why people would believe thembut surely no one would deliberately have their limbs removed?Especially when you think of those unfortunate enough to suffer that through no choice of their own.Itd be a damned insult.Its an unusual circumstance for a killer to make it to the top job.Normally they just stay doing what theyre good at (the ultimate dead end job?), hopefully keeping their impulses in check.But if somehow they do manage to reach a position of authority, a place where their power can give vent to their instinct, well, thats where the problems really start.And from what Id seen of Nora Jagger, that was whatd happened here.I didnt know a lot about her, but I did know enough to see why Lena had warned me.Yet again, like some mindless mantra, she referred to Jimy as Public Enemy Number One, the arch terrorist, the brains behind this highly destructive anarchy, not the sad little baldy guy whos been hiding out in a corner of a flattened churchyard.But Jimmys not the sort of person to hide himself away for long; theres nothing very constructive about feeling sorry for yourself, and I wasnt altogether surprised when he finished breakfast one morning by asking everyone if they had anything to contribute to his new disguise and borrowed a baseball cap from Gordie, a scarf from Hanna and Delilahs parka.Lile protested, of course, but not that loudly.She knew he had to do something.Like me, shed never seen the little guy so down, and if that was the cure, then she was prepared to reluctantly go along with it.After that he went out almost every daynot for long, nor that far, but enough to prove a point to himself, if not others, returning with food or water, some little gizmo thatd caught his eye.Like the rest of us he was getting by but inside feeling hopelessly impotent, no longer capable of making things happen, blinding our faith and placing it in the care of God and the ticking of the clock.I cant tell you how surprised I was the day Gordie came home with Dorkus.He kind of shuffled in, looking all self conscious, glancing behind him with this excited little smile.Everyone looked over, wondering what on earth was going on, and suddenly there was this dog peering out from behind a bush: a little gray, wiry terrier type with big brown eyes staring out from behind a long tousled fringe.Ohhh!Where dya get him?Delilah cried excitedly.I just saw him, Gordie said casually, like such things happened all the time.Up near the Square.Here, boy!Here!Delilah called, and the dog slowly made his way over, a little uncertainly, and tolerated rather than enjoyed Delilahs enthusiastic petting.This is Dorkus, Gordie said proudly Thats his name?Delilah asked, a little perturbed.Its what I call him.Hes mine.With that, and despite the fact that she made it a strict policy never to show any interest in anything Gordie said or did, Hanna completely melted, leaping across, falling on her knees, cooing and scratching the dogs ears.Hey, now just a moment, I said, knowing I was about to make myself about as popular as the traffic cop who booked Santa, we cant keep him.Why not?Gordie wailed.Clancy!Delilah chimed, joining in the protest.No!Im sorryits more trouble than its worth.A stray dog?Hanna asked.Its okay, Big Guy, Jimmy reassured me.No, its not!Dogs bark, I told them, just in case they didnt know.They dont understand when you tell them to hide or be quietand its another mouth to feed.Clancy!Look at him, Delilah protested as the dog glanced from one face to another, plainly wondering what the hell was going on.Im not getting rid of him, Gordie said, and the dog, as if realizing he was his most likely savior, circled around and pushed himself in between Gordies legs.Nooo!Hanna moaned, siding with Gordie for possibly the first time ever.Im sorry.We dont have a choice, I told them.What if someone comes sniffing around one night?Some bounty hunter looking for Jimmy?Can you guarantee that thing isnt gonna give us away?Its a bit unlikely, Jimmy said.It could happen!If he goes, so do I, Gordie said defiantly.Clancy!Delilah protested.There was a brief silence.I mean, I hate being the bad guy, but I couldnt see why they didnt get my point.Why dont we have a vote?Hanna eventually suggested.Yeah!agreed Gordie, pretty confident hed win.No.Were not having any vote, I told them.Hes gotta go.There was a long pause, and Delilah kinda cleared her throat.Clancy, weve always been a democracy.Oh Jeez!Id known I was open to that charge.I also suspected that something about that dog, his tousled fringe and big brown eyes, just might be reminding her of Arturo.Let him stay!The first sign of trouble, hes out of here, she begged.That first sign might be Jimmy with a bullet in his head.Thanks, Big Guy, Jimmy told me.Thats made me feel a whole lot better about the whole thing.Im just trying to get the seriousness of this over to you!Again there was silence, only this time it was set a lot harder.You could see how upset Gordie was: his eyes were all wild and staring and he wouldnt meet my gaze at all.Hanna bent down to pet the dog again.Hes so cute.Let him stay, Clancy, Delilah urged.I just shook my head.As far as I was concerned, I was done with talking.Just for the night, she added.I knew what she was up to.Its the oldest trick in the bookI tried the same one when I was a kidbut this was different.Its asking for trouble, I insisted.The fact that I didnt actually say no, that my voice softened a little, was taken as sufficient encouragement for Delilah to start looking out some scraps for the animal.I hesitated, feeling we were far from done but aware of all these pairs of eyes turned on me, about to unleash a salvo of protest and guilt.All right, I sighed.Just for the night, thats all.I dont think they heard anything else I said.The only thing that mattered was that for the moment at least, Id withdrawn my objection.For the rest of the day, and the evening too, little Dorkus was treated like canine royalty, passed from one person to another, everyone taking their turn to pat or stroke him, getting this dopey smile about them, though I pointedly declined.Not that he was that affectionatehe didnt object or nothing, but he did give the impression he couldve done without the fuss.I guessed hed had to toughen up on the streets.Mind you, he was something of a novelty.You gotta remember, you didnt see dogs anymore.Like so many things, family pets had become a liability: feeding them, vets bills, all of it contributed toward people, not selling them, cuz no one would buy, but just abandoning them wherever they could.And not just dogs either: cats, rabbits, ponies, even large reptiles had been left to wander the Citycourse, they quickly disappeared, most dying of starvation, some of disease, and quite a few getting killed and eaten.To see a domesticated dog wandering around was quite something, especially for kids from the Island, which made me feel even more of a heel.When we bedded down, Gordie squeezed little Dorkus into his sleeping bag with him, everyone laughing fit to bust, not in a teasing way, but just as an expression of how cute they looked together.Though Gordie took great pains to point out that Dorkus was a survivor, a tough little mutt, and no one should forget it.Hey now, look, I said, getting a little frustrated by this happy family scene, just remember: no decisions been made.Clancy!Delilah protested, like shed assumed it had.No!I said impatiently.Well discuss it in the morning.The last thing I saw as Jimmy turned off the camping light was Gordie disappearing down into his sleeping bag, two bumps, one large, one small, joining together.I mean, he was a cute little fella, I could see the attraction all right, but I could also see the risks.The ironyand it made a rock grow in my heart every time I thought about itwas that by now I looked on Gordie as a kinda son, and there I was behaving in exactly the same manner as my father once had with me: a man whose abilities as a parent Ive constantly called into question.I dont know how old I was at the timeeight or so, maybe.This guy I knew, Lennie, a real down and out, had been sleeping on the same bench in the park for as long as anyone could remember, most days just dozing, but occasionally trying to earn a few coins playing his harmonica.He had this dog, Buster, a bit like Gordies mutt but rangier, with legs that stuck out at odd angles.He was the most loyal animal you could ever imagine.When Lennie died of TB he sat by that same bench every day for months.They sent the dog catcher, all sorts of people to impound him, but no one could, and the moment they gave up he returned to sit next to his masters bench.But the thing was, he knew me: he didnt run when he saw me approaching, he even let me pat him, and when I noticed he was getting a little thin, I started to bring him food.It went on for ages; through the summer and into the winter.Then one day, after I fed him and went to walk away, I turned to see him following.That night we had some of the deepest snow in years and I reckon Buster mustve known it was coming.The only thing was, my old man hated dogshe hated all animals.He used to get so angry when people said there was no such thing as a bad dog, only bad owners, said it was arrogant for us to assume we had one hundred percent control of how a dog turned out, which actually, does have a certain amount of twisted logic to it.Anyways, he was against Buster from the moment I brought him home, saying I wouldnt take care of him, wouldnt take him for walks, and that there was no way he was going to do it for me.I begged and pleaded, and thanks to Ma, he eventually let me keep him, but he was a long way from happy, and after a while I noticed that Buster started trotting out of the room the moment my old man appeared, as if he was being mean to him when I wasnt around.In the end, when Pa lost his job and money started getting tight, he said I had to get rid of Buster.I wouldnt, of course, but one day, when I got home, he was gone.Pa said he was sorry but he had to do it, that we just couldnt afford a dog anymore, and that Buster had gone to a good home.Couple of days later, some kids I knew told me theyd found Buster in a sack floating in the canal.I told them it wasnt him.Even when they took me down and showed me, I still said it wasnt my dog.I just didnt want to admit itnot then, not even now.It was Delilah who woke me in the morning, shaking my shoulder and screaming into my face, yelling at me to get up.What the hell is it?I asked, angry at being woken in such a manner.Theyve gone!she said, not backing away from my annoyance one bit.Who?Gordie and the dog.Into the Fire        SEVENTEEN Jesus, could things get any worse?Lena was being held captive by Infinity, Arturod been killed, Jimmy had a death warrant on his head and any number of people hoping to collect it, and now Gordied run off.And just at that moment, I gotta tell ya, I couldnt help but feel I had to take more than my share of the responsibility.I shouldve known Gordied take that dog and runat his age, in the same situation, Idve done the same.And suddenly my argument that it wouldve been dangerous to keep it seemed so trivial, so unnecessary, I couldnt believe Id ever made it.Ill go look for him, I said, struggling up.Oh, Clancy!Delilah moaned.What?She made this face, like it was obvious and didnt need to be said, but Hanna wasnt so restrained.You made him go!she cried.I didnt make him.You wouldnt let him keep Dorkus!Look, its okay, Ill find him, I know where he goes, I reassured them, as if it was just a matter of going there and picking him up.I ended up searching all morning, my right buttock and thigh far from happy at being pitched back into such exercise, but there was no sign of Gordie anywhere.Kids are usually the best source of information about other kids, but there were so few around, and when you did spot one they were pretty swift to slip away.I managed to talk to a couple of young guysI mean, a boy with a dog, it was pretty unusualbut they hadnt seen a thing, and it occurred to me that if Gordie didnt want to be found, amongst all that chaos there wasnt a lot I could do.I just couldnt believe Id fallen out with him over a dog, not after everything wed been through together.Surely I couldve handled it better than that?I searched everywhere I could think of, for a few brief moments even getting irrationally worried when I saw this apartment block on fire, just in case he might be in there.But no matter how much I wanted to keep going, to scour that whole city, eventually I had to go back to the churchyard to rest.The look on the others faces as I entered the shelter almost broke my heart.Sorry, I told them.Lets have something to eat, then well all go out and look, Delilah said.Can he keep the dog?Hanna asked.Jeez, that kid never wastes a word.Anything, I replied.A whole damn zoo, if he wants.I wouldnt let Jimmy come.He wanted to, but I couldnt bear the thought of something else going wrong, another of us disappearing.I also insisted that Delilah and Hanna went out together, no matter how much more ground they might cover separately.I spent all afternoon searchingstreet after street, almost going over to the ocean; in so much pain, I almost wished Id accepted Jimmys offer to borrow his stick.It was almost dark when I got back.Delilah and Hanna had already returned.One exchanged look was enough to know that no one had found him, nor heard a word concerning his whereabouts.Hes gone, said Delilah, as if shed previously thought it was all a game, that Gordie had just been trying to make a point.Well find him, I said.No one answered or looked my way and I knew they all blamed me, and that they had every right.I eased myself down onto my sleeping bag, trying to relax my aching body, the muscles around the top of my leg threatening to go into spasm.There was nothing more I could do, not that nightthough, in fact, within minutes I was forcing myself back up to my feet.I grabbed the spray can Id looted and shook it to see how much paint was left, then urged my protesting old body out one more time.I went to the usual places: along the street, the Square, not really knowing what to write, but in the end keeping it real simple.LOSTONE BOY  If Gordie read it, hed know what it meant, that we were missing him.As would anyone else connected with us, including, of course, Gigi.She didnt come til the morning, just as we were discussing how to go about continuing the search.Mind you, she was spitting nails and broken glass.Where is he?she demanded.We dont know, I confessed, fearing I was about to be turned on yet again.What happened?I let Delilah tell the story, for sure I didnt feel like relating my part in it.When she got to the bit about the dog and my objection to keeping it, I did try to explain my reasons, but Delilah cut me off.Though we were in for a bit of a surprise, cuz Gigi didnt react the way we expected.A stray dog?she said, looking decidedly worried.Yeah, Delilah nodded.Shit!she groaned.Whats the matter?I asked.Oh shit!she repeated, as if the real impact of it was only just hitting her.What is it?Its not a stray dog!What do you mean?I warned you about these people.She paused for a moment, staring at us, but no one had a clue what she was talking about.Enticers!They train dogs to befriend kids!To bring them back to their place, then they drug them and operate, take out whatever they want.It was so unexpected, so shocking, that for a moment all we could do was gape at her.The dog?Delilah eventually uttered.Yeah!It was too much to take inthat cute little dog romping and playing with Gordie was in fact the accomplice of some back street organ stealer?You sure?I asked.Yes!she shouted.I told you, they got all sorts of tricks!Jesus, I groaned.He shouldve known that!she cried, that little pixie face of hers displaying more emotion than Id ever seen before.Stupid dumbass.She stopped for a moment, trying to get her thoughts together.Whats the dog look like?Delilah told her, describing Dorkus in great detail, while Jimmy turned to me like he couldnt believe it: in this world you couldnt even trust a dog?Jesus, Big Guy!That is so uncool!I nodded my head, noticing Hanna getting ready to go out.There are a lot of fires up near the Square, Gigi told her, as if trying to put her off.I dont care, she said, making for the entrance.Hanna!I called, but she was gone before I could say any more.Wheres she going?Gigi asked.I dunno.She hesitated for a moment, looking more than a little put out, then rushed after Hanna.I turned to Jimmy and Delilah.What the hells going on?Delilah shook her head.Clancy!she said despairingly, like I was the biggest fool ever.What?Theyre in love...Both of them.I stared at her for quite a while before the thought finally got off the ground.Gordie?Yes!she cried, as if a block of wood wouldve surely seen that.And actually, once she said it, it did make perfect sense.That was why Hanna always acted so oddly around Gordie, not to mention how negative she was about Gigi: she was jealous!Great, I sighed.Thats all we need.Once again I told Jimmy he shouldnt go out, and for the same reason, but this time he wouldnt have any of it.He was as fond of Gordie as anyone and was joining the search whether we liked it or not.We argued with him for a while, but eventually gave in, though I did manage to persuade him to at least stay near the churchyard.I was so stiff from the previous day my ass felt like it had been nailed on, but the more I walked, the easier it became.I talked to as many people as I dared, avoiding anyone I didnt like the look of, concentrating more on the dog than on GordieI mean, that mutt mustve pulled the same trick any number of times.In a way, it was something of an ironya scheming, malevolent dogmy old man wouldve been delighted.But then, when you think about it, the dog had to be trained, so maybe it didnt prove his theory, after allmaybe it is all down to the owner?I searched and searched, streets and buildings, squares and waste ground, wondering if that dog had already completed its task and got Gordie back to its master.Like I said, Gordied become like a son to me and I was feeling pretty protective, pretty damn angry.What sort of scum were we dealing with here?Whod snatch kids off the street, slice them open and steal their organs?If I did find them, I wasnt sure how responsible I was gonna be for my own actions.And yet, as the day wore on, it looked less and less likely that Id have the opportunity to vent my anger.God knows how much ground I coveredI got so tired I wasnt even sure Id be able to make it back to the churchyardnot to mention the fact that my wound was starting to ooze a little.In the end, I had no choice but to stop and rest.I swear if I hadnt, I wouldve keeled over.Part of it was the ever present sea of smoke; my lungs felt almost numb, as if they wanted to close down rather than breathe in any more of that crap.I slumped down onto the steps of a run down old apartment block, checking my wound for bleeding, but thankfully, there was none.I guess I fell asleep, though whether for two minutes or two hours, I dont know.Nor do I know what woke me.Maybe it was my sixth sense, but whatever it was, it did me one helluva favor.I shook my head and opened and closed my eyes a few times, trying to awaken a glimmer of life in my dull old frame.It was getting late, the light was starting to fade, and I should be heading back to the churchyard.I was just about to stand up, to get moving, when suddenly this little dark shape came trotting out of the smoke toward methat damn dog!You miserable little piece of shit, I muttered.My immediate urge was to leap down the steps, run at him as fast as I could and kick the life out of the treacherous mutt, but then I had a second thought and the moment I did, I knew it was the right thing.I kept as still as I could, not looking directly at him but following his progress out of the corner of my eye.When he finally reached me, I sprang down from the steps screaming at the top of my voice, spreading my arms and legs, trying to make myself look as big and crazy as possible.And it worked: that dog jumped the best part of a foot into the air, let out a yelp of terror and turned and ran off as fast as he could.Immediately I chased after him, all my energy suddenly restored.Yeah, thats right, you damned little coward: run!Run all the way back home!For a little dog, he sure could move.Id never have managed to stay with him if he hadnt kept stopping and looking back to see if I was still following.He took a side street, scampering down there as fast as he could, but with me still puffing along behind.Once I thought Id lost him: I turned a corner and there was no sign of the muttJeez, could he really have disappeared into the smoke that quickly?But I ventured slowly forward, checking out doorway after doorway, until finally I flushed him out and again he bounded off with me screaming along behind.People were stopping and staring, wondering what the hell was going oneven in Senseless City, I was coming across as insane.Thankfully, less than a mile from where I first saw him, Dorkus suddenly veered off down an alleyway and began to scratch at a door.Above it was a garish but slightly faded sign: Body Talk TattoosWell Say Anything.This young guy, not much more than twenty, with greased back hair and cheap but fashionable clothes, opened the door to let the dog in and I jumped in behind it, hitting the little punk, knocking him up against the wall.I grabbed him by the collar and yanked him into my face, giving him a real blast of the look.Wheres Gordie?What?he cried, his face a contortion of confusion.I hit him again, just to up his concentration levels.Gordie!I growled.You got operations going on here?Just for the briefest of moments, his eyes flicked to an inner door and I knew I was right.I promptly hit him so hard hed take no further part in proceedings and left him lying on the floor.The dog scrambled under the sofa and just managed to avoid the hefty kick I directed his way.I tell you, if that damn thing hadnt been seen to, I was more than happy to offer my services, and I wouldnt be needing any surgical instruments or anesthetic either.Out in the narrow corridor I was confronted by several doors.I hesitated for a brief moment, then heard a male voice coming from behind one and kicked it open with as much force as I could muster.I wanted to put the fear of God into whoever was inside, but it was me who ended up being most disturbed.There were two people, a man and a woman, performing an operationand if that summons up a vision of white coats and sterilized surfaces, forget it.A young boy, no more than six or seven, was stretched out on an old wooden kitchen table with dark bloodstains all over it.Hanging from each side were these heavy leather straps, obviously for restraining the patient if necessary, though in this case, it wasnt: the little guy was well and truly out of it.The surgeonstocky, dyed black hair, maybe even the father of the one I hit outsidehad his hand pushed through a six inch gash in the boys side and was probing around in an altogether incompetent manner.Next to him, this little dark womanI guess it couldve been his wifewas standing there dressed in blue overalls, also covered in dried blood.Who are you?the guy demanded.Stitch him up, I told him.Get out!he replied indignantly.David!I wouldnt bother.David!Im not going to tell you again, I said.Stitch him up!With that, the woman promptly turned on the man, leaving little doubt that they were husband and wife.We told you!We told you!she screamed, as if shed been waiting for this day for a long time.Oh, shut up!David!the guy called again, but of course there was no reply.Last chance, I told him, desperate in my disgust to exact a little retribution.Still the guy hesitated, turning to his wife but seeing no signs of sympathy, then back to me.Dont you know how dangerous it is to interrupt a surgeon performing an operation?he said, trying another tack.First off, you aint no surgeon, I told him, youre a damn tattooist.Secondly, the only person this operation is dangerous for is you.Now, stitch him up while you still can.He took a sideways glance at his miserable collection of medical instruments and what appeared to be his one and only scalpel.Thatd be the stupidest mistake of your life, I warned him.All right!he said impatiently, picking up a different instrument.All right.Wheres Gordie?I asked.I dont know any Gordie.I couldnt be bothered with him anymore.I returned to the corridor and started opening doors.The next room along was just junk: piled boxes, tattoo catalogs, that sort of stuff.The final one, at the end, was locked and I had to put my shoulder to it.The first time it cracked encouragingly; the second, it burst open.I tell ya, I just stood there, for a moment too shocked to even enter.There mustve been half a dozen or more bunk beds crammed into the room, all of them occupied by children, the youngest no more than five, the oldest maybe fifteen or so.Each one was covered by a single grubby, bloodstained sheet.Several of them were staring at me, but they didnt seem able to take anything in, their eyes were all lost and lifeless.But it was the sense that they werent human, that this was just an organ production line, that was most sickening.One little girl, probably no more than eight or nine, looked at me with the most haunted expression Ive ever seen in my life, like she didnt know if Id come to do good or bad, and didnt really care either.Gordie?I called, but there was no answer and I started to check through the beds, one by one, searching face after face.You can go, I told them.Go on, get going!...Get!I was just about to give up when I found him lying on the top bunk in the corner.He looked so unbelievably childlike and vulnerable, it took me a moment to recognize him.Jesus!I gasped.Gordie?He just stared at me as if he couldnt believe it, when he finally did speak his voice was noticeably slurred.Whered you come from?Tell you later.He tried to get up but gave a kinda tremble halfway and fell back again.Thank God, I found him when I didI figured his turn at being operated on couldntve been that far away, that he was in that state cuz theyd prepped him already.I reached underneath his pale, wiry body, knowing I was gonna have to carry him.I just about got my hands around him when I felt it.I released my hold, pulled up his T shirt and there it was: this ugly scar, about six or seven inches long, caked with dried blood, slashed at an angle across his side and crudely stapled together.Fuck!I cursed, unable to stop myself.Gordie just looked at me, on the point of tears, like he wanted to apologize for being so stupid, for causing me so much trouble, and it was that as much as anything that prompted me to turn and make my way back into the other room.They mustve known how Id react cuz I met them at the door about to make a run for it.I hit the guy really hard in the face and he fell back against the doorframe.You fucking butcher!I screamed.How dare you do that to them!I just take kidneys!I just take the one kidney!he cried, as if that made him one of the good guys.I was so angry at what hed done, and that he didnt even seem genuinely contrite, that I got hold of him and threw him onto the kitchen table, securing him with the straps.No!No!he kept shouting, and his wife started joining in.Please, mister!she cried.Hell never do it again!You bet he wont, I told her, picking up the filthy looking scalpel beside the table.I knew I was out of control, that what I was doing wasnt right, but every time he begged for mercy, every time I thought about stopping, I remembered all the pain and distress he mustve dispensed over the yearsand most of it to children.His wife tried to stop me, but I just kept shoving her away til finally she couldnt take it anymore and ran from the room.I dont think Ill ever make a tattooist, not going on my efforts that day: I cut ENTICER across his forehead, as large as I could, the letters spilling into each other.You ever touch another child, Ill write this a thousand times all over your body, I warned, as he lay there crying.You got it?Yes!Yes!he wailed, and I turned to go, leaving him where he was.Gordie was leaning against the doorframe and I picked him up and pushed my way gently through the other kids as they dazedly made their way outside.Clancy?Gordie asked.I knew what the question was going to be and didnt want to disappoint, but I had no choice.Sorry, Gordie.Not this time.They got nowhere to go...Thankfully, at that moment he more or less passed out on my shoulder and I didnt have to explain why, that we already had enough problems of our own.In the small reception area by the front door I found the mother taking care of her son, both of them in tears.Hes not a bad man, she told me.Just greedy.How many kids?I asked her, and she turned away.How many?She shook her head, like she didnt want to think about that, that it had never been her idea.As I went to leave, out of the corner of my eye, I saw Dorkus scrambling under the sofa again, anxious to get as far away from me as he could.If I ever see that animal again therell be fresh meat free in the City that nightyou got it?She nodded and I stalked out carrying Gordie with me.He was gonna be quite a weight all the way back to the shelter, especially with the pain still in my leg, but Id get him there if it killed me.I gave the little guy a hug, taking advantage of the fact that he was sleeping, knowing if hed been awake he probably wouldve given me an earful.I was so damn pleased to have him back, so relieved he hadnt ended up the same way as Arturo.Something else too, that I hadnt expected: for once it felt like Id achieved something, that wed scored a rare victory.I guess I was getting a little carried away with myself, but I couldve almost believed the tide was starting to turn.One down...one to go.Into the Fire        EIGHTEEN The only problem was that the one to go was a different prospect altogether.It had been a real slice of luck finding Gordie that way, but compared to what I needed to rescue Lena, it was an ice cube to an iceberg.For sure, no dog, real or mechanical, was gonna lead me to her, and even if it did there was still the little matter of Fort Infinity and its attendant army to deal with.If I was told this story about someone else, the plight I was in, I guess Id just think that they had to accept it, that there was no other choice.Not that Id give that advicenor take it.No matter how hopeless it seemed, almost every minute of my day was devoted to thinking about rescuing Lena, while at night the problem stole the vast majority of my sleep.How could I get into that place?How could I reach her?How?There had to be a waythey couldnt have thought of everything.I was still more or less confident she wasnt in any immediate danger, that for whatever reason they were taking good care of herbut for how long?If it had something to do with the baby, we were probably talking around six months.If it was more to do with stealing what she had in her head, it couldve been any day.Somehow I had to give it another shotand yeah, whatd happened with Gordie had given me just the slightest cause for hope, that despite all the terrible things going on, maybe miracles did still occasionally happen.I was really surprised at how quickly Gordie started to mend.Though I guess at his age you do.He did still get tired and have to take the occasional nap for a while.As for his scar, well, it was never gonna look pretty, not the way he was butchered, but once the risk of infections gone, the best thing for a wounds fresh air, and it was amazing how rapidly it improved.Mind you, being a kidand one whod always regarded himself as a real little tough guyhe never wasted a single opportunity to show it off to somebody.You shouldve seen the way Hanna reacted when he first got back.She did her best to hide it, to feign disinterest, but there were tears in her eyes, really big soulful ones that I had to look away from in case they triggered my own.I just couldnt see how Id missed that.It was so obvious she had a crush on himthe way she sneered at everything he said, constantly rolled her eyes in disapproval, and how she made such a big thing of not being anywhere near himshe was a teenager in love!Then there was her arch rival: Gigi was hard as the bullet coming out of a gun most of the time, a real uncompromising no nonsense female, but if Gordie wanted some water or something, you couldve been killed in the rush.I mean, all due respect to the kid and everything, and I love the boy as my own, but it was something of a surprise.With that sharp little ferret face, part of an ear missing, the bald patch just behind, he sure wasnt my idea of an object of teenage desire.And you couldnt even say he made up for it with charisma either: that missing part of an ear mustve been where he stored his charm and politeness, cuz sure as hell he didnt have none.Mind you, with everything that was going on, teenage love tussles werent exactly high on my list of priorities, nor Jimmy and Delilahs ongoing spats neither.She was still angry with him for how he gave his name away, though to be fair, she wasnt beating him up any more than he was beating up himself.People were searching for him all over, enjoying the relaxation of the gun laws, buying themselves weapons and pretty well popping off at whoever they liked, all the while knowing they were unlikely to be arrested even if they did accidentally kill someone.We were definitely hearing a lot more indiscriminate gunfirein the day as well as nightand seeing more bodies in the street.But Jimmy was still going out whenever he could, no matter how risky it might be, or how angry it made Delilah.Heavily disguised, of course, and hed added a pair of sunglasses to the parka, scarf and baseball cap, so that now he actually did look like a terroristthough of the senior variety.It was his pride that sent him out as much as anything: a need to find a way of making up for what hed done, to redeem himself in our eyes.I often went with him, the two of us just wandering around, checking things out; occasionally stopping to look at a new fire, Jimmy going on again about how he didnt understand why they burned the way they did, not that I was paying that much attention.The truth was, we were both searching for something out there, though neither of us knew exactly what.A couple of times bounty hunters got a little too close for comfort.A group set up this unofficial roadblock, stopping everyone and checking for disguises.We had to queue up, all the time whispering to each other, wondering what the hell to do.Fortunately, we were saved by another couple making a run for it.Lord knows why they ran, but they both got shot in the back for their trouble and by the time the excitement had died down, Jimmy and me were long gone.Another time, something was burning that was making the smoke even more toxic than usual; hitting the back of my throat like someone scratching at it with a fork.I think Jimmy had a bit of a cold anyway and he started coughing and spluttering so much he dislodged not only his bandanna but his hood, too.It was only for a second but this woman got real suspicious, pulling out a gun, pointing it at him, shouting into this looted store for someone called Frank.When he never appeared and she looked on the point of panicking, we figured there was no way she was going to shoot and ran.Wed made it about thirty yards down the street when finally she got her act together and started firing, bullets flying around like theyd been panicked out of the gun.We ducked down an alleyway and into a partly demolished building, hiding under the stairs, all the while praying that the woman and Frank werent following.But do you know something?Even then, with the real risk of being cornered and killed, I didnt use that breathless silence to think of ways we might escape, but of asking out loud the same question I asked myself almost every minute of the day and night.What am I going to do, Jimmy?I whispered.He glanced at me, taking but a moment to register what I was talking about.I cant just give up, I told him.Well think of something, he replied, though he didnt sound that hopeful.I gotta get into that place, even if it means knocking it down brick by brick.You gotta think your way in there, he told me, pausing for a moment, ensuring he hadnt heard someone approaching.Its not gonna happen any other way.I gave a little grunt, figuring that put me at something of a disadvantage.Neither of us actually said anything, but eventually we came to the conclusion that it was safe and emerged back out onto the street, turning in the direction of the churchyard.You cant do nothing with their computers?I asked, knowing if there was anything, he wouldve said by now.Are you kidding?he said, his voice impossibly high.I gotta mini screen.They got more technological muscle than anyone in the country.Decidedly not cool.For the rest of the journey we barely said a word, and I had to shake off this growing feeling that this period wasnt about coming up with a solution at all, but more just accepting the inevitability that there wasnt one.Later, when we were all in our sleeping bags, in the first deep chasm of darkness, we were awakened by a familiar sound.It was some way off, over toward the ocean, but somewhere theyd started beating.Oh God, Delilah groaned, turning over, trying to block it out.It was this eerie mixture of the monotonous and menacing: a persistent, pervasive beat building to an inevitable climax, a drum roll for a mighty leap of death.Are they coming this way?Gordie asked.Nah.Were okay, I told him.You sure?Yeah, I said, trying to sound as confident as I could.After a while it faded away, but none of us could get back to sleep.We just lay there, our nerves twanging like piano wire, knowing it would eventually come and unable to relax until it did.I guess it was about thirty minutes later, faint, some way off, but the unmistakable sound of heavy gunfire.Jesus, but I hated this place.The following morning, exasperated by the usual familiar scraps of sleep, I awoke still in the same black mood.Dont ask me why, but after Id eaten, I went and dug out those four novels I took from the bookstore and headed off into the churchyard.I guess I was looking for an escape, giving my mind a rest from going over and over the same problem.I wasnt sure which one to read first but eventually decided on this Charles Dickens guy and A Tale of Two Cities.I didnt get very far.In fact, I couldnt get past the first line: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times...I couldnt help it; I just burst out laughingnot real laughter, but more just kind of mocking me and my situation.No words I came up with could describe my situation better.After thinking all my life that it wasnt an option, Id finally found love and apparently I was about to become a father, but in a world where such things could be ripped from you in the blink of an uncaring eye.In the end, I knew I wouldnt be able to concentrate and returned to the shelter, asking everyoneincluding the kidsif they had any jobs they needed doing, hoping I could lose myself that way.Delilah got me fetching and carryingreorganizing stuffbut when I complained I was looking for something more demanding, she made me fill in the old latrines and dig new ones.Though in truth, I was grateful even for that, anything to give my tortured mind something else to think about.But I was just holding back the inevitablelike that King Canute guy and the seacuz the moment I found myself at a loose end again, all those thoughts of Lena rushed back over me.I had to do something, no matter how futile, and the only thing I could think of was taking another look at Infinity.The first thing I noticed when I got there was that theyd beefed up their security, presumably in response to our attempt at a raid.For the life of me, I couldnt see why; they werent ever under any kind of real threat, but there were definitely more Specials around.I made my way along the road outside the perimeter fence as casually as I could.Now that I knew the growlers were there, I could see these slight mounds dotted around the lawn.Jeez, what a thought that was: those damn things down there, lined up in the dark, waiting for the signal to be snapped back into life.The gates were obviously out of the question, knowing what they were capable of, how they could scan and destroy.I also couldnt help but notice how little traffic had gone through since Id arrivedmaybe theyd imposed some kind of emergency restrictions?All Id seen was a couple of lightly armored Infinity vehicles and yet another short convoy of those white trucks.The constant clickety clack of the observation cameras passing by in monotonous regularity eventually persuaded me it was time to go.It hadnt exactly been encouraging, just like always.Id gone there looking for hope, but was returning laden with even more despair.When I got back to the churchyard, kicking my way across the rubble, Jimmy appeared out of the bushes like hed been waiting for me for some time.What was more, he had a real look of excitement about him, more so than at any time since wed left the Island.Big Guy!Big Guy!he cried, keeping an eye on the shelter in case any of the others appeared.I need your help.Jimmy!I groaned.Honestly, Im not in the mood No, no, Big Guy, this is really important.Trust me.I studied his face for a moment.As down as I felt, I was still intrigued to know what had brought back these signs of his old passionate self.What is it?Come and see, he urged.I gave a long sigh, and realizing I was about to give in, he turned and, slightly to my surprise, led me into the shelter.Once there, he hesitated, not wanting to look too eager in front of the others.Just er...wanna show Big Guy something, he muttered, though not one of them exhibited the slightest interest; Lile was giving her hair its weekly brush, Hanna and Gordie playing a game on the mini screen Jimmy beckoned me on, all the way down into the corner of the churchyard where the fallen tree straddled the wall.You ever been here?he asked, starting to pull stuff out of hiding from beneath the treeall the various elements of his disguise, right down to his sunglassesand putting them on.I told you I had, I replied; wed had a conversation a while back that obviously he hadnt been listening to as usual.Lile dont like me going out.Its easier this way.You can get over the wall, he said, informing me of what I already knew.You dont say, I muttered, watching him ineptly scramble and slip his way up the tree, finally reaching the apex and then kinda falling out of sight.I followed after him, not with that much grace, and certainly not with the sort of finesse that wouldve impressed Hanna, but in quarter of the time it had taken Jimmy.Even before my feet touched the ground, he was already scuttling away.Where we going?I asked, hurrying after him.To see something unbelievably cool!he told me.There was no point in asking again.He was obviously in one of those moods: the magician moving to the climax of his trick, and actually, it was quite nice to see it, no matter what the reason.He led me across to the other side of the stonemasons yard, through the gate, then pegged off down the street at a surprising pace.Jimmy!I called, again having to hurry to catch up.We came to one of those weird borders, night and day, black and white, between our burned out and demolished area and a relatively intact onethere was even a public garden, with a few old, established trees.Jimmy entered, taking his time, peering around, checking no one was watching.Take a look, he eventually said, pointing at the largest of the trees.I paused, not really understanding what I was sposed to be looking at, wondering how senile dementia first manifested itself.Its a tree, I eventually commented.No!he said impatiently.Look!Up there!I got a bit closer to the trunk and peered up through the lattice of branches, finally spotting something caught almost at the top.It looked like some kind of battered metal container.What is it?What dya think it is?I dont know!I cried, starting to get a little irritated as usual.You should.It kept us prisoners long enough.I stared at it again, and though it took me a while, finally I realized.Satellite?I asked.Cool, huh?Why wasnt it destroyed?I dunno.Obviously it got hit, but for some reason its fire went out on the way down.I guess its been lodged up there ever since.I looked again, realizing in that moment that Jimmy had finally found the thing he thought would redeem him in our eyes.So?he said, indicating the tree.What?Get it down!What?It aint no use up there.Are you kidding me?You can do it.Oh, can I?I said sarcastically.Sure you can!It was useless to argue, and anyway, tell the truth, I was that bit intrigued.Okay, I sighed.I mightve been able to climb a fallen tree, that was more or less horizontal, but that was a bit different from one reaching thirty feet into the air.Youve never seen such clumsy ineptitude.Every branch I put my weight on broke.I went up, down, up, downthen spent several embarrassing moments just hanging there, twirling around like something on a Christmas tree.In the end, and only Mother Nature knows how, I finally worked myself up into a position where, by stretching up as high as I could, I could just manage to dislodge the satellite and send it crashing down to the ground.Jimmy made this loud shushing sound and started checking all around to see if Id attracted anyones attention then, the moment he was sure it was safe, eagerly set to work poking, prodding, even sniffing at it.Meanwhile, as many others had learned before me, I discovered that climbing down a tree is a damn sight harder than climbing up.Come on, Big Guy, Jimmy urged, pulling out a large plastic bag hed obviously brought to wrap up the satellite, we gotta get this back before anyone sees it.Yeah, thanks, Jimmy, Ill just fall down, shall I?Whatever!It took me a while, and I cursed him repeatedly and colorfully, but finally I slid down the last few feet of the trunk to the ground.Lets go, he said, even before I was done checking myself for cuts and bruises.It might not have been a whole satellite but it was surprisingly heavy, not to mention damned awkward to carry.Thank God we didnt have that far to gothe last thing we needed was anyone challenging us, maybe thinking a couple of aging looters had something interesting hidden away.A group of young guys did check us out as we passed by, probably prompted by Jimmys overly elaborate disguise, but they changed their minds when I gave them the look.The worst part was getting it over the fallen treewe dropped it several times after the bag ripped to uselessnessbut eventually we toppled it over the wall into the churchyard and it crashed to the ground Jimmy followed on behind, then me, finding him already busily scrutinizing his trophy.I dont know how much of it remaineda little more than half, Idve guessed.A lot of the innards had been shot out, bits trailing offincluding a kind of broken arm, which, I guess, was its source of solar power.According to Jimmy, it wouldve had two originally, so presumably one got dislodged somehow.Jesus!the little guy muttered, shaking his head.What?If Id known this was what was terrorizing us, I wouldnt have bothered.Its out of the Stone Age.Really?I thought itd be something real sophisticated.The Final Solution.He stopped for a moment, getting down on his hands and knees, sniffing it again.Can you smell something?I knelt down next to him, also sniffing around, the pair of us like a couple of old bloodhounds.Maybe...Not nice, I said, though I wasnt really sure.Lena was always talking about a bad smell.Thats the trouble with getting old, Jimmy grumbled.Nothing works the way it did.
