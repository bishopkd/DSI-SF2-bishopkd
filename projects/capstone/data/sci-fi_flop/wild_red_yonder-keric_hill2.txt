"An astronaut named Gavin took another look at the spacecrafts control panel and turned to look at his crewmate Jeff.Jeff gave a thumbs up with his bulky glove and grinned."Roger, Control, we are ready to go," Gavin called back.Grange looked up from his console and switched his headset to a different line."This is Grange, all controllers report in," he tried to say calmly.His voice cracked a little from the tension and fatigue he had suffered over several weeks of preparing for this mission.He felt that throwing together a spacecraft so hastily was sure to bring catastrophe.Even for the Russians it had been short notice, and they were accustomed to preparing space missions more quickly than Americans."Life Support."Go.""Electrical.""Go."The men monitoring each different system on board the Soyuz capsule each gave the go ahead for the mission.When they had all reported in, Grange looked at his assistant, who was talking on the phone to a representative of the President of the United States.The President had the last word on whether they should proceed with the mission.Grange was glad that the responsibility for the decision didnt rest on his shoulders.With one word, the President could send the three astronauts on an operation that would most likely lead to their deaths, or he could call them back to the safety of Earth.After nodding silently to Grange, the assistant hung up.Although it wasnt spoken, it was as if he had said, "The President is Go."***The Purple Man Mabok looked unbelieving through his binoculars as an Earth capsule got closer and closer to his orbiting ship.He couldnt remember how long he had been on his ship, called a Pinak by the Purple Men, without anything notable occurring.It was a shock that something was breaking the monotony of the past few days and he almost couldnt fathom it.He wiped off the inside of the window of his spacecraft and looked again.He didnt know what to do and had the terrible feeling of being alone in a foreign and distant place.In thirty minutes he could talk to his ground base in New Mexico, but for now that was on the other side of the Earth and he had no one to turn to.The Soyuz capsule continued to get closer.He could see detail on it now.It was cylindrical with a spherical bulb on one end.Mabok switched on the communications system even though he knew there was no chance of reaching his base, "Mabok to base!"he called.His call went unanswered.Mabok to base!"he shouted, as if a louder voice could somehow get through.Mabok took another look at the capsule through binoculars and couldnt stop thinking of who might be inside.They were probably the savages from Earth who were known to his people as "Reds. "At other times he had been very intrigued about what he heard of their culture and customs.Even though the Reds were his enemies, he thought it would be interesting to learn something about them.Others told him that it wasnt likely the Reds knew anything of benefit, being as primitive as they were.He had heard accounts of his comrades deaths in battles with the Reds on the ground.Their guns shot large metal chunks, which inflicted death slowly and painfully.Mabok shuddered at the thought and wondered if it could really be true.His people, the Jaka, used humane weapons that kill almost instantly.He thought back several weeks to the time when his comrades loaded up landing craft with weapons to attack the Reds.His leader Kropan had received word that the Reds from Earth had attacked colonists from his planet.A small fleet was sent to strike back against the Reds and Mabok was assigned to stay behind and take care of the one ship that they were going to leave in orbit."Mabok, you can stay on the Pinak and wait for our return," Kropan had told him."We must make this planet safe for colonization.Force is the only way to show the Reds who is in charge here."Mabok was tired of the Liaison Officer, Kropan, and at first was glad to be rid of him, even if he had been left completely alone.Kropan was a Liaison between the Navy and the Oligarchs, who were the political rulers of the Jaka.Kropan had the assignment to make sure that the officers of the ship were complying with the Oligarchs orders.In other words, the Liaisons kept the military in line with the political leaders.Until recently the Oligarchs hadnt assigned Liaisons to every ship, but recently tensions had arisen between many of the military officers and the Oligarchs.The resentment in the military had grown as the Oligarchs responded by exerting more control over the Navy.Before joining the Navy, Mabok thought that the Jaka only fought to protect the home world and defend justice.He had eagerly joined up and been happy to serve his planet.Only after several years did he realize that the stories were not always true.He had decided to leave the Jaka Navy as soon as his tour was up, but for now he was stuck.His mind suddenly leapt to what Kropan had told him about the Reds.Kropan knew about the Reds because he had talked to an Earth prisoner.They had named the prisoner Gavin after he was captured and had taken him to show to the people back home.While normal Jaka have a slight purplish blue hue to their skin, this Earthman was decidedly reddish.Gavin had learned some of the Jaka language during his captivity and Mabok had wanted to see him, just so he could see for himself if they were as bloodthirsty as Kropan was saying.He felt it difficult to believe the stories that were told about the Reds.Gavin was being kept in a Jaka military base in New Mexico, so there had once been a possibility that Mabok could speak to him.Unfortunately, the Reds had overrun the base in New Mexico and Gavin had probably escaped.Now there were no other Reds in captivity, so Mabok had lost his chance to speak to one.Mabok jerked himself loose from his thoughts and looked at the capsule again.He made note of the range between his ship and the capsule and found that it was only getting closer.Mabok's orders were to defend the ship from unidentified craft.The capsule was a hundred yards away and closing, so there wasnt much time.Mabok got up from the pilots seat and ran down the corridor towards the engine room.His magnetic boots clanged on the metal floor, but the sound was soon muffled after he clicked his helmet shut.His heart pounded.After checking to see if his suit was airtight, he climbed through the airlock, and stepped inside the equipment bay.He opened the bay door, and the equipment bay was flooded with light as the door slid open.The bright Earth filled Maboks view.In his hurry, he had purposefully opened the door before the air had completely pumped out of the lock, and a quick blast of air rushed into space.He soon noticed the approaching capsule hanging over the backdrop of clouds and blue ocean.The capsule was slowly getting larger.The cannon sat dark and silent in the rear of the equipment bay.Mabok walked over to the cannon and grabbed its handgrips.Its dull gray surface seemed blue in the Earths light.With some exertion, Mabok cranked the cannon towards the open door on a metal track.When he got it in place, he looked up.The capsule was much bigger now.His glass visor clinked against metal as he looked in the telescopic sight and adjusted the aim with a joystick to point at the large cylindrical end of the Red ship.When it was centered, he stood back, spread his feet to get a sure footing with his magnetic boots, and leaned forward to grip the firing lever at the rear of the cannon.He gave a shove and the lever slammed into the fire position.He winced in the bright flash as the cannon recoiled from the shot.***In the battles on the ground in New Mexico and Texas, the United States had lost countless lives to the superior weapons of the Purple Men.Grange hoped this daring space mission would make up for the Earthlings' lack of sophistication with the element of surprise.He certainly was caught by surprise when Gavin first recommended it.Gavin had been rushed to the space program headquarters as soon as he had been liberated from the Purple Man base in New Mexico.Gavin had a plan to strike back at the Purple Men by taking over an enemy ship in orbit.He had heard his captors speak of one spare ship left in orbit.The President had agreed that the mission would be worth it if there were any chance of sparing the lives of a few men on the ground.The fact that Gavin had been a trained astronaut was a great help as he campaigned for this bold space strike.Gavin had been an astronaut before the Purple Men had arrived and had eagerly waited for news about the first encounters with the aliens.Back in the early days of relations with the Purple Men, everyone was elated to discover an alien form of intelligent life.Practically the whole astronaut corps had volunteered to go live with the Purple Men, but Gavin had been the one who was selected.He was sent to learn the Purple Man language and report on their technology.That was long before things had turned hostile.When relations had worsened, Gavin was taken as a prisoner and carried off into space to show the Purple Man superiors what the Earth people were like.The other two members of the astronaut crew were Cliff and Jeff.They had been obvious choices because they had the most experience with Russian equipment, and only a Russian rocket could be prepared for launch in such a short time.Russia needed money, and selling a Soyuz rocket to the U. S.  had been no problem for them.The last element of the plan fell into place when American tracking stations sighted the lone alien ship drifting in orbit.The Purple Man spacecraft hadnt made any orbit changes for weeks, so it was thought to be unoccupied.***Grange took one more look around the Russian control room and switched his headset to communicate with the capsule."Soyuz, this is control, you have our approval to board the enemy vessel," Grange called."Okay," Gavin said excitedly over Granges speaker, "We are starting on the checklist to dock with the enemy vessel."The men at mission control watched their consoles as various systems were switched off and on as the astronauts performed the tasks necessary to connect the two ships together.The three men in the Soyuz capsule clicked on their helmets and made sure the air hoses that fed oxygen into their suits were properly connected.Cliff finished his task list first and attached the clipboard to the control panel with a wide canvas strap.He leaned back in his seat, and had time to look at the Purple Man ship for the first time out the small capsule window.It looked kind of like a blocky submarine colored flat gray.He could see a wide doorway on the side and some windows at the nose.A white dome protruded out of the top towards the back of the craft, and the underside was a dull black."I can see the ship very well now," Grange heard Cliff say over the radio back at Mission Control."The bay door on the side is open now, and there are still lights on in the cockpit by the nose. "Grange felt himself tense up as Cliff described the craft.The fact that the lights were on in the cockpit was somewhat alarming."Can you get in the ship through the bay if the docking mechanism doesnt work?"Grange called."I dont know," Cliff answered, "The door is wide open and" Cliff paused.Grange waited for Cliff to continue for a few moments, but there was only silence."Go ahead, Soyuz," Grange called."I thought I saw some movement in the bay," Cliff said breathlessly."What do you see?"Grange asked, his heart jumping."Oh, no!"was all Grange heard from the capsule.Cliff saw what looked like a figure in the bay, working with a piece of equipment.Then, in an instant, everything was chaos.The checklist in front of him fluttered away in a violent rush of air and disappeared out a gaping hole in the capsule that opened up beside him.Jeff was thrown into the control panel by the violent blast, and his helmet faceplate was cracked into a spider web of broken glass, but still held together.Gavin stared outside the craft through his window to see shredded pieces of the orbital module silently flying outward like a newspaper in the wind.Cliff felt a draft of air on his arm, and looked down to see an inch long slit in the back of his glove.A ripped piece of the fabric waved wildly in the escaping gas.At the moment, all he could think of was to rip the canvas strap off the control panel and wrap it around his wrist.He cinched it tight and hoped it would hold long enough.He could feel the vacuum boiling sweat off of his hand."Gavin!Ive got a leak here!"Jeff gasped as he felt the air escaping through his helmet and heard a hissing sound.***In the Russian control room, Grange stood gripping the back of his chair.The radio was dead.There was no voice from the Soyuz."Grange," someone yelled, "Im not getting any signals from the orbital module!"***Gavin couldnt help looking past Jeff at the deep blue Earth below, right through the capsules ruptured hull.He could see the Earth roll out of view every few seconds.The capsule was in a spin.He forced himself to think calmly."Okay, Jeff, well need to see if the capsules oxygen supply is working," Gavin said.He opened his eyes and scanned the Cyrillic letters on the control panel."The main oxygen tanks in the service module have no pressure," Jeff called."Im switching to the descent module tanks," Cliff said.Jeff also turned and found himself looking out the ruptured hull.Lots of small particles floated around out in the black sky.He looked back at the control panel."The flight computer has no power," Jeff called."Activating on board batteries," Cliff said."Forget about the flight computer," Gavin called, "It used to be over there," he said as he motioned toward the missing cabin wall."It looks like the radio is okay," Cliff called."Try and hook it up to the batteries," Gavin said, and then turned to Jeff."How bad is the leak in your helmet?""Not too bad," Jeff answered, "But the descent tanks aren't going to last long."Cliff held up his glove."Ive got a leak too, but Ive tied it off at my wrist."***Mabok watched a ball of gas and debris billow out from the capsule.Then it started slowly spinning away.He hadn't scored a direct hit, but he was satisfied that there wasnt much chance of anyone surviving.Even if they did, their ship was crippled.Mabok left the equipment bay and got into the airlock.He wanted to forget about it all.He shut the airlock door and pumped the air back in after glancing through the window into the open equipment bay.As soon as the airlock filled with air, he pulled off his helmet, set it down with a sigh of relief, and opened the hatch.He walked up to the cockpit.Checking the chronometer, he saw that the New Mexico base would be in radio range in twenty minutes.He sat in the pilots seat, and strapped in.He noticed that his hand was shaking, and he let out a deep breath.The clock seemed to stand still as he watched its changing digits.***Grange looked up in astonishment."What was that?"he called, startled at the sound."Were getting voice back again," someone said."...lost the orbital module," Gavins voice came over the radio, "What do you recommend?""Say again, Soyuz," Grange called."We had an explosion and lost the orbital module," Gavin repeated."How bad is it damaged?"Grange asked."It isnt there anymore," Gavin answered."How about the rest of the ship?"Grange asked."We had a decompression, but were all okay," Gavin said."Can you repressurize?"Grange asked."Say again," Gavin said, as the static in his headset got worse."Can you repressurize?""No, we lost part of the capsule wall," Gavin answered."The docking mechanism was on the orbital module, so its been blown away. "The orbital module, which was now gone, was a spherical compartment on top of the Soyuz spacecraft, but the astronauts were strapped into the gumdrop shaped descent module."They wont be able to dock," Grange said.Then he turned to the propulsion man standing next to him."Okay, Vladimir," he sighed, "can they still fly?""Its possible," Vladimir said as he spread a diagram on the top of Granges computer monitor."They still have a little maneuverability, but the center of balance is all off, so it will be very difficult.""They can't reenter," Grange said, mulling the options."Actually, theres only one option now," Vladimir said as he looked up from the blueprint, "They have to get on that ship in order to survive.""But they cant dock with it," Grange countered."They dont necessarily have to dock," Vladimir replied, "If they can fly into the open bay of the enemy ship.""Its risky.""But I dont see any other choices."Grange and looked at Vladimir for a minute."Vladimir," Grange said, "Just figure it out as fast as you can and tell them how to do it."Vladimir gathered up his blueprints."Okay," he said and rushed over to the propulsion console.A man was already sitting at the console working away."Vladimir," the man at the console said without turning, "We still have about two thirds of the maneuvering thrusters functioning properly.""Whats the fuel situation?"Vladimir asked."About twenty seconds."***As mission control tried to figure out a solution, the three crewmen were sweating it out in the capsule.Cliff looked down at his hand.The strap seemed to be holding in the air in the rest of his suit, but his hand was starting to go numb."Soyuz," Grange called up after about five minutes."This is Soyuz," Cliff replied."Cliff," Grange said calmly, "Since you are the pilot, we need you to stabilize the craft.""I think Jeff will have to," Cliff said quietly, "I cant use my hand.It seemed to Grange that new problems were arising every minute."Okay," Grange said, "Jeff, you try to stabilize the capsule.Well radio some instructions for Gavin to write down while you do that."Gavin grabbed a pencil and some paper that had managed to stay in the capsule."This is Gavin.Go ahead."Grange started reading off instructions and Gavin copied them down while Jeff gripped the control joysticks and starting to take the capsule out of its spin.With the orbital module blown off, the capsule was unstable, and the job was very difficult.Jeff squinted through the smeared window and gave a control joystick one last tap.Then he let out a breath."Control," he called, "This is Soyuz, I have the capsule stabilized, I think.""Listen," Vladimir said, "tell him to aim the capsule slightly ahead of the equipment bay on the enemy ship.""Okay," Jeff said, "Im looking for the ship...wait...Okay, its in sight. "Jeff said and paused again."Now Im pointed a little ahead of the equipment bay and the capsule is stabilized.""Jeff," Grange said slowly and clearly, "Fire the engine to accelerate ten meters per second."Jeff turned to the other two astronauts."You ready?"he asked.Gavin and Cliff gave a thumbs up.They were hoping that nothing exploded when they tried using their main propulsion.Jeff followed the instructions and flipped the last switch to activate the main engine.Soon the capsule was moving and starting to vibrate.The three crewmen could feel their bodies press into their seats as the capsule accelerated."Hows it going, Soyuz?"Grange called."Were moving now," Jeff replied, "There is a lot of vibration. "Jeff could still hear the hissing air coming out of his cracked helmet.The oxygen gauge read at one half.Ten minutes ago it was full.Jeff didnt want to think about it and turned his head to look at the timer.He was supposed to turn off the engines after 17 seconds of burn time.15. ..16. ..17. ..Jeff flipped the switch and the vibration stopped."Engines off," Jeff radioed."Guide it the rest of the way with your maneuvering thrusters into the equipment bay," Grange called, "And if you need to, you have three seconds of main engine fuel.Once you are in, have Gavin disconnect from the oxygen, float into the bay, close the bay door, and pump the air in.After that, youre on your own.""Roger."The three men in the capsule watched as the ship grew nearer.Jeff kept his hands on the joysticks.Cliff held his injured hand under his arm.It seemed to help a little to hold it there.Cliff watched the Purple Man ship, as they got nearer."A little to the left," Cliff suggested quietly.Jeff grimaced and moved the stick a little.The capsules maneuvering was unpredictable."Were drifting away!"Cliff said.Jeff fired the main engine at the last moment and the capsule lurched forward.They needed a little push to get back on target.The capsule careened towards the side of the equipment bay.It slammed into the right side of the doorway and spun into the bay with solar panels clipped off and flying in different directions.Then it crunched into the wall.The whole thing seemed strangely silent.The men were thrown against their straps.Then they were weightless again and the Soyuz was motionless.It was too big to fit in the bay, but had jammed itself in somehow.Gavin disconnected his oxygen hose and undid his straps.He opened the hatch, climbed out of the capsule, and looked around the bay.The Soyuz was wedged in the bay diagonally against the back wall.He saw the door mechanism on the other side of the bay.He had seen the Purple Men use it many times while he was with them, but he still wasnt sure if he knew how to work it.He pushed off the capsule with his feet and tried to ignore his shaking legs.Handrails lined the floor and walls, and Gavin inched his way over to the door mechanism.The air in his suit was starting to go bad.***Mabok sat up.The ship lurched violently and shuddered for a few moments.A piece of debris had probably hit the ship.He had heard small fragments making tinkling noises against the hull earlier, but this time it was bigger.It might have caused some damage.He would try and contact his base in a few minutes and then go check out the damage.***Gavin jammed one lever down.He knew it closed the door from watching Purple Men while he was a prisoner.The bay door started closing.Gavin let out a sigh of relief.He saw a dent halfway down the doorway where the Soyuz had collided with the doorframe.The door lurched and stopped at the dent.Gavin jammed the lever down and held it down.The door lurched past the dent with a pop.The once bright Earth was just a sliver of blue and then was gone when the door finally latched shut.The bay was darker now.There were only a few dim lights.Gavin turned to the door mechanism.9Men lounged around in the ships quarters, resting after their shift was over.Calvin was throwing an old glove and his dog Baker would dash after it.The dog was getting very good at getting around in weightlessness.The men heard someone humming a patriotic tune.They turned around and noticed Wes floating next to his bunk.He took off his helmet and held it over his heart as he ceremoniously wrote one more tally on a paper on his bunk, which read, "Wess days in space. ""Do you know what this makes?"Wes asked Joe."What," Joe answered as he tinkered with one of the guns, "Your birthday?""Nope," Wes said, "My first one hundred days in space.""You sound like you think its an honor," Joe said."It is," Wes replied wistfully, "I figure Ill always look back with pride on my first hundred days.""I hope I dont have another hundred days.Youre not sick of it?"Joe asked incredulously."Hey, man," Wes answered, "This is the life!I havent had this much excitement since I fell into Hangmans Crick on my cousins four wheeler!""Youre amazing," Joe replied, "If you had a choice between going home and having another hundred days, what would you take?""The hundred days," Wes answered."I figured as much."Denz ran into the room and motioned towards Wes."Wes," he said in English, "Come on, planet is here!""Your English is better," Wes said in Purple Man.Denz smiled and nodded and they both left the room in a rush.Joe sat there, floating and shaking his head."I cant believe it," he said to himself, "Theyre excited about coming to another pothole of a planet!Its probably just like all the others weve come to."***Up in the cockpit, Gavin and Cliff were looking out the window."What do we got?"Wes asked as he and Denz came up the airlock."Same as usual," Gavin said."Grayish red," Cliff said, "cratered, a few prominent valleys, mountains, and...""What?"Wes said as Cliff hesitated."Polar ice caps," Cliff finished with a smile."Ice!"Denz said."Any water ice?"Wes asked."Well have to go down and find out," Cliff said."If there is any we can use it to fuel up again.""I want to take a look from outside," Wes said as he strained to see out the windows."Ill be suiting up to go out myself in a few minutes," Cliff said, "We need to find a good place to land.""Wait for me!"Wes said and grabbed Denzs arm."Come on, Purple, lets go!"Soon all three were climbing out of the airlock onto the top of the ship.Denz was the first to attach binoculars to his faceplate and start looking at the pole.Cliff and Wes just watched for a few minutes as the stark terrain cruised by beneath them.There wasnt much atmosphere on the brownish planet, and the craters and valleys below were sharper than life.Shadows lay across much of the crater bottoms and were cast from the mountain ranges as they approached the terminator dividing the day and night.The night side of the planet was cold and black."Id say the length of a day here is about sixty hours," Cliff said as he jotted down on a clipboard where the terminator was."The axis is tilted enough that there are seasons here, enough for polar caps to get really big.The top one is in winter now. "Wes listened to Cliff but didnt really hear what he was saying.The edge of the polar cap was in sight and its brilliant white reflection and swirling lines of ice and rock were dazzling.They were hundreds of miles from the surface, but to Wes, it seemed like he could have seen individual people if they were there."When do we head down?"Wes asked.***"The tanks are filled to overflowing, Commander," an officer called to Krid Zaff as he looked up from the fuel gauges in the cockpit."Make ready to set a bearing," Krid replied."Yes, sir.""The trail will be cold," Krid said to himself."Yes, sir, Ill signal the depot that were undocking.""Good," Krid said, "And dont worry.Well find them."***The Pinak glided swiftly over the planet surface.Ridges and alternating patches of rock and ice flashed in the cockpit window.Jeff pointed to a large, white valley that could barely be seen behind dark peaks and ridges.The dim sun reflected off of the ice."Yes, thats a good spot," Denz said.Gavin eased back on the control levers and the ship shuddered.The Shark slowed to a stop and then Gavin lowered it to the surface.As they landed, the Shark lurched several times as the ice cracked beneath them, and then they came to a rest.The nearby sun was barely above the horizon and the shadows were long and dark.Four men in the bay, Cliff, Wes, Javier, and Denz, snapped their helmets and gloves into place and pumped the air out of the bay.Then Denz grabbed what looked like a vacuum cleaner connected to a large hose."Open the gate," he said to Wes over his intercom."The door," Wes corrected."Yes, open the door," Denz said with a grin.The door slid open and they hopped outside.Gravity was pretty light here, and they could skip around quite easily.Denz started up the machine he was holding.Churning blades soon began chopping up the ice and shoveling it into the machine.Soon water began coursing through the hose."Put pipe in tank," Denz called to Cliff, who was still inside the bay.Cliff fed the pipe through the hatch into the engine compartment and then into the fuel tank.Wes and Javier began wandering around on the ice.***"Krid," a Purple Man called into Krids quarters, "We are arriving at the Political Prison station.""Okay," Krid said as he snapped out of sleep, "Begin the docking procedure and get me the officer that was the station lookout when the Reds escaped.""Yes, sir.""Oh, and get the first mate up," Krid called as the Purple Man left, "I want to see him."Krid got out of his sleeping bag and put on his boots.He stretched and then straightened his uniform.The first mate came in."First mate, Lang, reporting," the man said."Lang," Krid said, "Do you remember what condition the Reds ship was in?""Yes, sir.""Did they still have weapons on board?""Yes, sir.The guards hadn't removed all of the guns before the Reds escaped.""Thats what I was afraid of," Krid said grimly, "I am surprised at how well they fought off our shock troops.I didn't expect that fierce of a fight from people so new to space battles.What about other supplies?""They have enough supplies to last a little while, but their fuel was almost gone.""How much did they have?""Enough for about 7 parsecs.""They will have to stop for fuel soon.Lang," he said, "I don't know what is going on at this prison, but it doesn't seem right.""I agree," Lang said, "If only Oligarch Sanzen hadn't been killed.Unfortunately, he was one of the few Oligarchs who advocated trying to make peace with the Reds.By killing him, the Reds only made it worse for themselves.""I would like to talk with these Reds myself," Krid said."We might be able to reach some agreement, even if negotiations aren't allowed.""Always bending the rules," Lang said, "You haven't changed from our days on the Gritfal Tez.""Yes, I have changed," Krid said, "Now I outrank you."Lang laughed, but was cut short by another officer coming in the room."Commander?"he called out."Go, ahead," Krid said."Weve docked and we're loading the information on the Red's trajectory now, sir.""Good, well meet in the chartroom."***A few minutes later, Krid and Lang were in the chartroom across from an officer from the prison."Lets get right to it," Krid started, "Did you plot their course as they left the station?""Yes, sir," the man said and handed over a clipboard.Krid looked over it quickly and gave it to Lang, who went to a console and typed in some numbers.In the middle of the room a raised table lit up and projected a three dimensional display into the air.All the nearby stars were bright pinpoints of light hovering in the air."Plot the bearing," Krid said.A yellow line appeared, stabbing out from the center of the display, where a red light signified the Political Prison station.Krid followed it with his eyes down the length of the beam."They probably got much farther than that," Lang suggested quietly."They can be almost anywhere now after all this time has passed since they left.""No they can't," a nasally voice added, "Their computer system was shut down shortly after they left.My guards inserted a virus into their computer that shuts down the whole computer system and erases all memory storage. "Krid and Lang turned to see one of the Liaisons walk in.He was a skinny man with his Liaison's uniform groomed to perfection."So their ship is now virtually useless," he finished in an annoying, nasal tone."Sir," Krid said, "I don't believe we've met. ""Commander Gornig," the Liaison said."Can they restore the computer system?"Lang asked."The two Purple Men that are with them must have some superior cyber attack skills to have captured so many ships," Gornig said."But, the virus was created by the Oligarchs' own special cyber attack team.It's very unlikely that they can break it.Also, since this is such a sensitive operation, the Oligarchs have directed me to take direct command of your Frigate and your Sloks myself.I will conduct the search.""Sir," Krid said, "This has never been done before.It would be wise to let the Navy conduct the operation.We have the training and  " "  You will hand over those ships and their crews to me, Zaff," Gornig barked."Sanzen was the last of the Oligarchs to hold on to the old notion that the Liaisons shouldn't command naval forces.With him gone, the Oligarchs have been able to advance a more modern agenda.""Then you only leave me my Pinak?"Krid asked."Thats right, Zaff," Gornig answered, "You are free to return to the Sixth Fleet for further orders."Krid just clenched his fists."Youd better pack up your stuff out of your cabin," Gornig said, "Well be setting out soon.Ive already signaled for your Pinak to dock at the starboard lock to pick you up."Krid looked like he was about to explode, but Lang pulled him back."Krid," Lang said, "Lets just go."Krid growled, "Now they're letting the Liaisons take command of naval forces!"Lang kept Krid moving towards his quarters."Krid, wed better report back to the Sixth Fleet.We dont have any other orders yet.""That's right, Lang, I havent received any other orders yet, so there's nothing to keep me from going after the Reds with my Pinak.Besides, Ill be able to move faster without the big ships.""What, do you think you'll be able to find them before Gornig?"Lang said."Yes," Krid said.He hurriedly started putting his stuff into a duffel bag."You heard him, Lang, he thinks the virus will destroy the Reds computers.But we know that our cyber attacks were completely ineffective.We couldn't even detect their computer signature."Krid finished packing and closed up his duffel bag."But Gornig's virus was written by the best cyber attackers we have," Lang said."It might do the job.""Maybe," Krid said, "But what if the Reds weren't using computers?""That's impossible," Lang said, "Controlling the ship without computers?It's suicide.""Amazing isn't it," Krid said with a grin, "But if I'm right, the Reds are running their ships manually.Gornig is going to be completely at a loss when he finds out that the virus didn't stop them.We'll be able to catch the Reds first and give the Liaisons a little embarrassment."***Krid watched from the cockpit of his Pinak as Gornig left the station with Krids Frigate and two Sloks."Hes cruising out there like hes on parade," Lang said, and then turned to notice Lod enter the cockpit."Ah, Lod," Krid said to his Liaison Officer."Youre back with us, I see.""Yes, Im back with you," Lod said."But I'm confused.Did the Sixth Fleet order you to do a survey here?I thought the maps of the area were sufficient."***"Its cold," Javier said as he walked around on the ice."My fingers are getting a little cold.""Check out my faceplate!"Wes said, pointing to the glass on his helmet, "Im getting frost on it.""Think this stuff will make snowballs?""I don't know, but we'd better move the equipment to a new spot.We're getting down to bare rock over here.A few more tons of ice and we'll have all the fuel we need."Inside the ship, Joe, Frank, and Sam had the dinner shift in the ships galley."Is your arm better now?"Sam asked Joe."Yeah, it feels fine.I still have a little scar," Joe replied."I guess we just wait around, then," Frank muttered."Yeah," answered Joe, "I didnt know how boring space could be.""No kidding," Sam said, "But it sounded exciting.When the astronauts brought back the Pinak they had taken, it seemed like something out of the movies.I was at the Air Base then and I thought that anything would be more exciting than the job I had.""What was your job," Frank asked."I worked on jet fighters.""That was boring?"Joe asked incredulously."I never got to fly in them, except once or twice a year.The rest of the time was just sitting around on the ground doing nothing," Sam answered."I thought that space was going to be nonstop action.""Thats what I thought," Joe said."I thought Id be famous," Frank agreed."You might be famous when we get back, though," Sam said."Still, Id much rather be any old joe, as long as I was on Earth," Frank mused, then added quickly, "Nothing personal, Joe."Joe nodded with a smile, then added, "Id rather be home, too.I dont care if no one on the face of the Earth knew I existed.Id give anything just to go swimming in the summertime, with the warm sun, and a fresh breeze.""Cut it out, Joe," Sam said, "You're getting me homesick.""You know what I want?"Frank asked, "I want a hometown breakfast.Eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, pancakes, French toast."Sam groaned and gripped his stomach, "Youre killing me, man."Joe grinned and nodded, tossing his packet of gruel away with a misty eyed expression."Hey, you guys!"came Jeffs abrupt call from below.The three men knew his voice well.Jeff floated into the galley."Hey, get moving!Its our turn to get a load of water.""See, Sam," Joe said as he got ready, "Its not all complete boredom.""Yeah," Sam said wryly, "We get to be water boys."***Once the Shark was full of fuel and back in orbit, Jose was on top of the Shark on lookout, but he was having trouble keeping his eyes open.He blinked hard and shook his head.The stars began to get blurry.One of them was moving."I must be really tired," he mumbled to himself.He shook his head, blinked, and looked at it again.It really was moving.He grabbed his binoculars and took a look."Gavin!"he called."GAVIN!"Gavin snapped out of his doze and grabbed an intercom."What?""Weve got another ship coming in!"Jose called."What kind?""I dont know, but I think they spotted us.""All men to your stations!"Jeff yelled."Its a Pinak!"Jose called over the intercom.Gavin called out some commands and the Shark roared and began breaking away from the planet.***"Krid," Lang called as he lowered his binoculars.Krid looked up from his computer screen."They have spotted us.They are beginning to flee.""Can we catch them?"Krid asked."They have a more favorable orbit.It will give them a head start.""If we swept closer to the planet, the gravity would slingshot us out into space with an increase in velocity.It might give us the extra velocity we need."Lang smiled, "Why yes, thats right.""Dive closer to the surface."***"We're losing them, Gavin," Jose called from his lookout post."Good," Gavin sighed, "Once we get completely out of sight, we can throttle back down."After the planet was out of sight, Gavin leaned back and switched off the engines.Cliff walked in behind him."Question," Gavin said, "Anything in the scopes?""No," Cliff answered with a grin, "Were all clear.Im pretty sure we lost them.They went behind the planet, so I don't think they were even trying to follow us.""I have one more question for you, Cliff.""What?""How do we get home?"Cliffs grin sagged a little bit."I was hoping you wouldnt bring that up.Ive been looking over my maps, and I still havent figured out a connection.""What do you mean, Cliff?""Well, I have my maps from before we were captured, and I have my maps after we escaped.The problem is that I dont know how to get from where we are now to where we were before we were captured.""How far could we have traveled while we were prisoners in the equipment bay?"Gavin asked."Pretty far," Cliff answered, "Far enough that I dont recognize any of the stars.My plan is to go over my maps and look for familiar constellations, and then I could find a way home.""Have you found any constellations that you recognize?""Its not that simple," Cliff sighed, "The constellations will have been distorted because we traveled to a different vantage point and we are seeing them from a different angle.Im not even sure that I know how to do it.""Well, if you need anything, well be here for you.Just find the way home.""Ill try, Gavin.""Gavin!"came a call over the intercom.It was Jose."Yes?""We got another ship in sight," Jose called, "It's coming up fast and it looks like the same old Pinak that found us at the ice planet."How did they follow us?""I dont know, Gavin.""Blast!"Gavin slammed his fist onto the control panel, which sent him drifting upward and he hit his head on the ceiling."Ah!"he hissed."How did they do that?""We just lost the intercoms," Jeff yelled.***"Pretty good, Zaff," Lod said with a shrug as he looked through the telescope, "Im surprised that you were lucky enough to find the Reds during your survey.""Youre right," Krid said, then glanced around the cabin and stood up."We got lucky.Set maximum speed.Were going to catch them this time.""Yes, sir."***"I dont know how they did that," Gavin kept saying as he shook his head."Denz, what is wrong with our ship?They're still catching up""They have a Pinak just like us," Denz said, "So they shouldn't be catching up.They must have found a way to boost their speed.""How close are they, Jose?"Gavin called on the intercom."Looks like a mile and closing," Jose called back."Get the cannons ready to fire," Gavin commanded."You cant win in a firefight with Krid Zaff," Denz said."Maybe we could ram them. ""No," Gavin answered, "That would damage our ship.""Why dont we ram them with the landing craft?""That might work," Gavin said and pondered the thought for a while."It is either that, or we dock and take them in hand to hand combat," Denz said."Okay," Gavin said determinedly, "Ram them with the landing craft."***Denz looked around him in the landing craft cockpit and spotted the throttle.He eased the lever forward and the engines roared to life.The landing craft shuddered and strained against its docking bolts, trying to break free of the Shark.He took one last look and hopped out.He pulled a thermal knife out of its sheath and held it up to one of the docking bolts.Joe did the same with the other bolt.Denz raised his arm and signaled to turn the ship.Jeff saw it in the bay and motioned to the men to turn starboard.Then Denz motioned for them to stop and waved to Joe.Denz and Joe hacked into the bolts.Sparks flew as the special knives seared through the metal and then the landing craft lurched free.The blast from its engines knocked the men over and the boat careened off towards Krids Pinak.Denz scrambled to his feet in time to see Joe drifting off into space."Joe!"he yelled.By the time Denz was able to get a grappling hook out of his bag, Joe had drifted twenty yards away.Denz fired the hook, which streamed through space and smacked into Joe's helmet with a sickening crack.Joe opened his eyes and breathed a sigh of relief.His helmet hadn't broken."That's the last time I complain about being bored," he said to himself as Denz hauled him in.***The other Reds watched tensely as the landing craft hurtled toward the enemy ship.The other Pinak turned to the side to avoid the landing craft, but Krid's Pinak didn't move fast enough.The landing craft plunged into the side of the Pinak, glancing off of the hull and sliding off into space.Dents and cracks could be seen in the rear hull of Pinak.Gas and debris was spewing out of the fissures in the armor.Jose strained to see through the gas and debris.Then he keyed his mike.The intercoms worked again."Gavin," he called."Yeah," Gavin answered."They seemed to be stopped.They arent following us anymore," Jose called excitedly.Gavin and the others whooped in delight and soon the men all over the ship were dancing and singing."Yeehaw!"Wes yelled, "Just like the movies!"***Krid braced himself for the damage reports.Lang came in quickly with the news."Krid," he said slowly, "We have a leak in the fuel tanks and one of the engines is smashed.""Do we have any spares?"Krid asked, expecting the worst."We do have a spare engine, but it will take some time to unpack it.""These Reds are turning out to be my most interesting challenge yet," Krid said.That evening, the whole crew of the Shark gathered for a discussion.They sat in a circle in the shade of their ship.The shadows were slowly creeping toward the horizon as the orange sun fell behind the distant hills."First of all," Gavin started, "We need to decide on our plan."Everyone nodded in agreement."Jeff," Gavin said, "Whats the water situation?""Weve got enough water in the Shark for about two weeks here," Jeff said, "so that would be an Earth month.""Wes," Gavin said, nodding in his direction, "What about food?""Weve only got a little mush, but enough jerky to last quite a while," Wes said."I bet the mush is still going to last a lot longer than the jerky," Javier mumbled, "That stuff tastes like  ""If we had a little salt," Wes said defensively, "It wouldnt be that bad.""Okay," Gavin said, holding his hand out for quiet, "Now we need to decide how much food and water we want to store up before we leave here.""Well," Jeff said, "How long do you think it will take to get home, Cliff?""I dont know," Cliff said, "But Im guessing two or three months.""Okay, lets get enough lizard meat and gourds for three months," Gavin said, "Now, how much water do we need for fuel?""We're running dry pretty fast," Jeff said, "We're drinking a lot and there isn't any water around here.""I can go out on a search mission to find some water," Cliff suggested, "If I take the chimeras, I could carry enough supplies to go pretty far.""Who knows where the water will be, if there is any water here," Jeff said.When Sam heard that, he sat up."I know where water is," Sam said."In the chimera den there is a deep tunnel that reaches down to the water table.""How deep is it?"Gavin asked."I dont know," he shrugged, "Several hundred feet, Id guess.""Can we dig our own?"Gavin asked.Everyone in the circle looked questioningly at each other.After a few moments, Calvin spoke up."If the water is several hundred feet down, I doubt we could dig a well that deep with what we have.""Can we use the tunnels the chimeras have already made?"Joe asked."If you even get close, the chimeras will try to kill you," Jeff warned, "They seem to be fiercely protective of their den.""The chimeras usually stayed close to the entrance," Sam said, "When I was down deep I didn't see any.If we could get into those deeper tunnels, we might have a chance at getting down to the water without them seeing us.""How do we do that?"Wes asked skeptically.
