Often people would refuse to leave their machine once they were addicted to the world inside, and sometimes people would die from not meeting their essential needs in the real world.For Ajax the technology was just a way of escaping the confines of his life on the Out Drifter.The virtual worlds gave him a rare feeling of freedom, and freedom was a precious commodity in his life.He considered life on the Out Drifter as a life of confinement and restriction.He felt that he had no real freedom because he belonged to a crew and had to follow orders.He respected Captain Michael more than any other person, but he knew there was a limit as to how much he could take and that soon he would have to move on.**  Ajax was sitting beside a pristine stream which was situated between two snow capped mountains.Rows of towering pines ascended the mountainsides.He could see silver fish swimming through the crystal clear water.He lay back on the soft grass and looked up at the bright blue sky.He felt completely relaxed and at peace.He was smiling dreamily up at the majestic clouds above as birds cheeped and the sound of the flowing water relaxed his mind.So this is where you go when everyone sleeps, said Cynthia.He leapt to his feet and his smile melted away.What are you doing here?he yelled.This is my world.I built this place.You have no right to be here!Cynthia was standing beside the stream.She took two steps back.Im sorry.There was a spare helmet.I didnt realise I wasnt allowed to use it.Ajax shook his head and muttered some words under his breath.Youre meant to be in deep sleep.That spare helmet is my property!Cynthia beheld the icy mountain tops.The beauty of the virtual world was quite astounding.Rays of light were reflecting off the mountainsides, creating a golden glowing haze in the sky, which shimmered over the mist filled distant valleys.I will leave if you want me to, but I have to say this place is amazing.I had no idea that such places could be so beautiful.How big is this world?The question distracted Ajax from his initial annoyance.Very big, he grumbled.This is my favourite place.I constructed all of this.There is a small town on the far side of those mountains.There are a few people living there.People?she questioned.Theyre written into the programming.Do they seem as real as this world does?Lets just say that you cant have a deep and meaningful conversation with them.Can you give me a tour?Ajax crossed his arms and turned away.I told you this is my world.You should have asked for my permission.I apologised.Sorry isnt good enough, he snapped.Ill go then, she said, turning away.She took a few steps and prepared to exit the program.Cynthia, dont go yet.She glanced over her shoulder.Ajax, either you want me here or you dont want me here.Ajax lowered his eyes.Half the time I dont know what I want, he muttered.Why?Whats wrong with you?Nothing!His face hardened.Theres nothing wrong with me!Whats wrong with you?She turned away from him and disappeared from sight.**  Michael woke to the sound of the ships automatic alarm, which was usually a warning of a critical malfunctions or a potential threat.The alarm was set to instantly open the deep sleep pods.Ajax was standing in the room.Wake up, wake up, ladies and gentlemen; it looks like we have a grade A salvage opportunity, he said loudly, clapping his hands to rouse them from sleep.Michael sat up and quickly stepped out of his pod.He shook his arms to help the blood flow back through his body.Whats the story?The scanners picked up an abandoned cruiser.I dont know what type; you know Im no good at working the computer, but the analysis panel is saying its a goldmine.Ill check it out, said Sara in a sleepy voice as she slipped out of her sleeping pod and shuffled across to the door; her legs were still adjusting.Michael followed Sara and Ajax down to the control room.Sara took her seat and checked the scanner display.Its an old colonist ship.Colonial Standmast Class 12.The engine components are rare and valuable.Its probably at least a hundred years old.There should be a lot to salvage.Are there any signs of life?Just a second, she said as she flipped to another screen.Nothing, Captain; no people or droids.The reactor is depleted and life support is offline.There should be enough air for us to board without space suits, but it will be very cold in there.There are no signs of significant damage.I think its been abandoned and left floating.Pay day, said Ajax with a broad grin.Ajax, prepare the crew, said Michael.You got it, Cap.Ajax walked back toward the cargo bay.Sara brought the ship out of interstellar speed.The engines rumbled as the Out Drifter slowed to standard speed.She then angled the ship in the direction of the abandoned cruiser.Michael watched through the viewing panel as the ship appeared in the distance.The cruiser was about a hundred metres long.It was shaped like a hammer, with a long thin cylindrical back section which was intersected by a cross section at the front.Such ships were primarily used by colonists and explorers who were searching for new worlds in the regions beyond the boundaries of human civilisation.Their chief function was to provide their crew with the ability to survive for long periods of exploration.They were equipped with a range of scanners and other instruments for examining the suitability of worlds for colonisation.The long narrow section that extended toward the back of the ship was the engine block.The engine had been built for the purpose of extended space flights in a singular direction; such ships lacked the ability to maneuver or perform any agile movements.There were at least forty billion stars in the Triangulum Galaxy.Billions of stars had yet to be surveyed by humanity.With so many undiscovered systems, the culture of colonisation had always been strong throughout history, even twelve thousand years after the arrival of humanity in Triangulum.Colonists were often idealistic people who wanted to improve their lot in life and find a world where they could live in peace, far away from the controls of the Epherian Empire, the Trade Guild and the many feudal houses and corporations who ruled the Outer Worlds.However, even with so many uncharted stars systems, it was often difficult for colonists to find a world which could sustain human life and even more difficult to find a world with prime conditions for life to grow.Prime worlds were prized and often fought over by colonists.Many colonists would settle for less than ideal worlds out of desperation and a lack of resources to continue their search.Sara angled the Out Drifter toward one of the security doors on the section at the front of the colonist ship.She masterfully glided the ship downward.Michael was reminded of her awesome skill every time she performed such a maneuver.He knew he was fortunate to have such a talented pilot aboard.He often wondered why she didnt leave to join the war effort, as he knew that such gifted pilots were in high demand among the war fleets facing the aliens.The magnetic clamps extended like claws and secured the Out Drifter to the hull of the other ship.Well done, Sara.Another perfect attachment, he said as he stood up and walked back to the cargo bay.Ajax, Cynthia, Ivan and Ethan were gearing up and preparing to disembark.Michael picked up his charged particle rifle.If the scanners are saying there are no lifeforms we wont need much gear, Cap, said Ajax.You can never be too careful, said Michael.He then turned to Cynthia.Her eyes revealed a high level of anxiety.She noticed him looking at her and she quickly averted her eyes.Are you feeling okay, Cynthia?She gave a curt nod.Fine, Captain, she replied.You dont look fine, said Ajax with a hoarse chuckle.You look terrified, and this isnt even a dangerous mission.Cynthias pale skin turned bright red, and her eyes narrowed as she stared back at Ajax.Im not afraid of anything.I can do anything you can do, she said sharply.Really!Do you think you can carry this plasma enforcer for me?Im sure I could, she said, stepping forward to reach for the massive gun.Ajax stepped back from her.Cynthia.I just want you to observe this mission and help out when needed, said Michael.Dont carry anything.Ethan walked over to the exit door and lifted the quantum code breaker.Captain, there is enough air on the other side for us to remain in the ship for about an hour.The odd thing is that the ship has no codes.What are you talking about?questioned Ajax.The security system has been removed, said Ethan hesitantly.Who in their right mind would bother removing a security system?asked Ajax.Maybe its a trap, suggested Cynthia in a low voice.Michael stared at the door for a long moment.Have your rifles ready.Ethan, open the door.Ethan opened the Out Drifters exit door and the door of the Standmast ship.They were instantly hit by the icy air.Michael pointed a flashlight into the darkened ship.The cruisers main service corridor was directly ahead of them; it cut through the living quarters of the ship.Light it up, said Michael.Ethan fired a florescent flare down the corridor.Instantly glowing mist lit the entire length of the way.The corridor was completely empty.There were four doors on each side which were spaced at intervals, and there was a single security door which led to the engine block.All right, everyone.I want to do a complete sweep of the entire ship.Cynthia, Ethan; come with me.Well see what can be salvaged from the engine.Ajax and Ivan; see if you can find anything to salvage in the main living compartments.No problem, Cap, said Ajax as he stepped into the corridor.Michael led Cynthia and Ethan to the engine block security door.The door was jammed in place with a gap just wide enough to pass through.Ethan shot a flare down the full length of the narrow corridor beyond.There were indents with control consoles for the engine set at intervals along the length of the corridor.The corridor cut directly through the elongated engine block.Many colonist ship engines used a similar method of firing particles down a long shaft directly into a reactor.When the particles struck the reactor at full speed they would cause a chain reaction which would significantly reduce the consumption of fuel.The process would then be repeated as the fuel depleted, which would enable ships to travel vast distances through space without refuelling.The problem was that these ships were not useful for other purposes because the engines were unable to increase or decrease power rapidly.What do you think, Ethan?Can you remove the particle accelerators?I think theyre worth about twenty thousand each.Ethan walked down to the first console.Its going to take some time, but I can remove them one by one.Michaels wrist com suddenly beeped....Cap, I think you better come and take a look at this said Ajax.Did you find something good?I dont know if good is the right word  What is it?asked Michael.Lets just say that this ship isnt abandoned  Damn it, said Michael as he turned on his heel.Cynthia and Ethan followed him out of the engine corridor and back into the main corridor.The mist from the flare was still providing a faint glow.Ajax appeared at a side door and indicated for them to come in.Inside was a large room with a two sleeping pods which were covered with scan defence polymer sheets.Michael had seen the polymer sheets before; they were mostly used by smugglers to disrupt scans performed by other ships.The sleeping pods were occupied.Are they dead?asked Michael as he peered down at one of the occupants who was a middle aged woman.No, they have wired their sleeping pods to a separate power source which has been cloaked in the same manner as the pods, said Ivan.It appears that their reactor was depleted and their only option for survival was to power their sleeping pods with a portable battery.Why would they cover their pods?Why are they hiding?I believe they are trying to protect themselves from being boarded by aliens, said Ivan.Aliens will not board a ship if they do not detect organic occupants.If they detected an abandoned ship they would most likely pass it by.How long have they been under?asked Ajax.Ninety six days, said Ivan as he viewed a small monitor on one of the pods.It looks like this mission is over, said Ajax.Its the code of the Outer World Salvage Guild; we cant take anything from an occupied ship.Lets go back to the Out Drifter.Ajax turned to leave and Michael was about to follow.We cant leave them like this, said Cynthia, grabbing Michaels arm.What are you talking about, snapped Ajax, turning towards her.These people are stranded, she said, staring directly into Ajaxs fierce eyes.Who will save them if we dont?Its not our problem, said Ajax.I knew the Cap was making a mistake when he let you join the crew.Its your first mission and youre already trying to give orders.Cynthia looked to Michael for support, but he held his silence.Captain, we cant leave these people.Its not right.We dont have a choice, said Ethan.If we picked up every stranded person we wouldnt have time for salvaging anything.We dont have room for them on the Out Drifter.You have to accept it, Cynthia; these people have nothing to do with us.We have to help these people, she said, raising her voice.Ajax groaned and gave a dismissive wave.This is ridiculous.Lets go, Cap.Michael stared at the two stranded occupants of the sleeping pods.We will take a vote.Ajax shook his head and groaned.I cant believe you are allowing a vote.This is crazy.I vote to save them, said Cynthia.Ethan?asked Michael.No, Captain, he replied.Ivan?I am bound by my programming which is dependent on the intention of the direct task at hand.Therefore I cannot vote.You have to vote.Should we save these people?asked Michael.If the question is simply whether we should save two colonists who would die otherwise then I must vote yes because my underlying programming framework is in favour of saving life.That vote cant be counted, growled Ajax.It will be counted, stated Michael flatly.So it comes down to you, Cap, said Ajax.You know this is foolish.A minute ago you were about to follow me directly out of here without a second thought.Lets keep going to Zeno Par.Remember were a salvage crew.Michael thought back to the time when he had been exiled from the Epherian Empire and remembered when he had no one to turn to.If he hadnt been given a chance by random strangers he would have died of starvation.I vote yes, he said.Ajaxs jaw dropped.This is madness, he said under his breath.What about Sara.She still has to vote.Michael nodded in agreement and lifted his wrist com.Sara, we found two people in deep sleep on the ship.We are having a vote to determine if we should save them.Which way are you going to vote?I trust you made the right choice, Captain.Which way did you vote?...To save them, he replied.Then I agree with you...Thats four against two, said Michael.Ivan, open the pods.FOUR      The sleeping pod glass cover slid back and an instant later the woman opened her bright, blue eyes.She was at least forty years old with a lined face and sandy blonde hair which was greying at the sides.She instantly sat up and looked at the crew who were standing around her pod.Who are you, she asked, coughing as she spoke.My name is Captain Michael Cornelius of the Out Drifter.We are a salvage crew.A salvage crew, she repeated.She scanned the faces.How long have we been asleep?Ninety six days according to the control console, said Ivan.Ivan opened the second pod.The man inside woke up and sat bolt upright.He had a thin build and was about seventy years old.His dark eyes widened with fear as he looked at the heavily armed crew.He reached for a pistol which had been hidden behind the inner edge of the sleeping pod.Ajax stepped forward and lifted his rifle.Thats no way to treat your rescue party.The old man froze in place and stared at Ajax for a long moment.He visibly relaxed.Im sorry, he said in a faint voice.I didnt know if you were friends or foes.At first I thought you were pirates.Were not friends or foes, and were certainly not pirates, said Ajax as he reached over and took the mans pistol.Who are you?asked the old man.Were salvors, replied Ajax gruffly.Why are you helping us?I dont know, answered Ajax cynically.He looked back at Michael.You see.Even they think us helping them is weird.Ajax turned back to the old man.Consider today your lucky day.We have assessed your ship.Its inoperable.You can come aboard our ship; we will drop you off at the next safe planet, said Michael.I thank you for your assistance, Captain Michael, she said.My name is Aradel, and this is my uncle Adrastus.We are colonists from Herman Beta 3.Herman Beta 3.I thought the Herman worlds were not suitable for colonisation, said Ethan, raising an eyebrow.We only have a small settlement equipped to meet the needs of no more than one hundred people, but we only had eighteen people living in the settlement.The worlds surrounding Herman Beta are mostly deserted with the exception of a few smaller mining operations.We thought that we were remote enough not to draw the attention of either pirates or aliens.She cast her eyes downward and her pale face revealed her deep distress and grief.A little more than three months ago we left for a supply run to Moon 419.We received a transmission that our colony was under attack.The aliens found our settlement.We turned our ship around in an attempt to return to save our family, but we had a major reactor malfunction, and we were forced to enter the sleeping pods.Im sorry to hear about your loss, said Cynthia.All is not lost, said Aradel, a glimmer of hope appearing in her eyes.We were prepared for the possibility of an alien attack.We constructed a secret vault when we first settled on Herman Beta 3.It is hidden beneath the settlement and protected by an anti scanning shield.The vault has sleeping pods and supplies.My son sent one last transmission to say that three of the colonists made it to the vault and had avoided being detected by the aliens.I know theyre alive.Once aliens conquer a settlement they always leave a battle group behind to prevent the humans returning, said Ajax, his voice was flat and emotionless.Even if there are survivors there is no way you would be able to get to them without a fight.We are not soldiers, said Aradel.You could employ some mercenaries to help you, said Ethan.Good luck with that, said Ajax, shaking his head.You wont find many mercenaries who have fighting aliens on their list of services.Even so, we dont have any money, said Aradel.Would you help us?The crew was silenced by the question.Ajax shook his head and walked out.I am sorry to hear your story, Aradel, said Michael.You have to understand that we dont have the firepower to deal with an alien battlegroup.As I already said: we will take you to the next safe stop; then youre on your own.I should be thankful for the fact that you saved us.Im sorry for asking too much, she said.**  The Out Drifters engines fired up, and they left the derelict ship behind with the two extra passengers on board.Sara reset the course for Zeno Par.Aradel and Adrastus had agreed to let them salvage anything they liked from the Standmast ship.Michael transferred three thousand credits to Aradels GCTD.Aradel had initially refused any payment as she believed that being rescued was payment enough, but Michael insisted because it was a part of the Outer World Salvage Guild code that nothing owned by another could be salvaged without permission and payment.Michael, Ivan and Cynthia were seated in the living room around the table.Why wont we help them?asked Cynthia.Surely we can at least try.Michael leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest.He drew a deep breath and sighed before replying.I hope this wont be an ongoing problem.Cynthia, you have to realise that we will come across many people in similar situations.We cant help everyone.Im not asking you to help everyone, but I think we could try to help them.I looked up their world on the navigation computer; its not far away.We could at least investigate.Ajax walked into the room and stared harshly down at Cynthia.I can guarantee I wont put up my hand when it comes to the crew vote on whether you stay or not, he said.Cynthias eyes widened with surprise.A moment later her expression hardened.Im just trying to help these people.We have enough problems, said Ajax.Dont you care?These people are desperate.Firstly, you are right, I dont care; and secondly, marching into an alien infested world is a guaranteed way to meet an early death.We are not equipped for such a mission, and you can bet your last credit that there wont be any survivors left in their hidden vault.You cant know for sure, murmured Cynthia.I know.Aliens dont take prisoners.Ajax groaned.Cap, you have to tell Cynthia to stop doing this.Shes driving me insane.Michael liked the fact that she cared, but he also knew Ajax was right about the risks involved in such a mission; the idea of trying to rescue people stranded on an alien conquered world was far beyond their capability.Cynthia, I appreciate that you want to help these people, but you have to understand that even approaching an alien occupied world would be very dangerous.Cynthia lowered her eyes and gave a slight nod.Aradel and Adrastus are happy that we were prepared to take them to a safe port.Thats all we can do for them.**  The Out Drifters engines were at full power and they were travelling at interstellar speed.Cynthia was sitting in the co pilots seat beside Sara who was completing her last checks of the autopilot settings.How are you finding your time on the Out Drifter?asked Sara, not looking up from the control console.I dont think I will stay long.Ajax told me that he is going to vote me off the crew.Sara gave a warm smile.Dont worry about him.She paused for a few moments before continuing.He has mood swings.One minute he is the friendliest man in the galaxy, the next he is looking for any excuse to argue with anyone.Half of what he says is not what he means.You clearly dont like him either, said Cynthia.No, I wouldnt say that.He has some redeeming qualities.Hes a good fighter, and he always gets the job done, but like most people he has some problems.He has been through a lot in his life, and some of the things hes seen and experienced have left lasting wounds.Drinking distracts him from having to face the pain.Cynthia noticed an orange light on the communication console light up.Sara looked at the light and flicked several switches.Its an encoded emergency beacon, she said as she turned a dial beneath the light.What does it mean?asked Cynthia.It means someone is in trouble and they dont want the aliens to know their location.The message is sent in three separate waves which are scrambled and then reconfigured further away from the beacon.The system uses an algorithm that predicts the bending of waves through space and brings them back together at a distant point.Its an old technology, but its probably not monitored by the aliens.Look, heres the message.The voice of a young man could be heard faintly from the com speaker.Emergency.Emergency.Please respond.We are stranded on Herman Beta 3.We belong to a colony which has been attacked by aliens.Our power supply is dwindling and our food synthesizers are offline.There are aliens here.We are hiding.They havent found us yet.Please help us.Cynthias heart leapt in her chest.We have to respond.Can we talk with him?Sara didnt answer for a few moments; she blankly stared at the console.No.The message is seven days old, she said, glancing across at Cynthia.Its probably best that you dont tell Aradel and Adrastus about this.What!Why not?Because this message will probably upset them.But they have to know.Sara drew a deep breath.Cynthia.I fought the aliens for years before I joined the Out Drifter.These stranded colonists will not make it.Theyre already dead.They may have an untraceable hiding place, but once they come out into the open the aliens will make light work of them.But surely there is something we can do.Captain Michael stepped into the confined control room.Something we can do about what?he asked.We just received an encoded message from the surviving colonists on Herman Beta 3, said Sara.Michael nodded; his face was strained.Let me hear it.Sara hit a switch and the message replayed.Michael stood completely still, looking down at the com speaker until the message finished.He gave a curt nod and turned to leave.Youre not going to say anything?questioned Cynthia.He glanced back over his shoulder.I dont think theres anything to say.How can you be so cold?asked Cynthia in a raised voice.Cold he replied, his brow furrowing.Let me clearly explain this to you, he said as he turned back around to face her.No one is happy about the alien invasion.Many people have died trying to hold back their advance, and many more will die before the war is over.This situation with the colonists is tragic, but there is nothing we can do to save them.Sara knows this, I know this, and you should also accept this as a fact.We cant help those stranded colonists.I believe we can try!she said firmly.Michael was silent for a few moments.Cynthia, what is your problem?he asked.Cynthia averted her eyes and didnt answer.Tell me, Cynthia!Thats an order from your captain.She glanced up at him with sad eyes and began to speak in little more than a whisper.I didnt grow up on X5126.My parents were colonists on Petramorning 7.About four years ago the alien fleet was approaching our world.Our small colony didnt own a spacecraft, so we had no way of escaping the invasion.We sent out requests for help.We knew there were human ships in the Petramorning system, but only one ship answered our call.The ship was owned by a ruthless and greedy merchant.He took advantage of our desperation and vulnerability.He agreed to save only one of us, and his price was every last credit owned by the entire colony.There were forty four colonists, and we decided to draw straws to see who would be saved.My mother drew the saving straw and she insisted that I go in her place.I was the only survivor of the Petramorning 7 colony.I never saw my parents again.They were killed by the aliens.Michael listened intently.He had heard many stories of people cruelly making money from the desperation of people fleeing the invasion.Im sorry to hear about your loss.My parents died because no one helped us.No one even tried to help us.Sara didnt say a word.Michael looked out through the viewing panel into the darkness of space.A dim star in the distance drew his attention, and he stared at the faint glow.There was once a time, before he was banished from the Epherian Empire, when he would have never questioned a request for help from stranded colonists.For the first time he realised that the battle was not just with the aliens.There was a conflict deep inside his own mind, and there was a question that refused to leave him in peace.For many years he had been on the run, and he had turned his back on his past and his real purpose.He knew the time was coming when he would not be able to run anymore.We will try to save the colonists, he said.Captain, you know this is a bad idea, said Sara firmly.I know.Each crew member will have the option to sit this one out.Sara, you dont have to come on this mission.You know I will, said Sara.This plan is reckless, but I never back down when it comes to aliens.Michael nodded and smiled.I know.FIVE      What!yelled Ajax.He abruptly stood up and kicked the wall with all his might, causing a small dent in the metal lining.This is totally crazy, Cap.This mission will get us killed.Take it easy, Ajax, said Michael sternly.The ship is already falling apart; it doesnt need your help.The entire crew were sitting around the table in the living room and had been gathered together to discuss the latest turn of events.Im giving everyone the choice to sit this one out.If anyone wants to wait on X5126 we will drop them off there and pick them up after the rescue.Ajax groaned and rolled his eyes.Thats a really bad deal, Cap.Firstly, you wont complete the rescue; secondly, anyone waiting on X5126 will be as good as stranded on that rotten piece of space junk!We have to be smart, Cap; come on, listen to me!Sorry, Ajax; Ive made up my mind.We will attempt the rescue.Now, let me see a show of hands.Are you in or out?Im in, Captain, said Cynthia instantly.I will participate in this mission, said Ivan in monotone.Im in, said Sara.Ethan and Ajax didnt say a word.Ethan, what will it be?asked Michael.Certain death or stranded on X5126 until I die, he replied dryly.I would prefer to die with the crew, so Im in.Dog Two barked and growled.Michael glanced at the ferocious beast for a moment.Sorry, Dog Two, I didnt know that I had to ask you.I think that means youre in, he said.Dog Two gave a high pitched yelp.We will turn the ship around and drop Ajax back at X5126, said Michael.Ajax grumbled and muttered under his breath.What are you trying to say?asked Michael.Ajax didnt reply.He turned his back on the crew and hung his head low.His eyes were wide with a hint of madness.Fine then, Im in.I might as well die fighting aliens.**  Sara set a course for the Herman Beta system.The Out Drifters engines rumbled toward full power.It was a two day journey to Herman Beta 3, and no one wanted to sleep for that time as they all knew that they were taking a massive risk and that those two days could possibly be their last.Sara was sitting in the control room and staring ahead into the vastness of space.Michael was beside her and busying himself with the control console.He was checking over some of the readings of the non critical systems.I surveyed the Herman Beta system on the charts, she said.There are five planets in the system and an extensive asteroid belt between the third and fourth.There is a good chance the aliens will detect our presence long before we arrive.
