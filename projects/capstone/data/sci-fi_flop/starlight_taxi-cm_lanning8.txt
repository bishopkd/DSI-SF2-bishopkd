His kind wasnt designed to set foot here.Hey Dominik, are you sure this is where you want to go?I mean, for a moral guy like yourself...this planet is like a cheese grater waiting to shave you down to size, the driver said.They came upon Payout City, a true testament to just how stubborn some people were to build a city and fill it with more casinos.The driver took it slow, letting anyone who wanted to pass him to do so.There were a lot of expensive vehicles on the road, and Starla, who looked like a rustbucket when compared to a standard vehicle, looked especially out of place.Payout City itself was built on the inside of a large crater.Black skyscrapers launched upward from the ground and didnt stop until they rose far above the canyon walls that sought to contain their structure.As the driver took the two of them into the crater city, he followed signs that directed him toward Sunrise General Medical Center.Traffic was so thick with other floating vehicles that even the experienced driver had to really concentrate to avoid being sent to the hospital in an ambulance.Half an hour later, he parked Starla in a lot and got out of the cab to stretch his legs.It was chilly, so, as soon as the driver finished stretching, he got back into Starla and kicked on the heater.Dominik closed his door, and the driver rolled down the passenger side window, allowing Dominik to lean in and say goodbye.I hope you are safe.This place has a way of chewing good men up and spitting them out, the driver said.The minister smiled and reached inside with his hand, revealing a black payment bracelet.The driver bumped his against it, and the fare was paid.Im just glad that you see me as a good man and not some fire and brimstone preacher, Dominik said.Yeah well...youre an exception to your kind.Plus...you helped me through a rough time and listened to my problems.That makes you a good person in my book.Ive never been a fan of religion.I think men are good or bad based on what they do.They shouldnt need a deity to make them good or bad, the driver said.I pray that youll meet more good people to change your mind about us, Dominik said.Dont hold your breath.I meet some real stinkers with his job...but there are some good perks, too, the driver said.You ever meet any girls?The drivers smile faded and his eyes widened.Oh shit!Ive been ignoring Karmen for days while I was attending the worlds biggest pity party!She may actually kill me, the driver muttered.Clicking the stereo display of Starla a few times to see what the local time was on Europa, the driver determined he could make it in time to pick her up from her shift if he sped a little.Godspeed, Dominik said, laughing.I gotta go, but seriously, Dominik, get out of here as quick as you can.Visit your friend, say your prayer, and call another cab to leave this devils trap, the driver said.Ill be fine.When I have God standing with me, who on this planet can be against me?Scary men that carry crowbars in their coats just to beat guys that annoy them, the driver said, slowly lifting off with Starla.Come see me sometime.Im the preacher at the  Only church on Mars, the driver said, interrupting the minister.Dominik smiled and stepped out of the window so the driver could go get his ass chewed out for ignoring his girlfriend all weekend.9: A Visit from Mother  As the driver sat on his black leather couch, he tried his best to convince Karmen to spend the weekend at his house.Itd been about a while since hed seen her due to their work schedules.Come on, babe.I havent seen you in a week, the driver said.Karmen asked, You really cant go a week without me?The driver raised an eyebrow.Its not that I cant...I just dont want to, the driver said.Karmen sighed and said, Let me think about it.Ill call you later.I have to get back to work.The driver couldnt figure out what was going on.Shed been this way for the past couple weeks, and he couldnt break through to her.In the six months since shed saved his life by getting him to a hospital when he was attacked by dehydrating parasites, hed become convinced he was falling in love with her.He looked over at Solstice, and she got up and walked over to him, sitting on the floor with her head in his lap.The driver sighed and started scratching behind her ears.I dont know...you girls are just hard to figure out.We havent had one fight since I spent an entire weekend avoiding her a couple months ago, and now I cant seem to get her to open up to me, the driver said, thinking about anything he could have possibly done to anger her recently.The more he sat there and thought, the less he came up with.He couldnt even come up with a crazy theory as to why shed be mad at him.He took every opportunity to see her and make her happy, while still giving her a respectable amount of space.Maybe I just need to ask her in person, the driver muttered.A knock at the door made Solstices ears perk up.She walked over calmly to the front of the home to see who it was when the driver opened the door.When the driver opened the door, an older woman stood before him.She was wearing the ugliest black dress with a purple floral pattern on it.She had short curly white hair with a little bit of brown still mixed in, trying and failing to retain some flavor of a day gone by.Yes?The woman looked taken back by the driver.When she didnt say anything, the driver got a look behind her and noticed a limousine.He thought, What the Hell is that thing doing there?This is going to sound forward, so, youll have to forgive me, the old lady said.Yes?Im your mother, the lady said.Now it was the drivers turn to be silent as he struggled to find his breath.He blinked several times looking the woman over.I know its going to be hard to believe, but I can prove it, she said.Another silent minute passed.The drivers mind whirled.He pictured every foster home hed ever been in.For some reason, Chris picture popped into his head.The driver had never been one to care about his past, but now it had knocked on his doorstep...allegedly.When his mind slowed a little, he asked, You have proof?She nodded and pulled up her white leather purse.I have a DNA testing machine inside.One prick of the finger will tell us all we need to know, the woman said.Come inside, and well see what your little machine says, the driver said, somewhat skeptical.She followed him inside and closed the door behind him.Solstice didnt know what to make of the older woman.She didnt come over to her, but she didnt growl at her, either.Oh, could you put that thing outside?I dont much care for animals, she said.Strike one.This is my house, and shes my best friend.You dont talk about Solstice like that, the driver said.The woman looked somewhat indignant of the drivers remark at first and then said, Suit yourself.She sat down on his couch, looking around the humble abode he called his dwelling.She looked at his black leather furniture out of the corner of her eye and frowned a little bit, as if he could do better.Shall we prick our fingers?Oh, yes, she said, pulling out a small metalic device with a five inch screen in the center.She pushed a button on the side, and it came to life.The woman pushed a few more keys on the touch screen, and two small needles came out of the box, one on each side.The driver hated needles, but he figured this would tell him what he needed to know about this woman claiming to be his mother.He walked over and pricked his left index finger on one of the needles.The woman pricked her right index finger on the remaining needle, and the machine began to compute.Within a few minutes, it was beeping, and she displayed the results.Well, thats a 98.6 percent genetic match, the driver said, reading the screen.You dont seem impressed, the woman said.What do you want me to say...Hell...what do I even call you?I suppose mother for starters, she said.The driver leaned against a wall in his living room and snarkily remarked, Mo  mother?Thats a name you earn, not one you get for sharing blood.She put the machine back in her purse and threw her arms in the air.I thought youd be a little more enthusiastic about meeting your long lost mother, she said.I wasnt exactly looking for you.I kind of got the hint that you didnt want me around when I turned six and learned what a foster home was, the driver said.Your crass tone is unwarranted.I didnt drop you off at an orphanage.Your grandfather did...the same man who gave you that stupid hat youre wearing, the woman said.Strike two.Unlike you, this hat has been with me my entire life.Its a part of me.Youd do well not to insult it, either.Listen to me.I came here today for a reason, she said.Okay.What was it?Did you want a hug?Did you want to make things right?I came here to offer you a better life, she said.That shut the driver up for a second.He was puzzled by her words.She hadnt exactly done much to warm up to him since her arrival.In truth, he had a nagging thought in the back of his mind that she wanted something from him.With a few more minutes, she got to explaining just what that thing she wanted was.Your name is Clarence Rider.My name is Shirley Rider, and youre the heir to Rider Corp., the leader in electron transport technology.Im here to bring you to your rightful place and turn your life around, she said.My name is not Clarence.It hasnt been since I was abandoned in a foster system.The woman sighed and put her hand to her face.Youre relentless, you know that?Listen lady, why dont we cut the crap and get down to brass tacks and nails?Im losing patience quick, and I figure youre about to hit strike three real soon, the driver said.Uh, I forget how rude you lower class types can be, she said.An angry growl disguised as a sigh on the part of the driver made the woman get back to the point of her visit.Very well.Im not here to kiss and make up.You hate me, and thats your right.I am here to take you back to Senora City on the moon and make you into the new president of Rider Corp.Your father passed away a few months ago, and I need to secure the companys future into the hands of another Rider.Unfortunately for me, youre the only one left, she said.Is that all?No.Part of securing the companys future will include you marrying the daughter of our nearest competitor.Well merge companies, youll wed this young lady who is the heir to her familys fortune, and everyone will  Get richer?Thatll be part of it, yes, but the bigger picture is both companies will have a sound future.Hold that thought for a moment, the driver said.He walked Solstice to the back door and let her out.She didnt put up much resistance, oddly enough.Then, the driver walked into his bathroom and felt around to the back of the toilet tank where he had a pack of cigarettes taped.Ripping it free, he walked back into the living room and lit one up.Oh, must you do that?Its such an ancient and filthy habit, the woman said, covering her nose.You dont really get to complain about things being ancient when you just announced your plans to put me into an arranged marriage, the driver said.Trust me, youll like her.Shes very beautiful and submissive.Shell make the perfect trophy wife, the woman said.I dont think my girlfriend would appreciate it if I suddenly got married, the driver said, inhaling and blowing smoke in the direction of his mother.Of course youll separate yourself from the bar trash youre currently dating in order to get ready for your new life.After that, youll dump that mutt somewhere, and youll come with me.Ill get you a new identity and backstory prepared, and well start the arrangements to groom you into a brand new president of a Fortune 100 company, Shirley said.I see youve done your homework.What happens after I dump her?You become rich and never have to drive that rusty piece of garbage in your driveway again, she said.The driver took one last drag off his cigarette and pulled it out of his mouth.He flicked it at his mother, and she gasped, throwing her hands up.Im sorry, did I break your train of thought?Oh?You were done talking?Good.Allow me to retort, the driver said.He sat down on his couch and lit another cigarette.Youve probably guessed what Im going to say, but, strike six.You get a strike for insulting my dog, my girlfriend, and two strikes for insulting Starla.That is the rusty piece of garbage in the driveway.Heres what is going to happen now.Youre going to take your wrinkled ass out of my house and put so much distance between the two of us that I cant even sense your evil presence anymore.Tell me this is some form of a tasteless joke.You heard me say youll be rich, right?Thats one of the first things I hate about you.You dont seem to care about people.You care about things...a company...wealth...things that dont mean anything to me.Get out of my house.She scowled, walked over to the driver, and shook her finger at him.Listen to me you ungrateful brat.You dont get a say in this matter because its bigger than you or me.Were talking about the future of two of the largest companies in existence, and Im not going to let my plans go awry because you want to be stubborn and thumb your nose at me.She stopped when her finger was inches from the drivers face and said, Ive arranged for your future wife to drop by.Im convinced shell be the deciding factor in your decision to come to your senses.I wasnt joking about you not having a say in the matter, she said.Almost as if on cue, another knock at the door came, and the drivers mother said, Come in, dear.Who the Hell does this bitch think she is?This is my house, the driver thought.The door opened slowly and in walked a girl who looked younger than the drivers career as a cab operator.Clarence, this is Octavia Swanfeld.She is the daughter of Richard Swanfeld, CEO of Electrafeld, the drivers mother said.Octavia was much shorter than Karmen, very prim and polished.She was wearing a white collared shirt with a small tight black vest over it.Instead of a dress like Shirley, she was wearing a knee length black pencil skirt.She had extremely long sleek black hair, and around her neck was a pink bow.Hello.My name is Octavia, she said, walking into the living room slowly, getting a better look at the driver.He searched her face for signs of disapproval like his mother had displayed, but she seemed oddly at ease.The lack of judgment on her part was surprising to the driver.Ill leave you two to get acquainted.Ill be gone for a couple hours, and when I get back, you two had better be in love or at least in a place where you can fake it, Shirley said, leaving.After the front door closed, and she was gone, the driver leaned back, causing his couch to groan a little.What a piece of work, he muttered.Octavia said nothing but looked at him.Shirley, not you, he said.I figured as much, she said.So..., the driver muttered, unsure of what to say to the woman expected to become his future wife.I take it she explained the situation to you, Octavia said.She did...with quite a lack of grace, I might add.I mean, I never really went looking with my parents.Im content with my life; why on Earth would I want to complicate it by tracking down the dirtbags that abandoned me as an infant?Shirley told me that she didnt abandon you, though.She said you were kidnapped and taken away from her, Octavia said.Strike one.You stuck up for that evil bag, the driver said.Sorry, Octavia muttered.Look...Octavia, was it?I dont know what she told you, but I have a girlfriend.Her name is Karmen, and I love her.Im not gonna trade what we have for any amount of money.Im a cab driver and have been for 25 years.I obviously dont care about the lack of cash in my bank account, the driver said.I dont think shes giving you a choice, Octavia said.What are you, some kind of robot?Theres always a choice.She doesnt get to just show up, says shes my mother, and then immediately boss me around.Thats a load of crap, the driver said.My parents arent exactly going to be pleased with an answer like that.They expect us to end up together and secure the future of their companies, Octavia said.Dont take this the wrong way, but I dont give a damn about your parents.I can count the number of people I care about on three fingers, Solstice, Karmen, and sometimes Chris, the driver said, finishing his second cigarette.He put it out in the sink and then tossed it in the garbage.Pulling out another cigarette, he leaned against the fridge.Cant you at least give me a chance?I dont even know you, the driver said.Well, Im right here.Ask me anything, Octavia said.Is that how you think this works?We play 20 questions, fall in love, and live happily ever?Octavia sighed and said, No, but weve got to work something out.Why is that, exactly?Because I care about what my parents think, and theyre riding on this deal, she said.You dont just get to come into someones life and have them fall in love with you because thats the plan.Do you know how I fell for Karmen?She found me when I was dying and saved my life by getting me to a hospital.Thats going to be pretty difficult to top, the driver said.He heard his earpiece buzzing, so, he excused himself and walked into his bedroom.Hey, Karmen said.Oh, hey.Man, you wont believe the day Ive had.Please tell me youre coming over tonight, he said.Karmen said she was, but she didnt sound like herself.Not giving it a second thought, the driver said, Great.Look, Im sorry to ask a question and run, but I kinda have something to deal with.Yeah, I gotta get back to work anyway.I just called to let you know Id be over tonight.
