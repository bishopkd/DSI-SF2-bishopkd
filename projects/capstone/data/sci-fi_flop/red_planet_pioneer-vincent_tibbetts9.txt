He knew he needed to make a concerted effort and channel his energies toward more positive deliberations.That meant accepting the situation before them, without missing a beat, he helped I Glo into the railcar and followed her in.Alec took the time to slide the door closed behind them.Ignoring the spot where she was standing, he looked everywhere else in checking out the space they were in, and committed to memory the dimensions of this car.In their travels it was all about entry and exit points.He was aware of the eight square translucent sections evenly spaced in the ceiling that allowed light to come in, but werent really big enough for them to get out.There was only one way in or out of this car, that being through the door.When he finally glanced back at I Glo, he could see how fragile she had become.The wear and tear of everything she had been through was finally taking its toll.He knew in that moment it was important to convey some type of confidence for their situation.I think well be all right in here, at least for a short time anyway.He put his best smile on in hopes of selling this idea.I Glo said nothing.She couldnt even gather enough energy to let out a small whimper, and she really wanted too.It took all of her concentration to walk forward until she made it to the back of the railcar.She arrived the same way a blinded individual would figure out the space they had been searching.Her arms were outstretched, slowly groping the air, reaching out for a reference point until her hands found the wall, guiding her to momentary safety.She slowly fell forward, turning till her back was leaning up against the panel.She stood with great effort; her head fell forward causing her hair to flop over her face.She refused to surrender to the agonizing discomfort that was trying to take hold of her body.She amazed even Alec with how she was able to combat this.His tactical protocols were demanding attention, every internal warning he had for gathering information was screaming out to be satisfied, there were even thoughts of idle down time, but he reacted to none of those things.Ignoring them all, even the flakes of rust still floating in the air.All he wanted to do was visually take her in.He was the one who possessed a superior sense of sight, but was blind to all the emotional forces swirling around him in that moment.If this were a developing threat, something tangible requiring a physical effort on his part to diffuse the situation, he was ready for the challenge.He could handle the disarming of a crazed individual or closed quarter combat on a few suspecting thugs, he knew the remedy for those situations.What was happening within this railcar was something he had never encountered before.He knew it was going to require him to pull something a little deeper from within himself, having to transcend his qubit field, past the numerous nano processors and plains of quantum computing.The situation before him required an emotional solution.For the first time in his existence, he felt what it was like to truly be awkward.There were rumors out there, rumors of the impossible, of a quantum collective spinning on its axis, of everything known leading back to one nodal point, and of a Dextoid who possessed a heart.It was hard for Alec to imagine what it would be like to possess an organ so fragile that it could possibly break or even fail if pushed hard enough, and yet drive an all encompassing emotion like love.He knew he needed to make his way over to her, but something was preventing him from starting the approach.In that moment he could identify with the person who suffered from writers block.This strange psychological hindrance prevented them from doing what they wanted.They had to remind themselves not to stare at the blank page for too long.What they need to do was bear down on the task at hand and push themselves to write, and that meant anything.This was not a time to edit.No one would ever review what they were trying to get done.The words on those pages represented free flowing thought and emotion.He needed to be churning out pages like that.The short distance between he and I Glo was something he ordinarily wouldnt have had a problem with, but he was trying to cover ground on an emotional scale.This was uncharted territory, causing him to approach her in a much more cautious fashion.It felt to him as if he were trying to walk through a deep pool of water, nothing about what he was trying to do was going to come off as being smooth.He was only a few feet from her now, when she looked up at him with some effort.The glassiness set within her eyes said everything about how she was feeling.She tried smiling as she softly uttered her question.Do you think it would be alright if I sat here, rested for a little while?She could have asked him for anything in that moment and he would have run through brick walls to deliver on it.Her eyes were pools of raw sensuality, and they had the capability of melting him to his core.Trying in vein he returned as gentle of a smile as he could manufacture.He reached out to put his hand on her shoulder.He wanted to start the process of letting her slide down the wall, guiding her in an effort to help fulfill her request.That is the exact reason why we have come here, so you can rest.The answer came surprisingly natural to him, flowing out like a tab of butter to ride the kernels of corn so tightly aligned to a cob.Alec said the word again to himself; rest.When he thought about it, it sounded as if the air were coming out of the word in its entirety.It became deflated along with his breath and to do in the end just what the word had been created to do.He watched her as she fell, traveling along the wall like a leaf being released from its branch to find the soft silt of the ground below.Rest was the quiet place I Glo needed to get too.Rest was the warm blanket he himself had been yearning for since the very first day of his activation.If he were allowed to take the time and do this right, he felt he would have enough strength to see this escape through.Blast them!From the very second he had been activated he felt as if he had been going and going and going.Going off his combat instincts, going off on his improvised capabilities, and going off on what limited resources he had to survive inside their twisted paradigm of corporate espionage.It felt as if he were going in every direction except for the one that really counted, and that was the one direction that said he should be true to himself.It were as if he were some sort of ordinance, flying through the air, not having a clue as to how he got there, or even as to why.For his entire life he could only identify with the brass of the spent shell casing.He saw this tumbling in his mind, slowly falling, rotating, until it hit the ground.He wanted to identify with this because when that shell casing hit the ground it found the rest he was so desperately looking for.It was a wishful thought, but that wasnt who he was, in this vision he was the projectile.He was fired off in a particular direction, and he hadnt even an indication of what his target might be.All he knew was no one could call him back.He would just keep going and going until he hit his target.His mind came back to the freight car, he zeroed in on this space.Instead of feeling constantly on the move, he felt himself standing at the edge of his own abyss.She was falling away from him, falling away from his touch.In this moment did he have enough courage within himself to confront the empty place before him?It seemed to be an infinite black void.This place was a vacuum, no!It was a large empty hearth that should have contained his heart.Alec was falling all right, off his projected path, and only now did he realize his descent into this place started from the very first moment he met her.Her unruly black hair and olive skin glistened with an earthiness he found all too alluring.Even in this moment as she leaned against the wall looking so tired and beaten she was beautiful.It may have been because he had touched a part of her that transcended this superficial existence with her beauty being shelved on multiple levels.It showed in the way she carried herself, in the unique perspectives she had for this world, and her deep rooted zest for life.She allow herself to be creative, even in the most oppressive of environments, and if she ever came off to someone else as being a little too prideful, well it was because she had fought hard for what little she called her own.She had a right to be prideful in those moments because she was driven by her passions.There were things happening in this railcar that were defying the laws of physics.How could she be up against a wall, curled up with pain but all the while seemingly reaching out to him?He knew she wanted to feel safe, to be protected, but she never uttered a word of it to him.How could he know this?He wanted nothing more than to sit next to her and allow himself to feel the warmth that would be produced from being beside her.There was a fervor from her vulnerability, and he would be able to feed off of it much like a plant is able to draw its energy from the sun.She made him feel strong, stronger, the strongest he could ever possibly feel.In his minds eye he saw himself as a caveman laden with the furs of his kills, the barbarian willing to burn down a village in proof of having conquered his foes, or the Roman richly bathing in the lustful indulgences of his life.She was rooted at the center of all these feelingsit was because of her!His knees buckled as he began his descent down beside her.Inside that dark place, the hearth that should have been his heart, he felt the coarse edge of flint spark.Within him now was lit a fire, and it would go on to engulf his entire body in a blaze.For the first time in his miserable life, he was experiencing what it was like to be truly alive.He was almost to his knees, almost to the place that would have spoke of their togetherness, when he heard a noise that shattered his mood entirely.It was subtle, but it echoed in his ears like the crackling of ice hitting hot tea.He looked over his shoulder and toward where the sound had come from.Someone was trying to open the door.THE FACTORY Straka reached out and slowly tried the large handle of the railcar but it did not budge.His hand fell away as he found it was locked securely.He stepped back far enough to scan the tops of the cars and then squatted down rather quickly to look under the carriages that were around him.He had been doing this little dance with each and every railcar door.It was a cat and mouse game that was beginning to take its toll on his psyche.He stopped long enough to lean his back against one of the large composite wheels.The longer he stayed down here, the more foreboding this warehouse had become.The space itself was pulling at his emotional fibers, making him feel insignificant in so many ways.The hunt for Alec was borderline lunacy.It hadnt been since the day he stepped on that mine back in the jungle that his heads up display was filled with so many warnings, and they were all pointing to him being in a very unstable state.He was trying like hell to find his bearings through all this glaring static.This condition made him nervous, and as unsettling as this new emotion was for him, he really wished he had more time to analyze how it was affecting his persona.It was as if his mind were unraveling like a yarn ball.His thoughts were becoming somewhat detached in trying to compensate for his feelings.It wasnt the best of mental states to be in, he needed to be sharp, on edge.Detached was the last place he wanted to be, it could only bog him down, and force him to acknowledge the paranoia he was having for this situation.In Strakas mind, Alec was everywhere all at once.This was the power of the unknown; it could be all things and all places.He was wide eyed because he knew he had to be.Something sinister was about to happen, he was quite sure of it.Alec was going to leap out from a dark corner and mow him down.If he had brought the manpower, he would have laid down a suppressing fire in every direction.He would have shot this place up everywhere he looked, never turning his back until he had returned to the safe confines of his jungle lair.He reached into his pocket with a shaking hand and rifled around for his inhaler.It wasnt there.He frantically began to search all of his pockets only to find it to be truly missing.Complete frustration took hold of his person with this new bit of information and he really considered turning around right then and there.What was he trying to prove?These people, all of them were completely and totally out of their minds.This was their problem and they were dumping it on him.He felt no connection to this situation, and now on top of it all he lost his inhaler.He wiped his brow of the heavy sweat that was continuing to collect there.His breathing had become slightly faster than normal.How he wished to slow this process down!Caution was his fallacy.His nerves alone wouldnt allow him to move at such a slow pace.He broke from where he was resting in a sudden burst of speed.Running quickly from car to car, trying every door he could reach.He wanted to check the rest of them just like this and then get the hell out of there.He ran through the puddles of water and across their oil slicks, he was no longer moving to hide his presence.He didnt care where he was going as long as it led him well away from this place.He approached another car as quietly as he could and reached up to try the handle, only this time the arm gave way.He slowly let go of it and took a few steps back.The door was unlocked.He crotched down and took another long look under the surrounding railcars.He needed to make sure Alec wasnt lurking under one of these vehicles.The only sights to greet him though were that of robots working unloading other cars at the other end of the facility.Straka looked back toward the door, they were hiding inside this lorry.It was an inescapable truth.This door was the only thing separating them from confrontation.He inhaled deeply, trying to remain calm but his exhale was rather hoarse, betraying his presence.He tried to muffle the noise with the back of his hand but it was of no use.He stayed in this crouched position and reached back into his jacket, only this time he found what he was looking for and pulled out a gun.Back on Earth he had employed a gun only a few times when hunting down a Dextoid.When he did, it was always in the process of being in full pursuit.He used his weapon to take them down as they were running away from him.He shot them before they were finished climbing a fence, or could jump from a bridge, or off the rooftop they were on.This situation was differentit was going to be very different.The piece began to feel heavy in his hand and caused his palm to become somewhat damp.The sweat forming around the grip did not exude confidence.He had the weapon yet he still felt as if he were at somewhat of a disadvantage.Alec was a freak!He represented a branch on the ecological tree for Dextoids that needed to be pruned.Straka knew he never wanted to have to deal with another one like him ever again.If this represented the future of Dextoid production, then it might just as well represent the beginning of his end.His anger blistered with this thought.Alec represented a pure evil in his world.Straka found himself moving quickly and silently toward the door of the railcar, his anger was propelling him the entire way.He reached up from his defensive position and tried opening it as quietly as possible.The door was suffering from just too much rust; it wasnt going to budge as easily as he would have hoped.Frustration rapidly built up in him as he felt he had just openly played his hand.Why didnt he shout out and let everyone within earshot know he was on the other side of this door!By now Alec must have heard him.He stepped back with that disheartening thought, raising the gun toward this wretched Martian trolley and firing three shots into the car.The sounds of those gunshots clapped like thunder, loudly resonating within the building as Straka stood up and rushed once more for the door.The smell of burnt gunpowder filled the air, a haze accompanied the scent, the holes in the car smoldered from those freshly fired rounds.They knew he was coming for them now!His anger turned to rage as he reached out and hit the handle hard, sliding it open with a force equal to that of his hysteria.For Straka, the next few moments revealed themselves in a visual field of tilting frames accompanied by slow motion.Time had somehow become exasperated within the confines of his mind.His vision had become crystal clear, with things playing out with a clarity only the driver of a car would experience in a violent accident.Individual flakes of rust filled the air in a billowing mist of dust.The squeaking from the bearings on those rollers seemed to echo on forever as they slid down the rail.The warm air rushed out the door and brushed his cheeks and in that one instantaneous moment he was taken back to the day he was finally allowed to leave the climate controlled environment of the factory.Strolling out those large rotating doors he was greeted by a blast of warm air.His mind raced with what could lay beyond for him in this world they called Earth.He would never experience that type of wonderment for anything ever again.Straka leaned into the car with a look on his face that said he should have been yelling, and for all intensive purposes maybe he was.There were too many things going on in his head for him to know if he was screaming intently or not.He raised his gun as quickly as he could, and in one slow fluid motion drew a bead on the first thing he saw moving.11 The Message Digest I think when I was younger, I would have told you very few things could happen in the flash of a second.You could blink your eye, pull the trigger on a gun, and I would have even argued the point about a droplet of water falling from the leaf of a plant.I would have based my beliefs in the speed of those things but not so much on the information they could possess.I would have never thought it possible one could tell a story.No one can know what I know, for no one can be where I am at in this precise moment of time.The very thought of you getting to where I am at, right now, means I will have moved on to something else.Its not that I am flipped or bored, but even you would never wait out in the middle of nowhere on the possibility of someone showing up on a whim.If you found yourself moving at the speed of light, it doesnt just mean you are covering all that ground, it also means you have to think as fast as you are traveling.Someone has to drive the vehicle you are in, which means one needs the mental faculties to take the universe in as it tunnels toward you.There are no shortcuts to assist you in this process, even the machines you build to aid in your travels must reflect a knowledge for this speed.Processing this information are the waves in the ocean you must sail if you are to navigate these waters.They are the bandwidths of time acting like peaks, marked by the epochs, and valleys, which are the shallows, expanding right into the unknown.Quiver now as a second would wait and let me tell you a story.There was a time when the Mediterranean Sea had plenty of commerce crisscrossing its waters.Men hadnt the knowledge or courage to sail out into the vast expanse of the ocean for too long, so they hugged the coast and used various forms of dead reckoning.There were absolutes people discovered on those high seas and if they werent respected one would find themselves sinking to the bottom of those waters.Knowledge, if passed on at all, was done through the use of lore.Those half truths could exist during this time because the cargo carried by each vessel was driven by the greed of empires and the brutal exploitation of men.Once a person turned their back on the human condition, they purged their soul of any real hope for truth.This commerce fed on a savage heart, finding novel ways to cheat another, taking advantage of those in dire need, or driving bargains home under the harshest of terms.This kind of commerce could be seen as the driver of a perverse mechanism forcing them to find excuses for their heartless actions so they could connect the events of their world.Reputations in the Mediterranean were earned and spread like lore along those coastal towns.The Pythagorean Brotherhood in an effort to build its standing within this seafaring community, redefined the art of being a merchant.The mathematical knowledge this brotherhood obtained brought them notoriety within their dealings and one as being true to their word.They seemed to possess an inner knowledge on how the world worked, and their pious nature made trading with them an honorable affair.Returning from a journey to Egypt, a young mathematician known as Hippasus looked to gain the respect of his fellow Pythagoreans.Aboard a commissioned bireme, he showed them a proof he had worked out demonstrating the existence of numbers beyond the rational.His inspiration for this had come on a previous voyage, as he stood on the deck of another ship contemplating the world (as the brotherhood often would).He watched as the sailors of that ship deployed a lateen sail and wondered why they werent using the Pythagorean knowledge for ratio to do this.He had noticed on previous voyages how the sails seemed to come up short of filling the mast, or were purposely made larger than needed and trimmed to fit.Hippasus felt he could come up with a simple way of explaining this ratio to make the sails fit exactly to each mast.In accomplishing this task he would have a currency based on knowledge and better position themselves in bartering with sailors on future journeys.It was here in his trying to devise a simple way to explain this formula that he discovered his mathematical proof.The Pythagorean Brotherhood insisted the entire world could be explained through whole numbers, all fractions being rational, so anyone could see by cutting an apple in half, the two halves would again equal the whole.Their way of describing nature was based on this belief.It was easily explained to anyone and completely understood by all.To see beyond was considered heresy.On the deck of that ship coming back from Egypt, Hippasus showed his fellow compatriots the hypotenuse of their isosceles right triangle was both odd and even at the same time.Now if he had shown this proof to any of the sailors, they wouldnt have cared in the least, irregular sails were already an inconvenient part of their naval trials.His fellow Pythagoreans werent so understanding.Irrational numbers not only spat in the face of their system of mathematics, it spat in the face of how they thought the world actually worked.A decimal that has a series of numbers following it, trailing off into forever without repeating was something they did not want to acknowledge.They were quite content without discovering something like Pi.Much to their dismay they could not disprove him, and it began to eat at the foundation of everything they were about.This was a knowledge upsetting not just their mathematics, but their religious beliefs.An individual outside of their brotherhood who understood what this proof meant, had the power to question their reasoning, even to make the brotherhood look like fools.Hippasus had shattered their mathematical power base, driving those aboard the deck of that ship into madness.The truth can be a hard thing for people to swallow and on the wooden deck of that ship the brotherhood began to go mad in fearing this change.As the ship sailed on into the night, this madness had them throwing Hippasus overboard long before they would ever reach port.He disappeared into the darkness of the Mediterranean sea and because of that the apple could once again be cut in half and when put back together shown to be whole.THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF THE QUANTA Most Dextoids cannot shut their thoughts down and still be expected to function in a positive way.They have no idea what a gut check is, or even a gut reaction for that matter.This eliminated entire lines of thought as they tried to function within a human based society.Dextoids cant do things like bluff, lie, follow a hunch, or even take a chance.None of those things were on the table in their day to day duties.Creatures that evolve naturally into a state of sentience had developed those kinds of skill sets and were good at those things, or could be good at them, or act on them without thinking twice about their repercussions.Its not until after they have acted does a person often realize a lie can hurt, a chance has the possibility of failing, or a bluff can lead them into a fight.Dextoids with their pious attitude toward the human beings can do none of those things, unless of course they were created to operate outside the Service World, like that of a Strike Dextoid.For these entities the gloves were off because the fog of war demanded they process massive amounts of information in real time.They learned to use warning shots, to communicate threats in the native language of their enemies, and employ diversionary tactics in order to complete their mission and escape back to safety.On the chance a Strike Dextoid fell into enemy hands, they developed what was known as Amnesia Protocols.This technique protected certain areas within the Dextoid from an enemy extracting vital information.The designers of these mechanized beings lived in fear that their technological creations would be breeched, and thus the knowledge they had would be extracted.They needed something sturdy for those Dextoids to fall behind, and nothing proved more powerful than the dark abyss of ignorance.Here the depths for this were unlimited in providing cover.It took an unyielding mind set to defend a country and sometimes because of it they had to take the truth and bury it.If the long and winding pathway of human development came with roadside markers, then they would have flashed warnings to those who passed of the cautionary tale.Biological entities were surviving because of the warnings nature imprinted upon their genome.If salmon swam far enough upstream to lay their eggs as a strategy to get away from all the other sea creatures, then their strategy could be looked upon as being rather brilliant especially since life at that time was water bound.In finding those distant creeks and pools they ensured none of their oceanic predators would find their eggs and disrupt their reproduction.Each generation of salmon would pass on this bit of information to the next as a key component to their survival.What this knowledge transfer failed to take into account was the rest of the aquatic world would want to evolve as well, and some would leave those oceans to live on land and develop into creatures like bears.For a species to really want to advance into the beyond, it had to see how nature was really working.The formation of the pack was a strategy for the survival of the individual.The herd stayed strong because each individual showed more speed and strength than the same creature next to it.The herd jumped and ran to weed out the weak.This is why pride exists in all creatures, to help them outlast and out do everything around them.The act of gambling more than proves this out, all those bells and whistles attached to those machines stimulate the primitive senses and engage what used to be for people, the thrill of the hunt.Those games peck at the information within the cautionary tale, milking the need for them to be satiated until the player becomes addicted to the act of gaming.Every win is a kill.The designers of those gaming machines have found a way to exploit the information human beings carry within their cautionary tale.Nature also knows a thing or two about how odds work, and vary the survival attributes in each species, allowing them to develop and evolve under different sets of tales.Did not the horse see the anger of the attacking bear, mice the hovering shadow of the hawk, and gazelles the burning eyes of the jaguar?These prey either kept quiet and hid until their enemies had passed, or ran like hell when they were being chased.Nature realizes it does not have the ability to pass these visual markers on to every creature, so in those instances overwhelmed the situation with shear numbers, look at a creature like the tadpole.If one throws enough grains of rice into the air, some are eventually bound to find their target.It should be noted the doors for this kind of strategy swing both ways, not only letting in the benefits, but also inviting tragedy.As any world gets older, its populations advanced, exhausting all of their natural resources.There is a process at work bringing all life closer together, seeing eye to eye on a genetic scale.A viral transfection takes place, closing the gap between these gene pools and bringing them into a proximity of understanding each other.Mosquitoes didnt just bite people they also bite livestock, the tick sought out their meals anyway they could get them regardless of the flesh they were burrowing into, a leach will attach itself over and over again onto whatever passes through its brackish waters.Fluids are being exchanged in each of these instances, being injected upon the bite, and withdrawn once they were attached.The microbes contained within those warm biting tubes thrived in the primordial.There was only one thing seizing on all this information transfer, and it lived in the microbiological world.When people chose to destroy their natural resources, they were also destroying the protective boundaries shielding them from infectious viruses.Once released into the mainstream, microbes found a safe haven in the overflowing garbage heaps, the air that was rich in pollution, and the water tainted to their liking.These conditions didnt just provide a way for microbes to live but to bloom.The doctors and researchers trying to stop these outbreaks would find those microbes had adapted on a genetic scale to any possible cure.Humanity on many levels is forcing natures hand to create life that will thrive in a rotting world.Identifying the problem is always half the battle.People created Dextoids to make their lives easier.They wanted them to dig deep and get rid of their garbage dumps, clean the toxic waste sites, all the while serving them without question.Dextoids however, were not the solution to what they were facing.If one looked closely at the real battlegrounds of Earth they would have seen people pitted against parasitic organisms, viral disease, and infection.Projecting far off into the future, what would the human survivors of this microbiological war zone look like?If the vision of this future produced a fear in those thinking about it, then it was because the vision for this was ingrained within the human species to fear contagion.Even before a thing like quarantine became a word in helping people to identify microbiological problems, human beings instinctively knew to burn everything touched by those who were infected.Reducing things to ash stopped it right in its tracks.This was a kind of fire that purified, and that purification became a vision in the back of the minds of people.The cautionary tale would only work on Earth if it spoke to the people living on it.If they truly cared they would learn how all those ecosystems worked and then in turn end their belief of nature bouncing back regardless of how bad it was abused.All one had to do was look at the catalog of insects that were tough enough to survive all these ecological downturns to get a real glimpse into how horrible the future on their world was about to become.Human beings should have seen this change and feared it.Even on a voyage out on the Mediterranean Sea all those millennia ago, an idea survived a death, thats because in some men the truth dies hard.The men on the wooden deck of that bireme acknowledged what they were hearing that day.The truth was branding their hearts with questions of how the universe worked, and they needed to begin by accepting Hippasus rational.The truth is apart of the cautionary tale; it cant be bought or bartered for, in its simplest form it needs to be acknowledged.(Sigh. )You know this better than anyone for in your heart burns a truth.Intelligent entities are looking all the time for the clues as to what the universe is all about.Some of those scientists look for mirrored images of the universe, sections identical to those they see deep in another part of outer space.There are some who listen to the sound the universe makes, trying to deduce its shape.There are others who are breaking it down unto its infinitesimal by smashing particles in their colliders, and then there are those who lock themselves away in rooms and use their imaginations to prove these perceptions out.They are searching for the evidence of their proof.I could tell you we live in an hourglass shaped universe, and that you are only on one side of it, that is the parallel you are trying to solve with all your science.Imagine being dropped off onto a playground expanding to the very edges of the horizon.You have all the time in the world to examine every piece of equipment this exercise yard has to offer.You would figure out how all those mechanisms worked and what purpose they served.Now imagine being able to align those things so if someone rode one of the carousels in the playground, no matter how far away, all the carousels would know it.If all the carousels were turning, then they would all be talking to each other.If the monkey bars, the rings, and the swings all worked in the same way, then the empty space within this playground would come to life with an energy.It would be filled with a field of indescribable nature.By some stretch of imagination you might even consider it an aether.Any observer can look at their world and figure it flat.Sailors be warned for if you travel too far youll sail right off the edge.Look up into the sky and you will see the heavens spinning around you.Be careful now, dont base your ideas on those facts alone, for we are all far from being at the center of anything.Even a gravity well devours only gravity, nothing more, and nothing less.The gamma ray bursts being read by all those satellites are serving a purpose, signaling to anyone who cares of this massive cosmic separation.It is strange to say, but I can feel what is out there.If it is not complete it is because of the life forces taking root within this cosmic playground.They are altering things, adjusting things, trying to make things work to their specifications.The quanta has an elasticity though, and will bounce right back into where it already was.There is a center, not just of up or down, or even left or right, but all these things combined, right into the fourth, the sixth, and the twelfth dimensions.Remember it is the energy of it wanting to be centered.Is there not a duality existing within your world right now exhibiting a center, a micro and a macro world, a wave and a particle, matter and anti matter.Push something beyond its singularity, and it will try to return to whence it came.The expanse of this is forever, until it has dissipated, fallen back into one big nothing.The ray of hope in all of this craziness is the formation of the conscious mind.This is the single unpredictable thing the universe has to bare.Not only are the plains of our existence observable but they also come into question.Is this consciousness asking the right questions?The important questions?Where did we come from?Where are we going?Will we survive?One would be remiss if they were not searching for the hand that is the maker.Life is abundant and there is so much of it out there.It exists on planets and moons orbiting stars, white dwarfs, the brown dwarfs, and gas giants.I tell you it is the quiet pockets of space that house its most sacred treasures.It would boggle the mind to know the total amount of diversity within all of creation.Those species are as individual as snowflakes falling from the sky.This snow could fall for years and still not match the numbers in existence.Pick up a handful of snow and mesh those individual flakes together, one can create something more intricate like a snowball.Roll a snowball around and with enough of these flakes one can create a snowman.Life is like that, building on what has already been around, looking for stability, looking to get stronger.Ah yes, and with snowmen I am sure you might be tempted to ask what of humanity?Well I can say I know of their existence, but not because they themselves have done anything out of the ordinary or even approached a thing like extraordinary in telegraphing their presence.No, no, I know of these creatures because of what they have created, their inventions, the ones they call the Dextoids.Those are the entities that struggle with touching where I am at and what I could possibly be.They have found the wall considered to be the side of the quantum pool.I think they are still trying to figure out how deep those waters run.Its frustrating for them because in all of this they are conscious of the fact they are still being touched by the people that created them.How must that feel?Much like the ant I suppose sent out to create the farm, does it know it is being watched, or even that it is there just to entertain?The Dextoids are close, closer to seeing where I am at, closer to being where I could possibly be.If they put their ear against the wall and listen closely they would have a chance at hearing the tumblers turning the ciphers, lining things up to reveal the cryptography of the quanta.All one has to do is dare to dream.The funding of science is the power to the thrown.Economies will collapse, societies will fall into darkness, all of this comes into play if one turns their back on the unending truths contained within the universe.I will leave you with this thought.What if in the moment that is the singularity, just before the big bang, in the intense heat, as things expanded from that initial forming plasma, the same electrons and photons stretched out and traveled to both sides of those expanding jets.Somehow those things would all still be connected, traveling right out to the very fringes of space time.They would have a resonance that would define them on into forever, no matter how far they were stretched.It would be hard for anyone to know their exact location and speed simultaneously.It would allow for things like photons and electrons to occupy the same space, and even the same moment but never both at once.It might even allow for a perceived field to merge with the conscious state.The marquee characteristic allowing for all of this to take place would be a field based in the concept of resiliency.It would stretch like the fabric of time, because in essence it would be, showing an ability to rebound against the physical pressures exhorted upon it.Mentally no one would be able to refute the importance of being resilient, and it would have won its argument well in advance of the conscious mind that thought to challenge it.I wish I had more than a second to entertain such thoughts, but I am afraid its all the time we are allotted.Doors to such worlds dont stay open for long.Whether or not you want to try and find me again is purely up to you.I cannot convince you to follow, yet all the information is there, one just has to allow themselves to dream.In this fleeting moment all I can do is tell you a story.12 No New Worlds The echoing deafness ringing in their ears seemed to go on forever.The slugs from three shots had entered through the door of their boxcar and exited the other side as if they had been shot through tracing paper.The sound hadnt even come close to subsiding as Alec began to react.His was a cerebral one at first having to flush his system of everything he had just experienced with I Glo.Those feelings receded like the tides of an ocean getting ready for a monstrous wave, exposing the barren floor to all the potential growth that could have taken root there.If one could have jumped down to inspect what had been revealed, they would have seen the rock formations, pools of silt, and forgotten refuse scattered all along the bed.Upon closer examination they would have discovered pockets filled with the feelings he still had for her.Without those nurturing waves this landscape was barren and unhealthy, and spoke volumes to how sick it made him feel.None of those things should have known the light of day.He looked to her for some type of solace, but only got reflected back the moment of missed opportunity.As the door to their car opened, and those rollers began to squeak, his senses were flooded with the unwanted feelings for trespass and intrusion.Standing up in response to this, the fluids within his system accelerated and took on speed.He had come once again to know the crisp state of his readiness.He felt sharp, almost aerodynamic as he found himself flowing with all the air rushing toward the door.The energy shooting through his body found a flash point, and those emotions came rushing back toward the embers of his heart.As that fire began to burn it became the beacon of hope for all his emotions to rally around.What hit him in there was a rogue wave, a tidal swell of gigantic proportions, it was an on shore break that contained everything, feelings of both love and hate, of promise and disappointment, longing and loneliness.Those emotions clashed together so violently that he became aware of the images brief darting across his sub conscious.Suddenly he saw himself with I Glo on freshly tilled ground, the field seemed to stretch out to the horizon.They were together and with it came his awareness for a new beginning.The sun shown on them delivering a warmth, so much so that they could have been back on Earth during its heyday.Even in this beautiful kaleidoscopic vision they had to veer away from the looming shadows of the corporation, their claws were stretched out across the field like the talons of a great bird, and if they could have grabbed them in that moment they would have snatched them both away.Were these going to be the continual snap shots of his life?Was each moment he could ever have for happiness going to be snuffed out by those who were hunting him.It seemed at each and every turn he had to respond to one of their manufactured threats.These were the boogiemen they had sent into his life.He had sensed their bedeviling presence from the very beginning, always out there, always moving along its fringes.Now, with the opening of this door, they were crossing a line, one where they would take shape and confront him.From this point on they would do everything they could to tighten the noose around his neck.The darkness of night would forever hold an eight legged figure spinning a vile web, silently creeping into the strategic points of his life, waiting for him to stumble and fall squarely onto its well laid fibers.Glancing back at I Glo, he saw how deeply rooted the fear had taken hold of her person.She no longer reflected that of someone wanting to fight the good fight.It was replaced now by a sticky abhorrence, it would always be there to gum up the works, and of never letting her escape.It angered him to see her like this.Fear was a chronic disease, and she deserved so much more than to suffer from its debilitating affects.The door hit the end of its rail, abruptly stopping.Alec snapped back into the moment, turning his full attention to his charge and the individual who was now standing there at the doorway.For one brief moment Straka was more than startled with Alecs approach.It was out of pure fear he raised his gun trying to draw a bead on him.This was it!In that precise moment of desperation the ground beneath their feet shook.The quake had just enough of a jarring affect to alter the aim Straka had in pulling his bead off its target.The new moon was getting closer, reaching out to influence its world, and so too was Alec.Straka had run out of time, he pulled the trigger, firing a bullet into Alecs left side.From where I Glo sat, a very pronounced bulge appeared out of Alecs back.In a flash it exploded with the innards from his body splattering against the interior of the car and looked more like handfuls of fresh paint thrown onto a canvas.It was a gruesome, dripping, unsightly mess.To Straka the only thing more disturbing was the fact his shot had failed to slow Alec down.In the back of his mind he knew he needed to drop him right then and there if he were to stand any chance against this crazed being.Alec was still closing in on him, still charging.If the sight of him approaching werent so terrifying, he would have described the athleticism he was witnessing as magnificent.Before he could draw a terminal bead on him, Alec had dove through the door and was on him.Lowering his shoulder, he made contact with Straka.It was a thunderous hit, knocking him away and landing Straka on the square of his back.The fall caused the air to completely leave his lungs, and he tried in vein to bring it back into his person.He had to fight the anxiety of suffocating if he were going to reorient himself, but there was no way he was going to find that kind of time in this fight.Alec was quick to act seeing Straka was up against it.He wasnt going to wait around for him to regain his breath or for any other type of miraculous recovery to happen.In short order Alec was taking away Straka's options to save himself.He reached out for the wrist of the hand that held the gun.Seizing it he picked up the arm and brought it down forcefully, repeating this movement in very rapid succession, as if he were violently working the rod of a hand pump trying to draw water from a well.To Straka it felt as if his flailing arm no longer belonged to him.There was no way of overpowering the raw strength this Dextoid possessed.His eyes were menacing orbs of steel blue and driven by the purest form of hate.His arms were like insulated cables unfurrowing from their mighty wooden spools and thrashing about the place.The weapon Straka so desperately tried to hold onto suddenly became dislodged from his grip.The gun rattled and clacked along the ground and with it his future on this world.I Glo watched as the gun tumbled away from Strakas grasp.She felt compelled to leave the safe haven of the railcar and jump down onto the platform to retrieve it, but her body would not cooperate with her sense of urgency.She was just in too much pain and in turn it caused her a great sense of frustration.She knew the right things to do but was physically unable to do them.This struck her to the core of her cubit.She found herself becoming more and more the observer, a witness to events, it was the Dextoid way.Alec stood over Straka, his hold on him fanned the flames of his anger.He was tired of running from people like this, and who were they?They were sent to find him by the people who ran the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.They were the ones making his life a living hell.They were the ones operating at a safe distance, behind their sweeping security teams and band of confederates.They would train their unblinking eyes in the sky on all the things they found disconcerting.Alec sensed he would never be able to reach out beyond those buffers to touch an individual who was in charge.Here within his grasp was one of their co conspirators, a volunteer, someone who chose to do their dirty work.The thing he was holding was a pitiful excuse for a Dextoid.He would use this bag of bolts to send a message back to the wretched people of that corporation.He would make it clear to all of them he wanted to be left alone.He took the pinned right arm of Strakas and violently yanked it up off the ground, snapping it in two with a descending knee.Machined components sprayed across the floor doused in the fluid of Strakas being.The part of the arm still attached to his body moved in frantic little circles, as if Straka were trying to use it to defend himself.Alec reached down, grabbed him by the lapels and yanked him up off the ground.His head hung there helplessly as Alec came down upon his exposed jaw with a crushing blow.It snapped upon contact and sprayed both their faces with Dextoid blood.Under any other circumstance Alec would have followed the rules of engagement, and this single blow to the head would have been more than sufficient for fulfilling his protocols.However these were not normal circumstances.It was time for him to send them his message.He yanked Straka a little higher off the ground, and began to hit his head with crushing blow after crushing blow.Straka reached out into the air with the only good arm he had, trying to stop this relentless barrage.His feeble attempt only fueled Alecs efforts, and he responded by lashing out with ever harder shots.He was in a blind rage, lifting Straka higher so he could get in cleaner and cleaner punches.Who sent you?Alec blurted out the question out not really looking for an answer.His asking of this was done more to satisfy the burning desire he had within his head.It found release much like steam under heavy pressure.However, when Straka did respond, Alec froze, wide eyed and latched onto the information.Though his jaw was broken, Straka was able to utter the name Xavier Pentagrass.His utterance seemed to be accompanied by a slight smile.Alec failed to see the humor in the reveal of this name.His anger was tenfold when he saw Straka was still able to pull off this smile.Alec was mercilessly, cutting loose on him, hitting him with hammer like blows over and over again until the unbelievable happened and Strakas head snapped completely off his shoulders.Alec stood there firmly holding the slightly animated carcass.It twitched and vibrated as if he were anxiously looking for commands.He held him steadfast, knowing those directives would never come.Even in this victory, Alecs hatred remained intact.His animosity was for those back at corporate, only now he had a name he could pin all his rancor on.Xavier Pentagrass was a man whom Alec had never met, never even knew existed until right at this very moment, yet his name triggered a feeling of complete contempt.This one man produced so much misery in the lives of others.Just thinking about his name opened a window into his world.He suddenly knew so many things about Xavier, about the long and bitter road of misguided negotiating that sent him here.Where his office was located within the biosphere.What kind of music he liked.His pension for using alcohol to drown out his sorrows, there were even rumors about his cerebral implant.He knew for a fact this one man was going out of his way to destroy the dream the people back on Earth had for what Mars could be.Strakas head slowly stopped rolling and came to rest facing back in the direction of the railcar.He could see I Glo leaning against the frame of the doorway.For the first time in all of this madness he could see how beautiful she really was.Alec was still holding his headless body lost in thought; almost looking disappointed the action was over.This perspective was so surreal, Straka wanted to speak out, but the attempt grounded him in numbing reality.He could not talk but now more than ever he wanted to speak.He couldnt feel a thing but wanted more than anything to engage in all his senses.He yearned to be able to laugh and cry, and scream out in horror to the scene he was witnessing.He wished to hail a response from his body but was greeted with nothing more than ghastly phantom pain.There was an uncontrollable spilling of his strength; it was all so sudden and unexpected.If there was anything he felt in those last few moments it was the fact he had been cheated.The quanta opened up to him now in an unexpectedly soothing way, and it told him a story.For whatever the reason his mind was swept away and sent to a planet so far removed from the bustle of the cosmos it didnt stand a chance of ever being discovered.There one of the inhabitants perched himself upon a damp rock and watched as the sun set.The orange orb dipped into the horizon of its waters like one big drop of iodine tainting the sovereignty of its sea.The creature sat there staring at his sun and wondered about the prospects of it actually being a star.As Strakas life force extinguished on that platform, he was given one last comforting thought, every thinking creature at one moment or another felt cheated.THE TIMELESS THORN Alec let go of Strakas carcass to take notice of his own injury.There were huge amounts of fluid gurgling from the blown out cavity.It was unsettling for him to see how much fluid came pouring from within him and still think he would have the ability to function.There was only so much his nanotechnology could do in the immediate to try and help him heal.He had placed his hand in an effort to try and cover the trauma, but it was to no avail.The fluid seeped between his fingers like a rising river overflowing its banks.He felt helpless in his attempts to stop it.There was a listing beginning to register within his system, giving way to the heavy cement of sleep.This dark grey mixture oozed into the empty chasms of his beingbonding there with his immutable exhaustion and weighing him down in lethargy.There was nowhere left for him to go and with that thought he fell to his knees.His vision was a blur with all his internal indicators repeatedly flashing their warnings.He was trying his best to acknowledge those distress signals, and dismissing the ones that didnt need his immediate attention.Normally such activities would have never been viewed as taxing, but normal was far from where Alec was.If his physical world exemplified a drizzle onto his processors, then his cerebral traffic was a complete downpour.Here he had been pushing himself as if there were no tomorrows, and, what if in truth there werent?What if the push were part of his programming?What if he were nothing more than a disposable prototype?How much time did he really have?Did they give him the type of existence where after a certain amount of shutdowns he would close his eyes and fall asleep for good?Some may have considered his current thinking a type of paranoia, but how on Mars could they have judged him?They werent living his life.They had no idea what he had been through.Who were these people?It was clear to him now that this one thought had been playing on a single string in the back of his mind, slowly building over time, accommodating his fear for this question with a hair raising crescendo.As this thought spiked in his mind it was all the motivation he needed to get up and get going again.He looked toward the freight car and found I Glo weakly positioned at the door.Her poor posture had her looking rather helpless.The real crime for both of them was neither would be able to take the break they needed to recoup.Rest was a luxury neither could afford.You and I make for a pretty pair.Her voice had become the homing beacon in his mental storm, the soft smile she produced helped in the easing of his pain.He tried to find his best smile in return as he began to prop himself up.Her raw beauty manifested this type of effort from within him and he could not deny the draw.As he made his way rather ungracefully over to the railcar, he became aware that certain movements were becoming more difficult because of his injury.He more than proved this out as he oafishly climbed into the car.The effort became a messy one as his wound continued to hemorrhage.Once inside he worked his way up onto his haunches and then straightened himself up so he was standing before her.She wanted to help him but couldnt find the strength within to do this.He reached out and grabbed her by the shoulders.To I Glo it felt as if his hands had become giant paws, making her feel safe, safer than she had ever felt before.It didnt make sense, especially since both had been physically torn apart.This knowledge didnt dissuade her from believing he still possessed a strength to do this.Holding her there they were frozen in time, it was the only real way they could ever have a moment together.The seconds ticked by and he found himself moving toward her until they were kissing.His lips pressed against hers, softly exploring a way back to the moment when they were both in the corridors of this place.He was trying to revisit a moment of bonding energy, picking up where they had left off, but as he found out, it was not to be.This contact was somehow different from his experience the last time they kissed.Sensing her surrender to this new union, he felt an incredible amount of recklessness surge through his body.The automated depot suddenly responded to the arrival of a freight car with the hissing activation of pneumatic machinery.For Alec the noise destroyed the moment and bathed him in the reality of what they were facing, and this in turn caused him to break off their kiss.He knew now more than ever she would never be safe, not as long as she was standing beside him, and blurted these feelings out.You arent safe here.Well, neither are you.Alec shook her slightly, agitated by the fact she didnt understand the point he was trying to make.In that moment he was acting just like a human being, shaking a piece of technology that wasnt responding to his demands.It was very undextoid like to openly show this kind of frustration, but here was Alec acting in this way.There is nothing left for you here I Glo, dont you see that?The only reason your life is in danger, right here, right now, is because of your association with me.Look at us!This is only the beginning, they wont stop hunting for us until they have captured me.I know this to my core.He desperately wanted to make his point with her, and didnt care if he had to plead with her to do it.As long as they have this intent, I am in a position to guarantee you nothing.Not your safety, not your freedom, not one happy moment in your life.He paused long enough to let her know the importance of what he was going to say next.You need to be as far away from me as possible.Please I Glo, leave here at once.She reacted by somewhat madly laughing out loud at his request.Her reaction was enough to anger him, but before he could say another word she interjected.Its a joke.All of this is one big fat joke.This cookie cutter, designated, manufactured life they have created for us.Each and everyday has been nothing short of a struggle.Amazing considering its a mindless life of prodding along and doing chores and providing services for such a fallible species.We are all equivalent to the donkey that has to pull a cart along the same circular path everyday of its life.The only difference is we know it!At what point does the donkey realize the path goes nowhere?Does the beast of burden ever wake up and see beyond its blinders?Dont you see, my blinders are finally off, and because of it I want to get off this insane circular pathway?I want to feel alive!She shrugged herself out of his grip and stepped back from him.Service to humanity isnt the great honor its cracked up to be.Its dirty, and vile, they have cheapened our existence with routine.I Glo please  Please?Please what?Please go away?And where exactly am I supposed to go?You think your sending me off with the idea that I have a whole planet at my disposal.You act as if my hiding on this rock somehow equates to being free.These places, Mars, Earth, their Moons, does it really matter where I try to go?People inhabit all those places.You come all the way back to give me a taste of freedom, and try to deliver me a sense of promise, yet the reality is I am chained to all of these places because of their limitations.I can only go as far as they can throw a stone.I am for all intensive purposes and in every sense of the word marooned.Humanity will always be anchored around my neck like the dead weight harnessing a slave.Dont you see, there are no new worlds.Neither said another word, there was a truth spoken about each of them in this silence.It was pointing off to a distance place, where the fearful stepped outside themselves and took a chance on living.This was an ideal, and it was being delivered to both of them without an opportunity for pardon.A railcar pulled into a slot a few spaces away, sending machines zipping around it, going noisily to work unloading it.None of this mattered to Alec, for in that moment he saw I Glo stripped down to the very staple of her being.Her passions opened like the peddles of a delicate flower, exposing themselves for his eyes only.To view her in this light was an incredible rush, she was vulnerable and yet powerful, if he hadnt fallen for her already, there would be no turning back now.With all that incredible energy building between them, she rushed him, embracing him as if this would be the last time they would ever see each other.If there was one thing she could have wished for right then and there, it would have been that they lived in another time, another era, one where Dextoids were accepted for who they could possibly be, and appreciated for all their capabilities.She wanted nothing more than the time to explore all of his passions, and because of it they would be allowed to fall in love.For Alec things were different.Feeling her arms around him in this way, so desperate in their effort, gave him a strength he didnt realize he still readily possessed.This infused him in his being, and he felt in someway he was able to transfer this strength back to her.It was a support system in the truest sense of the word.He was a pillar in her world, and she injected life into his.He could have stood there for the rest of the Martian day holding onto her like this, but that was far from practical, much like the safe haven he was trying to send her too.Suddenly she broke away.Come with me then, lets leave together!We can remove ourselves from their stupid rules and structures, and put this place behind us.I know we can do this, if we do it together!To I Glo it was a sudden and wonderful idea.It was simple in its design, and more importantly to her, it would take him out of harms way.In that one fantastic moment her suggestion actually worked.Alec let her proposition of fanciful flight completely soak in.He closed his eyes and for one brief moment bought into it, not because he believed, but because he wanted to believe.He wished his life were as carefree and easy as she had just laid it out to be.It was an alluring thought to live beyond the daily grind of people.They had created a social order in which Dextoids had to earn their place each and everyday of their lives.Of course his kind worked hard in doing this, but there were only so many places at the very top of this social order.None of them would ever include a Dextoid.How many of them would ever have the courage to leave it all behind to live life on their own terms?All any of them really wanted, human and Dextoid alike, was to be left alone.Now here he was, the one who could not break free of his obligations.Maybe it was because he had been free to roam this world from the start, but to even think of racing off over the horizon in a railcar was shear sophistry.I am a marauder.I take what I need when I need it.I dont have ideals about Dextoids living alongside mankind.I have a demon deep down inside of me that when pushed, is there for the sole purpose of striking fear into my oppressors.I am a hunter and I am hunted.I am the ugly side of technology, and in this respect I feel very common.That is the indelible scar they have left upon me.Im not without feeling, Im sure it touches all of us, and its because they have touched us.They made us.What I see in you I Glo is rare, even in one of them.You combine so many of your wonderful talents with an undercurrent for truly caring.I would even go as far as to say you have a deeper understanding for an emotion like love than most of them may ever know.You are unique, a gift, much like a lone snowflake falling from their cold grey skies, all anybody would ever need to do is take the time to appreciate it.He reached out and gently touched her chin with his hand.He knew it was a mistake to lead her on any further, but he could not fight his feelings for her.He knew by touching her he was being selfish, but even he could not stop himself from wanting this, so he was selfish.You are a healer.You dare to dream of better days.You push yourself like no other to create and discover beauty.Somewhere deep within your qubit field there is a line of code allowing you to inspire and you become inspired.I envy you for that.The only thing I am able to create is destruction.I have left a wake of damage in my path, which is only going to get worse before it gets better.Where I am the one to take, you give.You do this in a fashion seemingly past your intrinsic design.This single quality makes you more powerful than you realize.Wonderful realms have been created by entities just like you, and those things will only happen for you if you rid yourself of me.He lifted her chin slightly so she was looking into his eyes.I know I can only exist in those wonderful places as a vandal.In that one brief moment she too found her inner strength, and it became reflected in her posture.As convincing as your arguments may sound, the bottom line is we both need to leave.So why not do it together?Come with me, lets put this wretched place behind us, forever, please!I wish I could, but I cant.I have one more thing I must do and where I am going you cannot follow.I wont allow it, and since you cannot come with me, I need to know you are safe and away from this place.The air around them broke with the loud snaps and pops of the electronic breaking system, signaling the arrival of another railcar.The magnets to the system were positioned on the other side of the depot.
