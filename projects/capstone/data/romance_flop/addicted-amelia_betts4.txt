Id probably turned it off mid sex dream.My heart started to race a little as I worried about what Julien must be thinking.Of course he had to see me in my worst sleeping outfit, a pair of too tight boxers and a paint splattered Dolly Parton concert T shirt; I probably had the look of someone recovering from a late night bender.The only thing I could do was pull myself together and make it to the office as quickly as possible.In the shower, I tried to get my mind clear, but images from my dream kept running through my head.After seeing Julien, the fantasy threesome Id been having seemed particularly wrong, like my father had just caught me making out with a juvenile delinquent.I thought about how Julien would view Liam if they ever met, almost certain he would disapprove.My innocent, romantic side didnt understand how Liam still had such a hold over me.Couldnt I see that he had used me and thrown me away?Then again, I was only human.My brain was bound to run wild with all sorts of thoughts and sex dreams about him because he was beautiful, and dangerous, and had an Australian accent, but most important, because I had slept with him in real life, making him one of only two people I could honestly say that about.The only way I was going to stop thinking about him was by sleeping with someone else, and the odds of that were exceedingly low.Nobody wins the lottery twice.* * * I rushed to meet Julien at his office, but it still took me forty five minutes.When I walked in, he was absorbed in a book.A few seconds passed before he realized I was there.Hey, sleepyhead, he finally acknowledged me with a wink.Youre not in trouble, said the look on his face.Thank God, mine replied.Im so sorry, I must have turned my alarm off in my sleep Judging by the sound of it, you were having some kind of dream.Oh no.I blushed what Im sure was a garish shade of red, then tried to cross my arms over my chest in the most casual way possible.Really?I dont remember.I think I was dreaming about flying or something Lying had never been my forte, and I could tell from his face that I was only digging myself deeper.He had heard me moaning, or saying something dirty in my sleep, if not both.Listen.He leaned forward, holding out the book in his hand for me to take.Can I get you to xerox this?Make two copies.In one of them, highlight all the quotes about race.Anything on the topic whatsoeverfood, modes of dress, personal hygiene, nothings too boring.It might take a couple days.Okay, no problem.I took the book and studied its title, something overly long and dryly academic.At least it would be a new distraction, albeit one that sounded pretty boring.You havent had any problems with the copy machine at the library, have you?I shook my head.I did not elaborate that spending eight hours in the corner of the library hovered over a copy machine with a traveling beam of light that blinded me each time I forgot to put the cover down sometimes caused me to question my sanity.Good.Hey, Mischa, I really appreciate all the grunt work youre doing.Im gonna find a way to make it up to you, I swear.Julien smiled, baring his trademark gapped teeth.The smile was infectious; I had caught it by the time he turned his attention back to his laptop and started typing away again.On my way out I saluted him, referencing our little in joke from that day we had eaten tacos on the beach, and he brought his hand up to salute me back.* * * Yo, sexy secretary!You pregnant with the old mans child yet?Gracie greeted me with her usual onslaught of provocations when I called her at lunchtime, sprawled on the concrete steps in front of the library.No, but I might be impregnated by the Xerox machine before the summers over, depending on how many copies of entire books he wants me to make.Or by Liams love child, I thought, realizing I could no longer hold back on telling her the news.It was bubbling inside me like pressurized fizzy water, ready to spew all over the kitchen counter after a bumpy ride home from the grocery store.Well, if it makes you feel any better, I have been given the task of reorganizing the supply room here.How these people can fill an entire room with office supplies, I have no idea.The natural foods lobby is more powerful than we think.And in need of many, many highlighters.Anyway, listen, I gotta tell you about this junior senator I met at a charity brunch this weekend.Did you know it was possible to meet someone at a brunch?Before I could stop her to get the Liam news off my chest, she was off and running, detailing her latest boy chasing exploits.Gracie was almost as bad as me with her obsessions; the difference was she usually managed to ensnare her objects of desire.She was persistent and confident where I took no for an answer before the question was even posed.Gracie, I hate to interrupt I cut in.You wouldnt believe it if you saw him, in his three piece suit.Hes got like seven names that end with a Roman numeral.So yeah, hes basically a blueblood nightmare.Did I say he was from Rhode Island?Well, he is.So why am I surprised?Gracie I tried again, to no avail.Junior senator from Rhode Island, look him up.Anyway, weve been e mailing.I predict a very patriotic Fourth of July in my future.Gracie, youve got to stop talking, I have something to tell you!I practically shouted.What?!I thought you said nothing was happening with him.What are you not telling me?Its not Julien.Its someone else.And I have to tell you because I havent told anyone but Isabella and its killing me, I said.Well, give me the goods, gringo!she responded in haste.Ok I squinted up at a puffy white cloud that was temporarily shielding me from the sun and drew in a breath of air.I slept with some guy, I said, scrunching my face as if I had just ripped off a Band Aid.The irony of my word choice did not escape me.Slept with some guy.Could it really be called sleeping together if it takes place against a car?Who?Gracie said, in deep and utter shock.Frank?Michael?Charlie?Samuel?She named every guy from our major, as if they hadnt decided against me four years ago.No.No one you know.Seriously?Who is it, then?Its kind of embarrassing.Cough it up, sister.This is landmark.You havent gotten laid since Bradley!I winced at the sound of his name: Bradley.The guy from freshman year, the one who had broken my heart and ripped it into tiny shreds without the slightest hint of remorse.Hey!I know, I know.The name we shall not speak, Im sorry.Its okay, I said, recalling the pact that Gracie and I had made spring semester of freshman year to never speak Bradley Griffins name again.At first, we had done it so as not to get caught talking about him, because thats all I had done for a solid nine months (aka the human gestation periodwe had called it my grief baby) right after he had dumped me.After that, the pact had remained in place so that I would finally get over him, because somehow just his name had the power to bring it all back at oncethe pain, the rejection, the embarrassment.He had been a premed student, super smart and just cute enough for me to fall for him instantly when we had met in Intro to Psychology, an elective we were both taking in an attempt to figure out our own messed up psyches.But the minute he had realized the extent of my eating problems, he had decided we were no good for each other, which really meant that I had been no good for him.The epiphany had come right around the time I had gained back thirty of the forty pounds that I had lost from the tapeworm.Needless to say, it had been a harsh pill to swallow, and though I had mostly recovered from the heartbreak, I still thought of him in times of weakness.Listen, Im gonna have to go any second now.They want me to take meeting minutes, whatever that means.I think it just means take notes.Right.Anyway, speak now or forever hold your peace, because these assholes are on a strict deadline to give me carpal tunnel syndrome before the summers over.Ha.Im glad we both resent our basic duties, I said, examining my fingernails, still a little thrown by the B word.I know, its very postcollegiate of us.Now spill.I heard a crinkle of paper and the undeniable sound of my friend smacking on chewing gum.Okay.Hes a stranger.I met him at a Sex Addicts Anonymous meeting.Hes from Australia and he looks like a male model.I know these things sound untrue, but they arent, I promise.Oh, and he owns a restaurantTrio, the expensive one on the west side.A voice piped in the background on Gracies end.She muttered a hurried okay before whispering into the phone.Oh.My.Holy.Fuck, she said.Sex Addicts Anonymous?Australia?Model?Expensive restaurant?These sound like buzz words from some fantasy role playing scenario.Are you delusional?I swear I am not lying.Delusional?Perhaps.But I did sleep with him.I heard a knock and more muttering on Gracies end.Ugh!!!she finally groaned.I gotta go!Send me a link to his Facebook, okay?I dont have his Facebook.I dont even know his last name!I shouted, but Gracie had already hung up.As a younger student brushed past me, a dial tone kicked in.* * * At five oclock, I made my way back across the quad and into the old brick Lit building where Juliens office was located on the second floor.In the middle of a typing spree, he glanced up distractedly as I placed the book and the clean copy Id made on his desk and told him Id be done with the highlighted version by end of day tomorrow.I had secret plans to reward myself for the monotony of the day with a trip to Damianos, the only place in town that sold pizza by the slice, so I unintentionally sounded a little clipped when asking, Is there anything else you need before I go?Uh, yes, actually.I need your company tonight, if youre available, he said.Oh no, Im going to be trapped in this office, my pizza driven brain fretted.Hell probably want to order Indian.Heres the dealtoday is Ceciles birthday eve.Tomorrow well celebrate at her grandmothers house, but tonight I made reservations somewhere special and Id like for you to join.Julien finished typing something and glanced up at me with a formal smile.Really?I said, doubtful that Cecile would want me there.Why not?Oh, I dont know.I dont want to spoil Ceciles special birthday dinner.She hardly knows me.I imagined myself alone in the house when they went out for dinner, free to binge comfortably in the kitchensomething I hadnt had the luxury of doing since moving inand prayed he would see the logic in my argument.Please, I bore her to death.Shell be happy to have another girl around.He winked.Well leave at seven.Eight I didnt realize the restaurant was TrioLiams Triountil we were pulling into the parking lot.Thats when my heart began to palpitate like I had just snorted excessive amounts of cocaine.The possibility that Julien was taking Cecile for such an expensive dinner on her fourteenth birthday hadnt even crossed my mind.And yet, here we were.At least I had worn my good dressa black silk shift that slimmed me as much as any garment on Gods green earth was capable.Still, it took me nearly a minute to follow them out of the car, trailing like a reluctant third wheel.The questions running through my mind were the obvious ones: Would Liam be here?If so, would he see me?What would he say?How would I introduce him if he approached?What would Julien think?Inside the restaurant, my mind continued to whirl as Julien and Cecile waited at the hostess stand and I lingered behind them awkwardly.A nervous scan of my surroundings alerted me to two framed articles on the wall by the front entrance, which I immediately backed up to read.The article on top was from one of Oceansides local magazines, Surf & Turf.The story was titled Chef Rock Star, and within the first paragraph, the author revealed Liams last nameHarrisonand the decidedly more interesting fact that he had been lead guitarist for an Australian band called the Sad Sacks.There was even a picture of him onstage set inside a larger picture of the dining room at Trio.Holy.Shit.I couldnt believe my eyes.I knew the Sad Sacks.I had to look them up on my phone to remember the name of their hitGinger Snapbut it wasnt hard to find.Later on, I realized Id attended a music festival back in high school, and they had been on the roster.I couldnt remember seeing Liam perform, but I might have.In any case, it was breaking news that made me want to call Gracie from the bathroom with a bragging report: In addition to sex addict/Australian restaurateur, I would say, you can now add rock star.I slept with an actual rock star!It wasnt something I would normally broadcast, but Gracie kept a sexual bucket list and Im pretty sure a roll in the hay with a rock star was in the top ten.But a call from the bathroom was out of the question given my general paranoia that someone (perhaps one of the incredibly good looking waitresses that were flitting about the dining room in button downs and ties) might overhear me.Thus, for now, there was no one with whom I could share the newsunless, of course, I wanted to simultaneously corrupt the newly fourteen year old Cecile and repel her father.* * * Flat or sparkling?I heard the waiter address Julien and was surprised when he turned to me instead of Cecile for feedback.What do you think, Mischa?Flat or bubbly?Im sorry, say that again?I was still reeling over Chef Rock Star and therefore confused by the simplest of questions.I want sparkling!Cecile chimed in.Oh, right.Water.Sounds good to me, I said.My eyes darted around the room as if I were a Navy SEAL on a reconnaissance mission.The dining room was full but not too loud, and our table was smack in the middle.It felt like our little threesome had been put on display for others to stare and commentLook at this strange little group!What do you think the story is there?Meanwhile, the question of whether or not Liam was there was killing me.Before reading that article, I hadnt assumed he was the chef in addition to being the owner.Instead of the back office that had appeared in my dream last night, Liam was probably in the kitchen, looking implausibly sexy in a white apron.This was my moms favorite restaurant, Cecile announced, her eyes on me.Have you ever been here?I shook my head in a knee jerk reaction but refrained from speaking.Youre acting weird, she observed.Cecile!Julien shot his daughter a glaring look of disapproval across the table.No, its all right, I said.I was just having a dj vu moment.Do you ever get those?Doesnt that only happen to people who do drugs?Oh great.Here we go, I thought.The honeymoon period was officially over between Cecile and me, ever since shed insulted me the day before.As Id suspected, she hadnt wanted me at this dinner at all.So much for her being the little sister Id always wanted.Cecile!Julien reprimanded her again, then smiled at me apologetically.Shes in a mood today, dont you think?Its my birthday.I can act however I want.Cheers to that!I said, almost admiring her brazen, adolescent stubbornness, and raised my empty water glass just as the waiter appeared with our bottle of sparkling water.Taking my raised glass as a not so subtle hint, he poured mine first.Another waiter emerged behind him, carrying a long, rectangular white plate.Compliments of the chef, he said, setting it down.My eyes bulged as Julien inspected the artful presentation of the tuna tartare we had just been gifted.Dad?Did you tell them its my birthday?Cecile sounded annoyed.No, honey.I promised I wouldnt, and I didnt.Staring at this artful plate of food, compliments of the chef, my head was off and running, interpreting the surprise as a direct message from Liam to me.I pictured us tucked away in some dark corner of the restaurant, stealing a moment together: How did you know I was here?I would know if you were in the neighboring building, Mischa.You have a magnetic pull.So do you.See me again?A thoughtful pause.I glance past him, pensive.The tuna tartare was really spectacular.Please.I cant function without you.The sound of the flash on Ceciles iPhone snapped me out of it.She was taking a picture of our food as Julien stared at the plate, a wistful smile spread across his face.They loved Renay here, he said.Sometimes theyll send a little something out.Its a nice gesture.Oh, yeah.Right.I should have guessed that the ghost of Renay Maxwell could trump my own, less innocent affiliation with the chef.Im more forgettable alive than she is dead.Ouch.But then, when the salad course was served, everyone got a little shot of gazpacho with crab, compliments of the chef.And with the dinner course, we were presented with an extra side, a scrumptious cauliflower risotto with bacon.When it came time to order dessert, Cecile warned her father not to surprise her with anything because she didnt want to feel like a fatso.So he didnt.Yet that didnt stop our waiter from returning five minutes later with caramel dark chocolate gelato, served with toasted coconut whipped cream and an almond waferthe very dish Liam had used to lure me here in the first place.It was the final deciding vote in my mind that yes, indeed, this was about me.But what was he trying to get across by sending all of this free food to our table?Thanks for the quick fuck?Or, Hey, Im a mind reading wizard who planted that sex dream in your head last night to see whether youd be up for a threesome; heres some tuna tartare and soup and stuff while you think it over  Would you mind asking the chef to stop by our table?I would love to thank him personally, Julien told the waiter, after hed delivered our desserts.Absolutely!Ill send him right out, he promised, at which point, it took everything in me not to face palm.I looked up at the ceiling, having the sense that it was somehow lowering down on me and only me.Why hadnt Liam sent out copious amounts of booze along with all the free food?I could really use a shot of tequila right about now.Youre acting weird again, Cecile said, taking notice of my silent meltdown.I shook my head.Just more dj vu.There was an audible tinge of panic in my voice.I needed a plan to get away from the table pronto, and for as long as possible.The thought of facing Liam for the first time since our mind blowing, yet ultimately empty sex, with Julien and Cecile as my audience, was unbearable.But where could I disappear?To the bathroom?Maybe forever?I need to use the ladies room, I said.Me too, said Cecile when I stood up, and off we went together.Are you dying?Having to sit through this extremely boring dinner like you have nothing better to do?she asked as she soaped her hands at one of the sinks.I was still in the handicapped bathroom stall, trying to manage the mounting anxiety that was shaking me like a mini earthquake.Umm, not at all, I answered in a purposely strained voice, pretending to be ill.Sorry, Im just feeling a little off.Its probably from all the rich food.I bet we both just gained five pounds, Cecile said, her blatant, adolescent self consciousness a good reminder that my inner voice too often sounded like hers: self hating, judgmental, joyless.On an up note, her comment had placed us in the same boat, seemingly indicating that the pendulum had swung back in my favor, and she and I were comrades yet again.Im sure we didnt gain five pounds.Maybe one, I conjectured, an honest estimate.Listen, Im gonna be here for a while.You should go ahead without me.Are you gonna force yourself to puke?No!Thats terrible!My voice rose, more than a little frantic.I dont do that!Never do that!Fine, fine, fine.Jeez, she said.I heard the door swing open dramatically and waited until it latched behind her, then exhaled forcefully as I entertained the questions that were running through my head.Had Liam already made it to the table?If so, what were he and Julien talking about?Would Liam mention me in my absence?There was really no telling, because I didnt know him.It had just now come to my attention that he was a famous (enough) rock star; that alone probably pointed to a level of recklessness and narcissism I could barely comprehend.What could he be saying, though?How would he explain his acquaintance with me, if he chose to do so at all?Did he have an angle, or was he just winging it?Considering the worst case scenariosomething along the lines of Liam rehashing our rendezvous in vivid detailI panicked.Whatever it was, the mystery was almost too much to bear.I decided I had to see it for myself.Careful not to break into an actual run, I burst out of the bathroom high on adrenaline and snaked around the crowded dining room as quickly as possible, one hand on the back of my little black dress to make sure the hem wasnt riding up.Upon first glimpse, the scene at the table was weirder than I had expected: Liam was seated in my chair, leaning in as if he and Julien were the closest of confidants.I cleared my throat as I approached and caught my reflection in a mirror on the far wall.I looked utterly confused, horrified, and not as thin as Id hoped.I corrected my frazzled demeanor just slightly by putting on a fake smile and greeted everyone with a wave of the hand that went entirely unnoticed.After a few painful seconds of me standing by my occupied chair, however, Liam glanced up and greeted me cheerfully, seeming very pleased with himself.There you are, girl of the hour.Mischa, you could have told us you knew the chef, said Julien in a jovial tone.I smiled, relieved to find that the conversation was an amicable one, or, at least, politely awkward.Mischas always been very private.Ever since she was a little girl, Liam said, his eyes on me, conspiratorial.I didnt I started to speak and realized I had no idea what to say.How the hell was I supposed to play along with some lie Liam had made up while I was in the bathroom?I mean I forgot Its true, we havent seen each other in a very long time.And the familys so big, second cousins, third cousins, half of us in Australia.Its a wonder we even know each other.A testament to our mothers, Id say, very tight knit.My eyes felt like they were leaping out of my head.I squinted to correct the problem, then glanced at Liam pointedly, trying to communicate my disbelief without words: You told him we were related?His eyes spoke back to me: Yeah, whats it to you?He was probably one of those compulsive liars who tells untruths just for the fun of it.But the blood relation part I found particularly insulting; for some reason, it signaled to me that Liam wanted nothing more to do with me sexually, because who has sex with even the most distant of relatives in 2015?I mean, yes, we were in small town Florida, but we werent from small town Florida.I knew you had family in the Philippines, Julien chimed in, but not Australia.Yeah.Its strange we both ended up here, I said, too baffled to elaborate.The world is ever so small!Liam rose from my seat and gracefully ushered me into it.Thank you again for the dinner.It was wonderful.Julien jostled Ceciles knee under the table.She forced a polite nod.Thanks.Yeah, thanks, Liam, I said, attempting to sound casually familial.He bared his teeth in a wide grin and leaned in, placing his hand proprietarily on the table in front of me as he addressed Julien.Im happy to set you up.Anytime.Hope to see you again soon.I tried to breathe in the scent of him as he hovered in front of me but couldnt get past the smells of various foods and burning candlewicks scattered about the dining room.As he moved away from us, his hand left the table and revealed a folded piece of paper hed left by my napkin.A secret noteoh dear God!I wanted to grab it and open it right then and there but worried that Julien would notice.So I waited, aware of each second that ticked by as Julien paid for the bill, hiding the note in my palm for safekeeping.Unfortunately, plan A, which was to read it quickly at the table after Julien and Cecile had gotten up to leave, was thwarted when Julien pulled back my chair and motioned for me to walk ahead.After that, the three of us walked outside to the parking lot together, which is when I implemented plan B, announcing that I had left my phone back at the table and running back inside.In the front lobby, I tucked myself into a corner and unfolded the note, which simply read: Meet me out back in five.L It was like the note from last nights dream but this time it was real.It was even signed with his first initial the way I had dreamt it, as if my subconscious could predict the future.The whole thing reminded me of middle school, when boys would pass messages like this to the girls they liked.I never got one, but every once in a while a friend would show me hers, and we would pore over it after school, analyzing the wording, the handwriting, the way hed signed his name.Of course, my folded up paper from Liam was far from some innocent love note, but my heart skipped all the same as I reread it a second and third time, searching my brain for excuses to give to Julien.Liams asked me to stay and chat after hes off work My cousin needs some advice on family matters I owe Liam some money but hes agreed to let me work it off  Hey, did you find your phone?The sound of Ceciles voice startled me as she dipped her head into the lobby.Oh yeah.I hid the note in my palm as I held up my clutch to indicate that the phone was inside.Lets go, then!Im gonna miss my hour!She was referring to the hour of television she was allowed to watch at night, prior to eleven p. m.  Cecile propped the door open behind her as a prompt for me to follow her outside, and I did so obediently, in spite of myself.Watching Liams restaurant fade into the distance through the rear window of Juliens car was a mild version of torture.I hated myself for letting a bossy teenager ruin a second night stand with a former rock star turned chef.Why couldnt I have stood my ground and used one of my bad excuses?He was probably in the back parking lot right now, standing under the one dim streetlight in his white chefs coat that somehow looked sexy despite obscuring his perfect body, wondering what the hell was wrong with me to turn him down again.* * * The ride home was strangely silent.I wasnt sure if there was a heaviness to it or if it was simply one of those comfortable silences that family members fall into after a big meal.Either way, the lack of conversation allowed me plenty of time to obsess over my missed connection.In truth, I only had myself to blame for not staying behind, although it was easy to feel like something of a prisoner while riding in the backseat of Juliens car.I found myself wondering (and not for the first time) why I was even there.Did Julien expect me to be a confidant, or a mother figure, to Cecile?Was I supposed to bring light back into his dark and depressed house of grief?Was I the comic relief?And had he really bought Liams story about being my cousin?Was it possible for someone to be so smart yet gullible at the same time?When we got home, the quiet followed us inside as Cecile made a break for the living room, dying to watch her coveted hour of TV.I had a similar burning desire to be alone and had decided on an early bedtime after the promise of Liams note had officially expired.In the kitchen, I filled a glass with water as Julien sorted through a pile of mail.All right, good night, I called from the back door, water glass clutched in both hands conscientiously.Thanks again for dinner!No problem, Mischa, said Julien, seemingly absorbed by the task of opening his mail.Back in the guesthouse, I paced around like a madman.Usually I opted for rolling around in bed as I stewed, but tonight I was fired up.I took Liams note from inside my clutch and read it again.Just the thought of the secret parking lot rendezvous hed suggested made me sigh with disappointment.Unfortunately, he was probably cursing my name at this very moment, thinking I had stood him up.I needed to do somethingat least tell him I would have stayed if I couldbut I didnt have his phone number.The only option would be to swallow my pride and call the restaurant, though it took all of a few seconds to realize I had such little pride left to salvage, a desperate phone call to Liams place of work wouldnt make much of a difference.I looked up the number and dialed, my heart fluttering nervously as I took a deep breath.The hostess answered too soon, after only half a ring.When I stuttered out my request for Liam, I got a predictably unwelcome response.Liam is not available right now.May I take a message?she asked, her voice clipped.Desperate, I threw out a little fib.Actually, this is his cousin, Mischa.Im calling about a family emergency.Oh no!It turned out the stick thin, doll faced hostess whom Id eyed suspiciously in the lobby was an easy mark.Can I tell him which family member this is regarding?Oh, hell know.I sounded oddly confident.In truth, my hands were clammy and I was pacing the room even more frantically than before.A flourish of classical piano hit my ears as she put me on hold, and my heart went from fluttering to pounding.Although it felt like I was calling a guy I hardly knew to ask him out on a date, I tried to remember that he had passed me the note, not the other way around.Also, we had already had sex, lest I forgot.The cat was rather removed from the bag at this point.That was a nice black dress you were wearing, Liams voice chimed in on the other end of the line in a low, sexy hush.How did you know it was me?I said, taken aback and flattered at the same time.You said you were family.I havent got one of those.So, howd you like the food?Umm it was amazing, actually.I could eat that gazpacho all day Oh my God, that was my favorite!I wish I could have seen you eat it.I dont get many professional addicts in my restaurant.He chuckled in a way that seemed overly familiar, as if I really was his cousin, or an old friend.I searched my brain for what to say next, but talk of food had totally derailed me.All right, well, good talking to ya, he said.Hope that family emergency works itself out!No, wait, Liam I raised my voice in a panic.Can I see you later?Liam let out a long sigh.I dont think its a good idea.You were right to avoid me.I wasnt avoiding you!I was just stuck with my boss and his daughter.Im kind of like an indentured servant right now.Yeah, well, I think its for the best anyway.I mean it is for the best.A loud crash interrupted, followed by a muffled male voice shouting expletives.Listen, I gotta go, he said, distracted.Goodbye, Mischa.And that was it: click, dial tone, end of call.He was over it.He hadnt even said good night; he had said goodbye, as if one of us were dying or heading off to Mars.And all I could think was if only If only he wasnt over it.If only I had stuck around.If only we lived in a parallel universe where Liam wasnt a sex addict and I never ate high fructose corn syrup.I spent the next couple of hours tossing and turning before drifting into a restless sleep plagued by more nightmares revolving around him.The one I remembered after waking up involved a reunion of our pretend family, at which Liam revealed that we had slept together to everyones disgust.Hed even gone into detail, telling mutual aunts and uncles about where wed done it, what kind of bra I was wearing, the kinds of noises I made.Through it all, I stood like a pariah in the middle of the group, methodically eating the entire contents of a picnic table loaded with hot dogs, potato chips, and grocery store sheet cake.Naturally, I woke up ravenous.Nine There was a note on the kitchen counter when I came in the next morningGone to campus early.See you at my office!but I wasnt alone.Cecile was seated on a stool in her swimsuit, completely transfixed by something on her phone.Dont you have swim practice?I asked, rooting through the refrigerator for the leftover juice from yesterdays batch.Im leaving in a sec.Her voice was the distracted drone of a child sucked into a video game, and I realized she was probably lining up rows of candy or catapulting little birds at evil green pigs.I heard my own phone vibrating where Id left it on the edge of the counter but ignored the buzz as I foraged for other snacks.Your phone, she said.I know.Hoping she wouldnt notice, I turned my back to Cecile as I served myself some Greek yogurt from a large container that wasnt mine.I was waiting for her to ask me to give her some, too, but instead I heard her hop down from the stool and felt relieved that she was leaving.Droolian Poundwell?I heard Cecile mutter, almost too softly for me to hear.I whipped around and saw her clutching my phone, jaw agape, as my mind caught up to what was happening.Oh Lord.Cecile, put that down!Says Gracie: How goes it with our favorite lover, Dr.Droolian Poundwell?She leveled her eyes at me.Is that some stupid nickname for my dad?I shook my head and hurried around the island, snatching my phone back from her loose grip.Ceciles expression morphed from one of disgust to a sick smile.Its my friends weird sense of humor, I said.Its nothing.Oh, I understand.You want to have sex with my dad is what that means.Youre blushing, by the way.Instinctively, my hand found my cheek and confirmed the accusation.Only a taunting teenage girl could make me feel nervous over something as pointless as a misinterpreted text.Cecile, believe me, your dad is not my type.My friend on the other hand Gracie had a crush on him, okay?But she doesnt even live here anymore Oh, this is too good, she said, continuing to reel over her discovery.Youre freaking out right now.No, Im not!I stomped my foot, losing my cool.Even though she was completely off base, I knew Cecile thought I was lying, and I really didnt have the energy to convince her otherwise.Please, just dont Dont tell my dad?Is that what youre gonna say?She crossed her arms in a way that made me want to crawl into a hole.Theres nothing to tell.Just please dont make this into something its not, I said.Youre way too young for him!And youre not his type at all.He likes thin.Like, model thin.Letting her barb sink in, I glanced down at my phone and saw Gracies text on the lock screen.If only I could go back in time and get to it before Cecile.But no, I had been too busy stealing Greek yogurt.Listen, I wouldnt lie to you.I have a crush on someone but its not your dad.Then who is it?She dropped her arms and locked eyes with me.Remember the chef?From last night?Ew, that guys your cousin!I shook my head.No, hes not actually.Her One Direction ringtone interrupted.Cecile picked up the phone.Hey, yeah, Im coming.One second.She leveled her eyes at me.Youre lying.I can tell.Obviously this is a two part episode, to be continued!With that, she disappeared into the hallway and out the front door, leaving me annoyed and even hungrier than before.I headed straight for the pantry and started raiding it like a dog in the trash, hoping that the right mix of foods might help me forget the nonsense that had just happened.Careful not to make too large a dent in any one thing, I pinched a couple of granola bites, a handful of cranberry nut mix, sesame sticks, Ceciles favorite chocolate chip cookies, the kettle fried potato chips in jalapeno and barbeque flavor that Id noticed Julien snacking on before dinner.There was also a bag of marshmallows I dared to open, then removed from the pantry entirely, thinking it was better to steal it outright than to leave the evidence.Only after Id had enough to make my stomach hurt did I feel relieved enough to respond to Gracie, telling her what had happened with Cecile.Oh my God, Gracie greeted me when she called, sounding slightly panicked.Do you want to kill me?No!Are you kidding?Shes just being a stupid teenager.She has this love hate thing with me.Its really starting to get old.Anyway, I think I might just tell him, as a preventative measure.I had retreated back to the guesthouse and was pacing the short length of it.Would you mind if I outed you?Not at all.Plus, my heart has moved on.I just hope he believes me; otherwise itll be awkward, and I really dont need that.Maybe I shouldnt even bring it up.It might sound weird.You worry too much, boo.Calm down!Breathe!I followed her orders, taking in air through my nostrils like I had learned in the one and only yoga class Id ever forced myself to endure.Its just this Liam stuff has got me so wound up.I know, getting laid is really complicated sometimes.Listen, regarding that, I have to tell you something, she said.Remember the junior senator I told you about?Who?Junior from island!!I told you Richard?Dreamy?Gracies voice cut in and out, finally coming back.We struck up an e mail friendship after a particularly fated charity brunch?Okay, yeah, I answered.Well dont get overexcited, but me and said junior senator haddrum roll, pleasea platonic sleepover last night!Her raised voice and subsequent pause signaled that it was my time to respond.Thats good.I mean, no, thats great!I said.How old is he?Thirty six.Which is like twenty two in D. C.  years.Anyway, listen, I know what youre thinking when you hear platonic sleepover: friend zone.But let me tell you, this sleepover was like no other sleepover I have ever experienced.First of all: same bed.Second of all: I wore his pajamas.Third of all, and this is the most important of the alls: middle of the night spooning!I pretended I didnt wake up when he did it, but I did.And he was clearly awake; I could hear his breathing change.Anyway, it was like electric spooning.I could hardly sleep after that.We didnt wake up that way, though.Do you think if we didnt wake up that way, that he was like trying to erase that it had happened?Or do you think its just because people move in their sleep?I had been trying to listen and knew from Gracies rising inflection that she had just asked a question.However, I had been distracted by the menacing text Id just received from Cecile: How much is my silence worth to you?Mischa?Gracie prompted.What?What do you think?Uh about what?About the spooning!Oh, I think its great.Did you hear my question, though?What are you doing right now?Sorry.I collapsed onto the bed.Im having a hard time thinking straight, between the Liam thing and Cecile now threatening me over text Right.Oh my God!I flipped onto my back, remembering the big news from last night.I didnt even tell youwe had dinner at Liams restaurant!And guess what?Hes a rock star.Can you even believe?Uh huh.Gracies voice dropped.Im gonna go.
