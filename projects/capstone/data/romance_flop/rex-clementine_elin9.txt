It had been two hours by now and we still hadnt stopped.I frowned as the houses went away and the ocean disappeared.I turned to ask Rex but he just shook his head.I closed my eyes and saw the ocean, warm and welcoming.The salty smell caught my nose and my hair flew around from the wind after I opened the window.I stepped into the water and could feel a sense of relief as it washed over my bad leg.I opened my eyes and I was back in the car.I groaned and looked over at Rex.I dont mean to be a pain but are we almost there?He turned the car into a driveway and I did a silent praise.The house was small, unlike his other ones that I knew about.It seemed more like a cabin than anything.I looked over at him confused.There were trees surrounding the house, no ocean near it whatsoever.But...?Rex smiled once more and helped me out of the car.Just wait.We made our way into the house and I wasnt expecting the plain decor inside.There was a black leather couch pushed up to one side, a small kitchen and a bedroom in the back.I smiled up at him but stayed by the door.Come on.We have to go out back.I hobbled my way over to him and he opened the door.The trees made a pathway towards the ocean, a small beach looming behind them.My mouth opened slightly and I looked up at him.But the ocean disappeared so long ago?He smirked and picked me up wedding style.I clenched against him tightly with my good arm.He walked us down to the path.At the end it opened up to a quiet, private beach.There were lawn chairs and a picnic table.He set me down on a chair and I smiled.The sun had just about set, a small burst of sun still shining across the horizon.I hope this is okay.I know it is a lot further.The nurse said you needed to relax a few days.I figured that this would be a good place.He kissed me gently and pulled his chair up next to me.Are you thirsty?I nodded and he handed me a bottle of water.I cant even drink wine!What the hell.I grumbled.His laugh rang out across the quiet beach.Nope sorry.Only water and juice for you.I pouted but took the water.It was quite peaceful here, much more quiet than the beach would be.The waves crashed by my feet, sending water droplets up my legs.I took a sip of the water as Rex sat down beside me.So we need to talk about some things.He gazed off towards the ocean when he spoke.The whole thing about Krystie.I thought that I groaned in my head but apparently I did it out loud.I know you hate her but we should talk about it.Fine.Well you need to just listen please?I looked at him, meeting his gaze and nodded before looking back at the water.When I first met her I didnt know they had secret plans about keeping us together.You cant hold that against me okay?You can hold it against her though, she knew the whole time.They said if they had told me that I wouldnt go through with it, which I obviously didnt.They had wanted me to be the leader but they knew I didnt want to be that.Octavius is the better leader than me any day.I still dont understand why they would want me to be the leader.It must be some hidden agenda?He stopped talking for a minute and rubbed his face.I took his hand and kissed it.Im sorry I brought you into this Anya.You know it wasnt my intention right?I just wanted us to be happy and then when I asked you to marry me I didnt think a bunch of drama would surface.I wish I could take it back.No.I love this.I love the life we are living.I dont want to change it.Well I wish Krystie would leave but that is all.I smiled and looked up at him.Okay.He kissed my forehead.Well I cant promise to get rid of Krystie but I will try alright?Sounds like a plan.A smiled back at him.My smile faded when I realized he hadnt said what he thought would become of this marriage.Do you think she will give up fighting for you?He scoffed.I doubt that.She sets her mind on something and that is all she tries to get.You dont have anything to worry about though.Marge said she would take care of it and she usually does.Dont be scared of that, be happy that she isnt going to get what she wants okay?He smiled at me but I could still feel a sinking feeling inside.What if she won and I didnt?It wasnt a fight, so there wasnt winning and losing, but that is what it felt like.I tried to release the anxiety filling inside of me but it seemed so hard.The wind whipped up from the ocean, sending my hair in all directions.Rex pushed the hair behind my head and kissed my cheek.You will be fine okay?No stressing.I nodded and stayed in the chair.It was nice to relax after so many days filled with drama.I closed my eyes and let the calming sensation overwhelm me.I could feel every knot in my body slowly ease away and my leg and arm felt at ease.I could feel the ocean working its magic.You seem a little less tense.Rexs voice softly rose over the oceans waves.I feel a lot better.I whispered back.The ocean always calms me down for some reason.I didnt grow up by it or anything so I dont understand why it helps but it does.I know the feeling.He pulled his chair closer and wrapped his arm around me.We sat like that for what seemed like forever.It was perfect.I didnt want anything to change.This was what I wanted every day.I wanted his arms around me and a happy feeling engulfing me.I wanted this to be our life.What Krystie didnt know is that I dont give up on what I fight for either.I will fight until there is no fight left in me.The air turned colder and I felt goosebumps raise up on my arms.Do you want a blanket?He asked.I am actually starving.I smiled and looked over at him.Well dinner it is then.He held my hand up and I lifted myself from the chair.I hobbled my way back to the cabin.Once inside I sat on the couch, looking around at the house.Did you buy this?Is it from family?I looked at the pictures There was one of him holding up a fish, he must have been only 7.It traveled down the family.Nobody wanted it but I said I would take it.He began cutting up something and preparing dinner.I like it.I propped my leg up on the couch and flipped the tv on.What is for dinner?Food, duh.I smirked at his smart aleck remark.I flipped through the channels until I found Supernatural.The smell of garlic and salt grew in the air..Smells good hon.I watched the images flicker on the screen.The show pulled me in as it usually did and I found myself transfixed.This particular episode was to save Dean, one of the main characters, from going to hell.It was really emotional and I found myself gripping the edge of the sofa.A plate of steaming veggies and chicken appeared in front of me.This looks amazing.He plopped on the couch next to me and smiled.I hope so.He popped a chicken into his mouth and I did the same.A burst of flavor found its way to my taste buds when I bit into it.I made a soft noise when I ate the veggies.God why are you such a good cook?He smirked and shrugged.I didnt think I was that good.I have been around for awhile too.I took another few bites and was surprised to see a bottle of wine on the table.He popped it and poured two glasses.I thought I wasnt supposed to have wine?I asked confused as he handed it to me.Well I like to break rules.I took the glass from him and took a sip of it.I let out a low sigh at the delicious food and wine.If this was the life I would be in, I would do amazing.I hadnt worried about work in a while and no stress had come just yet.We finished our dinner, Rex getting awfully into the show I had been watching.When I finally got his attention he held his hands out to me.Bedtime.I whined but he picked me up anyway.We made our way to the bedroom and he laid me down on the bed, propping up my leg with a pillow.He got into bed next to me and kissed my forehead.Now you need to go to sleep or you wont heal.But  His lips were pressed against mine before I could fight him.His lips were smooth on mine, begging in a way.I wrapped one arm around his neck and tried to move my bad arm but he pressed it down so I couldnt move it.His lips continued against mine, a hot mess of emotion overtook me.His hand slid up my neck and cupped my face.Anya.He whispered.I murmured against his kisses and his arms picked me up and against him.He slid my legs open with his knee and positioned himself on top of me.He hit my leg and I cried out.Oh baby Im so sorry.He pulled back immediately and looked up at my face, his eyes full of sympathy.Are you okay?His voice urged.Im fine.Come back.I pulled him back against me, despite his efforts his lips were on mine once more.I could feel the hunger within his body as he positioned himself once more, cupping my face with one hand and sliding his other down my waist.A moan escaped my lips as I felt him press his body against mine.I could feel all of his muscles, his legs moving to get closer to me.He kissed down my neck and bit at my collarbone.I arched my back and tried to hide the pain that was in my arm.Anya, are you okay?He whispered into my ear.I nodded and bit the bottom of his lip.He slid my clothes away from me and slid his hands all across my bare skin.I could feel the ripples of my skin reacting to his hands.My leg had begun throbbing so I kept moving it further and further away.It was now dangling from the bed and Rex stopped.Beads of sweat filled his forehead.This was a bad idea, Im sorry Anya.He whispered.He pulled away and laid on the bed next to me.I let out a whimper and looked at him.Really Rex?I groaned.I wanted this just as much as you did.My leg just feels better over here okay?I whispered.He stayed where he was and I pulled him close.Rex?Please.He simply closed his eyes and laid his arms on his stomach.Rex?Seriously you are just going to lay here?I grumbled and moved myself into a sitting position.Rex stayed still so I got up and waddled my way towards the couch.I plopped down and flipped the tv on.Babe?I heard Rex call but turned the tv up higher.He had managed to make his way in front of the tv and crouched down in front of me.His eyes locked with mine.Im sorry.Im just a little stressed.I set my jaw.He leaned forward and kissed my forehead.Baby, I really am sorry.He whispered.I let out a sigh and nodded.Okay.No being a jerk okay?I smiled and kissed him once more.My body was still filled with electric from earlier.Im really sorry.I am kind of torn up about all this stress too.He whispered before kissing me harder.Dont leave me like that.I grumbled and hugged him.He smiled and scooped me up once more, taking me back to the bed.Promise?I raised my eyebrow at him.He slapped my butt playfully and began kissing me once more.I smirked and pulled him close against me, his chest ragged against me.Our mouths played with each other, tongues swirling around.His rough hands made their way across my body.I felt the electricity consume my body once more.Every time his fingers slid across my hips I felt a shock of pleasure ripple through me.The world seemed to turn gray as I was consumed by pleasure.Rexs hoarse voice rose in my ear before I was plunged into eternal happiness.I felt my body relax and mold into Rexs body.He let out a sigh and kissed the back of my neck.I love you baby.He whispered.I pulled his arms around me and smiled.I love you more.He pushed the hair away from by his face and kissed my shoulder.Im sorry again Anya.He said in a hushed voice.I nodded and pulled him closer.I woke in the morning to the cool breeze of the ocean.I dressed, grabbed some band aids and made my way to sit out on the beach.Rex was sprawled out on the bed snoring so I knew he wouldnt be up for a couple more hours.The seagulls cried out in the morning but the ocean was calm.I looked down at my leg and arm and sighed.Gingerly I took off the bandage covering up my stitches on my arm.I counted them, seven altogether.I touched the skin, a strange sensation was built up but no pain.It felt odd but nothing out of the ordinary.New skin was already healing over the old and soon would be fine.I put the band aids on the exposed skin and put my leg up.It was feeling a lot better, not so much swelling anymore just the occasional pain in my bone.I closed my eyes and smiled at last night.I just wanted to stay like this forever, nothing changing ever.Rex, my noble husband who worked hard at his job and me a stay at home lady.I wanted children soon.I rubbed my hand over my stomach and bit my lip.When would be time?Would I even make a good mother?I sure hoped so.The wedding was a month or so away and there was still a nervous pang in my stomach.What if?If she was picked I would lose everything.There was no way I could lose anything again.The wind picked up and my hair went spiraling around my face.The image crossed my mind of me without Rex and I felt a single tear slide down my cheek.I couldnt lose my love again.There was no way.I sunk my feet into the warm sand and erased the image from my mind.Rex would be mine and I would fight to the end to be with him.Isnt that what Marge said?Dont give up?I set my jaw and decided there was no way I would be giving up on him.I made my way back into the house and fell onto the bed.Rex jumped up, alarmed and stared wide eyed at me.Are you okay?I giggled and kissed him.Of course.Why do you ask?He stayed still and raised an eyebrow at me.Are you drunk?I made a face and he pulled me against him.Okay.You just are never up this early.I was just thinking.I whispered and kissed his forehead.My chest laid against his and our breathing was in rhythm.I felt so at peace once more.I smiled up at him and his eyes were a stormy color again.How did you sleep?He asked quietly.Fine.This bed is more comfortable than ours.What about you?He laughed and pulled the covers off before getting up.Fine I suppose.He stretched his arms above his head.His bare back was facing me, his tattoos so bright against his pale skin.I traced them with my fingertips.Something about it made them so fascinating.Hey, do you have any idea what our ceremony tattoo is going to be?He pushed himself off the bed and looked back at me.I havent thought of it honestly.He shrugged and held his hands out to me.I grabbed his and he twirled me up and into his arms.You?Nope.I giggled.We should probably get on that huh?I kissed his lips and could feel his grip tighten around me.My body felt an electric pulse go through it, similar to the one before.I looked up at his eyes with a widened expression.We shall decide over lunch?I nodded and felt my body sigh in disappointment as he let go of me.I stretched as well and headed towards the kitchen.The fridge was stocked full of everything you could think of.I rummaged around until I found the coffee.I pulled it out and popped the top off.French vanilla spilled from the can and took over the salty sea smell.I smiled and filled the coffee maker and pushed start.The radio had been on all night and I turned it up louder as a good song came on.I began dancing around the kitchen in my undies and tank top.Dashing from side to side I grabbed some eggs, toast, orange juice and sausage and began cooking.The eggs sizzled as I cracked them and put them into the frying pan.I turned the music up even more and threw the sausages into a different pan.The toast popped up just as I put my hand out for them.I swear, it was like in a movie, they literally popped out of the toaster.Two plates were placed on the counter as I began setting them.I slid across the floor and into Rex.He stood there with a towel wrapped around his lower half, water droplets still sliding down his body.You best be getting out of here mister.Breakfast is not ready yet.He scooped me up and kissed me roughly.Fine.He grumbled after I pushed him away.I returned to my cooking and popped the yolks in the frying pan.A creamy yellow spread and began sizzling alongside the egg whites.Maple from the sausages filled the air.I slid the steaming food onto the plate and set the table before going back to the bedroom.I grabbed a sundress and threw it on.Rex walked out of the bathroom with a white t shirt and plaid shorts on.We can eat now.I smiled.He grabbed his notebook and a pencil.We sat down and I was impressed at the quick breakfast I had made.I slit the sausage in half and popped it into my mouth.Are you going to figure out a design while we eat or after?I asked when I noticed he was drawing something.He murmured something but I couldnt understand because he had egg in his mouth.His adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed.Would you prefer I do it after?His eyes shone and he made an innocent face.I dont care either way.Another piece of sausage indulged my taste buds.So I was thinking maybe on the back of our legs?Or inside of the wrist?You dont seem to have too many tattoos there.Is it bad I kind of want it to stick out among your other tattoos?I asked the last bit quietly.An evil smirk pulled at his lips but he just shrugged.That is fine.He held out his wrists and grumbled.What about back of the leg?He looked up at me.He swiftly took a bite of the toast and smiled, crumbs falling onto the table.Sounds fine to me.What are you basing it on?He had already drawn a few different things on the paper.A couple looked like hearts, another looked like a rose and the last looked like rings.Im not sure yet.What do you think?It can either be the same or they fit together.His voice grew deeper as he talked.When his voice was deep I had to make myself think straight.It always scrambled my brain and made me want him more.Would a lock and a key be wicked cheesy?His voice didnt change, he just hunched more over his drawing.I took another bite of my food and let him do his work.The music was still pretty loud and I whispered the lyrics to myself.He pushed the drawing towards me a few minutes later and began eating.I looked down and smiled.What people refer to as a skeleton key lay next to an elegant lock.The key had roses surrounding the part where you hold, vines spiraling down the key itself and the end was shaped in a heart.I smiled and looked over to the lock.The lock was in the shape of a heart, victorian decorations surrounded it.The hole matched the keys perfectly.On the border of the lock was an A and a R.  How is that?He asked when I didnt say anything.I looked up at him and smiled.Perfect.I finished the food on my plate when I noticed he was done.You sure?You will get stuck with the lock.It might hurt.He winked and I felt like hitting him.Will Octavius be able to do it?I raised an eyebrow.He grabbed my plate and threw them both into the sink.I think he will manage.He slid his chair next to me and pulled me into a kiss.You are major kissy lately.You feeling alright?I pulled away but not far enough that I couldnt feel his lips still on mine.Do you think I am not feeling alright?I just want you to know how much I love you.My cheeks flushed.After all this time he still could make me blush.I love you too.I whispered before succombing to his kisses once more.A knock at the door interrupted us.We exchanged odd glances.I thought nobody knew where we were.I whispered.Rex stood up and walked towards the door as the lonely knock sounded again.I couldnt see the doorway from where I was so I settled down into a kitchen chair.I heard a low mans voice and figured it was Octavius.The door closed a couple of minutes later and Rex was at my side once more.Who was that?I asked.He held up a bundle of envelopes and handed them to me.For you.Apparently you have a lot of mail to sift through.I looked at him confused.What?I pulled the letters close and opened the first one.Dear Anya, I just wanted you to know that I think it is amazing what you are doing.I always knew you were a great daughter.Dont ever let anyone tell you anything different.Love Mom.I looked up at Rex and raised an eyebrow.What the?He shrugged and walked away.At first rage filled up my throat but then I ripped open another letter.This one said the same thing.After emotions pouring through me and all of the letters ripped open, tears staining their pages, I let out a sigh.I looked up to see Rex had disappeared while I was reading the letters.Rex?I called out.I stood up from the table, the letters scattering to the floor.I called his name again as I wobbled through the house.I looked out the back door and felt the sea breeze wash over my face.A familiar figure was seated on one of the chairs down by the ocean.I made my way own and Marges face turned to meet mine.Sorry I keep popping up like this, that is just how it works.She smiled and I took the seat next to her.What is it about this time?I asked as I watched the waves crash and wash up onto the beach.Your mother.I turned towards her but her head was straight, looking towards the waves.I stayed quiet for a moment.At first I figure she was just kidding and then the slow realization filled the pit of my stomach.I felt my throat close up.I wasnt one to talk about my feelings, especially about my mother.You need to let go.She whispered.I gripped the chair and shook my head.I cant.It was my mother.The waves crashed closer to us, the tide was coming in.You must.You must be able to let go before you can be with Rex.Do you want to be immortal?Do you want to be with him?People who have lost loved ones often become angry if they become immortal.They go can I go back and make my mom immortal instead?It makes a lot of unnecessary drama.You need to accept the fact that people die.You will see quite a few deaths in your time.You need to be ready for it.I turned my attention back to the ocean and thought about my mother.She wasnt the same before she passed.She had become more irritable and just fought with everyone.Every time I went over something was wrong or somebody had done something she didnt like.Near the end it was hard to bear her but I did anyway, knowing full well if I didnt I would regret it.I see the wheels in your head turning.You had a problem with her, I know.She let out a sigh.I could smell the sweet vanilla in the air as it whipped around her hair.With the sunlight disappearing behind the ocean I could see she had an older face.There were wrinkles but they were stretched against her smooth skin.I hoped that when I became older I would look like her.I know.I just wished we had it better but I understand that I cant bring her back.I bit the inside of my cheek and blew a sigh out of my nose.I think I am okay with it.She turned her head towards me and frowned.We cant go through with this if you arent one hundred percent Anya.For your sake and for Rexs.Rex has come through with his problems of his parents, thanks to you.Now you must realize he is going to be there for you for your problems as well.I nodded and looked down at my hands.I didnt realize I had been twisting my ring around my finger.Marge?My voice came out more as a whisper than I meant for it to.What if I cant get over her?I dont want you to get over her, I just want you to know that you did everything you could and everything is not your fault.She patted my hand.I felt the pattering of rain and looked up at the gray sky.I stood up and held out my hands to help her up but she was already standing.I gave her a brief smile before walking back up to the cabin.When I reached the back door I turned around but Marge had disappeared.A small smile appeared on my face but I hopped inside before I got soaked by the rain that turned into a steady downpour.I glanced around the cabin but Rex still wasnt there.I turned the coffee pot on and changed into an oversized sweater and sweat pants.The crack of lightning sounded out of the window next to me.The coffee pot beeped and I grabbed a cup and poured the black liquid into it.Well dont you just look great.I heard Rexs velvet voice.I turned around, coffee in hand and looked over at him.Somehow he had walked through the rain but wasnt wet at all.He was wearing gray slacks and a white collar shirt.He made his way over to me and wrapped his arms around my waist.Hello there gorgeous.I smirked and kissed him.I am not gorgeous.I am in sweats for goodness sake.He slid his hand through my hair and kissed my forehead.Miss me?He whispered.I heard Marge came by.Did she talk to you?You told her to come didnt you?I hit his shoulder playfully.He gave me a look of astonishment before kissing me.His lips felt soft against mine, I felt like I havent kissed them in forever.His hand cupped my face as he pulled me closer towards him.You didnt answer me.I murmured against his lips.He smirked and kissed my forehead.So what if I did.How are you feeling?I shrugged and made my way towards the couch.You know it is only a month away right?What is?I opened the book I had brought and meant to read the whole time.I only read a few pages so far, nothing worth reading.Our wedding.I glanced over at him.Had it been that long already?Was it only a month away!What was I going to do?I had so much to plan still.I had so much to do and no time to do it.I cant wait.I whispered and smiled over at him as he plopped on the couch next to me.One month flew by.I couldnt believe it.It seemed just yesterday that I was in that little cottage with Rex.I had been to the doctors against my better wishes, but they had told me that I was recovering fine.I could walk normally now and all of the bruises were gone.The past week I had taken off work to get ready for the ceremony.We still havent figured out who would marry Rex, which constantly made me upset.Today was the day we would know who would be marrying Rex tomorrow.I kept being reassured by everyone that it would be me, there was no way it would be Krystie.Something kept nagging inside of me though.I let out a sigh and looked into the mirror.I rubbed the fog from it and just stared at my reflection.My cheeks had more color than they had a year ago, my hair longer and colored with highlights.My eyebrows were a perfect arch, my eyes themselves a darker, creamier color.My skin had become a more olive color than before.Normally I was quite pale but the sun had done me some good.I had changed so much since I had been with Rex.Nothing could take him away from me now.I pulled the brush through my hair as I debated how to wear my hair.At noon Krystie and I were to meet with Marge to talk about what would happen.They had taken Rex away early this morning to talk with him.It felt so lonely in this house without him.I didnt know what to do with myself.Everytime I turned a corner my heart would flutter, hoping to see him.I was the right choice, not Krystie; I kept telling myself.A song played on the radio as I sunk into a chair.Weep not for roads untraveled, weep not for paths left alone.I took a sip of my coffee and sighed.I wish you were here Rex.I heard my phone ring and I grumbled at first but then thought it might be Rex.I snatched up my phone and answered.Honey?What are you doing?Shauna?I questioned.I flopped onto the couch and pulled a pillow over my head.Why are you calling me?I am on vacation.I just wanted to know if you needed a friend.I could hear her voice quaver at my angry tone.Oh, sorry.That would be really nice.She sighed in the phone and I moved back into the couch.She hung up and I stared up at the ceiling.I wasnt sure if I wanted to keep getting ready or just stay where I was.Depression was sinking into my bones.If Shauna was coming over that must mean that tomorrow was coming faster.I pushed myself off of the couch and walked into the bedroom.It looked like a tsunami had gone through it.I had clothes flown everywhere.I picked out my three favorite dresses.I pushed the rest of the clothes back into the closet and caught a glimpse of my wedding dress.I ran my fingers past the beading on the bodice.I longed for the feeling of the silk on my skin.My hair twirled up and the feeling of walking down the aisle to meet Rex at the altar.I looked down at the dresses on the bed.I had picked out a dark green strapless dress, a black halter top and a deep red dress.I threw the black dress back into the closet and bit the inside of my lip.Green or red, green or red.
