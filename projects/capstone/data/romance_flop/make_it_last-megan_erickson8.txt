So you want me to let it maul me?She wrinkled her nose.Maybe itll just give you a warning scratch.He laughed.A warning scratch?A warning would be severing my heard or some other vital limb.Tate crossed her arms in a huff.I dont want to talk about this anymore.He reached over and tugged until she dropped her arms, then he laced his hand with hers.I wont shoot any bears.Were going to eat my moms chicken salad and make a fire and cook dessert moon pies and then sleep in the tent in the bed of my truck.She squeezed his hand.I bet we could sacrifice some chicken salad to the bear and make our getaway.Shut up about this damn hypothetical bear.She giggled, and the sound trickled over his skin like a blast of hot air.The last time Cam had visited Ehrhart Park, itd been shortly before he left for basic training.He and Tate had done this very thingcamped out in the bed of a truck.Although at that time, itd been a rusted out Ford that didnt like to start about seventy five percent of the time.He pulled into the parking lot and waited while Tate hopped out and shoved aside the gate, which had a big sign notifying them no vehicles were to travel down it.Everyone in town ignored it, taking off down the road farther into the park.It was the popular teenage make out spot, and Cam felt a little old, but he was trying to do this right.And he knew how much Tate liked to sleep outside.She climbed back inside the truck, her skin showing a pink blush of excitement.Buckle up, he said, as he took off down the road, the trucks shocks getting a workout on the uneven road.He remembered the route theyd always taken, even though itd been years, and finally came to a stop at a clearing next to a small stream.Cam looked over at Tate, her face taking on a pretty glow in the light of the setting sun.Here we are.She turned to him with a smile.Havent been here since ...Her voice trailed off, her expression sobering.Yeah, me either.He grabbed her hand and kissed it.Lets get set up and then we can eat, all right?She nodded, and they both hopped out of the truck.Setting up the tent together was like riding a bike.They each knew their role and the two man tent was up in less than ten minutes.They gathered sticks for the fire, starting with a pile of small kindling.Cam struck a piece of flint and lit a spark into a clump of lint hed pulled out of the dryer that morning.By the time the sun was half gone over the horizon, they had a decent fire and sat cuddled together, eating sandwiches and crunching chips.Up in the mountains where they were, along the edge of the Appalachian Trail, the temperature dropped quickly once the sun set, so Cam spread a blanket over them, placing Tate between his legs so she reclined on his chest while he braced himself on the trunk of a tree.He picked up a grape and popped it into his mouth, then did the same for Tate.He wrapped his arms around her and dropped his chin on the top of her head as they stared at the fire.Tell her now, a voice whispered in his head.But damn, he was so comfortable.And he didnt want to fight.He wanted to have this night with Tate.He wanted to prove to her that what they had was worth fighting for.It was worth sacrificing things.She had to see that, didnt she?Did you date a lot in college?The question surprised him.It wasnt accusatory or meek.She tilted her head back a little with a small smile, which eased him somewhat.Uh, no, not really.I didnt date.No?He shrugged.College was ...fun.I had a nice time.But I wasnt looking for anything serious and most girls I ...spent time with ...werent looking for anything serious either.She chuckled and squeezed his hands.So you didnt leave broken hearts in your wake back at Bowler?He kissed her temple.Nah, I dont think so.She fell silent and it was several minutes before she spoke again.Im sorry.He didnt know what for, so he didnt speak and waited her out.She took a deep breath.I was looking forward to being with you at Bowler second semester, you know?Then Dad got sick and I messed up.And you didnt try to go to community college?I didnt have the same goals anymore.What I thought I wanted in high school ...well, it wasnt what I wanted anymore.He squeezed his eyes shut and drew her closer to his body.The fire was hot on his face and her body was warm and soft against him.Her hair smelled like flowers, and he wanted to stay in this moment forever.What do you want now?She broke from his grip and turned in his arms.She sat between his legs on her knees, her hands on his thighs.The fire burned bright behind her, backlighting her body so she was a sexy silhouette of big hair and curvy woman.He clenched his fists so he didnt grab her.Those hands on his thighs crept higher, higher, until they reached where his legs met his body.And that was when he reached out and wrapped his fingers around her wrists.Whatre you doing?She shifted closer.On all fours in front of him, knees on the ground and hands on his thighs.Her face was so close, he felt the lightest brush of her lips on his.Im answering your question.His mind scrambled.What question was that?Another brush of her lips, a swipe of her tongue along his jaw and back to his ear.He shut his eyes when she sucked his earlobe into her mouth and tongued his earring.She released it and her voice was steam and heat and promise.You asked me what I want.And I want you.He moaned.I meant  I know what you meant, but I dont know.All I know is what I want.Right now.And thats you, Camilo Ruiz.CAM SMELLED AMAZING.Like campfire and chocolate moon pies and man.Every muscle in her body, every cell was drawn to him.She brushed her lips over his jaw and back to this mouth, teasing the corners of his lips before she swiped out her tongue for a taste.Because she wanted Cam tonight.She wanted to remember this when he was off being the successful man she always knew hed be.Shed said good bye once already when she saw him off to basic training.And that would be the last time she uttered those words to him.This time, shed say good bye with her body.Because come morning, shed tell him she was letting him go.Off the hook.Too bad, his hook was in her too, so when he pulled it out, itd leave her bloody and gouged and broken.She wasnt going to think about that yet.Because right now, Cams tongue was slipping in between her lips, and his hands were gripping her face.And then all she could think about were the sensations that were racing through her body.He pulled away with a growl.Tent.She blinked.What?Go in the tent.Im putting the fire out, then Im coming to show you how badly I want you, too.Okay then, that worked for her.She rose on wobbly legs and walked backward to the tent as Cam poured water on the fire.Thick plumes of gray smoke billowed above them.Then his dark eyes turned to her, a wicked grin on her lips.She squealed a laugh, turned and ran, the cracking of branches letting her know Cam was on her heels.She dove into the tent and Cam was a second after her, careful not to crush her as his body covered hers.He gripped her head hard, his thumb on the underside of her jaw, directing her right where he wanted her.And she gripped his wrist and gave in, succumbing to him.He covered her face and neck in openmouthed kisses, and somehow she pulled his shirt off.She ran her fingers up his sides and he shivered when she hit where he was ticklish.He huffed into her neck, his stubble rasping her skin.Her top came off.Then her bra.And his mouth moved lower.Sucking her nipples, nuzzling her ribs, dipping a tongue in her belly button.When she was naked before him, he sat back on his heels, the top button of his jeans undone so she could see where that happy trail led.He gazed down at her body, one hand caressing her calf.So beautiful, Tatum, he murmured.She felt it, when he looked at her like that.She could have lain there forever with his hot eyes on her body.She spread her legs wider in invitation.So are you, Camilo.He kicked off his boots and pants, then bent and pressed a kiss on each hip.He dipped his head between her legs, his nose brushing her clit as he began to lick.And lick he did.And suck.And hum, like she was an instrument and he the only one with the musical pick.She raised her arms over her head and arched her back and made all the sounds she wanted.Whimpers and shouts.Because no one could hear them in the middle of nowhere under the star filled sky.When she came, it wasnt a thunderclap, but a slow moving storm.She moaned and rode it out and let it linger until she was dried out and boneless.Then Cam was above her again, his breath hot in her ear, his hand cradling her head, telling her he loved her, telling her they were right.And she was too tired to cry.So she kissed his biceps beside her head, waiting while he rolled on a condom, then entered her slowly on a hissed out breath.She raised her lips and wrapped her legs around his waist.But Cam had other ideas.He rolled onto his back, taking her with him.She rose above him, bracing herself on his chest.He gripped her hips, hard.Ride me, Tatum.She liked being on top.It hit all the right spots.But she didnt want this to end.And she wondered if she kept him from coming, kept him inside her, would she never have to say good bye?But his fingers gripped hard, and he clenched his jaw.You gotta move.She didnt want to.Because once she started, there would be an end.To this night.To them.But she wanted to feel him one last time more than she wanted to delay the end.So she squeezed her thighs and moved.First she rose up, until all but the tip of him remained inside.She swirled her hips a little while Cam went ballistic beneath her, swearing and arching his neck.And then she lowered herself.And rode Cam hard.He cursed more and so did she.Because there was something desperate about this time.About the way he looked at her with eyes on fire and the way her face burned from it.When he came, his eyes, those dark, hot eyes, stayed on her the whole time and she wondered if a strong wind came, would she blow away like ash?She slowly lowered herself on top of him, as he churned his hips so his sated length slid in and out of her.He pressed kisses to her face and told her he loved her.She was too tired and drained to say it back.He made her turn to look at him and his brows dipped.You okay?Nope.She went for honesty.Not really.Concern crossed over his face, his eyes perusing her body.But he must have known it wasnt physical.Let me go take a leak.Ill come back and well talk, all right?She didnt want to do that, but for now, she just nodded.Another kiss, to each of her eyelids, then he pulled on his pants and shoved his feet into his unlaced boots.With one look back at her, tangled among the sleeping bag, he walked out.She fell back onto the pillow, wondering how they didnt put a hole in the air mattress below them.Sex with Cam had always been good.But never that good.She wished she could leave now.Before he got back.Leave him a note that she couldnt do the good bye this time.But that was the cowards way out.And she had to be a big girl now.Cams phone pinged somewhere beneath the rumpled sleeping bags.Tate rummaged around until she found it and noticed it was lit with a missed call from his mom and a voice mail.She craned her neck out of the tent but didnt see Cam.She didnt know why he had to go so far to take a piss.It wasnt like she hadnt seen him without his pants on.She bit her lip and then swiped to listen to the voice mail.If it was an emergency, shed go hunt Cam down.But as she put the phone up to her ear, it wasnt Mrs.Ruizs voice in her ear.It was a male voice.With a slight New York accent.Hello, Mr.Ruiz.Were sorry to hear you wont be joining us at Marino Security this fall.We were really impressed with you when you interned ...And thats when her arm gave out.The phone fell with a muffled thud onto the bedding below, the voice still droning on in low, indecipherable tones.Tates chest tightened, constricting her breathing, and her toes went numb because of her kneeling position.Hed done it.That asshole had turned down the job.To stay in Paradise.To stay in motherfucking Paradise.She pulled on her clothes and then crawled out of the tent.She knelt in the truck, staring at the phone like it was her worst enemy.She heard the crunching of boots but she was in a tunnel.A tunnel that held her pinned in place as the oxygen was slowly sucked out.She didnt want this.This wasnt how this was supposed to go.They were supposed to be saying good bye.The toes of his boots stopped in front of her and then his warm brown eyes were looking into hers as he knelt in front of her.A hand caressed the side of her head.Tate?Whats wrong?She squeezed her eyes shut.Tate?Youre freaking me out.Whats going on?Her eyes popped open.I didnt mean to but I listened to your voice mail.Okay ...You did it, she whispered.He frowned.Did what?You turned down the job.For a beat, he didnt move, and then he sucked in a sharp breath and stood up, running a hand through his hair.Shit.She stumbled to her feet, her legs screaming as blood rushed into them.Shit?Shit?Thats all youre going to say for making this decision without me?He reached out for her waist.It wasnt like that  She took a step away from him and his hand hung there between them before he dropped it to his side.Tate.She shook her head.This was supposed to be good bye.Thats what this date was.And I was okay with that and I loved every single minute of it.And you were keeping this secret  He pointed at her.I wasnt keeping this a secret.I planned to tell you tonight.But first I wanted to show you why thishe waggled his finger between themmatters.Why this time, we can make it last.He waved the hand at her.But nope.Youre still being Tatum fucking stubborn Ellison, thinking you know whats best.The words flew at her, some digging into her heart, others glancing off her thickened skin.But thats what youre doing, isnt it?You made the decision not to take that job without me, and it affects us both!Theres a difference.Im making this decision because it benefits you and me.She shook her head.How does this benefit you?Youre giving up your dream job.Your future!He took a step forward, his face like thunder.Im not a martyr, Tatum.Im being selfish, too.Because I want you.And Im not giving up my future, because my future is with you.She stumbled back and had to grip the tent to keep herself upright.The force of his words and the meaning behind them was like an electric shock to her heart.Her mouth opened and closed, no sound escaping, because how was she supposed to respond to that?But it didnt matter that for once, she didnt have a comeback.Because Cam wasnt done.Fuck it, though.Just fuck it.Because Im finally fighting for this relationship, and you want to be pissed and dream up supposed resentment ten years from now.What about now, Tatum?He slammed his fist into his chest, his voice rising.Im supposed to deny what I want and who I love because youre worried about feelings years from now?He closed his eyes and hung his head between his shoulders, shaking it back and forth, hands on his hips.When he spoke again, he didnt look as angry.He looked disappointed and wrung out.If Im the only one fighting for us, then its never going to work.Lets head back.It was like his words entered her brain on delay.And it wasnt until he began throwing his stuff in his pack that she realized what her outburst had done.She scrambled toward him.Cam, Im sorry.Lets stay here and ...But he wasnt listening, collapsing the tent in seconds and pointing her in the direction of the passenger side door of the cab.Get in.What had she done?No, Camilo, Im sorry  He held up a hand, silencing her, and his jaw flexed once.Please dont use that name.Now get in the car, because Im taking you home.After she buckled herself into the truck, and Cam began driving, she let the tears flow.She sat in the passenger side of his truck and cried to herself as softly as she could.She wanted to ask if shed completely ruined them.She wanted to ask if they were beyond repair.How many times could a couple fuck up before they split for good?And why the hell did she think she could ever live without him now that shed had him again?When they pulled into her driveway, her tears had dried.She unbuckled her seat belt and sat in the car, refusing to leave.You gotta get out, Tate.She turned to him, knowing she looked a hot mess.Is this it?He hesitated, and every second was a hammer blow to her heart.I think we both need to think about what we really want.The tears threatened again.She opened up the passenger side door and slid out.Right before she shut it behind her, she whispered, I want you.She didnt know if he heard her.But she felt his eyes on her back as she walked into her house.18      CAM WOKE UP the next morning, smelling like campfire smoke and regret.He should have showered last night when he got home, but it only would have washed away the smoke.The regret was here to stay.Hed planned to tell Tate hed turned down the job.In fact, she heard the voice mail about one minute before his planned speech.And fuck if that surprise didnt blow up in his face.He didnt know why Mr.Marino left a voice mail anyway.Hed already spoken to him, so why he called was weird.But it didnt matter now, because Tate threw it all in his face.Cam had done it this time, put himself on the line to fight for this relationship, and he was tired of it.Tate had to want it as bad as he did.He closed his eyes as he remembered the time in the tent before she listened to that stupid voice mail.When she told him she wanted him.When she came apart in his arms.When she acted like there was nowhere else shed rather be.Ever.How could she so easily give it up?Even now, he felt like his heart was splitting open.There was a knock at the door.Come in.His door creaked open and he turned to see his mom walk inside.She looked good.The pain lines no longer dug into her face.Thank God shed finally found a pill cocktail that worked.How you doing, Ma?She folded her arms over her chest.Since you slept here last night, alone, I think youre the one we need to be talking about.He groaned and held a pillow over his head.The bed dipped beside him and then his fingers were pried loose from his protective plush covering.Camilo.She shoved the pillow back under his cheek when he raised his head.What happened?He lay on his side, facing her.He wasnt sure where to start.Whyd you call my cell?She waved a hand.It wasnt important.Just something I saw on the news.I wasnt thinking and called to tell you, then hung up when I figured you were a little busy on your date.Cam groaned.Yeah, and things were going great until it all went to shit.She stayed silent, waiting for him to continue.He sighed.I love her, Ma.More than anything.Why cant she accept that Im not giving up my future when I cant see my future without her in it?Did you tell her that?Yeah, and I could tell she regretted reacting like she did, but it pisses me off that thats her reaction.And she should feel that strongly, too.She should be fighting this out with me, trying to make this work.You dont think she wants to?He shrugged.I dont know.I know shes got a lot going on, but damn it, were not kids.He looked up into his moms brown eyes.I want to marry her someday.Have kids.Why cant she see that me staying in Paradise is the only option for us?That its the only option for me.You talked like that about her in high school.And I thought ...Im not sure anymore.But I guess I finally see now that she makes you happy.She ran her hands over his hair.Did you tell all of this to her?Did he?He wasnt even sure.God, their whole conversation last night felt like a blur.Well, things got a little messed up.Because she accidentally listened to a voice mail Mr.Marino left me earlier.His mom cocked her head.Whyd he leave you a voice mail if you already talked to him and turned down the job?I dont know.I havent listened to it yet.She stood up with her hands on her hips.Wheres your bag?He shifted his arm out from under the covers and pointed to the floor of the closet.There.She went over, unzipped it and began digging around.Her arms stopped moving and then she pulled out a box of condoms with a raised eyebrow.Hey, you told me to be safe, he smirked.She rolled her eyes and went back to digging in his bag.And he sobered up to realize he probably wouldnt be using any of those condoms for a long, long time.His mom pulled out his phone and walked over to the bed.She held it out to him.How do I work this thing?What do want to do?She sat down on the bed again.I want to listen to the voice mail.Oh.He swiped his thumb across the screen and pulled up the voice mail app.Here you go.Just press that little arrow there.She did and then held the phone to her ear.She listened to it, her face placid at first.Then her eyes slowly widened and her mouth dropped as she turned to look at Cam.What?She didnt answer him yet, still listening to the voice mail, then held the phone out to him.You didnt listen to this voice mail?No, not yet.She shook the phone at him and then whacked him in the nose with it.Ow, Ma!Listen to this voice mail right this minute!Okay, okay, keep your pants on, he grumbled.He pressed PLAY and listened to it.And then his eyes widened.And his jaw dropped.And by the time Mr.Marino was done talking, Cam wondering if he was having a heart attack.Because his heart was beating out of his chest and his hands were sweating.Holy shit, he said, staring at the now silent phone.You need to call him back!his mom screeched.I know!Cam yelled back.Camilo, this is huge  Big.Important.Life changing.And then an idea began to form in his head.He complained about Tate not fighting for their relationship?Well, he still had some weapons.He could still fight.And damn it, fight he would.For the future he wanted with the girl he wanted.Now all he needed was to get to New York.EVERYTHING SMELLED LIKE campfire smoke.Shed forgotten how that scent seeped into clothes and hair and every fabric within a mile vicinity.Three days later and it was still lingering despite four showers and two loads of laundry.Normally, she didnt mind it.She loved camping and loved the smell.But now it reminded her of so many things she didnt want to remember.Like being in Cams arms.Like that voice mail.Like that epic fight.And she still hadnt gotten up the nerve to call him.Because calling him meant admitting she was okay with his decision.That she was okay with him placing his life on hold for her.And maybe other girls would love that.Maybe other girls would be charmed.But Tate wasnt other girls.And this rankled and dug under her skin.Between the two of them, how many dumb decisions had they made for each other?Maybe there wasnt hope for them.How could they have a relationship when they kept fucking up this badly?Maybe the world had other plans for them.She wished she could look ten years into the future.She liked to read romance books, and they were all about the journey.Because romances always ended in happily ever afters for the couple.So she knew to root for them the whole way through the book.But her own life?Who were the hero and heroine?Whom was she supposed to root for?Cams words swirled over and over in her head.If Im the only one fighting for us, then its never going to work.She had to leave for work soon, but for now, she turned on her TV and picked up her controller.She hadnt checked Utope since camping and when she signed in, she saw that Cam hadnt been on since their fight.Which made her stomach hurt.With her avatar, she walked through the house, running her little pixel hands over the walls and petting their dog.She walked out into their backyard and stared at the rain forest full of poison dart frogs.And then she headed up to the bedroom.In the corner sat the stuffed pony Cam had bought her.She patted its head.Then she went out the front door and sat on the porch swing, where Cams avatar sat.This was what they dreamed of, but in real life.A home with the two of them and a dog, minus the deadly rain forest.She tried to imagine her life years in the future, with Cam and without.And as the tears burned hot in her eyes, she couldnt deny that to be truly happy, she wanted Cam there.She turned to him and said, If I promise to fight, can we still have this?Her finger hovered over Cams avatar, prepared to bring up the speech bubble so hed answer.But then she paused the game.Right there.With that question hovering in the air above their heads.And she hoped Cam signed in to the game to see it.Because her heart felt like it was in a vise and she knew his answer held the key to freeing it.ANNE HAD BEEN in a somber, pissy mood all morning.By the time the breakfast rush had slowed, Tate knew she had to talk to her.Maybe if they commiserated together about her fathers cancer returning, it might not be so hard on each of them.She left Margo out front to deal with the counter and stomped her way to the back room, where Anne was shelving cans in storage.She was grumbling to herself and slamming cans so that the whole metal shelf rattled.Tate shut the door behind her and leaned back against it, arms over her shoulders.I know, the whole thing sucks.Anne didnt turn around.Damn right it does.Tate scuffled her feet on the floor and looked down.But were all together, and thats what matters.Anne didnt answer.Another slam of a can.I know youre upset but  Upset?Anne whirled around, a can of diced fruit in her hand.Oh Tate, Im not upset, Im pissed.Tate took a step forward.Well, you can be pissed.Im pissed, too.Annes eyes narrowed, and a weird sensation crept up Tates spine when Anne answered.Well, then you should have done something about it.But now hes gone.Tates head spun.She put out a hand to brace herself on the shelf and waved the other in front of her face.Whoa whoa whoa.What could I have done?Hes not gone, hes at home watching baseball!Annes eyebrows rose.Hes most certainly not at home.He left yesterday.Tate stared at Anne.I saw him this morning!Anne opened her mouth, but then her mouth flapped open soundlessly as her face paled.Wait, who are you talking about?Tate threw up her hands.My dad.Who else?But as soon as the words left her mouth, a sick feeling churned in her gut.Oh no.Youre talking about ...Cam, Anne finished on a whisper.Cam.Tate rolled the name on her tongue.What ...what do you mean hes gone?Whered he go?Annes entire posture oozed sympathy, in the way her eyes focused on Tates face, in the way her arms hung loose at her sides.He left for New York.And that sick feeling in Tates stomach gained strength.Rolling and bubbling and threatening to toss out her breakfast.What?Anne shifted and scrunched her lips.You didnt know?Tate shook her head.I havent talked to him in a couple of days.Not after ...well, you know about our fight.But he ...he left?Without saying anything?Anne looked horrified.I wouldnt have said all that if I didnt know  Tate blinked, barely keeping herself together.How do you know he left?Anne reached out and grabbed Tates wrist.Tate ...She shook her head.How did you find out?Anne bit her lip.I ran into Mrs.Ruiz at the grocery story this yesterday.Yep, breakfast was going to come up.Any second now.Was she smugly victorious?Anne stepped closer.Oh, Tate  Was she?Was she happy that the white trash was out of her sons life?This hurt.Her stomach, her heart, her head.Everything hurt so bad.Because shed fucked everything up and Cam.Was.Gone.Dont say that.Annes hands gripped her shoulders and shook her gently.She did seem happy.Hopeful.But I doubt it has anything to do with you.Tate snorted.Sure.Right.Anne was silent for a beat.Whatre you going to do?Tate shrugged and tried to step away from Annes touch.She didnt want anyone near her.She wanted to go to the bathroom and curl up in a stall and cry until there werent any tears left.He made his choice.But Anne didnt let go.Yeah?And whats your choice?Tate scanned the room, eyeing the shelves of cans.The cat yoga calendar that still said it was May.Her frayed apron.Annes concerned eyes.What was her choice?If Cam answered yes to her question in Utope, what would she do?The easy decision would be to collapse into Annes arms.Let her hold Tate as she cried.Then wipe her face and keep working.Shed go home to her dad and her brother and shed throw out Utope once and for all and find another hero to root for.Or she could make the hard decision.She could hold her chin up.And step out of Annes arms.And she could fight and be the heroine of her own story.So that was what she did.She took a deliberate step back.Annes arms fell away along with her face.But Tate raised her chin and clenched her fists.When she spoke, her voice was steady.My choice?Im going to fight for him.For us.Anne made a sound somewhere between a laugh and a sob.She hauled Tate against her body for one quick hug and smoothed a hand down her hair.You need help?Tate shook her head.Im doing what I should have done weeks ago.Im going to have a visit with Teresa Ruiz.Anne patted her cheek.Good luck, baby.By the time Tate finished her shift, she was steel determination.Shed called her dad to check in and told him everything.Shed been avoiding him since her fight with Cam, making excuses about why her boyfriend hadnt been around.And now that her dad knew, she could hear his strong voice in her ear, letting her know he supported her in whatever she wanted to do.Tate wasnt sure what solution would allow her and Cam to be together.She still wasnt willing to leave her dad to move to another state.But she was willing to compromise.She hadnt been to Cams home since hed been home.As she hopped out of Cecil and walked to the house, the front door opened.Mrs.Ruiz stood in the opening, watching Tate with an unreadable expression on her face.When Tate stood before her, Mrs.Ruiz cocked her head.I was wondering if youd come to see me.Hello, Mrs.Ruiz.Tate kept her voice firm.Im here to talk about Camilo.The womens lips pressed together, making Tate think she was about to get chewed out, but then Mrs.Ruiz gestured to one of the chairs on the covered front porch.Its not too hot out, why dont you sit down.Ill get us some lemonade.Already, this was going better than Tate imagined.Unless Mrs.Ruiz slipped rat poison into the lemonade.Okay.The older woman returned a minute later, her long skirt swishing around her legs, her bare feet padding on the wooden boards.On a table between the two chairs, she placed a tray that held a pitcher of pink lemonade, two glasses and a plate of cookies.Mrs.Ruiz made the best cookies, chocolate chip ones with a hint of cayenne.Cam used to sneak them for her all the time.Tate eyed them as Mrs.Ruiz lowered herself into her seat.She chuckled at the look on Tates face.Go ahead.Tate grabbed a cookie and bit off half of it as Mrs.Ruiz poured the lemonade.Tate picked up the glass, already coated with condensation, and took a sip.With a jolt, she spit out the lemonade and some of her chewed up cookie.What the hell is in this?Mrs.Ruiz grinned at her with the devil in her eyes.A little vodka.A little vodka?It tasted like a little lemonade with a lot of vodka.Okay, so maybe more than a little.Mrs.Ruiz held up her thumb and forefinger an inch apart.Tate huffed in the back of her throat.Warn a gal next time, would ya?Mrs.Ruiz smiled, her dimples popping out, and all Tate saw was Cam.She ducked her head and took a deep breath.So  Im sorry.Tate jerked her head up.Excuse me?Mrs.Ruiz braced an elbow on the arm of her chair and ran a finger down her own cheek.I always wanted so much for Camilo.His father has never been in his life.And he was a Hispanic in a white, often prejudiced town.I wanted him to rise above and be great and follow his dreams.Mrs.Ruiz  Teresa.Please.Tate swallowed her tongue.Shed known the woman since she was a kid and never once had the woman asked Tate to call her by her first name.Tate kept quiet.Teresa chuckled sadly.But I forgot what it was like to fall in love.Especially young love.Its deep and consuming.But it often fades, yes?She turned to Tate now and eyed her.Waiting for an answer.Which Tate couldnt give.Because her young love with this womans son never faded.Not once.
