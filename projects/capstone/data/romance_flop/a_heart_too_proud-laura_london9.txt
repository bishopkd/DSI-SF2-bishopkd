But I must protest, Lesley.What a churlish way to receive such an exquisite invitation.He walked over to the bed and lifted one of my tumbled curls.Dont tremble so, sweetheart.A mistake, I croaked miserably.I do agree that a mistake has been made.It should be my bed that youre warming now and not Lesleys.It seems only fair, doesnt it?Noblesse oblige and all that.He put out one beautiful hand and pulled the sheets back from my body.His breath seemed to stop in his throat.When I think of how long Ive been wanting to do this and held back By God, no longer.After all, if youre handing it out, then Ive sure as hell got the right to it since Im the one whos been paying for it.Lesley touched Lord Dearbornes sleeve.Shes only a child.Then its time she became a woman.With her looks Im surprised she made it to fifteen with a maidenhead.He slid one arm under my shoulders and the other beneath my thighs.Come, my love, and make your offering to Venus.Struggle was impossible.I had barely the strength to remain awake, and as I was lifted out of bed my head fell back against his shoulder so heavily that my mind seemed to float in a dreary vapor.As my vision cleared, I saw Lesley regarding me searchingly.My lips formed the word, Help.Nicky, dont harm her.If you want some hackneyed assurance that Ill be gentle, you have it, but thats all Im going to promise.Lesley, for the love of God, dont interfere with me now.My senses all ran together as sluggish as molasses.The world became a blur of shifting movement that ebbed and flowed like powder in a tilting hourglass.Everything leveled for a moment and I realized I was lying on a bed.I saw the Marquis of Lorne standing far, far above.His scrutiny made me feel like I was being caressed by an icy hand.He was loosening his cravat.Lord Dearborne It was no more than a whisper.Dont, for Christs sake, keep calling me that.I hate making love to women who call me by my title.Another layer of nausea draped itself around my body.All the space in my brain compressed itself into one tiny agonized ball.Defeat coursed through me with such bitterness that I think in that moment I was a bit insane.Nicholas, dontplease.The marquis had been unbuttoning his shirt, but at this he stopped to lean one arm negligently against the beds rail.Why so timid, sweeting?A man expects a little more response from his lover.He sounded glib and silky, frighteningly cordial.I tried to raise my hand to him, I think in supplication, but I felt so weak that the gesture was barely perceptible.I felt suddenly drained of all things save a slithering, mesmerized horror at my own illness.Help me, please.Im so sick.Suddenly, Nicholas was sitting beside me on the bed, his hands holding my shaking head still.Long, gentle fingers stroked the suffocating hair from my face.Elizabeth, what is it?Then all at once he was lost in the cloaking fog and I slipped into unconsciousness.The dearly desired oblivion was not to last long.What seemed to be only seconds later an intense light came searing through my closed eyelids.Manipulating hands tumbled me ruthlessly until a thin liquid filled every hollow of my head and ran down into my gagging throat, splashing into my windpipe.My desperate attempt to rid myself of the strangling fluid was cruelly prevented by a pulsing cramp.Convulsion followed convulsion as my tortured body sought to rid itself of the smothering poison; my blood became a pricking irritant which throttled each vein in its sluggish path.The sound of my own hysterical sobs was the last thing I heard before an explosion in my brain slammed me into blackness again.I think I woke several times after that because I retain a dim memory of hearing low voices and once seeing Mrs.Goodbodys frightened face bending over me.But this time when I awoke the pain had dulled to a blunt ache and the daylight came in tiny pinpoints.Memory returned slowly, as unwelcome as a summer drought.I tried to slide back into sleep but the retreat was halted by the spiteful demons of reality.My eyes focused on the figure of Dr.Brent, who was bending solicitously over me as I lay on the bed, peering solemnly into my face.His previous flirtatious, jibing manner was partially hidden by an expression of medical concentration.My God, Im so ill, I whispered.I was gasping for a good breath as though my lungs were too weak to inflate themselves.What have I got?You have been bitten by a bug, he said, feeling my pulse.His hand was warm on my wrist.A bug?I asked numbly.What kind of bug?You have been bitten by the green eyed jealousy bug, traveling incognito as a randy, though high born, London strumpet.She is a good looking baggage, nonetheless.If I did not have Medicine as my mistress Would you get to the point, I choked out.Or I will vomit again.He held the pan for me.If only the Hippocratic oath were not my marriage vow, he said.There now, you must feel a bit better.You were fed too much opium in your nightcap, my dear little girl.Wine with too much of a kick.I laid back on the bed.Lady Catherine gave me wine last night.Why would she do that?Confidentially, he said, wagging his eyebrows in his most annoying manner, I have my own opinion on the reason.I arrived on the scene just when the marquis dragged her out of bed at four oclock this morning.She says she was just giving you something to help you sleep more soundly, and that she accidentally gave you too much.There seemed to be some question as to exactly where you chose to begin your slumbers.What do you mean by that?She was screaming, How do I know why the foolish chit ended up in Lesleys bed.You cant hold me responsible for that.Those were her exact words.The doctor was seated on the edge of the bed now, acting like a goodwife gossiping over the back fence.Youll feel better soon, he added, patting my hand.You were nowhere near death.Thank you for telling me that, I said.My head was throbbing.I would not have known otherwise.Poor little thing, he said.I regret that I must leave your side now.I sent Mrs.Goodbody out to get some rest; she was tending you devotedly for a good many hours.I will go and get her now.I myself have other patients to attend to.So just sit tight and your Mrs.Goodbody will be here in a few moments.He was gone.I struggled to sit up, moving my leaded limbs experimentally.After a few moments of painstaking concentration I was seated on the beds edge, staring dejectedly at the writhing designs of the Oriental carpet under my bare feet.Though I resisted it with all my will, the full memory of Lord Dearbornes behavior the night before came back to me and I burned with shame.Oh, sweet life, what he must have thought at finding me in Lord Peterbys bed!Lord, it had been obvious what he had thought.What was it that Lord Peterby had said that night he had rescued me from the London slums; that Lord Dearborne wasnt dissolute enough to make an innocent girl his mistress.But if he believed that I wasnt innocent I shivered violently.His casual scorn for me made a mortifying answer to the flowering of my desperately stifled adoration for him.I knew my earlier resentment of him had been my weapon against this stupidly helpless and useless infatuation for Lord Dearborne.If only my armor had not been so weak.And soon Mrs.Goodbody would come to me, probably frightened and confused by the strange events of the night.She would ask me questions.How could I answer them?How could I tell her what had happened?Startled into panic, I stumbled to my feet and grabbed a foolishly ruffled peignoir from the edge of the divan.I walked unsteadily down the corridor.The Fates alone knew where I thought I was goingaway was the only destination I was conscious of.Leaning heavily on the balustrade, I had navigated halfway down the main stairway when the frightened energy that had brought me this far deserted me suddenly, like an unfaithful friend.I started to fall foward, half fainting.But instead of feeling the blow of the stone steps I found myself held firmly in a comfortingly strong grip.Elizabeth, what in Gods name?What are you doing out of bed?Oh, Kit, Kit.Dont take me back upstairs, please.The blood was drumming so loudly in my ears that I could hardly hear his response.The fear in my voice must have been its own message, for he carried me into the serenely sunny sitting room and set me down carefully on the satin daybed.My poor girl, you shouldnt be up.I laughed bitterly.Im nowhere near death, Dr.Brent has assured me.Christopher sat down beside me and placed the peignoir around my shoulders.Youve been very sick, though.Everyones been up most of the night worrying about you.He slipped an arm around my shoulders and drew me close to him.My dear, my dear, you look so ill.I leaned my head back against his arm and, surprisingly, he placed a soft kiss upon my lips.Rigid with shock, I pounded my clenched fists against his chest with all my might.Et tu, Brute?Horrible, horrible.Y you are just the same as the other men, wanting to seduce me to treat me like aa I stopped to swallow painfully.I trusted you.Christopher looked stricken.No, no.Upon my honor, Elizabeth, I meant no disrespect.I could never do anything to hurt you.Seeing you so pale, just well, that was my reaction.But seduce you?Good God, what do you mean other men?So, for the second time in two days I was to soak Christophers jacket.Sobbing raggedly into Christophers impeccable lapel, I told him the full story of the previous evening in all its humiliating detail.I felt the arms that held my shoulders tighten further when I told him Dearbornes part in it.Unburdening myself became such a relief that I went on to tell him of the night in London when I had ventured into the slums and Lord Dearbornes reaction to that.Christopher gave a low boyish whistle and swore under his breath.He was about to speak when Lady Catherines voice came fluting down the hall.She stepped into the sitting room accompanied by Lord Lesley.I could see that she had on her velvet traveling dress.Christophers arm left my shoulders abruptly and he made a move to stand in front of me as though to shield me from Lady Catherine.She laughed shrilly.It serves nothing trying to hide the chit.I care not whom she chooses to lace with.Christophers lips spared into a thin contemptuous sneer, one that I recognized only too well.No one could ever accuse Lord Dearborne of never having taught his ward anything.You doxy, youre not fit to touch her feet.You should count yourself lucky that we dont bring a charge against you for attempted murder.I had never heard Christopher sound so hard.Lady Catherine looked away, but said flippantly: My, how dramatic we are today.Murder, indeed.What I did was in the wretched girls own behalf, had she but the wit to see it.So I drugged her and put her into Lesleys bed, what of it?If things had gone according to plan, Lesley would have come into his room, assumed her willing and taken her.I daresay the little idiot would have liked it well enough, Lesleys a charming lover when he wants to be.Then in the morning, Elizabeth could have gone crying to his most respectable mama, who would have made all right by forcing Lesley to marry her.Elizabeth would have been a wealthy countess; now that is falling very soft for a penniless girl without name or connections.Lady Catherine looked up into Lord Peterbys grim countenance and tittered, I would hardly be doing you such an ill turn either, Lesley.Lord knows the chit is comely enough.Peterbys face relaxed slightly and one corner of his mouth quirked.Ive heard all is fair in love and war but dont you think youve carried things a trifle far, my love?No!she snapped.Im not to be blamed if the brat ends up as Covent Garden ware.Oh, she attracts Nicky, Ill not deny that.I knew that even before I saw his reaction to her tediously artless play yesterday afternoon.She fascinates him, yes; with her silvery laugh and alabaster complexion.She looked at me and her voice was low and vicious.But you wait, my little flower, there are other beauties waiting in the wings.Your reign may be sweet, but by God, it will be short.You have managed to arouse Nickys jaded senses for now, but that wont lead him to offer you anything more lasting than a carte blanche.I think I gave a sob, Im not sure.Christophers arm came defensively around my shoulders.I saw that he was looking at the doorway.I followed his gaze and saw Lord Dearborne.He had been leaning his shoulders against the wall, but at the end of Lady Catherines tirade, he straightened himself and spoke softly: Youre wrong, Catherine.You are speaking to the lady who is going to become my wife.I think once before I mentioned to you that I wished I could faint.Now I was convinced more strongly than ever that it is a skill that every young woman should cultivate.The room was so quiet that you could have heard a feather drop.However, what dropped was not a feather but an ornate china vase that Lady Catherine grabbed off the mantel to hurl across the room.The vase smashed against the floral papered wall, just missing a mirror by inches.In spite of myself, I found that I was glad that the vase had been of recent European origin and was not the graceful Greek amphora that stood on the teak sideboard.Lesley plucked a porcelain figurine from the top of a Japanese cabinet and handed it to Lady Catherine with a blatantly provocative smirk.As long as you intend to behave like a melodramatic bourgeois, then do me the favor of ridding the house of this ugly little piece.Lady Catherine glared at him for a moment before turning to me again.What a pity you didnt keep your appointment at the Cuckolds Comfort.I was so sure that you would rise to the lure of that one, she spat at me.I saw Lord Peterbys eyebrows shoot up and I think my own eyes must have been as wide as saucers.Lady Catherine, how do you know about the Cuckolds Comfort?Because I sent you that note, you fool.I hoped that by having you come alone to the worst section of the city you might have a few experiences that would destroy some of the naive vivacity that Nicky seems to find so enchanting.But evidently you didnt have the nerve to go because you were at a party the very next day, as boringly innocent as ever.Thats all you know about it, I thought to myself.Aloud, I asked puzzledly, But, Lady Catherine, what do you know about Henris murder?Nothing, you little moron.You so touchingly confided in me that you were interested in the subject, so I used it as candy to draw the baby into trouble.So, you werent as dull witted as I thought.Yes, I am.Call me dull wit.Your carriage has arrived, Lady Doran.Wadbury was standing at the doorway, as impassive as ever.I had seen Lord Peterby give an unobtrusive tug to the call bell only a few moments earlier and here was the well trained result.Lady Catherine, whatever else she might lack, had her fair share of audacity.Ah, thank you, Wadbury.Elizabeth, may I be the first to wish you happy?What an exquisite couple you and Nicky will make!I vow it will quite take ones breath away.Lesley, I will see you when you return to London?Lord Peterby bent to brush his lips fleetingly across Lady Catherines extended hand.Assuredly, my love.As long as you leave your boudoir unlocked.Lady Catherine wrenched her hand away but still kept the uneasy smile.You were ever an outrageous creature, Lesley.Well, good day to you all, and dont forget to give my regards to Lady Peterby for her kind hospitality.She swept out of the room and Wadbury closed the door quietly behind her.I sat very still and made a serious study of the toes of my bare feet.I felt Christophers arm leave my shoulders.He rose slowly to his feet.Uncle Nicky, you ought to be shot.Id call you out myself except that I know youd never accept a challenge from me.No, that would be dishonorable, wouldnt it?The great Lord Dearborne would never stoop to dueling with his ward, but to attempt an innocent girl and as vulnerable a child as Elizabeth That, I suppose, you think is perfectly within your rights.Do you think that buying her a few dresses gives you the right to violate her?Lord Dearborne had the grace to flush.Goddammit, Kit, I didnt violate her.No, because she was violently ill.But you meant to.I would just like to know how you justify yourself.I really am curious.Is it because shes beautiful?Shes a temptation to every man who looks at her?What do you think we should do, force her to accept any man who wants her?After all, isnt she tempting them with her beauty?The marquiss face was even whiter and his voice even more strained than Christophers as he said, I dont justify anything.Lord Peterby shot out a long arm and grabbed Christopher roughly.Of course he doesnt have to justify anything.And especially not to you.What do you know about what he feels, what he thinks?Do you think I would have let him carry Elizabeth out of my room last night if I thought he was going to hurt her?Use your head, Kit.He lost his temper for a while last night and gave the child the fright of her life.But he would never have forced her.Dammit, if you dont know that, then you dont know anything about him.Christopher tore himself abruptly from Peterbys grip.I dont care.She shouldnt have been put through an experience like that.Lordy Peterby nodded and grinned.All right.Maybe not.So Nicky is a terrible guardian.On the other hand, Im sure that he will make a charming husband.Visions of Lord Dearborne trying to be a charming husband filled my head.Being a charming husband to a woman he despised, a woman he had been forced to marry through the inept manipulations of his mistress.If I hadnt been such an idiot, Lady Catherines plotting would have come to nothing and I wouldnt have been forced into this most humiliating of positions.I put up one hand to stop the sobs that I could control no longer.Now, on top of everything, I had become a watering can.I felt someone take my other hand in a light clasp.Elizabeth, Lord Dearborne said gently.Kit is right.My actions last night were unforgivable.The only thing I can do in reparation is to offer you the protection of my name.Terrified, above all things, of betraying my love, I pulled my hand out of his as though I had been bitten by a snake.No!No!I wont marry you.I wont.I am sorry.I realize you are frightened of me, not without cause, I admit.But you need not fear a repetition of last nights events.I promise not to alarm you like that again.Marriage is the only way I can protect you from Catherines tongue.Lady Catherines tongue wont do much wagging once Ive stuffed it down her throat, growled Christopher.There would be a certain amount of satisfaction and a lot of justice served by an action like that, said Lesley Peterby.Unfortunately, justice and satisfaction are irrelevant right now.Any move you make against Cat will create scandal.Kit, youre not wet behind the ears anymore.You know that society will wink away anything that either Dearborne or I did to Elizabeth.And Lady Cat would be in disgrace for a while if the full story came outwhen is the jade ever out of disgrace?But the person that will be hurt the most by whatever tale Catherine chooses to tell will be the person you want most to protect.The scandal would ruin Elizabeth Cordell.But as the Marchioness of Lorne, Elizabeth is invincibly protected against Cats malice.I suppose you are right, Lesley, said Christopher.But its a damn shame that Elizabeth should be dragged into a loveless marriage through the malicious meddling of an overheated degenerate strumpet like Lady Catherine.I know Uncle Nicky doesnt care.Hell never love anybody anyway.But Elizabeth deserves better.I couldnt have stated it better myself.Totally overcome with despair, I began to choke on my own tears.Damn you, Kit, have your wits gone begging?said the marquis.Turning to Wadbury, who had returned from seeing Lady Catherine off, he said, Would you kindly locate Mrs.Goodbody and bring her here?At once, Your Lordship, he said.Sixteen I shudder whenever I think back on the sufferings of the next few days.I was forced to endure the most mortifying of congratulations on my upcoming wedding.Of course, Lady Peterby and Mrs.Goodbody knew everything.The marquis had told them himself and their apprehensive misery increased my own.I knew they both felt that they had failed me in some way.Even my sisters became somewhat subdued, though I tried my best to be cheerful around them.I was semi invalided for two days and the forced sojourn in bed increased my sense of isolation and panic.I endured one visit from a withdrawn and stiffly polite Lord Dearborne.The visit gave me such a chilly idea of my married life and later brought on such uncontrolled sobbing that Lady Peterby forbade the marquis to visit me until my recovery was complete.When Christopher visited, his presence could not be said to be cheering because he was morosely involved in planning a mythical, though horrible revenge on Lady Catherine that could in no way be connected with any of us.Lord Peterby came too.After a short, brutal lecture on the insipidity of virgins in general and weeping ones in particular, he pinched me on the chin and cryptically advised me not to be more of a fool than I could help.The story told outside the immediate family circle was that I had made myself ill by taking too much laudanum for a toothache.Everyone either believed the story or else had the tact to pretend they did.In the Mudbury area, the news of the upcoming wedding spread rapidly.The reaction was one of amazement, fascination, and pleasure.Our Miss Lizzie was going to marry a marquis.Everyone in the village who had ever spoken to me felt touched by stardust.At least I was spared the mortification of having it widely known that I had to marry.I reflected bitterly that here I was, marrying to defend my good name against compromise and I hadnt even actually been compromised.And if I was miserably unhappy, how must Lord Dearborne feelbeing honor bound to give his name to a penniless little nobody.He must resent and despise me as the foolish child that he had called me on more than one occasion.It was small consolation that he no longer could think I had gone to the Cuckolds Comfort to meet a spy or lover.Now he knew I had gone simply because I was stupid.My friend Janey Colman came to visit me while I was still abed.She had never been to Petersperch before and it had taken a deal of determination on her part to tap on the grand entrance door, confront the distinguished Wadbury, and ask to be shown to my bedroom.Adding to her natural disinclination to call at so lofty an estate was that some years ago Lord Peterby had found Jane berry picking alone and had so forgotten himself as to require Jane to make assiduous use of her parasol to protect her virtue.Lord Peterby had laughed and desisted but the memory was kept alive by Janes mama, who spat on the ground every time Lord Peterby rode by.For all that, Jane arrived at my bedroom with Wadbury as escort and presented me with a cunning bouquet of wildflowerslily of the valley, star grass, and day flowers arranged with simple ingenuity.But even to Jane, I could not unburden myself.I had exchanged so many confidences with her in the past but here she was powerless to help me.Not Christopher, not Mrs.Goodbody, not Janey, not even Lady Peterby, nor any of my well wishers could give me the one thing that I wanted more than anything I had ever wanted before in my lifeand marriage to Lord Dearborne without it would be torture.It was agony trying to hide my anguished tenderness.I once read some maddeningly eloquent statement on the miseries of unrequited loveno doubt in Shakespeare, who has said a lot of maddeningly eloquent things.Add to the score, too, the strained relationship between Christopher and the marquis.I knew that Christopher, however many wild oats he might sow, was conservative and romantic at heart and Lord Dearbornes treatment of me had shocked him to the very soul.To be honest, I had been upset by it myself, and perhaps even angered, but now in the light of day, I was not shocked.I would no more expect Lord Dearborne to display conventional manners than I would have expected Dionysus to give up wine or Diana to forego the hunt.I was poor Clyti, the sunflower, rooted in her garden to gaze adoringly at Apollo the Sun in his blazing, compassionless splendor.But Christopher saw only that I was hurt and unhappy, and attributed it to Outraged Maidenhood and Virtue Offended.How could I tell him that it was plain old fashioned lovesickness?So many times in the past I had complained to Christopher about one petty thing or another that Lord Dearborne had done; Christopher had been his staunch champion.Now, the roles had reversed themselves and to my chagrin I found that I was the one defending Lord Dearborne, trying to soften Christophers unforgiving outlook on his erstwhile hero.I stared at the damask wall panels and gold leaf canopy of my bed for hour after hour, trying to find some way out.All the old questions revolved in my head.All the old fears of being without means or protection in the world.If I left Lord Dearborne and rejected his plans for me, where would I go?It was unthinkable to ask any of my friends to support mewith the topsy turvy economy of the country, even one extra mouth to feed would be a burden.And I would have to take my sisters if I left.An existence without their merry nonsense would be altogether too bleak.Where could I find a job that would allow me to bring two boisterous adolescents?And to seek refuge with any of my grander friends, Lady Peterby or Lady Anne, was impossible.My pride would not allow me to ask them to harbor me, disgraced as my name would be in the eyes of the beau monde if I refused to marry Lord Dearborne.Even now Lady Catherine was probably parading around London whispering that she had seen Lord Dearbornes lowly bride to be in the bed of Lesley Peterby, though Lord knows how she would disguise her part in how I got there!I could imagine her sly smile and fluttering lashes as she told the story, probably punctuating it with her mirthless titter.Of course, if Lord Dearborne and I announced our engagement and were married in all pomp, then her words would be taken as mere spiteeveryone knows about a woman scorned.But if I failed to marry Lord Dearborne By the time I was well enough to leave my bed, banns had already been posted for our marriage and Lord Dearborne, on Lady Peterbys advice, had written to inform his myriad of relations of the upcoming change in his estate.It was better that they hear it from him than Lady Catherines poisoned tongue.I was glad that I didnt have to face Lord Dearborne in the breakfast parlor on my first morning up.Earlier, I had seen him from my window, cantering in the direction of Barfrestly on his high life stallion, Jupiter.Thus I was able to enter the breakfast parlor with a semblance of poise.The whole company was assembled there, helping themselves to the dishes of eggs, ham, buttered rolls, and fresh fruit that were arranged on the sideboard.Lord Peterby and Christopher rose to their feet when I came in, a customary courtesy that always managed to make me feel ill at ease, like an impostor.Lady Peterby gave me a warm maternal smile as she looked up from the letter she had been perusing.How good it is to see you on your feet again, cherie.All goes delightfully for your wedding.Legions of Nicholass friends and relations are writing to tell how very pleased they are with his marriage.There is even a letter from His Royal Highness, the Prince Regent, who expresses himself at gratifying length and begs that as soon as Nicky has completed his business in Kent he return to present you at Court.As well, the dowager Duchess of Windham (she is Nicholass grandmother and the matriarch of his family, you know) has written to wish you both well and give her unqualified approval to the match.Youre dealing without a full deck, Mama.Ill wager that the duchess said nothing of the kind.A more uncivil old woman Ive never met!Lord Peterby twitched the sheet out of his mothers hand.Let me look.Ha!Here she says, Im glad that Nicholas has finally decided to stop making an ass of himself and put his energies to breeding an heir instead of pleasuring the serving wenches.He had better hurry the business if Im to bounce my great grandchild on my knee before I die.Well, I guess you could call that unqualified approval.Imbecile!Lady Peterby snatched the letter back from her son.If you intend to chortle like a plowboy than go out to a field and do it!Elizabeth, the duchess always talks like that, it means nothing.Merely, she comes from a franker generation.Now look what youve done, Lesley, you horrid boy.Yes, I see.The child is suffused in maidenly blushes.No, no, dont toss that apple at me, Maman.I promise to be good.Well, then, cease that dreadful laughing.Poor Elizabeth will be sorry that she got out of bed this morning.I know that she meant it in the kindest possible way.But I swear to Mars that the next time someone calls me poor Elizabeth I will scream my head from my shoulders.Im all right, Lady Peterby.I can take teasing.And I think that frankness is a very good thing.I have the utmost respect for anyone who can be frank.If I had been more open with Lord Dearborne I might never have gotten into this fix.I sat down and began to pick at the omelette that Christopher had put on my plate.Trying to keep my voice light, I asked Lady Peterby if Lord Dearborne had decided on a wedding date.Yes, weve agreed that it will be best to wait until fall.Under the circumstances we want to avoid any appearance of undue haste.The duchess has offered to lend her townhouse for the wedding.Nothing could be better, for the approval of the Duchess of Windham will open the highest doors for you, and as effortlessly as a swallows song.You can remain here with me until the ceremony, though I daresay invitations will soon be pouring in from Nickys familyall eager to play host to you.You are still looking a trifle peaked, dear.Perhaps you should wait one more day before resuming your lessons with the vicar?Oh no, Lady Peterby, Im not peaked, really.This is my natural colorIve always been pale.One more day of staring at my bedroom wallpaper would drive me mad.I feel delightfully fit, honestly, and Im so looking forward to seeing the vicar today.I have a box of Admiral Barfrestons old maps and such that I want to take to show him.You remember, Christopher, they are the ones you rescued from the fire.Lady Peterby regarded me doubtfully.Well, if you have been looking forward to it, I wouldnt want to disappoint you.But I dont want you to tax your strength.You must take the carriage.I wont have you walking so far yet.Very well, maam, I replied meekly, though it was my spirit alone that was weak.Physically I felt as fit as a freebooter.As I bumped along to Mudbury in Lady Peterbys outdated laudet I told myself squarely that I would have to face facts.The news of my betrothal to Lord Dearborne was already so widespread that it would be impossible for me to cry off now without a truly fearful row.If the Prince Regent had bestowed his blessing on the match, then I knew the marquis would have me to the altar if he had to drug me with Lady Catherines opium.It was impossible to turn back now without making the marquis look ridiculous, and its sabers to safety pins that Lord Dearborne wouldnt let that happen.But how could I go through with it, how could I?I sat back against the worn leather seat and rested my hand on the box of maps that I had brought with me.Closing my eyes, I tried to breathe slowly and deeply, letting the pure country air work its healing magic.Right now there was too much peace and quiet.The twins had walked down to their lessons much earlier, and suddenly I wished they were here to distract me.My dear, dear little sisters.At least I would have them with me through the trials ahead.Christa had told me yesterday afternoon that she had asked the marquis (just to make sure) if he intended to let them come to live with him too.She said that he had told her yes; how else would he keep his peacocks exercised?It was midday quiet when the coachman set me down in front of the small, modern parsonage with its whitewashed sides and black shutters that the vicar always left closed so no light could enter and fade the bindings of his books.The coachman offered to carry the box of maps inside the house for me, but that would have meant that I would have had to hold the team of horses since there was no one else around to do it.Id rather lift a box of maps any day then tangle with one horse, much less two.So I unloaded myself, told the coachman he could return to pick me up in three hours, and watched the laudet lumber off on the path back to Petersperch.I turned to lug my burden into the house when I heard a low whinny.There was the marquiss stallion, Jupiter, under the varnished leaves of the vicars holly tree.The reins were looped casually about a nearby bush, which Jupiter had returned to munching after his equestrian greeting for me.Whew!The marquis must be in visiting with the vicar.I set down my box in the dust and dashed over to the inn, where it was a safe bet that I could while away half an hour in conversation with Mrs.Blakeslee, the innkeepers wife.Perhaps when I returned, Jupiter would be gone and I would be able to put off facing Lord Dearborne for a while longer.After Mrs.Blakslee had given me the up to the minute details on Janey Colmans wedding and I had reciprocated with all the latest information on mine, I went outside again to have a peek under the holly tree.Yes, Jupiter was still there.But my box, the happily preserved contents of Admiral Barfrestons sea chest, was gone!I tried not to panicmayhap someone had seen them sitting in front of the vicars house, thought they must be his, and stuck them inside the vicarage doorway.I was just about to rush willy silly into the vicars front door when the squeaking of worn cartwheels caught my attention.There, driving an empty produce wagon, was my old friend from the Dyle church basement, Monsieur Sacre Bleu.And there, on the seat beside him, was the box of Admiral Barfrestons sea gear!Oh, Ares!Oh, Pluto!Oh hell.I wasnt going to let him get away with it, not if it killed me.You probably recall that each time I say that, it nearly does.You will also probably recall the occasions upon which Ive come to grief by setting out on my own in some self righteous quest or other.So, you would think that I would have learned my lesson by now.Wrong o!Rome wasnt built in a day and you cant change the stupidly impulsive habits of a lifetime by a few bad experiences.I ran over to Jupiter, mounted with the cooperation of the wicket fence, and took off down the rutted lane after Monsieur Sacre Bleu.Of course I could have gone into the vicarage to get the marquis, and of course I could have told him what had happened, and of course I was to regret that I had not done so a thousand times on that long, long afternoon.Just because I had successfully attained the back of a horse did not mean that I had magically become a good rider.To be truthful, I wasnt even a competent rider.I think the only reason Jupiter had agreed to leave the vicarage yard in the first place was because the horse was so flabbergasted that I had dared to get on his back at all.He was soon to regain his wits.We had hardly gone a half mile down the narrow lane when Jupiter stopped in his tracks and began turning impatient circles, taking great care to brush my legs against the thorny roadside underbrush.Whoa, Jupiter, whoa.Nice horsie.Good horsie.No, no, I want to go that way.Listen, you want some sugar?Tomorrow Ill give you some sugar, I promise.Or a nice fat carrot.Youd like that, wouldnt you?Sure you would, you big, beautiful boy.You big dumb brute.I bet you can smell fear a mile away.Youre just like your master, ready to take advantage of me at the first opportunity.It didnt take me long to be convinced that Dyle was the destination of Monsieur Sacre Bleu and the produce cart.That was where I had first seen him and that was where this road led.The only problem now was getting there.If you had seen Jupiter that afternoon it would have rid you forever of any notion that horses are four legged creatures.Ill swear I went half the way to Dyle with the cursed animal on his two hind legs.If only I had paid more heed to Christophers lecture on What To Do If Your Horse Rears.I remember when he had tried to teach me that, I had told him that if he ever so much as put me near a horse that reared it would be the worse for him.To my great relief, Jupiter stopped his fidgets as quickly as he had started them.He broke into a crisp, steady trot that jarred me to pieces as I couldnt post fast enough, but at least we were moving forward.In fact, suddenly we were moving forward too fast.We cantered around one sharp curve and there was the produce cart disappearing around the bend.I could imagine myself turning to wave airily at Monsieur Sacre Bleu as the stupid horse carried me thundering past.I closed my eyes, dug in my knees and pulled back on the reins with all my might.Jupiter stopped so suddenly that I flew into his neck, and got a mouthful of mane and a stunning blow on the nose.Well, at least we were stopped.And we were stopped.The horse refused to budge another inch.Come on, Jupiter.He must have gone on a mile by now.What are you standing here for?Do you think a sculptor is going to come and carve your image in marble?He turned to regard me balefully.Then, as I despaired of ever moving from the spot, Jupiter lifted his shapely hooves and set forward at a fast raking trot.And thus we traveled to Dyle.Stop and start.Turn and twist.Bolt and duck.Christopher says that eventually they are going to replace horses with steam engine traveling machines.It wont come one day too soon for me.Mile after exhausting mile we plowed on.Twice I was thrown by some sudden start of Jupiters, but both times the stallion returned to me, standing restlessly as I made a slow, painful climb into the saddle.He did have an occasional gentlemanly impulse.It seemed like forever until I began to feel the salty breath of the sea.I was staying in the saddle only by clutching tightly to Jupiters mane and leaning my head wearily against his muscular neck.The ox wasnt even sweating.I knew we had almost reached Dyle when we splashed through a shallow tidal creek and the salt water stung some feeling into my numbed legs.A breeze rustled the salt marsh cordgrass which stood in tall narrow strips pointing toward the pouting heavens.I eyed the sky uneasily; it looked like it was considering raining.To distract myself I listened for the sound of the timid marsh rail and was rewarded with a fleeting kek kek kek as the rail went about its feeding.Bon apptit!I called softly.When I came to the outlying cottages of Dyle, I decided that it would be better to take the hilly bridle path that skirted the city; if I went through Dyle I would risk being recognized by some of Mrs.Goodbodys Dyle relations.Having come this far, I had no intention of letting anyone steal my adventure.I had seen no evidence of the produce cart for a while now but I knew, without any doubt, that he was heading for the basement crypt.There could be no more perfect place for spies or smugglers.The narrow track was dusty, and set with sharp pebbles that Jupiters hooves sent sailing into the narrow margins of salt hay.For a while the path climbed and then threaded its way down a steep, chalky cliff.There, on its rocky ledge below, was the church, in all its dour medieval pomp.I slid off Jupiters back and patted the velvet muzzle.Well, at least you didnt murder me, you rascal.I fumbled with the well cared for cinches and the saddle came off easily, though I left on the small saddle blanket.Using the ripped and dirty flounce that I had torn off my gown, I rubbed down the stallion, the while plotting my next move.You can plot and plot, but quite frankly, its not worth it sometimes.For all my thinking, it came down to thisthere was nothing to plot until I learned more about what was going forward and so I would just have to creep around the churchyard and research.Creeping around wasnt as easy as I had thought it would be; mainly because I could hardly walk.Whatever skin there had been on the inside of my thighs was gone and I wouldnt sit down for a month.The lacy go visiting gloves that I had worn were no protection for a day of leather assault.My palms looked like overcooked mutton.In truth there was not one part of my entire body that did not throb or torment me.I considered the merits of waiting for the cover of dusk to begin my prowl but finally rejected the idea, deeming it a time wasting precaution; the area was spotted with bushes that would be an effective enough shield.I circled cautiously around the austere stonework supports of the church.The only eyes that followed my movements were the glum orbs of the squatting gargoyles that someone had once added to the structure under the misapprehension that they were decorative.Now what?To enter the church, walk down the long aisle, then penetrate the mysteries of the macabre basement crypt?So it seemed.There was no sign of the produce cart with my box of maps.I wondered if it was hidden off in the nearby trees or if, despite all, I had beaten Monsieur Sacre Bleu here by taking the high path instead of coming through Dyle.I dragged open the heavy oak door which groaned like a grandpa with gout.The atmosphere of ancient gloom was exaggerated by the shadowed twilight of the interior.
