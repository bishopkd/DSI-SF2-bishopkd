Sophie, her fairylike face red with anger, shook her fist.Ill never speak to him again and neither will Ty.You guys are the best friends ever.Maggie rested her elbows on the table and dropped her head in the palms of her hands.But I cant let either of you do that.As much as it kills me to, I have to stand up for him.How can you?Because he didnt know.You didnt tell him?Annie asked.Maggie shook her head.You should have, Sophie added.I know.What did he say when he finally found out?God, Ive seen Brawleys temper, Sophie said.When he flew threw my door and saw Nathan She broke off.Thats neither here nor there.She leaned toward Maggie and stared into her eyes.Uh oh.What?Maggie drew back.You never told him.Sure she did, Annie said.No.She didnt.Look at her face.You didnt?Maggie shook her head.Oh, my God, Mags.He doesnt know?No.And you cant say a word about this.Ever.Not to Ty, not to Cash.Definitely not to Brawley.It doesnt leave this room.She closed her eyes.I cant believe I blurted it out like that.Too much wine.Speaking of, now I definitely need another glass.She poured herself some, took Sophies glass and filled it.When Maggie made to pour a third glass, Annie shook her head.None for me, thanks.Since when did you start turning down a perfectly fine zinfandel?Since the doctor said Im going to be a mommy.Nonplussed, Maggie and Sophie both stared at her.I know.The timing totally sucks to tell you this now.Boy, is this a night for confessions or what?Sophie whispered.But dont look at me.I have nothing to confess.Annie shot her a skeptical glance, then took Maggies hand in hers.I am sorry.I should have waited.No.On the contrary.Maggie grinned.This is the very best news.You and Cash.Parents!She hopped up and flung her arms around Annie.Im thrilled for you.Sophie joined them and wrapped her arms around both women.I know technically Ill be second cousin, but can I play auntie?Please?Annie laughed.Youre both going to be auntie to this little one.Her hand moved to her stomach.How far along are you?Girl or boy?Whoa.Annie held up a hand.Three months, and I have no idea.Were going to wait to find out the pink or blue.We want to be surprised.I have one more blessing to add to my list, Maggie said.Looks like Ill have to come back to Maverick Junction more often than I thought.Yes, you will.Annie grew serious.I have to ask, Maggie.Where is your baby?Did you put it up for adoption?No.But Sophie shot her cousin a warning look.Its okay, Maggie.You did what was right for you at the time.She vehemently shook her head, the wine buzzing through her.I didnt have an abortion.Sophies body relaxed and, again, Maggie realized what staunch supporters she had.Sophie had been ready to back her regardless.I lost the baby.Oh, honey.Tears welled in Annies eyes.Im so sorry.Me, too.Id have loved him.She smiled through her own tears.Our baby was a little boy.Why didnt you tell Brawley?She sniffed.He made it very clear he had big plans when he dumped me.Plans that didnt include me.I didnt want someone who didnt want me.My mom was a pillar, though.I couldnt have gotten through it without her.Guess thats why I noticed a little animosity from your dad toward Brawley.Actually, he doesnt know about the baby.Mom took me to a doctor in Austin.Dad thought I had a bad case of the flu and never questioned my lying around in bed for a week.Good for your mom, Sophie said.Im so glad she stuck by you.I was scared to death to tell her.But, then, nature took it out of my control.When things started going wrong, I had no other option.She held me afterward, let me cry my heart out.She never once scolded me about it, and I know that must have been hard.I did, after all, get my redheads temper from her.Yes, Annie said.Ive experienced her fire a couple times.Its pretty scary.No kidding, Maggie said.Anyway, Dad was already furious with Brawley for leaving like he did.Why add fuel to the fire?Brawley hurt his little girl.I can understand that.Ive told him to let it go.But he hasnt, and neither have you.I dont hate Brawley.Certainly not because of the baby.That wasnt his fault.She swiped at a renegade tear.He never knew, and that lies on my shoulders.Have you ever considered giving him a second chance?Sophie asked.I mean, I know you can never forget what happened, she added quickly.I only meant that maybeI dont knowthat maybe the two of you could have a new relationship, a different relationship.Were all going to be together.No, Im not.I wont be here.Ill be back East.Annie and Sophie glanced at each other, then Sophie turned her attention back to Maggie.But youll be coming back.For short visits.But even then, Sophie persisted, Brawley will be in town.His business is here now.It would be nice if the two of you could get along.We can get along.Maggie practically growled the words.With a whole lot of surly beneath the surface, Annie said.Everybody deserves a second chance.Thats what kept my grandfather alive.It worked for him.It also worked for you, and, my kindhearted Sophie, for you.So as much as it pains me to say this, stuff your second chances.Sophies mouth dropped open.Before she could argue anymore, Maggie asked, So, Mrs.Annelise Hardeman, what names are you and Daddy considering?Fifteen  Maggie wanted to crawl into bed and pull the covers over her head.Instead, she forced herself to finish dressing and drive to Maverick Junction for her going away dinner.What a whirlwind the past two days had been.All the last minute details to handle, all the good byes to say.Wrapping up one life before starting another.And then last night.Argh, who said confession was good for the soul?Shed woken with one heck of a headache this morning.One shed earned.Too much wine, too many tears.She prayed Annie and Sophie would keep their promise to say nothing about the confidence shed blabbed last night.All these years shed kept her silence, had told no one, and then, just like that, shed blurted out the biggest secret of her life.Well, nothing to do for it now.So much of her life had revolved around Brawley Odell.Speaking of, had he gone through this self doubt when hed decided to leave Dallas?Maggie had never really thought about it before.Shed assumed it had all been easy peasy for him, but maybe not.Had he had second thoughts?Cold feet?Did he still have misgivings?Probably not.He seemed very much at ease with his decision.Of course hed returned home and knew exactly what he was getting into.He knew everyone.Not so with her.She was heading off into unchartered territory, for her anyway, and leaving her little shop.Ella would take good care of it, but Maggie had worked so hard to make it a reality.She released the breath shed been holding.Fine.Now, shed work every bit as hard on her new clothing line.It would soar, and shed laugh as she thought back to tonight and her concerns.Maggie put in her second earring and studied the effect.The emerald cut smoky topaz earrings and ring could have been custom made for the oatmeal colored top.Because of the cowl collar, she decided against a necklace.Slim, fawn colored pants finished the outfitalong with her brown leather boots.Might as well wear them tonight.Who knew when shed have the chance again.Her fair skin looked paler than usual, so she added a little more blush before slicking gloss over her lips.A spritz of perfume and she was good to go.Setting down the pretty little bottle, she took a minute to study the room.Shed moved here two months after Grandma Trudy died.Tonight shed stay in her old room at her parents.Since theyd be driving her to the Austin airport in the morning, it would make it easier.When she left here tonight, she wouldnt be coming back.A wave of nostalgia swept through her.Afraid she was close to hyperventilating, she forced herself to take slow, deep breaths.Once she boarded that plane at Austin Bergstrom International in the morning, her life would change drastically.Excitement induced adrenaline flooded her system.Inside of a month, shed have her first showing in New York City!Celebrities and buyers from all over the world would attend.Oh, please, God, let them want to buy my clothes.Please, please, please.These roller coaster mood swings were wearing her out.Light headed, she dropped to the side of her bed.With more than a little help from Annie, her dream had come true.Now it was up to her to make Annie proud.And she would.Oh, yes.She glanced at the bags packed and ready to carry downstairs.The two large ones held her clothes, makeup, and a few photos.The other?Her designs and personal tools.All her treasures from the little back room in the shop shed created from nothing.Shed carry that bag with her.It would never, ever leave her sight.Tossing her purse over her shoulder, she picked up one of the large ones and carried it downstairs.Setting her purse and bag by the door, she walked back upstairs to get the others.Her fingers trailed over the handrail.Pops and Dottie would be at Bubbas tonight.Theyd returned from their quick honeymoon for her going away party.Tonight, though, theyd stay at Dotties.Pops had insisted, in case she needed the extra time to get her stuff together.Considerate as always, he didnt want to be in her way.Brawley would be at Bubbas, too.She should have realized her parents would invite him.She should have invited him.Shed been hard on him Saturday evening.Unfairly so, because the fault had been as much hers as his.That old it takes two.That darn Texas Irish temper had reared its ugly head, and shed said hurtful things.Words he didnt deserve.Words she couldnt take back.And that was exactly why shed stopped by the clinic yesterday morning.Why shed gotten up extra early to bake him a cobblerfrom scratch.Not something she did often.Yes, she owed him a huge thanks for taking care of Trouble after the rattler.But even more, she needed to make amends.Hopefully, shed set things right between them.But she still hadnt come clean.Hed provided the perfect openingand she hadnt taken it.Would she feel better if she had?She wasnt sure.What about Brawley?Hed feel like crap if she unburdened herself.And for what?Something hed known nothing about.Something he couldnt do anything about, then or now.Her decision to stay quiet had been the right one.But she hadnt stayed quiet, had she?How many times had her mother told her something was a secret only as long as one person knew about it.The second two people knew?Forget about it.Brawley fought with himself as he shaved.If he had any sense at all hed either stay home or put in a few more hours at the clinic.Lots still left to do there.But he wouldnt.Hed go wish Maggie bon voyageand try to be happy for her.No, he was happy for her.Had he really believed he could come back to things as theyd been?Maybe it was watching Cash and Ty settle into permanent relationships that had him edgy.Yeah, and wasnt that a bunch of bull?Hell, he wasnt the least bit interested in taking a walk down the aisle.But Maggie made him itchy.Made him wantwhat?Hell if he knew.He found a clean black T shirt in the closet.Time to do some laundry.Maybe hed stop by and have dinner with his folks tomorrow evening.He could toss his clothes in the wash while he visited.Sitting on the edge of the bed, he pulled on his boots, then grabbed his hat.Okay.Time to do this.Halfway out the door, the phone rang.Shoot!Hed left his cell on the counter.He ran inside and grabbed it.Yeah?Hi, cutie.Howre things in Maverick Junction?He tipped his head back in frustration and barely managed to contain the groan.What do you want, Rachel?You dont sound very happy to hear from me.Brawley could almost see the pout.What had he seen in her?Then he rolled his eyes.Stupid question.Extremely well endowed Dallas cheerleader.Duh.That about said it all.Yet shed bored himunlike some fiery redhead here in town who surprised him at every turn.Maggie certainly didnt kowtow.She never said what she thought he wanted to hear.In fact, he suspected she sometimes disagreed simply to disagree.I thought you might be lonely, Rachel purred.I could drive down, or you could come spend a few days with me in Dallas.Rachel, Im pretty busy right now getting my business up and running.Cant somebody else take care of it for a couple days?Im the doctor.My names on the sign out front.I have to be here.Silence for a few heartbeats.Then Ill come down.He ran a hand over the back of his neck.He could have sworn she understood they were finished.You know, when I left Dallashell, weeks before I left, we talked about this.I know.Then why are you calling?I thought maybe youd changed your mind.Maybe you missed me.He hung his head, ran a finger over one brow.Time to be brutally honest.No, Rachel, I havent changed my mind.Your life is there in the city, my life is here.I never made any promises.Never hinted at more.Maybe No.He gentled his tone.No maybes.Were over, sugar.Time you move on.Didnt I hear you were dating one of the tight ends?It didnt work out.Ahhh.So Im your rebound.Or am I a play to make him jealous?Neither.It didnt click.Hes not you, Brawley.Right here was the best reason he could think of to avoid second dates and creating messy expectations.You have somebody new, dont you?No.He thought of Maggie and decided he wasnt lying.No one would ever have Maggie.She lived life on her own terms.Rachel, I need to go.I was on my way out when you called.Where are you going?To a private party.Exactly what I was hoping for, Brawley.She lowered her voice.Just you and me.He said nothing.Will you call me later?she asked.No.He said it softly, hoped it helped take the bitter edge from it.Good bye, Rachel.Feeling like a heel, he disconnected.Hed been upfront with her right from the get go.Still, it didnt go down easy.Ghosts from the past slipped inside the still open door to taunt him.With Maggie, hed let her believe thered be a happily ever after.Hell, hed believed it himself.Had figured it would be there waiting for him when he was ready.Hed been wrong.From that point on, hed been very careful to let anyone he dated know right up front he wasnt looking for anything permanentincluding Rachel.Time to go.While hed been on the phone, hed seen Pops and Dottie leave.He smiled.Now there were two people who belonged together.Bubbas was hopping for a Tuesday night.He swerved into the dusty parking lot and found an empty space at the far end.Too late for happy hour, so it must be the dinner crowd.He spotted Maggies car, Rita and Seans, Ty and Sophies truck.Pops and Dotties.Cash and Annies.Hail, hail, the gangs all here, he thought.His boots sounded loud on the old wooden porch.He swung through the door, into music and laughter.A myriad of conversations rolled over him.The place was packed.The Wurlitzer jukebox pumped out a snappy tune about somebodys old red pickup, but nobody was dancing.Cash caught sight of him and waved him over to their table.On his way there, Brawley passed their waitress.Ill love you eternally if youll bring me an ice cold Lone Star, Mitzy.You got it, Brawley.She threw him a wink.When he looked back at the table, Maggie watched him out of those incredible green eyes.Her pale skin shone like alabaster in the overhead lights.His breath caught.New York could go either way.Shed either surpass her wildest dreams or crash and burn.The city could be dog eat dog, and he wasnt at all sure Maggie understood what she was getting herself into.But, she was a big girl, and hed long ago given up any right to tell her what to do.This had to be her decision.And shed made itfor better or worse.He squelched the pessimist inside and plastered on his game face.Tonight was a celebration.He either joined in or turned around and left.He was in.He slid onto his chair as Mitzy placed a longneck bottle in front of him.Want a glass?No, maam.Thisll do fine.Picking it up, he took a long, slow drink, then set the beer on the table.Evening, everybody.Yall order yet?Nope, we were waiting for you.Ty held out a platter of nachos.Have some of these.Dont mind if I do.He forked a few onto one of the small plates in the center of the table and scooped up some guacamole and sour cream.Maggie, youre looking gorgeous.Thank you.You get packed?I did.Im staying at my parents tonight.He nodded.Message received and understood.The lady had shut the door on any possibilities for an after dinner rendezvous.Understandably so.Just as Mitzy wandered over to take their orders, Doc Gibson came through the door.Maggie waved at him.Join us.You sure?Its my party, and Id love to have you with us.Unless, of course, youre meeting someone, Maggie said.Nope.Stopped by for some dinner.Brawley extended his leg and pushed out the chair beside him.Take a load off, pal.Mitzy stood, pencil poised over her order pad.Sorry, Maggie said.Were ready.Take everybody elses first, Doc said.Give me a minute to look over the menu.Why?Cash teased.You have the thing memorized.I know, I know.But the memorys not as good as it used to be.I might see something on here Ive forgotten about.Rita chuckled.As many times as youve eaten here?Their waitress made the rounds of the table and got everyone elses order.Doc?What did you decide on?Chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes with the gravy on the side, and a serving of grilled mushrooms?I think Ill have my gravy on the potatoes tonight, Miss Smarty Pants.He handed her the menu as everyone laughed.Am I really that stuck in the mud?Hell, no, Brawley said.But you know a good thing when you see it.His eyes slid to Maggie.Youre right, Doc Gibson growled.And thats exactly why I waited till I could get you to take over for me.Had to know my patients would be in good hands.Mitzy rolled her eyes.And that would be my cue to go place your orders.The kitchens a little backed up tonight, so it might be a bit.It doesnt matter, Pops said.None of us are in any hurry.He squeezed his new brides hand.After their waitress left, Cash scooted back his chair.Come on, Maggie mine, lets hit the dance floor and show them how its done.She grinned.Why dont we?Brawley envied the ease with which the two friends threw themselves into the dance, smiled when Fletch herded Dottie onto the floor.Doc Gibson asked Helen Reynolds, out to dinner with her daughter, to take a spin around the floor with him.Brawley watched in surprise.The old guy was incredibly light on his feet.Soon, the entire table had emptied except for himself and Annie.Come on, beautiful.Dance with me.Hand at her back, he led her onto the floor.One song moved into another and everyone changed partners, even the newlywed Fletch and Dottie.A third song found Maggie in his arms.And thank heavens, it was a slow one.Thinking of You by Dierks Bentley.Oh, yeah.He tucked her into him and dropped his chin on the top of her head.She might be feisty as all get out, but her five foot eight, curvy body melted into him tonight.He held a very mellow Maggie in his arms.Im gonna miss you, sweetheart.Brawley Odell, if what I saw yesterday is any indication, youre going to be so busy you wont know which end is up.He chuckled.That might be, but a fellow can only work so many hours.Then what am I gonna do?A hint of sadness flickered in her eyes.Im sure youll manage to find someone in this town who will be more than happy to keep company with you.He didnt answer.The song ended, and Mitzy showed up at their table with the first of their dinners.Two by two, the couples drifted back to their seats.Good food and good friends.The conversation flowed freely.With a mischievous expression, Maggie leaned toward Cash and Annie.Well?Well what?Cash asked.Oh, come on.Maggie swatted him.Ouch!Arent you going to tell everybody?Annie shook her head.Tonights your night.Well do it another time.Maggies mouth dropped open.What?And make me miss it?Bull!She stood and tapped her water glass.The table grew silent.Brawley, glancing from Annie to Maggie to Cash, found himself amused at the wild eyed glances bouncing among them.First and most important.Maggie took a deep breath.I want you all to know how very much I love you.Her lower lip trembled.Her mom and dad sat on either side of her, and she laid a hand on both their shoulders.Youve been my biggest cheerleaders.Youve encouraged me and believed in me when even I didnt.Hoots and hollers broke out.Dont forget about us once you hit the big time, Sophie said.Not a chance.Maggie grinned.Tonights a happy night.A time to be thankful for all weve been given.For each other.A time to celebrate life.And speaking of life, I believe Cash and Annie have an announcement to make.She gestured to them.Your turn.Annie blushed and Cash stuck out his chest.He stood, pulling his wife up beside him.His arm tightened around her.You want to tell them or should I?You do it.My Annie and I are gonna have us a baby!Thats why you didnt drink sangria last week, Rita shouted.Annie nodded, her grin as wide as the Texas sky.Cash pulled her in for a long kiss.And that kind of lip locking is one of the things that no doubt led to her condition, Brawley drawled.Youd better believe it.Cashs eyes twinkled, and Annie delivered a playful punch to his chest.When?Dottie asked.End of October, Annie answered.Brawley noticed Ty had turned very quiet and sent more than one furtive glance Sophies way.Hmmm.Something going on there.From Tys expression, Brawley decided that something didnt have his friend turning cartwheels.The party finally wound down, and everyone gathered purses and doggy bags.The girls hugged and cried.Ty and Cash each gave Maggie a long, hard hug.Doc Gibson said, Maggie, girl, youre gonna put this little Texas town on the map.Couldnt be prouder of you if you were my own daughter.He kissed her cheek.You be sure to get back here to see us, you hear?She nodded, a renegade tear trickling down her cheek.Dont you be crying now, darlin.This isnt good bye.I know.She wrapped her arms around him.Ill miss you.Im gonna miss you, too.Doc cleared his throat.And now Id best be getting home.Got two dogs that are probably walking cross legged about now.Been longer than I meant, and theyll be needing a trip outside.As he walked toward the door, Brawley finagled his way toward Maggie.How are you getting to the airport in the morning?Mom and Dad are driving me.He nodded.Then he cursed as she actually held out her hand.Whats this?A handshake?I dont think so.He snaked an arm around her waist and pulled her closer, dropped his lips on hers.He forced himself to keep it light.When he raised his head, she said, Good bye, Brawley.Good luck with your clinic.Maggie No.Dont.I dont want to cry, and Im awfully close.As wonderful as all this is, theres part of me that wants nothing more than to stay here and watch Annie grow big with Cashs baby, help Fletch and Dottie settle in, attend the triplets kindergarten graduation.Ill miss all that.Ill miss everyone so much.He took her face in his hands.Marveled again at how fragile she was.With her big personality, he sometimes forgot.I wont lie and tell you Im glad youre going.He shook his head.But as much as Id like to beg you to stay, you need to do this, Mags.You need to spread your wings.This opportunity, well, its one you have to grab.Youll kick yourself forever if you dont.I know.And once Im on that plane, Ill be fine.Ill be good.Oh, Brawley.She laid a hand on his arm, a smile blossoming.I never in a million years thought Id have this chance.He kissed the tip of her nose.You earned it, Red.I did.And with that, his cocky redhead was back.Sixteen  Her flight would board soon.It was time she headed to her gate.Laughing at Popss joke, Maggie looked up.Over the heads of the crowd, she saw Brawley striding toward them.Stalking would probably be more apt.Their eyes met.Oh, no, she groaned.Whats wrong?her mom asked.I told him not to come.All eyes turned to Brawley.If you dont want him here Her father stood.No, its okay, Dad.Brawley reached them, tipped his hat to the women, nodded a greeting to the men.Morning, everybody.Mind if I steal Maggie for a couple minutes?Why are you here?I wanted to see you off, Mags.His eyes were bloodshot and full of pain.Talk to me.Give me two minutes, and Ill go away.Theres nothing to talk about.Like hell.He took her arm, ignored the growl that erupted from Sean Sullivan.Maggie held out her hand.Its okay, Dad.She shook off Brawleys grip and walked with him out of earshot of the others.What do you want?she hissed.I want to know if theres any chance for us.I know what I said last night, and I meant every word.I dont want you not to go.That isnt what Im suggesting.But, well, hell, after the other night, I think I have a right to know.After the other night?What happened the other night?You slept with me.I did not.Okay, you didnt.But we were both practically naked and about as close Oh, for Heat raced over her face, and she broke off, staring open mouthed at him.Arms folded over her chest, her right foot tapped furiously on the airport tile.You should know by now close only counts in horseshoes, right?Definitely not in bed.And keep your voice down.Why?Im not ashamed of anything weve done.Maybe I am.Ouch.That hurts.Cuts to the bone, in fact.She rolled her eyes, then looked at him again.Damned if he didnt actually look hurt.His ego, no doubt.Not his feelings.He didnt have any of those.Still You look like hell, Brawley.Did you get any sleep last night?Very little.Come on.Talk to me, Maggie.She stomped off across the terminal and dropped into one of the ugly, uncomfortable vinyl chairs.He followed suit.Look, he said.Im not going to get in your way.You have to go.Have to follow your dreams.I understand that.But I want you to know that when youve seen what you need to see, done what you need to do, Ill be here for you.Like you were before?I was young and stupid and I did you wrong.Ive never denied that.At eighteen, I wanted you more than my next breath.She saw him wince and studied the new purple polish on her toes.But all thats in the past.Were history, Brawley.How many times do I have to tell you that?I dont believe you for a minute.See, heres the thing.You say the words, but your actions dont match.Saturday night?When we touched?Hot and explosive.If were not made for each other, weve got a problem because Im not sure theres anyone else for meor for you, for that matter.She moaned.Dont even say that.I already did, and I told you before, once you hear something Right.It cant be unheard.He took her chin between two fingers and raised her gaze to his.I want you to think about what Ive said.In the meantime, hop on that plane and put Maverick Junction, Texas, on the map.Im proud of you.Enjoy this, sugar.Brawley He shook his head.Youre headed for your star, and youre gonna catch it.A sad smile lifted a corner of his lips.You have to go.Doesnt mean I cant be sorry as hell, though.He lifted her hand and brought it to his lips.If things dont work out or you change your mind His voice broke.Ill be here.Waiting for you.You can come home.Brawley, dont wait for me.Its no way to live.I know from personal experience.I wont be coming back.He stared into her eyes for another few seconds.Gotcha.One more thing before I go.What?This.Right there, in front of God, country, and her family, he thumbed back his Stetson and brought his lips to hers.He kissed her as shed never been kissed.The emotion, raw and powerful, swept over her.He pulled away and tucked his hands in his pockets.He nodded toward her parents, grandfather, and Dottie, then turned and walked away.She bit her lip to keep from calling him back.He was wrong.They werent made for each other, werent meant to be together.Taking a deep breath, she closed her eyes for the count of ten.Wiping damp palms on her navy pencil skirt, she jumped up and moved to where the others stood silent, watching her.You okay?her dad asked.Im fine.She smiled at him, then glanced at the airport clock.Oh, you guys, I love you, but its time to go.She threw her arms around her mom and kissed her.She hugged Dottie, then buried her face against Popss neck.Ill miss you.I know, sweetheart, but youll be so busy you wont have time to do more than come up for air.Call.Often.Let us know how youre doing, Pops said.I will, and if you newlyweds have time, maybe you can visit, use New York as a second honeymoon.Well be there for your show, her grandfather said.Wild horses couldnt keep any of us away.Her dad threw an arm over her shoulder, drew her close, and kissed her forehead.Keep your options open, honey.Always keep your options open.A whole new world is yours for the taking.Your mom and I are so, so proud.Thank you, Daddy.She hugged him tightly.I love you, he said simply.If you need me, call.Im here for you always, baby girl.She smiled at him, waved at them all, and got in line for the metal detector.Setting her bag on the belt, she put her purse and magazine in a bin along with her shoes.She spoke to the security attendant, then stepped through the scanner, not daring a look back.Thirty minutes later, seat belt fastened and a copy of Vogue in hand, the plane backed onto the tarmac, preparing for flight.Maggie stared out the window and watched as they taxied onto the runway.Shed expected to leave Texas with a smile on her face.Instead, she was flying off to her dreams with tears in her eyes.Damn Brawley Odell for that!Seventeen  When the plane touched down, Maggies heart nearly leaped from her chest.As of this moment, she officially lived in New York City!Oh, my gosh!Whod have believed it?Not her!Exhausted from a nearly sleepless night in her strangely unfamiliar childhood bed, shed slept part of the way and doodled on her sketch pad the rest of the trip.The less than four hour flight had passed quickly.Now that she was here, though, any lethargy shed felt sloughed away.She knew the grin on her face was ridiculously huge as she gathered her belongings and headed down the narrow aisle.The stewardess smiled at her as she stepped off the plane.Have a good day.Oh, Im going to.No one met her plane.Zandra, her new assistant, had offered, but Maggie declined.Maybe it was pride, maybe fear.Probably a mix of both with a few other emotions stirred into the brew.Regardless of the reason, she wanted to find her own way today.She needed to.If this city held her future, would be her home, her life, she needed to learn how to navigate it.In the taxi, she made a quick call to her mom.Im here safe and sound.Let Pops and Dottie know, would you?They chatted another couple minutes, then she hung up and phoned Ella to check on the shop.Everything was running smoothly.Even while relief filled her, she found herself almost wishing thered been just the tiniest snag, something that only she could fix.Her business, her baby, didnt need her.Because shed found an excellent employee and trained her well, Maggie told herself.Still, it was always nice to be needed.For a fraction of a second, she actually considered calling Brawley to touch base.To hear his voice.Her finger scrolled down to his name before she caught herself.What the heck was she doing?And what had possessed her to even add his name to her contacts?She dropped her phone into her purse and stared out the window as the taxi passed skyscraper after skyscraper.New leaves, the bright green of spring, peppered the trees along the way.A few flowering ones splashed color against the grays and browns of the buildings.Store after store after store rushed past.The sidewalks were filled with people scurrying to work, to home, to shops.The energy fascinated her and filled her with a vitality of her own.When the driver pulled up in front of the brownstone where shed rented an apartment, she fairly vibrated with it.Her new home.The cabby retrieved her luggage from the trunk, and she paid him.As he drove away, she pulled out her phone and took a photo of herself in front of her stoop.Without thought, she sent it to Brawley.U have new paint, I have a new address.Then, guiltily, she sent the picture, along with a different message, to her mom, who really should have been the first.One bag at a time, she manhandled the luggage up the short flight of stairs to her door and dug out her key.Annie had given her an apple keychain.Symbolic.Maggie and her dad had argued over her apartment choice.Not only would she be living solo for the first time, but shed be doing it in a big city.One where she knew only a handful of peopleand none of them well.Hed wanted her in a building with a doorman; shed fallen in love with a first story flat without one.Theyd compromised on a second story sans doorman but one her mother assured him was in a safe neighborhood.Dragging her bags upstairs, Maggie questioned her wisdom in not holding out for a ground floor.It sure would have made this part of the move easier.But when she opened her door, any and all doubts fled.The sun poured through large windows and turned the wood floors into a river of shine.Her landlord had arranged for a cleaning crew to come in, and the place was spotless.Best of all, there in the center of her dining room table, a beautiful bouquet of spring flowers from her family greeted her.So like them to think of that.A note from Zandra rested beside it, explaining shed let the florist in and had stocked the fridge with wine, some food, and a few basics in case Maggie didnt feel like going out.She sighed and moved into the kitchen.Dark cherry cabinets, granite countertops, and stainless steel appliances.What more could a girl want?And thanks to Zandra, she had wine with which to toast her new home.She spun in a circle, then did a little happy dance right there in the middle of the kitchen.She spotted a container of Arabica beans by her new coffeemaker.Yes!She patted herself on the back for having chosen her assistant well, then gave Zandra a silent round of applause.A loaf of Italian bread lay on a cutting board on the counter.When she opened the fridge, Maggie clapped her hands.This was as good as Christmas.A bottle of red, one of white, a huge bunch of grapes, cheeses, several deli containersWow.Shed hit the jackpot.Zandra already deserved a raise.Spotting her favorite sparkling water, she poured a glass.Flying had dehydrated her.She kicked off her shoes, dropped onto the white leather sofa in the living room, and sipped her water.Maybe she wouldnt go anywhere tonight.Although the flight had been fairly short, the day had been long.Partly because they had to drive to Austin, partly from nerves, shed been up early.Shed already had the coffee brewing and the eggs frying when her mom and dad came downstairs.Then, of course, checking in and waiting for the flight.But the emotional toll had been the most draining.Despite the fact she wanted this desperately, when it came right down to it, it was hard to rip her roots out of the Texas soil and leave her family, her friends, her shop.And, yes, Brawley.By the time the plane had taxied from the gate, shed felt drained.Then theyd landed, and shed had an incredible spurt of energy.When shed stepped out of the cab, shed truly believed she could take on the world.Right now, though, instead of a stroll around the block, shed settle for a meandering tour of her new apartment.Thank heavens it came furnished right down to silverware, linens, and coffeepot.The only thing required from her?The rent money.She had enough put away for the first few months.After that, she hoped her clothing line would cover the expenses.Standing in the center of the room, arms wrapped around herself in glee, she thought how different this sleek, newly remodeled house was from Popss or even her parents.It reminded her of Brawleys.Not the kitchen.He was pretty much stuck with what Dottie had there.But the furniture, the dcor.She liked it.Black and white with a pop of red in the accessories.The walls and ceilings had been painted a soft white, making them a great backdrop for the few pieces of art.Dragging one suitcase behind her, she moved to the back, to the bedrooms and bath.The fact it had a guest room had pushed this apartment from a maybe to a definite yes.When someone came to visit, they wouldnt have to sleep on the sofanor would she if she gave them her bed.The bath was sleek chrome and pristine white.The black and white floor and shower tiles added their own artistic touch, as did the black towels and the huge white vase.The total effect was something straight out of a decorators dream.And the bedroom.Her suitcase bumping at her heels, she stopped in the doorway and simply stared.Giving herself a quick pinch, she decided it was real.All of it.Tonight shed sleep in that incredible art deco bed with its plump pillows and duvetin New York.A horn blared outside her window and another answered it.So foreign to a Maverick Junction girl.While some might find it distracting, it sounded like music to her ears.When she woke tomorrow, shed brew coffee in that sleek coffeemaker, eat an egg and some cheese from one of the sleek white plates, and shower in that elegant bath.Then shed head downstairs, hail a taxi, and make her mark in the fashion industry.What more could she possibly want?Maybe a pet.A dog that she could walk or a cat that she wouldnt have to walk.It might be better to wait a bit on that, though, since shed be putting in long days for quite some time.Would it be fair to an animal if she brought it home, then left it for hours and hours at a time?Her phone pinged.An incoming message.The instant he hit send, Brawley regretted it.He needed to let Maggie settle in and get her feet under her.But he hadnt been able to resist.Jesse, Jonah, and Josh had been so damned earnest, and hed caught them in an upswing, all three of them, like a trio of synchronized swimmers or dancers.Hed stopped and had lunch on the drive home from the airport.A spur of the moment whim had him turning off onto Tys lane.Hed used the excuse of checking up on Trouble, but, in all honesty, hed needed to touch base with a friend.He was feeling a little raw.Maggie had to go, deserved this chance, but that didnt make it hurt less.He hadnt made a dent in her feelings for him.He hadnt been forgiven.Walking away this morning, knowing shed board that plane, had been the toughest thing hed done since hed walked away from her all those years ago.Just like before, hed had no choice, no options.This was her shot, and he couldnt hold her back.Shed never forgive himor herself.When he pulled into the drive, three swim goggled boys and their dog greeted him.Following them to the barn, hed watched while they pummeled a block of wood Tyd put there.Unable to help himself, hed snapped the picture.Brawley stuck his phone in his hip pocket.Maggie could delete the photo if it didnt fit her new image.Brawley, Brawley, he chastised himself under his breath.Youve been the city dweller all these years, not her.Still Ty stepped out of the tack room.Hey, Brawley.What brings you out here?Somebody have a sick horse or cow?Nah.Ium He kicked at a clump of straw on the barn floor.I drove over to Austin today.Thought Id stop by and check out this mutt of yours.Unfortunately, the snakebite didnt seem to make him behave any better than ever, Ty said.If he chews up another shoe, Im afraid Sophies gonna ban him from the house.Cant say I blame her.You trained all these boys not to eat shoes.Cant you train Trouble?We didnt eat shoes!Jonah giggled.You sure about that?Brawley squinted at him.Yeah.Jesse wound himself around Brawleys leg.Kids dont eat shoes, just dogs.Kids eat dogs?Startled, Jesse shook his head.You said kids dont eat shoes, just dogs.Jesse let out an exasperated sigh.Just dogs eat shoes, Uncle Brawley, Josh said.Oh.Brawley took off his Stetson and wiped his brow.You had me scared there for a minute.He scooped Jonah off his feet and held him upside down.The other two stepped in to tickle their brother while he was helpless.As he set Jonah back on his feet, he noticed Tys frown.He gave one of the kids a tap on the butt.Why dont you run on up to the house?Ask Sophie if she might have a cold glass of sweet tea for one of the good guys.For who?Josh asked.For me.Kay.The three tore off across the yard, Trouble yapping at their heels.Whats wrong, Ty?Sophie wants a baby.Doesnt surprise me.She loves those boys, but its only natural to want one of her own.Id hoped to put it off a bit.She doesnt want to.Nope.And Annie and Cashs announcement last nightWell, it didnt help matters.It turns out she already knew.But this puts some extra pressure on me.So go for it, pal.Give your boys a baby to boss around.Ty let out a half laugh.Oh, yeah.Theyd do that well.But?Hell of a thing for a man to admit, Brawley, but Im afraid.Afraid?Then it hit him.What an idiot.Of course Tyd be scared.Hed lost his first wife right after shed had the boys.Its different this time, Ty.Totally different.Sophies healthy.Theres nothing wrong with her heart.I know that.Here.Ty tapped a finger to his forehead.But here?He pounded a fist over his heart.Scares the bejesus out of me.Only natural youd feel that way.The front door slammed, and both men watched as Sophie, wearing a short dress the color of saddle leather, stepped onto the porch.She held up a tray.This is as far as I go.You guys get yourselves up here.Yes, maam, Ty called out.Turning to Brawley, he said, I couldnt stand to lose her.It would kill me.Understood.I think, though, what youre gonna lose is this battle.He slung an arm over his friends shoulders.My guess is that Sophie can talk you into just about anything.Youve got that right, pal.She turns those big brown eyes on me, and Im lost.Well, then, step up and do your duty.And while youre at it, you might as well have a little fun.They stepped onto the porch laughing.Sophie quirked her brow.Whats going on?Not a thing.Ty leaned close and planted a whopper of a kiss on her.Youd think the two of you were newlyweds, Brawley muttered.Yes, you would, wouldnt you?Sophie kissed Brawleys cheek.Kind of stingy.But I have sweet tea.She handed him a glass.So you never did say what you were doing in Austin this morning.Ty dropped onto the porch swing.Austin?Maggie flew out of there this morning.Sophies eyes grew misty.Did you take her?No.Her folks did.Heat rushed over him.He felt stupid.Like a teenager caught drawing hearts around his girls name in study hall.You went to see her off?Ty asked.Brawley nodded.But I dont want to talk about it.Okay.Hows business at the clinic?Busy.Very busy.I honestly dont know how Doc Gibson hung on as long as he did.Glad he made it to Bubbas last night, Ty said.Me, too.He must be lonely all by himself in that huge house now that his wife is gone, Sophie said.Tys glance flew to Brawley as if to say, See what Im talking about?What Id face if something happened to this woman?Im sure he is, Brawley said easily.He and Meredith had fifty four happy years together.Hes got a lot of memories and two rambunctious dogs to keep him company.A shame they never had any children.Sophie took a sip of tea, her eyes meeting Tys over the rim of the glass.Brawley swore he could hear the groan Ty bit back.Oh, yeah, his friend would lose this battle.He might as well hoist the white flag of surrender and make the most of it.He almost laughed, and probably would have if he didnt understand all too well that gut wrenching fear of losing the woman you love.Ty had done that once.Now Brawley had, too.When Maggie had stepped on that plane today, shed written the end to anything they might have had.Hell, that wasnt true.Hed done that himself.The fire had been banked, though, not extinguished.Hed thought with enough time and patience, he could rekindle it.Hed thought wrong.The topic of their conversation turned to the softball team Tys boys played on, the one Ty coached.We could use more help if you have any free time, Ty said.I might consider that.Im gonna need something to do with myself.The nights are a heck of a lot quieter here in Maverick Junction than Ive been used to.Brawley sat on the porch shooting the breeze with his friends, watching the kids roll around in the grass.Hed bet the ranch that within a year they had another to join the boys.Sophied get her way on this.And Annie and Cash already had one on the way.He finished his tea and set the glass on the pretty little tray.Time to go.He stood.Thanks for the refreshments, Sophie.You dont do bad for a Chicago transplant.Gee, thanks a lot.Hey, thats high praise.He thumbed back his hat.Youve got a nice place here, Ty.I think maybe its time I bought some land.Built myself a permanent home.Halfway down the stairs, he turned back.You two enjoy yourselves.Godll get you for that, Ty said.Brawley laughed at Sophies quizzical expression, then high fived each of the boys as he passed them.As he drove away, he glanced in his rearview mirror.Ty had had it tough, no doubt about it.But now?Pretty sweet deal.His mind caught on the idea of him and Maggie, and he wondered about the kids they might have made if things had been different.Eighteen  Talk about smug!Maggie stood in awe of herself.Shed actually managed the subway this morning.Up at the crack of dawn, unable to sleep another minute from the excitement of waking in her own Upper East Side apartment, shed showered, done her hair and makeup, and dressed carefully.Shed made the slim, long sleeve dress especially for today and hoped it hit the right note with its dark brown print paired with soft leather, high heeled ankle boots.Authoritative, yet friendly.But not too friendly.Oh, geez.From smug to doubting Thomas in three seconds flat.That had to be some kind of a record.No doubt Owen Cook, her angel investor, would drop by today.Annie had offered her seed money to get her line started, but Maggied been hesitant to mix friends and money.So when Owen, a business acquaintance of Annies father, offered to back her, shed jumped at it.Owen had already invested a lot of money in her and her designs, covering the entire cost of her upcoming show.Even if he was as rich as Donald Trump, as a businessman he must have some concerns about rolling the dice on such a total unknown.Hed want to check out her new line and, when he showed up, she wanted to mirror an up and coming designer, not a small town wannabe.The fact that the show would be an off season one raised the stakes.Made her worry no one would even attend.As she exited the subway, she stepped to the side and let others, in their mad rush to make it to work, pass by.Then she simply stood taking in the sights.An army of taxis and cars flew by, horns honking, brakes screeching.Buses belched black smoke and stopped to disgorge passengers while others in a queue hurried to get on.Bicycles and their riders darted in and out of traffic.People of all shapes, sizes, and ages hurried past.A pizza shop on the corner offered its fare for a dollar a slice.Starbucks, in the middle of the block, was doing a booming business, the line stretching onto the sidewalk.Vendors sold coffee and bagels from carts.And towering above it all were the buildings, magnificent towers of stone, steel, and glass.She rubbed her hands together in glee.She was really here.And one short block away, the space where magic would happen awaited.Another cup of coffee called to her, but, not wanting to be late, she bypassed Starbucks with a sorrowful glance through the window at the women in their chic outfits, the men in their suits and ties.Less than twenty four hours ago shed been in the Austin airport, surrounded by jeans, cowboy hats, and Stetsonsmen and women.What a difference a day made.If she wanted coffee in Lone Tree, shed stop by Ollies.Here?She had so many choices her head swam.Would she ever get used to it?she wondered.Ever take all this for granted?She seriously hoped not.Her feet kept moving, traveling the block to her building.Her building!Oh, gosh.Well, her space in the building, anyway.She laid a hand over her heart, felt it practically jump from her chest.With one last swipe over the skirt of her dress, a deep breath, and a prayer, she walked through the door.Miss Sullivan.Maggie grinned.The security guard in the reception area remembered her.Hello, Orlando.You here to finish that new collection?I sure am.Do you have your nametag, or should I print you a new one?Oh, sorry.Yes, I have it.Belatedly, she dug through her purse till she found the tag and clipped it to the neck of her dress.You can go right on up.Thanks.She headed to the bank of elevators and pressed ten.Inside, she watched the numbers count off as the car zipped skyward.When the doors opened, Zandra waited there for her, coffee in hand.She held the cup out to Maggie.Here you go.Thought you might need this.For me?You see any other big name designer here?Maggie made a production of scanning the room.I dont see any big name designer.Period.Zandra grinned and held out the coffee again.Maggie accepted it gratefully and took a sip.Oh, yes.This more than made up for the coffee she hadnt stopped to buy.At the same time, it seemed strange, awkward almost, to have someone wait on her.Welcome to New York, Maggie.Thank you, Zandra.She held up her coffee.
