Her name is Julie Montgomery and shes eight months pregnant.Shes been missing from her home for the past week.Anyone with any information should call the TIPS hotline.She gave the appropriate number and then they cut away to the weatherman.Jane sat in stunned silence.Julie.Her name was Julie Montgomery and she had concerned family members looking for her.She rolled the name again and again through her mind.She wasnt sure whether to laugh or cry.It suits you, Lucas said softly.Julie is a nice name.She turned to look at him.What happens now?I guess I make a phone call.He pulled his cell phone from his pocket.You have people who care about you, Julie.Its time you returned to them.Even though she knew he was right, she was surprised that she didnt feel more relief at the knowledge that she was on her way homewherever that might be.Are you calling the TIPS hotline?she asked.No, Im calling Wendall.I want to get the name of the people who reported you missing.Before I turn you over to just anyone, I want them vetted.We need to make sure theyre really who they claim to be.As he stood and punched in numbers on his phone, she thought about what hed just said.It hadnt occurred to her that it was possible the people who were after her might pose as concerned family members.She trusted Lucas to see that she wasnt in danger, that the people who were looking for her had only love and concern for her well being in their hearts.It was impossible for her to glean any information from Lucass end of his conversation with Wendall Kincaid.Lucas listened more than talked initially, then spent several minutes telling Wendall about how hed stumbled upon her and her bout of amnesia.It seemed to take forever before the men hung up.Lucas set his phone on the coffee table and turned to look at her.You were reported missing by a Robert Montgomery, who identified himself as your brother in law.My brother in law?Julie once again placed a hand on her pregnant stomach.She knew there was a man somewhere out there that shed married.Shed dreamed of him the night after shed made love to Lucas.She just hadnt told Lucas about that particular memory.Did he say anything about my husband?The last word seemed to catch on her tongue.She had a husband.So why had her brother in law reported her missing instead of her husband?Wendall only had sketchy information and Robert Mongomerys phone number.Maybe your husband is out of town or in the military.Ill call Robert and set up an initial meeting with him for tomorrow morning.Ill have Troy or Micah sit with you in a car.If Montgomery doesnt come with proof of his relationship to you, then you wont be meeting him at all.Im not sure why Im so crazy nervous, she said with a small laugh.This is what weve been waiting for and I know I should be happy, but to be honest, Im scared.He reached out and took her hand in his.Thats natural.Even though these people are probably loving relatives, you have no memory of them.We know that there are people after you for some reason or another.Its only normal that youd feel apprehensive.She squeezed his hand and leaned against him.She closed her eyes as she drew in the familiar scent of him.He smelled like safety, like passion and home.A lump crept into her throat and again she felt the burn of tears at her eyes.I wont see you again after tomorrow, will I?she asked softly.Im sure well run into each other sooner or later, he replied.They both knew it was a lie, and she loved him even more for pretending that they might maintain some sort of relationship once this was all over.They remained seated on the sofa for a long time, not speaking, just being with each other.He finally stood and grabbed his cell phone from the coffee table.First Im going to call Micah and have him do some digging into Robert Montgomerys life.Then Im going to make arrangements for the meeting in the morning, he said.You might as well go on to bed.Get a good nights sleep.He smiled, but the gesture didnt reach the darkness in his eyes.Just think, by this time tomorrow night youll be back where you belong.She forced a smile to her lips as she stood.Good night, Lucas, she said.What she couldnt say to him was that she felt in her heartin her soulthat she belonged with him.As she headed down the hallway to her bedroom, the tears shed fought back for the last several minutes began to fall.She should be deliriously happy.She finally knew her name, and tomorrow shed be reunited with family members, but all she could think about was that after tomorrow shed never see Lucas again.Pregnesia Chapter TenMicah and Troy were at the safe house at nine the next morning.They all gathered around the table to see what information Micah had managed to dig up on Robert Montgomery.Lucas couldnt help but notice that Janes hand trembled slightly as she poured herself a cup of coffee.Julie, he mentally amended.Her name was Julie and he wished there were some way for him to take away her obvious anxiety.She looked particularly pretty with her hair falling in soft waves around her shoulders and her cheeks flushed with color.She wore the blue blouse hed picked out for her at the store, and it made her eyes pop.If all went well hed be back in his own apartment tonight and Julie Montgomery would only be a fond memory.He tried to summon the joy hed expected to feel at the idea of getting his life back, but found it curiously absent.So, what did you find out about Robert Montgomery?he asked Micah, determined to focus on the matter at hand and not on matters of his heart.Hes a forty four year old businessman who owns a lucrative gift shop on Oak Street.Hes been married for ten years to a woman named Martha.They live in a small home off North Maple Street.No children, no criminal record for either of them.On paper they look like good, upstanding citizens.He unfolded a sheet of paper and laid it on the table in front of Julie.Look familiar?Lucas could see that it was a copy of a drivers license for Robert Montgomery.The photo depicted a burly man with sandy colored hair and blue eyes that seemed to jump right off the page.She studied the photo for a long moment, then shook her head.No, she replied.He doesnt look familiar at all, but that doesnt mean anything.I do have amnesia, she added drily.Now you want to hear what I dug up about you?Micah asked.She sat back in her chair in obvious surprise.All right.She shoved a strand of hair behind her ear with a shaky hand.Youre thirty years old and you worked as an elementary school teacher until two years ago when you married David Montgomery, Roberts younger brother.He paused a moment as if to give her time to digest the information.Third grade, she said with a touch of surprise in her voice.She paused a moment, then nodded and smiled.Yes, I taught third grade.The smile wavered as she continued to look at Micah.Wheres my husband?Dead.Im sorry, Julie.Your husband was killed almost eight months ago during a mugging, Micah said softly.Lucass heart fell at this bit of information.So, there was no loving husband for her to return to.She was alone just as shed felt she was despite having no real memories.She sighed and nodded once again as her hands lowered to her stomach.Somehow I knew it.She turned to look at Lucas.I told you I thought I had been alone before all this happened.You own a home near Robert and Marthas house, Micah continued.But after your husbands death you apparently moved in with them and put the house up for sale.Micah leaned back in his chair.Thats all I could get in the short amount of time I had.At least I know more now than I did when I woke up this morning.Thank you, she said.So, how are you going to work this?Troy asked.Lucas looked at his watch.In thirty minutes Im meeting Robert and his wife at the Calico Caf.I told him last night on the phone to bring proof of his relationship to Julie, pictures and documents or whatever he had.I explained to him that she was having some memory problems.Id like you and Micah to stay with Julie in one of your cars until I feel comfortable that its okay for her to enter the restaurant.Then Ill call one of you on your cell and you can bring her in to meet her family.He turned to gaze at Julie.Her anxiety was through the roof.Her lower lip trembled slightly and he wanted nothing more than to cover it with his own, hold her until her trembling halted.Its going to be okay, Julie.Its time for you to be with people who care about you, people who will watch over you.He hesitated a moment, then added, If you feel alarmed, then you dont have to go with them.Well bring you back here.He told himself that was the last thing he wanted, that it would be best for everyone involved if she returned to her rightful place.Thank you, she replied.Im sure its all going to work out just fine.She raised her chin a notch, and at that moment Lucas thought she was one of the bravest women he would ever know.Then we should get out of here, Troy said.They all rose from the table and went into the living room, where they grabbed their coats.Julie went down the hallway to the bedroom where shed been staying and returned a few seconds later with the small black overnight bag packed with everything she had.Im ready, she said with a lift of her chin despite the tremor in her voice.Minutes later they were on the road, Lucas in his rental car followed by the others in Micahs car.As he drove, Lucass mind filled with the sound of Julies laughter, the pleasure of morning coffee with her bright smile across from him at the table.The taste of her filled his mouth, and the scent of her seemed to ride the air.A wave of sadness suffused him, shocking him with its heavy weight.He could have loved her if he was a loving kind of man.Which Im not, he reminded himself.He could never be the man she wanted, the man she needed.He reached up and touched the scar on the back of his neck to remind himself of where hed come from.She and her baby were much better off without him.Surely her extended family would take care of her, see that both she and the baby were happy and healthy.He had to believe that.And eventually shed find some special man to share her life with her, the kind of man she deserved.Lucas turned into the parking lot of the caf as Micah drove on by.He would park someplace up the street until Lucas called him to bring Julie.He found a parking space near the front door and got out of the car.The wind seemed colder, but it was also filled with the scent of bacon, eggs and strong coffee.As he entered, a quick glance at the diners told him that Montgomery hadnt arrived yet.He took a booth next to a window with a view of the parking lot and ordered a cup of coffee from the waitress.He might have ordered a full breakfast if his stomach hadnt been so tied in knots.When the coffee arrived he wrapped his fingers around the mug and told himself once again that this was a happy occasion.It was what theyd been seekingJulies identity and the place where she belonged.Hed only been sitting for about five minutes when he saw a beige sedan pull in and Robert Montgomery get out of the drivers side.An attractive woman with dark hair got out of the passenger side and together they headed toward the caf.This was it.The moment Lucas had wished for, the chance to get rid of Julie once and for all and get back to his own life.No more safe house, no more intimate breakfasts or back rubs that went too far.As Robert and Martha stepped inside, their gazes swept the area.Lucas raised a hand to motion them over as he stood.Lucas Washington?Robert had the deep, rich, booming voice of a radio personality.Lucas nodded and the two men shook hands.Robert introduced his wife and then they all sat back down in the booth.Robert placed a manila folder in front of him.Wheres Julie?Martha asked, her gaze darting around the room.I wanted to meet the two of you first, Lucas said.The waitress arrived at the table and both Robert and Martha ordered coffee.When the coffee was served, Lucas explained to them how hed found Julie and about her amnesia.Oh my goodness, Martha exclaimed when Lucas had finished his story.That poor girl.Shes all right?The baby is all right?Physically shes fine, but shes still struggling with some memory issues, Lucas replied.Which is why I asked you to bring proof of your relationship to her.Since she cant remember you, I want to make sure youre who you really say you are.Of course, Robert said.He opened the folder in front of him and handed Lucas a photo.It was a wedding picture.Julie was the bride, a handsome blond man was the groom and on either side of them were Robert and Martha.That was the day my brother married Julie, he said.We were thrilled that hed found such a lovely woman to share his life with, and we were eager to welcome her into our family.She was a beautiful bride, Lucas thought as he studied the picture.And a little over a year after this happy photo had been taken she had become a pregnant widow.He handed the photo back to Robert.Its been almost ten days.Why didnt you report her missing sooner?he asked.Micah had told him that according to the neighbors Julie was living in Martha and Roberts home.Why had it taken so long for them to realize she wasnt there?She told us she felt like she wanted some time alone, that she was going to stay at her house for a few days, Robert explained.We thought maybe she just needed some space.Our home isnt huge, and we were kind of on top of each other.He frowned.She doesnt remember any of this?No, Lucas replied.There was absolutely no reason for him not to trust the two people in front of him, but he couldnt explain the faint thrum of apprehension that worried him.Maybe it was nothing more than the fact that he hated the idea of Julie leaving.Or perhaps it was the knowledge that she had no husband, no father for the baby she carried.This was definitely more difficult than hed thought it would be.He hadnt expected that handing her over and telling her goodbye would feel like a loss.JULIE NEARLY CAME UNGLUED when Micahs cell phone rang.The last thirty minutes had been the most agonizing she thought shed ever spend.She leaned over the back of the front seat as Micah answered.When he clicked off, he looked at her in the rearview mirror.Buckle up, its a go.So, Robert Montgomery had passed the Lucas test and she was about to be reintroduced to family members whom shed been close to before whatever event had stolen her memories.She leaned back and fastened her seat belt as Micah pulled away from the curb where they had been parked and headed toward the caf.You okay?Troy asked.Nervous, but okay, she replied.Her heart felt as if it might pound right out of her chest and the baby did a sudden somersault as if sensing her anxiety.You know Lucas would never put you in a dangerous situation.Both Micah and I can tell that he cares about you.Troys words created a ring of pain around her heart.He might care about her, but not enough to want to be a part of her life.Once her picture had appeared on the evening news hed certainly wasted no time arranging to get rid of her.She frowned.That wasnt fair.Lucas believed he was doing what was best for her, and even though it pained her, she knew she had to somehow push him out of her heart.As Micah pulled up in front of the caf, Troy got out to escort her inside.She grabbed her overnight bag from the seat next to her in one hand and grabbed his arm with the other.She was so nervous her legs felt wobbly beneath her.Maybe shed take one look at Robert and Martha and all her memories would instantly return.She wanted that.Even though theyd found out her name and knew bits and pieces of her life, she wanted, needed her memories back.As they entered the caf she immediately spied Lucas.Martha Montgomery rose as Julie approached the booth, and when Julie got close enough the older woman pulled her into a hug.Oh, Julie, dear.Weve been worried sick about you, she exclaimed.Julie held herself stiffly in the strangers arms, but as the hug continued she felt herself begin to relax.They werent strangersthey were family, she reminded herself.As Martha released her, Julie slid into the booth next to Lucas, surprised to discover that Troy had disappeared.Julie, honey, we know this is difficult for you, Robert said.Lucas has explained about your memory issues.But Im sure once we get you home, youll be just fine.The babys crib is all set up and were eager to get you settled back in where you belong.Before that happens, theres something you should know, Lucas said.Somebody tried to grab Julie and shove her in the back of a van at the store the other day.You have any clue why that might have happened?Martha and Robert exchanged pointed glances as Julie felt a new tension coil in her stomach.My brother, God rest his soul, was a good, but troubled man, Robert said.He had a weakness for drugs and gambling.At the time of his death, he owed money to people who dont easily overlook debts.He turned his attention from Lucas to Julie.Part of the reason we had you move in with us was that you had been receiving threatening phone calls from these people.I guess they got tired of making phone calls and decided to get more aggressive.Julie looked down at the table as she tried to process this new information.Her husband had been a drug abuser and a gambler?She could only guess that the marriage hadnt been a happy one.Was that why shed forgotten it, forgotten David?The problem, Robert continued, is that Julie doesnt have any money.Another reason we decided to move her in with us was so we could sell her house and get her out from under that payment.Our plan was for her to live with us until the baby was born, and then she could go back to teaching and get on her feet.There was no life insurance policy on her husband?Lucas asked.Robert grimaced.My brother cashed it in months before his death.He left Julie nothing.Why dont we order some breakfast and chitchat a bit about more pleasant things?Martha suggested.Julie was grateful for the suggestion.Hopefully it would give her a little more time to feel comfortable with the people who intended to take her home with them.Lucas motioned for the waitress and they all ordered.While they ate, Robert and Martha told her a little more about her life with them.With each moment that passed, a weary acceptance filled Julie.Robert and Martha appeared to be kind, well meaning people.There was no reason for her not to leave with them.Except that she didnt want to leave the man seated next to her.Lucas was quiet during the meal, as if hed already disconnected from the situation, from her.Love me, her heart wanted to plead.Ask me to stay with you.Dont send me away with people I dont remember.Dont send me away at all.But all too quickly they had finished eating and it was time for her to leave.There was nothing to stop her from going with them.Theyd had the documentation to prove that they were who they claimed to be, and Julie knew it was time for her to get back to whatever life shed forgotten.As they reached the sidewalk outside, Robert and Martha started toward their car as Lucas grabbed Julies arm.Shell be right there, he said, indicating they should go on.She looked up at him, wishing for things he couldnt give, yearning for an ending different than the one she was getting.They seem like really nice people, she finally said.He nodded, his gaze intent on her, and for just a moment she thought she saw something wonderful in the depths of his eyes, something warm and caring, something that looked like love.Youre going to be just fine, Julie.He said the words forcefully, as if trying to convince himself as well as her.He reached up and tenderly tucked a strand of her hair behind her ears, then stepped back from her.So I guess this is goodbye.Her throat grew thick with emotion.She finally felt free to say the words that burned in her heart.His strong jaw clenched and his eyes darkened.I know through this whole thing Ive been your lifeline, but once you get your memories back youll realize what you feel for me is nothing more than gratitude.Was he right?Did she feel so strongly about him because she was lost in a sea of the unknown?Was the love she felt for him nothing more than gratitude masquerading as something deeper?Julie, I told you not to want anything from me, that Im not cut out to be a husband or a father.I know.I just dont understand why youd say that about yourself.You have all the qualities it takes to be a wonderful husband and father.She wanted to touch him, but his eyes grew even darker and he took another step back from her.You have my cell phone number if you need anything.Goodbye, Julie.He shoved his hands in his coat pockets, a distinct dismissal of her, of any hopes she might have had to the contrary.Goodbye, Lucas, she replied.She tightened her grip on her overnight bag, then turned and headed toward Martha and Roberts car.Her heart sat like a heavy boulder in her chest.Robert opened the back door of his car with a reassuring smile and she slid in.As he pulled out of the parking lot, she turned and gazed back at Lucas, who hadnt moved from his position on the sidewalk.Her last impression of him was that he looked as alone as she felt, and that somehow this was wrong, all wrong.Im sure youre exhausted from all this drama, Martha said.All of this cant be good for the baby.Were going to make sure you get plenty of rest and healthy meals.Julie offered her a weak smile.I am tired, she admitted.But not from anything other than the difficulty in telling Lucas goodbye.She stared out the window and watched the passing scenery, her thoughts still on the man shed just left.There was no way she believed that her feelings for him were mere gratitude.She knew what she felt in her heart, and it was love.Are you warm enough back there?Roberts voice pulled her from her thoughts.She met his piercing blue gaze in the rearview mirror.Im fine, she assured him.Fine.Everyone seemed to be using that word a lot when it came to her and her future.Youre going to be just fine, Lucas had told her.But she didnt feel as if shed ever be completely fine again.She sat up straighter and frowned as she noticed they were driving north.She could have sworn Robert and Martha lived south of the caf where they had met.Are we going home?she asked, a strange feeling of dread welling up inside her.Were taking you right where you belong, dear, Martha said.Julies sense of dread grew bigger, a faint alarm ringing in the back of her head.Then she saw it just ahead of themthe Church of Enlightenment.Even though she couldnt remember coming here, didnt recognize it from memory, she knew what it was.What are we doing here?she asked.She unfastened her seat belt as Robert pulled the car up to the gate that led into the inner compound.He clicked a remote button on his dash and the gate opened.At the same time Julie tried to open the back car door, somehow knowing that she needed to escape.But the door wouldnt open.Panic welled up inside her.Why was she locked in like a prisoner?Why were they bringing her here?Oh God, something was wrong.Something was terribly wrong.As Robert pulled through the gate and it clunked shut behind them, Julies memories came rushing back.And with them came the knowledge that she was in grave danger.Pregnesia Chapter ElevenLucas watched them pull out of the caf parking lot as his heart twisted in a way hed never felt before.She was better off without him.Robert and Martha Montgomery seemed like fine people, and eventually Julie would find another man, one who would be a great husband and a terrific father.She was better off without him, and he was better off without her.Even as he told himself this, he hurried to his car and got in, driven by an impulse he didnt understand.He wanted to see the house where shed live, the place where shed bring her baby after he was born and get on with her life.He drove several car lengths behind them, not wanting her to see him.He didnt want her to think that he was coming after her, that hed changed his mind and wanted to take her home with him.It didnt take long for him to be confused by the direction they were traveling, and with his confusion came a spark of concern.The farther north they drove, the more concern Lucas felt, and when the Church of Enlightenment came into view, the concern transformed to a screaming alarm.He stepped on the gas in an effort to catch up to them, but before he could, their car disappeared behind the security gates.He braked and stared at the seemingly impenetrable gate that surrounded the buildings within.Why had they brought her here?During their conversation nobody had mentioned the church.Julie had been terrified by the symbol of the all seeing eye that the church used as its emblem.Why would they have brought her here?What did theywhat did Julie have to do with the church?He ran the conversation theyd shared over breakfast through his head again and again, seeking something hed missed, a clue hed somehow overlooked.In retrospect the only thing that sounded odd was the idea that goons would be after Julie because of her husbands drug and gambling debts.Julie had no money.The goons would have nothing to gain by going after her, and they sure wouldnt try to grab her in the middle of the day in a busy parking lot.She was in trouble.Hed handed her right over to danger.He slammed the steering wheel with the palms of his hands, then grabbed his cell phone from his pocket and called Chief Kincaid.
