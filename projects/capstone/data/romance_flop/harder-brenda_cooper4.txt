I left Silt six weeks ago.Wests been back in Putnam fifteen days.Every time I see him, it gets a little stronger.The first time I saw West after he came back, he was outside the art building, and I was walking with Bridget to my seminar.A clutch of smokers gathered by the door, West off to the side by himself, blowing a white cloud into the air.He didnt greet me.I knew to expect it.Hed done it to Krishna already.Hes doing it to everyone.West works and goes to class and stands off by himself, because thats how he wants it.I spot him out windows, passing by the giant phallic sculpture at the center of our campus.I see him in the library at the circulation desk, waiting to be helped.I go out for groceries and discover the shape of his head, the curve of his shoulder, as he holds a package of cold ground beef in his hands by the butchers counter and studies the label instead of turning around to say hi to me.When I close my eyes, theres his defiant, arrogant face as he opens the door of the truck after he finished eating Mrs.Tomlinsons pussy.He wipes his mouth, even though he never did that.He tilts up his chin and says, How about that, Caroline?Am I good enough for you now?Still want to rescue me?Still think you can love me?Huh?When I sit on the bed in my rented room and look out at the alley behind the house, an apple core three feet from the garbage can, I see West resting his forehead against the steering wheel of Bos truck, shuddering by the side of the road.None of what I feel is as simple as anger or betrayal or disgust, because theres always this other thing.The thing that makes me do a U turn when I spot his truck.The thing that pulls me out of my car when he emerges from the store with a carton of cigarettes, free arm swinging, keys glinting in the bright light of this sunny September day.I can see how angry he is from twenty feet away.He can be as angry as he needs to be, and Ill still feel like this whenever he comes near.I cant help it.He stops when he spots me.I dont wave or speak or beckon to him.All I do is watch.Witness him.You exist.I exist.Here we are.He gets in his car and drives off toward campus, and I track his progress until he turns the corner.Im smiling for no reason.I just feel so alive.Some things cant be unseen once youve seen them.This is what Im thinking the next morning, standing stock still on the threshold of our kitchen, clutching a water bottle in my hand and transfixed by the unexpected sight of Bridget and Krishna making out.Its seven thirty in the morning.I was, prior to this moment, barely awake.Now I am so awake.Awake enough to notice a lot of things other than the obvious thing, which is my teeny little freckled redhead best friend tongue wrestling with the resident campus manwhore.Like, I notice that theyre both in their running clothes, and they smell ripe.After two years of rooming with Bridget, who runs track, Im more than used to the odor of warm armpits and high tech fabric, but this time its coming off both of them together.Their mouths are making this wet smacking sort of noise.Krishna is owning Bridget.One hand on the back of her head, one right above her ass, bending her backward over the counter owning her.His hair and shoulders are wet.Her thighs.Their arms.Rain.Its raining out there.The rain is drumming against the house, and Bridget is kind ofsqueaking?Shes making a noise thats so obviously compliant that it makes me think of animals, mating animalslike, hamsters, maybe, which I wish it didnt because I once actually saw hamsters mating and it isnt something I want to see again, or think about, and Jesus, neither is this.And yet I cant move.I cant move, because this isnt a first kiss or a fourth kiss or an eighth kiss.They have done this many, many times.This has been happening.When?When did this start happening?Krishnas hand is sliding beneath Bridgets back, rucking up her shirt, his skin so dark against hers, and my brain is just hammering at me, when, when, when?Last school year?Over the summer, when Bridget took more than one long weekend to visit Krishna in Chicago for reasons that now seem flimsy as tissue paper?As flimsy as her sports bra, which presents no obvious barrier to Krishnas hand.Its working its way around to the front.Its going to get there, and no.No.This is wrong.Its wrong in the way things are wrong when you dont expect them, but its wrong in other ways, too, that I cant even get a handle on because they hit me in one big mass, a cumulous cloud of emotions, foggy and cold, impossible to sift through, especially because it keeps happening.His hands are over her breasts now.Theyre moving, theyre tweaking, and she likes it.So much.I have to clear my throat against the possibility that Bridgets hamster noises will actually kill me.Bridget leaps away from Krishna.Her hand flies to her throat.You scared me!I lift my water bottle hand, now frozen into a claw.I just wanted a drink.This is the worst thing to say, it turns out, because it makes them step farther apart, clearing a corridor to the sink that I have to walk through.I have to not look at Krishna so hard.And not hear the way theyre breathing.And not consider how wrong it is that none of us seems to have anything to say at this awkward moment to end all awkward moments.Bridget.Krishna.The two talkiest people in a whole universe of talkers, now totally silent.The water running into the bottle is louder than any running water has ever been.I can feel them looking at each other behind my back.I can feel the conversation theyre not having, the frantic exchange of messages through hands and eyes.I turn off the tap.Set my bottle in the sink.Pivot to face them and say, like its no big thing, So this is a surprise.Bridget is the color of beet juice.Its not what it looks like, she says.Because, you know, it looks like we were going to Its exactly what it looks like, Krishna interrupts.Its not, she insists.Carolines going to think we were sneaking around and we didnt want her to know, but thats We were sneaking around, Krishna says.We didnt want you to know.Bridget punches him in the arm.Stop it!Stop what?Telling the truth?No!Youre making it sound like werelike Imand its just not Not what?Not like that.Dirty.And sneaky.AndI dont know.Convenient housemate hookup.Bridgets expression is searching, earnest in a way thats painful for me to take in.Krishna aims his cant give a shit grin at her.Nothing wrong with a dirty, sneaky, convenient housemate hookup.Its ghastly.She stiffens.The flush drains out of her face.She gets smaller.Krishna claps her on the shoulder like theyre old army buddies.Ill leave you girls to it.I need to grab a shower.We listen to the stairs creak underneath his climbing feet.Oh my God, I say when hes traversing the hallway over our heads.Bridge.She shakes her head.Dont make me talk about it.I kind of think we should talk about it.Yeah, I know.I just She covers her face with her hands, and I wrap my arms around her, hoping thats the right thing.It feels like the right thing, even though Im having trouble switching gears from my own reactions to caring about hers.It gets easier when I realize shes shivering.How long has this been going on?I ask.I dont know if its going on.It looked like it was going on.Its complicated.I would have told you, but its so complicated, and I could never tell if we were on or off or neither, so I didnt know what to say.I still dont know what to say.At all.Can I say what it looks like?Ugh.No.You sure?Sometimes its good to hear what it looks like.It looks like Im in love with Krishna and hes just fucking me because Im around all the time, and hes going to break my heart and then pretend he doesnt care because hes a guy and thats what guys do, and meanwhile Ill be moaning about how he has hidden depths and you just dont understand, but youll know better because you think Krishnas only good to be friends with but not someone you can count on, and youve never really been able to like him as much since he let West get arrested, because youre hopelessly in love with West and youre always going to take his side in everything forever.Her hair drips on my neck.I give her a squeeze.Okay, I say.So at least you know what it looks like.I am fully aware, on every level you can possibly imagine, exactly what it looks like.And youre saying its not like that?Unfortunately, no.It is like that.Sometimes.Whats it like when its different?She inhales deeply.Bites her lip and casts her eyes at the ceiling, searching for words.Its like falling into She shakes her head.Its like A chill runs up my spine.Ive known Bridget for over two years.Ive never seen her at a loss for words.Bridge I cant describe it, she says with a shrug.But its good enough to be worth all this other crap, apparently, which I cant even tell you the epic amounts of crap Ive been dealing with.What he just did, walking out of the room like that?Thats nothing compared to what hes been dishing out every time he gets spooked, which is fucking constantly, and if we werent Constantly fucking?I interrupt.She hides her face behind her hands.Yes.God.Go on.If we werent constantly fucking, I would have so many bad things to say about him.You can say the bad things and also fuck him constantly.I know, but it feels so disloyal.I like him.You maybe love him?She hides her face against my shoulder.Dont say it.Its too stupid.I have the market cornered on stupid.When she looks at me again, her eyes are bright with tears, but shes smiling.You know what I used to think?Its awful.Youre going to think Im awful.Probably not.I used to think only stupid people made mistakes.Like, people who were too stupid to know what the right thing to do was, so they did the wrong thing, and I was smart enough to see all that stupidity coming, so I would never be like them.I thought my mom was stupid for not knowing my dad was having an affair, and my dad was stupid for having one.And, God, Im sorry that Im saying this, but I thought, after what Nate did You thought I was stupid?I blurt out.Kind of?I mean, not across the board, but about that one thing, yeah.Like, I thought Id never let a guy do that to me, and I couldnt see why you had unless youd just sort of stumbled into a pit of stupidity temporarily, and then stumbled back out.I cant believe you thought that.I know.But what Im starting to figure out with Krishna is that its possible to be smart and still do really stupid things?And know youre doing them the whole time, she says.Thats the worst part.It is, I say, nodding.Ive had this exact same thought.Oh my God, I am being so fucking stupid.I should be arrested for containing this much stupidity in one person.And then, like, God, hes hot, I love him, I am totally going to do this anyway.It sucks, she says.Donkey balls.Ginormous donkey balls.It sucks ginormous hairy donkey scrotums, I confirm.Hoovers them up.Deep throats them.While they take pictures and post them on the Internet, Bridget says.And go down on other women to drive you away.And tell you about all the women theyve fucked while theyre taking off your pants.He did not.He did too.What a vile excuse for a human being, I say.You should totally ditch him.And then were laughing, leaning into each other, holding on tight, and Im glad I saw her with Krish, even if it was kind of gross.Im glad I see West all over Putnam, even if hes living in his little bubble of isolation.It would be great if I had godlike powers to make the world less cruel.I could change everything.I could bend Wests life toward mine instead of away from it, make everything different so he never would have chosen to do what he did, never could have chosen it.I bet Bridget feels the same waylike shed change whatever went wrong in Krishnas life to fuck him up, and then hell stop jerking her around and admit they have something.But who would Krishna be if he werentwell, Krishna?And who would West be if I changed his whole life to make it so he never disappointed me?Not West.I dont want anyone but West.Id rather fuck up and have somethingsome messy undefinable not quite relationship that feels awful but also transcendent, electric, importantthan keep away from him and have nothing at all.Im going to figure out a way to get him back.Everyone can think Im stupid if they want to, and tell me I shouldnt, and say Ill regret it.Everyone can believe its a bad ideaeven me.Maybe it is a bad idea.I dont care.Im doing it anyway.My phone rings at the library that same afternoon, drawing nasty looks.Its four oclock, a quiet time for serious study, and I forgot to set it on vibrate.I fumble in my bag until I find it way down in the pocket where I dont usually put it, and by then its been ringing so long Im hot with embarrassment.I decline the call, a local number I dont recognize, and go back to my response paper.A minute later, the phone starts to vibrate in my pocket, and I feelI dont know.Weird.Weird like the hair is standing up on the back of my neck.Weird like when people say they just have a feeling.That dj vu thing.I accept the call, shutting my laptop and shoving it in my bag.Ms.PiaPia Piasecki, I say.This is Jeff Gorham.Im the counselor at Putnam Elementary, and I have Frankie Leavitt here needing a ride home.I havent been able to reach her brother.Ive got you listed as an emergency contact on the ride form, is that right?I have no idea.But as I push out the library door and into the overcast fall afternoon, I say, Uh, yeah.Did you try his cell?Frankie did.I hear a garbled voice on the other end of the line, and then the counselor again.Would you be able to swing by and pick her up?I glance at my watch.I have a meeting in an hour, but the elementary school isnt far.Sure.Ill be there in ten minutes.My car is parked on the east side of campus.I find myself rushing to get to it.Jogging, impatient, freaked out.Those wordsemergency contactset off some kind of alarm in the back of my brain.Plus, you know, the obvious thing.West.He must have put my name down on that form, but I bet he hated doing it.I bet hes going to hate this even more.When I pull up outside the school, Frankies sitting on the steps with a guy who looks young enough to be a Putnam student.I step out of the car, wave in her direction, and wait to see if theyre going to beckon me over.I dont know what kind of rules govern who gets to pick up a ten year old from a public school.I guess all Frankie has to do is tell him Im the one shes been waiting on, because in a second shes free.She walks to my car with her head down.When she gets in, her backpack hits the wheel well with a heavy thump.Sorry, she says, before weve even pulled away from the curb.I missed the bus.I didnt know Mr.Gorham would call you.Thats all right, I say.Where should I take you?Home, I guess.Which is ?She points straight ahead.That way.The whole drive feels unauthorized, like Im breaking some law.Guilty, too, because shes texted me a bunch of times since they got to town, but Ive been trying to disengage.Ill wait a day or two to reply, then respond in short, generic phrases.Afraid shell cling and Ill have to explain that her brother and I arewhatever we are.So you tried to call West?I ask.I told Mr.Gorham I did, but I didnt want to bug him at work.I thought I could just walk.Mr.Gorham said no.How far is the walk?I dont know, a few miles, I guess.You go left up here.After the turn, I study her surreptitiously.Her eyes are puffy as if shes been crying.Did you miss the bus?She shrugs, turning her face toward the window.I guess that means no, but she doesnt want to talk about it.You need anything to eat?A snack or something?Nah.Theres plenty at home.When will West get back?Around twelve thirty.At night?He works swing shift.What are his hours?Three thirty to twelve, mostly.Sometimes they run ten hour shifts and he works four thirty to two.And youre just by yourself at home every night?No.Hes got four days on, three days off.Youre too young to be alone that much.Frankies expression turns mulish.Go right here.We end up at a small white farmhouse in the country.Where most people would have grass, huge metal sculptures litter the dirt.Gravel has been laid down between them in a kind of path.Ive heard of this place.Laurie Collins, the guy with the womans name who makes all these sculptures, is a permanent visiting artist.Hes famous at Putnam because hes the one who made the giant metal phallus sculpture, but I think hes famous more generally, too.The college tour guides make a big deal out of him.Youre staying with Professor Collins?No, over the garage.She points to the side of it, where a wooden staircase leads up to a door.I pull to a stop.The farm seems like a nice enough place.Pleasant, perfectly safe.The farmhouse has cheerful yellow curtains and a bright blue door.But theres no traffic, nobody in sight.It must be so quiet in that apartment when shes alone.Thanks for the ride.She opens her door.Hold up.Frankie stops.Ive got a meeting soon, but maybe you want some company?You could come with me.Were just making posters for this march.The Student Government office has huge rolls of paper and giant markers, and we can decorate them however we want.And then after maybe we could grab dinner?Unless youve got homework.I do, she says, but if I get home early enough I can do it before bed.What time is bed?Nine oclock.So if I get you back by seven, that should be enough time?Yeah.Unless you dont want to hang out with a bunch of college students A muscle twitches in her jaw.She looks so much like her brother, it wrenches my heart.Ill come.Good.She drops back into the car.I make a three point turn in the driveway, and were off.The farther we get from the apartment, the better I feel about the decision Ive made.We go to my meeting, where she turns out to be surprisingly adept at making posters.I take her back to the house for dinner, introduce her to Bridget and Krishna in the kitchen, feed her some kind of curry thing that Krishna whipped up on a dare when Bridget bet him he didnt know how to cook a meal.The mood is lighthearted, which I guess means Krish and Bridget are on again.Bridget sends me a look that says, What do you think youre doing?I send her one back that means, Well talk later.Krishna teases Frankie until shes laughing so hard she falls out of the chair and makes her lip bleed.When it gets dark, I drive her back to the farm.The farmhouse is blazing with light, the shapes of people visible through the curtains.Shes talked all afternoon about the sculptor, Laurie, and his wife, Rikki, whos also an art professor.Frankie hangs out sometimes in Lauries shed while he works on his art.Its clear theyve got a bond going.West must know it.He must have arranged it so Frankie has these adults to go to.He wouldnt leave her unprotected and alone.Except that she obviously needed someone today, and she didnt call her brother.About the bus, I say on an impulse.You didnt miss it, right?You just didnt want to get on.Shes bent over in the seat, zipping her backpack.You dont have to tell me whats happening, I say, but if you want me to pick you up sometime, you can just text.Well hang out.Frankie lifts the pack onto her lap, compressing a strap in her hands.You mean it?Sure.I cant be, like, your personal chauffeur, but if youre having some kind of problem She toys with the door handle.I feel like a freak here.How come?The other kidsTheyre just different than the kids back home.I dont fit.Andtheres this kid on the bus.He looks at me.Says things.Mean things?She nods.About the way I look.Her body, I guess.Her breasts.Man, kids are mean.Did you try telling the bus driver?She wouldnt do anything.You cant know that.If I report it, hell say Im making it up, and shell take his side.Then hell turn it into a thing where I have a crush on him and Im just trying to get attention.I wrinkle my nose.We never moved to a new town, but I remember how kids who came to our school from outside the state might as well have arrived from another planet.They had different slang words, accented different syllables.Sometimes they had toys or games we didnt know about, or they wore a brand of jeans wed never seen before, and these contrasts seemed enormous.Did you talk to West about it?She shakes her head.Hes mad at me.What for?He just is.He acts mad all the time, but like he doesnt want me to know.Its my fault we had to move here.I thought you moved so he could come to school.She shakes her head again, but she doesnt say anything.I dont know what to tell her.The silence lasts half a minute.There arent any crickets chirping.The nights cool.Summers over.I look at her with her hand on the door handle, her hair in her eyes.This kid.The thing is, I love this kid.Not the way West does, but my own way, because shes so young and sweet.Because she tries so hard to be tough, and because her mouth and her stubborn jaw are the same as her brothers.I reach out to touch her arm.When you just cant, call me.Ill come get you.You dont have to.I want to.West wont like it.Thats his problem.If he doesnt like it, he can talk to me, okay?She smiles slightly.It was fun tonight.It was.Thanks.Youre welcome.The door slams behind her.I watch her climb the steps to the apartment, fish a key out of her backpack, go inside.I know shes right.West isnt going to like it.But I sit there watching her shut herself into her empty apartment, and the hair stands up on my forearms.Im so looking forward to it.Every time my phone buzzes after that night, I think it must be West.Usually, its Frankie.Frankie, wanting me to see the earrings she bought on a recent trip to Walmart.Frankie, wondering whether she should be Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz or Catwoman for Halloween.Frankie saying, hey whats up?Saying, theres no good pizza in this town.But its a week and a half before she texts me to ask if I can pick her up from school again.Im at the library.The vibration of the phone in front of my face wakes me up from a doze, and my cheek feels overwarm where I propped it in my hand.I wipe drool from the corner of my mouth, checking to see if anyones around to notice.Nope.Its a quiet Friday afternoon in October, a glorious fall day, and I guess most people have the sense to spend it outside.Sure, I text back.What time?Now.10 min.When I get to her school, shes sitting on a low concrete wall.The buses havent left yet, but I spot her right away because shes alone, her arms wrapped around her knees, her eyes on her feet.Shes wearing black leggings and a dark top.When she shoulders her backpack, I feel a little bit like crying at her bony knees and skinny calves, her breasts too big and too soft, this baby woman all alone.I wish I could scoop her up and shelter her from how mean life can be.Especially how mean it is to girls, smart girls, girls with boobs, girls with no boobs.I cant, so I take her shopping.Putnam hasnt got any decent stores to shop at, but we go to the Mattinglys outlet.Mattinglys makes athletic uniforms.Their outlet store is full of shiny polyester emblazoned with the names and logos of obscure high school sports teams.I buy her gigantic two dollar basketball shortsblack with yellow insetsand a matching shirt that says Prairieville Hornets.Then we hit the Salvation Army thrift store and try on all kinds of ridiculous stuffprom dresses, overalls, a sweater dress from before I was born, T shirts and low rise jeans that show our ass cracks.We go for burgers at the student union and run into Krishna, who hangs out with us for a while.Its a good afternoon for all of us, I think.A nice break from the routine.When I drive Frankie home, she says she wants me to come in and see her costume.I agree with indecent haste.The apartment isnt very big.Theres just the kitchen and a living room plus a short hall with two bedrooms and the bathroom in between.The kitchen is divided off from the living room by a half wall topped with those wooden spires you find on a banister.Theres a lot of dark wooden cabinets.The sink is empty, gleaming, and someones draped a neatly folded dishrag over the faucet.West.In the fridge, theres a plate with a homemade burrito on it and a sticky note bearing Wests handwriting.Microwave about 2 min.Salsa & sour cream after.Theres a carton of cigarettes in the freezer next to a half gallon of fudge ripple ice cream.I dish out two bowls when Frankie comes back, and then I make her get out her homework.The kitchen clock ticks.Ticks.Ticks.It seems to slow down with every passing minute.When I was thirteen or so, I used to babysit a lot, and I remember this sense of anticipationthis greediness for the moment I got the kids to bed and I could roam through the house, eat frosting from the plastic tub in the fridge, open and close closet doors, bedside table drawers, bathroom cabinets.Frankie keeps asking me to stay a little longer.Sure, I tell her.Just until youve taken your bath.Sure, Ill help you pick out an outfit for school tomorrow.Ill sit by your bed and talk for a few minutes.Ill rub your back until you fall asleep.Sure.Ill do that.And then shes snoring softly, and Im walking on tiptoe across the hallway to Wests bedroom.Theres a T shirt thrown carelessly onto the unmade bed.A stack of books on his deska different desk than he had last year, a bigger mattress, an ivy green comforter with huge pink roses that must have come with the other furnishings in this apartment because he would never buy such a thing.Condoms in the drawer by the bed.Lotion on top of the table, a box of tissues.In his closet, a half full basket of laundry, which I lift out in one big scoop and press to my face.Wests detergent.Wests scent overlaid with sawdust and sweat, musty dirty laundry smell.I run my finger along the line of shirts hung up in his closet, clothes Ive seen him wear, clothes Ive taken off him.I open every drawer, rummage under the bed, and I dont know what Im looking for until I find it at the bottom of a stack, tucked inside a manila folder.A note I left him one morning.A snapshot of the two of us that I liked enough to get it printed and give him a copyme and West at the bakery, goofing around, flour on his nose and on my cheekbone, light in our eyes.A printout of an email I sent him after he left Putnam.I love you, and Ill miss you, and I want everything good for you, West.Everything wonderful.I want you to be happy.I want you to be whole.Two hundred dollars in twenties, tucked inside a Christmas card.I close the folder and put it away.I stand in his dark bedroom feeling elated and guilty.The next thing I know, Im in the kitchen.I take the carton of cigarettes out of the freezer and methodically open every package and empty them out into a pile on the kitchen table.I break them open, roll them between my fingers, emptying the loose tobacco into a mound.I dont know why.I just do it.I do it and keep doing it, swallowing over the ache in my heart and the numb cold Im rolling between my fingers until its done and I cant take it back.Then I return to his room, dig out that note I wrote him, and put it on the table.At the bottom of the page, I write a new message.If you eat enough tobacco, its poisonous.Hell of a lot quicker than smoking them.I put a fork next to the pile Ive made, sweep all the empty papers and filters and cellophane wrappers into the garbage can that I find beneath the sink, and then look at the little scene Ive created.Im losing it.But I feel curiously detached from having to care about whats normal and what isnt.Curiously entitled to my behavior, my stalking, whatever displays of emotion I feel like directing at him.I dont know if what he did to me is what entitles me, or if its that folder in his bedroom.My name on Frankies school form.Every sweet moment that ever passed between us.Either way.I gather up my books, find the porch light, and flip it off before I let myself out.I sit on the top step beside the front door and look at the sky.Theres a wilderness of stars up there.I lay back and let myself wander through them until Im losteven more lost than I already was.I trace the shapes of those lights with my fingertip, looking for patterns, and I think about the first time West kissed me on the roof of the house where I grew up.How we went up there to look at the stars.How we were stoned, and I loved him so much, his mouth on mine, his body and his heat and his beautiful face.The tears that fall down my temples and soak into my hair are hot, but I dont brush them away.It feels good to cry.It feels good to be here, waiting for West in this forest of stars.When I hear his truck in the driveway Ill get up and go, seal myself inside my own car before I have to talk to him, because tonights not the night.Tonight, I made him something to find, and thats as far as Im going to push it.For now.Until he drives up, Ill be here, waiting for guidance.Waiting for a light to follow, for peace to help me find my way.On Monday morning, a few days after I killed Wests cigarettes, I walk to my seminar with Bridget.When we pass the art building, hes there, of course.Standing by himself.Smoking.Bridget is talking, telling me about a movie she went to see with Krishna over the weekend, but Im veering away from her.Im walking right up to West, plucking the cigarette from his fingers, and grinding it out in the bare dirt at his feet.His eyes look green next to the pale green glass of the art building, the white of his teeth when he smiles.Theres more where that came from, he says.His voice is so soft, I can feel it moving over my skin like the pads of his fingers, trailing over my nipples.I figured.I feel soft.My face, my eyes, my mouth.I want to press against him.Let his hard edges sink into me.Reshape me.Change me.Ill bounce back after hes gone.I always do.He shakes his head.Pulls out his pack of cigarettes and extracts another one.Taps it against the cellophane wrapper and lights it up.He blows smoke over the top of my head and says, Expensive habit to break.Me or the cigarettes?He squints as he inhales.You should stop it with Frankie.Maybe we should get together sometime, I suggest.Have a meal.Talk things over.You should stop it with that, too.With what?He points at me.Points at his chest.I guess Im supposed to be discouraged.This time, I take the cigarette from his lips.I put my mouth where his mouth was, and I inhale carefully, letting the taste of him move through me.Pulling West into my body, through the chambers of my heart.He watches me exhale.I drop this cigarette, too, and grind it out.Bridget touches my wrist and says were going to be late, were already late, but I dont stop watching West until we turn a corner and he disappears from sight.Hands in his back pockets.Elbows out to the sides.His smile fading as he watches me go.I start to notice music.Not like Im hearing music in my head, but like Im just now tuning in to the music thats already everywhere, all the time.The last week of classes before fall breakthe week after I destroyed Wests cigarettes, the week I pick Frankie up from school three times, the week I ace two midterms and set the curve on my Latin examI hear sad ballads at the coffee shop.I hear pop songs on the radio.I hear a low drone of sound that floats down the hall to my room from Krishnas.It draws me to his doorway, where I find Bridget sitting crossways on his bed, feet propped up on the backs of his thighs, book in her lap.Krishna lying on his stomach, a book open by his head, a chunky calculator resting by his left hand, his pencil scrawling over a notebook page making notations I cant understand.Hes tuned in to those numbers and symbols, but its the music that catches me.Krishna plays this album a lot.I never noticed before that all the songs are love songs.I go out for a run with Bridget, long sleeves and long tights on a cold morning as we jog in a rectangle around Putnams campus, turning left, left, always to the left.She runs slow for me, because Im not as good a runner as she is, and because my pace falters every time I hear some new lyric, a fresh tilt to a tune Ive never paid attention to.I find myself waving her ahead, Go on, Ill see you at home, because I need to listen hard, cupping my hands over my earbuds.Ive just discoveredyes.This one, too.Another love song.Angry love songs.Plaintive ones.Complaining ones, ecstatic ones, sexy moaning ones, cute ones, smug ones, turbulent bleeding aching disastrous ones.Everywhere I go.I stand by the side of the road on a cold morning, frost on the stalks in the ditch beside me, a crow on the telephone pole, a cloudless sky, listening to a woman pleading over a line of throbbing drums, Take me back, take me back, take me back, baby, take me back.At home, Krishnas music pulls me down the hall another time.No Bridget today.They argued about something after dinner, and I havent seen her since.You okay?he asks me.Im not sure what to tell him.Im in love.Sometimes it feels like a terminal condition.Killing stupidity.Dangerous to my well being.It makes me do dumb shit like fly to Oregon on a moments notice, and shred a hundred cigarettes to nothing.Krish and Bridget are in love.It makes them do dumb shit like lie to each other about how they feel, pretend not to feel it, fuck and touch and kiss and then run, run, run.Am I okay?Is love like this okay?It doesnt feel okay.It feels necessary.In the daytime I hear music, and I start to think that whatever is wrong with me might actually be whats wrong with everybody.I start to think it might be normal, because if its not, then what does it mean that all the songs are love songs?What does it mean that I hear them now, everywhere I go?Fall break is the last full week of October before Halloween.I spend a few days of it at home with my dad.Home is like a thrift store shoeI love the way it looks, but when I put it on, it feels stiff, creased in weird places.I can pretend it fits if I need it bad enough, but when Im honest with myself I know it never will.You okay?he asks.Everybody asks.The other morning I caught sight of myself in the mirror coming out of the shower.Im too thin, and I look like I havent slept through the night in about a year.I havent.Sure.Im fine.Its just that I feel some days like Im moving through liquid, and I have trouble sleeping.When I do sleep, I dream about burning alive.I dream about alien pregnancies.I dream about losing all my teeth, losing a baby I didnt know I had and searching all over campus for it, in every classroom, in the post office, under every table at the library.I sit in class and think about Wests arms, Wests hands, Wests smile.West.You seem kind of down, my dad says.Are you worried about the case?Nates attorney responded to our petition with across the board denial and a request for summary judgment.This was what we expected, and in the two days Ive been home, Dads told me no less than four times that theres no way the judge will go for it.We have a strong enough claim that the case will keep moving forward toward trial, gliding along on well greased wheels, until the money runs out or something dramatic happens to stop it.Im not worried about the case.I think hed be surprised to learn how little I actually think about it, except when he brings it up.I havent told him that Nate is living in a house two hundred feet from the one Im renting, or that I pass him on my way to class sometimes and we both look down and away, like strangers.Im okay, I tell him.You sure?Yeah.I picked up bananas and ice cream for dessert.Want to do the honors?Sure.I build banana splits: a scoop of each stripe of Neapolitan ice cream, a banana cut neatly in half, hot fudge, caramel, whipped cream, and nuts.An old ritual with my dad and me.As Im swirling whipped cream on top, he comes up beside me.Hey, Dad?I ask.Mmm hmm?Are we not going on vacation at Christmas because of the lawsuit?He sighs.We already talked about this.Money, he means.We talked about how I was supposed to handle my side and he was supposed to handle the money side, and I didnt need to worry about it.But why shouldnt I know what my revenge costs?You talked about it.I still dont understand why it has to be a secret.And if we cant afford it, then maybe it isnt worth it.Weve put so much into this already.We have to see it through.But as much as its already cost, its just going to get bigger, and I start thinking, you know, what are we doing this for?Because what Nate took from meI already cant get it back.Caroline, we talked about this.Weve talked about all of it, every possible facet, every conceivable approach.Weve more than made up for all the talking we didnt do in the months after Nate first posted the pictures.Weve talked until my jaw hurt.But dont you ever wonder if were making a mistake?I ask.No.Which, actually, yeah, I knew that already.My dads idea of a life philosophy is that you figure out what you want, and then you go after it.He believes in ambition and its relentless pursuit.No giving up.No compromising.He plucks a cherry from the jar on the counter.Dont give up on this, he says.Its going to be hard work, but itll be worth it.Maybe it is going to be worth it, but if the goal is to make Nate pay, my will might be starting to flag.I pass him on the sidewalk, and he seems untouchable.I pass him on the sidewalk, and I dont really care.I have other things on my mind.Frankie texts me on Wednesday afternoon of fall break week.I drive back to Putnam to pick her up from school.After she falls asleep that night, I sit out on the steps and wait for West.I hear him before I see him.The drone of an engine coming up the road, changing pitch and volume as he slows to make the turn.The rocks under his trucks wheels.Light cutting across the garage.I hear his boots on the steps, but I cant see his face.Its dark by the door, and his headlights messed with my night vision.I see the cherry red tip of his cigarette as he flicks it to the ground and grinds it out, then leans down to pick up the butt.When hes two steps below me, he stops.Is Frankie okay?Shes asleep.I stand up, a few feet separating us, dozens of cubic inches of darkness.I wanted to ask you, did she tell you shes having trouble on the bus?What kind of trouble?The kind of trouble girls have.Im not sure how else to put it or how much to tell him.I dont know a lot myselfjust that Frankie is increasingly reluctant to ride the bus home, and it seems pretty likely that the boy whos harassing her has stepped it up a notch or two.I cant decide if its for me or for Frankie to tell him that.Im wary of stepping between West and his sister.You should find out from her.He exhalesa soft whoosh of breath.I dont want you babysitting Frankie.Im not babysitting, I tell him.Were friends.You cant be friends with a ten year old.I can if youll let me.What if I wont?Why wouldnt you?Your sister deserves a friend, dont you think?Maybe a friend her age.What if she made one at school?She couldnt bring her friend over here.She couldnt go to the friends house for a playdate, not with your work schedule the way it is.Shes stuck hanging out alone for hours every day.Laurie keeps her company sometimes.Hes got to be fifty, though.Are you honestly saying its better for her to be with him than to do stuff with me?Begrudgingly, he says, No.Good.Because Im good for your sister, and I think you know it.West turns his head away to look out over the drive.My vision is better now, sharp enough to pick out the shape of his profile against the sky.His Adams apple.I can feel how tired he is.His tiredness is tangible, a statement his body makes to mine, and my arms want to reach out and touch him.My heavy head wants to find his shoulder.He used to feel this way after a Wednesday night shift at the bakerydead on his feet by the time we stumbled through the door to his apartment.Hed flop back on the bed still kicking his boots off, pull me against his side, nudge his face into my hair, and fall asleep in his clothes.There was something so trusting in it, so precious about being that close to him at his most vulnerable.He taps the toe of his boot against the step.I dont get what youre doing here.I think Im helping.I dont see why youd want to.Yeah, you do.I told you Id keep away from you, he says.I meant it.Is that really what you want?I hear him swallow.I wonder if his throat is as sticky as mine.If his heart is beating as fast.Yeah.Why?He doesnt answer for so long, I think he wont.But when he does, I wish he hadnt, because all he says is, What I did to you Like fingers snappingthose words ignite my anger in an instant.I already told you what I thought about what you did.Right, he says.And its because of what you said that I knew to keep away from you when I came back here.I never imagined you would come back here.It doesnt change anything.For fucks sake, West, it changes everything!It doesnt have to, though.What if I want it to?Caro He leans closer.I think hes going to touch me.All he has to do is reach out his handfind my waist or my shoulderbut he doesnt.He sighs.Descends a step.Its better this way.I dont believe that.For me, nothing is better.He crosses his arms.Itll get better.Youre so full of shit.Then hes quiet for a long time.He looks at me hard and long, so I look right back at him.I wonder if my face is any easier to read in the dark than his.I wonder if he misses me in his bed at night the way I miss him in mine.I dont understand whats in his head anymore.What he thinks hes doing and why he thinks hes doing it.He pushed me away as hard as he could, but now hes come back to Putnam, so why doesnt he come back to me?What I did to you That memory, so raw for me.I avoid thinking about it.It must be the same for him.But if its just that memory that keeps him from meif its his sense of honor, as if Im a princess in a tower and hes soiled my gown so thats the end of itfuck that.Fuck that with a tire iron, is my feeling.If hes going to deny himself what he wants, deny me what I want, theres nothing honorable in that.Its just pigheaded stubborn idiocy, and I wont stand for it.Which is the sort of thing its easy enough to think.But what do you do?West and I, we look at each other.Its heartbreaking.His pretty cheekbones, the scar in his eyebrow, his nose slightly off center, his ears too small, his mouth so wide and expressive and perfect.Its heartbreaking, knowing there was a time when I couldve taken him inside and put him to bed, given him some ease, given him something.But that time came and went, and this is the time were in now.The waste of it makes my throat tight.I feel guilty, he says.Like Im taking advantage of you when youre watching Frankie, only I cant stop taking advantage because I never fucking asked you to watch her, and when I tell you to quit, you dont.That must be tough for you.He laughs.Fuck you, Caro.Wish you would.Christ Jesus.His hand comes up to brush over his hair and hang up at the back of his neck.He exhales, rough, and I love it.Love getting under his skin.I love the confirmation and the hit of truth, lust spiking like nicotine through my blood.It feels like a game, although I know for West its dead serious.Its just that weve played this way before.The Caroline who played this game last year was scared and damaged and cautious, but Im not any of those things anymore.Im winning, and weve barely even started.Keep it to once or twice a week, all right?he says.Youve got your own shit to be taking care of.And I dont want you spending money on her.Leave me your receipts and Ill pay you back.Really?Were going to do accounting on this?Cut me some minuscule fucking piece of slack.Youre getting your way on everything else.Not hardly.Caroline.He recrosses his arms.West.I cross mine.What do you want me to say?he asks.Im going to be around.Youre going to have to deal with it.Deal with me.Stop pretending I dont exist or that everythings going to be fine if you say so.He makes me wait for his reply.It drags out of his chest, rumbling and low.Fine.I lean down to pick up my bag.My knees threaten to buckle.Im a cocktail of adrenaline and desire, my body dangerous and stupid.When I return to standing, hes still looking, and its worse.Better worse.Always better worse, with West.
