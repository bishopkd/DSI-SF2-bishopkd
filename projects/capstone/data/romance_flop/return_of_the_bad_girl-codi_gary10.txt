When I told him I wasnt going to spy for him anymore, he punched me, she said, waving her hand over her face.I think he liked hurting me.Carolines blood ran cold.He didnt ...he never ...Ellie seemed to pick up on what Caroline couldnt say.No, he never went that far.Carolines head was spinning.She had no doubt Kyle was capable of blackmail, but why would he do it?He wouldnt really jeopardize his cushy life or his freedom for a little wounded pride and petty revenge.Waitthis was Kyle.Of course he would.Because in his mind, he could never be caught.So why accuse Gabe?Because Kyle said he wouldnt stop until I agreed to press charges, Ellie said, her voice shaky with tears.And he just kept kicking me and screaming, and I wanted it to stop Ellies voice broke as she released a choked sob.Unable to resist her sisters pain, Caroline reached out and pulled her into her arms.Kyle.Everything toxic in her life and the people she cared about came back to him.That was about to change, though.Kyle couldnt get away with hurting her family.For trying to imprison Gabe and go after her father.Carolines body shook so hard with rage, she was afraid Ellie would think she was crying.She wasnt crying, though.She wasnt scared or cowed, not anymore.It was time for her to fight back, no matter what kind of shitstorm Kyle tried to rain down on her.This time, he was going to pay.Pulling away from her sister, she looked into Ellies red rimmed eyes.Okay, Ellie.You and I are going to the police station.Caroline, I cant, she said, her voice rising.Hell kill me.No, he wont, Ellie, Caroline said, standing up.Because were going to file charges and make sure he never gets out of prison.As it is, we have him on several cases of assault, extortion, rape But how?How are you going to prove what he did?Im going to have something for the police, Caroline said, standing up and heading for the door.Youre going to have to admit why Kyle was blackmailing you.I dont think I can do that!I could go to prison, Ellie said.Caroline resisted the urge to walk back and slap her sister.Reminding herself that Ellie was a victim and needed support, she said, Sometimes, part of growing up is facing your mistakes and coming clean.Yeah, I know, Ellie said, starting down the stairs.At least if it all comes out, I wont live the rest of my life with the what ifs hanging over my head, you know?I know exactly what you mean.Twenty Six Revenge is a dish best served cold ...and with a slice of ha ha, sucker!Miss Know It All   CAROLINE MADE ELLIE wait in the car as she walked up to her fathers door, but she didnt wait for Teresa to answer before walking inside.Caroline, what on earth ...Teresa started, coming around a corner.Sorry, Teresa, I just need something from my old room.But all your things are in storage!she called after her as Caroline climbed the stairs.Its okay, she said, going through the second door on the right.Teresa wasnt kiddingall of her stuff was gonebut she was a little surprised that her father had left the room bare.What should have been a room of nostalgia and warmth was nothing more than four white walls protecting an awful secret.Going into her closet, she knelt and pulled up the loose floorboard she had found as a child.Hidden beneath was a treasure box of keepsakes she hadnt wanted her sisters rifling through, and ...A plastic bag with a knee length dress, and her underwear from that long ago night.Her fathers voice came from behind.What do you have there, Caroline?She looked over her shoulder at him.He was standing in the middle of the room.Caroline stood up slowly, the keepsake box in one hand and the bag of clothes in the other.Just some trinkets, Caroline said.And in the bag?he said, pointing.This?This is leverage against Kyle, Caroline said.Did you know hes been blackmailing Ellie for months?Beating her?By the affronted look on his face, she guessed not.Well, were going to the police station.Ellie told the police yesterday that Gabe assaulted herKyle wouldnt stop hurting her until she agreed.Then he drove her there to make her statement.Why would he go to all the trouble to frame your boyfriend?I dont know, wounded pride?Caroline said, unsure herself.Gabe worked Kyle over a bit when he found out Kyle had come by the apartment and threatened me.Her father looked between her and the bag.When will you be going to the police?Now.Why?she asked, hating that she was still so suspicious of her own father.Because before its leaked to the media, I want to cut all ties with the man.Caroline laughed bitterly.Still looking out for the family name?Edward Willis hobbled forward.Leaning heavily on his cane, he placed his other hand on her shoulder.No.I dont want anyone thinking that I dont believe you.Relief swept through her, and she said, Ill be going as soon as I get the rest of the dirt you have on Kyle.Ill get it now, her father said, limping out of the room.For the first time in twelve years, her heart warmed toward her father, but she didnt have time to dwell on that.She had some business to take care of.BUT ELLIE, YOU came in here yesterday, crying that Gabe Moriarty was the man who hurt you.Sams slow uptake was getting on Carolines last nerve, and she snapped, Listen to what shes saying, Sam.Kyle Jenner beat and blackmailed her for months and when she refused to accuse Gabe, he beat her some more.To get him to stop, she accused Gabe, but now, shes recanting.Sam glared at Caroline and then leaned in to whisper to Ellie, You can tell me if shes pressuring you into this.Oh, for the love of God!Are you stupid or just being a pain in the ass on purpose?Caroline shouted.Sams already ruddy face darkened, and his shoulders straightened.You better watch the way you talk to me, Caroline, or youll join your boyfriend.Caroline opened her mouth to retort, but Ellie stopped her by saying, Its true, Sam.Gabe didnt hurt me.I hardly know him.Here.Ellie pulled out her phone, scrolling through.When she found what she was looking for, she handed it to Sam.Here is a video of Kyle kicking me.You only see him for a second, but you can hear his voice on the recording.Sam seemed uneasy as she hit play.You want to say no to me?Ill teach you what happens to stupid sluts who say no to me.The sounds of blows against flesh sickened Caroline, and despite her anger with Ellie, she pulled her baby sister into her arms.Im sorry I didnt protect you from him, Caroline whispered.Ellies shoulders shook as Caroline rubbed her back.When the video was over, Sam set the phone down and said, Ill have a car pick up Kyle Jenner at his home.Tears burned Carolines own eyes.You have to release Gabe.Sam held up his hand.Once I have Kyle in custody, Ill release Moriarty.Fine, Caroline said, handing him the packet her father had given her.Whats this?Leverage, in case hes uncooperative.GABE SAT UP on the cot, waiting.He could have sworn he heard Caroline shouting, but it must have been his imagination.Wishful thinking.What do you expect, man?You cut her off.You deserve it if she lets you rot.Maybe he had overreacted to her taking off on him, but he hadnt been wrong about the gravity of her sisters accusations.Whatever her reasons, Ellie had ruined any chance he had for getting his business off the ground here.People wouldnt trust him, even if Caroline got her to admit she lied.And even then, Caroline likely wouldnt take his side over her sisters.It shouldnt surprise him that the minute he tasted a moment of happiness, it was yanked away.Karma still must have a hold of his short hairs.THIS IS BULLSHIT!Kyle yelled from the interrogation room.I want my lawyer.Sure thing, boss, Sam said, standing up.Caroline stood on the other side of the mirrored window, watching Kyle twist.It would have been sweeter if Sam had left the cuffs on him, but since hed been cooperative, Sam hadnt felt the need.As Sam came out the door, Caroline said, I want to talk to him.He asked for a lawyer, Caroline, so were just going to let him stew for a minute.Im not a cop, Sam.I can talk to him all I want, Caroline said, trying to walk past him.There are procedures and rules, Sam argued.I just need some time to get him talking.Hes an arrogant son of a bitch, and I know, if I can just get him riled, hell hang himself, Caroline said, touching his arm.If he had hurt your sister or wife, what would you tell her?Sam blustered for half a second before grumbling, One minute.Thank you.Before he could change his mind, she stepped into the room, her stomach tied up in knots.Kyle looked up at her, shock written all over his face.Kyle, she said before she sat down across from him.I dont understand.Kyle tugged at his tie.What are you doing here?Im here to make sure you never leave the Idaho prison system.Oh yeah?Kyle said, sitting back in his chair.And how are you going to do that?Well, its funny, Caroline said.Did you know that theres no statute of limitations for rape in the state of Idaho?Of course I do, he said warily.So, if at any time, even if its not for another twenty years, I wanted to walk into a police station and say, Kyle Jenner raped me in one of his guest rooms when I was fifteen, I can do that.Caroline experienced her first zing of triumph as Kyle sat forward, looking nervously toward the door.I dont know what youre trying to do, Caroline, but even if something had happened, it would have been consensual.Consensual?Doesnt a girl usually have to say yes for it to be consensual?Oh, you said yes, he said mockingly.Several times.Keep your calm.By the time youre done with him, hell be picking up soap in the shower, with ten other men calling him sweet cheeks.Did I?Funny how I cant remember that, she said, hating the way her voice shook with every word.What I remember is feeling woozy before you carried me upstairs.I remember you taking advantage of me.You hurt me.And then, you threatened my sisters.Whatever story you want to spin to make yourself feel better, thats on you, but I dont have to force myself on women to get laid, Kyle said smugly.Taking a deep breath, Caroline tried to remain in control.She could hold out long enough to make him hand himself in.Standing up, she continued, Until recently, I hadnt told anyone what you did, and it was like living in a hell I couldnt escape.And the worst part was, I let you put me there.I took what you did and blamed myself for it.But it was never my fault.Youre the damaged one.Kyles face flushed nearly purple.Damaged?I work for a prestigious law firm and have my pick of women.You were the one who got drunk and was all over me.I just took what was offered.You can try to play it off however you want, but I finally understand that you are just a weak, disgusting waste of a human being, she said, her tone mocking as she added, I mean, it must take a real big man to force himself on a girl half his size.Shut up, bitch, Kyle snarled.Whats the matter, Kyle?Am I not your type anymore?Because Im not scared of you?She forced a laugh.Maybe I just realized that underneath all that smarm youre just ...pathetic.He jumped to his feet and grabbed her shoulders, squeezing them painfully as he pushed her back onto the table.Caroline smiled like the cat that got the cream.Shed wanted to make him angry, wanted to throw him off.Youre the pathetic one.Poor little Caroline; nobody loves her.You were so desperate for my attention, he said, holding fast when she struggled.He leaned forward until he was nose to nose with her.His nearness made her skin crawl.It was so easy.I just added a little nip of whatever I could get my hands on and a few of my mothers sleeping pills.You just kept guzzling that disgusting punch until you were barely conscious.Shed known he must have drugged her, but hearing the words come out of his mouth made bile rise up her throat, choking her.Caroline heard the sound of the rooms doorknob turning, but she had locked it.She had wanted to be alone with him, to make him sweat.God, she was such an idiot.I think my favorite part was when you woke up during and started to struggle, pleading with me to stop, he taunted her.Bringing her legs up, she planted them into Kyles stomach and pushed him back.As he released her, stumbling back, she got her bearings and jumped back onto her feet.Just as he started to stand straight, she slapped him, backing away before he could reach for her.She couldnt hold it in anymore, not when he was mocking her with that night.She wasnt fifteen years old, drugged and helpless.Or walking down a dark alley.She was ready for him.And Gabe?Why did you blackmail my sister into accusing him?He rubbed his cheek and tsked at her.Caroline, I have no idea what youre talking about.Forget lying, idiot, my sister has you recorded on her cell phone, beating her.Time stamped and everything.Kyle paled, and Caroline wanted to laugh that she had finally cracked his cool shell.That bastard got right where he belongs, all on his own.Well, congratulations, Kyle, because were gonna be saying the same thing about you in a few hours.Kyle scoffed, but his eyes werent so sure.Your sister is hardly a credible witness, no matter what she might have on her phone.Oh, youll definitely pay for what you did to Ellie, but thats not whats going to put you away for half your life, if not more, Caroline said, crossing her arms.You know, I was sick every time I thought about what youd done to me, but I had no idea how many others there were.What are you talking about, others?The other women you raped and paid off to keep quiet.For the first time in years, Caroline felt in control.That she had some of her power back.Sweat was starting to trail down the sides of Kyles face, and Caroline was enjoying every single second.Its funny; once my father contacted them and told them you were being brought up on assault charges, six of them decided to make the trip to town to make statements, Caroline said, grinning.Three of them are here already.I wonder what theyre telling the nice officers about your veryshe looked down at his crotchunimpressive equipment.Kyle lunged at her with a roar.Throwing her right shoulder forward, she twisted under his arm and kicked him as hard as she could in the groin.As he grabbed himself and groaned, she swung her right fist and hit him across his cheekbone, sending him crashing to the floor.Suddenly, the door burst open, and the room filled with police officers and her father.Are you all right, Caroline?Shaking her hand out, she said, Just working out my demons, Daddy.Sam came in, scowling at Kyle.We got it.Everything?Caroline said, relief rushing through her.Yeah, you were right, Sam said, shaking his head.I cant believe you got him to hang himself.Oh, believe me, I can irritate anyone if I put my mind to it.Leaning over Kyle, she pointed at the camera in the ceiling corner with the red blinking light.Wave to the camera, Kyle.Kyle turned his head, and when he saw the camera, he struggled against the cuffs.Oh, you bitch ...you fucking bitch, Kyle groaned from the floor.Two of the officers reached down and hauled him to his feet.Caroline?her father said, his mouth twitching like he was fighting a smile.Yes, Daddy?Have you ever considered a career in law enforcement?I have some connections ...he said, his lips still twitching with humor.Surprised by his attempt to be funny, she laughed.Thanks, but I actually love the way my lifes turning out.Turning to the chief of police, she said, Sir, I believe you have something of mine, and Id like it back.Twenty Seven The three hardest words in the English language are not I love you but I forgive you.Miss Know It All   GABRIEL MORIARTY, ONE of the officers called out as he opened the cell.It seemed a little silly to Gabe, considering he was the only one in the cage.Yeah, he said, sitting up.Youve been cleared, son.The officer opened the door and stepped back.Youre free to go.How was I cleared?The officer shook his head.Chief just said you had an angel on your side.Gabe walked out of the cell and knew exactly who the angel was.After he finished his paperwork, another uniform drove him down the road to the apartment.He got out of the car and took the stairs two at a time, only to find the front door unlocked.Caroline looked up from the kitchen table, a pen and paper in her hand.Youre home, she said breathlessly.Gabe nodded.Seems the charges were dropped.Im guessing that was you.Yeah, Ellie had a video of Kyle beating her, Caroline said, standing up.And I provoked him into admitting what he did to me, and my dad had found some of Kyles other victims.Its finally over.All he wanted to do was take her into his arms, but he wasnt sure what was allowed.Or if he should start something up again.Maybe he had put too much pressure on herand what was between themthe first time around.What were you writing?She looked away.I was actually writing you another apology letter.I didnt get very far, though.Caroline picked up the paper and handed it to him.Gabe, By now theyve released you.I need to tell you again how sorry I am, over and over if I must.I left in a moment of sheer panic, but I knew it was a mistake the minute the plane took off.He could understand what she meant about a moment of sheer panic.Hadnt he been fighting his feelings for her over the last month?Telling himself he didnt deserve her?And when shed bailed, hed told himself he deserved it.Look, maybe we just jumped into this too fast.Maybe we just need to step back and take things slowly, he said, the words eating him up, even as he spoke them.I can stay at the shop.Its okay, she said, her voice sounding strained.My sister said I could stay with her.Ill take Possum and Googlie with me, so you dont have to bother with them.They arent a bother, Gabe said.I know, she said, walking toward him.She lifted her hand to stroke his cheek before walking past him.Gabe almost reached out and hauled her into his armsthats what his impulsive side wouldve done.But time apart would be good for them, would help them decide if they were really right for each other.Or whether intense pasts and close quarters had brought two people closer who really didnt belong together.As the front door closed behind Caroline, he sank into the couch, resting his head in his hands.His cell phone rang in his pocket.When he answered it, an unfamiliar voice said, Mr.Moriarty?Yes?he said.Rick Jameson for the Rock Canyon Press.I would like to interview you for the paper tomorrow.Interview me?Why?Why?An innocent man set up by an alleged serial rapist for protecting his girlfriend?You, sir, are big news, Rick said.Now, is your last name spelled M O R I A R T Y?Yes, but I have to ask you, who leaked the story?Im sorry, Mr.Moriarty, I cannot reveal my sources.Thats okay.I have an idea.Maybe it was too easy, but it was hard not to forgive a girl who fought to prove his innocence and save his reputation.CAROLINE WAS MISERABLE, and shed only been back on her sisters couch for four days.At least no one had been keeping her up late.Since Ellie had cut a deal with the DA in return for testifying against Kyle, shed been on house arrest, except for her court ordered community service.All in all, shed gotten lucky, although she certainly didnt seem to act like it.Then again, Caroline hadnt felt like the world was all sunshine and rainbows either.Can I ask you again why you and your devil cats arent sleeping at your own place?Caroline was lying on Vals couch with Googs and Possum sleeping on her chest while she watched Reality Bites.Googlie lifted his head long enough to hiss at Val.Much to Carolines amusement, her kittens had despised Val and her dog on sight.I told you; its being fumigated.Right, Val said, whacking her with a pillow and startling the cats.Letting off a bomb in your apartment takes one day, so explain why youve been a bump on my couch for four?What can I say?We have big bugs, Caroline said, reaching for her Coke and rubbing the wounds the cats nails had left as theyd escaped.Now get out of my way.This is the good part.No.No more romantic dramas.All this life imitating a movie imitating life is bullshit.I watch movies to be entertained.Not sob into my sisters throw pillows and wipe my snot all over them.You know, it wasnt too long ago you were begging me to stay, Caroline said.That was when you were Fun Caroline.Now youre Obnoxiously Sad Caroline.Ellie and I dealt with you when you were sad.I dont get weepy.I get hungry.I eat.You blubber and moan ...All right, fine.Ill go home.And take those cats with you, Val called over her shoulder as she walked away.Youre a brat!Freeloader!Anal retentive!Caroline flopped back on the couch, depressed.She hadnt told Val shed given up the apartment because she hadnt wanted to listen to Val tear Gabe apart.Gabe had said he wanted to talk and see where things went, but he still hadnt called.She couldnt blame him, though.Gabe had every right not to forgive her, and she just had to accept that.GABE FINISHED UP another call and hung up the phone with a wide grin.How many orders is that?Chase asked, his pencil poised above the sketch pad.Thats twenty six since Tuesday.And Im sure your recent boom of success has nothing to do with that article the Rock Canyon Press printed about you.Hey, who am I to look a gift horse in the mouth?Gabe said.The truth was, the orders had been a good distraction from thinking about Caroline.He kept meaning to call, but every time he did, he lost his nerve.Besides, everything he came up with to say just didnt seem right.I miss you?Im sorry I was so quick to judge?None of it seemed good enough.Especially when hed been tossing and turning every night, catching himself burying his head in her pillow.Yeah, especially when another handful of customers were recommended to you by Caroline, Chase said, setting his pencil down.Have you even called her, man?I dont know what to say.How about, I forgive you.Im sorry it took so long, but please believe I love you?I dont know, man.What if I took too long?Well, if you wait any longer, youre going to miss your chance.I mean, what are you waiting for?You love her, she loves you, and youre perfect for each other.Stubborn, opinionated I never said she was anything like me, Gabe said.But she was.She was his reason to smile in the morning, and he missed the soft touch of her hands on his skin.He could hear her laugh echoing through their empty apartment, and he wanted her to come home.Home.Their home.Maybe Chase was right.Their similarities were working against them.I read between the lines.Since you complained that you two fought all the time, I decided it was because you were so similar.Gabe had gone over every scenario for days, but each one left him with the door slammed in his face.Chase was right.Shed saved him, and instead of falling to his knees and telling her he loved her, hed let her walk out the door.He kept blaming karma and punishing himself for his mistakes, but this one was on his own stubbornness.And his own fear.If he opened up to her about his feelings, would she cut and run again?What if she doesnt accept my apology?Then youll know where you stand, Chase said, standing up with a grin.But if I were you, Id find out sooner rather than later.CAROLINE HAD BEEN experimenting with the effects chocolate had on spoonfuls of peanut butter when someone knocked on the front door.Sticking the spoon in her mouth, she walked over and opened the door, expecting the UPS man, but instead, Gabe looked in at her nervously with a bouquet of roses in his hands.I know I should have called, but I was afraid you wouldnt see me, and I needed to say this.She waited quietly, somewhere between shock and awe.Plus, the peanut butter was stuck to the roof of her mouth, and she was afraid to try to speak.I have tried to be a good guy for years, to prove to my sister, to my mother, even to Chase that I wasnt just the dumb asshole who ruined everyones lives.I figured when we started hooking up that it was going to be short lived fun, but I found myself wanting to prove that to you too.And it scared the hell out of me, especially when you left for New York and I wasnt sure if you were coming back.I should have just accepted your apology and moved on, but I sabotage things because I have a hard time thinking anything good can happen to me.But youre the best thing thats ever happened to me.Not just because of the way you make me feelfeelings that Ive never felt beforebut because you dont judge.Youve always accepted me, even when I was an asshole.Youre amazing, Caroline, and Id like to spend the rest of my life showing you just how much I love everything about you, starting tomorrow.Pulling the spoon out of her mouth, she worked the peanut butter until she could swallow it.Whats tomorrow?she asked breathlessly.Our first date, hopefully, he said with a nervous grin.Id ask you to come home now, but I want it to feel like the real thing.Like I come to your door and ask your sisters permission.As if we hadnt started things off ass backward.Her heart swelled at the sweet, romantic gesture, and she teased, I dont know.My sisters can be major hard asses.Not sure theyll let me out the door.Leaning closer, she added, You look like one of those guys who could get a girl in trouble.I used to be that guy, he said, handing her the armful of roses hed been holding.No sooner had she taken them than he was cupping her face in his hands.But that was before I fell in love with you.Holy hell, what do you say to that?Choking back a sob, she said, Thats pretty convenient, considering I love you too.He dipped his head, and she met his kiss, dropping the roses to the floor of the entryway so she could wrap her arms around his shoulders.Finally, he pulled back and whispered, Ill pick you up at noon?Sure, she whispered, but first ...What?She jerked him inside and shut the door behind him.What are you doing?he asked, a smile spreading across his face, lighting up those obsidian eyes.People in love have make up sex, dont they?So Ive heard, he said.She jumped him, wrapping her arms and legs around him, trusting him to catch her.He did, of course.Well, come on.Lets get on with it.Where am I going?Gabe asked.An evil plan formed in Carolines head.Vals room is on the left.Wont she be pissed?Gabe said, pushing the door open.Too damn bad!Now shell know what it was like to listen to her loud monkey sex for two weeks, Caroline said, giggling.Payback is a bitch.Twenty Eight Love is about sharing yourself with someone else.Even the ugly, scary, bumpy parts.Miss Know It All   THE NEXT DAY, Caroline stood at the front window of Vals house, waiting for Gabe.It was five minutes til noon, and although shed tried not to be a window clinger, she was too excited to care.Suddenly, the back door opened, and Val came inside.Gus pushed past her to run to Caroline, which sent Googlie and Possum scurrying for cover.The dog skidded to a stop at her feet, huffing and puffing so hard she could feel his hot breath through her jeans.Caroline glanced down at the dog, whose massive jaws were spread widely into an evil grin, just as he started to put his dirt covered paw on her leg.Dont even think about it, mutt, Caroline growled, pointing her finger at him.The dog actually paused and put his paw down, still grinning at her.I told him to do it, Val said as she came into the kitchen.Its revenge for defiling my bedroom and locking me out of it.Caroline didnt even bother to look ashamed.Gabe and she had been enjoying a little post make up sex cuddle when her sister had come home to get changed.When shed tried the door and found it locked, shed pounded on the door.After a few minutes, Caroline had opened the door, dressed in a sheet and holding an overnight bag stuffed with some of Vals clothes.Tell Justin I said hi, Caroline said before closing the door again.You better wash those sheets!Val had ordered, before slamming out of the house.Caroline started humming as she tapped a finger on the counter, and Val came up alongside her, one of those meal shakes in her hand.Seriously, why couldnt you have gone to your own apartment to do the deed instead of locking me out of my own room?Just then, Caroline saw Gabe pull up on his bike, and she picked her jacket off the counter.As she shrugged into, she said, Because revenge is a dish best served cold ...or sweaty, in your case.Aw, gross, Val said, sticking her tongue out.And what did I do besides give you a place to stay?I sheltered you, fed you, supplied you with plenty of nineties romantic dramas ...Made me sleep on your lumpy couch and listen to your barn animal sex noises, Caroline said, patting her sisters shoulder.Let this be something you can learn from.And what lesson am I supposed to learn, Yoda?That your couch sucks.Get a new one, Caroline said, opening the door and stepping out.Gabe, about to knock on the door, moved to let her step down next to him.Before Caroline could shut the door, Val caught it and stood there, glaring at Gabe.Hey, Val, Gabe said.Val glared at both of them, before telling him, Youre dead to me.Gabe turned to Caroline, who just waved.Its fine.Val had the door almost shut when she said, No, its not!The door closed with a click, and Caroline stepped into him, sliding her arms up and behind his neck.I missed you, she whispered as she tugged on him to come down.He chuckled but obliged her, his lips moving over hers in a lingering kiss that ended too soon for Caroline.Gabe pulled away, his large hands squeezing her butt.As much as I want to continue this, we have a lot of driving to do.Caroline released him with a pout.Where are weoh.Gabe unwound his arms and took her hand, bringing it to his mouth.If you want to wait No, Caroline said, holding his hand tight.I want to meet her.The smile that lit Gabes face was worth the butterflies nervously fluttering inside Carolines belly.His eyes actually sparkled with joy, and she decided then and there, even if she had to walk though hot coals and pokers, that shed do just about anything to see that smile again.GABE AND CAROLINE walked into Honeys care facility two hours later.While Gabe signed them in, he never let go of her hand, afraid shed bolt at any moment.Come on; shes up here, Gabe said, heading for the stairs.What if ...?He paused and looked back at her.She was nervous as hell, he could tell, but he wanted her to be good with this.My sister is the sweetest person and even if shes having a bad dayhe paused to give her a soft, reassuring kissshes going to love you.Caroline nodded, and he started walking again.When they stood outside Honeys room, he knocked softly, taking his own deep breath.It was the first time hed ever introduced a woman to his sister, and he wanted it to go well.Despite his brave front, he was probably worse off than Caroline.Sharla answered the door and, seeing them, gave them a wide, toothy smile.You must be Caroline, Sharla said, holding her hand out.Im Sharla.Yes, its so nice to meet you, Caroline said, shaking her hand.Well, come in, you two, Sharla said, stepping back to let them in.I told Honey that Gabe was bringing a friend, and shes been asking for you.Gabe gave Sharla a one armed hug as he passed, and she whispered, Shes very pretty.Yes, she is.Caroline was gripping his hand for dear life as Sharla led them into the room.Honey was sitting at her table, sketching on a thick drawing pad with chalk.As they approached the table, Sharla went around and touched Honeys shoulder.Sweetheart, your brothers here with his friend, Sharla said.Honey looked up, her whole face becoming animated.Gabe!She came around the table at full speed and launched herself into his arms.Gabe let go of Carolines hand to catch his sister and hugged her hard.Hey, baby girl, Gabe said, turning her around to face Caroline.This is my friend Caroline.This is my sister, Honey.Caroline held her hand out to Honey and said, Im so happy to meet you.Gabes told me a lot about you.The painting you made him is beautiful.Gabe held his breath, waiting for his sister to react.Sometimes new people made her nervous.But when she pulled away from him now, he let her go.Honey took Carolines hand and said, I want to show you my drawings.As the two women he loved walked over to the table, he watched as Honey pulled Caroline down next to her.Do you like to sketch?Honey asked Caroline.Im not very artistic, Im afraid, she said, looking at the picture on the page.Not like you.This is amazing, Honey.Honey beamed before turning the page.I want to sketch you.Caroline looked toward Gabe, who shrugged.His sister had once detained the pizza delivery guy so she could sketch him.Okay, sure, Caroline said.Sit very still, Honey said, reaching out to tilt Carolines head.Dont move.Im not going anywhere, Caroline said, and Gabe believed her.CAROLINE SAT ON the bed next to Honey, stroking Honeys hair while they watched Homeward Bound.It was so reminiscent of something she would have done with her own sisters as kids, she didnt even feel weird about it.Honeys childlike enthusiasm was addictive, especially when shed convinced Gabe to go get them fries and vanilla milkshakes, which hed done after a minute or two of mock grumbling.As the credits rolled, Caroline glanced over at Gabe, who had pulled up a chair near the daybed to watch.Honey had told him he couldnt sit on the bed with them, and hed taken it with humor.What do you mean, I cant sit up there?I always sit up there!Caroline and I are sitting up here.No boys allowed, even brothers.Caroline had laughed and agreed.Yeah, girls only.Now, Gabe stood up and looked down at them, his eyes a little shiny as he cleared his throat.Honey, Caroline and I have to leave.No!Honey said, wrapping her arms around Carolines waist.But weve got a long drive home, baby girl, Gabe said patiently.You can stay here, Honey said, her voice muffled.Caroline held up her hand, and Gabe closed his mouth.Hey, Honey, did Gabe tell you about our kittens?Honey sat up quickly and shook her head.You have kittens?Two of them.Your brother saved them.He did this thing with his hands Like the puppy!Honey cried, clapping her hands.Caroline looked up at Gabe questioningly.I tried it on a stillborn puppy our dog had, he said modestly.He learned it from 101 Dalmatians, Honey said.I see, Caroline said, pulling out her cell phone.Here are some pictures of Googlie and Possum when theyre eating.She swiped her finger across the screen.And this is when they really started moving around.Honey reached out and started swiping her finger over the screen, searching through the pictures, and Caroline said, How about the next time we come to visit, I bring a bunch of pictures, just for you?Honey nodded vigorously, still staring hard at the images.I love animals.Caroline stood up, and Sharla stepped forward.Honey, its time for you to see Dr.Hamilton.Sharla touched Honeys shoulder, and she finally acknowledged her.Caroline waited and watched as Honey stopped to give Gabe a hard bear hug.Gabe kissed the side of her head and said, You take care now, baby girl.You too, Gabey, Honey said, moving on to Caroline.When she hugged her, Honey whispered in her ear, Take care of him.When she pulled away, Honey was smiling at her, sweetly.Bye.Caroline let Gabe take her hand and lead her out of the room.Gabe was walking so fast, she could hardly keep up.Gabe, slow down.Did I do something wrong?she asked as they passed through the main reception area.No, Gabe said as he dragged her around the side of the building and pressed her back against the wall.What Gabes mouth slammed down on hers, his hands all over her as he kissed her.She turned to mush as his passion washed over her, pressing her into the building as he made love to her mouth.It was different from every other kiss theyd ever had, almost desperate.When he pulled away, his hand was tangled in her hair, and neither of them could catch their breath.Her breathing finally started to slow, and she laughed huskily.Well, that was definitely new.His shoulders heaved under her hands, and she realized Gabe wasnt just trying to catch his breath.He was crying.Hey, Gabe, she said, ducking her head to look at his face.He pulled away and wiped at his eyes with his T shirt.Fuck, he muttered.Caroline stood there, unsure of what she was supposed to do, but finally reached out for him.Pulling him back into her arms, she stroked her hands over his back and kissed his chest.She didnt say anything as she held him, waiting for him to collect himself.After a minute, he lifted his head and cupped her face.You are amazing.Carolines own eyes stung as she covered his hands with hers.I didnt do anything.Gabe dropped his forehead to hers.Yes, you did.He kissed her softly, tenderly.I want to take you home, he said, releasing her face and reaching into his pocket for his keys.Okay.But instead of a ring with several keys, he pulled out a single key with a wine bottle charm attached.No, I want to take you back to our home, he said, tucking her hair behind her ear.Its not the same there without you.Sniffling, she took the key from him and laughed wetly.Well have to rescue Possum and Googlie.Of course, but first, he said, pulling her into his arms, I want to take you home and show you how much you mean to me.Yeah?So ...You should probably call your sister and tell her shes cat sitting for the night.Epilogue As I am tasked with reporting all the gossip, I should like to be the first to inform you that two years from the day of her return to Rock Canyon, Miss Caroline Willis became Mrs.Gabe Moriarty in a small but tasteful ceremony.Miss Know It All   GABE MORIARTY HAD never expected to fall in love, get married, or live out his dream in a small town in Idaho, but here he was, coming home from a ten hour day to find his wife asleep on the couch.Although they no longer lived in the little two bedroom apartment above Chloes Book Nook, the furniture still looked the samewith the addition of a brown La Z Boy chair Caroline had bought him for their one year anniversary.All of it fit nicely in their three bedroom house off Oak Avenue, with a quarter acre lot and a two car garage.The house was affordable without straining their finances.Gabe washed his hands at the sink and came back to hover over his wife, who was being guarded by their cats, Googlie and Possum, each fifteen pounds and both lazy as hell.Gabe pulled out his phone and took a picture of Caroline, mouth hanging open, with the cats curled up on her chest and stomach.Coming around the front of the couch, he shooed the cats off and lifted her into his arms, careful of her stomach.The baby bump was just starting to show, and Caroline had been obsessed with getting a picture of it every day, just to show how much it had grown.Hed tried to tell her they could do it once a month and the change would be more dramatic, but she ignored him.Cradling her against his chest, he leaned over to kiss her forehead.One of his favorite things about his wife was how soundly she slept, even when he jostled her.As he carried her back to their master bedroom, he peeked in on the nursery Caroline had been working on over the last month, despite the fact that they still had five to go.He took in the lemon yellow walls covered with pictures of zoo animals and smiled at the progress shed been making.Good job, princess.She mumbled something softly, and he continued on into their room, where he could lay her down on the bed.Covering her with a blanket, he started to leave, but Caroline grabbed his hand sleepily.Stay with me?As he climbed in behind her, he placed his mouth beside her ear and whispered, Always.
