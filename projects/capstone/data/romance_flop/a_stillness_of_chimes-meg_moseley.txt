Eighteen years ago Laura Gantt didnt believe in ghosts, but sometimes she wondered if living across from a graveyard had warped her. Part Irish, all southern, descended from moonshiners and holy rollers, shed always believed in things she couldnt see. Her dad said it was just the old whisperings in their blood. All morning, shed heard soft, sure warnings. Some kind of trouble was on its way. The whisperings hinted it would come for Sean. She and her friends, plus one tagalong kid sister, had been picking blackberries for an hour in the brambles that lined the railroad tracks. Trees choked with kudzu vines loomed above them like green monsters. A few feet away, Cassie Bright and her little sister worked side by side, their blond hair damp with sweat. Sean Halloran was bent over the brambles farther down the tracks. He looked lost in a T-shirt his brother had outgrown. Sean straightened and squared his skinny shoulders. No slacking off, Gantt, he hollered. Lazy bum. Laura swatted a mosquito on her arm and tried to think of a smart comeback. She gave up and shrugged. Sean went back to work, laughing, but he couldnt fool her. She knew what he lived with. Sweat trickled down her neck. She was sick of the heat, the scratches, the bug bites. There were snakes too. She tried not to think about the snakes. Cassie stopped working to examine her fingers, stained purple with juice. Ugh. I hate blackberries. I hate snakes worse, Laura said, thinking of Seans father. The Halloran boys called him by his first name Daleto show their disrespect. Never to his face, though. They wouldnt dare. Cassie moved closer between long-reaching canes that bristled with wicked little thorns. Guess what? she said quietly. The Cheevers heard the Peeping Tom last night. He was pitching pebbles at their windows. Why do you act like its good news? Its creepy. Yeah, but this town could use a little excitement. My dad says its Slattery. Laura shivered in spite of the heat. A sloppy, skinny man, Slattery lived in a run-down duplex just down the road. Nobody knew his first name. How would your dad know who it is? she asked. He has a friend whos a deputy, remember? He tells us all kinds of stuff. Laura dropped a handful of ripe berries into her bucket. Your dads friend should spend less time talking and more time catching bad guys. Youre scared. Scared of a silly prowler. No, Im not. My daddy has his guns. Bet you wont be so brave when the Peeping Toms at your window. Heoh! Cassie shrieked and giggled. Mr. Gantt, you spooked me. Sneaking up like that. Laura hadnt noticed her father either, but there he was. A curlicue of wood shavings clung to his shirt, and the humidity made his sandy-blond hair frizz where it escaped from under his baseball cap. He didnt seem to be in one of his moods, but she wasnt sure until he tipped his cap, his eyes twinkling. My apologies, Miss Cassie, he said. I didnt aim to scare anybody. Looks like youve got that department covered, though. He wrapped his arm around Lauras shoulders. Hey, sweetheart. Are you managing to comport yourself like a lady? Always. Laura leaned into his sun-warmed shirt and that familiar smell of sawdust. You dont have to keep checking on us. Were not babies. Even when youre a grown woman, youll be my baby girl. No matter what. Out of nowhere, a heavy sadness settled on her. Whether it was about his troubles or Seans, it made her feel like a grown woman already. A grown woman who didnt mind being called her fathers baby girl. And youll always be my dad, she said. No matter what. He smiled and gave her ponytail a gentle tug. Then he nodded toward Cassies sister. Tiggers still a baby even if she doesnt think so, he said quietly. Yall keeping an eye on her? Laura and Cassie glanced at each other and swiveled their eyes back to him. Yes sir, they said in unison. He turned toward Sean. Young Mr. Halloran. Its good to see you, son. Its good to see you too, sir. Sean spoke with so much respect that she half expected him to salute his hero. Her father, Elliott Gantt. I understand your brother enlisted, her dad said. Yes sir. Sean came closer to his idol but not too close. Hes in boot camp. You must be proud. Yes sir, I am. I hope hell never have to go to war. If he does, though, hell make you prouder still. Yes sir. I know he will. Lauras dad stole a few berries from her pail. Yall behave, now. He studied Tigger, his expression softening. You too, Tig. Be good for your big sister. I will, she chirped. Youre always a good girl, arent you? Tigger nodded and gave him an angelic smile, drawing a laugh from him and a subdued grumble from Cassie. Ill get back to work, he said. That wood wont make itself into anything useful. Bye, Dad, Laura said. See you at supper. Yep. And well have cobbler again, I hope. You and your mama make the best blackberry cobbler in Georgia. He swiped a few more berries, their color nearly matching the neat lettering on his muscular armlife everlasting. A memento of his army days, it was his only tattoo. A bright yellow butterfly wove a wobbly path above his head as he waded through the brambles, finally disappearing in the tangle of green. He would come out on First Street, a block from his workshop in downtown Prospect. I wish he wouldnt keep checking on us, Laura said. I mean, come on. Were twelve. Yeah, maybe he needs to loosen up a little. As Sean approached, Cassie lowered her voice. Just be glad hes not like Seans dad. What a creep. Sean came closer, his pail bumping against the leg of his too-short jeans. He scowled at Cassie. I heard that. She scowled back. Sorry, but its true. That doesnt mean yall have to go around yammering about it. You have to tell somebody, Laura said. He squinted at her. Tell somebody what? Dont play dumb. She lifted his floppy sleeve so Cassie could see the new bruise on his sun-browned shoulder. He yanked the sleeve down, moving so quickly that berries spilled from his bucket. Mind your own business. You are my business, Laura said. Youre my friend. He walked off without answering, his head high and his shoulders stiff. Cassie wrinkled her nose. Whats wrong with him lately? Everythings worse since Keith enlisted. Lauras eyes watered. Now Seans got nobody to watch his back. His brother mustve been sick of looking after him. Like Im sick of looking after Tigger. Dont say that. Youre lucky to have a sister. Yeah, Im real lucky. Im always stuck watching her so she wont wander off. Sometimes I wish she would. Cassie! You know I dont mean it. Im just so tired of having her tag along. Tigger the Tagger. Cassie stared into the distance, her eyes rimmed with smudges of the mascara shed borrowed from her moms bathroom. Someday Ill get out of here. Out of Georgia. All the way to Hollywood, maybe. She brightened. Mom bought some new nail polish. Sunset Boulevard Red. Lets go paint our nails. My dad doesnt want me to paint my nails until Im older. Youre older than you were yesterday, so youre older. Come on. He wont even notice, and your mom wont care. Shes cool. Hey, maybe we can talk my mom into renting a movie. Cassie popped a berry into her mouth and walked away. Laura studied her purple fingertips. Berry stains were allowedand so was a tattoo, at least for her dadbut nail polish wasnt. It didnt make sense. She continued tugging ripe fruits from their stems, aware that Sean was slowly working his way back. At last he stopped beside her. He reached for a cane loaded with berries that hung like black jewels in the bright green leaves. Sorry I got mad. I just dont like it when you tell me what to do. I cant make you do what I say, but you sure cant keep me from saying what I think. He gave her a quick glance and went back to picking. Youre all right, Gantt. Sometimes. For a girl. Cassie popped up from behind a bush. Sean and Laura, sittin in a tree, she chanted. K-I-S-S Knock it off, Sean said. Were just friends. Were all friends, Laura said. All three of us. She looked over her shoulder. Tigger was singing softly, paying no attention to the rest of them. Laura placed her bucket on a patch of relatively clear and level ground. Put down your berries for a minute. Sean and Cassie cooperated, but they looked hot and tired and skeptical. Whats this about? Sean asked. Ordering me around again? Yes. Listen up, yall. Hands together, right now. We have a promise to make. Three pairs of hands layered themselves together, stained and sticky with juice, marked with dirt and scratches and bug bites. The girls hands were pale and small compared to Seans bigger, darker hands. A bruise Laura hadnt noticed before circled his left wrist like a wide purple bracelet. Me too, Tigger said, bouncing toward them on her skinny legs. Her glittery pink hair clip was about to fall out of her silky hair. Cassie pushed her sister away. This isnt little-girl stuff. Im not little! Im almost eight. Let her stay. Laura drew Tigs hands in with the bigger ones. Were just going to promise well always be there for each other. A glance at Sean made her heart hurt. Well look out for each other. Always. That wasnt half of what she wanted to say, but her throat had clogged up. The others only stared at her. Say it, she ordered in a whisper. Promise. I promise, Sean and Cassie said, and Tigger piped up with another Me too. Sean glared at each one in turn, his shaggy hair half-veiling his fierce blue eyes and hiding most of the tiny scars on his forehead. But yall have to promise you wont do anything stupid either. He looked straight at Laura. Promise you wont go blabbing things that shouldnt be blabbed. I promise, Cassie said. No blabbing. No blabbing, Tigger parroted. Lauras hands were roasting. She felt as trapped as the times shed knelt at the altar until her legs ached, but she didnt dare move in the middle of a moment that might have been sacred. This wasnt church, though. It was pure foolishness, probably. Laura, Sean said. Promise. Maybe this was part of being there for him, part of being his friend: promising to do things his way. Because, after all, she didnt know what kind of trouble shed stir up for him if she told her folks about his bully of a father. She let out her breath. When she inhaled, her lungs seemed to fill with a deep sadness that seeped into every cell of her body. I promise. No blabbing. Sean nodded. His face relaxed a tad. A honeybee drowsed over his shoulder, breaking the spell. Laura flexed her fingers but couldnt free herself from the sticky, sweltering pile of hands. Tigger yanked loose, releasing the rest of them too. Sean, lookit, she said, picking up her pail. I got tons of berries. Thats a lot, he said. Good work, Tig. She scampered away, her pale hair catching the light. The sun always seemed to find her, even in the shade. Cassie held her juice-stained hand to her heart. There. We made a solemn vow, signed in the blood of a thousand berries. Dropping the dramatic pose, she laughed and walked away. Sean poured his berries into Lauras pail, filling it to the brim. Give em to your mom. You dont want any? You think I bake pies and things? Nah. Im gonna go drown some worms behind the Bennetts place. Now? The fish wont be biting. Thatll still be better than hanging around with a bunch of girls. She gave his wiry shoulder a gentle shove. Get out of here, then. Get out of my way and I will. Stop by later, she said. I might be at Cassies house for a while, though. Dont start slapping on the makeup like she does. I like you the way you are. Laura blinked. And dont bat your eyelashes at me, he added. I wasnt Sure, you were. Sean gave her a quick grin and sauntered away. He would follow the tracks north for a while. Then he would cut to the left on the dirt road that led to the Bennetts little lake. He never had qualms about fishing on private property. But he hadnt brought a fishing line, and his house was in the other direction. He only wanted a place to hide out while his dad was home. Sean didnt have a mom to stick up for him. Or to bake cobblers with. He would be all right, though. He was smart and strong and good. He would run away if he had to, and then Dale Halloran wouldnt have anybody left to kick around but the dog. Man, its hot, Cassie said, slapping a mosquito on her neck. Lets go. Yeah, Im done too. Sean gave me his berries. Come on, Tigger, Cassie said. Time to bounce along home. Tigger pouted. I have to fill my bucket first. Oh, all right, but come straight home. Stay away from the tracks. You hear? Uh-huh. Tanya Jean Bright, say Yes maam. Cassie sounded just like her mother. Yes maam. Tiggers quick fingers went back to finding berries. Take some of mine, Laura told her. Then your mom will have plenty and you can come home with us. No! I want to fill up my own bucket by my own self. Laura pulled Cassie aside. We cant leave her by herself. We just told my dad Shell be fine, Cassie said. We can look out the bedroom window and see her. Shoot, shell be home in five minutes. Even if she stays longer, shes smart about trains and stuff. Cmon, lets go paint our nails. My mom has tons of new makeup samples too. Laura imagined herself drinking something cold and sweet inside the Brights cool, dark house. Cassies dad was at work, and her mom never interfered with girls who wanted to primp and giggle. Mrs. Bright was like an aunt to Laura. The fun kind of aunt. She fell in behind Cassie. By the time theyd made their way up the bank to the shoulder of the road, Tigger had started singing again. Her tiny voice floated behind them, growing fainter as they walked away. Laura and Cassie were at the house in two minutes, their berries sitting on the coolness of the kitchen counter. Mrs. Bright was in her bedroom, fussing over a sewing project, but Cassie stuck her head in long enough to tell her they were back. Then she brought her moms nail polish and makeup samples to the kitchen table where the lighting was good. Wash up and gimme your hand, Cassie said. After a moments hesitation, Laura obeyed. She wondered if the fruit in the Garden of Eden was the same lovely, warm shade of coral-red. Sunset Boulevard Red. Half an hour later, her nails felt weighted and conspicuous. Her skin felt coated, her pores choked with something called Sunlight Bisque Foundation. Her eyes stung from their first exposure to mascara and liner. Staring at herself in a hand mirror, she decided shed better scrub her face before her dad got a look at her. Hed say she was too young for makeup. Hed say she was just a little girl, not much older than Tigger Laura lowered the mirror. Cassie? Tig still isnt back. Oops. Wed better go get her. Cassie was halfway to the door already. Im in deep doo-doo if my mom finds out. They stepped outside, careful not to make noise and alert her mother to their exit. Once theyd reached the shoulder of the road, they ran, their sneakers making the gravel fly. There she is. Cassie pointed but didnt slow down. They closed the gap quickly as Tigger trudged toward them. Her face was filthy, and shed either spilled most of her berries or eaten them. What took you so long? Cassie asked. Ignoring Cassie, Tigger fixed her tearful blue eyes on Laura. Your dad scolded me and told me to go home. And he told the creepy man to go What creepy man? With her free hand, Tigger pushed her hair out of her eyes, leaving a purple smear on her sweaty forehead. The weirdo. Cassie gave her a skeptical look. Slattery? Yeah, right. Dont tell fibs. I dont. Lauras daddy yelled at him andTigs fingers explored higher on her head, moving faster and faster. Wheres my new hair clip? It fell out! Dont start bawling. Ill buy you another one. Cassie started finger-combing Tigs hair. Youre lucky we promised we wont blab. We wont tattle on you for staying by yourself at the berry patch. Right, Laura? Laura nodded, awed by Cassies slick shifting of the blame. As long as you dont tell Mom, youre not in trouble, Cassie said, wiping Tiggers wet cheeks. Hey, you want to try nail polish? Tiggers eyes widened. Yeah! Her cheerfulness restored, she scurried toward the house. Laura and Cassie followed at a slower pace. Close call, Cassie said in a low voice. Were still in trouble. My dad will tell your dad. Uh-oh, youre right. Cassie made a face. Well, if my folks decide Im a bad baby-sitter, maybe theyll stop making me baby-sit. The three girls trooped up the steps to the back door and into the kitchen. Tigger climbed into a chair and spread out her grubby hands for her first-ever fingernail polish. Grateful that Tig had come safely home, Laura leaned against the counter and stared out the window at the bright blue sky. A train whistle moaned in the hills. Sean must have heard it too, up at the Bennetts little lake where he hid out whenever he was afraid to go home. Shivery sadness filled her again, as lonesome as the whistle of the far-off train.          Eighteen years later The preacher was stretching out the altar call as long and thin as he could manage. If, as hed ordered, every eye was closed and every head was bowed, Laura could sneak out from her back-row seat before she got trapped in small talk with the old ladies in the pew ahead of hers. Their stale perfumes smelled as dusty as the hymnals. She sneaked a peek at the red book in the wooden rack in front of her knees. A month ago, mid-April, shed stood in the front row with a hymnal shaking in her hands as she tried to ignore the flower-covered casket a few feet away. Two days later shed flown back to Denver, unable to come to grips with her loss. Instead, shed worried about the cat shut up alone in the empty house. For a month, poor old Mikey had no company but Ardelle Bright, whod offered to stop by every day to feed him. It wasnt ideal, but hed survived. The elderly women were busy murmuring to God and wouldnt even notice if she left. Laura dug behind her for her raincoat and pulled it on, then rose from the hard wooden pew and ducked into the aisle. Pausing beside the rain-sprinkled window, she faced the graveyard. The finality of it hit her harder now than it had when Gary Bright had called with the bad news, his voice hushed and strange. Instantly, shed known someone had diedbut her mother? Impossible. Lauras eyes heated with tears. She turned away from the window and tiptoed toward the swinging door that opened on the tiny foyer. She pushed the door slowly so it wouldnt creak. And there stood Sean Halloran, looking cramped among the coat racks and the lost-and-found box and a jumble of umbrellas along the wall. His straight, shaggy hair looked windblown even in the motionless air. Although he was only hiding in the back, hed dignified his faded jeans with a white dress shirt and a necktie. His mouth still had the sarcastic little tilt that shed loved since third grade or so. She hadnt seen him since the graveyard service. Even then, at her own mothers funeral, hed made those old longings flutter inside her like angels wings. He was a charmer, after all, and the first boy shed ever kissed. She shut the door as quietly as shed opened it. What a nice surprise, she said, just above a whisper. Blame it on my weakness for older women. The old joke about their three-day age difference made her smile but also brought a pang of regret. This old woman is still on Colorado time and tired from the drive, so be nice. Ill think about it, he answered just as softly. His smile brought out pleasant crows-feet at the corners of his eyes. What time did you get in? About two in the morning. I called the house awhile ago and you didnt answer, so I figured you were here. Have you talked to anybody yet? No, I walked in late and sat in the last row. She waited for him to tease her about being late for church when she only had to cross the road. But Sean looked away, one hand fidgeting with his necktie. The preacher had worked his way up to a thunderous finish. The organist pounded out the first notes of a hymn. The service was officially over. Id like to walk you home, Sean said, not smiling anymore. We need to talk. About what? Youll find out. The door swung open. One of the elderly women exited in a cloying cloud of cheap scent. Recognition flashed in her eyes, and her red-lipsticked mouth moved in a babble of sympathy that Laura had heard all too often back in April. Everybody started by saying they were so sorry and ended with something like It must have been her time or Ill be praying for you. Nobody ever said anything original or entirely honest. Because Jess Gantt had drifted into some unorthodox beliefs, half the town thought she was new fuel on the fires of hell, but they were afraid to say it. Are you back to stay, sugar? the woman asked at the end of her sermonette. No, Im here to sort out my moms things. And youre still teaching history inwhere is it? Colorado. Thats nice, being a teacher. Youll have your whole summer free. The womans claw-like fingers clutched the sleeve of Lauras raincoat. Its a mercy the heart trouble took your mama quick before somethin terrible like cancer could take her slow. Your poor daddy too, gone so sudden. Who knows what the good Lord spared him, unless its like they say and Thank you, Mrs. Moore, Sean said, breaking the womans grip. May the good Lord spare you a slow death, too. He took Lauras hand and pulled her toward the exit. Soon, he added under his breath. She smiled a little inside. Hed always had a gift for soft-spoken, thinly veiled jabs. Youre a blessing to have home, baby, the woman called. Ill be praying for you. Thanks, Laura said, but Prospect wasnt home anymore, and she couldnt bear one more person spouting the only things that were left to say when death blew holes in sweet beliefs about a God who answered prayer. It wasnt heart trouble anyway. It was a cerebral aneurysm, out of the blue. God hadnt given her mom any last-minute chances. Seans hand released hers and settled on the small of her back. He ushered her outside, under the overhang and then down the steps and into the rain. He produced a black umbrella from somewhere and swung it over her. A gust of wind batted it off center, but he fought back and conquered. Lets get a move on, he said, glancing behind them. Whats the rush? Scared of little old ladies? Shed given him a perfect setup for another wisecrack, but he didnt answer. Unnerved by his strange urgency, she walked faster. On the hillside across the parking lot lay the graveyard where flowers had blanketed a white casket in April. If there was no life after death, her mother was only a dead body in a box. Her father was only bones that had rested at the bottom of Hamlin Lake for years now. End of story. No heaven, no hell. No Judgment Day. Gram and Poppa Flynn, buried a few feet from their daughters new grave, would have called that heresy. The wet wind slapped Lauras face like a rebuke. Running out of walkway, she stepped onto the grass and turned toward home with Sean by her side. Her heels sank into the saturated ground, its wetness seeping through the seams of the shoe leather. If her dad were alive, he would have told her to wear sensible shoes. Sunday mornings when she was a child, hed always buffed her patent-leather shoes and polished his black wingtips. Then hed walked her across the road to Sunday school, holding her hand. Back then, shed thought her parents would be around forever. Maybe that was why shed dragged herself out of bed for church. Shed unconsciously hoped the familiar setting would let her pretend for a while that her parents were with her. That they hadnt vanished into the sweet by-and-by, wherever it was. She picked up her pace. Just walk. Dont think. Just walk. Dont think. The mindless words beat in tandem with her footsteps and wrapped her in a stillness that nearly could have passed for peace. Deep inside, though, she was raw. The shock that had acted as anesthesia had worn off. Sean slid his hand to her shoulder, slowed her down, reined her in. Get back under the umbrella. You know I dont like umbrellas. I dont like you catching pneumonia. I was going to bring my truck over But the house is closer than the parking lot. I know. Im fine, Sean. She didnt want to be moved by his blunt kindness. And she certainly didnt want to be moved by his touch, but she was grateful for the warmth of his hand. She was cold. Colder than shed ever felt in Colorados snowy winters. Even in the mountains, Georgia shouldnt have been so cold in the middle of May. But maybe the chill came from the inside. They reached the grassy bank above the road and stopped where crumbling cement steps led down to the pavement. A chain of vehicles threaded through the sharp curve, held back by a slow-moving dump truck with a blue tarp billowing over its load. The truck lumbered past, splashing the bank with muddy rainwater, then disappeared around the bend with its impatient entourage of smaller vehicles. Laura glanced behind her. Umbrellas sprouted like flowers in the parking lot as people ran for their vehicles beside the little brick church. She was glad shed escaped the small talk, but whatever Sean had to say might prove harder to handle. She looked up at him against the black backdrop of his umbrella. Lines of weariness had joined the laugh lines around his eyes. She hardly knew this grown-up Sean, this somber stranger. Seeing him in a necktie took her all the way back to her dads memorial service. That was the first time shed ever seen Sean wear a tie. It was the first time shed seen him cry, too. Raised hard by a hard man, hed usually managed to hide his sorrows behind his blue-eyed devilment. With one finger, he pushed a strand of hair off her cheek. You need some sleep. She shook her head. I have too much to do. I cant sleep. Me either. His gaze darted beyond her and sharpened, wary and watchful. But there was nothing to watch in that direction. Nothing but a stand of pine trees that the kudzu would swallow before summers end. A chill hit her. The ghosts she didnt believe in were breathing down her neck again.  The latest rumor had Sean seeing things. Hearing things. The snap of a branch in the woods, a flash of brown in the green. It must have been a deer, foraging. But Laura hadnt heard anything yet. He could break it to her gently. She pulled away and shivered, her red hair frizzy from the damp. He tightened his arm around her shoulders. Lets get you home, he said. Her big tomboy feet in fancy shoes started moving down the steps, avoiding the rough spots. Her black raincoat flapped in the wind. Like all the tongues that were flapping. God help her if she heard the old biddies tall tales with no warning. Sean eased her to the left to avoid a long, green drape of kudzu at the roadside. Hanging from a sycamore and swinging in the wind, the vines were trying to grab a nearby dogwood and start devouring it, too. Years ago, Lauras father had shown Sean how a dogwood leaf broken in two would still have thin, stretchy filaments connecting the halves. Like strands of memory and fact that held past and present together, Elliott had said. They would hold for a while, but not forever. Hed been a bit of a philosopher, Lauras dad, but he hadnt always made sense. The mans lean figure drifted into Seans imagination, slipped across the road in the rain, and vanished among the trees. He missed the man and his music and his stories. Wanted him backalivebut wishful thinking couldnt raise the dead. A fresh gust of rain pecked at the umbrella. Sean hurried Laura across the pavement, onto the circle drive, and up to the little brown bungalow that sat on a small peninsula of land created by the sharp curve of the road. They clomped up the steps to the wraparound porch where the wooden swing had hung until Elliott busted it up. A couple of his Adirondack chairs sat there now, but nobody ever used them. Rain danced a jig on the tin roof of the porch as they walked around to the back door. Laura dug through her handbag, giving Sean a closeup view of those long fingers. The delicate bones of her wrists. He didnt like this business of keeping his distance. Respecting her wishes. Being the ex-boyfriend instead of the love of her life. Hed had enough of it. She drew a shaky breath that made him want to tuck her into a comfy chair with a hot toddy and a quilt. Please dont tell me Ive locked myself out, she said, still digging. Sorry, I cant find the key. He reached into his pocket. Ive got it. She looked up. Her skin was pale, with shadows under the deep-set, dark brown eyes that were so much like her mothers. You still have a key? Sure I do. Half the county has a key. Laura nearly smiled. My mom was funny about that, wasnt she? She was. Jess had been in the habit of locking herself out, so shed had extra keys made and handed them out to her friends like candy. Her personal lockout-assistance service. Sean unlocked the door, pushed it open. Leaving the umbrella dripping on the weathered planks of the porch, he followed Laura in. The kitchen smelled like a florists shop, the counters and table still crowded with potted plants from the funeral. You have enough plants to stock a nursery, he said. Tell me about it. Laura slung her raincoat over the back of a chair and bent to slip off her shoes. Ill let you keep the key, in case I lock myself out again. Just like her mom. Good idea. Hiding a smile, he nodded toward a massive, foil-covered dish almost hidden by the greenery on the counter. At least you wont starve. Ill bet Ardelle left that. She did. Its enough coffeecake to feed the whole neighborhood. Why dont you take some home? Thanks, maybe I will. Lord knows Im not much of a cook myself. Laura smoothed the skirt of her dress although it clearly didnt need smoothing. Hows everything going for you? Its crazy right now, getting ready for the festival. Once thats over, Ill get back to rehabbing the house. Funny, she said, leaning against the counter. Were both back in the houses where we grew upat least for a while. That reminds me. I heard Cassies in town too. A smile lit Lauras face. She is? Id love to see her. I guess Drew came too? Nope. Seems to be a solo trip. Cass didnt tell me shed be in town. Not that were as close as we used to be, but we do stay in touch. I hope everythings all right. Everythings fine, most likely. Anything new with Dale? He stops by a lot more often than Id like. Every time I hear that rattletrap truck pull into the drive, I look for an excuse to say I was just leaving. How are Keith and Annie? Theyre doing well, he said, remembering the message from his sister-in-law. Annie said to tell you hey. She would love to see you if you want to stop by. Laura nodded but didnt commit herself to it. The scent of the lilies on the counter reminded him of a long-ago Easter morning when Laura, wearing a new dress, stood hand in hand with her dad to sing I Know That My Redeemer Lives. Elliott was perfectly on key while Laura wasnt even close. She frowned. Whats that funny little smile for? He angled his head toward the lilies. They make me think of Easter and your dads favorite songs. She studied the flowers for a moment, then met his eyes but said nothing. He loosened his tie, tugged it off, and wound it around his hand like a bandage. You must be freezing. You want to change into dry clothes before we get into this? Because what I have to say, Lauraitll take some time. She lowered her gaze to the necktie wrapped around his hand. Okay. Ill be right back. She turned and walked into the living room. Mikey, stretched out on the couch, batted a languid paw at the hem of her dress swinging against her muscular calves, but he missed. Ignoring the cat, she headed down the hall. Except for the plants all over, Jesss kitchen looked the same as it always had when Sean had stopped by for a cup of coffee and a chat. A little neater than it used to be, maybe. Her favorite mug, the pale blue one with rainbows and angels on it, hung from the mug rack beside the coffee maker. It was odd to see her possessions all around, outliving their owner. Elliotts too, years after hed drowned. Dulcimers, mandolins, and guitars still lay around the house as if hed set them down just days before. The storm attacked the windows with fresh energy, the rain gusting sideways in belts and waves. Leaves bent backward, showing pale undersides. No birds calling. Only rain, wind, and the faint tinkling of Jesss miniature wind chimes in the backyard. The storm had draped gray swags of mist over everything, but once the weather cleared, Laura would have a good view of the family plot in the cemetery across the road. But Jesss grave was still too new to have a headstone, and Elliott had no grave. Only a bronze plaque that bore his name, a line about having served his country, and the dates of his birth and death. Sean shook his head. That was a rough summer. A strange summer. He and Laura had turned eighteen that August, but their birthdays had been lost in the turmoil and ruined by his own naivet. Trying to shut out the memories, he turned around, only to face another reminder of the past. Hed sat at the Gantts kitchen table many a time after Elliott rescued him. That wasnt too strong a word, either. Nobody else would have waded into Dales fists to save a scrawny kid from another beating. Elliott took him home that day, patched him up, and turned him over to Jess for a decent meal while Laura looked on with wide eyes. Then Social Services got involved, and everything was topsy-turvy until Dale landed behind bars somewhere and Seans grandma moved to town and took him in. He closed his eyes. How old had he been? Fourteen? And hungry for a father figure. Elliott had never been exactly stable, though. Or even quite sane. If the stories were truethe new stories that were spreading like a virus and the nightmares Sean had spun in his own head. But they couldnt be true. God, he whispered. A one-word prayer. He figured the Lord already knew the rest of it.          Laura stopped in the doorway to the kitchen. Sean, seated at the table, seemed not to notice her. While shed been changing into jeans, hed cleared a space by moving some of the plants to the floor and the wide windowsills. Drumming his fingers on the golden oak, he stared into space and frowned. Like he used to frown over her tangled geometry proofs. Once, on the porch swing, shed complained about all those aggravating angles and lines and curves in the textbook. Hed said the whole world was angles and lines and curves. Then he picked up a fallen sweet-gum leaf to illustrate his point, brushed the leaf across her cheek, and kissed her for the first time. Contacts out, glasses on, she felt like that gawky, nearsighted teenager again. Sean, though, had lost everything awkward or gangly from his teenage years. He carried himself with understated confidence. With authority. He wore his thirty years well. He looked up, eyes as blue as the sky but troubled as a storm. His fingers stilled. Feel better? Warmer, anyway. I can make you some coffee. Theres always a bag of good Costa Rican stuff in the cupboard. She smiled at his familiarity with her mothers kitchen. No, thanks, but you go ahead if you want some. He shook his head, and his hair fell into his eyes. If he didnt get a haircut soon, he would look like a wild man. He ran a finger back and forth on the table. The furniture your dad made, and his mandolins and dulcimers and all, he said, circling a knot in the wood grain. They make me remember him like it was yesterday. He did beautiful work. She sat across from him. So do you. I learned from the best. But his pleasant words didnt match his worried expression. Whats going on, Sean? Whats bothering you? Sean, whod never been afraid to speak his mind, hesitated. There have been some crazy rumors floating around. I dont believe them, but I dont want you to hear them without warning. Rumors about what? He reached across the table and covered her hands with his. A woodworkers hands, like her dads, they bore a few small scars. The quiet ticking of the clock on the wall filled the long stillness before he spoke. Have you ever heard of a man walking away from his life? Just leaving? Everybody wants to walk away sometimes. How many times did we hear Cassie say that? And she finally did, with Drew. I dont mean moving away like they didlike you did. What I mean isvanishing. On purpose. Sure, it happens. His grip tightened. Half the town is saying we might know somebody who did just that. Who? Do you remember Eric Rudolph? The bomber. The white supremacist. When Laura was a teenager, the papers had been full of him and his crimes, but she failed to see a connection between him and the sleepy little town of Prospect. She nodded though. I remember reading about him. He hid out for years. Not far from here, in North Carolina. In the same kind of terrain. The mountains are like a big food locker for a man who knows how to hunt and fish and forage. He stopped, his gaze holding hers, then went on, slowly. Some folks are saying a man can stash what hell need to survive, Sean said. Food. Clothing. Tools. Hunting and fishing gear. He makes his plans. He sets up a secret camp or two, somewhere in the wild. He gets everything ready. And then one day, a hot summer daywell, some folks say a man could fake his own drowning. The words sank like heavy stones thrown into deep, dark water. The room swirled. The mingled smells of potting soil and lilies weighed on her. Choked her. Sean receded into a black distance. Laura, do you understand what Im saying? His features swam back toward her through a dark fog. Yes. She hadnt noticed pulling her hands away, but they were in her lap, twisting around and around, shaky and cold. Her head buzzed with her old theories, the wild ones her mother had scoffed at. This was different though. It was all wrong. Im sorry, Sean said. I had to tell you before you heard it with no warning. I dont know how to say it except straight out. A few people say theyve seen him alive. Not just traces of where a mans beenthough they claim theyve seen those toobut actuallyhim. Your dad. Elliott Gantt. Older, thinner, crippled up. With long hair and a beard. It couldnt be true. Nearly twelve years had gone by since her father had vanished in the deep waters of Hamlin Lake. Eleven years, nine months, and fifteen days. Shed worked it out on the long drive from Denver. I cantthatseven if its true, even ifNo, after almost twelve years? He couldnt still be alive. Exceptthe thought rolled in her heart like thunderhe fought in Vietnam. He was trained to survive. To live off the land. Do you think theres any chance it could be true? Sean shook his head. I dont, Laura. I really dont. Its absurd. But this morning I heard another rumor and decided Id better tell you before somebody else did. Whats the new rumor? The frown lines furrowed deeper into his forehead. Remember Preston from high school? She nodded. Their biology teacher, Presto Preston had a penchant for bad puns and worse neckties, but hed been a stickler for empirical evidence. He was so rational and logical that everybody said formaldehyde ran in his veins. I saw him this morning at the Shell station, Sean said. He claimed to have seen your dad crossing the road by the old church camp on the lake, just before dawn. Preston said Wait. This morning? Preston saw him? Only hours ago? Claimed to, anyway. He said hed know your dad anywhere, the way he moved like a cat. Light on his feet. But lots of people move that way. And it wouldnt make sense for him to hide out at the camp. Thered be too many people around. How long have thesesightings been going on? The stories started a few weeks ago, after youd been home for the funeral. Why didnt you call me? I didnt want to bother you with a load of foolishness. People see things all the time. Me, Ive seen Elvis. Up in Gatlinburg. She tried to laugh, but it rang hollow. So have I. Im glad youre sensible, Laura. I was afraid youd start scouring the mountains for him. Thatd be crazy. But so was henearly. What if its all true? Ive believed crazier things. Just after it happened, I shared some wild theories with my mom. I thought maybe he nearly drowned but someone rescued him and took him off somewhere. If he was injured or had amnesia, he wouldnt have been able to reach us. What did she say to that? Laura stared at the table and relived her mothers brusque dismissal. She said I needed to stop living in a little-girl fantasy and get off to college. That week, in the strange new silence that had fallen upon their house, shed decided to go to school in Colorado, not Georgia. Shed been accepted at both schools. The last-minute scramble to change her arrangements had allowed her to escape everything. Until now. The rumors cant be true, Sean said gently. Ive talked to the sheriff, and he says theyre bogus. Nobody has a shred of hard evidence. Some people are taking it seriously, though. Doing their own investigations. The way he said some people made her skin crawl. Youre talking about Dale, arent you? After a moments silence, Sean nodded. Yeah. Hes got a bee in his bonnet. Whats he doing? Sean shrugged, as if he were trying to make light of it. I dont know exactly what hes up to, but the other day he said the best way to catch a prowler is to go on the prowl yourself. Of course Seans father would want to find her dad, if he really was out there. Just for the sick pleasure of hauling him in, displaying him like a trophy of war. Lauras throat was so dry she couldnt speak. Couldnt swallow. She lowered her head to the table and closed her eyes. The tears wouldnt come, but a horde of unwelcome thoughts did. She shoved them to the back of her mind so she couldnt hear them screaming at her. Chair legs scraped the floor. Sean walked around the table, stood behind her, and kneaded her shoulders while rain ticked at the windows and the bones of the house creaked. The oak table was cool and hard beneath her cheek. Her dad had built the table with his own handsthe hands that used to smooth her bangs from her forehead so he could plant a kiss there. And where were those hands now? Not at the bottom of the lake, after all? She straightened, her chest an aching lump of lead. I dont know what to do. Dont do anything. Theres no need. Wobbly and feeling detached from reality, Laura pushed her chair back, making Sean release her shoulders. She rose and faced him. His fingers cool as water, he brushed her hair out of her eyes as tenderly as her father used to do. What a way to come home. Buried your mama a month ago, and now folks would have you believe youre about to resurrect your daddy. But its not true, Laura. It cant be true. If it was true A sob tried to surface. She stifled it, tucking her chin down and pressing her lips together. Sean pulled her toward him, her bowed head barely touching his chest and keeping a space between them. A space between their hearts. You want me to stay awhile? he asked. No. She shook her forehead against his warmth, her glasses bumping against him. His shirt was damp with rain. She pulled away and plucked at his rain-speckled collar. Thanks, but Ill be fine. Go home, get into some dry clothes yourself. I need some time alone. To process everything. Are you sure? Im sure. She made herself smile. His frown eased away. He returned the smile, giving her a glimpse of the younger, softer Sean whod carved their initials into an old picnic table under the pavilion across the road. Remember, its a womans prerogative to change her mind about absolutely anything. The twinkle in his eyes told her exactly what he was talking about. Aching for the freedom to change her mind, to change their lives, she could only look away and hope he would understand someday. Call me anytime, day or night. He bent toward her as if he wanted to brush her temple with his lips, but then he only gave her shoulder an awkward pat and walked toward the door. Thanks for telling me whats going on, she said, following at a safe distance. Dont take any of it too seriously, now. You hear me? I hear you. All right, then. Ill see you soon. Sean made his long-legged way off the porch and down the steps, then across the road and up the bank to the church parking lot and a red pickup. She brought a hand to the hollow of her throat. It was the same 69 Ford hed bought in high school with the wages her dad had paid him. She and Sean had shared a thousand kisses in that truck. But hed sold it. When had he bought it back? When she was in town for the funeral, hed been driving a newer model. One that didnt barrage her with memories of high school and her dads drowning. A drowning that hadnt happened? She didnt want to grasp what it might mean. She leaned in the open doorway, inhaling the wet air, her ears filled with the pounding of the rain on the tin roof. She didnt let herself look at the graveyard on the hill. Sean climbed in, starting the engine even before hed slammed the door. Headlights knifed across the gray afternoon, and the truck crunched away over wet gravel. One of his brake lights was out. Hed forgotten to take his umbrella. Hed forgotten to take some of the coffeecake too. Maybe, like her, hed been thrown off balance, rattled by this strange new world where her father might yet live. She pulled the neck of her sweater higher. Closing her eyes, she listened to the storm pelting the world with rain and remembered a wet day in April when her mothers mortal remains had awaited burial under a green canopy. Green, the color of life. She closed the door and paced, her thoughts shifting like a dark kaleidoscope. Her fatherthinner than ever. Lonely, growing old, maybe half-crazybut alive? Who in town believed it? She imagined folks going home from church to eat Sunday dinner and spin yarns about a Vietnam vet flipping out and hiding in the mountains. Yarns that might be true. He had always loved Hamlin Lake. It had the best fishing in the county. It was a beautiful spot, too. Bright blue water ringed by tall pines. A convenient boat ramp. And a blacktop parking lot where hed left his truck and trailer the day his little boat drifted to shore at sunset, empty. Laura dug her phone out of her purse. She scrolled through her contacts, overshot Marsh, B., and landed on Mom. Blinking back tears, Laura stared at the familiar number. She couldnt imagine deleting it. Hardly able to read the screen, she selected Doc Marshs number. He might have some answers.  Seated at a massive antique desk in his home office, Doc Marsh resembled a younger, thinner Colonel Sanders in jeans and a flannel shirt. Once the banjo picker of her dads little band, he hadnt changed much in the twelve years since Laura had left home for college. He smiled, his brown eyes magnified behind thick lenses. Its wonderful to see you, Laura. Im glad to see you too. Especially in your home, where I know there wont be any medical procedures. He chuckled. Likewise. The phone rang in the kitchen. His wife answered it and laughed. Muffled by a closed door, her cheerful, normal voice made Laura want to cry for some old, ordinary life that shed never actually had. I hope youll stay in town long enough to enjoy the bluegrass festival, Doc said. Its not often that I drag out my banjo and play with anybody these days, but I never miss the festival. I must have a months worth of work at my moms house, so Ill be there. He put his elbows on the desk and rested his goateed chin in his hands. So will Sean. Hes quite the up-and-coming luthier. Yes, he is. Yall havent been an item for quite some time, have you? Not since we were eighteen. Im sorry it didnt work out. Hes a fine young man. He is, but put yourself in my shoes. Can you imagine Dale as your childrens grandfather? Doc shuddered as if shed made him drink one of those nasty liquid antibiotics hed prescribed for her when she was small. Id rather not imagine. He cleared his throat. Have you stayed in touch with Gary and Ardelles girls? With Cassie at least, and she always tells me Tiggers news. Did you know Tig and her husband are expecting their second baby? My, my. And she still goes by that nickname? Yes, but only the family still calls Cassie Eeyore. Sometimes she still deserves it. Doc laughed heartily, then sobered. You didnt come here for chitchat about your childhood friends, did you? No. Laura was suddenly afraid to ask the big questions. Rain dripped outside, but its steady rhythm did nothing to soothe her. Out with it, Doc said gently. Okay. Have you heard the rumors? About your daddy? She nodded with a sad smile, remembering a college roommate whod told her an educated adult shouldnt refer to her father as her daddy. The roommate had never had a southern friend before. Doc took off his black-framed glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his fingertips. Everybodys heard the rumors. Do you believe them? I dont know. Do you know if my mother believed them? He put his glasses on again. I thought this whole thing didnt start until after shed passed away. But how do we know the sightings didnt start earlier? If she knew, she might have talked it over with someone. She might have written Laura frowned. She hadnt noticed her moms journals anywhere. Making a mental note to look for them later, she went on. But Id really like to hear your thoughts about my dad. His problems. Doc nodded soberly. I thought the world of him. Some Vietnam vets get together, ride their Harleys, swap war stories, but he kept to himself. At least he never took to drinking like some folks do. PTSD plus alcohol can be a lethal combination. Youd call it PTSD, then? Im no shrink. Im just a small-town family physician. But as long as you dont quote meyes, Id guess his struggles stemmed from combat-related PTSD. Of course he steadfastly refused to be anybodys patient, ever, so he never had an official diagnosis. In my opinion, though, he suffered mental injuries that should have been treated as seriously and as respectfully as a shrapnel wound. Mental injuries that shouldnt have had a stigma attached to them. But they did, and everything might have been even harder on him because he wasnt cut out to be a soldier. And your mom wasnt cut out to be a soldiers wife. Shed married a troubadour, a musician, not a GI. Of course this happened long before you were born, but she nearly flipped her lid when he was drafted. I can imagine. When I was little, she was still pretty vocal about her antiwar beliefs. She was even more vocal before you came along. As his moods got worse, though, she learned not to throw fuel on the fire. She went from being a pacifist to being a true peacemaker, always ready with a calming word. I respected her for that. Laura nodded, remembering her moms ability to read her husbands moods. So many times, seeing him begin to react to a trigger, shed stepped in with a soft word. He would always take a deep breath. Hed swallow. Sometimes hed close his eyes as if gathering strength to battle the blackness. If shed caught him in time, hed say, Dont worry about me. Ill be all right. Or hed give her the little wink that meant the same thing. Once, though, instead of soothing him, shed blasted him with her old antiwar rhetoric when he was already on the verge of a major episode. Shed said it with such venom that Laura, eavesdropping from around the corner, had recoiled. As she tried to shrug off the rest of the ugly memory, she had to face an equally ugly fear. Are there connections between PTSD and other problems? she asked. Alzheimers, for instance? Docs sad eyes answered her question even before he spoke. We have more questions than answers. Maybe combat PTSD increases the risk for late-life dementia, or maybe PTSD is sometimes an early symptom of dementia. And if theres some family history of dementia? He frowned. Is there? Ive wondered if my Grandpa Gantt might have been in the early stages of it when he died. He seemed to beslipping. He wasnt very old, though. Sixtyish. A little younger than my dad would be now. Early onset, Doc murmured. Could be. But with your dad, we obviously dont have enough data to go on. We dont even seem to have a patient. But if by some chance he comes back, what do you think his prognosis might be? This isnt my area of expertise, so my opinion isnt worth much. Doc hesitated, fiddling with a paper clip. Lets hope for the best. Thats what people say when they expect the worst. Youve always been a perceptive young lady. Doc swiveled his chair, chose a thick book from a shelf behind him, and slid it across the desk. This book has an extensive section on PTSD and related issues. Take it home with you. It might help you get a handle on things. She took the book and stood. Thanks. Ill do that. Keep the faith, Laura. Anythings possible. And no matter how this turns out, you can be proud to be his daughter. Docs eyes were moist. Go home, put on one of those old CDs, and remember him at his best. Unable to reply at first, she clasped his hand in silence. Thank you, she managed after a moment. The rain had let up. Walking across Docs wet lawn to her car, she looked up at the mountains that formed a backdrop to the town. If her dad was up there somewhere, his fate might remain a mystery like the dead ends shed reached when she traced her genealogy. But in the long view of history, twelve years were nothing. Her dads disappearance was so recent that she might still find clues. She might even bring him home. Tears made the mountains a blue-green blur. Please, God, she whispered. Please.          Sitting on the couch while the day-long storm ran its course and ushered the dusk into full night, Sean didnt turn on a light. He preferred to sit in the shadows while he brooded over recent events. The town was no stranger to strange doings. Back in the late eighteen-twenties, Prospect had been home to miners with gold fever. North Georgias gold rush brought both craziness and prosperity. Less than a century later, Prohibition brought a different brand of insanity, and an earlier generation of Hallorans added to their already sizable fortune by selling bootleg booze to thirsty citizens, far and wide. The Halloran Building still stood on Main Street, a monument to their illegal profits and a constant humiliation to Dale, whod inherited the place and then lost it to foreclosure. Gary Bright, always quick to spot a bargain, had snatched it up. Tourism brought the money to Prospect now. Senior citizens loved the spring wildflowers and the fall colors. Bikers loved the twisty mountain roads. Families tubed the Chattahoochee River, and hordes of musicians and fans came for the three-day bluegrass fest over Memorial Day weekend. Locals always griped about the outsiders clogging the roads but never missed a chance to make a buck. But if the moneygrubbers started selling Wheres Elliott? T-shirts, Laura would be devastated. Shed loved her dad. Crackpot veteran or not, he was her father. When other kids had made fun of him, shed stuck up for him every time. Sean had helped her finish a few of those school-yard scraps. Shed mellowed, though. Shed conquered the hair-trigger temper shed had as a kid, maybe because she didnt want to be like her dad, but sometimes Sean missed the girl whod shown her raw emotions without filters. Without apologies. He checked his phone for the time. He should have been holed up in his workshop, but he just couldnt get motivated. He had a few new instruments lying around the house too, so he could break them in, but for once in his life, his fingers didnt itch to play. It all seemed so unimportant. A night creature rustled in last years fallen leaves by the side of the house. Probably one of those raccoons living in the big oak. One of the young ones was an albino. With pink eyes and a white-ringed tail, it made an eerie sight, especially on moonlit nights. A ghost raccoon. The animal outside moved closer. And coughed. Sean sat up straight. That was no raccoon. Maybe it was Dale, wanting to wheedle more money out of him. But why so quiet and sneaky this time? Why on foot? Because the house was dark. He thought nobody was home. Thought hed play burglar, maybe. Sean waited, holding his breath. The skin on the back of his neck prickled. Feet padded up the back steps, and his senses snapped to full alert. The doorknob rattled. The hinges creaked. The kitchen light came on. A knock finally came, an afterthought, not on the door but on the wall. He smiled, knowing who his visitor was. Sean? You home? He rose to his feet. Hey, Laura. Come on in. When she walked into the room, her glasses were so wet he didnt know how she could see through them. In a shabby, rain-sprinkled sweater, she looked like a lost little girl. Shed twisted her thick hair in a damp, red mess on top of her head. Reluctantly, he vetoed the idea of pulling her into his arms. Right now she needed a friend, not a pursuer. Out for a walk in the rain? he asked. Well, it had let up for a while, wasnt raining when I started. It turned loose again when I was passing Gary and Ardelles housetheir old house, I mean. I was about to run to the door when I remembered they havent lived there in a long time. I came here instead. She spun in a circle. Youve done a lot of work. It doesnt look like the same place. She was talking too fast, too brightly, in a scattered and disjointed way. It wasnt like her. Sit, he said, waving her toward the couch, hoping shed relax. And tell me again why youre walking around town in the rain. She didnt sit. I just needed time to think about thethe situation. Sure, I can understand that. You have a lot to process. This news about my dadIt changes everything. Her voice shook. Not news. Rumors. Somebody saw a man who looked a little like him, and that somebody told other people, and the story has grown out of proportion. Her eyes burned like sweet brown embers. But what if its really him? Have you thought about the implications? Implications, Sean repeated slowly, trying to imagine where she was headed with it. Well, I can imagine your dadif hes alivewould need medical care and counseling, at the very least. Thats part of it. Oh, Sean. If it wasnt an accidental drowning, if it was deliberate, it knocks my feet out from under me. I have to question everything. Sean studied her, trying to decipher her words, her expression. Hed been so focused on hard facts that he hadnt given enough thought to the questions that would spring up for anyone who chose to believe the rumors. If Laura was hurt and confused, he didnt want to make matters worse with careless words. Those are big ifs, though. A lame response but the best he could come up with. I know they are. She pushed up the ratty sleeve of her sweater to check a watch that wasnt there. Id better get going, she said in that too-cheerful way. You just got here. She smiled at him. Im tired, Sean. I didnt get to bed until three in the morning, and then I couldnt sleep. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the road in front of me. You know what I mean? His heart melted as he pictured her driving fourteen hundred miles of interstate highways alone, facing the sad task of tying up the loose ends of her mothers life. Ill give you a ride, then. Dont argue. Its still raining, and its dark out. Well. All right. Thanks. Laura wiped moisture off her cheeks. She turned and hurried into the kitchen, her shoes squeaking on the hardwood floor. Sean followed, wondering if shed wiped away tears or rain.  Laura was intensely thankful for the ride home. It would have been a dark and spooky walk past the stretch of road where they used to pick blackberries. She looked behind her when Sean turned on a floodlight that transformed the drizzle to a thousand tiny falling diamonds. He strode toward her, the wind ruffling his hair and his shadow looming large as he pulled on a flannel barn jacket. He used his remote to start the door cranking upward on the little garage that stood apart from the house. Same old truck, he said with a smile. I noticed. But didnt you sell it to the Browns years ago? I did, but hes had to give up driving. I offered him a good price, and he took it. You have a brake light out. I noticed this morning. Yeah? Thanks for telling me. One more thing on my to-do list. His garage smelled like motor oil, lumber, and paint. Laura walked past his lawn mower and a neat array of tools on pegboard. It felt wrong to go to the passenger side of the truck. Back in the day, shed climbed in through the drivers door. Theyd sat so close, shed had to crane her neck to look up at him. They climbed in simultaneously, shut their doors simultaneously. Sean turned the key. The engine roared to life, and the radio came on. No bluegrass purist, he had it tuned to raucous country-rock. Putting his arm across the back of the wide seat, he looked over his shoulder and reversed the truck into the brightly lit driveway. You still listen to that stuff? she asked. He smiled. Sure. Especially when youre here to complain about it. He lowered the volume, started the wipers, and hit the remote again. The garage door rattled shut. The truck rumbled backward down the drive, escaping the reach of the floodlight and leaving them in darkness except for the dim glow from the dash. The gas-guzzling engine sounded strong, and someone had installed a new windshield to replace the old one with its cobweb of cracks. The truck sounds good, Sean. Because it is good. Youve always been Mr. Fix-it. Had to be, he said with a laugh. True. The Hallorans had rarely had the money to buy anything new, or if theyd had it, Dale had spent it on liquor. Sean had always been so steady, though. So strong. She wanted to scoot over and lean into his solid warmth, but she kept hugging the door. He kept both hands on the wheel. Now it was too dark to see him. Too dark for him to see her, and Laura was glad. He didnt need to know what a mess she was. Neither of them spoke as he drove out of his own neighborhood and past the Brights old house, its lights glowing behind overgrown shrubs. Then, in a flash, theyd passed the old berry patch. Sean barely slowed the truck to cross the tracks at the bend of the road where town met country. In the old days, she would have sat close to him, laughing as the truck rocked over the rails and jounced her against him. Now she clung to the edge of the seat and held herself upright. He pulled the truck around the corner, more or less ignoring the stop sign. The church steeple, softly lit from below, came into view above the trees. Sean swung into the circle drive and parked in front of the house. The truck idled, deep-throated and smooth. Ill walk you to the door, Sean said. No need. Thanks, though. Got a key? In my pocket. She pulled on the door handle. Tugged harder. Nothing happened. Sticks sometimes, he said. Gotta fix that. He reached for the door, his flannel-clad arm brushing against her, his face nearly touching hers. She closed her eyes and leaned hard against the headrest. Muttering a word best left unspoken, he manhandled the latch. The door clunked open, letting in a rush of chilly air, and the dome light burned brightly against her eyelids. His breath warmed her. That meant hed turned toward her. If she tipped her head forward the least bit, her lips would touch his. But she couldnt let it start. Its good to have you home where you belong, Red. The nickname from high school jolted her eyes open. He was so close that she couldnt focus. Couldnt think. Next thing she knew, hed be calling her honey again, and sweetheart, and finally darlin, and then hed start stealing kisses and telling her he loved her. But it could never work. He drew away by a hairs breadth. Ive missed you, Laura. His low voice went rough and ragged. Ive missed you too. She wanted to hug him, but then shed start crying and never stop. Good night. Thanks for the ride. She gently pushed him away, swung her legs out, and climbed down. Wait. He leaned toward her, the strong planes of his face emphasized by the glow of the dome light. There was something youd started to tell me. The implications, you called it. You said thats part of it, but whats the rest? I dont want to say it. You can tell me. It wont go any further. I know. I know youll keep it to yourself. She hesitated, afraid shed say too much but desperate for help in carrying the burden. You remember what it was like, Sean, the night they started the search. You remember how we walked back and forth on the shore, praying and crying. She couldnt go on, but she didnt need to. The grief in his eyes mirrored the grief in her heart. Of course I remember. She took a moment to regain control, then sped through the rest of it. Was my dad out there, watching? Was he in a hideaway on the other side of the lake, maybe? Spying on us? Hoping we believed hed really drowned? No, Sean said softly. Laura, he really did drown. She knew he hoped to console her, but the strange situation had put her beyond consolation. I dont know, Sean. On one hand, I hope hes alive. I would love to have him back. I want to see his face and hear his voice and bring him home. But if hes alive, why did he do it? Why did he make Mom think she was a widow? I hate to say something so terrible, but was it some kind of cruel joke? No, Sean said again. He had his issues, but he was never cruel. No? Id almost rather believe he drowned. The words tasted like poison on her tongue. If he drowned, I can keep believing he really loved us. He did. He loved you and your mom, both. I wish I could know that for sure. Shutting the door before Sean could argue, she turned for the house and ran. She didnt know what to believe. Stepping inside, she studied the kitchen clock. A sleek, modern model, it replaced the antique her dad had shattered with a well-aimed cast-iron trivet. The argument between her parents still rang in her head like discordant bells. Her mothers voice had been brittle and angry beneath a false calm. You have blood on your hands. She hadnt spoken such inflammatory antiwar rhetoric in years. Maybe hed hit her hot button, so shed hit his, forgetting to handle him with kid gloves. Dont try to hold that over my head, hed answered. Youve been unfaithful. Dont deny it. Dont lie to me. Laura, standing in the darkness just around the corner, had held her breath and waited for her mother to offer a sensible, soothing response to his irrational accusation. But hed hurled the trivet, smashing the heirloom clock into a hundred pieces of glass and wood. Laura had let out a squeak of terror that went unheard and tiptoed away. Shed never told anyone about her dads accusation. Not even Sean. She hadnt believed a word of it at the time. She still didnt, but her father must have. Hed disappeared a month later.  Laura sat up, wide awake in the night. A pie tin was rolling down the road, clanging and clattering. No, it was only the wind chimes jangling in the backyard as the storm troubled the branch they hung from. Shed been dreaming about pies, coffeecake, and casseroles. About Ardelle and all the other hometown folks whod brought meals after the funeral, thinking good food and a hug could fix just about anything. But one wild thread of the dream included a blurry glimpse of her dad trotting down a woodland trail with his hound dog, Geezer, at his heels. She turned toward the neon-green glow of the digital alarm clock, a fuzzy rectangle of light, and squinted. Ten minutes past three. Lowering her head to the pillow, she curled into a ball and tucked her flannel nightgown around her icy feet. Between snatches of sleep, shed spent the night plagued with vivid memories of her dad and his buddy, Gary Bright. With their blue eyes, narrow faces, and sandy-blond hair, theyd always looked like brothers. Theyd been as close as brothers too, since their days together at Prospect Elementary. Gary was like family, still. If anybody could help her sort out the truth, Cassies dad could. He might be as skeptical as Sean, though. Something knocked softly in the night. Knuckles rapping on the back door? A silly notion, but she lifted her head from the pillow and listened, her skin prickling. Nothing but wind. Branches bumping each other. One storm had passed, and another one was moving in. That was all. She tugged the blanket more snugly around her neck. A soft thud met her earsand then a faint meow. That thud, at least, was only Mikey, probably jumping down from the table he knew was forbidden territory. The poor old kitty slept most of the day and roamed the house at night, wanting to escape to the great outdoors. He must have been going stir-crazy all month, cooped up by himself except for Ardelles daily visits. With a vague thought of fixing a hot drink to settle her nerves, Laura threw back the covers and swung her feet to the cold hardwood floor. The furniture hadnt been rearranged in years. Every time she came home, she prided herself in finding her way through the house in the dark. She could even brew tea without turning on a light. By moonlight, Laura found her glasses and thick socks, then made her way into the living room to fetch the small quilt that lay folded across the back of the couch. Wrapping the quilt around her shoulders, she headed for the kitchen. She still didnt want to turn on a light. Just in case somebody was out there. Silly, maybe, but shed learned caution when she was a young girl and a prowler had roamed the town, tossing pebbles at window screens. Time to lock and load, her dad had said. Theyd all breathed easier when the Peeping Tom turned out to be Slattery. An oddball, but harmless. Still, Laura had felt safer once hed skipped town. Now was her dad a prowler? An oddball, but harmless. Thats what everybody would say. It hurt to think of people putting him in Slatterys categorysick, dirty, twistedwhen her dad had always been upright and honorable. The kitchen smelled like potting soil and flowers, earthy and flowery at the same time. Like shed always imagined Eden. Recalling what Sean had said about the lilies, she closed her eyes, going back to long-ago Easters with her parents and both sets of grandparents. Her mom always put fresh flowers on the table, and she gave Laura the job of scattering candy-coated Jordan almonds across the white tablecloth like pastel confetti. Every year, her dad began their feast by reading a few Bible verses aloud. Shed loved to inhale the heavenly aromasroasted lamb, scalloped potatoes, homemade rollswhile he read the amazing story. An angel. An empty tomb. The grave clothes, abandoned. Then the best part: He is not here; He has risen! It was the best twist ever, the happiest, craziest surprise ending. It always made her want to stand up and cheer, but shed only wiggled on her chair and tried mightily not to sneak any more of the candy-coated almonds. After dinner, it was time to hunt for Easter eggs and candy. All the loot was hers because she was the only child, the only grandchild. While the grownups sat and talked, she listened quietly and enjoyed her haul. The day seemed to be wrapped up in a big, loud Alleluia because her dad kept singing under his breath: Christ the Lord is risen today, alleluia! Sons of men and angels say Laura opened her eyes and faced the present. Her whole family was gone. She was the only one left. Leaning against the counter while Mikey butted his scruffy head against her ankle, she looked out the window above the sink. It had no blinds to cover it, its only dressing a lacy white valance. A fast-moving cloud drifted onto the half moon like a blanket that a child held up to his face to play peekaboo. Within moments, the cloud scudded past. Her dad might be somewhere out there, under that cold sky. Homeless by choice. With no blanket, no bed, no roof, hed be freezing. And crippled? Sean had said something about that. Crippled, freezingand maybe not quite right in the headbut alive. Lauras breath came faster at the thought. She shifted her gaze from the bare-faced moon to the moon-silvered road. Her heart crashed against her ribs. A spot of blackness in the night, a swift-moving figure swept out of the yard, across the road, and up the hill to disappear in the shadows of the graveyard. She strained her eyes, but ithe?had vanished. Her dad? No, that was crazy. If it was her dad, and he wanted to see her, surely he would knock on the door and call her name. He wouldnt creep around in the night like a criminal. Laura dropped the quilt. Nearly tripping on the startled cat, she ran to the back door and checked to be sure it was locked. She wedged a chair under the doorknob, then felt her way through the darkness to the front door to do the same thing there. Making the rounds of the house, she locked the windows, even the small, high one in the bathroom, and drew the drapes and blinds tightly shut. Last, she opened the door on the colder air of her parents room. Moonlight shone on the massive, hand-carved headboard that the young Elliott Gantt had made for his bride. Laura dealt with the bedroom window and returned to the kitchen, trying to decide what to do. She didnt want to sic the sheriffs department on her prowler, in case he was her dad, and she didnt want to call Sean the skeptic, especially at three in the morning. She only wanted to communicate with her long-lost father. She crossed her arms, rubbed her hands up and down on her shoulders, and closed her eyes. Then, holding her hands still, she pretended her dads hands were gently resting on hers. She imagined him giving them a squeeze and asking her a teasing question. So, Laura girl, you think you deserve some answers? I sure do, she whispered. Where are you? What happened, really? In this very room, the night before his last fishing trip, shed told him, Good night, good luck, I love you. Hed kissed her forehead and said, Good night. I love you too. Always. Always. It wasnt something he usually tacked onto his I love you. Once his boat turned up empty, shed attached special significance to that word. Shed wondered if hed had a premonition of his death. Now it seemed possible that hed known he was saying good-bye for the rest of his life. Energized by the idea that it was at least possible that he was her prowler, she turned on the kitchen light. She found a blank sheet of paper and a wide-tipped marker so she could write a note in large letters, legible from a distance. Pacing the floor while Mikey watched from his refuge under the hutch, she pondered one message after another. Dad, I still love you, no matter what. I know why you stopped loving Mom, but did you stop loving me too? Or simply: Daddy, why? If she didnt know what to believe about him, she certainly didnt know what to write. And maybe he was long dead, and her prowler wasnt anybody shed want to welcome. Laura abandoned the blank paper on the table. Leaving the porch light on, she walked back through the shadowed rooms and climbed into bed. With the covers pulled up to her chin, she lay there, remembering so much shed never told anyone. Not even Sean. Especially not Sean. Hed loved her parents so much. Telling him what shed overheard would only break his heart. Shed done too much of that already.          Cassie slogged into the gorgeous, unfamiliar kitchen and avoided looking at the clock. The sunshine pouring through the windows told her all she needed to know. Her mom never used to sleep late. It was still too early to call Drew. The three-hour time difference made it hard to find time to talk, just when Cassie had so much to say. She should probably save most of it until she got home, though. Shed have to look him in the eye when she said it. In the dining room, her dad adjusted his tie, using the glass doors of a huge, brand-new china cabinet as his mirror. Gary Bright, hotshot investor and the best dad in the world, had gained weight but only enough to make him look well-fed and prosperous. A fat cat is a happy cat, he liked to say. But shed seldom seen him look so worried. He noticed her and gave her his typical goofy grin. Mornin, glory. Mornin, Dad. Youre still here? Yes, but Ive been working since the crack of dawn. Now Im off to an appointment in town. He tucked his crisp white shirt more snugly into his khakis. Moms still in bed? He nodded, and the worry returned to his eyes. Cassie spoke softly even though she knew her mom was on the opposite end of the sprawling house. Maybe youre worried about nothing. Maybe she just needs more sleep for some reason. And shes always been a neat freak. Shoot, she used to make me and Tig make our beds at five in the morning when we were leaving on vacation. Remember? He laughed. I sure do. Well, keep an eye on her and let me know. Oh, Tig called an hour ago. Theyll come over after Trevor gets out of school. Great. Cassie slumped into a chair at the table. She loved her kid sisters perfect family, but sometimes Tom, Tigger, and Trevor were just too cute, right down to their matchy-matchy initials. With another baby on the way, they were already hunting through the T section of the baby-names book. Baby Number Two was a girl, of course. Exactly what theyd prayed for. Her dad eyed her. Got up on the wrong side of the bed, Eeyore? Always. Cassie yawned. Does Tigger have to come over every single day Im in town? Yes. She has missed you since the day you ran off with Drew. We didnt run off. We thoughtfully spared you the expense of a fancy wedding so youd have more money to blow on Tigs. He chuckled. That was so kind of you. It was, wasnt it? By the way, Ive missed her too. Im not a cold-hearted monster. No, he said in a dry tone. Youre a warm-hearted monster. Thats me. She squinted across the room at the coffee maker. The newfangled type, it made one cup at a time. You feel like making me some coffee? Sure. Frowning again, he stuck a coffee pack into the machine and pulled a brand-new mug out of the cupboard. Everything in the house was new. Even the table. Cassie missed the old, scratched one shed grown up with. She preferred their old house down in town too. This custom-built ranch on a hill looked like a model home, decorated by strangers. Sterile. Soulless. Do you ever miss the old house? she asked. The one where I had to hack at the kudzu with a machete every year to keep it from swallowing the backyard? The one where you had to put your conversation on hold every time a train came by because you couldnt hear yourself think? Yeah, that one. No, I dont miss it. Not one bit. Cassie sighed. It was silly to prefer the old, cramped kitchen to this new marvel of granite countertops and the latest appliances. It was silly to prefer the old viewof basically nothingto a stunning expanse of smoky-green mountains. And it was ridiculous to miss the old house, where passing trains rattled the windows. Where friends might knock on the door and walk right in. Shed been in town for three days, and except for Drews parents, not one soul had dropped by. Not her friends. Not her parents friends. If the UPS driver hadnt brought a package, nobody but family would have driven up and down that long driveway in days. Maybe her dads new prosperity had scared everybody away. He moved behind her and started massaging her shoulders. Its great to have you home, baby. Thanks for making the trip. Thanks for paying for it, but I still think youre exaggerating the problem. Cassie let her head droop forward. I still think Im not. He moved the massage upward. Your neck muscles are tight as a drum. See, you needed to get away. To play shrink for Mom? Its hardly relaxing. Im not asking you to play shrink. Im only asking you to pay attention. And see if you can get her to open up. But that doesnt mean you cant get out and visit your friends. Cassie perked up. Laura just got into town, right? Thats what I heard. Ill call her. She might need some help sorting through her moms things. No doubt. Jess lived in that house for thirty-some years and never threw anything out. Yes, but at least her house looked like her. The dig went unnoticed. Or maybe not, because he stopped the massage abruptly and walked over to the window, hands in his pockets. He started whistling, so she couldnt have hurt his feelings too badly. Cassie sat up straight and idly picked up the month-old newspaper that lay on the table, neatly folded to reveal the obituary. Her dad had mentioned it when hed called to ask her to fly home for a while. It worried him, the way her mom had left the paper there, day after day. Cassie had to admit that was a bit strange, but the suddenness of Jesss death must have made a hard blow even harder. Silently, Cassie read the obituary one more time. Jessamyn Flynn Gantt is survived by her daughter, Laura Gantt of Denver, and was preceded in death by her husband, Elliott Gantt; by her parents, Hollis and Laura Flynn; by a brother, Robert Flynn Some people would have argued that Elliott hadnt preceded Jess, but Cassie didnt want to believe it. Why didnt you call me when the rumors about Elliott first started? she asked her dad. He turned from the window. Same reason I didnt call Laura. Its all hogwash. Thats what I think too. Rumors are like tumors. Theyll spread in a hurry if you dont take care of them. He shook his head. Poor old Elliott. He hated himself for those black fits that made Jess and Laura so miserable. If hed lived longer, he might have done worse. God rest his soul. Yeah, it was hard on everybody. Especially Laura. He brought the coffee to the table. I just hope she wont hear the jokes. People say hell be Prospects new tourist attraction. You know, like some towns brag about sightings of Sasquatch or aliens? They say Elliotts our claim to fame. Thats horrible. People can be so cruel. He cant be alive, though. He must have had a heart attack or something while he was fishing. And if thats what happened, at least his last day on earth was a reasonably happy one. Id almost rather believe that than imagine my buddy hiding in the hills, half-starved, while people stuff their faces at the diner and gossip about him. Me too. Still, Cassie wished she could believe Elliott was back, for Lauras sake. But he wasnt. Elliott and his little band had been a crowd favorite from the earliest years of the festival, their toes tapping as they played and sang. Hed often switch instruments between songs, going from fiddle to mandolin, or from mandolin to guitar. He could playand buildall those instruments. Laura had been so proud of him. So loyal in spite of his problems. So crushed when he drowned. Shed be crushed all over again if she let herself start believing the rumors. Cassie rested her head on the table, her eyelids as heavy as her heart, and wished she were home with Drew. With no worries but the bills. The bills came in faster than the money, though. At this rate theyd never be able to start a family. Not in California, anyway. Somebody should have warned her that marriage wouldnt be all moonlight and roses. Some days, as much as she loved Drew, marriage was the hardest job shed ever had. But Laura probably envied her just for being married. Lauras life hadnt turned out as planned either. When they were sixteen or so, shed thought she would go to UGA and come right back to Prospect to teach school. And marry Sean, of course. That was a given. That was the foundation of her other dreams and his too, until she went and broke his heart. But even if theyd married, they would have learned soon enough that the starry-eyed phase couldnt last. Id better get out of here. Her dad was juggling two briefcases and a travel mug. Get the door for me, Cass? Say, one of my third-floor apartments will be vacant in a few days. Ill give you the nickel tour before the new tenant moves in. Not especially interested in the apartments in the renovated Halloran Building, she took a careful slurp of hot coffee before she spoke. Ive seen them before. Years ago. Yeah, but I like to show em off whenever I can, he said with a grin. She opened the door for him and socked his shoulder. Youre worse than Trevor with a new toy. Okay, fine. Let me know when. Moments after hed walked out, her phone rang. She braced herself for a too-cheery conversation with Tigger, whod be calling to announce her ETA, but caller ID showed Lauras number. Hey, girl, Cassie said. Can you believe were both in town at the same time? We have to get together. Absolutely. But Laura sounded rushed and abrupt. Im going out to the old cabin this afternoon. Will you come with me? I want company while I poke around. Sure. Tigs coming over, but she can visit with my mom until I get back. Poking around wont take all day, will it? It probably wont. Laura still didnt sound quite like herself. Wear jeans and boots, okay? There might be snakes. Ill pick you up in a little while. Cant wait to see you. Same here, Cassie said. Were in the new house now. Just outside of town, remember? I remember. See you soon, Cass. Cassie walked to the living room window that looked out on Prospect far below. Beyond the neat grid of downtown streets, beyond the new houses in the hills outside the city limits, lay the remains of the Gantt homestead. Laura hadnt mentioned the purpose of her trip to the old ruin, but Cassie knew.  Sean locked up the workshop and led Gary across the back lawn, past budding azaleas and a few late daffodils that the previous owners must have planted. Ill tackle the yard work as soon as I can, Sean said. Seems like spring barely got here, but summers already knockin at the door. The yardll look great in no time, Gary said, slapping Seans shoulder. All those perennials and flowering bushes will appeal to gardeners. Azaleas, rhododendrons, hydrangeasyou have everything, dont you? I guess so. But if they werent in bloom, Sean couldnt tell one bush from another. Its a dandy little workshop too. Elliott would have been green with envy, boy. Boy. Dale always used the word with contempt. For Gary, it was just part of his genial, I-love-everybody attitude. Sean shot him a quick look, realizing hed spoken of Elliott the way a sane person wouldas if he was a dead man. Still think the rumors are bunk, Gary? Absolutely. Do you know if Lauras heard them yet? I told her, just yesterday. She didnt know what to think. Its a tough time for her. Gary shook his head. SoArdelles timing is lousy, but she wants to invite both of you to our grandsons birthday party. Trevor turns five next week, and shes throwing a party on Saturday night. Party hats and pin the tail on the donkey? That kind of party? No, thank God. Tiggers throwing a kids party on a different day. This is the one where the grandparents pick the menu and overindulge the kid in stuff he doesnt need. Cassies in town, and Im sure shed love to see both of you. Drew didnt come? No, just Cass. Shes laid off, actually, and sheshe wanted some time with the family. Gary looked away for a moment, frowning into the sun, then smiled at Sean. You know you want to come. Sure I do. You and Laura dont mind hanging out together? I dont, anyway. All right, then. You can expect an official invitation soon, probably via her. Great. But the sympathy on Garys face made Sean wonder if the whole world could see his heart on his sleeve. He supposed they all knew why he hated birthdays. Shrugging it off, he opened the back door and waved Gary into the kitchen. Sorry I didnt clean up the mess. I didnt know youd be available so soon. This isnt a mess. Its progress. Nodding with satisfaction, Gary looked around the half-painted kitchen, cluttered with tools, masking tape, and cartons of tile to go on the floor later. He chuckled at the crayon scribbles on the wallsThe last owners really left their mark, didnt they?and cast a critical eye at the cupboard door that had sagged since Sean was a kid. Gotta fix that, Sean said. All in good time. You cant fix everything at once. Gary wandered into the living room, where light streamed in through bare windows. Heavy drapes had covered the windows sixteen years before, when social workers stopped by unannounced. When Dale moved to the state pen for a few years, hed probably been exposed to more sunshine than hed ever allowed in his own home. Sean ran his fingers over the smoothness of the newly painted wall. When he was eight or nine, his mom wanted to get rid of the ugly, outdated wallpaper. Shed pulled off only one narrow strip before Dale stopped her. It stayed that way for years, a jagged ribbon of off-white in a room where everything else was dark: wallpaper, carpet, furniture, drapes. The house had its first breath of fresh air when the bank foreclosed on it and sold it to the Clawsons, who sold it to the family of wall-scribblers. Sean bought it in February, with Gary acting as broker. They used the same bank that had foreclosed on Dales loan. Elliott had been a surrogate father, but Gary was like an uncle. Hed offered plenty of practical help through the years, including cash, but he never let Dale get wind of it. Gary had said he didnt want to be paid back. Pass it on to someone else, he always said. Pay it forward. Gary continued his walk-through, checking out the bedrooms and the bathrooms too, and returned to the kitchen. Its a pretty little house, and its solid. Seems premature to sell, though. Except for the workshop, youve barely started the renovations. The workshop had to come first. Now you get to the rest of the house and youwhat? Decide it isnt worth the trouble? When I was a kid, I dreamed about kicking Dale out and making the house the way my mom wanted it. I thought it could somehowundo the damage. As if fixing up a house could fix the past. It doesnt work that way. Mad at himself for being motivated by emotions instead of common sense, he shook his head. I just want out. But youve set up the perfect little shop out back. Why let it go? Most places, the zoning rules wont even let you run a business from your home. I know. And youll get a far better price if you finish the renovations. I know. But you still want out in a hurry? Why? As Sean looked around the room, he realized hed hunched his shoulders and balled his hands into fists. His old defensive stance. He straightened his posture and flexed his fingers. No matter what I do to the place, I wont be able to get rid of Dales stench. I dont mean that literally, but you know what I mean. I do, but youre the king of the castle now. You make the rules. You create the atmosphere. But if you cant stand to keep the place, you could put just a little more work into it and turn a nice profit. Ill list it right now if you want me to, but Ive never known you to quit in the middle of a project. Ive never tackled a project as tough as this one, Sean said. I remember you tried to talk me out of buying it. I should have listened. Youve never steered me wrong. Oh, I doubt that. No, youve never let me down. I wouldnt have survived without you and Ardelle. Elliott and Jess. Keith. My grandma. Gary laughed out loud. Not to mention social services, a couple of churches, and probably the PTA. Sean laughed too, but he felt like a charity case. I cant argue with that. Whats this? Gary moved over to the couch where that pretty little F-style mandolin lay, its carved top of Sitka spruce gleaming like gold against the rich blue lining of the case. He pulled it out, his big hands dwarfing the slender neck. How much for this little beauty? Brace yourself. Its my best piece yet. Gary plucked a string, the sound a tiny, unpracticed sample of the mandolins potential in the hands of a good picker. How much? Sean couldnt keep the smile off his lips. About three grand. Yowee. As gently as if it were a newborn babe, Gary tucked the mandolin back in its case. You sell many at that price? No, most of em are built and priced for casual musicians. This ones a custom job for a pro in Nashville. Hes picking it up later this week. Gibby Sprague? Not this time. This ones for a session musician. Gibby buys from me now and then, though. Will he be in town for the festival? He hasnt missed one yet. Think he knows Jess passed away? Laura must have told him. He and Elliott were pretty tight for a while. Gary ran a finger over the smooth wood of the mandolin. Elliott would have been proud of you. The apprentice has surpassed the master. Sean shook his head. Im just starting to learn what I need to learn. Youre too modest. Gary walked to the door. About the house, you want me to go ahead and run the comps so we can talk about price? No, I hate to waste your time with it. It wouldnt be a waste, but I hope youll finish overhauling the place first. Why dont you sleep on it and let me know. Will do. Thanks for doing the walk-through. My pleasure. Gary stepped outside, scaring a mourning dove out of the bushes in a flurry of whistling wings. As Garys gleaming black Cadillac disappeared around the corner, Sean remained in the doorway, thinking. If he told Laura hed heard about the party, she would feel obligated to include him in the invitation. If he kept quiet, shed be free to decline the invitation or accept it. With or without mentioning it to him. Funny, how a kindergartners birthday party could be fraught with such significance. Back in the living room, he picked up the mandolin and tweaked the tuning to perfection. Elliott had taught him that, along with a million other things. A good man, Elliott Gantt. Hed had his moods, but hed loved his family and friends. Loved them with his whole heart. Sean had envied Jess and Laura, except when Elliotts temper got loose. But the man had never laid a hand on anybody but Dale, whod richly deserved it. And Gary, Sean corrected himself. Just once. Gary hadnt deserved it. Hed never been anything but a loyal and supportive friend to Elliott. Sean closed his eyes, turning his fingers loose on the sweet-sounding strings. A little one-man jam session. Before he knew it, he was playing one of the tunes Elliott taught him. Elliott had loved old songs and poems and stories. Hed often used archaic words just for the fun of it. After a while, the quaint speech had become his unconscious habit even in everyday conversation. As Sean started humming along, the lyrics came to him.  Many a one for him makes moan, But none shall ken where he is gone. Oer his white bones, when they are bare, The wind shall blow forever mair.  Sean couldnt help but wonder how many skeletons lay at the bottom of how many deep lakes across the county, across the state, across the country. He returned the mandolin to its case. All the music had just gone out of the morning.          Laura and Cassie exited the convenience store, Laura with peach iced tea and Cassie with her old favorite, an orangesicle slushie. With her first sip, Laura recalled her hankering for a hot drink in the middle of the nightand the tall, lean figure sweeping across the yard in the moonlight. Thanks, Cassie said. Next time its on me. Youre welcome. Laura climbed behind the wheel and carefully fitted her plastic cup into the cup holder. Its great to see your face again. How long has it been since we were both home at the same time? Three or four years, probably. I dont remember. Its funny. Every time I come home, I remember why I was so desperate to leave. But I also remember how much I love the place. Me too. Laura backed the car out of its space, headed for the road, and glanced over at Cassie. Her hair was lighter than it used to be. Whether it was bottle-bleached or bleached by the California sun, it would be a different shade and style in a few months. Cassie had always had fun with her hair. That nail polish is a pretty color, Laura said. Reminds me of Sunset Boulevard Red. The name didnt seem to jog Cassies memory. I dont know what the shades called, she said, examining her nails. I borrowed it from my moms bathroom. Like old times. Remember the day we left Tigger by the tracks and ran off to play with nail polish and makeup? Yeah, not ten minutes after we told your dad wed keep an eye on her. I guess he never snitched on us, because my folks didnt come crashing down on my head. My dad threw a fit, though. Not because we left Tighe never mentioned that partbut because I came home wearing nail polish. Parents never make sense. Cassie fiddled with the air conditioning. Do you mind if I crank up the air? Go ahead. I cant believe how hot and humid it is. Yesterday was so cold and rainy. Thats north Georgia for ya. Cassie turned the fan on, full blast, then took a slurp of her slushie. Once Laura was on the main road heading out of town, she stole another glance at Cassie. She looked as cheerful as could be expected for a girl who had once deserved to be called Eeyore. Maybe Sean was right and everything was fine between her and Drew, but it wouldnt hurt to ask. Cassie could handle frank questions. Everything okay out in California? Cassie let out a little snort. Yeah, except I got laid off. We love living there, but we can barely afford it even on two incomes. Im sorry about your job. That stinks. Something will turn up. Laura nodded, remembering Cassies old dream of being a stylist to the stars. Instead, shed bounced from one job to another because she had an uncanny talent for finding work with businesses that were about to go under. Hairstylistbut not to the stars. Waitress. Admin. Day-care worker. Meanwhile, Drews techie start-up company wasnt bringing in much money yet. He probably couldnt take any time off, while Cassie had all the time in the world. I hope youll have a nice visit with your folks, Laura said. Its not exactly a pleasure trip, Cassie said. My dad asked me to come. He says theres something wrong with my mom. Lauras heart plummeted as dire possibilities ran through her mind. Some debilitating disease like Parkinsons or MS. Cancer. Alzheimers. What do you mean? I wish I knew. Shes always been a neat freak, but Dads afraid shes going all OCD on us. Or maybe shes depressed. He cant get anything out of her. So Im here for a couple of weeks to help him figure out whats going on. Without letting Mom know thats why Im here. Cassie made a face. Its loads of fun. Im sorry, Cass. When did your dad start noticing a change? Around the time of your moms funeral. Makes sense. They were best friends. Only in Ardelles mind. Laura couldnt say it out loud, but her mom had never seen Ardelle as a bosom buddy. Their longstanding friendship had been lopsided. Do you see the same things that are worrying your dad? Cassie shrugged. So far, I dont see much of a problem except the uber-neatness, but shes always been that way. You know, wiping down the counters all the time and making sure the corners of the napkins match up exactly when she folds them. Thats nothing new. On the other hand, shes allfidgety, and she has this new habit of repeating herself. Like she cant remember what she said already? No, she remembers. Its more like shell start talking about something and then she just cant leave it alone. Shell come back to it over and over, using the same words. Its likelike picking at a scab. I wonder if this is related, Laura said slowly. I noticed she went to extremes when she was watching the house for me. I only asked her to take care of the basics like the mail and the cat and the houseplants, but she vacuumed and dusted and straightened. All over the house. In rooms she didnt need to go into. But is that OCD behavior, or is it just a bored grandma with too much time on her hands? Cassie said, apparently asking herself as much as Laura. Anyway, Ill find a way to bring it up. Delicately. No, dont. Now that Im in town, it doesnt matter anyway. She wont need to pop in anymore. Youre right. Cassie squirmed around in her seat to face Laura. Okey-doke. My tough subjects out of the way. Time for yours. Do you think your dad is at the cabin? Hearing it spoken aloud made Lauras heart lurch. I can always count on you to be blunt. She sighed. I dont know, but I have a few reasons to think there might be some truth to the rumors. Like what? For one thing, Ive started wondering why my mom hung on to my grandparents property and paid taxes on it all these years. She should have sold it. You think she kept it so your dad would have a place to go? Maybe. Or she thought shed get a better price if she waited. I dont know. Laura swung the car wide to give room to an old woman picking her way through the roadside weeds. Frail as a spider, the woman held a faded blue parasol upright above her head. Granny Colfax, Laura said, glad for the distraction. I cant believe shes still alive and kicking. Me either. Nobodys granny, everybodys granny, Ruby Pearl Colfax knew everybody and their business and didnt hesitate to express her opinions. Laura had always tried to give her a wide berth, but her parents had loved Granny, so it hadnt been easy to avoid her. Does she still live in that teeny-tiny house on the west side? Cassie asked. Your guess is as good as mine. I havent been around much either. No idea what shes doing out here. Last in line at a red light down the road, Laura checked the mirror for the gray-blue of the parasol, but the shoulder lay empty, edged with green brush and trees. Such an old woman to be walking alone in the boonies, although it wouldnt be the boonies for long. Prospect was sprawling in all directions, with new homes going up as fast as the builders could tuck them into hollows and scatter them across hilltops. Many of the For Sale signs bore Gary Brights picture and his corny slogan: The Bright team, prospecting for a bright future in Prospect, Georgia. Good old Gary. He was rolling in dough. Hed earned it. The light turned green, and half a dozen vehicles crawled forward with Lauras in the rear. When shed left for college, the road hadnt had any traffic lights. It wasnt even paved, and thered been more cows than houses. Just in time, she spotted the wrought-iron post, minus its mailbox for years now. She braked sharply. Cassie shrieked and steadied both drinks as Laura swung the car into the driveway of the old Gantt home place. The tires crushed masses of kudzu that blanketed the gravel. Long stretches of vacant land on either side of the property separated the cabin from its nearest neighbors, and a newly plowed field lay across the road. Vines engulfed the tiny log home where her dad grew up. The roof sagged. The windows were black voids with no glass in them, curtained with big, heart-shaped leaves. If the barn and the shed still stood behind the house, theyd been buried too. Wow, Cassie breathed. It just hit me. This is all yours now. Youre rich, girl. Well, not exactly rich, but you do own some property. Its just starting to sink in, Laura said, careful to keep her voice on an even keel. Shed inherited everything, of course. Her moms personal effects. Her SUV. Her bank accounts. Her house and this property that had belonged to Grandma and Grandpa Gantt. But the cluttered bungalow was desolate and empty without her mom there, and this tumble-down cabin was a sad reminder that time had claimed her dad and his parents too. Sure, she was rich in terms of real estate, but in terms of family, she was flat broke. She had nobody. Battling a wave of loneliness, she climbed out of the car and faced midday heat that made yesterdays cold rain seem like a bad dream. She didnt know what she hopedor fearedshe would find under that ruined roof or in the outbuildings, if they still stood. Everything, even her grandmas red roses, had disappeared under those greedy vines. Theres nothing left to do but bring in a bulldozer, Cassie said. Nobodys been inside lately, thats for sure. You cant even see the porch steps. I have an old photo of this place when it was new, with Grandpa and Grandma Gantt standing on the steps, a little black dog sitting beside them. They must have been in their early twenties or so. Thats cool. Yes, Mom gave me all the old pictures from the Gantt side of the family a few years ago. Once I find the Flynn pictures, Ill put everything together in an album. Just dont get obsessed with it like my moms obsessed with her scrapbooks. Settling things up here before school startsI dont have time to get obsessed. Later, maybe. I do love digging into family history. Part of being a history teacher, I guess. History geek, you mean, Cassie said with a smile. Laura smiled too and started walking. Lets poke around a little. Thats why we came. Yeah, terrific. Laura led the way to the side of the cabin. Wishing she had a long, strong stick, she gingerly parted the curtain of leaves to peer through a window that long ago lost its glass. The interior was smothered in greenery too. Nobody in his right mind would hide out here, Cassie said. But my dad isnt necessarily in his right mind. He wasnt stupid, though. Hes not here, Laura. He might have been, not long ago. Kudzu grows incredibly fast. It could have covered up any signs that somebody has been here. Youre dreaming. This spot isnt very secluded anymore. People drive past all the time, especially with my dad putting in a new subdivision just around the bend. Cassie held up a finger. Listen. Beyond the bees droning nearby, heavy equipment growled from farther down the road. Metal clanked on metal. Men shouted at each other, their voices softened by distance. Your dads doing quite well, isnt he? He sure is. Cassie made a face. I wish itd rub off on me. Maybe hell want to buy this acreage too. Ill sell it, sooner or later. Just dont sell your moms house. Its too cute. The perfect size for starting a family too, Cassie said. Laura laughed. You and Drew want to buy it? Ill give you a great deal. I wish. No, youd better hang on to it. You never know when you might need it. Laura ignored the comment. They tromped around to the front of the cabin. Cassie groaned and pointed toward the road. Watch out. Here comes the old busybody. Moving with eerie grace, Granny Colfax held her parasol as level as water. Like a neighbor whod been invited for tea, she turned into the driveway, never slowing her pace. The parasol was sun-faded and threadbare. It must have been fifty years oldnobody used parasols anymoreand Granny must have been ninety. She was thin as a witch. She came closer, her feet moving relentlessly in red sneakers with the toes cut out. A pale echo of the blue sky, her parasol never wavered. Hey there, Laura called. You picked a warm day for a walk. Yall ought to be ashamed, Granny scolded. Traipsing on other folks land. Snooping in other folks houses. This was my grandparents place, Laura said. I know you. Youre Granny Colfax. Grannys deep-set blue eyes drilled into Laura. Cant a body be decent and let a house die in peace? Was she deaf? My grandparents lived here years ago, Laura said, raising her voice. You dont own this land, missy. Yes, I do. She was nearly shouting. It belonged to my grandparents. The Gantts. Im Laura Gantt. Whats that you say? Gantt? Grannys eyes softened. Oh, that red hair. Lord, have mercy. Would you be Jessamyns girl? A lump rose in Lauras throat. Yes, and this is Cassie Cutler. Gary and Ardelle Brights daughter. Granny paid no attention to Cassie. Land sakes, Im sorry about your mother, child. And I still miss your old granny too. She was a fine lady. A strong one. Strong as an ox and stubborn too. You find a lifelong friend like that, honey, you hang onto her. Laura gestured toward Cassie. Ive found one. Ha! You aint lived enough years to know what lifelong means. Granny came closer, smelling like soap. Honest, cleanand astringent. Laura licked her lips, tasting sweat and dust, and felt unreasonable anger rising up against the old woman who was, after all, a trespasser herself. What are you doing here? Laura asked. Oh, I do like to forage. Theres something in every season. Greens and nuts and berries. The old berry patch near the railroad tracks, that was the best one. Remember? Yall used to pick there. Cassie finally chimed in. Yes, we did. Granny faced her. Whats the name of your little sister, girl? Tanya. But everybody calls her Tigger. She married Tom McTavish. Well, aint that nice. And you skedaddled for the West Coast, didnt you? But youre back. Nobody ever stays away if they have any sense. This is the best place on earth. Cassies eyes narrowed. Easy to say if its the only place youve ever seen. Granny hooted. You think youre so smart. Smart and pretty too. Believe me or not, I had my pretty day. I had my day like yours. And yall will have your day like mine. A ghosts fingertip traced Lauras spine. She imagined herself with a shriveled body, an unused womb. Past being useful, past being pretty. Wearing sneakers with the toes cut out. Granny eyed Cassie. I bet your daddy wants to buy this place so he can put in big, fancy houses and make a truckload of money. Cassie shrugged. Maybe. Granny chuckled. Aint no maybe about it. He loves to build big ol houses where country folks kept goats and bees. It dont seem right. City folks dont know the first thing about making scuppernong wine or killing copperheads. They just like their pretty lawns and their air conditioning. Laura stayed silent, remembering Grandpa Gantt. Hed never had central air. Never wanted it. Hed said it liked to give a body pneumonia. The last time she saw him, hed been whittling on the porch in the summertime heat. Theyd both been whittlers, her grandpa and her dad. What would her grandparents have said if theyd known their only son might stage his own drowning someday? Theyd been so proud of him. Their soldier boy, theyd called him, but Laura had only known him as a craftsman and a musician. A father who was kind and gentlemost of the time. Granny planted herself directly in front of Laura and cupped her chin in a wrinkled hand. You fretting about those rumors? Do you think theyre true? What I think dont have a thing to do with it, honey. Is that why youre here? Looking for your dad? I thought, maybe, since he grew up here Its the first place you come to, aint it? Laura nodded, her captive chin moving against Grannys callused fingers. Well, then. Granny took her hand away. Why would he stay right where folks would look first? Hes smarter than that. Youre probably right. He went to war a boy, come home a grown man whod seen too much. But he didnt get no heros welcome like the boys who fought in the world wars. It aint right. Granny patted Lauras shoulder. But be done cryin, girl. Tears cant put the spilt milk back in the jug. You remember that. Im not crying. Im just Whats done is done, and if a man did the best he knew to do, thats that. Therell come a day when well answer to God, every one of us, yes, and Hell answer us. He wont answer to us, you understand, because Hes God, but Hell answer. Lord, how Hell answer. I want answers now, Laura said. Not in the sweet by-and-by. No, youd best leave things alone. Leave it be. Granny turned to go, then looked over her shoulder. Might be snakes, so dont go prowlin around too much. Dont tempt God no more. You hear me? Yes maam, I hear you. Laura bit back a comment on Grannys unwise choice of footwear for foragingon land that wasnt hers. The old hypocrite. Good-bye, then, Granny said crisply. She set her blue gaze on the road and picked her way back down the driveway, holding the parasol like a mace. A mockingbird flew up from a bush smothered with vines. The bird swooped behind the house where kudzu-draped pines formed giant sculptures, strange and beautiful and looming like time. In a hundred yearsor two hundred, what did it matter?the lush growth would cover other abandoned houses, along with their pools and tennis courts. Mockingbirds would still fly. Old women would still lecture young women and envy and pity them. You about ready to go? Cassie asked. First I want to know if the outbuildings survived. Cassie folded her arms across her chest. Go right ahead. Im staying here. Laura waded across a relatively shallow stretch of kudzu, trying not to think about snakes, and stopped near the corner of the cabin. Shielding her eyes against the glare of the sun, she searched the piles and mounds and mountains of green where the shed and barn used to be, might still be. Even if theyd collapsed, they might provide a corner of shelter. Dad, she called. Are you there? Her voice sounded faint and far away, as if it were drowning in the vines too. She tried again, louder. Dad! Elliott Gantt! Do you hear me? There was no answer, of course, but two crows flew over, cawing. The old womans voice whispered in Lauras imagination: Hes smarter than that. Granny Colfax had spoken of him in the present tense. Maybe shed misspoken, or maybea crazy thoughtit had been a deliberate hint. Laura turned and tramped back to the car, making a mental list of possible clues. Grannys slip of the tongueif thats what it was. The prowler in the yard. Prestons story. Even the way her dad hadnt seemed like himself in the weeks between his big blowup and his disappearance. She didnt believe for a minute that his accusation of infidelity was true, but if hed believed it Cassie was already opening her door. Lets go. Hes not here. Why are you so sure? Give him a chance! Tears filled Cassies eyes. Youre just torturing yourself. We need to face it, Laura. Heshes dead. The words swept Laura back to the first time shed heard someone say her father was dead. The finality of the statement still made her heart ache. Now she couldnt let anyone trample her newborn scrap of hope that it hadnt been final after all. Hes alive. Her voice shook. I saw him. Cassies fair skin paled further. She dived into the passenger seat, leaving the door open, and stared up at Laura. Here? Now? No, last night. At the house. Walking through the yard in the wee hours. And you really believe it was your dad? Laura hesitated. I didnt get a good look at him, she admitted. Did you call the cops? No. Im not calling the law down on my dads head. But what if it wasnt him? What if it was some random pervert? Thats an awfully strong conclusion to jump to. Yeah, but you know how those creeps show up sometimes. What if this guy comes back? What if he breaks in? Laura walked around to her own door and climbed in. I know where my dads guns are, and I know how to use them. If you wont report it, I will. Cassie dug her phone out of her jeans. Dont you dare. Look, if it happens again, Ill call 911oror somebody. Promise? I promise. Cassie squinted at her. Ill hold you to it. She put her phone away. Thinking shed better go solo on her future investigations, Laura started the engine. As she turned onto the road, she caught a glimpse of Grannys faded parasol disappearing around the bend, heading farther out of town. Then a black pickup truck approached from the other direction. Ugh, Cassie said as the truck rattled closer. Thats Dale Halloran. Laura tried to catch a glimpse of the driver, but the truck was already past them. She hit the brakes, wanting to keep it in sight. Are you sure? Positive. Hes driven the same nasty old truck for years, and Id know his ugly mug anywhere too, beard or no beard. Man, how on earth did Sean and Keith turn out so good-lookin and sweet? I dont know. Laura frowned into the rearview mirror. The trucks brake lights lit up. Ha! I got you to admit Seans good-lookin and sweet. Oh, stop it. As Cassie prattled on, Laura watched in the mirror. The truck slowed to a crawl and made the turn into the Gantt driveway. Slightly comforted to know Dale would find the cabin empty, she decided to buy a few No Trespassing signs and post them as soon as possible.          Dale had become a regular visitor at the boxy little house hed once owned. When Sean got home from a run to an ATM, Dale waited in his beat-up truck in the driveway, pulling on a bottle of Jim Beam. He followed Sean inside, parked his raw-boned frame on the couch, and started rambling about his trucks brakes, the price of gas, and how his best buddy had landed in jail over a little misunderstanding about a woman. It wasnt a social call. Dale wanted something. He always wanted something. In recent weeks, hed grown a scruffy beard. If he was cultivating the outlaw look, it wasnt far from the truth. People kept hiring him for odd jobs, though, knowing he did decent work when he was sober. He got by. Bottle in hand, he heaved himself off the couch, ambled into the kitchen, and opened the refrigerator. Pretty near empty. You got nothin to feed your old man? Sean sat on his hearth and picked up the mandolin that lay in its case beside him. He tried a little riff hed been working on but messed it up. No time to shop, he said. You know. The upcoming festivities. You got no time for nothin but your lutherie. Dale gave the word a ridiculous, pseudo-French pronunciation. Youre a pansy, boy. When I die, Ill leave you the pansy gun. Gee, thanks. Cant wait. Its all thats left. Sean focused on the notes again and got them right. They reminded him of Turkey in the Straw. He segued into the happy, fast-moving tune, hoping it might dispel the gloom that entered the house whenever Dale did. Dale came back and leaned against the mantel, his eyes bleary slits. So, the Gantt girls back in town. I bet shes still a good girl. He winked. You could fix that. Keep your filthy thoughts to yourself. Dale raised his hand. Sean flinched, a reflex he thought hed conquered. Whats wrong? Dale leaned closer, giving off the familiar smells of booze and onions. Ol crazy man Gantt isnt around to protect your sorry butt? Or is he? I dont know, Dale. You tell me. I hope hes alive and well. At least as well as a psycho can be. Keepin an eye on our fair city from afar. That last phrase sounded like Elliotts old-fashioned speech. Coming from Dale, it was cruel mockery. Sean returned the mandolin to its case, latched it, and tucked it safely away behind him. If Elliott is around, youd better not try to beat me like you used to. He could kill you with his bare hands. Like he nearly killed Gary Bright? Dont exaggerate. It was a little scuffle between friends. You always stick up for your hero, dont you? Well see what kind of hero he is now, after living like an animal for years. Dale reached under his shirt and scratched his belly. What kind of man runs out on his wife and lets her think hes dead? At least I didnt do that. No, but his cruelty would have run her off if she hadnt died first. Sean held his tongue. You believe hes back, boy? No. You should. Somebody saw him on Sunday at the old church camp out by the lake. Somebody else saw him on Redberry Road last night about dusk. Somebody thought they saw him, Sean said. They saw him, all right. And I can find him. Oh, youll just lie in wait somewhere and outsmart him? Not likely. Its plenty likely. When I find him, Ill truss him up like a deer and drop him off at the nearest funny farm. You got any clues about where he might be? Sorry. Im not going to waste my time on wild gossip. Well, excuse me, Mr. Luthier. Id better let you get back to your hard, hard work. Dale pulled his keys out of his pocket and jingled them. Ill be on my way. Sean checked the time and stood up. He could play chauffeur and still make it back in time to meet his customer. Ill drive you home. No, you wont. One of these days, youll kill somebody. It might be you, but we cant count on it. He reached out to seize Dales keys. Back off, sonny, or youll be sorry. Dales voice was like a rasp on wood. Bone-deep memories of pain seized Sean as if theyd been imprinted on his body as well as on his brain. A boot in his knee, a fist on his jaw. Even with youth and sobriety on his side, he wouldnt win. He could match Dales strength but not his mean streak. Fine. Drive yourself home. Hey, gimme a little cash first. Just to tide me over. Ill pay you back. You never pay me back. Tell you what. Sell me the pansy gun. Ill give you a fair price. Nope. Im not selling. And Im not lending unless you want to leave the gun as collateral. If you dont pay me back, I keep the gun. No deal. With the too-careful movements of mild inebriation, Dale headed for the door. He slapped the half-painted wall. Good luck with this ol shack. You know, I never wouldve lost it if Gantt hadnt called the cops on me. He didnt call the cops. Sure he did, and then he lied about it. Elliott wasnt the one who was lying about things. You calling me a liar, boy? It figures. Gantt had you fooled. You needed every whack I ever gave you, but those idiots wouldnt even let me raise my own boy the way I saw fit. Thats how I lost everything. They stacked the deck against me. Sean shook his head. Always the innocent victim. That was Dale. Leaving the door open, Dale walked across the lawn toward his truck. He was listing slightly to the left, but he made it into the truck without mishap. Backing out of the driveway, he rolled to the other side of the street and nearly hit Mrs. Gibsons mailbox and the container of garish silk flowers at its base. Sean dialed the sheriffs department. The dispatcher assured him shed take care of it. Within minutes, a cruiser would be on Stringer Road, hunting a DUI in a beat-up, black GMC pickup. He nearly suggested that they search Dales tacky little studio apartment so they could bust him for being a felon in possession of a firearm, but the pansy gun really was all he had left. Long after Dales truck had rattled away, Sean stood looking out the window. He had a lot to think about, and he wished he could talk things over with Jess. Sometimes it hit him all over again as if hed just heard the news. Jess was gone. His mentors widow, his girlfriends mom. Ex-girlfriend. Even after Laura dumped him and moved away, though, Jess had always been happy to start a pot of coffee and talk about books or music or politics. Except, somehow, every conversation was ultimately about her. She was kind and easygoing but also quite self-absorbed. He pulled out the mandolin again, started playing and humming Shady Grove.  Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall. If I cant get the girl I love, wont have none at all.  He abandoned the instrument and looked out the window. A movement in the trees caught his attention. He braced himself to see a man in camo, but it was only a wind-tossed branch against the sunset. He had to watch himself. Laura nearly had him believing those incredible rumors. Like hed nearly talked himself into believing some other loony notions, years ago. The long-ago memories plagued him still, so weird that they might have been hallucinations. He tried to summon the details of a day late in the summer hed turned twelve. Hed been sweating in the brush above old man Bennetts private lake, hiding there because hed heard a car coming, down below, and hed been run off twice before for trespassing. He didnt want to make it three times and wind up in the backseat of a cop car. Dale would have whipped him half to death. But as it turned out, it wasnt Bennett driving up to the lake. Sean gave his head a hard shake. Hed never told a soul what hed seen, least of all the authorities. A trespassing Halloraneven if he was only a kidwouldnt have found a friendly audience in the sheriffs department back then. Now the memory seemed so odd that he hardly trusted his own recollection. His cell phone rang. He pounced on it. Lauras number. Maybe she wanted to tell him about the birthday party. He put the phone to his ear, enjoying the notion that her voice didnt have to travel from a faraway state. She was back where she belonged. Hey there, he said. Hey, Sean. Do me a favor? Sure. Anything. Come pick a lock for me.  Sean sat on the floor of Jesss den with his back against the wall and studied the cedar chest. Small, flat-topped, rectangular, the wheeled chest was set on short but graceful legs and stood low enough to serve as a coffee table. Hed installed its brass keyhole straight and true, with his mentor watching over his shoulder to make sure. For a beginners work, it was a nice piece, but only because Elliott wouldnt settle for less. Now Laura couldnt find a key. A few water rings marred the tophed have to rub them outbut the dark red wood was still beautiful, its warm color accented with lighter streaks. Like Lauras sun-streaked hair in the summertime. He smiled, remembering the green-plum wars theyd fought in the alley behind his house. Shed played like a boy, loud and fierce but fair. Well, mostly fair. Once, she and Cassie climbed to the roof of a shed and ambushed him with a bucketful of rock-hard green plums. The girls had hugged each other and screamed for joy. Lauras scream could scare a banshee. Looking at the chest again, he wondered if a few wiggles with the skinniest screwdriver on his Leatherman might do the trick. But maybe he wouldnt need it. Sometimes Jess had hidden spare keys in brilliantly obvious places. On a hunch, he slid his hand across the smooth underside of the chest. There it was. A small, hard bump. Tipping the chest up, he spotted a square of gray duct tape. Typical. Jess had used duct tape for everything. He turned the key in the lock, raised the lid, and jumped. Dark brown eyes stared up at him. His heart thudding, he let out a shaky laugh. It was only a red-haired, life-sized baby doll. Lauras favorite. It had only one leg due to an accident. Laura had hauled it all over town on the handlebars of her bike during those years when she couldnt decide if she was a girly girl or a tomboy. Maybe she still hadnt decided. The grimy doll and her grimier white dress lay in a clutter of sentimental stuff that included Lauras baby book, a tiny pink dress that must have been hers as a newborn, and some crayon drawings she might have made in kindergarten or so. That was only the top layer. He flicked the dolls stiff-lashed eyes closed. They popped open again, keeping their plastic gaze on him. The right arm hung crookedly from its socket. I got it, Laura, he called. She ran in from the kitchen, drying her hands on a dishtowel. Her eyes were as wide as the dolls. Thanks, Sean. Youre the fastest lock picker in town. No, just the smartest. I found a key taped on the underside. She slung the towel onto a chair and smiled at the doll. Well, would you look at that. I remember her. Katie. Katie needs a little medical attention. Sean manipulated the dislocated arm until it snapped back into the socket. There. Thats fixed, anyway, and a little WD-40 might fix the eyelids. Thanks, but dont bother. I wouldnt get fifty cents for her if I had a yard sale. You dont want to keep her? Wellmaybe. Laura knelt beside the chest and sorted through the clutter, making a pile on the floor. The baby book, the pink dress, some snapshots. An old-fashioned red-and-white gingham apron. Gram Flynn made that for Mom, but she never wore it, she said with a half smile. She didnt want to spill on it. Isnt that what aprons are for? Catching spills? Laura nodded. She put the apron on the floor and gave it a pat before she resumed pulling items out of the chest. Sean set down the doll, picked up the photos and thumbed through them. One was a nice shot of Elliott, Jess, and Gibby Sprague, standing in front of a blooming dogwood tree with their arms around each other. Whenever Gibby came through town, hed visited the Gantts. Theyd had fantastic jam sessions with Doc Marsh and Noodle Hammond. Sometimes Jess had sung along in a smooth alto that contrasted beautifully with Gibbys low, gravelly voice. I always wonder if Gibbys trying to be another Johnny Cash, Sean said. He always wears black. Always lets his hair grow too long Like somebody else I know. Laura gave Seans hair a stern look. And like somebody else you know, Gibby always wows the ladies. Ignoring the bait, she leaned closer to study the photo. I took that picture. I think it was the year he was between his second and third wives. Hes probably on his sixth by now. Probably. I cant help but like the guy, though. And admit it, Laura. You and Cassie had major crushes on hima middle-aged manwhen you were thirteen or fourteen. He wasnt trying to make her mad, but an angry blush hit her cheeks. Her pale skin made a beautiful canvas for it. Im too nice to tease you about your crush on Shania Twain, she said. I did not have a Oh yes, you did. Okay, I did. Im over Shania, but theres someone else Ill never get over. Once again acting as if she hadnt heard, she pointed out a photo of orange lilies. Moms hems. Say what? Daylilies. Hemerocallis is the botanical name. Some daylily lovers call them hems. She reached into the chest again and brought out a slender book. Oh, I hopeno, its just a book of poems. Her obvious disappointment piqued his curiosity. What kind of book were you hoping for? Id like to find her journals. I havent really started looking yet, though. Dont you feel at all funny about wanting to read your moms private journals? Yes, but Im so curious, especially considering the rumors. She opened the book and bent over it, her hair hiding her face. Anyway, remember how shed fill the last page of a journal and just toss it on a shelf somewhere? She was always so casual about it that I figure she never wrote anything too personal. She paused, turning a page. But once Dad disappeared and I moved to Denver, she was living alone. She might have felt more freedom to write anything. About your dad, you mean? Laura nodded. Id love to read what she wrote just after he disappeared. She raised her head but wouldnt quite look him in the eye. I dont want to say this, she said softly. I dont even like to think it. He leaned closer so he could catch every hushed word. Whatever it is, it will stay between us. Finally, she met his gaze, her eyes shining with tears. I think she might have suspected that he didnt really drown. No way. Wouldnt she have said something to you? Probably not. She wouldnt even listen to me when I came up with my theory about an accident and amnesia or something. Then everything got kind of strained between us, and I left for college. Laura shut the book and stared down at it. I dont know, he said cautiously. The whole premise that he staged it doesnt feel solid. If he took such great pains to disappear, why would he come back at all? And why now, after twelve years? Laura nibbled on a fingernail and shook her head. Maybemaybe he heard about her death somehow, and it was a jolt to his mind. Or maybe he guessed Id be back for the funeral and he wanted to see me, at least from a distance. Sean fought the impulse to reach for her hand. I hope thats not just wishful thinking. Consider the big picture, though. She looked up. If the timing of the sightings is related to my moms death, it points to my dad because nobody else would be more affected by it. Think about his background too. His survival skills. And his problems. Disappearing for years isnt rational behavior, but he wasnt always completely rational. She motioned toward a book lying on the floor beside the recliner. PTSD, maybe. Doc Marsh let me borrow a book, and Ive been reading up on it. A little research cant hurt, I guess. She reached into the chest again. She brought out a pile of newspaper clippings, more photos, and a chain that held Elliotts dog tag and a silver cross. He wasnt wearing those, that day on the lake? Sean asked. I thought he wore them all the time. Sometimes he would leave them hanging up somewhere for days. I never knew why. Never asked. I didnt want to set him off. She leaned back against the couch beside him and fingered the cross and dog tag. Id love to give them back to him, she said. To welcome him home. Sean kept his mouth shut. He didnt want to burst her bubble. She lowered the lid on the empty chest and handed him the key. I want you to take it. Excuse me? I want you to have the chest. It was the first project you ever did with my dad. I thought it might mean something to you, and I have all these other things. She made a sweeping motion that took in the whole room, filled with furniture and instruments that Elliott had crafted. Sean would have preferred one of the instruments, but Laura hadnt offered that option. He studied the key for a moment, then put it in his pocket and met her eyes. Thanks, Laura. Id like that very much. She scrambled to her feet, leaving the mementos on the floor. Ill help you carry it outside, she said briskly, bending to lift one end of the chest. He took the other end, and they hauled the empty chest out to his truck. He padded it with an old tarp, shut the tailgate, and sighed. Laura would use him as her free locksmith, and shed even give him a piece of furniture she treasured, but she wouldnt breathe a word about that silly birthday party. Apparently shed rather go alone. Thank you, he said. The chest does mean a lot to me. She stuck her hands in her pockets and looked up at him. Did my dad mean a lot to you? What kind of question is that? He rescued me from Dale. Saved my life, probably, or at least my sanity. He meant the world to me. Then will you stop assuming hes dead? I dont understand why you refuse to see it any other way. He shook his head, unwilling to admit to himself, let alone to Laura, why Elliotts return might be disastrous. Lets not argue. Listen, I need to get home. I have a customer coming at eight. Okay, she said in a tight, locked-up voice. He wanted to wrap his arms around her and tell her to cry on his shoulder, but she might have slugged him for it. So he settled for telling her good night and driving away. He didnt let himself look in the rearview mirror for the quick, on-off-on flicker of the porch light that had once been her way of saying Good night. I love you. It wouldnt happen. Shed dropped that habit on his eighteenth birthday.          Still in her pajamas at half past eight the next morning, Laura backed out of her moms crowded closet and shut the door. No journals there. Just too many reminders of her missing parents. Both of them. She headed down the hall to try the deep but narrow closet in the guest room. The low-wattage bulb didnt do a lot of good. Wishing shed brought a flashlight, she pushed her way past electric fans, space heaters, and cardboard file boxes. Spotting a small carton labeled For Laura, she opened it and found the old photos from the Flynn side of the family. It would have been a more exciting find if shed had family to share it with. Her only Flynn relatives were distant cousins in distant places. Setting the box of photos aside for later, she pushed farther into the closet. At the very back sat three large boxes. Someone had helpfully labeled them with a thick black marker: Journals. But that wasnt her mothers graceful penmanship. Ardelle, Laura whispered. Of all the nerve. She tugged the first box into the light and went back for the other two. None of them were taped shut. Each one held an assortment of journals, ranging from cheap spiral-bound notebooks to expensive hardcovers. A quick check of their dates showed that Ardelle had packed them in chronological order. Had she read them too? In no time, Laura found the journals that covered the year she turned eighteen. Cross-legged on the floor, she opened a thick hardcover notebook that started about a month before her dads disappearance. Skimming carefully but quickly through the July entries, she found no mention of his worsening moods or even a hint of marital discord. Her mouth dry, Laura flipped the pages to August and the very day hed disappeared: If E. has any luck, well have fish for supperwith veggies, of course. The usual overabundance of tomatoes, cukes, and zukes. Why did I plant so much zucchini?? She turned the page slowly, delaying the moment, then made herself read the entry for the following morning: E. is gone. L. walks around like a ghost. I cant bear to write. I cant bear it. The facing page held only a short entry written weeks later: Seems strange that L. is so far away. College should have been an adventure. Not like this. Now S. is the one who walks around like a ghost. The remaining pages of the book were blank. Not wanting to revisit her abrupt departure from Seans life, Laura opened the next volume. It started near the end of September. The morning glories are at their finest. I hope we wont have an early frost this year. I always hate to lose them before their time. More slowly now, Laura reviewed the months preceding and following her dads disappearance. She saw no clue that her mom believed hed staged it. There was no mention of handsome and flirtatious Gibby Sprague, either. No indication that her mom had been unfaithful in thought or deed. That wasnt surprising, given the way shed so carelessly left her journals lying around, but it reinforced Lauras belief that her dads accusation had no basis in reality. She sampled older journals too. An entry on a February day: E. built a bluebird house for me. On another page: E. took me to that new Italian place for my birthday. Nice atmosphere, decent marinara. In one of the other boxes, Laura found the journal from the summer before she entered seventh grade. The summer her dads problems intensified. There wasnt a word about his growing depression, though. Not a word about the blowups, always sparked by some trivial thing and followed by heartfelt apologies. Not a word about a father-daughter clash over nail polish, either. Looking back now, from an adults perspective, Laura knew the nail polish was only a trigger. She browsed through more of the journals. In beautiful penmanship, using a variety of colored inks, her mother had written about gardening, weather, birds. Books and movies. Shed written about a retirement party for a cousin in North Carolina and a fender bender in downtown Prospect. Shed even described the three cats curled up on the bed like furry throw pillows. Except for an occasional mention of Laura, almost everything was about her. Jessamyn Gantt. Her plans, her hobbies, and her superficial pet peeves. In more recent years, shed even tried her hand at analyzing her dreams. No wonder shed never bothered to hide the chronicles of her life. Shed portrayed a lovely, unreal world, all sweetness and light. Maybe shed used her daily scribblings, as shed called them, to create the life she wished shed had. If Ardelle had snooped, she couldnt have found anything interesting, Laura thought with some satisfaction. She toyed with the idea of confronting Ardelle about her prying ways, but they probably stemmed from her OCD tendencies. Better let it go. Anyway, after a month of feeding the cat, watering the plants, and bringing in the mail, she deserved sincere thanks, not a rebuke. Standing up to stretch, Laura decided to put together a gift basket. She had to go out anyway to pick up the signs to post at the cabin. It would be fun to shop in downtown Prospect again, especially if she called Cassie to ask for some ideas first. Sudden tears took Laura by surprise. She didnt have a mom to shop for anymore.  Gift basket in hand, Laura stood on the Brights driveway and lifted her eyes to the distant peaks and ridges fading into the late-morning haze. Now that shed grown accustomed to the Rockies, the southern Appalachians looked like mere foothills. And now that shed become familiar with Colorados mountain chickadees, the Carolina chickadees of the South looked and sounded different. Not wrong, just different, like the southern accents that had become alien to her ears. Even the common endearments of the Southhoney, sugar, darlinsounded strange now. And they never came from Sean anymore. She swallowed hard and turned toward the house. The dirt was too orange. The sweet tea was too sweet. The pines were too skinny. She rapped the shiny brass door knocker on the elegant door and waited. Coming, Gary hollered from somewhere inside. He opened the door a minute later and grinned. Well, if it aint my favorite schoolteacher. Come on in, sweetie, but Cassies not here. Shes having lunch with her mother-in-law. I know. We just talked this morning. Im actually here to see Ardelle. Is she home? She sure is. Ardie, come out of your cave! Lauras here. Theres no rush, Laura said, stepping inside. I could stand here all day and enjoy the view. He smiled toward the back of the house and the windows that looked over an in-ground pool and miles and miles of hazy mountains. Its nice, isnt it? Breathtaking. Enjoy it for me. He opened a briefcase on a table by the door and chucked some papers into it. Im off to work. Glad I didnt miss seeing you, though. Tall, big-boned Ardelle came around the corner wearing a hideous red-and-black running suit sprinkled with white cat hair. The source of the cat hair, fat and fluffy Arabella, trotted along behind her. Why, Laura! What a nice surprise. This is to thank you for taking care of Mikey and everything. Laura handed her the basket. I dont know what I would have done without you. Oh, it was a pleasure, Laura. Hes the funniest old thing. But look at all this loot! She rummaged in the basket. Coffee and tea and chocolates. Special scrapbook papers. Stickers and ribbons and stamps. She looked up, smiling. How did you know Ive taken up scrapping? Cassie told me youre really into your scrapbooks. She thought you might like to adopt my houseplants too. Would you? Ardelles eyes widened. The plants from the funeral? Oh, honey, you should keep them. They were given in memory of your sweet mother. But I cant haul them back to Colorado. Id love to give you as many as youd like. After all, youre the one who took care of them for me. I dont have a green thumb like your mother did, butwell, I could sure enough try. Ardelle seemed to be trying for a solemn expression but couldnt quite keep the eagerness out of her voice. If you dont mind. Of course I dont mind. Theyre already in the car. Every last one of them. All of them? Oh, how nice! Gary, would you help Laura bring them in? And Ill clear a space for them somewhere. Maybe by the fireplace? Its already empty and swept for the summer Gary followed Laura out to her car, and they began hauling plants inside: ferns, lilies, philodendrons, a small weeping fig, and others that Laura couldnt identify. As she and Gary brought in more plants, Ardelle arranged and rearranged them in front of the empty fireplace. Theres nothing left but a couple of African violets, Laura said. Ill get those last two, Gary. I know you need to get to work. Okay, Ill be on my way. Bye, Ardelle. He picked up his briefcase and blew her a kiss, then followed Laura outside and shut the door. That was very kind of you. Its nothing. Ardelle was very kind to look after things for me. She enjoyed it, I think. She always likes to be helpful. She certainly did. A small flock of crows flew over, drawing Lauras attention to the sky where a trio of buzzards spiraled on an updraft, so high above the mountains that they must have been able to see every mountaintop and valley for miles around. I wonder if my dads out there somewhere watching those buzzards, she blurted. Aw, Laura, honey. Its not likely. So youre on that side of the fence, huh? You think hes gone? Im just trying to be realistic, Gary said gently. She sighed. I know. Thank you for being honest. And thank you for being loyal and kind to my dad. He must have blown up at you a hundred times, but you always forgave him and went on being his friend. Thats what friends do. He was a loyal friend to me too. Like a brother. Lord, I miss him. And your mom. Everybody does. His face somber, Gary gestured vaguely toward the house. Just look at all those plants from the funeral. Everybody loved her. I still cant believe shes gone. Me either. Laura gave him a hug. For half a second, she pretended she was hugging her dadbut her dad would have smelled like sawdust or campfires, not aftershave. Her dad wouldnt be well fed and well dressed. If he was up in the mountains, he was all alone. Out of his mind, maybe, or at least nursing a broken heart. She wanted to let the tears come. She wanted Gary to pat her back and tell her everything would be fine. To say that she wasnt alone, even if her parents were both gone. But she swallowed hard and stepped away. Id better let you go before I blubber all over you. He made a big show of examining his shirt. Now how am I supposed to go to work if you smeared snot on me? She smacked his arm in mock offense. Smear it off again. When did you start taking smart-mouth lessons from Cassie, young lady? They both started laughing. It was a blessed relief after too many moments of barely controlled grief. Gary started walking toward the garage. If theres ever anything we can do for you, just call. Okay. Thanks, Gary. He hit his remote. The garage door slid up smoothly, revealing his black Cadillac. Ardelles sassy little yellow convertible was missing, so Cassie must have taken it. For a moment Laura envied the Brights, for her dads sake, yet she liked to believe her dad would be happy for his old friends too. Gary and Ardelle had always been kind and generous, and it was wonderful to see them prosper. She pulled the two African violets out of the car and took them inside. As she shut the door, her breath caught in her throat. Back in her moms kitchen, the helter-skelter placement of the plants hadnt affected her this way. Here, the carefully arranged greenery on the white marble hearth took her back to her mothers memorial service and the plants and flowers massed around the white casket in front of the altar. Ardelle finished fluffing the fronds of a Boston fern. Is that it? Yes, these are the last two. Theyre gorgeous, Ardelle said. Theyll be perfect, right in front. She placed the white violets on the left and the purple ones on the right, then switched them. There, thats better. She turned around. Can you stay and visit for a while? This big ol house gets lonesome. I wish I could, but Im meeting someone in a few minutes. Ardelles face brightened. Sean? No, not Sean. Laura started for the door with Ardelle right behind her. Ill see you soon, Ardelle. Did Cassie invite you and Sean to Trevors birthday party? Laura made a face and kept moving. Umno. I asked her to, but she must have forgotten. Were having a little family party on Saturday night, about six, and wed love it if yall could join us. Think you can? Laura couldnt think of an excuse not to. Slowly, she turned to face Ardelles eager smile. Wellit might work. Maybe. Thanks for the invitation. Wonderful! Well have so much fun. And itll be good to see Sean. We hardly ever see him anymore. Oh, and I intend to drop off some supper for you sometime soon. We cant let you starve. Im not starving. I promise. Laura gave Ardelle a quick hug and then fled in earnest. Shoot, she whispered, running for her car. Maybe shed find a way out. Maybe she wouldnt even need to mention it to Sean. The poor guy. He would hate every minute of it. Next stop, the cabin. Shed bought four glaringly orange No Trespassing signs to post around the property. Sean would notice them, sooner or later, and he would probably ask why she thought they were necessary. She still didnt want to tell him about seeing Dales truck stopping there. Sean would blast Dale, stirring up more hard feelings on his part. About to climb into her car, she looked up. The buzzards were still there, so high above the endless mountains that they were only specks circling in the blue. Maybe her dad really was watching them too. Did he remember watching her and her mom on the lake shore the day he walked away? Did he feel guilty? Did he know how it felt to suddenly learn you werent loved, after all? Maybe he did, or at least he thought he did, but two wrongs didnt make a right. Neither did three. Come home, Laura whispered. Ill be watching for you.  Cassie stepped out of the thrift shop with her purchase, a beautiful shirt for almost nothing. Drew would say shed done well, but she still felt guilty for buying something that wasnt strictly necessary. He was probably rolling quarters for gas money. Eating beans and rice while she ate well. Shed enjoyed lunch at her in-laws house though, and it would be even more fun to tool around town in an expensive little car. She needed some time alone too. She was beginning to understand the burdens that Laura and Jess must have carried. The tensions. The worries. The constant watching and wondering. Elliotts problems had been much worse than a touch of OCD too. Much more draining. She glanced at the vehicles crawling through the roundabout by the old courthouse. Half tourist trap and half hick town, Prospect had several one-way streets and roundabouts that made navigation a headache even for natives who knew where they were going. On weekends, with tourists clogging the streets, everything backed up. Shading her eyes against the sun, she studied the three-story building across the street. Her dad owned it now, but the Halloran name was carved into a decorative slab near the top of the third floor. The letters stood out in stark relief in the sun. Below the name, roman numerals gave the year it was built1925and a carving above the entrance portrayed ears of corn, sheaves of grain, grapes, and hops. Those long-ago Hallorans hadnt been shy about the source of their wealth. The beautiful old landmark had fallen into disrepair, but her dad had transformed it. Trendy shops and a caf flourished on the ground floor. The second floor held high-class office space, and the third floor had become luxury apartments. One of the apartment dwellers had risked planting red geraniums in a window box. Not a smart move when a late frost might still hit, but as her dad liked to say, risk takers got ahead. Cassie brought her hand to her temple in a quick salute. Way to go, fat cat, she said, not caring who might hear her. But all the money in the world wouldnt make him happy if they couldnt figure out what was going on with her mom. Frowning, Cassie looked across the street at the old diner, still a popular spot in spite of the competition from the new caf. Shed tried to talk her mom into going out for breakfast, but she wasnt interested. Her mom wasnt even interested in clothes and makeup anymore. She was a neat freak about everything else, but she slopped around her picture-perfect house in ugly, baggy clothes. Cassie started hoofing it toward her moms car, its vivid paint conspicuous among the other vehicles parked at the curb. Her dad called it Bright yellow as if it were a trademarked shade like a designer paint. Cassie, is that really you? someone called from halfway down the block. Cassie turned around and spotted slow-talking, slow-walking Kim Milton strolling along the sidewalk. A sheriffs deputy now but out of uniform, she was even prettier than shed been in high school, thanks to softer makeup and gently highlighted hair. Hey, Kim. Its good to see you. Its been awhile. Are you doing all right? Still living in California? Yes, and its wonderful. Cassie decided to keep the not-so-wonderful parts to herself. I hear Lauras in town too. Yes, she is. Cassies mind went straight to Lauras prowler. Youre still with the sheriffs department, right? Yes maam. Kim seemed to swell with pride. Whats the sheriffs take on the wild stories about her dad? He says were already overworked and understaffed, and until we have solid evidence that Mr. Gantt is alive, well assume hes dead. Thats only the sheriffs opinion, though. You think hes alive? Im open to the idea, Kim said. Stranger things have happened. Cassie hesitated. It was tempting to tell Kim about the prowlerafter all, she was in law enforcementbut Laura would be livid. Kims eyes focused on something behind Cassie. She looked over her shoulder. Sean was walking up behind her, carrying a paper bag from the old-time hardware store on the corner. Cassie grinned. Sean! Boy, am I glad to see you. Good afternoon, ladies. He pulled Cassie into an old-friends kind of hug. Mrs. Cutler. Long time no see. Way too long, Cassie said. How are ya? Not bad. He released Cassie and gave Kim one of those gorgeous smiles that he should have been saving for Laura. Cassie wanted to smack him. Hows everything, Kim? Great, thanks. She gave his arm a friendly little clout. I just heard about what youre doing. Its great. He gave her a blank look. Doing? The music lessons for low-income kids. Oh. That. Its nothing. Kim shook her head. I know what music teachers can charge per hour. He studied the sidewalk. Its just something Ive wanted to do for a long time. Cassies eyes watered. Bless him. He was doing what Elliott had done for him, years ago. Laura couldnt let such a good guy slip through her fingers. Well, Id better run, Kim said. See yall later. They all said their good-byes. Kim walked down the sidewalk, her shiny hair swinging, and Sean eyed the vehicles along the curb as if he were trying to remember where hed parked. Dont run off, Cassie said. Do you have time to go someplace where we can talk in private? Its about Lauras safety. Seans face clouded with gratifying concern, and he pointed toward the old caf. You bet I have time. Let me buy you a coffee, and lets talk.          Except for the rickety wooden arch marking the entrance, the old church camp on the northern side of Hamlin Lake was a lovely place. Wild daylily plants filled the roadside ditches, their pale green buds nearly ready to burst into orange. A mix of pines and hardwoods on both sides of the road offered shade against the afternoon sun. The holy roller camp, half the town called it, but those Pentecostals were good people. Lauras grandparents on both sides had connections there. She and Presto Preston had parked their vehicles in the gravel parking lot, then walked back to the road together so he could show her the very spot where he thought hed seen her father. Except for having lost most of his hair, Preston hadnt changed much since Laura had taken biology from him in high school. Although she was a fellow teacher now, she knew she would never call him by his nickname or his first name. He was still Mr. Preston to her. Teaching history, eh? he said. You should come home and teach in Prospect. The pays probably about the same anywhere. She laughed. Youre right. Its not especially good anywhere. Now, tell me what you saw. And when. It was early Sunday morning, still dark but not too dark, he said, striding away from her. Ill show you where I was when I first spotted him. He crossed to the other side of the road, turned, and looked in both directions. Yeah, I was about here, and your dadhe pointed to a thick tree trunk to Lauras leftwas about there, passing in front of that big oak. Moving fast, like he always did. Could you see his face, though? Not clearly. With one finger, Preston pushed his wonky glasses higher on his nose. It was more the total package that convinced me. His height, his build. The way he moved. And the way he obviously didnt want to be seen. But he must have heard your vehicle, must have seen your headlights, so why didnt he get off the road in time? I was on foot too. Didnt Sean mention that? I was out for my morning walk, so I wasnt making any more noise than your dad was. But once he spotted me, he slipped into the underbrush and made himself scarce. Did you call out to him? Several times. I called his name and yelled Come back a couple of times, and I tried to follow him. But hed vanished. Preston gestured toward the camp property. There are lots of places to hide over there. He could have run from one building to another, from one stand of trees to another. But why would he hide out here, especially this time of year? There are too many people. Campers, staff, parents. Correct. I dont think he was hiding out here. Just passing through, maybe, before everybody was up and about. Like he was returning to the scene of the crime. Laura didnt answer. It wasnt a crime for a man to go on a long wilderness trek without notifying his wife and daughter first. It was perfectly legal even if it broke their hearts. You look skeptical, Preston said. Did Sean get to you? I know hes a skeptic, but that doesnt mean you have to be one too. I have mixed feelings. Im trying to see it from all angles. Good. You know I always want solid evidence, and we dont have any yet. Preston squinted toward the mountains. But the Nantahala Wilderness is the perfect refuge for a man who doesnt want to be found. He could live off the land for years too. When I was scoutmaster, twenty years ago, he did some demonstrations for my scout troop. He knew how to make his own fishhooks and rabbit snares. How to build a solid shelter from practically nothingand camouflage it. How to doctor himself with wild plants. Hed mastered every survival trick in the book. She tried to smile. I remember. Still, she felt sick as she pictured her dad in the wild with no medical care. He was in his midsixties, the same age Grandpa Gantt was when he started showing signs of mental deterioration. So, Preston continued, I wonder what happened. Did he drown or did he walk? If he walkedwhy did he walk? Thats the important question. She only nodded. Those were some of her questions too, but she didnt trust her voice not to crack from the utter confusion of her conflicted emotions. Together, they headed back to the parking lot. Preston reached his vehicle first. After a few minutes of small talk, he said good-bye and drove away. Laura stood beside her own car, taking in the sights and smells and sounds. Church vans and buses crowded the lot, but there wasnt a soul in sight. Young campers were gathered in the chapel, singing with shrill, happy voices. The clatter of pots and pans came from the mess hall as the staff cleaned up after lunch. A leftover lunchtime aroma wafted through the air. Spaghetti, maybe, or sloppy joes. Those turkey sandwiches, the night her dad disappeared, must have come from that very building. The mess hall. Some of the camp staff had driven around to the southern side of the lake that night, bringing coffee and sandwiches for the dive team and everyone else whod gathered there. Not that anyone had felt like eating. The staffers had prayed with her momor theyd prayed for her, anyway. Looking dazed, she hadnt done much talking. If she suspected that they should be hunting for her husbands footprints instead of diving for his body, she didnt mention it. Laura never went back to Hamlin Lake after that night. It was time to face it, and it might be easier from this side. The northern shore. Half expecting a camp employee to stop her and ask if she had a visitors pass, Laura set off across the parking lot. She walked across a weedy lawn, then continued to the coarse sand of the shore and the weathered planks of a fishing dock. The water lapped softly against the dock, and the wind tugged her hair. Except for the spring flowers in the woods, everything probably looked much as it had on a hot summer day years before. In August, the kudzus purple blossoms would have been giving off their sweet, musky scent, and the leaves would have been wilting and aging in the summer heat. Today, though, the vines hadnt bloomed yet. Their leaves were fresh and young. Across the blue water lay the ramp where her dad had launched his boat one last time, and the shore where the sheriff had gathered his dive crew. Laura had hung back from the commotion that night. In shock, trying not to think too hard, she kept looking at the camps buildings on the other side of the lake, their windows spilling light across the dark water. She hadnt wanted to look at the lake itself. Every time she did, she imagined her dads lifeless body in it. Now she could imagine him alive and well. Not drowning, but swimming to shoreto this shore. He might have come out of the water on the rough, reddish sand and run lightly into the pines, abandoning everything. Not just his boat, truck, and trailer, but his business. His friends. His wife and daughter. Laura squeezed her eyes shut against the hurt that threatened to overwhelm her. She needed to focus, instead, on learning what had really happened when her dad took his boat out for the last time. The sun beat down on her head as she returned to her car. Its Colorado license plate reminded her she wasnt a resident of Georgia anymore. Little more than a month before, shed been busy winding down the school year in Denver. Shed had one living parent and one dead parent. Now, maybe, theyd traded places.  The sun had barely set, but after hours of boxing up her mothers books, Laura was ready for the day to be over. Contacts out and teeth brushed, wearing warm pajamas and her moms white terry-cloth robe, shed made a comfy nest for herself on the couch. She had ten or twelve journals, a quilt tucked around her feet, and a cat sleeping in her lap. She was enjoying Mikeys company although he wasnt entirely conscious of hers. Wanting to read for fun tonight, not for clues, shed chosen early journals that ranged from before her birth to her toddler years. She opened one at random. My honey redhead, my redhead honey. Poor little carrot-top baby, you look more like your mama than your daddy. Laura browsed for a while, but her mothers obvious enjoyment of motherhood only stirred up grief and remorse. The mother-daughter bond could have been so much stronger. No doubt theyd used up most of their emotional energy on her dads issues, but surely they could have talked more often and more openly. It might have helped them stay close even through the tough times. But theyd drifted apart just when they needed each other most. Laura closed her eyes, recalling the heated remark her mom had made while they were still awash in shock and grief. Stop living in a little-girl fantasy and get off to college. Then and there, a wall had gone up between them. It had never become a real estrangement, fortunately. They loved each other. They talked on the phone often. Their conversations were often strained, though, with mysterious undercurrents flowing below the surface of their chitchat. Regret couldnt change a thing. Trying to steer herself out of a weepy mood, Laura focused on a droll description of one of her toddler tantrums. Apparently theyd been frequent and ferocious. She jumped when she became aware of a familiar rumble outside. Seans truck. Shoot, she whispered, slapping the journal closed and fluffing her hair in a hurry. Move, Mikey. The cat flexed one paw, dug a claw into the robe, and made himself a dead weight on her lap. The trucks door slammed. Move, tuna breath! She finally nudged Mikey away. He departed in a huff, but Seans feet were already pounding up the back steps. Laura, he called, knocking on the door. Its me. She sighed, resigned to being caught in her pajamas. Come on in. She heard the opening and closing of the door and then his footsteps crossing the kitchen. He loomed in the doorway to the living room, frowning. Why wasnt the door locked? Old habits are hard to break. Why didnt you call first? He smiled. Sorry. Old habits. He inclined his head toward the kitchen. It looks bare in there. Whered all the plants go? I gave em to Ardelle. Good idea. He noticed the journals. Hey, you found them. Yes, but theyre not terribly riveting so far. Its mostly stuff like this. Listen. Unwilling to give him a glimpse of herself as a bratty toddler, she chose an earlier volume and picked a page at random, near the end. How soon the brightest blossoms can fade and wilt and fall, and then they rot on the ground. She shook her head. Thats not typical, though. She must have been in a bad mood that day. But are they all like that? Philosophical rambling? No, its mostly trivia. Cheerful trivia. She wrote a million words about practically nothing. The garden and the weather and what she planned to buy herself for her birthday. Laura flipped back to the books first page and frowned at its opening sentence. How quickly things can blossom overnight It was followed by a line about splurging on freesia-scented hand lotion. She shut the journal without reading the lines aloud. Actually, most of its superficial, she said. Shallow. Was my mom shallow? He didnt answer right away. I dont know if thats the right word. From the times we talked religion and politics, Id say she was a deep thinker. And you know she was a saint, the way she devoted herself to helping your dad deal with his moods. Still, she was sort ofself-centered. The journals are all about her. Sean gave her a sidelong look. Isnt that what a diary is for? To vent about your own life? Anyway, Im not surprised. Every conversation somehow ended up being about her too. True. Well, at least thats one thing we can agree on. Two things. One, she had her faults. Two, we loved her. Laura laughed so she wouldnt cry. We cant even agree on how many things we agree on? Sean tilted his head and examined her. You okay? Yeah. Are you? Whats on your mind? She must have fooled him into believing she was okay, because he settled back against the couch cushions. I ran into Cassie this afternoon, he said. She told me about your prowler. Oh boy. This is why I cant tell her anything. Shes a blabbermouth. You told Cassie the blabbermouth but you didnt tell me? I knew you would overreact. Im not. Id just like to change your locks. Why? Because, as weve discussed before, half the county has a key. Thats an exaggeration and you know it. Mom only gave keys to people she trusted. Please, Laura. Let me change your locks. And then youll tell me I need bars on the windows and an alarm system and a loaded gun by my bed. And a watchdog. No, thank you. I appreciate your concern, but Im fine. I know why you think youre fine, he said. Youve talked yourself into believing your visitor was your dad. Just about. And why not? I met Preston at the church camp today so he could show me exactly where he thought he saw my dad, and his story is pretty darned believable. Lets discuss what I call prowler logic, Sean said. The familiar cynical smile lifted one corner of his mouth. If theres a prowler at your house and miles awayat the church camp on the lake, for instanceits probably not Elliott. Therefore you should be on your guard. You think its some random pervert, as Cassie put it? Thats a good possibility, anyway. What if its my dad, crossing town to get where hes going? Isnt that possible? Possible but not probable. Look, the whole towns on edge like it was years ago when Slattery was our prowler. Now, seems theres a new one around, and people are jumping to crazy conclusions. I can come up with a few other explanations too, including the fact that it just might be Dale. No matter who it is, Id sleep a lot better if you had new deadbolts on your doors. And if you used them. Oh, Sean. Youre such a worrywart. Only because you worry me. By the way, I drove past your grandparents old place today and noticed somebody has posted No Trespassing signs. She raised her right hand. That was me. Why? She sighed. Because I thought I saw Dales truck pulling in there. Im not absolutely sure because I didnt see his face. Whoever it was, he was trespassing. I didnt like it, so I put up the signs. Ill find out if it was Dale. Tension stretched over Seans features. No, let it go. Dont worry about it. Focus on your business. On whatever it is you need to do to get ready for the festival. Are you making any progress? Yes maam, so Ive earned the right to badger you about changing the locks. Maybe she could still make him drop the subject. What did you accomplish today? I picked up my new business cards, wrote up a brochure, and updated my fancy-pants website. You have a website? Ive had one for years. You think I live in the Dark Ages? He dug out his wallet, pulled out a card, and handed it to her. Sean Halloran, Luthier. The printing blurred in front of her eyes before she could read the details. Shed never forgotten the dreams hed shyly shared with her when they were fourteen and hed just started music lessons with her dad. Do you still dream of playing Nashville? she asked. The half smile came back. No, Im a little more in touch with reality now. Ill never be that good. But your instruments are good enough to be onstage, in the hands of big-name artists. Itll happen someday. You know what Id rather see? My instruments in childrens hands. Children cant afford your instruments. Therell be a few who can, he said. One way or another. Ill see to it. I bet you will. Youd be a good teacher. She tried to hand the card back. Keep it, he said so tersely that she wondered if he meant the card or the sentiment. When can I change your locks? When I say so. Sean muttered something. He got to his feet and walked toward the door, where he faced her again. Ill lock up on my way out. Is the other door locked? Yes. Good. He studied the journals piled around her, then met her eyes. Its hard to lose your mother. I remember. For me, it came in waves. Id think I was past it, and then it would hit me again, and Id be back where I started, crying like a baby. You were only ten. You practically were a baby. And believe me, Ive done my share of crying too. But never when Im around. Whats with that? Scared Ill give you a hug? She had to smile. Something like that. Yeah, something like that. One of these days. He winked and slipped out the door before she could answer. Not that shed had an answer handy. Laura took another look at his business card. Her dad would have been so proud of his protg. If only they could be reunited, the master and the apprentice. For just one day. Outside, the trucks engine started. The headlights came on, and Sean flashed themoff, on, off, on. Stop it, you brat, she said under her breath. When they were in high school, hed told her the flashing lights meant Good night. I love you. It had taken her a couple of weeks to work up her courage and flick the porch light in response. Then shed made a regular habit of it, but shed never said I love you out loud. Shed never written it either. They must have written a million notes to each other in high school. Theyd left notes under windshield wipers, in jackets, in schoolbooks. Hed closed each one with Love, Sean or I love you, but shed always been afraid to use that dangerous word. Back when Seans sister-in-law was almost a big sister to Laura, theyd had some heart-to-heart talks. As much as Annie had tried to play matchmaker, shed been honest about what she called the Dale problem. He was a horrible father-in-law, although hed never hated Annie and her family like he hated the Gantts. Maybe love could conquer hatred. Or maybe not. Laura was still afraid to put it to the test.          Surrounded by the flowery scents of detergent and fabric softener, Cassie was folding the last of her laundry when she heard her mom calling from halfway across the house. Good morning, Cassie! I hear you rattling around, but where are you? See, I told you this place is way too big, Cassie bawled back. Laundry room. Back in L.A., she had to round up a pile of quarters, lug everything down to the basement, and hope the washer and dryer were available. Here, doing the laundry was almost fun now that shed figured out the controls. Her moms expensive new appliances offered too many options. Cassie pulled her thrift-store find out of the dryer and shook out the wrinkles. A soft blue, the beautiful, hand-embroidered peasant shirt might pass for vintage. And vintage was cool. Her mom walked in, wearing a dark, shapeless sack of a bathrobe. She unwrapped one of those low-calorie breakfast bars that always seemed to leave her starving. Look at you. So industrious so early in the morning. Its not early. I did your jeans load and some of my stuff. Thanks, sweetheart. What a pretty shirt. Did you make it? Cassie laughed. Me? Sew? Are you out of your mind? I used to sew, but I dont have the patience for it anymore. Thats why I started scrapping. Its my way of journaling, I guess. Everybody needs a good hobby. She took a bite of her breakfast bar. What are your plans for today, hon? Hanging out with you. Oh, good. You can help me plan the party. Im so glad Laura and Sean are coming. Cassie groaned. I still cant believe you actually invited them. Theyll find a way out of it. Why? They hate birthdays. Remember? Elliott drowned just before their birthdays. The same week. Close, anyway. So dont be surprised if Laura suddenly has other plans for Saturday. Besides that, she and Sean havent been a couple since high school. And anyway I doubt theyll care about a little boys party, Mom. Sure they will. Cassie refrained from rolling her eyes, but even she, the aunt, wasnt especially excited about Trevors fifth birthday party. It wasnt his fault. He was adorable. That was the problem, actually. Tiggers perfect little family was one hundred percent adorable, happy, and successful, and Tig could never shut up about any of it. Shed been a stay-at-home mom from the beginning too, without even cramping their budget. Sometimes it didnt seem fair. Seans such a nice young man, Ardelle added. Im glad your father made that call. Startled, Cassie started paying attention to her mom again. Call? What call? When he sicced the authorities on Dale. Huh? Ardelle gave her a look of big-eyed innocence. Oh. Never mind. About to ask questions, Cassie began to suspect that was exactly what her mother hoped for. It seemed like a ploy to open up a subject that might have been better left alone, so Cassie stayed obstinately quiet. The silence wasnt broken until the cat sidled into the room, meowed piteously, and shook herself, releasing a long white hair to drift to the tiles. She meowed again. Arabella Antoinette, stop your begging, Ardelle said. I already fed you. I still cant believe you named her that. Our other cats never had middle names. Or pedigrees. She knows shes in real trouble when I use all three names. Like you and Tig always knew. Watch this. She leaned over. Arabella Antoinette Bright! Arabella laid back her ears and nipped out of the laundry room, her fluffy tail dragging the tiles. Cute, Cassie said. You have a real way with animals. Dont I? Ardelle peeled the wrapper of the breakfast bar down to the bottom and popped the last bite into her mouth. Ill include Sean and Laura in the head count for the party. Plan on having leftovers, then, Cassie said, wishing she could ship them to Drew. Theyll come. You wait and see. Ardelle dropped the wrapper into the wastebasket and yawned. I didnt sleep well. Did you hear the thunderstorm about four in the morning? I lay awake for hours, thinking of poor Jess out there in the graveyard. Obviously the weather didnt matter to Jess anymore, but Cassie reminded herself to be diplomatic. Has it been hard on you? she asked gently. Hard? To lose my very best friend in the world? Her mothers voice trembled. What do you think? Mom, I only Dont you roll your eyes like a bratty teenager, Cassandra Jane, and dont be so cold-hearted. Wanting to argue that she tried to keep her heart at an acceptable temperature, Cassie made herself think of a softer response. Im sorry. You know I loved her too. I know you did. Ardelle started rubbing her thumb and forefinger together, making a whispery sound. It was one of her annoying new habits. Jess was such a sweet soul. I just wish she hadnt soured on church and all. She was starting to think she only believed in auras and angels and whatnot. I dont think she believed all that New-Agey stuff. She just liked to push peoples buttons by talking about it. She believed it, all right. Once she told me she thought death might be some kind of recycling process and shed be back, somehow, watching over us like a guardian angel. Talk about recycling. It was the same little speech shed made the night before, almost word for word. Mom, have you ever thought about talking things over with your pastor? Or a counselor? Dont be ridiculous. I dont need counseling. When we face losses, we just have to accept them and move on. Like the adults we are. Her chin quivered, but she straightened her shoulders and walked out of the room. Cassie shook her head. Her mom acted normal most of the time, but like an orchestra with just one instrument out of tune, something wasnt quite right. At least she wasnt keeping the obituary on the kitchen table anymore. That was an improvement. Cassie pulled her threadbare pajamas out of the dryer and buried them under the other clothes in the laundry basket. Her dad knew she and Drew were barely scraping by, but they hadnt told her mom. She had enough troubles already.  Bluegrass rang from Lauras house as Sean climbed out of the truck. He ran up the back steps, rapped on the door and waited in the warm twilight. She wasnt playing just any old bluegrass album. It was a CD Elliott and his band had made, back in the day when it was a big deal to produce a CD. Sean was only a kid then, and he wasnt accomplished enough to join in. How hed envied them: Elliott, Doc, and Noodle, with an occasional assist from Gibby if he was in town. Sean knocked again, to no avail, and finally tried the doorknob. Unlocked. Figures. He stuck his head into the familiar kitchen, and the music blasted him. Laura, he called. Its me. Still no answer, so he walked in, shutting the door behind him. The song had just hit the bridge where Elliott went nuts on the fiddle, leading the rest of them on a merry chase. Sean had planned to take fiddle lessons from Elliott sometime, but after hed drowned it didnt seem to matter anymore. Sean had never even looked for a different teacher. The music grew louder still as he followed it across the living room and down the hall. He stopped in the doorway to Jesss room. Laura sat cross-legged on the bed, surrounded by piles of clothes. Shed draped one of her mothers worn flannel shirts around her shoulders. Laura, he called. Still deaf to his voice, she pulled the shirts sleeves around her front. As if a shirt could be a stand-in for her moms hug. Laura let the sleeves fall. She folded a black-and-white bandanna into a triangle and tied it on her head. Unaware of her visitor, she studied her reflection in the mirror on the bureau. Her face reminded him of a picture of a saint in some old book. Solemn eyes, deep sadness, deeper calm. Like she had touched God, had survived with scars. It was like the Sunday school story about Jacob, whod wrestled with an angel or maybe with God Himself. The man was marked for life. Crippled. Yet the crippling would make him think of God with every step, so even the injury was a gift. Sean shook his head. He wasnt accustomed to thinking that way. Tired of feeling like a stalker, he tried again. Laura! he shouted over the music. Her head jerked up, her eyes wide. Sean! You scared me. Sorry. The door was unlocked. I yelled but you didnt answer. You could have yelled again, she said tartly, pulling the flannel shirt off her shoulders and dropping it on the bed. I did. Mind if I turn down the volume a little? Go ahead. He found the stereo on Jesss dresser behind a clutter of toiletries and turned it down. Music is best when its good and loud, but theres a limit. The louder the better, my dad always said. What brings you by? I wanted to make sure you were remembering to keep your doors locked. Laura rolled her eyes. Oh brother. Did I prove my point? Yes. Happy now? Not exactly. The lively number ended. After a brief silence, a beautiful little guitar solo moved the band into a melancholy ballad with Elliott singing the lead. Doc and Noodle provided the unobtrusive harmony.  When water burns and granite turns as watry as the dew, When horses run upon the sun, then shall my love be true.  Elliott had written the song, trying to re-create the tone of an old Scottish ballad. Sean wasnt sure it worked on that level, but it captured the mood of heartbreak.  When cockle-shells turn siller bells, and barley grows at sea, When frost and snaw shall warm us a, then shall my love love me.  Decrepit old Mikey, happy in his own selfish little universe, was curled up on a pillow against the dark red wood of the headboard. There used to be three cats. Mikey, Turbo, and Slinky had slept wherever they pleased. Sometimes there were two cats on a shelf, like bookends, or one cat snoozing on the mantel, squeezed between the knickknacks. Part of the dcor. Now they were down to Mikey, the oldest, ugliest one. His fur was the same gray-brown as a possum, and he was about as useful as a possum. Sean looked around the room. Laura had folded a lot of clothes already and placed them in bags and boxes. A brown purse lay flat and empty at the foot of the bed, its contents dumped beside itan opened wallet, keys, papers, lipstick. A dozen other purses made a heap on the floor. She started folding one of her moms sweatshirts, a brown one with Appalachian Trail in green letters above a dogwood flower. Going through her clothes already? he asked, just as Elliott was singing then shall my love love me again. Well, we know she isnt coming back, Laura said in a matter-of-fact tone that didnt fool Sean for one minute. He sat on a corner of the bed while she folded the sweatshirt. She tucked it to her chest with her chin, exactly the way Jess did. The way Jess used to do. The cherry-wood headboard shone red in the sunlight, a nice backdrop for Lauras hair. The headboard was one of Elliotts finest pieces, its focal point a distinctive knot design that he hadnt carved into anything else. A true-love knot, hed called it. Its curves looped so gracefully around each other that they fooled the eye into thinking hed tied the knot from a length of rope, then magically turned it to silky wood. Lauras hair hung down, screening her face. Sean wanted to push her hair aside and give her a kiss with the old familiarity theyd lost. He wanted to tumble her down on the bed, right on the neat piles of clothes. Needing something else to think about, he reached for Jesss wallet, turning it sideways to study her drivers license through its transparent window. The picture had been taken before her red hair had started to fade into gray. The wallet held a Red Cross blood donor card too. I didnt know your mom was a blood donor, he said. Oh yeah. So was Dad. Gary and Ardelle are too. Their civic-mindedness must have rubbed off on me, because Ive started giving blood a couple times a year. Good for you. I should too, but who would want blood from a Halloran? She didnt answer except to purse her lips slightly. He couldnt decide if she had Jesss mouth or Elliotts, but she definitely had her mothers calm strength. Too much of it, maybe. And dark shadows under her eyes. Sean closed the wallet. I hope youre getting some rest, he said. Stress can wear a body out. Im not stressed. Im just sorting throughstuff. And I mean that both literally and figuratively. Are you made of steel? Lauras mouththe side he could see, in profiletwisted upward. Stainless. She tucked her hair behind her ear, giving him a better view, and picked up a flowery shirt. Her long fingers folded it quickly and neatly. Once the festival craziness is over, I can help you tie up the loose ends, he said. I remember doing some of that for Dad before I left for college. Canceling a dentists appointment. Taking back his library books. They were overdue, but the librarian waived the fines. Youll need to cancel your moms credit cards too. Turn in her drivers license. Do her taxes. Decide whether or not youre selling her SUV. Ill sell it. Guess Id better start advertising. Slap some signs on it and drive it around town now and then too. Its not good for a vehicle to just sit. She nodded. Still fussing with that shirt, she laid it on the bed in a neat rectangle and plucked the shoulders square. Shed always been a bit of a perfectionist in an imperfect world. Finished with the shirt, she studied him for a long moment that was hushed and still. Even the stereo fell silent between songs. Can you humor me for a minute? she asked. Sure, he said as the band launched into another of Elliotts originals, a mournful tune hed called Blue Mountains. Okay, Laura said. Let me give you a tour of the closet. Excuse me? You need to see Dads side of the closet. She sat up straighter. I think Mom thought hed come back someday, because its still full of his clothes. Your mom was a pack rat. Come on, Sean. Just let me show you what Ive found. Laura, dont get caught up in these false hopes. Im afraid they wont pan out and youll be devastated. No longer calm and saintly, she glared at him. Thats not what youre afraid of. Youre afraid to face facts. He dropped the wallet on the bed and stood up. You dont seem to know the definition of the word fact. You need What I dont need is your advice. If you refuse to do something as simple as looking in the closet, you can just get lost, Halloran. Locking eyes with her, he made his decision. He cranked up the stereo again and walked out. He was halfway down the steps by the time the three-man band started wailing about blue mountains and broken hearts under a lonesome moon. He climbed into his truck, slammed the door, and turned on the country-rock station as loud as he could stand it. Laura would be afraid too, if she knew what he knew. A tour of the closet might have brought him to the brink of telling her. Driving too fast, Sean headed back to town. Past the Brights old house, past the library, past the old park. One quick glimpse of the picnic tables under the trees brought back the Fourth of July picnic when he and Laura were sixteen. The smoke from grilling meats. Little kids shrieking and waving American flags. Firecrackers whining and popping in the dusk. The acrid smell of gunpowder. Then, when Elliott was already edgy from the crowds and the noise, Gary had smarted off about some fool thing. Elliott had shoved him backward into a picnic table and nearly strangled himand then wept and apologized and helped him pick the potato salad off his shirt. He always apologized profusely and sincerely, but hed proved himself capable of hurting anybody, over anything. Or over nothing at all. And that was exactly why Sean didnt want to tell Laura what hed once seen at Bennetts lake.  Five minutes after Seans truck barreled out of Lauras driveway, Ardelles car pulled in with its top down. Gary was at the wheel. His straight, sandy hair was windblown, but Ardelle had a big scarf tied firmly around her head. They charged up the steps, laughing about something. Wearing oven mitts, she carried a dish covered with aluminum foil. Gary was carrying a plastic bag that probably held food too. Go away, Laura said softly, watching through the screen door. Go find Sean and smack him for me. She pasted on a smile and opened the door. What a nice surprise. Come on in. Just long enough to unload these vittles, Ardelle said. Were on our way to Wednesday night prayer. I wish Cassie wouldve come, but theres some silly show she always watches on Wednesday nights. She paused for a breath. Its tuna casserole and lemon-poppy-seed muffins. Thank you so much. Still peeved with Sean, Laura was tempted to take it out on Ardelle by confronting her about the boxed-up journals and her other intrusions. But if she really couldnt help herself, accusations would only be cruel. Ardelle placed the hot dish on an empty burner of the stove and tucked her oven mitts under one arm. Its a lot for one person. You can invite Sean over. Hed like that. Gary gave Laura an apologetic smile. Or you could, you know, freeze some for later. He set the bag of muffins on the counter. Good idea, Laura said, grateful that he understood. Ardelle moved the muffins to a different spot. Im sure enjoying those plants. And the goodies and the scrapping supplies. Next time you come over, Ill show you my latest scrapbook. That would be lovely. Wed better run. Come on, Gary. We dont want to be late for church. Laura followed them onto the porch. Across the road, vehicles were pulling into the church parking lot, and the buildings lights blazed in the twilight. Looks like a good turnout for a weeknight. Oh, we love the new preacher. Ardelle trotted down the steps. He preached a wonderful message for your mothers funeral, didnt he? Yes. Actually, Laura hardly remembered the message. She recalled the music, though, because shed chosen the hymns herself, wanting lyrics that would soothe her soul with peace.  Heavns morning breaks, and earths vain shadows flee, In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.  Lauras vision went blurry and her throat ached. She hoped the Lord had still been abiding with a sinner whod wandered far afield. Gary leaned against the railing and gazed across the yard. Look how those daylilies have multiplied. The whole slope will be full of flowers in a week or two, but Jess wont be here to enjoy them. He shook his head. Sorry, Laura. That was insensitive. She moved to stand beside him. No. I think things like that all the time. A wave of grief hit her again, as Sean had predicted. Her mom should have been there, chatting with her visitors or walking to the end of the drive for her mail. She should have been there, pulling weeds or picking wildflowers. She should have been there. Yet Laura was grateful that shed had her mother for thirty years. Sean had had his mother for only ten. She blinked hard and made herself focus on the present. Gary was still talking. The new daylilies are fancy, with ruffled petals or double blooms, but your mom loved the old-fashioned kind. That one is a golden oldie, you might call it, but its more orange than golden. Laura nodded, but they were just ordinary daylilies to her, no more special than the wild ones that grew in roadside ditches. At the bottom of the steps, Ardelle turned around, working her hands together in a fidgety motion. Come on, Gary. We cant be late. Its all right, Ardie, he said gently. The world will go on turning if were thirty seconds late for Wednesday night prayer. He moved away from the railing with tears in his eyes. Ardelles new agitation was so troubling. Lauras heart ached for both of them. Thanks so much for bringing supper, she said. It means a lot that youre thinking of me. Always. Im always thinking of you, Laura. Ardelle blew a kiss over her shoulder. Dont forget the birthday party! They climbed into the car. Gary revved the engine and made the short hop across the road to the church. He put the top up and they hurried inside, holding hands. Nearly in tears, Laura sat on the porch steps with her chin in her hands and stared at the churchyard across the road. Her mothers month-old grave had been covered with gravel to match its neighbors. The big floral tributes were long gone, but a few late daffodils bloomed near the family plot. They were delicate and soft compared to the garish artificial flowers on some of the graves. Gram Flynn had always said believers graves were seeds sown for the Resurrection, when dead saints would pop out of the ground like tulips in the spring. Every year, Laura remembered Gram when her favorite tulips bloomed, their white petals splashed with streaks of pink and red. Gram had worshiped a wild and fearsome God who visited Holy Ghost revivals and tent meetings, who whispered to sinners on the mourners bench and carried them home like lost lambs. Shed have been heartbroken if shed known her daughter might one day drift away from the church and be accused of breaking her marriage vows. Youve been unfaithful. Dont deny it. Dont lie to me. Laura shook her head. It couldnt be true. Yet she couldnt forget the pain in her fathers voice, nor could she forget the way Gibby had smiled down at her mom in the snapshot shed tucked away in the cedar chest. Even if something had happened between them, it was twelve years in the past. Most likely, nothing had happened. Nothing at all. Going inside, she wrinkled her nose at the smell of the casserole. She wasnt a fan of tuna. Ardelle must have forgotten, but it was sweet of her to bring supper anyway. Laura lifted the foil from the dish. Here, kitty-kitty-kitty. Mikey, you want a special treat?          Halfway to his brothers place, Sean spotted old Granny Colfax hustling through the weeds by the side of the road. Hed be smart to steer clear of the old biddy, but on the other hand, shed been around forever. Maybe shed even give him a scrap of information about Elliott. There he went again, half believing the man could be alive. He slowed, passing her, and pulled over on the shoulder to wait. It didnt take long. For an old woman, she was in good shape. He leaned across the cab and opened the passenger door. Granny Colfax, he called. Where are you headed? She stopped by the opened door and peered up at him. My ears are bad, but theres nothin wrong with my eyes. Youre a Halloran. Yep. The less said about that, the better. Well, your smile makes you favor your mama, God rest her soul, and thats a good thing. Your hair flops into your eyes and onto your collar, and thats a bad thing. You look like a hippie, young man. Now, what did you ask? Speak up so I can hear you. Where are you headed? he bellowed. To a friends house. Whereabouts? Ohnorth of town. We are north of town. Like I said. North. Farther north. Where are you bound, young fella? My brothers place. Climb in and tell me where to turn. Come on, its getting too dark for you to be out on the road. She gave him a shrewd, considering stare, then nodded. Dont mind if I do. These achy ol legs just aint what they used to be. She climbed in, settled a paper tote bag at her feet, and pulled the heavy door closed but ignored the seat belt. Sean checked the rearview mirror. While he waited for traffic to pass, he glanced down at Grannys paper bag. It was full of peaches. She must have bought them at the produce stand down the road. Dont you look funny at my old shoes, she said. Theyre ugly, but theyre broke-in and comfortable. Like me. He hadnt even noticed her shoes. Sure enough, they were hideous. Shed cut off part of the tops, leaving her toes bare. They werent any prettier than the shoes. Yes maam. He checked his mirror again. Seen Jessamyns girl lately? she asked. He let out a short laugh. I have. Shes a sweet thing, in her way. I ran into her a few days ago, and she looked peaked, like she needed a hug. Back in the day, it was you she got her hugs from. Back in the day. Traffic had cleared, and he pulled the truck onto the road. That was high school. Things change. Some things do, some things dont, but you and the Gantt girl always seemed to belong together. He scowled at the road and didnt answer. Im just glad to see you turning into a decent man, bein as your daddy comes from a long line of scoundrels and liarsfilthy rich though they were. Thank you so much. Youre welcome, she said with a little laugh. Now, heres the mystery. How did that nice Wilkins girl wind up married to Dale Halloran? A baby on the way, maybe? I dont remember the particulars of your big brothers birth, but I know a lot of babies seem to come early in this town. Eight-month babies at best, but most people pretend not to notice. Sean sighed. His mother would have been better off as a single mom, but then he never would have been conceived. Is that any of your business? No, but why are you so down at the mouth? You got yourself some troubles? I never had no babies of my own, but that dont mean I cant mother folks who need mothering. I dont need mothering. All right, all right. I got no call to offer advice. His phone rang. He pulled it from his pocket and checked caller ID. Mrs. Anderson, a customer with more money than manners. He hit ignore and put the phone on the seat beside him. Granny eyed it with suspicion. Folks are always talking, talking, talking on those silly things. All those calls, cluttering up the heavens. Turning the whole sky into the tower of Babel. I wonder if anybody ever really listens to each other anymore. You might have something there. The other day, when I ran into Ardelle Bright down to the grocery store, that poor woman talked my ear off like nobody ever listens to her. Shes the lonesomest woman. Sean frowned. Over coffee, Cassie had told him about her moms new issues. Shes a talker, all right. She comes from a hard place, but dont we all? Some of us wind up working for sins wages. Some of us find grace in the eyes of the Lord. Not wages, but a gift. She reached across the broad seat to poke his shoulder with a bony finger. Somebody had to pay for it, though. Thats the way of it. Somebody had to pay. Yes maam. He waited for more sermonizing, but she must have spoken her fill. The miles flew by, silent except for the trucks powerful engine. They passed the old Gantt cabin and then the road his brother lived on. A flock of starlings burst out of a tree and passed over them like a mob of miniature torpedoes with wings. Grannys old eyes followed them too. She didnt miss a thing. Funny things, birds. Fun to watch, as long as theyre flying free. She gave him a sly smile. That Granny Colfax, shes a strange old bird, aint she? I wouldnt say that. Sure you would. Everybody does. Im young on the inside, though. She peered out the window and rapped on it with her knuckles. Drop me at this next corner. Ill take you right to your friends door. No, no. Ill walk that last little bit. I do like my exercise. If thats what you want. Its what I want. Its how Ive lived this long. Exercise and right living. He pulled to the side of the road at the next corner. Ames Creek Road. Is this the right spot? It is. She reached for the door handle. Thank you for the lift. Hang on a second, Granny. Ive got a question. She squirmed toward the edge of the seat. Dont take too long, son. My friends waitin on me. Sean looked her right in the eye. She looked him right back. You have any opinions about Elliott Gantt? he asked. Course I do. A fine man, if not quite right in the head sometimes. I always loved to hear him play. Loved to sing along too. I mean, do you have any opinions about the rumors? That hes alive and well, walking around town at night? She laughed. Wandering around where he might get caught? No. Try the mountains. Needle in a haystack. Yes sir, and thatll keep you busy for a while. Even if the needles there, it doesnt mean anybodys gonna find it, he said. Aint that the truth. Now, I thank you for the ride. She grabbed the door handle. It didnt move. Sean leaned over and opened it for her. Be careful now, out there on the road. Dont you worry about me. She climbed out with her tote and gave him a smile as he reached over to close the door. Thank you, she hollered over the engines noise. Youre welcome. He made a U-turn in the intersection, gathered speed, and headed back toward Keiths place. Granny Colfax wasnt the most aggravating woman in the worldthat honor belonged to Laurabut Granny ran a close second. Giving her a lift hadnt gleaned a bit of information. Sean parked in Keiths driveway and waved at the sweaty, smiling boys bouncing on the trampoline in the side yard of the split-level house. Annie beckoned from the kitchen window. Sean walked into the bright, tidy house, greeted her, and went straight to the fridge for a longneck. He twisted the top off and raised the bottle high. Heres to all women everywhere. The good, the bad, and the impossible. Keith came around the corner, slung his arm around Annies shoulders, and gave Sean the once-over. Which one is impossible? Laura? Sean returned the scrutiny. Keith was lucky. Except around the eyes, he resembled the Wilkins side of the family. His military bearing contrasted nicely with Annies happy-go-lucky personality too. They were good for each other. Yeah, Sean said. Laura. And Granny Colfax. Annie arched her eyebrows. Do tell. Im listening. He lifted the beer again. And heres to nosy women. Cheers. She snatched up a kitchen towel and snapped it at him. Youre lucky I love you like a brother, or Id knock that chip right off your shoulder. You would, wouldnt you? He sauntered out of the kitchen and onto the porch, the door banging shut behind him. He settled into a chair exactly like the ones on Lauras porch and his own. Half the population of Prospect owned at least one piece of Gantt furniture or a Gantt-built guitar or banjo. He should have headed home. Instead, there he was, traipsing from Lauras house to Keiths and fuming about Elliott and that whole mess, whatever it was. Sometimes it seemed like an iceberg, with nine-tenths of the menace submerged but waiting. A small plane droned across the sky like a bored insect. Its lights winked brighter as it neared the horizon where the sky had already darkened. Seans phone rang. Mrs. Anderson again. He turned off the phone and put it away, wanting to chuck it in the trash so nobody could track him down. Keith had the right idea. Hed never bought a cell phone. He refused to, no matter how much Annie nagged him to join her in modern times. Hed probably get along just fine with Granny Colfax. The door swung open. Keith came out with a Coke and sat in the other chair. He set the can on the wide wooden arm. When he popped the top, the hard surface amplified the sound, making Sean flinch. He hadnt been this jumpy in a long time. You might want to apologize to my wife, Keith said. Sean walked to the door and stuck his head in. Annie, he called. Im sorry I was rude. A muffled but cheerful answer came from somewhere inside. Presumably her acceptance of his apology. He returned to his chair. He wasnt feeling sociable, but he wasnt in the mood to be alone either. It was a comfort to have a brother a couple of feet away. An older brother who had his head screwed on straight. Windy tonight, Sean said, trying for a casual tone. Another storms coming. You didnt come over to talk about the weather. Nah. I came for a free beer. Thanks. Youre welcome. Now talk. But I tell Annie everything, so keep that in mind before you start. Who says Im talking? Sean propped his feet up on the railing and tried to enjoy the tart refreshment of the beer sliding down his throat. Keith sighed and settled more comfortably in his chair. Whats on your mind? Laura? Laura. Jess. Elliott. Everything. I dont want to believe those stupid rumors, but Im starting to wonder. Me too. Sean looked across the long lawn, across the road, and up to the smoky-green foothills and the distant blue mountains, the colors softening as afternoon became evening. The Smokies held endless places for a man to hide, except wealthy newcomers from the cities kept crowding into the backwoods. Hundreds of new homes perched high in the mountains now, so far away as to be invisible until the sun touched the windows and turned them to fire. Every new outpost of civilization made the wilderness that much smaller. Elliott was tough as nails, Keith said. If anybody could survive, he could. Especially if he had help from a friend or two. And he had a lot of friends. Do you think it was the war that made him come unglued? Keith gave him a sharp look. How would I know? And watch what you say. Not every combat veteran is a keg of dynamite looking for a match. I know. They were silent for a while, Keith tapping his fingers on the arm of his chair and Sean nursing his beer. Nursing his thoughts. He didnt much like them. Elliott was trained to survive. Trained to kill too, and he possessed a violent temper. Whats bothering you, little brother? Sean shook his head. That childhood memory was crystallizing, getting clearer, like the moon seen through a good telescope. It was far away and always would be, but it was clear, its details distinct. The sun shining on glass and chrome and brown metal. And the water. That deep, dark water. Maybe hed imagined it, like Keiths boys imagined ghosts and haunted houses. Then they talked themselves into believing their own fantasies. No, Sean whispered. I saw it. Keith pointed at Seans beer bottle. How many of those did you polish off before you came over? Zero. And I didnt drink when I was twelve. I know what I saw. Im listening. On the verge of retreating, Sean asked himself if he really wanted to keep the secret any longer. Hed worried over it for more than half his life. Hed tried to make sense of it but he couldnt. Maybe there was no sense. Keith might be able to help him see that, help him leave it behind. Or he too might imagine the worst. Sean put the beer down. He wanted to start the story with virtually no alcohol in his system. Proof that he was in his right mind. Completely sober, anyway. Okay. First, all joking aside. Give me your word that you wont tell Annie. I love her, man; shes great, but this needs to stay between you and me. Keith hesitated. Just this once, I wont tell her. All right, then. When you went into the service, I started spending a lot of time in the woods, just roaming around. Staying away from Dale because you werent around to watch my back. I wouldnt have enlisted if Id No, you had your life to live. You didnt have to stay and baby-sit your kid brother. Thats not what we need to talk about, anyway. This is what I saw. Listen up, because I wont want to repeat myself. Go ahead. Keith leaned forward, making his chair creak. I saw something very strange, once. At the lake. Hamlin Lake has seen its share of strange things. This wasnt at Hamlin. Im talking about the little lake on old man Bennetts property. Remember him? The grumpy old dude who made a fortune selling all those lake lots? Thats him. Sean closed his eyes. I was up there, in the brush above his lake. All of a sudden, there was this little brown car, blasting its way out of the woods on one of those skinny dirt tracks that led to the lake. It was heading straight for the water. He stopped, listening to the crickets and the peepers and the wind flexing its muscles in the trees. Keith stayed quiet. It slowed down some. The door popped open, and Elliott jumped out in the nick of time. The car flew out over the water and smacked into itmade this huge splash and a noise like a gun going off, almostand then it rocked, back and forth, back and forth, sort of settling. And Elliotthed rolled a couple of times and stood uphe just watched it sink. Sean stopped. You still with me? Yeah. Go on. It didnt take long to sink, but the lake kept rippling for a long time. Elliott stayed there. Absolutely still. Watching and waiting. Like he wanted to make sure the car was reallydrowned. Sean swallowed, remembering how hed worried that the car would come boiling back out of the water, raised from the dead, because Elliott had seemed to expect just that. Is that all you saw? Elliott hollered something. I couldnt make it out, though. Then he fell on his knees in the grass and cried. Rocked back and forth on his knees and cried like a baby. Weird. No kidding. A grown man, deliberately drowning a car and then crying his heart out. Like hed changed his mind or something. What did he do then? He walked back the way hed driven in. A noise behind Sean made him jump. The kitchen window was open. Annie wouldnt eavesdrop, would she? Keith didnt react though, so Sean decided he was imagining things. When was this? Keith asked. I dont remember exactly. You know how it is when youre a kid. You dont look at the calendar. You dont keep track of the comings and goings of adults, either. So Im not clear on the timing. But it was on Bennetts land? Whereabouts? I dont remember. Sean picked up the beer again. Even if I had a clue, I wouldnt recognize the spot now. Its been sold, subdivided, filled up with those fancy houses. No way could I show you where it happened. I was just wondering if we could find the car. It wouldnt be easy. They say that little lake is deep. Even deeper than Hamlin. But why would you want to find it? Why didnt you call the cops? Bennett had run me off a couple of times already. I was no-good Dale Hallorans kid. Why would I call the cops and admit Id been trespassing? So Dale could pick me up at the station and beat the living daylights out of me? Keith didnt respond. Why would you want to find the car? Sean repeated, dreading the answer. To see if there was anythingor anybodyin it. Exactly. There it was again. Plain as day to Keith too. The brothers sat in silence for a long time. The beer wasnt going to Seans head. He felt clear, almost too clear, as if sharing the memory had ripped a veil from his mind. The new view was stark. Disturbing. Might be nothing, Keith said at last. Might be nothing at all. I hope youre right. Sean polished off the beer and got to his feet. Id better head home. Thanks for listening. Hold on. You havent told Laura about this? No. Why not? Well, first, because I havent told anybody about it until right now. I didnt want to face it myself. But the thing is, if Elliotts dead anyway, why make Laura live the rest of her life believing he killed somebody? What if he comes back? Then well have a whole new set of problems. Think about telling her, though, Sean. Think hard. You might even try praying. I have. Ive prayed about it for years. Ive looked for an explanation that doesnt involve crime or insanity. Havent found it yet. Im not sure you ever will. Dangerously close to losing it, Sean stood up. Youre probably right. Thanks for listening. Making his body language loose and relaxed, he strolled down the steps and climbed into his truck where he wouldnt have to pretend he wasnt crying.          Nearly midnight. The wind chimes tinkled against a backdrop of coyotes yipping in the hills. Laura needed sleep, but she knew she would only lie awake and listen while a headache throbbed behind her eyelids. The kitchen table looked naked now, bereft of the plants. One-legged Katie the doll lay there, literally naked while she waited for her dress to dry. Most of the stains had come out of the fabric, but the grime on her face was there to stay, the result of countless hours of outdoor play with Cassie. Laura picked up the doll and wondered if she could create a new leg out of fabric and stuffing. Someday, maybe, if she hung on to the doll. Restless, she put it down and moved into the den. There was a gap where the cedar chest had stood for years. She missed it already. The past was slipping away in fragments. Even if Seans descendants kept the chest long after he was gone, they could never know everything it represented. Property, possessions, even memories would be gone someday. A family could record its history somehow, in journals or scrapbooks or even online, but nothing was safe forever. Websites and computers could crash, and even the most interesting family records could succumb to mildew or fire. Or some great-grandchild might throw precious old papers and photos in the trash, saying, You cant hang on to everything. In the long run, you couldnt hang on to anything. The pianos rack still held one of her fathers songbooks. Laura trailed her finger across the cover, a faded blue. Hed loved to sing the old ballads with Sean, their unschooled voices a perfect blend. Sometimes Sean had given her a subtle wink to accompany the corniest lines about true love. She found one of the earliest journals and curled up in the double rocking chair her dad had built of sturdy oak and upholstered in a tapestry-like fabric. Wide enough to seat two, it had been a favorite spot for her and Sean when they were teenagers. But she had to stop thinking about him. She checked the date of the journals first entry and realized it coincided with the approximate time of her conception. We stopped at the perennial farm in Dville again, her mother had written. He bought me a daylily plant. Hes so sweet. Laura smiled sadly at the idea of the young lovebirds buying perennials in the late fall. The daylilies must have been in bloom by the following August when she was born. Out there in the night, the daylilies still swelled with color and life. Her mother had loved them, not because they were anything special, but because theyd been a gift from her husband. Shed never stopped loving the lilies. Shed never stopped loving her husband either. Still, Laura couldnt forget the body language in the snapshot shed taken of her parents and Gibby in front of the dogwood. If someone had taken scissors to the picture, cutting her dad out of it, her mom and Gibby would have looked like a happy couple. Just the two of them. The wronged husband might have cut himself out of the picture, so to speak, even if hed only imagined that hed been wronged. I hope thats all it was, she said softly. Mikey seemed to think she was talking to him. He jumped up beside her, blinked, and curled up in a ball against her thigh. Laura scratched the top of his head. Do you remember my mom? Do you remember how much she loved you? She loved me and my dad too. I know she did. A young cat twelve years ago, Mikey might have been snoozing on a kitchen chair when her folks launched into an ugly confrontation. While Laura fled to Cassies house, Mikey might have dived under the hutch and heard the rest of it. If only cats could talk.          The nickel tour of the Halloran Building started with the elevator ride to the third floor. Even the slow-moving elevator was posh, lined with dark, rich woods. Cassie leaned against the brass railing and smiled at her dad. Very nice, she said. Nicer than I remembered. Most people will never see the third floor. Ground floor? Ordinary. Second floor? Very, very nice. Third floor? He grinned. Opulence, baby. Where do you find tenants who can afford opulence? Oh, theyre around. People whove moved here from other parts, mostly. Ive already had a few nibbles on the vacancy. Is it true that Seans great-greats built the place on their profits from bootleg liquor? Its partly true, he said. They had money before Prohibition. They were the bigwigs of Prospect. Civic leaders and all that. But they didnt mind sliding over to the wrong side of the law now and then to make a buck. However they made their money, its sad that Dale lost it all. Keith and Sean never got a cent. Dont worry about the Halloran boys. Theyve done all right, both of them. The sluggish elevator came to a gentle halt. The door opened on a spacious corridor with plush carpeting and more of that luxurious wood. He led her to the first door on the right, unlocked it, and flung it open with a flourish. As if shed never seen it before. It was worth seeing again, though. An ornate ceiling soared high above her head. Simple but elegant woodwork trimmed the tall windows, and a massive fireplace stood empty, its mantel sleek and graceful. Its as awesome as I remember, she said, stepping inside. Check out the view, honey. She walked to the window. The town lay before her, surprisingly large. Beyond it, the mountains rolled off to a smoky horizon. What a beautiful little town. Think you and Drew might consider moving home someday? The cost of living is so much lower here. Why keep chasing that California dream if you cant quite afford it? Cassie kept quiet. She hadnt known the California dream would cost her the dream of starting a family. Now Drew was completely committed to living there. Hed invested his heart and soul, not to mention his savings, in his business. And she was the loyal and supportive wife who would stand by him as the years ticked away. She put on a cheerful face. Theres nothing wrong with chasing dreams, she said. Like you chased your dream of being a land baron. He laughed. Land baron? Thats a stretch. I dont think so. She moved away from the window and leaned against the wall, her hands behind her back, and pictured herself living there with Drew. Enjoying the fireplace, the compact kitchen, and the gorgeous views. Her dad would give them a bargain rate. She knew he would. And it would be good to be near both sets of parents againespecially if she and Drew started a family. Her mom was having problems too. That was a separate issue, but it also pointed toward the wisdom of moving home. Have you made any progress with Mom? she asked. About counseling? Nope. She wont even discuss it. Same here. I dont want to make her mad, so I keep backing off. But that doesnt accomplish anything. I dont see that shes getting worse, though. Ive had some good talks with her about other things. I have too, a few times. Cassie frowned, remembering a conversation that had puzzled her. Can I ask you a question? Sure. He came closer, cracking his knuckles the way her mom always begged him not to. Mom said something about a call you made to sic the authorities on Dale, but then she said Never mind and clammed up. What was that all about? Oh boy. She knows I dont want her talking about that. If I tell you, promise youll keep your lips zipped? Of course. What happened? Remember the day Elliott stepped in to stop Dale from beating Sean? Elliott did the hard part. The brave part. I only made a phone call. Your mom insisted on it. She dialed the number and put the phone in my hand and stood there listening until Id said everything there was to say. Theres no such thing as a truly anonymous tip in a small town, but the authorities certainly understood it was especially important in this case. Dale already felt a bit unfriendly toward us. She met her fathers eyes. Is that how you wound up owning this building? By turning Dale in? He shook his head emphatically. No, it was just a windfall. You know the meaning of the word? Its like when the wind blows an apple out of the tree. Right into your hand. And you didnt give the branch a good shake? Not intentionally. Cassie studied her dad. Making the call had nothing to do with wanting to buy Dales building? He put his hand over his heart. On my honor as a Boy Scout, I only wanted Dale behind bars for beating Sean. So did your mom. We didnt know Dale had borrowed money against the property, and it wasnt my fault that he ended up in prison and couldnt make the payments. He lifted his shoulders in a nonchalant shrug. When the building came up at auction later, I put in the winning bid, but it was strictly business. Understand? Cassie nodded. Risky business too, he said. I had to sink a ton of money into the old dump. It paid off, though. It paid off. She nodded again. Most of his investments had paid off. A map on his office wall was studded with colored pins marking his properties. Rental homes, vacant land, commercial buildings. The Bright empire, ever expanding. It must stick in Dales craw every time he drives by, he said with a chuckle. Right downtown, for everybody to see. His name is on the building, but my names on the rent checks. I hope you never gloat about it in front of him, Cassie said. I avoid him at all costs. Ive got no use for him, and hes got no use for me. And thats that. He looked out the window again and smiled. This viewand the view from the housethey almost make me forget the years I struggled to put food on the table. Did you really? I didnt know it was that bad. By the time you were old enough to notice, we were fine. Wed never been in danger of starving, but there were plenty of times when I couldnt quite cover the bills. I had to juggle them. Id pay the light bill one month, the gas bill the next month. That gives me hope that Drew and I will survive too. Look at you now, the sole owner of the high-rent, first-class Halloran Building. Sweet revenge. Revenge? For what? What did Dale Halloran ever do to us? Not to us. To Sean. Dale treated him like a punching bag. Id love to return the favor someday. Ah, that ferocious loyalty. Its been there since yall were in kindergarten. You three were an unlikely crew, you know. I guess you still are. Theres Laura, the daughter of the whacked-out Vietnam vet Dad, thats not nice. But its true. Then theres Sean, a nice guy whose father is the meanest, drunkest drunk in town. And theres Cassie Bright Cutler, the beautiful daughter of the real estate agent who was too dumb to give up. Im the daughter of the best dad in the world. Im proud of you. Youre pretty darned smart for a small-town guy. Nah. Im a slow learner. Thank God, your mom puts up with me. Cassie didnt like turning into a big blob of sentimental mush, but sometimes she couldnt help it. She doesnt just put up with you, Dad. She adores you. You think so? he asked with a wistful smile. Its mutual. He crossed the room to the other window, the one that looked out on Fourth Street. Hands in his pockets, he started whistling. The fourth note in, Cassie knew the tune. Michelle by Lennon and McCartney. After whistling a line or two, he switched to humming, then started singing it from the beginning. The same way he always had, slightly off-key and substituting Ardelle for Michelle. Ardelle, ma belle In the good ol days, hed always made the family laugh by deliberately mangling the French lyrics. Now he sounded so sad that Cassie almost thought he was crying. Nah. Her dad never cried.  Laura had always liked Seans street, a neighborhood of small homes built in the thirties. The windows of his house were dark, but maybe he was out back in the workshop. She parked directly across the street, then lugged the heavy tote bag across the pavement and entered the yard. She climbed the steps to the porch and rang the doorbell. As shed expected, there was no answer. She walked down the narrow driveway that led to the detached garage and the workshop. The windows of the workshop were dark too. The sign over the door swung in a light wind. SEAN MICHAEL HALLORAN, LUTHIER. Her eyes watered. Her dad would have been so proud of him. Turning toward the house, she heard the knocking and grinding of a noisy vehicle, so close that it must have been pulling into the driveway. Dales rattletrap truck? Clutching the tote to her chest, she stepped behind prickly evergreen shrubs at the corner of the house and peered through their thin branches. A battered black pickup truck crawled into view. The engine lagged into silence. A bearded and broad-shouldered man climbed out. Dale. Wearing a threadbare plaid shirt, dirty jeans, and greasy-looking boots, he walked around the front of the truck and headed toward the front door. He might do exactly what shed done. He might try the back door too, or the workshop. And there shed be, trying to hide in the bushes. Elliott Gantts daughter, a coward? Yes. A lily-livered coward. Dale frightened her on a level she didnt care to analyze. She peeked around the bushes. Dale hadnt pulled far into the driveway. The trucks nose was even with the front of the house. Until he left the porch, the house would shield her from view. If she could sneak past his truck to the sidewalk while he waited at the front door, it would only be a short dash to her car. That was cowardly too, but she didnt want to be trapped in the backyard. Now or never. She stepped out from the bushes. Moving as quietly as possible, she hurried down the driveway. She was still yards from the truck when Dale walked around the plantings at the front of the house and onto the driveway. He didnt see her, though. He turned, facing the house, and squinted up at it as if he were inspecting the condition of the roof. Keeping an eye on him, she kept moving. She hardly dared to breathe. When she was a seven-year-old tomboy playing army with Sean and the other neighborhood kids, none of them would have marched straight past the enemy like this, out in the open. They would have dropped to the ground and crawled through any cover they could find, regardless of mud or thorns. But there was no cover here, and she was the girl whose father had humiliated Dale by putting an end to the last beating hed ever given Sean. Dale turned, his gaze lighting on her before shed reached the truck. His eyes were bright blue like Seans but cold. A smile spread across his bearded face, and he started across the drive to block her path. Hello there, Miss Gantt. Hello. She halted ten or twelve feet from him, leaving some room to maneuver. You here to see Sean too? Yes, but hes not home. Too late, she wished she hadnt said it. He came closer. Chasin my son again, are you? Of course not. I see. Youre too good for my boy now? Too good for everybody? The smile curled into a sneer. Her fear turned hot but so did her indignation. Whatever, Dale. By the way, dont trespass on Gantt property again. He feigned surprise, his eyebrows raised. I wouldnt do that. Really? On Monday, I saw you pulling into the driveway of my grandparents place. You calling me a liar? She moved forward, hoping to put the truck between them, but Dales hand snaked out and gripped her elbow with shocking strength. A wave of pain rolled up and down her arm. The heavy tote bag slid from her shoulder. The strap caught on his hand and dangled, its weight adding to the pain. Let go! He loomed over her, a beer smell suddenly strong. Answer me when I talk to you, girl. Are you calling me a liar? Glaring into his eyes, she tried to shake him off. His fingers cut harder into her flesh. Like theyd cut into Seans when he was a scrawny, defenseless boy. Does it make you feel big and strong to pick on somebody smaller? she asked. Im just puttin you in your place. Somebodys gotta do it. Take your hand off me, or Ill scream like youve never heard anybody scream before, and youll be on your way to jail for assault and who knows what else. Dont forget trespassing. Big-shot property owners like you have to protect their precious real estate from the likes of me. He gave her elbow a sudden twist and let go. Pain scorched toward her shoulder. Afraid she would drop the tote bag and its precious contents, she held onto it with her other hand and ran without a backward glance. She didnt care if she looked like a coward. She reached the sanctuary of her car, dived in, and hit the locks. Her arm ached and her hands shook, but she found her key, started the engine, and drove away. At the corner stop sign, she looked in the rearview mirror. The truck still stood in the driveway, but she didnt see Dale or anyone else. Either the neighbors hadnt noticed the confrontation, or they hadnt wanted to get involvedlike they didnt get involved when hed been beating Sean. Theyd left it up to Elliott Gantt. She reached over and slid her hand into the tote bag, needing to touch something her dad had touched. Something he had loved. If Sean wanted the songbooks, he would have to come get them. She wouldnt go back to his house unless she was certain Dale wouldnt show up, and she couldnt be certain until he was behind bars againor dead.          When Sean ran up her back steps hours later, Laura was grateful for the unexpected cold front that gave her an excuse to wear long sleeves. If he saw the bruises at her elbow, he would go ballistic. Shed already decided to offer a censored version of events, though, so he wouldnt be able to say she was keeping something from him. It would be a very censored version. Careful of her sore shoulder, she opened the door on a gust of cold air. Come on in, Sean. He remained in the doorway, hands in his pockets and eyes guarded. Im not sure I believe the message you left on my phone. She frowned, trying to remember what shed said. Stop by when you have time. Theres something I want to give you. What do you mean? After the way you kicked me out yesterday I didnt kick you out. No? Get lost, Halloran didnt sound like an invitation to stay. Im sorry, Sean. You just make me so mad sometimes. Its mutual, sometimes. He smiled. She smiled too, and the tension dissolved. About that, anyway. Dont just stand there, she said. Come on in before Mikey runs out. He stepped inside, still smiling. Crowding her a little. His flirtatious pursuit bore no resemblance to Dales rough violation of her personal space, but it was unsettling in its own way. She led Sean to the kitchen table where shed dumped the tote bag before she collapsed on the couch in tears. These are for you. She put the bag in his hands. He looked into it and shook his head. You cant give me these. Theyre heirlooms. You know I cant carry a tune. What would I do with a bunch of old songbooks and sheet music? Dont worry. I kept a couple to remind me of Daddy. Thank you, Sean said softly. Ill take good care of them. Dont be afraid to use them, okay? Enjoy them. Wear them out. He nodded, returning the bag to the table, and then he closed the distance between them and hugged her. Blindsided, she could only hug him back. Carefully. She would not cry. The Advil would kick in soon, and her shoulder would stop hurting, and she would not cry. Sean had experienced far worse hurts. Remembering that, she let her hands absorb his warmth through his shirt. She wanted to make up for the brutality hed endured as a boy. She wanted him to feel healed. Restored. Loved. Enough of that. If she stayed in his arms any longer, hed try to take it from hugging to kissing, and shed be tempted to cooperate. She pulled away and worked up a smile. I stopped by your house with the songbooks, but you werent home. And Dale was there so I didnt hang around. Worry filled his eyes. Did you talk to him? Briefly. Now, can you humor me about something, please? That all depends. Its a small request, Sean. Just let me show you whats in the closet in my moms room. He balked, eyebrows lowered. She tugged his arm. He didnt budge, so she took off without him. Waiting for him to catch up, she surveyed the bedroom. When it came time to deal with the toiletries that crowded the top of the bureau, shed probably throw everything out. The Jean Nat, thoughher mom had worn that scent almost every day of her life. Shed said she started wearing it as a teenager and never grew tired of it. Laura picked up the tiny bottle and unscrewed the cap. The light, lemony scent engulfed her, not with specific memories, but with the very air of her mothers presence. The fragrance was like the ghost of a ghost. Hearing Seans slow, reluctant footsteps approaching, Laura capped the bottle, took firm control of her emotions, and turned around. He stood just outside the room, regarding her with the stubborn expression she knew so well. Ive found some pretty obvious clues, she said. About your dad, you mean? If he left any clues, the sheriff and his cohorts should have found them years ago. They werent looking for clues. They never dreamed it was anything but an accidental drowning. Sean, look. Laura opened the door to the small, deep closet and pulled the string dangling from a single bare bulb. Shed almost emptied her mothers side of the closet, but the rod and shelves on the right still sagged with the weight of her fathers clothes. Years of dust covered the shoulders and collars of his shirts. Sean propped himself up in the bedroom doorway, his expression skeptical. Clothes in a closet. Some clue. Which shoes did my dad always wear when he went fishing? His deck shoes. Laura pointed at the neat but dusty lineup of mens shoes under the hanging clothes. Theyre gone. Of course theyre gone, Sean said softly. Theyre at the bottom of Hamlin Lake. The pity in his eyes made her want to scream. But his hunting boots are gone too. When did he ever wear heavy hunting boots for a day of fishing? Your mom might have given them away. She might have, and she might have given away his best hunting and camo gear. The things a man would need for a long camp out. Theyre gone. How do you know? I know where he always kept everything. She made her way to the rear of the closet. Come on, Sean, get in here. He followed her in, grumbling, but he didnt take advantage of the tight quarters. Vaguely disappointed, then cross with herself for wanting him closer, she focused on the real issues. Small puffs of dust rose from her fathers hanging clothes when she ran a hand across them. For twelve years, shed never given a thought to his comfort and safety. Shed assumed he had gone on to his eternal rest. Now, though, she worried that he didnt even have a roof over his head. One warm shirt or jacket might make a world of difference on a cold night. She glanced back at Sean. His church clothes are still here, and some of his work clothes. But his camo gear is gone. Sean eyed the old wooden shelf above the closet rod. It held only neat piles of folded shirts and jeans. This house has more than one closet. And bureaus. Have you checked them all? Yes. Let me show you whats in his drawers. Sean stepped aside, letting her exit the closet before him. As she passed him, the faint scent of sawdust reminded her of her dads workshop. Of him and Sean bending over a project together, working together like father and son. Steeling herself against grief for Seans losses as well as her own, she crossed the room and opened the top drawer of her dads bureau. Hed built it himself. The drawers glided as smooth as silk, as strong as the oak tree theyd come from. Socks, she said. Underwear. Whats so significant about socks and skivvies? Think about whats missing. His wool socks. The ones he liked for hunting trips. She shut the top drawer and opened the second one. This is where he kept his long johns. I know because I always helped Mom put the laundry away. He gave the contents of the drawer a cursory look. I see some long johns. Whats your point? Theres nothing left but some of the everyday kind. Where are his special long johns? The expensive ones he got by mail order? He wouldnt have worn them for a fishing trip in August. That doesnt prove a thing. Laura, please. Be sensible. Dont live in a fantasy about having your dad back. Now you sound like my mother. She slammed the drawer shut. Its not a little-girl fantasy. Its a theory. She pointed to the tall gun safe in the corner, topped with a stack of books. Lets open that thing. He folded his arms across his chest. Ill bet you dont remember the combination. Bet youre wrong. Now that shed practiced the combination a few times, she was fast. She had it open again in seconds. She swung the heavy steel door open and stepped back. Voila. The old BB guns and the .22s we used for target practiceremember those?and the antique revolver he never trusted. But what about his good deer rifle? Ammo? Knives? Bows and arrows? Whered they go? Your mom must have sold them. If she had, she would have given you first pick of everything. You know she would have. You were like a son to my folks. Maybe she just moved them somewhere. Like the garage. I checked the garage. And the attic, cobwebs and all. Oh. Everything thats missing is something he would have needed in the wild. Weapons. Ammo. Basic tools. His mess kit. His flint. The best down sleeping bag. He wasnt planning a morning at the lake. You and your mom would have noticed him taking everything out of the house. Not if he took a little bit at a time. At the crack of dawn, before we were up. You know thats when he liked to set out. Remember what you told me on Sunday? A man could stash everything hed need to survive. Clothes and food. Tools and hunting and fishing gear. I was only quoting what some other people have been saying. Maybe theyre saying it because its true. He looked at the nearly empty gun safe as if wishful thinking could make the missing weapons reappear. Youre jumping to conclusions. She moved closer, begging him with her eyes. At least admit that he might be alive. Not that its certain, not that its even probable, but that its at least possible. Sean sank onto the edge of the bed with his hands on his knees, the same tense posture she remembered from the times theyd sat with Cassie on the bench outside the principals office. I dont know, Laura. Whats your problem? Why do you only want to argue with me? I only want to help you face reality. If youre not ready, Id better head home. He stood up and walked out. She chased him down the hall and into the kitchen, where she passed him and planted herself in front of the door. Tell me whats wrong, Sean. Tell me what youre keeping from me. What makes you think Im keeping something from you? The way youre acting. Baloney. He retreated two steps. She followed, as close as a ballroom dancer. Somethings going on that you dont want me to know about. Will you at least admit that much? He was silent, not quite meeting her eyes. Thank you, she said. For what? For admitting that somethings wrong. By not saying anything. Sorry. Is that all youve got to say about it? Yep. He grabbed the songbooks, sidestepped her, and made for the door. She followed him onto the porch, into the cold evening air. He ran down the steps and climbed into his truck. With the door open, he looked up at her. No smile now. Did your folks ever own a little brown car? he asked. Brown? Not that I remember. Why? Just wondering. Good night. He shut the door. There you go again. She raised her voice, hoping he could hear her through the trucks window. Acting weird. The roar of the engine was his only answer. The truck jolted down the driveway and onto the road, where the taillights swerved and disappeared around the sharp curve with only a fleeting flare of the one operative brake light. She hurried inside, bolting the door behind her, and tried to dismiss Seans aggravating attitude from her mind. She had more important matters to deal with. Rubbing her arms to warm up, she recalled what her dad had always said about mountain weather. Just like a woman, it was beautiful but fickle, going from cold to hot and back again. A fifty-degree night wasnt bad if you had a warm bed to sleep in, but a fifty-degree night without decent shelter would be miserably cold, especially for a man whose clothes must have worn thin by now. Laura returned to the closet, hatching a plan.          Cassie had started seeing her parents with new eyes. Sure, they were middle-aged fuddy-duddies who could stand to lose a few pounds, but they were good people. They cared about other people. Theyd once stuck their noses into Dale Hallorans business for Seans sake, even though there might have been serious repercussions. And if her mom showed a few signs of obsessive-compulsive behaviorso what? Cassie was starting to think it wasnt a big deal. If a woman wanted to spend half her afternoon making a ridiculously organized grocery list, arranged aisle by aisle like a map of the store and color-coded for different kinds of coupons, that was her privilege. Cassie propped her elbows on the granite counter and studied her moms neatly written menu. Steaks? For a little boys birthday party? Nothings too good for my grandson, her dad bellowed from his home office. No fair, she yelled back. You never bought steak for my birthdays when I was little. We couldnt afford steaks back then, Cass. Did it wound your tender little psyche? Yes sir, it did. You need to make it up to me. Buy me a new car or something. He laughed. Dont hold your breath. Her mom looked up. Seated at the table, she was searching through a shoe box full of couponsas if she still needed to pinch pennies. The steaks will be for the adults, she said. Trevor will want a hot dog. He always does. Does Laura eat red meat? Or is she like Jess? Cassie sat beside her. Except for tuna and sushi, Laura will eat just about anything. Like me. You? Youve always been a fussy eater. She smirked, thinking of Drews running joke that they should write a cookbook with a thousand and one ways to cook beans. Not anymore. I just hope she and Sean will come. Hes such a dear. Ardie, sweetheart? came a wistful voice from the office. Yes, Gary? Will you pick up some good salsa from the deli, please? Yes, darling, and Ill buy the really good tortilla chips. Thank you, my love. Ugh, Im getting a sweetness headache, Cassie said. Her mom ignored her. She added salsa and chips to her list, in exactly the right spots: Deli and Aisle 12. Wow, Mom. I just walk into the store and start throwing stuff in the cart. You could save money if you planned more carefully. Maybe theres a happy medium? Ardelle didnt answer. Tigger breezed into the kitchen, her silky blond hair swinging. She proudly wore a maternity top although she was barely showing. Trevor tagged along behind her, explaining why he needed a magnifying glass for his birthday. And so I can see my insect collection better, he said. Tigger smiled. Oh, you and those bugs. Theyre insects, Mom. Only some of them are bugs. Cassie wondered if anybody made a white lab coat to fit a kindergartner. Trevor had given off the mad scientist vibe since he was three or four and had to start wearing glasses. Hed started reading at four. Hed probably enter Harvard at fourteen on a full scholarship. Naturally, Tigger wouldnt just have a smart kid. Shed have a Boy Genius. Ardelle stood up, having finished organizing her coupons and shopping list, and cupped one hand over Tigs belly. Look at you, starting to show. You get to do that because youre my mom, Tig said with a tolerant smile. When complete strangers try it, I threaten them with karate chops. Sure you do. Ardelle turned to Cassie. I remember being pregnant with you and patting Jesss tummy and telling her she could borrow my maternity clothes once you were born. And she did. Thats wrong, Trevor said, his eyes cheerful and big behind thick lenses. A baby doesnt grow in a mommys tummy. Tummies are for food. The baby grows in the mommys loom. Womb, Tig corrected gently, keeping a straight face. Cassie grinned, glad Trevor still didnt know everything. Ardelle seemed to have missed the funny exchange. Her mind was probably on those cents-off coupons. Tig and Trev, in case youre not here when I get home, give me my kisses now, she ordered. They came forward obediently, bestowing and receiving kisses, and Ardelle left through the garage to do her shopping. Wed better go too, Tig said. Trev, go get your backpack and say good-bye to Grandpa. She met Cassies eyes and frowned. Whats wrong? You look unusually, um, sweet. Im thinking you lead a charmed life, right down to having a great husband and an adorable and brilliant child. Tiggers flawless face lit up with happiness. I do lead a charmed life, dont I? She rubbed her fingers lightly over her belly, like a prenatal love pat to go with those expensive prenatal vitamins shed taken for months before they tried for Baby Number Two. Tigger the Tagger. Wary of karate chops, Cassie steered clear of the pregnant tummy and mussed her sisters shiny hair instead. Like old times. Even though it irritates me to pieces, Im really and truly glad youre happy. And Im glad you are. But leave my hair alone, Eeyore. Yes maam. Walking past the table to see Tig and Trevor out the door, Cassie stopped short. After all that work, her mom had left her list and coupons on the table.  Green, green, green everywhere. Kudzu would conquer the world someday, at least where the winters werent cold enough to kill it. Treading carefully through the vines, watching for snakes, Laura slogged toward the cabin, glad that her shoulder had improved overnight. The big black trash bag shed slung over her back made her feel like Santa Claus, but there was no chimney left for Santa. Except for a corner in the rear, the roof had caved in. The No Trespassing sign shed nailed to the wall looked gaudy against the rough gray wood. It didnt belong there. But neither did Dale. The signs probably wouldnt discourage him anyway, but at least shed put him on notice that she knew hed been there. With her dads old work gloves tucked securely under her arm, she made her way around to the back. She couldnt imagine anyone using the cabin as a refuge, with its roof collapsed and its plank floor rotting into the dirt, but she couldnt think of a more likely home base for her dad. Even if he never spent a night there, he might find the loot and haul it away to wherever hed been staying. If it brought him any comfort at all, it was worth the trouble. The back door hung at a crazy angle, its top hinge rusted away. She gave the weathered wood a cautious push and peered into the green gloom inside. Nothing but kudzu. She placed the black bag in the corner that still had a roof. Triple-bagged, the clothes and supplies should be safe against the weather for a while. She hadnt wanted to give him a heavy load to haul, so shed brought just one of each article of clothing she thought hed need. No duplicates except socks and underwear. Shed packed lip balm too. Toothpaste and a toothbrush. Soap. A can opener and some canned goods. Since leaving the house, shed already thought of a dozen more items. From the back pocket of her jeans, she pulled out a tiny notepad and a pen. For hours, shed contemplated what to write. Shed finally decided. Dad, please let me know youre okay. I love you. She signed her name and clipped the pen to the notepad. Studying those old suede gloves, a peculiar shade of green, she wondered if he would recognize them. He might even recall that when she was little, shed loved to put them on when they were still warm from his hands. She tucked the notepad and pen inside one of the gloves and left them on top of the trash bag. She had more bags in the car, to drop off at the homeless shelter, but this bag was meant for one particular homeless veteran. He might never find it, though. She might have donated the clothing and supplies to some unknown trespasseror to Dale. She left through the broken doorway and waded through the kudzu. Back to her car, back to normal life. Except it could never be normal until she learned what had happened to her father.  Laura headed up the back steps with the mail in her hand but stopped short. Mikey was sound asleep in a puddle of sun on the porch. Shed left him inside, sleeping on the couch, and she remembered locking the door. Walking past the cat, she tried the door. Unlocked. The driveway showed no obvious signs that another vehicle had come and gone while she was out, but that didnt prove anything. The ground was too dry to show tire tracks. Or footprints. Maybe someone had come on foot, in broad daylight. Her heart pounding, she opened the door partway and stuck her head in. Whos there? Dad? Silence. Of course. Shed given her word that she would call 911 if she saw another prowler. But she hadnt actually seen one. The sleeping cat was easy to capture. Holding him firmly, she took him inside, shut the door with her hip, and deposited him on the kitchen floor. Whats going on, Mikey? Who was here? I wish you could talk. He wobbled sleepily over to his food dish and started eating. Laura sucked in a breath. Shed fed the cat early, and hed wolfed it all down. Hed emptied his dish within minutes. Ardelle, Laura said. Ardelle had let herself in. Shed given Mikey a second breakfast and let him escape. Trying to squelch her irritation, Laura looked around the kitchen. The mug shed left beside the coffee maker was in the sink, and the bag of oranges shed left on the counter was missing. Ardelle always liked to refrigerate her fruit. Laura opened the fridge. The oranges were in the produce drawer. The tuna casserole sat on the second shelf. If Ardelle had lifted the foil, she would have known it was still untouched except for the spoonful the cat had enjoyed. Maybe that would hurt her feelings, but she had no right to snoop in the fridge or anywhere else. Laura walked into the den. It smelled like lemon Pledge. Some of her dads instruments had been moved, ever so slightly. Nothing was out of place in any of the bedrooms, but the carpet was freshly vacuumed. The bathrooms surfaces gleamed. She returned to the kitchen, shaking her head. Half the county had a key, but only Ardelle would have the nerve to walk in and act like she lived there. It was too much. The cleaning, the straightening, the journals packed away in a closet. Apparently the cabin wasnt the only place that needed No Trespassing signs. There was no harm done, though, and she probably just couldnt help herself. Laura filled her lungs, held her breath as long as she could, and exhaled slowly, trying to blow the anger right out of her system. She had to let it go. But then she noticed the calendar that hung beside the fridge. Shed deliberately left it open to April, the last month that held neat notes about dentist appointments and garden club meetings. Now it was open to the blank squares of May. A month ago, shed begun to grieve the loss of her mother. The future held a thousand smaller losses. No more notes on the calendar. No more coming home for Christmas and filling each others stockings with little treasures. No more swapping goofy birthday cards. Her mom had always loved the funny ones. Bonus points for finding her a funny one with a cat on it. Mikey sidled over to the door and yowled. I should, she said. I should let you out, you ugly old possum-cat. I should feed you to the coyotes. But she remembered him as an orphaned, half-starved kitten, taking milk from a medicine dropper held in her dads big, scarred hands. I didnt mean it, Mikey. She scooped him up and held him close. He must have been rolling in her mothers herb garden because his fur smelled like rosemary. Laura closed her eyes and rested her chin on the cats head. If shed had more time with her mother, they might have mended their relationship. Or they might have gone on as before, never daring to talk about the mysteries that drove a wedge between them.          On Saturday morning, Laura pushed a shopping cart through Krogers produce section and stopped beside the white peaches. The first of the season. Her dad had loved peaches. The abundance of food brought tears to her eyes. She wanted to walk him up and down the aisles and buy him anything he wanted. Anything at all, even if it wasnt good for him. She wouldnt lecture him about pesticides or processed foods or cholesterol. All this food was so easy. Ready to eat. She couldnt imagine twelve years of foraging for greens and berries. Shooting a rabbit or a squirrel and cooking it over an open fire. Retiring to some rough shelter for the night, all alone. Seans sister-in-law pushed her cart around the corner, jolting Laura back to the present. In T-shirt and faded jeans, her short hair tousled and her face bare of makeup, Annie Halloran still resembled a happy teenager more than a married mother of three. Completely focused on her shopping list, she didnt look up. After Laura went off to college, she and Annie hadnt stayed in touch. Annie had come to the funeral, though. Shed given Laura a long, silent hug that had meant more than a hundred trite condolences. She looked up and smiled. Hey, Laura. Hi, Annie. You dont have the boys with you today? No, theyre home with Keith. Running him ragged, no doubt. I can only imagine. A twinge of envy stabbed Laura. If shed married Sean, those three little boys with blazing blue eyes would have been her nephews, and her children would have had cousins. With Dale as their grandfather. How in the world do you handle having Dale as your father-in-law? Laura blurted. Annies eyes widened. Thats an interesting question. Dont read anything into it, Laura added hastily, her cheeks heating. Oh, of course not. She leaned on her shopping cart. Well, we avoid him as much as we can. Keith has ordered him to stay off our property. I wonder why Sean doesnt lay down some rules like that. I asked him once, and he said something about being merciful. Hes too tender-hearted for his own good. Annie paused. I think Sean still manages to love Dale just a little, in spite of everything. Laura nodded. Stalling until she had control of herself, she picked up a tomato. Not ripe. Not even close. She put it back. I hate store-bought tomatoes. Wait a couple of months, and I can bring you plenty from our garden. If youll still be in town. Im not sure Ill be here that long, but thanks. Sean will be sorry to see you go. He stopped by a few nights ago. Didnt stay long, but your name came up. Annie smiled. Matter of fact, he said youre impossible. Laura winced, wondering which tiff hed meant. I probably deserved it. No, I think he was using you as a scapegoat when hes really tied up in knots about the other thing. Other thing? TheI dont know. Ive always hoped yall would get back together, and I thought thats what he and Keith were talking about, out on the porch, so Ilistened in. Annie made a face. But that wasnt what they were talking about? No. Sean was talking about a drowning he saw a long time ago. I only heard part of it, and Keith wouldnt tell me later. Sean never mentioned anything like that? Never. He wasnt talking about my dad, was he? Sean wasnt anywhere near the lake that dayunless Im remembering everything wrong. Annie had become intensely interested in selecting a green pepper. You should ask him. She dropped a pepper into a bag. I shouldnt have said anything. Im sorry. Its okay. Really. Im still sorry. Well, I need to get home. Bye, Laura. Annie pushed her cart around the corner. Before she could lose her nerve, Laura dug her phone out of her pocket and punched Seans number. He answered on the first ring. Laura, he said in a cautious tone. Whats up? Explain this business about seeing a drowning years ago. Please? He was silent for a moment. Where did you get this information? Hed called it information. Not gossip. From Annie, she said. He grumbled something unintelligible. Whats it all about, Sean? Who drowned? I dont know. Nobody, probably. It was sort of a figurative drowning. Dont worry about it. I have the neck of a mandolin half-glued. Gotta go. Bye. Wait. Dont hang up on me. IIm supposed to tell you about the party. There was a long silence. Party, he said, finally. What party? Trevors birthday party. His fifth. Tonight at six. Sorry its so last minute. Were both invited. Itll be at Gary and Ardelles house. I was supposed to ask you earlier, but But you didnt want tountil now, when you want another chance to interrogate me. Sean laughed softly. Im up to it. Ill pick you up a little before six. And then he did hang up on her.  Waiting for Laura to come outside, Sean leaned against the porch pillar and looked across the road to the churchs picnic pavilion where hed carved their initials into a table on a winter evening. Hed kept coaxing her into deeper, longer kisses too. Make a cut, stop for a kiss. Make a cut, stop for three or four or five kisses. Night had fallen fast, the way it did in December, and the lights had come on in the little bungalow, reminding him of her dads unpredictable temper. He gave the pillar a pat. It was solid, like the whole house, and alive in a way that brick could never be alive. Wood could breathe. It had some give to it. He especially liked a frame house with a wraparound porch. Or any house that had Laura in itand that didnt hold echoes of Dales rages. The doorknob rattled. Laura stepped outside in a blue shirt and jeans. Holding a large, square package wrapped in garish dinosaur paper and topped with multicolored ribbons, she looked as fragile as the wrappings. Im sorry I hung up on you, he said. Youre beautiful, he added unwisely. Fragile or not, she glared at him in a way that made him think he was staring straight into a double-barreled shotgun. Loaded, cocked, and aimed. That was the Laura he remembered. Fighting a smile, he lifted his hands in surrender. I take it back. Youre downright homely. Feel better now? She placed the gift in his upraised hands. Hold this, please. She locked up, dumped her keys in her purse, and frowned toward the road. Mikey escaped again. Hes out there somewhere. Laura was like Jess. Whenever brakes squealed on the road, Jess had dropped whatever she was doing to count feline noses. Hell be fine, Sean said. He always is. How much do I owe you on the gift? Dont worry about it. Laura hurried down the steps. No, Im splitting it with you. He chased her onto the driveway. What is it? She went for the passenger door, opened it before he could, and climbed in. A big remote-control truck. A red one. Im glad you like red trucks. He closed the glossy red door and went around to his side. You sure about going to the party? he asked, setting the gift between them on the seat. Its not too late to call and cancel. Out of the question. But I should give you fair warning. Dont be surprised if you see some OCD behavior from Ardelle. I know. Cassie told me. You think theres any truth to it? Probably. She nailed him with that look again. Now, back to this drowning that youre so determined not to talk about. Does it have anything to do with my dad? It wasnt even the same year as your dads drowning. Maybe that would satisfy her curiosity. He fired up the truck and tried to kill his thoughts in the noise of the engine, but he only heard that ugly drowning word reverberating in his brain. Stalling for time, he pulled the truck onto the road and hit the gas. A gray blur flashed onto the roada cat? Mikey He pulled the truck hard to the left, brakes screaming. He checked his mirror, afraid hed see Mikey, but a squirrel scampered into the roadside weeds. Whew, he said. It was only a squirrel. And I missed it. Laura twisted her whole body to peer through the rear window. Are you sure it wasnt Mikey? Im sure. I saw it. She settled into her seat again. I dont know if I could stand to lose Mikey too. Her voice faltered. But the cat was old. Even if she kept him out of harms way, he couldnt have more than a few years left. Not wanting to say it, Sean took her hand. She didnt resist. Neither of them spoke in the ten minutes it took to reach the Brights new place, high on a hill outside town. It was quite the spread, a sprawling, cedar-sided ranch-style home with an in-ground pool behind a privacy fence. They had a spectacular view of Prospect spread out below. When Sean opened Lauras doorwith difficulty, because the latch decided to stick againshe handed him the gift. She wouldnt meet his eyes. Hed known her since kindergarten. He recognized the signs that she needed to cry. And between losing her mom and hearing the rumors about her dadand half believing he hadnt loved hershe had plenty to cry about. He placed the gift on the roof of the truck. Come here, Laura. She shook her head. Dont be that way, he said. Im a friend. Friends give friends hugs. Its awkward. So? Deal with it. He opened his arms, fully expecting her to walk right past him, but she stepped close and leaned against him. Shielded from the Brights windows by a row of shrubs, he held her and stroked her hair. She still wasnt crying. Not around him. Lets skip the party, he said. Theyll understand. She shook her head against his chest. Trevor wouldnt. Hes only turning five. Hell hardly notice who shows up and who doesnt. Trevor? Ha! He notices everything. I remember that from my last trip home. Anyway, were here. Were going in. He tried to nudge her back into the truck. No. Ill call and explain. You arent up to it. Im up to it. I want to see Trevors face when he sees that big ol truck. Hell be so happy. Laura had always wanted everybody safe and happy. I love you, Sean mouthed silently into her hair. He kissed the top of her head so lightly that she couldnt have felt it. Or maybe he hadnt made it quite light enough, because her head jerked up, smacking his chin. She escaped his arms, grabbed the gift, and hustled around the bed of the truck and through the front yard. Sean followed. Gary welcomed them at the front door. Always the genial host, he gave Laura a fatherly hug, then gave Sean a cross between a hug and a bout of back-slapping. Any more thoughts about the house? Gary asked after Laura had disappeared in the direction of the kitchen. Sean nodded. Once were on the other side of Memorial weekend, Ill hurry up and finish the renovations. Except then hed have more orders for instruments. Less time for the house. Good decision. Im glad to hear it. Gary lowered his voice. Hows Laura doing? Pretty well, considering she lost her mom recently. Why do people have to die? Gary asked under his breath. Because the world would get a little crowded if they didnt. Sean bit back the wisecrack in the nick of time. He walked into the kitchen in time to see Trevor accost Laura. Hey, Aunt Laura, he said, his eyes gleaming behind his glasses. Did you bring me something? Her face lit with a big grin. I sure did, sweetie. Your mom can tell you when its time to open it, okay? Its from Uncle Sean too. She set the birthday present on the table and knelt for a hug. It was complicated a bit by the way Trevor tried to see around her to check out the gift. Sean smiled, pleased with his unofficial title. Neither of them was related to the Brights, but it did feel like family. Him and Laura. Gary and Ardelle. Cassie. Tom and Tig and Trevor. He made the rounds to shake hands or hug people, as appropriate. Even the cat, that prissy, expensive parasite, welcomed him by jumping into his lap the moment he took a seat at the kitchen table. Arabella smelled like herbal shampoo, but she purred and shed fur like any ordinary cat. Somebody had put bluegrass on the stereonot Elliotts CD, but one of Gibbys. The ritzy home buzzed with music and laughter. Gary and Ardelle might have moved up in the world, but they hadnt forgotten how to let their hair down and have fun. Seans heart wasnt in it, though. When everybody else went out to the patio to harass Gary about how to cook the steaks, Sean retreated to the living room. The cat followed and claimed his lap again. He closed his eyes. He heard Cassie coming in, shouting something to somebody. Her flip-flops slapped their way across the kitchen. The sound softened as they hit the carpet, and finally stopped in front of him. He opened his eyes. She stood there, squinting at him. Whats your problem? she asked. Is it obvious? Yes. She knelt beside his chair and roughed up the cats fur. Arabella twitched but went on purring. I hate birthdays, Sean said. Oh, I know. Elliott picked a bad week to drown. Yeah, thats part of it. And theres the other. Cassie frowned at him. Other? You know. Laura and me. She must have told you. Told me what? Darn it, Halloran, this sounds juicy. Out with it. Knowing she wouldnt give up until hed confessed, he let out a sigh and checked to make sure nobody was within earshot. Okay. The day I turned eighteen, I thought I was all grown up. An adult. And Laura looked so lostit was less than a week since Elliott drowned Sean stopped, remembering the blank look in her eyes, as if shed just peered over the edge of the world into the abyss. Marriage had seemed like powerful magic to shield her from more heartache. Go on, Cassie said. I asked her to marry me. Cassies eyes widened. You did? She never told you? Her best friend? Cassie shook her head, obviously enthralled. Well, what happened? She said we were too young to be thinking about marriage. Next thing I knew, shed changed her college plans. Instead of going to UGA, she went to Colorado. Like she wanted to put some distance between us. The rat. I cant believe she never told me. I guess she wanted to spare me the humiliation. He smiled a little. But I never knew I wasnt being talked about, so I felt humiliated for no good reason. See, shes the kind of woman who wont talk about an ex-boyfriend. I shouldnt talk about her either. This is a different kind of talking. The constructive kind. Wow, Sean, I hope shell stay long enough to give us some time to work on her. Maybe shell even move home, unless Mikey kicks the bucket. Why would Mikey have anything to do with it? Dont you remember? Shes crazy about the cat because Elliott rescued him from a Dumpster or something. But she cant have pets in her apartment, and nobody would want to adopt such an old cat. What are you getting at? As long as Mikeys alive, theres a chance shell keep the house and move home. Youd better work fast though. Go for broke. Cassie stood up, rubbed Arabella the wrong way again, and headed for the kitchen. Sean shook his head, remembering how Laura turned him down. The moment hed realized she was saying no, her words had turned to muddy fuzz in his brain. He only knew shed been kind. Now, to find out shed never told her best friend about his stupid, misguided proposalwell, it only made him love her more. Even if she refused to love himor refused to admit she did. There was a big difference. Voices wafted toward him from the patio. Garys jovial banter and Ardelles breathless chatter. Lauras low voice, carrying a hint of the West now. Cassies big laugh and Tiggers giggle. Tig still sounded like a kid sometimes. Both Bright girls were almost like sisters to Sean. Sometimes he wished they were his real sisters. Other times, he just envied them for having two reasonably normal parents who loved them. Gary and Ardelle were good to him too, but being a charity project wasnt the same as being a son. Absently smoothing the cats silky pelt and half listening to the bluegrass on the stereo, Sean closed his eyes and remembered after-school afternoons at Elliotts shop, soaking up the mans music and his kindness. Sometimes Sean had imagined being his son, a fantasy that lasted only until he realized that would make Laura his sister. That would never do.  Exhausted from an evening of feigned cheerfulness and too many Gibby Sprague CDs, Laura kept her eyes on the center line as Sean drove her home. She tried to concentrate on the way the headlights ran ahead through the curves, but it didnt help. All night, shed been reliving long-ago birthday parties with her parents and the Brights. Theyd always had so much fun together. As if they were really and truly all one big happy family. She made a sharp intake of breath, nearly a sob, before she could stop herself. Sean squeezed her hand. Everythings finally hitting you, he said. Right on top of losing your mom, you have the rumors about your dad. Its too much. Afraid her voice wouldnt work, she only shook her head. What are your plans for tomorrow? he asked after a long silence. Maybe she could get a couple of words out. More sorting. Why dont you get some help from somebody? Cassie, maybe? Two birds, one stone. Visit with her and make some progress on the sorting. Good idea. He parked in front of the house and shut off the engine. Sit tight. Ill get your door. It tends to stick. Like she didnt know that? But she waited as he walked around the truck. The dome light came on, making her feel exposed. She climbed out. Sean followed, hovering just behind her as she unlocked the back door. Thanks for the ride, she said, keeping her left shoulder to him so she wouldnt have to look him in the eye. Thanks for inviting me. Hey, look who decided to come home. Mikey. She turned around, her heart instantly lighter. Mikey sashayed up the steps and wound himself around her ankles. She scooped him up, caught Seans smile, and remembered her earlier terror that Mikey had been hit. Oh, I forgot Id been interrogating you, she said. You still havent explained what Annie said about a drowning. Arent you going to explain? What she overheard was a figure of speech. It wasnt a literal drowning? He hesitated a little too long. I dont believe Ive ever witnessed a literal, human drowning in my life, and I hope I never will. You have a way of not quite lying but not quite telling the truth, either. Its a gift. He walked across the porch and down the steps, then looked up at her. Next time we go out, it wont involve six other people. That was not a date, Sean. We were not technically going out. But we will. Just you wait. Lock up, now. He climbed into his truck, but he didnt start the engine until shed had time to carry the cat inside, close the door and dead-bolt it. Then he flashed his headlights. The old signal was as blatant as saying it out loud. Good night. I love you. She jammed her hands into the pockets of her jeans so her fingers wouldnt be tempted to flash the porch light in answer. The truck roared out of the driveway and around the bend. Laura checked the clock. It was early. Not even ten. And as tired as she was, she knew she couldnt sleep. She might as well make a pot of decaf and try to accomplish something. Maybe shed tackle those dresser drawers. She didnt look forward to invading her mothers private space, but it had to be done. There was usually a bag of decaf in the freezer. Laura opened it and started poking around. Lots of frozen veggies and fruit. Not much meat. No red meat whatsoever, no convenience foods, and if there was any decaf it was well hidden. Reaching to the rear of the top shelf, she found a store-bought bag of peas and then a clear bag full of blackberries. Her mom had always placed the berries on a small pan, leaving space between them so they wouldnt stick together as they froze. Once they were solid, shed tumbled them into plastic bags and returned them to the freezer, perfect little morsels of summers sweetness for blackberry cobblers in midwinter. Laura tossed the peas back in and clutched the bag of berries with both hands. Her mom must have picked them last yearby herself, because her young helpers had grown up. Lost in bittersweet nostalgia for the days of berry picking in the lush growth near the tracks, Laura closed her eyes. She and her friends must have brought home thousands and thousands of berries over the years. Her fingers were freezing. Gently, she placed the bag on the shelf and shut the freezer. Her mom would have chided her for leaving the door open so long. The wind was stronger now, the sound of the wind chimes clearer. Shed always loved their cheerful noise, but now it set her nerves on edge. She couldnt stand it. Halfway to the back door, she recalled the shadowy figure sweeping across the yard. Onto the moonlit road. Into the cemetery. No. She didnt want to go out there alone and thrash her way through the bushes to take down the chimes. They hung from a branch of the star magnolia, surrounded by a tangle of shrubs. It would be hard enough to find them in broad daylight but nearly impossible in the dark. Far away, coyotes yipped, chilling her blood. Their eerie voices overlapped the random music of the chimes, like two radio stations coming in at the same time, competing with each other. The shadow of the overhead fan batted incessantly at the wall, the blades making their swift circle. The coyotes went silent all at once. There was no sound but the wind in the trees and the chimes. Then the wind stilled. Everything was hushed, as if the whole world waited for something to happen.          Across the road, a small crowd of churchgoers milled around the doors in the usual preservice socialization time. Not wanting them to think she was spying on them, Laura settled into a chair on the porch where shed be somewhat hidden by the lower branches of a pine. Late last night, shed found confirmation of one of her worst fears. This morning, in a fit of spite, shed deleted her moms number from her cell phone contacts. Shed used up the last of those frozen berries too. She wasnt sentimental about them anymore. Not after lying awake half the night, fuming over the note shed found in her mothers lingerie drawer. A whiff of baking cobbler escaped through the kitchen window. Her dad had always loved blackberry cobbler. With vanilla ice cream if they had it. Or whipped cream. Real whipped cream. And hed never put on a pound. Oh, Daddy, she whispered. His crazy accusation must have been true, after all. She looked up at a cloud made of bands of white and gray, chevroned. The wind had run through them like a knife through marble-cake batter. Across the road, the organist pumped out some unrecognizable hymn. Most of the churchgoers had disappeared inside the building, but stragglers were still arriving. She recognized a few vehicles, a few faces. There was Garys car. He swerved into a space, climbed out, and ran around to open Ardelles door, then the rear door. Cassie climbed out of the backseat in jeans and a hot-pink sweater. The three of them walked toward the church entrance, pausing to speak with two young women in flowery dresses. Gary put his arm around Ardelle and threw his head back, laughing at something. The young women laughed too, the wind rippling their skirts. They clutched Bibles like anchors to hold them to earth in the strong wind. Cassie looked over her shoulder toward the house. Laura leaned out from behind the pine and waved. Cassie waved back and made some kind of hand signal. Whatever, Laura said, watching all of them file into the church. Minutes later, Cassie sprinted across the road, across the yard, and up the steps. Breathless and laughing, she plopped herself into the chair beside Lauras. My folks probably think Im sitting in the back. My dad always said you were a corrupting influence, Laura said. Well, I can be in church pretty much any Sunday, but how often do I get to sit and visit with my oldest friend? But if you want to go, lets go. Cant. I have blackberry cobbler in the oven. Mmm, that settles it. Im not going to church. Its pretty obvious you didnt plan to anyway. Hows your mom doing? Pretty much the same. She has good days and bad days. She wont talk about anything important, and she gets mad if we suggest counseling. Laura nodded. Her dad had resisted counseling too. Not that her mom had ever pressed hard for it. Maybe she hadnt really cared. Mikey hopped onto a windowsill and meowed at them through the glass. Poor baby, Cassie said. Cant he even come onto the porch? No, hed be gone in a flash, and theres so much traffic now. Maybe he wouldnt last long outside, but hed die free and happy. Happy? Under somebodys tires? But he might be smarter than youre giving him credit for. I doubt it. He always heads straight to the road. Laura sighed. Ive been trying to decide whether or not to mention this, but I think you should know. Mikey escaped a couple of days ago because your mom let him out. My mom? Remember I told you she was overstepping her bounds? It was sweet of her to take care of things for me, but it was supposed to stop when I got into town. On Friday, she let herself in when I wasnt home. She tidied up again, and she fed Mikey and let him out. On the verge of mentioning the boxed-up journals, Laura stopped, troubled by the worry in Cassies eyes. Im so sorry, Laura. Ill say something to her. Dont. I just thought you should know. It might be part of the big picture of whatevers going on with her. Maybe. Anyway, I didnt come here to talk about weird parents. I came to talk about marriage proposals. I cannot believe you never told me Sean asked you to marry him. And you turned him down? He told you? He certainly did, and if we hadnt been in the middle of Trevors party I would have dragged you off somewhere and smacked some sense into you. His timing was terrible, Cassie. It was right in the middle of losing my dad. And we were so young. Then I took off for college in Colorado, and Sean and I sort of grew apart. Grow back together then. Duh. Its not that simple. Laura hesitated, running a finger back and forth on the arm of her chair while she sought the right words. Even when we were sixteen, seventeen, I knew I didnt want to be the daughter-in-law of a mean drunk. Oh, come on. Do you ever hear Sean calling Dale his father? No. Sean doesnt see him as his father, so you wouldnt have to see Dale as your father-in-law. Cassie Wait, Ive got it. Cassie clapped her hands. Ask Sean to move to Denver. Hed start packing. You know he would. And youd never see Dale again. Laura didnt answer, but if there was any chance that her dad would come home, she couldnt stay in Denver. Shed have to return to Prospectwhere Dale lived. Cassie scowled at her. What are you so scared of? Marriage in general? Or marriage to Sean? Laura shook her head. Can you at least understand why I couldnt even think about marriage the week we turned eighteen? The same week my dad disappeared? Youre right, Seans timing was terrible, but that was then. This is now. Now wouldnt be great timing either. With all thats going on, Im a mess. Yeah. Cassie slumped back in her chair. You are. I was worse then, though. You wouldnt believe what a mess I was. Well, sure. Youd just lost your dad. It was more than that. Laura stopped, weighing her words. Now that youve had a taste of what its like to live with a parent who has some issueseven though your moms issues are minor compared to my dadsmaybe you can understand better. Hed become so hard to live with. You have no idea. Then, when we thought hed drowned, I felt a huge sense of relief and freedom. I was glad he was gone. Cassie, I was glad. And I hated myself for it. Cassie didnt answer right away, but she didnt seem shocked. Finally she shrugged. That sounds pretty normal, really. And now you think you want him back? The muffled, faraway sound of the organ floated across the road toward them as the organist murdered Amazing Grace. Laura had sung that song with her dad so many times. Shed give anything for a chance to sing it with him again. Shed give anything to tell him that although shed hated his unpredictable mood swings, his volatility, shed never hated him. Shed loved him then and she loved him now. No matter what. Yes, I want him back, she said. Even if it takes a miracle. Youll need more than one miracle. Then Ill ask God for two. Or ten or twenty. Whatever it takes. Laura closed her eyes, and once again she inhaled the sweet aroma of blackberry cobbler. Shed never eat another blackberry her mom had picked. Never again.  Sean crouched on his back deck to watch the little albino raccoon feasting on the corn and table scraps laid out for him in the far corner. Silvery-white in the moonlight, the baby coon looked up, more curious than wary. Nobody needed another ordinary trash-can raider, but this white one was a novelty. Casper the ghost coon. Sean knew he shouldnt feed it. Hunters didnt feed coons, much less name them. Keith would never let him live it down if he found out about it. He wouldnt, though. Nobody would. Casper wouldnt last long. He was too easy to spot. Easy prey. Sean straightened. Casper scampered away, claws skittering on the smooth wood of the deck. Three seconds, and he was in the oak. He was easy to track through the branches, a pale blur in the night. The flash of white high in the tree took Sean back to the kite hed lost to the same tree when he was ten, not long after his mother passed away. Night after night, it had beat itself to death against the branches while he watched from his bedroom window. Dale had come home one day with an unexpected gift: a white and yellow kite. Seans first kite ever. Sensing that it was an apology for especially harsh treatment the night before, hed dared to hope that things were changing. Do your chores, boy, Dale had said. Then Ill help you put it together. But he was too drunk to help by the time Sean finished his chores. Keith was at work, bagging groceries, so Sean assembled the kite himself. Afraid hed be in hot water if he went as far as the park, he tried to fly it in the yard. Within minutes, it took a nosedive into the tree. Once Dale noticed, he wasnt too drunk to administer another beating. That was the last day Sean ever called him Dad. Following Keiths example, Sean started calling him Dale behind his back. A train was coming through from the south, its mournful, two-tone whistle piping a lonesome tune while the wheels beat a steady rhythm. Sean cocked his head, listening. Hed never minded living near the tracks. A train in the night was evidence that he wasnt the only soul awake. Was Laura awake, brooding over everything? He hadnt heard from her since hed dropped her off the night before. He hoped he hadnt scared her off by flashing his headlights. He went inside. The thunder of a coming storm mixed with his worries to keep him awake long after hed crawled into bed. He was wrestling with that vague memory of the car in the lake when his phone rang. He grabbed it from the bedside table and checked caller ID. It was Lauraand it was too late to be a happy call. He sat up straight. Hello. She didnt answer. Outside, a vehicle rushed past on the wet street, going too fast for a rainy night. Hello, he said again, hearing a faint noise on the other end. Laura? You okay? Sean! There she was, her voice high-pitched and shaky. Hes back. Who? Seans feet hit the floor. He switched on the lamp and grabbed his jeans from the chair. At the window. He The phone started cutting out. Words and fragments of words flitted in and out of his ear. Something about a beard. Was it your dad? He struggled to pull on his jeans with one hand, clamping the phone to his ear with his other hand. I dont The reception cut out again. Cursing the lousy connection, he fought one-handed with his zipper. Laura? You still there? Silence. The phone slipped out of his hand, hit the floor, and slid under the bed. He ran down the hall for his gun.          Nobody in his right mind would be out in this weather. The truck slued around the corner and fishtailed on the rainswept road. Sean maneuvered around a downed tree branch, swerved back to his own lane, and tromped on the accelerator. Between the swipes of the wipers, he could hardly see through the streaming glass. In less than a minute, he outran the neat layout of city blocks and crossed the railroad tracks at the edge of town where a criminal would have plenty of places to hideif he didnt mind lurking under tall trees in a thunderstorm. Kim would have advised calling the professionals. He couldnt, now that hed dropped his phone, but a loaded gun had to be worth a couple of phones. The truck fishtailed again as he hauled it around the bend by the church, tires sliding on wet pavement. The house was dark. He pulled into the drive and killed the engine but left the headlights shining while he put his hands on his gun. He didnt see anybody, but that didnt mean somebody wasnt out there. Elliott? Dale? Or a stranger. A stranger might be easier to deal with. He shut off the headlights. The churchs security lights still reached toward him from across the road. Theyd make his bare skin as visible as the albino coons white fur. He should have grabbed a shirt. A black one. Gun in hand, he opened the door and slid out. With cold rain pelting his back, he crouched beside the truck. But he didnt know which side of the truck the intruder was on. He held still, letting his eyes adjust to the dark. No noise but wind and rainand a strange absence, like a hole in the night. Spooky. No time to figure it out. He straightened, closed the door, and started for the house at a fast walk. Didnt want to run; didnt want to show his fear. He was soaked before his feet hit the steps. The rain pounded the porchs tin roof like artillery, masking his knock, but Laura cracked the door open immediately. She opened it wider, beckoned him in and pushed him to the side. He heard the bolt sliding home, the scrape of chair legs on the floor and a metallic sound. She was shoving a chair under the knob. Where was he? Sean whispered, his heart pounding, his nose dripping rain. Looking in the kitchen window. I screamed. Dropped a mug in the sinksmashed itand he ran. That clipped, staccato speech wasnt her usual style. Did you get a good look? No. It happened so fast. He was therehe was gone. And you know how nearsighted I am without my contacts or glasses. His eyes were growing accustomed to the black room. Laura was wearing Jesss white bathrobe. In the silence, his breath coming fast, he tried again to identify why the wind and the rain sounded so different tonight. Something was missing. Goose bumps stirred the hairs on his wet skin. Youve seen somebody twice, just since youve been back in town. Yes, she whispered. He could only think of the flash of brown in the green, the first day Laura was back in town, when hed walked her home from church. It might have been a man in camo, and that made three times. Tonight, it was my dad, she said. I know it was. How can you know, if you couldnt really see his face? And if it was your dad, why did he run? She pulled in a sharp breath. Because I screamed. I screamed at the top of my lungs. I didnt mean to. I didnt want to scare him away. The scream that would scare a banshee. Lets go in the den, Sean said. Thats where you always felt safe when Slattery was prowling around, remember? Maybe weve got ourselves another Slattery. He led her there, holding her hand. The den was pitch-black, its heavy drapes drawn tight. He placed the gun on the floor, switched on a lamp, and tugged her down beside him on the double rocking chair. He was freezing, his shoulders still wet. Shed found her glasses. She studied him with those solemn brown eyes framed by brown plastic, but she didnt speak. We need security lights everywhere, he said. Well light up the place like Vegas. You need new locks too. And an alarm system. She only shrugged. He put his arm around her but resisted the notion to kiss the top of her head. He started the loveseat rocking. It should have been a comforting motion, but it only created a breeze on his damp skin, chilling him. A gust of wind and rain battered the house. Laura tensed. Not wanting to scare her off, he resisted the impulse to pull her closer. As long as she was in his arms, she was safe from whoever had been at her window. Except one mans body wasnt much of a shield. He couldnt be with her twenty-four hours a day, either. There are guns in your dads gun safe, he said. You have the right to defend yourself if anybody breaks in. And you have a phone. Im glad you called me, but you need to call 911 too, if it happens again. Im not calling 911, she said. You told me the sheriff thinks the rumors are bogus. He wont even care. Hell care about a man whos walking around town, looking in windows. If you wont call the sheriff, youre staying somewhere else. My house, the Brights house, I dont care. Or Im staying here. Then youre staying here, she said. She sat stiffly in the dark, breathing fast and trembling like a hummingbirds wings.  At a quarter to four, rain still hammered the windows. The house was an ark tossed about on a stormy ocean, with only two souls aboard. Three, if she counted the cat. But someone else had been out there in the night. Trying to remain calm and act normal, Laura walked into the kitchen and caught Sean scratching Mikeys chin and crooning some kind of nonsense to him. Since when have you been so nice to Mikey? she asked. He looked up, wearing a blue shirt that brought out the intense color of his eyes. He must have borrowed it from her dads closet. How about some coffee? Why not? Well never get back to sleep anyway. Coming right up. He went straight to the cupboard that held the good Costa Rican stuff. He knew where the coffee filters were too, and he knew how to coax the beat-up coffee grinder into operating. Laura opened a different cupboard to pull out a couple of mugs. There was her dads favorite, right where it belonged. She rested her fingers on the handle. Black, plain, the mug had a hairline crack and a white chip on the rim. Mom had nagged him to throw it out but he wouldnt. She could have thrown it out once he was gone, but maybe shed turned sentimental about it. Maybe shed even come to regret the affair. Or she was just a pack rat. Laura pulled the mug from the cupboard. So many times, shed seen her dad warming his big hands around that chipped mug. Sometimes hed curved a hand tenderly around her mothers cheek too, in a kind of benediction. Laura. Seans voice was nearly in her ear. What? You okay? I dont think you heard a word I said. Hed been talking? Im fine. Ignoring Sean just behind her, she put the black mug on the counter, chose one for herself, and rummaged in the cupboard for the sugar bowl. Sean poured coffee for both of them. Still take yours like a man? Yes, thanks. She took her black coffee to the table and wrapped her hands around the heat of the crockery. Now, what were you talking about? Nothing important. His spoon clinked softly as he stirred in his usual boatload of sugar. She tried her coffee. He was right. The Costa Rican stuff was good. Good and strong. Is that cobbler? he asked. Yep. Help yourself. You dont want any? No, thank you. She closed her eyes, seeing those purple berries piled up in a bucket in the late-summer sun. Seeing her moms long, slender fingers brushing the frozen berries into a plastic bag. Tucking them away for later. The perfect breakfast, Sean said. Coffee and cobbler. She kept her eyes closed and didnt answer, just listened to the sounds as he clattered around, dishing up a serving of the cobbler and then settling into the chair across from hers. His fork clinked against the plate. Delicious. Your moms recipe? No. Its one I found online. She hadnt wanted to open her moms recipe file. It would have unleashed memories of baking together. Making her dads favorite suppers. Being a happy family, most of the time. But she couldnt forget that last big blowup either. Laura shuddered and opened her eyes. Sean had his last bite of cobbler halfway to his mouth. Whats wrong? Nothing. No. Tell me whats wrong. The cobbler, she blurted. Its the lastthe last She couldnt say it. Looking bewildered, he pointed the fork toward the dish on the counter. No, theres plenty more. You want some? No. I dont meanIts not the last of the cobbler. She steeled herself, making her voice hard and clear. I made the cobbler with the last of the berries my mom ever picked. Aw, Laura. Abandoning his last bite, he came around the table and crouched beside her. He took her hand in his. Youll be missing her for a long, long time. But thats not it. Itsits about something Ive kept from you too long. Oh Sean, I dont want to tell you, but youll need to knowespecially if my dad comes back. All right. Sean sat in the chair beside hers. He didnt let go of her hand. This will sound stupid. Youll think theres no connection between blackberries and thisother topic. But bear with me. Okay. When we were teenagers, I heard my folks arguing. Wanting to stop right there, she made herself keep going. Dad accused her of being unfaithful. Sean flinched almost as if shed slapped him. Did they know you were listening? No. They were right here in the kitchen, and I was around the corner. Id left to spend the night at Cassies house, but I came back for my toothbrush. I only listened for a minute. When was this? About a month before he disappeared. She had an affair, Sean. He found out. He made his plans, and he walked away. If you thought it was related, why didnt you mention it when he went missing? We thought hed died, remember? And II didnt want to believe it was anything more than his paranoia. I thought it was best to give her the benefit of the doubt. Did she acknowledge that there was any truth to it? I dont know. I didnt eavesdrop long enough to find out. He shook his head. Maybe it wasnt true. But since then, Ive wondered about things I saw over the years. Clues that she was a little too friendly with a certain someone. She stopped, hating to say it. Last night, I found aa naughty note in her dresser. A note in masculine writing. Theres no signature, but its not my dads writing. Does anybody else know about this? Nope. Then Laura managed a half smile. I expect the other man knows. Do you know who it was? Think for a minute, Sean. You know. Itll come to you. She started a silent count to ten. At six, Seans eyes widened. Gibby. Thats my theory. By the time we were in high school, my dad was practically impossible to live with. Maybe shed started looking for someone new, and there was Gibby. Always so charming and available. And he came through town every few months. He still does. Hell be here for the weekend. I could ask him if its true, but part of me would rather not know. Id rather just forgive both of them, as if I know its true, and let it go. Thats probably a good way to handle it. But remember, you dont know the timing of the note. It might have been written long after your dad was gone. Maybe, but the simplest explanation is that the argument I overheard was about her and Gibby. And Dad walked away a month later. Seeing the sadness in Seans eyes, Laura squeezed his hand. I didnt want to tell you, Sean. Im sorry. Im sorry too, but Im glad you told me. It does put a different spin on things. He tilted his head, studying her. You think this proves that your dad walked away instead of drowning, dont you? Im about ninety-nine percent convinced. Thats a mighty big leap. I know, but it all fits. I only hope that if hes alive, he wont pick next weekend to come back. When Gibbys in town. That could be a real problem. Frowning, Sean reached across the table to retrieve his coffee. It must have cooled, but he drank it anyway, staring into space. He made no move to finish eating his cobbler. Now its your turn, Laura said. I told you a whopper of a secret. When will you explain that figurative drowning? He looked up, startled, then smiled. Compared to what you just told me, its nothing. Years ago, I saw somebody sending a car into the little lake on old man Bennetts land. She pondered it for a moment. You meanlike somebody stole a car and had to get rid of it? That would make sense, wouldnt it? Its just funny that Annie made such a big deal of it. He picked up his fork and worked at straightening a crooked tine. I guess she didnt hear everything so she had to fill in the blanks from her imagination. I guess. Thunder boomed, making both of them jump. Here comes another round, Sean said. Nobody will be out in this. Laura was sure hed meant to make her feel safe from intruders, but she could only think about her father, cold and wet and miserable. Somewhere.          Laura woke, her feet cold and her cheek itching against the rough fabric of the couch cushion. Instantly, she remembered the bearded man at the window. She and Sean had sat in silence for a long time after theyd moved back to the living room. They hadnt turned on any lights, though an occasional flash of lightning had shown her his troubled expression. She sat up and examined her elbow. In a few days, the bruise wouldnt be visible anymore. Sean still hadnt noticed it. The heavy old quilt lay across her. Sean must have tucked her in after she nodded off. With his gun by his side, he lay on the hooked rug on the hardwood floor, his angular features softened by the shadows of morning. No pillow, no quilt. His hair was tousled and messy. His stubborn mouth was relaxed in sleep. She had her work cut out for her, but she had to convince him that her visitor wasnt a criminal, wasnt a ghost. It was Elliott Gantt in the flesh, wandering around in a terrible storm and frightened away by his own daughters scream. She could hardly bear the thought. She swung her feet to the floor, then arranged the warm quilt over Seans long frame, pleased with the idea of transferring her body heat to him. He didnt stir, even when she pulled the quilt up to his whiskery chin and touched his cheek with one finger. Some bodyguard you are, she said. He still didnt wake. He should have been in his own bed, getting a good nights sleep. No, he should have been hard at work already, making all those mysterious little tweaks to the nearly finished instruments that he wanted to sell at his festival booth. He should have been proofreading his brochures so the printer could have them ready by Friday morning at the latest. To get Sean back where he belonged, working toward his dream, shed have to convince him she wasnt in danger. After last night, it wouldnt be easy. She tiptoed around him and went into the kitchen, where Mikey swatted her leg in a silent demand for food. She gave him a can of chicken and liver, his favorite. When she opened the trash to throw the can away, she saw shards of angels and rainbowsthe remains of the angel mug that shed dropped in the sink when she saw the man at the window. Sean had cleaned up the wreckage. The window framed a sky of the brightest blue. Small tree limbs and scattered leaves lay across the yard, varying shades of brown and green on the lawn. Sunlight glistened in still puddles. No branches moved. The wind had worn itself out in the night. She recalled those deep-set eyes meeting hers for a fraction of a second. Shed screamed, and the man had ducked out of sight. It couldve been Dale. He had a beard too. But his eyes werent that deep set, were they? She was almost certain it was her dad, but after all that time in the wild, his appearance would have changed. His mind and his heart might have changed too. He might have left signs of his visit. After Laura dressed, she put her phone in her pocket. Blocking Mikeys escape, she stepped onto the leaf-strewn porch. It was cold and damp beneath her bare feet. Beyond the borders of the yard, green billows of kudzu were taking over. A whole regiment of men could hide in the luxuriant growth. The world was holding its breath. No wind blew, not even enough breeze to move the chimes. She couldnt see them, hidden as they were by shrubs, but she imagined the silvery cylinders hanging motionless among the drenched leaves. There would be no footprints. The storm would have washed them away. Just as time had washed away the evidence of her mothers guilt or innocence. Then the aneurysm had taken her life. Her voice had been so calm, last Christmas, when she casually mentioned that shed already made her funeral arrangements, wanting to get them off her mind for good. Less than six months later, she was gone. Maybe shed had a premonition. She opened her phone and checked the time. It wasnt too early for a call. Cassie answered on the second ring, sounding groggy. Good morning, but next time remember Im still on California time. Good morning, Eeyore. Yeah. Whats up? I have a favor to ask. Laura made her voice bright and cheerful. Sean is so paranoid about prowlers, its ridiculous. Hes sticking to me like glue. Playing bodyguard. Lucky girl. Hes one cute bodyguard. Hes one busy luthier. He needs to be in his shop, doing prep work for the weekend. Whats to do? He only needs to show up at his booth and flash that adorable smile at the ladies, and hell sell instruments like hotcakes. Theres a little more to it than that. And would you please stop trying to make him sound soso Gorgeous and sweet and sexy? Cassie. Stop it. Cassie laughed. Okay, okay. Whats the favor? If Im here, hell insist on being here too. Can I hang out at your house today? And spend the night? Or is that a problem, given your moms situation? Not a problem. Shes pretty darned normal most of the time. Come on over, anytime. Thanks. Maybe Ill bring some of my moms papers to sort through. Good idea. Bring enough busywork so my mom wont draft you to help with her eternal scrapping. Cassie yawned. Well have a sleepover tonight. Ill see ya when you show up. Ill be there soon. Laura closed her phone, pleased with herself for having told the truth but not the whole truth. Cassie didnt need to know about the man at the window. Not yet.  Throwing off the remnants of sleep, Sean raised his head and frowned at the quilt on his chest. He couldnt comprehend how it got there. Something poked his side. Rise and shine, bodyguard. Youve been sleeping on the job. He blinked. Laura came into focus, sitting on the couch with her big toe prodding his ribs. Shed changed to jeans and a sleeveless white shirt. The outfit reminded him of long, hot days, fishing on Hamlin Lake before it had become the scene of a tragedy. Before shed moved to Denver, where she turned pale in the wintertime. He wanted her to move back, to go fishing with him and get her fishermans tan backexcept shed insist on sunscreen for both of them. He seized her foot. Sorry, but thats the kind of service a client gets when she doesnt pay her bodyguard one red cent. Her foot escaped his grasp. The coffees free, though. You want some? Yeah. Ill make it. Why do you always insist on making it? You make it too strong. Wimp, she said. Her smile wasnt quite genuine. And no wonder, after the bomb shed dropped on him in the middle of the night. But if she didnt want to talk anymore about her mom and Gibby, neither did Sean. Hed rather not even think about it. He rose, dropped the quilt on the couch, then picked up his gun and placed it on top of Jesss tall, thirty-year-old television cabinet that hadnt held a TV in years. In the kitchen, he pulled the coffee out of the cupboard. He filled the lid of the coffee grinder with beans and dumped them into the hopper. But the grinder was obstinate. He picked it up and shook it. This thing has a short in it somewhere. He pressed the button again, and it decided to work. He faced Laura, his mind swimming with ideas about security lights, alarms, peepholes in the doors. We need a plan. Ive got one. Part of one, anyway. Ill spend the day at the Brights house. The night too. Then you wont feel like you have to baby-sit me. The knot of tension inside him began to unwind. Good idea. Im already packed, and Cassies expecting me. She says well have a sleepover. I guess shell want to watch movies and eat junk food. Excellent, he said, already starting to tune out the rest. As the coffee brewed, he made his plans. With Laura safe and sound at the Brights place, hed be free to take care of business. She poured coffee for both of them, putting hers in a travel mug, and regarded him with a solemn expression. While Im gone, she said softly, if anybody shows up, whether its my dad or someone else, I dont want any guns. Understand? Sean hesitated, picturing himself face to face with an intruder. Keith had learned in the service that if somebodys aiming at you, you dont mess around. It aint Hollywood, Keith said. Aim to killor be killed. The guy at the window probably wasnt your dad, Laura. Understand? You have no way of knowing that. But heres the bottom line. My dads safety is my top concern. Dont be trigger-happy, just in case its him. Do you understand? Sean was silent. As far as he knew, Elliott had never hurt anybody except the time he blew up at Gary and the time he decked Dale. Maybe the fact that Gibby lived in Nashville had saved him. Laura took a step closer. Sean, I know youre safety conscious, but accidents happen. You dont want to accidentally shoot Dale either, do you? He chuckled. Now that you mention it Thats not funny. Promise me. No guns. No guns while youre gone, he said with a sigh. You mean it? I mean it. But when she came back, that was a different story. And dont go around telling people what happened last night. Remember, I dont want the sheriffs department to get involved. I cant tell law enforcement no guns. Sean considered her request. He was willing to get the law involved if Lauras safety was at stake, but not just to track down rumors. Shed be perfectly safe at the Brights house. And he would find a way to make her stay longer than overnight. Youre right, he said. I wont tell anybody. Okay, then. Im off. And dont you dare baby-sit the house all day. She tapped his chest with her forefinger. Sean Michael Halloran, up-and-coming luthier, doesnt have time to moonlight as a house-sitter. The festival starts on Friday. Fridays just the warmup, remember? I wont open my booth until Saturday morning. And Saturday will be here before you know it. Go home and get to work. He was already making a mental list of the tools hed pick up. His phone too. He couldnt live without his phone. Yes maam, he said. Finally, she smiled. Good boy. She picked up Mikey and kissed the top of his head. You be a good boy too. Dont run off. Sean moved closer. I should stick my head between you and the cat so youll kiss me by accident. You might even like it. I promise I dont have fleas. Neither does Mikeyand he never bosses me around. She rubbed her face against Mikeys and set him on the floor. But Im a better kisser than Mikey, Sean said. I have real lips. Im sure you remember them. Like I remember yours. Her cheeks turned pink, but she didnt answer. She slung the handles of a small overnight bag over her shoulder and crouched to pick up a cardboard file box that looked a little too heavy for her. Let me get it, whatever it is. Its Moms papers to sort through, she said in a matter-of-fact tone that belied the blush on her face. Itll give me something to do while I listen to Ardelles chitchat. Good luck with that. He nudged her out of the way and took charge of the box. She headed toward her moms SUV instead of her own car. Shed already put For Sale signs in the windows. He followed, hobbling barefoot across the sharp gravel. While Laura climbed behind the wheel, he put the box in the back of the SUV and shut the door. The vehicle had been kept in the garage since shortly after Jess died, and old, dried marks from the wiper blade still made a gray peacocks fan on the dirty glass of the rear window. The last time she drove to town, it must have been a rainy day. Her last day to run errands. Bye, Laura called, using that matter-of-fact tone again. Bye. Be good. You too. She started the engine and then leaned her head out the window. Thanks for staying with me. Im glad you called. Picking his way back over the gravel, Sean remembered finding that secondhand SUV for Jess. Shed wanted something reliable to last ten years or so. Hed kidded her about ditching her old minivan because she was tired of the soccer mom image that came with it. Shed joked about wanting to be a soccer grandma one day. He pictured three or four redheads playing soccer. Riding their bikes. Bouncing on a trampoline, screaming, having a ball. Maybe one of them would be a little girl dragging a doll along everywhere she went. Lord willing, someday hed be the kind of father who would teach a kid how to fly a kite or swing a hammer or play a guitar. The kind of father who gave hugs. The kind of father who couldnt make a kid cower in a corner just by looking at him. On the steps, he brushed gravel from the soles of his feet and looked up in time to see the SUV disappear around the bend. He blew out a long sigh of relief. Laura was safe. He wondered what he would do if their trespasser had a gun. Especially if he proved to be Elliott after all. Sean couldnt imagine firing at a broken-down wreck of a man, but he couldnt picture Elliott that way. Hed always been a lithe, strong outdoors-man with a quick smile. Hed had a simple tattoo on one muscular forearm, the lettering vaguely Celtic in style. The two words looked as if theyd been lifted from the middle of a sentence because they werent capitalized: life everlasting, with the tail of the g curving into the purple vein on his wrist. Elliott had never volunteered anything about the significance of the tattoo, and Sean had never asked. Slowly, he walked inside. Life everlasting was all well and good, but he had to focus on the here and now. Hed start with a trip to the hardware store.          Laura was about to lower the file box to the Brights doorstep so shed have a hand free to use the shiny brass door knocker, but the door swung open. Cassie stood there in a tank top and cutoffs, her hair turbaned in a pale yellow towel. She took the box, leaving Laura with nothing to carry but her purse and the overnight bag. Come on in, Cassie said. Lets go back to my room. Well, its the guest room. I dont exactly have my own room here. Wheres your mom? On the phone with Tig. Laura followed Cassie across travertine tiles to the living room, where the funeral plants were still clustered around the fireplace, then down the hall to the plush white carpet of a sunny bedroom. The walls were an even softer shade of the towels yellow. The bed linens and the curtains were tastefully subdued but almost too well coordinated with each other. Very nice, Laura said, taking it in. Just like the rest of the house. I feel like Ive stepped into a decorating magazine. Yeah, it makes me feel like a peon. We live in the tiniest, ugliest apartment ever. Youll have to come see us sometime so you can feel superior. Aw, rats. Here comes my mom already. Ardelle stuck her head in. Is that Laura I hear? Hey, honey. Its so good to see you. Are you doing all right? Most of the time. Oh, I know its hard. Your mom was the sweetest soul. She and your dad loved each other so much. Ardelle came closer, twisting her hands together. Well never know what he went through in the war, but she was so good to him even when he had his moods. She never even looked at another man after he drowned. Laura only nodded, keeping her expression neutral, although her heart felt like a battlefield. Itd be such a shame if its true that hes alive, now that its too late because shes dead Mom, Cassie scolded. Dont be insensitive. Youre about to make Laura cry. But wouldnt it be wonderful if hes alive? Tig says old Mrs. Gustafson is spreading stories about seeing him on the road by their house. Lauras heart thumped. When? Ardelle waved the question away with her plump hand. Oh, I didnt ask for details. You know I dont like to meddle in other folks business. Mother dear, Cassie said firmly, you are the biggest meddler and gossip I know. I am not. You let yourself into Lauras house a few days ago without permission, didnt you? Laura put her hand on Cassies arm. Stop, Cassie. Let it go. But Cassie was on a roll. And you let the cat get out, Mom. He could have been hit by a car. Ardelle hung her head. I was only trying to help. Its called breaking and entering, Cassie snapped. Jess gave me a key! I was her most trusted friend. Ardelles eyes filled with tears. Laura, you asked me to feed the cat and all, and now youre calling me a thief? No, Laura said gently. Nobodys calling you a thief. Its just that I dont need your help anymore, now that Im in town. Well, I never! You asked for my help. Ardelles chin quivered. If you dont want me in your mothers home, I dont want you in mine. She flounced out of the room. Laura stared at the empty doorway. What had happened to warm-hearted, fun-loving Ardelle? I dont believe it, Cassie said. The drama mama is kicking you out. She flopped onto the bed, flinging one arm over her face in a fake swoon. Lets ignore her awhile and see what happens. No. Not when shes this upset. Id better not stay. Cassie lifted her arm just enough so she could peer at Laura. Youre abandoning me? Sorry, but youre the one who got her riled up, so youre the one who gets to calm her down. Dont be too hard on her, though. She might not want to behave the way shes behaving. I know, Cassie said mournfully. She sat up on the bed. It was really weird, wasnt it? Really unlike her. I hate to worry Dad, but Id better tell him. He absolutely needs to know. Ill call you later and see how shes doing. Laura gathered the things shed brought and headed out again. Shed stay away for a while. Ardelles comments had hurt. But there was no time for tears. Driving back to town, Laura tried to remember exactly where the Gustafsons lived. With a little luck, shy Mrs. Gustafson might be home alone and able to describe exactly what she saw, without any interference from her bossy husband.  Sean hit the brakes, approaching the long curve by Jesss house. Lauras house, now, but probably not for long. A dollar to a doughnut, shed put it on the market and head back to Denver. Hed move there too, if he thought she might want his company. It was nearly noon. That gave him time to finish by dark. He was still waiting for a call back from a security company, but hed already picked up everything he could install himself. If he could talk Laura into staying with the Brights until everything blew over, maybe his precautions werent even necessary. But they couldnt hurt. The house came into viewand Jesss SUV stood in the driveway, bold as brass. The vehicle Laura had driven away in. There she was, at the edge of the road. In one hand, she carried a big plastic pitcher like the kind his mom had always used for mixing up Kool-Aid. In the other hand, she carried a tall tin vase. Either not noticing him or ignoring him, Laura hurried across the road, her hair somewhat tamed by the black-and-white bandanna shed adopted as her own. Surefooted as a kid, she started up the steps set into the grassy bank. Sean parked behind the SUV. Leaving his purchases in the truck and feeling like a paranoid fool, he followed her across the road. He didnt expect any trouble on a bright, sunny afternoon, with the pastors car parked in the lot, but he wasnt letting her out of his sight. And he was glad to have his phone in his pocket again, just in case. A mourning dove burst out of the dogwood by the Gantt family plot as Laura slowed and stopped there. She set both containers on the ground and twisted her hands behind her back, her head bowed. Not wanting to intrude on her privacy, Sean waited at a distance and looked around the cemetery. Bushes and small trees had been planted beside other graves too. Some of the headstones were tipping. Some had fallen. Some were covered with lichen and darkened with age. Jesss grave, though, was all too recent and still unmarked by a headstone, and the bronze plaque that bore Elliotts name still gleamed as if it were new. He eyed the jungle of vines that backed the graveyard. A day at a time, an inch at a time, the mass of green crept forward, slashed back annually by a small army of men from the church and browned every winter by the first frost. The churchs weathered picnic pavilion stood on one side of the property, the cemetery lay on the other, and the church stood in the middle, dividing life from death. Keeping them at arms length. The life sidepicnics, parties, supper on the grounds. The death sidefunerals, headstones, bones. But all those crosses didnt mean a thing if death wasnt the doorway to eternal life. He looked back at Laura. Her coppery hair spilled down her back from beneath the bandanna, bright as a new penny in the sun. Shed always stood out in a crowd like a redbird in a flock of sparrows. She reached into the pitcher and pulled out clippers, then walked to a mass of pink azaleas that bordered the church property. Working quickly, she gathered an armload of long branches bursting with blooms. The hedge was so full, nobody would notice shed cut some. Tired of waiting, he moved a step closer. Laura, he called in the no-nonsense tone he used on Keiths boys when they tried to pull a fast one. She turned to face him. Hey, Sean. I thought you were staying at the Brights place. She waved it away. Long story. Anyway, I thought you were going to work. Why did you come back? Im installing some new locks and so on. But you wont be here overnight, will you? Yes, I will. Ardelle got pretty upset with me. She thinks I accused her of being a thief. Did you? Of course not. I was a little irritated with her because shed let herself in one day when I wasnt home, but Cassie made a federal case of it and things escalated. Lets just say Ardelle isnt the same old fun-loving Ardelle I remember from years ago. Stay at my house, then. No, Sean. Thank you. His jaw tightened as she returned to the family plot, where she filled the tin container with azalea branches and placed it at her moms grave. She walked to the nearest faucet, filled the pitcher, and came back to pour water into the vase. No flowers for Elliott, of course. She believed he was alive. There, she said, putting the clippers in the empty plastic pitcher. Now it doesnt look so abandoned. So lonesome. The almost imperceptible trembling of her voice prompted Sean to take a closer look at her. You okay? Not really. I justwell, yesterday morning I was so upset about that stupid note in Moms drawer that I deleted her number from my phone and I used up the last of the blackberries on purpose, and now I see how petty and mean-spirited that was and I want to tell her Im sorry, but shes not here. She stopped to take a breath. So Im putting flowers on her grave, but it doesnt do any good. Sounds like youre having a rough day, he said cautiously. She made a face. Ive crammed a lot of craziness into one morning. After I left Ardelles I checked out a rumor about a prowler The Gustafsons? I heard that one too. Turned out to be their neighbor. She nodded sadly. So that was a wild-goose chase. Then I didnt know where to go. Ardelle doesnt want me there, and you dont want me here. So I went to the cabin. Sean tensed, not liking the idea at all. Why the cabin? She studied the ground. Youll think this is stupid, but on Friday I left some food and clothes there for my dad. Theyre gone. Oh, Laura. Anybody could have taken them. She raised her chin. I know, but it didnt do any harm to leave them there. Sean moved closer. Dont go back alone, though. We dont know who might be hanging around. We still dont know who was at your window last night either, or what he was up to. If its not a good time to stay at the Brights house, you can stay at mine. Then your nighttime visitor wont know where to find you. Dont you understand? I want him to find me. Not if its a stranger, you dont. A criminal. Please, be reasonable. Im being perfectly reasonable, she said sweetly. Youre the one who isnt. She looked both ways for traffic and ran back to the house with her plastic pitcher. That was her idea of being reasonable? Thoroughly exasperated with her irrational decisions, he followed slowly. After shed gone inside, he glanced over his shoulder, wondering if someone might have been watching them from the far side of the cemetery. In the noonday sun, the azaleas were such a vivid pink that they didnt look real. He stopped at his truck to retrieve his tools and the bags from the hardware store. He sorted out his purchases, found one of the new locksets, and sat down on the porch with the front door open so he could remove the old lock. Laura walked up behind him. If you have to sit there with the door wide open, Id better lock Mikey in the bathroom. Thanks. I forgot about Mikey. But I wish you cared about your own safety as much as you care about his. Hes just a cat. If its his day to die, its his day to die. Laura cornered Mikey a few feet from the door and scooped up a writhing armful of resentful feline. Today isnt that day. She carted Mikey away. Sean heard the soft plop as she deposited the cat on the bathroom floor, and then the click of the latch as she shut him in. She came back, her face solemn. I do appreciate everything youre doing, Sean. Really, I do. Thank you. You need to let me know what I owe you for the locks and all. But as soon as youve finished, you need to hole up in your shop and finish those instruments. You want to see some of them on stage in Nashville someday, remember? Not as much as he wanted to see them in the hands of children. Children with his last name and Lauras red hair. But that would never happen if he couldnt keep her safe. In a little while, maybe Ill run home and bring back some projects to work on, he said. You can come with me. Wont I be safe behind the new deadbolts? In broad daylight? He shrugged and went back to work. Oh no, she said. You know what I just realized? What? The new locks will make it look like I really think Ardelles a thief. She sighed. Id better call Cassie and see if her mom has calmed down at all. She retreated into the depths of the house, leaving Sean alone with his worries.          Her mothers morning freak-out had left Cassie drowning in guilt. It was her fault for coming down so hard on her. The sharp knife hit the cutting board in a steady rhythm as Ardelle made exquisitely thin tomato slicesfar more than she needed for only two sandwiches. They were going to be awesome sandwiches, though. Cassies folks didnt eat cheapo white bread anymore. Now they could afford whole-grain bread from the bakery and expensive, thin-sliced meats from the deli. Deli cheese too, and fancy mustard. The kind that cost four bucks for a four-ounce jar. That was sixteen dollars a pound. Her mom had been fussing with the sandwiches for at least ten minutes, but finally she was satisfied. She sliced them on the diagonal, placed them on pretty plates, and started garnishing the plates with gourmet bread-and-butter pickle slices. Cassies cell phone rang. Shed expected a call back from Drew, but it wasnt his ring tone. It was Lauras. Mom, Ive got a call. Go ahead and start eating without me. All right, sweetie, her mom said. Tell Drew hey for me. Cassie walked to the far side of the sunroom and looked out over the glittering turquoise of the pool. Sup? she said softly. Hi, Laura said. I just wanted to check in. Is your mom still upset? Not really. Now shes being super sweet, like she feels terrible about overreacting. I feel terrible about it too, but it mightve been good that it happened, you know? She might wake up and realize she needs some help. I hope so. Everything okay over at your place? Pretty much, yes. Seans changing the locks, but it has nothing to do with keeping your mom out. It was his idea, in case my prowler comes back. Hes such a great guy. Sos Keith. Their mom must have been a good influence on them before she died, because theyre not a bit like Dale. Enough, Laura said firmly. Right. Cassie turned toward the kitchen. Now her mom seemed to be rearranging the stacks of pickles on the plates. You wouldnt believe how long it took my mom to make a couple of sandwiches just now, she said softly. Shes still fiddling with them. Its insane. Nobody is one hundred percent sane. Lauras voice wavered. Aw, Laura. You sound like you need a shoulder to cry on. If you try to point me toward Seans shoulder, I will hang up on you. All right, all right. Are you okay, though? Really? Im sorry I snapped at you. Im just so tired. Once everything calms down, Ill want to make sure everythings okay between your mom and me. Bye. Okay. Ill keep you posted. But Laura had already ended the call. She never ended a call so abruptly. She must have been about to start crying. She wasnt the only one. Cassies insides were a muddle of worries. She wanted Drew to help her sort things out, but he was so tied down to his business that she couldnt keep him on the phone long enough for a meaningful conversation. He cared. Of course he cared. He was just too busy to talk to his wife. Her dad had been too busy for his wife too, for years. If all entrepreneurs were that way, Sean would be too busy for Laura. Theyd be better off without each other. Give up on the matchmaking, Cassie whispered. Marriage wasnt all it was cracked up to be. Sniffling a little, she practiced a happy face for her mothers benefit and walked back inside.  It was only late afternoon but Laura was so short on sleep that she could have sworn it was midnight. She and Sean had eaten an early supper because theyd both forgotten to eat lunch. Finished with the cleanup, which meant throwing away paper plates and a pizza box, she peeked out the kitchen window. Sean stood at the porch railing, looking up at the mountains. After a nearly windless day, a healthy breeze streamed through the gap, playing with his wild-man hair that lay straight and long on his collar. His shirt nearly matched the shade of his faded jeans. Hed stood there a long time. Either he expected to see her dad stroll out of some little hollow, or he thought it was a good spot to play bodyguard. He took the role seriously. Except for a quick trip to pick up the pizza and to grab a few things from his house, hed stayed all day, obsessing over the locks and the security lights while she sorted her moms belongings. Blocking Mikeys escape route with her foot, Laura stepped onto the porch. She hoped the stiff wind would blow itself out before dark. She didnt want to spend another night with her imagination making footfalls out of every gust and her dads voice out of every scraping branch. Sean hummed some sad tune as he studied the mountains. Shed always loved to watch him when he was wrapped up in a song, his eyes dreamy. She could have stood there all night, listening. He had always been there for her. Hed stuck up for her, from the playground in primary school to the halls of the high school. Sure, he tried to act like he was her bossthen and nowbut that went both ways. In spite of their eternal power struggle, they would always be friends. Maybe they could be more than friends again, someday. Somewhere far from Dale. She recognized the melody Sean was hummingan old Scots ballad about crows watching a man die in the wilderness. It had been funny in a macabre way when her dad sang it, years ago. Now? Not so much. Thats a gruesome song, she said. Yeah. Sorry. He looked at her, looked at her hard. Are you all right? Yes. Go on home, Sean. Nothing has happened all day, and nothings going to happen all night. Ill be fine, especially now with the new locks and the security lights. Im staying. Deal with it. Laura didnt argue. Deep inside, she didnt want to be alone. She joined him at the railing. Scanning the hills, she imagined her dad home again. She could almost remember his voice. Almost. Whats wrong? Sean asked. Drat him. He read her too easily. It has been kind of a tough day, she said. And maybe its just because Im so tired, but I cant seem to get Dads face out of my mind, but I cant quite remember him either. Not clearly. Not his face, not his voice. Its all muddy. I know what you mean. And its like my heart is divided. One part hopes I can have him back. The other part is afraid I cantor Ill have him back but hell be too changed. Sean only nodded, leaving her to sort out her fears in silence. Even if her dad was alive, even if he came back, he might be beyond mending. He might as well have died. Yet she still hoped. Fear and hope. Like tectonic plates, those opposing forces shoved against each other, building pressure. Something had to give. Let him go, said one voice in her head. Hes gone already. Another voice said: Hang on. Keep the faith. Keep believing. It was like straddling a fault and waiting for an earthquake to hit. On one side of the fault, her dad still lived and was, somehow, fixable. Could be restored to his old life. Could be loved and comforted, at least. On the other side lay a plane where shed never have her dad backat least not the way shed known him. But she couldnt decide which side of the fault to stand on, and she couldnt arrange the outcome, anyway. She could only try to brace herself for the coming cataclysm. I know you must cry in private sometimes, Sean said matter-of-factly. You can cry in front of me too, honey. She let out a puny laugh. You really want me to cry, dont you? You think it would be therapeutic. Yes maam. Would you just shut up and cry, please? Stop fighting it. Im not fighting anything. Youre fighting a normal reaction to all the stress youre under. Youve lost your mom, you want to believe your dad is back, and now youre dealing with your moms indiscretions. Alleged indiscretions, that is. Then theres your trespasser My dad isnt a trespasser, Sean. This is his house. Laura, at some point you might have to face the fact that he really isnt back, cant come back, ever. Suddenly shed decided where she stood. Thats not a fact. Its an opinion. I believe hes alive, and I believe hes not beyond help. Sean had no quick comeback this time. His expression had changed in some subtle way, as if hed tuned her out. Listen, he said abruptly. Thats it. Thats the hole in the night. What are you talking about? When I drove over at three in the morning, I noticed but I didnt understand. Just listen. Then tell me what you hear. A distant siren, miles away. Birds. The wind, rushing through millions of green leaves and brown branches. Laura held her breath. Something was missing. She didnt hear the random music that had always sung along with the wind. Something had stilled her mothers wind chimesor someone had taken them. Only one person on earth would want those wind chimes. Giddy with fear and hope, she turned toward Sean. Hes back. Hes really back. Sean didnt answer, but she saw the doubt in his eyes. He opened his arms and drew her close. They had chosen different sides. Different tectonic plates. She clung to him anyway, while the wind ran around the little house like water around a boulder in a stream.  Sean stood in the living room and studied the rope hed taken down from the little magnolia tree. The rope was thin, brown, discolored by years in the weather. It ended in a fresh cut, delivered by a sharp instrument. The center of the rope was white and clean. Who would have gone into the backyard to cut down Jesss wind chimes? If the house stood in town, close to other homes, a difficult neighbor might fuss about the noise and cut down the chimes out of spite. Out here, though, nearly in the country, with lots of room between houses? Nobody had ever cared. Elliott had given them to Jess one Valentines Day, long before he disappeared. Lauras theory was that Elliott had taken them. Sean wasnt inclined to agree with her, but whoever it was, hed used a very sharp knife. He was probably the same man shed seen at her window. That was the night the new silence had started, but Sean hadnt realized the chimes were gone until tonight. He moved toward the couch, careful not to wake her. Even after their unsettling discovery, exhaustion had caught up with her. At least shed eaten a little. Not much, though. He wished Elliotts old hound dog was still around to eat the leftovers. Geezer was long gone, though. After a couple of weeks of moping for his vanished master, the dog had disappeared too. Fighting off the image of Elliott at the edge of the woods, whistling softly for his dog, Sean crouched beside Laura. He brushed a lock of hair off her cheek. She didnt react. He straightened. He had to talk things over with his brotheron the porch, so his voice wouldnt wake her. But the sensor had already kicked the security lights on, and hed feel like he was on stage. An easy target. At the back door, he hit the switch that killed those too-bright lights. Instantly, it was a normal twilight. He walked onto the porch and around the side where he could see across the road. In the fading light, the azaleas in the tall tin vase looked more purple than pink. From this angle, looking across the hillside, the graveyard was like a little cityscape, the gravestones its skyscrapers and towers. The plots, divided by cement curbs, were city blocks. Even the flowers decorating the graves fit into the scene, looking like flowering shrubs beside the towers. A city of the dead. A city that awaited another new citizen. Someone was going to die. The notion settled on him like a blanket of ice. A premonition, he would have called it, if hed believed in such things. But everyone was going to die, someday. It was only a matter of time. Tonight, though, or tomorrow or next week, it had better not be Laura. He wanted to see her live to play with their grandchildren. Their great-grandchildren too, if they didnt waste too much time. He walked toward the far end of the porch. The side that looked out on mountains instead of graves. He settled into the chair, pulled out his phone, and tried to collect his thoughts. He had to swear Keith to secrecy and bring him up to date. He shouldnt get involved unless he knew the whole story and what a mess it was. Adultery maybe and lies maybe. And maybe thered even been some bloodshed early on, if that car in the lake meant anything. The conversation proved to be even harder than hed anticipated. Keith blasted him. All this is going on, and you havent called the sheriff? Sean, thats flat-out irresponsible. Laura has her reasons for wanting to keep the law out of it. Does she have a better answer than the law? We just want to find Elliott before somebody else does. If hes alive, that is. Stop saying if, okay? Were going to play a little game of Lets Pretend. Pretend hes alive. He doesnt want to be found, obviously. Even if hes close to town, we could search for months and never find a trace of himunless we get into his head. Sean fell silent, trying to drop his skepticism and be a willing believer. Just for a while. Where would Elliott hide? How close to town? Where would he feel at home? At his boyhood home. The old cabin. Out of town, but not too far. It was a falling-down wreck, but Elliott could create a shelter out of nothing. I think the cabin makes sense, Sean said. I do too. Its within walking distance of town. A long walk, but doable. I should stake it out. Soon. You want to come? Ill think about it, Keith said. In the background, there was a sudden crash, followed by the shrill wail of his youngest. Id better go rescue Annie. Ill talk to you later. Sean put his phone away, resigned to doing his stakeout alone. Keith was a family man and a sensible guy who listened to his wife. Annie would tell him he didnt need to run around the countryside chasing a phantom. Night had fallen fast. The mountains loomed black against the dark sky, seeming closer than they really were. If Sean blocked off the lights of the church with his hand, he could imagine himself in the midst of the Southern Nantahala Wilderness, miles from another living soul. Night sounds gathered around him, took him in. Far away, a fox barked. Nearby, spring peepers and a whippoorwill made their racket against the backdrop of a constant wind. A sudden yipping and yelping exploded in the hills. Coyotes. They sounded like a flock of demented birds. They usually saved their eerie ruckus for early morning, but something must have set them off. He was glad Mikey was safe inside. Time to go in, before he started believing in ghosts and haunts. He went in and turned on the outside lights again. They threw the yard and the porch into stark, artificial daylight. He didnt blame Laura for hating them. She lay still, her breathing easy and slow. For a moment he tormented himself with the idea of kissing her as she slept, but the kind of kiss he was imagining wouldnt go unnoticed. Shed wake up and claw his eyes out. He gave her foot a firm squeeze instead. Still no reaction. He was bone tired too. He never turned in so early, but maybe hed at least lie down for a while. But where? Not in Lauras bed; a man just didnt fall into a womans bed without her permission, even if she wasnt in it. And the guest bed was piled high with clothes she planned to donate somewhere. Jesss room? No, he wasnt sleeping in a dead womans bed. He was too spooked already, for a variety of reasons. Once again, his truck would be in the driveway overnight. He didnt care about the old hens and their gossip, but Elliott might be out there somewhere, watching. A classic case of the overprotective father. He might be upset that his baby girl had a man staying in the house. Keep your hands where they belong, Elliott had warned Sean years ago. Some men might not protect their daughters, but Ill always protect my little girl. In the next breath, Elliott had made Sean promise to take care of her. Im trying, man, Sean said quietly. Im trying. He found a sleeping bag in the hall closet and spread it on the floor by the couch. It was better than the night before, when hed slept on nothing but the hooked rug. He felt sorry for himself, a little, until he thought of Elliott in the wild. Sean shook his head. The game of Lets Pretend had already contaminated his mind. He went outside, pausing to look and listen for anything unusual, and retrieved his gun from the rack in the truck. Back inside, he slid the weapon under the couch. He would still obey Lauras no-guns rule if he could, but he wanted to be prepared for anything. Lying on the sleeping bag, he listened to the new silence. Hed never realized how much the chimes had been a part of every storm. A single night-light shone on the wall, casting a faint reflection off the gleaming wood of the grandfather clock as it ticked. Knowing he wouldnt be able to stay awake, he closed his eyes and hoped for a guardian angel or two. Not effeminate Hallmark-style angels, but the real McCoy with flaming swords in their hands and the power of God behind them.          Laura woke to the aroma of fresh coffee. Everything was blurry without glasses or contacts, but she saw a sleeping bag rolled up and sitting on the floor. Seans boots lay cattywampus by the front door. Now the coffee made sense. Long before bedtime, she must have fallen asleep on the couch. Shed slept straight through, and hed camped out on her floor again. The old ladies would have a field day with that. Not that it mattered. Gossip wasnt important anymore, unless someone had a new rumor that held a grain of truth. But the truth was simply that her dad had been lurking around his own house. Cutting down the wind chimes hed given his wife. He wasnt hiding in the mountains. He was somewhere within walking distance. The thought made her pulse quicken with excitement. She sat up, running a hand through her messy hair, and squinted at the white glare of the new lights outside. They ruined the sunrise. Wearing jeans and a black shirt, Sean walked out of the kitchen carrying two identical green mugs, part of a set shed given her mom for Christmas a few years ago. You awake, sweetheart? Just barely. Hed already moved on to sweetheart, and shed answered without even thinking. It was as if theyd time-traveled back to high school. Except everything had changed. He set both mugs on the coffee table, then sat on the floor beside her and leaned against the couch. He picked up his coffee, took a sip, and yawned. Out of his line of vision, she brought one finger close to his hair and imagined playing with it. Or cutting it. Shed have to talk him into a haircut. He needed a shave too. She sat up straighter and wrapped both her hands around her coffee to keep them out of his hair. The security lights assaulted her eyes through the curtains. I hate those new lights. I knew you would, but relax. Theyll go off as soon as theres enough natural light. Or as soon as I hit the switch. I see, he said in a weary voice. I went to all the trouble of installing them just so you can be your usual uncooperative self. Im sorry, Sean. I really do appreciate your efforts to take care of me. Its only what I promised your dad. She stared down at the top of his head. You did what? When we were seventeen, he gave me the keep your hands off my daughter lecture, and then he made me promise to take good care of you. Suddenly she was wide awake. You meanlike he thought he wouldnt be around? No. More like he thought wed marry someday. Which is a fine idea. Sean, stop it. Once shed conquered the lump in her throat, she dared to speak again. You should spend the day in your workshop. If I need you, Ill call. You can be here in three minutes. He was silent for a little while. All right. Im not too worried about what might happen in broad daylight. As long as you keep your doors locked, you can kick me out during the day, but Im staying here again tonight. Like it or not. Ooh, the rumors will fly. People will say youve moved in. I dont care. Im not leaving you here alone at night. He rose, leaving his coffee on the table, and looked down at her. Ill be back. See you later, then. She gave him a little wave, then closed her eyes, deliberately shutting him out. Afraid of what he might say or do next. Later, he echoed. Behave yourself. He crossed the floor, his boots making a heavy tread. His keys jingled. The door shut firmly, and the lock clicked. Still keeping her eyes closed, she listened to the sounds of his departure. Once the sound of the trucks engine had faded into the distance, she opened her eyes. If hed flashed his lights again, shed missed it.  It was Seans favorite time to be in the shop, when the slant of the late sunlight gave the room a dramatic glow. Dale had arrived just in time to spoil it. He was getting cagier. He must have parked around the corner, and when Sean walked to the street for his mail, the old man slipped through the side yard and into the shop. Sean was packed up and itchy to return to Lauras place before nightfall, but Dale never stayed long. Hed been roaming around for five minutes now, examining everything and fingering most of it, but even in his half-tanked state he had the sense not to open the door to the spray room and wood storage. He swayed on his feet as he pointed vaguely toward the window. Isnt your sign a little too, you know, fancy-schmancy? Sean shrugged. When he made the sign, hed taken great pains to keep the style simple, but he should have left off his middle name. Sean Michael Halloran, Luthier, sounded pretentious. The sign didnt even show from the street, though, so it didnt much matter. Its my name and my occupation, Sean said. Thats all. Its a pansy kind of occupation. I know, I know. Thats why youll leave me the pansy gun when you die. Its something to look forward to. Dale slurred an ugly curse. Why, thank you, Sean said, earning himself another one. Dale laughed. Whered you learn to be so polite, boy? I sure didnt teach you that. You sure didnt. As Dale made a slow, unsteady circuit of the shop, he kept glancing back at Sean as if to gauge his mood. Sean knew what was coming next. You got any cash? If you want to sell me the pansy gun, I do. I aint a gun shop. I aint selling. And Im not a bank. Dale rubbed his eyes. They put out any reward money on Gantt? Sean almost laughed at the absurdity. No. And they wont, so forget it. Thats all right. Just findin him will be enough for me. Hes back. I know he is. Once he has the guts to show his face, Ill get even. Get even for what? That call. What call? You know, idiot. The phone call. When you were a kid. The one that saved my life? Dale snarled another curse. Why do you always exaggerate? I dont. And Elliott couldnt have made the call. He was too busy patching me up. Dont try to get revenge for something he didnt do. Dale cracked a smile. I wouldnt hurt him. Id just kick him around a little. Pay him back for stealing my son. It aint right for a man to do that. Gary Bright too. He did the same. They never stole a thing from you, Dale. Sure, they helped me. They both did. You wouldnt believe all the ways Gary has helped me, and he never asks me to pay him back. Pay it forward, he says. You, though? Youre always begging me for cash. And sympathy. Poor, poor Dale, always the innocent victim. Sean ducked just in time. Dales fist hit air and he reeled. Get out. Sean seized him before he could catch his balance and frog-marched him to the door. Get off my property and stay off. Stay off Lauras property too. With one final shove, Sean evicted him, then nipped back inside and drew the deadbolt. Dale howled, probably not in pain but in rage, then stumbled and fell face first on the grass. He lay motionless in the same spot where Sean had assembled the kite so many years ago. About the time Sean was getting worried, Dale picked himself up and limped toward the front yard. Leaning like a tree in a strong wind, he disappeared around the corner of the house hed once owned. So angry he could hardly form a coherent sentence, Sean called 911 to report the DUI in a black pickup truck. Once again, the dispatcher said theyd be on the lookout. After hed hung up, Sean nearly called back to report Dales illegal ownership of a handgun. It wasnt hurting anyone in a closet in Dales cramped apartment, though. It probably hadnt been fired in a generation or more. He was afraid to fire it, afraid to take it out of its case, even afraid to admit that he had it. The last remnant of the Halloran familys wealth, it was his only remaining treasure. Sean moved around the shop, touching his fingertips to the instruments he loved. Dale hadnt harmed anything yet, although there was always the chance that hed set the place on fire some night. Or show up with a sledgehammer and start swinging. The workbenches and the pegboard walls held instruments in all stages of gestation. Some were held together with clamps and vises. Some awaited their final finishes. Some needed nothing more than price tags and new owners. He inhaled the smells of varnish, glue, and wood and savored the satiny sheen of the instruments. The utilitarian beauty of the tools. The clutter of strings and picks and capos. Elliott had introduced him to all of itthe world of musicthe day hed handed him a broom and said, Sweep. I cant pay much, but Ill teach you everything I know. Sean had swept like crazy. He would have swept a path to the moon for Elliott. Or for Laura. Still would. Hed better get over there. She might feel a little too secure with those new locks. There were ways around them, including a simple knock. She wouldnt open the door for just anybody, but she might open it for her dad. Or someone who claimed to be him. Choosing only one mandolin and one guitar that still needed breaking in, Sean tucked them into their cases and locked up. As he backed the truck out of the driveway, he saw the albino raccoon inching his way down the trunk of the big oak. Sean hadnt seen him in a couple of days and was glad the little guy was still around. He rolled down his window. Casper! Get back in that tree. Dont come out until dark. Casper froze, hugging the trunk, but didnt retreat. Good luck to you, then. Sean rolled up his window and hit the gas. He must have gone nuts. He was giving survival advice to a baby raccoon. By the time he reached Lauras house, a healthy sense of victory had crowded out the anger hed felt toward Dale. Sean slowed at the curve, his eyes drawn to the graveyard. All over the cemetery, the wind had toppled real and artificial flowers. Lauras tall tin vase had fallen, spilling pink azaleas across the grave. He hoped she wouldnt notice. He didnt want her in the graveyard at nightfall. Pulling into the driveway, he spotted her on the far side of the porch, facing the mountains at the rear of the house. He decided to use the front door for a change, to see if she was remembering to keep it locked. He carted the instruments and his duffel bag up the front steps. The door was locked. Good girl, he said under his breath, juggling everything while he found his key. Leaving his things in the living room, he walked through the kitchen and out the back door. Laura still leaned against the railing at the far end of the porch. Shed pulled her hair into a neat, schoolteacher-ish bun that wasnt half as sexy as the messy, curly ponytails of her tomboy days. Sexy enough, though. He wanted to sneak up behind her and kiss the nape of her neck, but Elliott had taught her some painfully effective ways to discourage unwanted attention, using nothing but her hands and feet. Reluctantly ending his unobserved survey of her, he shut the door and stepped onto the porch. Im back. Then he felt like an idiot for stating the obvious. No doubt shed heard his truck from a quarter mile away. Looking over her shoulder, she gave him a wary smile. Did you accomplish much today? I did. He wanted to add I kicked Dale out, accompanied by some chest thumping, but it wasnt something to brag about. Did you bring any work with you? Careful not to crowd her too much, he joined her at the railing. A little bit. Some guy from an alarm company stopped by with information. I told him Im not interested. Got it? Yes maam. It was her house. Her life. He couldnt make her decisions for her. A blue jay sailed past, its feathers bright against the dusky sky, and lit in the feathery branches of a pine. Ten feet below the jay, a woodpecker rattled against the furrowed, moss-patched trunk. Two birds on one tree, when they had hundreds to choose from. How many millions of pines were there? How many thousands of tree-covered ridges? When hed gone online to search satellite images of Prospect and the surrounding mountains, it had been daunting to see so much wilderness so close to town. The mountains were full of ruined cabins, hunting shacks, bat-haunted caves. Abandoned gold mines and logging camps too. Then there were the primitive campsites on federal and state land, or a man could create his own little spot. If Elliott could avoid the meth labs and weed operations that plagued public lands now, he could find a new hiding place every night. But what had he been trying to pull, making everybody think he was dead and gone if he was onlygone? Laura shifted her position, placing her elbows on the railing. Resting her chin on her clasped hands, she studied the ground below as if it held something fascinating. Sometimes I wish I could have a do-over for high school andand everything. Startled, he answered without thinking. Id like a do-over for that poorly timed marriage proposal. She shook her head so hard that a bobby pin dropped from her hair, bounced off the railing, and hit the porch. Her bun began to slip from its moorings. It wasnt even a real proposal. You think it was a phony one? It was your kind and honorable attempt to take care of me when we thought my dad had died. But it was unrealistic. Youre right. I had no business talking about marriage. We were just kids. I didnt even have a job because my boss had just disappeared. I didnt have any plans for my future except college, maybe, and having my own workshop someday. She frowned up at him. Im glad you can see how impractical it was. We should have talked about it years ago. The elephant in the room. Bigger than that. A brontosaurus, maybe. Can we start over, then? Friends? Weve never not been friends. You know what I mean, though. Even friends have a hard time communicating when a brontosaurus keeps butting in. You know itll never go away completely, she said. Maybe not, he admitted. But maybe we can shoo it far enough away that we wont keep stepping in brontosaurus, uh, poop. She laughed out loud, her eyes softening as she searched his face. He could practically see her heart softening too, as if talking about the awkwardness had begun to erase it. Slowly, she extended her right hand, apparently expecting him to shake hands. Instead, he captured her hand in his left hand and turned toward the mountains. Taking her cue from him, she faced the mountains too. Standing side by side, holding hands, he felt more connected to her than if hed had both arms around her. She held his hand tightly, like a child. It took him back to the days of skinned knees and scraped chins. The games theyd played on hot summer nights. Green-plum wars, kickball games, watermelon-seed spitting contests. He stole a peek at her just as she stole a peek at him. Dont look at me that way, she whispered. Sorry. Cant help it. Yes, you can. Easy for you to say. Youre not the one looking at you. She smiled, barely, and returned to her study of the high ridges. That brief smile was enough to keep his hopes on life support. The hand holding was a bonus. Anything else would have to wait until Laura was ready.          Six-thirty in the morning and there they were again, having their coffee in the living room like some old married couple. Except shed slept in her room and hed slept on the couchor hed tried to, anyway. It was too short for his long legs. Why didnt you use the guest bed, Sean? I moved the clothes and things off. He drained the rest of his coffee before he answered. I want to be between you and the door. Oh, youre so paranoid. I dont mind if you call me paranoid, as long as I can call you safe. He glanced at the grandfather clock and set his empty cup on the coffee table. Sorry to run off so early, but this is Wednesday. Trash day. I dont want to miss the truck. Go then, and stay as long as you need to. He sat there, staring straight ahead. Maybe he was thinking what she was thinking: if they were an old married couple, he wouldnt walk out the door without a kiss. But she hadnt kissed him since his eighteenth birthday, moments before hed made that goofy, tender, hopelessly ill-timed marriage proposal. The sheriffs dive team had still been dredging the lake. Shed been a wreck. She still was. She was afraid of the baggage she brought with her. Afraid of Seans baggage too. Afraid of Dale and his hatred. If her dad was back, Dale would be cruel to him. No doubt about it. She brought her mug closer. Staring into her coffee, she relived the moment, days ago, when shed dropped the angel mug in the sink and stared into the eyes of the man at the window. Her dador not? Shed never seen him with a beard and long hair. Hed always been clean-shaven, clean-cut, and in good physical condition. But he might be in terrible shape nowphysically, mentally. Hed be no match for Dale. Sean stood up. I should go. Although Id like to stay. Go. Ill be fine. He sat beside her to put on his boots. Then he reached under the couch, pulled out his gun, and laid it across his lap. Please stop hauling that thing around with you, Sean. We said no guns, remember? Thats what we said on Monday. The day youd planned to stay at the Brights house. My exact words were no guns while youre gone. You came back. He stood up, pointing the barrel at the floor. Dont worry, its not loaded. But you could load it in no time. Would you actually start shooting if somebody showed up? Only if that somebody proved to be a threat. And if it was a clear case of self-defense. What if its my dad? And how could you tell the difference between him and a stranger? We dont know what he looks like now. Not really. She got to her feet and backed up, putting some distance between herself and the gun. Get that thing out of here. And dont bring it back. Sean let out a sigh of exasperation. Yes maam. Its your house. He walked toward the door, still keeping the barrel down. Always so safety conscious. But holding that big gun, he looked like a soldier going off to war. Her stomach went queasy. If the unthinkable happened, she wouldnt be able to live with herself. Shed spend the rest of her life knowing that her fear of Dale had robbed her of her chance to love Sean. She couldnt lose him. She couldnt. He had to come back, safe and sound. Come back, she whispered. Sean must have heard. He leaned the gun against the wall, turned around, and started back. She shook her head. I didnt mean It was too late to explain. He was there, reaching for her. He cradled her face in his hands and kissed her like he had when they were teenagers in love, making her heart pound and her common sense fly out the window. She hadnt expected everything to happen so fast, and she hadnt expected it to feel so right. So natural. Their lips fit together like they always had, like theyd been designed for a game of giving and taking pleasure. He pulled away, studying her so somberly that the romantic moment shattered in her sudden recollection of his reasons for being there. His reasons for carrying a gun. Id better go, he said. Call if you need me. And keep your doors locked. I will. Whatever you do, dont forget the most important thing. She held her breath, trying to guess what kind of warning hed give her this time. Whatever he meant to say, he was taking forever to get it out of his mouth. What? she asked, finally. Whats on your mind? Say it. His eyes twinkled. I knew you wanted me to say it again. I love you, Laura. Oh, no. She wasnt ready for that. I know you do, she said gently. Because weve been friends since we were little kids. Dont play like that, sweetheart. You know what I mean. I love you love you. He curved his hand around her cheek and gave her one more kiss, then took the gun and walked outside, into the artificial light. He locked the door behind him. With her knees about to buckle, she collapsed on the couch and dragged the quilt up to her chin. She tried to organize her chaotic thoughts into neat little categories, but everything was interconnected. Sean. Dad and Mom. Gibby. Dales vicious grip on her arm. Bluegrass and kisses, wind chimes and guns. Over it all hung the fear that if her dad came home, something would go terribly wrong.  Sean parked in his driveway and sat there for a minute, trying to understand why he didnt feel more victorious. He should have been celebrating Lauras wholehearted participation in those kisses, but some unnamed worry kept getting in the way. He couldnt pin it down. Whatever it was, it had been bothering him ever since hed left her. His vague uneasiness might define itself as he whipped through part of his routine. He needed to put the trash out. Shower and shave. Then hed spend some time in the shop, doing the bare minimum and picking up something to work on. He needed to proofread that brochure, too, and get it to the printer. Laura wanted him to stay away all day, working. Maybe she was right, but he hardly cared if his competitors sewed up all the orders this year. There would be other years, other festivals. Operating in a blurry fog of stress and exhaustion, he climbed out of the truck. He grabbed his trash can from its spot at the side of the house and rolled it out to the curb. Even if the world was falling apart, he couldnt miss trash day. Sean looked up and down the block. He half expected to see a lean figure lurking in the early morning shadows, but friendly, overweight Wally Morse came around the corner with his yellow Lab tugging him along. Glad to see something so normal and right, Sean lifted his hand in greeting. Wally waved back while the dog paused to sniff the fake flowers at the base of Mrs. Gibsons mailbox post. Theyd blown over again. It happened with every storm. Like the flowers in the cemetery Sean stiffened. That was what had been bothering him. Those pink azaleas. He couldnt process it, couldnt find a rational explanation, but he knew what hed seen. It might have been nothing, or it might have been the answer to Lauras prayers, but he couldnt share it with her yet. Maybe hed never be able to tell her. He wanted to drive hell-bent for leather back to her place, but he made himself lock up the truck, leaving the gun on the rack. Then he proceeded to the front door. He fumbled the key in the lock, walked in, and shut the door behind him. He stood there staring at the cedar chest, but in his minds eye, he saw only pink azaleas.  All day, Lauras thoughts had kept straying back to the interesting developments at dawn. Sean had not only kissed her but also told her he loved her. Next thing she knew, hed be talking about marriage againand shed worry about genetics again. When theyd studied genetics in Prestons biology class, shed wondered what the combination of Halloran and Gantt genes would produce. Their future children, should they have any, might be calm and kind and normal, like her mother. Like Sean and Keith. Or they might be walking disasters, cursed with a blend of her dads volatility and Dales drunken cruelty. But any marriage was a gamble. Having children was a gamble. Life itself was a series of gambles. She blew out a long sigh and told herself to get to work. Earlier, sorting through a pile of papers in the kitchen, shed found a dozen unopened sympathy cards that Ardelle must have set aside for her. Laura gathered a box of thank-you notes, a pen, and stamps and took them to the backyard where a garden bench sat in the sun not far from the spot where the wind chimes had hung. She was surrounded by reminders of her parents. Trees theyd planted together. The old metal garden markers poking up among their prized perennials. Their birdhouses and bird feeders. Even the garden bench where she sat. Her dad had built it, and her mom had painted it a soft green that blended in with the bushes. The first envelope came from one of the elderly, unmarried Flynn cousins in North Carolina. Laura pulled out the card, its artwork a flowery swirl of pale pastels like an old womans scarf. Inside, Annabel Flynns shaky writing expressed regret that she hadnt been able to attend the funeral for dear cousin Jessamyn. The printed verse was soberly biblical in nature. Laura wrote a thank-you note and moved on to the next envelope. A heavy, high-quality envelope in a soft shade of gray, it bore no return address, but the sender had written Lauras name and her mothers address in bold, masculine penmanship that matched that of the naughty note shed found. She checked the back of the envelope. No return address there either. She ripped the envelope open and pulled out a card. The same color as the envelope, its front was blank. Slowly, she opened it.  Laura, I was so sorry to hear of your mothers passing. She was a lovely woman. Ill never forget her. God bless. Gibby  It was true, then. Her mother wouldnt have saved that naughty note unless it had meant something to her. Theyd had more than a brief flirtation in a moment of weakness. Tempted to call Sean, Laura shook her head. He would be back soon. She would have plenty of time to tell him later. She wrote Gibby a short, kind reply. With every word, she reminded herself that shed chosen to forgive him and her mother. With every word, she thought she felt her fathers heartache. It was all too much, coming on the same day she and Sean had so suddenly resurrected their old relationship. She closed her eyes, listening to the wind in the trees and remembering the chimes that used to sing in every storm. To her father, their soft tinkling might have become as unpleasant as clanging cymbals. She hated to argue with St. Paul, but love sometimes failed.          Sean had come back earlier than Laura had expected, but as shed expected, hed greeted her with another round of lingering kisses. As much as she relished revisiting their teenage romance on a deeper level, sometimes panic threatened. Everything was happening too fast, adding to the tension that accompanied the mystery of her fathers fate. Something was bothering Sean too, but he refused to talk about it. Sitting on the couch, he was frowning over the printers proof of his brochure. He hadnt bothered to shave when he made his quick jaunt back to his house, so he looked more like a wild man than ever. Are you happy with the brochure? she asked. He gave her a blank look. Excuse me? Your brochure. That piece of paper youve been brooding over for ten minutes. Whats wrong with you, Sean? Nothing. It looks great. She raised her eyebrows. Youd better get the order going before its too late, then. Just because its a quick-print place doesnt mean you can procrastinate until the last minute. Yes maam. But instead of picking up his phone, he picked up a mandolin hed brought with him to break in. Leaving him inside, Laura moved to the porch with a few more notes to write. She hadnt yet told Sean about the card from Gibby. She settled into one of the Adirondack chairs her dad had made and opened a sympathy card from one of her fellow teachers in Denver. As she wrote a brief thank-you, she tried to imagine explaining her dads situation to her friends there. She wouldnt even know where to start. Inside, Sean played a few notes, stopped to work on the tuning, and played a few more. Again and again, he started a song, interrupted it, and went back to it. Or started a different tune. Sometimes hed nearly reach the end of a song, but hed stop abruptly before the last line, leaving the song hanging. Unresolved. Sean, cant you at least finish a song once in a while? she called. The music stopped. The door creaked open. He stuck his head out. Excuse me? I cant stand it when you never finish a song. Sorry. Im not thinking about the songs. Im thinking about the tuning. The sound. The weariness around his eyes made her wonder when hed last had a good nights sleep. She smiled, softening. Im sorry, Sean. I was just being difficult. Go on; get back to it. Instead, he joined her on the porch and studied the dogwood tree that stretched a branch over the porch. Hands in his pockets, the wind ruffling his hair, he kept quiet. Leaving her correspondence on the chair, she stood in front of him. She reached up to push his hair off his forehead, revealing the small scars from the time Dale shoved him through a window on a summer night. Dale wouldnt let him see a doctor, so Sean had cleaned the cuts, sprayed them with Bactine, and applied a butterfly bandage to the worst one. By the time school started in the fall, the cuts had healed. But he would always have the scars. Hands still in his pockets, he gave her a quizzical frown. Yeah, I know. I need a haircut. But thats not what I want to tell you. She stretched upward to give him a quick kiss. Gibby sent a sympathy card. That was nice of him. The writing matches the note I found in my moms drawer. Sean sighed. Im sorry that your mom and Gibby had a fling, Laura. I really am. Me too. Especially for my dads sake. Sean took his hands from his pockets and reached out to tug a dogwood leaf from its branch. You know what your dad told me once about dogwood leaves? He ripped the leaf, gently, so it was still held together by tiny threads. See those? He told me theyre like strands of memory and fact that hold past and present together. Theyll hold for a little while, but not forever. Whats that supposed to mean? Facts dont change, but sometimes memories do. He tugged the two halves of the leaf completely apart, breaking the delicate filaments. Even if we uncover some unfortunate facts, some ugly truths, hang on to your good memories. You mean you dont want me to forget all the good I ever knew of my mom, even if she cheated on my dad? He dropped the two halves of the leaf over the railing and watched them fall to the grass. I was thinking of your dad too. He might have changed, but we need to remember the man he was. Honor the man he was. You sound almost like youre ready to admit he might be alive. Im starting to believe its possible. But be prepared for the worst. If he comes back, he might be in rough shape. You think I dont know that? Swallowing the urge to cry, Laura turned her back on Seanand faced the cemetery and another dogwood tree growing green and healthy near the family plot. Every time she saw a dogwood now, she would remember the leaf Sean had ripped in half. The way the past pulled away from the present, one filament at a time. One hour at a time. Hes bound to needsome help, she said, keeping her voice on track, no wavering or wobbling allowed. Then well get him some help. Imagine what it might be like to bring him home. To cook him a good meal. To let him sleep in his own bed and wear clean clothes. Lord willing, thats going to happen, Sean said. But we just dont know. Laura went to sit on the steps. He had the heart of a poet. Hes the sentimental one, not Mom. She stopped, realizing shed mixed present tense and past tense. He was the one who always cut fresh flowers for his parents and grandparents graves, and for Moms side of the family too. Sean sat beside her. He did that? On Mothers Day, Fathers Day, Easter, and Memorial Day. Dont you remember? Come to think of it, yeah. And its almost Memorial Day. Those are all spring and summer holidays, though. When I was little, I always felt sorry for dead people because they didnt get fresh flowers all through the winter, and thats when I thought they would need them the most. To cheer them up. Her dad had laughed softly when shed shared that little-girl worry with him. He assured her it wasnt the dead people they needed to worry about. No, its the living who need flowers on their loved ones graves. Why, Daddy? To make us stop and remember who they were and why we loved them. That was all hed said, and she hadnt pressed him for more. By kindergarten, shed learned not to trigger his moods by asking too many questions. He even knew the language of flowers, she said. You know, that silly Victorian thing. Grandma Gantt taught him when he was a boy. Irises for good news. Daisies for innocence. Pansies for loving thoughts. Sean smirked. Pansies for loving thoughts. I like that. My inheritance from Dale will help me think loving thoughts of him when he finally kicks the bucket. What are you talking about? The pansy gun. He says hell leave it to me when he dies. Ive never seen it. Does it have pansies engraved on it or something? No, he calls it the pansy gun because its a womans gun, designed for a small hand. He measured with his fingers to show a gun no more than four inches long. I havent laid eyes on it in years. It belonged to his grandmother, and its the only gun he has left. Hes a convicted felon so he cant buy another one except on the black market. He shouldnt even have the pansy gun. Why dont you report him? I dont have the heart to. Hed wind up behind bars again. Besides that, I would feel like I was taking away his last shred of dignity. You could at least blackmail him into handing it over now instead of making you wait for him to die. Sean smiled faintly. I could give it a try. The wind was gathering strength, but it had no chimes to play on. A trains whistle blew in the distance, tone-on-tone, like two or three ribbons of sound that crossed each other and separated again. If her dad was out there, not too far away, he heard the same train at the same moment. With every breath she took, he took one. With every beat of her heart, his heart beat. And the moments went by. Days went by. Life went by. Almost twelve years had passed. Had he thought she wouldnt miss him? Sean reached over and laid his hand over hers. She stretched her arm alongside his, matching their pulse points, wrist to wrist. Theyd done that as kids, one cold night when their arms were covered with goose bumps. Ghost bumps, shed thought they were called, but shed been careful not to let herself believe in ghosts. Her dad had told her ghosts werent real. Now hed become almost a ghost himself, in a sense. A phantom. Why did my dad have to run? she asked. Wouldnt divorce have made more sense than abandoning us? Are you still afraid he stopped loving you? I know parents sometimes abandon their children, Sean. It happens. But most parents wouldnt try to fool their children into believing theyd died. Maybe he thought that was the kindest way to handle it. Because of the affair, you mean? Or because of his issues? A combination, maybe. Or he sensed that Mom didnt love him anymoreand that I was just so tired of his moods that II might have been glad if he disappeared. Oh, I hope he didnt think that. Even though, on some particularly difficult days, it might have been true. Sean squeezed her hand, then lifted his head to study the sky. I wonder if itll storm tonight. Her throat hurt from trying not to cry. She took a deep breath, harnessing her emotions. No, itll blow over. Thats what the weatherman says, anyway. You can take a storm and make music out of it, her dad had said with a smile on that long-gone Valentines Day when he hung the miniature chimes from the star magnolia. A storm had been rolling over the shoulder of the mountains that day. Im going to stake out the cemetery tonight, Sean said. Because I told you my dad used to put flowers on the family plot? But that was so long ago. And he wouldnt do it anymore if he doesnt want people to know hes hanging around. If he doesnt want people to know hes around, seems like hed stop hanging aroundif thats really him. Maybe hes conflicted, she said. He halfway wants to be caught. Or maybe he has problems beyond PTSD by now, especially after living in the wild for years. He could even have Alzheimers. Sean only drummed his fingers on the step beside him. She stilled his restless movement with a firm grip. Whats wrong? Youre so edgy, youre practically vibrating. Are you sure you dont want to stay at my place tonight? Im sure. Especially if youll be right across the road. If he shows upits just my dad, Sean. Your dad, the guy who flipped out on a regular basis. The guy who caught us snuggling on the porch swing and busted it up with a sledgehammer. The guy who The daddy who sang lullabies to me even when I was too old for lullabies, just because I loved to hear him sing. The animal lover who fed a tiny starving kitten from a medicine dropper. He had the kindest, softest heart. He would never hurt me. She took a quick breath. You just told me to keep remembering the good about him. Stop contradicting yourself. Youre as conflicted as he must be. And I am too. After a long silence, Sean nodded. Okay. You stay here tonight. Ill have my phone. You can call me if you hear or see anything out of the ordinary. Call even if youre scared and you dont know why. No, you call me if youre scared, she said, trying to lighten the moment. Sean didnt even smile. A gust of wind scattered her thank-you notes that were stamped and ready to go in the mail. She jumped up and chased them down. Its too windy, she said, gathering the rest of her things. Im going in. Me too. But he couldnt seem to keep his eyes off the churchyard.  The night was dry but chilly, the wind wrestling with the trees. He would be half-frozen by morning. Sean turned his cell phone to vibrate and returned it to his pocket. Armed with a flashlight and a thermos of strong coffee but no gun, he headed for the graveyard. Unless someone was watching from the woods or the kudzu jungle, nobody knew he was there. Nobody but Laura. Directly across from the house, he stood in the shadows and took in the view from the graveyard. The interior lights were out, but the security lights illuminated the yard and the porch. Laura would still be awake, listening to every sound. Hed scouted the lay of the land before nightfall, and hed found the most logical place for a person to hide and spy on Laura. Then hed found a place for himself, a place where he could watch for a watchera wooden bench, deep in the corner of the graveyard, behind an especially large gravestone. He could see the Gantt family plot, its cement curb barely visible by moonlight. From this vantage point, he could see a portion of the road too. If he kept scanning, back and forth, he wouldnt miss a thingunless someone crept up behind him. He sat on the bench and settled in for a long wait, his eyes adjusting to the darkness. On his side of the road, the brightest thing around was the steeple, its white paint lit from below, like a beacon trying to point people toward heaven. Not counting the time hed hid out in the vestibule to spirit Laura away from the old ladies, the last time hed been inside that church was for Jesss funeral. Hed slipped into the service a few minutes late. Standing in the rear, hed found the back of Lauras head, in the front row. A lamp had hung on the wall in front of her, perfectly centered, its light making a nimbus of rays around her gold-red hair while her slightest movement had made the lamps finial seem to bob like a golden tongue above her head. Like Pentecost and those tongues of fire, hed thought, remembering her Pentecostal grandparents, the Flynns. They were buried right there in the same graveyard. A gust of wind blew down the hill, chilling him. North Georgia could be plenty cold, even in late May. The night would be a long one. His eyelids were already drooping. Hed never thought he could be sleepy in a graveyard at midnight. To keep himself awake, he tried to imagine how many lives were represented by gravestones in this one little plot of ground. Each grave held the remains of somebody whose day-to-day doings had added up to a life. Kindergarten, grade school, high school. Cars and cats and ball games. College, jobs, weddings. Kids and grandkids and old-folks homes, and finally the graveyard with all its crosses that preached silent sermons about the life to come. Sean preferred that to Jesss notion that people died and then came back around again in some new form. He would rather live just one life that mattered. One life that ended with his hopes fixed on the resurrection of the dead. He unscrewed the lid of his thermos and fortified himself with hot, sweet coffee. He couldnt doze off on his watch. When Keith had called back, hed said Dale had stopped him downtown to rant. He was sure Elliott was the rat whod made that phone call years ago. Dale intended to find him, somehow. So Dale was roaming around, seeking his prey. Elliott was prowling around too, doing God knows what. When Mrs. Gibsons fallen silk flowers had jogged Seans memory in the early morning light, he knew who Lauras prowler was. He couldnt tell her, though. If he was wrong, it would break her heart. Last night at dusk, her tall vase full of pink azaleas had toppled in the wind, like the other tall and top-heavy flowers all over the cemetery. But this morning when hed stepped onto the porch at first light, Jesss flowers stood straight and tall again. Someone had righted them between dusk and dawn. Someone who cared about Jesss flowers and hers alone.          After a long night of fitful sleep, Laura rose before dawn and dressed. Two minutes into her morning, she could tell it was going to be one of those days. Her favorite shirt had lost a button. She put on a lightweight sweater instead, and it had a snag in it. Shed run out of hand lotion. And when she went to make the coffee, the grinder finally died for good. She threw it in the trash and headed into her moms room to take some lotion from her bureau. Laura shook her head at the clutter there. She needed to deal with it soon. Reaching for a tube of hand cream, she realized the tiny bottle of Jean Nat cologne was missing. Sheor Mikeymust have knocked it to the floor. If it wasnt tightly capped, it could leak and ruin the hardwood. On her knees, she felt under the bed. Her fingers bumped into something but she couldnt get a grip on it. Flat on the floor, she peered under the bed. The Jean Nat wasnt there, but she pulled out a hardcover book with an illustration of pink columbines on the cover and a lavender grosgrain ribbon peeking out to serve as a bookmark. Breathing fast, Laura sat on the bed. She opened to the first page and read the date. This was the final journal, starting near the end of March. It was the only one Ardelle hadnt found. Her mom had always picked up her pen at first light. The UPS driver had found her on the porch at ten in the morning, so shed probably written her final entry only a few hours before her death. Laura started at the beginning. Like the journals shed found earlier, it was daily trivia. Nothing about possible sightings of a supposedly dead husband. Shed recorded her dreams, though, as shed begun to do a few years before, and shed tried to analyze them. Shed used different colors of ink, perhaps for different moodslight blue, lavender, green, bright red. Twenty pages in, Laura reached the last entry, written in ordinary blue ink. It closed with Rain, rain, and more rain, but April showers will work wonders for my May flowers. It wasnt an especially significant sentence to close out a lifetime of journaling, but she lingered on it. Jessamyn Gantts last word: flowers. And that was the end of her thousands of journal entries. The end of her lifeon earth, at least. Laura ran a finger across the blank page that faced the last entry. She didnt want to think about what might have come next for a woman whod been raised on Holy Ghost revivals and altar calls and the blood of Jesus but had drifted into vague beliefs about being at one with the Supreme Being and the universe. According to her moms new, enlightened views, there was no such thing as sin. Just failings. With a sigh, Laura took the journal into the living room and compared it to a cheap spiral notebook from the early years. Her mom had used plain blue or black ink then, and she hadnt analyzed her dreams. Her penmanship had changed gradually over the years, but her love of flowers had never altered. In the early volume, Laura studied yet another line about gardening: Sometimes, a beautiful new plant springs up from the rot, from the dirt. A few short words followed, but theyd been scratched out, black ink over blue. Laura couldnt quite make them out. She turned on a bright lamp and looked again. The last word was probably me, but she couldnt be sure. Footsteps sounded on the porch. Sean, back from his night in the cemetery. Laura, he called. Its me. Coming. She ran into the kitchen as he unlocked the back door and walked in, unshaven and bleary-eyed. Mornin, Red. Good morning. You look exhausted. Im all right. He seemed to be gauging her mood as he closed the door. Did you see anything? Hear anything? Nothing but birds and bugs. Anything happen here? Nothing but wind, all night long. Where did you hide out? On a bench, behind a big ol tombstone. Nothing happened, nobody came. I guess thats good news. I guess, she echoed, studying him. He acted too casual. Too relaxed. Yet she picked up new worries in the undercurrents of his voice, in the faraway look in his eye. But it became a hungry look when he crooked a finger at her. No, she said. Absolutely not. Not until youve brushed your teeth. He smiled. Did you brush yours? Yes. Sean ambled down the hall to the bathroom. She heard the sound of running water, the toilet flushing, running water again. He came back, not looking any more civilized but smelling like peppermint toothpaste. Better? he asked, pulling her close. Better, she said, and for a couple of minutes, she could nearly forget why he was there. Why hed sat in a cemetery all night. He pulled back and studied her. That was a long, cold night. Im glad to be in a warm house with bright lightsand you. He released her, walked over to the counter and pulled one of the lemon-poppy-seed muffins out of the bag. Something tells me you didnt get a lot of sleep, either. Yeah, well, I have a few things on my mind. No kidding. He pulled off a piece of the muffin and sat at the table. It was the same place where hed sat on the day her dad had brought him home, so bruised from that last beating that he could hardly move. Sean had put on a show of being fine. Just fine. A little hungry, maybe. But when her dad ruffled his hair and called him son, she knew Sean had gone to a new level of hero-worship. He hadnt seen her dad as a wigged-out Vietnam vet. Sean had simply loved him. He pinched a piece of muffin between forefinger and thumb and frowned at it. Stale muffins arent worth eating. Got coffee? Sorry. No coffee. The grinder broke for good, and theres nothing in the house but whole beans. That settles it. He stood up. Were going out for breakfast. No. I dont want to. Never argue with a man whos been awake all night in a graveyard. He opened the fridge and pulled out a Coke. Coke? For breakfast? I need some caffeine for the road. The old diner opens early. Lets go there. Not that new froufrou place. I want real food. But I want to be home in case he comes back this morning. It wont take long to grab a bite to eat. He hasnt shown up in broad daylight yet, has he? Are you actually admitting that he shows up sometimes in the night? Lounging against the counter, Sean studied her for a long moment before he answered. Im not admitting anything, darlin. He was weakening, though. Hed practically acknowledged that her dad was back. A thrill ran through her, nearly distracting her from the fact that Sean had progressed to calling her darlin.  The residents of Prospect were gearing up for their biggest event of the year, and in spite of the early hour, the party atmosphere was in full swing. It did nothing to calm Lauras nerves. The main stage had been erected in the town square, and several smaller stages stood at a distance. Bright banners flapped from streetlight poles, and US flags flew everywhere in honor of Memorial Day. Posters adorned the windows of every business, including the diner. As Sean held the diners door open for her, Laura glanced at the newspaper rack beside it. The headline of the weekly paper, printed every Wednesday, read Bluegrass festivities start Friday. The lead article featured a photo of Gibby, dressed in black as always but his hair a handsome silver now. Sean paid no attention to the paper. Coke can in hand, he nudged her right past the Please wait to be seated sign toward an empty booth by the window, set with napkin-wrapped silverware and two white coffee mugs, upside down. He settled down across from her and drained his Coke can. A teenage waitress scurried up to the table with laminated menus in one hand and a coffeepot in the other. Sean turned both mugs right side up. Unshaven and weary, he looked like a wild man whod just crawled out of a cave. Please, he said before the waitress could speak. Good morning, she chirped as she filled Lauras mug. How are yall? Fine and dandy, thanks, Sean said. How are you? Fine. She poured his coffee. Its gonna be a beautiful day. Yep. He pulled the sugar packets toward him and doctored his coffee. You want the special, honey? he asked Laura. The big breakfast? Yeah, you do. You need to eat. Two specials, please. Laura decided not to argue this time. It wasnt important. The waitress set the coffeepot on the table and whipped out her pad. Laura answered the questions without much thought. Over medium, whole wheat, hash browns, bacon, whatever. She would eat maybe ten percent of it. Same, please, Sean said. Except grits. He slid the empty Coke can across the table. And throw this away for me? The waitress nodded, scribbling. He raised his coffee mug to his lips. Leaving it there, he closed his eyes. Anything else I can get yall? the girl asked. That should do it, thanks, Laura said, since Sean seemed to have gone into a trance. Ill get that right up. The waitress retrieved the coffeepot and walked away. An older waitress walked past, the aroma of bacon and pancakes competing with her too-strong cologne. Laura sat up straighter, remembering. Sean, I forgot to tell you about the Jean Nat. My moms cologne. This morning I noticed its missing from her bedroom. He opened his eyes. Who could have been in the house after I changed the locks? I think it was Ardelle, days ago. Before you changed the locks. She popped in at least once that I know of, when I wasnt home. She got defensive when Cassie brought it up, remember? Ardelle said she wasnt a thief. Maybe she was defensive because she is a thief. Cologne hardly seems worth stealing. She probably threw it out. Thought she was helping you de-clutter. Why would she stop with only one item, then? I hate to worry Gary with it, but I should talk to Cassie, at least. She can help me figure it out. Before you call her, take another look, Sean said. In case you missed it. Good idea. Silence fell between them, making Laura aware of the background music. Instead of the usual soft rock, it was bluegrass in honor of the festival. Their food, when it came, was tasteless. Laura played with it, picked at it, pushed it around her plate. Youve got to eat, sweetheart, Sean said. Even if you dont feel like it. Dont worry about me. Ill be all right. He lowered his fork and searched her face. Thats exactly what your dad always said when your mom was trying to keep him from flipping out. Or hed give her that little wink. Remember? Laura nodded, fighting tears in earnest. Trying to evade Seans gaze, she looked across the crowded restaurant. Nearly filled to capacity, the room rang with laughter and chatter. She wondered if any of the conversations included her fathers name. The sheriff and a young but balding deputy had walked in, conspicuous in their khaki uniforms with their shiny badges and black holsters. The sheriff had aged since Laura had seen him last. His slicked-back hair was touched with gray now, but hed kept his trim build. Law-abiding public servants, the men stopped beside the wait to be seated sign. The hostess greeted them. Like a mama duck with two ducklings in tow, she led the men toward a table near Sean and Lauras booth. Watching them approach, Laura decided the timing was a godsend. If her dad chose this weekend to come back, perhaps drawn by the music, the sheriffs department should be on the lookout. Even though they didnt believe the rumors, they might need a reminder that if he turned up, he might be in bad shape. In need of help and protection. She glanced at Sean. He was studying her, his expression weary yet alert. What are you thinking? he asked quietly. I should have a word with the sheriff. Last I heard, you didnt want him to get involved. She didnt have time to explain. The men had arrived at their table, exchanging friendly banter with the hostess as they took their seats. She walked away, and the sheriff looked directly at Laura. Good morning, Miss Gantt. Sean. They echoed his greeting, and then Laura addressed the sheriff. Id like to ask you a question or two, she said. Sure, the sheriff said with a fatherly smile. Whats on your mind? She leaned toward him, not wanting to speak more loudly than necessary. I understand youre skeptical of the rumors about my dad. The sheriffs smile faded. Im sorry, but I havent seen any evidence to back them up. We need to talk, then. I might have some evidence. If you have facts, maam, Im interested. If its just more speculationwell, Im up to my eyebrows in speculation. Its more than speculation. He sighed. If youd like to come by my office sometime, we can talk. How about now? As soon as weve all finished eating? He shook his head. Im sorry, but Ive got my hands full with the festival. Lauras temper began to stir. A few minutes after breakfast is too time consuming? When I get this weekend behind me, Ill have a lot less on my mind. But its a three-day weekend. He gave her a puzzled look. And? I dont want to wait until Tuesday. Tuesday might be too late. Miss Gantt, how long ago did your dad disappear? Ten or twelve years ago? After all that time, I dont believe a few more days will make much difference. What if it were your father out there? she asked fiercely, not caring anymore who heard her. Honey, I dont believe its your father either. Feel free to stop by the office on Tuesday morning, though. About nine would work for me. His condescending tone nearly provoked her into a caustic reply, but Seans boot came down on her shoe, gentle but firm. A secret signal. She looked at him, his disheveled hair hanging across his forehead, hiding those scars. One side of his mouth gave in to that sarcastic little upward tilt. His eyes shone like blue jewels. After all the times shed worried that he would overreact, now he was reminding her to keep her cool. She winked, just enough for him to see it. Dont worry about me. Ill be all right. He winked back. All right, she told the sheriff. Tuesday morning at nine, Ill be in your office. See you then. He moved his attention to the waitress approaching his table, and the conversation was over. So much for that, Laura said under her breath. I love you, Laura Gantt, Sean said, loud and clear. Right in front of everybody. He pulled out his wallet, extracted some money, and dropped the bills on the table. Youre not arguing, he said with a smile. Thats progress. I can never talk any sense into your head anyway. She slid out of the booth. Sean got up too and draped his arm around her shoulders. They went outside, into bright sunshine and a brisk wind that made the bluegrass banners tug hard against their tethers. Hammer strokes bounced off the planks of a temporary stage and reverberated across the square. A trash truck backed up, beeping. The air rang with the slap and thud of lumber being unloaded by the stage. The vendors booths were up, and the vendors themselves would appear soon to hawk their wares. Food and drink, CDs, songbooks, instruments. And Sean would be there bright and early on Saturday morning if she had to hogtie him and drag him there. Unless her dad came back, and then nothing else would matter. You okay? Sean asked. Not too mad at the sheriff? Its just frustrating. And all thisshe motioned toward a flurry of activity near the main stage. It makes me imagine my dad showing up in broad daylight. Walking right down the street. If he does, some kind soul will recognize him and help him track you down. What if hes back to track Gibby down? And what if Dales right in the middle of it too? Stop imagining the worst possible scenarios, Laura. Youll live longer. She shook her head, weary of arguing with him. You have any plans for tonight? he asked as they approached his truck. Not really. You? Please understand why Im not inviting you to tag along, but Id like to camp out at the cabin tonight. To see if anybody turns up. She felt a chill. You mean my dad? Dale, more likely. She realized shed unconsciously placed her left hand over the fading bruise on her right elbow although her sleeve hid it. Why tonight, though? she asked. Has something changed? Tomorrow night, Id like to get some sleep so Ill be in decent shape to man my booth on Saturday. Tonights my last chance to stake out the cabin before the weekend. She stopped walking and faced him. Hold it right there. I dont like the way you put that. A stakeout is for cops, looking for bad guys. My dads one of the good guys. One of the best, Sean said. Absolutely. No guns. Understand? He shot her a look of pure irritation. No guns. But youre not staying alone at the house. Stay at my place. Sean, its not necessary. Ill be fine. Would it hurt, though? She took a moment to consider her options. I guess it wouldnt hurt, she said, carefully noncommittal. Heres a key to my front door. He placed it in her hand. Thanks, Sean. Afraid he would read her mind if she looked him in the eye, she hurried to climb into his truck.          Outside, chain saws buzzed like hornets as Cassie walked toward the kitchen to rustle up some breakfast. Her dad had hired a crew to take down some sickly pines before they died and fell on the house. The men had been hard at work since eight in the morning. That was only five, California time. She was not in an especially good mood. Hearing voicesor at least one voiceshe peeked around the corner. Her mom stood at the counter beside the sink, dumping a handful of sliced potatoes into her slow cooker. She seemed to be moving in slow motion, and she was talking to herself. Cassie crept closer, her bare feet noiseless on the smooth ceramic tiles, and listened. I cant do anything right, her mom said. Cant measure up. She lifted one hand to her face as if to wipe away tears. I cant even spell, she added in a stronger voice. Whoa, Cassie mouthed silently. She backed up a few steps and moved to one side for a better view. I cant be anybody else. I cant be anybody but me. Her mom picked up a potato and the peeler. Cassies phone rang in her pocket. Her mom whirled to face her. Darn, I wanted to talk to you and now somebodys calling me. Cassie pulled out her phone and decided not to mention it was Laura. Who is it? Her mom set down the peeler and the potato. She wiped her wet hands on her black sweatpants, the potato starch making pale smudges on the fabric. Its, um, an old friend of mine. Cassie made a hasty exit through the sunroom to the pool deck and took a deep breath of fresh air filled with the sweet scent of the butchered pines. The chain saws were annoyingly loud, but theyd be a good cover for the phone call. She opened the phone. Hey, Laura. Hey, Cass. Hows your mom doing? Pretty much the same, Cassie said softly. Whats new with you? WellI need to tell you what your mom has been up to lately. Or at least I think shes the one whos responsible. Oh boy. What did she do now? Cassie sat in one of the poolside chairs and waited for the bad news. It wasnt necessarily your mom who did this, but somebody went into my moms room and took a little bottle of Jean Nat. Her favorite fragrance. Youre sure its missing? Yes. I looked and looked, but its really gone. What does it smell like? Sort of fruity. Lemony. Spicy. Ill see what I can find out and let you know. Hey, Im going to try to talk her into hitting the festival tomorrow. Will you be there? Probably not. The live music wont start until tomorrow night, and Sean wont open his booth until Saturday morning. Thats where Ill be, if only to make sure hes there instead of here. Okey-doke. Ill look for you at his booth on Saturday. See ya. Cassie returned to the kitchen. Now her mom was chopping onions. Mom, you want to hit the music shindig sometime? We can check out the bands. Eat a funnel cake or two. Mm-hmm, her mom said in a vague tone. Moving closer, Cassie inhaled deeply. She didnt smell anything lemony or fruity. Just onions, and they made her eyes water. Wow, those are strong onions. Mm-hmm. Thats nice, honey. Cassie blinked hard and fast. Now she was crying real tears, not onion tears. She couldnt deny it any longer. Something was wrong with her mother.  Sean climbed out of his truck at the QuikTrip, swiped his card, and started pumping gas. He should have showered and shaved first, to wake up his weary brain, but it would have made as much sense as a shower and a shave before a hunting trip. Bad analogy. Elliott wasnt prey. Just down the street, one of the banners for the festival snapped in the wind, its bold blue-and-green design the same one the town had used for years. It was finally getting some recognition. By tomorrow night, the town would be packed with musicians and fans. Rowdy drunks and noisy bikers. Affluent tourists and penny-pinching locals. The crowds were bigger every year, threatening to make it one of the biggest music events in the Southeast. Of all the crazy times for Elliott to come back. Sean was starting to hate that wordcrazybut as much as he wanted to believe Elliott would never hurt anybody, there was no telling what frame of mind hed be in. Or what he might be charged with someday. Sean rubbed the tight muscles in the back of his neck. He was glad Laura had agreed to spend the night at his house. She wasnt happy about it, obviously, but she hadnt argued much. He bought a bag of ice and poured it over a six-pack of Coke in his cooler. Between him and Keith, they would have Coke, coffee, flashlights, plenty of bug spray, and at least one snake-bite kit. No guns. Hed given his word. He put the lid on the cooler and checked the sky. Hed make it to the cabin before dark, and Keith would show up as soon as he got off work. Sean was still amazed that Annie had put her stamp of approval on the expedition. Before he could get away, a white car pulled up next to him. Doc Marsh rolled down the window, his kind face burdened with worry. How goes it, Sean? Oh, its interesting. It sure is. Doc kneaded his steering wheel with his pink hands. Half an hour ago, I saw Dales truck at the Gantts old cabin outside of town. I thought I should let you know. Great, maybe itll be a family reunion. Sean didnt try to hide his sarcasm. Keith and I are planning to stay there all night tonight to see if Elliott turns up. If he does, he might need some serious help. You know where to find an old doctor who still knows his stuff. Thank you. Ill keep that in mind. All right, then. Treat him rightif you find him. And God be with you. Thanks. Sean climbed into his truck, threw it in reverse and glanced behind him, the empty gun rack snagging his attention. All his guns were locked up tight at home. Laura was safe and sound under his roof too. It should have given him a measure of peace. Driving down the road, Sean remembered Elliott whittling on his porch one night, rambling about every subject under the sun. Hed said there was a difference between justice and revenge. And sometimes, hed said, eyeing his knife, a sin wasnt a crime. Sometimes a crime wasnt a sin. Obviously, hed had his own ideas about justice. Maybe theyd still have a happy ending, though. Sean could imagine finding Elliott lounging against a tree trunk somewhere. Whittling a piece of wood, maybe. Hed be old and grimy and skinny, and maybe he wouldnt be entirely rational, but hed still be himself in the ways that mattered. Hed still be a good man with a kind heart. Hey, Sean, hed say, setting down his knife. Its been a long time. Yes sir, Sean would say. Welcome home. Thank you, son. You about ready to start those fiddle lessons? Maybe. You about ready to explain that car in the lake?  If the cabin and the house were the two most likely places for her dad to show up, she couldnt spend the night at Seans house. And what he didnt know couldnt hurt him. Laura knew shed be fine, home alone behind the new deadbolts, and she had more than enough reading material to last through her vigil. Sitting on the living room floor, surrounded by dozens of journals, she chose one at random and opened it to an entry from a January day: The crocuses will be up soon. In the middle of winter, her mom had longed for flowers. Theyd been a recurring theme in her life. Having recently browsed through the bulk of over thirty years worth of journaling, Laura saw other themes too. It was like working on a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle. She had gradually become familiar with colors and patterns. Shed started to see which pieces might fit together to make recognizable images. But she didnt have a puzzle box with the complete picture printed on it for reference. If it were a puzzle, shed start with the edge pieces that hemmed everything in. Then shed look for pieces that held distinctive elements, like lettering on a sign or unusual colors. But she couldnt distill the years of a familys life together into a single snapshot. If it could be an image at all, it would have to be a panoramic view that covered both space and time. A cross between a timeline and a map of her familys journey with their fellow travelers. It would include landscapes and weather too. She couldnt separate them; they existed in each other. Sunshine beating down on the streets of Prospect. Storms rolling through the mountains. A sprawling picture began to take shape in her mind. Railroad tracks curved across one corner, bringing a train into town through the bright green of the kudzu. In sharp detail in the foreground, blackberries gleamed in the brambles. Flowers bloomed everywhere in every color, under a sky of a million shades of blue and gray. On the far left, she saw young lovebirds as theyd been before their baby girl came along. A gentle musician turned combat-scarred veteran. His flower-child wife whod never dreamed of being married to a soldier. Farther along, thered be a carrot-top mama with a carrot-top baby on her hip. Farther still, thered be a red-headed toddler playing with blocks on a sunny kitchen floor or falling asleep to her dads lullabies. Then came school days with Cassie and Seanand tow-headed Tig dogging their steps. Darker colors came next. The veterans moods worsened, but even the darkest days included the bright threads of his wifes soothing words and the loyalty of his friends. Not just Gary and Ardelle, but the musicians whod drifted in and out of the house. Especially Doc, Noodle, and Gibby. She wished she could erase Gibby from the picture. Dale too, but he was part of it. His wife hid in the shadows, barely there. In her mind, Laura moved toward the right side of the panorama. High school. A bright-red truck. Initials carved into an old picnic table. Seans blue eyes and wry smile. The childhood scars he hid under his shaggy hair. The argument shed overheard as a teenager would be there too, in dark, muddy paints slashed with a violent red and venomous green. Betrayal, jealousy, rage. Hamlin Lake haunted the background, its bright blue waters beautiful and dangerous. The mountains stood behind everything else, holding their secrets tightly. Jessamyn Gantt had held her secrets tightly too, all the way to the grave, but her husband might come back from the dead and reveal at least some of them.          It was late, and Cassie wanted to go to bed. The three of them had been sitting together in the living room for a solid hour, and it was beginning to feel like an interrogation room. Her head hurt and her heart ached for her parents. Her mom seemed incapable of cooperating, and her dads patience had worn thin. Come on, Mom, Cassie said in her most soothing tone. Just admit it. Its not a big deal if you took a partially used bottle of cologne. Laura would have thrown it out anyway. Her mom sniffled. Stop fussing at me. I didnt do anything wrong. At least admit that you let yourself in sometimes when she wasnt home. Of course I went over there sometimes. I missed going over to feed Mikey. I liked walking into the house. Sometimes I could almost believe Jess was still alive. I could pretend shed walk in and start a pot of coffee and wed have a nice, long talk. Thats a little weird, Mom. Dont be rude, Cassandra Jane. Yes, I might have done more than Laura asked me to do, but stop accusing me of things. Ardie, Gary said softly. Ive smelled a new scent on you lately. Like the one Laura described to Cassie. The one thats missing. Stop it! Ardelle stood up, her chest heaving. Ill be scrapping. Leave me alone. She walked out of the room. Cassie rubbed her eyes and peered at her dad. He looked like a guy whod been on a bender. Bleary eyes, messy hair, his shirttails hanging out. It was so unlike him. Moving like an old man, he heaved himself out of his chair. Then he stood motionless. The mover and shaker didnt know what to do next. Mom needs help, Cassie said. She needs counseling. Of course she does. Ill ask Doc for some recommendations. He hung his head. Shell be so embarrassed. She shouldnt be. She shouldnt be embarrassed if she needs meds either. Well get through this. Together. All of us. I hope youre right. Cassie had never seen him so sorrowful. So lost. She crossed the room, kissed his cheek, and felt tears on his skin. Oh, Dad. Itll be okay. I hope so. Well just have to start looking for that perfume. Cologne. Whatever it is. Why is it so important to find it? If we find it, shell have to admit she took it. Shell have to admit shes been lyingabout all of it, probably. That might be the first step. Cassie didnt like his theory, but she didnt have anything better to offer. This is a huge house, and it could be anywhere. Then lets get busy. Still moving like an old man, he left her there. Shaken by the condition of her parents marriage, Cassie was suddenly terrified for her own. Late in Georgia was still a decent hour in California. She sank into the cushy chair again and pulled out her phone. Searching for cologne could wait until shed tried one more time to snag Drews undivided attention. Voice mail. She groaned. Waiting for the tone, she gave herself permission to be brutally honest. To say whatever came to her mind, no matter how bad it sounded. The tone came. Drew Cutler, I love you, she said, good and loud. But Im tired of sharing you with your mistress. Your business. And Im tired of being broke and far away from my family and your family, and I want to have your babies before Im too old and I want them to look just like you because I love you so much, but if you decide youd rather be married to your business instead, then you can have little business-babies someday with your business-mistress but Im not sharing you anymore. Do you understand? She slapped at the tears wetting her cheeks. If you love me, youll call me back this instant, and we wont stop talking until weve worked things out, and the stupid cologne hunt can just wait. Call me back now. Closing her phone, she started crying in earnest. He would think shed gone crazy. Maybe she had. In the middle of a horrible, ugly sob, she jumped out of her skin. That was Drews ringtone. Afraid to answer, afraid not to answer, she stared at the screen.  Sean and Keith had parked their trucks at a construction site down the road and walked to the cabin. Now they were hiding high on the hill above it. Dales truck was gone before they got there, and if Elliott was near, he wasnt making himself obvious. Theyd caught no scent of wood smoke, no motion, no light except the stars and the moonlight and the occasional airplane cruising across the sky. Most of the long, uncomfortable night still stretched out before them. Hunkered down on a small tarp atop the springy leaves, Sean wondered how many snakes might be annoyed with the intruders and how many ticks and kudzu bugs might be impervious to bug spray. Best not to think about it. Before night fell, hed taken a good look around. The cabin, nestled in a shallow valley, was nearly covered with kudzu. One look at the fallen roof and vine-choked floor had told him no sane person would try to live there. Therefore Elliott might. Sean checked his phone to make sure it was on. Laura probably wouldnt call, but he wanted to be available if she needed him. He leaned back on his folded jacket, watching the lights of a jet bound south for Atlanta. Even up in the mountains, miles into the wilderness, a man wouldnt be able to escape civilization completely. Every few minutes, another plane flew over. He thought of a September morning when four planes screamed down from a blue sky and changed America forever. He wasnt a military man, but the video clip that had moved him the most had shown a mob of people racing down the sidewalks of DC. Hed thought they were running away, but then the camera had panned out, showing the truth. Those people were running toward the Pentagon. Bent on rescuing friends and strangers, theyd run straight into death and destruction. Elliott, if hed been there and in his right mind, would have been in the thick of it too. But he probably hadnt been in his right mind for years. Probably wouldnt be, ever again, unless God worked a major miracle. A miracle on a par with restoring lost limbs. Sean had never seen even a minor miracle. Not one. And he lived in the Bible Belt. The lights of another plane drifted into view, reminding him of those few, eerie days when no planes flew. The sky had been empty. Nothing came between the earth and heaven. Nothing came between humanity and the eyes of God. The brothers stayed silent, watching lights glide across the black sky, watching the changeless darkness in the direction of the cabin. Sean fought to keep his eyes open. The tarp rustled as Keith shifted his weight. I still say its past time to get a little help from law enforcement, he whispered. Sean drew a slow breath. Maybe. But the sheriff thinks the rumors are bogus, and he doesnt understand some of the underlying issues. Id rather leave him out of it. Okay, but we should at least track down all the sightings and plot them on a map. Who saw him, and when and where. It might help narrow it down. We might not have time for a scientific approach. A faint, metallic ping charged the air. Sean froze, electrified. Keith caught his breath and held it. They sat in complete stillness, listening, but it didnt happen again. The sound, so brief and unexpected, could have been a small noise nearby or a loud noise made faint by distance. The hair rose in prickles on the back of Seans neck like it did when he was hunting and a deer was nearby. Couldve been Dale, Keith said, barely audible. But Sean thought of the missing wind chimes. When he cocked his head, listening, he thought he heard a soft, faraway laugh.  Although it was nearly three in the morning, Laura hadnt even been tempted to nod off. The journals scattered across the floor would have kept her thinking even if she hadnt been watching for her dads return. If she didnt connect with him soon, she might miss her chance forever. And there had to be at least one person who would give Elliott Gantt a chance to prove he was harmless. She had to welcome him home with open arms. Shed spent hours browsing her mothers writing. Most of it was shallow, self-absorbed nonsense, but the earliest journals had been different. Theyd bubbled with life and love. Now Laura wasnt even sure where to find them. Shed made a mess of Ardelles chronological orderon purpose, maybe. Laura stood up and walked among the stacks and spills of the slender volumes. She found half a dozen of the cheap, spiral-bound notebooks from the early years. Taking them back to the couch, she curled up with the quilt. She started with the one that opened with Jess Gantt as a young, pregnant wife. E. worries about Agent O., shed written. Such a pessimist. I keep telling him the baby will be absolutely perfect. Tears sprang to Lauras eyes. Shed never given much thought to it, but it made sense that he would have been exposed to Agent Orange. Of course he would have worried about birth defects, not to mention health issues for himself. She opened three more notebooks, checking their dates, before she found the one that covered her birth. There was nothing for the day she was born, but on the next day her mother had written: No time to journal yesterday. Laura Lillian made her appearance at 4:48 p.m. My baby girl is perfect. E. said she looks just like me, and he added with a grin: Thank God! I am SO thankful. Laura shook her head. Early in their marriage, her parents must have been happy. They must have been in love. A faint meow brought Laura back to the present. Two frail old souls were out there tonight: her dad and Mikey, whod slipped between her feet hours before when she went out to get the mail. The cat had made himself scarce, but now he was yowling at the door. Pathetic old thing. He wanted his independence, but he was too elderly, too frail to live in a world filled with fast cars and mean dogs and coyotes. In warm sweats, Laura left the quilt on the couch and walked into the kitchen, dimly lit by reflections from the outdoor security lights. She breathed faster, remembering the bearded man whod watched her from the window. She still wasnt absolutely certain it had been her father. But it would only take a few seconds to let Mikey in and lock the door again. The chances of someone being out there at that particular moment were minuscule. She would be fine. The cat meowed again. In the distance, a dog barked. Hang on a second, Mikey. Aware that the glaring lights might make her visible too, she felt for the switch and shut them off. The instantaneous blackness provided a new sense of concealment. She unlocked the door and opened it a few inches, just wide enough to admit a skinny cat. Mikey hurtled between her feet like a small, furry rocket. Through the crack, she saw a dark figure approaching from the far corner of the porch. She screamed, slammed the door and slapped the deadbolt home, her fingers like ice. Footsteps whispered unevenly but swiftly across the planks and down the steps. She leaned on the door, holding her breath. Listening. Her pulse hammered in her ears. Dad, she called with her mouth to the door. Dad, is that you? A tree branch creaked. Daddy? There was no sound but the wind and the fierce pounding of her pulse. She could almost believe shed imagined seeing someone, but she knew she hadnt imagined the footsteps. Limping footsteps. Dale didnt limp. Her dad had never limped before, but maybe he did now. Maybe he cut down wind chimes and prowled church camps and visited porches in the middle of the night. Maybe he didnt want a reunion with her. What did he want, then? God, help me, she said softly. I dont know what to do. Chilled all over, she pushed a chair under the doorknob then retreated to the den, where she opened her phone. Trying to decide whether to call 911 or Sean, she hesitated. If he knew someone had been on her porch, he would make the 911 call himself. The sheriff and his deputies would show up with their cars and searchlights, with guns and dogs. They would go after her dad like theyd go after a common criminal. Laura shut her phone. She wasnt calling anybody. He deserved a chance. And if the man on the porch wasnt her dadshe still had his guns, and she knew how to use them.          Cassie glared at the bedside clock. Five? Seriously, she was awake at five? Eastern? Shed stayed up half the night talking to Drewwonderful, adorable Drewbut then shed tossed and turned for hours, trying to imagine their unsettled future. Might as well get up and keep looking for that blasted Jean Nat, but she was starting to doubt Lauras crazy accusations. Wrapped in a warm robe shed snagged from her moms closet earlier in the week, Cassie padded slowly down the hallway toward the bathroom and tried to decide which room to search next. She didnt want to make a lot of noise while her parents were sleeping. Then she noticed a light under the door to the scrapping room. Her mom wouldnt be up so earlywould she? Slowly, Cassie turned the doorknob. Slowly, she opened the door. In her favorite flannel pajamas, her mother was sound asleep in her comfy swivel chair in front of the cabinet where she kept her supplies. Her mouth was open, and she was snoring ever so faintly. Cassie tiptoed across the room to the worktable. A half-finished scrapbook lay open to pages devoted to photos of Trevor. They were artistically arranged, embellished with stickers and shiny confetti, and captioned neatly. HalloweenTrevor as Captian Jack, one of the captions read. The misspelled word was glaringly obvious. Cassie looked back at her mother and was struck by the odd placement of her chair, smack-dab in front of the cabinet. As if she were guarding it. Pondering her options, Cassie realized she couldnt open either of the cabinet doors without nudging her moms legs aside and waking her up. But thered be no better way to startle her into an unrehearsed reaction. Cassie approached, quickly but quietly. She bent over and opened the right-hand door until it bumped against her mothers leg. Oops, Cassie said cheerfully. Sorry. Scuse me. Mmm? Scootch over a little, please. Still half-asleep, Ardelle obeyed. She even scooted her chair a little, making things easier. But when Cassie opened the door fully, Ardelle came fully awake. Get out of my cabinet! Too late. Cassie reached for the tiny bottle of Jean Nat. Oh, Mom. What else have you got?  Sean ached with fatigue as he and his brother trudged back to the construction site, just past dawn. What a waste of time. Theyd sat on the cold ground all night but hadnt seen or heard anything except that faint, metallic ping. And birds and bugs. Andmaybesomeone laughing at them. Long before dawn, birds had started calling. Mosquitoes woke up, hungry. A big, hazy peach of a sun came up. Hoping for a sign of life, theyd stayed a few more minutes. No dice. Keith, facing a day of work on no sleep, drove away first. The taillights of his truck disappeared around the curve as Sean was still climbing into his own truck. A quarter mile down Porter Road, he spotted Granny Colfax walking the other way. There wasnt much traffic yet, just a few people headed out to start their ordinary days. He couldnt remember the last time hed had one of those. He swung into Lauras driveway and rubbed his eyes. What was her car doing there? She was supposed to be at his house. But a few lights were on inside, and everything looked normal. Maybe she woke early and came home to feed the cat. He climbed out and headed up the steps. The door swung open. She stood in the doorway, wearing her moms black-and-white bandanna. Good morning, she said. Good morning. He stopped two feet away from her, noticing the circles under her eyes. Sleep okay? Um, no. A faint blush stole across her cheeks. I was up all night. Mostly. You didnt stay at my house, did you? She shook her head. Why not? This is the second time you said youd stay somewhere else and then reneged on it. I wanted to be here in case my dad came back. And maybe he did. At three in the morning. Her eyes flickered to his left. I opened the door, and somebody was on the porch. She pointed. Right there. Whoever it was, he ran right past me. No wonder theyd had no luck by the cabin. Elliott had been at the house? On the porch? You opened the door in the middle of the night? I was letting Mikey back in, all right? And then my dador whoever it wascame from the corner of the porch. I screamed and slammed the door. He ran off the porch, limping. I yelled through the door because I thought it might be Dad. Her lips trembled. But he didnt come back. Did you get a good look at him? No, it was too dark Dark? He looked up at the porch ceiling, where the high-intensity bulbs should have been blazing until full light. What happened to the security lights? I turned them off so if anyone was out there, they couldnt see me. He shook his head, but he couldnt chide her. Hed done the same thingbut not at three in the morning. She jerked in a short, sharp breath, her bravado dissolving. I sl-slammed the door so fast. INo! Mikey! The cat had darted outside again, past both of them. Now he was hightailing it toward the road. For an old cat, Mikey sure could move. Laura ran down the steps, doing the Here-kitty-kitty-kitty routine that usually brought the cat on the double. Not this time. Mikey was gone in seconds, disappearing into the tall roadside weeds. We shouldnt have been standing there with the door open, she said, stomping up the steps. Hed better not get hit. Sean couldnt remember the last time hed seen her so edgy. He couldnt blame her, but he wasnt in the mood to worry about a cat. He held the door open for her and followed her into the warmth of the house. What time did this happen? About three. Three. Thats right. You told me. Several hours after he and Keith had heard the noise near the cabin. So that could have been Elliott too. Or Dale. Or a stranger. The man on the porch might have been a stranger too. Or even Ardelle. Was it possible? Nothing had gone missing since hed changed the locks, but that didnt mean she wouldnt try to get in. She didnt live within walking distance anymore, though. It was already nearly full light. Afraid they were running out of time somehow, Sean paced the room, trying to think. Trying to focus. If it was your dad, why didnt he answer when you called out? I dont know, Sean. Same possibilities weve talked about over and over again. Maybe he was more afraid of me than I was of him. Sean shook his head, still trying to put everything together, and remembered the theory that had occurred to him in the middle of the night. If Laura was right about Gibby and Jess, it could explain not only Elliotts disappearance but also his reappearance. Maybe hed wanted revenge on Gibby but hadnt wanted to hurt Jess by acting on the impulse while she was alive. But if Elliott had somehow learned that shed passed away, he might have resurfacedjust when Gibby would be in town. Far away, a faint clang reminded Sean that the weekend was on its way. The PA system would start the canned music soon. Tonight the live bands would play. Main Street would be blocked off and swarming with tourists and locals. Downtown would smell like funnel cakes and cotton candy and beer. It seemed like some faraway planet, some silly world he used to live in. Lauras hand on his arm jolted him. Whats wrong, Sean? He tried to smile. Just about everything. Reaching with his other hand to pat hers, he noticed a yellowing bruise at her elbow. What happened there? Its nothing, really. Just a bruise. Her strange evasiveness piqued his curiosity. How did it happen? Iwell. You know, sometimes bruises just happen and you hardly remember how, later. But this one completely encircled her arm in a pattern all too familiar. The truth, Laura. Her shoulders rose and fell with a deep breath, and she met his eyes. Remember the day I gave you the songbooks? The day I ran into Dale in your driveway? He thought I was rude, so he grabbed my arm as I was walking away. Thats all. Thats all? Sean took her arm gently and examined the bruise. Hes not getting away with this. Its no big deal, she said, but there were tears in her eyes. Why didnt you tell me? I was afraid you would overreact. She gave him an impish smile. So prove me wrong, okay? Dont overreact. Our definitions of that word probably arent the same. I know, but let it go. Please. A little ol bruise wont matter if this is the day my dad comes back. She dabbed the corners of her eyes with her fingertips. Maybe hell sleep under his own roof tonight. She was pale. Exhausted. Shivering, probably not from cold but from nerves. Sean pulled her into his arms and leaned his head against hers, feeling her damp hair on his cheek and smelling her shampoo. Whatever happens, well go through it together. Closing his eyes, he flashed back to a hot August day. Laura, Cassie, and Tigger, their hands piled together with his, making a promise. Well always be there for each other. Remember? Laura nodded but didnt speak. When I say always, I mean always. The rest of our lives. She stiffened. She seemed to stop breathing. He held his breath too, waiting. She had to know he was talking about marriage. She looked up, her eyes shining with tears. Im afraid. Afraid of what? She lowered her gaze to his chin. When she finally spoke, he could hardly hear her. Your father. Dont call him that. Refusing to acknowledge that Dale is your father doesnt change facts. And even though I know youre nothing like him, I stillI worry. He must hate me like he hates my dad. Dont worry about it. Dale hates everybody. He hates my dad in particular. For rescuing you. Laura, weve been close since we were kids. I thought youd always been able to get past how vile Dale is. But nowwe dont have to stay here. If you want me to move to Denveror anywhere elseI will. She finally looked up, her eyes dark with sorrow. What if my dads back in Prospect? What then? Then well figure something out. Together. A long shriek of squealing tires twisted in the air. Mikey, Laura said with a catch in her voice. Mikeys been hit. Or missed. Sean looked out the window. Ill go see. Not just about the cat but about any signs that your visitor might have left behind. Ill go with you. No. Please. We still arent sure who were dealing with. Stay inside, doors locked. I dont care if the cat learns to speak English and comes back and says pretty please, dont open the door to anybody but me. He stole a quick kiss and left her standing there. He ran to the road and looked in both directions but didnt see a cat carcass anywhere. Hed be elected gravedigger if the cat had finally bought the farm. He was already Lauras locksmith, bodyguard, and detective. Who had time to run a business? Or talk a woman into marrying him?          From the window, Laura watched Sean cross the road, his hair rippling in the wind. He slowed on the grassy shoulder and climbed the steps to the churchyard. At the top, he checked the view in all directions. He descended the steps and started down the road, walking fast. Somewhere on the north side of town, a slow-moving freight blew its mournful whistle. The train would roll through Prospect, past the streets that were blocked off for the weekend. Past the kudzu jungle that had overtaken the berry patch. The train would pick up speed and keep going, leaving the town far behind. Wherever her dad was, he heard the whistle too. He was out there, somewhere. Listening. Ardelles yellow convertible swung into view and came to a stop behind Seans truck. Cassie was at the wheel. Forcing her face into some semblance of serenity, Laura opened the front door. Cassie hurried up the steps, holding a small cardboard box. One of those old, bronzy-green garden markers stuck out of it. Her face was pale; her hair unbrushed. No makeup, no jewelry, and her eyes were puffy. She might have just rolled out of bed, or maybe shed been crying for hours. You okay? Laura asked. I spent half the night having the most wonderful knock-down-drag-out argument with Drew, she said with a funny little smile. Ill explain later. Come on in. Whats in the box? Youre not going to believe it, she said, coming inside. Mom cant keep denying that she took anything. Shed stashed all kinds of stuff in her scrapbook cupboard. Stepping carefully through dozens of journals on the floor, Cassie made her way to the couch and sat down, still holding the box. You ready for some craziness? I hope so. Laura sat beside her. Cassie held up the bottle of Jean Nat. Its a scent Laura wouldnt wear anyway, she said in a spot-on impression of Ardelles voice. Then theres this. She held up a tube of peachy-pink lipstick. That looks exactly like a lipstick that used to be on my moms bathroom counter. Why am I not surprised? Cassie reached into the box again. She had these photos of your moms flower bedsmy mom says thats okay, theyre duplicates and shes sure you wouldnt mindand a copy of your moms obituary, but thats not something she swiped. Its been sitting around our kitchen for weeks. And theres one of those garden markers. Lets leave it in the box. I dont want to get dirt on your couch. Bewildered, Laura shook her head. Is there more? Oh yeah, and it gets weirder. She had the chain your dad used to wear. Cassie reached into the box again and handed Laura the chain with the silver cross and the dog tag still dangling from it. What? Id put them away in a drawer! Why would she snoop like that? And take something thats not hers? A memento of my dad, of all things. She didnt even try to explain that one. Or these. Cassie fanned out three Red Cross blood-donor cards on the couch. Red and white plastic, like credit cards. Laura spread them out further to read the names. What on earth? She had my moms card, your dads, and mine? She took it out of my wallet? When? How? I dont know. Cassie shook her head. Im sorry. I dont get it. Me either. If I wasnt home, I would have had my wallet with me. And if I was home Laura stopped. When I was here for the funeral, she came over to help with housework. She was here for a couple of hoursso she could have taken my card and Moms, right under my nose. But why? Thats what Dad was trying to get out of her when I left. Hell call me if he can make sense of it. Laura took a closer look at the Red Cross cards and her dads dog tag, and her brain seemed to shut down. Maybe she was in denial, but she couldnt accept the most logical explanation. It didnt jibe with what she already knew. Or thought she knew. Why Garys donor card? This is all wrong. Cassieremember in high schoolthose boxes? What are they called? Punnett squares? Cassie frowned. Dont ask me. I didnt do well in geometry. Not geometry. Genetics. Biology with Preston. Oh, I wish Id told you everything a long time agobut this doesnt fit anyway. Laura, what are you talking about? Im pretty sure my mom had an affair. With Gibby. Cassies mouth fell open. Gibby? With wide eyes, she stared at the Red Cross cards. What are you saying? What does that have to do with I dont know. My brains on strike. Lauras voice cracked. I need to borrow someone elses. Who understands genetics? Preston. Of course. Preston. Laura picked up her phone and called him. Afraid shed lose her nerve, she jumped into it the moment hed said hello. Mr. Preston, this is Laura Gantt. I have a quick science question for you. About blood types. If the mom is AB and the father is A, can they possibly have a baby with Type O? That scenario isnt bloody likely. Preston laughed at his pun, then launched into a rambling explanation that included alleles, genotypes, and phenotypes. Laura, focused intently on the dog tag marked with her dads blood type, wasnt in the mood to grasp every last detail, but the gist of the matter was clear. Unless either the US Army or the American Red Cross had made a serious clerical error, she wasnt Elliott Gantts biological daughter. Thank you, Laura said. That helps. Ive got to run. Bye for now. She managed to get through it without letting her voice break. What did he say? Cassie asked. Im pretty sure they had their affair when I was a teenager, so it doesnt make sense that ImIm the wrong blood type. What? Laura, I dont understand. Im the wrong blood type to be my dads biological child. The weight of the statement pressed heavy on her shoulders. Cassies eyes widened, then narrowed. No way. Based onyou mean Her voice trailed off. Wait a minute. Lets think this through. It could meaneither youre wrong about the timing of the affair, or your mom had more than one affair. Shoot, I cant imagine her having even one. But where did you get your idea about the timing? I heard my folks arguing about it the summer after we graduated from high school. So you thought it had just happened? Yes. But maybe thats only when the truth came out. Laura nodded slowly. Maybe. Cassie stood. I need coffee. Theres no coffee. No grinder. Theres tea. As Cassie walked into the kitchen, muttering to herself, Laura reached for the last item, the garden marker from one of her mothers flower beds. Hemerocallis Honey Redhead. Hemerocallis. The botanical name for daylilies. Laura took a sharp breath. She lifted her hand to her hair. My honey redhead, my redhead honey. Poor little carrot-top baby, you look more like your mama than your daddy. Somewhere in the back of her mind, she was aware of a vehicle roaring into the driveway. A door slamming. Whoa, Cassie called from the kitchen. My dads here, and he looks upset. Real upset, like he might be crying. Laura, this is scary. He never cries. Yes he does, Laura said under her breath. Shed seen Gary with tears in his eyes. The day theyd dropped off the tuna casserole. Shed thought he was worried about Ardelles agitation, but hed been talking about daylilies. Jess Gantts ordinary daylilies. Theyd had the power to make him cry? He bought me a daylily plant. Hes so sweet. He, shed written. Not E. How quickly things can blossom overnight A month or two later, in a new journal, shed added the gloomy line that made Sean say she must have been in a bad mood. Something about the brightest blossoms turning to rot. Laura had just read that entry but couldnt quite remember it. Burying her face in her hands, she tried to recall the other sentence that included the word rot, followed by three more words that had been scribbled over. A three-letter word, a four-letter word, and me. Recalling their shape and sizeand beginning to understand the contextLaura knew what her mother had writtenand why. It wasnt merely that shed been in a bad mood. Shed been in the depths of despair. Shed written about it in a sort of code except for the last three words. A beautiful plant can spring from the rot, from the dirt. God help me. An affair had blossomed quickly but went sour just as quickly? And then shed learned she was pregnant. Gary stepped inside, shutting the door with a clatter. His usually neat hair was a mess, and he was breathing hard. Laura. Wheres Sean? Across the road, looking for my dad. He just might find him. The latest is that somebody saw him trotting alongside the road a few miles from here. Heading this way. Laura shot to her feet. Maybe her dad was the man whod been on her porchbut that made it even more urgent to discuss the rest of it with Gary. She had to know. Gary She couldnt believe she was about to say this. Theres something you and I need to clear up, right now. Ignoring Cassies bewildered whispers behind her, Laura picked up the garden marker. Did you give my mother an old-fashioned daylily called Honey Redhead? The one that has bloomed in her yard for thirty years or so? Gary swallowed, his eyes shifting from side to side. Yes. Yes, I did. Did you know about the carrot-top baby, the honey redhead who looked more like her mama than her daddy? No, youve never read my moms journalsbut I think Ardelle has. With watery eyes, he stared at the sad little prizes on the couch. I didnt know. Not until now. SheArdellejust told me what all these things mean. She knew about Jess and me. Cassie gasped. Dad! His chest rose and fell in a big breath. You have to understand. His voice broke. Iwith Jessit just happened. It didnt last long. He wiped tears away. I never dreamedJess never said a word about a baby. He met Lauras eyes. I always thought you were Elliotts. She was bewildered to the point of numbness, but she had no reason to doubt him. I believe you. He stared at her as if hed never seen her before, and she stared back. Flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, fruit of his sinand her mothers. That sandy blond hair, the same color as her dads. Blue eyes. A similar build. Gary Bright and Elliott Gantt had sometimes been mistaken for brothers. Gary started talking fast. It wasnt long after he got out of the service. She fell apart when she was telling me about his new moods. His black moods. I gave her a hug, a friendly, brotherly hug, andthats how it started. I never told Ardelle. I thought it would be better that way, but she knew. Or at least she suspected. All this time. It has been terrible for her. No kidding! Cassies sass began to come back as she got in his face. Admitting its true is the first step. Thats what you just told Mom about a bottle of cologne. You hypocrite! I didntdidnt mean to be a hypocrite, he said. I only meant to leave it in the past. Ive been faithful to your mother ever since. Cassie, Im so sorry. So sorry. Cassie started talking right over his endless apologies. Laura, hardly listening, tried to process these strange new truths, but she could hardly breathe. Couldnt think. And Gibby? He hardly seemed to matter now. Im sorry, Gary said again. Not as sorry as you should be, Cassie said. How can you claim you didnt know? Look at Laura! I see it now. Sure, she has her moms eyes, but she looks like you too. Dad, Im so ashamed of you. Gary nodded, hanging his head, then turned to Laura. Your dad knew? I dont know. I heard him confronting my mom, years ago, but I thought he meantsomeone else. Her own voice seemed to come from a great distance. Garys face turned pale. What will he do to me if he comes back? I deserve it, butoh God. He nearly strangled me once for making a stupid wisecrack. What will he do if he knows about me and your mother? Andand you? The baby. Shaky and cold, Laura studied the cross and the dog tag on the silver chain. Emblems of Elliott Gantts faith, his service to his country, and his blood type, but she hadnt a drop of Gantt blood in her. Had he found out suddenly, a month before her eighteenth birthday? And staged his own drowning? She stood. I cant take any more of this. I cant sit here and hash things out while my dad Tripping on that word, she met Cassies glistening eyes. Looks like were half sisters. Cassie rushed her, enfolding her in a fierce hug. Theres nothing halfway about it. Were sisters. Weve always been sisters. Elliott was a brother to me. Gary let out a gut-wrenching sob. I didnt just betray my wife. I betrayed my brother. With the silvery chain still dangling from her fingers, Laura hugged Cassie back, but she was frozen inside. Frozen and numb and very much afraid of what might happen next.  Feeling alone and naked without his gun, Sean had walked down the road a quarter mile in each direction. Hed found no clue about what those shrieking brakes had meant. No cat, no man, no vehicle. Now, standing by Jesss grave, he heard the whine of a motorcycles engine. No, two. Two high-powered bikes flashed into view, chasing the curves. Their riders crouched low in their bright leathers and whipped past, stirring the roadside weeds. The moment crystallized like a snapshot: the two bikerslife, noise, color, speedflying past the mild-mannered sign in the churchs parking lot: COME WORSHIP WITH US. PASTOR HORACE REESE. THIS IS THE DAY. The day for what? They should have quoted the rest of the verse. The sound of the bikes faded into the distance as Sean studied Jesss grave. He felt cheated. No clues here. No footprints, no gray hair snagged on a branch. None of the convenient evidence that always popped up in TV shows. The azaleas had fallen over again. This time, nobody had righted them. Please, God, he whispered. If its somebodys day to diemake it the cat. But even if he found Mikey alive, how could he corral a tough old critter that wanted to remain free? Or if he found Elliottwhat then? The prospect of seeing him again gave Sean a rush of that desperate old need for a father. If Elliott came back, though, hed be the needy one. Sean thought he heard someone speak, somewhere behind the church. He held still and listened. Nothing but a cardinals shrill, repetitive whistle now, but he wanted to make sure. He leaned around the corner of the church and surveyed the expanse of kudzu-covered trees and bushes. It went on for acres, interrupted by an occasional stand of pines that hadnt yet been conquered. He walked farther into the wild vines. He was dwarfed by the green towers that had once been living trees. They made a weird, alien landscape where a man could hide, silent as a deer, and wait. Downtown, bluegrass blared from the PA system, reminding him of Elliott and his upstart, part-time, ragtag band. Every year, theyd earned standing ovations. They were that good. Bile rose in Seans throat. His mentor, a talented man whod crafted fine musical instruments and furniture, was living in the wild like an animal. Hed abandoned his family and friends, his business, his responsibilities. All because his wife might have cheated on him? Laura had paid the price too, although she wasnt to blame. Shed been paying the price for years. Fury boiled up inside Sean. Hed had enough of Elliotts game. Elliott! he yelled. Where are you? The dense vegetation swallowed his voice. It produced no movement, no sign of life, no sound except a jay squawking as it flew over. No planes marred the blue, blue sky overhead. Nothing came between him and the eyes of God, who knew exactly where Elliott Gantt was. No, Sean would never have a father on earth, and if there was a Father in heaven, he wasnt talking. He opened his mouth to scream at the Almighty but heard familiar laughter and whirled around. Dale stood there, raising a clenched fist like a prizefighter whod just won the big one. Beside him, in the grip of his other hand, stood a stoop-shouldered man with terror-stricken eyes in a gaunt, bearded face.          Elliott Gantt, in the flesh. Emaciated flesh. His filthy gray shirt reeked of wood smoke and sweat. He rolled the tattered hem of it between bony, contorted fingers that must have been pounded with a sledgehammer, the bones left to set any which way. His bedraggled beard ruffled in the wind, gray as his shirt but streaked with white. I nabbed him out by the old cabin, Dale said, grinning. I was takin him to town, but the old geezer jumped right out of the truck, just up the road. I had to slam on the brakes and chase him down. Lauras in trouble, Elliott said in a rusty voice. We have to hurry. Yeah, weve got to find her. Dale winked at Sean. Before its too late. Sean read the fear in Elliotts moist eyes and knew what Dale had done. Lauras fine, Sean said. I dont care what he told you, Elliott, but its a lie. Shes safe. Confusion played across Elliotts features. Shes in danger. With a crippled finger, he pointed across his sunken chest toward Dale. He told me so. Shut up, Dale mouthed silently to Sean. Dale lied, Sean said. He just wanted to lure you out. Lauras fine, Elliott. I talked to her a few minutes ago. Dale smiled, pretending innocence, and tugged Elliotts elbow. Lets go downtown, then. Wouldnt you like to be onstage one more time? Waving to the crowds? So Dale wanted to make a spectacle of Elliott. Even in the opening hours of the festival, thered be more people than hed seen in more than a decade. He would freak out. And hed get a free ride to a psych ward. Theres no need to go into town, Sean said. The old mans breath came in hard, fast rasps. I dont care about the town. Wherewheres Laura? He didnt look like he could harm anybody. He seemed to slide in and out of the present, his eyes clear one moment and foggy with confusion the next, but always glistening with tears. Sean hesitated, remembering that Laura had mentioned Alzheimers. Have you been trying to see her? Yes, but she was so afraid. It made me sad. I want to see her, but I dont want to scare her. He let out a dry sob from deep inside his bony chest. And Imso grubby. Come with me, then. Im grubby too. I need a haircut and a shave. Sean patted his own whiskered mug. Laura will want to clean us up, both of us. She wont run from me? No sir. If she knows its you, she wont run. She just wants to know youre okay. Elliotts lips moved, but he said nothing, like a child trying to work out an adult-sized problem. Dale still gripped Elliotts elbow, and Sean took his other arm. Dale let Sean win the tug-of-war. Plan B, he said. Dont lose im, boy. He moved a few feet away and pulled his phone from his pocket. Hey, Sean said. Who are you calling and why? Its my turn to call the cops. I want this freak hauled in. Elliott hasnt committed a crime. It was a crime all right, what he did. Dale turned and walked toward the church. Come on. Sean steered Elliott away from Dale. Toward home. But theres something you need to know, if you dont know already. About Jess. The faded blue eyes sparkled brighter. I know, son. Shes gone. Its grievous to my heart, as death ought to be. Yes. Im sorry. They moved a few feet closer to home, Elliott moving as lightly as a cat. A weak and wobbly cat. How did you hear about Jess? Sean asked. Ruby Pearl kept me up on the news, especially these last weeks since I came down from the mountains. Ruby Pearl? Whos that? Elliott held a mangled fist upright, like a flag bearer holding an imaginary flagpole. Old girl with the fee-faddle. Thethe rain thing. Granny Colfax? With an umbrella? Parasol? Thats it. Ruby Pearl Colfax. Shes a good one for keepin secrets. Brings me news and necessities out to the home place when I stay there. He smiled. Ruby Pearl was a killdeer to me. She lured folks away from my nest, a time or two. So, Granny Colfax had toted more than news and necessities. Shed carried a big secret, all this time. No wonder she walked the country roads, rain or shine. Elliott sighed. Now, son, you want to know why I left my family. I can see you do. Its hard to explain. You dont have to explain a thing. I was afraid. Id killed before, so I knew I could kill again. Sad for the old soldier, Sean shook his head. It was part of your job. Elliott coughed, his shoulders shaking. But I wanted Gary dead. Gary? Dont you mean When it was over, Jessamyn was carrying Garys baby. Seans mind reeled. Gary? Laura? The timing was all wrong. Are you sure? Im sure. Elliott drew a raspy breath. I didnt know for years. When I found out, well, I entertained murderous thoughts toward him. Like a friend ought not to do. You dont act like youd want to murder anybody. Elliott laughed softly and raised his ruined hands. I did that. Did it to myself. Why? So I wouldnt be able to hold a gun. I couldnt trust myself not to harm a friend orthe woman I loved. Seans skin crawled, first at the thought of Elliott firing at Jess, then at the thought of a man deliberately ruining his own flesh and then suffering alone in the wilderness. It wasnt normal. How could he even bait a fishhook with claws like that? Thered be no fiddle lessons now, that was certain. And I dropped my guns in the lake, Elliott said. Lest I should use them for evil. Then I took myself far away, just to be sure. But when I found out Jess was gone, I knew Laura would come. I had to see her. Im starting to understand, Sean said, looking ahead. One more curtain of kudzu to wade through, and theyd be back on the weedy grass within view of the house. What matters now is youre back, and Im glad. I thank you kindly, son. Sean looked behind them. Still on his cell phone, Dale lurked at the corner of the church building. He flashed a phony smile. Sean ignored him. Elliott, are you ready to see Laura? Elliotts eyes widened as if hed forgotten her existence. His chapped lips curved into a genuine smile. Ready. Yes sir, Im ready. As they crossed the rough lawn, he stumbled on a tuft of grass that the mower had missed. Sean tightened his grip, holding him upright. Elliott wore ancient brown moccasins, slick with wear. His big toes were poking out, the toenails black and ragged. And all those good shoes had been going to waste in his closet. They were only a minute or two from Laurawho wasnt his child? But there might still be some joy at the end of his strange journey. At least he could enjoy food and a bath and a clean, soft bed. Simple comforts. Elliott was a wreck of a man, though. Laura would go into shock if she were to see him with no warning. Ill give Laura a call, Sean told him. You cant just walk in, unannounced. Youd give her a heart attack. Like you nearly did when you were on her porch. That was you, wasnt it? It was. I had a late start. I had to sneak away slow-like in the wrong direction. Ive had too many visitors, coming too close to my shed. There was a shed at the cabin? It must have been buried in the kudzu. Sean shook his head. Hed have to tell Keith theyd been so close. He pulled out his phone and called Lauras number. She answered after one ring, sounding sad and scared. Laura, honey, I have good news. What is it? Down on the road, nobody was driving by. Nobody was watching as Elliott Gantts frail legs carried him home from the wilderness. Brace yourself, Sean told Laura, his eye on the house. I want you to look out the window. Well be walking across the road. Coming home. Home? Her voice quavered. Whos coming home? Your two favorite men in the whole, wide world. A stunned silence. A long, slow inhalation of air, like shed been starved for oxygen and shed finally found some. Dont lie to me, she said, louder now. Sean Halloran, dont you dare. Dont say it unless its true. Hes not like he used to be, but Im walking your dad home. He waited, expecting the wild, joyful scream of a girl whos beating a boy at a green-plum war. Any second now, shed yell I told you so! at the top of her lungs. A crash hit his ear. Shed dropped her phone. Fainted, maybe. And hed thought he was doing such a good job of breaking it gently. With a gentle tug to Elliotts arm, Sean encouraged him a bit closer to the road in case Lauras view was blocked somehow. Over this way, partner, Sean said. You okay? Elliott nodded, trembling. Sean was shaking too. Across the road, the front door banged open. Laura, Cassie, and Gary spilled through the doorway, but only Laura ran to the edge of the porch. She stopped there at the top of the steps. The sun glinted on something metallic dangling from her hands when she pressed them together as if in prayer, fingertips touching her lips. Then she raised her hands like an old-time Pentecostal grandma praising Jesus. That metallic something flew into the air and landed somewhere with a faint tinkle. Laura hurtled down the steps. Barefoot, with her red hair flying behind that snug bandanna, she raced toward the road. Sean patted Elliotts shoulder. Here she comes. Shes a sweetheart, isnt she? Theres my Laura. Elliott stretched his broken hands toward her. Shes my girl. Glancing at Gary, who stood motionless on the porch, Sean could only wonder.          Laura could hardly believe her eyes. They stood together, two tall, lean figures with wild-man hair. One was dark, with a barely started beard; one was gray, his feathery beard ruffling in the wind. He bore no resemblance to the strong, strapping man whod once saved a skinny boy from a beating. She stumbled through prickly weeds and lunged across the road, the bank hiding the men from her view. Sharp stones and burrs cut her feet. Then the cement steps were underneath her. She scrambled up them. At the top, she gulped a breath and took a long, hard look at her dad. Her dad, alivebut he was so thin! Tottery, stooped, long-haired. Ragged clothes hung on his bony frame. Still, she would have known that smile anywhere. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy! She raced up the hill, crying. Laura. He opened his arms, an old, broken bird spreading crippled wings. His hands were contorted. Twisted. The sight jolted her almost to a stop. Careful not to hurt him, she forced herself to a walk. His feverish blue eyes faded from clarity to confusion and back again as she approached. Excuse me if I stare, he said. Youre not the little girl I remember. But its me, she said, stepping into his wiry, smelly embrace. She wanted to ask what had happened to his hands, but she didnt want to ruin his homecoming with tears. Youre all right? His voice was thin with fear. Im fine, Dad. Just fine. But what about you? She pulled back and took in his hollow cheeks and his watery eyes. You okay? He reached out to brush her hair off her forehead. Like talons, his fingers couldnt uncurl enough to make solid contact. The man said you were in danger, he said fretfully. ItsSlattery, isnt it? Slatterys back. She looked toward Sean again. He shrugged, apparently as mystified as she was. Im fine, really. But Dad, Slatterys long gone. Hes not after you, now? If he is, Ill He stopped, his forehead puckered. No, youre right. Hes gone. I made sure of it. The lake, you know. Aw, no. Seans face paled. No, Elliott. Dont. What? Laura asked, lightheaded now. What are yall talking about? Slattery. Sean wheeled around, strode a few paces away, and came back, pressing his fingers to his temples. You didnt hear that, Laura. You didnt hear that. He looked behind him. Is Dale close enough tothank God, he isnt. Oh, Lord. Hear what? she demanded. What does it mean? Her dad rambled on. Hes gone, Slattery is. Hes with his car in Bennetts lake. I remember now, mostly. He passed one hand over his forehead. They couldnt keep him in prison, so I took care of it for em. Hell never stalk another little girl. Enough, Sean bit out. We dont want the details. Her dad kept going, his voice thin but clear. After Nam, I vowed I would never kill again. And I vowed to protect the innocent, like I sometimes couldnt, over there. Then came a day when I had to break the one vow to keep the other. He blinked, and twin tears trickled down the sides of his nose. God help me, but I had to do it. I dont quite recall how, but I did it. Slattery hadnt skipped town, then. And Sean hadnt witnessed some unknown car thief hiding his crime. Hed seen her father. The blood rushed from Lauras head. The sunny day wobbled around her, everything slanting off balance. When her mom had accused her husband of having blood on his hands, it wasnt antiwar rhetoric. She must have known. When? Laura asked. Where? Summertime, her dad said. Late summer, by the tracks. The little oneyou know. The happy little one. Nobody was watching her. She didnt know Slattery was after more than her blackberries. II stopped him before he could take what he wanted. Tigger, Laura whispered. Her knees lost their strength. Sean grabbed her elbow, steadied her. Late that summer, the year Slattery disappeared, theyd picked a bumper crop of berries. But one day, Tigger stayed to fill her bucket by herself. Lauras dad had returned to check on her, and hed kept something terrible from happening. Hed dealt with Slattery somehow. No wonder hed been in such a black mood that night when Laura came home with painted nails like a grown woman. His face clear now, no trace of trouble on it, he cocked his head toward distant music. Listen. Foggy Mountain Breakdown. Theres a good tune. The wreckage of his fingers fidgeted as if he were coaxing notes from a fiddle. Theres not much music in the mountains. Ive missed it. He patted his chest pocket, producing a metallic clinking. This is my only music now. For Jess. My Valentine. When he lowered his hand, the silvery wind chimes peeked through a hole in his pocket. Sean laid his hand on her fathers narrow shoulder. Looks like youve missed a few meals. What would you say to a bite to eat? Maybe a bath? Some clean clothes? I would say thank you very much, sir. He inclined his head toward Laura in a familiar, courtly nod. But first, together, lets pay our respects to your sweet mother. Together, they walked toward the family plot. The head of the grave wasnt far from the bright pink bushes where Laura had cut azaleas days ago. The tin vase had fallen, and the flowers were limp and faded. The wind picked up, sending an empty paper cup rolling down the slope. Distracted, her scarecrow of a dad laughed at it. Then he started singing an old ballad, but not the one the PA system was pumping out, downtown. The two songs clashed in key, in rhythm, in mood. Where did you stay last night, O Randall, my son, he crooned, out of tune. Hed once had perfect pitch. Strong, skillful hands. His own business. A circle of friends whod loved him. A wife and daughteryes, she was his daughter! As much as if hed adopted her from an orphanage and claimed her as his own. Laura stole another look at his ruined hands. They had crafted sweet-voiced mandolins and cozy rocking chairs and doll furniture. Those hands had protected. And theyd killed. The PA system kicked into another number, louder and faster, spinning into a toe-tapping reel. Her dad tilted his head, seeming to focus on the music, or maybe he was listening to a train. Another one was approaching town on the long curve from the north. Where did Dale sneak off to? Sean asked abruptly, turning in a circle. Laura spotted him first and pointed. Leaning against the brick wall of the church, Dale watched them. She turned her back on him, and movement across the road caught her eye. Gary was walking down the porch steps. With his shirttails flapping, he started across the road, toward the steps that led up the bank to the graveyard. He kept to his deliberate pace as he climbed the steps and then the hillside. Laura moved close to her dad, taking his arm and leaning her head against him. Dad, I know you and Gary havehave clashed before, but this isnt the right time to fly into one of your moods. Sit tight. Keep yourself under control. His dry laugh seemed to mock her worries. Dont fret about me. I can handle my old compadre. Gary slowed. He stopped, maybe at some inner Rubicon, then thinned his lips and started moving again. He drew nearer, hiking up the gradual slope, and didnt stop again until hed nearly reached them. Elliott, he said. Welcome home. Thank you kindly. Gary hung his head. Cassie just finished ordering me to face you like a man, but I guess you already know what I did. Yes, I do. Lauras pulse quickened. Her dad knew everything, then? Knew about both affairs? Even knew she wasnt his baby? Im very sorry. Gary extended his hand. Will you forgive me? Blinking back tears, Laura wondered how many times her dad had said those words to Gary. Now the tables were turned. She lifted her hand from her dads arm, and he stepped forward. I have already forgiven you, he said, extending his claw-like hand to Gary. Ive forgiven my good friend and my dear wife. Garys eyes were wet. Thank you. I want to make amends. I want you to have whatever you need. All the best. The best care. The best doctors. I hate doctors. Hospitals. He released Garys hand. IIyou wont do that to me. No sir, you will not. You dont hate Doc Marsh, Sean said. He wont put you in a hospital. Paying no attention to that, her dad turned and walked to the grave. Laura, Sean, and Gary turned in unison to watch as her dad righted the tin vase. Slowly and carefully, he began to straighten the azalea branches. A stillness settled over her, an acceptance that was very much like peace. She couldnt change the past, nor could she know the future. She had this moment, though, with her dad only a few feet away. It was strange and wonderful to see a living man so close to his name on a memorial plaque. He was alive. Alive! Hurry up there, old man. Dales raspy voice came from behind her. You got places to go. People to see. As Laura faced him, so did Sean and Gary. A rush of courage swept her. The three of them stood between Dale and her dad. Together, they could keep him safe. She glanced behind her, meeting her dads puzzled gaze. He held a small stem of azaleas in his mangled fingers. Its all right, Dad, she said. Well be home soon. Oh no you wont. Dale came closer. Mr. Gantt has an appointment with the law. Sean clenched his fists. You really called the cops? Why? Hes a criminal, Dale said. A prowler. So I turned him in. Like he turned me in. He made me lose my job, my house, my building. No, that was me, Gary said mildly, as if he didnt mind the accusation. Dales chest seemed to grow larger, puffing up. His eyes, usually so cold, burned with hatred. You, Bright? You made that call? I did. I dont regret it, either. Thats how you got your filthy hands on my building? Gary shook his head. Now, Halloran, youd better get your facts straight. I got all the facts I need, Dale said. Thats how you can afford to be the big, generous rich man. You turned me in. You sent me to prison. You stole my building. You stole my son. You dont deserve your sons, Gary said, his eyes wet. Either one of them. Shut up before I shut you up, Bright. You lying thief. Dales face was flushed. Sweating. Gary never stole anything, Sean said. He has given. And given. Dale turned on Sean. Yeah? You want me to pay it forward for you, Mr. Luthier? Heres how I pay you and your highfalutin pals. He pulled something small and shiny from his pocketa toy gun. Give it to me, Sean said quietly. You dont want to go there, Dale. Laura took a sharp breath. Not a toy. Tiny but real. The pansy gun? In the silence, she heard a faint stirring behind her. Felt a small breeze. Her dad brushed past her. I love you, he whispered with a wink that said Ill be all right. He stepped in front of Gary. A huge blast ripped out of the tiny gun. Laura screamed. Her dad crumpled backward, his arms twisting around his head. He fell into Gary, knocking him over. Laura hit her knees and crawled to her dad. Blood was already spreading across his threadbare shirt. Screaming again, she looked upinto the barrel of the tiny gun. Sean, in a blur, rushed Dale. Another shot exploded in the burning air. Sean roared and fell beside Laura. Sandwiched between them, between the warmth of their bodies, she smelled smoke. Sweat. Blood. Spitting out grass and dirt, she tried to speak but lost her own voice in the confusion and shouting. Afraid to look, she looked anyway. Gary was shoving Dale to the grass. Pinning him there. Laura struggled to sit up, to see. Her daddy was gone, his eyes open but sightless. A baby dolls eyes. His chest, a ruin of blood. Feathery gray hair, streaked with white, lifted by the wind. Chimes, spilling from his pocket. In his hand, faded pink flowers splashed with red. On his skinny forearm, life everlasting. Sean moaned. Laura twisted, bending over him. High on his chest, a red hole spurted blood on his shirt in time with his pulse. Blue eyes wide, he stared at her. Blinked. Sean! She scrambled up, gravel grinding into her knees. Pressure points. Pressure points. What had she learned? Something about the clavicle. Collarbone. Arteries, pressure points. She couldnt think. No! A distant screamher own. No! Shed lost her dadagainand Seans lifeblood was spurting out of him. Faster now. A regular rhythm, speeding fast, faster. Bright red blood. An artery. She tore her bandanna off her head and pressed it hard against his chest. Scarlet blood pulsing into white-and-black cotton. Soaking it, so quickly. Laura leaned closer. Dont you dare die. I already lost Mom. I cant lose you and Daddy and Mikey all in the same day. I wont have it! Do you hear me? His eyes opened. Youd ratherhavethe cat, he said faintly, one corner of his mouth curling up. His eyes rolled up in his head. The lids fluttered and closed. Desperate, she looked for help. A sheriffs cruiser swept into the church parking lot. An officer climbed out. A woman. It had to be Kim Milton. Speaking into a radio, so far away that her voice was inaudible, she headed up the slope at a slow jog, her revolver drawn. Kim! Laura screamed. Help! Hurry! Somewhere in town, a siren wailed. The train whistle blew, fading into the south. Dale ranted unintelligible words but couldnt escape. Gary, straddling him, cursed and cried. Cassie flew at him too, shrieking. Kicking. Seans eyes opened, glassy and strangely calm. They closed again with no sign that hed seen her. His skin was white. Squeezing two fingers to the cold skin of his wrist, Laura sought his pulse. Still there. Fainter. Faster. Her shoulders heaved with deep, rasping sobs. Sean, stay with me! The wind blew her hair into her mouth. Did Kim even see that two men were down? One dead, one dying. The two men Laura loved most. I need help now, Kim! Help! Sirens wailed over the fiddles and banjos. The trains whistle faded, a ribbon of sound sliding away into the distance. Her hair covered her face, her eyes. She couldnt see Sean. She could hardly breathe. His pulse fluttered faster now. Weaker. He was slipping away. Hed be gone even before the train.          On Saturday afternoon, Laura walked Tigger and Cassie out to the lobby of the hospital. After giving them quick hugs, Laura stepped back and tried to smile. Tig, did Cassie ever buy you a new hair clip? Hair clip? To replace the glittery pink one you lost in the berry patch. Tig shook her head. I dont know what youre talking about. It was a blessing that Tig didnt remember much about that day, and Cassie had never learned the worst of it. She never would. Never mind, Laura said. Thanks for stopping by. Well be back, Cassie said. Keep your chin up, sis. Almost in unison, she and Tigger waved and headed for the bright sunshine outdoors. Cassies phone rang just then and she whipped it out of her pocket. Laura couldnt hear the conversation, but she knew from the happiness in Cassies voice that Drew had called. Again. Theyd been on the phone almost constantly since the shooting. Laura turned and began her trek back to Seans bedside. She was glad Gary hadnt come today. She didnt have the emotional energy. It wouldnt be awkward forever, though. Maybe he and Ardelle would be all right too. Poor Ardelle. Shed admitted to Gary that shed suspected his infidelity thirty years before. Shed found one smudge of peach lipstick on his collar, and shed recognized the scent of Jean Nat on his shirts. Her suspicions had flared again, six weeks ago, when he cried at the funeral. Then shed read between the lines in some of the journals shed boxed up. But until shed compared the dog tag and the Red Cross cards, she hadnt been sure Laura was his child. Ardelle must have known the significance of the daylilies too, or she wouldnt have pulled the garden marker out of the dirt. She was a lot smarter than some people gave her credit for. The plants from the funeral, massed around the fireplacehad she wanted to rub Garys nose in the fact that Jess had died? Or maybe all of it was like picking at a scab, like Cassie had said. A set of big automatic doors slid open, farther down the corridor. A tall man came through, walking slowly, keeping his eyes on the floor. Gibby Sprague was seventy if he was a day but still strikingly handsome. He was dressed all in black. Silver hair curled over his collar. A gold watch chain shone against his vest. He didnt notice Laura. I forgive you, Gibby, she whispered, mostly to remind herself shed made that choice. But she still wanted the truth. The closer he came, the more she wanted it. He looked up and opened his arms. Laura. I cant believeany of it. She stepped into his hug. I cant either. Hows Sean? Hes hanging in there. Theres not much change. God love im, Gibby said. You all right, honey? Im as all right as I can be. He draped his arm around her shoulders and they continued walking. Is there anything I can do for you? Anything at all? Yes. You can answer one question. Did you and my mom? Now, now. You know I love the ladies, but a gentleman never tells. Lauras lofty notions about forgiveness evaporated in an instant. She stopped walking, pulling herself out of his reach. How could you? My dad trusted you. He loved you, and you and my mom betrayed him. Thats why he left, Gibby. What are you talking about? Gibbys bewildered expression slowly changed to one of comprehension. Youve got a little knot in your timeline, baby. Whatever did or didnt happen between your mother and me, it wasnt until about two years ago. It wasnt for lack of trying on my part, but she wouldnt give me the time of day as long as she held out hope that your daddy might come back. What? She believed he was alive? Andand she told you? She believed it, up to a point, but she finally decided to move on. Dont fault her for it. IIno, of course not. But I cant believe she told you. She never told me. She may have had her reasons, he said with a shrewd smile. She was an original, God love her. And I think He did. Does. He pulled a gold watch from his vest pocket. I had to stop by to ask how Seans doing, but Im playing on the main stage in half an hour. Youd better get going, then. Call me sometime, you hear? Let me know about Sean. I will. No hard feelings between us? Of course not, Gibby. Im sorry I thought Its all right. Always the gentleman, he bent over and kissed her hand. He turned and walked away. Her heart should have been lighter as she continued walking toward the ICU. If Sean made it, maybe hed live to play with Gibby somedayand to teach some young Hallorans how to play guitar and mando and banjo. If he didnt make it, she wouldnt care about anything, ever again.  Women, talking. One, young and angry. One, old and crotchety. Loud. Life hurts, honey, the old one said. You dont get over life until you die. Bright lights pounded his eyelids. Nasty smells. Irritating noises, likelike supermarket scanners. Where was he? He tried to open his eyes but the lids were too heavy. A sharp memory flashed into his mind. Something about a gun. Half his chest had blown up. Then he was walking across the church grounds. No, he was floating. Trying to stay on the right side, the side with picnics and weddings. Trying to stay away from graves and darkness. He fought, finding his way back to an old house. A house that breathed. A swing on the porch, lilies in the yard. A red-haired girl hugging a skinny cat The pain grew and faded. Grew and faded. Now, the light brightened. No, dimmed. The women kept talking. Now he heard men. Keith. Gary. Grown men, crying. Gary, saying something about an auction. I didnt plan it that way, Gary choked out. Its okay, Sean tried to say. He couldnt make his lips move.  Morning. Had to be. The light was different now, even on his closed eyelids. How many mornings had come and gone? The old lady, talking. Talking too loud, like she was deaf and thought everybody else was too. Then the sweet one. The angel. Laura? He tried to hold on to her voice, but it faded. In and out. Coming and going. She said something about quenching a smoking wick. God said He wouldnt do that, but He did, and if He ever does it again, Hell hear about it. That was Laura, all right. Mad at God. Trying to tell Him how to run the world. But God could handle her. Whats that you say? the old lady shouted. Speak up, baby. God, you say? No, God didnt pull no trigger. That was Dale. Another memory. A tiny, familiar handgun, aimed at No. Dontdont The women ceased chattering for a moment, then resumed. A light exploded in his head. Then he remembered. A shot. Another one. Incredible agony. The smell of something burning. Screams. Sirens. Pain. It was all coming back. He didnt want it to.  If the nurses and that mumble-mouthed doctor would leave him alone, hed have time to think. Time to grasp what couldnt be grasped. The official-sounding voices receded toward the door. Grew fainter. Faded away. Peace. Quiet. Now he could think. Behind closed eyelids, Sean pictured the train pounding past the berry patch where a happy little girl loved to pick berries. Two men saw her there alone. A good man and an evil one. Now the evil one was dead. So was the good one. Everybody would die one day. I dont want to die. Nobody answered. Sean tried again. Lord, Im not finished yet. I have to take fiddle lessons. Sell a house. Marry Laura. A gasp from across the room. Did he try to say something, Granny? He tried to nod his head. A lump of lead. Heavy. Sean? A hand touched his. Clasped his. Squeezed. He squeezed back. A sharp intake of breath. Sean? You in there? Where else would I be, woman? The words refused to come out of his mouth. With intense effort, he fought to open his eyes. There she was. A blurry slice of Laura, bending over him, her hair haloed by a light behind her. His angel. The sad angel hed seen at the funeral. No tongue of fire on her head today. He was hallucinating. Dying, maybe. Sean. She was crying. Oh, Sean, youre back. Elliott, he whispered, finally managing to make a sound. Hes Her smile dimmed. He didnt make it, Sean. Im so sorry. Hes gone. Gone? He just came home. And hed said something important. Something Laura needed to know, but it had faded away to the edges of Seans memory. He might never remember. He took a bullet for Gary, she said. Dad walked right into that bullet, and then you took the next one. For me. For all of us. He remembered now. Elliott, heading straight into trouble instead of running away from it. Hed rescued his buddy. Gary. Like at the Pentagon. People had run into hell to rescue friends and strangers. Theyd gone in after them. Elliott had been at the front of the pack No. Elliott hadnt been at the Pentagonor the Twin Towersbut if hed been there, he would have run in the right direction. A hero. Sean closed his eyes. Fatherless. It hurt. He was still hungry, so hungry, for a father who wouldnt hurt him. Wouldnt betray him. Wouldnt disappear. His angels voice faded. Then, another nurse. He hated nurses. Always prodding and poking and talking about vital signs. He pretended not to hear her. She left. He opened his eyes again. Laura leaned over him, deep grief written all over her face. Then she smiled, the corners of her mouth wobbling up and down, up and down, and her chin quivering. He tried to breathe deeply. It hurt too much. Gary okay? Hes fine. He and Ardelle have a tough row to hoe, though. It took a moment for that to sink in. Jess and Gary. Incredible. Dale? Hes behind bars. Good. Sean fought to find the courage to speak the truth. The words came out rough and broken, the way he felt inside. Myfather murdered your father. With the pansy gun. I was stupidto let him keep it. Laura, Im so sorry. I dont think my dads sorry that he walked right into Gods arms. There really is a sweet by-and-by. Oh, I dont know what Im talking about. I only know theres a kind of love that never fails. There is, Sean managed to whisper. Her fingers ran lightly across his hand. Remember how my dad always called you son? Im sure he meant it. He still would. Sean was silent for a moment. I had something else to tell you. Cant remember. Its all right. She gave him that wobbly smile again. Kim saved your life. The doctors said she got there just in time. Mikey? He came back. That poor old cat. It wasnt his day to die. The cat lived. Gary lived. But Elliott died. For Gary, picnics and parties. For Elliott, the graveyard. The doorway to heaven. Elliott was a good man, Sean said. Youre right about that. The old lady, there. Granny Colfax. She clicked her tongue. He was a good soldier too. Sometimes soldiers give their lives for innocents. You know its Memorial Day? Why wouldnt she just go away? Theres a proverb in the Good Book, Granny continued. Goes like this. The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous. But sometimes, its the other way round. Sometimes, the righteous give themselves as ransom too. She sighed, long and loud. Nobody took his life. He gave it. He gave it. Laura, blessedly silent, bent over Sean, her hair falling like a curtain of flame. Her warm tears spilled onto his cheek, mixing with his. She smoothed his hair off his forehead and bent to kiss him. Then it came to him. The message for Laura. He told me, Sean whispered. Your dad told me why he ran. It wasntthat he stopped loving you or your mom. I know he loved me. I saw it. But her eyes were sad. Why did he run, then? The thin old voice came back to him. I couldnt trust myself not to harm a friend orthe woman I loved. He didnt trust himselfnot to harm Gary, Sean said. She drew in a long breath, her face softening, her eyes filled with tears. She didnt need to know the rest. It would be their secret, his and Elliotts. Sean mustered his strength for a few more words. And he still called you my girl to the end. With that off his chest, Sean fought to stay awake. To keep his angels face before him. To hang on to the light.          Weeks later A blue jay flew into a pine grayed by the morning mist. Sean lifted his eyes, as blue as the birds feathers, to follow its flight. Laura settled back on the damp seat of Keiths rowboat and savored the view. It was becoming a habit to slow down at random moments. To savor a little piece of life. To listen to the ripple of the water, to smell the pines. To feast her eyes on Seans living face. She shook her head. So close. Hed come so close. He regarded her with a mixture of amusement and suspicion. What? Just thinking. Just picturing a gravestone. Sean Michael Halloran, luthier, laid to rest among his moonshine-running ancestors. But hed lived. Thank God, hed lived. She clamped her lips together to keep them from trembling. No crying, he ordered with a half smile. I thought you wanted me to cry. Make up your mind. It all depends on what youre crying about. He reached into the cooler for a Cokefor breakfastand popped the top. If youre still fretting about Slattery, stop it. He eyed her over his Coke can. Its over. No blabbing. We dont need to share our information with the law. Youre only saying that because youve never had a particularly friendly relationship with law enforcement. That doesnt mean I cant think straight. What good would it do to dredge up the car? To dredge up the past? Slatterys family, whoever they are, might like to know what happened to him. He wasnt the kind of man a family could be proud of. Maybe its best if they never know. Maybe youre right. Let Slatterys sins die with him, thenwhatever they were. Let her dads sins die too. And her moms. And Garys. And the sins of selfish girls whod been too busy painting their nails to keep an eye on Tigger. Every day, the bittersweet shock hit her all over again. Cassie and Tigger were her sisters. But Gary wasjust Gary. He wasnt her father except in the biological sense, but hed been her fathers friend. Her dad had loved him to the end. Had forgiven everything. Laura gazed into the deep blue waterthe water shed once thought had swallowed her dads body. When she was twelve, another lake, a small one, had taken a little brown car and the body of its owner. Someone might find the remains one day, but she hoped it would be beyond her time. A hundred years in the future. Two hundred years. It didnt matter now; it couldnt change Slatterys fate, but she still had questions. It was June. Flowers bloomed everywhere. Soon, the purple kudzu blossoms would fill the air with their sweet, musty spice. Not long after that, the leaves would turn brown. The cold would kill the luxuriant vines and expose whatever ugliness they had been hiding. You could cover up the truth, but you couldnt change it. That was one kind of covering. There was another kind too. Love that covered a multitude of sins. All right, Laura said. Lets say nobody ever needs to know my dad engaged in some vigilante justice. Maybe even pre-emptive justice, if theres any such thing. Good. Sean tipped his Coke up for another swig. Lets say that. We cant change what happened, so well let it lie. Like well let Slatterys bones lie at the bottom of Bennetts lake. But how could my dad be sure Slattery intended to harm Tigger? I dont know. I wasnt there. Sean leaned forward. I only know your dad will be remembered for giving his life. Not for taking a life. He pointed at her. And dont feel guilty because we lived and he died. It was his choice. Like it was Dales choice to pull a gun. He lowered his finger but kept his glistening eyes on hers. She ached for him. She wasnt the only one whod loved a father and lost him. In spite of everything, Sean had never shut Dale out of his life. It still hurts, she said slowly. And I know it hurts you too. Itll hurt for a long time. All of it. But I hope you know how much he loved you. And I hope he knew how much you loved him even when you still werent entirely sure he loved you back. He smiled. Ill never forget the sight of you flying up that bank screaming Daddy like a banshee. I guess he never forgot it either. He didnt have time to. Sean was quiet for a while. Sometimes, I dont like the way God handles the details. But when I look at the big picture, I know were in good hands. A woodworkers hands. Scarred, with blood on them. But beautiful. So beautiful. Some hearts were broken by another persons sin. Some hearts were mended by another persons sacrifice. Sometimes life just didnt make sense. Ardelle was in counseling. So was Gary. Cassie, home with Drew now, kept nagging Laura to start counseling too. She probably should. Back in May, when shed sat in church smelling stale perfume and dusty hymnals, shed doubted Gods ability to run the world. Now, breathing fresh air and the sweetness of summer flowers, shed gone from death to life without quite knowing how. Sean had too. Hed never said much about it, but hed changed during those days in the hospital. He stifled a groan. Hed reached for the bait bucket too quickly. Dont move so fast, she said. Are you due for another pain pill? No, he said curtly. She hid a smile. Sean could hardly stand to let anybody look after him. His hospital stay had been pure torture for him, but far worse for his nurses. Laura, though, rather enjoyed the challenge. Here, let me bait your hook for you, she offered. He hesitated but handed over his pole. I knew there had to be some advantages to dating a tomboy. You call this a date? Yeah, and if I can make my girl fish for her own supperand even row the boat for methats better still. She reached into the bait bucket and proceeded with the job. Why do I put up with you? Because I love you and you know it. On the verge of telling him she loved him too, she hesitated, collecting her thoughts. When her dad came back, she hadnt told him she loved him. Everything had happened too fast. Shed had only a few minutes, and shed missed her chance. Her dad had said it, though. Those had been his last words, said with clear-eyed certainty just before he took a bullet for a friend. Then he was past hearing. Past seeing. Past pain. He wasmended. Sean, too, had loved her with his very life, putting his flesh and blood between her and the pansy gun. The last remnant of the Halloran inheritance. But there was a new Halloran heritage now. Kindness, honor, courage. Here. She handed his fishing pole back. Thank you. She rinsed her fingers in the lake and looked up. The sunlight made a bright path across the water, leading to the pines on the far shore where the camps early-bird chapel service was in full swing. An old hymn floated across the water, jazzed up with guitars and drums. The Doxology. Shed sung that song with her dad, years ago, during those days when hed walked her across the road to Sunday school. Hed taught her to fold her hands and pray. Shed copied him and mouthed the words of a creed she didnt quite understand. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. She would never understand any of it completely. Not this side of heaven. Sean heard the music too. He cocked his head, listening, and sang along so softly that it was barely above a whisper. Praise Him above, ye heavnly host; praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. She studied his lean, clean-shaven face and pondered what had made him the man he was. Dale Hallorans son, like it or not. Elliott Gantts protg, nearly a son. Laura Ganttsboyfriend? Again? They had never exactly defined their relationship. Just enjoyed it. As May lazed along into June and shed decided she belonged in Georgia, she and Sean had drifted into cozy companionship punctuated by occasional quarrels and frequent moments of sheer joy. Yet shed never told him she loved him. Not even when he was about to die. Why was it so hard to say? Because it meant taking the next step too. It meant believing love was stronger than fear. Stronger than hatred. Longer than time. Worth every risk. It meant accepting the sorrows of the past and giving her heart to a brand-new family with its own share of sorrows. Sean, very much alive, was looking across the water toward the camp. Hard times hadnt made him hard. Theyd made him kind. Theyd made him She blew out a puff of air, a surrender to the truth. The hard times of Seans life had made him the man she loved. Her heart soared on dreams for the future. First comes lave Sean? Her voice sounded tiny, even to her own ears. Yeah? Have I ever told you I love you? His head swiveled her way. No maam, youve always been real careful to skirt around that issue. She dabbled her fingers in the cool water. A fish splashed, close to the surface. A silver dart, full of life. She glanced over at Sean. He leaned forward. Waited. Well? he prompted, eyebrows lifting. That sarcastic tilt to his mouth, not quite a smile, was the same one shed adored practically forever. Well. She clasped her hands in her lap, dribbling lake water on her jeans. I love you. He really smiled then, the crows feet touching the corners of his eyes. I know you do. Her lips parted. Is that all youve got to say about it? His laughter echoed across the water like a song. Darlin, you know I love you too, and Id give you a big ol kiss, but wed tip the boat over. She felt a grin coming from somewhere deep inside her, from long-ago happy times with Sean, her best friend, the first boy shed ever kissed. We sure would. Just wait till were on solid ground. He winked. The wind picked up, a chilly note. Sun and wind, mingled together. Love and loss, life and death, all mixed up together. All held in good hands. She closed her eyes. The sunlight warmed her face, so much like a soft kiss that she almost thought Sean had somehow moved close without rocking the boat. No, it wasnt him. It was someone even closer. Someone who brushed her ears with old whisperings shed only begun to understand.
