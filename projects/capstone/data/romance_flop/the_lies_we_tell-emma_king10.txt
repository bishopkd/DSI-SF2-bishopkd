With someone that isnt even female.Hes a cheater and a liar.Nick gave me a skeptical look.What else could that have been?I dont know.Thats why you need to talk to him.Nick.Craig appeared, looking utterly distraught.We need to talk, man.Nick glared at him.Not now, Craig.Nick, you have to let me explain.What could you possibly need to explain?Its pretty obvious youre cheating on your wife with Brad.Nick continued to stare down his friend.Am I wrong?Craig sighed.No, youre not wrong.Im going to go back inside and let you two talk, I said, backing away slowly.Nick still looked pissed but at least he wasnt yelling anymore.Thanks.Craig shot me a grateful look.My first stop was the bar where I ordered two drinks.After finishing one right there, I took the other and found a quiet corner of the ballroom where I could watch people dance around like chickens.I was aware that some people were watching me, wondering where Nick had gone and why I was sitting in a corner drinking alone.I could practically hear the rumors swirling in the air.At least a half dozen songs played while I waited for Nick and when he finally approached my table he looked defeated.I stood up before he could speak and asked.Do you want to go?Yes, but not yet.If we leave now it might seem odd.Nick held out his hand.Dance with me?Yeah, okay.We found a relatively clear spot on the floor and Nick took the lead.He was a surprisingly smooth dancer.So how did it go?I kept my voice as low as I could while still being heard over the music.Pretty much exactly how you would expect.He admitted the whole thing.Its not like he couldve denied it.So whats the whole story?How long has it been going on?Ten years.Can you believe it?Nick scoffed.Hes been lying to me and everyone else for ten years.Why lie?Was he just afraid to come out?Craig wasnt, but Brad was.He thought it would ruin his chances of a political career.So Craig agreed to keep it on the down low.He thought that Brad would eventually come around, but once he was elected mayor and then married his wife, it was pretty clear Brad expected him to keep up the ruse.But why did Craig get married?What is the point of this whole charade?Apparently there were rumors.Nothing that was substantiated, but enough that Brad was starting get nervous.Even marrying his wife didnt seem to help so he ended the relationship.Craig was in a downward spiral when he met Carrie.She helped him put his life back together.He said that he loves her.Not romantically, but he still loves her.Does she know?I glanced over Nicks shoulder to where Carrie was dancing with her father and felt a wave of sympathy for the poor girl.Not a clue.Craig wants to keep it that way.Nick looked equally bothered by the situation.Plus apparently Craigs new marital status is a big turn on for Brad.Is it weird that the kilts ended up being the most normal part of this wedding?Nick managed a small smile.I couldve predicted that.So not that Im complaining, but how much time to we need to serve before we can leave without drawing attention?As much as I was enjoying being in Nicks arms, the wedding had become a perverse form of torture.Nick studied me carefully and his arm tightened around my waist.We should probably finish the song.We should.I ran my fingers up the back of his neck and pulled his head down, kissing him forcefully.Nick pulled back and cleared his throat.Youre right.Lets go.We were both anxious to forget everything and resume our original quest for an empty bedroom.Fortunately, back at the house we had plenty of options.The second the front door closed behind us we were on each other, kissing and grinding like horny teenagers.I stripped away Nicks jacket and tie, throwing them carelessly across the room.Nick unzipped my dress slowly and slid his fingers beneath the shoulder straps to slide it from my body.I stepped out of the silky fabric and kicked it away.We stumbled down the hall together, our bodies entwined.My room was the closest bedroom, and we burst into the room in a storm of heat and passion.Nicks hands explored my body as I pushed against him.We carried on this way for some time as he acquainted himself with my topography.He unhooked my bra and I felt a surge of heat as his mouth fastened on my breast.I slipped my hand down the fly of his pants, brushing my hand against the bulge inside.His hands went over my breasts, caressing and teasing gently, and his mouth trailed after his hands.Before I knew it, his pants and shirt were off and my panties quickly followed.This time when I reached for him, there was no fabric in the way and I was able to grab his penis firmly in my hand.He was fully erect and he moaned eagerly at my touch.Nick lifted me in his arms, our skin caressing each other teasingly, and laid me down on the bed.He hovered over me for a second and I took the opportunity to appreciate his strong, solid body.Then he lowered himself and his long, warm body pressed full length against mine as we kissed over and over in a heated frenzy.His fingers probed me, fluttering hard against my nub in a way that made me press harder against him.He stroked a finger in and out, spreading the wetness that was building inside.When he was satisfied that I was ready, Nick pulled back briefly to slip a condom into place and then looked me in the eye until I nodded.He pressed against me again, making a hungry noise as he slid inside me easily.My fingers dug hard into the muscles of his arms and he pushed as deep inside of me as he could get.Then he pulled out, nearly all the way until I let out a gasp of protest.This time he pushed hard into me and his rhythm picked up, faster and faster until I wasnt sure I could keep up.I spread my legs wider, allowing Nick to go even deeper and I could feel the climax building within.It came quickly, a sudden wave of heat and pleasure as I rippled around him.Nick had been waiting for me and with one last thrust released inside me, one violent shudder before collapsing on top of me.Neither of us moved nor spoke for a long time.Nick was heavy, but I enjoyed the feeling of his body pressing down on me.He was warm and solid and I felt safe.I ran my fingers up and down the soft skin on his back and marveled at how comfortable I felt with this man I had known for less than a week.Eventually Nick rolled off of me but he didnt go far.Propped on his side, he trailed a hand over the bare skin on my stomach.Thanks, Charley.For the sex?I laughed and poked him in the ribs.Youre welcome.No, thats not what I meant.I pretended to be offended.So the sex wasnt thanks worthy?I figured the orgasm I gave you would be thanks enough, Nick joked.What I meant to say was thanks for coming with me this weekend.I see.I turned on my side until our faces were inches apart on the pillow.I had a nice time, despite what happened at the wedding.Thanks for inviting me.So no regrets then?Nicks hand was still stroking my body and his hand was closing in on my breast.No regrets, Nick.Not with you.As our bodies came together again I knew that I was right where I was supposed to be.Sunday, October 11th The Daily Scandal Washingtons #1 Source for Breaking
