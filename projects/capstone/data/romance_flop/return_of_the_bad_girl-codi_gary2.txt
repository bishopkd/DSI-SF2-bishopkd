Neither of them said anything else, and Gabe could feel his throat start to tighten with anxiety.This was a mistake.So, what brings you to town?Chase asked finally.From what I remember, you said if you ever saw my face again, I was a dead man.He stood in the same spot, hardly moving.Better to just rip off the Band Aid.And yet, you still tried to see me.What can I say?Chase said, a wry smile twisting his mouth.Im a risk taker.Plus, I figured theyd have you in restraints.Its not like I was Hannibal Lecter, Gabe said, looking around the shop.It looks like youve done well for yourself.Im doing all right.Chase seemed to be waiting for something, and Gabe shuffled his feet, unable to meet his gaze.Look, man, Im sorry I refused your visit.I appreciate it now, but at the time, I was still pretty raw and wrong.I couldnt face you, for a lot of reasons.Chase said nothing, so Gabe added, I was all messed up.It took me several years to get my head wrapped around everything Id done, and I just need you to know ...I was a major dick.Nothing that happened was your fault.Dating my best friends sister probably wasnt the smartest move, Chase said.If I could do it over, I cant say I would have been happy about it, but I definitely wouldnt have attacked you.Or ridden my bike wasted.Still riding those testicle ticklers?Gabe choked on a laugh, easing some of the tension in his shoulders.My bike could take whatever hog you have stashed away.Chases smile was small, but it was there.Maybe there was hope for forgiveness after all.Im actually thinking about moving here.Ive been saving for years to open my own custom bike shop.Chase was silent, seeming to mull over what to say next.Why here?The question was reasonable enough, but for Gabe, the reasons behind his decision were emotional, and emotions would make him even more vulnerable in an already awkward situation.Just when it seemed like they were starting to relax around each other.The facility where Honeys staying is in Sun Valley, and this place is only two hours from her.Its centrally located between many outdoor recreation areas, which would be perfect for selling my bikes, Gabe said, fidgeting as he added, Besides, your stepdad said youd be here, and I needed to try to make amends.Aw, you came all this way for me, Chase said, jokingly clasping his hands to his chest.Be still my heart.Shut up, man, Gabe said.Chase laughed but the tone wasnt mocking.Waving his hand toward one of the chairs, he said, Well, youre here.Have a seat.Where you living, anyway?Thats currently up in the air, Gabe said, adding, Im working on it.Well, let me know when you get settled, and you can come over for dinner.Meet my wife.The word wife was so foreignespecially coming out of Chases mouththat Gabe was still having trouble believing it.Yeah, I heard you settled down.Congratulations or condolences?Congratulations, man, Chase said, his face taking on an almost dreamy quality.Katie is amazing.Youll love her.Great, Gabe said, surprised at the changes in Chase.Granted, it had been sixteen years, but still....Chase had been the guy who thought serious relationships were just short of castrating yourself.Just another reason Gabe had been sure Chase would hurt Honey.But now he was a healthy, contributing member of society, with a wife, a home, and a successful business.Everything you once imagined for yourself.So what all do you need to work out with your new place?Gabes thoughts shifted to the dark haired beauty currently making his fresh start more difficult.I have to deal with a pest problem before I move in.Four In my opinion, men and women cannot live together without at least some friction.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE WAS LYING on the couch at eight oclock, trying to go back to sleep.Between Val and Justin coming back here instead of going to his house, and Ellie sneaking in at four in the morning, only to trip over Gus, the bulldog, Caroline hadnt slept more than a few hours.The last time shed woken up, it had been to Ellies releasing a string of cursesand a mumbled apology after shed asked if Ellie was okay.Then, just as Caroline was about to drift back to sleep, Justin had come out of the bedroom with Val on his heels.After a ten minute smooch fest by the door, Justin had left, and Val had made her way back to her bedroom.Thered been no more sleeping after those disturbing noises, so Caroline had spent the last few hours debating how she was going to get into that apartment.She had a feeling Mr.Bad Ass wasnt going to give it up without a fight.If she was her fathers daughter, shed do a little digging into her competitors past.A guy like that probably had a few skeletons, some undesirable qualitiesbesides the fact that he was a snarky, chauvinistic jerkoff.Telling her to find someplace else.Calling her princess.Once upon a time, maybe, but she hadnt been pampered or sheltered since before her mother died.But that was a long time ago.That girl wouldnt have made it in the world on her own.Caroline had needed to adapt, change, and grow with every situation.But if she wasnt going to resort to dirty tactics or legal recourse now, what other options did she have?A loud knock at the front door startled her, and she jumped, nearly rolling off the couch.Dressed in a pair of boxers and a T shirt, she got up and walked to the entryway.Her hand was on the knob before another knock shook the wood.Opening the door, her mouth fell open when she found Gabe the Badass standing on her porch, looking sheepish.And hot.Cant forget hot.I take it youre surprised to see me, Gabe said, a smirk turning the corners of his mouth up in a knee weakening way that didnt affect her at all.Not one little bit.What do you want?You dropped out of charm school, didnt you?Gabe asked.When it comes to you, this is about as charming as I get, she said, resisting the urge to smooth out her messy ponytail.She didnt even want to think about what her breath smelled like.Why do you care?Its not like youre going to be kissing him.Maybe you can scare him away with your dragon breath.Fair enough, he said, and she hated that he looked so damn good in a pair of faded jeans, a cotton shirt, and a leather jacket.If it werent for the piercings, he could have been in the cast of Grease.I know we got off to a rough start You mean when you tried to steal my apartment and throw me out?Satisfaction raced through her as his jaw clenched.So she irritated him.Too bad.He irritated her, too.I meant that the confusion over the apartment caused us both to leave empty handed, he said.So what?Youve come to convince me why I should just let you have it?Actually, I was going to suggest we share it, Gabe said, the smirk back in full force as he added, if you think you can handle it.Caroline blinked at him.Please tell me youre joking.Nope.Why would I want to live with you?I cant even stand to breathe the same air as you.He shrugged.You seem like the type to get all sue crazy over something like this, so I figured Id be the bigger man and lay out a compromise.Its up to you, though.I am not sue crazy, she muttered.Whatever you say, princess.See?We cant live together.It would be a war zone, she said.Im hardly going to be there, so its not like wed have to interact, he said, holding out his fingers as he ticked them off.Since Ill be busy, it will basically be a crash pad for me, and it would only be temporary.Once another place opens up, one of us could move out.Plus, it would be cheaper to split the rent.She eyed him up and down as a voice in her head screamed that it was a crazy, stupid idea.That tattoo just above his collar continued to taunt her, and she thought she caught a flash of silver in his tongue that matched the bar going through his eyebrow.Not that she caredshe had her fair share of tatsbut she knew danger when it flashed her a charming smile.Besides, trading two noisy sisters for one potential serial killer didnt seem like the brightest idea.I cant live with a strange man who I know nothing about.You could be some kind of Dexter, and Ill come home to you dissolving bodies in the bathtub.Thats up to you, he said, shoving his hands into his pockets.But you dont have to worry about me.Im as harmless as a kitten.With that, he walked inside, brushing against heron purpose, no doubtand she ignored the tingles the close contact caused, protesting, Hey, I didnt invite you inside.And I dont usually conduct business on peoples porches.Caroline slammed the door and followed him into the kitchen.He was standing in front of an open cupboard, perusing the contents.Caroline noticed that Gus, the monster dog, was sitting at his feet, panting at him, with his massive jaws spread into a wide grin.Evil is attracted to evil, apparently.You know, illegal trespassing and breaking and entering are serious crimes.So is looting and burglary.With a long, amused look, he grabbed a package of Hostess cupcakes, and he had the nerve to laugh.The bastard.I didnt break anything, and like I said, were talking business.He ripped the package open with his teeth and took out one of the cakes, opening his mouth wide.If my sister catches you eating her cupcakes, youre a dead man, Caroline said, eyeing the sugary treats longingly.Shed sworn off sugar last month after shed stress eaten herself ten pounds heavier.Just imagining the sweet, orange frosting caused her mouth to water.Want one?he asked, holding out the package to her, tempting her.We could be criminals together.When she didnt reach for it right away, he set it on the counter and concentrated on demolishing the rest of the one in his hand, licking his fingers with quick flicks of his tongue.Yep, that tongue was definitely pierced.As he sucked the frosting off his hands, her nipples tightened, imagining the sweetness of the frosting mixed with the warm, salty taste of his skin.In her mind, she was the one licking and sucking on each long digit as her hands slid up under his T shirt, over those abs, until she found out if his nipples were also pierced.Stop it!Do not think about him like that.He is an ass!So, what do you think?His question caught her off guard.What?Wanna be my roommate?No, she said, going to the fridge for a protein shake.Suit yourself, he said.Goddamn it!Caroline heard Val scream from her room.Eleanor!A door slammed, another opened, and the screaming continued.Did you take the new Jimmy Choos I just ordered?A muffled reply that Caroline couldnt make out followed, and then, I said you were not to look at them, let alone borrow them.I havent even worn them yet!Caroline could feel the headache coming on as her sisters continued to squabble, her forehead becoming the center of the pounding pain.Those your sisters?She glanced his way and said sarcastically, Yeah, howd you guess?Gemma said you lived with your sisters when I called for your address last night, he said.So thats how hed found out where she lived.The screaming had intensified in the other room; Ellie apparently finally was awake enough to yell back at Val.Suddenly, even a homicidal roommate didnt seem like the worst thing in the world.Okay, lets just say I was interested in a temporary living arrangement, she said, rubbing her temples and forehead with her fingers.We would have to establish some ground rules.Its simple, he said, leaning back against the counter.You stay out of my business; Ill stay out of yours.We split the rent and utilities fifty fifty What about Internet or a house phone?Ive got my cell phone, so I dont need a house phone, but Ill split the Internet with you.And cable.I dont need cable.I stream off the Internet, Caroline said.With how often she moved, it was easier than getting new service every six months.Whatever floats your boat, princess, he said, and her hackles rose.And stop calling me princess, she said.Before he could answer, Caroline saw a flash of dark hair out of the corner of her eye and turned in time to see her sister Ellie slam the front door.Seconds later, Val appeared, opened the door, and yelled after her, If you ever get into my closet again, Ill rip your hair out!She shut the door with a loud bang and turned toward them.Her angry expression melted into surprise before her face flushed a deep red.Was she embarrassed that someone else had witnessed one of their family fights?Or maybe it was that it had been witnessed while she was in her underwear and a tank top.Caroline shook her head.Valerie, this is Gabe.Gabe, this is my sister.Pleasure, Gabe said.Caroline saw his mouth twitch, as if he were fighting a grin.Nice to meet you.Excuse me, Val said, running from the room.Caroline sucked down her protein shake and tossed the bottle in the garbage.So about this living arrangement ...Im in.HERE YOU GO, Gemma Bowers said with a relieved smile, handing Gabe the keys.Im really glad you were able to work something out.I am sorry this happened, and Im so embarrassed Think nothing of it, Mrs.Bowers, Gabe said, all charm.He thought he heard a gagging noise coming from Caroline, who was standing by the door.Gabe grinned.He wasnt surprised shed said yes to his proposal, not really.Over the years, he had learned a thing or two about strong, independent women, and the foremost lesson was that it was hard for them to back down from a challenge.And sure enough, this tiny brunette with attitude was no different.Plus, the last thing hed wanted was to cause a problem between Travis Bowers and his wife.Especially because Travis had gone out on a limb for him after hed come clean about his time in prison.Hed shared enough of the details to prove he wasnt a rapist or a murderer, but he hadnt bared his soul.Luckily, Travis had said it would stay between them.Hed been surprisingly cool about everything.Everyone deserves a second chance.For Gabe, it was a little hard to believe that a perfect stranger was willing to give him a clean slate, especially since so many of his friends from his past had written him off.It wasnt all their fault.Hed been angry, filled with self loathing, and jealous as hell of their futures, especially Chases.Chase had been getting out of town to go to Berkeley on a scholarship.That had been eating Gabe alive for months before hed caught Chase and Honey together.Jealousy was an ugly thing.Can I get the second set?I want to start unloading, Caroline said, right next to his shoulder now.Gemma handed over the keys, which Little Miss Attitude snatched up in a hurry.Damn, she was a brat.He watched her storm out the door, her jeans hugging her ass like they were made just for her.Gabe had to admit, if he was up for a detour on his road to redemption, the sharp tongued woman would be the perfect pit stop.Today, she looked fresh faced and sweet, except for that angry gleam in her eyes that said she definitely wasnt ready to make nice with Gemma.Or him, for that matter.Even if she had been ready and willing for a little action, he wasnt looking for anything more than someone to satisfy his needs, and he wasnt about to become fuck buddies with a woman hed be sharing a bathroom with.That scenario was just too domestic for his tastes.Even if she did have an amazing body.He followed her out the door and caught a sweet, flowery scent that told his body that finding a friend with benefits might need to happen sooner than later.Living with a woman like her, twenty four/seven, was not going to end well.He had too much work ahead of himon his new life, his shop, and repairing his friendship with Chaseto be tempted into trouble.Gabe joined her at the top of the stairs as she slipped the key in the lock.God, do you have to breathe down my neck like that?He resisted the urge to bend over and blow in her ear, just to piss her off.Are you ever pleasant, or does the Im better than you and I know it act work for some guys?he asked, following her into the apartment as she pushed the door open.So far, I havent had any complaints, she said, sarcasm oozing from every word.Probably cause theyre pussies that are scared to death youll cook and eat them, he said, ignoring her gasp behind him as he headed for the room on the left.Youre taking the bigger room?she called out after him, outrage evident in her tone.Turning at the door, he said, You can wrestle me for it if you want, princess.Ugh, why did I think this would be better than my sisters?she groaned, turning her back on him.He admired her backside again before she came back toward him with a determined, angry glint in her eye.Lets get a few things straight: this is not going to be anything but a living arrangement.Two strangers, sharing one dwelling, and nothing more.So, stay out of my room and away from me.And stop calling me princess.God, she thinks shes tough shit.Her challenge sparked something inside him, and he crossed the hallway without thinking.She backed up against the other closed bedroom door at his approach.Warm satisfaction curled through his body as he boxed her in, hovering over her with one arm against the wall.She was so tiny compared to him, but her glare was defiant as she raised that pointed little chin and met his gaze.Dipping his head a bit lower, he whispered darkly, What should I call you then?Angel?Baby?He swore he saw her shiver, even as she snapped back, My name is Caroline.It would have been so easy to lean over and see if those berry pink lips tasted as good as they looked, but instead, he pushed off the wall and away from her.Im not one of those choir boys you can push around or manipulate.Unless you want to test my patience, I suggest you stop trying to control me, Caroline.Shoving him out of her way, she headed back toward the front door.Im going to unpack my car, and then Im going to the store.Just to annoy her, he called, Great plan.I think Ill join you.We should probably take your car, though, since Ive just got my bike.Screw you.You can starve.And on that friendly note, Caroline slammed the door behind her, leaving Gabe amused and turned on, despite the warning voice in his head.Focus on what youre doing here, and forget about her.As if that were possible, when her scent still lingered throughout the room.Five Everyone has baggage.Whether or not you can leave your baggage at the door of a new relationship is up to you.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE HAD GOTTEN in and out of the grocery store without bumping into any old friends.Not that she was scared of her past.Shed made plenty of mistakes, but she was an adult now.She could take the fallout with maturity and just hope that the people she wronged would follow suit.And if that didnt work, shed just turn the other cheek.How bad could it be?Shelbys reaction to their run in yesterday was a mild version of what shed been expecting.Still, Shelby had barely begun dating Marcus Boatman when Caroline had drunkenly seduced him at a party.Considering the guys who had come before and after, there were probably a few more former girlfriends who would rather sock her than look at her.She didnt dare stop for gas at the Shell station, afraid of what Mr.Nelson would do if he saw her again.After shed made off with a six pack of beer stuffed into her jeans, jacket, and shirt, hed hung her picture in the window as a reminder that she wasnt allowed near his store.She had managed to get away only because he had been chasing one of her companions whod boosted a bottle of whiskey out the other door.Her father had swooped in to smooth things over when Mr.Nelson had called the cops.Good old Dad, always there when the family name was on the line.Back at the apartment, Caroline was glad to find Gabe gone.Gabe.She snorted.Most likely short for Gabriel, which made her think of the show Supernatural.The archangel on the show had been short and funny.Her new roommate was the polar opposite.As she put her groceries away, she thought of the way he had stepped up to her, his body so close shed felt the heat radiating off him like the sun.If it hadnt been for his expression, she might have been nervous, but he hadnt been trying to scare her.He had wanted to prove something.Caroline knew exactly what she was dealing with.He thought he was charming and was used to having women fawn all over him and probably doing anything and everything he wanted.But she wasnt one of them, and he was going to learn pretty damn quick that she played the game better than most women.At least, thats what the second stall in the Rock Canyon High School boys bathroom had said years ago.Looking around the empty apartment, she doubted Gabe the Babe Slayer had brought any decent furniture with him.Guys like him thought lawn chairs and a TV made a living space.It was still early, not quite noon, so she decided to make the forty five minute trip up to Twin Falls.A few hours later, although it had taken a good chunk out of her savings, she left with a promise of next day delivery on everything, including her brand new bed.When Caroline pulled into the alleyway, she saw that Gabes bike was parked in the spot again.Youre going to have to explain to him that the spot is yours, and he can park that stupid tricycle somewhere else.She swung back onto Main Street and parked in front of Gemmas shop.Caroline got out of her car and walked past the front window of Chloes Book Nook, catching the friendly wave from Gemma.Caroline waved back.Although she was still perturbed at the pretty bookstore owner, she didnt want the drama to continue.She had enough of that from outside sources.As she headed back down the alley, she saw the back of her sisters dark head sitting on the third step of the staircase leading to her new place.That morning, Caroline had knocked on Vals bathroom door to let her know that shed decided to take the apartment, not bothering to mention that Gabe would be sharing it.Luckily, shed caught Val midshampoo, so they hadnt had a chance to have a long conversation.Her sister had already protested her moving out.Just give me a day or so, and Ill send Ellie packing back to Dads.You dont have to go.Caroline hadnt had the heart to tell her it wasnt just that she needed space from Ellie, Gus, or the dreaded lumpy couch.As she stopped at the bottom of the staircase, she saw that Val had her missing cell phone in her hands.I see you finally got my phone back from that demon you call a dog.Hello to you too, Val said, brushing her short bangs off her forehead.Although Caroline wasnt a fan of short hair, she had to admit the new cut looked good with her sisters delicate features and big brown eyestheir mothers eyes.Caroline had been blessed with the same eyes, but with her rounder face, they didnt stand out as much.She held out her hand for the phone and noticed the bite marks in the rubber case.Luckily, the canines massive jaws hadnt cracked the screen.Sorry, but that dog is evil.No, he just likes you.A lot, Val said, grinning.So, are you going to show me your new place or what?Sure, but theres not much in there.Ive got furniture scheduled to be delivered tomorrow.Caroline climbed past her sister as she stood up.Thats fine.I thought Id drop the phone off when I found it, but if you dont want me to see your place ...Oh, will you knock it off?Caroline said as she put the key in the door.I was just sharing pertinent information.Stop acting like a brat.Im not a brat, Val snapped behind her, and Carolines insides warmed with happiness.It hadnt taken them long to fall back into their old roles, and it made Caroline glad that Val didnt really hold a grudge against her for leaving.One less person hating her guts was a plus in Carolines life.Unlocking the door and stepping inside, she held her arm out.Mi casa es su casa.Val stepped past her and looked around the empty rooms.I cant believe you dont have any furniture.Caroline shrugged as she shut the door.It made it easier to drop everything at a moments notice and move on.Hmmm ...so, who was that guy this morning?Well, that took a lot longer than expected.If Caroline had walked into the kitchen in her skivvies and encountered a strange man, she would have asked then and there instead of running away to put clothes on.My new roommate.Remember how I showed up to get my keys and found out that some wires got crossed?Travis rented it to Gabe, the guy from this morning Wait, the douche with the crotch rocket is the same gorgeous man who was leaning against my sink, looking like sex on a fucking stick?Caroline rolled her eyes.Yes, but Is that whos in your shower?Val asked.Caroline had been so tuned in to her sisters reaction that she hadnt even heard the shower running.Must be.Well, I cant wait to officially meet him.What changed, by the way?Yesterday you were ranting and raving, and now youre sharing a bathroom.So, whats he really like?Arrogant.Bossy.Hot.Hes just a guy.I havent even really talked to him, besides the initial argument about who this place belongs to and what our living situation is going to be like.Im surprised you didnt run him out of here with an icy glare.I tried.Seems I might be losing my touch.Theres never been a man you couldnt charm or chase off if you put your right mind to it, Val said, chuckling.Except for Daddy ...That last fight with her father before shed left, when shed fought so hard to go to San Diego for a fresh start, had been a total surprise to her.Shed never thought her father would deny her the college of her choice.Im not paying for you to go to a known party school two states away so you can squander my money and flunk out.Boise State is a perfectly acceptable school.It hadnt been about the parties or the beach.Shed wanted to get away from her past and never come back.She couldnt go to Boise State, not when Kyle was there.She couldnt take the chance that shed bump into him and have to deal with his knowing sneer.She tried everything, from begging to bartering, before finally delivering an ultimatum.If you dont let me go, Ill walk out that door and do it on my own.I will figure it out.Shed been bluffing, of course, hoping hed change his mind to keep her in his life, but shed overestimated her fathers fondness for her.This is my house, and you will follow the rules or you will get out.And there are no second chances, Caroline.If you leave, youll stay gone.So shed gone.A scared seventeen year old whose bravado had backed her into a corner.Shed called Val to beg her for some money and a bag of clothes, just so she wouldnt have to face their father again.Val had made her promise to call, but the calls home became fewer and farther between, partly because she had one of those pay as you go phones for a while, and most of the time, she couldnt pay.The other reason was because every time she heard her sisters voice or listened to her complaints, Caroline wanted to beg her father to take her back.Especially on the nights when shed gone to bed hungry.But at the time, shed been too stubborn to give up and admit that he might have been right, that she couldnt make it on her own.Like father, like daughter.I think the water turned off, Val hissed, drawing Caroline out of the past and into an entirely new and dangerous train of thought.Thinking about Gabe in the shower, water trailing down that brown skin, caused her nipples to tighten.Damn, she wished she would stop imagining what the jerk looked like without his clothes on.Suddenly, the bathroom door opened and out stepped Gabe, a blue towel wrapped around his hips.Carolines heart stopped along with her breathing for half a second and then kicked back into high gear.His chest looked even better out of a T shirt, and the tattoos intermingling along the muscles of his arms drew her gaze all the way up to those wide shoulders.Some of the designs were hard to make out, just swirls of color and black, but the one on his neck looked tribal.She scanned down over the top of his towel and a tiny, evil part of her wished it would fall open so she could see the rest of him.Sorry.Didnt realize you were here.His deep voice jerked her eyes back up to meet his amused gaze.Damn it, she didnt want to be flustered by him or his abs.Hey, Im Carolines sister, Valerie.You might remember me as the screeching, half naked lunatic from this morning, Val said, her brown eyes twinkling.Youre Gabe?Caroline heard the tone of her sisters inquiry, as if she had told Val so much about him, and she gave Val a dark look.Val ignored her and slid her gaze up and down.You werent at all what I was expecting.Gabe grinned as he took the hand Val held out, and Caroline got a closer look at his tattoos.The one that drew her attention first was the barbed wire wrapped around his bicep, a clich that still looked massively sexy on him.Stop thinking about how sexy he is!But the barbed wire continued down, wrapping around his whole arm like a rope until it stopped at his wrist, and she saw the red drop on the back of his wrist.As if the tattoo had pierced his skin.Within the loops of the tattoo were smaller colored images, but she didnt have a chance to study them further before he pulled his arm back.Really?You werent expecting a man in a towel?Gabe asked Val, glancing at Caroline with his eyebrow raised.Then what were you expecting?Definitely not you, Val said.She is just messing with you, Caroline snapped when Gabes gaze drifted back to Val.I just said you were my new roommate.She didnt like the way his face softened as he checked out her beautiful, petite sister.Like he was wondering what shed be like in bed.Why do you care?Because Val has no business flirting when she has a serious boyfriend.Right.Even the voice in her head was condescending.Awesome.Its true; she did just say you were her roommate.I was the one who brought up your hotness, Val said, smirking.Could you plead justifiable homicide if you strangled her?Well, thanks, Gabe said, that small, arrogant smile in place, the one hed given Caroline the first time theyd met and was getting on her last nerve.Shes got a boyfriend, Caroline said abruptly, and her cheeks warmed with a blush when the two of them turned to look at her, one amused, one exasperated.Thanks, Caroline, for making a friendly introduction awkward as hell, Val snapped.First of all, you were flirting, Caroline said, ignoring Vals attempt to protest.Im just letting him know, in case he had any ideas.I was just being polite, he said.Polite, my ass.Her boyfriend is also a former marine, Caroline added, wishing her brain could override her mouth.The arrogant ass probably thought she was jealous or something.Which she wasnt.At all.Both of my sisters are off limits, regardless.Gabe ran his free hand over his strip of hair, as the other held onto the top of his towel.Got it.Youll have to introduce me to the other one so Ill know who to stay away from.Nodding at Val, he said, It was nice meeting you.Likewise, Val said as he turned and went into his bedroom.When they were alone, Val laughed.You are in so much trouble.No, Im not, Caroline argued.Are you kidding me?He is H A W T.  Im going to tell Justin.No, you wont, and besides, Im just making an observation.I love Justin, and I know hes it for me.Carolines chest tightened.She was so happy that her sister had found love after everything their father had done to keep Val and Justin apart.Val deserved it.Just then, she thought of something.That reminds me, I was hoping I could stay at your house one more night.My bed comes tomorrow, and as uncomfortable as your couch is, its better than the floor.Unless youre going to be with your man, in which case I am stealing your bed.Val looked sheepish.Im sure he wouldnt mind if I came over tonight.Good, then can we get out of here?I want to avoid run ins with my unwanted roommate as much as possible.Sure you do.Caroline wasnt amused.Six If one person says it, its a rumor.If two people say it, its gospel.Miss Know It All   YOURE LIVING WITH Caroline Willis?Gabes beer stopped inches from his mouth when he caught the look on Katie Trepassos face.It was as if hed just told her hed decided to go on a homicidal rampage.Yeah.Something I should know?Katies big blue eyes swallowed up her face as she cleared her throat and got up from the patio table.Nope.Im just surprised.She just got back and everything.I figured shed be staying with her sister.And before he could ask her anything else, she high tailed it into the house.Giving Chase a questioning look, Gabe waited for an explanation.Dont ask me.Ive lived here over a year and never heard of her.Gabe let it go and looked out over the flat farmland behind Chases white house, searching for something to say.Things had been tense between the two of them since hed arrived for dinner half an hour ago.He knew he had a lot to make up for, but he hated that it was so hard.So awkward.The elephant in the room loomed over them both, but neither wanted to talk about it.Katie came back outside then, carrying a platter of chips and salsa and another beer for Chase.Setting down the platter, she handed him the bottle over his shoulder.Here ya go.Aw, thank you, beer wench, Chase said, looking up at her with a wide grin.She reached over his shoulder to slap his chest, and he grabbed her hand, pulling her forward.When her head was almost on his chest, Chase turned his head to kiss her.Gabe looked away.Hed never been comfortable with public displays and such.Of course, the last woman hed ever been with long enough to get like that had been Cherise, but that hadnt lasted much longer than it had taken him to get back on his feet after being released.Cherise had been one of those women who liked to take care of people, to fix them.When shed realized he didnt want or need her help, shed lost interest in him.It was nothing to break his heart over.Not that he had been looking for the white picket fence, the sweet wife, or the handful of kids since he got out.Things that everyday Joesand now, even Chasehad just werent in the cards for him after what hed done.Hed lost any chance he had at having a normal life the minute hed driven his bike that night.So, Gabe, Chase said you want to open a custom motorcycle shop?I said bike, Chase said, pulling Katie down onto his lap, despite her yelp of protest.But you hate that word, Katie argued.When you talk about my baby, yes, but were talking about his.Gabe laughed while Katie rolled her eyes.I was actually hoping your husband might want to stop in a few days a week and help out with some of the artwork.He designed the emblem on the first bike I built from scratch.How old were you?Katie asked, leaning across Chase to snag a chip.Gabe didnt miss the shadow that passed over Chases face.Seventeen.Seventeen.Theyd been seniors and best friends, getting into trouble and partying together.Only ...the last few months of high school had tested their tight bond.All Gabe had been able to think about was how Chase was getting out, but he was going to be stuck there, working for the local mechanic, with nothing but a small town future ahead of him.Something he could only dream about now, but at the time, hed envied Chase so much that his jealousy had started to consume him.And then hed caught Chase kissing his baby sister, and hed lost it.How could Chase make the moves on Honey when he was just going to take off and leave her?Like he was leaving Gabe.Hed been a fucking idiot.The scene still played through his head like it was yesterday, even though sixteen years had passed.Come on, man, Im sorry, Chase had said, stepping back from Honey, his hands in the air.Gabe had been too drunk to care that Chase was his best friend; hed just been kissing his sister.His sister, who was only a sophomore.She was smart, talented, and deserved more than a guy who was just going to take advantage and then leave her behind when he took off.The bastard had to pay.Fuck your sorry, Gabe had roared, charging Chase and knocking him to the ground.Sitting on his chest, Gabe had thrown punch after punch until his sister had jumped on his back, screaming in his ear, Stop, Gabe!I like him!Hed climbed off Chase and grabbed Honeys arm, dragging her to his motorcycle.Chase had yelled at him, tried to stop him from driving, but he hadnt listened.It was no wonder Chase was reluctant to accept his apology, even now.The day after the accident, Gabe had woken up in the hospital, handcuffed to the bed.Chase had been sitting in the corner.What happened?Where am I?Chase had stood up grimly.Youre in the hospital.You wrecked your bike last night and broke your arm.Dread had pumped through him as hed tried to remember, to shake the clouds from his brain.His bike, Honey flying through the air ...Wheres Honey?Chases expression had darkened.She was stable and talking when they brought her in, but then she started seizing.They missed a bleed on her scans, and her brain swelled.They took her back up to surgery and put in a shunt to drain it, but they arent sure if shell wake up.And if she does ...If she does, what?Gabe had shouted.She probably wont be the same girl.Gabe had gone berserk, throwing whatever he could reach until nurses had come in and sedated him.Hed cursed Chase, blaming him, and Chase had left.Only none of it had been Chases fault.It was his.Maybe moving here had been a mistake.It seemed like any time he was around Chase, memories flooded up and crashed over him.Trying to change the subject, Gabe asked, So, Katie, why did you freak out when you heard I was rooming with Caroline?Katie blushed.Its nothing, really You might as well give up, Chase said.My wife doesnt like to gossip.Its not gossiping; its sharing intel, Gabe said, relieved when Chase grinned.If he could just break down this wall between them, he could start mending the rift.And then, maybe, they could be real friends again.Katie opened her mouth, probably to shoot him down, but then Chase said, Dont you think he should know what kind of character hes living with?Her cheeks flushed, and she slid off of Chases lap into her own chair.Caroline and I went to school together and would have graduated the same year, but she took off and left town.Nobody really knows why, except that she had a falling out with her father just before.Gabe didnt get why that alone would make Katie look like she was going to shit her pants.Theres got to be more to it than that.Sighing, she continued.She just had kind of a wild reputation in high school.Oooooh, a reputation, Chase teased, and Katie smacked at him.What kind of reputation?Gabe asked.With parties andKatie paused, looking very uncomfortableguys.Gabe sat back in his chair with a smile.So?Nothing.I just remember rumors flying a lot where she was concerned and was surprised when you said you were living together, Katie said, adding, I just kind of got the impression you were trying to fly under the radar.Ah, so Chase has told her about your past.Why wouldnt Chase tell his wife who was coming to dinner?She deserved to know, and the fact that shed been warm and welcoming made him like her even more.Chase was right about his wife.She was special.I am trying to keep a low profile, but I also miscalculated my expenses, and she was there, willing to pay half the rent.I just couldnt pass it up.I understand, Katie said.So, was she as notorious as her little sister is now?Chase asked, popping a chip into his mouth.Valerie?Gabe said.You met Valerie?Katie asked.Yeah, she came by the apartment earlier.No, not Valerie.Ellie, the youngest.Shes ...what?Chase paused, turning to his wife.Twenty one?Yes.So, whats this girl done?Screw the football team?Gabe joked.Probably, but her latest stunt Its not nice to gossip, Chase Trepasso, Katie teased, her blue eyes sparkling.Im just sharing intel.Gabe waited for Chase to continue and finally prodded, Come on, man.Dont leave me hanging.She was screwing the Thompson brothers, and when one caught her with the other, they started fighting.They plowed through a wall and almost took down the whole barn.I heard from one of my clients that Mr.Thompson was going to sue Ellies dad for damages.I didnt hear that.Who told you?Katie asked.Chase pretended he was buttoning his lips.I cannot reveal my sources.While Katie tried to get the truth from Chase, Gabe couldnt stop his mind from mulling over what kind of dirty deeds his uptight roomie might have committed in high school.Had she been wild like her sister?Hed known from their first meeting that she wasnt a straight laced goody goody, but she was so uptight, he had a hard time imagining her cutting loose and wreaking havoc.Whatever it is, its in the past.Dont dig at hers, and she wont dig at yours.What did you think about her, Gabe?Katies question broke into his thoughts.Sorry, what?What was your impression of Caroline?That she would look great on her back, lying across your bed.Just that shes stubborn, angry, and probably going to be a giant pain in the ass.They both laughed, and Katie patted his hand.Dont let her get to you.Remember, its only a temporary arrangement.Gabe appreciated the encouragement, but it was hard not to react to Caroline, especially when she got all bossy.Man, was she hot with her eyes flashing and that long dark hair falling around her shoulders.She was definitely the type of woman men chased after.But not me.Seven The Spice Girls once sang, Friendship never ends.Apparently, theyd never fallen for the same guy.Or seen the movie Heathers.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE WAS CURLED up on her new couch the next day, running her hand over the soft leathery fabric.Shed spent one last night at her sisters house, only to be woken at two in the morning by Ellie and a few of her friends raucous laughter.It had gone on so late that Caroline hadnt fallen back asleep until six oclock and almost missed her alarm to let the movers in.When shed arrived at the apartment, Gabe was gone, but the truck had arrived right on time.Looking around the blank walls, she thought about checking out the thrift stores and maybe even an art studio.It would be nice to bring in some artwork to match the colors in the coffee table and the rest of the furniture.Shed already picked up sheets for her new bed and some other things at Target, and after unpacking her meager belongings into her new dresser drawers, she was eager to get out and do something.What she should be doing was promoting the consulting business she was trying to get off the ground.Shed already been getting plenty of interest onlineespecially from several bars in Chicago and New Yorkbut she also wanted to work locally, which meant hitting up the local bars and pitching her abilities.After a brief shower, she threw on a tunic sweater and a pair of comfy jeans with her tennis shoes.It was April in Idaho, and the weather was unpredictable; by the looks of the dark clouds rolling in, she assumed rain was coming their way.She grabbed her business card holder, figuring shed stop off at Hanks Barsince it was right on the Main Streetbefore she shopped for dcor.She stopped by Chloes Book Nook first, pasting a pleasant smile on her face.She definitely wasnt over the mistake Gemma and her husband had made, but she was in such a good mood, she was willing to overlook it.The bell over the door dinged as she entered, and Gemma stopped talking to another woman to glance her way, blinking behind a pair of black framed glasses.Hey, Caroline.How are you?Fine.Just stopping in to see what youve got, Caroline said, smiling at the other woman.Hey, Im Caroline Willis.The woman brushed dishwater blonde hair out of her face, the wild ringlets a hair dressers nightmare.She took Carolines hand and said softly, Im Callie Jacobsen.I host the morning show down at the local radio station.Kat Country.Suddenly, the woman was a hell of a lot more interesting, and Caroline beamed.Awesome.
