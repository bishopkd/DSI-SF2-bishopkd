Im pleased for you, Mags.For you, for Fletch, for Dottie.Theyre great people.Theyll be happy together.Yes, I think they will.I still havent had time to really wrap my head around the whole idea of them as a couple.And I dont know how I was so blind.She slapped her forehead.I never saw it coming.Things sneak up on us sometimes.They do.Between Maverick Junction and Lone Tree, the Sullivans have about cornered the good news market.She looked at Mel.And you can quote me on that, Mr.Newspaper Editor.You bet.Mel saluted.When do you leave?In two weeks.She reached for the door.Have dinner with me tonight, Brawley blurted.She looked down at the floor.I cant.Cant or wont?Does it matter?She met his gaze.Yes, actually, it does.A muscle worked in his jaw.It did matter to him.A whole hell of a lot.I wont.Those two words, delivered so succinctly, sucker punched him.Still, he tried.Maggie, all that was a long time ago.Yes.It was.And I need to keep it that way.She closed the door quietly behind her.Yep, hed been right.Hed waited too long to come home.Five  They want to do what?Phone to her ear, Maggie dropped the sweater shed been folding onto the display table and collapsed into a chair.Mom, thats not possible.Todays Tuesday.Her mothers sigh made it clear shed get no argument from her.Theyre dead set on it, Maggie.Come hell or high water, Fletch and Dottie intend to get married this Saturday in her garden.Lacey and Wes are flying in Friday with their families.Where will they stay?With Dottie.She insists shes got plenty of room.Can you meet us this afternoon?Maggie ran a mental scan of her days schedule.Todays tough.Ella McCormacks coming in for an interview at two, and Im expecting a shipment later this afternoon.I really cant promise to be there before six, Mom.Thatll work.Ill call Dottie.Plan on dinner here.Ill fix something girlie for us.Your dad can eat at the caf or at Bubbas again.Sounds good.Maggie took another peek at the clock, trying to decide which of todays have to dos could wait till tomorrow.When you talk to Dottie, tell her Ill pick her up.No sense both of us driving.Maggie stomped on the little voice that wondered if Brawley might be hanging around when she stopped at Dotties.Not wondered, she corrected.Worried.Because she did not want to see him.Sophie and Annie would probably love to help, Maggie added.Good idea.With both of them recent brides, theyll be up on all the latest, no doubt have some great ideas.Will you check with them?I can do that.She moved behind the counter and picked up a Town and Country Weddings magazine a client had left behind.She tucked it into her purse.It might come in handy.Good.Ill make extra foodnot that either of them eats enough to keep a sparrow alive.After a slight pause, her mom said, Ella McCormack.Tunneys widow?Yes.Fate sure dealt those two a cruel hand.So young.I know.She called me first thing this morning to ask if the job was still open.To be honest, and shame on me, I was a little hesitant to even interview her.Why?Shes a single mom with two kids.And before you nag me about how unfair that is, Ill admit youre right.But its not like Im hiring somebody to fill in a few hours once in a while.Ill be halfway across the country, so I need someone I can count on.Every single day.Ill be here, honey.I can always take over in a pinch.I appreciate that, Mom, but you shouldnt have to.Anyway, I thought about it some more.Both Ellas kids are in school.Her mother in law lives in town and has offered to watch Benjy and Sadie after school.The bus will drop them off at her place till Ella closes up, so that part should be okay.I hope it works, her mom said.With two children, Im sure Ella can use both the extra money and a little adult socialization.Besides, itll give the kids some grandma time.Thats important.Even though they all live in Lone Tree, Im sure Tunneys mom worries about losing touch with them now that hes gone.A few minutes later, Maggie hung up and sent texts to Annie and Sophie.Pops & D 2 marry this wkend.Yikes!Can u help?Tonite @ Moms.6:00.Dinner included.She hoped they could both make it.The extra hands would be welcome.Less than four days to plan and execute a wedding?By itself, nearly impossible.On top of everything else she needed to do before leaving?Oh, boy.Overwhelming.Maybe she needed to think of it in terms of the old joke about how to eat an elephant.One bite at a time.Somehow or other, it would all get done.Standing at her shops display window, Maggie looked out over Lone Trees main street.So much was changing so quickly.Fingering her pretty lace curtains, she wondered if she was truly ready.She had a good life here.Was happy.Would she ever again stand here all alone in her pretty little shop, her family and friends close?Her workroom in the back had provided a haven.She could hide there with her beautiful fabrics, and with pencil, paper, scissors, and sewing machine, bring her ideas to life.Could she turn all this over to Ella McCormack, or anyone else for that matter?And home.Once Pops and Dottie got married Well, she couldnt even begin to imagine it.Maggie and her grandfather enjoyed each others company.Theyd settled into a routine.She liked living with him.Liked the familiarity of the house shed romped in as a child.That would change after this weekend.Fleetingly, she wondered where theyd decide to live.Which house theyd eventually choose.She smiled, imagining Pops living in Dotties Candy Landpink house.That should be interesting.But, then, she wouldnt be here to watch, would she?It had been her decision to follow her dreams.Her decision to leave all this, all the people she loved, life as she knew it, to go to New York.And while it was exciting, it loomed over her as more than a little frightening.A dose of the old be careful what you wish for?It felt a little like jumping off a cliff without a parachute.Thrilling?Yes.And more than a little dangerous.Still holding her phone, she called Pops and filled him in on her mothers plans.So youre on your own for dinner.Think I can manage to feed myself, girl.You have fun and help Dottie.The womans a nervous wreck over this.You two didnt give us much time to pull everything together, Pops.Be plenty of time if you females could keep things simple.Dont see why there has to be such a fuss.Be a heck of a lot easier to give Father Tom a call and have him meet us at the house.He pronounces us man and wife, then we all run down to Sallys and grab some lunch.Maggie laughed.Boy, arent you the romantic?I can be.When the situation warrants it.Got the woman to say yes, didnt I?You sure did.I love you, Pops, and it appears Dottie does, too.I still cant believe I missed all the signs.Its cause youre busy.Guess so.Guilt dropped over her.Was she really that wrapped up in herself that shed missed something so big, so momentous?However, Pops, as much as we all love you, your plan wont wash.He harrumphed.Silly to waste time and money on all this foolishness.Dottie wants it.So shell get it, he conceded, his voice softening.Yes, she would, Maggie thought as she ended the call.Between friends and family, theyd make Saturdays wedding special.And she could add to it by creating the perfect dress for Dottie.Something light and floaty, something exactly right for a garden wedding.Ideas chasing each other through her head, she grabbed a pencil and her sketch pad.As the design began to take form, she grinned and lost herself in what she loved to do.The dress would have to be pink, of course.A soft petal pink.Maybe a matching tie for Pops.Oh, yeah.She could do this.In between customers, she tweaked the design, then sketched a second to give Dottie a choice.Still, she really hoped Dottie would go with the first.Fortunately shed thrown a salad together before she left the house this morning.Digging it out of her small back room fridge, she munched on it while she made lists of all the things she needed to do this week.Dotties son would walk her down the aisle, and Maggies dad had been tapped as best man.Maybe shed make them matching ties as well.If they survived the pre wedding madness, Saturday should be fun.When the bell over the door jangled, she glanced up, her shop owners smile on her face.Ella McCormack walked in, and Maggie knew instinctively she was the one.Casual elegance with an air of competence and self assurance but without any of the arrogance that sometimes accompanied that demeanor.In slim navy pants and a white top, her blond hair pulled back in a sleek ponytail, Ella looked the consummate professional.Maggie preferred bold color choices for herself, but Ella would serve as the perfect backdrop for the stores merchandise.The two had met before but theyd never exchanged much more than the polite talk between strangers.Maggie fixed them each a cup of coffee, and they sat in the shops deep armchairs.Simpatico, Maggie realized.Ella was made for this job.At thirty eight, she brought a certain maturity with her that put to rest Maggies fears.Her chest tightened.This was a big step.She would be entrusting everything shed worked so hard to build to Ella.Putting it all in her hands.Understanding that, Ella offered to stay for the rest of the afternoon.Kind of a trial by fire.If you dont like the way I interact with customers, just say the word and I leave.No harm, no foul, and no hard feelings, she promised.I have no doubt youll be wonderful with them, Maggie said.But it would be great if you could stay, since our biggest problem is time.We only have two weeks before I leave, so the sooner you start learning the ropes, the better.There are supplies to order, books to keep.Stock to rotate.So many details.My mom has offered to help in a pinch if you need her.So Im hired?You are.Ellas eyes closed fleetingly.When she opened them, they were filled with emotion.Thank you.I wont let you down.She took a deep breath.You must be so excited.I am.Maggie grinned.And more than a bit nervous.Ive never, ever lived anywhere except the Texas hill country.I grew up in Maverick Junction, then moved here to Lone Tree to live with my grandfather.After your grandma passed away.Maggie nodded.Trudy was a wonderful woman.She baked the most incredible chocolate pies.At Maggies startled expression, Ella laughed softly.Tunney and I went to the same church as your grandparents.Once in a while, shed bring one of her pies for bazaars and such.While they talked, they folded stock and rearranged racks.They worked well together.When customers came in, Maggie introduced them to Ella, then stepped back, only offering help when needed.Ella proved a quick study.Shed do well.Maggie was both relieved and saddened.Today marked an end as well as a beginning.Locking up that afternoon, she waved good bye to Ella and stood in the door watching as she headed off to pick up her kids.Maggie decided against running home to change.Her aqua linen slacks and print top would be fine.The shoes would go, though, as soon as she hit her mothers front door.Shed spent a lot of the day on her feet.Her mind was a disaster.Too much thinking, too much rolling things around in her head, which was beginning to ache.Once in her car, she popped a couple aspirin, slid a country western CD in the player, and cranked up the volume.She opened the sunroof and relished the play of fresh air over her.Singing along with Tim McGraw, she drove to Maverick Junction in record time.Turning into Dotties, she saw the kitchen light on.God, after this weekend, this would be her step grandmothers house.How strange was that?An image of Vivi, Cashs twenty eight year old scheming step grandmother, flashed through her mind, and she thanked God Fletch had more sense than to get mixed up with someone like that.She walked up to the house, but before she even had time to knock, Dottie called for her to come in.Maggie stepped into the pink on pink kitchen and there sat Brawley at the counter, dunking one of Dotties famous chocolate chip cookies into a big glass of milk.Hey, Red.Hey, yourself.Do us all a favor and pull up a stool.These cookieshe held up what remained of the one in his handcant be beat.Theyll wipe that frown off your face.Im not frowning.Yes, you are.She made an exasperated sound, then decided not to give him the satisfaction of an argument.I totally agree about the cookies, but I really dont have time.I have somewhere I have to be.Dottie does, too, so youll need to run along now.Surprise registered on Dotties face, and Maggie felt a flush of embarrassment.Yes, shed been rude, but damned if shed apologize.Brawley had a way of bringing out the worst in her, and she suspected a lot of it was intentional.He has time to finish, honey, while I freshen up and grab my purse.Maggie threw her a forced smile.Great.The instant Dottie rounded the corner, Brawley grabbed her hand and gave it a good tug.She gasped and found herself sitting on the stool beside him.No need to get all wound up, Mags.He dunked his cookie again.Instead of popping it into his mouth, he held it up to hers.Surprising herself, she opened her mouth, took a bite, and closed her eyes.Oh, yeah.Dottie baked the best cookies this side of the Mississippi.Want more?Her eyes flew open.Brawley had moved in, his lips only a few inches from hers.She swallowed.Go away, Brawley.Not gonna happen, sugar.Dont call me that.Youd prefer vinegar, maybe?Might actually suit your disposition better.Ill tell you what Id prefer.You Okay, sweetheart, Im ready.Dottie bustled into the kitchen, purse strap over her arm.When Brawley started to rise, she waved him back into his seat.Dont.Youre fine.Stay as long as you want and eat as many of those as youd like.She nodded toward the plate of cookies.When youre done, just turn the lock and pull the door shut.I have my key.Is your porch light on?he asked.Yes, dear.She kissed his cheek.Its so nice having you here.Not everybody agrees with that.He eyed Maggie.Running a hand over her already immaculate cloud of white hair, Dottie chuckled.Dont you worry that handsome head of yours.Everything will work out as its meant to.She opened the door and stepped outside.Behind her, Maggie turned to Brawley and impishly stuck out her tongue.When his mouth dropped open, she grinned.Who said you always had to behave like an adult?But when he stood and took a step toward her, she threw the fight without raising a hand.Hurrying out the door, she tugged it shut.Brawley leaned against the kitchen sink and watched her stroll down the drive in those sexy as hell shoes.That bluish green outfit, with her hair and eyes?Incredible.As good as Dotties cookies tasted, it was Maggie, always Maggie, who made him salivate.She affected him on some deep down level.The woman exuded sex appeal.She didnt dress in overtly sexy clothes.Didnt tease.But oh, boy.Maggie Sullivan was some kind of beautiful.And his memories didnt help.Not one bit.He remembered the taste of her.The softness of an eighteen year old Maggie wrapped around him.How it felt to bury himself deep inside her.What would this older, even sexier Maggie feel like?He slapped a hand on the counter.Hed so screwed up.Young and dumb.Then pride had stepped in and kept him from fixing things.Stupid, stupid, stupid.Hed never meant for their separation to be permanent.Had assumedwhat?That shed be here waiting?Hed told her not to do that.And for once shed listened to him.Damn it all to hell.Hed come home to stayto make a homewith her.And now she wanted to leave.Well, he couldnt hang out here mooning over her.Dottie said Sophie and Annie were meeting with Maggie and Rita tonight, which meant Ty and Cash would be free to help him get his project started.Ty would have the kids, but that was okay.Jesse, Jonah, and Josh.The Triple Threat.His friend had done a hell of a good job with the boys.Had to have been a hard road to hoe, what with Julia dying right after the triplets birth.Then, this last year hed met Sophie.Shed embraced the boys the way the parched earth did rain on a hot summers day.Living on a Texas ranch still posed a big challenge to the city girl, but he gave her credit.No quitter there.She was gaining ground.Hopefully, Ty could toss the kids into the van, and they could all meet at the clinic for pizza, then start tearing down walls.The kids should get a real kick out of that.Hell, Cash could even bring Staubach, his ugly, loveable mutt.The more, the merrier.Six  Brawley flustered her.As Maggie drove to her parents house, Dottie chatted happily about food and flowers.When she asked a question, Maggie blinked.Im sorry.What?I asked if you knew Ollie offered to provide sweet tea and coffee for the reception.No, I didnt.But it sounds like him.Hes quite a guy.Ashamed of herself, Maggie forced her mind back to her grandfathers bride to be and swore not to do or say anything to ruin this evening.Theyd have fun tonight.That meant pushing the dark, broody veterinarian from her mind.She tooted the horn when she pulled up to her parents house.Her mother, bless her, had a pitcher of sangria chilling in the fridge and poured her a glass the minute she walked in.And sitting at the dining room table?Annie and Sophie.Yes, the night would be fun!You beat us, she said.Annie nodded.The men decided to go into town, so I rode to Sophies with Cash.He hooked a ride from there with her guys in their van.What are they up to?Knocking down walls.Maggie frowned.At the clinic, Sophie said.After tonight Ill probably have to keep anything resembling a hammer out of the boys reach.Maggie laughed.If anyone can keep them from tearing down the ranch, you can.You ride herd on those triplets like no one Ive ever seenand they love it.Sophie smiled.So do I.  I thank God every day Annie ended up in Maverick Junction when she ran away.I didnt run away.Sure you did.For a good reason.Still She shrugged.Her mom held up the pitcher.Ladies?Im driving, and Ive been up since early this morning, so I think Ill pass, Annie said.Maybe a decaf soda?Im not driving, Sophie said.Bring it on.Drinks in hand, a tray of appetizers within reach, they settled down to business.Maggie studied the two cousins, their heads bent over a magazine.So very different.Annie, her long dark hair scraped back in a ponytail, wore faded denims and an incredible blue T shirt that set off those ice blue eyes.Sophie resembled a fairy straight out of a little girls storybook, her pale blond hair a little longer than when shed come to Maverick Junction, her brown eyes huge.Both had overflowing idea folders from their weddings.They dug into them, chatting a mile a minute, and pictures and clippings soon littered the table.Dottie insisted the day be kept easy and informal.You dont want to be rushing around on your special day, Annie said.Delegate as much as possible.Just because its at your home doesnt mean you have to do everything yourself.And because it is at your house, youll be tempted to try.She reached across the table.As part of our wedding gift, Cash and I are hiring a cleaning lady.When Dottie opened her mouth to object, Annie shook her head.Not negotiable.No use arguing with her.Sophie scooped up a tortilla chip and popped it in her mouth.Ive known her all my life.Believe me, when she gets an idea, theres no stopping her.Thats right, Annie agreed.So save your breath.What are your thoughts about flowers?Rita asked.Maggie watched as sweet, always cheerful Dottie crumpled.Her bottom lip trembled, and tears spilled from her eyes.She quickly swiped them away with the back of her hand.Dottie?Maggie rose and started around the table, but Dottie waved her away.Sit down.She sniffed.Im fine.But youre crying.Sophie sounded horrified.I know.Old fool that I am.A little hiccup escaped.Its just thatoh, Im getting married.Fresh tears ran unimpeded down her cheeks.I never expected this.Never even considered it.Harry and I were happy.I spent my life with him, bore his children.Now Fletcher and I She made a fluttering motion with her hand.Its not too late to call it off if youre not sure, Annie said.Not sure?Dottie sniffed again.A watery smile lit up her face.Ive never been so sure of anything in my life.I love Fletch.She shook her head.I never thought to say that again.Her gaze moved around the table.And whats truly amazing is he loves me back.The women stood and moved in for a group hug.After whispers, hand pats, and exchanged kisses, Dottie cleared her throat.Okay, girls, I think Ive got myself under control.Im sorry.Sorry?Rita grinned ear to ear.Honey, youve made my year.I love my man more than the day I married him.You and Fletch are further proof that love isnt only for the young.Were never too old to tumble head over heels.No, were not.Maggie, halfway back in her chair, felt four pairs of eyes on her.What?It seems to me Ritas gaze drifted around the table.My daughter is the only non bride here.Brawley seems interested, Sophie said.Maggie snorted.Annie shook her head.Whatever happened between the two of you took place a long time ago.Its possible hes changed.Oh, yeah, Maggie said.The leopard lost his spots.Annie, Sophie, youre both romantics.Newlyweds.Its not going to happen.Ever.Besides, in case youve forgotten, Im leaving in a week and a half.A traitorous sliver of her brain cried out that her timing stunk.She tried to squash it, but the idea dug in its heels.Would she and Brawley have a chance if she stayed?No.Absolutely not.Shed end up another notch on his bedpost.But wait.She was already there, wasnt she?Shoot!A big mistake.One she would not repeat.Dottie interrupted her thoughts.To get back to the flowers.Maybe we could simply do some bouquets from the garden.Maggie wagged her finger.Uh uh.Leave the blooms there.You want the backyard to look beautiful.Full.Well call Bitsy at Heaven Scent and hire her to do your flowers.When Dottie hesitated, Sophie whispered, Youre getting married.Everything should be perfectwithout running yourself ragged.All right.But I want lily of the valley in my bouquet.They represent happiness.Sighs escaped around the table.You need a photographer, Maggie said.Taken care of.Dotties eyes glinted.Excellent.Brawleys doing the pictures.Brawley?Her jaw dropped.The mans a genius behind the lens.Brawley?Youre sounding a bit like a broken record, Sophie said.I know, but Brawley?Have you seen his work?Dottie asked.Mutely, she shook her head.You need to.After his things come from Dallas, you need to stop by.Check out some of his photography.A little off center, Maggie listened as the discussion drifted to food and seating and candles.As they ate homemade taco salads, Dottie informed them she and Fletch had already made arrangements with Father Tom.Maggie helped her mom with the flan and coffee.She took a bite of her sweet treat, then said, One last thing.Reaching into her luggage size purse, she withdrew the sketches shed done earlier.Tears pooled in Dotties eyes for the second time that night.Oh.She covered her mouth with her hand.These are magnificent, honey.Decide which you like best, and that will be your wedding dress.Unless you already have something.No, I dont.I thought Id make a quick trip to Austin, but No buts.Im counting on Pops never getting married again.The least I can do is deck out his bride in a Maggie original.She grinned and watched as the others bent over the drawings, pointing out details.Her mom shot her a pleased glance.These are delightful, Maggie.What a great idea.To Dottie, she said, I dont think you can go wrong with either.Theyll both suit you.Theyre spot on, Dottie agreed.And pink.Maggie shrugged.I can make them any color.No, you cant.Not for my wedding.Its pink or nothing.She grinned.Thats what I figured.A little more coverage than you girls needed.Dottie shot a quick glance at Annie and Sophie.But theyre not at all matronly.She shook her head.Definitely not matronly.You should do a line of these, Annie said.There has to be a huge market for dresses for the more mature bride.I agree.Sophie trailed a finger over the first pencil drawing.These are brilliant.Do you have time to do this?the bride to be asked.You bet I do.I can work fast when I have to.Right, Annie?Maggie looked at her friend.Shed made a red carpetworthy dress for her in less time than she had now.And that dress had started this whole fantastic New York ride.Had earned her national attention.Remember the one I wore in Dallas, Dottie, when you attended the fund raiser with Cash and me?How could I ever forget itor that night?Pure magic.And now youre getting married.Annie wrapped the woman in a hug.I am.And I want to do it in this dress.She pointed to Maggies first choice.I feel like Ive fallen into a fairy tale.In the sketch, the soft pink silk flowed to the floor.The skirt had a sheer overlay.Silvery beads traced over the delicate jacket.Its asymmetrical hem would trim a few pounds off Dotties ample figure.Its perfect, Maggie.Absolutely perfect.Dottie clasped her hands over her heart.When Fletch gets a sight of you in this, hes going to wonder what he did to deserve you.Oh, go on.Dottie batted at Sophie, then turned back to Maggie.How can I ever thank you?You already have.Youve given Pops a new lease on life.Made him feel whole again.Isnt it wonderful?Her mom breathed the question.Dottie wrung her hands.I was so afraid youd all be upset about this.Upset?Maggie frowned.Why would we be upset?I dont know.Dottie toyed with the edge of the tablecloth.I worried youd think I was trying to take your grandmas place.Id never do that.We know, Maggie soothed.How do Wes and Lacey feel about it?Theyre ecstatic.So are we.Maggie took Dotties hand.This is the beginning of a new chapter, but it doesnt erase the ones that went before.No, it doesnt.Okay, Annie said.Well all be crying like babies if we dont cut this out.Youre right.Lets talk jewelry, Maggie said.Diamonds to be exact.Is Pops buying you one?The rich, pungent smell of pizza mingled with the scent of disinfectant, and the high, shrill laughter of the young bounced off the clinics walls.Staubach, Cashs homely mutt, roamed from one boy to the next, hoping for a bite of pizza, a slice of pepperoni.Ty had left Trouble, their pup, at home, figuring hed be underfoot the whole night.Brawley took a long drink of lukewarm soda.Hed been right to do this tonight.They had no overnighters scheduled, and hed arranged for alternate boarding in the event of any emergencies.It sure beat the heck out of anything else he could think of to take his mind off Maggie.Hed already hung plastic over the door openings between the back office area and the front reception and examination rooms.Hopefully, theyd be able to keep the clinic open for emergencies.And speaking of emergencies.His apartment more than qualified.Doc Gibson had promised to work the clinic tomorrow so Brawley could have the day to pull his place together.Make it his own.Right now, everything in his life was in upheaval, and he felt more than a little out of kilter because of it.He needed someplace he could relax.That felt like home.A small piece of sanity.His mom had promised to help him with it tomorrow.Go, Mom!Where will you board any animals that need to be put up for the next few days?Ty snagged a piece of pepperoni off the last pizza slice.At my cousin Dawns.She does kenneling along with her dog grooming business.It would be impossible to make the kind of mess were going to with animals here.Cash wiped his hands on a napkin, looked at Ty and the boys.You guys ready?He rubbed his hands together in anticipation.Nothing better than all out destruction.Yeah, three voices chorused.Ty pulled a face.Hope were not creating monsters.Brawley reached into a bag and passed safety glasses to Cash and Ty, then grabbed a smaller bag off the front counter.He knelt.Okay, guys, come over here.Safety first on any job site.Jesse, Josh, and Jonah crowded around him and nodded solemnly.A quick stop at Sadlers Store had netted no eyewear small enough to fit the tykes.So, after some head scratching, Brawley had headed into the sports section and found exactly what he needed.Swim goggles.Then hed spent five minutes digging through the bin to find three exactly the same to avert any fights over who got which one.Here you go.Put these on and leave them on whenever were working.Sophied never forgive me if one of you put out your eye.Our eye?Josh raised a hand to his.That would hurt.Yes, it would.But keep these on, and youll be safe.Kay.Jonah turned to his brother.We wont get hurt, Josh.He pulled his goggles over his head.The other two did the same, looked at each other, and giggled hysterically.Then they all tore off to check themselves out in the bathroom mirror.We look funny, Uncle Brawley, Jesse said as they ran back to him.Are you gonna wear some?Brawley pulled his safety glasses from the larger bag and slid them on.He handed each of the kids an upholstery hammer, small enough for them to handle but big enough to produce some results.Leading them over to an office wall, he drew a big X on it.This needs to come down, men.Get er done.You want us to hit the wall?Josh wanted to be really sure before he did something undoable.Yep.Again, the triplets heads swiveled as they looked at each other, then at their dad.Can we, Daddy?Jesse asked.Ty nodded.You sure can.With whoops and hollers, the three tore into the wall.Laughing like loons, they watched as little chunks flew.Ty, hands in the pockets of his jeans, watched them.Might be the beginning of something here.The boys can run a wrecking business when they get older.He laughed.Hell, they run one now.At the house.Poor Sophie.I dont think she really understood what she was getting into when she took us on, but I sure am glad she did.He raised his sledgehammer and took down half a wall.Sheetrock and dust flew.The boys clapped in delight.Wow, Daddy.Youre strong.Ty raised an arm, showing off his muscles.Working beside the others, Brawley asked, How long do you think Maggie will stay in New York?Cash and Ty exchanged intense looks.Shes moving there, Brawley, Cash finally said.Yeah, but This is her dream, pal.Ty rested his hammer on his shoulder.I know that.Do you?Youve been gone.You havent seen how hard she works at her business.A muscle ticked in Brawleys jaw.Im not gonna screw it up for her.Good, because she deserves this shot, Cash said.Understood.He brought his own tool down hard enough to crash through the wall, boards and all.Done for the night, Brawley found himself unable to settle.He grabbed a Lone Star from the fridge and took it downstairs.Sitting in the dark in Dotties garden, he stared into the vast Texas sky and watched the stars twinkle to life overhead.Nursing his beer, he thought about Ty and Cash.Theyd both driven home to their families.Would be tucked into bed tonight with their sweethearts.Would he ever get there?Hed kept an eye on Ty and the boys tonight.Brawley wanted kids.Had always figured hed have some by now.But his plans had gotten derailed somewhere along the way.Maggie.The moonlight turned the white flowers in Dotties garden into shimmery, glowing torches.A place for fantasy.The perfect spot to sit and think about Red.Hed loved her through junior high and high school, then had made the biggest, boneheaded move of his life.Hed honestly thought he was doing the right thing all those years ago, stepping aside so shed go to her design school.That after they both finished college, theyd hook up again.They hadnt.Maggie being Maggie, she wouldnt forgive him.Hed miscalculated her fiery temper.Her stubbornness.So hed moved to Dallas after he graduated, certain hed stop loving her eventually.He couldnt.So what had he done?Decided to pick up and move home.Woo Maggie.Court her.Storm her walls till she caved.How had that worked, dumbass?She was leaving.Moving to New York to follow those very dreams hed given her space to find.His timing was off.Way off.Again.But Cash was dead right.He had no business standing in her way.He glanced again at the sky.Star crossed lovers?He didnt believe in that shit.Tipping the longneck bottle, he drank.Maybe if he had a couple more of these, he could sleep tonight.A couple crickets chirped, their voices sounding loud in the quiet.Thinking about heading upstairs to fetch another beer, he heard Maggies car pull into the drive, watched the swath of light her beams cut through the darkness.An overhead light went on when she opened her door, and quiet music from her radio spilled into the night.Apparently Rita had cooked more than the girls could eat because Maggie got out and her head disappeared into the back seat.She came out with a plate of goodies.His stomach rumbled.Hed worked off every bite of that long ago pizza.Maggie walked Dottie to her door and saw her safely inside.She still wore those sexy as hell shoes, and his engine kicked into overdrive.When she started back to the car, he called out, Hey, Red.Got any more food stashed away in that car?Her head swiveled around, hand to her heart.Geez, Brawley, you could give a girl a heart attack.Didnt mean to startle you.Didnt you guys eat tonight?Yeah, but we busted butt.Im starving again.She opened the back door and took out another plate.You know my mom.She always makes twice as much as we need.I was counting on that.She made to hand him the plate, but he shook his head.Join me.Hold on a sec.He zipped upstairs and grabbed two more beers.Coming back down, he saw shed moved to Dotties little turquoise table and had unwrapped a taco salad, complete with sour cream and guacamole.He handed her a beer, then broke off a piece of the shell and used it to scoop up salad.Mouth full, he mumbled, Mmmm.Your moms one of the best cooks in the county.They sat in the moonlight and devoured the salad.She laughed.Guess I was hungry, too.Their fingers touched, and he linked their hands, held tight when she tried to pull away.Brawley No, lets not fight.Not tonight.Give me fifteen minutes under the stars, Maggie.Surely we can manage that.But he wondered if he could.He wanted, desperately, to kiss her.You ever go swimming at the hole anymore?he asked.When she shook her head, the moonlight glinted off her hair, her earrings.She looked for all the world like a fairy princess.Not anymore, she said.Its been years.Wanna go?Now?Yeah.Youre crazy, Brawley.About you.Her sigh filled the garden.I really do have to go.Im a businesswoman, and I have to be up early.He nodded.She stood.This was nice.Thanks.He took both her hands in his.She swayed toward him, started to kiss his cheek.No.He met her lips with his.Hunger, raw and deep, ripped through him.He tasted the same emotion on her lips, in her.One kiss led to another and another.Breathing hard, she broke away, running her fingers through her hair to push it off her face.I cant do this.It was never a question of chemistry.We had that in spades.We still do.His voice was husky and ragged.I cant and wont deny that.Come upstairs with me.Stay the night.He trailed kisses along her neck, her collarbone.She shivered, and he knew she was close.But she put her hands on his arms and pushed away.I cant.I know I handled things badly, but how can you hold it against me so long?She didnt answer.Simply turned to walk away.He grabbed her hand and kissed it before she melted into the night, leaving him standing in the dark, wanting more.So much more.He wanted to bawl like a baby.Seven  A pesky ray of sunlight caught him square in the eyes.Brawley rolled over, taking his pillow with him.Damn.Hed forgotten to close the shades.Thered been some interesting goings on in the driveway late last night.But he wouldnt think about that.Not yet.Maggie would skin him alive if she found out about it and knew he knew but hadnt told her.The old rock and a hard place.He rubbed a hand over his chin.He should shave, but hell with it.He wasnt going into work, so why bother?With every move, his muscles grumbled and groused, reminding him it had been way too long since hed indulged in any real physical labor.The punching bag and weights in his fancy Dallas gym kept him in decent shape, but they sure as hell hadnt prepared him for hours wielding that sledgehammer.By the time theyd destroyed and cleaned up last night, the kids had crashed.Jessed curled up on the reception room sofa and fallen fast asleep.Jonah had chosen the armchair next to him.Theyd finally found Josh flat on his back behind the reception counter.All three still wore their swim goggles.What amazed Brawley was that they hadnt so much as stirred when Ty removed the goggles or when the men hefted them up, carried them to the van, and strapped them in.Ty said theyd sleep all the way home, and hed toss them into their beds, grubby clothes and all.Brawley wondered what Sophie had to say about that.All in all, it had been an interesting evening.His mind turned to Maggie.Last night in Dotties garden, in the dark, hed hoped.For what?Forgiveness?A turning back of the clock?It wasnt gonna happen.And that was about the most depressing thought hed ever had.Hed wanted her.Right here in his bed.Had, instead, stood and watched her drive away to her own.And speaking of beds.Thank God, this would be his last night in this one.Way too soft.His own should arrive tomorrow.Before that happened, though, he had a lot to accomplish today.Tossing the pillow aside, he squinted at the little jewel box alarm clock.Another of Annies treasures.Why neither she nor Sophie had taken it with them he didnt know.Today, though, it would be out of here, along with the rest of the fluff.He groaned as he rolled over again.The next few hours were going to be busy.Time he crawled out of bed, got dressed, and threw on a pot of coffee.Cash should be here soon to help him haul away this stuff.Both Annie and Sophie had already assured him there wasnt anything here they needed or wanted.He and Cash would toss everything in a neighbors storage shed for now.Later, he hoped to hold a town wide yard sale.One of the most appalling things about Maverick Junction was their lack of a humane society.Hed use the leftovers here to kick start the fund raiser.Maybe he could talk Sophie into spearheading it.When shed come into the clinic last fall, dragging an unkempt stray cat with her, the options had been limited.At the mere mention of euthanasia, shed decided to keep Lilybelle.And because of that bedraggled animal, he and Ty had stopped by in time to beat the bloody hell out of the bastard whod been stalking Sophie.A knock at the door snapped him out of those unpleasant thoughts, and he unfisted his hands.Doors open.Cash walked in, sniffing the air.That coffee I smell?Sure is.Those donuts I smell?Sure are.Cash grinned and set the bag of fresh baked donuts on the table.Stopped by Sadlers.Figured if you were gonna work me like a mule today, I needed my sugar fix first.Amen to that.He squinted at his friend.Annie didnt fix a big farmhouse breakfast for you?Cash snorted.You kidding?When I got up, she threw me a sleepy smile, pulled the covers over her head, and mumbled something about me having a good time with you today.Smart woman.I wanted to stay in bed, too.I sure appreciate you coming over to help.Brawley poured two mugs, and they stood, hips against the counter, drinking coffee and eating the dunkers.Cash glanced around the apartment.Annie and I had some good times here, but I sure can see why you want a change.Way too girly.Brawley chuckled.Girly gone wild.Has she tried to do this to your house?Nope.Thank God.Cash took one last swig of coffee, then rinsed his cup and set it in the sink.Okay, pal, lets get started.The sooner we do, the sooner we finish.They hauled and lugged.By their fourth trip, they cursed every one of the stairs up to the second story apartment.Can I give you boys a hand?Wiping her hands on a tea towel, Dottie opened her kitchen door.Thanks, but weve got it covered, Cash said.That girl of yours sure ended up with a lot of stuff, didnt she?Yes, maam.Cash turned his ball cap backward.That your grandpas sofa?She nodded at the deep brown couch theyd set in the driveway.It is, and its going home with me.I sure am glad Annie saved it from LeRoys secondhand shop.I love this thing.Cash ran a hand over the back of it.I cant wait to watch my next ball game sprawled on it.I think itll be real happy in our family room.I think it will, too.Your grandpa would be pleased youre keeping it.Yeah, he would.They slid the last nightstand into the back of Cashs truck as Brawleys mom pulled up in her snazzy little red convertible.Hey, good looking, Brawley called.Hey, yourself, handsome.See you two got an early start.If were gonna hit the paint today, it made sense to clear out the place.Empty rooms paint easier.I talked to the moving company in Dallas yesterday, and they promised to deliver my stuff tomorrow.She nodded toward the truck.Is that your bed in there?Yep.He scuffed his boot over the drive.Well, technically, its Annies.Where will you sleep tonight?Ive got a sleeping bag.Ill be fine.Oh, honey, thats nonsense.Why dont you stay with your dad and me?It doesnt make sense to bunk on the hard floor.Im good.Honest.He kissed the top of her head.Dont worry about me, Mom.Im a big boy.Let me give Cash a hand with this load before we run to Sadlers for the paint.Did you pick out your colors?Yes, maam, I did.He pulled the paint cards from his pocket and tapped the pale gray.This is it.For the whole apartment?Yep.Youre going to paint all the walls in every room the same color?I am.You are such a guy.At the risk of sounding repetitive, I am.She reached up and ruffled his hair.Yes, you are.Except the ceilings.Im gonna leave those cream.Annie painted them not even a year ago.Hallelujah.His mom raised her eyes to the heavens.I hate ceilings.No matter how careful I am, I end up with more paint on me than on the Sheetrock.Cash laughed.Wish the two of you could have seen Annie when I walked in on her painting this place.What a mess.It seems heiresses arent expected to slap paint on their own walls, so shed never lifted a brush in her life.But she was game.Have to give her that.Shes a good woman, Cash, Karolyn Odell said.Dont I know it.The day she rode into Maverick Junction on that big black Harley of hers was the luckiest day of my life.Oh, geez.Brawley groaned.Cut it out, Cash.Youre feeding into all of my moms fairy tale shit.Sorry.The grin on Cashs face belied his words.Too bad somebody else cant settle down with one woman.Karolyns gaze strayed to her son.See?See what youve done?Cash laughed out loud.Brawley scrubbed both hands over his face and let out a mammoth sigh.Maybe you could run to Sadlers, Mom, and pick up the paint while we deal with this.He nodded to the loaded truck.I could.And if you think I didnt catch that less than subtle attempt at changing the subject, youd be wrong.No, maam, I didnt.I wasnt aiming for subtle.He fished a credit card from his wallet and passed it to her.Well need some rollers and Son of mine, Ive done this a thousand times.I know exactly what we need.Her eyes narrowed as she studied the paint chip.Not sure Id use this everywhere, but I have to admit its a good choice.Itll go great with your furniture.When he nodded, she asked, You sure you dont want a couple accent walls?Im sure.Okay.She drew out the word.Youre the one living with it.She stuck her head inside Dotties open door.You want to ride to Sadlers with me?Give me two seconds.True to her word, his new landlady was out the door almost before the words left her mouth.In no time flat, Dottie and his mom were strapped in and headed to the store.Wonder what color shell bring back for your accent walls, Cash said.Your guess is as good as mine.Brawleys mom straightened, arching her back.And thats that.She laid her roller in the pan.Looks wonderful, doesnt it?Yes, it does.Gotta give you credit.You were totally right.And she had been.Shed come back from Sadlers loaded down with paint supplies and his pale gray paintand another couple gallons of a dark charcoal gray.Every room had one wall in the deeper color, and darn if she hadnt nailed it.Exactly right.Masculine.Clean.Him.Now if he only had some furniture.He wrapped his mom in a big hug, smearing paint on both of them.We did good, didnt we?Yes, we did.She rested her head on his chest.Im so glad youve come home.I dont think Dad shares your enthusiasm.Hell come around.At the bottom of it all, hes as happy to have you here as I am.Hes just not sure its best for you.It is.Its what I want.I know.Your dad will get there.Give him time.Through the open window, Brawley heard the crunch of tires.Glancing out, he saw Maggies deep blue, several years old Chrysler 300.Youve got company.Dont think so.Itd be a cold day in hell before Maggie came to see me.Drying his hands on a paper towel, he stepped outside.When the wind caught the door and slammed it behind him, Maggie glanced up.Her smile slipped away, and she reached for her back door handle.Hey, Red.Wait a sec.Why?You cant take a minute or two to be neighborly?Last night was nice, but nothings changed.You look tired, sugar.Well, there you go, Brawley Odell.All that flattery.Who said you dont know how to sweet talk a woman?I didnt say you look bad, just tired.Bad?No, sir.Not by a long shot.Dressed in a flame red, silky top and pencil thin black pants, the lady gave off enough heat to kindle a prairie fire.Reaching into the back seat, she drew out a garment bag.I couldnt sleep, so I ended up in the shop today before the sun topped the horizon.Thats not fun.No.But She held up the bag.I have Dotties dress almost finished.Thought Id stop by, do a rough fitting.Her dress?For the wedding.A grin split his face.Youre making her wedding dress?Maggie smiled and heat raced through him.Yes.She sighed.Dottie and Pops.Can you believe it?Gotta admit they caught me by surprise.Brawleys mother poked her head around the corner.Maggie.Hello.Hi, Mrs.Odell.Id ask what youre doing here, but from the gobs of paint on your face and clothes, I can figure that out.Brawley put you to work, did he?I volunteered.His furnitures coming tomorrow.Thats good.Did you finish painting?Sure did, Brawley said.Moms a slave driver.Come up and take a peek.Looks a little different with all that blue gone.I liked the blue.You would.Whats that supposed to mean?Nothing.You like color, thats all.He watched while she replaced the garment bag in the car.Curiosity ran strong in her.Hed known she wouldnt be able to resist.Especially with his mom here to provide a safety net.She sauntered across the drive on heels nearly as high as stilts and every bit as red as her top.Oh, yeah.Shoes like that did crazy things to a guy.He swiped a hand over his mouth.Those legs should be registered as a lethal weapon.When she reached the top of the stairs, he stood aside while his mom carefully kissed Maggies cheek so as not to get paint on her.He envied his mother when Maggie kissed her back.The two loved each other.His mom had been beyond sorry when things hadnt worked out between them.Shed welcomed Maggie into the family, considered her the daughter shed never had.His dad, on the other hand, had been relieved hed ended the relationship and made no bones about it.He loved Maggie, but he wanted more for his son and figured shed hold him back.All these years later, Trace Odell made it clear that Brawley had better have moved back home for the right reasonsand not because of Maggie.Brawley assured him hed returned to Maverick Junction because hed wanted to.
