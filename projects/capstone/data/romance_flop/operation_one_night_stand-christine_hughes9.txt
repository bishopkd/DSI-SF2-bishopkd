Scooping me up, he stepped to the side of the bed, bent down, and pulled the covers back before placing me back down.My head settled into the pillow as I basked in the afterglow of the orgasm that was still knocking on my lady bits.Be right back.He padded out the door.Be right what?He returned quickly with a bottle of water, top unscrewed.I took it and gulped down half the bottle before handing it back to him.He watched me as he drank deeply and smiled as he placed the bottle on the table.What are you smiling at?I fell back on the pillow.You.Me?Im funny?I crossed my eyes and made fish lips at him.I felt comfortable enough to act like a goofball and it felt good.It felt better than good.It felt amazing.He crossed his eyes back at me and laughed.No.Youre awesome.I cant believe youre here.I can.I reached for the bottle of water.You can?He cocked his eyebrow with the question.Yep.I saw the way you looked at me.And how did I look at you?The way you look at someone when you like them.Ill have to relearn my poker face.Dont do that.I like it.Well, in that case He leaned in and kissed me.When he pulled away my eyes were still closed and my lips were still puckered.He pinched my lips and I pulled away, laughing.Now come in here with me before I get cold.I patted the bed.Yes, maam.He unbuttoned his pants and they dropped to the floor.His boxer briefs strained for a moment before he slipped those off, too, and slid into the bed next to me.Both of us lay on our sides, close enough to touch.He trailed his fingers along my skin.You okay?he asked.Perfect.Why?I dont know.I sort of feel like I was torturing you for a bit there.You sort of were.But I liked it.Do you need a break?A break?There was more?You mean I need more of a break than what youve already given me?Yeah.I guess so.I was quiet a moment as I contemplated him.Smiling, I reached down and fisted my hand around him.His face broke out into a grin and he said, Ill take that as a no.He leaned over and reached behind him to open the nightstand drawer.I heard the foil tear and felt the bed jostle a bit as he rolled on a condom before he positioned himself on top of me, keeping eye contact.I spread my legs apart to help him settle in.Ready?His voice was quiet.I nodded slightly.More than.I felt myself swell around him as he entered me.We each drew in a breath and held still, taking in the first feeling.He leaned down to kiss me.As the kiss deepened he began to move slowly in and out.I moved my hips with him until we fell into a slow, steady rhythm.Dropping to his elbows, he ran his hands along my cheeks and kissed my eyelids.Each thrust was gentle and deliberate.I felt each movement down to my toes.Beautiful Caroline.He whispered in my ear and my skin tingled.Our rhythm matched, we were in total sync.There was no ferocity to the lovemaking, as there had been with the foreplay.The urgency still surrounded us and I wrapped my legs tighter around him and hugged him closer.The need to crawl inside him was overwhelming.I rocked my hips hard in an attempt to get closer to him.He met my thrust with one of his own.Back and forth we pressed into each other and the feel of him inside me pushed me to my limits until I clenched around him and cried out.Oh my God, Brian!My legs tightened around him as the orgasm crashed over me.Brian, yes!He rocked harder into me until my legs fell limp to the side.Slowing down, he kissed my neck and I nearly jumped out of my skin.You okay?Sensitive, I managed to say between haggard breaths and he chuckled before he stilled.He was waiting for me to catch my breath.When I finally calmed down, I smiled and shifted my weight until we rolled and I was on top of him.Well, this is nice.He smiled as I leaned down to kiss him, my hair wild and curly curtained around us.Nice, huh?I bit his lip and tugged.I reached back and wrapped my hand around him as I lifted myself up and guided him back inside me.His groan was music to my ears.Maybe a little more than nice.He winked, though I could tell he was struggling to gain his composure.With my hands on his chest, I pushed myself up until I was sitting across him and he was deep inside me.Slowly I rocked back and forth and his hands moved from my thighs up my body to my breasts and back down again.Still nice?I asked as I pressed my hands into his chest and grinded into him.C C Caroline.He stammered.Oh my God, Care.My thighs tightened as I felt my climax build.He reached around and grabbed my ass, pulling me in faster, his hips thrusting up and slamming into me.I grabbed his hands and leaned over him, holding them over his head.My breasts pushed into his chest, my lips found his.He pulled his hands away and wrapped them around me tight, holding me to him.Together we thrust and pushed until I erupted and shook.Two thrusts later and he was the one calling out my name.I lay on top of him, shuddering and feeling his vibrations.I closed my eyes to gain some semblance of calm and when I did, I realized Id already found my balance.Every emotion I felt was raw and exposed.It was like I knew what he felt, what he thought.I was sure my heart showed on my face, as much as his heart shone through.The longer I looked into his eyes, the farther I fell.Instinctively, I knew he would be there to catch me.***The next morning I zoomed past my usual wake up time and slept until almost nine.Raising my arms over my head, I stretched long and hard, smiling when I thought about the night before.Slowly, I opened my eyes and looked around.Sunlight streamed through the window.My dress was hanging on the closet door.And Brian was nowhere to be found.I flashed back to the morning after he slept at my apartment and frowned.The frown was short lived because, as if on cue, he walked into the room carrying a steaming cup of coffee and wearing low slung pajama pants.Good morning.He placed the coffee cup on the table and leaned in to kiss me.Hed already brushed his teeth.I remembered Steven used to hate it if I didnt get right up and brush my teeth.I had to rein in the panic attack.I had no toothbrush and Brian wasnt Steven.Good morning.Did you sleep well?I did.Thank you.When did you get up?Like an hour ago.Had to say goodbye to my brother.He went back home.So were alone?I propped myself up on my elbow.We are.I pulled myself up and planted small kisses on his neck and shoulders.So, last night, I had Sarah drop off a bag at the bar.I pulled back.You did?Yeah.She packed stuff for you.Extra clothes.A toothbrush.That was awfully presumptuous.Did you think I was a sure thing?I teased and resumed kissing his body.Not exactly, but just in case, I didnt want you to have to rush off.That was thoughtful.I wanted to pay attention to what he was saying but he was just so damn delicious.I thought maybe we could do something today.Like what?Go out to breakfast, go to a museum.I dont know.Sounds like fun.But first I pulled him down to the bed and climbed on top of him until I was straddling him.My fingers teased the top of his pajama pants and it was my turn to watch the goose bumps cover his body.I have an idea of how we can get this day started.Yeah?A slow, sexy grin spread across his mouth.Yep.I leaned down, pressing my mouth to his.Twenty FourIt was just after eleven when Sarah called me.Brian and I were getting ready to head into the city for the afternoon.Care, what the hell happened last night?What do you mean?I spent the night at Brians.Thank you for packing a bag for me by the way.You mean you dont know?Dont know what?Does Brian have a computer?Of course he does.I placed my hand over the phone and asked him, Do you have a computer?He nodded and I put her on speaker.Search yourself.Search my what?Yourself.Go on the computer and search your name.Okay.Brian typed my name into the search engine.Did you do it?Yeah, whats all this?Click on any article, make sure its some sort of tabloid, though.Brian clicked on the first article.A huge photo of me slapping Michael stared back at me under the heading Lovers Quarrel.Holy shit.Do you see what I see?Sarah was obviously alternating between concern and all out laughter.Do you see the big red arrow pointing to the big red circle?Brian moved closer to the screen.Both of us stared for a moment before we figured out what was highlighted.Michael had what looked like a pair of white panties sticking out of his pocket, circled in red by the author of the article.You werent wearing white panties, Brian said seriously.No shit I wasnt wearing white panties.Ha!Care, they think you and Michael are doing it, Sarah yelled.Thank goodness she was on speaker or I was sure I would have lost my hearing.A call beeped in and I looked at the phone.Yolanda.Oh shit, Sarah.I have to go.Thats Yolanda.Good luck and I want all the deets on your night with Brians love stick.Brian suppressed a laugh.Youre on speaker.I know.Later!She clicked off and I switched over to Yolandas call.Hi, Yolanda.I hope you have an explanation.I thought I told you not to get involved with Michael.I didnt.Well, it sure as hell looks differently.I want you in my office now.Michael and Mr.Little are already on their way.We need to figure out a way to diffuse this before it goes viral or whatever you kids call it.She clicked off before I could answer.I plopped into the chair.Son of a bitch.We both know those arent your panties.Right.I stared off into space, trying to wrap my head around the situation.Then whose panties are they?I knew whose they were.The question was whether or not I should tell Brian.Wait.Brian stood up and walked back to the computer.He studied the screen for a minute before he spoke again.Wasnt that photo taken after my sister interviewed him?I could only nod.Are those my He brought his hands to his head.Are those my sisters panties?I shrugged but the look on my face told him all he needed to know.I will fucking kill that guy!Wait, wait.We dont know for sure.You said your sister went to her friend Melissas?Call your sister and ask her again where she slept.His phone was out of his pocket before I finished my sentence.Dialing his sisters number, he stalked back to his room and slammed the door.Though most of the conversation was loud and muffled, I did get confirmation that I was right.They were Siobhans panties.Looked like two of us got lucky last night.I battled my inner You go girl!against two things:1.I was mentally high fiving Brians sister.Though I wasnt sure where he and I were in our relationship, I was pretty sure I needed to side with him on that particular point.2.I wasnt sure if I could actually proceed with the mental high five because it was Michael she slept with.Then again, weve all slept with worse.I tried to tamp down the judgment, I really did.I wasnt into slut shaming.Like I mentioned, you go girl!But it was Michael.It could have been anyone but him.He was such an icky douche bag, it gave me the heebie jeebies just thinking about the fact that Id even entertained the possibility he was sexually attractive.Physically?A fantastic specimen.However, his personality dropped his stock exponentially.When Brian reentered the living space, I could tell he was not handling whatever information hed just received from his sister very well.Shes on her way to your office with him.Michael?Who else?His tone dripped with annoyance.I held up my hands and stepped back.Look, dont be mad at me.I didnt do anything.Did you know?That she was going to his place?No, of course not.Why is she so stupid?I love my sister but, man, she makes some really shitty decisions.I know its not my place but shes an adult, you know.At twenty six, she cant really be considered a child.And Im thirty three.Still doesnt give her the right not to use common sense.Anyone could tell that guy wasisbad news.Funny, I hadnt known how old he was.Id never thought to ask.Look, why dont you come with me?You can sit with her while I lose my job.Fine.Lets go.He threw on his jacket and opened the door, motioning for me to exit.The train ride there was filled with icy silence.Brian was fuming, texting furiously on his phone.I could only assume Siobhan was on the other end and by the force with which he was stabbing the screen, I was certain she was getting a complete dressing down.I felt bad for her.I knew what it was like to make bad decisions and have to live with the consequences.Hell, Id made a bad decision that lasted five long years.The building was eerily quiet, just the way I liked it.I enjoyed staying late at work or coming in on the weekends to get work done in the peace and quiet.I ran my hand along the wall as we waited for the elevator.I wasnt ready to say goodbye to the job.Id worked there only two weeks, though it felt much longer.I had so much more to learn and I knew Id learn it from Yolanda.It was a shame I couldnt make it work.The elevator dinged when we hit our floor and I told Brian to wait in the lobby.His sister was already curled up in one of the chairs looking out the window at the city that never sleeps.I took a deep breath before opening the door to Yolandas office.Mr.Little, Yolanda, and Michael were all sitting in the room, deep in discussion.Caroline.Please come in.Have a seat.Mr.Little motioned for me to sit next to him.Glad you could make it.I didnt like Michaels tone.I got here as fast as I could.Okay.Weve heard what happened from Michael.We want to know what happened from your point of view.Yolanda had her pen poised, ready to take notes.The yellow legal pad did nothing to make me feel any better about the situation.I spent the next fifteen or so minutes recounting the evening from the time I reached the restaurant to the time I left.I did what I could to keep Siobhan out of the mix but with the photo circulating with her panties sticking out of his pocket and the fact that they already knew shed spent the night with him, there was no getting around mentioning her.So, they were not your, er, umMr.Little stumbled over his wordspanties?No, sir.They werent.What was it exactly that prompted you to slap Michael?I closed my eyes and shuddered and retold the conversation he and I had in the hall.I mentioned how he insinuated Siobhans oral prowess and how he propositioned me.I did not proposition you!Michael leaped from his chair.You will sit down, Mr.Mortimer.Right now.Yolandas tone was icy.I could feel my job slipping from between my fingers and I figured I had nothing left to lose.Truth be told, it isnt the first time, Michael.And I am quite sure, with an ego the size of yours, it wont be the last.Now, dont misunderstand me.I can handle you.I understand youre a slimy horn ball who gets his jollies off on preying on women you consider unable to fight off your advances.Youre gross.Your behavior is unacceptable.Unfortunately, youre also a brilliant author.Even more unfortunately, that fact inflates your ego more than I would ever think is humanly possible.I turned my attention to Yolanda.Ms.Page, I love this job.I love working here.I know I have a lot to learn.I wish I could erase the photo thats spreading like wildfire all over the Internet.I cant help but feel as though Ive let you down in some way.But please know, if I had any idea as to Mr.Mortimers intentions with Siobhan, I would have put a stop to it one way or another.I couldnt stop talking.Mr.Little, I want to thank you for the opportunity to work for you and your wonderful company.I only wish my tenure could have been extended.The room was silent.I contemplated standing up and leaving, but Michael was blocking my way to the door.Are you giving notice?Mr.Little asked.Well, I figured, after all this mess, you wouldnt want me working here anymore.Thats stupid.Yolanda was blunt.Youre the best assistant editor Ive had since I started this business, and thats saying something.Indeed, you do have quite a bit to learn, but I think you have a bright future in this business.I dont want her working on my books anymore.Michael pointed at me.Well, after this book, that will no longer be an issue.Mr.Little stood and buttoned his jacket.Even at the last minute on a Sunday, he was wearing a suit.We will not be renewing your contract, nor will we be considering any more of your work.I built this company from the ground up.We have standards.We have morals.And we expect those who work for us to hold the same values.Are we clear?My mouth hit the floor.I looked back and forth among Yolanda, Mr.Little, and Michael.Michael jumped from his seat.You cant do this to me!I make more money than half your other authors combined!Yolanda, tell him!I have nothing to say.She closed her mouth in a thin line of nude lipstick.Mr.Little stuffed his Jets hat on his head and pulled on his gloves.My word is final.You will no longer come into this office.The rest of the work that is completed on your manuscript will be communicated via e mail, telephone, or post.Ive sat back and watched your shenanigans and have had to spend more money on public relations because of you.You make us money?Not after we spend it fixing your shenanigans!Its just not worth it anymore.Now, if youll excuse me, I have some grandkids to visit.Yolanda, as we discussed.Thank you, Oscar.Caroline, I expect to see you bright and early tomorrow.We have some things to discuss.Michael, I need one more word with you.Rooted to my seat, I knew I should get up and leave but I was still in shock with what had gone down.Caroline?Tomorrow?Yes, Yolanda.Thank you.Back in the lobby, I saw Brian rubbing his sisters back.It was such a nice thing to see.I knew the anger hed displayed earlier was only because of his concern for her.It was endearing and made me feel more than happy with my decision to see where he and I would go.Ahem.Brian looked up and smiled.You okay?Yeah.Im good.Caroline, I am so sorry I got you fired.He just seemed so nice.I didnt think I was hurting anyone.I didnt get fired.He did.What?They are not renewing his contract.I get to stay on.As a matter of fact, I am to report bright and early tomorrow morning.Thats great news.Brian hugged me tight.I never wanted him to let go.I know!Crazy.I thought for sure I was getting the boot.I pulled away from the embrace in time to see Michael stalk toward the elevators, muttering under his breath.Our eyes met.You!This is your fault.But you know what?Screw you.Screw this fucking place.I have more talent in my fucking pinky than anyone else you could bring in here.Youll see.I saw him notice Siobhan.Oh, here.He threw something at her that landed at her feet.You can have your fucking panties back.I dont need them anyway.Siobhan cried out in embarrassment.Brian sent a right hook across Michaels cheek as the elevator door slid open.Im sorry, Brian whispered.Dont be.I tiptoed up and kissed him.The last time I ever saw Michael Mortimer he was holding his cheek with a shocked look on his face as the elevator doors closed.Come on, Brian said.Lets take the stairs.Twenty FiveWhen I finally made it home, Sarah and Melody were in the kitchen poring over take out menus.It looked as though wed be having sushi tonight.Youre back!Melody ran over and hugged me, lifting me off the ground.Now spill!I want to hear all the dirty details about you and Brian.I went with Sarah to drop off your bag at the bar.His brother is cute.Easy.Hes married.Melody pouted.Hes still cute.I hadnt had time to take off my coat or drop my bag, and both of my best friends in the world were sitting side by side on the couch waiting to hear about all of my drama.Im not ashamed to say it felt good.Id spent too long living vicariously through them and it was pretty freaking awesome that I finally had dirt to dish.Let me take off my coat, get a drink, and order some food.We have a lot to talk about.The three of us sat cross legged around the coffee table sharing pints of noodles, spring rolls, and three rolls of sushi.And, of course, wine.We were working on our second bottle when I got to the part where I slept at Brians apartment.Holy shit, girl!Hes hot and sexy!Melody had obviously had more than her share of the two bottles of wine.I know, right?I giggled, downed my glass, and opened a third bottle.So I take it you didnt need an ice pack this morning?Sarah asked.No, I didnt.I threw a pillow at her.It wasnt like that, though.I mean it was.It was hot and sensual and amazing but mostly, it wasPerfect?Yes.Perfect.Its like I woke up and realized where I am supposed to be and its with him.And then in the next thought I asked myself why it took me so long to figure it out, you know?Like somehow I knew all along it was supposed to be Brian but I didnt let myself go there because he wasnt the target or some stupid shit.Well, I for one am very happy you opened your eyes.I mean Ryan, what can I say?He was definitely fuck me stupid hot but he wasnt for you.You need more, whats the word?Structure?Stability?Melody piped in after a loud hiccup.Maybe.But you know what I mean.I do.And I really did.Is it weird that I miss him already?Nope.Not at all!Its like you want to write I miss you on a rock and throw it at his face so he knows how much it hurts to miss him.I shook my head.Only Melody would come up with shit like that.Sure, I guess.But thats not even the best part!I have to tell you what happened when I was called into the office.Pantygate.I looked at Melody.What?Thats what they called it on some blog.Pantygate.Great.Ugh.I told them all about how I told off Michael.I was pretty proud of myself.Love it.Its like I told my principal, I might be a lady but when I get mad I become an evil demon bitch who will make assholes wish they were never born.Sarah always did have a way with the visual.I continued with the story of how I found out and Brians reaction.I walked them through the meeting and ended with Brian punching Michael.I wish I could have seen your face when Brian hit him.Mustve been awesome.It kind of was.I spoke through a mouth full of food.He totally stood up for his sister, you know?She was a bit of a mess.Especially when Michael threw her underwear.I felt bad for her.Yeah, she seems like a nice girl.Mel, youd like her.Melody cringed.Id rather that than the cold shoulder Im getting from Danny.I swear, Im off alcohol.We stared at her as she lifted the wineglass to her lips.Well, not now but in the future.Alcohol is bad for my legs.They swell?I asked, suddenly concerned.No, they fucking spread like soft butter.I havent heard from Danny since the night at the bar.Whatever.I think my guardian angel drinks enough for the both of us.Dannys out of town.I remembered a conversation Brian and I had earlier.Well, isnt that great.Doesnt mean he cant call me.Fuck him.Sweetie, Sarah began, did you give him your number?The blank stare on Melodys face told us the answer.You dipshit!How is he supposed to call if he doesnt know your number?Sarah threw half a spring roll at Melody.Melody picked up a noodle and flung it at her.Maybe I should stop drinking.When Im not in my right mind, my left mind gets pretty crowded.So, whats up with Brians black eye?Sarah changed the subject.Not that we didnt want to hear Melodys woes but sometimes there were so many.Maybe we were terrible friends.You didnt tell me he had a black eye.And Melody was back from her twenty second trip to her personal black hole of sex partners.He didnt want to talk about it.Do you think it was about you?I mean, Ryan hit him, right?Wow.How the hell did you go from living in Stevens shadow to having two men fight over you?Melody stretched out on the floor.I dont know.I just know he doesnt want to talk about it.My phone rang and I looked at the screen.Speak of the devil.Brian?Melody sat up as straight as an arrow.Nope.Ryan.I held out my finger.Hello?Care!How are you?Sorry I didnt call.Im in Cali meeting with my agent.Thats okay.So, whats up?I just thought it would be cool if you and I had dinner when I got back.Just to catch up.Dinner when you get back?Both girls looked like they would pop blood vessels.I dont know if that would be a good idea.Oh, right.Brian.Well, I mean, we can have dinner as friends.We are friends, right?Yeah, were friends.So dinner on Saturday?I didnt know what to say so I blurted out, Make it lunch.I shrugged and made a face at the girls.I wasnt sure if dinner was a good idea.Lunch sounded safer.I heard Ryan laugh on the other end of the phone.Lunch it is.See you then.I clicked off and dropped my phone like it was tainted with bubonic plague.You really think thats a good idea?Sarah pulled out her teacher voice again.What was I supposed to say?You were supposed to say no.You were supposed to say that youre giving it a go with Brian and that you appreciate the offer and thanks but no thanks.Sarah stood abruptly and walked to the kitchen.Its not like shes going to fuck him at lunch.Melody intervened.Of course not.Ill tell Brian.Plus, if I am going to find out how Brian got the black eye, Im going to have to ask Ryan.And it will give me a chance to make it clear that there will be no more hanky panky between us.Well just be friends without the who fuck part of the equation.I guess, Sarah said as she put leftovers in the fridge.She was clearly not happy with my decision.I was a bit put off, truth be told.Wasnt she the one whod lectured me on taking charge of things and not hiding and running away?Whats your deal, Sarah?I dont have a deal.You have an attitude.Uh oh.Melody curled up on the couch to watch the interaction.No, Care.I dont.I just dont want you falling back into your old habits.Nothing about this screams old habits.Since when is it a habit of mine to pluck a guy from the bar and bring him home?Bang a complete stranger on vacation?Finally find a guy who likes me for who I am and not what he can mold me into?Im just saying.Im your friend.I want you to be careful.Well, thanks for the concern but I think I and my lady balls got this one.Maybe you should start paying more attention to your old habits and let me do whats best for me.That wasnt called for, Melody piped in.Oh, shut up!You two bitch because Im not happy then you question my motives when I am.I didnt bitch.Melody looked sad.I shouldnt have dragged her into the argument.CareI didnt give Sarah time to finish her thought.Dont Care me.I think you like it when Im a weepy mess.When my life is as pathetic as yours.Fuck you!Sarah yelled.Fuck you twice!I screamed back at her.I stormed into my room and slammed the door.I barely spoke to her the rest of the week.Twenty SixThe week flew by and I felt like a weight was lifted off my shoulders.I didnt have Michael texting, calling, or e mailing every five minutes wondering where his edits were.Yolanda was on fire, probably fueled by the fact that without Michael bringing in the revenue, we were going to have to stack up a shitload of fantastic manuscripts.The slush pile was about to become a skyscraper.Brian took the news of my lunch with Ryan well.Not that I thought he would be mad.Well, maybe just a little, but his reaction was anything but.I let him know about the phone call and the fact that Id changed it from dinner to lunch.I told him that Id let Ryan know there would be no more hide the pickle.He didnt need to hear any of that.He understood why I needed to say what I had to say in person.He got it.Siobhan stopped by during the week to apologize for the millionth time.She and Melody finally had the chance to meet and they hit it off.Apparently they made plans to hang out.Sarah and I were on polite terms but certainly not like we were.It made me sad that I thought I would lose one of my best friends over something so trivial.Melody swore she knew we would work it out but I knew there had to be some sort of come to Jesus before either of us would budge.I was looking forward to that conversation about as much as I was looking forward to lunch with Ryan later that day.The only silver lining was that I would meet up with Brian at the bar and hang out there with friends until he closed.For the most part, everything in my life was coming together.I felt more like myself than I ever had.I had a job I loved, a boyfriend who actually cared more about me than what others thought about me.A small part of me was waiting for the other shoe to drop.But since I was more of a glass half full girl anymore, I dismissed the notion and headed out.I figured Id get a little shopping done before lunch.I needed to update my work wardrobe.I was in the store trying on blouses when I heard the nasally voice.Betsy was in the next dressing room.I wasnt sure if I should hightail it out of there, hide, or face the music.I chose the latter.After all, what the hell did she have on me?If she was still with Steven, then kudos to her.If leftovers were her thing, then she was more than welcome to sample from the buffet.I handed the saleswoman a few items I wasnt interested in and started riffling through the racks again.I didnt need much but I was in a great mood and new clothes were always an added perk.Unfortunately, I turned the corner to check out the sales rack and ran right into Steven.The shock on his face was quickly replaced by a condescending smirk as he put his phone in his pocket.Well, look whos out and about.Youre looking well, Caroline.Steven.I nodded and tried to step around him but he blocked my path.I mean it.You look good.Happiness and self awareness do that to a person.Excuse me.He stepped in front of me again.I miss you.Isnt your girlfriend in the dressing room?She isnt my girlfriend.She isnt you.Last I checked I wasnt your girlfriend.Not anymore.Thank God for that.Seriously, Steven.Leave me alone.I dont have anything to say to you.He gripped my arm.We never had closure.I think we should talk about what happened.I pulled away from him.There is nothing to talk about.Ive said all I needed to say.What happened to you?You always used to be so accommodating.Look, I was stupid He raked his hands through his hair.I used to think that was sexy.Used to.Too bad you cant fix stupid.I hung up the clothes I was carrying on a random rack.That isnt fair.Youre going to throw away five good years because of a mistake?Because thats what Betsy was, a mistake.I pointed to the purse he was holding.Looks like your mistake is still hanging around.Look, Steven.Im not mad.Im really not.Im happy that your mistake gave me the opportunity to move on, find myself.Ive never felt better.Well, Im miserable.And Im not.Look, you didnt fight for me when I was around so dont cry now that Im gone.Caroline.We were engaged.Engaged!Doesnt that mean anything to you?I looked at him a moment.It does, actually.But not in the way it once did.I turned and headed for the door.Care, we were in love.You cant walk away from love.I looked over my shoulder as I opened the door to the shop.Steven, love is a blind whore filled with bat shit crazy and a shitty sense of humor.I headed toward the restaurant, window shopping along the way.I still needed clothes but I had to get the hell out of the store before I lost my mind.Not that I wanted Steven back or anything, but I just couldnt continue the conversation.Hopefully hed gotten the hint.Sometimes people are like clouds.Its a brighter day when they disappear.My phone rang.As soon as I checked out the display, an insta smile the size of North Dakota spread across my face.Well, hello.What are you wearing?Brian teased.Oh nothing.Just the smile you left me with.Good.Keep that outfit on later when I see you.What time are you meeting Ryan?Thirty minutes or so.Just so you know, he moved out.What the hell happened between you two?I would never want to get in the middle of your friendship.You didnt.Then why do I feel responsible?Because you worry too much.Because youre amazing.Dont worry about it.He and I will patch things up.This isnt the first time weve acted like bitchy schoolgirls and Im sure it wont be the last.But it is for the better that he moved out.Now we can have sex anywhere we want.I totally pictured his smirk and it made me giggle.After this past week, I wasnt sure there were any more places in the apartment to christen.Oh, youd be surprised.Look, Ive got to get a delivery.You have fun and call me if you need anything.I will.See you soon.Cant wait.We clicked off and I noticed a spring in my step that wasnt there before.Brian encouraged me to feel amazing.Who was I to deny the feeling?A bit later I opened the door to the restaurant and, despite being ten minutes early, I saw Ryan sitting in the corner booth.He stood as soon as he saw me.I approached the table and he leaned in to kiss me.He frowned when I maneuvered in time for his lips to plant on my cheek.Howve you been?Great.You?How was Los Angeles?You look nice and tanned.It was good.Taking a new direction.Apparently Im getting too old to model in my underwear.David Beckham can do it but Im too old!My agent set me up with a few calls and I got a walk on role on a detective drama.She thinks its the direction I should go.Well, thats great.Im sure many women will be disappointed not to see you in your boxer briefs, though.I picked up the menu and realized I was starving.Served me right for not eating breakfast that morning.Ha!His laugh was light and reminded me why I had been into him in the first place.It was just unfortunate he wasnt what I was looking for.Hows work for you?I mean, the new job going okay?I recounted last weekends debacle, stealthily leaving out the details about Brian and me.I was sure he knew what was going on by the slow to heal shiner Brian was sporting but I didnt think it was necessary to rub it in his face.Sounds like a trip!At least you kept your job, right?Absolutely.What are you having?Im starving!After we figured out what we were having and ordered, Ryan leaned back and put his hands behind his head.He looked at me as if he were thinking of what to say.Whats up?I asked, knowing he had something to say.Nothing.Nothing?Brians black eye doesnt say nothing to me.It was out there.Id broached the topic and I hadnt thrown up.Score one for me and my stomach of steel!Ahh.I was wondering when that would come up.He and I had a, uh, disagreement.About?You.I knew it!Me?Yeah.Apparently he was having some sort of feelings for you and asked me what my intentions were.Intentions, huh?And what did you say?I told him that I thought you and I could be good friends.He said he wanted more.Words were exchanged.I punched him.End of story.That doesnt sound like the whole story to me.
