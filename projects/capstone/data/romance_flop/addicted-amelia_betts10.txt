Yes?I said, pretending not to know why she had greeted me in such a way.Her face was pretty up close, artfully wrinkled and very pale for Florida.Come here, she said, motioning toward herself.Im sorry, what?I said.Although, before I knew it, I was obliging and walking into her arms to accept her embrace.I must have looked like one hell of a mess, or perhaps she had a heightened perception of other peoples feelings and like many old people, couldnt care less about appearances.Either way I was surprised by how easily I fell into this strangers arms, the chemical y coconut scent of her sunscreen hitting my nose as I let my head rest on her shoulder.We stayed that way, huddled together on the landing, for what seemed like a long time but was probably less than a minute.Things seem so important when youre young, dont they?she said, echoing Isabella as I finally pulled away.I nodded, drying my cheeks with the backs of my hands.I guess they do.Im sure everythings going to be all right, whatever it is.Thank you, I said.A few fresh tears had collected in the corners of my eyes, and I was fighting them back.Good luck to you.Professor Dixon winked and patted my shoulder as I stood there frozen, waiting for her to inquire moreto ask what had caused the tears or offer her unsolicited opinion on Julien Maxwell.Most people wouldnt come upon a scene like this, I thought, and not have a morbid curiosity about it.But she didnt seem to have any curiosity at all.On the contrary, she waited only a few more seconds, then continued up the stairs without another word.It was a bizarre experience to say the least.I kept thinking about it as I crossed the quad on my way to the library and wondered what it meant that I had become so pathetic looking that old ladies were compelled to reach out and hug me in passing.The thought made me laugh.Instead of going straight to work, I decided to sit down on a bench to collect myself.When I tried to go over what had just happened with Julien, I couldnt seem to recall the conversation very clearly, as if I had already blacked it out to save myself the embarrassment.I knew that he had told me he was moving to New York and that we werent living in a novel.I could vaguely recall him saying something about the amazing life I had ahead of me and how he didnt want to bog me down.If you were so concerned with my future, I thought, then why did you complicate things by kissing me in the first place?Part of me wished I had shouted at him back in his office and let him know it wasnt okay to toy with peoples emotions, even though I knew it was better that I hadnt.The fact of it was, I hadnt been initially attracted to Julien, probably for good reason.And now he had found somebody that sounded like a reasonable match, someone he could start a new life with in New York and forget all the dark history he left behind in Oceanside.It made all the sense in the world, whereas whatever brief little connection we shared seemed born out of mutual loneliness more than anything else.I thought about Isabellas story; how she had, at a young age, come to look at love as a business transaction.And then I thought about my good friend Gracies currently jaded point of view, that guys are, more or less, inherently evil.I didnt want to feel either of those things, no matter what.I didnt want the sum total of my experiencesstarting with Bradley and ending with this summerto be perpetual bitterness, although it would be hard to shake the bitterness for a while.Eventually, though, I wanted to be a person who believed in love, even if I thought I might never find it.Ten minutes passed before I stood up, calling an end to my pity party, partly because Id had enough for the moment and partly because it was 103 degrees and climbing outside.Bypassing the library, I walked to the Plex and headed straight for the message boards in the lobby.I needed a place to stay and a new job, ideally, and needed them yesterday, but the notices I found were mostly old, with the exception of one pet sitting gig that started the following week.I tore one tab from the posting, then all of them.I was back outside, taking the path that cut directly from the Plex to the library, when my day took another bizarre turn: in the distance, running around the quads periphery in short runners shorts and a matching tank top, was Liam, or someone who looked just like him.I raised my hand to shelter my eyes and stared at the man pointedly as he jogged around the other end of the lawn.It was certainly his bodyI could recognize that body anywherebut the face was obscured at this distance and the outfit threw me off.The runner was decked out in a pretty serious looking, neon accented ensemble, which would have been an odd choice for Liam, someone I hadnt known to be a runner.Whoever it was, they eventually noticed me and politely waved from a distance.Embarrassed that Id been caught staring, I turned and hurried toward the library, not bothering to wave back.On my way to my favorite copy machine, sequestered in the corner of the librarys third floor, I thought about what a strange summer it had been.I was ready for the wave that had washed me out into the abyss with Liam and gotten me caught up in the undertow with Julien to deposit me back on dry land.In fact, I started praying for it that night.* * * Second Tuesday in August: Oceanside Rec Center Meeting Topic of discussion: Sticking to Promises Calories imbibed: 1,550 I celebrated my first one month chip as the designated speaker at the rec center meeting.Although I had begun sharing over a month ago, it was still daunting to plant myself onstage in front of everyone, stay there for a solid five minutes, and talk only about me.I had collaborated with the moderator, Sherrill, on the days topic and had come prepared with a page full of notes in case I blanked, but I was still shaking like a leaf when she introduced me.Hi, everyone.I took a seat on the chair positioned in the middle of the low stage and placed my notes gingerly in my lap.Im Mischa, and Im an overeater.Hi, Mischa, they all responded.From this vantage point, I could see everyone in the room, but the looks on their faces were patient and accepting and I felt instantly reassured.I launched in, speaking quickly to avoid any awkward silences.So, Sticking to Promises.Thats todays topic and very relevant to me as I am just receiving my one month chip and feeling very happy that Ive been sober this long.Four and a half weeks to be exact But Im still on the fence about the Twelve Steps.Im not really sure why.At least for now its important for me not to feel pressure either way.Whats important is that I stick to the promises I make to myself, and Ive been doing a pretty good job of it.I needed to get out of a weird living situation and I did thatI got hired to pet sit for a professor whos away until December.Therere three cats and Im kind of allergic, but other than that its a pretty good deal.Also, I presented a product I developed to someone I used to work for, and shes thinking about investing, which is beyond what Id hoped for.Im trying not to get my hopes up too high but Ive been thinking about it a lot and am feeling pretty excited about it.Something that helps me stay sober, too, is taking care of my friend Isabella.She, unlike me, has needed to gain a lot of weight lately, so Ive been keeping a better eye on her, going by her house twice a week instead of just once, making sure the food I make her is really healthy but calorie dense.Oh, and the big one, obviously: I promised myself I would stop binging and eating my trigger foods, which are basically everything thats not healthyIm kind of a kitchen sink addict.So, for the last month, I have been sticking to that.Its been hard but it also feels really good Coming up for air, I scanned the room, suddenly blanking on what to say next.I glanced at Sherrill for the time, hoping she would tell me I had run out of it.You have four more minutes, she said with a knowing smile.Really?Wow.The look of surprise on my face prompted sympathetic laughter around the room.But instead of bolting offstage like I wanted to, I hunkered down and felt something relax inside me.I started to talk about the hard stuffabout my expectations of other people and how Id sometimes held others to higher standards than Id held myself.I admitted to various obsessions over the years, starting with Bradley and leading up to Liam and (briefly) Julien that summer, and talked about the significance of my dad leaving.I said I knew it was clich and people shook their heads kindly, reminding me that what I had to say was valid, even if it was their story toomaybe even more so because it was their story.I talked about my future and how grad school was still up in the air and how I felt Id always ignored my own needs out of fear, choosing to focus on other people instead.By the end of it, I felt like a 500 pound weight had been lifted off my shoulders, and my heart swelled with pride when Sherrill turned the discussion open to the group and everyone who spoke thanked me for my honesty.I even stayed afterward for a few minutes, although part of me wanted to hide away and recover from all the exposure.And precisely because I stuck around, a pretty girl who looked around my age approached with an expectant smile on her face.Hi, Im Monica.She offered her hand and I shook it.Hi!Mischa, I said, pointing to myself.Your share was great.Thanks!I really hate public speaking if you couldnt tell, I said.Yeah, me too.Hey, listenshe glanced behind her, as if she had some big secret to tell meI know were not supposed to do this since its anonymous and all.I was actually here well, this is my first time.I actually came for research for school.I told Sherrill, so its all on the up and up.Sure, of course.I sounded uncertain as I wondered what Monica was getting at.Anyway, like I said, I know its anonymous and all, but is there any way you can tell me if your last name is Jones?Uh who wants to know?I answered, worried she might be Liams longtime girlfriend or something equally terror inducing.Monica lowered her voice.Its just that Ive been working at the school, assisting in the Nutrition department, and youve been the first name on our waiting list for the grad program for a while now.And today we had someone drop out.Wait what?I shook my head like a cartoon character that had just been hit with an anvil.Im Mischa Jones.Thats me!Im her!I cried it out too loudly, too un anonymously, in a state of heart pounding excitement.Everyone turned to look at me, but I didnt care.So, yeah, I got an e mail tonight to call you first thing tomorrow Youre in.That is, if youre still interested.Are you kidding me?Yes!Beyond still interested.Oh my God.I threw my arms around herafter my curious stairwell incident with Donna Dixon, I had become much less averse to hugging complete strangers in publicand bounced up and down.Sorry, I apologized as I drew back.This is just the best news Ive heard all summer.Do I need to sign something?Of course I do, right?Monica laughed.Yeah.Just stop by the office.Ill let the dean know first thing.Wait is there a TA ship?I had almost forgotten to ask, but it was imperative.I wouldnt be able to swing graduate school otherwise.Yes.Its guaranteed for the first years, she happily reported.Aah!This time I actually jumped.I have to go call my mom!Monica, you are an angel sent from heaven.Dont let anybody tell you different, I said.In turn, she smiled big and shrugged modestly as I hurried out, waving and blowing her a melodramatic kiss.* * * I caught my mom sleepinga rarity, since she was such a night owl.Mom!I cried into the phone after her groggy, drawn out hello.Honey!What a nice surprise, she cooed, sounding drugged.I woke you up, I know it.But its worth itlisten, I got into Reid!I just found out!I go in tomorrow to sign!Honey!My mom gasped, rousing from her sleep state to join in my euphoria.This is amazing!See?I told you it would work out.Thank you so much, Mom.Why are you thanking me?Youre the one you should be thanking.No, I couldnt have done it without you.I love you so much.Im gonna come home for Thanksgiving, okay?I know, I know, I miss you too.And were going to celebrate the fact that Im gonna graduate and make something of myself before youre too old to care.This made her laugh.Ill never be too old for that, Fluffy.There was that nickname againback by unpopular demand.Instead of just letting it go this time, however, I decided to address it.Hey, Mom?Why do you always call me that?Call you what, hon?Fluffy, I said, a hint of disdain in my voice.Oh, gosh.When did that start?Lets see I guess it was back in Kenya, she said through a whimpery yawn.Back when your dad was working at the consulate there.You were three or four maybe, and there was a bunny on the property.You called it Fluffy and one day, you told me if you could be anything in the world, you would want to be that rabbit.I just thought that was so funny, I started calling you Fluffy.Wait, really?You were talking about a rabbit?Yeah, why?I shook my head, utterly shocked.I had never once considered that the nickname could have anything to do with something other than my weight.Really, the way I had interpreted it spoke so much more about how I saw myself than what my mother ever thought.I had just assumed, because she was so skinny, that I had been a disappointment, which she needed to remind me of on a regular basis with a funny, nitpicking little nickname.But I had never asked about it, not until that very moment.So instead I had assumed the worst about my own mother.The realization made me sad and happy at the same time.Why?she asked again.Oh, no reason, I said, making sure to pepper in a few more I love yous before letting her go back to sleep.The next person I called, naturally, was Gracie, who indulged me in a marathon phone fest that kept us both up way later than we needed.But she was happy to celebrate with me, especially because shed just been promoted to office manager, and with that came a paycheck slightly less laughable than her last.Look at us killin it, she said.I know.If I wasnt covered in cat hair, I might not believe this was my life.I wiped my nose, which prompted another sneeze.You can always move back in with you know who.Ha!No, that chapter is closed.Hey, have you seen that other guy?Whats his name?Liam?No, not really.Although its weird, I keep thinking I see him around town.The other day I thought he was two lanes over from me in traffic.And then I thought I saw him at the grocery store, but he was checking out with his back turned.A couple of weeks ago, I saw him on campus, running, and he waved.But I couldnt be sure it was him.Yeah, its funny, I see Richard everywhere, but Im usually wrong.I think thats just our brains working out the obsession.Cheers to that!I laughed, holding up my glass of water as Gracie, inevitably, held up her nightcap on the other end.Heres to our brains working out the obsessions.Amen, sister.Clink, she said.Clink, I repeated.Nineteen Summer in Oceanside literally goes out with a bang.On the last Friday in August, the mayor sets off a cannon outside the courthouse, which marks the beginning of Gator Gras, Oceansides weeklong version of Mardi Gras featuring the worlds biggest alligator cook off among other things.This year I was sad to find myself sans Gracie, who had always dragged me out on opening night, and decided to venture out on my own in her honor.I couldnt remember the last time Id had a drink or seen live music, and once classes began I could probably kiss a social life goodbye, at least for a while.I wandered into town with no expectations.I just figured Id catch the tail end of the parade, grab a beer, see whoever was playing at the pub, and call it a night.But when I wandered into the darkened bar that was hosting opening night festivities, I heard a familiar voice coming from the stage in back and nearly dropped when I realized it was Liam.My first thought was that I should run, or risk getting drawn back into his vortex.But my body, seemingly disconnected from my mind, stayed planted at the back of the crowd.He was strumming an acoustic guitar, seated alone onstage and singing a ballad.Desperate for a better view, I stood on my tiptoes and peered between the heads of the couple in front of me.The spotlight emphasized Liams late summer golden perfection.He looked tan and healthy, but still just the right amount of brooding and complex to twist my heart into perplexed little knots.The sound of his voice was mesmerizing.I had never been a groupie, but at this moment I saw the appeal, watching his fingers expertly move from chord to chord and his face contort with emotion.I closed my eyes and listened to the chorus:  There goes that girl again Im in a whirl again It takes an angel to wake the devil inside me And now shes gone again Ive done her wrong again It took an angel to slay the devil inside me  I opened my eyes and watched him repeat the chorus once more, half hoping that he was singing about me, but half terrified as well.The song was beautiful and tragic, the guitar lines plaintive, his gravelly voice bittersweet.Liams guitar eventually faded out and everyone around me started to applaud while I stood there in a trance.All the emotions I had felt when leaving his house that night I had put him to bed came rushing back.If only, if only, if only, I thought, imagining the perfect world in which we could be together.But then my reasoning kicked in, telling me that Liam looked this good and healthy after weeks of not seeing me.I was just as improved without him.It seemed obvious we were better off without each other, even if watching him bare his soul onstage made me ache with desire.Liam looked out into the crowd, scanning the room, and I panicked.A girl carrying two full beers knocked into me as she made her way toward the stage, and I felt a wet spot spreading on the back of my shirt.Its a sign, I thought.Go now before he sees you.Liams gazed drifted to my section of the crowd, and I turned, bolting past the bar and through the open door to the sidewalk littered with confetti from the parade.* * * Where are you taking me, Fluffy?Isabella looked worried as she peered out the passenger window of my car at a row of dilapidated ranch houses.To my drug dealers house, I joked.She pushed up the large, Audrey Hepburnstyle black sunglasses that had slid down her nose.Oh, please, Im officially too old for drugs and bad neighborhoods.Isabella was looking far better on her eighty sixth birthday than she had a month ago, and I was happy to know Id had a hand in it.Ever since that champagne drenched afternoon when Id made her a peanut butter smoothie and left it on her nightstand, she had been requesting them regularly and had even learned how to make them herself.It had given me the idea for a counter program to my cleanse that I was working on formulatinga smoothie only regimen for older women like her who could stand to add a few pounds.Of course, my juices had just started selling at Sashas spa, and expanding the brand wouldnt be an option until I saw how they were doing, but I needed something other than Liam to occupy my thoughts before fall semester began.I couldnt get that song out of my head, or the image of him onstage.I knew better than to act on it by now, but the crush had come creeping back all the same Ooh here we are, I said, spotting the address Id been searching for on a hot pink mailbox and turning into the driveway.Many things about my dear old friend still remained a mystery to meher political beliefs, what kind of music she liked, how exactly she had ended up in Oceansidebut something she had been very clear about from day one were her many superstitions.Like any good girly girl, Isabella loved astrology and psychics and crack theories about lunar cycles and their effects on the female brain.So when I found myself searching for the perfect gift for her eighty sixth, I decided to book a session with Sashas favorite psychic.The womans name (doubtfully by birth) was Mimi Lamar, and she had easily the nicest house on her not yet gentrified block.The lawn stood out as freshly cut and very green against the dry, yellowed grasses that bordered it.The home was a single story ranch, like the ones surrounding it, but the bricks were painted bright white and the shutters were a brilliant magenta.Hibiscus bushes with delicate white and pink flowers bordered the front walk.Well, hello there!Mimi greeted us from the front door as I helped Isabella out of the car.Who is she?Isabella whispered in my ear.Shes a psychic!I whispered back.What is she going to predict?The next five minutes before I keel over?Stop it.From the front stoop, Mimi ushered us inside, looking more Martha Stewart than Madame Zelda in her white capri pants and pink sweater set.We were directed to sit in her living room while she retrieved sweet teas for the three of us.Isabella nudged me as we sat side by side on the couch and I noticed the wicked smirk on her face as she studied its peony patterned upholstery.It looks like a florists shop exploded in here.Be nice!I said, unable to stop myself from smiling at her snarky humor.When she came back in and deposited our drinks on the coffee table, Mimi dragged a side chair up to Isabellas end of the couch and took a seat.Do you mind if I take your hand for a moment?she asked in a sweet, Southern lilt.Feigning indifference, Isabella offered her right hand and the psychic set about with her reading.Not surprisingly, it was hardly any time before my friend had been won over by Sashas soothsayer, and I was satisfied that my present was well chosen.Youre going to have one last great love, Mimi announced midway through the session, after shed brought out the tarot cards.Hes around you already.In your neighborhood.One of those old geezers?I dont think so.Isabella shook her head, disturbed.She came around, though, once Mimi identified the man as a younger visitor of the neighborhood, not an actual resident.Then Isabella happily jumped to the conclusion that her destined affair was with the Latino pool boy shed been admiring from afar during her weekly water aerobics class.Mimi didnt seem so convinced of the pool boy theory, but Isabella was dead set on it.What about you?Mimi glanced over at me at the end of the hour.No reading for you today?I shook my head and smiled politely, thinking she was crazy to assume I had more than $100 lying around.Well, I can tell youre in love, anyway.I could see that the moment you stepped out of the car.No, Im not, actually.Free and clear of all romantic entanglements, and feeling good about it.I smiled, hoping to convince both Mimi and myself.The feeling good about it part wasnt the most honest thing Id ever said, but I was in fake it till you make it mode.Mimi cocked her head to one side and reached for my hand.When I didnt immediately offer it, Isabella picked it up from my lap and handed it over.Closing her eyes, Mimi clasped my hand between hers.Ah okay, I see.Youve had a little heartache.But maybe something you didnt see as love actually was.Right.I rolled my eyes up to the pale pink ceiling, certain she was wrong.Who knows?Isabella chimed in.Im just warning you, Im usually right about the love thing, Mimi said.The proof is in the pudding.If I get this pool boy, Im calling you again.Isabella wagged a finger at Mimi, who chuckled and took a healthy swig of her iced tea.Later, Isabella would speculate that the tea was drugged, because by the end of it, she had started to believe everything the woman said.I, on the other hand, felt pretty confident her speculations were wrong.After all, I was as far away from in love as I had ever been and almost certain that was a good thing.* * * When classes started back up, I had the inevitable run in with Julien every once in a while, and thankfully our conversations got less and less awkward every time.I had officially come around to his logic about why he and I would never work, especially after Id seen him eating lunch at the Plex with the woman hed been dating.She was tall with the striking combination of straight, long, black hair and freckled, honey toned skin.She seemed shy and quirky, and they fit together in a way that he and I never did.They were comfortable, a little boring perhaps.I envisioned them having this same lunch in a park in New York, and that made even more sensea lively, urban backdrop for the staid couple of professors.At some point, Julien had appeared to catch me staring out of the corner of his eye, and like a spaz, I had snuck behind a tree, then run in the opposite direction.Later that week, I saw him on his way to the Carver Lecture Hall, and he told me Cecile missed me and had been talking about me like I was an old, estranged confidant.I was surprised to hear it but flattered, and I promised to come watch one of her basketball games once the season started.It was a terribly normal, mature exchange, and I silently congratulated myself as we parted ways, knowing I had come a long way since stumbling out of his office in tears and into the arms of Professor Donna Dixon, a woman Id never met before and had, mercifully, never seen again.* * * In my program, there were nine other studentsfour guys and five girlsand I was relieved to be the only one who had been at Reid for undergrad as well.Not only was I more comfortable from the get go, but I also became the de facto Oceanside expert, arranging little outings here and there for the other students who had come from everywhere but Florida.Hearing this, Gracie had accused me of suddenly morphing into a social butterfly and complained she wasnt there to witness it.About a month into fall semester, my classmates and I decided to celebrate the end of our first big assignment by throwing a bonfire on the beach, something I hadnt done since freshman year.Look at these stars!the Italian girl, Camilla, kept saying as she stood by the fire gazing upward, her marshmallow slowly petrifying on the end of the stick that dangled from her grip.What, they dont have stars like this in Italy?I asked.Well, of course, she responded in her heavy, singsong accent.Theyre better there, but I had low expectations for this place.Inspired by Camillas enthusiasm, we all took a moment, rolling our heads back to stare at the dark, silver specked canvas above us.I couldnt remember feeling so content.Then Rebecca, the easily distracted flirt from Mississippi, cried out, Whoa, incoming!and we all looked in the direction she was staring.Down the beach, an attractive male figure walked alongside the ocean, headed toward us.WaitI know him, I said.From your dreams?Rebecca replied with a chuckle.No, really.In a kind of daze, I dropped my marshmallow stick in the sand and made my way toward Liam at the waters edge.I couldnt ignore him this time.Bring him back here!Rebecca called after me, sounding like she was only half kidding.Liam recognized me as I approachedI could tell by his grin, a little nervous seeming.He pushed his hands inside his jeans pockets.Hey, I said, feeling my cheeks go red.Whether I liked it or not, he still had that effect on me.Hey.Liam kicked at the sand and glanced at me with a familiar twinkle in his eye.I thought that was you.I was thinking about coming up, but I didnt know if youd want to see me.You look really good, I said.And he did, just like he had onstage.His face was a little fuller even.He looked well rested, perhaps a few pounds heavier overall.Thanks.Ive been staying healthy, working out, all the boring stuff.What about you?You look amazing.I blushed.Liams compliment was the best thing Id heard in weeks, and it made me suddenly forget all the heartache hed caused.In fact, standing there on the beach with him, our little fling felt like ancient history.Im sorry about that text I sent.I was just trying to focus on me, I said.Please, you dont have to explain anything.I just wanted to reach out.I didnt expect anything.Liam kicked at the sand again.He seemed awkward and human, and I remembered how emotionally raw he had been the last time I saw him.Hey, do you wanna join us?I asked.Im just here with a bunch of other students in my program.Nutrition geeks.Theyll love that youre a chef.I dont know He glanced back at the ocean, leading me to think, for a split second, that he might turn me down.You got marshmallows over there?You bet, I said, and held out my hand.And then, like it was the most natural thing in the world, Liam took my hand and I led him back to the bonfire, where my new friends greeted him like he had just been named Peoples Sexiest Man Alive.Ever the extrovert, Rebecca put words to what everyone was thinking.Im sorry, but I have never seen anyone as good looking as you IRL.Do you actually exist?She reached out to touch him, and Liam played along like a good sport.Last time I checked.Whats your name again?Rebecca.Hi, Rebecca.He reached out to shake her hand and she pretended to faint.Forget it.Hes Australian, right?Camilla looked at Liam with an impish smile, and he nodded.Never go to bed with an Australian man, Rebecca.Theyre brutes!Oh right, because Italian men are soooo gentle, Rebecca countered, valiantly coming to Liams defense.I watched with amusement as the girls vied for Liams attention and the guys ruffled at his presence.The old me would have been jealous, but now I was just entertainedproud, even.Eventually, the group normalized and one of the boys, Marcus, suggested we play a game called Puppetmaster, which entailed inventing our own trivia questions and inflicting them on the group.The result was pretty hilarious, especially when the questions became more and more subjective and we were forced to answer things like: What time did I wake up this morning?or Which world leader is the healthiest eater?The game lasted until the marshmallows had run out and we finally declared the night over.Even then, nobody really wanted to go home.When the last of the fire had been extinguished, Liam walked with me to the dark and desolate looking parking lot and glanced around.I dont see your car, he said.No, I rode with Camilla.I nodded toward her old VW and she waved, waiting patiently for us to say our goodbyes.Let me walk you home.Liam smiled and nudged my arm with his elbow.What do you say?What do I say?Hmm My instinct was to say yes, of course, but I was working on my impulsive tendencies.For some reason, I had kind of assumed we would part ways after the bonfire, like a couple of old lovers who were resigned to never see each other again.Are you sure?I finally asked.I mean, I dont know what your situation is, but I dont want it to become some temptation.Thats not to say Im not assuming we would Im just remembering the last time He stopped me, amused at my fumbling.No, its fine, I promise.Let me walk you, Mischa.I smiled and scrunched up my nose, trying to fight the giddiness that threatened to overtake me.Wait one second.I held up an index finger as I broke away from him.At Camillas car I informed her, very self consciously, that Id be walking home with my old friend.In turn, she teasingly warned me again about Australian men, but I promised I wouldnt fall prey to his brutish charms.Yeah, yeah, you guys have already slept together.My jaw dropped.How are you so sure?Are you kidding me?The way he looks at you.With the eyes of a dog, she said.I laughed at Camillas odd choice of metaphor.It reminded me of one of Isabellas lost in translation moments.She threw her car door open and slipped inside.Its the truth!she called out as she rolled down the window, waving goodbye.I waved back and walked over to where Liam was waiting for me.I hadnt stopped giggling over Camillas comment.Whats so funny?he asked.Camilla said you look at me with the eyes of a dog.Smiling, he held out his arm and I took it.Well Im more polite than a dog, at least give me that.We started to leave the parking lot headed in the wrong direction, but I corrected our path, explaining that I had moved.Were actually closer to my new place than Juliens, I said, veering him in the right direction.So did you ever get off with that professor, then?Liam tugged at my arm.Excuse me?I glanced sideways at him, incredulous.I figured that was inevitable, no?Why would you think that?I was trying to act coy, but he had caught me off guard.Uh maybe because he looked at you with the eyes of a dog?I dunno.Ha ha, good one.So are you gonna answer me?I shook my head, smiling, knowing it would do neither of us any good to talk about Julien.Besides, I was too caught up in how invigorating it felt to walk with him like this, arm in arm.When Id found him on the beach, he had immediately seemed like such a different person than the one I had met outside the Baptist church that fated night, so much more calm and vulnerable.Youve changed, I remarked.So have you, he said, drawing my arm in closer to his body.As we moved inland, the air got balmier.I had been chilly at the beach, but now it felt like the perfect temperature outside.Passing through a strip mall parking lot, I gave Liam the short update on my lifehow Id started school and was selling my juice cleanse at Sashas spa and how I was cat sitting for a math professor through the end of the year.He told me about the menu changes at his restaurant and said his band had licensed their song for a British car commercial, and he hadnt had another drink since that night I had come to his house.At some point, he lowered his arm and took my hand in his, and I felt a rush of emotions that Id been trying to hold back.I thought I would never see you again, I confessed as we turned a corner onto a lamp lit street lined with beautiful cypress trees.I mean, not see you, see you.Actually, I did see you.That night you played at Gator Gras.Seriously?Liam stopped in his tracks.You were there?I nodded.You were amazing.I should have stayed and told you that.I just I guess I panicked, seeing you.I looked over at him.He shook his head, baffled, his eyes on the street ahead of us.I thought you might be there.I had this sense.There was this one songI wasnt gonna play it, but Id written it for you and I figured, if you heard it, you might forgive me.He laughed, his smile turning to a grimace.Silly romantic idea, huh?I did hear it, I said, knowing that the song he was talking about was the exact one I had heard.It stayed in my head for days, Liam.It was beautiful.He smiled and looked over at me, his eyes twinkling again.He tugged my arm and we started to walk.The way I acted that last night you saw me was embarrassing.I wanted to reach out, even before I sent the text, but I had no idea what to say or how to say it.I missed you, but at the same time, I was in such a miserable place.I wish I could say that night was my rock bottom, but a couple years back I was even worse if you can imagine.He chuckled.There was an anxiousness to his laugh.I need to tell you something, though.I want to say that Im sorry.Its okay, I rushed to answer.No, its not.I dragged you into my shit and yelled at you for no reason.I hardly remember that night.Im sure I dont even know the worst of it.I think the guitars got the worst of it, I joked.Liam laced his fingers through mine, gripping my hand a little tighter.I like you, Mischa.I like you, too I think.You think?I know.I leaned into him playfully, and he nudged me with his hip.But where does that get us?It gets us here, obviously, he said with a cryptic wink.You know Ive told you things I never told anybody else.Ditto, I said, giving his hand a squeeze.It was a nice feeling, walking and talking like this after everything that had transpired between us, but suddenly the fear struck me that I knew where this conversation was going.I dont think I can be your friend, Liam, if thats what youre thinking.He glanced at me sideways, taken aback.As much as Id like to say I could, I dont think Id handle it very well.I gave him my best attempt at a smile and pointed to a street sign one block away.Thats my street.There was a long gap of silence as we kept walking, the sound of our footsteps pattering against the sidewalk in unison.In another block and a half, we reached the house where I was staying and I lamented having to say goodbye.Id invite you inside, but theres three emotionally needy cats in there, and they are not interested in vying with anyone else for my attention.I wouldnt dream of coming in.Oh, I said.I pretended not to be hurt, but of course it stung a little to hear it.I still wanted him to want me.Liam kept walking alongside me all the way to the front steps of the house, where he tapped lightly on my shoulder, and I turned to face him.Listen, Mischa, I dont want to be your friend either.I nodded, whisking a stray hair away from my face.It was fun while it lasted, I guess.All two hours of it.No, thats not what I meant.I mean, I want to be something else to you.Something I havent tried in a long time.I blinked as if I hadnt heard him correctly.A million sensations rushed through me simultaneously as I stood across from him: exhilaration, happiness, terror, anxiety, even sadness.But the dominant voice inside my head was a hopeful one: Is he saying what I think hes saying?Im not saying Ive become a different person, Liam continued.Im still the same fucked up guy you met.But Im really trying now.He paused for a breath, exhaling loudly.I couldnt believe this man could seem so nervous to tell me something.You know that night at the spa?I felt like I really connected with someone for the first time in a long time, and it scared me to death.I felt like, what good is it when I have nothing to offer this girl?When Im broken?I reached out for his hands and took them in mine.Youre not broken, I whispered.I havent had sex since I was with you.Im trying to make it till the New Year.I nodded in encouragement.Thats great.I just dont know what you could want from me, then.In retrospect, it was a horribly insecure thing to say, but I couldnt see past our sexual history to what else might become of us.Heres what I want, Mischa.Tonight, I want to kiss you good night.And then next week, I want to take you on a proper date.And then I want to keep doing that.And we can get to know each other that way, with our clothes on.And then, hopefully, youll see who I really am and hopefully it wont scare you.And as hard as it might be, we wont have sex for a while.What do you think about that?Liam flashed the most brilliant smile I had ever seen, and I matched it.Umm My mind was all over the place.I could hardly think straight enough to answer.I would like that, I finally said.I just Im in a really good place right now, and I dont want to mess it up.I dont want to mess it up either.He pulled me toward him and gave my forehead a sweet little peck.No, but seriously, I insisted, trying to keep my wits about me as his magnetic pull worked its magic.I know, I know, he said.Same with me.Listen, if its not good, we cut bait.Its as easy as that.I nodded.Right.It feels good to be realistic about things every once in a while.Doesnt it?He laughed, then pointed behind me, up at the sky.Look!Do you see that?I swear that was a shooting star.I turned to look but saw nothing.Huh, no.Or a comet.Or a meteor shower.I dont know, but it was definitely something.We should make a wish, he said.Hey!We were just talking about being realistic!I poked his chest playfully.Oh, cmon.Liam closed his eyes and moved his lips as he made a silent wish.Fine.I closed my own eyes and searched my brain, only to realize that I had nothing to wish for in that moment.As I reopened my eyes and saw Liam standing before me, I felt woozy with affection.I figured his sudden reemergence into my life wasnt going to fully sink in for quite some time, but I wanted to revel in the newness of this moment for as long as I could.I drifted a little closer to him, and he leaned in to kiss me.As our lips met, the thrill of a thousand kisses flooded the synapses in my brain.Liams hands found my waist as I reached up for his shoulders, and he leaned me backward as if he were about to dip me.I felt like the movie star version of myself.When our lips finally parted and our tongues met, everything was soft and sweet and perfect.If someone were to hit a pause button on my life at that very moment, asking me to describe how I felt, I would have said something terribly melodramatic and clichd, but it would have been true.I would have told them I felt like I was walking on air or like I had been set free.I would have explained all the future plans that were running through my head, the things I wanted to do and see with Liam and all the late night conversations I envisioned us having as we got to know each other with our clothes on.I would have said that for the first time since I was eight years old, everything in my life felt perfect and whole in a completely unexpected way that I couldnt have seen coming in a million years.I would have admitted that Mimi Lamar, Sashas trusty psychic, had somehow diagnosed me correctly when she had said I was in love but that I didnt know it at the time, and maybe that meant Isabella was going to get her pool boy after all.I could also describe my state in that very moment by saying how I didnt feel anymorewhich was afraid.After twenty two years, I had finally learned how to stand beside myself, to support myself and take comfort in my little army of one.In fact, for the first time that I could remember, I didnt feel like somebody or something else had this crazy power over me that I couldnt control.Whether or not things worked out with Liam, I knew it wouldnt be the end of the world because there was no more fear of abandonment in the deepest depths of my heart.At the end of the day, I wasnt hungry, or fragile, or wounded, or panicked.I wasnt anxious.I wasnt tragic.And best of all, I wasnt lonely not because I had Liam, but because I had me.
