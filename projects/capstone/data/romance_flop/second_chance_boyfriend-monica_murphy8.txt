Yeah.I wish she would drop the damn comforter so I can touch her for real.It was my dad.I guess the divorce is back on.Her hands still.And thats a good thing, right?Definitely.I want her out of our lives for good.Theres been a lot of back and forth, though.I dont know if I believe him.What happened to make him want the divorce again?she asks.He caught her cheating on him.As in, he followed her and watched her hook up with a guy, then confronted her.Dads acting like a man possessed, but I guess when a persons been wronged so completely by the one he loves, that person can tend to do crazy things.Wow.Sounds awful.I know.My dadhes really upset.I smooth my hand over her hair, trying to tame the wayward strands.I desperately want to change the subject.You look pretty in my comforter.Fable rolls her eyes, but her cheeks turn a delicate pink.I think youd say I look pretty in anything.Youre right.If I could, I would forget about all of my problems and lose myself in her.Shes the only thing that feels right and normal in my entire universe.I should go, she says softly.I promised Owen Id be home when hes done with school.Plus Im going out with Jen tonight and I need to get ready.Jealousy flares in my gut and I tamp it down.Im being ridiculous.Like a macho asshole who never wants to lose sight of his woman, and thats not cool.I trust her.I just dont trust any other guy who gets near her.I mean, look at her.Shes beautiful and shes all mine.One mistake on my part, though, and I could lose her.Look at what happened last night.I push last nights argument firmly out of my mind.Dwelling on my mistakes is pointless.Okay.I kiss the tip of her nose.How did you get here, anyway?She shrugs, a little smile curving her lips.Jen came by my apartment to pick me up earlier so I could go get my paycheck from the restaurant.Once I was there, I jogged over.You jogged?I had no idea she had it in her.Though her body is bangin, theres no denying it, shes never mentioned she likes to run.Of course, theres plenty I dont know about Fable.Shes still a mystery to me.One I want to examine and take apart, learn every bit of piece by piece.Yeah.She leans in and presses her lips to the center of my chest.My heart skips a beat, as if it could literally feel her kiss.I have all sorts of secret talents.Ill say, I mutter, enthralled with the way shes touching me.So easily, as if weve been together forever.Laughing, she withdraws from me and starts toward my bedroom.Maybe if youre lucky youll discover more of my secret talents later tonight, she calls from over her shoulder.I frown.What are you talking about?More laughter.The musical sound washes over me, filling me with happiness.Youll see.Im left still pondering that remark hours after she leaves.Fable I feel good.The best I have in ages.Jen and I went out to dinner at some new place downtown where they serve the best appetizers ever.We laughed and laughed as we gushed over the delicious food, knowing Colin would absolutely kill us if he caught us in there.We were coconspirators, and that was fun.The only time Ive ever felt truly part of a team is with Owen and somewhat with Drew.With Drew, our relationship is still so new, so fragile, Im afraid sometimes to push too hard.Tonight, I plan on pushing hard.Tonight, I feel free.So tell me more about your hunkalicious boyfriend.Jens dark eyes are sparkling.Were at one of the local college hangouts.Its two stories, the bottom level a very casual restaurant/burger joint, the top level a huge bar and dance floor.They dont let anyone underage upstairs, which totally bums me out.Im literally writhing where I sit in the booth, my body overtaken by the muted throbbing beat that comes from upstairs.What do you want to know?I play coy on purpose, stirring my straw in my glass of soda.I sort of wish for harder stuff.Jens a little buzzedI can see it in the flush in her face, the light in her eyes.Im less than six months away from my twenty first birthday, and not that Im a party girl or anything, but itll be nice to be able to booze it up whenever I want.Howd you meet?Such a simple question that requires a not so simple answer.Its sort of hard to explain.Hes gorgeous, you know.And popular as hell, you little shit.You told me he was no one I knew.Everyone in town knows Drew Callahan.Jen sips from her drink, her lips curved in a smirk.Is he amazing in bed, or what?Jen gets a little liquored up and shes making all sorts of crazy statements.I dont even know how to answer that.Im used to girls accusing me of stealing their boyfriends, not of friends asking how my boyfriend is in bed.Your cheeks are red, so Im guessing the answer is unbelievable.Jen shakes her head, a wistful expression on her face.I miss sex.Im taken aback.I totally had it pegged that she and Colin were doing the nasty, as my brother so eloquently states it.By that statement, I guess youre not having it?Nope.Jen shakes her head.I know what youre thinking.I bet you assumed Colin and I are together.I still say nothing, not wanting to voice my suspicions.Well, were not.Hes just a friend.She glances around, as though someones lurking in the background and might hear us.If I told you something, would you promise to keep it a secret?Sure.I swear I have a sign around my neck that says excellent secret keeper.Jen leans across the table ominously and lowers her voice.Colin was my older brothers best friend.I frown.Was?A pained expression crosses her face.My brother died.In Iraq.Oh.I reach across the table and give her hand a squeeze.Im so sorry.She shrugs, though the hurt is still in her gaze.It was a few years ago, and everyone was completely devastated, especially Colin.Dannys deaththrew my family completely off.We all splintered apart and I ended up running away.I couldnt go back home.There was just no way I could stay there with all that pain and misery surrounding me.So I ended up here.Working dead end jobs, trying to keep my head above water.Sounds familiar.At least Im not alone.Im thankful for having Owen, and even my mom to a point.Shes awful, but she hasnt flat out deserted us.I was working one night a few months ago and Colin justwalked in.Like out of nowhere.Told me hed been looking for me, he had a job lined up and a place to stay if I wanted it.I figured he worked for The District, you know?Was like the restaurant manager or whatever.When I realized he owned the placethat he owns multiple restaurants and hes filthy richI couldnt believe it.Hes done so much with his life.The dreamy look on Jens face was unmistakable.Shes crushing majorly on her dead brothers best friend.I freaking knew it.I just didnt realize they had a past connection.A really strong connection that runs deep.Are you in love with him?I ask quietly.What?No!Jen shakes her head, trying her best to make a quick recovery.But I know a liar when I see one.Hes like family to me.Like another big brother, she insists, her eyes locking with mine.Dont tell anyone, okay?I dont want any of the girls at the restaurant to know.Plus, Colin doesnt want anyone to know either.He doesnt want to look like he plays favorites.But you live with him.Everyone knows it.Hes done this sort of thing before.Letting his employees live with him.She shrugs.He just wants to make sure everyones okay and has a roof over their head.He asked me about you, wanted to make sure you werent living in a shack somewhere.He knows where I live.I proceeded to tell her how he texted me, then came by my place to pick me up.See how nice he is?He just wanted to help you out.Jens so enamored of Colin he can do no wrong.I always wondered at his motives with me.Not that he was ever sleazy, but he was certainly extra attentive.Far more attentive than any other boss Ive ever had.But maybe Jen is right.Maybe he looks out for those he worries about.I cant fault him for that.Hes like a protective big brother.Enough talking about me.Lets talk about you and your sexy boyfriend.Jen grabs her glass and sips from her drink, all easy breezy again.Im surprised he let you out of his sights tonight.I deserve a girls night out, dont you think?Of course you do.So do I.  So does every girl.Jen grins when the music changes to a fast, heavy beat that has me moving in my seat again.Did I happen to mention I know the bouncer upstairs?No.Really?I stop seat dancing.Think hed let me in up there?As long as you promise not to order anything from the bar, I bet I could convince him.Jen laughs when I clap my hands in excitement.I didnt figure you for a dancer, Fable.I love to dance.I just rarely do.When do I have time to go out clubbing?Oh, and who with?I work a lot, so I dont get out much.Well, let me work my magic and get you in there.This should be fun.Jen whips her phone out of her pocket and starts texting, presumably the bouncer upstairs.I glance around the room, waiting anxiously for her to figure out a plan.Shes so nice, so easygoing and fun.Im so glad I agreed to go out with her tonight.I needed this.Needed a taste of freedom, a taste of friendship.Noticing Jens still tapping away at her keyboard, I pull my phone out and send off a quick text to Drew.He replies within seconds.Having fun?As much as I can without you here.Which is sort of the truth.All of a sudden, I miss him.Give me a break.I smile as I type a question.Do you like to dance?Not really.I laugh softly.Im not surprised.He is so not the dancing type.The bouncer can get us in, Jen says, breaking through my Drew induced mental fog.I glance up from my phone with a grin.Youre kidding.Nope.But we need to get up there now, before the floor fills up and they start turning people away.Jen tilts her head toward my hand, where Im clutching my phone.Texting Hunkalicious?Why does everyone call Drew nicknames?Owen and Lover Boy.Jen and Hunkalicious.I should call him something like Drew Bear or Drew bee.Something silly and dumb and just for me.Hed probably die of mortification if I tried.Maybe, I say with a shrug.She smiles.You should have him come pick you up.But what about you?Jen shrugs.Im going to swing by the restaurant before I go home.Colin just messaged me and asked me if I would.Ah, I get it.Colin snaps his fingers and Jen comes running.I can sort of relate.Focusing all my attention on my phone again, I type out a quick message to my hunkalicious boyfriend.You should come and watch me dance.Where are you?I tell him, ending it with, Want me to tell you what Im wearing so you can find me?Baby, I could find you anywhere is his immediate reply.Smiling so hard my cheeks hurt, I tuck my phone into the front pocket of my jeans and smile at Jen.Lets go upstairs.The real lover is the man who can thrill you by kissing your forehead or smiling into your eyes or just staring into space.Marilyn Monroe  Fable The room is small and dark, jam packed with people.I can hardly move, its so crowded, but I dont care.Ive got my arms above my head and my hands in the air, the lights that hang over us flashing in time to the beat of the music.Im dancing my ass off, my hair sweaty, my legs aching.Such a great night, Im overwhelmed with how much fun Im having.I feel fucking fantastic.Jen is dancing with me and shes surprisingly good, full of an innate rhythm that encourages me to step up my game.A group of guys crowded around us earlier, trying to get us to dance with them, but we turned in to each other, like we were on some sort of date.I wanted to discourage them and she did, too, so thankfully we were on the same page.We danced together, bumping and grinding against each other a little bit because shes buzzed and so am I, though not on alcohol.For once in my life, everything feels right on track.Like nothing is standing in my way.Ive turned into a total clich again.But this time Im a positive one.I might start singing cheesy eighties anthems because I feel like nothings gonna stop me now and all that crap.The guys step back and form a semicircle around Jen and me as we dance, hooting and hollering and generally acting like perverts.We encourage them, swaying our hips, thrusting out our chests.Im not even dressed that sexily.I went for casual with my jeans and a cute plaid shirt I found on clearance at Target, leaving it open with a white tank underneath.Casually cute, I guess, because who am I trying to impress?Originally, my guy wasnt supposed to be here.He still isnt here.Another song comes on, this one slow, and everyone on the floor seems to vacate all at once.Jen and I send each other a silent message and we exit the dance floor as well, heading toward the bar.Jen scoots her skinny ass in between a crowd of people and somehow garners the bartenders immediate attention, ordering us both a glass of ice water.When she finally hands me the drink I chug it, the cold water soothing my parched throat.The lights have gone completely dim as a few couples slow dance together, most of them hardly moving, their feet shuffling as they focus on groping each other instead.Im thankful for the break, but I also miss Drew.Seeing the dancing couples lights a deep yearning within me.Weve been dancing for over an hour.I thought he would be here by now, so where is he?I need to get going soon.Jen pushes her damp hair away from her forehead.Is your boyfriend coming to get you or what?I thought so.I glance around the room but I cant see anything.Its too damn dark.Huh.She sips her drink.No way am I leaving you here alone waiting for him.I can drive you home.You dont have to Jen cuts me off.I picked you up; I can definitely take you home.Dont worry about it.Cool.Thanks.I nod once, my shoulders stiff.I refuse to be disappointed.I also refuse to text him.He knows exactly where Im at, so what the hell is taking him so long?Maybe his dad called him again and needed to talk.Maybe he was going through a tough time over his dads anguish with the divorce and Im being completely selfish wondering where he is.Maybe Let me finish my drink and Ill be ready to go, Jen says, interrupting my thoughts.Okay.I drain my ice water and set the glass on a nearby table, ignoring the girls sitting there, who shoot me a dirty look.Though it was probably rude, what I just did, I couldnt care less.Im irritable.Theyre whispering loudly, probably griping about me and hoping to catch my attention, but I ignore them.I dont need a bunch of catty bitches crap tonight.The song ends and the lights brighten, flooding the dance floor.One of the most popular songs on the charts comes blasting on and everyone heads out to the floor, including Jen and me since we got caught up in the mass wave.One more dance!she shouts at me, and I nod in agreement.The insult girls are dancing close by, shooting Jen and me rude glares, and I turn my back to them, trying my best to enjoy this last song.My nerves are shot, though.The mean girls killed my buzz and I shouldve insisted on leaving before the song started.But Jens into the music, a giant smile on her face as she waves her hands in the air like she just dont care, yo.I smile at my own mental joke and throw my hands up in the air, mimicking her.The music slowly starts to work its magic, taking me over until all I can feel is the pulse of the bass and the heartfelt lyrics running through my mind.Im about to be completely swept away with the chorus when I hear one of the mean girls gasp behind me.No way!Is that Drew Callahan?Glancing over my shoulder, I catch sight of him standing on the opposite side of the room near the door, as if hed just entered.Hes squinting as he scans the room, searching for me, no doubt, which sends a flutter of anticipating nerves through my body.He looks cute as hell in a white long sleeve shirt with a button placket at the neck, the sleeves pushed up to reveal his strong, sexy forearms.And jeans, of course, that mold to his thighs and remind me of just how muscular they are.His hair is hanging in his eyes and he pushes it away, flicking his head in irritation.Pressing my lips together, I want to sigh like a little schoolgirl with my first crush.My man is so damn fine I can hardly stand it.He still hasnt found me, though.In fact, he looks mighty irritated as he pushes through the crowd, his gaze constantly scanning, and a warm sensation washes over me as I keep moving, my attention half on the girls gushing about Drew and watching him.He never goes anywhere, one of the girls says.God, hes so fucking gorgeous it hurts just looking at him.Im tempted to turn and scratch her eyes out, but I restrain myself.After all, Im the one who had him naked and between my legs earlier today.Drew Callahan belongs to me.Oh my God, hes looking this way!another one screeches.Hes staring right at me and I can feel the sizzle of his smoldering gaze from clear across the room.Tossing my hair over my shoulder, I send him a sultry smile, hoping like crazy I dont look like a fool.Drew sends me a delicious smile right back.But he doesnt come toward me.I can still hear those girls going on and on about him.They need to know hes mine.Im desperate for them to know hes mine.So I watch him.And I want him.But no way am I going to approach him.He has to come and get me first.Your boyfriend is here!Jen shouts in my ear.Nodding, I never take my eyes off of him as I continue to dance to the throbbing beat.I know!I shout back.Hes looking at you like he wants to gobble you up.Jen laughs as she moves away from me.Heat flares between my legs.He is totally looking at me like he wants to eat me up.Unable to stand it, I crook my finger and give him the age old sign that I want him to come to me.Look, hes coming this way!One of the mean girls screams as he makes his way across the crowded dance floor straight toward me.I wait in breathless anticipation as he approaches.Hes taller than most of the people here and he stands out.Or maybe thats because I notice no one else but him.The way that white shirt hes wearing stretches across his shoulders and chest.How much I love his longer hair.The way hes looking at me when he stops directly in front of me, his gaze dropping to my mouth for one hot, lingering moment before he lifts his lids to meet my gaze.Hi, he says, but I can hardly hear him.Its more like I have to read his lips.His sexy, gorgeous, irresistible lips.So I loop my arms around his neck and give him a sweet kiss on that irresistible mouth.Hi, I whisper, my lips brushing his.He settles those big hands on my butt and tugs me closer.I can literally hear the horrified gasps coming from the group of mean girls standing behind us, and I hang my head back and laugh triumphantly.It feels really good to be the girl who gets the guy for once.Drew It took me forever to escape my apartment.Dad called twice to gripe about Adele and whatever else she was doing.I didnt want to hear it.But I sensed that he needed to unload, and so I let him.Until finally I checked the time and realized Fable was probably waiting for me at that stupid club shes at.Shes probably good and pissed at me for keeping her waiting, too.I finally drive myself over there and get inside, which is no small feat.I had to promise I was only going in to snag my girlfriend out of there and then we were leaving.The line to get in was huge.The guy manning the door figured out who I was real quick and was a major football fan, so I lucked out.Now I have a warm, sexy woman in my arms, smiling up at me like Im Gods gift.Shes snug against me, her fingers playing in my hair at the nape, her body still moving to the music.Driving me out of my mind.I thought you werent going to show!she yells at me.The music is so loud I can barely hear her.Leaning in close, I murmur in her ear, Sorry, my dad kept calling.She nods, her fragrant hair brushing against my cheek, making me inhale sharply.I wondered if that was the case.The friend shes with touches Fable on the arm and tells her she needs to go.We both wave at her and she leaves, threading through the crowd until it swallows her up.The song changes, still fast though not as hyped up as the previous one, and Fable swivels her hips, the smile on her face alluring.Sexy as hell.I missed you.She brushes her chest against mine and I feel like Im going to shatter.Both from being turned on and the earlier tension I dealt with over the stupid divorce.I wish he hadnt called.He ruined my mood.My girl senses it, too.Her smile turns into a frown.Whats wrong?I shrug, not wanting to dwell on a bunch of bullshit tonight.I want to focus only on her.Im absorbing other peoples problems and stress, which I know is ridiculous but I cant help it.Her frown softens but its still there.She probably feels sorry for me and I dont want her to.I want her free and beautiful and flirtatious.Fable behaving like this makes me feel free.I can help you with that, she says, her voice full of promise.I dip my head to hear her better.You can?Oh, yeah.You need to learn how to let go of all your troubles.She whispers the words in my ear, the sound of her sexy voice sending a jolt of lust straight through me.You chasing me here is the first step.I settle my hands on her hips and pull her in closer.The music is loud, the room is stifling, and the crowd is thick.But with Fables arms slung around my neck, her body close to mine, its as if were the only two people in this room.First step to what?I ask, confused.My brain fries when Im with her.She trails her fingers lightly down my nape and I shiver.First step to acting like two normal people who are madly in love and cant keep their hands off each other, she murmurs right before she kisses me.I drown in the taste of her, in the feel of her sinful body snug against me.I slide my hands back and forth over her ass and she whimpers, the sexy little sound sending a zing straight through me, making me hard.Damn.I want out of here.Its too public, too crazy to indulge like this with her.Were completely surrounded by people and the song changes yet again, to a popular song thats been overplayed on the radio, though no one here seems to care.Including my girl.Shes withdrawn completely from my arms, a little smile teasing her kiss swollen lips, and she starts moving to the beat.Dance with me, she shouts over the music.I slowly shake my head, my gaze dropping to her hips.The way she moves, as if she were born to dance.She knows Im watching, too, and she puts on a show, just for me.I watch the sway of her hips in those too tight jeans, how she thrusts her chest out as she lifts her arms above her head.The white lace of her bra peeks above the neckline of the tank shes wearing beneath the plaid button down shirt and without thought, I grab her.Let my hands rest on her waist as she moves against me.You dont dance?She arches a brow and I do the same in return as my answer, standing completely still while she keeps moving.Her hips shift beneath my palms and she turns around, brushing her ass against my front, making me harder.Glancing over her shoulder, she offers me a sultry smile but doesnt say a word.Just keeps dancing while I keep my hands on her.I pull her closer.Closer still until her back is nestled to my front and I slip my arms completely around her, my hands pressed flat against her stomach.I smooth them down, to the tops of her thighs, and I swear I feel her tremble beneath my touch.She looks up at me, her eyes gone wide, her lips glistening as if she just licked them.Weve been playing a game since I got here and Im ready to claim my prize.Her.Shes all I want.All Ill ever want.I never believed in the fairy tale, even when I was a little kid.My life has been full of tragedy since my mom died.My illusions were shattered completely when I was fifteen years old.I became such a shell of my old self, I never believed anyone could truly accept and love me.It sounded pitiful when I admitted to Dr.Harris that I firmly believed I would go through my entire life alone, but it was the truth.I felt completely unlovable.Disgusting.Shameful.Being with Fable, all of those old, harsh feelings are slowly evaporating.She loves me for me.She knows every single dark and horrible thing thats happened to me in my life and she doesnt care.She wants to help me, stand by me, be there for me no matter what.She flat out wantsme.Im probably thinking too fast, wanting to move way, way too fast for her comfort, but having Fable in my arms at this very moment, smiling up at me from over her shoulder, I know without a doubt that this is the girl I want by my side forever.Shes embedded herself so completely into my life and my heart, I cant imagine being without her.Its just that simple and that complicated, all at once.Lets get out of here, I whisper in her ear and she nods once, her hair brushing against my face.She smells amazing, her cheeks are flushed, and all I can think is how fast can I get her home so I can have her naked beneath me.Taking her hand, I start to guide her off the dance floor, noticing a group of obvious sorority girls watching us as we go.Fable turns and flips them the bird, sticking her tongue out at them, and I yank on her hand hard to get her out of there before she starts a fight.What the hell was that for?I ask her as we walk down the back stairs and push open the door that leads out into the parking lot.They were giving me shit.Saying catty stuff about me.Next thing I know, you walk into the room, and they all flip out.She smiles and squeezes my hand.They thought you were smiling at them but really you were smiling at me.I shake my head.Who gives a shit what they think?Me.I do.Im always looked down upon.Theyre practically creaming their panties over the fact that you showed up and I loved knowing you didnt give a shit about them.You came there for me.She pulls me to her and lifts up on tiptoe so she can kiss my cheek.Letting everyone know youre mine makes me feel good.I feel exactly the same way.I entwine my fingers through hers, and we walk toward my truck quietly, my mind racing.How do I tell her I want her in my life for always?Should I even bring it up, or would it scare the crap out of her?The last thing I want to do is put pressure on her.But I dont want to lose Fable either.I hit the keyless remote and the doors unlock, both of us slipping inside the trucks cab.Fable pulls her cell out of her pocket, a little gasp escaping her as she hits a button on the screen to make a call.Where are you?she asks the moment whoever is on the other end answers.What do you mean the place is empty?I watch her, see the worry and concern wash over her face, the way she white knuckle grips the phone as she holds it to her ear.My skin prickles with uncertainty and Im curious as hell over whats happening and who shes talking to.Knowing whatever it is, it cant be good.Ill be right there.Yeah, Im with Drew.Ill have him drive me straight over, okay?So dont leave.She pauses.Ten minutes, tops.Stop panicking, Owen.Well be there.She ends the call and turns to look at me, her eyes wide with fear.Owens at the apartment.He says its empty.I frown.What do you mean, its empty?Like almost everything is gone except some of our personal stuff.The furniture, all our things, the food in the kitchenits all gone.She nibbles on her lower lip, lost in thought.Were you guys robbed?I can hardly wrap my head around what she said.It made no sense.No, no way.She shakes her head and laughs, though shes definitely not amused.More like she sounds distraught.I thinkI think my mom did it.I bet she packed up all her shit, had her loser boyfriend help her, and moved everything out without telling us.I grimace as I pull out of the parking lot and turn toward Fables place.Who the hell does that sort of thing?My mother.She leans her head back against the headrest and sighs.I told you how I wanted to move out and take Owen with me, but I hadnt gathered up the courage to tell her yet.Guess she took care of that, didnt she?But what youre saying, its like sheabandoned you.She abandoned us both a long time ago.Ive come to terms with it.Owen hasnt.He still believes our mom loves us and wants to take care of us.Hes young; hell figure it out someday.The bitterness in Fables voice makes me hurt for her.We both come from really screwed up situations.With parents who dont seem to give a shit about us, but in radically different ways.I wish I could help heal her heart.She may say the way her mother treats her and Owen doesnt bother her, but I know she has to be lying.It probably hurts like hell.My fathers indifference and neglect hurts me to this day.My moms deathI sometimes feel like she abandoned me, and it wasnt even her fault.Thats how irrational my thinking is.And I cant even go into what Adeles done to me.Im completely fucked up from the mind games she played on me for far too long.The moment we pull into a parking slot, Fables already out of the truck, running toward her apartment building.I follow behind her, taking a little more time, only because I want her to get in a few private moments with her brother first.When I finally walk into the apartment, Im shocked.The place is literally empty.No furniture remains in the living room.The table and chairs are gone from the small dining nook.Every cabinet door is hanging open in the kitchen.Owen and Fable are leaning against the kitchen counter.She has her arms around him and his face is pressed against her shoulder.Tears are streaming down her face, but she doesnt look sad.She looks majorly pissed.I hate her, she says vehemently.I cant believe she would do this.She took my bed, Drew.She took Owens, too.And all the furniture in our rooms.They dumped out all our stuff that was in the drawers and left everything in a pile on the floor.How could she have done this, hauled everything out of here so fast?I glance around the empty room, amazed that everythings gone.Ive only been inside her apartment once, but I remember it crammed with a bunch of stuff.She has friends.Or Im sure her loser boyfriend has a ton of friends.I bet they plied them with beer and they hauled everything out as fast as they could.She shakes her head.Owen and I both left before six.And its past eleven now.So they had at least five hours.Its amazing how fast you can work when you need to.Her mouth screws up into an angry twist.My arms literally ache to comfort her.Pull her into a hug and tell her everythings going to be okay.But shes too busy taking care of her brother, and right now hes her number one priority.Feeling helpless, I walk down the hall and glance into Fables room.Theres nothing but a pile of clothes and miscellaneous stuff lying on the floor, as shed mentioned.Same with Owens room, though his is an incredible mess.Her moms room is completely empty.This is truly some of the craziest shit Ive ever seen.An idea comes over me so perfect I stride back into the living area, excited to tell her.Its the perfect solution to their now very major problem.I want you to move in with me.True love isnt easy, but it must be fought for.Once you find it, it can never be replaced.Unknown  Fable Shock washes over me at Drews words.You cant be serious.Owen pulls out of my embrace, his body stiff.His eyes are swollen and his cheeks red from the crying.He was in a total state of panic when he called.So freaked out over what Mom did, I could hardly understand him at first.Im dead serious.Drew takes a few steps toward me but stops just before he reaches me.He can probably feel Owens animosity.Its rolling off him in huge waves.I have the space.Owen can even have his own room.Where will Fabes sleep?Owen asks, his look pointed, his expression fiercely protective.I rest my hand on his tense arm.Stop.Drew is trying to be nice.Or hes just using you for free sex.Maybe make you his little woman once you move in with him and not let you go anywhere or do anything.Dont do it.I dont want to move in with him, Owen says vehemently.I dont quite understand Owens hostility.Though maybe it all stems from when I was an emotional wreck after I came back from Carmel and Drew ditched me.Hes run before Just like Mom.Im tempted, though.So, so tempted to say yes.But I need to prove my independence, not move from my moms to Drews without ever experiencing time living on my own.You dont have to make the decision now, Drew says softly, his gaze pleading.But you dont want to stay the night here.The place is empty.There isnt even a bed to sleep on.Hes right.Even though I know Mom is responsible for taking everything and we werent robbed, Id feel creepy staying the night here.The apartment feels too hollow.Almost violated.I dont want to stay here, I murmur to Owen, grabbing his hand and squeezing it.Besides, we have nowhere else to go.Drews apartment is nice and he has a spare bedroom.Im sure his apartment is badass.I still dont want to stay there, Owen retorts.Hes so angry, so hurt by what our mother has done to us, my heart breaks for him.Come on.Do this for me.Owen glances up, his gaze meeting mine.I love him, I whisper.Hed do anything to help me.To help us.I know it.Owen rolls his eyes and yanks his hand from mine.Fine.Well stay there.But I refuse to move in with him, Fabes.You hardly know his ass.Owen, stop.I cant put up with his attitude right now.Drew is being nothing but kind and generous.Owen is probably using his rudeness as a defense mechanism to cope or whatever, but I dont want to deal with it.I can hardly wrap my head around what our mother has done.Her mental abandonment has scarred me for life.Her physical abandonment will probably fuck up Owens head forever.I hate her.So much I can hardly see straight, let alone think rationally.At this very moment, I need Drews support more than ever.We get Owen settled first.Drew has a futon in his spare room, which he must use as an office, if the desk and computer are any indication.I help Drew make the futon into a bed, spreading out the extra blankets while Drew goes and grabs some pillows.It feels very domestic and sweet, and I know I could get used to this.But I refuse to let myself.I cant get all sappy and silly now.My brother needs me.I need to be strong and figure out what the hell Im going to do next.Do you need anything?I ask Owen when he walks into the room, his expression defiant.A glass of water, or maybe some Tylenol?Hed cried on the drive over to Drews house, sniffling in the backseat of Drews extended cab.I wanted to comfort him so bad but knew he would refuse it.Something to eat, maybe?Drew suggests as he walks into the room with three fluffy pillows.Im fine, Owen says sullenly.I send him a pointed look and he adds a muttered thank you to appease me.Do you want to talk?I ask him quietly, both of us stepping out of the way so Drew can dump the pillows on the futon.Owen shakes his head.Id rather be alone, Fabes.I just want to fall asleep and forget this ever happened.Itll just be there ready to face you again once you wake up, I remind him.We cant avoid this, even though Id love to.Its staring me right in the face.I need to figure out what to do, where to go next.Thanks for the slap of reality.He sighs and shakes his head.I know youre mad at her.ButIm not.Im worried about her.She wont answer your calls, and that sucks.Id tried to call her from the apartment and on the way over to Drews.It went straight to voice mail.I left her a text.No reply, and that was over an hour ago.The woman is doing everything in her power to avoid us.Theres nothing we can do about it, either.No way am I going to call the cops on her.Shes our mom.Shes fine.I wave a hand.I have no doubt in my mind shes perfectly safe.Probably chugging a beer and laughing her ass off at how she pulled one over on us.Shell answer tomorrow, Im sure of it.A lie.I have no idea if shell answer me or not.For all I know, this is the last well ever hear of her.It wouldnt bother me whatsoever, either.Im so done with this bullshit she puts us through.The emotional ringer were forced to deal with every time she flits in and out of our lives.I put up my walls long ago, but Owen is still open and dying for Mom to love him.Really love him.She doesnt know how.And he hasnt realized it yet.Drew exits the room without a word, closing the door behind him, and I appreciate what hes doing for us so much.Hes nonintrusive while I try to deal with my brother.Hes been nothing but gracious, opening his home up to both of us, giving Owen whatever he needs to ensure hes comfortable here.Hes amazing.And when Im finished talking to Owen, Im going to go to Drew and beg him to put his arms around me and just hold me.I need him so badly right now.But first, I need to take care of my brother, who needs me more.What if shes not fine?Owen asks, his voice trembling.What if something really did happen to her and shes hurt and helpless somewhere?Orworse?What then, Fable?The image his words conjure in my brainno.Theres no way shes a victim in all of this.She had a hand in it.I can feel it all the way in my bones.I know youre worried.But I need to be honest with you.She doesnt care about us, Owen.Not like you want her to.Shes too wrapped up in her own problems to realize how much you need her.How much you want her around.Shed rather run off and go get drunk and hang out at the bar with her boyfriend.Owen stares at me, his cheeks red, his eyes filling with tears.You dont know shit.Maybe she doesnt want to be around us because she knows how much you hate her.I flinch.Im not the one to blame here.She cant stand the fact that were close.Shes jealous and its so stupid, because she cant see how much you crave that sort of closeness with her.Shes our mother, yet she treats us like were nothing more than a pain in her ass.Maybe to you she acts that way, but never to me.She loves me!Hes yelling, the tears are coursing down his cheeks, and he swipes them away angrily.Go on believing shes a bitch.Maybe youre being the bitch this time, Fabes.Did you ever think of that?Im stunned.I cant believe he just said that to me.Im this close to falling completely apart and damn it, I need to be the strong one.Youre upset, I say quietly.I understand.Why dont we get a good nights sleep and we can talk tomorrow.Whatever.Owen turns away from me and crawls onto the futon, fixing the pillows and then pulling the blankets over him, his back to me.Hes so stiff beneath the covers, he looks like he could shatter.I love you, Owen, I murmur just before I close the door.He doesnt even bother with a reply.Drew Im pacing my bedroom, waiting for Fable to come back.A million questions are running through my brain and Im afraid to ask her any of them.We were having an amazing night.And now this If her mom really did ransack their apartment and take everything they pretty much freaking owned, leaving her kids only their clothes and personal stuff, then shes incredibly selfish and callous.Owen is heartbroken.Fables so angry Im afraid shes going to lose it at any moment, though she has this weird calmness about her, too.Ive never seen her like this before, though hell, its not like weve been together long.This entire relationship of ours has been a whirlwind from day one.I cant imagine my life without her.Im also trying my best to be there for her.Shes not necessarily pushing me away.But shes not really including me, either.What the hell can I do for her anyway?I suggested she contact the police but her vehement no indicated that was the wrong thing to say.I feel helpless.No one can get hold of her mom.Owen hates me and views me as some sort of bad guy hell bent on breaking his sisters heartagain.The only thing I can offer is a place to stay, and even with that, I feel like I somehow fucked up by making the suggestion.I cant win.I sound like a selfish baby, but damn.I want Fable to know she can depend on me no matter what.Ill be her rock, her support, whatever she needs.I would do anything for her.Unfortunately, I dont think she fully realizes that yet.What seems like endless minutes later, shes slipping inside my bedroom, closing the door softly behind her.Her shoulders slump forward as she leans against the door, her expression one of utter exhaustion.I want to comfort her but shes put up an invisible wall.One that says she can do this on her own, thank you very much.Fuck that.Im gonna tear down that wall, no matter how long it takes.Hows Owen?I ask.He hates me.She closes her eyes, a weird little smile appearing.He blames me for our mom ditching us.Says that maybe if I wasnt such a bitch, she wouldnt have left in the first place.What?I practically shout and she opens her eyes, glaring at me.Ssh!Hell hear you.Pushing away from the door, she walks toward my bed and collapses on top of it, burrowing her head in the pillows.I dont want to talk about it now, Drew.I just want to go to sleep.Shes acting odd, but Im not about to call her on it.Shes upset.
