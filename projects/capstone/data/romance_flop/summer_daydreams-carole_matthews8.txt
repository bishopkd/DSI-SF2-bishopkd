I hug Petal again and then hand her back to Olly.I love you too, I tell my husband.Love you.Ring me as soon as you get there, he says.I will.We hug as a family and I tear myself away from them and head to passport control.They stand and wave to me for as long as they possibly can before I disappear out of view.Its a long twelve hour flight to the Peoples Republic of China.Im squashed into the back of the plane and my in flight entertainment doesnt work.No movies for me, which, of course, gives me plenty of time to stress.Im missing Petal and Olly like mad already and I feel alone and vulnerable.Eventually, when Ive gone through all the rigmarole involved in air travel these days, I emerge into Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport.Its late and Ive never seen any where so crowded in my entire life and, despite not being a statuesque woman, I feel as if Im head and shoulders taller than anyone else.I am also, it seems, the only blonde.Just as Im starting to panic  a lone stranger in a strange land  a man rushes forward.He has my name on a sign but, clearly, has had no trouble spotting me.This, Im assuming, is the representative from the Golden Bamboo Accessories Company who theyve very kindly sent to collect me.Mr Wu, whose English and manners are impeccable, escorts me to his car and then whisks me towards my hotel.Guangzhou is a huge city, lit with an excess of neon.It sparkles in the darkness.We wind our way on the busy roads through a rash of skyscrapers that Manhattan would be proud of.Ive booked the Vacation Inn, which is a modern, anonymous box that overlooks the Pearl River.Mr Wu leaves me there.Tomorrow afternoon, he tells me, hell collect me and take me out to see the first factory Ive arranged to visit.My room is beige and I could be anywhere in the world.Im jet lagged, feel dirty and my body has no idea whether Im tired or hungry or what.Ive accomplished my first long haul flight alone and the relief is palpable.Im here.Ive made it.As Im not sure what else to do now, I sit down on the bed and cry.63      As soon as Ive stopped snivelling, I ring Olly to let him know that I got here safely.Hes pleased to hear from me, but he sounds so far away that it makes me feel even lonelier.Its approaching dawn here, but its bedtime back at home.Youll be OK, he tells me as I sniffle a bit more down the line.Dont worry.But I do worry.A few short months ago I was still serving fish and chips.Now Ive somehow become an international business woman on the verge of negotiating a contract more enormous than I ever could have imaged.Frankly, Im terrified.And with very good reason.When Olly hangs up, I shower and crawl into bed where sleep consumes me.Its lunchtime when I wake and I ring room service and order from the menu, which seems to involve more burgers than noodles.Nowhere in the world is immune from the American influence, it appears.Mr Wu rings me to tell me that hes on his way and I rush to get ready for my first meeting.But as I brush my teeth, a wave of nausea washes over me and Im sick in the loo.Maybe my stomach hasnt recovered from the flight and a hamburger wasnt the best idea.By the time I get downstairs, Mr Wu is already waiting for me in the lobby.We jump into his car and he drives me away from the plush downtown area and takes me out to the industrial area of the city where all the factories are situated.There are plenty of them.Im staggered by the number as we pass by.Vast, hangar sized buildings that go on for miles and miles.Mr Wu tells me that in China they have entire cities dedicated to the manufacture of zips or buttons or cushions.No wonder everything these days seems to be made in China.In among the factories are fields and fields of rice, buffalo up to their haunches in water, ancient workers in bamboo coolie hats driving carts down the highway.Its a stark contrast of the endearingly old and the horribly new.Although I speak no Cantonese and the factory sales manager speaks very little English, Mr Wu does an excellent job of translating for us.I look at the factory, marvelling at the sheer scale and efficiency of the operation.I smile at the workers, but they put their heads down and dont look at me.I take some jasmine tea, which is drunk from tiny cups, turn down the kind offer of dinner due to my delicate stomach, and get a pleasingly reasonable price for my order.Mr Wu takes me back to the hotel and I thank him profusely and say goodbye.Tomorrow, another representative will collect me and take me to another factory and Ill repeat the process all over again.Whenever I used to hear about people travelling for their work, I was always really jealous, thinking how glamorous it must be to have a life like that.The reality of it is that Id much rather be at home with my husband and my baby.The next day, Im still feeling sickly even though I pass on the burger and eat nothing at all for dinner.I throw up again.Perhaps its the change of water or maybe Im dehydrated.Perhaps Im just not cut out to be an international jet setter.What Id like to do is crawl back into bed and sleep, but the show must go on.Im driven out to the Golden Lion Company  this time by an impeccably dressed and polite Mr Li  shuffling our way through the clogged traffic to the same area as yesterday.I take a tour of what the Golden Lion Company has to offer and note that the set up is very much the same as the first factory.I have jasmine tea again and that traditional Chinese delight, a plate of Pringles.That night I sit in the hotel and look out over the beckoning lights of Guangzhou and wonder what is out there.I should go out to a restaurant, take in a Chinese opera, see whats out there amid the twinkling neon.How can I come all the way to China and see nothing of it but the inside of three factories?Theres no fun in travelling the world if you cant do it with the one you love and I vow that, in the future, when I have cause to go abroad with work then Ill try to take Olly and Petal with me as much as I can.This would be a very different trip if they were here.So instead of tripping the light fantastic in Guangzhou, I stay put.Again.I read the Cosmopolitan magazine that I picked up at the airport.And as there doesnt seem to be much choice, I order a hamburger from the room service menu.Again.I wake up early and lie as still as possible until the nausea has abated.It might just be the quality of air here, which feels so much more polluted than at home.The final factory in Shiling Town is the Very Good Handbag Manufacturer.Im not sure anyone could argue with that.Mr Chu is a charming man and after three visits to three different places, Im totally confused and my head is spinning.But the Very Good Handbag Manufacturer seems to offer me excellent terms, can turn the handbags round quickly and, having no one else to bounce my thoughts off, I decide to sign up there and then.I wish Olly was with me, or Tod, or simply someone to tell me that Im doing the right thing, that these are the people I should trust to make my handbags.But theres no one.I have to make this call by myself and follow my instinct.Because Im a new and unknown client, I have to pay for all this up front.Gulp.I take a deep breath, sign the contract, commit a vast amount of the banks money to the deal, and walk out with shaky knees.64      Muuuummeeee!Petal races across the concourse towards me and joy surges through my heart.Dropping my case, I scoop her up into my arms as she careers into me and twirl her round.I breathe in her scent.She smells of fish fingers, jam sandwiches and Matey bubble bath.She is what gives my life meaning.Ive been a very good girl while youve been gone, she says.I lower her to the ground.Im sure you have.I root in my handbag and find the doll that I bought for her in a gift shop at the airport.Something else for my child to boss about.Im back home, safely on English soil once more.I sigh with relief and fall into Ollys arms.We hold each other tightly.Missed you, he whispers in my ear.Not as much as Ive missed you, I tell him.Im so glad that he and Petal have collected me from the airport.I couldnt wait to see them both and I dont think I could have faced taking the train now.Im exhausted and elated in equal measures.Petal falls asleep in the borrowed car on the way home.The next thing must be to get some decent wheels of our own.As soon as the money starts to roll in from Home Mall, it will be top of the list.I also struggle to keep my eyes open, but Olly and I hold hands all the way back, even as he changes gear.We catch the end of rush hour, so the roads are still busy.Did you get everything sorted out?he asks as we hit the M25.Yes, I say.We will very soon be the proud owners of several thousand Nell McNamara handbags.Wow.Well, more accurately, we have paid an enormous amount for handbags that we will most likely never catch a glimpse of.Apart from a dozen for quality control, the rest will be shipped direct to the warehouse of Home Mall in Florida.But, on the global stage, thats how business works now.It went OK?Better than I could have expected, I admit.But I cant wait to get home.Olly squeezes my hand.Theres no doubt that it was a steep learning curve for me but having done it, the process would hold no fear for me again.I am woman, hear me roar!Hey, sleepyhead, Olly says as he shakes my arm.Home, sweet home.Were back?Already?He laughs.It wasnt that quick.I glance at my watch.Thanks to the traffic, its taken nearly two hours to travel home.I must have dropped off as I dont remember half of the journey.Weve pulled up outside the shop.Olly lifts a still sleeping Petal out of the back seat and carries her to the door, while I lug my case out of the boot and then along the pavement behind them.As Olly unlocks the door and climbs up the stairs, I pause at the shop window.The handbags are lit up with little spotlights and shimmer in the dusk of the evening.It brings a tear to my eye.This is my work.All my work.One day, hopefully very soon, it will be worth all the hard slog.With a smile in my heart, I follow them both into the flat.Even the dreary pokiness of it cant make a dent in my contentment.Olly takes Petal straight through to her room.I abandon my wheelie case in the middle of the living room and sigh to myself.It may not be much, but it is home.Dude is ecstatic to see me and leaps up and down, pounding everything in sight with his tail.Good boy.I ruffle his ears and pat his head.Ive missed you too.Go and sit with her for a minute, Olly says as he emerges from Petals room.Ill run you a bath.That would be lovely.I have another surprise in store, he says with a wink.Oh, really?I raise an eyebrow.Yes, but youll have to wait until Ive taken the Corsa back to Tom.Im a patient woman, I tell him.Yeah, right, he says with a laugh.He kisses me.I wont be long.Kicking off my shoes with a grateful groan  my ankles are like a pair of pumpkins after the long flight  I pad through to Petals room enjoying the feel of the rough carpet on my weary feet.My daughter is fast asleep, amid a pile of soft toys, arm thrown above her head.She looks so peaceful.I stand and watch her in the glow of her little night light and my heart squeezes with love for her.I want to give her a life of ease, a life that doesnt involve worry or pain.Isnt that what all parents want for their children?I want her to be happy, whatever that means for her.Nudging her up, I lie down beside her.She mutters something incomprehensible.If our roles were reversed, Petal would be sticking in sharp elbows and knees to make sure she got more than her fair share of the duvet.As it is, I balance on the edge of the bed, just content to be next to her.In the bathroom, I can hear Olly running my bath.My eyes grow heavy just thinking about it.Just as Im dozing off, he swings open the door softly.Baths ready, madam.Thank you.You look too comfortable there.Hmm, I murmur.It wouldnt be hard to stay here for the rest of the night.A bath is a good idea though.I haul my weary bones from Petals bed and go through to the bathroom.Olly has filled the room with candles and the bath is full, steaming and overflowing with wonderfully scented foam.On the mirror, in the steam, hes written I LOVE YOU, NELL MCNAMARA!And there are lots of kisses.Smiling, I strip off my crumpled clothes and slide into the welcoming hot water with a heartfelt Ahhhhh.Lying back, I relax and let the bubbles envelop me.Olly must have really missed me as I couldnt have hoped for a lovelier homecoming.I doze again in the water and a few minutes later I hear the front door bang to signal his return.I can hear him clattering about in the kitchen, so I step out of the bath and dry myself.Towelling my hair, I slip on my dressing gown and go to find out what hes cooking up.In the living room the table is set, the candles are out in force again.Olly is dishing out Chinese takeaway and he turns when I start to laugh.You said that all youd eaten was hamburgers, he points out.I thought this might be a nice finale to your trip.I wind my arms round his waist.Its a lovely idea.He piles our plates high with sweet and sour chicken, egg fried rice and spare ribs from Hong Kong Garden, our favourite takeaway in town.The remains go onto the table, still in their cartons.A mountain of prawn crackers fills a handy Pyrex bowl.Olly cracks open a couple of the Tsingtao beers that hes bought and he clinks his bottle against mine.A toast to China.To China!I echo, then I chew anxiously at my lip.I hope Ive done the right thing.Of course you have, he says.I know Ive been a pain in the arse, Nell, but I do trust you.If you say this is right for us, then I believe you.Thanks, I say.That means a lot to me.Then, before our Chinese meal gets cold and before I let my doubts swamp me, we tuck in.65      The next day, Im trying to get my jet lagged head together by staring blankly at my computer screen, when Lola Cody from Home Mall calls me.Hi, Nell, honey, she coos in her lilting southern accent.Hows it going?Fine, I say.Just back from China.The shipment is ordered.I give her the expected date for delivery.Thats so wonderful, my new best friend says.She sounds almost as excited as I am.Things are moving along just great.We can now go ahead and reserve the slot.Lola clears her throat.Theres just the small matter of the deposit.You know thats fully refundable providing the orders are worth more and, honey, I have no doubt that they will be.Thank goodness for that.I can get onto it today, right now, I assure her.The moneys in our bank.All I have to do is arrange for it to be transferred.Then youll need our details.Lola reels off her account number and bank details while I scribble them down on my pad.I notice that my hands shake.Its a lot of money.An awful lot of money.This is the final step.After I pay the deposit, I hand everything over to Home Mall to work their magic.Were all set to go, she says.I cant wait, I tell her.Im really looking forward to it.Maybe you and Olly and little Petal can come out one day and visit with us, she says.That sure would be nice.It sounds great, I admit.Miami always looks fabulous on the television.Although Im thinking that Ive only ever seen it on crime shows.Id love to go there and this would give us the perfect excuse for a family holiday.But, first, we have to get the money in.Cant do anything without that.Ill talk to you soon, Lola says.Bye for now.Bye.And thanks again, I say and I hang up.Sitting back in my chair, I stare at the screen again.I tap at the keys and locate the slick Home Mall website.Clips of pearly toothed, glossy haired presenters selling their hearts out pass before my eyes.In a few short weeks this will be me.It will be my handbags on prime time USA television.This is it.My launch pad.Time for my big break.My stomach heaves majestically and I rush to the loo and am promptly sick.Do you reckon that Lord Sugar does this when hes just sealed a big deal?Does Donald Trump like a good business barf?Somehow I dont think so.Im going to have to toughen up as the figures are getting bigger and bigger.I wash my face, pour a glass of water and plod back out to the office.Im sorry to have parted company with last nights Chinese as Olly and I had such a lovely time together.We didnt quite get down to it on the table like we did in Cornwall, but we certainly had a very romantic evening.Petal, for once, stayed in her own bed and we made the springs in ours bounce.I really think that things between us are getting back to how they were.Hallelujah!After calming my breathing, I pick up the phone and call the bank to speak to Simon North, my business manager.We exchange pleasantries and then I ask him to make the transfer.Moments later, he tells me its done.My money  the banks money  is now winging its way across cyberspace to the United States of America and, more importantly, the coffers of the Home Mall Shopping Channel.Soon my consignment of handbags will be following it.Hey!Consignment!Did I think Id ever be throwing that word into conversation as a fish and chip lady, eh?When the deed is done, I collapse back and sip my water.Then a wave of euphoria crashes over me, sweeping away my dread and nausea.Thats it.Im on my way.Perhaps Olly and I can have a sandwich together at lunchtime and toast our good fortune with a frothy cappuccino.Maybe Ill pop into the chippy this afternoon and see how everyone is.The doorbell of the shop door chimes and breaks into my musing.With my grin still firmly in place, I go to see who it is.Im surprised to see Tod standing there.Hey, I say.Good timing.I was just going to break out the kettle for a cup of celebratory tea.Then I notice that the expression on his face is grim.Whats wrong?His dull eyes meet mine when he says, You may not be celebrating when you hear what Ive got to tell you.He holds up a rumpled newspaper and shakes his head.This is not good news, is it?No.And my heart sinks right into my boots.66      Youd better sit down, Nell, Tod says.Without protest, I go back to my computer chair and drop into it.My mentor pulls up another chair and sits opposite me.No tea?Tod shakes his head.Well need some in a minute.His face says that I actually may need more than tea.Much more.He spreads out the newspaper on the desk in front of me.I bought this first thing this morning, but Ive only just had the chance to read it.I came straight round here as soon as I saw it.The column is tucked away on the left hand side of page fifteen.The small, insignificant headline reads Shopping Channel Scam and I know that in my heart of hearts, before I need to read another single word, that Ive been had.Royally, truly, had.Tears fill my eyes and I struggle to read the piece through the blur.Fat, wet droplets splash onto the type.Tod reaches out and takes my hand and squeezes it tightly.Sure enough the perpetrator of this fraud is the one, the only, Home Mall.Theres a blurry picture of Lola Cody and shes not the slick, sharp suited business woman with a killer manicure and GHD hairdo that Id imagined.Shes fat, robed in grubby sweats and a shapeless, tent sized T shirt.Next to her is an equally waddly man in a Hawaiian shirt with a bad combover; Mr Benito Cody, the newspaper informs me  if those are even their real names.Not only Lolas partner in crime, but her husband, I presume.The article goes on to say that Home Mall have been operating this scam for several months now.A dozen or more businesses have been taken down by them.The deposits are sent, the stock delivered and both mysteriously disappear without trace.I feel vomit rising to my mouth, but I force it down.Im sorry, Tod says.This is the first time Ive heard about it.Theres been nothing in the trade papers, nothing from the Department of Trade and Industry.Usually, wed hear something on the grapevine.Apparently, theyre such professional operators that no one has suspected anything until now.Tell me about it.I was totally taken in by Lola Codys easy charm and friendliness.She even invited me to go there on holiday with Olly and Petal, for heavens sake!She knew that this meant the world to me, that it was going to mean a new start for our family.She knew that in order to scam me, shed be taking food out of my childs mouth.She knew all this!The woman can have no heart, no soul, and certainly no conscience.I was stupid to be seduced by the fact that out of all the handbags in the world, she wanted mine.Olly said that it sounded too good to be true  and he was right.I should have listened to him.I should have listened to his doubts, but I didnt and the deed has been done.Have I learned nothing from having my designs ripped off by Monsieur Yves Simoneaux?Though his nasty little trick looks like amateur hour compared to the set up of Home Mall.I know this was your dream.Was.Already past tense.Still staring at the newspaper page, I let the tears fall.The editor may feel that this story only warrants a small column, a tiny headline, but with it a vacuum has just opened up and swallowed my life.I was so sure, Tod frets.So sure.The contract looked above board.The website was professional.Everything seemed fine.So believable.I never suspected that someone would create something so elaborate, that they would go to so much trouble to perpetrate a fraud.Its beyond my imagination.Still is.However hard I find it to believe, the golden goose, it seems, was nothing more than a mirage.Something created with smoke and mirrors to lure in the susceptible.It looks like shes done this several times before.He sighs heavily.Pull out now, Tod says.Its not too late.Looking up, I realise that Tod doesnt know how far this has gone.He knew I was going to China, but Ive not yet had the chance to update him since Ive been back.He doesnt realise that the money has already been transferred to Lola Codys bank account, which could be in the Cayman Islands for all I know.It is too late, I tell him.He looks at me blankly.The bags are ordered and have been paid for up front.An inordinate amount of money.I transferred the deposit to Home Mall not half an hour ago.Thirty thousand dollars.The best part of twenty thousand pounds.My head swims and I clutch the desk with my free hand.Id just put the phone down to my bank manager when you came in.Tod recoils.Stop it, he says.You must be able to stop it.Get onto the bank right away.I slip my hand from Tods and with trembling fingers and the dead weight of fear dragging down my hope, I punch in the banks number again.67      I feel the blood drain from my face and I hang up.Gone, I say.Once the button has been pushed at this end, theres nothing I can do.Nothing?Tod questions.The business manager at the bank said that although it will take three or four days to clear into Lola Codys account, theres nothing I can do to block the transfer.Once its gone, its gone.That cant be right.Apparently it is.But thats ridiculous.Ridiculous.Unfair.Downright cruel.All of those things.I could rant all day, but nothing I could say would change bank policy.Simon North at least had the good grace to be embarrassed.Somewhere my money is whirling around in the banking system heading to a crook and theres not a single thing I can do to stop it.If they can push a button to send it, why isnt there another one to stop it?Particularly when were all aware now that the transaction is fraudulent?In this day and age of high technology, you wouldnt think it was that difficult, would you?He said that all that I can do is start legal action, I offer.Assuming that we can find Lola Cody, that this isnt all false and theres no one of that name at all.But I have to say that Simon North didnt sound very hopeful.Frankly, he didnt sound like he cared that much at all.Whatever happens, hell get his money back.Ill be paying off the loan for the rest of my natural life, but you can bet your bottom dollar that the bank wont be the losers in this.Taking legal action seems very unlikely.Besides, how much will it cost to pursue?We dont have any more money to engage in an expensive legal battle.That could cost us thousands.Thousands that we now dont have thanks to Lola Cody and her husband.I shake my head.I dont think Ill be seeing that money again, Tod.My brain reels at the statement.I sound so matter of fact.Shouldnt I be lying on the floor and screaming, renting my hair asunder?Surely theres something we can do?My only hope now is to stop the handbags.If the factory wont cancel the order, then I hope I can stop them being shipped to the USA and can divert the handbags to come here.It will leave me with an enormous amount of stock and Ill have to pay to warehouse them but at least Ill have them in my hot, sweaty hands and they wont be in Lola Codys.I should call her.Give her a piece of my mind.And not a nice piece.Tod nods.Want that tea before you do?Yes.Please.You know where everything is?Ill find it.He squeezes my shoulder as he passes.I feel Ive let you down, Nell.Im your business mentor.I should have advised you against this.It sounded perfect.We both thought so.I should have been more cautious or realised that there was something not right about it.How?Theyve gone to a lot of trouble to make this look professional and above board.But then they stood to make a lot of money.Its not your fault, Tod.If its anyones fault its mine for rushing headlong into this deal without taking a step back.Its just bloody awful timing.Well sort this out, he says.Dont worry.But I dont think well sort it out and I am worried.While I pick up the phone, Tod goes up to the flat to make some tea.The number that I have for Lola Cody and the Home Mall goes straight to a voicemail message.This number has not been recognised, it says.Please dial again.I hold the phone to my ear while it repeats it over and over again.This number has not been recognised.Please dial again.I thought it was only good news that travelled fast?Seems as if bad news does too.Lola must already have got wind that her scam had been exposed.I wonder whether she knew when I spoke to her earlier and if she thought shed just give it one last go at taking in another gullible sucker?If only I hadnt been so quick to set the ball rolling.If only Id sat back and taken time to do this.If only I hadnt been so trusting.If only I hadnt been so blindly ambitious.If only.If only.If only.68      When Tod finally leaves  even though he was reluctant to go  I turn my face to the sky and howl.The floodgates open and I let a torrent of tears flow.I have lost everything.Everything.How can I possibly carry on?By the time Olly returns with Petal, I have managed to get myself under control again.Where there was rage and anger, a dull numbness has settled in.What?Olly says when he sees my puffy face and redrimmed eyes.Whos died?My business, I tell him flatly.Everything Ive worked for, gone.He recoils slightly at that, but says, Gone?You cant mean that.Im afraid that I do.My voice doesnt even falter.Petal comes to sit on my lap.Dont cry, Mummy, she says.Daddy will fix it.I pass Olly the newspaper that Tod brought for me to read and, face darkening, he sits and studies it in silence.Shit, he says when he puts it down again.Daddy!Petal admonishes.Thats a very bad word.Sometimes bad words are the only words that will do, Petalmeister, he tells her.But you can only use them when youre eighteen.Oh, she says, clearly not taken in.Shell be saying shit to everyone in the playground tomorrow and well get a complaint from the nursery.Another one.Like I could care less at the moment if my daughter is a potty mouth; very soon she could be homeless.Olly looks up at me, eyes questioning.The moneys gone.Ive already checked with the bank.Theres nothing we can do to get it back.Shit, Petal says.That, at least, raises a glimmer of a smile between us.Want to go and see Auntie Constance?Olly asks our daughter.Yay!Shes down off my lap in the blink of an eye.It will give us some time to talk, Olly says.He drops his voice to a whisper.And we can use bad words at will.Lots of them.We lock up the shop and walk the few hundred yards down to the town centre in the sunshine to Live and Let Fry.Of course were welcomed like the Prodigal Son.Constance throws her arms round us, as does Phil.Jenny is cooler and theres a look that goes between her and Olly thats distinctly shifty, but I dont have time to concern myself with that now.There are bigger problems on my plate than my friend having a crush on my husband, if thats what this is.Its so lovely to see you, Constance says.We do miss you.Phil is still pumping Ollys hand.These are good people.Their straightforward friendship almost has me undone again.Everything OK?Not really, I admit.Olly and I need an hour to ourselves.Could you keep an eye on Petal if we leave her here?Of course, Constance says.She doesnt even need to check with Phil.His chip shop has been used as an emergency crche on more than one occasion.Theyre just opening up for lunchtime service and, outside, a queue is already forming.Business here isnt suffering then.Perhaps I should have just opened a chip shop.It seems so uncomplicated in comparison to the hard nosed world of fashion.Be a good girl, I say to Petal.Mummy and Daddy wont be long.Take all day, her face says as she knows shell be fed a constant stream of hot chips and therell be as much Coke as she can drink.For a bit of peace now, shell be bouncing off the walls later.Olly and I link arms and walk out through the town and, eventually, along Hermitage Road where the steep and striking slope of Windmill Hill faces us.Without talking, we climb the hill side by side.Then, when were both out of breath, we find a bench and sit at the top, taking in the breathtaking view over the rest of Hitchin town and far out to the verdant fields and rolling hills beyond.The rumble of traffic from the streets below and the faint hum of jets taking off from nearby Luton Airport compete with the birdsong.But by all accounts, this is still an idyllic summers day.Yet even the cloudless sky cant shake my blues.We sit together in silence, until I ask, Dont you want to shout?Olly tucks my hand into his.No, he says.Whats done is done.But Ive lost all the money, I reiterate.Youd be quite entitled to shout.What good would it do?Weve got nothing, I point out as if Olly doesnt realise this.He shrugs.We had nothing before.In truth, we havent got nothing; weve got less than that.Nothing would be a bonus.In reality what we have is an enormous debt hanging over us now.Id like to go out to Miami and kill Lola Cody and her husband with my bare hands, he says.It sounds like therell be a queue of people wanting to do that.Shell get her comeuppance.People like that always do.But do they?I think.People like that normally seem to get away scot free if you ask me.Its people like us, straight forward people who always try to do the right thing, pay their way, dont cheat on their taxes, were the ones that pay.Olly puts his head against mine.Well get through this, he assures me.You and me.Your handbags are still fab.He nudges me, but I cant summon the required smile as a response.At this moment, I dont care whether I design another handbag for the rest of my days.No one can take that away from you, Nell McNamara.You just need to carry on.But can I?Can I simply pick myself up, one more time, and carry on?69      We go back to the chip shop to collect Petal.Olly and I stayed in the park for a while, not talking much, but just sitting and watching the world go by.It sounds like it was restful, but it wasnt as my brain was still going ninety to the dozen.Now its late evening and the lunchtime rush has died down and the early teatime people havent quite arrived yet.At one of the tables, our daughter is holding court.Somewhat tunelessly, shes singing a song, Rainbow Connection from the The Muppet Movie, her current favourite.For some reason her tolerant audience, Constance and Phil, are wearing napkins on their heads.We slide into the seats opposite them and wait for the song to finish.It seems to go on for a long time.Im sure Petal makes up a few verses.Eventually, she stops.Phil, removing his napkin, asks, Everything all right?I shake my head.Not really, Phil, I say and then proceed to explain to him all that has happened.With shuddering breaths, I tell Phil all about my designs being stolen by team Simoneaux Monique.Then I move on to the scam that Lola Cody of the fictitious Home Mall was running.I tell him how I fell for it hook, line and sinker.I tell him how I have lost all of our money.He sits there, face like stone, as he listens patiently.Constances eyes well up with tears.Dont cry, I warn her.Youll start me off again.Ive already cried a river and crying isnt going to do anything to stop Lola Cody or the likes of her.Is there anything we can do?Phil asks.Anything?Just ask.Give me my old job back?No, he says.Anything but that.You dont need a job here, youve already got one.I dont remind Phil that Ive got a job that is not only bringing in no money, but is actually sinking us deeper into debt.Youll make it as a designer, he continues.Youll get over this and make it big.Yes, I say.Of course I will.But, in my heart, I know its not the case.To a chorus of sympathetic noises and good wishes, Olly, Petal and I leave.We walk the short distance home, Olly and me quiet, Petal chattering away to herself.Ill find something, Olly says.I heard that Tesco are looking for delivery drivers.I might give that a go.Fine, I say.It comes out more like whatever than Id intended.He sighs.Were in this together, Nell.Im not expecting you to pick up the pieces by yourself.Thanks.But at the end of the day, its my bad.Mine alone.Ill make dinner tonight, he says.Had you got anything planned?No, I admit.Food is the last thing on my mind.Ill throw some pasta in a tin of tomatoes, sprinkle some cheddar on it and call it Italian.Sounds good.To be honest Id eat anything as long as it doesnt involve me going near the kitchen.Why dont you go into the office and do some sketches?That always takes your mind off things.So does lying on the sofa watching crap telly.But I suppose I ought to show willing.Olly has been really good about this.Would I have been so magnanimous if the boot had been on the other foot?Id like to think so, but Im not so sure.The Petalmeister will help me, wont you?My childs face says that shed like to be watching crap telly too.Yes, Daddy.She must be able to tell by the sombre atmosphere that its probably best not to rock the boat.So Petal and Olly climb up the stairs to the flat while I stay downstairs in the shop.I stand and stare blankly at my handbags all beautifully displayed and, for the first time, can take no joy in them.I go through to the office and sit and stare blankly at the computer screen.Whats the point of me designing anything when we now have no money to even commission a sample of it to be made?Plus, if I can manage to get all my handbags back from China, then well have more than enough to sell.In fact, I cant really imagine how well get rid of them without some massive television campaign.Not knowing what else to do, I log onto the Home Mall website and watch the bright and bubbly clips that Lola Cody has posted on there, looking, searching, for some clues that I might have missed, something to tell me that all was not well.But even watching them with eyes that have had the scales peeled from them, I can see nothing amiss.The pastel coloured studio looks perfectly respectable, the presenters are professional.I wonder if they even knew what they were involved in or whether the glossy, smiling women were a part of it too.Ive done nothing remotely useful, other than brood, when Olly calls down to say that supper is ready.Petal is already sitting at the table.Quite wisely, she has a tiny bowl in front of her as Im sure shes been snaffling chips all afternoon.Olly gives us both bigger bowls, but I toy with mine, not really hungry.Ill save whats left and ping it tomorrow.Well have to be eating a lot more tinned tomatoes and pasta until Olly finds a job.Ill need to find one too, despite Phils confidence in me.When weve eaten, Olly insists on washing up and I watch In the Night Garden with Petal and my eyes, rather than hers, grow heavy.Come on, miss, Olly says.Time for bed.Aw, Daddy.Not yet!Its late.You know, I say.I might go too.Its half past seven, Olly points out.Late for one age group is not necessarily the same for another.Jet lag, I say.Im absolutely bushed.Ill stay up and watch a film or something.I cant go to bed now.He kisses my forehead.You have a good nights sleep, then youll feel better.Petal and I crawl under the duvet together in our double bed.I bet Olly ends up sleeping in her single.Within seconds, my daughter has claimed two thirds of the bed.I have an elbow in my back, a knee where I dont want a knee and Im struggling to keep hold of my share of the cover.I can hear Olly watching something loud involving copious car chases through the thin walls.Im still awake when the film has finished and I hear my husband pad through to Petals room and settle down for the night.I should go and tell him that Im not asleep, that he could come to bed with me and not disturb me.We could lift Petal into her own bed and snuggle down together.But I dont.Instead, I stare at the ceiling until dawn and, in the morning, feel worse than ever.70      Two weeks go by and instead of getting better and coming to terms with whats happened, Im struggling to function at all.I cant eat.I cant sleep.I see no point in carrying on.I must have lost a tonne of weight as all my clothes are hanging off me.You need to go to the doctor, Olly says as I push away the toast thats in front of me.I feel constantly sick and just cant face it.His tone is slightly exasperated.You cant go on like this.Theres nothing wrong.There is, Nell.He could perhaps give you some tablets, Olly suggests.Just to get you back on your feet.Pills?I look up.You think a pill will get our money back?Its you that Im worried about.Im fine, I insist.But even I know that Im not.Im sitting on the sofa watching Daybreak, something Ive taken to doing.In fact, Im watching a lot of daytime television these days.I cant face going into the shop, the office.Everything glares at me, accusing.The phone is silent.No one is ringing to order handbags any more.The glossy magazines have all stopped calling.So soon, theyve moved on to the next new thing.Already, Ive dropped off the radar.Another insignificant blip to be overlooked.Only Tod is texting every day, but I dont reply.What have I to say to him?Nothing that hell want to hear.Nothing good.Nothing positive.Nothing that will bring our money back.Nothing that will undo this terrible cock up.Olly has been doing his best.I cant fault him for that.He has phoned and phoned the police, who arent the slightest bit interested in our story.Hes phoned and phoned the bank.The response is much the same.Hes pleaded with the business manager, reasoned with his manager, argued with the banks Company Fraud Department and has threatened them with exposing the story on Watchdog.But they remain unmoved by our plight.They have hearts of stone.The only thing he has learned is that the Codys bank account, as soon as our transfer had cleared, has been stripped of all cash.Somewhere, on the other side of the world, they have their hands on our money.As easy as that.Under the banks averted gaze, they have got away with this audacious theft scot free.The only thing Ive done since the bombshell dropped is phone the factory in China.They wouldnt cancel the contract, and who could blame them?Its a lot of money to forgo.But they have agreed to delay production and theyll deliver all the handbags here for me.Twenty grands worth of them.What do you suppose Im going to do with that lot, eh?Well have to find storage for them, but I dont have to think about that for now.Itll be another few weeks before they rock up on our doorstep.At least weve rescued something out of the disaster, is Ollys viewpoint.But, frankly, Im not jumping round the room doing a happy dance.Mummy, we need to see the ducks today, Petal says.Theyll be hungry without us.Not today, Petal, I say.Olly has been looking after our daughter.I dont know why but, at the moment, Im just finding her chatter too bright, too relentless.I simply want to be quiet, to be by myself.We should go out, Olly suggests.Take a walk.Get some fresh air.You havent been out of the flat for days.Havent I?I guess not.I look around me.The place is untidy, toys everywhere.Most days the bed goes unmade and Im not the slightest bit bothered.No one else is concerned about anything, so why should I be?Nearly every day Olly has been going out for interviews, but nothing is forthcoming.At this rate well be on skid row sooner than we think.I wonder if well even be able to hang onto this place.I wonder if I even care.Its sunny out there.But its raining in my heart.Lets take Dude for a stroll.At that, the dog wags his tail.Someones keen, at least.OK.Olly looks relieved.Then, as I go to get up, tiredness over whelms me.On second thoughts, I say.You go.Take Petal and Dude.Ill just stay here.He sighs.You cant just stay here, Nell.This is doing you no good.What s this exactly?Petal, go and put your shoes on.She skips out of the room and my husband comes to kneel down beside me.He strokes my leg as if Im injured, then he sighs before he says, I know youve been hurt, Nell.Its a terrible blow.But life goes on.Does it?It isnt the end of the world.His tone is soft, cajoling.He toys with my fingers and I want to shake him off.His touch, for the first time ever, is irritating.It is the end of my world, I think.How can he not see that?No one is ill.He looks anxiously at me.No one has died.Something inside me has died, I want to say.Im empty.A shell.But no words will come.You dont understand, I tell him.Im trying to, Nell.I round on him.You never wanted this business to succeed.Secretly, I think that you hoped I would fail all along.Theres a stunned expression on his face.Where did that come from?You know its true, I say bitterly.This was never what you longed for.Nell, he says, I admit, in the beginning, I was scared about it.But Ive changed.Surely you must see that?You dont care, I hiss at him.No one cares.Petal comes back into the room.She has on her shoes.I wonder if shes going somewhere.I dont believe that you mean that, Nell, Olly says sadly.He stands up and the pain on his face is unbearable, so I turn my eyes away.Petal and I will go out for a while.When were gone try to decide what you want, what you need.Do something to help yourself.Help myself?I dont know how to do that.I want to say something good, something that will stop Olly looking at me like that, but still my fogged brain wont let anything go to my mouth.I hear Olly and Petal walk heavily down the stairs.Then the front door slams and Im left alone.71      Olly skirts round me for the rest of the day.He keeps Petal out of my way too.I sit in my pyjamas and watch The Jeremy Kyle Show, which reduces me to tears.Then its Homes Under the Hammer, 60  Minute Makeover and five episodes of Coach Trip back to back.I cant remember what else.The mindless programmes, chewing gum for the mind, nearly manage to block out the flashback images of the villainous Yves Simoneaux, the duplicitous Marie Monique and the devious Lola Cody that are playing on a constant loop in my head.Nearly, but not quite.Food comes and goes.I think I eat some of it.Eventually, Petal, bathed and in her pyjamas, is presented to me.Is it her bedtime already?How long have I been welded to this sofa?All day?Surely not?Only Dude, curled into my side like a limpet, is appreciative of the amount of time Im spending on the sofa.If I could move, I would, but my legs have no strength and my mind even less.My daughters face is scrubbed and shiny.She smells of strawberries.She climbs up on my lap and her tiny body moulds to mine.I love you, Mummy, she says.Dont be sad.I hold her tightly and a chink of light shines through the darkness.She is my world.Not handbags.Not shopping channels.Not factories in China.I love you too, I say.Daddy will make everything right, she assures me.But I think that Petals optimism might be misplaced.No one can make this right.Its a disaster of my own making and I have to somehow learn to live with the consequences.Come on, Petalmeister.Olly peels her away from me and carries her off to her bedroom.When he comes back, he budges Dude out of the way and sits next to me on the sofa.We both stare blankly at whatever is passing across the screen.I take hold of Ollys hand.Im sorry, I tell him.Ill try to do better.Oh, Nell.He sighs at me.I love you.I do.I love you too, he says.Olly gazes deep into my eyes as if hes trying to fathom whats going on behind them.I would help him out if I could, but I dont know myself.Whatever happens.I love you.We go to bed and lie very still in each others arms.I stare at the ceiling, but for once I dont feel despair crushing down on me.At some time in the dark hours, I must fall asleep.When I wake up, Olly is gone.His side of the bed has clearly been abandoned several hours earlier.I listen for sounds of him pottering about, making breakfast, as he always does, but the flat is silent.Dude is still slumbering on the floor, so hes not out walking the dog.A feeling of dread grips me.In my heart, I know that this is bad.In a stupor, I climb out of bed and search the flat for him.I check all the rooms, which doesnt take long.Hes not in the shower, or in the office.When, eventually, I check in the yard, I discover that his precious Vespa has gone.I call his mobile, but hes not picking up.One of the big holdalls is missing and his wardrobe is half empty.I press one of his shirts  my favourite  against my face and inhale his scent.Theres no doubt about it.Olly has definitely gone.I slump onto the bed.Who can blame him?Ive done nothing but push him away recently.Everything has been at the top of the list but him.Well, now it seems that hes had enough.Didnt Constance warn me as much?I should have listened to her.My eyes burn with tears.What have I done?What will I do without him?He has always been my rock, my best friend, my lover, my life.Until bloody handbags came and got in the way.Petal will be distraught.Hes a fantastic father and she adores him.I could see how he would leave me  goodness only knows Ive tested him enough  but I cant believe that he would simply walk out on her.I call his mobile again.Not answering.I check the flat again.I thought, at least, that he would leave me a note, say something.But theres nothing.The Olly I know would talk this through, he wouldnt just up and leave us.Petal is still asleep.I look down at her face, untroubled, peaceful.I dont want anything in her life to cause her pain.Particularly nothing that Ive done, that I could have prevented.I have to find Olly and talk to him.We have to sort this out.Just when I thought that my life couldnt possibly get any worse, it has.But, in some ways, it also feels as if Ive woken from a terrible nightmare.Unfortunately, the reality is just as painful.The shock has jolted me out of my catatonic state.If Olly has left me and Petal alone, then I have to cope, I have to get on with my life.I cant sit watching daytime television and feeling sorry for myself.I have to get a grip.First of all, I need to find my husband.But where would he go?What would he do?I cant think that hed go very far as hed want to stay as near to Petal as possible.Think, Nell, I urge myself.Think.Where would Olly go?It hits me like a body blow.I know someone who would take him in like a shot.72      Olly sat outside the shop on his scooter waiting for it to open.He knew the owner of Vroom very well by now.He and Ben had been at school together.Theyd bought their first scooters at pretty much the same time.Theyd done numerous runs down to Brighton on them.When Ben eventually set up his own business, Olly had been one of his most regular customers.Hed continued to support him over the years.Maybe hed not been the highest spending client hed ever had, but whenever hed needed work done on the Vespa this is where hed brought it.He hoped that loyalty and a long term friendship would count for something.Olly checked his watch again.Ben would be here before long.He sat back on the scooter and tried to relax.It was shaping up to be a perfect day.For the weather, at least.The sun was already climbing in the sky, the clouds were wispy, insubstantial.He saw the jet trail of a plane streaked across the sky and wondered where it was heading.Despite the warmth, there was a chill in the pit of his stomach.He wasnt looking forward to doing what he had to do.Who would?Yet it had to be done.He could see no way round it.When Nell woke, shed be furious that hed left without telling her.But, if hed told her what he had planned, she would have tried to talk him out of it.Probably quite rightly.Still, he wouldnt be going anywhere, if he couldnt get some cash  and fast.A few minutes later and Ben pulled up in front of him on his own scooter  a 1960s Lambretta SX200 that had been lovingly restored from a rusting shell.Ben took off his helmet.Hey, mate.Early for you.He stuck out his hand and shook Ollys firmly.Have you been here since sun up?Olly shrugged.Something like that.Whats the problem?He opened up the shop as he talked.Olly followed him inside.I need to sell the Vespa.No way.Times are hard, Olly said.Thought youd sell the missus rather than part with the old Vespa Rally.
