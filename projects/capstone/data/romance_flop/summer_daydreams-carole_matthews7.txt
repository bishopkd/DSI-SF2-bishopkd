Not Nell.He pulled away.Sorry, he said.I didnt mean for that to happen.The smile on Jens face said that she, however, did.Got to go, Olly said.His knees, his hands, his heart were shaky.Ill see you in the morning.Jens smile didnt fade.See you tomorrow, Olly.She blew him a kiss as he scurried out of the door.He couldnt concentrate at work.After ten years with Nell and not a moment of unfaithfulness, not even a thought of it, hed kissed another woman.Tonight the line was churning out mushroom and pepperoni pizzas.Virtually the whole process was automated and it just took a handful of them to supervise the making of thousands of frozen pizzas.His role was to sit on a stool next to the conveyor belt and just re sort any of the toppings that hadnt landed quite accurately on the pizza.A tiny human cog in a great, big, unstoppable machine.Already he knew hed let several go by without even noticing them, as he was lost in a world of his own.Thank goodness that Nell was coming back tomorrow, and then Jennys services could be dispensed with.But what happened when his wife was off on her next business jaunt?What could he say?Could he really tell Nell that they shouldnt use Jen again?Not because she wasnt brilliant with Petal, but because he couldnt be trusted to be alone with her.Who would they get to come in and help then?Jen had been bloody marvellous  up until the unfortunate kissing incident  they couldnt have asked for someone more willing or helpful.Petal thought the sun shone out of her.He was pretty impressed himself, he had to admit.There was a gentle, easy going domesticity to her that he hadnt noticed until shed moved in.Until then, shed just been Nells slightly loud, borderline annoying, single friend.Nothing more.But there was a lot more to her than that.She was thoughtful, caring, easily pleased.Shed make someone a great wife.Olly wondered now whether there was an ulterior motive behind her willingness to take on him and Petal, seemingly out of the goodness of her heart.Perhaps Jen had seen herself slipping quietly into Nells shoes.But maybe that was being unkind.Maybe this had all been done without thinking what was in it for her, and the kiss was just the heat of the moment, an overstepping of the mark.Who knows?He had always thought that he understood Nell, women in general.Now he realised that he really didnt have a clue.The pizzas continued to slide by him on the conveyor belt.Mindlessly, he fiddled with the mushrooms, the pepperoni, reorganising, rearranging.He could do this job in his sleep now.Other people counted sheep  he only needed to think about the regular hum of the conveyor belt, the soporific action of the pizzas sliding by and hed be off in dreamland.Though sometimes in his dreams, he did find himself hand decorating pizzas.What was Nell doing now?he wondered.Was she having a fabulous, carefree time in Paris?Was she thinking of him and of Petal and what shed left behind?Did they feature in her thoughts at all?Or was she glad to break away from the drudgery of the domestic routine?He knew that she was with Tod and that always rankled.Perhaps his wife would be better off with someone like that.Someone who was powerful, ambitious, driven.Someone who didnt work in a pizza factory.Meyers!His supervisors voice barking at him, snapped him out of his reverie.Is this your idea of a joke?Olly looked up as his red faced supervisor slapped down a tray of pizzas on the stainless steel surface with a certain amount of venom.Every single one youve done tonight has been like this.Get your coat and dont come back.There are plenty of people who can do this job better than you.The whole run will have to be scrapped.When he got over his shock and looked at what was making his boss froth at the mouth, he saw that every pizza was bearing two pepperoni eyes and a sad, downturned mushroom mouth.54      I could cry with relief when I walk up to my shop, my flat.Ive never been so happy to come back from anywhere.You can keep Paris as far as Im concerned.For me theres no place quite like home.All I want is for Olly to take me in his arms and to see my darling daughter.I feel like lying on the floor and kissing the pavement.Which I probably would do if it wasnt raining and the pavement wasnt very wet.Instead, I haul my wheelie case through the shop door, which chimes my arrival.In the workshop, I can see Olly sitting at the desk tapping away at the computer.At his feet, Petal is sitting on the floor with crayons and a pad.He looks up as I come in and his face lights up.My heart literally soars.Petal looks up too.Its Mummy!she shouts and abandons her drawing and runs through the shop to greet me.I pick her up and whirl her round, then I squeeze her to me as tightly as I can.Too tight, Mummy, she gasps.Too tight!I laugh and lower her to the floor again.Are you better?I ask.Petal certainly looks a lot better than when I last saw her.Yes, she says.And I didnt pick my spots.She could have picked them all  and probably has  and I wouldnt care.Im just glad to see that shes well again.Then, without speaking Olly and I fall into each others arms.He kisses me deeply.Oooer, Petal says and goes all silly and giggly.She dances round us singing, Mummy and Daddy are in love.Mummy and Daddy are in love.When I feel dizzy and need to come up for air, I pull away.Olly strokes my hair.Its good to see you.Im glad to be home, I tell him earnestly.So glad.He stands back and looks at me, hands framing my face.What on earth happened to your eye?Ah.Id forgotten about my nice, big, black and blue shiner.Did you walk into a door?I look sheepish.I got into a fight, I explain.A fight?Olly might well look surprised.Yeah.I risk a smile.But you should have seen her.I cant wait to hear about this.Lets shut the shop for an hour, I say.Go out and have some lunch together.Just the three of us.If youre sure.Olly knows that lunchtime is the busiest hour of the day in the shop.Lets do it.Im in dire need of coffee.You look exhausted, Nell,  Im utterly jaded, I confess.At this moment, Im not sure how my legs are actually supporting me.It would be lovely just to lie down on the floor and sleep for a week.You wont believe what has happened while Ive been away.Then Ill buy you coffee while you tell me.I kiss him again.Sounds like a deal to me.We lock up the shop together and, arm in arm, stroll in the sunshine down to Halseys Deli and Tearoom in the Market Place, our favourite lunch haunt whenever we have a few quid to spare.The shop has been here in one form or another since Queen Victoria was on the throne and is one of the most popular spots in town.The food here is unbelievably delicious.Its tiny inside so, while we wait in line for a table to become vacant, Petal ogles the glorious homemade meringues in an array of pastel shades that are piled high in the window.While shes distracted, I take the opportunity to tell Olly all about my rather public altercation with Monsieur Yves Simoneaux and Madame Marie Monique.They stole my designs, I explain.When?How?Yves lifted them when he came to see me at the shop and there they were, bold as brass, parading them on the catwalk.I wanted to kill them both.In fact, I have to admit that I gave it a good go.I sigh before I continue.I never thought that anyone would stoop so low.Its really shaken my confidence.Olly looks stunned.Do you think youll be able to stop them from producing more?I threatened them with legal action, said with another weary sigh.Dont they say that sighing is the same as crying but without the tears?It certainly feels like that.But, in reality, I couldnt afford to do that.We cant afford to do it.I just hope me whacking her round the head with the offending handbag is enough to make them think twice.I dont tell him about the bit where Yves came to my room and made an attempt to seduce me  by fair means or maybe by foul.It will be all over the trade magazines, so her reputation will be sullied and I can only hope the coverage does me some good.If it has anything to do with me Ill make sure that both of their names are dragged through the mud.Perhaps that will have to be revenge enough.Maybe that will be enough to stop them doing it again.Whatever happens, Im certainly going to keep a close watch on both Marie Monique and Monsieur Simoneaux from now on.At that point, were at the front of the queue.All the tables are cheek by jowl in the small caf area and were shoehorned in at the back corner.The walls are cheerfully bright with local artworks.This is Petals favourite eatery and she realises what a rare treat it is to come here, so she always behaves impeccably.Olly knows what to order for us without even asking.He and Petal always have the fish finger sandwiches and I never fail to be lured by the special cheese on toast, which is much lauded locally.I also get my long overdue caffeine hit.So the trip wasnt as successful as you hoped?he asks.I just wanted to be at home all the time, I confess.The shows were good.Very interesting.But the competition out there is terrifying.Maybe you were right.I should have done this on a small scale.Stuck to my market stall.I dont know if Im cut out for the harsh reality of business.Olly puts his hand over mine.Youre doing great, he says.This is just a small setback.Next time youll be wiser, savvier.I dont know if I want there to be a next time, I admit.Youre overtired, emotional, Olly says.Understandably so.When youve had time to stand back and think about this, it wont seem so bad.Its all part of the learning curve.Our lunch arrives and, as we all tuck in, Olly says, Why dont we go away?Take a week, rent a cottage somewhere.Thats a bit out of the blue.He shrugs.It might be, but think about it.When did we last have a holiday?I cant remember back that far.Give yourself a break, Nell, he pleads.Youve been so hard on yourself these last months.This is just what we need.It certainly does sound very appealing.My soul is saying that this would be a very good idea.My pocket, however, is more practical.Can we afford it?Lets find the money.Whatever it costs.What about your shifts at the pizza factory?Olly stares at one of the paintings on the wall in a manner thats a bit too determined.Theyll give me some time off.Are you sure?Yeah.Yeah.Itll be cool.Are we going on holiday, Mummy?I wipe the ring of mayo from round her mouth with a napkin.Would you like that?She nods vigorously.Can we go to the seaside?I smile across at Olly, my handsome, thoughtful husband.I dont see why not.Yay!Clearly, a holiday gets my daughters vote.I can feel the grin spread across my face too.Lets do it.Lets go somewhere fabulous and get away from it all.At the moment, I cant face seeing another bloody handbag.A break will do us all good.I need to hide away and lick my wounds and I cant think of a better way to do it.Give me a couple of days to tie up some loose ends, but theres nothing much to stop us going straight away.Ill go into the library this afternoon.Olly is all excited now.Ill see what I can book for us.Now, I say.Youve heard all my news.I want to hear about all thats happened while Ive been away.For some reason, Olly fails to meet my eyes when he replies, Oh, nothing.Nothing much at all.55      So we hire a little car and en masse, Dude included, troop down to Cornwall.Olly has hired us a quaint cottage overlooking the beach at Poltallan Bay.The village is tiny, hardly touristy at all, and a world away from the hustle and bustle of nearby Newquay.Its the perfect place to recharge your batteries.Theres an old fashioned pub, a couple of shops and a smattering of holiday rental homes.Not much else.But that suits us down to the ground.The cottage is small, homely.The ceilings low.Even I feel like I have to duck and Im a little shortie.Olly has already whacked his head a dozen times.It has just two bedrooms, a steep wooden staircase and an open plan living room.In the kitchen, theres a sturdy, family sized table in front of the window, which looks out over a small courtyard garden.It will be nice to make our home here for the week.I can actually feel the tension seeping out of my bones as I unpack.Unusually for a British beach holiday, the weather is sublime.Even though its late in the summer, the temperature pushes up to the seventies every day and the sun is a big, yellow disk in the cloudless sky.All Petal wants to do is play on the beach, morning, noon and night.We buy her a bucket and spade  she insists on the pink set  and we all keep ourselves entertained by making sandcastles and digging trenches that lead to the sea.Dude gets more walks than he knows what to do with.Hes not sure about the sea; hes absolutely desperate to go in it, but then runs away terrified when the waves rush towards him.Instead, Dudes consoling himself by barking at the seagulls.Olly rents a body board and tries his hand at surfing.Im thinking that he wouldnt necessarily be classed as a natural, but he loves every minute.I rifle through the books left in the cottage and find myself a trashy romantic comedy to read while stretched out on a blanket.This is idyllic.Truly.We all get on brilliantly.All the niggling between Olly and me has gone, vanished in the sea air.Petal doesnt have one single tantrum.I remember that this is how we used to be as a family and I wonder how weve managed to get so far away from this.Olly is right.Business isnt everything and I vow that Ill strive to achieve more of a work/life balance when we get home.Happy?Olly says as he comes to lie down beside me.This is the life, I say.You can keep your yachts in the South of France.This works for me.He traces his finger over my thigh.I do love you.And I love you.Lets never forget that.We twine our fingers together.Never, I agree.*  Already its Wednesday night.We put Petal to bed early, mainly because she was struggling to keep her eyes open while she was eating her tea.All this fresh air is great for knocking her out.I wish I could bottle it and take it back with us.Shes even stayed in her own bed every night so far and hasnt woken until nine.Bliss!Im hoping this continues when we get home, but that may be too much to ask for.The fact that she hasnt been wedged between Olly and me like an octopus on speed has meant that weve been able to rekindle our love life.Yay, us!We still have it and Olly has been particularly amorous.And Im not complaining.Weve also had long, grown up dinners, just the two of us, complete with candles and a bottle of cheap wine bought from the pub.Instead of snatching at meals that involve fish fingers, pizza and ready made whatever, weve just finished a courgette and red pepper lasagne that I made from scratch, along with a bottle of sparkling pink something.I dont have time to cook, but occasionally I like to surprise myself with a reminder that I can actually do it given the right opportunity.Across the table, Olly smiles at me in the candlelight.What do you want to do this evening, Nell?Theres no telly here, so weve been availing ourselves of the pack of cards and the board games that are here.Im not sure that Olly wants to be thoroughly thrashed at Scrabble once again.I could whoop your arse at Boggle, I suggest.You think so?Olly says, raising his eyebrows.Loser washes up.Olly takes the plates and moves them to the work surface.I was thinking of a different game.Oh, really?And with that he comes to me and kisses me long and hard.His hands slide over my body.Within seconds, were tugging at each others clothes.He moves the candle from the table and, when Im naked, lays me back on it.He takes the bottle of pink fizz, dribbles it over my body, and laps it off me.Theres a level of passion that rises inside me thats been sadly missing for a long time.I urge Olly into me and we make love on the big table and then, because we can, we do it all over again.Afterwards we curl up on the sofa together, pulling a handy throw over our hot, naked bodies.I think Id better do the washing up after that, I tease.I think so too, Olly agrees.He beats his chest.Man need rest.Oh, worn yourself out, have you?Hmm.Not entirely.Oh, really?I shift against him.Its true: hes not that tired.Hurrah!He pulls me down towards him.I do love you, he says and starts to kiss me again.Again!Clearly, all this sea air hasnt knocked my husband out like it has Petal.It seems to have put the wind in his sails.When did we last have a mad, crazy sex session like this?Good grief, I think I was about nineteen!Our bodies slide together again and we throw off the blanket, letting the cool night air from the open window caress our heated skin.Then, as Olly moves above me, my mobile phone starts to ring.Dont answer it, he gasps.Dont answer it.What if its an emergency?It wont be.But the moment is broken and, with a defeated sigh, Olly rolls off me.I lunge for the phone.The voice on the other end says, Hi, Nell.Its Tod.I pull the throw back over me and Olly pads out to the kitchen with a tut.Hi, I say.Is this a bad time?No, I lie.Not at all.Its fine.I think you need to come back, Tod says.Right away.Then he proceeds to tell me why.56      We drive home in silence.The tension in the air is palpable.Olly has the steering wheel in a death grip.His knuckles are white.His face black.Its only a day early, I point out.Two, Olly counters.I dont understand why this couldnt have waited until Monday.I cant afford to miss this opportunity.If its on the table today, then Im sure it will still be there next week.Im not so certain about that.Tod explained to me how these things work.Unless you jump, and high, then they move on to the next person.The call that unfortunately interrupted our bouncy cuddles was from Tod telling me that Home Mall  one of those huge American shopping channels  wants to feature my handbags.Its by far and away the biggest opportunity to come my way.By miles.Nell McNamara designs would get a full half hour coverage on prime time television, repeated every two hours for an entire day.All of this broadcast right across the United States.If I can secure this, then my bags will go global, stratospheric.We will be made for life!The numbers they are talking about are truly enormous.And, of course, as is always the way with these things, they need an answer yesterday.So you can see that I had to take the terrible decision to cut short the family holiday.Olly, needless to say, doesnt see it like that at all.But I feel that I had no choice.I have to get back to work on this.The logistics of such large production numbers are frightening and I needed to get back to the office, pronto, to try to get my head round it.We stayed until Friday instead of coming back on Sunday.So I think that was a fair compromise.I dont believe that two more days would have made much difference to our holiday.Wed done all the relaxing that we needed to do.Anyway, the forecast was for rain and storms.I just didnt expect the storm to be in the car on the way home.I have so much to do.The sort of numbers theyre talking about will mean that Ill have to go to China and source a manufacturer out there.This is way, way beyond what I can do with a few part time workers.Tod also said on the phone that Home Mall would need all the handbags in their warehouse ready to be shipped the same day  so theres not the comfort of getting all the orders in and then making the bags to correspond.Id have to commit to produce the stock up front.Scary.It will require some more money from the bank.And I just cant think of all these things while Im on a beach.Tod says that chances like this dont come along every day.Olly rolls his eyes whenever I quote my mentor.I just think that this sounds too good to be true.Here we are again, back to Olly being negative about everything and anything.Perhaps Im finally getting some luck, I say crisply.Perhaps things will finally start going my way.Olly doesnt look convinced.I try very hard to see his viewpoint, but he just seems to want to keep us all pinned to the earth.Is it so wrong to want to fly?This is for us.Thats a refrain thats wearing very thin, he says.How can dragging Petal away from her one proper holiday in years be for us?Our child is fast asleep in the back seat of the car, unused as she is to such luxurious travel.Theres no doubt that she was really enjoying herself.I feel mean, I say.Very mean.But how do you think Id feel if Id sat on the beach for the next two days watching this slip through my fingers?Youve decided now.Were on our way home.It doesnt matter what I say.With that, its clear that the conversation is closed.Olly turns up the radio and focuses on the road.Its going to be a very long drive home.How can I not do this?But it seems such a shame that after enjoying a few lovely days together were now warring again.Hes not going to forgive me easily for this one.Now its up to me to prove that Im right.57      Im up bright and early the next morning.Well, Im not exactly bright, but it is early.I didnt sleep much at all last night.My mind was whirring with figures and ideas.Now Im glad to be up and about so that I can crack on with my plans.Im meeting Tod for breakfast in town.One of the cafs does an excellent full English for three quid and were going to avail ourselves of it while we talk about my business plan.I thought it was better for him to not come to the shop as it would only antagonise Olly.Were not exactly giving each other the silent treatment, but were not exactly loves young dream either.I crept out of bed without waking him.Now I tiptoe out of the flat and into the coolness of the morning air.Tod is already waiting for me when I bowl up at the caf five minutes later.We order our breakfast and I tell him about our lovely holiday as we eat, leaving out the sex on the kitchen table part and the subsequent row after hed telephoned while we were at it again.Sigh.When weve eaten and the waitress has cleared the table, we spread out the notes Ive already made in front of us.When I got home from Cornwall yesterday, the contract from the shopping channel, Home Mall, had already been emailed to me.These guys certainly dont hang around.I went online and checked out their website.Its filled with clips of the show and the type of products they sell.Theres anything from books to blouses, floor mops to furniture, shoes to kitchen scales.It looks like a tightly run outfit.On a par with the other big shopping channels that are broadcast.The presenters are slick  if slightly inane  and flog the heart out of everything they pick up.The studio is a pastel hued affair complete with fake French doors, beyond which is a mural of a bright blue sea and a big yellow sun.The doors are flanked by two potted palm trees.Miami in microcosm.Frankly, I could give this a funkier makeover.I wish I could watch the programme on air  it must be put out on one of those high number channels  but our meagre budget wont run to Sky telly, so we cant get any of them.The Meyers household is strictly terrestrial.I havent heard of this outfit before, but their website looks very professional.If the others are anything to go by, itll be massive, Tod reiterates as he looks at my scribblings.They move thousands of units in each session.Thousands.Just how many they anticipate selling is listed on the email in front of me.Its a mind boggling number.I need to go to the bank on Monday and see if theyll extend my borrowing.Ive already made an appointment with my business manager who, so far, has been quite amenable to loading up my overdraft.If you have this contract to show him, then it shouldnt be a problem.The worst thing is having to pay for everything up front, but thats apparently the way these things work.All of the shopping channels pride themselves on getting the stock customers have bought through their programmes out to them very quickly.That means that vast numbers of my handbags have to be ready and waiting in their warehouse.I simply dont have the time to rush to manufacture the handbags after the orders have been received.Do you know anyone whos done this before?No.Tod shakes his head.I asked around the office.Youre the first we know of.It looks like the Nell McNamara brand is getting out there.Well done.There is one thing on the contract that worries me immensely, I confess.I have to pay over twenty thousand pounds to book the slot.Apparently, this ensures that Im serious about it.The money goes towards the cost of ware housing, shipping, the telephone ordering service and the actual filming of the products.When the programme has been aired and the orders roll in, then I get all of that money back  as long as the orders cover it.For Home Mall, it seems like a win/win situation, but theyre calling the shots and I guess thats how the cookie crumbles.Its a huge sum, Tod agrees.I ran it by the legal team at Best of Business and they seem to think its all above board.This clause isnt unusual in this sort of situation.I feel naive to have even raised the question.These people are used to dealing with far greater sums of money than I ever have and probably think nothing of it.Me, I cant help my knees shaking when I think of the money involved.Money that, of course, I dont have.It does mean, though, that all the risk is with you, not them, he points out.Are you sure that you want to take that on?I nod.At some time you have to bite the bullet and go for it.I think this is my moment.Youll have to go out to China to find a manufacturer, Tod tells me.Ive already thought about that.I toy with my spoon, stirring my coffee.Dont fancy coming with me, do you?Frankly, Im terrified of flying out there and trying to sort it all out by myself.Id love to, he says and, for a moment, my spirits lift.But theres no way that I could justify the expense.Best of Business would never cover it.They sink again.Briefly, I consider offering to pay to take Tod with me.If Im borrowing such ginormous sums then a couple more thousand is neither here nor there, surely?Then I see sense and think that I must do this alone.If Im ever going to consider myself a rufty tufty, international business woman, then I must learn to do these things by myself.But the thought of getting on a plane to China terrifies me.If theres anything else I can do, you know that Im here to help.You can always call on me.Thanks, Tod.Youve done so much for me already.I really hope this flies for you, Nell.You put so much into this; you really deserve to have success.Thanks.But no one hopes for it more than me.58      That afternoon, while Olly takes Petal out to feed the ducks in the town centre, I check what time it is in Miami, the home of the shopping channel.I take a deep breath and with her email in front of me, I call Lola Cody, Chief Executive of Home Mall.A woman with a warm, motherly voice answers the phone.I introduce myself and she bowls me over when she replies, Oh, honey, we just love your handbags here.We think they are just what Home Mall customers will go crazy for.Relief floods through me.She sounds like a normal person  just like me or you  and not some scary, high powered, anorexic, workaholic in a pinstriped suit.We are going to make you famous, she gushes on.Everyone will soon know the name, Nell McNamara.Im liking the sound of this more and more.You dont know how good that makes me feel, I tell her.I was so worried about this.No need to be, honey.Her sing song American accent soothes me.How did you hear about my handbags?Ive seen you in the English media and now I think the world should know about you!Were a very small business, I stress.Im not sure I need to go into details about quite how small.This is a huge deal for us.Plus, I recently had some of my designs ripped off, so its made me very nervous about trusting people.Youre in safe hands now, she assures me.You just send us your lovely handbags and we take care of everything else.Theres nothing at all to worry about.Here at Home Mall we simply love to launch new designers.Ive had such knock backs, I confide.That really is music to my ears.The door of the shop flings open and Olly and Petal are back from their outing to the ducks.My daughter runs into the office, arms wide, shouting, Mummy!before barrelling into me.Sssh, Petal.Mummys on the telephone to an important lady.Hello, important lady!my child shouts into the phone.So sorry, I say to Lola.As you can probably tell, my daughter has just come in.Thats my peace shattered.She sounds adorable.That is always the first impression of Petal.Shes my life, I tell her.All this is being done purely to give her a better future.At that I see Olly scowl.That is so lovely of you, Lola coos.I have two children of my own and I know just how you feel.Everything I do is for them.This lady is my new best friend.She understands exactly what it is to be a woman in business, a mother.Whats she called?Petal.Shes just four.Well, then we need to sell lots and lots of your lovely handbags for this little lady.Im putting everything in place now, I go on.This is a huge order for me.My manufacturing base here  aka me, Jenny and Constance  just isnt big enough to cope.Im going out to China next week to set up there.You come back to me just as soon as you can, she says soothingly.We want to run with this while its fresh.I take that to mean that if I dont get a move on then someone else will be snapping at my heels.You know that you need to send me a fully refundable deposit to confirm your slot?Yes, I read that in the contract.Its thirty thousand dollars.Roughly twenty grand.Twenty thousand of our English pounds!I feel the gulp travel down my throat, even as I think it.Thats a lot of money simply to prove that Im serious about this.And here I am discussing it like its two and sixpence.As soon as we have that, Lola continues, we can book a mutually suitable date and were good to go.My heart beats faster.Its as simple as that.Im really grateful for this opportunity, I say.I want to tell her how much I have struggled and how we can hardly make ends meet and how this will save us.But I think I will just come across as too pathetically grateful.You dont know what it means to us.It will, literally, turn our lives around.Well look after you here at Home Mall.Were like one big happy family.I wish I could say the same about the Meyers household, I think as I look over at Olly, who doesnt look very happy at all.59      First thing on Monday morning I organise my flight to China.There are a few factories for me to visit, all conveniently based close together in Guangzhou in the Guangdong Province.I can fly direct into Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, a place Ive never previously heard of.I book my return ticket online, which makes me feel sick with nerves.This is how confident I am that the bank will say yes to loaning me the money.With this opportunity in front of them in black and white, how could they turn me down?That done, I rush straight to the bank for my appointment.Im ushered into a plush office that Ive never been in before and am even given a cup of tea while I explain what it is that I want.This is me in the big league!Thank the heavens and all that is good, my allocated Small Business Relationship Manager, Simon North, instantly agrees to lend me the staggering amount of money Im going to need to put these handbags into production and also the sum for the deposit to book my television slot.I throw in an extra bit for sundry expenses and the total climbs to a dizzying forty thousand pounds.Simon barely flicks through the contract from Home Mall.He doesnt even hesitate.I, however, do.By any standards the interest he is charging me is extortionate.Quickly, I do my sums and work out that, even at this rate, its still viable and if all goes to plan, will still give us an enormous return on investment.At least when I get my deposit back from Home Mall I can pay off some of the money I owe the bank, which will bring the sum owed down from a puke inflicting amount to merely nausea inducing.I know that businesses do this sort of thing every day and that if Im going to make it big, then I have to get used to dealing with these kinds of numbers.Although I can rationalise it perfectly, its terrifying nevertheless.Simon North must lend out millions of pounds every single day without breaking sweat.My underarms, on the other hand, are damp with perspiration.I sign a form and he shakes my hand.The deal is done.Simon North offers me congratulations.He is smiling widely.I dont think I am.I come out of the bank shaking and clutching my loan agreement.The money will be in my bank by this afternoon.I am truly on my way now.Immediately, I call Tod to tell him my good news.He is delighted for me, as I knew he would be.It pains me that I dont feel able to call Olly and guarantee the same reaction.So instead of sharing my news with my husband, I head into town to do a few more chores.I buy a few bits for my impending trip to China, then I have a quick celebratory coffee all by myself before I have to go home and organise my entry visa.When I do, eventually, arrive back at the flat, Olly is sitting on the floor in the living room playing Jenga with Petal.It smells as if theyve just had their lunch and there are a couple of dirty plates on the work surface, a pan in the sink.Beans on toast would be my guess.I sit down next to them both just as the wooden tower topples over and, in tandem, they tut at me, even though it wasnt my fault.It was the wonky floor in here, I protest.Not me.But neither of them looks convinced.How did it go at the bank?Olly asks, though the question lacks any great enthusiasm.Good, I reply, although I cant bring myself to tell him exactly how much were in hock for now.Hed pass out.Or have a heart attack.Its giving me palpitations and Im the one who really wants all this to happen.Were all set to go.Youre all set to go, he corrects.You could come with me, I suggest.The thought perks me up.Im so not looking forward to making this trip alone.If Im honest, I dont even like getting the train down to London by myself.This is a whole new level of sheer terror.If you want to.Come out to China.I could book you a flight.Do you think you could get another week off work?At that, Olly lowers his head.What?Petal, he says.Can you please go and read a book in your room while I talk about grown up things to Mummy?I hope youre not going to shout, she replies.Were not going to shout.You always say that, she reminds him, but then you do.With that parting shot, she stomps off anyway.I wait expectantly.Then, Are we going to shout?Eventually, Olly responds.I havent got a job at the pizza factory any more.It takes me a while to process this and I stare at him, open mouthed, as I do.No job?What?Why not?I was sacked while you were in Paris, Olly admits.Why?I put sad faces on all of the mushroom and pepperoni pizzas.If this wasnt such a tragedy, Id laugh.A lot.Sad faces?They cant sack you for that.They can, Olly says.They have.Virtually the whole run had to be scrapped.And your excuse for this?He shrugs.I had stuff on my mind.I wasnt concentrating.He had stuff on his mind!Cant you ask them for your job back?He sighs now.To be honest, Nell, Im not sure that I want it back.But that was our main source of income.Its not a case of want, the way I see it.We need that money to pay our bills.Ill find something else, he says.In the meantime, at least, Im at home to look after Petal while you go gadding off round the world.Im not gadding off; Im finding a factory in China that will make my handbags.Im not going to be lying on a sunlounger with a colourful drink with a bloody umbrella in it.Im trying to keep my temper under control, but Ive had enough of Olly trying to undermine my attempts at growing this business.Jenny could look after Petal for us again.Or Constance.You cant keep dumping your kid on everyone else, he snaps.Shes your responsibility.Im well aware of my responsibilities, I bite back.Are you aware of yours?Im not the one whos lost my job for making sad faces.Olly stands up.I cant do this any more.Im sorry, Nell.I just cant.Youve changed.Nothing is the same.I dont even know who you are.I stand up too.Now youre being ridiculous.You have no time for me.Or for Petal.Weve just had a great week in Cornwall together.Did we?All I remember is having to come back early because of your stupid business.Is that really all that you remember?I raise my eyebrow at him.Because I can remember us getting on particularly well!If youre talking about our one night of passion, which was interrupted by a phone call from Tod Urban  that mocking tone again  then youre deluded.Theres no romance between us now, Nell.Is a few days of sun, sand, sea and sex in Cornwall supposed to sustain us for the rest of the year?Before then, when did we last sleep together?It wasnt for the want of trying, I remind him.Relationships arent all about sex, anyway.They arent all about work either.He shakes his head.Thats all its about now.Work.Your work.Theres nothing else left.I didnt know you felt like that.Well, now you do, he says and with that, he snatches up his jacket and thuds down the stairs, banging the door as he leaves.60      Olly walked round and round in circles for hours.He had no idea where he had been or where he was going.The afternoon was morphing into the evening and he knew that he should go back home and face Nell.But he just didnt want to, just couldnt.Instead, he headed to the pub.The Lord Dodgersley was one of the least salubrious establishments in the town centre.More commonly known as The Dodgy Arms, its floorboards were bare, the walls painted a deeply unattractive shade of matt black, the once bright red sofas jaded and stained.But it was always busy and had a great atmosphere  until the fights started.Its main attraction was probably down to the fact that it sold cheap beer and vodka shots.Always popular with the young crowd.And also the cause of most of the closing time brawls, of course.At night there were always people spilling out onto the pavement even in the depths of winter.Now, on a hot, end of summer evening, the place was heaving.There was a courtyard with patio umbrellas that was filled with business types who looked like theyd sloped out of work an hour early.They were all in high spirits and chatted loudly, all trying to outdo each other.Olly knew that if he sat out here, they would very soon get on his nerves.All he wanted was to blend in with the crowd and drink himself into oblivion.He ordered a pint of beer from the barman, then found himself a corner in which to hide and settled in for the evening.Let Nell wonder where he was.Let her stew.Shed texted him a dozen times, but hed let them all go unanswered.It was childish, but that was just how he felt.He wanted her to worry about him, to not know what he was doing or who with.A couple of hours in and he was several beers up.The world was feeling fuzzy round the edges.He ordered lasagne and chips and more beer and wondered if Nell had made any dinner for him and if it was dried up by now.When hed eaten, a brash group of girls came barrelling into the pub.They were skimpily dressed, out for a night on the town and you could hear them cackling even over the noise of the music, which wasnt exactly set at an ambient volume.The hardcore evening crowd was arriving and that meant it was probably time to go home, even though his head still wasnt straight.Hed tried to think this afternoon, think about his relationship with Nell, what was happening to them, why they constantly seemed to be at odds with each other when, previously, theyd been perfectly happy.But his brain was just a swirling mass of unconnected thoughts and no progress had been made.Olly downed his drink and stood up, ready to fight his way to the door.Not literally, he hoped.It was then that he realised he was a bit more unsteady on his feet than hed thought.Hey.Looking up, he saw that Jenny was standing in front of him.He hadnt seen her since the week shed looked after Petal.The week that theyd shared a kiss.If Jenny was thinking about that, then she didnt show it.Hi there, he said.Did it come out slurry?What are you doing here, drinking by yourself?Just needed a bit of a binge, he confessed.Off home now.Dont rush away, Jenny said, her voice urgent.Not now Ive just got here.Looks as if youre up for a big night out.Nah.She laughed.Just a few bevvies with the girls.Got to blow off steam sometimes.Yeah, Olly said.Tell me about it.Come and meet them, she said.Theyre a great bunch.Not really in the mood, Jen.I need to get back.She slipped her arm through his.The night is young, Olly Meyers, and so are you.Live a little.He felt as if he had already lived far too much.One drink, she cajoled.Just stay for one drink.Knowing when he was defeated, he held up his hands.Just the one, he said.Ill buy.Dont be silly, there are six of us.Ill stand you a round.She pulled him over to her friends.Except for Jen, they all looked more orange than was good for a woman.They also looked as if theyd walked through an explosion in a Rimmel factory before theyd arrived.It was clear that the natural look wasnt what they were aiming for.Jen introduced him to them all and he instantly forgot all of their names.It had been a long session.Longer really than hed intended.Before he knew it, a line of vodka shots appeared in front of them.Down in one, Jen said with a giggle.This was a bad idea as hed already lost count of the amount of beer hed drunk.He knocked it back anyway.Another row materialised.Then another.And possibly another.The noise got louder, so did the music.Someone was telling bad jokes to the accompaniment of women laughing raucously.Then he realised it was him.Definitely time to go.He downed whatever drink was in front of him.Outta here, he said to Jen.Nooo.She pulled him to one side, away from her friends.Before shed had time to bat her false lashes, she was pressing up against him, his back against the wall.Jen, it was obvious, had quickly caught up in the drunken stakes.Dont go, she pleaded.Stay.Cant, he said.Cant.Then her lips found his.We could leave now, she offered.Together.Her mouth was warm, soft, tempting.He could feel himself drowning in the sensation.We could go back to my place, she whispered in his ear.Now.Jens fingers roved over his chest, toyed with the buttons on his shirt.He opened his eyes and the seedy pub swam into view.Was this what he wanted from his life?To be drunk and snogging someone other than his wife?Someone who may be desperate for his body but, then again, could just be desperate for anyone?Stay the night with me, Olly, she cajoled.You know you want to.But did he?Did he really want to?Nell would never need to know.But he would know.He would know that while his wife was at home worrying about him, while his child was sleeping soundly, he would know what he was doing.He would know that he was having loveless sex with someone he barely knew.In that moment, clarity hit home.This wasnt the answer.This wasnt the answer to anything.No.He eased Jenny away from him.I need to go home.To Nell.Jens face fell, then her soft, sensual mouth hardened.She doesnt love you like I would, Olly.She takes you for granted.Nell did take him for granted.He couldnt argue with that.But he took her for granted too.Wasnt that what you were supposed to do when you were married?Werent you supposed to take it for granted that the other person would always be there for you whatever you did?If Nell could see him now, shed be devastated.What on earth was he thinking of?What a stupid fucker he was.How could he let a few drinks, an ill judged kiss, put his family, his future, at risk?Youre a great girl, Jen, he said, extracting himself from her embrace.But not as great as the one he had waiting for him at home.61      I went to bed at eleven oclock, but Olly still wasnt home.If youd have asked me, Id have said that I lay awake all night, fretting.In reality, it seems I didnt.I must have dropped off at some time, though Im sure I saw three tick by.I woke up at seven oclock, Petal beside me and no Olly.I leave my daughter sleeping  miracle  and head into the living room.He is, however, on the sofa fast asleep.My heart goes out to him.Hes all scrunched up underneath a blanket.His hair is like Jedwards on a bad day.Arm thrown above his head, hes snoring like a hibernating hedgehog.Dude, lying happily by his feet, opens his eyes and sets up a tentative wag of his tail.Tenderly, I stroke the stubble of Ollys chin, but it fails to rouse him.You wont believe how much I missed him last night.I pad to the kitchen and make tea.Dude follows me, so I give him his breakfast.When the teas ready, I sit on the edge of the sofa and watch Olly sleeping some more.Hey, he says as, eventually, I gently shake him awake.I proffer a steaming mug.Hey, yourself.Late night?Looking shame faced, he nods.I didnt want to wake you.Then, at the risk of starting an argument, Where did you get to?Pub, he says as he takes the tea and nurses it to him.The Dodgy Arms.Ooo.One of the divier dives in Hitchin.It was a bad move.Yes, I say.It was.Olly grins, despite the drink induced pallor of his face.Im sorry, he says.Im such an arse.I smile back.Yes, I agree.You are.Forgive me?I nudge him up and curl in next to him on the sofa.Dont do that again, Olly.No.I cant read the expression when he says, I did a lot of thinking last night, in the wee small hours.I want to be more supportive.I want to be involved in your business  Its not my business.Its ours, I interject.I know.I know that.Im proud of you and what youre trying to do.It just frightens me, Nell.The money involved, the pressure.It scares me.He shakes his head.But what scares me more is the thought that I might lose you.Thats never going to happen, I promise.But if were going to survive this, and I know its stressful  I give a small internal shudder as I think of the loan Ive just taken on   then we need to talk.Its no good running away from problems.Or going to get pissed.Petal comes in rubbing her eyes.Whats pissed?It means getting drunk, I say.And its not a very nice, grown up word.So I dont want to hear it from you.Then you shouldnt say it, Mummy, she advises.Ill try to remember that.Come and give me a cuddle, Olly says, and my daughter clambers across the dog, then my lap, and lands on top of Olly who gives out an ouff.Hah.Learn this, husband: no time for a hangover when youve got a four year old.Daddy had a little bit too much beer, Olly admits to our daughter.Be gentle.So she bounces up and down on his stomach.Nice one, Petal.Ill go and start breakfast, I say, and leave Petal to torture him.Then, from the kitchen, Was The Dodgy busy last night?We havent been there in years.Rammed, he replies.As always.Jenny often drinks in there.Really?Yeah.God knows why.A bit of toast is probably all that Olly can manage this morning.I crack open the Coco Pops for Petal.There are better places to go  unless youre drowning your sorrows.Touch, Olly acknowledges.Did you bump into anyone we know last night at The Dodgy?No, Olly says.No one at all.62      Heathrow Airport.Ten thirty on Thursday night.Petal is crying.Im on the verge of tears too.Dont go, Mummy, she wails.Heartstrings.Twang!See you next week, Olly says.He strokes my cheek.Come back safely.This is hell.Sheer hell.Taking Petal in my arms, I hold her tightly.As its late, shes already dressed in her snuggly pyjamas so that shell sleep in the car on the way back.I was going to travel down to the airport by train, but Olly insisted that he drive me and borrowed a clapped out Corsa from his mate, Tom, so that he could do so.I wanted to leave Petal with Constance, but Olly insisted that she come with us.Now Im still thinking it was a bad idea as I can hardly bear to be parted from her.With very little persuasion, I would turn round, go home, and not get on this flight at all.Why on earth am I going to China?I dont even like rice.Or noodles.The thought of going somewhere as far away and as foreign as China, completely alone, is making me feel sick to my stomach.It also seems as if Im going for six months rather than a week.Since Ollys bender, hes been very solicitous and much more supportive.Now I wonder why Im going away at all.I cant do this, I say.You can.He kisses me.Ill look after everything at home.Dont worry about anything.You just do what youve got to do.As Ollys still not working, we havent had to draft in Jenny or Constance to help out and hell be around full time to look after the Petalmeister.Every cloud has a silver lining, I guess, although I hope that he gets a job as soon as I come back as money is getting very thin on the ground and my credit card is maxed.My bag is already checked in and its time for me to go through to the departure lounge so Im not rushing to find my gate.Im convinced that Ill get on the wrong plane and end up in Timbuktu or somewhere.I love you, sweet pea.
