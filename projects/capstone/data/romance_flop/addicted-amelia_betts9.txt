When we kissed, it was strange but exciting.Now I have this weird feeling, like maybe he should have been the one I was obsessing over all along.Hes so smart and inspiring Whats Cecile going to say?Ooh, shes gonna hate you!Gracie hissed, diabolically amused.Oh God, I didnt even think about that.And we were just starting to get along.You know youre closer to her age than his.Barely.Im like exactly in between.Hes thirty five, right?Something like that.And shes fourteen?I nodded.So youre about two times closer to her age.She smiled with her mouth closed.Im a wizard at basic math.Gracie!Why are you making me feel bad now?Youre the one who encouraged this in the first place!Hey, Im just teasing you.Age aint nothing but a number.So tell me what happened.How did you leave it?I shook my head and took a bite of my taco.Thats the thing.He kind of ran away.Okay, start from the beginning, she said, and crumpled one of her taco wrappers into a ball.Gracie listened attentively as I gave her the play by play.When I got to the kissing part, she demanded every detailwhere had he put his hands?How long was his tongue?Were his kisses hard or soft?and nodded enthusiastically enough to give herself whiplash.I was embarrassed talking about the specifics, but I obliged her because she was like a sister, and spilling the details allowed me to relive everything in my mind.After Id told all there was to tell, Gracie dropped into a brief melancholy, apparently remembering the heartache shed briefly escaped while listening to my story.Listen, I know Im in a happy mood today, but who knows whats going through Juliens mind.If Ive learned anything these past few weeks, its that the only person I should count on for my own happiness is myself.Preach, said Gracie with a solemn nod.Easier said than done.But Ive been trying to make some positive changes lately, and I think its working.I started actually participating in OA instead of just lurking in the back and not saying anything, and Ive been eating healthy, and started praying Waityou found Jesus?She slapped a hand down on my knee, her eyes as big as saucers, and not in a good way.No, nothing like that.I just started praying to some unspecified god.Well, Ill try anything once.She rolled her eyes up to the sky and pretended to whisper something rapidly, then clicked her tongue and winked.Got it, God?Got it, I answered in my best all knowing God voice, then hopped up from the bench and held a hand out for my friend.* * * On our way back home, we formulated the following grand plan: Greek yogurt face masks and a movie marathon on my temperamental laptop.The first stop, however, would be at the main houseGracie was hell bent on reuniting me and Julien after last night.I want to see the sparks!she insisted.But despite her purported enthusiasm, I could tell Gracie was struggling.She had put this Richard person on a pedestal only to find out he was a world class jerk like so many of the other guys she had fallen for.It was a feeling I knew too well, but there was nothing I could say to make it any easier, so I focused on driving us home.Meanwhile, Gracie stared out the window, occasionally pointing to her old Oceanside haunts and proclaiming how little she missed them.As we pulled up to the house, I saw Juliens car in the driveway and felt my body tense.At least I would have Gracie with me to break the tension with her witty one liners.At the front door, I knocked gently before letting us in.Just like this morning, the house seemed empty.I led Gracie on a tour of the downstairs in hopes of running into Julien, to no avail.So heres where I keep all my food and make my meals, et cetera, I said as we entered the kitchen, noticing Cecile out of the corner of my eye as she came bopping in behind us.Hi.Who are you again?she demanded, giving Gracie a once over.Cecile!I believe you met Gracie this morning, I said politely, hoping to encourage some hospitality on her part.Gracie, Cecile.Cecile, Gracie.Hi again!Gracie extended her hand, but Cecile only grasped the tips of her fingers, purposely making the handshake as awkward as possible.Please be kind, Cecile.I was pulling vegetables out of the refrigerator, buying more time in the kitchen by making a salad that neither Gracie nor I were hungry for.Yes, Cecile, Im very fragile right now, Gracie added.Ignoring Gracies comment, she sidled up to me at the counter.Whatcha making?Salad.You want some?Yeah.Im gonna copy everything you eat from now on because youre losing weight and Im not.I glanced at her sideways.I disagree.I think you look great.Probably from all that swimming youre doing.Gracie plopped down on a stool and stole a carrot from my cutting board.Cecile, dont worry about it.I was my chubbiest when I was your age, lost a bunch in high school.No diet, no nothing.Hearing this, Cecile looked happier than Id ever seen her.Really?Oh yeah.Plus, guys like a little meat on the bones, believe me.People say that, but I dont believe it.Cecile moved around the counter to sit by Gracie, who was quickly becoming her new favorite person.No, its true, but dont worry about what guys want anyway.Theyre all asswipes.Except for your dad, of course.Gracie glanced over at me with an impish smile.My cheeks flushed, and I shook my head to discourage her.Why would you say my dad?You dont even know him.Cecile eyed her suspiciously.Wait, are you the one who sent that text?Droolian Poundwell?Huh?Is that another language?I dont know what youre talking about.Gracie shot me another impish glance.I glowered at Cecile, unwilling to reopen the can of worms that I had hoped was closed by now.I was just saying, Gracie went on, Im sure your dads not an asswipe because dads are kind of exempt.Exempt from what?Juliens voice carried in from the hallway as he made his way into the kitchen.Stricken with fear that he had overheard the entire exchange, I looked up mid chop and let my knife slide, accidentally scraping a layer of skin off the tip of my left thumb.Hello!I said nervously.You saw Gracie earlier, right?I was speaking entirely too loudly, and my thumb had started dripping blood onto the cutting board.Ew.Youre bleeding.Cecile pointed to my hand, which I tried to conceal as I went to run it under the sink.Hi again, Gracie.Julien waved, polite and formal.Cecile, go get a Band Aid for Mischa.He nodded toward the guest bathroom, and Cecile grudgingly obeyed.Making his way over to the sink, Julien patted my shoulder.I blinked my eyes closed, enjoying the rush of being near him again as his hand gripped the base of my neck and massaged it for a few blissful seconds that told me, Yes, I wanted you last night and still do.You have a beautiful home!Gracies voice piped in from behind us, bringing me back to reality.And although I wasnt technically invited here, I appreciate the hospitality.Juliens hand dropped away from me as he turned to face her.Youre very welcome.So hows D. C. ?You mean the land of sleazy politicians and all things foul and soulless?Hey, thats my hometown youre talking about, he chided.Oh really?Did you tell me that before?Mischa, did you know Julien was from D. C. ?Gracie had always been a very generous, if obvious, wingman.She liked to draw me into conversations with pointless, rhetorical questions.I dont know, I answered, turning off the faucet and sticking my still bleeding thumb in my mouth.She probably didnt know, Julien said.No.I took my thumb out of my mouth.You told me.I couldnt help but grin at the memory of our stolen afternoon together at Salty Sals.In hindsight, it seemed so romantichow could I have seen it any other way?Julien, on the other hand, was poker faced as he accepted the Band Aid from Cecile.Part of me (well, all of me) wished he had less self restraint in front of his daughter and my friend.I wanted his arm around my shoulders, the heat of his body against mine.Remember?I said, daring to nudge him with my elbow.My first day at work?Julien unwrapped the Band Aid and gently took my hand, looking into my eyes with an intensity that made me quiver.The look seemed to have meaning behind it, but I couldnt tell if it was good or bad.Strangely, I dont, he said, lowering his eyes to the task at hand as he placed the Band Aid on my cut.Anyway!He glanced up at the clock above the pantry, and the Band Aid wrapper drifted from his palm to the floor.I gotta get to campus.I know its bad form to work on a Saturday but Im behind on the writing.But, Dad!You said we would go to the mall!Cecile whined.Tomorrow, sweetie.Im all yours then.Julien glanced back at me as he walked out of the room, and my heart swelled.Oh, Mischa?Yes?I answered expectantly, hoping for an inside joke or a coded reference to last night.Will you girls be around tonight?I have another dinner and I dont want Cecile to be on her own here.Umm Trying to hide my disappointment, I looked at Gracie, whose own face bore a sympathetic frown.Were you wanting to go out tonight?And get a taste of the thriving Oceanside social scene that Ive been missing so dearly in D. C. ?Julien chuckled as Gracie shook her head slowly.Well be here, I said.Okay, great!He smiled and shot me a thumbs up before disappearing down the hall.With Julien out of sight, I let out a long sigh, pretending that my thumb was the cause of my consternation as I held it up for examination.I might need a second Band Aid.Cecile, would you get me another one?Whats in it for me?She cocked her head, arms crossed, like she was auditioning for the role of Bratty Teenager #1.Gracie rolled her eyes.Just get her the Band Aid, she said authoritatively.Later, when we had retreated back to the guesthouse, I finally allowed my face to match my emotions: a mix of lovesickness, confusion, and fear.You dont look too good, Gracie remarked.I shook my head.I think that cut was deeper than it looked       Seventeen Friday, mid July: emergency meeting held in Julien Maxwells guesthouse Topic of discussion: Julien Maxwell Calories imbibed: Not enough I dont know what I expected him to say or do.I mean, his daughter was right there.Like a lost puppy I followed Gracie, who had just emerged from the shower, as she wandered around the room trying to get dressed.Well, you know what my opinion of men is right now.So all I have to say is, expect the least.Gracies mood had turned somewhere between our afternoon salad course and now.I couldnt blame her, but her bummed out vibe wasnt helping me.Youre right, I said.I dont think hes in a place for a relationship right now.Or hes not sure yet.And I understand its nothing personal.I mean, the mans wife died tragically.Who knows how long that takes to get over?She pulled a T shirt over her head and shook out her wet hair.Well, as long as youre fine with that.I just dont know where that gets you.I think Julien and I might have a future, I really do.Ill just have to be patient!Gracie glanced at me incredulously through wet bangs.I thought you werent even sure how you felt about him.No.I think the problem is just timing, I said, continuing to pace.This may not be the best time for him, and I may not get accepted into Reid.Meaning, Ill have to move somewhere else, and then it becomes a long distance thing Where would you go?she interrupted my rant.New Mexico.But I havent responded yet.Im still waiting on Reid.Well, no offense, but dont you think figuring that out should be your biggest priority right now?Not whether some old dude can get over his dead wife in time for you to have a slightly inappropriate student teacher romance?To this, my eyes widened in disbelief.I shook my head in slow motion.Wow, Gracie, some old dude?You referred to him as a god earlier, did you not?Also, since when are you the voice of reason on inappropriate romances?Im pretty sure slutting around in public bathrooms with spoiled brat senators like Richard could be considered slightly inappropriate too.Gracie stopped in her tracks, as if someone had just body blocked her.Are you kidding me?Shit, Im sorry, I said, instantly regretting my choice of words.She turned toward me, her eyebrows knitted.Slutting around?Slutting around?Thank you very much for that unwarranted judgment.I didnt mean it that way.No, really, that means a lot coming from someone whos been having sex with a nymphomaniac who fell off the wagon Like you wouldnt have.Oh, stop acting like you know me so well.Well stop acting like you know everything about everything!I was shouting now, my voice high pitched and irritated.Maybe I would if youd stop begging me for advice.I should have known better than to come here when I needed something.Of course all we end up talking about is you!She ripped a hairbrush through her hair and threw it back down in her bag.We went on like that, lobbing back and forth insults for another minute before Gracie finished dressing herself and stormed out.I allowed her to go, too emotionally exhausted to follow and knowing shed be back because she had nowhere else to stay.But hours later, when she hadnt returned by sunset, I started to worry.And by the time Id joined Cecile in the living room, where she was watching some contrived reality show about two teenage girls on a blind date with the same guy, I felt absolutely horrible.Is there anything else on?I asked, plopping down on the rigid love seat that sat farthest away from the TV.Surprisingly compliant, Cecile switched the channel to an action movie featuring some lesser known comic book character.Thats better.Whats wrong with you?Nothing.You sound like someone killed your goldfish.Cecile smirked.I dont have a goldfish.And if I did, I probably would have eaten it in a moment of food mania.I threw my legs over the armrest.Gracie and I had a fight.My teenage companion chuckled and made a joke insinuating that Gracie and I were secret lovers.Other than that, she took it easy on me, which I greatly appreciated.My day had been hard enough already.The movie didnt do much to distract me, but I needed the company, so I stayed until the end, pretending to care what happened to the shape shifting hero.Then I realized I hadnt eaten dinner and offered to cook something for the both of us.Yes!Im starving!Cecile answered.She hopped up from the couch and ran into the kitchen before me.When I rounded the corner, she was holding up a box of mac and cheese and saying please over and over again, like a four year old.Nope.Broiled salmon and veggies, I said as if I were talking to a four year old.And though she put up a fight, Cecile ended up eating every bit of it as I took slow, arduous bites myself, my mind bouncing back and forth between Julien and Gracie.For Ceciles part, she was mostly silent, texting throughout dinner with her clique of swim team friends, but at some point she leaned over the table and spoke to me in a conspiratorial voice.So, are you like totally depressed because Droolian Poundwells on a date right now?What?My fork dropped out of my hand and rattled onto the plate below it.Oops!I said, trying to act cool as I picked it back up.I thought he said it was a work thing?Nope.He totally didnt.I knew you would be sad.Look at your face.There she wasthe old Cecile back in action.I swallowed hard as my heart sank into a void.I had been barely treading water before, after Juliens hard to read behavior that afternoon and then my fight with Gracie, but now I was at risk of crying right there at the table.Im pretty sure he said it was a work thing, I repeated, my words clipped and defensive, painfully aware that I was blowing my cover.I heard him talking to her on the phone.Believe me, its a date.She sounded more certain than Id ever heard a fourteen year old sound beforeher humorless tone of voice was bone chilling.I pushed some salmon aimlessly around my plate and fought the urge to ask her about the woman.I lasted about three seconds.Who is it?I said impatiently.That new professor lady, I dont know her name.Shes visiting from New York.Shes skinny and she wears all black.Much more his type.You saw her?I couldnt help but jump on Ceciles every word.My knees were taking turns bouncing rapidly under the table.She came by to drop off a book a couple days ago.Oh.I nodded and took a miniscule bite of fish, choking it down even though my throat felt like it was closing up.A new text alert sounded and Cecile refocused her attention on the phone in her hand.Im sure its nothing.Colleagues exchange books all the time, I said.She looked up from her phone, one eyebrow raised.Hes on a date, Mischa.You should probably accept it.I have.Cecile went back to ignoring me while she sent a few more rapid fire texts.I told him about that text you know.She looked up and grinned, baring her silvery braces.And you know what he said?Mischas harmless.He said that?I couldnt believe it.Harmless?It was the worst thing he could have called mein my mind, in that moment.A knock on the front door interrupted, at which point Cecile and I both rushed to the foyer.I got there first and boxed her out, peering into the peephole to find Gracie on the front stoop.Relieved to see my friend again, I swung the door open wide and embraced her so abruptly that she had no option but to hug back.Im sorry, I said.I know, me too.She patted my back.Ugh, you guys are disgusting, Cecile said, then zoomed in on her phone as if some dire emergency had just come up.As she scampered upstairs, I was relieved to see her go.I drew Gracie into the living room.I gotta tell you something, I whispered.Me too, she said.I could tell from the look in her eye that whatever she had to say wasnt good.You first.Gracie squinted, hesitating.Is it about your guy?She shook her head.No, your guy.Did you see him or something?Cecile said he was on a date.I shoved an index finger into my mouth and started biting away at the nail.Gracie pursed her lips together.Yeah.Where?I demanded, carelessly spitting a bit of nail onto the floor.At that bar by the movie theater.I went for a drink, and they were there, in a booth.Did he see you?I dont think so.They were kind of into each other.Oh my God.I collapsed onto the couch.Youre cuter.And younger, obviously.I cant believe this, I said, burying my face in my hands.Cecile told him about the text, and he said that I was harmless.Gracie leaned over and situated the pillows behind me like a nurse attending to a terminally ill patient, which I suddenly felt like I was as she sat down at my side.Im such an idiot, I whimpered.Dont beat yourself up.After seeing him this afternoon, I kept telling myself he must not be ready for a relationship.That if it doesnt work out, its just bad timing.But no, he just didnt want me.Surprise, surprise.I know how you feel.Gracie took my hand.Were in this together, okay?Guys suck.Well at least the ones we find.Exactly.Oh my God.I dont even want to think about it!I closed my eyes, wishing I could fall into a deep sleep and not wake up for a month.I had been doing so well just a couple of days ago.Why had Julien insisted on barging into my personal life and messing it all up?I mean, I didnt even want him!Hes the one who started this!I know.Gracie looked up at the ceiling, seemingly searching her brain for something to cheer me up.Finally landing on an idea, she snapped her fingers.Okay, heres what Im thinking.Im only here till tomorrow night, right?So I figure we have two options: go out and get drunk, or watch sappy movies in your bed and braid each others hair.Movies and braids, please.I smiled, feeling my misery lift the tiniest bit as Gracie smiled like a deranged person and patted her knees, trying to get me to laugh.Lets do it, then!she said, Distraction, distraction, distractionthe name of the game.I leaned my head on Gracies shoulder and grabbed her arm.Im so glad youre here.Me too me fuckin too, she said.* * * Despite our grand plans for a late night double feature, Gracie and I both passed out before the first movie was halfway through.We obviously needed the sleep, because we made it a full ten hours before either of us so much as stirred.Even more surprising was that when I awoke the next morning, my hair in a half finished French braid, I felt oddly neutral.I even noticed the birds singing again, which seemed like a good sign.Maybe I had simply had enough of the ups and downs.The past few weeks had been so intense, my brain had finally overloaded and fizzled out.I was left with a strange sensation of blankness that helped when I saw the text from Liam on my phone: Hows it going?L It was time stamped 1:15 a. m.  When I first saw it, Gracie was still sleeping, but I didnt need to consult her to know how to respond.Things are good, I replied, then, I cant be in touch with you.I hope you understand  It was harsh, perhaps, but I didnt know what else to say.I felt certain that no good would come from inviting the drama of Liam back into my life, and the fact that he had contacted me late at night seemed to speak for itself.When Gracie awoke, in a better mood herself, I didnt tell her about it.Instead, I invited her to come with me to Isabellas for my weekly visit and she happily accepted, having never met her before.Not surprisingly, the two got along like old war buddies.Oh my God, why have you been keeping us apart?Gracie demanded while passing Isabellas e cigarette back to her.They were sitting at the patio table as I brought out a tray with six glasses.I havent been keeping you apart.You were always too hungover to come with me, remember?I said.Thats my girl, Isabella cheered, giving Gracie a high five.Okay, here we go.I placed three glasses before each of them.Okay!Gracie clapped her hands.The Mischa Jones soon to be patented juice cleanse!Thats right.So its a juice in the morning, a juice in the afternoon, and a smoothie at night.Water all day.Herbal tea optional.Sounds like my own version of hell.Hit me!Gracie picked up her first glass of juice and held it up to toast Isabella.Heres to new friends.Yes, my dear, and to our dear Mischa.Isabella thrust her glass toward me.May this juice not suck.Hear, hear!Before drinking, Gracie sniffed at the glass like a picky child.Isabella, on the other hand, downed hers quickly.I want you to be brutally honest, I said.Gracie held up a finger.I will reserve comment until I have finished all three.This one tastes like grass, but I do not hate it, Isabella declared before moving on to the next.So, let me tell you what my plan isthe idea came to me the other day, and I think its a good one.Im going to present this to Sasha as something she could sell at her spa.Like have them in a refrigerator by the front desk.People go in, they get a massage and a facialthey feel all clean, then bam!Clean living, at their fingertips, upon checkout.Thats kind of genius, Gracie said, sipping from her second glass.I figure Ill make a few batches at the beginning of the week, put them in glass bottles.Theyll be expensive, but the clientele is rich   Isabella tried the smoothie, which was a slight deviation on the peanut butter smoothies I had been making her.Delicious, she said.Gracie looked up at me after trying the smoothie.Mischa?Gracie?She pounded the table.Five thumbs up!Seriously?Yum!And the juices have kick!And I have a distinct sense that theyre doing something for me.Im buzzing.I blew the hair out of my face demonstratively.Phew.I wanna take this shit to Washington.Straight to the top!I know its not a future plan, per se, but at least its something, right?I mean, I still have to figure out my life.Dont we all?Gracie said, suddenly wan.Oh, you girls have such a flair for the dramatic.Call me when youre incontinent like Carl over there, she said, pointing to a house across the street.Gracie and I burst into laughter at the same time and Isabella raised her smoothie for another toast.To Carl!To Carl, we all said in unison.In two hours, I would be sharing a tearful goodbye with Gracie, but the fact that she was here now felt like a small miracle.As we left Isabellas, I thanked her so many times for coming to Oceanside, she threatened to knock me out.But I truly felt like she had saved me that weekendshe may as well have shown up with little angel wings jutting out from her vintage acid washed jean jacket.Even though she had come to Oceanside needing me, I had needed her right back.* * * Monday morning was like a cold splash of water to the head.I felt as though I had just returned from a long, exotic vacationexcept the vacation had been nothing but heart wrenching drama.Despite the emotional hangover, I was ready to get back to the grind and face the good, the bad, and the ugly of my life.In a way, I was back to where Id started in June, when Id first been faced with the existential questions about my plans for the future, or lack thereof.Only now, I was eight pounds lighter and actively heartbroken.Oh well, was all I could think.Time to switch into survivor mode.First thing after I woke up, I sent an e mail to Sasha about the juice cleanse, asking if shed be open to a presentation.It had to be worded just rightthis was a woman who liked to be fooled into things, and luckily I knew how to make Sasha feel like I was trying to help her instead of the other way around.Writing the e mail also bought me some time so I wouldnt run into Julien in the kitchen; he had recently established a pattern of leaving for the office before nine a. m. , while I had started showing up to campus around ten.I had been so frustrated, initially, when hed started sending me off to the library to spend entire days at the Xerox machine.But now, having to face Julien alone for the first time since our kiss, I could not have been more relieved by my little hardship post.It meant I would only have to endure a few awkward minutes of niceties with him before retreating to the library where I could mope in peace if need be.After breakfast, I packed my lunch, which consisted of green salad and grilled chicken.At some point I was going to need to get more creative about my healthy diet instead of eating the same boring things over and over again, but not today.Like they often said in OA: baby steps!A punishing heat wave had descended early that morning and my car was sweltering when I got inside.It must have been 110 degrees in there.Feeling the first trickles of sweat spotting my T shirt, I rolled the windows down and cranked the air conditioning self indulgently as I mentally prepared for a face to face with Julien.The drive to campus went by too quickly for my liking, thanks to the empty roads and stoplights that seemed permanently green.It was as if everyone had gone out of town just in time to escape the weather.Arriving at the Lit building, I climbed the front steps and another flight of stairs to the second floor where Juliens office was tucked away at the end of the hall.The trek was not enough to warrant how out of breath I was by the time I appeared in his open doorway.Nerves had taken over and I was nearly panicked, but I tried my hardest to look indifferent.The truth was, I had no interest in talking about things; I didnt need him to tell me that he was seeing somebody, for I knew now that whatever we had had was over before it even began.Knock, knock!I announced myself, my feet stopping at the wooden divider between the hardwood floors of his office and the granite tiled hallway.Mischa.Can you come in for a second?Julien looked up from his laptop and placed his hands on his lap.He seemed grave.Nope.Not a good time, is what I wanted to say, but as I tried to come up with a proper excuse, I heard myself practically gasping for air.Sorry, Im a little winded from climbing those stairs.I was just stopping to check in actually.I have plenty of copying left to do from Friday, so Why dont you sit down?He gestured to the chair across from his desk.It wont take long.Well, theres nothing for me really to go over.I just wanted to make sure you didnt have anything else that needed prioritizing before I went to the library.I added a nonchalant wave of the hand to make clear how absolutely indifferent I was as my cheeks burned bright red.If you dont mind, Mischa, I think we should talk.He nodded to the seat across from him, and I looked at it for a few seconds as my feet seesawed on the wooden divider.I tried, and failed, to come up with some reason why I couldnt stay, then finally relented.Do you mind closing the door?he said after Id started to move inside.Glancing behind me at the open door, I feared that once it was closed, Julien would launch into some insufferable speech about how we could never be together and how absolutely perfect this visiting professor was for him and all the ways that she outshined me.Perhaps he would stick a few extra nails in the coffin by using phrases like I dont know what I was thinking, or Its not you, its me.But at the end of the day he was still my boss, so I closed it like he asked.So!I sat down with a freshly applied fake grin, placing my hands on my knees in a solicitous pose.Whats up?Julien leaned forward in his chair and snapped his computer shut.We need to talk about what happened between us.Right.That.No, we really dont, I said.Ive seriously totally forgotten about it.Mischa Seriously!Id tell you if I wanted to talk about it.Im not really a big talker, in general.Cecile mentioned you were upset when you heard about my date on Saturday.I didnt even tell her I had gone on a date, and I certainly didnt want you to hear it that way.I cant imagine how it must have felt, after what we shared on Friday.Tears started to well in the corners of my eyes.I licked my lips and squinted, squeezed my thighs with my hands, anything to keep from crying.Tears would make it look like I cared about him more.He would get the wrong idea.But nothing could stop the determined little droplets as they started to trickle down my cheeks.I didnt tell Cecile about us, if thats what youre worried about, I said.And whatever she told you about that text its not what it sounds like.I know.Im not worried about Cecile right now.Im worried about you.Well dont be worried.Im fine.Believe it or not, youre not my real heartbreak of the summer.I wanted to sound harsh and dismissive, but my cracking voice and dampened cheeks betrayed me.I wish nothing had ever happened so we wouldnt have to have this conversation, I said, succumbing further to my heaving breaths that bordered on sobs.As I worked to even out my breathing, I noticed his eyebrows had scrunched up toward the middle of his forehead, and he was biting his lip.It seemed like a studied look, one that hed used before, no doubt, to beg forgiveness.Mischa, I just want you to know that I care about you, and I never meant for things to go as far as they did.You deserve to be with someone whos right for you, someone whos not your teacher.Were.You were my teacher.Its more than that.Theres a lot of reasons we cant be together.For one thing, Im leaving.I took a new position in New York.What?I braced the sides of my chair, rocked by the news.Regardless of what had happened in the past few days, I had come to view Julien and Cecile as a sort of surrogate family in Oceanside.The thought of them up and leaving felt like a betrayal.Ill be here through fall semester.Well move in the winter.Cecile doesnt even know yet.I shook my head in disbelief.A million questions swirled through my mind.How long had he known?Was it going to be a permanent move?Would he sell his house?Does she know?I finally asked, sounding unintentionally jealous.Who?he said.The woman youre dating.Andrea?Shes from New York, actually.Shes only here as a visiting professor.Well, thats perfect, I said.It was like some bitter ex girlfriend of Juliens had taken over my body.It wasnt that I was so hurt by him, specifically, just that everything with Liam and Julien combined had left me so disillusioned.Mischa, listen to me.You have an amazing life ahead of you, and I have no interest in bogging you down.Yes, we were drawn to each other, but that doesnt mean it makes sense.Right, like another professor makes sense, I said, still digging in, unable to stop myself fighting for something I hadnt even wanted in the first place.Because we should all be with people who are exactly like us.What about all the great love stories that we read about, the ones that you teach?What about what about Janie and Tea Cake from Their Eyes Were Watching God?I was grasping at straws, still trying to impress him with literary references.Because were not living in a novel, Mischa!Because Tea Cake got rabies and had to be shot!Juliens voice had become stern and loud and he was leaning forward in his seat impatiently.Fine.I stood up from my chair, my eyes searching the ground as if my pride were something I had accidentally dropped there and just needed to be picked back up.I shouldnt be here.Im gonna go to the library.Ill find another place to stay as soon as possible His face softened.What are you talking about?If you dont mind, I want to keep the job until I find something else.You dont have to move out.Youre welcome to stay through the fall if you want.Cecile loves having you there, and so do I.  Yeah, its been real convenient for you, hasnt it?Mischa, thats not fair.I have to move, Julien.I have to move on with my life.I wiped my face with the backs of my hands and walked slowly to the door, careful not to trip or do something else embarrassing in my fragile state.As I opened the door, Julien called out to me and I turned to look back.Mischa, I wanted to be a mentor to you, but I screwed up.Im sorry, okay?I nodded, tacitly accepting his apology but offering nothing in return.He smiled and bit his lip againthis time, not so studied.See you back at the house.I looked at Julien a few more seconds before leaving.This was the face that sent butterflies aflutter in my stomach a mere forty eight hours ago.Now it just made me sad, and I couldnt bring myself to return his awkward smile.Eighteen I made my way down the second floor hallway of the Lit building like a convict whod just been released from prison, with no idea where to go.I was thankful, at least, that the building was completely empty.All summer, I had only seen one other professor there, an older white haired woman named Dr.Dixon who taught Russian literature.I had never had a class with her, but Id heard she was tough.As a person, though, she seemed nice enough, and I always smiled and waved into her office when she was in.Passing by her office, I saw it was closed and figured she had finally gone on vacation, but then, in the stairwell, I heard a set of footsteps coming and realized it must be her.I didnt want to be spotted with my puffy eyes and wet cheeks, but unless I turned and ran at that very moment, there would be no avoiding her.Oh, dear, I heard her say when we crossed paths on the landing between the first and second floors.Much to my chagrin, Professor Dixon was staring at my face with a look of concern.
