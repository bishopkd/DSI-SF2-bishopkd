The warmth of her skin radiated outward through the thin material, and as he began to rub the area, he tried to stay focused on the fact that it was supposed to be a therapeutic massage and nothing more.Hmm, that feels so good, she said, her voice a soft whisper.Lucas didnt reply.He couldnt.His breath was caught in his chest, making speech impossible as desire welled up inside him.He tried to tamp it down, but it refused to dissipate and instead seemed to grow bigger, stronger inside him.As he rubbed her back with one hand he reached with the other and touched a strand of her hair.It was luxuriously silky, just as hed expected.He closed his eyes against a new wave of want.Its just a back rub, he tried to tell himself.And yet it felt as intimate as anything hed ever experienced.Her heat, her scent seemed to fill him up.Her tiny mewls of pleasure scorched through him.His jeans grew tight at his groin as he felt himself responding to her.For Gods sake, what was wrong with him?She was pregnant.She didnt even know her name.This whole thing was completely inappropriate.But nothing his brain told him seemed to be making a connection with his body.He knew he should stop and run from the room, that he was being sucked into a desire greater than any hed ever felt before.And yet he continued rubbing her back and caressing her hair, trying to tell himself that he was only doing what she needed, not what he wanted.She moaned and stretched with pleasure.The sound shot a new surge of electricity through his veins.He had to stop, before things spiraled out of control.Get out, a voice screamed in his head, but he didnt.He couldnt.He was caughttrapped by his own desire to continue.Instead he worked his hands from her lower back up to the center of her back, then to her shoulders, using just enough pressure to ease but not hurt her tight muscles.I cant tell you how good this feels, she said, her voice slightly husky.She turned a bit so that she could look at him, and the curve of her jaw begged for an exploration by his mouth, her lips tormented him as they curved into a soft smile.You give a great massage, she said.He dropped his arms to his sides and stood.Better?The smile fell from her face and she eyed him with an intensity that halted his heart for another long beat.Better, she replied.She sat up and grabbed his hand.Dont go, Lucas.Lie here with me and talk for a little while.I dont feel like being alone right now.She patted the bed next to her.Suddenly he couldnt think of any place hed rather be than spending a wintry night in bed with her.No big deal.Were just going to talk, he told himself.Still, as he stretched out on the mattress that was still warm with her body heat, he wondered what in the hell he was doing.IT FELT RIGHT for Lucas to be next to her on the bed.Jane leaned up on one elbow and gazed at him, taking in each and every detail of his features.She loved the length of the lashes that framed his dark eyes and the quirky smile that eased some of the darkness that clung to him.Dark whiskers shadowed the lower half of his jaw and they only added to his rugged, slightly dangerous attractiveness.Youre staring at me, he said, looking decidedly uncomfortable.She reached out and placed her palm on his cheek.I like looking at you, she replied.You have a nice face, Lucas Washington, but you have the eyes of an old soul.Growing up with a father like mine, I guess I aged quickly, he replied.And if I wasnt a man when I joined the navy, I quickly became one.She dropped her hand from his face and frowned thoughtfully.I cant imagine what you went through.Even though I dont have any real specific memories, I think I had a happy childhood.Im glad.Id like you to have happy memories from your childhood.I can tell you thisyou dont have a criminal record of any kind.She looked at him in surprise.How do you know that?He looked slightly sheepish.I took a glass youd used to a buddy of mine who works in the crime lab.He got your fingerprints off the glass and ran it through the system.You werent in there.Why didnt you tell me you did that?I just told you.He smiled.I didnt want to tell you before I knew the results.Thats definitely a relief.But what would you have done if I was some sort of criminal?she asked curiously.I guess I would have had to handcuff you and turn you over to my friend Wendall, he replied with a teasing light.Of course, its possible youre just a very smart, good criminal and have never been caught.She moved closer to him, reveling in the scent of him, the warmth of his body radiating out to her.She didnt particularly want to talk.What she wanted was for him to wrap her in his arms.She wanted to feel his lips against hers once again.She wanted to caress his bare skin.She wanted things she shouldnt want, things she was afraid to want.As she looked at him she forgot what theyd been talking about.All she could think about was how much she wanted a man like Lucas in her life.No, that wasnt true.She wanted Lucas himself in her life.Not just during this time of uncertainty but always.Of course that was impossible.Hed let her know in every way that he didnt want any kind of lasting relationship.And why would he want a woman carrying another mans child?A woman who was in some kind of trouble?Still, that didnt stop her from wanting him now.Tomorrow she might wake up with all her memories intact and shed be on her way back to her former life.But she had tonight.Was it so wrong for her to want to be held, to want to feel loved?Kiss me, Lucas, she said.Wrap me up in your arms and kiss me.His eyes widened and then narrowed.Thats probably not a good idea.She might have thought he just didnt want to if it wasnt for the pulsing knot in his jaw, the burn in his eyes and the tension in his body.He wanted her.She felt it radiating from him, saw it spark in the depth of his eyes.Shed heard it in his husky voice.I dont care.She reached out and placed her hand on his broad, firm chest.I know the score, Lucas.Ill probably be out of your life within a matter of days, but that doesnt stop me from wanting to kiss you tonight, right now.The words were barely out of her mouth as his lips touched hers.Feather soft, they plied hers with heat.But a soft, gentle kiss wasnt what she wanted.She wanted more.She wanted hard and hot and breathless.She wanted overwhelming and mindless.She leaned into him, opening her mouth to him, and he responded, swirling his tongue with hers as he pulled her into his arms.Even with the bulk of her belly, she fit neatly in his arms, as if she belonged, as if shed never been in another mans arms.She knew he was aroused.She could tell by his accelerated breathing, by the way his arms tightened around her.His mouth left hers and he trailed kisses down the length of her neck as she ran her hands across his back.She could feel the ridges of his scars and she wanted to kiss them, to somehow caress them away.Even though she desperately wanted him to make love to her, she knew that wasnt an option.Although she realized sex was usually okay for pregnant women, shed also heard that in the later stages of pregnancy having sex might induce labor.She didnt want to take that chance, no matter how slim it might be.But she wanted to give him pleasure.She began to pull up his shirt from the waist, wanting it off, needing to feel his bare skin beneath her fingers.He pulled away from her, and his chest heaved with his rapid breathing.What are you doing, Jane?His low, hoarse voice shot a thrill through her.I want to love you, Lucas.I want to run my hands across your bare skin.Let me.She touched his shirt.Take it off and let me love you.He seemed to freeze, his only movement the rise and fall of his chest as he held her gaze.For a single agonizing moment she thought he was going to spring from the bed and run from the room, from her.But instead he sat up and pulled his shirt over his head and tossed it to the floor.When he lay back down she placed her face against his chest, loving the warmth of his skin, the rapid beat of his heart beneath her ear.She ran her hands down the length of his chest and he moaned in response.Her mouth followed her hands, nipping and kissing the heated skin as his hands tangled in her hair.She loved the taste of him, the scent of clean male that clung to him, and when she reached the waist of his jeans she knew she wanted all of him.Giving pleasure was as exciting, as stimulating as getting it, Jane thought, especially when you were giving it to somebody you cared about.It didnt take long before Lucas was clad only in his briefs and her caresses and kisses grew more fevered.There was no other thought in her mind but him.At the moment the past and the future didnt matter.It was just the two of them in the intimacy of the moment.It was she who pulled at his briefs, and when he kicked them off, she wrapped her fingers around his hard length as his mouth found hers in a kiss that seared her to her toes.She stroked him as he gasped in pleasure against her mouth.She knew that Lucas was a man shed never forget, that he had etched her heart with an indelible mark that time and circumstance would never erase.And she wanted to be somebody he would never forget.She felt the rise of his release in his pulsing hardness and moved her hand faster, wanting to take him over the edge, to give him a night with her to remember.And when he reached the peak, he cried out her name.The only regret she had was that it wasnt really her name, that she might never hear her real name from his lips.Afterward he got out of bed without a word and left the room.Instantly, worry rippled through her.Had she offended him with her aggressiveness?Was he angry about what had just happened?She crept from her bed and went across the hall to the bathroom, heard the sound of running water and realized there must be another bathroom in his master bedroom.She returned to her bed and lay in the dark, worried about the consequences of what had just happened.Did he think she was terrible?That she was nothing more than a tramp who would fall in bed with anyone?Moments later he returned to her room, slid back into bed and pulled her into his arms.It was only then she breathed a sigh of relief.You realize that was incredibly stupid of us, he finally said.It didnt feel stupid, she countered.It felt wonderful.She raised her head from his chest to look up at him.Oh, Lucas, you dont have to worry about me expecting more from you than you can give.Everything that has happened to me feels like an out of body experience, but I know what just happened between us has nothing to do with real life.She sighed and dropped her head to his chest once again, where she could hear the solid beat of his heart.I dont know anything about my past and I certainly cant guess what my future might hold.I just wanted to be with you tonighta single night in the limbo that has become my life.He leaned up slightly and turned out the bedside lamp, then tightened his arms around her.Maybe well know more when we confront Charles Blankenship in the morning.For now, get some sleep.She closed her eyes, and for the first time since all this began, she wasnt afraid.She felt protected and warm with Lucass arms around her and it took her only minutes to drift off to sleep.The dream began almost immediately.She was in a church and there were flowers everywhere, filling the interior with sweet fragrance.There was joy in the air and the people in the pews all wore smiles.Three men stood at the altar, all of them clad in black tuxedos with crisp white shirts and turquoise bowties.It was a wedding.The groom stood with his back to her and as she gazed at him, her heart filled with happiness.As the traditional wedding march began she started down the aisle, her long, white, silk dress swishing around her legs.Her heart thudded and she wanted to run to him, to start their life together right now.Lucas, her heart sang, as she stopped herself from running to his side.Finally she reached where he stood and he turned to look at her, a smile on his handsome face.She froze.Not Lucas.The man who reached for her hand, the groom, was a man she couldnt remember ever seeing before.She woke with a gasp, her heart thundering a frantic beat.She opened her eyes to the darkness of the bedroom, aware of Lucass slow, even breathing as he slept beside her.A dream, she told herself.It was nothing more than a crazy dream.And yet even as she said those words to herself, she knew the truth.It hadnt been a dream.It had been a memory.Pregnesia Chapter NineAnything about the house look familiar?Lucas asked as he pulled into Charles Blankenships driveway the next morning.He looked over at Jane, who frowned thoughtfully as she looked at the two story beige house in front of them.It was just after ten on another gray, cold day.Breakfast had been awkward.He hadnt been able to get the night before out of his mind.No, Jane replied.It doesnt look familiar at all.I dont think Ive ever been here before.Her hands were clasped tightly in her lap and he could feel her tension.Hed tried to talk her into not coming with him, but shed been adamant.Its my life, Lucas, shed exclaimed stubbornly, and if seeing this man in person makes me remember everything, then its worth any risk.The problem was Lucas didnt know exactly what risk this might entail.What if Charles Blankenship was some kind of crazy maniac?They were in his car.Lucas hadnt wanted anyone to get a look at the rental car.He figured Charles had already seen his vehicle, so it made sense to drive it here.Once again he turned to look at Jane.When I get out of the car I want you to scoot across and get behind the wheel, he said.If anything goes wrong, if I get hurt, then I want you to get the hell out of here.Drive back to the safe house and call Micah or Troy.Her eyes widened and she reached out and grabbed his hand in hers.She squeezed tightly as she held his gaze.Surely you arent expecting anything like that?I dont know what to expect, he replied.He pulled his hand from hers.We dont know what these people are capable of, but I need to know that youd do exactly what I told you.If anything goes wrong you drive away and dont look back.Promise me, Jane.He could tell it was a promise she didnt want to make, but as she placed her hands on her stomach and rubbed, she nodded.He knew she would do it for her baby, if not for herself.I promise, she replied softly.Lucas opened the car door, and the cold wind slapped his face as he got out of the car.His coat was open, allowing him fast access to his gun if he needed it.He walked to the front door, then turned to make sure Jane had done as hed asked.She was in the driver seat, her wide eyes watching him closely.At least if anything bad happened shed be able to pull out of the driveway and get the hell out of Dodge.He turned back around and knocked on the door.This might be a foolish move, but they were stymied, and for the first time since this had all begun he felt like he was playing offense instead of defense.He knocked once again and the man himself opened the door.Clad in a pair of dress slacks and a long sleeved white shirt, Charles Blankenship couldnt quite hide the look of surprise that flashed across his blunt features before he schooled them into the curious interest of a stranger.May I help you?he asked.Yeah, Id like to know why yesterday evening you chased me through the streets of Kansas City, Lucas said.He didnt intend to waste time playing games with this man.Charless gaze shot over Lucass shoulder to the car, and again a flash of surprise lit his eyes, quickly masked as he looked back at Lucas.I dont know what youre talking about, he bluffed.Oh, I think you do, Lucas replied.The two men stared at each other for a tense space of time; then Charles sighed and ran a hand through his salt and pepper hair.You cut me off and it made me mad.Im not proud of my actions.Chalk it up to road rage, he said.Irritation burned in Lucass gut.That wasnt road rage, he said as he took a step closer to the door.You were following me.You know the woman in the car?Does she know me?he countered with a touch of belligerence.Lucas considered his options.He could tell this man the truth, that Jane didnt have her memories, and see what happened next, or he could bluff.He opted for something in between.She hit her head and shes having some memory issues.She doesnt specifically remember you, but she thinks you look familiar.Her memories are coming back every day, and if she remembers that you hurt her, Ill come back here and make you sorry.Got it?Theres no need to threaten me, Charles exclaimed.Lucas offered him a tight smile.Trust me, that wasnt a threat, that was a promise.Look, I dont know that woman, and I already told you I acted badly yesterday.You cut me off and I allowed my anger to take control.It was a simple case of road rage and nothing more.Im sorry.There, Ive apologized.Now get off my porch before I call the police.If I see your car anywhere around me, Ill be the one calling the police, Lucas replied as he backed away from the door.He returned to the car, still watching the door, not willing to turn his back on the man.By the time he reached the car, Jane had scooted back into the passenger seat.He got in and backed the car out of the drive, a new sense of frustration tying a hard knot in the pit of his stomach.Im not sure exactly what I thought would happen, but this accomplished absolutely nothing, he said as he pulled away, his focus as always divided between the road ahead and the rearview mirror.Jane reached out and placed her hand on his forearm.Even through the bulk of his coat he could feel her heat, and his irritation grew.Im sorry, she said.Im sorry I didnt recognize him.You cant do what you cant do, he replied, grateful as she pulled her hand away.He was also grateful for her silence as they drove back to the safe house.He needed to think, not about what had just transpired with Charles Blankenship, but rather how much longer he could continue to do this, to be responsible for her, to be around her twenty four hours a day.The lovemaking of the night before had definitely messed with his mind.Waking up this morning with her spooned against him had been overwhelmingly nice.Her hair had been a sweet tickle beneath his nose, and the warmth of her body had pressed intimately against his own.For a few minutes hed simply remained there, imagining what it would be like to wake up with her every morning for the rest of his life, reluctant to leave her side.Things were spiraling out of his control.He was spiraling out of control.He was getting too close, wanting things he knew werent good for him, werent good for her.And he wasnt the only one.She was getting in too deep, as well.He felt it in her most simple touch; saw it in her eyes whenever she looked at him; felt it in his heart, in his soul as shed caressed him the night before.They couldnt continue this indefinitely.It might take weeks or months for her memory to completely return.There was no way he could do a couple more weeks, let alone a month or two with her.He had to figure out how much longer he was willing to give her and how he was going to tell her that sooner or later he was going to bail.Once they were back in the house she went to her bedroom to rest and Lucas paced the kitchen, too restless to sit.The fact that Charles Blankenship had lied to him wasnt surprising.What hed really hoped was that Jane would see the house or the man and all her memories would come tumbling back.Charles had lied when he said he didnt know her.Hed lied about everything.Why?What had happened to her?What had been so terrible that shed not only run away, but had also shoved the memories of her entire life into the darkest recesses of her mind?By the time she got up from her nap and joined him in the kitchen, hed fried burgers and had opened a can of baked beans for dinner.He added a bag of chips to the table and they sat down to eat.They talked about inconsequential things, the weather, an article in a magazine she was reading, how Kansas City was growing by leaps and bounds.They didnt talk about men in white vans or all seeing eye symbols or lost memories.Although the conversation remained pleasant, in the back of his mind Lucas was trying to figure out how to tell her that he was reaching the end of his rope, that it was time they considered going to the authorities for help.They cleared the table together and a knot of tension formed in his chest when she stood close enough that he could smell her.Memories of the night before stirred in his mind.Shed been soft and warm and giving.Shed been hot and sexy and amazing.While shed made love to him last night, it was easy to imagine a time when she would no longer be pregnant and could indulge herself in complete lovemaking.Youre very quiet this evening, she observed as he put the last plate into the dishwasher.I did most of the talking during dinner.I guess Im all talked out, he replied.He dried his hands on a hand towel and then turned to look at her.She must have seen something in his expression, for she leaned against the countertop and released a sigh.You arent just talked out, youre Janed out, she said softly.There was not only a whisper of pain in her eyes, but one of fear, as well.Is this about what happened between us last night?Maybe a little, he said honestly.Dont get me wrong.It was greatyou were great, but it shouldnt have happened.Im glad it did.She lifted her chin as if in defiance.At least its one good memory Ill carry with me always.And so would he, he thought.It still shouldnt have happened.We dont know what your situation is in your real life, but you know mine.The longer were together, the more the lines blur between reality and fantasy.I cant be the man in your life, Jane.I dont want to see you get hurt.I realize that, she replied, but he thought he heard a touch of wistfulness in her voice.That cinched the deal as far as he was concerned.He steeled his heart for what he was about to do.Forty eight hours, Jane.If you dont get your memory back in forty eight hours, Im calling Wendall and were filing a report.Once again a dark fear edged into her eyes, but she nodded her head.All right.She turned and left the kitchen.Lucas remained standing at the sink, fighting the impulse to run after her and tell her hed changed his mind.Forty eight hours and then she would no longer be his responsibility.Forty eight hours and hed have his life back.What he didnt understand was why the thought didnt fill him with joy.TWENTY FOUR HOURS.The next evening those words whirled around and around in Janes head, making her alternately sick with fear and beyond sad.She knew once Lucas turned her over to the police shed probably never see him again, and that thought ached inside her with a force that was shocking.She was in love with him.It was as simple and as heartbreaking as that.And when the next twenty four hours passed she would have to tell him goodbye forever.As she glanced over at him, her heart swelled and she felt the unwelcome burn of unshed tears.She was on the sofa and he was on the chair nearby, his attention seemingly focused on a crime drama playing on television.Do not cry, she commanded herself firmly.The last thing she wanted to do was weep and make him feel bad.Hed already gone far above and beyond for her.She couldnt be hurt or angry with him for wanting to get back to his real life.She couldnt be upset that he didnt love her back enough to want to offer more than he already had.Im going to get something to snack on.You need anything?he asked when the show ended and he got out of his chair.Just you, a little voice whispered inside her head.No, Im fine.Im just going to catch a little of the news.Then Im going to bed.And tomorrow Ill be gone, she thought.As he disappeared into the kitchen she placed her hand on her tummy and wondered what would become of her.Would the police place her in a womens shelter until they could figure out where she belonged?What would happen to her if she never regained her memories?She focused on the television, her speculation about the future too painful to think about.More wintry weather ahead, a pert blond newscaster said with a smile.The smile fell and she offered the camera a concerned expression.A drive by shooting ends in a young mans death.And police are asking for your help.Have you seen this woman?Janes breath caught in her throat as a picture of her filled the screen.Lucas, she managed to gasp.Details after the break, the blonde said, and a commercial came on.Lucas appeared in the doorway.What?What is it?She pointed to the television.It was me.There was a picture of me on the news.He looked stunned.What did they say?Details after the break, she replied.He sank down next to her on the sofa, his attention riveted to the screen.Janes heart thundered, hurting her chest with the intensity of the beat.The commercial seemed to last forever, and then the news returned.The top news story was of a drive by shooting that had left one teenage boy dead.Jane felt as if she were in agony as she waited for the story that would change everything for her.There were two more news stories before a picture of her filled the screen.And now this, the newscaster said.Concerned family members are looking for this woman.
