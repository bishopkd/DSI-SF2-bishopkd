Natalia Philips hardly noticed that her phone had slipped from her fingers and landed onto the floor underneath her desk.Her mouth slightly opened, she was close to drooling at the heavenly sight before her.Who is that beautiful man?She admired his low cut fade, took notice of his flawless caramel colored skin, and the way his beautiful set of perfectly shaped white teeth sparkled when he smiled.He was dressed immaculately in a black buttoned down shirt and a gray sports coat which did very little to hide his bulging biceps and pectorals.Her dark brown eyes traveled upward once more, connecting with his hazel ones.He flashed her a million dollar smile showing his left dimple.Hed caught her checking him out.She held his gaze until he turned to respond to Kevin Maxwell, a second year lawyer that was showing him around.She said in a very low tone meant for no ones ears, That man is going to be mine.Eh um.Jenifer, another paralegal at Lockhart Stratton and Associates and the closest person she had to a friend, wrenched her away from her lustful thoughts.Natalia slowly pulled her gaze away from the mystery man as he was leaving the room.I like that view even better.She gave her friend a devious smile.Who is he?Jenifer sat at her desk next to Natalias, looking through a stack of files.She recited from memory everything she knew.His name is Bryan Hunter.Recent graduate of Regent School of Law, top of his class, passed the bar the first time, never been married, no kids, and today is his first day.He was born and raised here in the Hampton Roads area.His dad, Robert Hunter is a retired Air Force chief and his mother, Bethel has always done a lot of volunteer work in the community.Shes real sanctified.How do you know all of this already?Natalia asked.Its my job to know.Did you investigate me before I came?Didnt need to, Jenifer shook her head, your reputation preceded you.What does that mean?Natalia frowned.It means we all knew you were born to a Black mother thats a college professor and a Latino father that has a very prestigious real estate company.Youre a spoiled brat with a borderline personality disorder, born with a silver spoon in your mouth and youll do whatever it takes in order to get what you want no matter who it hurts.And would you look at that?I was right.Natalia rolled her eyes.Whatever.Dont get your feelings all hurt.You shouldnt have asked.You know me.At forty two, I dont believe in sugar coating my words.Plus, I didnt say nothing that wasnt true.Jenifer looked at Natalia who was still looking down the hall towards Bryan.Look at you now.Youre probably already making plans to seduce that man, whom youve never even met, just because you think you can when youve got a perfectly fine husband thats home every night, and from what I can tell, would do anything for you.I never said I was going to have sex with the man.Natalia said under her breath but loud enough to be heard.Just enjoying the view.Alright, girl, Jenifer warned.Just be careful.You think that stuff is cute now, but you cant play these games too long.Youre going to either end up dead or alone.How long has she worked here?Bryan asked Kevin as they left the paralegal room.Kevin followed Bryans gaze.Oh, thats Natalia.Shes been with us for about a year now.You dont want to get caught up with that, trust me.Bryan smiled.I hear ya, man.But, shes kind of hard to miss.Believe me, I know, Kevin shook his head.But, shes got a reputation around here.When she sees something she wants, she doesnt stop until she gets it.And by the way she was drooling over you, Im pretty sure youre the something she wants this week.Come on, man.Look at her, Bryan replied.How much harm could she do, really?Im sure Ill be fine.If you say so.But dont be surprised if shes in there right now bribing the other paralegals so she can get assigned to you.She looks harmless, but shes the best manipulator Ive ever come across and Im a lawyer.Bryan had his share of women during college and law school.He liked a woman who knew what she wanted.He was definitely attracted to Natalia, but he was tired of life in the fast lane.Being raised in the church, he knew living that way would only lead to destruction.He had recently started back going to church at Set Free Christian Ministries, and had rededicated his life to Christ.His main goal was to get his career going, get closer to Christ, and settle down with a wife.Judging by the way Natalia was dressed and calling him with her eyes, she definitely was not the one.Come on, Kevin said to Bryan.It looks like the partners meeting is over, Ill take you in so they can walk you through everything else.2  Ashlee Allen paid the cab driver, jumped out, and ran at full speed into the Hillside Regional Convalescent Home.Her long thick hair was pulled back into a low ponytail.She was dressed in light blue scrubs.Her heart pounded.Sweat covered her entire body.She looked at her thin, outdated, slightly faded black watch.The time read 6:33.She was late for work again.Her supervisor Gail Johnson told her if she was late one more time, not to even bother clocking in because she would be out of a job.She went inside.She was going to clock in anyway.She hoped Gail wouldnt notice.Ashlee had been working as a nursing assistant for almost a year.Shortly after she received her GED, her mother Patricia Allen told her about the CNA classes offered at the hospital where she worked.Ashlee wasnt at all enthusiastic about the idea of being a nursing assistant.She had dreamed of becoming an artist.During her junior year in high school, she received several scholarship offers and had plans to attend the California Institute of the Arts in Santa Clarita, California.That dream was short lived.Her parents didnt find out she was pregnant until she was seven months along.Her mother told her as soon as her baby was born, she had six months to get out.That was Pat for you.She always told her girls she was done raising kids, and if any of them got pregnant, they couldnt stay in her house.At least she had given her a chance to complete her CNA classes and land a job before she completely kicked her out.Her dad, Henry Allen, didnt completely agree with her leaving so soon.He really didnt like the idea of her living in the projects in Newport News, especially when he lived in Williamsburg and couldnt get to her every day.But, he didnt stand a chance with Pat.Growing up in the Allen household was hard for Ashlee.Her parents werent exactly a part of the upper class.But they never struggled financially and had everything they needed.Her dad worked in construction and her mom was a medical transcriptionist.Ashlee had a bit of an inferiority complex.She felt as if she couldnt do anything right as far as her mother was concerned and her father was such a yes man he never stood up for her.He always went along with whatever their mother said.Ashlee was a good student.She was usually on the honor roll with the exception of an occasional C here or there, and she excelled in art.But it was never good enough.She was often compared to her older sister Tracy who always made straight As.Her mother didnt try to hide the fact that she was more partial to Tracy.Then there was Aja, her sister that was four years younger.Ashlee was frequently blamed for things Aja did.Ashlee spent much of her life trying to do things to please her mother, but always seemed to come up short.She often felt like a screw up.So when Jamal came along telling her how pretty she looked, it didnt take too much more for her to fall in love and do anything hed wanted.With the exception of her sister Tracy, who really did have a heart of gold, Ashlee felt no one else really loved her.Here she was, nineteen years old, with a two year old son and eight months pregnant.She had recently moved out of the projects into a one bedroom duplex in a much nicer neighborhood.She really couldnt afford it based on her regular salary.Whenever she could, she took extra shifts to make ends meet.Her twenty two year old boyfriend, father of her son and unborn child, Jamal Richards never made any attempt to get a job.He barely even slept there anymore.She figured he probably had another girlfriend, but she was tired of arguing and worrying so she decided to let him stay there until she could figure out other babysitting arrangements.Then, she planned to put him and his stuff out on the curb.At this point in her life, the only thing she wanted was to make a better life for herself and her children.She needed to get to a place where she could forgive herself for altering her lifes course and find a way to love herself again.Ashlee was awake and dressed before five oclock.She had waited around for Jamal to come home from the club that had become his second home.He promised to be home in time to stay with Jordan while she went to work, but once again, he never showed.She called everyone she could think of that he may have been with.It was 5:45.Her shift started at 6:00.She was sure she had missed her regular bus.She paced nervously on her front porch with her cordless house phone in her hand, not sure what she should do.Hey there, Amber.You okay?Ashlees neighbor greeted her from her front door.She was forever getting Ashlees name wrong.The truth is Ashlee didnt like talking with her because she was always inviting her to church and telling her she didnt need to be shackin up.Hi, Ms.Esther, Ashlee said.Whats troubling you?Ashlee dropped her head and sighed, Im about to lose my job because once again Jamal isnt here to watch Jordan.Wheres Jordan?Ms.Esther asked.Ashlee looked towards the house.In his crib still sleeping.Go on to work, honey.Let me go lock up my house.Ill come and sit with him until Jerome gets here.Ashlee knew she meant Jamal, but at this point she didnt care.Im not sure when hes coming or if hes even going to come.Well, the older lady said with a smile, I guess Ill watch him until its time for him to start kindergarten.Ashlee thanked her by giving her a hug.Since getting there anytime soon on a bus was out of the question, she was forced to use money she really didnt have to call a cab in hopes of getting there at least within the six oclock hour.She went to clock in, but saw shed been clocked in thirty minutes prior.Ashlee slipped passed Gails office, speed walked down the hall into the area where the schedule was located.She read the sheet to see where the graveyard shift workers had left off and headed to check on her first patient.Ashlee!Girl, am I happy to see you.Where have you been?Monica, Ashlees friend she met when she first started working there, greeted her without slowing down.Ashlee kept up with her pace as they talked.Did Gail say anything about me coming in so late?She asked.Girl, no.Monica waved her hand towards her.I clocked you in and told her you were in the bathroom with a stomach ache.We had two people quit this morning, so shes been too frantic to double check.They didnt even bother to come in, called the night nurse and told her to tell Gail they wouldnt be coming back.You know who it was, those two idiots who are always messing up everything together.Oh, you mean Mia and Tiffany?I guess.I try not to get to know people.Come on, lets go.We have a lot of ground to cover.3  Natalia sat at her computer with her elbow propped up on her desk.Her chin rested inside her palm.She glanced through the glass window and gave a loud sigh that caught Jenifers attention.Whats going on?Jenifer asked.Nothing much.I am a little confused, though.She let out an exasperated breath, then turned to Jenifer.Do you think Bryans gay?Jenifer looked from Natalia to Bryan and back again.Ohhhh, I get it.You havent been able to get him to pay you any attention so he must be gay, right?No, Im pretty sure hes not gay.Maybe he has a girlfriend.Its been four months and he doesnt even seem remotely interested.Ive never met a man I couldnt get within the first five minutes.Natalia turned her chair to face the full length mirror she had installed in the office.She stood, not caring who was watching, and examined herself in the mirror.She was confident her flat tummy tucked stomach, saline implanted breasts, and perfectly round derriere, which she credited to countless hours per week spent at the gym, could attract even the most loyal man whether he was in a committed relationship or not.Thats how shed caught her husband Terrance.She studied her fair colored skin and flawless facial features.At twenty six years old, there were no signs of wrinkles, so there was no need for Botox.Everyone in the office was accustomed to Natalias routine need to check herself out.No one thought it odd that she caressed her body and face in the mirror for no particular reason.Natalia, why is this even an issue?
