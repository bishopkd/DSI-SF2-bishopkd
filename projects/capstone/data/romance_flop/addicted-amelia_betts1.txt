Loneliness real drag your soul through the mud, with your heart trailing behind like a tin can tied to a pickup truck, capital L lonelinessis waking up the morning after the best sex of your life and realizing that the man responsible for that incredible, mind blowing sex is no longer in your line of sight. Or anywhere in the near vicinity, for that matter.And you suddenly remember why youve avoided any kind of relationship for the past three yearsbecause of the hurt, the physical pain that comes from the void left behind when the guy leaves.You remember why you would have been better off with plan A, which was to stay far, far away from the male species for the rest of eternity; to keep your distance and enjoy the thrill of the secret crush; to stock your fridge with all your favorite foods and find creative ways of devouring them, one by one, until its time to restock again.But the sad fact of it is, you went with plan B.  And now your heart is the tin can on the back of the truck, and that truck is speeding along a desolate dirt road with mile markers bearing snarky reminders of all the wrong turns youve made.Mile One: Aah, one night stands.Cant live with em, cant live without em, eh?Mile Two: Well, I guess you did live without them until now Mile Three: I mean, did you really think a guy who looked like him was coming back for seconds?Mile Four: But then again, youve never had much willpower, have you, Mischa?Mile Five: I guess when someone is so far out of your league, its in your best interest to jump on it Mile Six: On the other hand, rejection is a bitch.And so on and so forth.For miles and miles.And still somehow youre expected to get out of bed and move on with your day, even though your soul and your heart are being dragged, at breakneck speed, by this unstoppable force that feels like it will go on forever.Some of us just werent cut out for random flings.In fact, I knew by now that I wasnt cut out for any of it.I was fragile, like a baby who hasnt stayed long enough in the womb.My heart was prone to breaking at the drop of a hat, and Id already learned about the crushing regret that came along with putting myself out there, the advanced level mess with the bull and you get the horns kind of loneliness that spoiled my days for an entire year after my freshman year boyfriend dumped me and never looked back.But it was that exact feeling, the loneliness with a capital L, that I invited in, practically begging for it to walk through my door, the moment I met him.One Last Tuesday in May: Oceanside Rec Center Meeting Topic of discussion: Living in the Past Calories imbibed: 2,500 (ish) Hi, my name is Jennifer.Hi, Jennifer, a chorus of grave sounding voices, including mine, responded.Todays topic feels pretty relevant to me.Ive been thinking about the past quite a bit lately.Specifically, Ive been going over and over in my head all the things my mom and I went through when my dad moved out of our house.I was in kindergarten Jennifers swampy, Gulf Coast accent helped give her story a little Southern flair, but beyond that, it was just like mine, and the girls next to me, and roughly 90 percent of the women I had ever heard speak in these meetings.We all had absentee father syndrome, it seemed, or absentee mother, in the rarer cases.And most of us had the overcompensating single parent who showed their love by stuffing us full of junk.We were the Overeaters of the worldours the personal tragedies spelled with a little t, not a big one.We werent the twelve steppers who had ruined other peoples lives, or stolen money from family members, or driven expensive cars off of docks.We were the silent, sweet sufferers with well meaning dimples in our chubby cheeks, allowing each other little glimpses into our otherwise clandestine, often nocturnal, habits of food stuffing, stashing, and hoarding.Except I had never even allowed anyone else that glimpse.Despite coming to Overeaters Anonymous religiously since I was fifteen, I had never once raised my hand to share.Mostly it was shyness that held me back.I had always been a wallflower at heart, and even in this most comfortable of environments, I was only interested in hearing other peoples tales of woe, not exposing my own, which centered around a diplomat father whose job had taken me and my mother to various exotic locales like Belgium and Kenya and Singapore before he had dropped us like a bad habit, jetting off to the Philippines to start a new family while she and I had retreated to her hometown of Eagle Grove, Iowa, when I was only eight years old.But today felt different.I was about to graduate from college and I had no place to live, no job prospects, and no safety net.I had eaten two trays of frozen mac and cheese and a bag of barbecue flavored Lays (in addition to an unknown quantity of cheese puffs) and was in dire need of intervention.But what would I say?My housing and employment problems didnt seem like the most relevant subject matter here, and if I was going to talk aloud about my food addiction for the first time in my life, wouldnt I need to go back to the absolute beginning?Start with the very first binge?Or the time I got caught shoplifting Doritos because Id run out of allowance money and eaten everything in the house?Should I describe my one very unsuccessful (read: traumatizing) attempt at purging?Or maybe just the bizarre fact that this was my first share in spite of coming to these things for seven years?Okay, who else?I heard Sherrill the moderators singsong cadence interrupt a brief silence and froze in my seat.Hi, my name is Lynette, a voice that was not mine said, after a hand that was not mine was picked.Hi, Lynette, I managed to say along with everyone else, kicking myself for wimping out.To her credit, Lynette had a lot to get off her chest that night.As did six other women who readily raised their hands after she had had her turn.To no ones surprisenot the least my ownI never ended up sharing.But the thought stayed with me and nagged at me for the next few days as I packed up my apartment and ate the entire contents of my fridge and pantry in an attempt to forget about my impending homelessness.Somewhere between the binging, scouring the classified ads for minimum wage jobs, and creating a resume that somehow screamed both under  and overqualified at the same time, I got the idea to seek out a new meeting, one that would be filled with unfamiliar faces, and try again.On the OA website, I found a listing for a Friday night group at a massive Baptist church fifteen minutes from campus and decided to force myself to go.Unfortunately, there were several fast food options along the way and I was moved to stop at two of themBurger King for dinner, Wendys for dessert.Eating junk on the way to OA was the height of blasphemy, but I figured it was all in the name of getting me there.Hot Friday night plans, indeed.By the time I drove into the church parking lot, I was ten minutes late and definitely stressed out.A thin layer of sweat had broken out underneath my white V neck T shirt, threatening to push my casual look into not so appropriate territory.I power walked to the church in search of the meeting spot, located in one of its smaller chapels.Most of the time, I preferred to be late, since meetings usually began with boring administrative announcements that I tuned out anyway, but I didnt want to draw attention to myself with a brand new group.Luckily, this one seemed to be just getting started as I rolled in and settled into an empty pew in the back, trying not to double take as an incredibly attractive, out of place as all hell, twentysomething man in tight black jeans and a light blue denim button down took the stage.I had never seen such a specimen at OA before, and because I was so shocked by his presence, I looked around at the other attendees to gauge if I was the only one having this reactionwhich is when I realized I was surrounded by men and only men.Men who, in a strange twist, were all relatively attractive.Not your mothers Overeaters Anonymous, I thought.Hi, my name is Liam, he said as he sat down on the lone chair onstage.Oh God, he has an Australian accent.Hi, Liam, the group responded.Hi, Liam, I followed suit a half second later, the singular female voice among the crowd.So, tonight was supposed to be my big three month chip.But I fucked it up.I had to tell Ben just now that I didnt earn it this time around.Sadly.I couldnt believe what I was hearing.What was this mans trigger food?Carrot sticks?The truth is, I had sex with an employee earlier today.At the restaurant I own, in my office.She gave me a blow job.And what does this have to do with your eating problems, sir?I glanced furtively around to see if anyone else looked as confused as I was, but all eyes were on the speaker.I felt so ashamed after.Id really been trying to stay a hundred percent soberno touching myself, nothing, he continued.And thats when it hit me.I scanned the room yet again and noticed the knowing nods, the pain in these attractive or, bottom line, average looking mens eyesI was definitely in the wrong place.I was surrounded by sex addicts.In a panic, I sank down in the pew, double checking my phone for the meeting details I thought I had gotten right.I spiraled immediately, his gravelly hot voice went on.I was contacting escorts on Craigslist.I drove to this womans house and sat outside in my car, beating off in hopes that I would skip it with her.Which I didnt I went in right after I came.And there she was, your basic call girl, hanging out in her lingerie, the smell of vodka coming off her skin from ten feet away.Again, knowing nods all around.I found myself doing the same, afraid that the others would sniff me out as an intruder, here to listen to their salacious stories for my own amusement.But then I remembered my general invisibility to the male species, my inherent wallflowernessin this instance, it was like a superpower.And then the most fuck all thing happened.I realized Id left my wallet back at the restaurant.I couldnt pay her up front, and she obviously wasnt going to take my word for it.I told her Id go and come backnow that Id seen her, I knew Id obsess over the sex until it was done.But the drive back had all this traffic, so I ended up stuck on the highway, just crying my eyes out like a little girl, thinking about tonight and how I had fucked it all up.Then I beat off again, in my car, probably in full view of a taxi driver in the lane next to me.He paused to look around the room, making eye contact with someone in the front pew.Whatever I was going to say tonight no longer has meaning.I can either start all over again or not.Im glad Im here.Im always glad about that.But I wish I was celebrating something.Thats it.He stood up abruptly, clearing his throat and glancing at the moderator, Ben, who took the stage as Liam hopped down and slid into the front pew.An older man in reading glasses patted Liams shoulder.For the remainder of the hour, I kept having to make sure that my jaw wasnt visibly agape as sex addict after sex addict spoke of their overwhelming lust and carnal desires that knew no end.It was such a different manifestation of neuroses than mine.Instead of stuffing their faces full of calories, these guys were out there burning them!Mind you, they were placing themselves in dangerous situations with fellow nymphos, sex workers, strippersyou name itbut they were involved in something extremely, wildly different than anything I knew.I amused myself with the idea of standing upthe female intruder making herself knownand telling them about the time that Terry McInerney, my freshman year sailing instructor, had pressed his penis against my stomach for three minutes in a bar.It was after fall finals freshman year, during my most skinny ever!!!phase as I had coined it in my journal, when unbeknownst to me I had contracted a tapeworm in Costa Rica on a humanitarian trip Id taken just before school had started.For the first and only time in my life, I had felt what it was to be one of those girls who were universally desirednot just a pretty face on a fluffy (as my mother liked to call it) frame, but a hot girl with actual power over the opposite sex.The phase had lasted long enough for me to start dating Bradley Griffin, the cutest guy in my dorm; stop going to OA; lose my virginity; fall in love; have said tapeworm diagnosed and treated; and get my heart broken by Bradley Griffin, still the cutest guy in the dorm, by the time Id gained back thirty of the forty pounds that Id lost.It was when I was still in the throes of that skinny phase, though, that Terry McInerney the sailing instructor had unnecessarily crushed his body up against mine at the local pub for the entirety of our brief conversation.Toward the end, Id felt him against my torso, a hot, hard bulge pressing into my stomach.The sensation had sent tingles through every part of my body, and all I could focus on was the tantalizing part in his lips as he had waited for me to say something else, the heaving of our chests as they had collided and fell away from each other with each anticipatory breath.In a way, it was the most subversive sex act Id ever taken part in.Sure felt steamy to me!I imagined myself saying to the group of sex addicts in my midst, then explaining about the box of Dunkin Donuts I had eaten later that night, washed down with a carton of chocolate milk.Did I mention Im at the wrong meeting, guys?Obviously standing up and talking was not a viable option, so I slumped down in the pew and waited patiently for the hour to pass.At the end of it, I skipped the serenity prayer, eschewing the handholding and inevitable reveal of myself as an interloper in lieu of a quick getaway.I made a pit stop at the bathroom in the churchs main building, shaking my head at my clueless reflection and wondering where the hell the OA meeting had actually been.After a good two minutes of self reflective hand washing in which I questioned for the millionth time that week my overall preparedness for adulthood, I moseyed out to the parking lot, trying to act as if nothing had happened.The biggest thing on my mind now was getting to the nearest 7 Eleven for a pint of rum raisin.Would my resolve have been the same had I attended the right meeting and finally spoken as I had planned?Would I be giving in to my usual cravings, or would I be stronger from the outpouring of communal support after I finally told my story?I would never know but the thought of going back to my apartment alone, only to drag myself through the sea of half packed boxes and contemplate my aimlessness sans ice cream, recalling all the stories Id just heard about the kind of hot, dangerous sex Id probably never know in my lifetime, was too desolate to bear.Alas, I didnt make it to 7 Eleven that night.In fact, I didnt make it out of the parking lot before the strangest, most unlikely, and luckiest thing that had ever happened to me unfolded before my disbelieving eyes.Hey there.I was headed toward my car in the churchs vast parking lot when my ears perked up at the sound of his Australian accent.I knew without a doubt it was the dangerously hot sex addict before Id even raised my head and taken him in, seeing him up close for the first time.He had green eyes, lit up by the too bright LED parking lot lights looming over us.His hair was sandy blond and messy in an on purpose kind of way, his features all perfectly proportioned and symmetrical on his heart shaped face.He had the look of a golden boy gone bad, like a professional soccer player with a secret drug problem or the high school prom king whod ended up in a minimum security prison for embezzlement.He was thin but built, like a track star, and holding a grimy hubcap in his left hand.I think this might be yours, he said, nodding toward my derelict Honda Accord, lovingly nicknamed the Sloppy Jalopy by my best friend Gracie.Oh my.How did that happen?I reached out sheepishly for the car part that had been expelled without my knowledge.Probably one of those damn speed bumps.Ill just snap it back on, no worries.He made his way around the car and crouched down by the rear right tire like a regular pit crew member.Simple car maintenance had never looked so good.Wow, thank you, I said.My car already suffers from low self esteem.I dont think she could handle a missing hubcap.I heard him laugh from behind the car and silently congratulated myself for having the wherewithal to crack a joke.Havent seen you at the meeting before, he said, popping back up.In fact, Im not sure Ive ever laid eyes on such a convincing transvestite.He wiped his hands on his jeans as he approached me.That was a joke.Because you were at a mens only meeting, not that I think you look like a man.Quite the opposite.Names Liam.Utterly confused by the level of hotness colliding with me, I didnt notice right away when he reached out his hand.Oh, are you not okay with touching people?he asked.No.I shook my head slowly, like someone just regaining consciousness.Im sorry.Im Mischa.I held out my hand and Liam shook it, a grin overtaking his face that was both incredibly charming and devilish.Mischa.I like that name.How long you been in the program?Me?Uhh pfft, on and off since I was fifteen, I guess.Wow!His eyes opened wider.Thats quite a thing to acknowledge at fifteen.Good on you.He thought I was a fellow sex addict, clearly.I toyed with the idea of letting him believe it, toothat I was a reckless nympho, drifting about this crazy world in search of my next fuck, purposely attending this meeting to take advantage of the mens compromised states.But I had never been a good liar.I was at the wrong meeting, actually.I was supposed to be at OA.OA?Overeaters Anonymous.For people who binge eat and such.I sounded nervous and winded, like I was in a rush to get somewhere, as I looked into green eyes that seemed to know their own power.Sex isnt a problem for me.Like at all.Its mostly just ice cream, pizza, Ruffles, Cheetos, the usual suspects Well, I wouldnt know it by looking at you.You look great.He winked again, and suddenly I figured out how this all made sense: This guy was not chatting me up because he and I were a likely match or because he really thought I looked great, but because he was in the middle of a sex binge, his mind a hazy blank in search of the next fix.I could have been anyone.My heart sank a little, as if I had already hung my hopes on this Liam person as a romantic prospect and those hopes had been dashed within a minute of speaking to him.It was my impossible fragility rearing its ugly head once again.I tried to wish it away, thinking, Would it be such a bad thing to have no strings attached sex with a guy who could pass for a Greek god?All right, well, its time for me to go and try not to buy ice cream, I said, flashing a polite smile as I pulled my car keys from my purse.Thank you again, for the hubcap.You really restored my faith in humanity.Liam winked at me, then glided in even closer and placed his hand on the hood of my car.It took everything in me not to gasp.Would it be wrong if I reached out and touched his arm?Just for a moment?Listen, I dont want to be a bad influence, but Youre not, I said, hardly able to concentrate in this strangers proximity but acutely aware of his gaze that was now, without question, directed down my shirt.I have the most fantastic gelato at my restaurant.Caramel dark chocolate.Served with homemade whipped cream and an almond wafer.My eyes closed at this description of the best sounding dessert Id ever heard of.I felt like I was in one of those ironic commercials where an unbelievably hot guy makes all your mundane dreams come true without an ounce of judgment.Had Isabella sent me a strippergram as an early graduation present?It seemed like a plausible explanation, but when I opened my eyes, they registered his face again and I remembered that Liam was a sex addict whom I had accidentally stumbled upon through nobodys fault but my own.And he was very real, and still standing within inches of me, his hand propped on my car as he slowly leaned into me, then backed away again.He smelled faintly of cigarettes and cologne and dangernot a combination I would have dreamed up before this but actually quite divine.I hadnt been this close to a guy in ages, or felt my body straining to take over for my head.Every physical part of me wanted to press up against him, like I had with the sailing instructor in the crowded bar, but my mind was contradicting, urging me to run and hide.Wow, gelato sounds amazing.Ill have to take a rain check, though.I flashed what I hoped was my most flirtatious smile and pointed an index finger into the air to signify the mental note I was making.Meanwhile, my heart was palpitating.Lucky thing I had a rib cage to conceal it.Well, then.Liam gave himself a final push off the hood of my car and drifted back, waving at me with cramped fingers.Mischa, isnt it?Yes!Liam.I pointed to him, overly enthusiastic.See you next time!But he had already turned away, making it crystal clear that the likelihood of a next time was on par with alien abduction.* * * The first person I thought of on the car ride home was my feisty eighty five year old friend Isabella.She would have killed me if she had been there.Her motto, oft repeated, was as follows: Every man who comes into your life is an opportunity for adventure.Nothing more, nothing less.She was of the mind set that marrying was for money (she hadnt married until her forties and, true to form, had picked a much older man with even older money), and everything else was pure pleasure principle.Of course, she had looked like a supermodel in her day and had run in circles with rich playboys whose lives closely resembled James Bond movies, so the philosophy felt a little less relevant to my particular case study.Still, I felt bad that I was a letdown to her; she was always begging for salacious tales about fraternity boys and surfers, incapable of grasping how low I was on the men equal adventure scale.This would have been the story to tell her, I thought as I drove home, unable to shake the feeling that I had lost out on something big.The questions running through my head were torture.When was a guy like Liam ever going to talk to someone like me again?Why would I pass up the chance to have a story about hot sex with an Australian restaurateur?I understood why he made me nervous, but why couldnt I embrace it, just for one night?Did I think he was going to lure me back to his restaurant only so he could kill me, chop me into little pieces, and serve me to unknowing diners as part of a delicious bouillabaisse?Doubtful.The feeling of failure was almost too much to handle, but the thought of calling Gracie, whose approach to dating didnt veer far from Isabellas, was not so comforting either.My only choice was to go back home and wallow, which I did.Lying on the AeroBed Id borrowed from Gracie after selling my mattress on Craigslist, I closed my eyes and imagined Liam with his hand on the hood of my car, leaning into me then pushing off, back and forth, back and forth, like the ocean at low tide.Then I imagined him naked, and my hand found its way down my body, slipping underneath the waistband of my boxer shorts.As I touched myself, I thought of Liam doing the same somewhere across town, still looking down my shirt in his mind, remembering the way my hair smelled just as I remembered the allure of his scent, his body heat, that gravelly Australian accent.Two Sugar.The bane and joy of my existence, the stuff of my dreams and nightmares.It was my first word, according to my mother: Sugar, sugar, sugar!I would command, my spoon dripping with pureed peas held spitefully in the air.I never specified when asking for it like other kids; I didnt say, May I have some candy?or When do I get ice cream?I knew sugar was in a variety of products and was careful not to limit my requests in case someone had, say, nothing but cough drops in their purse (still sugar!).Eventually the obsession broadened to all types of food, and the salty sweet cycle happily replaced my obsession with sweets.But still, in my deepest, darkest moments, it was sugar that offered the most comfort.So naturally it was a large bowl of Fruity Pebbles that managed to lure me out of bed after six hours of nightmares involving Liam the sex addict.In most of the dreams, he was laughing and taunting me as I ran away from him in various localeshis bedroom, my bedroom, a taxicab, the Baptist church parking lot.They were the kind of nightmares I used to have in high school, when I couldnt stop thinking about a particular football player who would never have looked at me twice or the menacingly attractive Goth boy who lived in my apartment complex.The difference here, of course, was Liam had looked twice.For some inexplicable reason, he had tried to seduce me with sweet, sweet, sugary gelato, and I hadnt allowed it.The whole thing made me want to self flagellate.But I also knew that to focus on last nights interaction would be a terrible mistake, given the current crisis that was my life, so I washed off the pink tinted milk residue that had dribbled down my chin during my breakfast in bed, made a quick to do list, and got dressed in a hurry, determined to mark off the first task (Pick up cap and gown @ Plex).As long as I wasnt naked at graduation or freshly knocked up by a stranger whod offered me gelato in a parking lot, things couldnt be so bad, right?* * * The tables set up for cap and gown distribution were lined against a wall of floor to ceiling windows in a vast, otherwise empty conference room at the Reid University Student Complex, aka the Plex.There were only three other students there when Gracie and I arrived, which added to the absurdist Waiting for Godot feeling of the cavernous room.The dazed, middle aged woman manning the JN table didnt even ask for ID when I gave my name, leading me to the conclusion that I probably could have just skipped the four years of tuition and endless studying and claimed somebody elses cap and gown for the same result: a diploma that I may or may not frame and mount on a wall, depending on how my future shakes out.This is where I leave you, boo, said Gracie in her scratchy, sleep deprived voice as we left the room with our shrink wrapped packages.Where are you going?I thought you were gonna come over and watch me pack, I whined.As thrilling as that sounds, I gotta go turn in my last paper, she said.The day before graduation?Seriously?I lagged behind a little as Gracie hurried toward the lobby.Double extension, baby.You wanna know the title?Ill give you two guesses.Like me, Gracie was a nutrition major.We had met during orientation week and quickly discovered our near telepathic connection and our ability to share clothes, even though she was an inch taller and not a binge eater like myself.Between the two of us, she was the healthy eater, so she loathed my ability to stuff my face without adding more than five or ten pounds.On the flip side, I envied her self control and the fact that her thoughts werent constantly ruled by food.One thing we did have in common was our self deprecating humor, something all fluffy girls must learn at a young age or risk becoming socially irrelevant.I dont know, Food for Thought?I said.Are you kidding?I used that one freshman year.Twice.Youre never gonna guess.Its called Obesity Cynicism.Isnt that good?Its catchy, right?I think its gonna be a thing.Like Im coining it: Obesity Cynicism.Its good.I think its definitely a meme.She bounced down a set of stairs to the front entrance.Is that what a meme is?Anyway, I dont care.We need to go out and celebrate!Im thinking many drinks are in order.I rolled my eyes.Despite having zero tolerance for alcohol, Gracie liked to tie one on.Its not my fault Im Korean!she would argue, blaming her ethnic background for all instances of epic sloppiness.She playfully flicked me off, backing into one of the entrance doors, which thudded into someone or something.Oh no!Gracies eyes went wide as she scrambled outside, where a man was doubled over on the sidewalk, clutching his knee.Professor Maxwell!she cried out.Are you okay?I followed her outside as Julien Maxwell, the painfully debonair African American studies professor who had taught our Intro to African American Lit class this past semester, righted himself and greeted Gracie with a forgiving smile.Gracie!Fancy meeting you here.Im so sorry, she said, her look of concern morphing into a shameless grin.This, I knew, was Gracies ultimate fantasy.She had always been professor obsessed, and Julien Maxwell her last and ultimate professor crush.Droolian Poundwell she called him.I could see the appealhis big brown eyes and square jaw were of the statuesque variety, and at thirty five, he was the youngest professor wed hadbut I was always too reverent to see male professors as anything other than authority figures.And this one in particular was a tragic case: a widower of one year.You excited about graduation?he said.No way!Nobody wants to be birthed into the real world.Am I right, Mischa?Gracie turned to me, generously acknowledging my presence even though she probably wanted me to scram.I nodded and waved.Hey, Professor Maxwell.Mischa!I guess all of my seniors are here, then, he chuckled.Imagine that.The class we had taken, English 401, aka Intro to African American Lit, was a freshman staple for English majors, but Gracie and I had masterminded our course schedule four years ago, leaving a bunch of easy requirements for senior year and making us the oldest, most competent people in the room more often than not.So what are you all up to after this?Moving on to bigger and better things, I assume?Beaming, Gracie told him about the organic lobbying internship shed landed in Washington, D. C. , carefully leaving out the details of how she had gotten the job through her well connected parents, pulling strings all the way from Seoul.Congratulations!That sounds tremendous, he said, and patted her on the shoulder.I actually have no plans for the future, I answered when he pointed his gaze at me, pulling my to do list from my back pocket, as you can see from this number two action item on my list for the day.I held it up so Professor Maxwell could see.Find job slash place to live, he read out loud.Does that mean youre staying here for the summer?Im not sure.I grimaced.I applied to some grad schools.Nutrition programs.Including the one here, actually, but they waitlisted me.He shook his head.I dont believe it.You two were my best students, and not just because you had three years on everybody else, he said with a wink.Hey, listen, if youre not sure what your next step is, Im actually looking for an assistant for the summer.Youd be perfect.Uh My response was more of a grunt than anything else.Not believing what Id just heard, I closed my eyes to run it back in my head.Is he offering me a job?I dont know what to say.Gracie elbowed me.Say yes, she instructed.Its only a couple of months, he explained.Im doing an annotated version of Through the Ivory Gate, which youre familiar with from my class.All I need is someone to proofread, really, and keep me on track.Organize my research, that sort of thing.My head slowly went from shaking to nodding, disbelief to utter elation.I think that sounds great, if Im qualified.Dont be silly.Youre overqualified.Listen, the pay wont be great.Probably twelve an hour, if you can get by on it.Sounds good Then when can you start?The sooner the better, actually.Professor Maxwell glanced at his watch, as if he meant for me to follow him to his office right then and there.A couple of days?I just need to move apartments.Well, first I need to find a sublet I squinted, trying not to crack up at the sight of Gracie doing a victory dance behind Professor Maxwells back.His eyes lit up.Dont worry, I got you covered.Theres a guesthouse in my backyard.Totally renovated, just sitting there empty.Gracies jaw dropped mid victory dance.She raised her hands as if thanking the gods.Wow.This sounds perfect, Professor Maxwell.Thank you so much!You heard me say twelve an hour, right?He chuckled again, an easy laugh that made him seem the polar opposite of the grief stricken man who had lectured us on the plight of the black artist in America.And call me Julien, please.His smile revealed a straight set of teeth with a charming, tiny gap in between the front two.Okay!Gracie reemerged from behind his back.Now that this deal is brokered, I guess my work is done here.Professor Maxwellsorry, Julien, she said, extending a coquettish hand.Playing along, Julien kissed Gracies hand.I have to get going too, he said.Mischa?Give my office a call to work out details.Or drop by.Whatever works.Im there too much.He gave a quick wave and, with a barely detectable limp from the blow Gracie had dealt him, headed inside the Plex.I ship you guys, Gracie said, pointing in his direction, then back to me.If I cant have him, you can, right?I shook my head.Not my style, boo.But how amazing is that?I just got a job and a place to live!And you have my clumsy ass to thank for it, she said, holding up her hand for a high five.I know.Ignoring her hand, I drew Gracie in for a hug.What am I going to do without you?As soon as I had thrown my arms around her, however, she wrestled away from me like an ornery child.Ew, ew, ew!Its too hot for this sentimental crap.Save it for graduation.She waved me off and started down the asphalt path toward the Science Hall.When is that again?she called over her shoulder.Tomorrow, dummy.Oh yeah, well be the motherless children!Thats right, I said, remembering Gracies recent announcement that her parents had canceled their plane tickets.Their excuse (general workaholism) was hardly as genuine as my mothers: After a bout with pneumonia in the harshest Iowa winter in a decade, my hard working single mom didnt have any vacation days left.But I had assured her that having Gracie there was tantamount to having family with me; she was the closest thing to a sister Id ever had.If it werent for her, in fact, the only real friend Id have to show for myself after four years of college would be an octogenarian, and unlike Isabella, Gracie didnt have eighty odd years of life experience to hit me over the head with every time I did something stupid.As I made my way toward the parking lot, it dawned on me that I had forgotten to tell Gracie about Liam the sex addict.I must have subconsciously nixed it for fear of the terrible advice she would give, probably something along the lines of Do him!Do him now!Find that man and seduce him!As a collector of experiences, she believed in making bold decisions as opposed to holding back, which was my way.Our philosophies on boys and sex were as different as our study habits and just about everything else, and I could predict exactly what her response would be if she knew how much I had obsessed over him already: Actions speak louder than words, my friend, she would say.Stop thinking, start doing.* * * As far as the actual commencement ceremony was concerned, I hadnt been looking forward to it, and as expected it went by in a flash.I was actually glad my mother hadnt come, even though shed wanted to, because she would have realized how few friends Id made, and for some reason I preferred that she think of me as something other than a social underachiever.There were about five girls and two guys in the Nutrition program who I actually hung out with outside of class, but the lot of them were antisocial types who didnt do much beyond classwork.Also, my dependence on Gracie and our sibling like tendencies could have struck my conservative, Midwestern mother as something sapphic, which I really didnt want to have to deny or explain.Graduation day was also particularly stressful given it was the first of two moving days for me.I had yet to stow all my furniture and boxes in a musty little storage unit before moving into Juliens guesthouse the next day, so I was still dressed in my drab graduation gown when I rented a U Haul that afternoon, with the bittersweet melody of Pomp and Circumstance still stuck in my head.I had talked Gracie into helping me move the big stuff in exchange for a steak dinner, but somehow we had lost each other in the diploma clutching throngs and I found myself waiting for her in the U Haul parking lot for over an hour, getting intermittent texts that said things like traffic=me and directions fail/there in soon.Lucky for my inner demons, the U Haul office had an extensive vending machine selection, and in the course of an hour, I had sampled not one but two bags of chips, a wrinkly yellow packet of peanut M&MS, and a roll of Life Savers that may or may not have been there since 1995.I was actually standing against my car, graduation gown open to expose my less than formal T shirt and shorts underneath, and clinging to all the empty wrappers as I foraged through my last bag of chips for edible crumbs, when a U Haul pickup truck pulled into the lot and slowed down as it passed me.I squinted to get a better view of the driver, but the sun was in my face and I couldnt quite make him out.I went back to foraging, eventually tipping the bag over my mouth in a shameless display.Hey there again, I heard a voice say as the door to the pickup slammed shut.Long time no see.I whipped my head in the direction of the Australian accent, in utter shock and disbelief.It was himLiam.Oh, hi!I called out faux casually as he made his way toward me, his shoulders moving in unison with his hips in a James Dean swagger.I had never seen someone so happily aware of their own sexiness.It almost put me at ease.Mischa, right?Yes!How the hell had he remembered my name?If I were a cartoon, my eyes would have been bugging out of their sockets and my eyebrows hovering somewhere above my head.Whatcha got there?Ruffles?He pointed to the bag I had forgotten I was clutching.I glanced down, my eyebrows knitted as if the chips had just materialized in my hand miraculously.Oh.Yeah.Ive been here a really long time.I was starving.Straightening my posture self consciously, I shoved the bag, along with my other empty wrappers, into the back pockets of my shorts.Hey, you dont need an excuse to eat Ruffles.I fucking love those things.Liam leaned beside me against my car.You know, I never heard of Overeaters Anonymous before the other night.It got me thinking, I probably need that too.I gave Liams lean body a quick once over, doing my best not to gawk.I doubt it, I said.No, I swear.All I do is eat.I own a restaurant for Gods sake.Anyway, I figure food is like the fundamental addiction.If you can get over that, you can get over anything, right?I shrugged.Ill let you know when I get over it.Liam nudged me, and we both smiled.For two people who hardly knew each other, wed fallen into casual conversation like it was no big thing.Had I already been demoted to the friend zone?So is this the big graduation party?he teased.Yeah, Im the first one here, I shot back, determined to make him laugh if nothing else.No, I have to move out of my apartment.What about you?I had to haul some artwork to my restaurant, he said.I nodded.Cool.This was followed by a long pause.There was nothing else I could come up with to say, other than So hows your sex addiction going?Which I figured was out of the question, even if posed ironically.Listen, Im sorry about the other night, he said.I was in a bad place.I shouldnt have hit on you like that.I shaded my eyes to see him better.No worries.I didnt take it seriously.So, no harm no foul.We shared another smile, and I allowed my heart to melt just a little I appreciate you not taking me up on it, for what its worth.Anyway He tossed his U Haul keys back and forth between his hands, his light green eyesalmost colorless in the sunlightmaking contact with mine.Are you waiting for someone, then?Yeah.My friends helping me move.Hopefully sometime in the next century.Oh yeah?How late is he?She, I responded almost giddily, flattered that he had assumed I had some strapping guy to help me instead of my diminutive girlfriend who was probably tipsy from the flask of spiked Arnold Palmer shed brought to graduation.I checked my phone.She was supposed to be here an hour ago.An hour and ten to be exact.Thats no good.Well, we were supposed to come here together but we lost each other in the crowd.Its fine.Shes helping me move on graduation day, which is a lot more than most people would do.So how was it?Did some famous person give you the best advice of your life?Shifting my weight against the car, I laughed and shook my head.Our speaker was the Pensacola Five weatherman.Hes alumni, I guess.I never went to my high school graduation, Liam said.Thats the only chance I got for the whole cap and gown scene.Its overrated.I almost didnt go.Stuff like that just isnt very important to me.No?Yeah, I never went to prom, for instance.I mean, not because I protested it or anything, just because I didnt have a date.Liam tilted his head and grinned.Aww, I would have taken you, he said.I squinted at him, incredulous.You dont even know me.So cynical!Just realistic.Liam lifted his hands as if to feel the heat surrounding us.Hey, listen, you cant suffer out here forever.Let me help you.Oh, gosh Thats I mean It took everything in me not to say, Yes!Yes!A thousand times yes!And why couldnt I?Here was this modelesque creature offering to help me, of all people, with whom he wasnt even having sex.I could just imagine walking behind him as he carried two boxes at once, watching his muscles strain as he lifted the heavy end of my ratty couch But the naysayer in me argued that someone like this would never make such an offer unless he was a demented serial killer with a long line of victims, all short, round versions of myself.Thats fine.I shook my head, embarrassed for some unknowable reason.Graciell be here any minute.Liam looked up and down the empty street beside the parking lot.Right.Well Im gonna turn in my keys.If shes not here by the time Im back, Ill force my services on you.How bout that?Before I could answer, he had walked away, and I found myself praying that Gracie would be a no show.I checked my phone and saw her latest text: Whatta nightmare.Tell u in 5 secs.Based on the entire string of messages she had sent me, however, which had referenced multiple amounts of minutes and/or seconds it would take for her to arrive, I had come to realize that the time frames she was giving were completely arbitrary.In fact, according to her texts, Gracie seemed to be operating entirely outside of the space time continuum as I knew it.So maybe she would be here in five seconds, or maybe five hours.Which brought me back to the concept of Liam helping me move.It felt like a daydream hallucination I had had after standing in the sun too longa Liam mirage, complete with witty repartee.What would I do if it actually happened?A loud car horn snapped me out of my thought spiral as Gracies neon green hatchback, arguably more of an eyesore than my Sloppy Jalopy, careened into the parking lot.I bumped someones rubber fenderno scratches!and they wanted to DUI me.Can you believe it?she screamed through the open window as she parked.I told them no problemo, called their bluff, she said as she got out of the car.For the record, there was one shot in that entire flask.I know that look on your face.Im not looking like anything.I glanced behind me, noting that Liam was still inside.I had the keys to the U Haul I had rented in my hands, and without speaking another word, I silently led Gracie across the parking lot.If I waited for Liam to come out, there would be an awkward pause as he realized my friend had shown up, and Id have to introduce them, and Gracie would make some Gracie comment, telling Liam to his face how smoking hot he was, and for some reason it all felt like too much.It reminded me of high school, when I would inexplicably duck out of conversations with cute boys because I couldnt handle how anxious they made me.When faced with fight or flight, I had always chosen flight, then kicked myself for it afterward Whats wrong?Are you really mad at me for being late?Gracie asked, climbing into the passenger seat as I turned the keys to the truck.I shook my head, still silent.This was officially the second time I had fled from Liam in less than twenty four hours, and the second time I was filled with regret about it.If I see him again, I thought, all bets are off.Three So what are you gonna do with yourself this summer?Other than try, try, try, very, very hard not to suck Julien Maxwells enormous cock?God bless her, Gracie had a one track mind.Youre a sick and twisted individual.And Ive told you a million timescrusty old professors are your deal, not mine.Gracie saluted me with her freshly refilled beer, which she proceeded to guzzle, and I was struck with a pang of bittersweet emotion.Im gonna miss you!I said.I wish you werent leaving so soon.I dont know how youre going to survive out here without me, she said, wiping the foam from her upper lip.Especially in the summer.This place is d e a d dead in the summertime.Well, aside from working for your dream man, I wanna keep working on my juice cleanse Theres too many juice cleanses.You should do something else.There are no perfect juice cleanses.Mine will be perfect, I said, smirking to indicate my level of seriousness.The Mischa Jones Patented Juice Cleanse had been my running joke of senior year, a pie in the sky scheme that would allow me to pay off my student loans and start a nutrition empire.I referred to it anytime someone talked about their real plans for the future.Meanwhile, I had been working on it, off and on, and wasnt fully convinced it was a bad idea.You know what?Ill drink to that.Youll drink to anything!I teased.Right you are.Gracie smiled as we clinked glasses, a couple of happy orphans enjoying graduation dinner sans the proud parents.As we talked about her plans for D. C. , my impending move into Juliens guesthouse the next day, and toasted all the big and little triumphs we could think of, my mind kept going back to Liam and his green eyes glinting in the sunlight in the U Haul parking lot.Part of me was itching to tell her about it, especially after two beers and the two more shots she practically forced down my throat.I wanted to slam a hand down on the table and announce that a drop dead gorgeous sex maniac had told me he would have taken me to prom, had offered to help me move out of the goodness of his heart, and had even remembered my name!These things didnt happen to the Mischa that Gracie knew and loved, and maybe it was time to change that.Yet each time the news started to bubble up, I stopped myself, knowing that the way I had responded to Liam was the Mischa we knew and loved, and that was no bueno.Even with a solid buzz, I couldnt handle hearing Gracies cry of disbelief at the anticlimax.* * * The next day, she and I shared a tearful, hungover goodbye at the Pensacola Airport before she flew off to D. C.  I hadnt anticipated how much it was going to hurt to see my friend go, and the only thing that kept me from falling into a total depression was the knowledge that I would be moving into Professor Maxwells guesthouse that afternoon and hopefully diving into work.In fact, from the airport, I drove directly to his address, parked on the street in front of his house, and approached his front door with my rolling suitcase in tow, buzzing with the anticipation that comes along with a new job, a new place, a new chapter.The house was a nice, traditional, two story wooden structure painted white, with black awning style shutters.It was almost colonial, like a turn of the century home in the Caribbean, but the tame green lawn with sprinklers on timers and gem toned zinnias and hydrangeas gave it away as suburban Florida.About a minute after I rang the doorbell, I decided to knock and was relieved to hear hasty footsteps coming down a set of stairs, eradicating my fear that he had forgotten about his new assistant cum houseguest.Hi.A small voice came from behind the door as it swung open to reveal not Julien Maxwell but a thirteen year old girl with braces and an oversized One Direction concert T shirt.Hello.I smiled, hiding my surprise.Julien was just old enough to be this girls father, so I had to assume that was the case.Im Mischa.Your dads assistant for the summer.I know, she said, looking me up and down, suspicious.He said hell be right back.You can come in.Whats your name?
