 West  When I had to say goodbye at the airport, I thought, This is the last time.The last time you get to kiss her.The last time you get to touch her.This is the last time youre ever going to see her face.And then, after I turned and left, That was it.Its over.I guess I went to the gate.I must have boarded a plane.Someone sat next to me, but I dont remember if it was a man or a woman, what they looked like.What I do remember is thinking everything would have to get easier from that point forward, because nothing could be harder than walking away from Caroline.It almost makes me laugh now, if you can call it laughter when it comes with the salt copper taste of blood at the top of your throat.If its still a smile when you have to swallow and swallow around it, unable to get rid of the bitter flavor of your mistakes.I went home to Silt thinking I was heading into some kind of Wild West showdown.Id call my dad out onto the public street at high noon and wed draw our pistols.Id fire straight and true and take him down, and thenwell, that was the part I had to avoid thinking about.That was the part where the screen starts to go dark, the edges drawing in around a black bordered circle that shrinks until its the size of a quarter, a nickel, a pinhole, nothing.Nothing.That was where I would live after I drove my dad out of my life once and for all.Inside that blackness where the pinhole used to be, where the light had disappeared from, Id pitch a tent, pull a blanket around me, and endure.I was the sheriff, right?And he was the bad guy.But after I took him down, my reward would be an eternity of nothing I wanted.Maybe a gold star to pin on my shirt.I was so sure I was the fucking sheriff, it almost makes me laugh, because what happened when I got home was that everything sucked in a completely different way from how I thought it would.I did the impossible and walked away from Caroline.After that, everything in my life that was hard got harder.When Wests ringtone starts playing in my darkened bedroom, it slips into my subconscious, and I have one of those last second before you wake up dreams thats pure sensationhis skin warm against me everywhere, his weight and smell, the muscles in his thighs against the backs of mine, his hand sliding down my stomach.All of that, slow and melting and West, until the song finally manages to pierce through the haze of my sleep and pinch me awake.I fight my way from under the sheet, turned on and pissed off because I know how this goes.The rock in my stomach, the day ahead during which Ill try and fail to shake that flood of sense memory.Im going to have to live through it, and then Im going to lose it, every good memory I have of West, again, when what I want is to drop back into that dream and live there instead.It sucks.It sucks, and Im so distracted by the suckage that Im picking up the phone and swiping at the screen with my thumb before I completely register whats going on.Wests ringtone.West is calling me.West is calling me at one a. m.  when I havent heard from him in two and a half months.If hes drunk dialing me, Im going to fly to Oregon and kick him in the nuts.Thats what Im thinking when I put the phone to my earbut its not how I feel.I wish it were.I wish I could say Hello?and hear West say Hey, and not feelI dont even know.Plugged in.Lit up.Juiced.I stand in my dark bedroom, aware in every centimeter of my skin that hes breathing on the other end of the phone, somewhere on the far side of the country.I have too many memories that start this way.Too many conversations where I told myself I wouldnt and then I did.I have this enormous burden of longing and pain, so heavy I can hear it in my voice when I snap, What do you want?My dads dead.My head clears in an instant, my attention sharpening to a point.He got shot, West says, and itsits a fucking mess, Caro.I know this isI shouldnt ask you.I cant ask you, but I just need to tell you because I cant fucking A crackling whooshing noise interrupts him, the kind of interference that fills your whole head with white sound.I just stand there, waiting for his voice to come back.Im pushing the phone so hard against my ear, my breath shallow and fast, aware with the kind of clarity Ive only found in moments of crisis that it doesnt even matter.Whatever he says next.It doesnt matter.The thing I never understood before West was that there are some people who, when it comes to them, reason and logic are never going to be in charge.He left me.He hurt me.But I stand there in the dark, holding the phone, and I know that in a few hours Ill be on a plane.I emerge from baggage claim in Eugene to the sight of West leaning against a dirty black truck.The first thing I think is, He cut his hair.The second thing I think is, Maybe he did it for her.If there is a her.Ive never been able to accept that there is, despite what West said.If she exists, shes not here.I am.West looks scary.Stubble covers his scalp, a dark shadow that throws the shapes of his face into relief: jawline, cheekbones, eye sockets, protruding brow, jutting chin, scowling mouth.The muscles in his crossed arms belong to a brawler.The West who left me in Des Moines more than four months ago was a guy, sometimes a boy, but this person whos waiting for me is a big, hard, mean looking man, and when he glances in my direction, I freeze.Mid step.Im wearing a white cardigan over a new green top that cost too much.Designer jeans.Impractical flats.Ridiculous clothes for August, because its always cold when youre flying.I wanted to look nice, but I got it wrong.I got everything wrong, and yet I think nothing Ive done is as wrong as whatever is wrong with him.He straightens and steps forward.I start moving again.I have to.Hey, I say when we meet a few feet from his truck.I try on a smile.You made it.He doesnt smile in return.So did you.Sorry you had to pick me up.Id texted right before I boarded the first flight to tell him I was coming.I didnt want to give him a chance to say no, so I just gave him my flight number and announced when Id get in.When the plane landed in Minneapolis, I had three texts and a voice mail from him, all of them variations on the theme of Turn your ass around and go home.I waited until I was boarding for Portland to text him again.Ill get a rental car.Walking off the jet bridge, I got his reply.Ill pick you up.Since that was the outcome Id been angling for, I said, Okay.It doesnt feel okay, though.Not even close.West wears cargo shorts and a red polo with a landscaping companys logo.Hes tana deep, even, golden brownand he smells strongly of something I dont recognize, fresh and resinous as the inside of our cedar closet after my dad sanded it down.Did you come from work?I ask.Yeah.I had to take off early.Sorry.You shouldve let me rent a car.West reaches out his hand.For an instant I think hes going to pull me into his body, and something like a collision happens inside my torsohalf of me slamming on the brakes, the other half flying forward to crash into my restraint.His fingers knock mine off the handle of my suitcase, and the next thing I know hes heading for the truck with it.I stand frozen, gawping at him.Get your act together, Caroline.You cant freak out every time he moves in your direction.He opens the passenger side door to stow my bag in the back of the cab.The truck is huge, the front right side violently crumpled.I hope he wasnt driving when that happened.By the time he emerges, Im comparing the musculature of his back to what his shoulders felt like under my hands the last time I saw him.The shape of his calves is the same.Hes West, and hes not West.He steps aside to let me in.I have to climb up to the seat.The sweltering cab smells of stale tobacco.I leave my sweater on.Even though Im too hot, I feel weird about any form of disrobing.I turn to grab the door handle and discover him still there, blocking me with his body.Thats when I figure it out.Its not his hair or his tan or his muscles that make him seem different: its his eyes.His expression is civil, but his eyes look like he wants to rip the world open and tear out its entrails.You need to eat?he asks.I dont think the simmering cynical hatred I hear in his voice is directed at me.Im pretty sure its directed at everything.But it sends a shiver of apprehension through me, because Ive never heard West sound like that before.No, Im good.I had dinner in Portland.Its almost three hours back to Silt.Im good, I repeat.Hes staring at me.I press my lips together to keep from apologizing.Sorry I came when you called me.Sorry I needed a ride from the airport.Sorry Im here, sorry you dont love me anymore, sorry your abusive asshole dad is dead.My own father didnt want me to come.At all.I had to quit my job a few weeks early and hand over almost everything Id earned as a dental receptionist this summer to pay for the plane ticketa move Dad called boneheaded.He doesnt trust West, and worse, he doesnt trust me when it comes to West.Which means we argue whenever the subject comes up.We fought like cats and dogs at breakfast this morning when Dad realized he wasnt going to be able to talk me out of this.To make matters worse, were close to being ready to file the petition in my civil suit against Nate, my ex boyfriend, for infringing my privacy and inflicting emotional distress.Dad wants me close at hand so we can read through the complaint together four thousand more times.Hes a judge by profession, a single parent of three daughters, and a fretful micromanager by nature.Which makes him, in this situation, kind of unbearable.I reminded him that poring endlessly over documents is what he paid our lawyer a zillion dollar retainer for, but Dad says this is a learning experience for me.If I want to be a lawyer myself, I ought to pay attention.I am paying attention.Im trying, at least.It got hard to pay attention right around the time West told me he was seeing someone else.When he called me last night, all other thoughts flew out of my head.The upcoming trial is important.Keeping my employment commitments is important.But West is more important.Im not going to abandon him when he needs me.You dont have to make a big fuss, I say.Im just here to help.Without another word, he slams the door and gets behind the wheel, and were on our way.I thought Eugene was a city, but after we leave the airport were instantly in the middle of nowhere, and thats where we stay.Its so green, it makes me thirsty.West turns right, heading toward the mountains.Its nearly seven, so we wont get to Silt until ten.I dont know where Im staying tonight.Im going to be sitting in this truck with West in the dark.I take off my sweater.West fiddles with the air conditioner, reaches across me to redirect a vent, and suddenly its blasting in my face.My sweat clammy skin goes cold, goose bumps and instantaneous hard nipples.He turns the fan down.Youre doing landscaping?I ask.Yeah.Do you like it?The look he gives me reminds me of my sister Janelles cat.Janelle used to squirt it between the eyes with a water gun to keep it from jumping on her countertops, and it would glare back at her with exactly that expression of incredulous disdain.Sorry, I say.Then I try to count up how many times Ive apologized since I walked out of the airport.Too many.Im letting him get to me when I promised myself on the plane I wouldnt let anything get to me.This is a convoluted situation.Someones dead, guns are involved, West was torn up enough to call memy job is to be unflappable.Im not going to get mad at him or act heartbroken.Im not going to moon around or cry or throw myself on him in a fit of lust.Ill just be here, on his side.Ill do that because I promised him I would when he left Iowa.I made him swear to call me, and I told him he could count on me to be his friend.He called.Here I am.After marinating in tobacco scented silence for a while, I find myself scanning West all over again, looking for similarities instead of differences.His ears are still too small.The scar hasnt vanished from his eyebrow, and the other one tilts up same as always.His mouth is the same.Always, for me, it was his mouth.The scent coming off him is like a hot day in the deep woodslike a fresh cut Christmas treebut its not quite either of those.On the seat between us, theres a pair of work gloves he must have tossed there.I want to pick them up, put them on, wiggle my fingers around.Instead, I look at his thigh.His faded shorts, speckled with minuscule pieces of clinging bark.His kneecap.I look at his arm from the curve of his shoulder to the banded edge of his sleeve where the polo shirt cuts across his biceps.He doesnt have a tan line.He must work with his shirt off, and the thought is more than I know what to do with.The last time I saw him, we were kissing at the airport, holding each other, saying goodbye.Even though I know everythings different now, it doesnt entirely feel different.Its cruel that its possible for him to have told me what he did and for me to still be sitting here, soaking him up.Im not over him.Ive tried to reason myself into it, but Im learning reason doesnt have anything to do with love, and West has always made me softer than I wanted to be, weaker than was good for me.Before we crashed and burned, though, I liked the person I was with him.He made me vulnerable, but he helped me be stronger, too.You want to fill me in on whats going on?I ask.A muscle ticks in his jaw.Ive been at work.I dont know whats going on.What was happening when you went to work?My dad was dead.Wheres Frankie?Last I heard, his sister and his mom were living with his dad at the trailer park where West grew up.West had dropped out of college and moved home to Oregon so he could protect them, but theres only so much you can do to save someone who doesnt want to be saved.His mom wouldnt leave his dad, and West wouldnt go near the trailer with his dad living in it.That meant West wasnt seeing Frankie as often as he would have liked.It bothered him not being able to get close enough to protect her the way he wanted to.Shes out at my grandmas, he says.I have to pick her up.Does she seem okay?I cant tell.She wasnt there, was she?When he got Mom says she was at a sleepover.His knuckles are white on the steering wheel.I watch the color drain from his skin all the way to the base of each finger as he squeezes tighter.You dont believe her?Im not sure.Then were quiet.Hes got a cut on his right hand in the space between his thumb and his index finger.The skin is half scabbed over, pink and puffy around the edges with curls of dry skin.I can see two places where its cracked.A burn.Or a bad scrape.Back in Putnam, Id have known where he got a cut like that.Id have nagged him to put a Band Aid on it or at least spread some lotion around so it would heal better.I probably would have made a disgusted face and told him to cover it up.I wouldnt have wanted to touch it, the way I do nowto reach out and stroke that newborn pink skin with my fingertip.Im dying to know how he would react.If hed jump or draw away.If hed pull over and turn off the truck and talk to me.Touch me back.What do you smell like?I ask.He lifts his shirt to his nose to sniff it.I glimpse his belt buckle, and the sight slices clean through the twine Id used to tie up a tightly packed bundle of conditioned sexual response.My cheeks warm.Pretty much everything below my waist ignites.I have to turn away.When I glance back his eyes are on me, which only makes it worse, because for a few heavy seconds counted off by my thumping heart, West doesnt look angry.He looks like he used to when I was prone in his bed and he was crawling up my body after stripping off my pantieslike he wants to own me, eat me, pin down my wrists, fill me up, ruin me for any other man.I let out a deep, shuddering breath.West concentrates his intensity on the road, frowning at it as though it might at any moment sprout a field of dangerous obstacles he has to navigate the truck around.The charged silence lengthens.He exhales, slow.Juniper.It takes me an eternity to remember Id asked him what he smells like.Is that a tree or a bush?Both, he says.Kind of.He taps the steering wheel with flattened fingers.His left knee jumps, jiggling up and down, and then he adds, Its a tree, but most of them are short like a bush.Oregons got too many of them.Theyre a pest now, crowding other stuff out.The landscaper I work for uses the lumber for decking and edging, but Ive seen it in cabinets and stuff, too.They make He stops short.When he glances at me, I catch a strained sort of helplessness in his expression, as though hes dismayed by how difficult it is to keep himself from talking about juniper trees.He swallows.I was chipping up scrap wood for mulch.Thats why I stink.I wait.His knee is still jittering.Come on, I think.Talk to me.They make gin from juniper berries, he says finally.Not the Western juniper we have here.The common juniper over in Europe.Is that sloe gin?No.Sloe gin is made with blackthorn berries and sugar.You start with gin and pour it over the other stuff and let it sit forever.For the first time since I landed, I feel like smiling.Whatevers wrong with him, however twisted and broken he is, this guy beside me is West.My West.When it comes to trivia like gin berries and juniper bushes, he cant help himself.West is a crow about useless information, zooming down to pluck shiny gum wrappers off the ground and carry them back to his nest.The girl who took my placedoes she listen when he does this?Does it make her like him more?If there even is a girl.That same intrusive thought Ive had a hundred times.A thousand.Whoever she is, shes not the one he called last night.I like the smell, I tell him.When Im here, I dont smell it.But when I fly from Putnam to Portland, its the first thing I notice getting off the plane.This time when he glances at me, his eyes dont give anything away.It was, I mean.When I used to do that.I bet when I get back to Iowa, Ill smell manure.Only if you time it right.The silence is more comfortable this time, for me at least.West remains edgy, tapping his fingers against the steering wheel.Is this your truck?I ask.Its Bos.He lets me use it.Bo is Wests moms ex.She and Frankie lived with Bo until she left him for Wests dad.Bo was at the trailer when Wests dad got shot.Sticky subject.Is he still in jail?No.They questioned him and let him go.Was he I take a deep breath.Did he really kill your dad?He wont say.He was there, shots were fired.There were two guns.I dont know which one discharged, or if it was both or what.For all I know, it couldve been suicide.The anger is back, flattening out his voice so he sounds almost bored.Not likely, though, if they took Bo in for questioning.What the fuck do you know about whats likely?Nothing.Sorry.Thats where the line is, then.Junipers are an acceptable topic of conversation.His dead father is pushing it.Speculation about whats going to happen next?Out of bounds.West leans forward and flips on the radio.The music is loud, hammering hair band rock.I turn it off.Whens the funeral?Whenever they get the body back from the coroner.Oh.Im not going.Okay.More silence.Dark green forest closes in on both sides of the road.Were climbing now, heading into the foothills.How long are you staying?West asks.As long as you need me to.He stares at me so long, I start to get nervous were going to drive off the road.What?Whens school start?The twenty eighth.Two weeks.Two and a half.Youre not gonna be here two and a half weeks.Whatever you need.West looks out the drivers side window.You shouldnt have come.Ive already thought the same thing, but it hurts to hear him say it.Its nice to see you, too, baby.I didnt invite you.How sweet of you to notice, I have lost a little weight.His eyes narrow.You look scrawny.Stung, I drop the act.Ill be sure to put on a few pounds for your visual enjoyment.If you want to say Fuck you, West, go ahead and say it.Fuck you, West.His jawline tightens.When he reaches for the radio, I knock his hand away.I dont know what Im supposed to do with you, he says.Youre supposed to let me help.I dont want you anywhere near this shit.Thats sweet, but too bad.That earns me a criminals glare.You dont belong in Silt.I guess Im about to find that out for myself.I guess you are.He reaches for the stereo again.This time, I let him turn it on.I think about how were driving toward the Pacific Ocean, which Ive never seen.I think about West and what I want from him.Why Im here.I dont have any answers.Im not kidding myself, though.Inside a makeup pouch at the bottom of my suitcase, theres a leather bracelet with his name on it.I shouldnt be here, but I am.Im not leaving until I know theres no chance Ill ever wear that bracelet again.The road drops away from the pavement on Wests side of the truck.The guardrail doesnt look like it would be much help if he yanked the wheel to the left and sent us sailing out over the edge.Not that hed do that.I dont think.We climb up and up through a corridor of trees, winding around broad curves to the sound of rushing water.The light fades.I cant get over the green.Its green in Iowa in August, too, but there the color hugs the ground in long rows and flat lawns.Here, its all trees.More trees than Ive ever seen in one place, crowding the road and pulling my gaze up to the sky.After a while, we descend, sweeping in slow, easy curves downhill as though were skiing on an extravagant scale.This heaved up world is our field of moguls, the tires rocking us back and forth like freshly waxed skis on perfect powder.Ive been to the mountains, skiing in Telluride and Aspen with my family, but Oregon is different.The roads so narrow, the forest so dense.It feels primeval, unfinished.We swoop and curve.The silence stretches out and grows stale.This drive is interminable.West reaches past my knees to open the glove box.Careful not to touch me, he extracts a pack of cigarettes.Youre smoking now?Hand me the lighter, would you?I can see itcheap bright pink plasticbut its too deep for him to reach.I leave it where it is.Smoking is disgusting.We hit a straight section.He leans over me as far as he has to in order to retrieve the lighter, which is far enough to press his shoulder into my knee.The lighter snicks and sparks when he sits up, the smell of the catching tobacco acrid, then sugary.The ripples from our brief moment of contact move through my body, lapping against my skin for a long time.West blows smoke in a stream out the window to dissipate in the dark.I feel like smoke, my edges dissolving with every mile that passes, every flick of his hand over the wand that makes the high beams come on, a flood of light, then another flick, dimming to yellow.The darkness concentrates his potency, makes him more solid and me less substantial, immaterial, unreal.When he leans forward to turn down the radioan obvious prelude to conversationI have to pull myself back from somewhere far away.Whats going on with Nate?he asks.Nothing.He stopped posting the pictures?As far as I can tell.They pop up sometimes, but thats going to happen.I dont think its him doing it anymore.Nate spent most of last school year posting and reposting our sex pictures online while I wasted dozens of hours contacting site owners to get them removed.It was the worlds least fun game of whack a mole.He finally stopped after I took the problem to the deans office.When the college began to investigate, I hoped he would end up expelled for violating the campus technology policy, but it didnt happen.Hed been too sneaky, and hes a convincing liar.How else would he have convinced me he was a nice person for all the time we were going out?The college let him off the hook with a suspension of his Internet privilegesa slap on the wristbut the disciplinary investigation must have shaken him up, because hes backed off the attack.You get a trial date yet?West asks.No, were not done working on the complaint.What about the Jane Doe thing?Filing as Jane Doe rather than Caroline Piasecki means my highly recognizable name wont come out in connection with the case, and the public records of the suit wont identify me.Which means, in turn, theres a chance that my entire economic and political future wont be tainted by what Nate did and what Im doing to get back at him.My dad knows someone who knows someone who says with the judge Im going to be assigned, it shouldnt be a problem.So when do they set your trial date?After we file the complaint, which is any day now, I say.Dad says it will probably be at least twelve months until the trial.Itll be nice to see that fucker raked over the coals for what he did.I guess so.You guess so?Its going to cost a fortune.How much?Maybe a hundred thousand dollars, according to the lawyer.Could be more.West whistles.And he says it could get ugly, like a rape case.Theyll attack my credibility.So Im trying to get ready for all that.Doesnt sound easy to get ready for.Douchebag lawyers grilling you about your sex life.Dont forget my mental stability.Your mental stabilitys just fine.I meant that theyll grill me about my mental stability.Theres a smile flirting with the corners of his mouth.Fucking great.Have em call me, Ill tell em what a basket case you were at the bakery last year.Thatd be great, thanks.My pleasure.I press my hands against my thighs so I wont press them into the ache in my chest.Its too easy.Talking to him.Remembering.If I close my eyes and pretend, its almost possible to forget all the bad stuff between us and drop into my memories of those nights at the bakery when I was falling in love with West.Maybe he feels it, too, because he leans forward to turn up the music.I look out at the dark green shapes of the trees, the blurred branches.The trial drops away as I let myself think about why Im here.What I want.My purpose.West.But after a while, even West slips away, and then its just dark.Cold air coming in from the drivers side of the truck snaps me awake.Were parked on the street in a neighborhood of nearly identical housesall of them small, crowded on tiny lots.West stands outside the open drivers side door.His face through the window is stark, shadowed.Is this where Frankie is?I ask.Yeah, my grandmas.He shifts so hes holding the top of the car door with both hands, leaning into it, studying me through the glass.Its as though hes using the door as a shield so he can look at me, really look at me, the way he hasnt yet.He rakes his eyes upward from my shoes.Right turn at my knees.Left turn at my thighs.Lingering over the parts that used to be his favorites.Its like in my dreamsmy mind too fuzzy and slow to defend me against the heat of Wests lava dipped icicle gaze.I just want to crawl across the front seat of the truck on all fours until I crash into his body and hes on me, over me, hot hands and wet mouths and every single thing Ive missed that I need.A few hours in the truck, and my lofty thoughts of friendship and loyalty are nothing but a sticky layer on top of weeks worth of longing.Wests expression has gone dark.Youre staying here tonight, he says.What, to sleep?Yeah.Where are you staying?Out at Bos.How far is that?Twenty miles.I want to stay wherever you are.He comes from behind the door and jacks his seat forward, pushing himself all the way through the space behind it so he can get hold of my bag.When he starts rolling it up the walk to the front door, I get the idea that this decision hes made isnt negotiable.I hurry after him.Whos inside?Based on the cars, Im guessing Grandma, Mom, Frankie, a couple of my aunts.I wasnt aware he had aunts.Or, until he mentioned her earlier, a living grandmother.Anything I should know about them?Except for my mom and Frankie, I havent seen them in six years.Seriously?He frowns.You think Im fucking around?I dont.My stomach hurts.Sorry.How shouldwho should I say I am?Tell them whatever you want.He rings the doorbell.I have time to take a breath and think, This is going to be weird, before the door is pulled open directly into the kitchen.The first thing I notice is that theres a woman sobbing at the table.Like, sobbing.Two other women and three kids are crowded into the room with her, but I dont pay much attention to them, because the second thing I notice is that the woman who opened the door has Wests eyes exactly.Nobody has eyes like Wests.Even West doesnt, since his eyes look one way one day and another way the next, depending on the light and his mood and all kinds of factors I cant pin down.Ive wondered what it says on his drivers license, because there is no word for the color his eyes are.Its trippy, seeing Wests eyes in the wrinkled face of a woman.Other than the eyes, the resemblance is scanty.She has to tip her head way back to talk to him, because this woman is short.Shes round in every directionboobs, hips, buttwith salt and pepper hair cut close to her head.Shes takes a drag off a cigarette held in her left hand, and I notice when she puts it to her lips that her fingers seem to take off in a new direction at each swollen knuckle joint.Will wonders never cease?she says.Far from a welcome.I kind of expect her to exhale right in Wests face and then slam the door, but she turns her head to the side instead and says, Michelle, look whos here.I know that Michelle is Wests mom.She looks up.Her eyes are like dark holes punched into dough.Whos that?Her voice is hoarse, terrible to hear.I want to cover my face with my hands.This is Caroline, West says.She blinks.Rubs at her eyes.Blinks again.Caroline who?Behind a closed door between the kitchen and the other room, a toilet flushes.West asks his grandma, Whats she on?Shes been like this all day.Fuck.He inhales deeply.Can we come in?Introduce us, his grandmother says.Caroline, this is my grandma, Joan.Grandma, Caroline.He points across the kitchen.Aunt Stephanie, Aunt Heather, and my cousins Tyler, Taylor, andI dont know that one.Hailey, the woman named Heather says.Hailey, West repeats.Good to meet you, Hailey.Im West.I shake Wests grandmothers hand and offer a weak, Hi.I brought her to stay with Frankie, West says.Im with Frankie, Joan replies.Youve got other stuff on your plate.I can take care of one kid.The bathroom door opens, and I recognize Wests sister at the same time her face lights up to see him.West!Relief washes through memore than Im prepared for.Ive never met Frankie in person, but when West and I were together, she and I started texting.I dont know if hes aware that we never stopped.Not that we swap the secrets of our hearts.Frankies ten.She sends me pictures of cute boys and really bad jokes.I send her links to stories I think shed like, or I just ask her how shes doing.Hows school?Hows life?I never ask her, Hows West?I guess I figured that was over the line, but standing here now, its utterly hilarious that I thought I had lines.I mean, Im in Silt, Oregon.Obviously I have no lines.Wests got his arms around Frankie, his face in her hair, his eyes closed, and I cant look away.He wants me to stay here, so Ill stay here.He wants me to watch over his sister, so Ill watch over her.Theres nothing I wouldnt do for West Leavitt.Frankie and I bunk down that night in the attic.Its one big low ceilinged room full of boxes and swollen garbage bags, a broken chair, the ironing board and mop bucket.Clashing squares carpet the floordeep brown shag next to a red Turkish print next to a pink nubbly one.Samples from a carpet store is my guess.Not of recent vintage.The attic makes my nose run.It started as soon as I lay down, and now my eyes are watering.I keep sneezing.Even if I werent wired, it would be a joke to think I could sleep.Frankies beside me, each of us with a sleeping bag on a pallet made of blankets and a thick egg crate mattress pad.Every time Im sure shes finally nodded off, she moves.Before he left, West took his sister out on the porch and talked to her for a while.Then he went into the living room with his mom and spoke to her in a low rumble while his grandma draped an afghan over Michelles shoulders.I stayed in the kitchen talking to Frankie while Wests aunts talked to each other and his cousins argued loudly about who got to sleep in which bed when they got back to Stephanies that night.After Michelle fell asleep, Joan drew a pocket door closed between the living room and the kitchen, and the whole crew of aunts and cousins cleared out.Frankie was only too happy for the opportunity to ask me a dozen more questions.What was my trip like?How many airplanes?Were they big or small?Where did I get my sweater?How much did my shoes cost?How long was I going to be staying, and why hadnt she known I was coming?I did my best to answer, but I was tense waiting for Wests reappearance.When he finally came back through the pocket door, he went straight to Frankie.When will you be back?she asked.Tomorrow after work.Carolines gonna keep an eye on you.Anything in particular Im supposed to do?I asked.Stay with her.Call me if anything gets strange.I wanted to say, Define strange, but he looked so tired, I decided to let it go.Things are already strange.I assume they can only get stranger.I sneeze loudly and then sniff, wishing Id packed tissues.Stupid allergies.Dust and mites, mold and danderall it means is that I never know when someplace is going to set me off.I keep Claritin in my purse, but all I found when I fished around was an empty plastic pill bubble, half squashed.Im going to have to go down the narrow wooden staircase that brought me up here and try to find Joan.Ask if shes got something I can take.I hope shes not asleep already.When I shift to my side, preparing to move, Frankie says, Caroline?I freeze.In front of me, there are bare two by fours with wiring stapled to them.A water stain, dark at the edges, bowed plywood in the middle.A small square window and the moon outside, nearly full.Behind me, theres a little girl whose father is dead.West wanted me here, with her.But what did he want me to say?Yeah?Do you think hell leave again?Who, West?Yeah.I turn toward her and prop myself up on one elbow.Her sleeping bag is close enough to mine that I can see it rise and fall with her breath.Hers is My Little Pony.Mines Spider Man.Her eyes are so big in the dim lighting.Shes got her mothers brown eyes and sharp chin, but the rest of her is Westcheekbones like wings, eyebrows that come to a peak, a wide mouth, and thick, dark hair.Shes beautiful and so young, her front teeth a little too big for her face.I dont know, I say honestly.But what do you think?I thinkI guess hell do whatever he decides is best.Shes quiet.Then, Did he ask you to come?No.Why did you, then?I thoughtI could help.She rises to her elbow, mirroring my position.What can you do?Not much, I admit.Keep you company, if you want me to.Can I tell you something?she asks.No.Dont tell me anything.I dont know what Im doing.But thats just cowardice.Ive learned to ignore it.Sure.Mom told them I wasnt there.But I was.I saw what happened.Her eyes gleam, wet.I saw.Do you want totalk about it?She shakes her head.Her tears brim over.I disentangle my arms from the sleeping bag and put them around her, pulling her close and rubbing her thin small shoulders.Shh, I say to this shaking girl.Shh, shh, itll be all right.I have no idea if it will.After a while, her breathing settles and slows.I can tell when she falls asleepshe gets heavier against me.Ive been holding back a sneeze for a while now, inhaling deeply and squeezing my eyes shut.As soon as I can, I ease out from beside her and slip down the stairs.Wests grandma sits with a mug at the table, knitting.A wall mounted TV flashes a muted newscast.A radio plays oldies, while a crackling noise pours out of what I think might be a police scanner.Bright pink letters across the front of her long white sleep shirt say San Francisco.Her arms are pale, the flesh loose and veined with red fireworks.She asleep?Yeah.Tough kid.I guess she is.She kind of has to be.You want some coffee?Joan asks.Is it decaf, or ?I dont drink decaf.No, Im good.I was just going to duck into the bathroom for a second.The toilet seat is freezing.Theres a hole in the plaster above the head end of the tub, positioned so I imagine someone creating it with the back of their skull.Tapping until they dented the sheetrock, pounding until the plaster crumbled.I sneeze three times on the toilet.You have a cold?she asks when I come out.Allergies.You need Sudafed or something?Any kind of antihistamine would be great.She gets up carefully, the movements of a woman whos no longer comfortable in her body.A minute later, shes back with a bottle of generic allergy medicine and a glass of water.Thanks.I take the pills, then sneeze again.She pours herself more coffee and sits.You and West are close, she says.My head is full of snot.Its too late for me to feel clever, too dark outside for bullshit.We were.He left Frankie with you.He doesnt want me here.She gives me a pitying look.Doesnt want to want you here, more like it.Were quiet.The kitchen fills with the crackling murmuring gibberish of the scanner and the love complaint of some long ago vocalist on the radio.He tell you how long its been since he let me get a look at his face?Joan asks.He said six years, but he didnt say why.His daddymy son.Last time he took up with Michelle before this, it ended bad, and West was in the middle of it.West come over here, told me I had to choose sides.Everybody had to choose.Either him and his mom and Frankie, or my Wyatt.Nobody was gonna be neutral anymore.She pulls the sugar bowl close and spoons more into her mug.I guess you chose your son.I thought West would come around.I smile at my fingernails.West doesnt really come around.Not for six years, he didnt.I wish Id taken her up on the coffee.Sleep is an impossibility here, and Im envious of her steaming mug.The idea of swallowing that bittersweet heat.My son was no good.She addresses this remark to her clinking coffee spoon, slowly revolving.I dont know why.It wasnt anything I did, I dont think.The other three came out okay.But Wyatt was always full of himself.A bully.She drinks deeply from her coffee, then frowns at it.Too much sugar now.I feel like Im supposed to say something, so I say, Im sorry.Michelles no better.You saw what shes like.Shell be sniveling for weeksmonths, maybeand never give a single thought to what it does to her daughter or what she leaves her son to deal with.Its eerie when Joan finally looks at me.Wests eyes.A strangers face.Familiar strength that I know how to count on.Did you come to take him back with you?she asks.I dont know.She drains the mug and stands to set it by the sink.Looks through the window at the moon.Take him out of here, she says quietly.Hes not going to get another chance.I spend the next morning washing dishes and shelling peas with Frankie at Joan Leavitts kitchen table.Afterward, Joan tries to teach us both how to knit.Frankie catches on faster than I do.I keep wrapping the yarn around the needle, which makes holes.Joan says Im good at making holes.For lunch, she warms up canned tomato soup and fixes grilled cheese sandwiches with Kraft singles and margarine.Theres a constant stream of traffic in and out of her kitchenfriends, neighbors, extended family, a woman with four children who I eventually figure out from the conversation is from Joans AA chapter.Joan is her sponsor.Im not introduced.The company ebbs and flows.Joan pops outside for a cigarette and pops back in, running water in the sink, talking on the phone, turning up the radio.Always, if her hands arent otherwise occupied, shes knitting.She has a red bag that snaps to the belt loop of her pants, and she carries the needles in her hands and knits without looking, twelve inch squares in brown and blue, green and red.Her living room is draped in her knittingtwo afghans on the couch, one on the La Z Boy, an overflowing basket of yarn in the corner.Theres a set of stitch pattern reference books tucked beneath the coffee table.I sit with one thigh touching the afghan wrapped around Wests mom and the other leg pressed up against Frankie, who seems to need that.All day long, she pushes herself against me.Shes an alarming blend of kid and woman.Knobby knees and boobs, careful eye makeup and huddled posture.I understand why West loves her.Frankie is everything soft in him, every impulse right at the surface.Loud and funny, hot tempered, quick to forgive.Your hairs so pretty, she tells me.Show me how you do your makeup.Teach me how you make your scarf look like that.She doesnt say anything more about what she witnessed.She doesnt cry.I wonder if I should tell someone that she saw the shooting, but who would I tell?Her mom knows the truth, whatever it is.Her grandmother, her aunts and uncleseither they know or they dont.I cant imagine breaking Frankies trust, turning over what she told me to somebody whose allegiances arent clear.The only person I can see myself telling is West, and West isnt here.In the afternoon, we hear that Bo has been taken in for questioning again.Wests mom bursts into tears.She cries about Wyatt being dead.She cries about Bo being in jail.I cant figure out which thing shes more upset about.Frankie stares at the TV, her eyes wide and wet.I put my arm around her, and we watch soap operas.West doesnt text.He doesnt call.He doesnt come, even though he said he would.That night, I comb through the online version of the Coos Bay paper on my phone after Frankies gone to sleep, trying to fill in the blanks.Shots reported at the trailer park.A gunshot wound to the chest.Ambulance to the hospital.Dead on arrival.The neighbors say an argument got out of hand.The paper says there were only two witnesses: Michelle and Bo.Bos been questioned, released, questioned again.I want to make a narrative out of these plain, blank facts.I want a story I can tell myself, but theres only Michelles tear streaked face.Frankie curled into a ball on the couch, her head on my lap as she watches TV.People coming in and out the door into the kitchen, talking to Joan, leaving food, running errands.I text West.What are you doing?When are you coming over here?Should I get a car?He ignores me.Even when we were dating, West never wanted me to know about Silt.Here I am, though, and before he forces me back out of his life, Im going to learn as much about this place and these people as I can.My second day in Silt is the same as the first, except I listen harder, pay closer attention, and send West four hundred texts.Hows it going?Whats up?Need anything?He doesnt respond, so I try random declarations.Watching Days of Our Lives w/ Frankie.Having split pea soup.SP soup looks like snot, but tastes good.Discuss.Then I give up and just start typing whatever comes to mind.When do you get off work?Am I going to see you tonight?Think Ill go out for a beer.Shoot pool in a short skirt.Check out the local nightlife.Do you like Raisinets or Sno Caps better?Milk Duds or Junior Mints?Ocean or mountains?I want to see you.Come for dinner.To my surprise, he does.His aunts and his grandma crowd around the table in the kitchen with his mom, and there are cousins big and small with paper plates, fruit salad with whipped cream and marshmallows, stringed chicken cooked all day in a Crock Pot.When he takes his plate to the couch, I follow.
