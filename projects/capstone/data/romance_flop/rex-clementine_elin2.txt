He had stopped kissing me and looked down at my fragile hands on his tattoos.What is your favorite?He asked me in a hoarse voice.I looked up at him and back at his tattoos.I traced my fingers around the snarls of colors.Vivid purples, dark stormy blues and neon greens filled the once pale chest.My brows knotted and then I stopped on the ship.That was my first tattoo.I just had it touched up which is why it is so colorful now.Why did you get it?I asked quietly.It was so elegant and detailed.From each small line in the mast to each sail made it look so lifelike.For my father.He was in the Navy.I smiled up and him and he leaned down slowly.Each tattoo has a meaning.He whispered against my lips before kissing me again.He pulled me up into his arms and we made our way to his bed once again.Everything was pent up within me.I couldnt wait for him to touch me.His touch was like drugs, making my body convulse against his.His body rocked against mine sending shivers up through my arms.My hair splayed out on the pillow as he kissed down my body.My underwear and bra fell onto the floor along with his pants.He felt my body relax under his as he slid into me.His breath was hot against my skin and I arched my back up against him.Our bodies twisted together, creating one.His hands were wrapped around me, holding me up against him as he rocked back and forth with precise motion.My mind let go, my body let go and I let go all at once.Succumbing to him.I scratched along his back and held him tightly.His lips never left mine unless I urged him to kiss my body.His skilled hands slid along my skin.My legs wrapped up around him.I couldnt hear anything but his breath against my lips.As he moved faster against me, my body reacted with his, matching its pace.We rocked faster, my body becoming delicate against his.Anything he touched sent a shock of pleasure coursing through me.I shook beneath him and him above me.We collapsed onto the bed, sweat on our backs and gasping for air.I closed my eyes and took his hand in mine, holding it tightly.Anya.He whispered into my ear.I pushed my body back against his and he wrapped his arms around me.Yes?I whispered.My eyes were closed.My body was still shaking, suddenly freezing.I reached for the covers and pulled them up around myself.Oh Anya.He let out a small laugh into my neck and I felt myself smiling too.It was amazing.He nuzzled into me and I felt myself slipping into sleep.Shauna was right, I better not fuck this up.I am loving it way too much.His arms were wrapped tightly around me and I felt safe.I felt safe and at home.Then the blackness of sleep overcame me.Brian was running away from me.His black hair was blowing in the cold air.Brian!I screamed.He turned back for a second and then he was gone.I was in jeans and a sweater in the forest.It was black with white trees surrounding me.Brian!I yelled again, my voice cracking.I took off in a direction and found a river.The forest was making eerie noises.No, no no.Brian.Come back.I took off in another direction, pushing the trees from my view.Suddenly a cop was in front of me.Im sorry Mrs.Holt.Your husband has been killed by a drunk driver.No.This cant be.He cant be killed.I broke down in front of the cop, tears spilling from my eyes.Im sorry Mrs.Holt.Your husband has been killed by a drunk driver.He repeated.I fucking know!Go away!I screamed and ran past him.There were two cars, our black car smashed in and a red car.You asshole!I screamed through the tears and ran towards him.The cop stopped me from doing anything I regretted and I melted into his arms.He cant die.He is all I have.You dont understand.My head hurt from the pain, my heart had been ripped apart.No.No.My body fell into a hole.I just fell for what seemed like forever.Falling through space and time.Anya.A voice called from the blackness.Anya, its okay.It sounded familiar.It is not okay!I screamed at the imaginary voice.I have lost everything.Everything!Something touched my shoulder and I turned but I was still falling through the hole.Everything.I repeated before closing my eyes.Anya, honey, wake up.I bolted up and looked around.I was in Rexs house.Tears had streamed down my face.I was breathing heavily and his hand was on my shoulder.Anya?Are you okay?It was just a dream.I felt like my chest was being crushed.I couldnt stay here.Not next to him.Yeah, I need a shower.I spoke quickly and got up from the bed.I heard him call something behind me but didnt stop.The tears had begun to fall once more and eventually I made it to the bathroom.I felt my stomach lurch as last nights dinner made its way into the toilet.Disgusting.I climbed into the tub, curled into a ball and turned the hot water on in the shower.Water streaked my skin as my body erupted into a crying fit.A knock at the door made me turn my head.Please go away.I called to him.I saw the door sag as he leaned against it.He opened the door but I pulled the shower curtain around the tub so he couldnt see me.Please go away.I repeated and I heard the door close.I hadnt had a dream about Brian in three years.Why now?Why when I finally found someone that made me happy?I sat under the water for as long as I could, thinking.My skin began to turn pruny so I climbed out.The mirror showed what I figured it would.My eyes had lines around them and spots underneath from crying.I took a deep breath and wrapped a towel around myself.I couldnt help but smile at the black towels lining the only bright room in the house.I opened the door hesitantly and looked around for Rex but couldn't see him.I took a few steps from the bathroom and hugged the towel closer.I hope he didnt leave because of me.I noticed a note on the kitchen table and picked it up.His writing was scrawled on it.Went to the store, be back in a bit.xo.I smiled a little and nodded.I threw on my clothes and ran out to the car to grab my other clothes.Once I changed I sat on the couch to wait for him but after 15 minutes or so I decided to look around his house.I hiked on my boots and pulled my peacoat on for it was getting cold outside.I went outside and looked at the garage, pushing the door open.Inside was an old car, I couldnt say what year but it was old.It looked like he had been doing some work on it.There were parts strewn across the garage.I noticed different things like spark plugs and tire gauges.I wasnt that good at cars, I couldnt even change a flat tire if you asked me to.I walked further back and noticed a picture of him and a girl with blond hair.They looked so happy together.There was another picture of them kissing.I smiled and wondered if she was the Australian girl.Was he working on this with her?I heard a loud clang outside and walked out to the door to see his car pulling into the driveway.I waved and he smiled back at me.He climbed out of the car in the same sort of outfit as the night before.Sorry about that..I said quietly, I felt so embarrassed.He just shook his head and smiled.He pulled me into his arms and kissed me, taking me off guard.Well hello there.I smiled and kissed him once more.He looked over at the car sitting in the garage.I figured I would look around.Are you working on that?He walked into the garage and ran his hand across the hood of the car.I was once upon a time.I lost track of time.I havent worked on her in oh what, years?I followed him inside and watched as he grabbed the pictures and pushed them into a drawer.You should work on it again.I would love to drive it.I crossed my arms across my chest and smiled at him.Im no good at cars but I love a man who knows cars.I giggled and he looked up at me.I could feel the tension that this car brought about with him.He must have worked on it with her.What kind of car is it?1972 Chevy Nova.I was restoring it for my dad.He walked back over to where I was and looked up at me.His eyes were a pale gray.No need to work on it now.He took me outside and pulled down the garage door, shutting the car out of his mind.What are you doing today?He asked as he walked over and hugged me.I was shocked for a bit before hugging him back.I have work at twelve.Today is orientation.Managers favorite day.I made a face and his face lit up.What?I questioned.Nothing.I have to go to the shop today.He smiled and I couldnt help but laugh.Dont laugh.He took my hand and we walked into his house.I know you have to go soon but I want you to come back tonight.I havent even been in my apartment in days!I laughed and he wrapped his arms around me before twirling me around.Okay, we can go to your place then?He raised an eyebrow and I put my hand on his shoulder.I suppose that would work.I really need to go to work though.He made a whining noise but then leaned forward.I could feel his breath on my lips as he hesitated before kissing me.I smiled against the kiss and looked up into his stormy eyes.Do you want to come to my place tonight then?I get out at ten?That sounds like a plan.This was beginning to be his catch phrase and it certainly was catchy.Ill see you tonight beautiful.He smirked.I smiled and grabbed my stuff before going out to my car.On the way to my apartment I still couldnt believe how long it seemed we had been together.We had only been together a few days but it felt like months.My emotions were finally calming down and I could feel myself relaxing around him.I didnt feel the need to make up excuses to leave.He always wanted me to come back.I made my way to my apartment and looked at the state of it.There were clothes thrown everywhere from when I had gotten ready to go to his place.There were dishes in the dishwasher and a makeup explosion in the bathroom.I quickly ran around and tidied the place up before making my way to the bedroom and grabbing some clothes for work.I slipped the black dress pants on and a white blouse.The apartment finally looked alright and I ran out to my car.The engine sputtered before finally turning over.Thats odd, its never had to worry about that before.I shrugged and pulled the car out of the parking space and drove to work.The traffic was plain today, the sun was bright in the sky.A smile poured across my lips.The leaves were beginning to change color.There were bright yellows and dull oranges splitting the bright blue sky up.Leaves had already begun to fall and littered the highway.The sun was high in the sky but a cloud covered most of it up.I pulled into work right as the sun decided to free itself from the nuisance cloud.Of course work was bustling with activity, when was it not?I made my way through the crowds to the back room where the managers offices were.Shaunas bright face looked at me with wide eyes.What?Im only like five minutes late.I said in a quiet voice.Yeah but orientation has started.I had to cover for you!She pushed me into the orientation room and before I could stop there were five people staring at me.I ran my hand through my hair and waved.Hello all.I am Assistant Manager Anya to do your orientation.I gave a half hearted smile and took my seat around the circular table.Attendance first?I questioned myself and looked at the sheet.Kain?I looked up as a short, stout boy with dark brown hair and hazel eyes raised his hand.Nice to meet you.Cody?Cody was a tall redhead with green eyes, lanky almost though for his body seemed to tall for his proportions.I gave him a quick smile and moved on.Krystie?A brunette raised her hand and I smiled at her.She was what we referred to as Barbie Girls.They only worked so get money for clubbing and makeup, or so we thought.Barbara?Looking up I met eyes with an older woman, probably in her 50s.She had graying hair and was a little heavy set.Nice to meet you.Last is Kevin.I looked around and a man held up his hand.He looked to be the same age as me with salt and pepper hair mixed in with his black hair.I nodded a smile at him and opened the large binder that contained all of the necessary papers.Shall we get started then?It had been eight months since I had started seeing Rex.More of my life was consumed by him but it was also a much happier time.He had visited me at work numerous times and I had been at his work so much that he had changed it around a bit.I also met his best friend Octavius.At first I kept calling him Oscar because that is what I thought Rex said, so they made fun of me.Hey, it happens right?Octavius was a broad man with many muscles.It was obvious he worked out every day.He had spindly brown hair that sat along his shoulders but he usually had it pulled back into a ponytail.He also had intricate tattoos like Rex, a majority of them were across his back though.There were a few other tattoo artists in Rexs tattoo parlor but they were in between areas so none of them were permanent.The parlor had been totally redone since I showed up, new couches, new paintings and even the check in desk had been totally redone.Other than Octavius he didnt seem to have many friends.I heard of one that Octavius was joking around about but nothing much.I had assumed it to be the girl from the pictures in the garage.Our lives pretty much continued like normal, we occupied his place more than we did mine.He had offered to buy me a car when mine broke down but I couldnt take that kind of affection.Eventually the engine went in my little Volvo and I had to cave and let him buy me a car.He said Do you want the Escalade or another car?Of course I wanted the Cadillac but I couldnt say that.He ended up buying himself a truck and letting me use the Escalade so in the end I got what I wanted.Work had been going well, everyone from orientation had been working out.Krystie had been a pain like we thought she would have been.She constantly would bug Shauna and I about the other workers in her area.We had placed her in deli for she had previous training.Eventually I had to move her into bakery so she would shut up.I was sitting in the managers office with my eyes closed.It was a large office with various computers and chairs spread around in an oval.My purse was sitting up on the counter, the computer open to my current call outs.I had been so exhausted from everything Rex wanted to do.He wanted to go see movies, bring me out on special dates, go to the theme park, go to the mall and every other cliche date you could think of.I felt a tap on my shoulder and straightened my posture.It was just Shauna.God you scared me.I whispered.She took the seat next to me smiling.Late night with Rex ey?She raised an eyebrow and I made a face at her.Rex and I were officially dating and Shauna never let me forget it.Anyway I am having a problem with Krystie again.Will you talk to her?I groaned a little and rubbed my temples.She was definitely what I did not want to deal with right now but I nodded and pushed myself up from my chair.What is she doing now?I turned around to see if Shauna was following me and she was right by my side.Well the usual.Complaining about everything and I have just about had it with her.She doesnt listen to me or do what I say.So big manager, talk to her?I rolled my eyes a bit as we walked.Shauna had been there longer than me but lately I could tolerate less than her.If there was a problem I took care of it right away.She was a calmer, more composed manager than myself.We walked over to the bakery and I let out a sigh.Dont just jump in there but..yeah.Shauna patted my shoulder and disappeared.Krystie was standing there, her hand on her hip.What now?Her voice held a hard tone to it.It stopped me in my tracks for a minute.Excuse me?Do you talk to all your managers like this?I finally had made my way over to her.She just brushed her hair from her face and back up into her hairnet.Krystie if you expect to work here you cant disrespect people like that.She held her hand up and I stopped.Sorry, just having a bad day okay?Her voice still had a razor blade edge to it.No.I pushed her hand down.You cant do that.Next time, youre done.You can leave.Nobody is keeping you here.That must have got her for she looked up at me in pure horror.Ever since she had started she had been a problem.Either she complained about the hair nets that were required to be worn in fresh areas.Then there were the gloves that didnt fit her perfect.She was just a ball of annoying everything.Now she had broken down, just for a minute, and looked like she would cry.Deal Krystie?She simply nodded and turned back to the cake she had been decorating.I began walking back towards the managers office when I heard my name on the walkie.Go for Assistant Manager Anya.Can you dial 180?I picked up the phone and punched in the numbers.All I got was a garbled response before I heard Shauna say that I needed to go to jewelry.Couldnt you have just said that into the walkie?I laughed and she hung up before I got a response.I made my way over to jewelery and there was Rex.It was like every time I saw him now my stomach had butterflies, my heart skipped a beat and an acoustic song filled my head.He had serenaded me numerous times since we had begun to date.Each time his voice got stronger yet more soothing.He had a voice of an angel, I swear.Hey you.I giggled as he walked over to me and kissed me.Since being with Rex the affection at work thing had subsided.He made me feel calm and so I just let it happen.His arm wrapped around me and laid in the small of my back.What are you doing?Well you are out in...He looked down at his watch.Ten minutes?So I figured I would pick you up.Oct wanted to go out for drinks tonight.Does that sound okay?Drinks with Octavius had become a natural thing.We would got out every now and then, usually he had a different girl every night.Yeah that is fine.Let me go grab my stuff okay?I took his hand and pulled him along with me.The way the store was set up, all of the fresh departments were on the left side and everything else was on the right.Home supplies, dishes, electronics, anything you can think of.In order to get to the managers offices you had to walk past all of the fresh areas.His hand stayed entwined with mine as we walked.So today we had this crazy lady getting a tattoo.She wanted it on her foot and I told her that is painful but she was like its fine.She couldnt even finish the tattoo and it was wicked small.He began laughing and I felt myself smile with him.If I felt that my job was crazy I would just listen to his horror stories and be glad I was in retail.And then this guy...He trailed off and came to a stop.We were standing outside of bakery.What babe?I questioned but he seemed to be in a daze.When I turned my head to look at what he was looking at it was Krystie!She waved her hand at him but he stayed still.I looked between the two of them, confused as ever.She must have been a past one night stand?Then Krystie pulled her hairnet off and had the nerve to come over to us.Rexy baby!I havent seen you in years!She wrapped her skinny arms around his neck and he hugged her tightly.Tighter than it should have been in my opinion.I took a couple steps back.Maybe they were just best friends and I had never met her before?Krystie.What are you doing here?He asked and she turned her head to look at me but kept her body against his when it hit me.The blond from the photographs in the garage!I didnt notice it before because she had turned brunette and her face had been turned in the picture.Oh shit.Was she trying to take what I worked so hard on?I couldnt confront her on property time so instead I turned on my heel and briskly walked away.Anya?I heard Rex call out but I just kept walking.I cant believe that she had been there the whole time and I didnt even recognize her!I turned around for a second to see Krysties arms around Rex again.He didnt seem to be too upset about it to me.I rushed into the managers office, thank god Shauna was there.I slammed the door shut and she bolted up, her eyes wide.Whats wrong?She ran over to me as I began to lose my composure.This cant be happening.Why does something always get ruined?I asked as I took a couple deep breaths.What Anya?She asked confused as I sunk into a chair.Krystie is Rexs ex.I spoke the words slowly and clearly.Shauna practically fell down, her seat caught her but barely.I never noticed it before.She just like attacked him.He didnt even look like he felt bad about it.Then my phone began to ring.I looked down at the number and it was Rex.Oh Anya.That bitch really?She smiled and I could tell she was holding in laughter.Shauna this is horrible!She then began to laugh and I felt myself smile.Sister, I think if he was with her he probably got sick of her just like we did.I let myself dwell on her statement for a minute.Makes sense.I smiled and looked over at her.You always make me feel better.She pulled me into a hug and for a second it felt alright.How would I know later I would be in his arms again?Can you sneak me out?I dont want him to see me and I bet he is still in bakery.She nodded and grabbed her coat, a smile still plastered to her face.We slowly made our way back out to the floor.I pulled my jacket around myself and threw my purse over my shoulder, keys in my hand and ready to hop into the car.I glanced over to bakery but didnt see the meddling pair anywhere.I still cant believe it.Shauna whispered and I pulled her to the right, noticing Rex standing where we were headed.Why her?I mean we thought she would be good when we hired her but then she was awful.Do you suppose she sucks in bed?A giggle escaped both our lips as we made another drastic turn.The isle was open so I could see if anyone was near.I noticed Krystie off to the right so Shauna and I practically ran past her.That was when I heard it.His beautiful voice calling me.Anya?Anya where are you going?I bit the inside of my lip.If I looked back I would stop.I glanced over at Shauna just as she mouthed go.Shauna had stopped.When I looked back I saw her talking to Rex.His face was plain and solemn looking.I knew this was my chance to run away.I booked it out through the front doors and into the Escalade.I looked over at the door before turning the key in the ignition and roaring onto the main road.Krystie?Of all people?What the hell.The highway seemed lonely tonight.No stars were shining brightly like they usually did.Even the music on the radio couldnt help my mood tonight.It felt like when my husband had died.The love shattered and this horrible sinking feeling filled that void.Eight months and he could just go back to her in a second.Oct said they had a bad falling out but it didnt look that bad to me.Breaking my thoughts was the sound of a siren.I pulled over to the side to watch two firetrucks zoom past me.Somebody died.I whispered as I always did when I saw fire trucks or ambulances.Once they flew past my sight I merged back onto the highway.There were only a couple of cars out tonight so I didnt feel the need to speed like I usually did when I was driving this beast.I pulled off on exit 5 towards my apartment.The streets were quiet and then suddenly bustling with activity.I slowed down and noticed a bunch of people in the streets.What the hell?I asked.I took a right and decided to go the back way to my apartment instead.This way was a lot better but as soon as I got close enough to see my apartment I realized why everyone was in the road.Engulfed by flames stood my apartment building, crumbling in front of me.My mouth gaped as I slammed on the brakes.The fire was licking the sky as it crawled across the small complex building.The building held a total of four apartments, stacked on top of each other.The top floor had already been completely demolished and my apartment was currently set on flames.No.I whispered and got out of the car.I started running towards the wreck but a police officer grabbed me.No!I screamed at him and he just tightened his grip.First the guy I thought I was falling for fucked me over, now my apartment is on fire.No.I whispered and my body crumbled onto the ground.Slowly the policeman let me go.I looked up at him realizing he was the man Kevin we had hired back at orientation.Kevin?I whispered in a hoarse voice.He knelt down next to me.Anya?Is this your place?Man Im so sorry.His face looked sincere.What happened?I whispered.My hair was blowing around in my face.This smoke was rising and wafting out in all directions and I could smell the sickening smell of my life burning.Electrical fire on the top floor.At least everyone got out.I looked up at him, my eyes hollow and my skin growing pale.Its okay.I didnt expect him to pull me into an embrace but that is exactly what he did.I wasnt sure if it was because I looked so homely or because he knew what I was going through.I pulled away and wiped the stray tears from my face.This sucks.I whispered and he nodded, standing up.He held his arm out to me and I took the hug.Thanks.You need to get yourself to a hotel.Ill let you know what happens okay?Your place is which one?The one currently on fire.I whispered.He glanced over to the massive red and orange blur of flames and nodded.It probably wont make it.He said in a hushed voice.The spray from the fire extinguishers were finally showing up against the massive burst of fire.I nodded and turned around, climbing back into the car.Thank you Kevin.I smiled and he nodded back at me.I never turned the car off when I had gotten out of it so it was still purring when I closed the door behind me.The fire had me transfixed.I grabbed my phone without looking at it and pushed the green call button after pushing a few different buttons.It rang a couple times and a breathless voice answered.Anya?Anya I am so sorry please dont get mad at me.It is a long story.I promise I will explain.Anya?His voice washed over me as I stared at the fire consuming my home.My apartment is on fire.I whispered and at first he didnt respond.The police say it wont make it.It started in the apartment above me and now it is slowly working its way down.My voice cracked on the last few words and his breath stopped on the receiver.Where are you?He asked into the phone.I could hear the clanking of keys and him rushing around the house.Anya?Are you at your place?Let me come get you.I have the car.I will be there in ten minutes.I spoke in a calm manner, the fire still sucking my focus from me.Bye.With that I hung up the phone and took a deep breath.I let it out slowly and turned the car around and headed towards Rexs place.I need a drink.I whispered to myself.The ride there was the quickest drive I had encountered in a while.When I pulled in the house was dark, only one or two lights were on.The first person I saw was surprisingly not Rex.Octavius car was parked next to Rexs.Oct was sitting on a chair outside the place, cigarette in hand and smoke escaping his lips.I turned the lights off and switched the engine off.I just sat there in the car, unable to move as the slow realization sunk into my bones.I have no home.No stuff.Nothing.The dark mass of Octavius rose and went inside.I felt my head fall slowly onto the wheel of the car.I closed my eyes and just let myself relax a little from the stress welling up inside of me.The door opened and the car chimed.Anya.Rex whispered and touched my shoulder lightly.I leaned back in the chair and turned my face to him.Oh my Anya.He touched my face.I had ash in my hair and a smear on my cheek.I didnt notice this of course until he told me.Come on.I followed him inside wondering where Oct had gone.Where did Oct go?I whispered looking up at Rex.He just smiled and shook his head.No need to worry about that.He brought me to the bathroom and turned the shower on.I could feel the steam from the hot water pouring into the bathroom.He touched my cheek gently and kissed my lips.I stayed lifeless and turned my head away.
