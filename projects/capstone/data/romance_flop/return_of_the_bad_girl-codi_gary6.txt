You and Everett?God, no.Justins dad will be there and Ellie too.Unease settled in the pit of Carolines stomach.Why are you laughing?Is thinking that my practically engaged sister might try to play matchmaker for me really so wild an idea?No, its just ...Sorry, but ...Everett is this super nice guy, but hes kind of ...emotionally damaged, and youre ...Im what?Caroline asked, glaring at her sister.Im not nice?No, youre secure in yourself and who you are.Youre strong and youre successful, and I just think he needs someone a little more ...nurturing.Caroline had been taking care of kittens for over a weekgetting up with them, feeding them, making them poo, for Gods sakebut she wasnt nurturing?Right, Caroline said, smoothing her hair out of her eyes as she stood.Im an ice queen.I forgot.Caroline, thats not what I You know, Ive been back in this town for a little over a month, and Ive gotten nothing but grief from my father, random freaks, and crazy women.Even the fucking checkout girl at Halls Market has been giving me tude every time I go in there!The only people who are willing to give me a snowballs chance, I can count on one hand!Maybe because theyve never been screwed by you before, Val said sharply.You think I screwed you?Caroline said, incredulous.Yes.I think you fucking bailed because Dad wasnt going to let you do whatever the fuck you wanted, and you left Ellie and me behind to pick up the damn pieces.Caroline knew Val had been upset with her for leaving Rock Canyon at first, but shed never given any indication shed felt betrayed.But regardless, Vals assumptions beat at the flames of Carolines temper, causing it to flare.You dont know anything about what happened back then, so why dont you shut the fuck up, Valerie?The only reason I dont know things is because you dont talk to me!Since youve been back, its been all surface stuff and casual conversations.Every time I get too personal, you shut me out.Or maybe Im trying to protect you.I am a grown ass woman who has managed to survive this long without you shielding me from the bogeyman.Is this about Dad and his shady dealings?Shady dealings?She knew their dad hadnt always walked the straight and narrow when he wanted something, but ...What are you talking about?Val seemed surprised that Caroline didnt know.Ellie found a file with all of this evidence against Dad that could potentially put him in prison.I used it to ...well, to get him to leave Justin and his family alone.He was threatening to have their farm taken away, and I used the folder as incentive for him to back off.Caroline believed her.It figured that their father wouldnt stop at intimidation, especially if it came to one of his daughters doing something he didnt approve of.Hed tried to do the same thing to her when shed left home, but shed had nothing left to lose.So wheres the evidence now?Val asked.Ellie has it.The tense moment wasnt lost on Caroline.Part of her wanted to drop all the defenses and tell Val the hard stuff, but she was afraid Val would pity her.Or worse, challenge Kyle to a duel.Val was finally settled and happy; she didnt need to be dragged down by Carolines problems.Shed been through enough on her own.Wanting to reassure her sister, Caroline reached out to Val and pulled her in for a hug.At first, Val held away stiffly but slowly relaxed in her arms.I know you think Im shutting you out, and Im sorry.Just give me time, okay?Val nodded against her shoulder before pulling away.I know you had it rough after Dad made you leave.I just missed you and want to be close again, like we were when we were kids.That seems like a lifetime ago.We will be.Okay, Val said, gathering up her purse.Well, I have to get home.Im going to try to impress Justin and his family by making a cake.What kind of cake?Caroline asked.The kind that comes from a box and takes about an hour to bake.Caroline saw her sister out and closed the door with a thud.Leaning back against the cool wood, she ran her hands over her face and hair.Her head was pounding, and she knew it was part emotional exhaustion, part stress.It seemed like the more time she spent with Val, the more Caroline wanted to tell her everything, if only to unburden herself.But how fair would that be?Val would be ready to drag Kyle into the police station and press charges, but so many things could go wrong.Kyle was dangerousCaroline knew that better than anyoneand if she tried to bring him down and failed ...He would hurt the people you love to get to you.Suddenly, the apartment walls seemed to be closing in on her.She wanted to get out of there but had nowhere to go, really.She was antsy and irritated, with no outlet.Heading into the kitchen to grab a bottle of water from the fridge, she noticed a drawing hanging from it: two wheels and a set of handlebars surrounded by flames.Moriartys Custom Motorcycles 121 Main St.Rock Canyon, Idaho  It seemed like fate kept giving her little pushes in Gabes direction.The question was, did she want to test her resolve?GABE WAS SWEATING like a fiend in the closed shell of the firehouse.Moving around the work benches hed bought on craigslist and the office furniture in the back was getting to him, and hed already taken off his shirt, which hadnt helped as much as hed hoped.He wanted to be able to open the shop before his second rent check was due, and that meant working fast and hard.Hed have asked Chase for help, but his friend went to church with his wife, while Gabe hadnt gone to church since ...well, ever.Grabbing a bottle of water from the cooler, he took a few gulps and then poured the rest over his head and shoulders, rubbing the cold liquid across his skin.It felt amazing but did little to alleviate the heat.Of course, it wasnt just the stuffiness of the room that was getting to him.It also was sharing a small space with a woman he couldnt get off his mind.Wow, now thats something youd see in a chick flick for sure.Gabe turned quickly and found Caroline standing in the doorway of his shop, as if his thoughts had brought her to him by force of will alone.What are you doing here?he asked, sounding harsher than he meant.I saw the flier design on the fridge, and I was bored, she said, either oblivious of or ignoring his obvious irritation.He guessed it was the latter.So you just thought you would sneak up on me when Im trying to work?I thought maybe you could use some help moving things and setting up, she said, her long ponytail flipping back as she shrugged.But if you dont need me, Ill go do something else.She spun around, her shapely legs walking away from him in dark jeans and knee high boots.They did nothing to decrease his desire for her.Eating up the floor between them, he reached out to touch her arm.What?she said without turning around.I know your first instinct is to be a complete asshole to everyone, but I am not in the mood to take your shit today.She turned to face him and for what felt much longer than a few moments, their gazes fused until he could have sworn sparks erupted.Really?When did you turn into a fucking poet?He could tell himself that what he felt for Caroline was just physicalhis appreciation for a beautiful womanbut hed be lying his ass off.He was protective of Caroline, wanting her safe and sound.Just being in such close quarters amped up those feelingsfeelings he didnt want or need.Especially since she doesnt even know who you really are.I know.I know I can be a dick You said it, not me, she said.But I would appreciate the help.She seemed to be waiting for something else, and he added, gritting his teeth, Please.Fine, she said, heading over to one of the work stools.Where do you want this?Sixteen Where have all the real men gone?Miss Know It All   TWO HOURS LATER, Gabe had to hand it to her; for a short girl, Caroline was damn strong.She hadnt balked at the weight of some of the steel benches or whined about being hot.Shed grunted, laughed, and groaned along with him as theyd lifted the last bench into place.I think Im done for the day, he said.Her voice was breathless as she wiped her hand across her forehead.I should probably get home to take care of the kittens anyway.He grabbed a water from the cooler and handed it to her.As he watched her hold the cold bottle to her neck, his eyes were drawn to the swell of her breasts, shiny with sweat.I appreciate the help, he said.No problem.I needed to work off some tension anyway, she said, finally opening the bottle of water to take a long pull.Why are you tense?he asked, his mind suddenly taking a dark turn.Did something else happen with that guy who attacked you?What?Oh, no, its just family stuff.My sister actually, she said, setting her bottle down and walking around him.By the way, who is HM?What?he said, surprised by her straightforward question.The painting you hung in the living room.Its signed by an HM, and I was curious how you know him ...or her.He took several gulps from another bottle of water and tossed the empty plastic in the trash.HM stands for Honey Moriarty.My sister.I didnt know you had a sister, she said.You never asked.No, I guess I didnt.I guess I didnt feel it was appropriate, considering that youve said several timesif I stay out of your business, youll stay out of mine, she said, taking a long draw of her water before continuing.Although so far, you havent really done your part, have you?What do you mean?Well, no matter how many times I say I dont need your help, you always seem to be there.Its pretty heroic, actually.Besides, you arent really the sharing type anyway.He knew she had chosen heroic because it would needle him, but really, he was amused.Over the last week, hed found that the walls between them were slowly being chipped away, at least on his side.Though it was still killing him that she wouldnt tell him about the man whod attacked her or why.Thats interesting, because every time I ask you about your past or about the guy who assaulted you, you change the subject.Care to bare your soul and divulge all your secrets?Caroline sighed loudly.Point taken.He waited for her to continue, but instead she said, So show me some of these designs of yours.Apparently, sharing time was over.You like motorcycles?Sure.Had one for a while in Arizona.It was awesome.Just one more thing that made her amazing.What kind did you have?he asked.I had a 2010 Ducati Streetfighter.He whistled.What happened to it?I sold it when I moved to Detroit.Too cold most of the year to have one, she said, walking into what would be his office.He grabbed some of his designs from his portfolio and came up alongside her.The sweet smell of her lotion or perfume mixed with her own scent had him leaning closer as he opened the large folder.These are the first plans I drew up for my bike, so you can see how it changed, he said.Why do you call your motorcycle Baby Blue?He shrugged.My sister is a big George Strait fan.Not you?No.Where is she?Who?Your sister.He didnt plan to go there with her, but when he opened his mouth, the words that came out were honest.Shes in a private care facility in Sun Valley.Oh my God, why?He clenched his jaw, ashamed.Gabe didnt want to answer and considered blowing her off, but what good would it do?All she had to do was Google his name, and all his dirty little secrets would be laid out for her to see.What happened to keeping the past under wraps?To a fresh start?Gabe realized that if hed learned one thing about Caroline, it was that she knew how it felt to have people judge you based on your past.And if he couldnt tell her about his, then how could he expect her to be honest with him about her problems?It all came down to trust.And though it had been a long time since hed given his to anyone, for some reason, he felt like this woman could handle it.She was in an accident and suffered a brain injury.She has good days and bad, but she needs constant care.Caroline said nothing, but to his surprise, she pressed her warm hand against his shoulder, branding him with her touch.Im so sorry.Her pity, the last thing he needed from her, had him jerking his shoulder out from under her palm.Dont be.Its my fault shes in there.By the surprised intake of breath, he figured she wasnt prepared for that.Turning, he showed her his other arm.I got this scar from the same accident.And along with the scar, I got a five year sentence in the Nevada State Prison System for driving under the influence and being involved in an accident that caused significant bodily harm.He caught the guarded look on her face, and it pissed him off.I told you.Im not a good guy.Im a selfish fuck who drove drunk because I caught my baby sister kissing my best friend.I shoved her on the back of my bike without making sure her helmet was fastened and on the way home, I overcorrected and skidded across the pavement.I dont remember muchexcept waking up in the hospital, handcuffed to the bed, and being told my sister would never be the same.I should have gotten longer in prison, but with good behavior, they let me out early.Ive been trying like hell to make it up to her, but Ill never be able to.I am a damaged fucking individual, princess.Turning away from her, he slapped the portfolio closed and took a deep, shaky breath.I wasnt going to tell you any of that.I just figured you would find out somehow anyway, so why not get it out of the way?I feel like you keep looking for something more to me, but what you know about me is it.Theres no deep down, no mistaking my true character.I am bad news.He waited, listening for the tap of her retreating feet or the slam of the door, but only silence met his ears and then the soft sound of shoes on the cement flooronly they got closer to him instead of farther away.Fingers trailed feather light touches over his lower back.This scar on your back?Is that from the accident?Her caress made his skin tingle as he shook his head.I was knocked down by one of my mothers boyfriends and landed on a glass table.What about here?Her hand had moved to his right shoulder.It was a tattoo I had removed.In prison, youre safer if you belong, so I understand, she said, cutting him off.Had she heard the pain in his voice, or did she really understand?He turned around before she could point out any more scars.What are you doing?She looked him in the eye and touched the side of his neck, where his tattoo began and spread all the way down, past his shoulder and over his chest.You say youre damaged.That youre bad news and wont ever change.Yeah?To his surprise, she dropped her hand to his and brought it up to her collarbone, where his finger felt a rough, puckered line.This is a knife woundjust a scratch, reallythat I got from a man who used to come see me dance at the strip club.He was constantly asking me out, and I always let him down easy.But one night, after Id had a shitty day, I told him I would never go out with an old, ugly fuck like him.He was waiting by my car when I got off work.His rage blazed at this phantom from her past.What happened?I pulled a move Id learned from one of the bouncers.Even though he still cut me, I was able to pick up a handful of gravel and throw it in his face.I made it to the front door of the club, and he took off.They arrested him on assault charges, and it turned out he had an outstanding warrant.I never saw him again.Caroline pulled him closer, lifting her arm for him to see a jagged scar along her forearm.This was from a broken beer bottle I got sliced with when a woman came into my bar in San Antonio, looking for her husband.She didnt take it well when she found out he had a girlfriend on the side, and when I stepped in to stop her from attacking him, she sliced me.He couldnt stop his hand from sliding up over her soft skin until it rested on the back of her neck, his fingers pressing into her flesh until she tilted her chin up to meet his gaze.Whats your point with all the show and tell, Caroline?She reached out and smoothed his chest with her hand.I dont care how damaged you are, because I am just as broken, maybe more so.Her words tore at him, twisting him up inside as his other hand cupped the back of her head.You dont want to go here with me, princess.Im only going to break your heart.The laugh that passed those beautiful lips was bitter and sad.Trust me, my heart was shattered long before I ever met you.Gabe wanted her, wanted to believe that he could find comfort in her body without the complications that would inevitably come, but hed seen her heart firsthand.She had one.It might be wrapped up in a mile thick layer of cowhide, but a part of Caroline Willis was still open to new emotions.New love.And he wasnt.But he wanted to kiss her anyway.He dropped his head until his lips hovered above hers, and he watched as they parted, the closer he came.Her hot breath teased his mouth, and he couldnt stop while she was warm and willing.He might not get another chance to taste her, and while a better man would have walked away, he wasnt that guy.So he took her mouth with his, sweeping his tongue inside, savoring the sweet and salty taste of her.His fingers slid up into her ponytail, and he knew he was being rough, that he should slow down, but the way her hands gripped his shoulders told him she didnt mind.He took her soft moan into his mouth and, slipping one hand out of her hair and down her body, he did what hed been dreaming of for weeks.Gripping one of her lush ass cheeks, he lifted her onto his desk and stepped between her legs.Damn, but his cock did love pressing against her.Her legs hooked around him, bringing him closer as he dragged up her tank top.Gripping the fabric in his hands, he broke the kiss, leaning his forehead against hers, his breath coming fast and hard.You have exactly three seconds to get out of here before I do everything Ive been thinking about since the first day I saw you.You decide.Now.Her hands slid into the back pockets of his jeans and, gripping his ass, brought him back into her body, giving him her answer.Using both hands, he pulled her tank up and over, tossing it across the room as he took in her lush breasts, curving above the cups of her bra.Covering them with his hands, he squeezed them, molding them into his palms until the gasps and moans escaping her were too much.You are so fucking sexy, he said, bending down to tease the lobe of her ear, drawing it into his mouth with his teeth and loving that she countered his teases with the scrape of her nails on his skin.Oh, yeah?Her voice was hushed and breathy.He reached between them and cupped her through her jeans.Hell yes.Her head fell back, and he took advantage, kissing below her chin and delivering open mouth nips and sucks until he reached the top of her breasts.Hed been dreaming of her like this, and as badly as he wanted to savor the taste of her skin, he found himself feeling frenzied.What if she changed her mind?She had to know that hed let her go in an instant if she asked.God, please, dont let her ask that.It might just kill him.Reaching behind her back, Gabe released her bra, and after slipping it down her arms, he cupped one breast in each of his hands before dipping down to take one of her nipples into his mouth.Her hand cupped the back of his head as he closed his lips around her and sucked hard, gently grazing the peak with his teeth until she was writhing under his ministrations.Her soft cries were music to his ears and encouraged him to experiment.He wanted to please her, to make her feel safe and cherished.Cherished?You need to stop thinking like that, man.This is sexraw and hot, heat of the moment play, and the minute its over, shes gonna walk away.Which is exactly what hed been looking for, right?Hed wanted sex with no strings, just pure physical release.So why did the thought of meaningless sex with Caroline make him almost hesitate going further?Oh, Gabe, she whispered softly.It was exactly how hed imagined shed say it.Gabe pulled away from her breast and moved his other hand down her body until he had the button of her jeans flicked open.The zipper was tricky one handed, but when it finally opened, he pushed his hand down the front of her jeans.His fingers slipped inside her panties, pressing between her folds until he found the hard button of her clit.When her hips jerked up, he leaned over and placed his mouth against the shell of her ear.The rides not over yet, princess.Seventeen Sex is supposed to be messy, chaotic ...and fun.Otherwise, whats the point?Miss Know It All   OHHH!CAROLINE CRIED as Gabe swiftly lay her flat on the desk.Before she could move, he was removing her boots, tossing them to the side so fast, it caused laughter to bubble up her throat.Are we in a hurry?Her teasing was met with such heat, she sucked in her breath.Sure, shed thought of sex with Gabe, imagined all the mechanics, but the raw wanting in his eyes made her weak.His gaze was possessive, and as his hands started inching her jeans down over her hips, every touch felt like a brand against her skin.His lips touched every inch of flesh he revealed, and she wasnt sure anymore whether she was arching away from or toward his mouth.She had always liked to be in control, had never just let a man do what he wanted, but after their turbulent first meeting and the last few weeks of back and forth, somewhere along the way, she had begun to trust Gabe.She trusted him to know what she would like and that he wouldnt hurt her.At least not physically, she amended, as her jeans hit mid thigh, and his mouth hovered over her hips.There was no way shed trust Gabe with more than her body.Even if he wasnt the bastard shed originally thought, she still couldnt picture a future with him.She felt the hot, wet press of his mouth through the black cotton of her panties, and the hard nub of his tongue piercing made her squeal with delight, the sensation dragging her out of her head for just a moment.He stopped tonguing her long enough to take her jeans all the way off, pulling her panties down her legs until she was completely exposed.It wasnt the first time shed been bared to a man in the daylight, but as the fabric of her underwear scraped softly down her skin, she felt nervous and jittery.Maybe because his hands were so gentle, suddenly in no hurry to rid her of this last scrap of clothing.And then her panties circled her ankle before, with one final pull, they silently fell to the floor.Gabe sat down in his office chair, gliding forward until he was right in front of her.Then he spread her legs and hooked them over his shoulders.As she looked down the line of her body to meet his dark gaze, she felt too exposed, the whole situation too intimate.Most of the men shed been with hadnt been all that interested in foreplay, and shed never had a man in the position to see ...well, everything.She started to tell him to stop, but he spoke first.Hang on.Without further ado, his big hands cupped her ass and brought her to his mouth.The wet heat sent her body lifting off the desk as the first sweep of his tongue set her aflame.Pushing his tongue inside her, Gabe flicked that metal bar against her clit in hard, swift strokes that had her nails digging into the wood to the point of pain.God, sex had never been this intense or hot.Maybe it was the tongue ring or the way he took chargenever asking, just doing what he wantedthat had her dripping wet and throbbing.Then that familiar pulsing began, and whether it was his skill or the fact that her last orgasm had been over two months ago, she was suddenly lost moments later, shaking from the inside outand it was a fucking mazing.When she finally started to come down, all she could think was that she wanted to do it again and again and again.The sound of metal on metal drew her gaze back to Gabe, who had already unbuckled his belt and was standing there with his jeans spread open, revealing the tops of his boxer briefs and the hard bumps of his abs above them.She stared at his six pack, and a silly smile spread across her lips.You know, when you came out of the shower that first time in a towel, I thought your abs were hypnotizing.He stopped his movements, and she saw a square condom wrapper in his hand.What?Yeah, I pretty much think you could get away with walking around town nude, and no one would mind.Have you lost your damn mind?he asked before ripping the package open with his teeth.Just stating the facts.You ...are ...fucking ...ho Before she finished, he was kissing her, his hands cradling her face as his tongue slipped into her mouth, sweeping along her teeth.He tasted musky, and she realized it was her essence.When he pulled away, he was sucking in air as he said, For the last two weeks, I have done nothing but think about you.About how good you smell and the way you would feel if I could just get you into my arms.The thought of being this close to you has haunted me, and I have a feeling Im never going to be able to get the reality of you out of my head.What did he mean?Was this not just a one time thing?No, if his behavior hadnt shown her how much he despised intimacy, he had told her as much.Caroline reached up to pull his mouth back down to hers, wanting to cut off anything else he might say.Gabe let her take the lead for a few minutes, but when he pulled away from her to push his jeans down, she saw his cock stretching out the fabric of his boxer briefs and sucked in her breath.He was just so beautiful, so perfectly put together.She ran her hand over his flat stomach to the top of his boxers and slid her hand inside, gripping his velvety breadth, and pumped him with her hand.Caroline rubbed her thumb over the tip of him, and his cock jerked in her hand.He grabbed her wrist and lifted her hand from his shorts.Not that I dont like the way youre touching me, but I want you too bad to wait.Most guys would have sat back and let her continue, hoping it would turn into her going down on them.The fact that Gabe wanted her so bad he couldnt wait to be inside her was new and tantalizing.And it turned her on so bad, she was ready to leap off the table and tackle him.It was a fantastic feeling, and as he shoved his boxers down his legs, she licked her lips, watching him roll the length of latex over himself.Without another word, he stepped between her legs and grabbed her ass with both hands.As he lifted her up, she wrapped her legs around his hard waist and rubbed against the stiff erection pressing at her entrance.She felt the brick wall at her back as he adjusted himself and slipped inside, inch by inch, slowly tormenting her until her eyes rolled back, and she whimpered with impatience.She didnt want slow and sweet.She wanted fast, crazy, buildings falling down around them sex, and to get her point across, she gripped his shoulders and rolled her hips sharply.He looked up at her, their eyes locking across the inches, and she saw need in those dark depths ...but also uncertainty.Gabe?Uncertain?She must be losing her mind.Suddenly, he thrust up, hard and deep, seating himself all the way inside her, and the motion left them pressed tightly against the wall.They were so close, eyes and mouths close enough to touch, yet he didnt kiss her or say anything.Still, their breath mingled with each movement, and he never looked away.Caroline had had sex, had been fuckedbut shed never had a guy watch her so intently.It was like he was searching for an answer in her expression while he took her.But it didnt matter what the question was; she wasnt prepared for this.When he slipped out again and pumped her several times with quick strokes, she closed her eyes, breaking the eye contact to hang on as each zing of pleasure shot through her body.She tried to concentrate on the way her body felt and to push those dark, searching eyes from her mind.Her moans gained pitch with each pass, and she buried her lips into his shoulder as her muscles clenched, and her second orgasm of the day brought about wave after wave of relief.Spent and relaxed, she held on as he shouted her name, a warm smile spreading across her lips when she felt his cock flex inside her as he came.His chest heaved against her, and while she waited for him to collect himself, she drew lazy patterns over his back.Besides, she was quite out of breath herself.He pulled away enough to look down at her.If you want to go again, you might have to give me a minute.A breathless giggle escaped her as she admitted, When you said sex with you was a ride, you werent just whistlin Dixie.Whistlin Dixie?Who are you, Granny Clampett?My mom used to say it.She was originally from Mississippi and moved here when she was thirteen.His harsh laugh caused her stomach to flip flop all over.Shed never heard him laugh, and damn, it was sexy.But Gabes laugh also sounded hoarse, like he didnt use it very often.Shed always loved to make people laugh, especially as a kid.Involuntarily, she smoothed her fingertips across his lips, lingering on the edges and then trailing up to the crinkles at the edge of his eyes.You searching for more scars?No, she said, removing her hand.For just a minute, she had forgotten this was a flukea one time thingand had been trying to memorize the moment.As if she wanted more.Unwrapping her legs from his waist, she felt him slide from her body and shivered as her muscles clenched again.Still, Gabe didnt release her right away, holding her at her waist until she dropped her arms from his shoulders.She could definitely go another round, but she didnt plan on making a habit of jumping Gabe whenever she had an itch her vibrator wouldnt satisfy.He was a self proclaimed bad guy, and although she wasnt perfect, she did want to find someone she could have a future with.A mature adult with his life together.Besides, if she was ever going to breach her fathers defenses, there was no way she was going to do it with a tattooed ex con by her side.If her father pitched a fit at Vals squeaky clean former marine Justin Silverton, hed have another heart attack if she introduced him to Gabe.Damn, have you always been a snob, and its just been lying dormant?You arent exactly the type of girl nice guys bring home to Mama ...I should get dressed and get back home.The kittens are probably hungry, and I You dont have to explain, Gabe said as he walked to where his briefs and jeans lay.I get what this was.You do?Yeah, he said, his back to her.She saw him drop the condom into the wastebasket before he stepped into his boxer briefs, pulling them up and over those hard, drool worthy calves and thighs until his sculpted ass disappeared beneath the navy cotton.She bit her lip to shut her mouth.If she didnt stop staring at him, drool was going to start dribbling down her chin.He turned around to face her as he shook out his jeans and pulled them back on.You were horny as hell, and I was available.I understand, and believe me, I didnt mind.Okay, so maybe shed been thinking almost the exact same thing, but that didnt mean he could just assume that she was using him to get her rocks off.Why not?Thats what it was.Why cant he call a spade a spade?Because despite her best efforts not to let it get to her, when hed looked into her eyes, part of her had felt like he could see into her soul.Is that what it was for you?He had the damn nerve to shrug.Bastard.Huh.She moved over to where hed tossed her jeans and took several long, calming breaths.I say something wrong?Was this supposed to be something more?No, of course youre right, she said, pulling her jeans on without her underwear.I helped you move your shit around just so you would fuck me.I had this whole thing planned.Im like some kind of moving prostitute.I help you move, and you He pulled her to him so fast, her mouth snapped shut.I think I liked you better when your mouth was making those little moans against my neck.She jerked away from him.Youre a pig.Wanna get dirty?Hell no, she said, gathering up her shirt and undergarments and heading toward the front of the building to get dressed.In fact, the next time Im feeling horny, Ill be sure to go elsewhere to get my jollies off.Her shoulders stiffened when Gabe called, Ill see you at home, princess.Asshole, she muttered as she slammed the office door.Why are you pissed at him?He gave you an incredible orgasmtwice, in factand you act like he insulted you.As she climbed into her car, it struck her; shed been deluding herself when she thought maybe hed felt something more.The whole time shed been worried he might be thinking this would lead to a more permanent situation, maybe even a relationship, but the minute it was over, he was all business.So were you.Had she wanted him to want more from her than just sex?Shed been telling herself for weeks that he was not the guy she wanted to make a fresh start, yet she was drawn to him and not just because he was her type.Shed seen subtle signs that maybe he wasnt all that he seemed.That this was the strongest attraction shed had for a man in years, and now that shed given in, she couldnt shake the desire for more.Lord, was she a hot mess.How the hell was she going to survive living with him, knowing exactly what he could do to a woman?Eighteen Communication is the key to any healthy relationship ...which explains why the silent treatment is a womans favorite form of torture.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE DROVE HOME to feed the kittens, but once she was done, she didnt really feel like sticking around and hashing things out with Gabe.Shed calmed down enough to realize she had blown up at him over nothing, let her own issues fuel her crazy, and now not only had she slept with him, but shed been that girl, the one who wigs out after sex and scares the hell out of a guy.Looking for something to take the edge off, she grabbed a beer from the fridge and chugged down half of it without taking a breath.Water wouldve probably been better, but despite her reasonable deduction that the awkwardness after sex had been her fault, stealing Gabes last beer gave her perverse pleasure.He was going to be pissed, and she didnt even care.Actually, she was sort of looking forward to it.Jumping in the shower, she cleaned herself up and decided to head over to Justins family farm for dinner after all.She needed advice, and the only person she felt comfortable enough asking was Val.Thirty minutes later, she was kicking up dust with her tires down the long dirt road leading to the Silverton farm.Green fields went on for miles, the only trees being closer to the white ranch house, tall green pines to block the wind.As she pulled up next to Vals truck, nervousness settled in the pit of her stomach.What had she been thinking to drive all the way out here without calling?What if Val told her to take off?Val would never bail on you.Ever.But still, Justins family was here.How was she going to get Val alone without drawing attention to herself?She might as well wait and call her a little later.Hand on the gear shift, she was just about to throw her car into reverse when the front door opened, and Val stepped out onto the porch.A few seconds later, Ellie followed, and before she could escape, both of her sisters were standing next to her drivers side door, staring in at her.I thought you couldnt make it, Val said.I changed my mind, Caroline said, opening the door.If the invitation is still open.Of course its open, Ellie said, pulling the car door open wider.We were just getting ready to eat.As Caroline stepped out, a dark smudge on Ellies cheek caught her eye, despite the layer of cover up shed tried to apply.Reaching out her hand, she touched Ellies face.What happened?I got into a fight with one of my girlfriends at Bucks, Ellie said.It was entirely plausible, but Caroline didnt buy it.Not with the way Ellies eyes shifted away.Her baby sister might be a hell of an actress, but she couldnt fool Caroline.Dont get me started, Val said, shaking her head.Im just thankful she didnt get arrested, or I might have had to bail her out.Caroline didnt miss Ellies pleading eyes and decided to back her sisters play.For now.Val, I just wanted to say Im sorry for the way I acted earlier.Ive just been a little on edge lately.You dont have to apologize.I know I handled my invitation badly.Youve got a lot going on, and I didnt mean to lash out at you.No, look, I havent been exactly available to you, and I know my taking off twelve years ago was sudden, but there are things you dont know.Things that are hard for me to talk about.But that last argument with Dad ...He asked me to do something I just couldnt do, and when I refused, he told me to get out and never come back.He said you refused to go to college at Boise State, Val said, her voice laced with confusion.It was time.With Kyles attack weighing on her mind, she had been considering telling her sisters, especially now that their father knew.Before she changed her mind, Caroline drew in a deep breath and her courage.I couldnt go to Boise State because the guy who raped me went there.Both of her sisters gasped, but Val was the one who reacted first.She pulled Caroline into her arms roughly, squeezing her so hard she almost couldnt breathe.Oh my God, Caroline, why didnt you tell me?Tears pricked Carolines eyes, and she swallowed hard.I didnt tell anyone.But why?Ellie asked, joining in on the hug.Partly, to protect you guys, Caroline said, second guessing herself.If she told Val everything, her sister might lose her shit and confront Kyle.The other half was because I was afraid no one would believe me.Of course wed believe you!Who wouldnt believe you?Ellie said, pulling away to look Caroline right in the eye.At least, thats where she assumed Ellie was looking, but her vision was too blurry to know for sure.Val pulled away too, but she was giving off waves of rage that told Caroline her prediction wasnt far off the mark.I want to know who it was, Val said.Im going to kill him.Eviscerate him.Stake him to the ground in Justins cornfield and run him over with the harvester.Caroline was already shaking her head, despite the insane urge to laugh at her five foot, hundred pound sister taking Kyle out.I cant tell you.What?Ellie and Val both cried, but only Val added, Why the hell not?Because what good would it do?Its in the past, and if I was going to do something, I should have done it right after it happened, but I was so afraid She caught herself before she finished saying that she was afraid Kyle would hurt them and said instead, You two just need to be careful, okay?Make sure you arent going off alone, especially at night.Val opened her mouth to say something else, but Justin popped his head out at that moment, flashing an apologetic smile.Sorry to interrupt, but dinners on the table, Justin said, raising his hand to wave.Hey, Caroline, glad you could make it.Thanks, Justin.Well be in, Val said, waiting until hed shut the door again before hissing, This is not over.I will have that bastards name.Down, girl, Caroline said, reaching out for Vals hand.I appreciate you wanting to avenge my honor, but I dont need you to go all vigilante justice, okay?I just need you to be careful and take care of yourself.Caroline held up her hand, stopping Vals protest.Lets just enjoy dinner with your future in laws.Val started sputtering that they werent engaged and the normal, safe conversation warmed Caroline, who was trying hard to get her emotions in check.For years, shed imagined what it would feel like to unburden herself on someone else, and even though she hadnt shared everything, it was still relieving to have this one secret off her chest.And to know that her sisters had been supportive.Between Ellies compassion and Vals protective nature, Caroline felt cherished and loved; she had forgotten how good it felt to be accepted.Val headed for the porch first, while Ellie and Caroline trailed behind.Caroline touched Ellies arm and pointed to her eye.This better not happen again, Caroline whispered.I told you, it What are you two talking about without me?Val asked, holding the door open for them.Nothing, Ellie said, quickly.I was just giving her a little advice about what to do in a fight, Caroline said, catching Ellies eye meaningfully.The first rule is, dont get hit.Ellie pushed past Val to get inside.What the hell is her problem?Val asked, rubbing her chest where Ellie had bumped her.Shes a Willis; weve never been very good at taking advice.GABE HAD BEEN stewing for hours at the apartment, waiting for Caroline to get home.Despite all the warning signs that getting involved with her would lead to disaster, he hadnt been able to stop once theyd started, and sure enough, it had ended with him pissing her off.That hadnt been his intention, of course.Hed been nervous as hell, as hard as it was to believe, and when he got nervous, he said stupid shit.He just hadnt wanted her to read too much into his reaction to their sexcapadewhich had been fucking mind blowing.Hed been reduced to a sixteen year old kid, shocked as hell that the hottest girl he knew wanted to do it, and hed embarrassed himself.For a minute there, when their gazes had met as he slid into her, hed thought there was a connection.Something more than sex, more than just lust.As if their souls had recognized one another.Something was wrong with him, that was for damn sure.Flowery thoughts and obsessing over a woman just wasnt his style.Still, hed wanted to give her time to calm down, so hopefully they could have a reasonable conversation.He hadnt been prepared to walk into a disaster zone.The formula bottles for the kittens had been left on the counter without even being rinsed out.Clothes were littered across the bathroom floor, and her towel was thrown across the back of the couch.So, she was in a hurry.You arent exactly Mr.Clean when youre rushed.Heading over to the fridge, hed opened it and reached in, wanting to sit down with a cold beer while he tried to find something to watch.Only there was no beer.There had been one can last night when hed gone to bed, and he hadnt been home at all today.Which meant Caroline had come in here and taken his last beer, just to be spiteful.Maybe she planned to pick up more on her way home.It was almost nine, though, so he wasnt holding his breath.A knock at the door interrupted his dark thoughts.Who the hell would come calling at nine oclock on a Sunday?He pulled open the door and found a pale blond guy standing on the porch.The guy seemed surprised to see him.Im looking for Caroline.Shes not here, Gabe said gruffly, eyeing the blue suit the guy was sporting.It looked expensive, but then again, the last suit hed worn had been a rental, so what did he know?Will you just let her know that Kyle came by?There was something about the guy Gabe didnt like, and it wasnt just that he looked slicker than snot.Sure, Skip, when she gets home, thats the first thing Ill do.Ole Kyle didnt like that.Its important.Im sure it is, but I gotta ask, if you need to see her so bad, why dont you just give her a call?That made Kyle angry, if the deep red of his skin was any indication.I lost her number.Well, that sounds like a personal problem, Kyle, Gabe said and started to shut the door.Kyle?Carolines voice sounded from the bottom of the stairs.Gabe opened the door again as Kyle turned toward her.Caroline.I was hoping we could talk.Caroline paled for a half second before Kyle started down the stairs, and every muscle in Gabes body tensed.This is the guy.Gabe came out the door with a vengeance and grabbed Kyle by the back of the jacket.There was no way he was letting the fucker take one more step toward Caroline.What the fuck do you think youre doing?Kyle shouted as he tried to shake Gabes grip.Gabe let Kyles jacket go long enough to allow Kyle to turn around and face him.Ill sue Gabes fist connected with Kyles pretty face, and he stumbled back against the railing.Gabe!Caroline screamed, starting up the stairs.Dont!But he wasnt going to stop, not until he scared the piss out of the little prick.This is the guy, right?Gabe said, collecting the front of Kyles shirt in his hand, ignoring the blood from Kyles split lip as it dripped onto his hand.I didnt tell you that, she said.You didnt have to, Gabe said, pushing and shoving Kyle down the metal steps.The fact that she hadnt denied it told him all he needed to know.Get out of the way, Caroline.Though Gabe might have sounded calm, he was anything but.He reached the ground with Kyle and knocked him backward with a hard upper cut.He wanted to see this piece of shit quake in his fancy suit, for him to beg Gabe to stop.Caroline tried to get between them.Gabe, you cant do this.Hes a lawyer, and you have a record!Think about it!Gabes arms shook with the need to twist Kyles neck until it snapped, but her words broke through the fog of rage.He couldnt go back to prison, not with Honey depending on him.And what would happen to Caroline if he was locked up?If he wasnt here, would Kyle hurt her?With one last punch to Kyles middle, dropping him to the ground, Gabe stood over him menacingly.You stay away from her, do you hear me?Do not come to this house again, or Ill make sure you disappear.Kyle groaned and rolled onto his side, coughing.He looked up at them with hatred and rasped, Ill be pressing charges.No, you wont, Gabe said, rubbing his sore knuckles.People might start asking questions about what you were doing here, and I doubt Caroline will back you up when the police want an explanation.Without waiting for Kyle to say more, Gabe turned to Caroline and put his hand on the small of her back.Come on.She let him gently propel her up the stairs, and when they got through the door, he shut and dead bolted it behind them.Caroline stood by the back of the couch, her shoulders shaking.As Gabe drew closer to her, all his earlier irritation melted away, and he just wanted to comfort her.
