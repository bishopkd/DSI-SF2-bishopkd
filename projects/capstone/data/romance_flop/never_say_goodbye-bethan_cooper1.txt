  Charlotte, North Carolina, USA.April 2006      I stare profoundly at the little white pill in front of me and put it on my tongue.Nope, still tastes disgusting.I hold my hands to my throat as I gag slightly at its acidity.Tumbler, water, NOW.I let the water slide down my throat, mouthful after mouthful to erase the foul taste.At least today, I remembered.I run my hands through my hair, deciding on how to wear it.Not that it matters.Not that anyone cares.I frown at myself and decide on a braid.I weave my hair in and out creating a perfect pattern.I stare sadly in the mirror at the girl looking back at me.My black hoody and tight denim jeans do not show who I am.They hide me.My chestnut brown hair matches my pale grey blue eyes and my skin is flawless.I look down at my wrist and notice a scar has appeared on my arm.I pull my sleeve down, conscious of its existence.My cell starts to vibrate, suddenly distracting me from the pain and sorrow of my white lines.I pick it up from the side table and answer the call.It's Jade, my best and most beautiful friend.She has the most perfect chocolate brown eyes and rich copper hair.Of course, her body is perfect.She intimidates me.I've lost count of the number of men who beg at her pretty little feet."Hi, Jade, everything okay?"I can sense the distress in my voice, twisting my hair in my plait.I smile instantly at her."Yeah, babe, just checking if youre still coming to pick me up. "Oh shit, of course.Todays Friday and I always pick Jade up.It hasnt changed since I passed Drivers Ed.I check my watch and start to quickly grab my things.Yeah, um...I wont be long, about half hour?"I say with a rush.I look down at my jeans and pull hard across so the button matches the buttonhole.Why won't my jeans fasten!Great, now I'm fat.I sigh at the thought."Okay, babe, love you," she says quickly and hangs up.Shit, school.Shit.******  School is always like this on a Friday.Boring, and well, boring.I sense the people passing me in the corridor, oblivious to my tears, and me.Ive never felt as much sadness in my heart as I do at this exact moment.Im being stupid.I run to the nearest restroom and dry my eyes.Silly, silly Ella.Always dreaming and never believing.I need a love in my life.I need hopes, a real dream to chase me, to follow me.To help me.Maybe one day I will be okay again.That's all I want.I don't care what it takes.I just want to be okay again.Maybe my day is today.I shake off the idea, dab my eyes with some toilet paper, and reapply my mascara.I just want someone to call me angel, or baby, or anything.Something that means something to someone.So that I mean something to someone.I dont like being Ella 'Smella' anymore.The school bell startles me and I snap back to reality.As I finish up my pointless bit of makeup, I look up and notice Jade looking directly at me.Ella, whats wrong?You said you were okay on the ride over here.Nothing, Jade, just me being stupid, ignore me.I lied.I shrug my backpack onto my shoulder and turn to look at her.Ella, Im not stupid.Ive known you since kindergarten.Stop this, and before I know it, Im in Jades arms.Comforted by her embrace, I take full advantage.She smells beautiful today, especially her hair.I envy her sometimes.She gently pushes me out to full arms length; her brown eyes are studying me, invading me.Tell me, Ella, or Ill force you, and thats not a threat, that's a promise.Her smile is infectious.I find myself laughing out loud and she joins me.This is why she's my best friend.Shes amazing.Im just sad, Jade, fed up of hiding myself away from everyone, everything.I just want to be found, you know?By someone that maybe gives a damn about me and my feelings for once, not including you, as you care for me more than anyone I know.Im just lost right now.I know I will find my way.It just counts as to where and when.I smile softly at her and she hugs me again.Your life has just begun.She whispers in my ear.Come, she commands and links her arm through mine.But the truth is, I'm not living.I'm just surviving.We walk through the corridor and people wave and say hello to Jade, Im ignored.My head hangs low and I watch my feet move, but I can't feel anything.The pang of jealousy always makes me envious and alone.We walk past a group of boys congregating by the lockers.Jades boyfriend, Mark, is there and he waves us over.Don't be afraid, she whispers to me.Im not.I whisper back, she smiles at me and unlocks her arm.NO!Shit, she was my shield.I am not ready for this.She wanders over to Mark and Im left standing there, staring at my sneakers.Ella.Mark acknowledges.I give him a brief smile and turn back to my feet.There are four or five other boys standing at the lockers.They all look the same, dressed in the same clothing I think, and their hair is all in the same style   surfer rugged and loose.I feel a shudder run through my body.Its so unexpected it scares me.I turn to walk away.I shouldnt be here.These people are strangers to me.I need to run.As far away and as fast as possible.I can feel eyes on me, but I cant feel what direction they are coming from.I scan the hallway in the direction I have turned.See ya later, Jade!I shout as I start to walk away.ELLA!she shouts, but Im walking fast, I need to get away.I feel myself starting to run and I really dont want to stop.All my depressive thoughts fill my head again.Youre not worth it Ella, the world would be better off without you and your stupid fucking brain.This causes yet again, more tears.I shake my head in frustration, pull my hood over my head, and slow my pace through the school.I stop to try to find my iPod in my backpack, but it's buried in the abyss of books.Im looking down when I bump into him.Sorry.I stammer as I look up to meet the person I had rudely interrupted.Whoa.Thats okay, the kindness in his voice startles me.No Ella Smella.His smile is widening as he looks at me.His deep green eyes searching mine, his soft brown hair combed to the side with some escaping onto his forehead, a messy look that takes my breath away.His chiseled cheekbones fit his face perfectly.He looks muscular beneath his blue hoody and he is tall, boy is he tall!About six foot Id say.I know him.I know who this is.He's the most sought after guy in school, Luke James.But, I'm feeling something from him.I cant pinpoint it and its bugging me.Ella?How does he know my name?Are you okay, have you been crying?He moves his hand toward my face and I pull back.Um, Im fine, just tired.Sorry, Luke.I wipe my face in the most un ladylike manner.Dont apologize, Ella.I wasnt looking either, he whispers.For the first time today, I feel a genuine blush cross my face.Luke is beautiful.Taken of course.Jenna Roberts is her name   I think.She has bleach blonde hair and deep, dark brown eyes, full of deep dark secrets.She is most definitely the most popular girl in school.She is one of the only people who have ever made fun of me for no reason.Torturing me with her awful name calling.See you, Ella, try to stop crying.Life is a mystery.He smiles.I look up to meet his gaze once more and melt."Bye, Luke.I whisper.I scurry off past him and feel his eyes follow me as I go.What the hell was that?******  I find myself sitting in English, my favorite class of the day.I slowly drift off into a deep daydream and I find myself falling much deeper into a dark abyss.Im in a room, its pitch black, and I'm all alone.Im panicked and my breathing is erratic.I steady myself, breathe as deeply as I can, and release the air from my lungs.Then, in the shadows, a voice appears.Its dark, seductive, and captures me.Dont worry, Ella.Im here, too.I can feel his presence as he walks towards me.Light comes streaming through a window that has just appeared.This full 6 foot body of a man is reaching for me.His hands begin invading my body, his strong, long arms holding me tightly at my waist.His fierce green eyes look deep into mine, green to grey, and they invade my soul.They captivate my heart.I reach out and feel his tanned, muscular torso beneath my trembling hands.He feels so nice to touch.I reach up and feel his dark brown hair float through my fingers.My eyes never leave his, and as I find comfort in his embrace to reach my mouth to his, he shouts at me.ELLA!ELLA!I wake up this time and it startles me.I had dozed off on my desk.No time for dozing in my class, young lady.He snaps at me.Its Alex, my English teacher.He's about 32 and is pretty gorgeous.He only lets us call him by his first name.He has beautiful bright blue eyes and blonde sandy hair.He looks like a surfer boy who never grew up.I heard rumors last year that he took a student, funnily enough, Jenna Roberts, to a swanky bar in town and then had his way with her.Well, I wouldn't have said no.But, I am still a virgin and intend to stay that way.That is my promise to myself, well, until I meet the love of my life at least.Its sacred giving yourself to someone, especially that way.I want it to be special and deep, and something beautiful, but yet adults assume we know nothing at this age.******    As school finishes, I make my way to the exit.I'm being extra careful to dodge Jade, mainly because of my little escape earlier.No doubt she will call me later.I make a stop at my locker and pick up a few schoolbooks, which I need for homework.Continuing my exit, I walk over to the oldest car in the parking lot.I climb into my vintage, yes vintage, Mustang.Its a 1965 soft top, its so beautiful.I love old cars, especially this one.Its bright blue on the outside, but inside its wrecked.I've lost count of all the silver duct tape that holds the leather firmly in place.I climb in and attach my iPod into the system that my daddy installed for me.Nickelback fill my ears with a song about Someday.As I turn the key to drive away, the lyrics speak to me, so I scream them.My breathing is fast.Time to drive Ella.As the engine roars into life, I go as fast as I can to the school gates.All these people are staring at me, but I don't really care.The music is much louder than it should be.My mom would be so annoyed.SHIT!I slam my breaks and screech to a halt.In front of me is the guy I ran into earlier.His blue jeans hang softly from his hips, his hoody defining his broad shoulders.He smiles at me and I turn the music down.You have a knack for running into me today, huh, Ella?He shakes his head at me and walks around to the drivers door.He looks just as good as I remember, even though I nearly knocked him over.His eyes never leave mine.He squats next to the drivers door, his forearms leaning against the cool, blue metal.I don't believe you're okay, Ella, I mean that music for one, the lyrics are quite sad, right?He says quietly.I smirk.Not that it makes any difference to you, or me, or anyone.Just go away, Luke.Im worthless.Im told enough.I believe you said it to me once as well.I don't have time for you.My words just stumble out and I regret them straight away.He stands up and starts to walk away.I turn the key and restart the ignition.My passenger door opens and Luke climbs in.What the...?Luke, what are you doing?There is such anger escaping my mouth.Ella, lets go somewhere, you and me.He's acting like this is normal.I don't know you, Luke.You are a stranger to me, why the hell would I go somewhere with you?You know me well enough to know I wont hurt or kill you, Ella.He laughs.He throws his backpack onto my back seat and secures his seat belt.Fine.I submit.My hands hit the steering wheel.Where do you wanna go?I ask.Anywhere, somewhere we can just talk?Luke, this makes no sense?Just drive, Ella.Turn the music back up loud.Lets go.I turn the stereo back on and drive out of the school gates.I notice Jenna in my side mirror with her posse, just standing in shock.I laugh to myself and head out.For once, I finally have something to laugh about later.I stop at a bridge.Its one of the most private places in the world to me, and if he wants to talk, then at least we are in one of my comfort zones and not one of his.I switch off the ignition and look down at my hands on the steering wheel.Why are we stopping?he asks.This is one of my places, Luke, where I go to write.You want to talk?We can do it here.This is where Im comfortable.Okay, sure, let's go.He climbs out of my car and shrugs his backpack over his shoulder.I lead him down under the bridge where there is a single bench.This bench has been in my life for about 5 years.I ran away when I was 11.I murmur.Why did you run away?he asks.Because I was sad.I whisper.Like now?he asks, and I nod.Come on, Ella, we only get one chance in life, okay?Im here for you to talk to, to confide in.Maybe its a bit headstrong I admit, but I want to help you and I couldnt shake the thought off all afternoon, since you stumbled into me looking like you did.He laughs and I join in.You have a great laugh, Ella.He smiles at me.A full beam of beauty.We sit side by side.I weave my fingers in and out of each other.Neither of us speaks for a whole minute.The tension is dangerous.I suddenly feel frightened.Maybe its because I've brought a guy up here, to one of my only sanctuaries.Now I'm always going to be reminded of him.Luke  I start and he stops me.Ella, Im here because I want to be.You need a friend that wont destroy you, or your mind, someone who can help you through stuff.I need to be that for someone, I cant explain why, but it wont leave me alone, and you walking into me today opened that up for me.So, you just want to be my friend?Right?I cant hide the hurt in my voice.I don't even deserve to feel hurt, I barely know the guy.Hes a stranger to me, but if he wants to be friends, I could at least try.Yes, Ella, I want to be your friend.Look at me.I turn to face him.I realize I havent checked my face since I cried again earlier.Mascara has probably destroyed my cheeks.He slowly pulls my hood down from my head and pulls my braid out of the jumper so it slumps over my right shoulder.He reaches into his backpack and pulls out a t shirt.He gets out a bottle of water and puts some on the sleeve.Hold still, close your eyes, he whispers.He leans over and wipes my eyes, my cheeks, and tucks my hair behind my ear.Now you look like you; you have beautiful eyes, Ella, he smiles.Thank you.I manage to mumble.No problem, you owe me a new t shirt though.He smiles from the corner of his mouth and bumps his shoulder with mine.He puts the T shirt back in his backpack and turns back to face me.He really is a stunning man, his brown hair shades his eyes slightly, and the green looks so intense through the brown.He makes me nervous.I still don't understand this.Ive never really had a friend, apart from Jade.Yet, here we are, a guy I barely know wants to get to know me.I shift slightly and he puts his hand over mine.Skin on skin.The feeling runs through me like an electric shock.It makes all my hairs stand on end.I get goosebumps immediately.Whoa.He removes his hand and his expression is the same as mine.He must have felt it too.He shakes his head slightly and rubs his palms along his jeans, as if to 'shrug it off'.It was strange and delightful all at once.Its made him edgy, he shifts, like I did a second ago, and he turns to look at me.Our eyes meet, and he looks down at his hands.Ella, he whispers.You know when I asked you to turn the music back up loud?Its because I wanted to know what songs you listen to.What lyrics make you feel sad  I raise my hand to stop him.The music doesnt make me sad, Luke.It makes me think.The lyrics save me.The words sang in a song define my love with myself, with the world.I was in the mood for the music I put on in the car.You know?Someone you don't know, singing to you, telling you about waves crashing, fires never burning out, love never ending.I like to believe it, sink into the words.Fall in love with a song for all the right reasons.Feel the music penetrate my heart, flow in my blood.Breathe in my lungs.I have an eclectic taste in music, it varies.He just stared at me for a split second and his eyes studied my face.Ella, you have the same look in your eyes as I have.I feel the same way about music.It rules me.He runs a hand through his hair.Music is love, Love is music, right?Where did you get that from?I ask.Get what?That quote?I ask, my eyes scanning his.Its written here, Ella.He points to the quote, which I had written quite some time ago.It's written in black marker on the dark wood of the bench.Yes, of course, I knew I recognized it.His eyes widen when I look back at him.We are meant to be talking as friends but I feel the focus is only based on me.I hate it being about me.Luke, tell me about you, this can't all be about me.Okay?I ask him.Yeah sure, Ella.What do you want to know?He smiles.What's your favorite ice cream?What's yours?He smirks.Cookies and Cream, this is about you, not me, remember?Favorite ice cream please?I smile.I dont think I've ever smiled as much.Cookies and Cream.He replies.Snide bastard, he is obviously just trying to impress me.Seriously?I ask with a massive frown upon my face.He lifts his hand to my forehead and runs a finger along the width.You know, you use more muscles in your face when you frown, more then when you smile.So, stop frowning.Smile, and yes, its my favorite.I breathe in slightly and I honestly think I forget how to, just for a second.I stand up and walk over to the edge of the river that gently flows under the bridge.I sit, my knees crossed beneath me, and leave him for a second.What do you want, Luke, seriously?We have just met and you want to be my friend.This isnt the normal way to make friends.For some reason I have brought you here.Some subconscious, or something, has told me to, and here we are, talking about ice cream.When this morning, I couldnt even get my hair straight, and I felt just as alone then as I do now.You can be here, but my mind seems to lack the knowledge of letting people in.Im sorry, but I just cant understand it.I shake my head slightly and sigh.I turn back to look at him.Hes looking at me intently from the bench and has his phone in his hand.He's twirling his cell through his fingers   it's distracting.Ella, he manages.I want to be your friend because earlier when you bumped into me  He swallows hard.What, Luke?I felt something I have never felt before.It felt like a current or something and it rushed through my body like lightening.Like an unstoppable force that just overpowered me.He whispered.I felt it too, but we cant be more then friends, Luke, it would destroy us.He gets up and walks toward me.Stand up.He commands, and I do unwillingly, taking the hand he holds out for me.He turns my shoulders so I'm looking at him.He looks into my eyes, then looks at his feet, and shakes his head.His hands still on my shoulders, looking at me from arms length.This is wrong.He whispers and pulls me into an embrace.If its wrong, then why is he holding me?No, this cant happen if he doesnt want it to.I inhale his scent and begin to fight him off.I push but he doesnt let me go.My arms push against his chest, his arms, but its hopeless.Luke  I whisper.I cant if you cant.He still doesnt release me and I give in and hold him back, my arms wrap around his back, and his head rests down on my shoulders.His hands are on my back, I feel the current and it doesnt leave.It flows through us like waves, it makes me feel complete, and an emotion I dont know captures me.I cant condone it.Ella. "He breathes in deeply.I cant know you.This was a mistake.Why cant you know me?I snap back and push him away, the embrace breaks this time and I nearly stumble over my own feet.The feeling of want is immediately replaced with rejection.Ella, I  he stops.Luke, if you dont want to know me, why lead me under false pretenses?I say quietly.Who do you think you are, Luke?Do you do this a lot?Huh?Get girls to let their guards down and let you in.Luckily for me, I didnt do it too soon.Go away, Luke.I shout.We are about 3 feet apart.He steps towards me and I instantly step back, my arms raised.This is weird, right?We both feel something we shouldnt, you much more than me, but if you dont care, dont.My heart is as fragile as glass, okay?It breaks easy.I can't cope with a broken heart, Luke.I can barely cope right now.Go home, forget this, me, us.Forget my favorite ice cream.Forget my music quote.Forget our embrace.Forget this.Okay?The hurt in my voice this time cannot be hidden.I cant hide from you.I cant make you feel something you dont.I cant be your friend.That's why this is wrong.I need to go home, Ella.He turns toward the bench, picks up his backpack, and looks back at me.In that moment, something shifts.I walk toward him and hug him; he hesitates, but hugs me back softly.Bye.I whisper.Bye, Ella.Remember you're beautiful, okay?We shift and he looks down at me.In that moment, I don't care, I don't wonder.I stare at his mouth and he looks at mine.Our eyes meet and lock and I lean up and kiss him gently on the side of his mouth.Maybe one day.I whisper.When high school isnt so complicated.I turn to walk away and he grabs my arm.He pulls me back and our lips lock.The kiss is meaningful, deep, and passionate.His hands cup my cheeks, his mouth claiming mine.He pushes me up against the wall and pins my arms on either side of my head.His tongue explores and fights with mine, and Im being kissed.I pull away.Luke, no, we cant.I whisper.He puts his forehead against mine and kisses me briefly on the lips.Then he walks away, and all Im left with is his taste, his scent, and his feeling all embossed into me.At that moment, I know I will never get to kiss him again.The feeling destroys me.Two      The weekend goes by so quickly.I do nothing but write in my diary and write my book.I cant get what happened out of my head.His touch, his smell, his kiss.My mother tried inviting me to one of the schools pep rallies but I really didnt want to go.I couldnt risk seeing him and feel more feelings we didnt want.Well, he didnt want.I wouldnt mind getting to know him.To fall for him.To cherish and love him like no other, but its not my time.Not my chance.ELLA!Holly screams from her bedroom.WHAT!I scream back.Come here!she shouts.I clamber off my bed and plod along the landing to her bedroom.My sister is only 16, but so knowledgeable.Shes sat on her bed, her long strawberry blonde hair cascading around her shoulders.She looks up at me with her piercing blue eyes and commands me to sit down.Shes on her laptop, on some social networking site.I never had one.I didnt want to go mainstream, call it the rebel in me.I take a seat on her bed, the wood creaking as I sit next to her.Did you see Luke James on Friday night?She asks.What?I reply.How the hell does she know?Did you, or did you not, see Luke on Friday?Yes.I reply.I never lie to Holly, just like she doesnt to me.Why?Because its all over here, she points to the laptop screen and its true, she has Jenna on the site and her status reads:    Jenna Roberts says: Ergh, dick of a boyfriend decides hed rather see a un loved little bitch then me on friday.And for everyone 2 know he was with that Ella Stone everyone thinks is a freak.Haha.Eric says: Stupid man.I know how he feels about you Jenna they are probably just friends.That one wasn't so bad I suppose.But they got worse.Alexandra Rose says: Ergh what a jerk Jenna, there is nothing to Ella I doubt it was anything serious.Probably just trying to make her feel shit like we do.He wrote one.Shit.Im not sure I want to read it.I do have every right so, whatever.Luke James says: No Jenna, we were just talking as friends.My heart regains some kind of feeling after holding my breath for at least a minute.There are more comments, but I ignore them.Holly turns to me and hugs me from the side.We are sat side by side on her bed.When she releases me, she strokes my hair behind my ear while I fidget with the elastic band around my wrist.We kissed.I tell her.There was something there, Holly, but he doesnt want to know.He said it would be wrong.My tears fall onto my knotted hands in my lap.She lifts my chin to match her face and looks into my eyes.You are perfect, Ella; you have a brilliant family, a brilliant car, which I am still jealous of as I can't drive yet!She laughs.But youre my sister and I love you more than anything.If these guys ever try to hurt you, I will make them taste my wrath.You scare me.How can you be sixteen?I put a loose piece of hair behind her ear and she shrugs.I love you, Holly.See you later, I have somewhere to go.Sure, she replies.Remember I love you too.I climb off her bed and walk out of her room.I grab my keys off the walnut chest next to the front door and slam it behind me.How can these people be this mean?How can they torment me and hate me so much?All I ever want, or need to do, is help them.Be someone's friend.My voice is never heard.High school isnt about the rejects and the ones who arent.Its about the ones with a chance.I never got a chance.Im lucky that even Jade still talks to me.Pain is deep into a person's soul.My pain shows on me everyday.I never socialize.I never go out.I never go to parties, I never dance.I never hang out and I never date.My life is a lie.I climb into the front seat of my Mustang and start the ignition.He purrs and my iPod sparks into life.A slow song about running plays.Snow patrol.Perfect driving song.I pull out of my driveway and go.I don't know where I am heading yet, but at this moment in time, I really dont care.Anywhere but here is perfection.I dont know what to do.Why would he finish with Jenna?I thought they loved each other.Well, obviously not because of what happened on Friday.Its not because of me.Its because shes a bitch.Shes a big, mean, cruel bitch.Ella!I curse at myself, stop being a bitch yourself.I drive through an unknown road of sheltered trees and fields and find myself looking left at a lake.I find somewhere to park, grab my notebook from the passenger seat, and find a comfy piece of grass to sit on.I dont know how long I walk for, but I sit down and fade away for at least 3 hours.When I look up from my notebook, the sun is setting and the orange and red colors float gently on top of the lake.There are geese settling onto the lake and it's serene.Beautiful.I sit and inhale deeply.A smile sweeps my face and I feel at peace.Suddenly starling me, my cell vibrates in my jean pocket.I pull it out and its a number I don't know.I contemplate whether to answer for a while, but I ignore my conscience and answer.Hello?Ella.Its Luke.What does he want?Hi, Luke, what's wrong?Where are you?he commands.I dont know, why?I need to see you, and what do you mean you dont know?Ill come pick you up.Im fine, Luke, I have my car.Even though I don't know how to get home.How did you get my number, Luke?I'm so angry.He cant just lead me on and then dump me within the hour.I cant get hurt, and I barely know him.Holly, he whispers.I tried your house phone and got no answer.I tried again and Holly picked up.I got your home number from the phonebook.What does where you are look like, Ella?He persisted.I dont want to see him.He doesnt mean anything to me, just like I don't to him.Its a lake.Its beautiful.Its sunset.It makes me wish I had my Polaroid.I tease.Im coming.He says abruptly and hangs up.Why the hell is he coming?He has absolutely no reason to even think of me.I cant let this irritate me.My peace and tranquility have disappeared.He was the one that said it was wrong, not me.I inhale deeply and take one last look at the magical colors.I sit for at least another forty five minutes writing my thoughts into my notebook.I re read my words and hold back the tears.The pain of yesterday drowns out the pain of tomorrow.My life is buried in hatred, in lies, nobody cares, and nobody listens.I'm lost in an abyss of my own mind; it tells me I'm worthless, a nothing.To anything.I realize the only light I now had was from the moon.I scramble up onto my feet and walk in the direction that I believe is to my car.The same thought keeps crossing my mind.Why would he want to see me anyway?Its Sunday night, I have school tomorrow, and I suddenly feel lethargic.I need my bed.I feel my eyes struggle to stay open.You're a waste of space Ella.Why can my mind be so cruel?I growl at the thought and realize I can no longer see.Complete darkness has swept the countryside.I struggle to get my phone from my pocket and find the handy flashlight application.I activate it and its so bright I can see everything clearly.I spot my car and walk carefully as to not worry any animals or creatures of the world.Shit.A spark of fear sweeps through me and stills my body.My heartbeat paces and it feels that at any moment it might stop.Its someone, or what it sounds like many peoples voices.Im about 20 meters from my car so I carry on my walk, listening intently to everything.My flashlight gently powers out and my phone lets out an insignificant warning that my battery has died.I bash the back of the phone and put it back in my pocket.So now Im walking in complete darkness when a flashlight stops me in my tracks.Fuck.Its coming from the opposite side of my car.I know once Im in my car Ill be fine.Headlights aim at me and I feel myself suddenly ducking down.The bright beams of light are going down a road; I think its the same one I came from.My heart rate accelerates again and panic sweeps through my veins.I need to get to my car.Raising and steading myself, I run.As fast as I can, until I come to an abrupt halt, running into the cars driver side door.Ouch.Fuck.I whisper and rub my knee.I pray that they didnt hear me.I jump around the door and into the driver's seat, slumping down as far as I can go.I search my pockets for my keys and theyre not there.Shit.I say under my breath.Well, well, well, Ella Stone.What are you doing out here so late and all alone?Her voice is so unexpected and female.I look up and look for the car headlights I saw before.They are still too far away.Out of the car, Ella.The voice is angry and full of tone.I slowly raise myself out of the uncomfortable position I find myself in and stumble when I jump to the ground.Behind me, footsteps approach.Touch my man again, bitch, and I'll kill you.That's not a threat, Ella, but a promise.She spits in my ear.I shudder and the fear returns in full force.My body now feels numb and I can't register what is happening.I look up, as I didnt realize I was looking at the ground.There are four flashlights pointing at me.They stun my eyes so I look away.Suddenly Im on the ground, twigs and mud hit my face.My face meets something hard and cracks under the pressure.Someone kicks me with such force into my stomach it makes me gasp for my next breath.The pain rushes through my body like an electric shock.Why are you doing this?I whisper.Because you took him from me, just like every other bitch did.Its then I realize that this is about Luke.Jenna?I whisper.Far from it.She kicks me again, and this time I cough and splutter, and feel tears slowly descend from my eyes.I hear the car that was approaching park, and the figures move.Until next time.The last figure runs away like the rest of them.The pain is now shocking through me at a radical pace and I cant control my breaths.They are fast and shallow.I must be bleeding because I can taste metal.Someone shouts and it makes me jump.ELLA!Its Luke, he runs and slumps next to me.Ella, shit, what's happened?Are you okay?Talk to me, Ella.I sit up and hold the side of my face.Ouch.Im fine, Luke, I just fell.Dont lie to me, Ella.I cant see him, but his voice comforts me.I saw them run off, whoever it was.One of them warned me not to see you, Luke.That Id stolen you from her.He gently lifts me to my feet.Can you stand?he asks, and if on cue, I wobble.I think so.I slur.Before I can say anything else, Im in his arms.He has lifted me off my feet, holding me like you would a small child.I smell a rich, vibrant cologne float off him.You smell nice.I smile.Thanks.he replies.Let's have a look at you then shall we.Without putting me down, he carefully opens the back door of what I think is a jeep, and puts me on the back seat.He switches the overhead light on and looks at me.Jesus Christ, Ella!What have they done to you?I briefly look into the rear view mirror and shrug.Ive had worse.He goes to hug me and it makes me wince.Sorry.He whispers.He leaves me and goes into the trunk of his car to get something out.He slams the door shut and puts his bag down beside me.He scavenges through it and gets what looks like antiseptic wipes and a Band Aid.No Band Aid.I protest.Dont be silly, Ella, you're bleeding.He carefully wipes away the blood that has trickled down my face.It gives me another chance to study him.He is beautiful, definitely not someone who should think of me.His face is defined and completely perfect.His eyes a light friendly green with a dark deep green surrounding them.His hair sweeps them as he concentrates on cleaning me up.Thats twice now you have had to clean me up!I smile.Im rewarded with a smile that touches his eyes.Why did you want to see me?I whisper.His eyes lock onto mine and he breaks the contact to reach for another wipe.I wanted to see you, Ella.I needed to see you.Why?I ask and my body shudders.Are you cold?He asks.Sort of, adrenaline I think.I shrug.I think we should leave your car here tonight, Ill get someone to come pick it up in the morning for you.He demands.I need it to get to school.I can drive, Ill be fine.I protest.No, Ella.Tell you what, how about I come pick you up around six am and we can go get it, yeah?I nod and throw him a smile.Six am huh?I may be hard to handle.I wink at him.Me too!he jokes.He then secures the Band Aid over the cut on my forehead, I wince, but when its secured, he kisses it.Now, are we going to get down to why I was attacked?I snap.Whoa, Ella, chill out.He raises his hands in protest.Sorry I whisper.Why did she tell me to stay away from you?Following in her words, that shell kill me.She said that?He whispers, sounding mortified.Ella  he pauses and swallows.This obviously is something personal to him.I have to tell you because she hurt you, which as a matter of fact, she had no fucking right to do.But its entirely my fault.I think it was a girl named Sarah.She was my ex girlfriend.Well, is my ex girlfriend.She never targeted Jenna because Jenna is popular.She must have found out about you through the Internet.You are an easy target, Ella.He is studying my face for a reaction but Im calm, blunt, and stunned.The pain is still radiating in my head and a headache has swept through.I rub my forehead with my hand and accidentally rub my cut.Shit, that hurt.Shes mental, Ella.When I finished with her, she stormed into my house and destroyed my room.All my clothes were cut and all my stuff smashed.Shes been trying to get me back for at least a year.Im not interested in her.I never was really.She tried to force me to have sex with her, forced me to take her on dates.She made me tell everyone I knew that she was my girlfriend and that I loved her.She was messed up then.Shes even more messed up now.So, she wants to hurt me, to get to you?How would she know where I was?Why would she have a gang with her?This makes no sense, Luke.My voice becomes a fraction of a whisper.I thought it was Jenna, I was terrified.I look down at my knotted fingers and he comes to sit next to me.I move over to the other seat and look out the window.He shuts the door and the car spirals into complete darkness.Im so sorry, Ella, I dont know what to say.I needed to see you, to hear you, to be close to you, and I find you here like this, attacked, and its my fault.It kills me.Im going to be brutally honest, Ella. "He sighs and closes his eyes.Reopening them, he continues."There is this attraction I feel with you.
