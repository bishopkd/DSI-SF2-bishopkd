Wrapping his arms around her from behind, he pulled her back against him.His palms rubbed her bare skin, and he rocked her.He wanted to ask her again why Kyle was harassing her, but by the quake of her body, he didnt think shed be up for talking yet.It killed him that this strong, beautiful woman didnt feel like she had anyone she could turn to.Nobody to keep her safe.But it wasnt true.And he wished he was the kind of guy to tell her that.That he could be open about what he was feeling, but he wasnt very good with words.He was the thug, the tough guy who used violence to get his point across.Apparently, he hadnt changed as much as hed thought.Hed lost his head over a threat to his woman, and hed dealt with it the only way he knew how.You just called her your woman.Deep down, it was how he felt.Like she belonged to him.Like she needed him.And he wanted her to need him.Its okay.Youre safe.Youre all right, he said, holding her a little tighter.I told you not to get involved, she whimpered, her hands gripping his forearm as she tried to turn around.He loosened his hold enough to let her, and when she faced him, he was surprised by her dark scowl.That guy assaulted you, Gabe said.And Im still standing.Believe me, hes done worse.But the things he could do to you ...Gabe, do you really want to go back to prison?That punk is a fucking pussy, Gabe said, dropping his arms from around her waist.Hes not going to do shit to me.You dont know what hes capable of, especially when someone humiliates him, Caroline said, taking his hand and bringing his bruised knuckles to her mouth.He caught his breath at the gentle brush of her lips, his heart hammering.Trying to play it cool, he used his other hand to tilt her chin up, and he studied her face.You trying to say you care about me, Caroline?She tried to look away, but he wouldnt let her.Answer me.I think youre an idiot whos going to get hurt if he keeps getting involved in my problems, she snapped.Hey, he said, releasing her as she struggled.Im a big boy.I can handle it.I dont need you to fight my battles for me, she said, pushing him all the way back.I was handling my own shit just fine before you came along, so dont think youre going to come in here on a white horse and save me.Is that your plan?To make me indebted to you?Gabe tightened his fists, his muscles aching with rage.Forgive me, princess.I promise, its the last time I get involved in your drama.Good.Thats all I want!Without saying anything else, he grabbed his jacket and slammed out the door.Fuck her.If she didnt know the difference between someone stepping up because he cared and someone trying to get something from her, then she was more damaged than he was.Taking off down the street on foot, he headed toward Chases tattoo parlor with his mind racing.What the hell was going on with her?Something had happened to her, and that bastard Kyle was involved in it.Was he blackmailing her?Did she owe him money or something?It seemed unlikely, but what else could it be?Maybe he was a lawyer.Had he helped her cover up a crime or just gotten her charges dropped?Had the charges been buried in exchange for ...what?Maybe youve just been watching too many procedural cop dramas.As he opened up the door to Jagged Rock Tattoo Parlor, he saw Chase inside, sitting down with Eric, the bartender.Hey, man, sorry to interrupt.Naw, we were just shooting the shit, Chase said.Eric, have you met Gabe?We grew up together.Not officially, Eric said, holding out his hand.Youre the guy living with Caroline Willis, right?Gabe didnt correct him that they werent living together, still remembering the too familiar way Eric had kissed Caroline.Yeah.Shes a good kid, Eric said, squeezing Gabes hand hard enough to be painful.Shes not a kid, Gabe said, returning the grip.The silence stretched as the two men sized each other up, and it was Chase who finally broke the tension.Whoa, are you two about to throw down or kiss?Both of them swung around to face Chase, yelling, What the fuck are you talking about?Chase laughed.You both looked intense.I was just trying to lighten the mood.Eric was the first to speak.Im just looking out for her.Well, good luck with that, because she doesnt need that from anyone, according to her, Gabe said bitterly.Eric seemed to be fighting a smile.Yeah, why do you think she got the nickname Trouble?The tension eased out of Gabes shoulders.So, you two never ...Hell no.Like I said, sweet kid, but have you met her daddy?Eric shook his head as he let out a whistle.Lets just say, even if I had been interested, working for her daddy dissuaded me from any future plans.Gabe walked over to one of the tattoo chairs and sat.Tell me about him.GABE RETURNED TO the apartment two hours later and, thanks to his new bartender friend, knew a lot more about Carolines father than when hed walked in.Eric had had a lot to say about the former Rock Canyon mayor, Edward Willis, and the way he treated his three daughtersand none of it was good.After hearing about what a control freak her father waswhen he wasnt tearing the girls down for every infraction, that ishe could understand why Caroline had a hard time accepting help.It seemed like everything her father had given them had come with a stipulation.Flopping down on the couch, he turned on the TV, but before hed even made it through the beginning credits of Turner and Hooch, he was asleep.Suddenly, he sat bolt upright.At first, he wasnt sure what had woken him, but then he heard Caroline screaming.Jumping up from the couch, his heart hammered in his ears as he burst through her door.He flipped on the light, ready to grab her attacker, but there was no one therejust Caroline thrashing on the bed, still asleep.Relief swept through him.Hed thought there was someone attacking her, but she was just having a nightmare.He took her by the shoulders, gently shaking her.Caroline ...She thrashed harder, whimpering, Stop ...please.Caroline, its me.Its Gabe, he said.Come on, baby, stop.Wake up.Its just a dream.She came to slowly, blinking up at him and then throwing her hands over her eyes to block the light.Gabe?Yeah, you okay?he asked.Can you turn off the light?Sure, he said, getting up to flip the switch before coming back to her side.Taking her hand, he added, Seemed like some dream.Yeah, she whispered.It was.Neither one of them said anything for a minute or two, and Gabe released her hand, figuring shed fallen back asleep.But when he started to rise from the bed, she grabbed his hand.Stay with me ...please?He sat back down and said, Are you sure?Not for ...I dont want that, she said softly.I just dont want to be alone.Climbing in with her, he lay down on his back and smiled as she snuggled into him, her cheek pressing against his chest.As he stroked her back, he waited for her to say more, and when she didnt, he said, I know you say you dont need anybody, and I believe you.You are one tough woman, and I respect that.But Im here if you change your mind.Okay?Seconds ticked by before she answered him.Thanks, Gabe.Gabe brushed her hair back with one hand as he pulled her closer with the other.After several minutes of quiet, Carolines breathing evened out, and her body relaxed.Once he was sure she was asleep, Gabe slipped out of her bed and headed for his own, a volcano of thoughts erupting inside: Carolines anger at him for having Kirsten stay over, how shed accused him of taking advantage of her, Carolines reaction after his kiss.The nightmare ...Gabe didnt want to even think it, but it made a lot of sense.Especially her fear of that bastard, Kyle.But if Caroline had been raped by himwhen had it happened?And why hadnt she reported it?Shed said the man whod assaulted her in the alley had worked for her father.Is that why she hadnt told?Because shed thought her dad wouldnt believe her?But then why was Kyle stalking her now?Had she finally threatened to expose him after all this time?So many unanswered questions, but one thought outweighed all the worries.Despite her protests, Caroline did need someone.And Gabe was determined to show her that someone was him.Nineteen Anyone who says he or she has never experienced the walk of shame was just never caught sneaking out.Miss Know It All   GABE WAS STILL kicking his own ass on Friday as he closed up the shop.He had received the last of the tools he needed and would be ready to open in a couple of weeks, as long as he had customers.So far, things were looking pretty slow for custom bikes in Rock Canyon.But it wasnt the lack of orders that was eating at himit was Caroline.Slamming his helmet into the front door of the shop, he cursed.There were too many unanswered questions, and he wasnt even sure he had a right to ask them.Since Sunday, Caroline had been pleasant with him, but that was as far as it went.They hadnt talked about the sex or the fight with Kyle, and it had put Gabe in a fucked up mood all week.Chase had given him hell on Wednesday for being a dick, telling him he needed to get laid, and hed just about thrown his friend across the room, hed been so on edge.Damn it, it was bad enough that he couldnt get the feel and taste of her out of his head, but the knowledge that she slept down the hall had him in a constant state of arousal.The smell of the bathroom after her shower, the sound of her sweet talking the kittens, and fuck, even the brief glance shed given him when she came home last night had kept him up, imagining those dark eyes lit with pleasure as he rose above her, riding her body.God, he needed a drink and something to get his mind off of her.He headed over to where his bike was parked, and after securing his helmet, he took off toward Bucks, hoping to engage someone in a not so friendly game of pool.It took him less than ten minutes to travel across town, but when he pulled into the parking lot, there wasnt a spot left, the place was so packed.Pulling up alongside the wood building, he took off his helmet and called out to a couple of women walking past.Hey, why is the place so busy?Ladies night!the girls squealed together, giggling as they walked inside.Ah, hell, he said, swinging off his bike.At the door, he looked inside at the wall of people, mostly women, dancing and laughing.Men were stationed around the perimeter, watching.You heading in, man?Gabe hadnt even noticed the tall burly kid hanging by the door.Should I?The kid grinned, and Gabe realized he was probably in his late twenties, just with one of those youthful faces.Thats up to you, but Ive seen some fine looking women pass by.Shit, thats all I need, Gabe muttered as he stepped inside.The last thing on his mind was adding another woman to his plate, especially when not one of the chicks hed met since moving here held a candle to Caroline.There was a DJ playing Katy Perry on the stage, and the tables had been pushed to the edge to make more room on the dance floor.As Gabe walked toward the bar, he caught sight of Caroline behind it and stopped, surprised to see her there.He hadnt known what her plans were for tonight, but he hadnt expected her here.Yet there she was, whispering back and forth with the big bartender, Eric, who Chase had introduced him to last week.Remembering the kiss between the two, Gabe clenched his fists involuntarily.It was too bad; if it hadnt been for Erics interest in Caroline, Gabe might have liked the guy.Pushing his way up to the bar, he called out, Hey, can I get a beer?Caroline looked his way and had the fucking nerve to give him a polite smile, like he was the fucking postman.Like there was nothing between them.Like hed never seen her naked and writhing.Eric glanced his way, a wide grin spreading across his face.Hey, Moriarty.Nice of you to drop in for our first official ladies night.Eric popped the top on a bottle and handed it to him.With his eyes on Caroline, who was looking toward the stage, Gabe said, Wouldnt miss it.Eric, as if picking up on the tension, squeezed Carolines shoulder as he took off toward the back.Okay, well, Im gonna get some more bottles from the stockroom.Great job, Trouble.Gabe flexed his fist and resisted the urge to plant it in Erics face.The guy was a little too free with his hands, even if he swore he had no designs on Caroline.Alone together for the first time in almost a weekexcept for the hundreds of bodies surrounding themGabe said, Seems like you two are awfully friendly.Hes an old friend of the family.Of course he is.Thats why he has a pet name for you and everything, he said, sarcasm dripping heavily from his tone.She leaned over the bar until they were only a few inches apart, and his eyes drifted down to appreciate the low cut neckline of her shirt.Are you jealous?she asked, quietly enough that he was the only one who heard.No, just making an observation.Right, she said and started to pull back, but he grabbed her arm in a flash, keeping her close.Her large eyes widened, and those lush lips parted invitingly.He ran his thumb across the bare skin of her arm, pleased with the goosebumps that rose in response, and she sucked in a breath sharply.He tried fighting a cocky grin but failed; as much as she tried to deny it, she was just as affected by him as he was by her.I think we need to talk, to clear the air, he said.Seeming to have recovered, she said, Im good.Apologies dont come easy to me.You call that an apology?Can I finish?he asked, exasperated.By all means, she said, waving her hand in front of her like a queen.Satisfied that she would keep quiet for a minute, he released her arm.Im sorry about the way I acted after we ...well, had sex.Intimacy is not my strong suit.She looked away from him, brushing her hair off her forehead as she nodded.Yeah, its not exactly mine either.Does that mean we have something in common?he asked playfully.Oh, the horror.He shook his head, choking on a laugh.Man, he liked this woman.She was smart and fiery, funny and so damn sexy in her simple navy dress that he had a hard time not coming over the bar and kissing her senseless.Yeah, well, I was hoping we could call a truce.Living together is hard enough without feeling like we have to avoid each other.I know you want me to stay out of your business, and Ive tried, but its stupid to walk around pretending we hardly know each other, he said, adding wickedly.Especially since that couldnt be further from the truth.Parts of you I know ...intimately.And just when I thought you had an ounce of maturity, she said, trying to step back, but he reached out to touch her hand.Im sorry; its a habit.Ill try to act like a grown ass man, if youll stop pretending Im some strange acquaintance that you have to run from whenever you see me.A moment passed before she reached back into the fridge and pulled out a beer.We could try that, she said, popping the top and tapping it against his.To behaving like adults.She tipped the beer back, and her dark hair fell over her shoulder, exposing the clean column of her throat.Gabes mind flashed back to kissing her soft skin.Yeah, yay for maturity.What was that?she asked.Nothing.CAROLINE TRIED TO ignore Gabes gaze on her while she danced with Gemma, Gracie, and Callie, but just knowing he was watching had her on high alert.She kept swaying her hips slowly, dipping and turning.Lifting her hair up in a move shed used hundreds of times to get a guys attention, she glanced back at him to see if it worked.Score one for Caroline.He was watching her, all right, and the expression on his face was heavy with need.So much for being mature.Youre teasing the hell out of the man.She couldnt seem to help it.She was fascinated by himand not just by his body or the things hed done to her on Sunday.He was a conundrum, made up of a soft side he hardly ever showed and the snarky asshole that most of the world saw.Sure, most guys didnt like to show emotion or weaknesses to others, but Gabe had built the freaking Wall of China around himselfand she really wanted to chip away at it, brick by brick.Despite her insistence that he stay out of her business, there had been a small part of her that loved watching him beat the shit out of Kyle.Hell, who was she kidding?Shed wanted to jump in there with him and get a few kicks in herself, but she knew the score.Kyle wouldnt hesitate to lash out at Gabe, especially if he thought Gabe meant something to her.After all, she had been the one to rock his perfect boat by coming back to Rock Canyon.Why wouldnt he try to take away the man she was living with?Someone she cared about?Of course, Kyle didnt know the truth, that Gabe and she were just roommates.But is that really the truth?You know theres more to it now.It didnt matter that shed been trying to convince herself all week that she didnt care.The thought of Kyle hurting him made her physically ill.In the end, she realized shed do whatever it took to make sure Kyle didnt go after Gabe.Even if it meant staying away from him.The other part of her, the weak part, had been tempted too many times this week to confide in Gabe about Kyle and why he was targeting her.To lean on him and his strength, but shed told him she didnt need him.That she could handle her life on her own, and she could.But sometimes, she really didnt want to.And for some crazy reason, she felt like Gabe could be trusted.He had scarsjust like her, that was for damn surebut it was the sensitivity he kept under wraps that really softened her toward him.Like when shed come home from her sisters house yesterday and found him on the floor, playing with Googlie and Possum, rubbing their stomachs and growling, You think youre so tough?It had been so damn adorable, and shed hated that hed stopped when he noticed her.It had been on the tip of her tongue to tell him everything then, to sink to the floor and let him hold her as she confessed all.But then the insecurities had surfaced.Would he think less of her?He saw her as strong now, but if she admitted how vulnerable she really was, would he see her as a victim?Or would he lose his cool and go after Kyle?Hed end up back in prison, and shed end up exactly where shed always been.Alone.Who are you making cow eyes at?Gracie asked as she shimmied, pulling Caroline back to the present.Me?Caroline said innocently.No one.I call bullshit!Gemma said, giggling.Caroline had learned that Gemma was kind of a lightweight and tended to giggle when she got tipsy.Lets see, Gracie said, tapping a nail on her ruby red lips.If I had to take a stab at it, Id say its ...the hot roommate?Or Eric, Callie said, a wicked grin on her face.Caroline was pretty much in love with her new friend, who had a sharp tongue and quick wit beneath her quiet exterior.Gracie shot Callie a glare.Caroline smothered a laugh.Its not Eric.Believe me, hes all yours.Gracie blushed.I dont want him.Which is why any time another woman even glances at him, you look like youre about to Hulk out, Gemma said, earning her own glare.Before Gracie could open fire on her bestie, Wayne Coulter sidled up next to them.Good evening, ladies.They all made disgusted faces, and Gracie snapped, What do you want, Wayne?I was seeing if I could buy you ladies a round, and maybe my brother and I could join you, Wayne said, ignoring Gracies tone and making no attempt to hide his eyeing Gemma and Carolines chests.No one wants to have a drink with you, Gracie said.Youre an asshole, and you smell like moldy cheese.Gemma smothered a giggle, while Caroline watched Waynes expression twist into an ugly mask of rage.You think youre so hot, that youre too fucking good for us?Please, a sheep is too good for you, Gracie said, and Caroline inched closer to her, waiting for Wayne to either make a move or take off.Wayne took a step toward Gracie, fist clenched.Bitch, someone shoulda taught you when to shut up.Caroline pushed the petite blonde behind her and, closing her eyes, waited for the pain.It wasnt the first time shed been hit, but when the blow never came, she opened her eyes, her mouth dropping open in surprise.Wayne was flat on his back, and Callie was standing over him, her legs bent in a fighting stance.She heard a scuffle to her right and turned in time to see Gabe put a struggling Walt on the ground, placing his knee over Walts throat as he shouted, Simmer down!What in the Sam Hill?Eric yelled over the music as the crowd parted.Caroline was sure Eric was going to kick them out, but his gaze sought Gracie, a scowl screwing up his handsome face.Then suddenly, his anger shifted to the Coulters, and he said, This is the last time, Wayne.You and your brother get the fuck out of my bar.This crazy bitch assaulted me, and youre kicking us out?Wayne shouted as he climbed to his feet.Caroline reached out and pulled Callie back, wrapping her arm around the womans shoulders.She could feel Callies trembles and rubbed her hand over her arm.Its okay, Caroline whispered so only she could hear.Im sure you gave her a reason, Eric said coldly.Ive warned you again and againyou start shit in here, you find another place to patronize.Gabe, I think you can get off him.Gabe stood up and stepped back toward Caroline and the rest of the women.The way Walt was rubbing his neck, she figured Gabe hadnt been gentle, and it gave her a little thrill that he was on their side.Come on, Eric, we were just offering to buy them a round of drinks, and Gracie insulted us, Walt protested.I dont care what she did.Every week Ive got to deal with some shit you start in my bar, and Im fucking tired of it.Now get out, or Im calling the cops.The two men stared Eric down before they started walking.As they passed by, Wayne shot Gracie and Callie a killer glare.See you around, sweethearts, Wayne said, sneering.Move!Erics bark propelled them a little faster.Caroline still had ahold of Callie, and when Eric turned his attention back to them, Callies quaking intensified.Okay, Eric, tone it down a notch, Caroline said, squeezing Callie to her side.When we told them we werent interested, Wayne acted like he was going to hit Gracie, and Wait ...Did he touch you?Eric asked Gracie.His whole demeanor, from the clenched fists to the snarl, said he was ready to pound someone.Oh yeah, theres nothing going on between those two.Nope.No, Caroline and Callie had my back.He raised his hand up like he was going to, but Callie took him down faster than any of us could blink, Gracie said, waving Caroline off so she could take Callies shoulders.You have to teach me how to do that.Are you okay?Gabes question startled Caroline.He was standing right next to her, but she had been so distracted by Callies distress that she hadnt sensed him.Looking up into his concerned face now, she had the strange desire to throw herself into his arms and let him comfort her.Im okay, although I think the funs kinda been sucked out of the evening, Caroline said.Why dont I take you home?he suggested.Her heart rate went from zero to sixty in two seconds flat.Actually, I drove Callie, so I have to take her home first.I can get a ride with Gemma and Gracie, Callie offered, and Caroline turned to look at her, relieved that shed stopped shaking.Are you sure?Caroline asked, noting the small smile Callie gave Gabe.Yeah, you should let him drive you.I still have my car, Caroline said, getting the feeling that Callie was setting her up.Then Ill just see you there, Gabe said, brushing against her as he passed.She turned to watch him slip through the crowd and licked her lips as those wide shoulders disappeared outside.He wants you bad, Callie said, beside her.Caroline gave her a sheepish look.Yeah, well, the feeling is kind of mutual.I knew it, Gracie said, coming up behind them.Lets bail, before Eric starts yelling at me again.I dont know why he always starts shit with me.Im a fucking ball of sunshine.I think the best way to get Eric into a good mood is for Gracie to Gemma!Gemma giggled and headed for the door as the three of them followed behind.BACK IN THE apartment, Gabe was on the couch, waiting for Caroline to walk through the door.When hed seen Wayne Coulter raise his arm and Caroline step in front of Gracie, his whole body had shut down for a split second before adrenaline rushed through him, propelling him out of his seat.By the time hed reached them, the blonde girlCalliehad knocked Wayne off his feet with a sweeper kick, and Walt was about to jump in.Hed caught Walt around the neck and slammed him to the floor.All hed wanted was to keep the son of a bitch as far away from Caroline as he could.Just then, the lock turned in the door, and Gabe got off the couch, facing Caroline as she came in.Hi, she said.Hey.She shut the door, turning the lock with a click and walked along the length of the couch.So, you took down Walt pretty fast.Yeah?Because you were watching me?Uh huh.Before he could blink, she grabbed the hem of her dress and pulled it up and over her head.Do I still have your attention?He came around the couch in three strides, catching the back of her head in his hands.Dropping his mouth to hers, he took those soft lips in a hard, hungry kiss, pulling back just enough to whisper, Undivided.Her hushed laugh was cut short as he claimed her mouth again, backing her toward the hallway.With every step, another article of clothing dropped to the floor, like a trail of bread crumbs, but when Gabe hit the wall with his elbow, he broke away to curse.Watch where youre going, slick, she said, pushing him against the wall and cupping his cock through his boxer briefs.Sucking in air through his teeth, Gabe wrapped his arm around her waist and brought her flush against his body.All night hed been watching her body move, and it had been impossible not to remember how it had felt to be connected to her, moving inside her body.Before the fight had ensued, hed been tempted to get up and dance with her, if only to stop the teasing looks shed been throwing his way.With her hand trapped between them, teasing his length, he trailed his hand over her hip and beneath the scrap of lace covering her.She liked to be in control, to drive him to distraction, but she needed to learn that when it came to sex, he was the boss.When his finger found her, he rubbed between her lips and circled her clit, enjoying her little gasp.Speaking of slick ...God, she said hoarsely, reaching up to grab the back of his neck, trying to pull him down for a kiss.You always have to have the last word.He dipped his mouth to hers, nipping and sucking on her lips as he stroked her.Her breathing hitched, and one of her legs came up, trying to hook around his hip.Her little groan of frustration was damn hot; he loved the way she didnt hold back what she wanted or needed from him.If she wanted to be closer, he could help her with that.Gabe grabbed her thighs and lifted her easily, carrying her the last few steps to his bedroom.As they came through the open door, he noticed Googlie and Possum sleeping on the bed.Shit, we have company.She looked over her shoulder at the sleeping kittens.We could go to my room.He did an about face, mumbling about damn cats, and headed back down the hallway to her room.As he reached her cracked door, he forgot everything else but the feeling of her mouth on his neck, sucking hard before dragging her teeth across the wet spot.Youre gonna kill me, he said.Dont worry; youll like it, she teased, running her nails across his back hard enough to bring a growl of pleasure from him.Once inside the room, Gabe dropped her to her feet.Turn around.She did as he asked, and he slid his hand up her back, unclasping her bra.The smooth skin of her back drew him to kiss his way up her spine.As he slid the straps off her shoulders and down her arms, he flung the lacy lingerie across the room before clasping her breasts in his hands.Squeezing her and massaging them, he pulled her back against him, nuzzling her neck as he rubbed his cock against her ass.Slowly, she reached back and wound her arms around his neck as he tweaked her nipples, pulling and pinching them into hard nubs that left her arching and gasping.He wanted her, to be inside her and make her scream; there was no question.But more than that, he didnt want her to ever forget what was between them.Because no matter how hard hed tried to convince himself that she deserved better, he couldnt leave her alone now.She was his.Bend over the bed.She didnt argue as he slid the lacy thong down her legs.She stepped out of it, one delicate foot at a time, while he ran his palm over her plump rear in awe.Spread your legs, princess, he said, the nickname rolling off his tongue sweetly.There was no mocking this time; he meant it.He wanted to worship at her feet and treat her like she was nothing less than royalty.Shit, I need a condom, he muttered, as his fingers slipped inside her, her hot, tight channel squeezing him.Mmm, nightstand drawer, she said breathlessly.He grinned and kissed his way down her back as his hand worked her.I love that youre prepared.Well, Id love it if you wouldoh!His wet fingers had moved up to her clit, pressing into the tight little nub with fast, circular motions, playing with her flesh until she was quivering, and he felt her muscles spasm.Oh, God, Im ...Im gonna ...She screamed his name as she came, and he kept her riding the wave until her body relaxed under him.Swiftly reaching into the drawer, he pulled out a condom.Once he was sheathed, he gripped her hips and angled himself.Thrusting hard, he watched her hands grip the comforter in the dim light as he pulled out, heard her breathy moan as he went back in high and came out low.Then he stopped thinking about anything but the softness of her skin beneath his calloused hands and the way her channel squeezed him as he moved within her, and he realized he didnt want to stop, didnt want her to come up from this and tell him it was another fling, just a release or that it meant nothing.Hed never wanted a woman this way, and damn it, he wanted her to crave him.To want only him.Gabe took her hair gently in one hand and tugged lightly.Taking her from behind had just happened, but as she lifted up off the bed, the angle changed, sending him deeper.Shaking and fighting his desire to move inside her, he pressed his mouth against her ear.Do you like this?Yes ...Say you want me.I do.God, dont stop ...My name.Tell me you want me.He noticed her body stiffen for a split second, but it was so brief, he wondered if hed imagined it.He took her earlobe between his teeth, and she moaned.Caroline.I want to hear you say my name.She turned her face to the side so she could look back at him.Their gazes held in the twilight, and then she turned, breaking the connection of their bodies to wrap her arms around his neck.When she pushed at the back of his neck, he let her bring his mouth down to meet hers.The kiss was wet, messy, and damn, he loved it.Against his mouth, she whispered, I want you, Gabriel.CAROLINE PROTESTED AS Gabe pulled away from her.Dont go His dark eyes were so intense that her stomach twisted up.I want to watch your face as you come.Hotter words had never been spoken and despite his demanding, say my name bedroom manner, she had to admit it turned her on.Usually, she wore the pants in the bedroomtaking the lead and offering suggestionsbut damn, Gabe didnt need any help getting her off.As he laid her back on the bed, she arched up, waiting for him to cover her with that big, hard body, but he hovered above her on his hands.When she opened her eyes, she saw him watching her with a half smile on his lips.What?He lifted one hand to smooth it over her cheek but didnt answer.The moment was almost tender, and she swallowed back the panic.This was Gabe.Gabe, her savior.The man who played on the floor with four week old kittens and thrashed men who abused women.He was a good man, despite his protests.The look on his face wasnt what shed expected from the large, dark man, but she just kept telling herself there was nothing to be afraid of.She was safe with him.She placed her hands on his shoulders as he came down on his elbows and kissed her, stealing her breath and the last of her reservations.Gabes lips were like magic, sending tingles through her with every brush, and her arms wrapped around his neck, wanting to keep him there.He pulled back, and she lifted her hips to take him inside once more, an active participant as they moved together.Each time he thrust, the pressure built, and she held on tightly, chanting his name as pleasure erupted inside her.A few minutes later, he stiffened above her.When he came down on his elbows again, his lips buried themselves in the side of her neck and hair, his breath warming her as he tried to catch it.This was the moment she hated; usually, she wanted the man to just get up and go, so she could clean up and go to bed.Her first instinct was to tell him, Time to go, but the light kisses just under her ear were nice, relaxing her already liquid body as her eyes started to flutter shut.She didnt even realize he had moved off her until he was bringing the covers up over her, and she reached out sleepily for his hand.Stay.The brush of his mouth on her shoulder was the last thing she felt as she fell into a deep, dreamless sleep.Twenty There are some people who can forgive and forget ...and then theres the rest of us.Miss Know It All   SON OF A bitch!Gabe woke up to the sound of Carolines cursing in the kitchen and the smell of burning food.Groggily, he pushed himself up onto his arms and yelped as tiny claws dug into his back.Hed slept the whole night in her bed.A warmth of satisfaction spread through him as he remembered the aftermath of their lovemaking, Stay.Just like the night of her bad dream, he hadnt been able to resist her request.Hed lain back down after hed cleaned up and wrapped his arms around her waist.It wasnt that hed never slept with a woman before, but last night with Caroline had felt different.Because youve never felt this way about a woman before?He didnt want to examine that possibility; it was too soon.Just being with her and sharing that level of intimacy had allowed him to experience another emotion hed thought lost to him.Hope.Hope for a future with a woman who made him feel good about who he was.Who knew about his past and accepted him, not because she wanted to fix him, but because she saw something more.Turning slowly, he felt the kittens slide farther beneath him, and he sat up, twisting to look at the two furballs blinking up at him grumpily.Little shits, whats your problem?You clawed the hell out of my back.Googlie was the first one to stretch and pad toward him, rubbing against his arm.Gabe had never been much of a cat person, but damn if these ones hadnt gotten him, hook, line, and sinker.Kind of like their mama.Damn, damn, double damn!Caroline shouted beyond the closed door.Grabbing his boxer briefs, he pulled them into place and walked into the kitchen.Caroline was standing in her robe with her back to him, in front of the stove, her long hair on top of her head in a messy bun.He came up behind her and looked down at a charred, smoking rectangle on the counter.If you were making me breakfast, I guess its the thought that counts.She jumped and turned so that their bodies were mere inches apart.Gabe loved that she seemed nervous.Its Valeries birthday, and Im in charge of the cake.But it seems like my culinary skills come only in the form of microwavable dinners and boiled pasta.Why dont you pick one up at Halls?he asked.She threw her hands up.Exactly, right?But no, Ellie said it had to be this rainbow chip crap, and Vals party is tonight, and And it only takes about an hour to bake, two to cool, and fifteen minutes to ice it, he said and then shrugged at her shocked expression.What?My mom worked a lot, and when she wasnt working, she was gambling.What about you and your sister?Caroline asked, her dark eyes shining with sympathy, but he didnt want her to feel sorry for him.He understood why she would, but there was nothing that pity could change about his past.So hed had a shitty parenta lot of people did.Those were just the cards hed been dealt.Still, he could remember his public defender planning his defense and telling him that it wasnt his fault.A lot of kids who got into drugs and alcohol were raised by abusive, single parents.If his arm hadnt been broken in the accident, he probably would have decked the guy for assuming shit.It didnt matter that his mother had been abusive as hell and just plain mean.It had been on him to protect Honey, and hed failed her, time and again.Honey and I were usually on our own unless Mom had enough for a sitter, which wasnt often.We were usually the last on her priority list, so I learned to cook dinners and make birthday cakes for my sister and me.We never really had parties, but at least we had cake.She took his hand and squeezed it.Im sorry.Again, with the sympathy; he tried to be gentle, but his reply probably came off sharper than he meant.Dont be; we had fun.Then, remembering, he added, We used to make each other homemade gifts, but this one Christmas, Honey wanted this doll at the mall.I had almost saved up enough for it, but my mom found my coffee can and took everything I had.So Christmas Eve, I went into the store and tried to sneak it out in my backpack.He didnt know why he was telling her this story; as a kid, it had been terrifying.Hed almost made it out the door and onto the street when the sales clerk had grabbed him.Would Caroline consider his early shoplifting a prelude to his ending up in prison?He didnt think of it that way, but he could see why she would.He just thought back on that memory as a time when hed tried to give Honey everything she deserved.After all, it wasnt her fault shed been born to a loser of a mother.And as for him, well, he wasnt a gem either.Honey had deserved better than both of them.Damn it.His eyes were starting to sting, and he coughed to hide the emotion this story roused in him.He felt her squeeze his hand and step closer, her warmth comforting him.You dont have to tell me.Ah, its fine.I just had a tickle in my throat.Okay, she said, releasing his hand to wrap her arms around his waist.Go on, then.Gabe could tell Caroline wasnt buying his throat clearing but appreciated that she didnt tease him about it.Lord knew this was the only time hed ever told this story to anyone besides Chase, and if she teased him, well, he wouldnt be able to take it.Isnt that why youre telling her, though?Because deep down, you know you can trust her with your past and your baggage?It was true.Despite their rough start, Caroline was the most understanding woman hed ever met, and he knew she wouldnt judge him for his mistakes.Realizing she was poking his back for him to continue, he said, Anyway, that was the first time I got arrested.I felt like shit, especially when my mom showed up and started screaming at me about having to quit during her winning streak.Then I got pissed, and told her if she hadnt stolen all the money Id earned, I wouldnt have had to steal.I called her a thief in front of the whole police department, and she slapped me.Oh my God, thats awful, Caroline said, pulling far enough away to look up at him, her expression appalled.They didnt let you go home with her, did they?One of the officers stepped in and threatened to arrest her.She started crying and apologizing, giving him a sob story about raising the two of us all alone and that it would never happen again.She was just emotional.The officer was an older guy who bought her shit and started talking about how he had three teenagers.His advice to her was to let him drive her home, since she was obviously distraught.I cant believe no one did anything!Caroline said furiously.They should have taken her into custody, and It was a small town during the holidays, Gabe broke in, rubbing her back to calm her down, although he was secretly pleased that she was angry on his behalf.Made him think that maybe she cared a little.Im sorry, but I think its ridiculous that no one protected you from her, Caroline said, adding weight to his suspicion.Though really, it wasnt just that he wanted her to care but that he wanted to believe there could be something between them.If sharing a painful part of his childhood could show her he was trying, it was worth opening up old wounds.Especially when she looked so adorably ferocious, ready to go back in time and challenge his mom.Without thinking, he leaned over and kissed her, softly.Just a brush of lips before he said, Maybe if there had been someone like you there, it might have gone differently, but there werent a lot of choices for us.They might have been able to put me with one of the families at church temporarily, but then I wouldnt have been home with Honey.Honestly, I thank God he didnt do that.I dont think Honey and I would have been any better off in the system, and I doubt if, once she lost us, my mother would have fought very hard to get us back.But shes your mother, Caroline protested.How could she not fight for her children?I couldnt do that.He shrugged.It turned out okay, actually.The next day, an officer and some woman showed up at our door.It turned out that one of the guys at the station had called child protective services after my mom slapped me.While my mom and the woman talked in the other room, the officer pulled out two packages and a stocking for each of us, filled with candy and toys.When my sister opened her gift, it was the doll shed wanted.Oh!What a wonderful man.Did child protective services ever come back?No, Gabe said, thinking back on what happened next with sadness.We were in good health, without a mark on us, and the house was clean, though mostly because Honey and I did all the housework.I guess she determined it was a one time deal, and there were other children at higher risk than us.Well, that was still nice of the officer to do that, Caroline said, squeezing him around the waist.Gabe tried for irony, but his tone sounded bitter, even to his ears.Yeah, except my mother took the toys and threw them in the Dumpster right after they left.Something about punishing us for causing her trouble and being greedy or some shit.It was hard not to think of that Christmas and want to smash his fist into something.Carolines face flushed.What a bitch!Gabe let loose with surprised laughter and hugged her.Thanks.Im sorry, but You dont have to apologize to me.I fully agree with you, he said, rubbing her back.We didnt have it as bad as some, but after Honeys accident, I wasnt there to protect her.Protect her from what?Your mother?Caroline said with disbelief.What did she do to her?He sighed and leaned back against the counter, bringing her with him and cradling her against his body.After the accident, my mother sued the hospital for malpractice when they missed a brain bleed on Honeys scans.She was awarded millions, and she was supposed to use it for Honeys medical expenses.But she didnt.It wasnt a question, and he gave her a sad smile.No, she didnt.She stuck Honey in a state hospital and blew through the money like crazy.By the time I got out and found out what was going on, maybe a couple hundred thousand were left.Oh my God.It was exactly what hed thought when hed found out what his mother had done, but had he been surprised?Not really.His mother was who she was, and it had never done him any good to expect more from her than the very least she could give.Yeah, never trust a gambler with a large sum of money, Gabe said, tryingbut failingto make light of one of the most difficult points of his life.I hired an attorney who was willing to work for a percentage and sued my mother for power of attorney for my sisters care and her settlement.We were in the middle of court proceedings when some junkie shot her for her purse in Reno.Shut up, Caroline said, searching his face.Are you kidding?Nope, he said, thinking back to that morning when the police had shown up at his apartment to give him the news.For the longest time, hed actually been ashamed that his first reaction at their news had been relief.Relief that his mom couldnt gamble away any more of Honeys money and that he might have a chance to recoup some of the money his mother had lost.Of course, hed never share that with Caroline.Some things were just better kept to oneself.And shed never changed her will from the time she had coffee cans buried in our backyard, so everything went to Honey and me.Right after the funeral, I sold everything she owned and put the money in an account for Honeys care that gains interest.Paid off the legal fees and found her a new facility in Colorado.We lived there for eight years, but it was too expensive for me to start up a new business, and thats what I wanted to do.So, thats why you moved here?But why here, of all places?she asked, playing with the fingers on his hand.The soft touches were innocent enough, but coming from her, his thoughts started to stray to other places her fingers could skim.Well, cause I didnt want to live in a place that got a lot of snow ever again, so Sun Valley was out, and because my best friend from high school lived here.Who is that?Chase Trepasso.
