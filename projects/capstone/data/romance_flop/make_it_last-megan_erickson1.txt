 HED BEEN HOME three weeks before he could no longer avoid this place.And the worst part was, it hadnt changed.Not one bit.Not the red pleather booths lining the walleven the corner one still had its trademark X in silver duct tape covering a wicked tear.Not the robins egg blue Formica countertops.Not the silver rotating stools at the counter.Not even the temperamental soft serve ice cream machine, which a waitress currently wrestled with while a salivating kid watched.Not the flickering PARADISE DINER sign out front, the second A blown out so it looked like PARDISE.Which wasnt far off in this western Maryland town where everyone blurred their syllables.Youre not from Pardise, are you?It was like hed pressed PAUSE while playing Utope, freezing every character in the game into status quo indefinitely.Cam Ruiz didnt know whether the static nature of this damn place was comforting or infuriating.Because all of it reminded him of her.Her little black apron covering little black shorts.Those damn wedge sandals that she said made her calves and ass look good so she got better tips.Her laugh when hed sit at the counter right before she got off her shift, sucking down a milk shake while she mopped up the spills, shooting him flirty smiles.Fuck, itd been four, going on five years now.Why couldnt he just forget?Now, he had chosen a booth he didnt think hed ever occupied back in high school, right near the front door.He sipped from his plastic cup of water and looked down at his watch, then at the door.There werent tons of places open at noon to eat, so when his friend and old college roommate, Max Payton, called and asked where to meet, Cam had frozen.Then his mom yelled, Pardise Diner!in the background.Max had heard, and the meeting location was decided.Through the dirty windows of the diner, Cam saw the rusted piece of crap truck Max drove rumble in.His friend hopped out of the truck, sunglasses in place as he squinted at the sign and then helped his girlfriend, Lea, hop down out of the passenger side.She looked good, her limp slight, her dark hair shining in the early June sun.Max held open the door and a bell tinkled overhead.Lea spotted Cam right away, and he stood so she could hug him.He greeted Max with a handshake and back slap.As they slid into the booth, Cam on one side and Max and Lea on the other, a commotion at the counter caught his attention.A squeak followed by harsh whispers.He turned his head and all he saw were the doors to the kitchen, swinging back and forth.He shrugged and turned back to his friends.Thanks for visiting me, he said.Max laid his arm behind Lea along the back of the booth.Wanted to see the town that raised the great Cam Ruiz.Cam rolled his eyes.Its definitely small, Lea said.But I like it.Very welcoming and homey.He guessed so, if moving back didnt make him feel like he was taking a step backward.Like a reset button wiping away the basic training for the Air National Guard, the weekends at drill, the three and a half years he busted his ass to graduate college early.A waitress hed never met came to take their orders, her eyes lingering a little long on Cam.Not in a flirty way, like he was used to.Plus she was probably his moms age and wore a wedding band.But she studied his face and his clothes and it made him uncomfortable.He wanted to ask if he had something on his face or in his teeth.After they ordered, Max turned to Cam.So hows your mom?She was the reason Cam had come back.The only reason hed return to Paradise.He shrugged.Shes all right.Shes got this thing ...called fibromyalgia.Basically, shes in a lot of pain.Its hard for her to keep a job.So shes out of one right now and shes collecting disability.He waved a hand toward the door of the diner.Not like there are tons of jobs around here for her to pick from anyway.The waitress delivered their drinks and when she walked away, Lea placed her hand on top of Cams where he twisted his straw wrapper in his fingers.Anything we can do to help while were here?Cam shook his head.Nah, its cool.I got a job and our rent is cheap.Max took a gulp of water and crushed ice between his molars.What job did ya get?Cam couldnt stop the growl in the back of his throat.He had a bachelors degree and he was a ...Bouncer.At a bar in town.Maxs eyes widened, but then his face quickly shuttered.Bet you squeeze into a black T shirt and let the tats peek out and all these rednecks scatter, huh?Cam laughed.I just started last week.Its mostly girls from the community college looking to dance and stuff.I even have this fancy machine I run their IDs through to make sure they arent fake.Why the hell didnt the bars at Bowler have that?Kat used her fake all the time.Max frowned.Until Alec shredded it.Lea snickered.Max threw back his head and laughed.Oh man.Apparently Kat and Alec are at her beach house with her family, and Alec is worried her brother is going to drown him in the ocean.Lea wrinkled her nose.Which is stupid because Marc likes Alec.Hes just being paranoid.The waitress delivered their food, and even the sound of the melamine plates sliding across the table as she announced the orders brought back memories.He picked at his bun while Max demolished a burger.In between bites, Max stole a handful of fries from Leas chicken salad sandwich.Seriously?Lea glared at him.You have your own.But yours taste better, Max said around a mouthful of fries.That doesnt make any sense, she grumbled.Dont make me kick your ass.He grinned.Maybe I want you to kick my ass.My favorite foreplay.Cam groaned.Thats enough, guys, Im going to lose my appetite.Neither looked apologetic.Cam ate his burger while he chatted with Max and Lea about their trip.They planned to head up into Pennsylvania and then Massachusetts.A road trip for just the two of them, since next year was going to be rough.Lea started a teaching job in the fall, and Max would be completing his last semester at Bowler University student teaching.Max picked up the tab, which made Cam bristle a little, but Max assured him it was just to thank him for taking them out in his hometown.Cam followed them out of the diner and Lea hugged him before climbing into Maxs truck.Max watched her through the windshield as she buckled her seat belt, then leaned a hand on his hood and turned to Cam.His eyes traveled over Cams shoulder to the diner and then squinted at the sparse traffic on the street.Finally his eyes met Cams.You sure this is what you need to be doing?No, he wasnt sure, but hed committed now, hadnt he?I need to help my mom with the bills.She worked two jobs when I was a kid, just to keep food on our table and a roof over our heads.What am I gonna do, leave her?Max ran his tongue over his teeth.You could have maybe gotten a job and sent money ...Cam shook his head.I thought about that, but ...I wanted to make sure she was okay.And I think shes glad that were getting some time together, you know?Max watched him for a minute, then gave a curt nod.He slapped Cam on the shoulder.All right, man.You need anything, you call me or Alec, all right?He wouldnt.Sure.Max got into his truck and pulled out onto Main Street.Cam sighed, feeling the weight of responsibility pressing down on his shoulders.But if he didnt help his mom, who would?He jingled his keys in his pocket and turned to walk toward his truck.It was nice of Max and Lea to visit him on their road trip.College had been some of the best years of his life.Great friends, fun parties, hot girls.But now it felt like a small blip, like a week vacation instead of three and a half years.And now he was right back where he started.As he walked by the alley beside the restaurant, something flickered out of the corner of his eye.He turned and spotted her legs first.One foot bent at the knee and braced on the brick wall, the other flat on the ground.Her head was bent, a curtain of hair blocking her face.But he knew those legs.He knew those hands.And he knew that hair, a light brown that held just a glint of strawberry in the sun.He knew by the end of August itd be lighter and redder and shed laugh about that time she put lemon juice in it.Itd backfired and turned her hair orange.The light flickered again but it was something weird and artificial, not like the menthols she had smoked.Back when he knew her.As she lowered her hand down to her side, he caught sight of the small white cylinder.It was an electronic cigarette.Shed quit.She raised her head then, like she knew someone watched her, and he wanted to keep walking, avoid this awkward moment.Avoid those eyes he didnt think hed ever see again and never thought hed wanted to see again.But now that his eyes locked on her hazel eyesthe ones he knew began as green on the outside of her iris and darkened to brown by the time they met her pupilhe couldnt look away.His boots wouldnt move.The small cigarette fell to the ground with a soft click and she straightened, both her feet on the ground.And that was when he noticed the wedge shoes.And the black apron.What was she doing here?Camilo.Other than his mom, she was the only one who used his full name.Hed heard her say it while laughing.Hed her moan it while he was inside her.Hed heard her sigh it with an eye roll when he made a bad joke.But hed never heard it the way she said it now, with a little bit of fear and anxiety and ...longing?He took a deep breath to steady his voice.Tatum.He hadnt spoken her name since that night Trevor called him and told him what she did.The night the future that hed set out for himself and for her completely changed course.Shed lost some weight in the four years since hed last seen her.Hed always loved her curves.She had it allthighs, ass and tits in abundance.Naked, she was a fucking vision.Damn it, he wasnt going there.But now her face looked thinner, her clothes hung a little loose and he didnt like this look as much.Not that she probably gave a fuck about his opinion anymore.She still had her gorgeous hair, pinned up halfway with a bump in front, and a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose and on her cheekbones.And she still wore her makeup exactly the samethickly mascaraed eyelashes, heavy eyeliner that stretched to a point on the outside of her eyes, like a modern day Audrey Hepburn.She was still beautiful.And she still took his breath away.And his heart felt like it was breaking all over again.And he hated her even more for that.Her eyes were wide.What are you doing here?Something in him bristled at that.Maybe it was because he didnt feel like he belonged here.But then, she didnt either.She never did.They never did.But there was no longer a they.I was hungry, he grunted.She pursed her lips and narrowed those hazel eyes.I mean, what are you doing here, in Paradise?He raised his eyebrows.Im not allowed back here or something?She took a deep breath.Can you stop getting defensive?I just wanted  What are you doing here?he countered.After she backed out of following him to Bowler University, hed heard shed gone to her second choice college in Pennsylvania.Shouldnt she be out of this town working a fancy job with her fancy new degree?But here she was, in that same damn apron.Why was she wearing that apron?Her posture deflated, and she fiddled with the hem of her shirt.Did you graduate?she asked, ignoring his question.He wanted to tell her it was none of her business, but instead, he nodded.Busted my ass to get out in three and a half years.He was in basic training the first semester.When she ...Nope, not going there either.She flinched ever so slightly, then rolled her lips between her teeth and nodded back, gaze drifting to the ground at her feet.Good, she whispered so softly, he barely heard her.Thats good.He stared at the top of her head.When he heard a soft sound and saw a jerk of her head, his heart lurched.All these years, and he still knew the quiet sounds of Tate crying.Maybe because he grew up with a single mom, womens emotions never scared him away.He didnt always care, but he wasnt one of those guys who panicked at the sight of tears.But he always cared about Tate crying.Always.He would place her head on his shoulder, where it fit just right, and hed run his fingers through her hair, massaging her scalp.Then hed retrieve the water and pain reliever because crying always gave her a headache.It was like his body had muscle memory, because every one screamed at him to move and cradle her.She was trying to keep it in, he could see it.Tate, he said, and her head shot up, eyes wide and wet.But he managed to hold firm.Because shed chosen this consequence the day she decided to sleep with another man.He gave her a quick two fingered salute.See you around.And then he walked away.2      TATE SCRUBBED THE counter with the damp rag.She was pretty sure there was a spot on the counter, but it was hard to tell with her eyes being all leaky and blurry and emotional and stuff.She huffed and leaned her head back.Deep breaths.In and out.In and out.Sometimes it felt like she hadnt taken a decent breath in four years.She blinked her eyes at the ceiling, steeling herself.Itd been a long time since she cried.Despite wanting to every night when she collapsed exhausted and heartbroken in her bed.But of course he had to come back.Waltzing down the street like he fucking owned it.Looking better than he ever did.Back when he was hers.Before she blew it.She willed the tears back and renewed her efforts scrubbing the countertop.Cam had always been attractive, but he always had this look about him, and she knew hed be downright gorgeous once he grew into his body.Shed been right.His hair was shorter nowmilitary shorterbut hed put his earrings back in his ears.He had those same dark eyes and beautiful skin.And now he had bigger muscles, and she swore she saw a tattoo peeking out of the sleeve of his T shirt.Probably his new girlfriends name or something.She was probably perfect.Did you just growl?Tate snapped her head up to see her coworker Anne.I didnt growl.Anne crossed her arms over her well endowed bosom.You growled at the countertop.Tate narrowed her eyes.You its defender or something?Anne reached over and gently plucked the rag from Tates hand.Tate blew a strand of hair out of her face and turned to fiddle with the soft serve machine.I saw him, Annes voice said softly behind her.And those three words, said with a mix of pity and something else, slammed into Tate like a sucker punch.Her hand slipped off the knob and cracked down on the old metal tray below the nozzles, taking a chunk out of her palm in the process.Shit!Pain radiated into her fingers and down her arm.She cradled her palm in her other hand and clutched it to her stomach, clenching her teeth, wishing this whole day would just fucking go away.Tate, for Gods sake!Anne tutted, tugging on her elbow until Tate relinquished her arm to the mother hen shed known and worked with at the diner since she was sixteen.Anne didnt say anything else to Tate, just picked up a clean rag and wrapped it around Tates hand while asking Margo to make sure the machine was clean of blood, before leading Tate to the break room.Tate pulled on her arm, but Anne held fast, shooting a stern look at Tate.Tate sighed.Whatever.She let Anne sit her down on the couch and clean the cut with hydrogen peroxide.After Anne bandaged it, she patted Tate on the shoulder.All right, well, well take it from here.Why dont you head home?Tate jerked her head.What?Why?Anne stood before her, hands on her ample hips, and purposefully looked at Tates bandaged hand, currently lax in her lap.Oh this?Tate said, holding up her hand.Just a flesh wound.Tate.Anne.Go home.And sit around the house with her sick father and her old memories?No thank you.I need the money.That, too.Anne pursed her lips.Youll get paid for the full shift  But I didnt  Tate, if you dont go home right now, I swear to God, Ill put you over my knee!Tate widened her eyes, because Anne looked so serious.And frankly, even though Anne had seventy five pounds on her, Tate made up for her small size with scrappiness.Shed really love to see Anne try to spank her.She began to giggle.Which made Anne glare harder.Then Tate was laughing, big heaving chuckles, while Anne shook her head, smiling slightly.Tate finally calmed and wiped her hands over her eyes.Thanks for that visual, Mama Bear.Anne sighed.I love you, Tate.Tate ducked her head and dug her fingernail along the edge of the bandage on her hand.I know.Quit picking at it.Tate rolled her eyes.Im twenty three, you know.Youll always be sixteen to me.Annes smile faded, her eyes softening.Tate looked away, staring at the calendar on the wall.It was June now.The calendar needed to be changed from May.The calendar was full of drawings of cats in yoga positions.The cat had its paws above its head, one leg bent at knee, foot flat on the other inner thigh.Who thought of calendars like this?Do you want to talk about it?Anne asked softly.Tate wished Anne was asking about her hand, or even the stupid cat calendar, but Tate knew she wasnt.No.How long is he in town?I dont know.Hed always wanted to live in a big city, be some big hotshot detective or private investigator or something.Theyd had so many dreams ...I saw him in the diner, eating with friends.Its why ...I told you to take a break.But then I heard voices and saw you outside talking to him, so I guess my plan didnt work.Shed quit smoking years ago, but all today shed felt off.And that was when she turned to the electronic cigarettes.Just holding them helped ease her anxiety.Still a poor substitute for the real thing, but shed never pick one up again.Tate shrugged and gave Anne a weak smile.Its okay.I appreciate you trying to protect me from an awkward situation.Anne bit her lip.Go home, sweetie.This time Tate didnt argue.She hugged Anne and waved good bye to Margo.She went to the bathroom, managing to wash her hands without getting her bandage wet.When she looked in the mirror, she saw dark circles under her eyes, freckles so stark against her pale skin.She needed to get some sun.Lie out in her backyard or something.She snorted.When did she have time for that?As she walked to her Jeep, she untied her apron strings, cursing when her fingernails kept slipping on the tight knot, her movements awkward with the bandage.When she reached her old red Jeep, the rust spots near the tires growing each day, she wrenched open the door, hopped inside and slammed the door shut.She threw the apron into the backseat and leaned her head back, rubbing her hands over her face.It was only two hours away from the end of her shift, but routine was everything in Tates life right now.Her dad didnt expect her home until after work.She could ...go to the lake.Or go shopping.Or ...something for herself.Her fingers gripped the steering wheel as the birds in her rib cage beat against the bones.Maybe thats what she needed to feel like herself again.Her phone rang.She dug into her purse and answered it without looking at the caller ID.Hello?You need to come home.Her brothers voice, irritated and maybe a little panicked, shot those birds down.They flopped to the bottom of her stomach.Dead weight in her gut.Is he okay?she asked, jamming the key in the ignition and praying this wasnt the day old Jeep gave up the good life.The engine turned over and Cecil purred her broken rattle.I dont know.He fell in the bathtub.I mean, he wasnt taking a shower or whatever.He was in there and somehow tripped on the mat and into the tub.And hes heavy and its awkward and I cant lift him.The frustration was clear in Jamies voice, and Tate floored Cecil, rocks pinging the brick wall of the diner as she roared out of the lot.Ill be home in five, Jamie.Just stay with him.She pushed the thought of a lazy day at the lake out of her mind, way out.Those dreams were for another time.Another life.This was her life now.She pulled into her driveway and hopped out of her Jeep, hitting the ground running.She took the porch stairs into her house two at a time and threw open the front door.Deep voices sounded from the direction of the bathroom and her heart pounded.Two voices, two conscious voices, so that was a good sign.She pounded down the hall and skidded to a stop in the doorway of the bathroom, breathing hard with anxiety and exertion.Scared to death she was going to see her father bleeding or broken.Instead, she saw Jamie sitting cross legged in one end of the bathtub and her father sitting in the other end, legs stretched out in front of him.And they were both licking spoons.A carton of nearly empty ice cream between them.She blinked.Hey baby, her dad wheezed.Yo, Jamie said, lapping happily at his spoon like a damn dog.Once Tate unhinged her jaw from the shock of what she was seeing, she narrowed her eyes at the two men in the tub.Are you fucking kidding me right now?Language, her dad warned.Tate threw up her hands.I was scared out of my mind!I raced home, pushing Cecil way past her limits because I was worried about you, and you two are here enjoying a treat!Jamie held his spoon out to her.Want some?Tate tried to kill him with a death glare.Jamie scrunched his lips to the side and then lowered his hand back into his lap.Thats okay, its a little freezer burnt anyway.Their dad nodded at Jamie.And I like moose tracks better than Neapolitan.Baby, he said, turning to Tate, put some moose tracks ice cream on the grocery list, will you?Tate ignored him and pointed at Jamie.You.Out of the tub.But Im not done my ice  Get.Out.Jamie wrinkled his nose and stepped out onto the bathmat, grumbling.Now help me get Dad out of the tub, Tate ordered.Im comfy where I am, her dad said.Tate ignored him and ordered Jamie to stand beside her.Bracing their feet against the base of the tub, they hauled their father to a standing position by pulling on his arms.He tried to shrug them off weakly.I can step out myself.Oh really?Tate said.Just like you got into it so gracefully?He huffed, and she rolled her eyes.With Jamies help, they were able to help him out of the tub.They led him down the hallway and deposited him in his recliner.Jamie left to throw away the ice cream container while Tate stood in front of her father, hands on her hips.What happened?she asked.He eyed the bandage on her hand.What happened to you?I asked first.Im older than you.Tate sighed.I cut my hand on that dumb ice cream machine.So Im not too happy with the ice cream gods today.He squinted up at her.So does that mean no moose tracks?Dad  He held up his hand with a chuckle, then winced and tucked his elbow into his side.Tate took a step and knelt down beside the chair.Dad, come on, tell me.What happened?He didnt look at her when he talked, but stared at the blank TV screen.I was in the bathroom, using the facilities, and I guess I slipped on the tub.I caught myself with one arm on the bar but I banged the hell out of my elbow.Tate angled his arm to get a look at the joint.The area was already swelling, a bruise starting to form.As if he didnt have enough to deal with already, who knew how long this would set his recovery back.But she didnt say that.Okay, Dad, give me a minute and Ill get you some frozen peas.I think we only have corn.Fine, then, corn.In the kitchen, Jamie was rummaging in the fridge.Hand me some peas or corn or whatever we have, will you?Tate asked.Jamie opened the freezer and tossed a bag of frozen peas at her.She caught it as it hit her chest.Ow.Sorry.She smacked the bag on the counter to break up the frozen pea clumps.His elbow is pretty wrecked.Jamie didnt say anything, his movements jerky at as he pulled out a packet of sliced turkey to make a sandwich.Tate took a step closer.Hey, hes okay  The slam of a fist on the counter cut her off.Hes not okay, Tate.Hell never be the same.Jamies hazel eyes were pained and pissed and Tate hated seeing him like this.Hed been such a sweet kid, but the last four years had been hard on them, and hed grown into a brooding and out of control seventeen year old.She didnt know what to do with him.Look, Jamie  He whirled on her, the knife in his hand flinging mayo on the counter.Im done talking about it.She kept on, despite the angry flush rising up his neck like fire.Im glad you called me.I get that you were freaked out  Jamie slapped his sandwich together and turned to walk out of the kitchen.Jamie  He glared at her over his shoulder.Quit acting like the glass is half full, Tate.Its empty, and no matter how much sunny optimism you pour in it, its just going to keep leaking.And then he was gone.She flinched when his bedroom door slammed.She wanted the time to fall apart, to curl up in a ball and cry and feel sorry for herself, but she didnt have that luxury.She had to work.And take care of her father, whose body had been ravaged by lung cancer and was now currently in a remission that felt as fragile as an egg.And parent a seventeen year old boy man who looked at her like an annoying sister rather than the closest thing to a proper guardian he had.She grabbed her fathers oxygen tank from the corner of the living room.They still had it from when his condition was worse and she liked to think it gave him a boost when he was feeling weak.He rolled his eyes when he saw it, but kept quiet as she wrapped the bag of peas in a towel, then placed it on the arm of his chair.She nestled his elbow onto the makeshift cold pack.At least twenty minutes, okay?she said, handing him the remote.He nodded and then took the nasal cannula from her, placing it in his nose while she started his oxygen.You should be careful when youre in the bathroom, she said quietly.She made sure he was settled and as she turned to leave, he muttered, Im sorry.Tate closed her eyes as the word pierced her chest.She didnt know what he was apologizing for.Smoking a pack a day for years.Not taking care of himself.Falling.It didnt matter.She loved him with everything she had.She didnt blame him for her life.It was what it was.I love you, she said, brushing her lips across his forehead.Love you, too, baby, he answered, his breathing evening out with the extra help.She walked down the hallway of their small rancher as the sounds of deep bass pounded through the thin walls of her brothers room.She checked her bandage in the bathroom, glad to see the bleeding had stopped.Then she sequestered herself in her room and shut the door.She unstrapped her shoes and collapsed onto her bed on her back, staring at the ceiling.Her whole body felt like it weighed three hundred pounds and she wanted to melt into her mattress, let her skin fuse to the fabric so she never had to get up again.Her fingers itched for a cigarette, even though she hadnt smoked since the day after theyd gotten the diagnosis.Shed burned through the rest of her pack, literally, alone in a secluded area of a local park.Crying as she stomped on the last butt, shed vowed never to smoke again.And she didnt, except for the electronic cigarettes every once in a while.Like today.She rolled her head and stared at her small television set in her room, her eyes scanning her video game system, Catharsis, and stack of games.She sat up with a groan and reached out to look through the discs, trying to decide which game she could get lost in for a little while.To forget about real life.Her gaze was drawn to the one game shed hidden behind all her others.Utope sat dusty and lonely in its spot out of view.Shed thought about throwing it away so many times.But a part of her took comfort in knowing that imaginary life was still there if she ever wanted to return to it.Of course, it was just all pixels and coding, but in that world, she and Cam had a house and a dog and money.And a leopard print rug in the bedroom that Cam had hated but shed insisted looked perfect.Her hand stretched toward Utope.Maybe she could pop in the game just for a little.She hadnt played it in four years, thinking it was really creepy to return to the game where she and Cam had created a whole fictional life theyd eventually hoped to make nonfictional.But then her fathers voice called to her through her bedroom door.And she snapped her hand back.And returned her thoughts to the real world where they belonged.3      CAM TOSSED HIS keys into the metal dish on the table beside the front door and toed off his boots.Ma!he called, and listened for her answer.In here!came her voice from the direction of her bedroom.Cam walked up the stairs of their small, two bedroom town house theyd rented since he was in high school.He heard rummaging and cursing and rolled his eyes.He stopped in her doorway and leaned a shoulder against it, crossing his arms over his chest.His mother was bent over, digging in her closet like some sort of gopher.Ma, whatre you doing?She straightened, her gray streaked black hair escaping the headband decorated with a large fake flower bloom.She wore a flowing flower print dress that would have been ugly on anyone else.But not his ma.Im looking for my sandals, she answered, jutting a hip out and putting a fist on it in classic Teresa Ruizannoyed mode.Your sandals, he parroted.The ones with the big flowers on the top, she added.He gestured toward her dress and headband.Im thinking you can chill out on the flower theme.She narrowed her eyes and stomped her right bare foot, because the left one was still swollen from her sprain when she tripped down the stairs.Camilo!Ma!I want those sandals, she muttered, turning back to her closet and biting her lip.Itd always been just them.His dad had been some drifter whod never stuck around after his mom found out she was pregnant.So, whatever, hed had a sperm donor.But his mom did her best to make up for his lack of a father.She worked hardtwo, three jobs sometimes when he was a kid, and she loved the hell out of him.Shed begun to complain of pain when he was in middle school, and by high school, itd become unbearable.Test after test revealed nothing until one doctor suspected fibromyalgia, a syndrome associated with chronic muscle pain, depression and fatigue.After numerous visits with a specialist, his mom was diagnosed with it.Shed been put on several medications to help battle the pain and depression.Itd been a long road to find the right balance of doses.And sometimes those still needed to be altered.Since hed been home, her drug cocktail had changed again and they were both hoping this one would stick for a while.And at times like these, when his whip smart and quick witted mom looked lost, he wanted to punch a wall, or claw through the fibro fog that gripped her brain sometimes and made her brain work a little slower than normal.He sighed.I think theyre in the blue container on the shelf in your closet.She squinted at him, then turned to look up at the shelf.They are?I put all your summer shoes up there last fall.She frowned, then her face lightened and she turned to him with a smile.Well, then get them down for me, will you?He smiled back.Sure, Ma.Cam hauled the box down and helped her dig through it until she found the god awful sandals with the huge pink flower on the top.She sat down on the edge of her bed, slipped them on her feet and wiggled her toes.I forgot how much these made me happy, she said softly.Cam sat down beside her and brushed his lips on his mothers temple.How are you feeling?She had good days and bad dayswhen the pain was less but she was anxious and depressed.Or the pain and fatigue crippled her but yet her spirits were up.Today seemed like a better day than most.She confirmed that by saying, Im feeling pretty well today.Your ankle?he asked, twisting his neck to eye her foot.The bruise seemed to be healing although he was irritated she wouldnt wear the brace.She rotated her ankle a little.Its healing.She reached up and placed a palm on his cheek.Did you have a nice lunch with your friends?Yeah.Hows Max?A smile touched her lips.Cam rolled his eyes and nudged her.Hes got a girlfriend now.Get over your crush.She laughed, her eyes sparkling.Shed always had a soft spot for the big guy.Her face softened and her eyes searched his, like she was expecting something.And thats when he knew.Why didnt you tell me?he asked.Tell you what?she said innocently.Shes still here.In town.Her eyes shuttered, and she turned away.One of the biggest battles in his life had been balancing his mom and Tate.Two strong women who butted heads and never saw eye to eye.Who both thought they knew what was best for him and went to war against each other without consulting him.He sure as hell didnt miss that clusterfuck.His mom fidgeted with the fabric of her dress.Its been four years, I didnt even think about it.Cam raised an eyebrow.Really.Her head turned and she skewered him with those dark eyes.Did you talk to her?Briefly.She hummed under her breath and slipped her sandals off her feet.Mom, what  She laid a hand on his forearm.How long do you plan to stay?The change in her line of questioning caught him off guard.What?How long before you take that job in New York?The job offer in New York.His dream come true, working for a private security firm.But then Cams mom had fallen down the stairs, and he couldnt leave her alone.Despite her insistence she was fine, he just couldnt.He returned home after graduation and found she hadnt been able to hold down a job and the bills were piling up.After all shed done for him growing up, he couldnt abandon her now.Theyd given him the summer to decide before they found someone else to fill the job.Every time he thought about his fall deadline, a rock settled into his gut.He didnt want to talk about it.I dont know.They said I could take the summer to decide and  So come fall, youll take the job, she stated.Cam furrowed his brow.Yeah, probably.It depends how youre doing here  I never asked you to come home and take care of me.What was going on here?And why did she keep interrupting him?I know that, Ma, but youre in pain and youre not working.I couldnt just take a job states away and leave you here all alone.She was silent for a minute.So as long as Im okay, then youll take the job?The job you wouldnt stop talking about when you got the offer?Your dream job?He didnt mean to, but a growl rumbled in his throat.Ma  She held a hand up.Sorry.I shouldnt have grilled you like that.But she looked sad.Not sorry.I want to make sure youre still looking out for your future.I am.That seemed to pacify her.Im going to lie down for a little, okay?She patted his knee.Yeah, you need anything?She shook her head.He stood to leave as she scooted under her covers.I have to leave at six to head to work, he said.Okay, have a good night, she said, laying her head on her pillow and closing her eyes.He leaned down to give her another kiss.Love you.Love you too, she mumbled back.He walked out and closed the door behind him and then went to his own room.He sat down on his bed and picked at the calluses on his hands.In high school, hed taken a career placement test to determine what he wanted to do.And he found that he loved to research and observe.Solve puzzles.He shadowed a local security firm in town that also completed investigative work for a law firm.And he was hooked.He wanted to be one of the guys behind the computer, finding inconsistencies in pay stubs or accounting records or databases.Digging up criminal histories and background checks.He knew hed never afford school and didnt want the loans, so hed joined the Air National Guard.They paid his tuition, plus gave him a monthly stipend if he attended a monthly drill weekend.Itd been hard and grueling, but hed learned discipline and a lot of other technology skills.His last semester of college, as part of a class, hed spent two weeks in New York at a detective agency.He had a chance to actually do some of the things hed always dreamed of doing, and he was hooked.The owner, Vince Marino, had taken a liking to him, and offered to interview him after graduation.Theyd done a phone interview the week of finals, and Mr.Marino had offered him a job.He stood up and walked over to the shelves around his TV, picking through video games and books.There were novels he hadnt read yet, but nothing sounded appealing.Nothing promised to make him forget everything in his life for a couple of hours until he had to go to a job he had no desire to be doing.But that paid the bills.He brushed a stack of CDs and they clattered to the ground.He picked them up and stacked them in his arms, but when he went to place them on the shelf, a familiar case caught his eye.The green and blue logo of Utope.Damn, he hadnt touched the game since he left for basic.Hed thought about it though, plenty of times.Hed thought about their little pale blue house.And their dog.And the rain forest in the backyard with poison dart frogs.He snorted a laugh when he remembered how many dogs theyd gone through before they learned to erect a fence around their deadly rain forest.In high school, his best friend, Trevor Ames, had looked at him like he was crazy when he talked about playing Utope with Tate.It was a simulation game, where the player could create individualized avatars, build houses and communities.Trevor preferred Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty.Cam liked those, too, but there was nothing like the escape of playing Utope with Tate.When they imagined what life theyd have, far from the soul sucking Paradise.He slammed the CDs back in front, hiding Utope from his view.That was all gone, every dream theyd had.Vanished.But why couldnt he get over it?Hed spent four years trying to get the taste of Tate out of his mouth but she was always there under his tongue, seeping out when he least expected it.He could get through this summer.He could get through dealing with seeing Tate.He was twenty three.He had exes in college.He could deal with it.But as the blue and green colors of the video game burned into his retinas, he couldnt deny that there was always something different and special about Tate Ellison.DEKES BAR WAS kind of a dive.Well, most places in Paradise were dives, so Dekes was no exception.There was also no Deke.The owner of the bar was Cynthia Parker and before that itd been her father, Richard Parker.Cam figured Richard was trying to attract the biker crowd by naming it something like Dekes Bar, but instead itd turned into the bar where all the kids from the local community college gravitated.Trevor, a bartender at Dekes, said the patrons mostly played pool and sang Sweet Caroline and danced.Then there were Taco Tuesdays, when Cynthia had a waitress scoop ground meat out of a flowered slow cooker into soft shells, and sold them two for a dollar.The public area of Dekes was one big room, with the bar along one end, then a small dance floor surrounded by tables.On a platform on the other end were a couple of pool tables and a digital jukebox.This was only Cams second day on the job as a bouncer/ID checker/heavy lifter guy.It wasnt what he wanted to do, but the job wasnt hard and it paid pretty well for such a hole in the wall.Plus he got to work with Trevor.Hed been friends with Trevor since middle school, when they were paired up on the soccer team, Trevor with the gloves guarding the goal, Cam in front of him as the last defender.Theyd both been sullen, pissed off, fatherless teenagers, but as theyd learned how to communicate with each other on the field, itd translated to off the field as well.
