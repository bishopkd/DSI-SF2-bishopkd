  Two cod and chips?I look up from the counter.Yes please, love.The man gives me a welcome smile.Its lunchtime, Friday, and we should be busier than this.Much busier.Theres been a steady trickle, but the usual queue at Live and Let Fry has been noticeably missing for some weeks now, maybe even months.I dish out the chips, golden and hot, and top them with two cod, freshly cooked, with crisp batter sizzling.Salt?Vinegar?Just as they are, the customer says.Hes licking his lips already.Its certainly not Phils fish and chips that are putting off the customers.Wrapping them in white paper, I hand over his package and with a spring in his step, the customer leaves.Phil Preston, my boss and fish fryer extraordinaire, looks at his watch.How many have been in today, Nell?Not many.I give a sympathetic grimace.A handful at best.The cold weather normally brings in people in droves.Phil rubs his hands together even though its as warm as always in here.As well as the takeaway counter, we also have a small eat in caf too, which is normally very popular.Today, there are just two people enjoying their lunch.Jenny, my co worker, who is the waitress today, has spent most of her time flicking through Heat magazine.I could stand outside and waft some chips about, Jenny offers helpfully as she drags her attention away from the latest celebrity dramas.Its going to take a bit more than that.Phil shakes his head.We cant keep blaming everything on the credit crunch.What about up selling?Jen continues.Like they do in coffee shops.Do you want a pie with that?Mushy peas?Pickled egg?Gherkin?We all laugh.You have that down to a fine art, Jen, I tell her.Im going to try it tonight, she insists.You watch me.Pinching a chip from the warmer, I nibble it absently.Ive worked at the chippy now for well over a year.I do shifts at lunchtime  twelve until two  and then Im back again in the evening  six through to ten.It means that my boyfriend, Olly, and I can share childcare for our daughter, Petal.Im not saying its easy  we could probably both get jobs in the circus with the amount of juggling we have to do to get through the week  but needs must.Were not alone in having to keep a lot of plates in the air these days.Everyone has to do it.Right?Petals just four years old and as much as I dont want to wish her life away, I cant wait for her to start school.Im hoping that once she does, life wont be quite as frantic as it is now.What am I going to do?Phil asks, running his hand through his hair.This is getting dire.The unspoken thought is that if it goes on like this then he wont need to keep on so many staff.Its probably only because Jenny, our other colleague, Constance, and I have been here for so long and the fact that we all get on so well that Phil hasnt let one or more of us go before now.Its a worrying time.I look round at the caf.The tables are glossy orange pine, the walls are painted peach and theres a flowery border at waist height thats curling up in more places than its stuck to the wall.It does look a bit tired in here, Phil, I venture.If you dont mind me saying.You think so?Youre a bloke, I remind him.You never notice these things.It is a bit of an eighties throwback look, Jenny adds.Really?Phil looks round as if hes seeing the caf with new eyes.Im useless with a paintbrush.I could get a decorator in to give us a quote if you think it needs a spruce up.They call it a makeover these days, Phil.It probably wouldnt hurt, I say.Its fair to say that its been a long time since Phil spent any money on the interior of this place.Phil tuts.What do reckon it would cost?Cash is the one thing I havent got to splash about.Give me some money, I say before my brain has fully engaged.Ill do it for you.Phil laughs.You said yourself that you cant afford to bring in the pros.I could do it a lot cheaper.We can all muck in to help.After all, its our jobs that are on the line if this place sinks.Yes, but  Im a great decorator, I protest before he lays out his objections.Youve been to my house.I know.Its whats the word?Unique, I supply, and fun.And all my own work.My living room has pink candy stripe wallpaper with matching spotty chairs.I sanded and stained the floorboards myself and whizzed up some cushions that look like big cupcakes.We could do something like that here.Jazz the place up.Phil brightens.You think so?I shrug.Why not?Ill make a mood board tonight.Mood board?Jenny and Phil exchange a puzzled look.I can start tomorrow after we close up.Now Phil looks surprised  and not a little terrified.Tomorrow?No time like the present.Im not doing anything tomorrow night  mores the pity, Jenny offers.She is currently man free  a fairly rare occurrence.My friend is a curvy brunette with ample comely charms and, as such, is a big hit with the gentlemen.Though cads and bounders feature heavily on the menu and none of them ever stay around for long.Im not exactly a dab hand with a paintbrush, she admits, but I can do labouring and make tea.Sounds good to me, I say.We both look at Phil expectantly.Im not doing anything either, he confesses with a shrug.Phil is in his early sixties, I would think, and his wife left him about five years ago for a younger man whos been giving her the runaround ever since.He doesnt get out much unless we drag him to the pub or for a pizza.Live and Let Fry is pretty much his life.But he looks good for his age.Dapper, you could say.Hes a bit portly due to his largely chip based diet, and we all tease him about his hair being a bit thin on top.But bald isnt a bad thing now, is it?Jenny is always trying to fix him up with sundry women, but he doesnt seem very interested.I think secretly hes probably worried that hed end up with someone just like Jenny.And shes way too much woman for him to handle.Phil purses his lips in thought.How much do you think it would cost?No idea.I normally have to beg, steal or borrow paint if the decorating urge comes upon me, so Im somewhat out of touch with B&Qs current price list.Most of our house is painted with leftover half tins purloined from my parents garage and all mixed together.Im thinking that Phil might want a slightly more upmarket approach than this.But say you stump up three hundred pounds and see what we can get with that?I know that paints expensive now  what isnt?but the caf is only small.If we start on Saturday night, we could work all day Sunday and be open for business again on Monday.Phil looks a bit teary.Did anyone ever tell you that youre a little treasure, Nell McNamara?All the time, I say, lightly batting the compliment away before Phil gets into full blub mode and starts me off too.You lot might get on my nerves most of the time, he jokes, but youre all like family to me.I dont know what Id do without you.If we dont get some more customers through the doors you might well be finding out, I remind him.And I, for one, need this job.So if it means spending my precious weekend slapping a bit of paint on, then that works for me.2      As always when we shut up the chippy, I take great pleasure in liberating my long blonde bob from beneath my utilitarian cap, and then I always steal ten minutes for myself and walk a circuitous route home, passing my favourite shop.Today, the crackle of autumn is in the air and I enjoy being outside, breathing in the scent of coffee that drifts from a dozen different cafs that I pass.We live in the small market town of Hitchin, in the heart of the beautiful county of Hertfordshire.Its a nice enough place to live, though Im sure some of its charms have been lost on me after living here for so many years.You take things like that for granted, dont you?I think if you came here as a visitor youd love it, but for me, well, its just where I live.You dont really stop to look around and think how fab it is.My love, Olly Meyers, and I were both born and brought up here and sometimes I think we should move somewhere more obviously cool, more creative, like Brighton or well, wherever else is more happening.Petal would like it by the sea too.Though this place isnt exactly a cultural desert when it comes to style.There are some trendy independent boutiques selling weird, wacky and wonderful stuff which I love.Olly and I are both mad keen fans of the sixties  music, films, clothes  and one thing I can say about Hitchin is that were well served here when it comes to our passion.Theres a great market that has been here since time began.I get a lot of clothes cheaply from the vintage stall thats always there, and the rest I run up on my trusty sewing machine.There are also a couple of fantastic haberdashery stalls that are brilliant for picking up cheap ribbons, buttons and the like.Ollys favourite pit stop is the second hand record stall and we have a mountain of vinyl in our spare room.Theres a scooter shop run by one of Ollys mates  my dearly beloveds other obsession  and a couple of great retro lifestyle shops that keep us supplied with cheap furnishings.The chippy is located in one of the small shopping arcades that radiate off from the Market Place.It might be Victorian  I have no idea  but its decorated with pretty ironwork and has an arched glass roof.Marvellous for pigeons to settle in, but its quaint and full of character.The place isnt without its fair share of the unsightly 1960s carbuncles that most English towns now harbour, but theres actually a lot of the centre thats managed to survive untrammelled by council insanity.I wander away from the Market Place, turning from the rash of chain stores and down through the old part of town where the shops are in small alleys, still packed tightly together in quaint, timbered buildings, all higgledy piggledy.This is where my favourite shop is tucked away.Betty the Bag Lady is an oasis for me.When people are stressed they might go to yoga classes or take a swim or down a good glass of Pinot Grigio.Me, I head for Betty the Bag Lady.The Betty in question isnt an ageing lady with a blue rinse as her name might suggest.This Betty is young and trendy.Shes even smaller than me and Im not exactly an Amazonian woman.My mum bought me a school blazer with room to grow when I was eleven and it was still way too big for me when I hit sixteen.My mother was clearly overly optimistic about the size I would eventually attain.Betty has her immaculately straightened hair dyed white, whereas mine is a golden blonde and is often tied up so someone doesnt enjoy a portion of it with their chips.Betty is probably about twenty five, Im fast approaching thirty: its fair to say that Im hideously jealous of her.Fancy having your own shop!Oh, Id think Id died and gone to heaven.Clearly Betty paid attention at school and did her homework and went on to do good things.I stared out of the window and daydreamed and wondered how much better our uniform would have been if it wasnt fashioned from nylon and had been in luscious shades of pink instead of bottle green.I lost my homework on the way home, hung round with boys in the park and, so, never amounted to much.I wanted to learn  I really did  I just didnt want to learn about Pythagorass Theorem or Ox bow lakes or the Tolpuddle Martyrs.I wanted to learn about interesting things, even though I had no clue what they might be.I just know that I felt like a very square peg in a very round hole.So I left school at sixteen, ignoring my parents despairing pleas and cries of university!, and drifted.I worked in Tesco and a shoe shop and a dozen other dead end jobs before I rocked up at Live and Let Fry.Some days I wish Id tried harder.Some days I love my work.Lets face it, how many jobs come with free chips?Betty also runs with the London crowd, whereas I married young and settled down.She knows people in the know.I know no one.If I get another turn at life, I think Id like to come back as Betty.This afternoon, Betty the Bag Lady is open for business.The shop has been here for about a year and in my humble opinion, its a welcome addition to the Hitchin shopping experience.At night, when Ive finished my shift and the shop is closed, I actually press my nose against the window and dream of things that might have been.Bettys handbags are not mere bags but are veritable works of art and, as such, are completely beyond my price range.I might be a regular visitor here but Im not a very good customer.Im purely a window shopper, but Betty doesnt seem to mind too much.I come in to coo and purr at the bags, but I always have to put them back on the shelf.Hi, Nell, Betty says as I push through the door.All right?Fine.The shop is a calm oasis.If I could ever have my own shop one day, this is the atmosphere Id like to create.Its done out like someones living room and I can feel myself unwind as soon as Im over the threshold.The only thing that Im conscious of is that until Ive been in the shower, I bring with me the lingering odour of cod and chips.Whats new?Get a load of these, she moons as she strokes a bag Ive not seen before.New in today.Bought them from a designer up in Manchester.The bags are all handmade in felt, vintage style, and smothered in buttons of all different shapes, sizes and colours.They are luscious and Im instantly in love.I pick up an oversized one in differing, shimmering rainbow tones  red, yellow, green, blue, orange, purple  and hook it over my arm.Its mesmerising.And it fits me perfectly.Ever since I was a child, Ive loved handbags.My earliest memory is taking my mothers out of her cupboard and parading round the house with each of them in turn.Looks like I inherited the handbag fiend gene from her.I am hoping to pass it on to my own daughter, too.My mums responsible for my interest in fashion  compared to my friends parents, mine were a tiny bit bohemian and fun.Every Saturday when I was growing up, wed go into town and look at what was new in the shops.Even if we couldnt buy anything, wed spend hours trying stuff on.She often made my clothes for me so I didnt look like all the other kids and she taught me how to sew and knit, do patchwork and crochet.Wed spend hours together painting in our old, lean to conservatory  something Id like to do with Petal if she didnt have the patience of Attila the Hun.Its a shame that I hardly see my mum now that Im older and shes moved away.Retirement to a small town in Norfolk was something that I hadnt seen on the cards for her, but she loves it.My own extensive collection of handbags is in a wardrobe in our spare room, which drives Olly mad as hed like to take over the entire space for his precious collection of vinyl records.Sometimes I take all the bags out just to look at them.Occasionally I let Petal play with them, just as my mum did with me.Men just dont get the whole handbag thing, do they?Though they come in surprisingly useful when they want us to carry all their stuff in them.Right?All my handbags are in their own dust bags, each one with happy memories attached.A woman can never have too many handbags.I love it, I breathe, admiring myself this way and that in the full length mirror.Suits you, Betty agrees.I cant even bring myself to ask how much.A hundred, she says.Then, at my sharp intake of breath, I could do you a discount.As a regular.I dont point out that Im a regular who buys nothing.Even with a discount, I cant consider it, I say reluctantly.Even though its much cheaper than many of her bags, Betty might as well have asked me for a million quid.Olly would kill me.In a particularly painful manner.My handbag buying has been severely curtailed in recent years.Frankly, I cant even think of the last time I bought one.But I can all too easily bring to mind the mountain of bills sitting on our sideboard: gas, electricity, council tax.The rent is due and as always, Petal needs more shoes.The very last thing on earth that I can afford to splash money on is a fancy handbag.Want me to put it to one side for you?Betty cajoles.I could keep it for a couple of weeks if you put a small deposit on it.A tenner would do it.I can feel myself weakening.In my purse is a tenner.My last one.In my wardrobe there is the perfect outfit to go with this bag.If theres a greater temptation than the perfect handbag, then I certainly cant think of it.Running my fingers over the buttons, I chew at my lip.Surely my child wouldnt mind wearing scuffed shoes for a while longer for the greater good?Then I come to my senses.I cant, Betty.Much as Id love to.Taking the handbag off my shoulder, I reluctantly hand it back to her.Another time, she says.Yeah.I leave the shop, crestfallen.Another time.Another life.3      When I finally get home, Olly is playing tea party with Petal.Theyre both sitting on the lounge floor, picnic rug spread out, surrounded by dolls.Petal is pouring pretend tea out of an orange plastic teapot and Olly is humouring her by eating a Jammie Dodger in the style of the Queen from a child size plate.Even our dog, Dude  the least walked dog on the planet  is in tea party mood, with a checked napkin tied round his neck.He is looking longingly at the biscuits.Daddy, share your biscuit with Dude, Petal instructs as I come through the door.Olly does as he is told and Dude whines with relief.Hes very fond of food, our dog, and treats every meal as his last after having been dumped at a rescue centre, half starved.The kennel girl described him to us as the most minging dog shed ever seen.Of course, that made us fall in love with him instantly.Hes a black something or other with a white patch on his chest and a face that looks like it has seen the hard side of life.Happily, those sad days are behind him and apart from in the walkies department, he lives a life of comfort, ease, regular meals and occasional Jammie Dodgers.Hey, I say.The worker returns.I was just about to call, Olly says when he sees me.Thought youd got lost, hun.Needed a bit of therapy, I tell him.Ah, Bettys handbag emporium.I throw myself onto a beanbag.Yes.Said with a yearning sigh.Petal and I had pasta and pesto for lunch, he tells me.Ive left a bowl for you to put in the microwave later.Daddys cooking is nicer than yours, Petal tells me.That is because everything I give her to eat comes out of a packet.Thats why Im very kind and let Daddy do it so much.Thanks, Olly says.Youre all heart.We both laugh and, although weve been together now for over ten years, I never tire of the sound of it.Im just going to finish this delicious Jammie Dodger that Petal has prepared for me and then Ive got to see a man about a disco.Dont forget Im back on at six.Eat a biscuit, Mummy.Petal presses one on me.Theyre good for you.I do hope she hasnt gleaned this slightly flawed nutritional titbit from me.I wont, Olly says.Ill be back in time.There might be a new residency at a punk bar thats opening.In Hitchin?Dont knock it.Were a very diverse community.Isnt it a little bit late for punk?Im told theres a resurgence.Olly shrugs his bewilderment at the ways of the world.But then, to be fair, we do still have an unhealthy attachment to all things sixties.I guess some people have never been able to throw away their dog collars and bondage trousers.Do you actually know anything about punk music?I take in Ollys crisp white button down shirt and cords.Sex Pistols.Clash.Buzzcocks.Er   Bob the Builder, Petal chimes in.Bob the Builder, Olly agrees.That well known pogoer.Whats a pogoer, Daddy?Its someone who jumps up and down a lot.So, of course, my daughter has to try it.As does the dog.Im outta here, Olly says.Sure, I say.Thanks for leaving me with an overexcited child and dog.Go and knock them dead with your extensive knowledge of punk.We need the money, Nell.If that means I have to become a latter day expert on punk rock, then so be it.I know.Im only teasing.I lean over and kiss Olly.Youre wonderful.Are you on shift tonight?Yeah.Ill be ready to leave as soon as you get home.And that sums up our life really.Ships that pass in the night, handing over our child as we do.I know that money isnt everything, but life is certainly a lot harder if you dont have any.Olly works the night shift in a pizza factory, which fits in with him looking after Petal and shoehorns round my shifts too, though it means his sleep is generally random and insufficient.It pays the bills but its not exactly living the life.Like my job, it does come with free food.There is, however, only so much pizza one can eat in a lifetime.Olly picks up Petal  which does momentarily stop her from bouncing, although Dude does it more to compensate  and squeezes her.Be good for Mummy.She looks at him as if thats never in any doubt.Come and give me a cuddle, I say, and my wriggly daughter joins me on the beanbag.As does the dog.Petals hair smells of strawberry shampoo  Olly must have washed it for her today  and I kiss it softly.My baby looks just like her dad.Dark unruly hair, chocolate brown eyes, rugby players legs.Do you know that youre the best little girl in the whole wide world?Yes, Petal says.Can I have another Jammie Dodger?Might as well try to push it while youre in favour, I think.Yes.Then you can help Mummy to do a mood board.Shes going to decorate Uncle Phils chip shop.I remember that Ive completely forgotten to mention this to Olly or the fact that he will, as a result, be in charge of childcare for the whole weekend.I hope hes not arranged extra work as he quite often does.Pink, Petal suggests.Do the chip shop pink.And do you know, I might well do.4      Im never happier than when Im doing stuff like this.The living room floor is covered with scraps of fabric, trimmings, beads and buttons that Ive collected over the years from goodness knows where.Cut out this one for me please, I say to my small assistant.Petal has her tiny pink tongue out in concentration and is snipping pictures from my collection of old, battered magazines with her plastic, kiddy scissors and meticulous care.Im sticking and pasting like a thing possessed and my ideas for the big Live and Let Fry makeover are crystallising nicely.The door opens and Olly pops his head round.I suppose my lady would like a cup of tea before she goes to work?Work?I glance at my watch.Omigod, is that the time?Hours have passed.I havent showered, eaten, troubled myself with housework.All Ive done this afternoon is fiddle with this mood board.Ive got to fly.What are you doing?I forgot to tell you that Ive volunteered to decorate Phils place this weekend.Were really struggling for business, Olly.I felt it was the least I could do.Cool.That means youre on parenting duty again.He shrugs.When am I ever not on parenting duty?Soon shell be twenty two and we can have a day off, I promise him.Ill look forward to it.How did the meeting go?Good, he says with a self satisfied smile.Between now and Wednesday I need to become Hitchins answer to the Malcolm McLaren I managed to convince them that I am.I get up and give him a hug.Youve got such a very clever daddy, Petal.Whatever, our child says.She even does the W with her hands.I dont know who has taught her this.Ive checked with Stu Stapleton.Hes got a loft full of punk vinyl that I can borrow.Thats nice.Didnt know Stu was a closet punk rocker.We all have our dark secrets, Olly says.Now, he smacks me soundly on the bottom, go and get yourself showered while I make some tea and ping this pasta for you.I can get some chips at the shop.You cant live on chips, woman, he says.If youre giving up your entire weekend for Phil, surely he wont mind if youre ten minutes late.Phil, bless him, never minds what we do.I dont think that anyone has ever told him that sometimes bosses can actually be in control of their staff.I hope no one ever does either as we love him just as he is.Ill come and give a hand, too.What about Petal?Shes not too young to learn about the working end of a paintbrush.Shes four.Going on thirty four.Once upon a time she would have been up a chimney at her age.Knowing our daughter, she would have enjoyed it.I know that youre talking about me, Petal says without looking up.Olly and I smile at each other.God help us when shes sixteen.My lover pulls me into the hallway and winds his arms round me.You smell of chips.Sorry, I say.I got so caught up in myself, I havent even showered yet.I find it quite a turn on, he whispers in my ear.Oh, really?Hmm.When exactly did you and I last have a night of passion?Er?When was Petal conceived?Ah, yes, he says.I remember it well.But, joking aside, it has been some considerable time since our bodies were horizontal without having a small child wedged between them.I promise I will rectify that very soon.Oh, yes?His beautiful brown eyes glint with mischief.Ill hold you to that.Clearly it wont be this weekend as the only stripping off I have in mind is Phils 1980s border from his scruffy chip shop walls.5      This is it?Phils eyes widen at the sight of my colourful mood board.Are you sure?Trust me, I say.It will look fabulous.Whats that?He points to one of the cuttings.A little twiddle, I inform him.Nothing to worry about.Twiddle, he mutters under his breath.Since when does a chip shop have twiddles?Take a chill pill, Phil, Jenny throws in.Nell knows what shes doing.Then to me, You do, dont you?I do a theatrical sigh.Oh, ye of little faith.This morning I went out and bought the paint before my lunchtime shift, having cajoled the promised three hundred pounds out of my boss.I also got us brushes, trays, white spirit and all the other guff you need for decorating.At least I hope I got everything.Now, at ten oclock, the shop is shut up for the night an hour earlier than usual and Phils small but perfectly formed army of willing workers is about to get cracking.Im so thankful that Jenny has turned up because if shed had a better offer from a hot, or even slightly lukewarm, bloke it could have gone either way.Our co worker, Constance, is also here.Shes quite a bit older than Jen and me, late fifties probably, and has been with Phil since he first opened the shop which must be more than twenty years ago.She has a great figure, unnaturally red hair and a penchant for leopard print leggings, tight sweaters and hooker heels, which is, indeed, the outfit she has turned up to paint in.Foreseeing this and, in the interest of protecting her clothing, I bought us all white paper overalls in Poundland.Now weve pulled them on, we look like some sort of crack team of forensic investigators instead of hapless amateur decorators.Phil levers the lid off the first tin of paint and turns pale.Its the lightest shade of pink I could find.Think the inside of a shell, sugared almonds, a ballet tutu.Pink?Dont question, I tell him.Just paint.Constance has inch long fingernails, manicured in the brightest of reds, but that doesnt stop her from picking up a scraper and setting about the skanky border with vigour.Within seconds, scraps of it are lying at her high heeled feet.If you wash down the walls first with sugar soap and then well set to on the painting, I tell Phil and Jenny.OK?They both shrug their acquiescence and pick up the cheap buckets and sponges I bought and start to wash down the walls.Weve already covered the black and white tiled floors with newspaper and grouped the furniture in the middle of the room.While they scrub away, I start to strip the varnish from the glossy, orange pine tables and chairs, which is going to be a long and messy job.Constance pauses from her scraping to turn up the stereo.Disco classics pump out.Were going to need something to keep us going, she says.So we all sing along to Saturday Night Fever.We even throw some moves with our sponges.As we happily clean and scrub and strip, the occasional drunk, seeing all the lights still on, bangs on the door in search of chips, only to be disappointed.Its pushing midnight before Phil dips his brush in the paint for the first time.He closes his eyes momentarily, fresh, shiny pink poised over the ancient, skanky peach.For better, for worse, he says.Go on with you, I chide.It will look marvellous.Pink, he mutters under his breath.Pink.I dont confide in him that my four year old was my style advisor.Im done, Constance says.She stands back and admires her handiwork.The entire curled up border has gone and the remnants of it have been sanded from the walls.And I havent even chipped a nail.Youre a star.My mobile rings and Im so pleased to see that its Olly on the line.Hey, I say.Missing me?As always.Hows it going?Constance is our star turn and Phil is about to start painting.Ive done nothing but strip all night.Now Im interested, Olly says.I wish I could come over.I know.I thought Olly and Petal could come down here for an hour or two tomorrow, but its too chaotic already to accommodate Petal and shed probably be bored within ten minutes.Besides, Im missing Olly now.Hows Petal?Fast asleep since eight.Are you tired?Not especially.I managed a doze earlier.My dearly beloveds ability to exist only on regular catnaps constantly amazes me.He has, through force of necessity, learned to grab forty winks whenever he can  sometimes while standing up, quite frequently in the middle of a conversation.I can go and take over from Olly if he wants to come down here for a couple of hours, Constance suggests.Im happy stretched out on your sofa as I am anywhere.Not that we get a great deal of nights out but when we do, Constance is always willing to lend a hand.She lives on her own and has no pressing commitments and she absolutely adores Petal and vice versa, so shes become a surrogate nan to my daughter.Unfortunately, weve no family that live close to help us out.Ollys dad died over ten years ago, not that long before we got together, and his mum now lives out in Spain.My dear old dad took early retirement and, as I said before, he and mum moved to Norfolk years ago now.Great for holidays but not a lot else.So we do lean heavily on Constance when the cracks start to show in our complicated domestic arrangements.Jenny, too, has been known to step into the breach when weve needed an extra pair of hands.Want to come down and give us the benefit of your expertise with a paintbrush?I ask Olly.Constance will come to the house.Sure.I turn to Constance.He says yes.Ill be there in five.The unflattering overalls are already being peeled off.Half an hour later and Olly joins us and just the energy that he brings when he turns up lifts us all and we keep painting and sanding late into the night.He works with Jenny, doing the bits she cant reach and its good to hear them laughing together.Theyve always got on like a house on fire.Its three oclock before I look at my watch again.Then I notice that Phil is flagging.Come on, I say.Get that overall off and get yourself home.I am a bit tired, he admits wearily and I could kick myself that Ive let him stay here so long.Id clean forgotten that hes done a full day at work already.Are you going to pack it in, too?We might just stay a bit longer.What do you say, Olly?Plenty of life in me yet.My other half stifles a fake yawn.Go home, I say to Phil.Weve cracked the back of it now.Get a few hours sleep and come back tomorrow, refreshed and raring to go.My bed is calling.So is mine, Jenny says.Go.Both of you.See you tomorrow?Unless Robert Pattinson phones and wants to bite me, Jen says.Are you sure youre OK on your own?Phil asks one more time.Yes!Olly and I chorus.He holds up his hands.Im gone.Im gone.Minutes later, Olly and I are on our own.I turn off the disco music and put on some of the sixties soul music I insist on listening to in the shop.A CD of slowies.The mellow sounds of Marvin Gaye and I Heard It Through the Grapevine fill the shop.I make a cup of tea in the kitchen, stick a couple of sugars in it for some energy and take it back through to Olly who is still painting.He stops and we sit on the floor together.As Smokey Robinson sings The Tracks of My Tears, he wraps an arm round my shoulder and I lean into him.We let the soft music flow over us.This is almost like a date, I say to him.Its the closest weve had to one in a long time.I do love you, I tell him.Even though we have no money and no time and no sex.I love you, too.Olly kisses me and for a moment, I forget all about the painting or that Im sitting on the floor of a chip shop.6      On Monday morning, Im at my sewing machine, foot to the pedal, whizzing frantically through the fabric.Im due at work in an hour and I want to get down there early to see Phils face when he opens up.Nearly done?Olly asks.Last bit.I whip the fabric out of the machine and check my handiwork.Phil will be blown away.I hope so.Im up and packing my final surprise into a carrier bag.Youll be all right holding the fort until I come back?Petal and I are going to see the ducks in the town.Arent we, Petalmeister?Yay!my daughter cries and I kiss her.I love you both so much, I say, and then Im out of the door running towards Live and Let Fry.Last night I herded everyone out of the caf at about seven oclock.But what I didnt tell Phil was that I was sneaking back during the hours of darkness to add a few finishing touches.Ive been up most of the night, painting and planning, sewing and swearing, and now Im giddy with a heady mix of extreme tiredness and excitement.When I get to the chippy, Jenny and Constance are already waiting for me and rush to hug me.We cant believe what youve done with the place!The walls are fresh, the palest of pinks.The once glossy, orange furniture is now pared down and paint washed with a distressed white finish.At the head of each table where they butt with the wall, Ive painted candelabra in fine black paint complete with bright pink candles.The wall by the door is painted with an ornate fireplace with a clock on top, again in black with highlights of bright pink.Ive put some more twiddles round the coat rack.On the front of the counter, there are three busy waitresses painted in French 50s style  capturing Constance, Jenny and me for time immemorial.Or, at least until the next refit.At their feet, Dude sits expectantly, a ruff round his neck.Phil has been transformed into a largetummied proprietor with a middle parting and a comedyvillain moustache.You cant have done this all last night?I finished at four this morning, I confess.At the very thought of my all night marathon, weariness washes over me.You like it?It looks sensational, they say in unison.You think Phil will like it?Hell love it, they reassure me.One more surprise.Out of my carrier bag, I whip the fruits of my labour.Omigod, Jenny says.Theyre fab.You really made these?Quick, quick, put them on.Phil will be here any second.We all help each other to tie on the pink and white frilly gingham aprons and hats that Ive spent all night working on.As instructed, were all wearing white blouses and black pencil skirts.The aprons and hats are edged with some lace that Ive had lying around for ages.I bought the gingham fabric cheaply from the market to run up a new duvet cover for Petal, but Ive just never got round to it.It would be really great if I could make some caf style curtains in the same fabric for the windows, but that would mean tapping up Phil for some more cash as the three hundred quid is all gone.Get an eyeful of us, Constance says, admiring her apron.Now we look exactly like the ladies in my illustration.Who will be able to resist chips from girls as hot as this?Lets hope it works.I take a steadying breath.Otherwise well all be signing on in a few weeks.Hes here!Hes here!Jen shouts as Phils car pulls into the small car park opposite.All three of us bounce nervously as we watch him cross the road.I cant help notice how tired and worn my boss looks as he comes towards us.Hopefully this will put the smile back on his face.He opens the door and the bell chimes.What are you lot doing in so early?Then he stops in his tracks and looks round.Bloody hell, Phil says.Bloody, bloody hell.Tears spring to his eyes and, of course, we all follow suit.Look at you, he adds, finally noticing our new outfits.He turns round and round, unable to take it all in.He points at the painting on the front of the counter and his mouth gapes open.I hardly recognise the place.This is fantastic.He stands, speechless, staring at his transformed chippy, until Constance says, Come here, you silly old fool.He comes to hug us all.Thank you, he says, choked.Thank you so much.Its Nell youve got to thank, Jenny says.We just did a bit of donkey work.Phil stands in front of me.What can I say?Lets see if it pulls in the customers.How could it not?My boss grabs me in a bear hug.Youre one in a million, Nell McNamara.One in a million.Well, I say.It wasnt just me.Constance!Nip to the supermarket, love.We have to have a toast, Phil says.We need champagne!Champagne, indeed!As if Im going to argue with that.7      Within a week, there are queues down the street outside Live and Let Fry.Word of our new look has clearly spread and the caf is permanently full.So much so, that were turning people away at closing time.Phil is saying that from next week, well be open all afternoon.Frankly, Ive never seen him grin so much.Constance is doing nothing but complain about how much her feet are hurting and that only serves to make Phil grin more.Theyre bad enough that shes even thinking of swapping her trademark stilettos for flatties.Phil is so pleased with the makeover that hes already given me the money for some matching gingham curtains and Im going to run those up this weekend.Hes also talking about splashing out on a fancy black chandelier for the caf to complement my painted ones and I think that would look great.At close of business, Ive lost count of how many portions of fish and chips Ive doled out.Its not only Constances feet that are hurting.I think all the excitement is catching up with me and I wonder if I can persuade Petal that shed like an afternoon nap today so we can snuggle up together for an hour.Hopefully, Olly will have done something with her to have worn her out.Im just folding my pretty, gingham apron when Phil takes my arm and pulls me into the kitchen.Ive got something for you, he says, suddenly bashful and from behind his back, he pulls out a familiar, upmarket carrier.Bettys?Phil smiles softly.Ive seen you looking in that window week in, week out, Nell.You have?I do notice some things, he chides.Even though Im a bloke.He holds out the bag.Just a little gift.To say thank you.For everything.Its too much, I tell him.You havent seen what it is yet.Taking the posh paper carrier, I peep inside.Betty said it was the one you liked.I pull out the handbag.Its the felt one, covered in gorgeous rainbow coloured buttons.The one I have coveted from afar.It is, I breathe.My fingers trace over the buttons.Its beautiful.But I cant accept this.All I did was splash a bit of paint around.Nell, youve doubled my takings in a week.I was having sleepless nights wondering how I was going to pay the bills.Youve turned it all around.Its up to me now to keep it going.But  I want you to take the bag, Nell.Take it and enjoy it.You deserve it.Its lovely, Phil, I say.I didnt expect this.Can I offer you something else, Nell?he says.A piece of advice?I shrug.Dont stay here.His voice cracks with emotion.I dont want to lose you, but youve got so much more to offer than serving fish and chips.Look at what youve done.Really look at it.Its amazing.Now Im blushing.Youve got to find a way to use that creativity.Dont waste your talent.Go to art college or something.I dont know.But you have to do something with your life, Nell.Promise me that.OK, I say.But what?What can I do?Phil has said out loud what has, for some time, been silently tiptoeing through my brain.I would love to do something more creative.Be someone special.But how?Where would I even start?Ive got commitments.To Olly, to Petal.To add to that, were flat broke.How can I possibly be selfish and do something for myself?8      Tonight is a rare occasion.Olly and I are in bed together  alone.Petal is fast asleep in the next room for once, and even the dog has stayed in his bed.We only rent this small, two up, two down, terraced house, but weve done our best to make it home.The landlord is very tolerant of our somewhat eclectic decorating style.All he says when he sees yet more of our handiwork is just make sure its all magnolia when you leave.Cant say fairer than that.On the downside, the house is on a busy main road so all our conversation has a backdrop of thundering traffic.On the upside, its just a short walk into the town centre  ten minutes max, which is just as well as neither Olly or I drive.Olly has actually passed his test whereas I havent.Sometimes he does a bit of van driving for friends for some extra cash, but we cant really afford to run a car.We own a slightly battered but much loved Vespa scooter as our sole mode of transport.Its not exactly practical now that weve got Petal  we cant exactly put a toddler on the back of a scooter  but Olly has owned it since he was nineteen and I think hed rather saw off one of his arms than part with it.He insists that it was his impressive skills on his scooter that made me fall in love with him.Even now, he and Petal sit and polish it together for hours on end.I snuggle down next to Olly.My shiny new handbag sits on the dressing table and Im admiring it by the light of the moon, watching the myriad colours as they glimmer.Phil said I should do something more with my life, I tell him.Like what?He said maybe art college.Olly makes a hmm noise in the dark.Is it a yes hmm or a no hmm?Cant be sure.Soooo, I took Petal into the college this afternoon, I continue.Just to see what they had on offer.I feel Olly sit up slightly.Youre seriously thinking about it?I really dont know, I admit.But it got me wondering.Maybe I shouldnt spend my life in a chip shop.But you love it.I do, I agree.But perhaps I could love something else more.I cant even begin to express how proud I am of the makeover at the chippy.It turned out so much better than Id expected.If I can do something like that in a weekend on a tiny budget, what else could I achieve if I really put my mind to it?I hoped Olly would understand that.Perhaps I should try to achieve something, be a better role model for Petal.Hmm.That noise again.We should both try to do more.Build a better life.Were doing OK.Were not, I remind him.Not really.We can barely make ends meet.Theres certainly nothing left over for luxuries.You cant want to spend the rest of your life in a pizza factory?I havent actually thought about it, Olly admits.Well, I have and I want to do something about it.The college have got an art and design foundation course starting in a couple of weeks.Ive already spoken to the admissions staff and theyve got a few places left.Olly sits bolt upright now and switches on the bedside light.Youre kidding me?No.How much is it?Now the hard part.Gulp.The best part of two and a half grand including materials and exam fees.Wow.Wow, indeed.Like the price of the handbag, I might as well have said a million pounds.Now its out, I rush on.It covers fine art, fashion, textiles, photography and print techniques.I confess that I havent been able to stop pouring over the brochure since I picked it up.What do you get at the end of it?Can you walk straight into a job?I dont know.Two and half grand is a heck of a lot of money for an I dont know.That I do know.Olly sighs.We simply dont have that kind of money, Nell.How would we manage?Would you have to give up your job?I might still be able to do some shifts.Im sure Phil would help me out as much as he could.After all it was him that put this idea in my head.Or, more accurately, gave it a voice.Wow, Olly says again and runs his hands through his hair.You have been giving this a lot of thought.Yes, I admit.I have.He puts his arm round me and pulls me close.Perhaps next year, he says.We can save up.I can do some extra work.I gaze up at him.You mean it?If its what you want to do.Theres no way we can possibly raise the cash in the next few weeks, but we should be able to do it in a year.I ignore the nagging little voice in my head that says how?Weve never had enough spare money to be able to save any.Whats going to be different from now on?Instead of questioning it further, I kiss him soundly.He likes the idea of me doing this course and thats enough for now.I love you.Mmm, he murmurs and leans over me.Just how much do you love me?Very, very much, I say in my best seductive voice as I ease myself beneath him.My lover plants soft kisses along my throat.Then our bedroom door bangs open.I cant sleep, Petal announces.Not now, Petalmeister!Olly cries.Unperturbed about interrupting her parents futile attempts at romance, our child stomps in.Theres a monster in my wardrobe and hes eating crisps.Loudly.Olly sighs, rolls off me and flops back on the bed while I stifle a giggle.Any passion that had been rising ebbs away.I need to get in bed with you.Now.Petal bounces onto the bed and pushes her way between us.When shes barged us both out of the way, she settles down in the middle.For a small person, she takes up an awful lot of room.The dog, clearly feeling left out, has broken free from the bounds of the kitchen and pelts up the stairs and leaps onto the bed too.Oh, Dude!Petal is never likely to have a baby brother or sister if things carry on this way.In a weary tone, Olly asks, Think you could cope with studying and a job and this?As I try to ease Petals elbow out of my ribs and move my leg so the dog doesnt give it pins and needles, I think I could.If I wanted it enough.9      I work solidly for four hours in Live and Let Fry.The queue is never less than ten deep.I am a lean, mean, chip dishing out machine.Frankly, Im lucky my eyes have stayed open.Petal has to be the wriggliest child in Christendom.I dont think either Olly or I got more than a couple of hours of kip.Shes got sharp elbows and sharp knees and uses them to good effect to get more room.Oh, the joys of parenthood.The only good thing is that she doesnt fart quite so much as the dog.At the chippy, we close the doors at four  our new regime until Phil can find an extra member of staff to take us right through until six when the evening shift normally starts.Sitting at one of the newly painted tables, I have a much needed cup of tea and a small helping of chips.Phil comes and sits opposite me with the same.I still cant believe how fantastic it looks in here, he says.Thanks, Nell.Dont start that again, I tease.Youll be making me so big headed I wont want to work here.He stirs a couple of spoonfuls of sugar into his tea, despite the fact that Constance is always nagging him to cut down.Did you think about what I said?he asks with an overcasual air.About art college or something?I did.That makes him sit up in surprise.I took myself down to the college and got a brochure on their art courses.Yeah?Phil now looks quite pleased with himself.Anything interesting?I take the brochure out of my pocket, open it at the wellthumbed page and push it towards him.Id like to do an art and design foundation course, I confide.I had a word with Olly and he thinks wed be able to afford it.Not this year, obviously, but maybe next.At that, Phil frowns.Its two and a half grand, Phil.We dont have that kind of cash lying around.In all honesty, we dont even have two and a half quid lying around.This years course starts in two weeks, which is way too soon.But now that Ive got a plan, we can start saving towards it.Let me lend you the money.No.I dismiss the suggestion with a wave of my hand.You cant possibly do that.I can.Phil puts his hand over mine.How would you get the money?Look at this place, he says.The takings are going up every week.I can manage it.I chew anxiously on my fingernails.Dont waste another year, Nell.Do it now while youre fired up.Wait a year and therell be all kinds of reasons why you cant do it.Bite the bullet.Now.They only had two places left when I spoke to them.They might have already gone.Constance and Jenny come and sit down with us.Constance sighs and kicks off her shoes with a grateful sigh.I bet even Ronald bloody McDonald isnt as busy as this.Phil grins.Im just telling Nell that she should go to art college.Wow, Nell, Jenny says.Thatd be cool.Its a scary amount of money, I point out.But it would get you out of here.No offence, Phil, she adds hastily.Phil rolls his eyes.None taken.You deserve to do well, girl, Constance offers.Look at this place, at what you can do.You can hardly call it a dump, Jen.Its like a palace.My friend pinches one of the bosss chips.Hes right, love.Youve got a real talent.Dont waste it here.Now Im racked with indecision.Id agreed with Olly that Id wait, but something inside of me has started to burn and I want to break out now while I have the chance.For the first time in my life, I feel passionate about doing something.It thrills me and it frightens me.Could this be how ambition feels?I suck in a wobbly breath.I dont know.Phone the college, Phil insists.See if theyve got a place left.If they have, then its fate or whatever that stuff is that you women know all about.A frisson of excitement sweeps over me.Shall I?Go on, Phil urges.What have you got to lose?Just do it.Just do it.Do it, do it, do it!Jen sings in the style of The Black Eyed Peas.Constance gives me a nudge.Go on, Nell.I wish Id had the chance when I was your age.And do you know, thats what does it.As much as I love Constance, would I want to be in her shoes?Do I still want to be working in a chip shop when Im coming up to retirement?Im thirty next year.Thats not getting any younger in anyones book and maybe I should be getting a move on.Mind made up, I take my mobile out of my pocket.Phil reads out the number from the brochure as I punch it in with trembling fingers.They answer within seconds, instead of it going to voicemail or something, and I should take that as a sign too.I speak to the woman on the other end realising that Im babbling.Moments later I hang up.Phil, Jenny and Constance all stare at me, holding their breath with anticipation.They had one place left, I say.Im in.They go crazy and cheer and kiss me and hug me.Phil hugs me the hardest.Our eyes meet.Thanks, I say to him.Thanks so much.
