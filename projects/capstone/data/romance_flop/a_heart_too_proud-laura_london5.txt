Im sorry for bringing that whole crew in on you like that.You werent really prepared for company and I feel as though I played bad cricket.Cecilia insisted on coming over to pay her respects to you, and Godfrey, bless his meager brain, seems to have developed a tendresse for you, but I really think the whole scene was engineered by Lady Catherine.Shell miss no opportunity to get close to the marquis.Christopher, you dont have to apologize.How were you to know I was making black pudding?How did the rest of the visit go?Godfrey is learning how to chew tobacco, and he was making everyone sick.He spat, by accident, on the hem of Lady Catherines gown and that pretty much finished off the afternoon.Imagine a clod like that thinking you would have any time for the likes of him, muttered Christopher.Actually, I would rather talk to Godfrey than make blood pudding.I would rather make blood pudding than talk to Godfrey, he said.That is what you think, I said.And he was off.Christopher is a good friend, I thought to myself as he rode away.It was getting very close to the time our play was to be presented, and I ceased worrying for a time about smugglers, bodyguards, and other such exciting things.As the time drew near, I wouldnt have noticed if the Corsican Bandit and the entire French army marched right through our cottage and out by way of the chimney, hobnails and all.In fact, I wished that would happen because I could have used them as extras in the play.Thats the single mindedness of an enthusiast for you!As I surveyed the finished stage on the afternoon before the play, I felt a glow of pride at the results of our labors.We had erected scaffolding that served as the foundation for our sets on the gentle slope of common land next to Mudbury hamlet.The playgoers would bring their own coverlets or stools for seating and the parish ladies had set up a stand that would be stocked with plum cakes and brown ale.Shade for the spectators was generously provided by a holm oak and several pear trees, now in full flower.The huge piece of lumber that the blacksmith had given us had made a most successful transformation into a man o war, circa 1066.My sisters had gotten Janes brother, who was good at such things, to carve it and then theyd all painted the frame with loving care, right down to the mermaid figurehead who modestly clutched a spray of nodding daisies over her bosom.Caro was just now adding the finishing stitches to the sails, which were made from the same canvas on which we had painted the backdrops.The pice de rsistance, however, was behind the stage foundation.It had been Christophers inspiration to build a small firework that he would ignite just before the scene in which William was crowned in London, when the Norman army was celebrating.We were enthralled with the idea.Surely the most jaded audience could not help being thrilled by so dramatic a stunt.Christopher assured us that he had made firecrackers like this many times before and that it could be done with perfect safety.The only thing left for me to worry about was whether or not the noble Norman knight, Sir Hugh of Montfort, the wheelwrights son, could bring himself to the sticking point and plunge his javelin into King Harold.Today, during our final rehearsal, he had broken down at the crucial moment when I, as King Harold, was to die on the battlefield.The ferocious Sir Hugh had flung himself off the stage and cried: I cant do it!I just cant stab Elizabeth!You have to stab me.It is very important to the plot that you stab me, or else the Saxons would have won the battle and the Norman conquest would never have been!William the Conqueror would be just plain Bill!Sir Hugh evidently had no respect for history.He opened his mouth and wailed, But I cant stab Elizabeth.She is too sweet!It took the efforts of our entire cast, alternately cajoling and threatening, to convince our savage Norman to trod the boards again.Christopher finally won the day by taking the poor boy aside and explaining, Tomorrow, in the real play, Elizabeth will look like a soldier instead of a girl.She will be dressed in soldiers clothes and will be wearing a fake beard.She will be much more killable.Mrs.Coleman had finished our costumes but she wouldnt let us wear them in rehearsal, as it had been such a task constructing them.I walked to the back of the scaffolding, to see Christopher standing, hands on hips, regarding his newly finished rocket with great satisfaction.Thomas, the new groom who had been drafted as Kits assistant on the project, stood nearby with a slightly disloyal look of doubt on his face.I dont know, muttered Thomas in pessimistic accents.You say itll work but I dont know.Christopher threw a converting grin his way.Are you doubting, Thomas?Course it will workjust a matter of getting the proper ratio of gunpowder.Well, ratios of gunpowder sound very scientific to me, I said, coming up to the two inventors.I handed each a mug of ale, informing them that Mrs.Blakslee had sent down a tray for all the able workers.Kit bore me off to keep him company in the shade while he drank his ale, saying as he did: No question of it, Lizabeth.Were going to have a hit on our hands tomorrow.Church committeell erect a plaque in your honor when they count the vast sums brought into the church coffers by the Norman Conquest.Right, I said, entering into the spirit of this.And the plaque will read: God makes the bees and the bees make honey; the congregation does all the work but the church makes all the money.Ah, go ahead and laugh, I hope that we dont both end up in hell for sacrilege.Never!Nothing but a rowboat across the River Styx will do for a little heathen like you.Christophers voice was still unsteady with laughter.Oh, Lord, what an adorable girl you are.If you could see the look on your face now!You make me want to He stopped suddenly and flushed.Oh, dear, you poor little thing.You can hardly help being so beautiful, can you?Deeply embarrassed, I begged him to hush again.We sat quietly on the grass for a while then, Kit taking long pulls of ale and I letting a faint rustle of breeze fan the heat from my cheeks.Presently I turned back to my friend.Kit, I know you dont like me to bring this up but I cant help worrying that someone somewhere isnt going to like you appearing in a public theatrical.Lord Dearborne may be so angry he wont let us be friends anymore.Mrs.Goodbody told me that the aristocracy considers actors to be, well, disreputable or something like that.Dont tease yourself about it, mdear.Being in one parish play doesnt rank one as a professional actor.Its all for a good cause, right?And, for your information, Uncle Nicky is well aware of the fact that Im going to be in the play and hasnt made any objection, so you see hes not as top lofty as you thought.Besides, why should he want to interfere with our friendship?I daresay he thinks you should have grander friends.Ones that he likes.He likes you, Elizabeth, Christopher said with a reminiscent grin.Just the other day he said you have a certain whimsical charm so I shouldnt let myself get carried away and dishonor you, because you were a lady.There, that shows he likes you, doesnt it?No!You dont have to shout at me, Im not deaf, yknow.Maybe thats not the same as saying he likes you, but compared to Uncle Nickys usual opinion of women thats pretty high praise, I can tell you.You should hear the things he says about Lady Cat; not but what they are true.Christopher took a long pull from his tankard.Sides he didnt ask you to dance at the Macreadys party.That shows you, doesnt it?I grabbed up a handful of convenient grass and tossed it at Christopher.He put a hand hastily over his brew.Since when is it customary to express ones liking for another by not dancing with them?I may not know much about the beau monde but that is doing it a bit brown.Its true for all that.He was brushing the grass out of his soft brown hair.Young girl, living on his estate, under his protection, as it were; if he started paying attention to you in public its bound to start the tabbies talking.Lord, all he has to do is look at a woman to get the gossip mills grindingfor you, it would be fatal, believe me.I daresay that he would have liked to dance with you, too, stands to reason.I mean, a dashed beautiful girl and light as a feather in the bargain.See?No, I dont see, I said crossly.You know what you are, Kit?You are an apologist!No!said Christopher, revolted.Yes, I returned ruthlessly.And whats more, it wont work.Ill wager that Lord Dearborne has no more liking for me thanthan for that wild looking horse he rides.Very fond of his horses, Uncle Nicky is, said Christopher, feeble yet pursuing.*** The next morning, the twins had me out of bed before the sun was up.They were shivering with excitement and I made every effort to calm them for fear they would forget their lines in their agitated state.I had little success.They were still chattering nervously when we were backstage donning our costumes, shortly before curtain time.I let my own hair hang down, in the old Saxon way, and put on a false beard.The Saxon women wore pastel gunnas with their hair braided with bits of colored glass.The Norman soldiers were clean shaven (no false beards), and clip headed, and wore white tunics with wide sleeves and embroidered edging.Kit made a stunning William the Conqueror.He looked as if he could conquer the whole world, let alone Saxon England.Caro peeped through the curtain and drew back in openmouthed astonishment.Theres millions of people out there, she whispered.It was time for the play to begin.It is impossible to describe the whole play because it lasted over two hours, but I would like to mention some of my favorite highlights.Christopher exceeded all his rehearsals when he gave his long speech to his army urging them to join him on his voyage of conquest.Then came the voyage of the Norman invasion fleet across the English Channel.This is where the man o war came in.Handles had been attached to the stage side of the boat and the feet showing underneath were not too obvious as the sailors carried it against an aquatic blue background.Adding to the illusion was a cutout in the approximate shape of a seagull which was lowered from above the canvas and wiggled back and forth to suggest the illusion of flight.The boat came to a jarring halt at center stage and a ladder was brought up, which the soldiers mounted and then climbed down, thereby disembarking and landing on English soil.A chorus of satisfying boos rose from the audience at this point.This was a tricky maneuver because the soldiers had to climb over the side of the ship by climbing first on the backs of the sailors, who crouched down behind the ship facade out of sight of the audience.The night before the Battle of Hastings came off even better than I had expected.First we showed the dour Normans, led by a solemn Christopher, spending the night offering fasts and paternosters in pious groupings around an altar of holy relics.On the other side of the stage, the Saxons were whooping it up, draining flagons supposedly full of hard liquor with cries of Bottoms to the sky!At one point, I, as King Harold, cried Bring me my wench, and a soldier led to me a simpering Caro, whom I greeted with a hearty buss on the cheek.I am afraid I maligned poor King Harold, but the scene was a crowd pleaser.At this point, William the Conqueror buried his head in his hands as if in an ecstasy of prayer, because Christopher found it hard to contain his laughter.The battle scene went off smoothly, or as smoothly as a battle scene possibly could.Hugh of Montfort managed to cast the fatal javelin and I fell to the stage, twitching and writhing in my death throes, and Christopher cried, Frenchmen, strike; the day is ours!After the battle was over, Mrs.Goodbody made a surprise appearance as Edith Swansneck, Harolds mistress, who was brought to the scene to identify Harolds remains.A roar of appreciation came from the crowd as she took the stage.I was dragged from the scene in ignominious defeat, and watched the celebrations of the jubilant Normans from the wings.I was visited there by the Marquis of Lome.He came up behind me, giving me quite a start.When he spoke, I turned to see a light smile playing over his lips.A production worthy of the Globe Theatre in the days of the Immortal Bard, he said.I curtseyed in my bloodstained battle dress, and said, I appreciate the compliment from a sophisticated theatergoer like yourself.Wasnt Mrs.Goodbody an adorable Edith Swansneck?Quite charming, really.I saw you open one eye and peek when they were discovering your mutilated corpse.I was not peeking.I take great care not to peek.Christopher tried to make me laugh by blowing on my cheek when he leaned over my body, but I wouldnt do it.Where is Christopher the Conqueror now?he asked.Hes made a firecracker that is going to go off in celebration of Williams coronation.I think he went to light it; he wouldnt let anyone else take on that responsibility.Where is he?With lightning speed his hands were on my shoulders.Quickly.I was bewildered by his urgency, but I told him as soon as I could choke out the words.Lord Dearborne left the stage at a run.I followed him, and saw, about twenty yards away, Christopher lighting the firecracker.The fuse had caught.I was now totally confused.The marquis shouted something incomprehensible to Christopher, reaching him in a great bound, grabbing him and pushing him across the yard.I was still following, moving toward Christopher to see what in the world was going on, when the marquis grabbed me too, and pushed us both onto the ground behind a tree with such force that my breath was knocked away.There was a very loud explosion then, followed by a rain of leaves, twigs, and clods of dirt.We stood and looked back toward the site of the explosion.The earth was scorched and smoking ten yards in every direction.Far above us was a dazzling display of shooting fire in the sky.The noise of the blast had temporarily deafened me, but I could still make out the cheering of the audience, who naturally thought the tremendous blast was all part of the play.But if Christopher had stayed where he was, he would have been blown to crumbs.There were tears of fright in my eyes as I turned to Christopher and my voice trembled as I said: I thought you said that this was perfectly safe, Christopher.If it hadnt been for Lord Dearborne, you would have been killed.Christopher scrambled to his feet and drew me up beside him.He was looking almost as confused as I.  I swear that when I checked the thing over yesterday afternoon, it was completely intact.There was enough powder in there to make one tenth of that blast.Just enough for a loud pop and fizzle.Kit looked up uncertainly into his guardians eyes.I had never seen Lord Dearborne look so grim before.Kit, he said, taking Christopher by the arm, did you leave that rocket out here overnight?Well, yes, it was on the platform and I didnt want to move it The confusion left his face.Someone must have tampered with it.Someone trying to kill me.Nine Kit was right about one thingour play was a howling success, if you can measure success in numbers of people telling you that they have never enjoyed themselves more.I had never enjoyed myself less.The blast from the altered bomb was a mere peep when compared to the explosion that came afterward.Lord Dearborne expressed himself with great eloquence on his general impression of our maturity and intelligence, which, I might add, was not favorable.It was a speech that would have done credit to a ships captain facing a mutinous crew, and Kit and I were effectively cowed, at least until the marquis was out of hearing distance.That night I was the victim of insomnia again.How could I sleep, worrying who had tampered with our rocket?It had to be someone who knew about the firecracker in advance.Someone connected with the play.Unthinkable.Id known all those people since I took my first steps.Oh, there was Thomas, of course, but I remembered that he knew nothing about bombs; surely it would have taken someone with a certain skill to make it so deadly?And Thomas was recommended by Dr.Brent.Whatever my personal opinion of the man, there could be no doubt of a doctors honesty.My mind kept jumping back to the man that Id first seen in the church crypt at Dyle, the man Id christened Monsieur Sacre Bleu.That he was up to no good Im sure of, but murder?I wondered where he was now.I discussed all my speculations with Christopher, who listened patiently but told me that I should leave the matter in the hands of Lord Dearborne and the other men from the War Office.A suggestion that we should make a secretive trip to the crypt of the Dyle church to search for further suspicious characters was vetoed with startling vehemence.Elizabeth, aint one crack on the head enough for you?Cant understand how such a gentle girl can be so heedlessly adventurous.These are ruthless men who wouldnt think twice about wringing a neck or three, even as pretty a one as yours.Dont like to tell you things that will frighten you, but you seem to be set on getting involved in this whole thing, and Ive got to scare you away for your own good.Whoever fiddled with the firecracker obviously thought it was a golden opportunity, but if they were really serious about knocking me off, they would have waylaid me long ago.They were just taking advantage of my own stupidity.When I was mulling over his statements that afternoon as I wiped the cottage candlesticks, I was interrupted by a bustling Mrs.Goodbody.Oh, theres so much to do, so much to do, she was saying.Well, whatever it is that needs doing I will certainly help you all I can, I promised cheerfully.I have been to see His Lordship today, she puffed.We are to pull up tents and go off to London with him.London?When?Why?I gasped.We are to leave as soon as we can make ready, she said.His Lordship only said we are all to have a taste of the Corinthian culture.Its probably a hum, guessed Christa, who was seated on our oak table, swinging her legs in the air and munching a peach snitched from the squires hothouse.Lord Dearborne isnt going to take an awkward squad like us to London with him.Off the table, Miss Mischief.If you sit on the table, youll be married before youre able.And I can see youve been stealing from the squires closed garden again, Mrs.Goodbody sighed.You get out the Bible right now and read Gods holy Ten Commandments to see what the Lord has to say on the subject.When you say the Lord, do you mean Lord Dearborne, Mrs.Goodbody?asked Christa, a perfect picture of pert.Ive said it before and Ill say it again.Theres nothing in the world so difficult as getting decent manners from a thirteen year old, said Mrs.Goodbody, with resignation.But Mrs.Goodbody, I interrupted impatiently, thereby proving that nineteen year olds dont always have very good manners either.Are we really going to London?Is Christopher coming too?Are we going to stay there for a long time?Yes.Yes.And no.Its only for a couple of weeks or so.Roger is bringing the admirals old trunks down from the attic for us to pack in.Oh dear, I havent had to pack like this since the last time the admiral went off on a sea voyage.Elizabeth, I can see that you have an eager I want to help Mrs.Goodbody look on your face, but I promise you that my heads in such a whirl that Ill do better just now all by myself.Why dont you run along outside and get a little country sunshine while you can?My head was in a bit of a whirl itself, so I went off in search of Christopher to see what information might be gleaned from him.I tiptoed into Barfrestly through the kitchen door, after assuring myself, as always, that the marquis was nowhere about.I found Christopher quickly.He was stretched full length on a lounging couch in the library, reading a tattered copy of Turf side Companion with rapt interest.He tossed it aside and sat up as I flew in at him.Christopher, Christopher!London, London!Is it true?Elizabeth, Elizabeth!Yes, yes!I can tell you are excited because you sound like an echo.Why are we going?Why is the marquis making us go along?He got the royal summons from our illustrious Prince Regent.We are to be there for two weeks.He didnt feel that he could leave us alone here under the circumstances, nefarious characters about and all that.Youll love London; a person can have a great many adventures in town.The capital of Western civilization.But I wont know anyone there except for you, I said dejectedly.And youll probably be out gaming and socializing with the people you already know there.You certainly wont have much time to show me around.Its not that I wouldnt love to take you around, said Christopher, but I do have a more suitable companion for you while you are there.My sister Anne is going to chaperone you.Her husbands out of England on an embassy mission.Shes had to stay on their country estate but will come to town to stay at Lorne.Shes all the crack in London town, and as thick as grass with Lady Sefton.Just the one to introduce you into society.Who is Lady Sefton?I asked doubtfully.She is one of the haughty patronesses at Almacks.Almacks is a private club for the haute monde.If they dont give you the nod there you may as well turn in your christening papers and withdraw all pretensions to the smart life.Ive never had any pretensions to the smart life and the thought of it makes me shake to the tips of my fingers.Dont you think that I could just stay here at Barfrestly?I think that Ill just be in the way if I come.How will your sister feel, having me foisted upon her?Theres no question of foisting.I told her all about you in my last letter to her and shes dying to meet you.But if youd rather not go, then why dont you just go and tell Lord Dearborne that you disagree with his decision?Yes, and while Im at it why dont I give him some advice on national diplomatic policy?Youre really a humorist.The grin that greeted this shot showed me that Christopher knew very well that I wasnt about to seek out the marquis and blithely tell him the what for.Besides, I harbored no sincere desire to be told to stay at Barfrestly.I have wanted to visit London all of my life.Who has not?I could hardly contain my excitement for the three days that it took to complete the trip preparations.It seemed impossible that I could really be going to London, and I was ready at any moment for some mischance to intervene that would make it necessary to cancel the trip.I could hardly believe my senses when I sat in the marquiss well sprung traveling coach on the morning of our departure.My sisters, Mrs.Goodbody, and I were to ride in this comfortable vehicle while Christopher and Lord Dearborne rode beside us on their overspirited stallions.I watched with something approaching awe as Lord Dearborne gracefully retained his seat when his mount made a particularly determined effort to rid himself of his rider.Afterward I heard Lord Dearborne casually tell Christopher that Jupiter was a bit playful this morning.About as playful as a hell hag.Ill never understand why people enjoy riding the backs of such skittish, writhing, restless creatures.In the last century they say the roads were so filled with potholes and bumplets as to make travel troublesome, if not a downright penance.But Parliament has since permitted turnpike companies to collect tolls in return for maintaining the roads in good repair, so modern travel is quick and comfortable.As I looked out the coach window at the tamed Kentish landscape I felt the thrill of a sightseer discovering new vistas.This was not a feeling that Id been privileged to enjoy many times before in my somewhat restricted life, and it put me in a state which Mrs.Goodbody rather unflatteringly referred to as a pucker.My sisters and I bounced around the carriage, pointing out minor landmarks to one another, telling each other riddles, and leaning perilously out the coach window to talk to Christopher.We did suffer a minor delay just outside of Maidstone when a flock of sheep took temporary possession of the roadway, to the frustration of the drivers of several natty vehicles.Mrs.Goodbody asked the marquis if we might have permission to stretch our legs while the roadway was being cleared of the fleecy invaders, so Caro, Christa, Cleo, and I set out on a narrow path through a golden wheatfield.Cleo led the way and Caro tagged behind, picking quantities of wild plants.Christopher was standing holding the bridle of his horse, talking with Lord Dearborne and Mrs.Goodbody in the shade of the coach, when we returned.Caro laid her collection of foliage down in the middle of this group and demanded that I identify every leaf and blade.Um.Lets see This is timothyits an edible hay.That is, edible for horses and the likenot for you.I continued my perusal of the wilting specimens.See this arching stem?Tis Solomons Seal, which has small white flowers when it blooms, which isnt very often.Christa kicked a large branch with the toe of her new kid boots.Whats this, Lizbeth?Caro certainly did bring a big bunch of it.I regarded the shiny sinister leaves.Angels of faith defend us!Caros been picking in a burnweed patch.Oh, my poor little dear, leaflets three, let them be, dont you recall?Lord Dearborne earned Mrs.Goodbodys warmly expressed gratitude by transporting us promptly to an inn where we bathed Caros skin with gentle industry to arrest the effects of the irritating weed.As the hour passed, it became evident that it was already too late.Caros arms had become painfully swollen and one soft cheek was slightly puffy where a leaf must have brushed against it.It was decided in a conference between Mrs.Goodbody and the marquis that we would stay the day at the inn and continue on in the morning, after Caro had recovered from the most acute miseries of her botanical malaise.After Mrs.Goodbody and I shared a lunch in Caros sunny bedroom, Christa made several praiseworthy attempts to amuse her by tossing her afflicted twin my sawdust pincushion.Unfortunately, they were so noisy as to attract the disapproving notice of the occupant of the next room, who sent us, via a giggling chambermaid, an unfriendly request to quiet down.So Mrs.Goodbody enlisted the offices of Christopher to play a calm game of beggar my neighbor with Caro, and sent Christa and me out to take a walk.I was happy for the chance to explore, and I pulled off my traveling dress and slipped into a powder blue gown of taffeta gauze.Impatiently threading a fine velvet ribbon through my hair, I hoped that Mrs.Goodbody wouldnt catch me before I got outside and make me don a bonnet on this warm day.I see that Im a bad influence on my sisters, because when Christa met me at the front door, I saw that she had also shed her traveling bonnet in defiance of Mrs.Goodbodys edict that we should look like ladies at all times.We shared one conspiratorial glance and snuck rather guiltily out the backyard of the inn, past the stone built stable, toward the blooming cherry orchard.I had just stopped to pat an obsequious barn cat when Lord Dearborne came around the corner of the stables.I suppose that I should be used to seeing him by now, but Im afraid that his looks still stun me a bit each time.Wishing that Christa hadnt gone quite so far ahead of me, I set the kitten gently on the ground and walked woodenly by the marquis with my eyes focused on the ground, uttering Good afternoon, Milord, in my most repelling accents.Apparently they werent too repelling, because Lord Dearborne came to walk alongside me.Has Mrs.Goodbody sent you out for a walk?I thought that it would come to that.The good landlord confessed to me that the noise from your bedchamber had gotten so loud that several guests asked of him if he had begun permitting orgies in his chambers.I suppose that I had better accompany you to see that you dont encounter any of the smugglers, spies or corpses who throw themselves at your dainty feet wherever they trod.I compressed my lips tightly and quickened my pace, still looking downward.So shy today, Elizabeth?I remember once under a honeysuckle bush when you were warmer!I stopped dead in my tracks and looked straight up into his face, gasping like a grounded trout.Of all the unkind things you have said to me, that really takes the tribute!To remind me of something of which Im so ashamed that I couldnt even tell Mrs.Goodbody.I can be thankful for that.Id really be in the stew if Mrs.Goodbody discovered that Id been making improper advances toward you.Lord Dearborne looked totally unrepentant, though his eyes were softened by an amusement that was seductively tender.I swallowed angrily and continued walking in silence.We came out of the orchard onto a daisy covered hillside dotted with sun warmed boulders.I turned to Lord Dearborne again.My voice sounded strange to my ears as I said: Is this some game you like to play, seducing country girls in the afternoon?Pray, what do you do with your mornings?Seduce city girls.No, dont run away from me now.I had made a movement away from him, but his arm had shot out to imprison my wrist ruthlessly.What youd really like to do is to stay here and tell me what an unconscionable libertine I am.Come, why hold back?Because I dont want to fight with you.How can I fight with you when youre so much better at this than I am?When I like people, then I want to be friends with them.And when I dont like them, then I try to understand why.But you make these complicated approaches filled with innuendos and subtleties that I cant understand and you arouse feelings in me that I dont understand either.All I know is that its not gentlemanly of you to deliberately try towell, confuse me in that way when you dont care a pin about me and Ill probably end up being hurt.Listen, infant, if I wasnt gentlemanly, you would have been deflowered a month ago.I am not a great lover of missish behavior, but I must admit that at that moment it would have been nice to faint.I felt the blood come blistering hot to my cheeks.For pitys sake It was a miserable bleat and must have touched him for his face lost some of its grimness.His hands, friendly now, pushed me carefully down to sit on a convenient boulder.Pet, Im sorry.That was ill said of me.I make a much better guardian for lively youths than beautiful innocents.His voice sounded not unkind; even, to my surprise, a little rueful.Im very conscious that if I had encouraged you to trust me you would have taken my advice and not left Barfrestly unprotected on the afternoon that you were struck.Its hardly your own fault that you dont inspire paternal sentiments in me and there is no reason why you should suffer for it.He paused, glancing up the hillside.Look up there.Your intrepid sister is gathering another armful of plants.I hope to God that she learned to distinguish burnweed this morning!For a few moments we sat listening to the light wind whispering through the nodding daisies.A nesting warbler ventured a few bars of tuneful song.Elizabeth, was the man that you followed through Mudbury the same man that you saw in the church crypt at Dyle?Somehow, the question didnt surprise me.I knew that Christopher confided most things in Lord Dearborne, and would probably have told him about the incident in Dyle.The marquis looked fully capable of putting two and two together.Yes, he was the same man.Thats why I followed him.I was afraid that he was coming to Mudbury to hush me up so that I couldnt identify him.Everyone says that the smugglers are very ruthless and will murder you without so much as a by your leave.A grin played around the corners of Lord Dearbornes mouth.So naturally, seeing such a dangerous character, you set off in hot pursuit?Why did you call him Monsieur Sacre Bleu?Thats what he said.When I bumped into him in the crypt, he swore Sacre bleu.I made my voice low and guttural and repeated the curse.He said it just like that.Do you want to know what I think?He nodded a respectful assent.I think that he was French.And whats more, I think that he has something to do with spying for Napoleon because its said that the smugglers sometimes abet the spies.Henris death, Monsieur Sacre Bleu and the bomb at the playI think theyre tied together in some way.Um, you may be right.Ill pass the information on to the War Department.Youre laughing at me now.I think this is a very serious situation.Exactly, my indomitable infant.Which is why the less you have to do with the whole thing the better.Christa came down the hill to sit nearby, and began braiding daisies into a crown which she soon arranged into my hair.You know what else I think?I think that youve heard of Monsieur Sacre Bleu before, because you didnt seem too surprised when I described him to you after I was hit on the head.Furthermore, the reason that he came to Mudbury wasnt to kill me because he would have done it when I was lying there unconscious if he had wanted to.Which means Which means you should regard one knock on the head as a warning to refrain from meddling in what you have shrewdly divined to be a very serious business.Lord Dearborne sighed.Its hard to believe that such a stubborn disposition could lodge in such a sweet little body.Only conceive of my feelings upon discovering you unconscious in the spinny.You probably thought Aha, an excellent opportunity for some wenching,  I said as sternly as I could.I slid down to sit at the base of the boulder and curled my knees up under me.You think that because you are the male authority (as Kit would say), that you can selfishly keep all the mystery to yourself?Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?quoted the marquis with a grin.Do you think you can flummox me with a little schoolboy Latin?In heavenly minds can such resentments dwell?I translated, scornfully.Yes, they can, except that my mind isnt heavenly in the least.And I am still worried about Christopher.He says that hes not in danger, but I dont know if I can believe him.You both seem convinced that I am unable to bear the full force of the truth.Elizabeth, why is it so impossible for you to place a little faith in my ability to protect you and Kit?Youll be perfectly safe as long as you go nowhere without an escort.He paused to pluck off a caterpillar that had ventured onto the hem of my gown.I lay the whole problem directly at the door of Mudburys vicar.He should have spent less time filling you with the exciting adventures of Jason and Odysseus and more time on the virtues of obedience.Did you never learn the parable of Pandoras box?I only want to protect you, Elizabeth.I felt my old companion, the resentment gargoyle, dig his claws tightly into my shoulder.Before you came to Barfrestly, Milord, I never needed any protection.Ten London, London!It was evening when we arrived and the town twinkled with a million lights.The streets were filled with an astounding array of coaches, wagons, and light sporting vehicles.The chairmen carried flambeaus which lit their faces eerily as they threaded their way through crowds of pedestrians and hawkers with portable stalls.I saw one girl pushing a tipsy cart filled with pots of blooming flowers all a blowin and all a growin.The dignified men in plush breeches, tailed coats, and powdered wigs were footmen, or so Christopher informed us.He wasnt so forthcoming with information about an old lady in a long duffle coat with a group of dressed up young ladies in tow who stood talking to a group of sailors on one street corner.Shocking, I heard Mrs.Goodbody pronounce, though I saw Christopher hide a smile when Christa guessed they might all be in a school of some kind.It seemed incredible to me that there could be such a broad expanse of buildings and people.The same space in Kent would have covered many villages, marsh, thousands of acres of farmland, and a forest or two.But here were just rows of houses and mobs of people, all looking worried and hurried, rushing here and there, and none of them seeming to mind a whit the foul state of the air they were breathing.It made my eyes water.The whole experience of driving into London made the possibilities of riots, wars, starvation, and disease so much more real.The walls were covered with posters lampooning people I had only heard about in a very distant fashion, people like Prinny, whom I had known only as the Prince Regent and Boney Napoleon Bonaparte.I had heard how unemployment was a problem, and now I understood.How could there ever be enough jobs to go around among so many people?Indeed, I did see more than a few thin, dirty, and shabbily dressed.And though there were houses row upon row, Christopher told me that he had read once in a republican leaflet that as many as twenty thousand Londoners were without any shelter whatever and slept under bridges and in parks.Some poor families lived in a single room.Families even shared rooms.Christa and Caro were reading out of a guidebook.Listen to this, Elizabeth.It says a man who saunters about the capital with pockets on the outside of his coat deserves no pity.What does that mean?Hes talking about pickpockets, said Christopher.They take things right from your pockets while youre not looking if youre not careful.Why do they do that?asked Christa.I suppose because they dont have anything of their own, said Christopher simply.You have to watch out for them all.This includes street thugs, footpads, housebreakers, and counterfeiters.And I do hope to frighten you.Even where we will be staying, at the marquiss house in Mayfair, you are never to go out alone, even in the daytime, without being accompanied by at least a footman or a maid.That is the rule for anyone living in London.The twins were awed by that last bit of information, but I thought it to be one more of the marquiss surveillance rules.We were now entering a different area of the city, in which streets were not as crowded, and the atmosphere seemed more sedate.People were moving at not such a rapid pace and the houses were larger and better kept.What area is this, Kit?I asked.This is Mayfair.We are getting closer to Uncle Nickys humble quarters.The carriage finally stopped in a well kept square lined with genteel mansions whose windows winked candlelight.We stepped down from the carriage into a spacious forecourt and could glimpse the handsome facade of Lorne House through a beautiful row of plane trees.Mrs.Goodbody looked approvingly up at the trees, murmuring reassuringly to us that if London had such trees then it couldnt be all bad.I needed all the reassurance that I could get because the thought of crossing His Lordships elegant threshold made me feel like a mule at the milliners.Just as I was playing about with the idea of crawling back to hide in the coach, the highly finished hardwood door in the mansions porched entrance flew open and a tall girl wreathed in smiles and jade taffeta came gliding into the graveled courtyard.She dispensed loving hugs to Christopher and Lord Dearborne, who received the embrace in a surprisingly fatherly spirit.Even before I heard Lord Dearborne introducing her to Mrs.Goodbody, I realized that this was Lady Anne Crawford, Christophers fashionable sister.Their family resemblance was strongest in their manners, which were frank, positive, and unaffectedly friendly.Lady Anne had Christophers soft sable colored eyes and shining brown hair.But here the resemblance ended.In Lady Anne, Christophers classical features were replaced by a wide stretch of mouth and a tiny button nose that seemed totally inadequate for all that girl.Actually, since shes closer to thirty, perhaps girl is undignified.But so she strikes one.She took my hands in a kindly grip as we were introduced, continuing with the vivacious chatter that she had begun.Christopher, you told me she was a beauty, but there are degrees, you wretch.You should have warned me that I was about to be presented with the task of chaperoning Venus come to earth!she said.She turned to me.My dear child, I dont know if youre going to love London or not, but I can quite safely guarantee that London is going to love you!With this lavish assessment, she swept us into the house with promises of tea, bathing water, and restful bedchambers.We crossed the marble floor of a graceful entrance hall, and climbed the central staircase to the first floor.My sisters leaned perilously over the flow of wrought iron handrail, the better to view the subdued design in the stained glass fanlight set over the main doorway.My bedroom matched the tone of the rest of Lorne House, graciously luxurious with an exquisite lightness of detail.The walls were hung in Wedgewood blue and cream damask, and the colors appeared again throughout the room.After my little cot, surely I would be lost in the lovely canopied bed hung in blistered satin!The rest of the room was furnished richly but sparsely, giving an airy, spacious feeling.Even my fantasies of life in a marquiss mansion had not been audacious enough to imagine this.The greatest hit with the twins turned out to be a little room adjoining their chamber, which someone had discreetly decided to name a water closet.I must say it is a marvelous invention, though I have never heard of such a thing before and if you dont have one, I can heartily recommend its installation!Also, to my amazement, a friendly ladys maid came to help me prepare for dinner.Imagine, Elizabeth Cordell with a real ladys maid!She helped me to choose a clinging gown of watered bisque silk that she promised was just the thing for informal dining, and coaxed my hair into a casual tumble of dancing curls.Ooo, miss, dont you look something like!she enthused.Never before had I looked quite so fashionable.I was so excited that I gave the little maid a swift hug which almost prostrated her from shock.I was to await Lady Annes escort to the dining parlor, but decided immediately against so tame a course.Slowly, and giving myself monstrous airs, I descended the stairway to the first floor.Smiling and inclining my head graciously, I curtseyed deeply to the well kept portraits that lined the walls.Men in Elizabethan ruffs, powdered wigs, and sparkling jewels stared haughtily back at me, with the vivid blue eyes of the marquis.Curiously, like an inquisitive mouse, I poked my head into one high ceilinged reception room after the next.Shining velvet and satin draperies, glinting crystal, and islands of exotic carpets set off the delicately carved and graceful furniture.It was like a place out of a dream.The double doors to the grand salon on the first floor stood open and I ventured cautiously inside, hardly able to believe that I would not be ejected as an intruder at any moment.Crossing the high polish parquetry floor (much too lovely to be walked on), I came to the huge bay windows that overlooked the square, now twinkling with a hundred candlelit windows.I felt rather dwarfed by all this magnificence.Lord Dearborne came in to join me, the perfect foil for his exquisite surroundings.I was admiring the view, Milord, I offered nervously.Yes, the view is enchanting this evening.The smile that swept me was lazily appreciative.Were you shocked by your first glimpse of the wicked pace of London life?The bustle in the streets, you mean?It made me dizzy but its so peaceful here that it might be an evening at Barfrestly.Except that here is rather more incredible.Its like a palace, I confided shyly.His smile was, for once, quite kind.I felt my self confidence increase accordingly.Ive had so much excitement at Barfrestly lately that London may well be dull in comparison.Ive been here several hours already without one person trying to knock me on the head, blow me up, or toss me across the front of their saddle, I said, for a little practice at repartee.If London gets too dull, let me know and Ill try to arrange some excitement for you, promised Lord Dearborne, giving me a look that demonstrated that it is better to practice ones repartee with less dangerous partners.Lady Anne joined us then, and Christopher.I had been dreading my first dinner in this exalted company.My sisters were dining in their room tonight with an early bedtime, and Mrs.Goodbody ate belowstairs with the marquiss servants.At first I was upset by the notion of taking my meals away from her, but when I suggested that I could eat downstairs too, she vetoed the idea with such horror that I dared not mention it again.
