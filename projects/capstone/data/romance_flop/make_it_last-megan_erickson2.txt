On the field, they could read body language so well, theyd been called The Wall.No ball got past Ames and Ruiz.Hell, theyd taken Paradise to the Maryland state championship senior year.As much as Cam loved Max and Alec and the friends hed made in the military, Trevor was the one person he felt he could count on the most.His best friend was currently wiping down the shelves behind the bar and getting it ready for when the doors opened at seven.Cam picked at the sleeve of his T shirt.Max was rightit was tight and black and didnt hide his tattoo.Hed gotten three phone numbers on napkins shoved into the front pocketlabeled Dekes Baron his first day.In college, he would have been happy about it.But he didnt have time to play around here at home.And now it felt especially weird, knowing that Tate was still in town.Why was that?Trevor dropped the rag into the sink behind the bar.Wanna help me lower the chairs?Sure, Cam said, and followed Trevor as he began picking up the chairs off the tables and placing them on the floor.Hows your mom?Trevor asked.Cam shrugged.Shes all right.Yeah?Trevor said, raising an eyebrow.Yeah, I think so.Just tired a lot, but her pain seems better.The pill combination shes on now seems to be working.Trevor nodded.Thats good.While Cam had been off at college, his mom had become progressively worse.Shed hid it from him, not wanting him to drop out or transfer closer to home.Trevor went to the community college and lived in his own apartment, so hed help out Teresa when he could.Hed been the one to finally come to Cam and let him know just how bad itd been.Cam had dropped everything to come home, but his mom refused to let him stay.So hed busted his ass to get out in three and a half semesters.Thanks for putting in the word for me to get the job.Trevor shrugged.No big deal.It just lucked out that Roy got that factory job and had to move.He was a shitty bouncer anyway.If you slipped him in a twenty, hed let you get in without ID.Cam wrinkled his nose.That was my reaction.Trevor laughed.Cam owed Trevor.A lot.But he was still rankled about what happened earlier.You know, I ate at the diner today.Trevs hands paused, then he resumed lowering the chairs from the tables onto the floor.Oh yeah?Cam leaned a hip on the table and watched as Trevor moved on to another table.Yeah.So why didnt you tell me she was still here?Trevor took a deep breath before answering.Because you said you didnt want to hear about her.You said you didnt want to hear her name again.Cam ran his tongue over his teeth.Whats she doing here?Trevor spat out a dry laugh.You dont own this town, Cam.Shes allowed to live here.She never left.An odd chill ran down Cams spine.What the fuck?She went to school in  No.Trevs voice cut through the chill like a hot knife.She never went to school.What?Cam thought shed gone to Tucker U.  None of this made sense.But  Trev whirled on him then, his dark eyes flashing in the dim light.Man, you dont know what happened.All you can focus on is the fact she cheated on you.And fine, okay?Be pissed about that.But whats going on right now with her isnt about you.Shes got much bigger problems than something she did four years ago.Trevs voice was shaking by the end.And that knife burned hot in Cams gut, slicing muscle as it cut deeper.Did you sleep with her?He didnt want to ask, but he had to know.That didnt stop the words from slicing tiny cuts in his mouth on the way out.Trev froze with his back to Cam, then slowly turned his head, so Cam could see only his profile.What did you just say to me?Cam licked his lips.This was a bad idea to go toe to toe with Trevor.The guy had probably fifty pounds on him.But that knife was burning, burning and Cam needed the truth.Did you get with Tate?Is that why youre so worked up about defending her?In one step, Trevor was in Cams face, their chests brushing, Trevs jaw clenching.Youre one dumb fuck.Answer the question, Cam gritted out.And then Trevor laughed, that sad, ironic laugh.This is so messed up.I thought you went to college and fucked her out of your system, but I guess not.Youre still torn up about her, arent you?The words twisted that knife until Cam swore a limb had been cut off.Trev  Trev pushed his chest into Cams, sending him stumbling back a few feet.Trev turned and kept arranging the chairs.No, I didnt sleep with her.Ever.Were friends.Ive been helping her out, is all, when she needs it.Trevor the white knight.Helping all the women in Cams life.The knife had eased up somewhat.Helping her with what?Trev shot him a look.You wanna know about her life, you talk to her.I dont  Dont act like you dont want to.Trev pointed a finger in Cams face.This isnt resolved.I know it and you know it.Talk to her.Cam chewed on the inside of his cheek.So if she didnt go to school, shes been working ......at the diner, Trev finished, walking toward the bar.Cam followed him.Why didnt she get a better job?Trev scoffed.What do you expect her to do?Be an accountant?An astronaut?Fuck, she has a high school degree, she has no trade education, and we live in shit hole Paradise.Why didnt she leave  Trev slammed a glass on the bar, and Cam flinched.Im done with this conversation, Ruiz.I swear to God.Youre my best friend, but Im not doing this with you.You wanna know anything else about Tate Ellison, you get it straight from the source.Get me?Cam swallowed and whispered, I get you.Trev stared at him for a beat, then nodded.Go in the back and get a couple bottles of Jack Daniels for the bar, will ya?Sure, Cam said, heading toward the back room.Hey, Trev called.Cam stopped and turned around.You get in my face again, Trev smiled.And Ill knock you out.Capisce?Cam chuckled.Comprende.Trev gave him a smirk and a chin lift, and Cam went to retrieve the whiskey.4      IT WAS AFTER ten when she walked in.Tight jeans, heels, and a low cut racer back tank top.She was with a couple of girls he didnt recognize, and linked arms with her best friend, Vanessa.Shed been friends with Van as long as hed known her.Van was also Trevors sister.Cam was on his break when she walked in, so Trevor took their drink orders at the bar, not bothering to check their IDs since he knew them.Cam hung out in a dark corner, drinking a glass of lukewarm water.He and Tate drank at high school parties, sneaking crappy blackberry schnapps and chasing it down with fruit punch.But she never drank when he wasnt around, saying she was only comfortable letting go of her inhibitions around him.She knew hed watch out for her.He always did.She didnt trust the guys in their school and frankly, Cam didnt either.There were tons of assholes in their class that wanted the spics chick.He was hidden in his little alcove, so he could watch undetected as Tate ordered a round of shots, two for herself.Cam gripped his empty glass tighter as she threw them back like they were water.He remembered how she used to sputter and sneeze when they drank in high school, and hed always laugh because she sneezed three times in a row.He blew out a breath.These memories had to stop.After ordering more drinksnot shotsthe group retreated to a table at the back of the bar near the pool tables.Its vacancy in the rapidly filling bar gave Cam the impression that was their table.Did Tate drink a lot?Cam stood up and walked to the bar, leaning against the flip top.Tate come in here a lot?he asked Trevor.His friend didnt answer him, even though he wasnt serving anyone at the moment and was only washing glasses.Hey, Trev  I heard you.Trevor emphasized each word, his voice full of irritation.Cam bit the inside of his cheek.Are you going to answer?Trevor licked his lips, leaned his head back and stared at the ceiling, like he was praying for patience, then he took a step toward Cam and leaned on the bar.Im not answering anything else about Tate until you talk to her.Cam glared.Youre a jerk.Trevor laughed and went back to washing glasses.No, Im not.And you know that.Im the best friend youve got.Cam pushed off the bar and retreated to his post at the door, propping himself on the stool and crossing his arms over his chest.He was hidden a little in the doorway, so he could spy on Tate without her watching.Damn, he was a creeper.An hour later, he was still at the door, checking IDs.Tate and her friends had gone through two more drinks and all of them were getting louder and louder.None of them had noticed Cam, in his little hidey hole, dressed in his black shirt and dark jeans.He was practically part of the decor, the way all bouncers seemed to blend in to the place they guarded.Dekes Bar had a digital jukebox and someone put on a club hit.Cam recognized it and enjoyed a little eye candy as some cute girls began to dance.And then Tate stood up, starting that hip sway, and he braced.And panicked.Tate outside the diner?Drinking in a bar?He could handle that.But watching her dance?Those hips and that hair and that ass?And possibly ...for fucks sake ...another guy touching her?Cam might burn this motherfucking bar down.He didnt even want to analyze the way his fingers curled into fists and his knuckles kneaded his thighs.The uneasiness that swept over him, beading his brow with sweat.Tate looked over her shoulder, shooting Van a brilliant, loose smile, reaching her arm back as her friend slipped her hand into Tates.Tate led the way onto the dance floor, as Van held her other arm over her head with a piercing whoop!Cam inhaled sharply.Tate and Van were a force together.Van was tall and curvy as hell.Skin dark like her brothers, with natural hair she teased out around her head.In high school, Cam and Tate used to get drunk and perform dance routines that they had learned when they took jazz dance classes together.It was ridiculous, and silly, and half the time one of them would trip and fall into the other until they both ended up in a pile on the floor, giggling and snorting.And no one gave them crap because no one really wanted to mess with Trevor or Cam.Theyd all had each others backs.Until they graduated high school and went their separate ways and the ties that held them stretched so far that they snapped.Cam held his breath as the girls started dancing, the beat pounding into his head as the vision of Tates hips swirled in front of his eyes.She still moved the same, and it was crazy how he could practically feel that ass snugging up against him as she moved, like it was just yesterday.He glanced at the bar, but Trevor was busy pouring a beer and chatting with customers.Cam crossed his arms over his chest and thunked his head back into the wall behind him.This nightfuck, maybe this whole goddamn summerwas going to be torture.THINGS WERE A little blurry.Vans laugh sounded extra loud in Tates ears as they both moved to the beat.Tate wobbled a little on her heels.Itd been so long since she had a night out like this, and the alcohol made the three inch spikes tricky little buggers.And the whole night, shed felt this weird presence sliding over her skin.She chalked it up to the residual agitation of running into Cam, but the feeling only got worse as the night went on.She turned and looped her arms around Vans neck, slowing her dancing to small shifts of her hips.Van loved to dance, and loved girls, a fact that hindered her love life in this small town.Van was currently working at a department store, saving money to head to California to try to model.Wanna go sit and get another drink?Tate asked over the pounding music.Van frowned down at her, placing her hands on her hips.Is that you, Tate Ellison?Tate scowled.Yes, why?Youre throwing in the dancing towel after two songs?Tate rolled her eyes and pinched the back of her friends neck.Hey!Van said with a mixture of annoyance and laughter.Dont pinch me!Im tired.Tate pouted.Dont give me crap.Vans face softened.Oh right, you had a blast from the past today.Tate tried not to wince at Cam simply being referred to as her past.Even if it was true.And cutting my hand and the panicked phone call from my brother which ended up being a bathtub ice cream social.Poor baby, Van said in baby talk.Tate held her fingers up in a pincer grip.Youre asking for it.Van laughed and pushed at Tates shoulders, so she turned around and walked off the dance floor.Im going to get our drinks.Go on and sit down and put your legs up, old lady, Van said.Tate gave her the finger, and Van stuck out her tongue.Tate walked along the wall on the way back to the table with the rest of their friends, fingertips brushing the old wood paneling to keep herself steady.Damn, why did she drink so much?Her dad had said he was fine, that he was just going to sleep, so Tate could go out and enjoy some time with her friends.It still hadnt stopped her from checking her phone constantly like a doctor on call.She totally was an old lady.Her eyes were on the floor in front of her, so she saw the shadow first as it crossed her path.Tate, said a familiar voice, and she stopped dead.Her skin prickled.And she wondered if this was the source of that weird feeling shed had all night.Marcus Olsen.Another mistake she regretted.Who the hell did she piss off that all of her worst decisions were biting her in the ass today?Really.A girl could take only so much.And where was Van with those drinks?Tate, Marcus said again, and Tate sighed, looking up into his blue eyes.Hi, she said lamely, tucking a stray piece of hair behind her ear and bracing herself on the wall with her other arm.Marcus leaned one shoulder against the wall in front of her, letting her know he was settling in for some Tate Marcus chat time.Oh goody.His eyes flicked down her body.Lookin good.She wanted to wrinkle her nose, but she resisted.Thanks.Wanna dance?I hurt my ankle.Wanna smoke?I quit.Wanna drink?Not thirsty.Marcus inhaled and exhaled slowly.Why we gotta play this game?Tate narrowed her eyes.Theres no game.Marcus barked that condescending laugh he had.You played hard to get for a while and then finally backed down.I dont really want to play this game again, but Ill do it if it gets you in my bed again.Tate wanted to vomit.Like in one of those romantic comedies where the heroine spews all over the lobby of her new school within the first ten minutes of the movie, and then spends the next hour and ninety minutes reviving her reputation from the ashes with pluck and a great wardrobe.Wouldnt that be awesome?If she could throw up all over Marcuss shoes, and then she could begin her life over?And end up with a healthy dad and mature brother and guy of her dreams?Movies were awesome.But they werent real life.And sleeping with Marcus last year had been a big, fat mistake.Look, Marcus, there is no game.That was a one time thing.It was great, we both got what we wanted, but its not something Im going to revisit, okay?Marcus bent his head, watching his boot as he ground it into the floor, like he was putting out a cigarette butt.Tates fingers twitched.He raised his head slightly, eyeing her.Im not big on giving up when I really want something.Why the hell did he want her?Honest to God, she had nothing to offer.Nothing.Okay, except sex.But he could get that from some other girl.She was closed for business.She shook her head and leaned off the wall.Well, nice talking to you, but Id like to get back to my table.Marcus straightened.Tate, come on  Marcus, please.No.Just no.Not now, not ever.And Im sorry if I led you to believe there would ever be something between us, but Im making it clear now.No.Marcuss blue eyes swirled and his mouth tightened.Tate.He took a step forward and grabbed her hand, not noticing the bandage on it from where she cut it earlier.His thumb pressed into the injury, and she cried out in pain.Marcus jerked back, his mouth open in shock as he stared at her hand.He looked like he was going to apologize but he never got the chance.Because another body was now between them.A big one.In a black shirt.And this body was now pressing Marcus into the wall.Tate clutched her hand to her stomach and groaned.Apparently this night could get worse.Camilo was here.The two men faced each other, Cam looking like he wanted to bite Marcuss head off.Marcus held his hands up at his head and looked so visibly freaked that Tate wanted to laugh.The guys had known each other in high school, but Tate didnt think theyd ever been friends.They were talking heatedly and Tate clued in to the conversation.she said no, Cam growled.Im not a moron, Ruiz.I heard her.Then why did you grab her hand so hard that you hurt her?I didnt  I heard her cry out in pain, Olsen.Tate froze at that.He heard her?Where the hell had he been standing?It wasnt like shed screamed.As much as she enjoyed Marcus getting pinned to the wall, she thought it was time she stepped in.Its okay, Cam.She stepped forward, placing a hand on his arm.She opened her mouth to keep talking but lost her train of thought when Cams head whipped to the side and he stared at her, eyes wide, wild and pissed off.Oh shit.You said no and he laid a hand on you, Cam said through clenched teeth.Damage control, Tate thought.As much as Marcus didnt know when to back off, he hadnt tried to hurt her.I know.He grabbed my hand, which he shouldnt have done and Im sure hell apologize for, but the only reason it hurt was because I cut it earlier today.He didnt grab me hard.Cams eyes flicked down to her bandaged hand.Tate held it up and wriggled her fingers.See?The soft serve ice cream machine attacked me.She smiled weakly.Cam didnt smile back.But at least his posture lost some of its aggressiveness.Didnt the military teach them to be cool under pressure?Jeesh.Cam was never a hothead.Im sorry, Tate, honest.Marcus spoke up.I didnt know about your hand.But I shouldnt have grabbed you.Tate nodded.Its okay.No one moved.Ruiz, pretty sure you can stand down now.Marcus glared at him.Cam stepped back a foot, and Marcus eased off the wall.He turned to Tate and licked his lips, looking like he wanted to say something else.But Cams presence, his thick arms crossed over his chest as he stared at Marcus, seemed to unnerve the guy.Marcus rolled his eyes and began to back away.Whatever.See ya around, Tate.Have fun with your bodyguard.And then he left Tate alone in a dark corner of the bar with Cam.Tate rubbed her temples where a headache was forming.Today was the fucking worst.She exhaled slowly and focused on Cam, who stood before her with his arms crossed over his chest and still a little pissed off.Which pissed her off.Because really, who did he think he was?Rolling back into Paradise with his fancy college degree, thinking she needed some sort of help or protection or what the hell ever.Well she didnt.Shed been taking care of her family all this time on her own, working her ass off at the diner.The last thing she needed was Cam Ruiz thinking she owed him anything.Well, thanks a lot for your tactic at disarming the enemy, but I think I have it from here.Tate made to walk past him, but he took a step, blocking her path.She pulled up abruptly and glared at him, placing a hand on her hip.Excuse me?Cams jaw flexed.Hows your hand?Its fine.Do you need stitches?Tate inhaled through her nose and out through her mouth and prayed for patience.Nope, its fine.Itll scab over and heal and be good as new.We done with the questions now?Cam gestured behind him in the direction Marcus left.What was that about?Tate hadnt wanted to get into this, because that would just prolong this conversation, but itd been a long day, and she was a little drunk.Seriously?Look, Cam, I appreciate the concern, but I dont need this.I dont need a bodyguard or whatever.So just finish your visit in town and mosey on out to your big, hotshot job and forget about me like you did for the last four years, okay?Cam flinched slightly, dropping his hands at his sides, and thats when she saw the logo on the breast pocket of his shirt.It burned into her eyes, and she felt a headache spreading from her temples toward the base of her skull.She pointed at his shirt.Why are you wearing that?Please, please, please  I work here.Three words.Three words that tilted her world on its side.And physically her world was tilting because she felt an arm around her waist, catching her before she hit the floor in an unceremonious puddle of Shocked Tatum.And then her back was against the wall, and Cam was inches away, his face no longer pissed off, but concerned.She blinked slowly.Cam?He was still so gorgeous.With those full lips and perfect skin and large dark eyes.His eyelashes were so full and thick, she used to joke about him wearing mascara.Her breath hitched.She could press forward, just a little bit, touch her lips to his.Just once.Itd been so long, and maybe she could claim she was drunk ...You okay?he asked, taking her attention off his mouth.She focused on his eyes with his dark brows furrowed, and she recalled the reason shed temporarily lost her standing ability.Why are you working here?His lips shifted, like he was biting the inside of his cheek.Then he licked his lips.Because I needed a job.Im the new bouncer.That headache was a wrecking ball between her ears.None of this made sense.Cam was always going to go on to big things.He was always going to get out of this town.Why was he here?Working as a bouncer in a dive bar?But you joined the military so theyd pay for your school.And you went to school.And you graduated magna cum laude.And you ...How could she make him see he was better than this?You shouldnt be here, she whispered.Cam frowned, but didnt step back.Im here to help my mom.He still had a strong arm around her waist, and her hand rested on his biceps, which had gotten much bigger since shed last seen him.She wanted to cry.Just burst into salty vodka tears right here in this bar because this couldnt be happening.Shed done all this for him, so he would be free.And now he was back.Shackled to this town.How could this have all gotten so fucked up?She needed to get away from him.She needed to be alone where she could break down into a sobbing mess in private like a responsible adult.She pushed on his arms.Please let go of me.His arm loosened, but he didnt step back.Okay, I hear you, but can you stand?You almost fell and  She pushed harder.Im fine!Her voice was louder than she meant it to be, a shout, right in his face.She froze.And he froze.And then her phone rang, vibrating in her back pocket, its trill ring cutting the silence between them.5      HER EYES WERE huge, barely any hazel showing in the dark light.Her cheeks were flushed from the alcohol, her lips parted in rapid breaths.Her phone continued to ring in her back pocket, but it was like theyd slowed down the action in Utope.Everything around them was slow motion as they stared at each other, as Cams mind replayed their conversation, trying to figure out why Tate was worked up.Other than the awkwardness, why did she care so much that he was back?And why the hell did she care where he was working?He felt like he was missing something, as Tate shook in his arms and visibly blinked hard to beat back tears.Tate  She ripped herself from his grasp and grabbed her phone out of her pocket, not looking at the caller ID as she answered it.Her voice was shaky when she answered.Hello?Both of them were silent as the voice on the other end spoke.Tates face slackened as the color drained, and then it roared back to life as she clenched her jaw.Are you fucking kidding me, Jamie?Hold on, I cant hear you.Im going outside.Without looking at Cam, she took off, albeit a little wobbly, for the door.Cam told himself to stay put.Not to get involved in Tates personal life.But shed said Jamie.That name tugged on his heart.Jamie had been like his little brother for years, and breaking up with Tate had felt like a divorce because of the kid.Cam wanted to know how he was, what he looked like.And that was why Cams feet began to move after her.Why he stuffed down the resentment he still felt over what she did.He did it because of Jamie.And because Tate looked half dead on her feet and her eyes were in shadows.Cam followed her outside, where she was shouting into the phone.Youre lucky!Youre so goddamn lucky they let you off with a warning.What the hell, Jamie?And I have to pick you up now?Right this minute?A pause and then Tate let out a frustrated growl, bracing herself with a hand on the side of the brick building.Fine, Ill be there as soon as I can.I should let you stew in a holding cell.You owe me!She dropped the hand holding the phone at her side, her back to Cam, and he watched her slender shoulders rise and fall with deep breaths.Her shoulder blades poked through her thin shirt.Was she eating?Damn, she was thin.And then she reared her hand back, like she was going to throw the phone, and Cam stepped in.He grabbed her elbow and cupped the phone in her hand so she didnt hurl it.A gasp escaped her and she whirled around, Cams hand on her elbow.Oh my God, what are you doing following me around?Looking for all the ways to save me?The tears were there in her eyes now.Big, smart, important Cam relishing how far Tate has fallen, huh?Is that it?Her words were furious, each one a fastball to his sensitive flesh, like he was naked at home plate and she was pitching them as hard as she could.Stop it, he said, slightly shaking her arm.She snapped her jaw shut and glared at him as he kept talking.You think I ...what?You think I came back here to gloat or something?Im not gonna lie, Im not over what you did.And Im not gonna lie and say Im ever gonna be.But that doesnt mean I dont care.And that doesnt mean that when you need me, Im not gonna step up and be there for you.Like right now.He pulled his keys out of his pocket.Where we going?Tate started to shake her head.He cut her off.I gather we gotta go pick up Jamie?She stared at him mutinously before giving him a small nod.Okay, and youve been drinking, so you cant drive.I can.Just let me tell Trev I got to go.She crossed her arms over her chest and glared at the street.Wait right here, okay?Another nod.Cam ran inside the bar, let Trev know he had to leave early to drive Tate and then tore back out of the bar, convinced Tate wouldnt be there.But she was right where he had left her, looking deflated and not at all willing to battle him.When he reached her, he slung an arm around her shoulders and directed her to the car.So, where to?CAM DROVE, SNEAKING glances at Tate.She was silent on the drive, but not still.She fingered a lock of hair at her shoulder, twirling it in her fingers.She rubbed her knuckles on the leg of her jeans, and slipped her feet in and out of her heels.She sighed a lot, and sometimes she opened her mouth like she was going to speak, but then shut it again and stared out the window.But her head kept drifting toward him and he could feel her eyes on him.His face, his hands, his arms.Then, a featherlight brush on the arm of his shirt and she pulled up the fabric to look at the tattoo on his biceps.It was a simple set of wings hed gotten with a couple of friends after theyd graduated basic.He and Tate used to talk about how they would get tattoos together when they were older and had money.It had been one of his fuck yous to her he wasnt necessarily proud of.But girls dug it in college so it ended up being all right.Finally, she turned to him.So how long do you plan to be in town?Whats going on with your mom?Cam tapped his fingers on the steering wheel as he halted at a stop sign and looked both ways.He began talking once the truck was rolling again.Shes got fibromyalgia.Some days are good and others are bad.Shes on a new mixture of medication, so we are hoping that helps her out with the pain, mood and sleep issues.Im sorry to hear about that.I didnt realize.That was nice of her to say in light of her rocky past with his mom.It is what it is.She was silent for a minute and when he glanced at her, she was biting her lip.So how long will you be in Paradise?Not sure.I have a job offer in New York at a security firm.So as long as Mom is okay by then, I hope to take it.New York.Tates voice was soft, almost reverent.Good, thats good.You should take that job.This conversation about his future, with the girl he always thought would be in it, was uncomfortable.They fell into an awkward silence, and Cam fidgeted with the radio, turning it up to drown out his thoughts.When that didnt work, he turned it back down.Finally, he spoke.Whats going on with Jamie?When Cam left for basic training, Jamie had been thirteen.Hed grown out of that weird preteen stage, and although he had his rebellious moments, he loved his dad and worshipped Tate.She was the mother he never had, since their mom had passed away from a heart attack soon after Jamie was born.He was drinking at a friends house and a neighbor called the cops.The friend is a judges son so thats the only reason we arent picking him up at the police station right now.Cam wasnt dumb, and he knew a lot could change in four years, but he never thought Jamie would be that seventeen year old kid caught drinking at a high school party by the cops.Seriously?Tate stared out the window and when Cam glanced at her, she was rolling her lips between her teeth.Tate?She started and glanced at him, then looked at her hands in her lap.Hes ...having a rough time.Drinking?What the hell, Tate?Her head whipped to face him and those almond shaped eyes were fierce.Im doing the best I can.Cam held up a hand.I never said you werent.And what do you mean I?What about your dad?Shit, Im just trying to get caught up on everything that happened since Ive been gone  Theres really no reason you need to be caught up  Damn it, Tate!He banged a hand on the steering wheel and she jumped in her seat, but shut her mouth.Why wont you let me help you?Her lips were pressed in a thin line until she spoke.Her voice was barely above a whisper.You have to know its killing me to be near you again.He didnt know how to interpret that.All he knew was that he was conflicted.Because while he still wasnt over her betrayal, he also wasnt over how he felt about her.What a shitty situationthat he could never again be with the only girl he ever truly wanted.So he stayed silent.And Tate stared out of the windshield as they drove through the night to pick up her brother.The house where they needed to pick up Jamie was on a good side of town, where a lot of people lived who commuted from higher paying jobs in the city.They pulled up outside a large, two story brownstone.Two cop cars were parked in the driveway, and a couple of kids were sitting on the curb, two cops standing behind them.Im going to kill Jamie, Tate mumbled, staring at the cluster of teenagers with bowed heads.It took Cam a minute to spot him.The porch lights from the house glinted off his dark blond hair.It was long, bangs hanging in his eyes, so when he looked up, he had to toss his head to the side to see.They made eye contact, and if it wasnt for his unmistakable Tate like face, Cam wasnt sure hed know it was Jamie.Because those eyes, which were usually full of contentment, with a touch of snark, were full of anger and hurt, and Cam had to tense so he didnt flinch.What the hell had happened to this family?And finally a thought occurred to him.Wait, Cam said, turning to Tate as she placed a hand on her door to get out of the truck.Why isnt your dad here?Tate froze, then opened up the door.Can we just get him and go home, please?she shot over her shoulder, and slammed the truck door behind her.Cam winced and patted the dashboard.Hed have to talk to Tate about being nicer to his baby.He hopped down out of the truck and strode toward Jamie as Tate spoke to the police officers.She seemed to sober up since the situation called for it.Cam stopped in front of Jamie and crossed his arms over his chest.The kid stared at up at him, eyes narrowed, lip curled into a sneer.What the fuck are you doing here?It took every ounce of Cams strength not to falter back a step at the force of Jamies words.He was no longer a sweet young teenager who thought Cam and Tate walked on water.He looked like he wanted to drown them instead.Cam leaned down slightly so he didnt have to yell.You watch your mouth.Jamie snorted.I dont have to listen to you.Youll be gone again soon anyway, Im sure.Cam frowned.These poison barbs Jamie threw made no sense.What the hell?Come on, Tate said, appearing beside Jamie and hauling him up with a hand wrapped around his biceps.Youre damn lucky this party was at a judges house so these cops let you all off with a warning.I dont even want to know what would have happened if you lost your license.Jamie didnt say anything but shot another glare at Cam as he walked by, allowing himself to be dragged by his sister.She directed him into a seat in the cab of Cams truck.Cam slid into the drivers seat and looked in the rearview mirror.Seat belt, Jamie.Jamie didnt move.Put on your fucking seat belt, Jamie, or Ill have those officers handcuff you and put you in the back of their car, Cam said.When Cam heard the click, he put the truck in drive and headed for Tates house.It was muscle memory, all the turns he had to make, which potholes to avoid.He managed to make it there in fifteen minutes, despite the tension so thick in the car he could barely breathe.When Cam pulled into the driveway, Jamie was out of the truck before Cam had it in park.Hey!he called after Jamie sharply, but the kid was already sprinting into the house.Tate followed more slowly, her heels in one hand, her purse dangling from the other.Cam got down out of the truck and walked in front of her, checking the ground to make sure she didnt step on anything, like broken glass or a nail or a rock.She followed along behind him hesitantly and when they reached the front door, she didnt open it right away.You need help with anything?Want me to do damage control with your dad?Why was Cam volunteering to get so involved again in her life?He wanted to smack himself; at the same time he wanted to offer more, get on his knees and do anything so that she would let him chase away the shadows in her eyes and the anger in Jamies.She shook her head vigorously.Cam looked around their yard and frowned.Is the Civic your dads car?The Ellisons didnt have a garage, so Tates old Jeep and the Civic sat in the driveway.Tates dad drove an old Crown Victoria.Tate shook her head.No, thats Jamies.We got rid of the Crown Vic.Cam cocked his head.What does your dad drive now?Tate bit her lip and looked down at her bare toes.Look, its been a long day, okay?I need to get inside and check on Jamie and ...She let her voice trail off.And Cam knew she was hiding something.He took a step closer and gripped her chin lightly, tilting her head back so he could look in her eyes.She continued to worry her lip, her gaze darting back and forth between his eyes.Im going to be here the whole summer.And as much as I wanna say, Screw you, I cant.Because youre Tate and Im Cam and this is what we do.Help each other.Itd been that way since they were kids, when Cam didnt have a dad and Tate didnt have a mom.So together they made their own little family of sorts.Her eyes closed slowly and then snapped back open.He wondered what it would be like to kiss Tate again.Shed been his first kiss.Shed been his first everything.Why was he torturing himself like this?Because his heart gave him no other choice.He saw something wrong with a family whod been everything to him once.And he had to do everything he could to fix it.He closed the gap between them and rested his forehead on hers.Maybe they could do this.And just be friends.Theyd been best friends once.Youll let me help?he whispered.She licked her lips, and he felt a slight swipe of her tongue on his bottom lip.Why do you want to?He shook his head, still connected to her with his hand at her chin, his forehead touching hers.I dont know.But it feels like thats what I should be doing.She inhaled sharply and then exhaled slowly.Okay.And before he did something crazy like kiss her or let his hand wander, he pulled back.You know where to find me.And tell Jamie he and I are going to have a chat.She nodded and he turned to walk down the porch steps.Camilo, she said softly, and he looked over his shoulder.Drive safe.He smiled.Sure.6      TATE BLINKED AT the TV in her dark room, running her fingers over the button of her Catharsis controller.The opening screen of Utope flashed in front of her eyes, little characters on the screen making dinner and shopping and diving into their backyard pools.In Utope, players created characters from scratchchoosing their hair, eye and skin color; their wardrobe; their jobs.She hadnt played this game since Cam left for basic.She hadnt been able to look at the house they created together, a two story with a two car garage and roaring fireplace.A dog and a cat.
