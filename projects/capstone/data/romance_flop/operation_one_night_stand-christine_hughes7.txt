Yolanda, I cant afford this.Dont be silly.I am purchasing this for you.It is a work dinner, after all.Do not worry about it.If you are going to represent this company, if you are going to represent me, you will dress as such.Kelly opened the door and handed Yolanda a few small items.Take off your bra.What?We need to see which of these undergarments fit you best.We have two strapless bras and a body slimmer.She spoke as if I should know what she was talking about.A body slimmer?Oh, dear.There is nothing wrong with your body.The slimmer will just make sure everything stays where it ought to at all times, as well as hide the lines from your other undergarments.Now, it may be a tad uncomfortable in the beginning but trust me.It will be fabulous.Ill be out here.I thanked God Yolanda stepped out as I dropped my bra on the floor and fastened the strapless bra that, surprisingly, fit better than most of the bras I owned.Thankfully I was able to keep my own underwear on as I slithered my way into what mustve been designed by a man, because I cannot for the life of me understand why any woman would invent such a torturous piece of clothing.I was barely able to fit into the body slimmer without crying.But Christ, I had a hard time breathing.At least it was short enough to allow me to step back into the dress.When Yolanda zipped it up and told me to take a step back, I realized she was right.I couldnt quite put my finger on what was different but the dress fit even better than it had before.Kelly!Shoes!What size are you, dear?Um, eight.Size eight!Nothing too strappy.Or shiny!Yolanda looked at me.Try sitting in that dress.I tiptoed over to the chair shed vacated and sat.The fabric moved with me and didnt tighten or slide up as many other dresses would.The body slimmer constricted me in a way I wasnt used to but I didnt want to say anything to her.I looked at her expectantly.Good.Do you have a proper coat?I mentally riffled through my closet.Yes!I have a long red wool coat.It has black buttons and an embellished collar.It sounds like it would work.Clutch?I nodded.Okay, lets get some shoes and be on our way.I have things to do.The almost friendly Yolanda that had appeared over the past hour and a half was disappearing and I wondered if Id see her again.Kelly came to the door with another saleswoman, their faces were barely visible over the stack of boxes they each carried.It would be better to try them on out here, Kelly said as she lifted her gaze over the boxes.I made my way to the small foyer of the dressing area and sat on the white linen chaise.Looking around, I realized this was an area of the store where my mother would shop.It wasnt that I shunned my parents money.They taught me to be self sufficient and I think it made my father, at least, proud that I was able to fend for myself.They, of course, never let me want for anything.I just never asked for anything anymore.I liked being a grown up.Then again, Yolanda was pulling me back into the world of having someone else provide for me.I wasnt sure how I felt about it.After the sixth pair of shoes, I was sure Id found the pair I was looking for.Id been so wrapped up in slipping my feet in and out of designer shoes that Id failed to notice Id been left alone.I couldnt figure out where Yolanda and Kelly had gone off to, so I took the opportunity to make my own shoe decision.I stood in the four inch understated black platform pumps and walked toward the three way mirror at the end of the hall.I was admiring my silhouette and how the heels helped my butt pop a little more than normal when I saw Brian in the reflection.I spun around and almost fell, catching myself only when I shot out my arm and steadied myself on the mirror.Hi.Hi.He smiled and my stomach flopped.What are you doing here?Just hanging out.I smirked and rolled my eyes.I mean what are you doing standing among womens dresses?Oh!You should have been more specific.Im here shopping with my sister.I craned my neck looking for a female version of Brian.He laughed.Shes in the dressing room.I hadnt noticed anyone walk through, but then again I hadnt noticed Yolanda and Kelly were absent, either.You look, uh, nice.He scratched the back of his head, causing his already tussled hair to poof out a bit more.It was cute.I smiled.Nice?You think this dressI walked toward him slowlyis just nice?I liked how the height of my shoes had my line of sight even with his mouth.His Adams apple bobbed as he swallowed.Well, lets see you walk that way.He pointed toward the mirror as he leaned against the wall.I turned slowly and looked over my shoulder as I tried to sway my ass without looking like a cartoon.When I reached the mirror, I stared at his reflection and smiled.Maybehe coughedthat dress is a little bit more than just nice.A little, huh?Yeah.I wouldnt want your head to get all big and whatnot.He rubbed his thumb along his lip before shoving his hands in his pockets and shrugging.I stepped out of my heels and placed them back in the box as I heard a woman calling Brians name.I turned my head around so fast I thought Id get whiplash.Standing before me in the very first black beaded dress Id tried on was a slight woman with long wavy red hair, full lips, and Brians baby blues.Who is this?She stepped forward with her hand extended while she looked at Brian.This is Caroline Frost.The one I was telling you about.Caroline, this is my sister Siobhan.I whipped my head in his direction.He was telling his sister about me?Oh!Youre the one who works with Yolanda Page!Is it true what they say about her?Is she really a dragon lady?I heard shes impossible to work with.Siobhan leaned in like she was trading secrets with a girlfriend.Since I was never one to gossip, I didnt quite know how to answer.Well, shes tough for sure, but Im learning so much from her.I think those things are said by people who dont know her.Siobhans face fell like Id popped her last party balloon.Oh, well.Thats great.I didnt mean that, you knowI placed my hand on her arm.Its okay.I was scared of her at first.Shes really a great person.A warm smile spread across Siobhans face.So, are you working with Michael Mortimer?Whats he like?Dont mind her, Brian said.Shes just looking for dirt.All the great journalists look for dirt.Oh, shut up!Brians just jealous because I get to meet all the fabulous celebrities and hes stuck running a bar.I meet some interesting people, right, Caroline?He winked at me.It made me feel slightly flustered.Youre a journalist?Well, trying to be.Ive been assigned some literary dinner next week and I heard Michael would be there.Id love to bring an interview to my editor.Well, then you should join Caroline.Yolanda walked into the foyer in standard Yolanda fashion.She owned the room.Siobhan blushed, obviously flustered.I will have the car pick you up after Caroline next Saturday.Youll sit with them and after, Caroline will make sure you get a few minutes with Michael.Will you be joining her, dear?She turned her attention to Brian.Um, I dont, well, I wasnt planning on it.Well, of course you should.You can keep Caroline out of trouble while your sister interviews Michael.She turned to me.Which shoes did you choose, Caroline?I pointed at the box on the chair and she nodded.Fine.Kelly knows what to do.Give everything to her.I will see you at work on Monday.With your completed notes.Am I clear?Crystal.Good.I expect nothing less.She turned back after shed begun walking away.Oh, and Siobhan, you would do well to ask Michael if he thinks I am a dragon lady.Id be interested to know what he thinks.The three of us froze for minutes after shed left before Brian finally let out a booming laugh.I told you your big mouth would get you in trouble!I am not in trouble!She invited me to the dinner!As her guest.She sat next to me after Id plopped on the chaise.You dont think I am in trouble, do you?I shook my head.At least I didnt think Siobhan was in trouble.Id seen a glimpse of Yolanda that made me appreciate her even more.Siobhan and I changed in the dressing rooms and I handed my things to Kelly.Well, Ill see you later.Nice to meet you, Siobhan.Wait!Caroline!What are you doing for dinner?Id love to pick your brain about Michael and Yolanda.I promise, nothing inappropriate.I just want to be prepared.Shiv, I am sure she has plans.Oh, right.You probably have a date or something.I caught a look in Brians eyes.Was it regret?Disappointment?Actually, no.Its just me and Sarah sitting around eating Chinese.Youre more than welcome to join us.Oh thank you!She hugged me.Well see you then!We?Yeah, silly.I cant leave my baby brother home on a Saturday night, now can I?I smiled as Brian looked uncomfortable.No.I guess you cant.Siobhan grabbed for her purse.You should get Brians number so you can text him the address.Im always losing my phone.She raised her eyebrows and looked toward Brian.Always losing her phone, my ass.I think I have it already.I raised an eyebrow when I saw Brian smile at my words.Yeah.I guess you do.He rubbed the side of his cheek.Just, um, text me the address.What time?Six.I took a few steps backward before turning.As I walked away I heard Siobhan whisper, Youre right.She is very pretty.Yeah, she is.NineteenSarah buzzed them in at six.She and I had just wiped out a bottle of Pinot and were perusing the take out menu.Siobhan and Brian entered through the open apartment door with a dusting of snow on their shoulders.Hey!Your apartment is great!Siobhan unzipped her coat and handed it to me.Great to see you.This is my roommate, Sarah.Ive heard so much about you.Sarahs eyes widened when Siobhan hugged her tight.Let me take your coat, Brian, Sarah said when she finally released herself from Siobhans grip.Hed changed his clothes from earlier, replacing the V neck sweater with a tight thermal long sleeved shirt in navy.I was momentarily hypnotized by the outline of his pectorals.His pants were the same distressed designer jeans Id seen him in earlier, with a wide, aged brown belt holding them up.It was a casual look.Casual and fucking sexy as hell.He pulled off his hat to reveal the disheveled blond mop Id often thought about running my fingers through.But that would be inappropriate.As would rubbing my face along his ever present five oclock shadow.Damn, he was yummy.And off limits.Not for the first time, I regretted not taking my friends advice and abandoning the target for the bartender.Sarah left to put the coats on the bed with Siobhan in tow and Brian handed me two bottles of Cabernet.Following me to the kitchen, I handed him the bottle opener as I reached for two more wineglasses.Nice slippers.I looked down at my feet.Id forgotten I was wearing them.Theyre comfy.And I wasnt going anywhere.No need to defend them.I ducked my head.Right.So, no work tonight?He poured four glasses, emptying the first bottle.Nope.My brothers taking care of it.I needed to take the night off.He took a sip.You smell good.What is that?Vanilla?Yeah.Um, thank you.Vanilla.I stammered and mentally kicked myself for the sudden inability to take a compliment.Your brother?I asked, looking at him over the rim of my glass as I took a large sip.Yeah.Patrick.His wife is out of town and he needed something to do.Hes staying at my place while hes here since Ryans gone for a few days.Ryans gone for a few days?Yeah.Why?He didnt tell you?I shook my head.Why would he tell me something like that?Brian smiled and shifted in his seat at the counter.I dont know, maybe because you two areFriends.I cut him off.Thats what I was going to say.Right.So your brother Patrick, he doesnt live here?I climbed on top of the counter and took up my crisscross applesauce position with my back up against the wall.Nope.He lives in Connecticut with his doctor wife, two point five kids, Labrador retriever, and state of the art minivan.What does he do?He runs his own computer software company.Nice.Yep.So thats why I am here taking over the bar.No one else wanted to do it.What did you do before this?Lawyer.I was in ROTC all through college, did my time, got out.Started working in the private sector.Dad died.Poof.Im here.Did you want to leave your job?Didnt matter.Didnt love it.Do you love the bar?Sometimes.He gave me a look that made my heart pound before he got up and walked to the window.The snows really coming down outside, huh?Huh?I really needed to stop staring at his ass.Yeah.Supposed to get a lot tonight.I joined him at the window as Sarah and Siobhan returned.Wines on the counter.I was just telling Sarah how you saved the family business.Siobhan curled up in my spot on the couch.There was still a hint of chocolate stain on the arm.No matter how many times I tried to clean it, it remained, Im sure, to mock me.No one needs to hear that.Brian turned a slight shade of red.We were going to have to sell it.Too many violations.But Brian came in and saved the day.That was nice of you, I whispered.I didnt do it to be nice.He walked back to his seat at the kitchen counter and picked up the take out menu.Oh, hes just modest.Siobhan, enough.Come on.Im starving.Fine.Fine.I was just making conversation.She plopped down on the stool next to her brother and took the menu from him.Their dynamic was fascinating.They were obviously close, though Siobhan was more of a free spirit.They balanced each other out.My brother and I were close but we were so much alike, there was no balancing act.When we were together, we were as competitive as foes.And when we had to, we joined forces to hold the other up.But when we fought, it was a blowup.Two people so much alike, it was hard to distinguish one from the other.Which was why we made it a point to keep our visits with each other to a minimum.Didnt mean I didnt love him more than anyone else in the world, it just meant that I knew where our boundaries fell.Once we settled on the food, Brian called for delivery.Looking out the window, I kind of felt bad for the delivery guy because the snow was really starting to pile up, but the pity didnt last once my stomach rumbled loud enough to be heard across the room.Was that your stomach?Leave it to Sarah to call attention to the embarrassing.Yes.Yes it was.Shall I give you a dollar for guessing correctly on your first try?Um, maybe we should put out some snacks?Oh please!I am starving!I poked my head in the fridge and pulled out a wedge of Brie and a couple of pears.Sarah grabbed a box of crackers.Want me to make a drink or something?Brian offered.Yes!Sarah and I said together.Wheres your liquor?I pointed.What would you like to drink, Care?As soon as he said it, I realized it was the first time hed used my nickname.Yeah, well, you know.Anything.Im easy.Are you now?He chuckled as he pulled bottles from the shelf.Thirty minutes of small talk, stolen glances in Brians direction, and a myriad of questions, rapid fire style, from Siobhan followed the awkward moment.Thankfully she was interrupted by a long buzz.Foods here!Sarah jumped up to get her purse.I got it.Brian held out his hand and left the apartment to head downstairs.Care, I think he likes you!Sarah mustve forgotten Siobhan was in the room because we both froze when she said it and slowly turned our heads in his sisters direction.What?You arent wrong.She poured another glass of wine and plopped back on the sofa.Spill.Sarah sat on the couch next to her.Sarah, no.Im sorry, Shiv, shes off her meds.Oh, no.I dont mind.Honestly, I havent seen him light up around anyone in a long time.And pardon me for mentioning it, but I think I feel a vibe coming off you, too.Why dont you guys, you know, just try it out?See where it goes?I was being put on the spot by the sister of the guy Id passed over.I kind of hoped the floor would open up and swallow me away from the hell that was that moment.You see, there was a target and Brian kind of helped me and then there was the gym I stared at Sarah, silently imploring her to help me.Oh no.Youre doing great.Well, I am sure Ryan would understand.Its not like you two are a thing, right?Yup.Hell.What do you know about Ryan?That you two are friends with benefits or whatever.No.Siobhan, if were going to move on here you need to know.I am her friend with benefits.You are her friend with benefits.Ryan is her friend whom she fucks.Nothing more.Nothing less.That makes more sense.Now, if only social media would allow you to classify relationships like that.You know, One Night Stand, Do It Yourself, which, by the way, would be my status, Friends with Benefits, Friends Who Fuck.I should really write a piece on this.Let me get my notebook.Siobhan ran to Sarahs room to grab her purse and I plopped down in front of Sarah.What the fuck?What?I was just getting intel you wont ask for.I dont need you to do that for me.I am more than capable of finding out information on Brian if I want to.And I have more than enough on my plate.I cant be in a relationship right now and I think taking the path of Brian would take me there.Ryan is uncomplicated.Its just sex.If you think sex is uncomplicatedNo, I mean Ryan isnt the type of guy I would want to be in a relationship with.With Brian, thats all I see.Brian is safe.And Ive had enough safe for now.Well, wait too long and Brian wont be around.Care, hes a catch.I know.I justI dont know.Whos hungry?Brian walked in with a huge bag of Chinese takeout.The smell made my stomach growl again.Lets make sure Caroline gets fed first before we all lose fingers.Brian handed me my quart of chicken and broccoli and a pair of chopsticks.I pulled up a floor pillow to the coffee table in the living room and didnt wait for everyone else before I dug in.Brian pulled up a pillow next to me after refilling my wineglass.Floor, huh?I like it.Plus its usually just me, Sarah, and Mel.Whatd you order?I popped open his container with my chopstick.Orange beef.Is it good?Try some.He offered me some of his food while he plucked a piece of chicken from my take out box.Are there mushrooms?I dont think so.You dont like them?Allergic.Hives, stomach issues.Not pleasant.Good to know.Ill never make you anything with mushrooms in it.I should have glossed over the comment but the thought of him cooking me something to eat was kind of hot.And nothing too spicy.Stomach?Yeah.I crinkled my nose and he laughed.All right.No mushrooms, no spicy food.Ill remember that.Whatcha talking about?Siobhan made herself comfortable on the couch next to Sarah.Caroline was just telling me about her aversion to food.Shut up!I playfully punched him in the arm.Sorry, she was telling me how much time she spends in the bathroom after she eats mushrooms and spicy foods.Asshole!I laughed hard enough to spew food on the table.What?He spread his arms out in front of him.Being an asshole is part of my manly essence.You, my friendSarah poked her utensil at himare not an asshole.Youre right.Im too safehe cocked his eyebrow at meto be an asshole.I immediately began choking.Sarah jumped up.Are you okay?Yeah.I coughed.Something.Wrong pipe, I managed to squeak out.Was it something I said?Brian laughed as I threw my napkin at him.Eavesdropper.Sarah doubled over with laughter.Siobhan got up to retrieve another bottle of wine.I certainly dont think were drunk enough.The rest of the night continued as if wed known one another our whole lives.Siobhan asked a million questions about Yolanda and Michael, jotting each answer down in her well worn notebook.Sarah and Brian teased each other easily and chatted a bit about her job as a high school science teacher.And even though my stomach flopped every time I caught Brian looking at me, it was easy.Easier than when I was around Ryan.He made my skin crawl in a way that would lead only to an orgasm.Both good feelings, but it was like I couldnt relax around him.With Brian, I dont know.It felt simple.Like I said, easy.Before we knew it, it was almost two in the morning and wed polished off a little more than a half dozen bottles of wine between us.I was certainly feeling it.Siobhan had passed out on the couch, curled up in a tiny red headed ball.When did she fall asleep?I have no idea.We laughed because at that point, everything was funny.Another bottle and the giggles wouldnt come as easily.We were at the point where if we stopped, maybe we wouldnt embarrass ourselves.I need to wake her up.We should really get going.Brian started toward his sister.No.Leave her there.You guys can stay here.You dont want to walk home in this.Sarah pulled back the curtain to reveal the several inches of snow that had fallen.I wouldnt want to put you out.I can come back in the morning and get her.No.Really.Its no problem.You can sleep in my room.Brian raised his eyebrows at me.Not like that.I can bunk with Sarah.Not what I had in mind as far as a bedmate, but beggars cant be choosers.Im beat.Good night, Brian.Good night, Sarah.Brian and I stood by the window, both feeling the effects of a night of wine and Chinese food.I watched as he licked his lips and remembered how they felt last week at the bar.I wanted nothing more than to kiss him again.So, this is awkward.He snapped his fingers before clapping a hand over a fist.He rocked back and forth on his heels.I dont think its awkward.Liquid bravery set in as I stepped closer to him and tugged lightly on his shirt.Well, we should get to bed.He wrapped his hand around mine and pulled it away from his shirt.Right.I think I have a pair of Stevens pajama pants that I never returned to him.You can wear them if you dont mind wearing douche pants.I dont mind at all.Ive always wanted a pair.I opened the door to my bedroom and saw that Sarah had already put his coat on my chair.Brian stood at the threshold.You can come in, silly.I wont bite.Oh, well then Im not sure I want to come in now.He walked around my room, stopping to look at photos and flip through my books.You read a lot?All the time.You?Please say yes.Please say yes.I do, actually.A Separate Peace by John Knowles was always a favorite.You probably think thats weird.No!I love that story.How Gene was unable to get past his own shortcomings and how envious he was of Phineas.Phineas was such a free spirit.I loved how real he was.You dont think he was pretentious?I flopped on my bed.Pretentious?Absolutely not.He embraced goodness.Gene, to me, represented the darkness we all have inside.All?Including Phineas?He sat on the bed next to me and placed his hand on my knee.Well, I guess so.I lay back and stared at the ceiling.My head was all over the place.Forget the fact that I was a little drunk.I hadnt felt like this since I was sixteen.It felt new and scary and right.Care.You know.I know Im not the wild and crazy whatever youre looking for.Im okay with that.But Ill have you know, Im not safe, as you say.I didnt mean it that way.I just meant, I mean, I just got out of a five year black hole.I cant do that again.Who says Im looking for a relationship?No one.I didnt mean it how youre taking it.It was supposed to be a compliment.Brian eased back until he was lying next to me, staring at the ceiling with me.His hand reached for me and he intertwined his fingers with mine.Rubbing his thumb along mine, he sighed.You dont have to sleep in Sarahs room if you dont want to.I dont want to put you out.Its okay.I dont mind.I meant, you could sleep here, too, unless you think something will happen that you dont want to happen.My eyes felt like they were going to pop out of their sockets.Um, yeah sure.How about you give me those pajama pants and Ill go get changed in the bathroom?I shot up and rifled through my bottom drawer.He took the bottoms, pushed a curl out of my eye, and left the room.As soon as he left, I closed the door and did a quick pit sniff.At least I smelled good.I ran a brush through my hair.Bad idea.Anyone with curly hair knows this.I threw it in a sloppy bun.Taking off my pants, I ran my hands over my legs.Thankfully there wasnt much stubble.I threw off my shirt and reached for my favorite Dave Matthews Band T shirt.I had just unhooked my bra and tossed it on the floor and was slipping the tee over my head when Brian walked in the room.His eyes widened.Im sorry.I thought I gave you enough time toIt would have been enough time had I not stopped to check out my personal hygiene first.No, its okay.Im just on autopilot.I wasnt thinking.Go ahead.Pick a side.A sexy smirk played on his lips.Are you going to put on some pants?I looked down.I totally wasnt thinking.The T shirt barely scraped my hips and I was standing in the middle of my room, in front of Brian, in my underwear.Thank Jesus they were at least a cute pair Id picked up last week when I was preparing for Operation One Night Stand.I quickly grabbed for a pair of tiny shorts.I tripped as I tried to put them on and fell into Brians grip.His hands were firmly on my upper arms and I carefully stood and looked up at him.His eyes sparkled in the lamplight.Bending down slightly, he smiled as his hands rubbed my shoulders.As he softly brushed his lips against mine, I was brought back to last weekend at the bar when I first met him andRyan.Shit.Whats wrong?I was kidding.You can sleep in that if you want to.I mean, I really dont mind.Its not that.Its justRyan.He took a step back and dropped his hands from my body.The flicker of light I saw in his eyes moments ago dimmed.Yeah.Suddenly a tiny stain on the carpet grabbed my focus.Hey look.You said it yourself.Ryans your guy.Im the safe one here.So its safe to say nothings going to happen tonight.He climbed into bed, settled in, and pulled back the covers.Stop saying youre safe.Well, thats what I am, right?Now get some sleep, Care.And dont think so much.I put on my shorts and climbed in next to him.The inches that separated us may as well have been miles.Clicking off the light, he rolled over so his back was to me and I was relegated, once again, to staring at the ceiling; this time alone.Since when did life get so complicated?TwentyBrian was gone by the time my eyes snapped open at 6:03 the next morning.His coat was gone and the pajama pants were carefully folded on top of my dresser.The only indication he had been there was that the mattress was still warm.He hadnt left that long ago.I threw the covers off, pulled on the oversize pajama pants that hed worn the night before, and tiptoed out into the hallway.Come on, Siobhan, lets go.I heard Brians voice.Im so tired!Why couldnt we have just slept in a bit longer?Siobhans voice took on the whiny tone of someone who clearly wasnt ready to be out of bed.Ill get you coffee on the way.I didnt get to thank them for letting us stay over.Call later.Brian was obviously in a hurry to get out of Dodge.I could hear him juggle his keys.Fine.I dont know why youre in such a hurry.Did something happen last night?No.Nothing happened.Did you want it to?Shiv, Im tired.I have a lot to do today.We can talk about it later.You like her.Who?Who?Caroline.Youre crazy.I held my breath.Even from the hallway I could hear the lie in his voice.Crazy intuitive.Why dont you just tell her?Because shes with Ryan.I dont have time for this.The lock unlatched and opened.I dont think she is.And I dont think you think she is, either.You always do this.Do what?I didnt hear her answer because the door closed behind them.I blew out the breath I was holding and unclenched my hands.Leaning back against the wall, I slowly banged my head a few times.What did it matter if he liked me or not?Not like we knew each other or anything.He probably just wanted what Ryan had gotten, a romp in the sack.Making my way to the kitchen, I prepped the coffeemaker and pulled down my favorite polka dotted mug.I had just turned to the cabinet to get the sugar when the door opened.Standing in the door staring at me was Brian.I didnt know you were awake.I always wake up this early.Its some sort of punishment for something terrible I did in a previous life, Im sure of it.How long have you been up?He was still standing in the doorway, looking unsure of himself.It was a different look for him.A couple of minutes.Did you forget something?I turned away and took the coffee creamer from the refrigerator.My sister, she um, forgot her notebook.Oh.Well, I can help you look.I motioned for him to come in and began looking under the sofa cushions while he checked the tables.Found it.I held up the small pink notebook.Thanks.He walked over and I handed it to him.Youre welcome.We stood in front of each other not making eye contact.Look, Care.About last nightWhat about it?Nothing happened.I know.Ryans my friend.Hes mine, too.I turned and walked back to the kitchen.I just dont want to step on anyones toes.I get it.Look, no big deal.He shoved his empty hand into the pocket of his navy peacoat.Youre interesting.Interesting?I looked at him over the rim of my coffee mug.Isnt that the compliment of the century.Yeah.And well, I like getting to know you.I like getting to know you, too.I put the mug on the counter.Well, okay then.Okay then.I repeated.Brian!Did you find it?Siobhan walked into the apartment and stopped cold when she saw the two of us looking at each other.Oh.Good morning, Caroline.Good morning.I didnt take my eyes off Brian.We should really be going.Brian stepped toward the door.Thanks again for finding this.He held up the notebook before handing it to his sister.Anytime.See you.Yeah.See you.I made eye contact one last time before he closed the door.I dropped my head to the counter.What the hell was that?Sarah yawned as she made her way to the coffeemaker and poured herself a cup of coffee.What did you hear?All of it.Then you know.You two slept together last night?Slept together as in slept.Nothing else happened.Well, we kind of kissed.Kind of kissed?What does that even mean?Yeah.It was barely a kiss.Then we fell asleep.Well, he slept.I stared at the ceiling all night.I tucked my legs under me as I took up my spot in the couch.I was glad to find my ass still settled into the cushion perfectly.Sarah sank into her chair.So what does that mean?Nothing.He doesnt want to step on any toes.I got that part.What does that mean for you?I dont know?Nothing?Something?Sarah called me on my bullshit.Maybe.Who knows?Ive been out of the game for so longDont make excuses.If you like him, you like him.Doesnt make you a bad person because you slept with his roommate.You didnt even know him then.I placed my mug on the side table.Exactly.I still dont know him.And he doesnt know me.So why all the weirdness?Because I dont think he wants what you think he wants.Which is?A good romp.I think this guy is into you for more than sex and I dont think youre in the mind set to expect that from anyone.But youre into him, too.And I think it scares you a little.I leaned my head back on the sofa cushion and closed my eyes.Sarah was right.After Steven, I wasnt sure I was in the right frame of mind to be in any kind of relationship that required emotions.I was wrung out and wasnt sure I could handle any more.Look, she continued, Ryan wasnt even supposed to be part of the equation.He was supposed to be a one night stand.What you need to decide is if you would be as conflicted if he and Brian didnt know each other.Her words rang true.I needed to look at things from a different angle.The new me would take the time to think things out before writing them off.I owed it to the old me.Youre right.Ill think about it.You do that.Im going to get dressed.Early gym today.I have a lunch date with Drew.I thought about Brian and what hed said, what Id heard him say.I kept going back to the same thought.The best feeling was when Id look at him and find him already looking.That had to count for something.Melodys meeting us here before spin.Sarah interrupted my thoughts.She had a date with Danny last night.Im hoping hes the one that finally erases Nick the Dick from her mind.Well see.Shes pretty fickle.True, but I think, kind of like you were, maybe shes finally decided that being treated like a thing, like a fuck buddy, isnt really a relationship.Is that all Ill be to Ryan?And does it matter?What if I want to get to know Brian?I dont know.And if its what you want, it isnt necessarily a bad thing.You just have to decide what would make you happy.Ryan and his promise to be your fuck buddy friend or Brian and whatever that brings.You certainly cant have both.Twenty OneThe week flew by without a call from Ryan or, for that matter, Brian.Instead of obsessing over the lack of contact, I threw myself into my work, much to Yolandas pleasure.We were nearly done with Michaels book and looked to be on schedule with the release date, a mere six months away.In the publishing world, six months was quick.Of course, the manuscript was edited multiple times long before I arrived to work on the final round.I was happy that Yolanda was pleased with my work and even happier that shed expressed that happiness with Mr.Little.I woke up Saturday morning ready for a day of preparation.Id come to learn the dinner I was attending was actually a pretty big deal for Michael and the publisher.What had slipped past me was the novel had been optioned for a movie and the screenplay was nearly finished.It was exciting to be part of something so big, especially for a first project.
