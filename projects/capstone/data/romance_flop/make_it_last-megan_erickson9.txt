So she answered honestly.It often does.But not always.Her voice dropped.Not for me.Teresa shut her eyes and then looked back at the street before opening them again.So I supported him when he enlisted, and I cheered when he went to college.I thought youd hold him back, but you didnt, did you?No.The word was a croak in Tates throat.Teresa faced her again.He told me what happened.What you did.Tate didnt know what to say about that.Okay.It was stupid, but it had the outcome you wanted, right?What I wanted?Cam stayed in school?Tate nodded.Teresas eyes burned into Tates.But this time, its not working how you want it to, is it?Tate shook her head.He loves you, Tate Ellison.He loves you so much, hes miserable right now.And that makes me miserable.Tate bit her lip to keep herself from crying.So, this altruistic act needs to stop.Your decisions send ripple effects to a lot of people.And what I care about most, what I want most for my son is to be happy.What I want most is a woman who will fight for him.Tate bit her lip harder until she tasted blood.Those brown eyes burned into her.Is that you?Are you that woman for him?It took a minute for Tate to be able to speak.For her to release her abused lip, open up her mouth, and say, Yes.Thats why Im here.Im fighting.Teresas eyes finally softened and the burning in Tates skull eased.Good girl.Im guessing you need an address in New York?This was it.Be your own heroine.Yes, please.Id love that address.19      AT HOME, TATE threw clothes in a duffel bag that still smelled like campfire smoke.She wasnt taking the time to pick out anything nice.She might end up wearing something horrid and unmatched, but this was New York City, right?Shed probably fit right in.Actually, shit, she had no idea what NYC was even like.Or how she was getting there.She sat down on the bed and deep breathed.No way would Cecil make it.She could take a train, maybe.A train?She had no idea where the closest station was.Oh God, how was she going to do this?But she had to.This was her grand gesture.This was her moment, to show Cam how she felt.To prove to him that she could fight for them.Tate frowned and tapped her chin.How much was a plane ticket to New York?She picked up her phone and began searching for flights.Which was confusing as all hell.Where was the Easy Button that she could click that automatically knew what she wanted?Stupid phone and technology.She was about to throw her cell across the room when there was a knock at her door.Come in, she muttered.Her dad walked into the room first, then Jamie, followed by Anne.Tate frowned.Hey, whats going on?Anne stepped forward and held out a sheet of paper.Your plane ticket.Tate blinked at her and then stuck a finger in her ear, wiggled it, then pulled it back out.Im sorry, what did you say?Anne shook the paper in Tates face.I bought you a plane ticket.Tates eyes landed on the paper.And there it was, in black ink on a crinkled piece of white computer paper.A flight number and time and bar code and everything.Departure: BWI  Destination: LaGuardia Airport  But  We all talked, baby.Her dad sat down on the bed beside her.We know you were in here wracking your brain about how to get to New York.Anne said she wanted to buy your ticket.So, here we are.Tate plunked her head down on her fathers shoulder and looked up at Anne.You didnt have to do that.Anne patted her cheek.I wanted to.Jamie smiled reassuringly, and Tate imagined the picture they all made.She groaned.This is so Hallmark right now.Her dad jiggled his shoulder so her head bounced.Jamie said hed drive you to the airport.To make your flight, you need to leave now.Tate snatched the paper from Annes hand and checked the departure time.Oh shit!She jumped up and began throwing more random clothes in her bag.Then she ran out into the hallway to grab toiletries.She ran back into her room, brandishing her toothbrush.Wait a minute.How long am I going to be there?Whens my return flight?Anne rolled her lips between her teeth.Jamie rocked on his heels, and only her dad met her eyes.We didnt get you a return flight.Tates hand with her toothbrush dropped to her side.What?He stood up slowly and walked toward her, placed a hand on the side of her neck.Its not that we think youre staying there.But we dont know how long and were hoping ...that you come back with someone.And you two can decide when and how.Maybe stay for a little?Take some time off.We can hold down the fort here.But  Her father squeezed his fingers, silencing her.Please, baby, do as I ask.Go fight for Cam.Tates eyes pricked with tears.This is the best pep talk of all pep talks.He kissed her forehead.Have a safe flight.She turned to grab her bag, then turned around, gesturing with a finger between her father and Anne.Well, well be discussing this, by the way.You two.Her father reached out and clutched Annes hand.This is something we probably should have done years ago.Aw damn, Im going to cry again, Tate muttered as she hugged them.On the ride to the airport, Tate and Jamie didnt do much talking.She was nervous as hell and couldnt deal with conversation.But music and dancing?Well, Jamie knew her, and so he cranked up the radio and they sang along to Billy Joel and Bruce Springsteen and all the legendary songwriters their dad raised them on.Jamie hugged her after he helped unload her bag from the car in the drop off area at Baltimore Washington International Airport.Be safe, he said.She nodded and kissed his cheek.With a wave, he got in the car and drove away, leaving her on the sidewalk with Tiny Dancer in her head.Tate turned to face the doors of the airport.She could see the security line through the glass, and thats when it hit her that shed never flown alone.Hell, shed never traveled alone.And the only time shed been in a plane, shed been eight and flew to see her fathers now deceased parents in Colorado.What if they strip searched her?She didnt even like removing her shoes.Shed called Cam on the way, but he hadnt answered.She didnt leave him a voice mail because she didnt know what to say, other than, Im coming.Teresa had said he was staying for at least three days.So Tate took a deep breath, straightened her shoulders, and walked into the airport.Luckily she didnt even have to remove her shoes, being one of the fortunate ones to be waved into the express security line.She dumped her bag on the conveyor belt and then picked it up after it passed muster.Once past security, she checked her ticket and began to make her way to her gate.Shed been a little girl last time she was an airport.Everything had seemed larger than life.Everything moved so fast.Shed wanted to be one of those people, on their way to bigger and better things.And now she was one of those adults, flying to their dreams.She self consciously hitched her tattered bag onto her shoulder.As she passed several restaurants, her stomach growled, reminding her she hadnt eaten since Teresas spiked lemonade and half a cookie.And now it was past lunch.Damn, shed arrive in New York around dinner.She bought a chicken Caesar salad at a small caf in the airport.But as she sat down to eat, she began to panic.What if Cam rejected her?What if she couldnt find him?She wasnt this person who took off on a whim after a boy.But then she took a deep breath.And sipped the rum and Coke shed ordered for courage.This wasnt a whim.And Cam wasnt some boy.She finished up her late lunch and walked to her gate, proud of herself that shed found it all on her own.She checked her phone.No call from Cam.She texted her dad and let him know shed made it to her gate and was waiting for boarding.He texted back.Proud of you.She smiled.Proud of me, too.20  Im in New York City and I was going to make this grand gesture but I dont know where I am and there is some naked guy beside me drawing a mural of the apocalypse on the sidewalk.Youre in NYC?Yep.Youre in NYC.I already confirmed this.Where are you?I love you.Tate ...Im fighting for us this time.Tate, where are you?I want you.TATE GODDAMN IT WHERE ARE YOU?Will you fight with me this time?Fuck it, I tracked your phone.Stay where you are.OK.Tate?Yeah?Im fighting, too.21      NEW YORK CITY was huge.Population of over eight million people in five boroughs.It made Cam twitchy but hed traveled a bit.He couldnt imagine how Tate was feeling.You could take the girl out of the small town but you couldnt take the small town out of the girl.But yet, despite the size of NYC, shed found him, or at least came pretty close.So either his mom had a hand in this, or Tate had done some digging.And if the app on his phone was correct, which he used to track her location, she was about a block away.Hed excused himself from the tour to go to the bathroom after receiving her first text.And now he was still getting a tour of the office.He didnt know why.Its not like he planned to work here any time soon.By he smiled at his soon to be boss anyway, nodding at the appropriate times even though his feet hurt in his shoes, his tie felt like a noose and sweat was dripping down his back.It was only another fifteen minutes, but it felt like fifteen hours when he burst out of the front doors of the office building.He walked toward her location, peering through the pedestrians on the sidewalk before he spotted her.Her hair was up in that hairstyle with the bump he loved.Her eye shadow was dark on her hazel cat eyes.She wore a simple blue dress and a pair of sandals and stood out like a million bucks among every else around her.Tate was in front of a street vendor with a table full of sunglasses, trying them on one by one, while the guys mouth moved a mile a minute.Shed pose and laugh and the guy would talk more, surely buttering her up to make a sale.Although Cam was sure he was smitten.You couldnt not be smitten by Tate.She was here.In New York.Shed come for him, not knowing he was moving mountains for her.He took a deep breath and let out the exhale slowly.Itd been worth it, this trip.Itd been worth it to find a way to be with Tate.Now that he knew she was fighting, too.She took that moment to look up, a pair of large, round, forties style sunglasses over her eyes.Her lips parted and then she smiled.In seconds, Cam was in front of her, bending her back over his arm as he kissed her, pouring everything he felt into that connection.She was hot under his hands and her lips were soft and she made tiny moans in the back of her throat.He pulled back and helped steady her on her feet.She gripped his shoulders and bit her lip.He reached out and pushed the sunglasses onto the top of her head.Tears leaked out of her eyes as she gave a little sob laugh.Surprise, she said softly.Cam shook his head.Youre crazy.She swiped her eyes and laughed louder.Crazy for you.A throat cleared and they both looked over at the street vendor.He appraised them with squinted eyes and a cocked head.Then he waved at the sunglasses on Tates head.Free for the lovebirds.Cam opened his mouth, because the card on the table said they were only ten dollars, but the man waved again.No.I said free.Yesterday, a woman tore a wig off another one in front of me.Thishe gestured to their embraceis much happier.Now go, and enjoy the rest of the evening.Cam glanced at the sky, darkening as the sun dipped below a tall building.Thanks, man.The vendor gave him a two fingered salute and then directed his attention to a customer.Cam took Tates duffel bag and slung it over her shoulder, then grabbed her hand to lead her down the sidewalk.He wasnt sure where to start with all the questions forming in his head.He went with an easy one.How did you get here?Tates eyes were wide as she took in the scenery.I flew.You flew?She focused on him.Yeah, Anne bought me a ticket so I could get here as soon as I could.He stared at their clasped hands, listening to the click clack of his shoes and the slap of her sandals on the sidewalk.And why did you want to get here as soon as you could?She swung their hands a bit.To ...to prove to you that Im fighting.That I want this.Us.Their eyes met.That this time I believe, want, need to make it last.Hed planned to stop at a deli or restaurant, take her out on the town.But fuck it.Not when she said those words.Those words that hed been dying to hear.He pulled on her arm so she followed him in to the hotel.He strode right for the elevators, walking so fast that Tate had to jog to keep up.Her head was whipping around as she took in the lobby.Is that a Starbucks?He shoved her into the open elevator doors, thanking everything holy they were the only ones, then backed her against the doors after they shut.He jabbed his finger on the number five, and then cupped her face.The nice, gentlemanly thing to do right now would be to take you out on the town.Wine and dine you or whatever.He kissed the corner of her lips, then the other side.But Tatum, I really need you alone right now.In a bed.Preferably naked.Her soft chuckle washed over his skin as her hands rose and slipped under his suit jacket.You know me.Id much rather be alone with you.In a bed.Preferably naked.Than in some stupid restaurant wasting money on some food Ill forget about in an hour.He laughed and kissed her jaw.She angled her head so he could feast on her neck.Fuck, I love you, he mumbled against her skin.Her fingers began to pull his shirt from the waist of his pants.Love you, too.The elevator doors opened behind Tate, and she stumbled backward into the hallway, giggling as Cam wrapped an arm around her waist to keep them upright.Luckily, his room was right by the elevator bays, so he swiped his card and then tugged her inside, pushing her up against the wall beside the door to resume what they had been doing in the elevator.Tates fingers returned to his waist to continue to pull up his shirt when her hands stilled.Cam?He was busy kissing her neck, running his hands along the edge of her panties under her dress, and didnt want to stop to talk.What?Why are you wearing a suit?Are you ...are you taking the job?He couldnt stop his fingers, as they caressed the soft skin of her ass.His brain was on that, not on her line of questioning.What did she want to know again?He dipped his head to her collarbone and ran kisses along the skin there.The job?Oh yeah, Im taking it.Her body froze beneath his.She pushed on his shoulders so he had to raise his head.Youre ...youre taking the job?Here in New York?I thought  Oh, thats what he said.No, no, but Im not working in New York.Her brows knitted.Im really confused.He groaned and dropped his forehead onto her shoulder.Damn it, you wanna talk and all I can think about is that I got you alone in a hotel room with a minibar and room service on the company dime.She pursed her lips, but the ends tipped up so he knew she was trying to hide a smile.Camilo, please explain.He backed away with a muffled curse and began removing his suit piece by piece, starting with those awful shoes that hurt his feet.Tate followed him as he left a trail of clothing to the bedroom.The hotel room was a suite, with a living area separate from the bedroom.Okay, so you didnt listen to the whole voice mail, did you?Tate sat down on the end of the bed.I ...I dont remember.I just heard that you turned down the job and  Cam waved a hand as he loosened his tie with the other.Yeah, lets not rehash.Anyway, I listened to the whole voice mail, which apparently, you hadnt done.They said they had a new research job come up that they thought would be perfect for me based on my skill set and military experience.And the best part is that I could do the job remotely.But they wanted to talk to me in person about it.So I got my ass up here as fast as I could.Tates eyes were wide as he kicked off his pants and it wasnt because he stood there in boxer briefs and a tight white T shirt.Wait, remotely?He was done talking.They had things to do before digging into the minibar and calling room service.Things that involved Tate naked in million thread count sheets.He put a knee to the bed beside her legs and a hand at her shoulder so she had to lie back on the bed.Although she protested along the way.Damn it, Cam, explain this to me before Im naked, please!He reached under her and hauled her up toward the head of the bed, then braced himself above her.He pulled out her hair clip and raised the skirt of her dress up to her waist.She shifted her legs and made a small sound in the back of her throat.He groaned at the sight of the pink cotton fabric darkened with her wetness between her legs.He ran his fingers along the top edge of her underwear, watching his hands.I can do all the research and work I need to do from Paradise.So I can stay there.And we can live in sin, for as long as we want.The door is open in the future for me to move here.He pulled down the side of her underwear and kissed her hip, then finally raised his gaze to hers.She was up on her elbows, staring down at him with wild hair, smeared mascara and wet lips.Are you serious?As a heart attack.She sucked in a breath.So ...you ...we ...this can work.He pulled her underwear down her legs and tossed it over his shoulder.You bet your ass itll work.Lowering himself between her legs, he pushed on her thighs so she opened wider.The soft thump above him let him know shed collapsed onto the bed, but her body was strung tight so that when he applied that first, long lick, she snapped.Tate had never been quiet during sex and now she whimpered and moaned and begged and cried as he spread her with his thumbs and indulged on Tate.He remembered how she liked it, and how a swirling suck on her clit sent her over the edge.It did this time, and when he rose above her, her eyes were glazed.He helped her out of her dress while he pulled his shirt over his head and slipped off his boxers.He settled his hips between her legs and kissed her face and neck and nuzzled below her ear.Just think.We can sleep in on weekends and do this all day.Her body shook with laughter below him.I think people will start to talk if we hole ourselves up in our bedroom every weekend.He lowered his head and sucked a nipple into his mouth.He let it go with a pop.Let them talk.She twirled her finger over her head.Wherever you put my bag, it has condoms in it.He shot her a grin as he rolled off her in search of her bag.How many?Dont get too cocky, Cam!she called after him as he left the bedroom, laughing.He rolled the condom on as he walked back to Tate lounging in the bed.She was running her hands along the comforter.Damn, this bed is nice.He put his hands on his hips.Im standing in front of you naked and youre talking about soft sheets?She giggled and held her arms out.Come here.Im sure I can make up for it by stroking your fragile ego.He crawled onto the bed over her.Theres something else I want you to stroke.She reached down and did just that.I set you up for that one on purpose.I know you did.He kissed her as he entered her slowly.She moaned into his mouth as he began to rock his hips.Last time theyd had sex, it had felt desperate, like they both had agendas.But this ...this was how could they could be together, in sync with matching breaths and heartbeats.He pulled her hands above her head and linked their fingers together as he continued to thrust slowly, not willing for this moment to end anytime soon.Tates eyes were at half mast, her lips slightly parted and tilted into a small smile.His orgasm built deliciously slow, and when he came, he did on an openmouthed groan below her ear.He let go of her hands, so she wrapped them around his shoulders and he cradled her head, stroking her hair.He stayed connected with her, shifting his hips as he enjoyed the feel of her around him.Tate heaved a long, contented sigh beneath him and he rolled off her.With a kiss to her forehead, he disposed of the condom, then came back to bed, tucking them both beneath the covers.They lay on their sides facing each other, holding hands.Cams arm was over her head, fingers stroking the hair at her temples.Her makeup was smudged, but her cheeks were a rosy pink, her lips wet and swollen.Shed never looked more beautiful.So, you came up here to learn more about the remote position?she asked.He nodded.And to accept it.She shifted closer.Even though I acted like a shit.You didnt act like a shit.But you pissed me off.She looked down at their hands.Im sorry.He tapped her head so she lifted it to meet his gaze.What did you think was going to happen when you got here?She snorted.God, it could have gone bad, huh?I didnt let myself think about it.All I knew was that I needed to prove something to you.That I was worth it.I always knew you were worth it.I needed you to believe you were worth it.She bit her lip.Okay, well, I believe it now.He kissed her and then rolled onto his back to grab the room service menu.Tate propped her chin on his shoulder so she could look at it, too.Were you serious when you said the company paid for this?Itd surprised him, that they were willing to put him up in this fancy place.But he wasnt going to argue.Yep, so what do you want?Arent they going to notice if they get a charge for two dinners?She had a point, but he shrugged.Im a big boy.I eat a lot.Tate laughed and pointed to the mushroom Swiss burger with pommes frites.I want that.Whats pommes frites though?He squinted.Arent they French fries?Why dont they just say fries then?Because they wanna be fancy?Tate rolled her eyes.Theyre fried strips of potatoes.Theres really no need to dress them up.Cam laughed.You tell em, Tatum.I want dessert too.Ooooh, Death by Chocolate cake.I want that.How long do you have this room?Tonights the last night.Oh.She looked disappointed.He dropped the menu on his chest and turned to her.Hey, well take a train home tomorrow night.So well wake up and do some sightseeing before that, okay?She tapped her chin.Whats there to think about?He laughed.That means we have to get out of bed.He rolled his eyes.You decide then.Stay in bed all day or sightsee.She flicked his nose.Just kidding.Id like to check out the city.Good answer.22      TATE GROANED WHEN the phone in their hotel room rang.She picked her head up as she heard Cams sleep roughened voice say, Hello?Theyd set their cell phones and scheduled a wake up call with the front desk.Which was a good thing.Because Tate had thrown hers when it went off.Cam had hit the snooze on his twice and now maybe the third time would be a charm.She blinked her eyes and tried to lull herself into consciousness as the phone rattled back onto the receiver.After eating themselves silly last night, theyd rented action movies and bad porn.Then Cam had woken her up once to have sex, while shed returned the favor with a sunrise blow job.She lay on her stomach and rolled her head so she was facing Cam.He lay on his back, rubbing his eyes with the heels of his palms.He dropped them at his sides with a thud, then turned to her.Damn it, Im tired.Me too.He sat up and rolled his neck.Okay, game plan.We take showers and then find somewhere to eat breakfast.If we order room service, well probably never leave.Tate pushed herself up onto her elbows.I need coffee first.Me, shower.You, coffee.Tate nodded.Cam clapped his hands together and hopped out of bed.As he walked toward the bathroom, he called over his shoulder.Now, Tatum!Bossy drill sergeant, she muttered.It took them forty five minutes, but eventually they were out the door.Tate hadnt packed much, so theyd managed to fit everything inside Cams bag, which he carried on his back.They stopped at a coffee shop for more caffeine and bagels.Where do you want to go first?Cam asked, squinting into the sun.Tate took a sip of coffee from her to go cup and pulled her new (free) glasses down over her eyes.You need sunglasses.He pulled a pair of mirrored aviators out of a cargo pocket in his camo shorts and slipped them over his eyes.His eyebrows rose above the lenses.Happy?She nodded.Those are hot.My sunglasses?Way hot.Since when do you have a thing for sunglasses?She chewed her bite of bagel and swallowed.Since theyre on your face.He laughed and slung an arm around her shoulders.They spent their morning doing all the touristy things New York offered.They walked around Central Park and sprayed perfume at Macys and ate vendor hot dogs.You want to check out Rockefeller Center?Cam asked as he tossed his napkin in a trash can.Tate slipped her hand into his.Thats where they do the big tree at Christmas and ice rink, right?Cam nodded.I mean, its the summer, but its still cool.They film the Today Show near there.The day was gorgeous, not too hot, but sunny with a slight breeze.Cam could have led her anywhere and she wouldnt have cared.Sounds perfect.As they walked, Cam chuckled to himself.Whats that for?He watched his feet eat up the sidewalk with a small smile on his face.I havent told you much about my roommates in college, have I?Hed mentioned them once or twice.A guy named Alec who looked like Elvis and a big, lovable asshole named Max.Alecs girlfriend, Kat, a firecracker who used to date Max.And Maxs girlfriend, Lea, a girl who finally put him in his place.A little.He swung their arms.Did I tell you about Maxs first date with Lea?She shook her head.So, she always wanted to skate at Rockefeller Center at Christmas when she was a kid.Ended up getting hurt in a car accident and wasnt able to go.Max found out and rented out a skating rink.Decorated it like crazy with Christmas stuff and took her skating.Tates heart melted.Thats incredibly sweet.Cam smiled.Yeah, he did good.Do you miss them?Cam squeezed her hand.Yeah, I do.Max and Lea visited me at in Paradise at the beginning of the summer.Alec and Kat are a trip.She makes me laugh.So yeah, I miss them.He ran his thumb along the inside of her wrist.So, uh, I didnt tell you earlier because I didnt want to make you nervous, but youre going to meet them.Tate stopped and tugged on her hand in his hold but he didnt let go.What?she screeched.Calm down.See?This is why I didnt tell you back in the room.She ran her hands over her hair.Damn it, you dont spring something like that on a girl.These were his friends.His smart college friends from a world she had never been a part of.Come on, he said, forcing her to walk again.Theyll love you.In the summer, the area that usually held an ice rink was a patio with umbrella covered tables.They stood at the balcony off to one side, looking down at the golden Prometheus fountain.She put the future meeting out of her mind and enjoyed this time with Cam.Tate looped her arm in Cams and laid her head on his shoulder.This moment was everything, with the breeze in her hair and the contentment of having Cam at her side.The knowledge that hed stay at her side.She opened her mouth to tell him that when a voice shouted, Theres Ruiz!They spun around to the source of the voice as a muscular man in a tight T shirt, khaki shorts and brown leather flip flops strode toward them.He had a crooked grin, and his eyes were a warm brown when he pushed his sunglasses into his short dark hair.He was also ber attractive, in that arrogant jock kind of way.Cam extended his hand.Hey Max.They did that bro hand clasp, back slap hug thing and then Max reached back, pulling forward a petite girl Tate hadnt even seen behind him.The girl had long brown hair with bangs and stood a little oddly, like she was keeping her weight off one of her legs.She hugged Cam and then stepped back, eyeing Tate.Cam cleared his throat.Uh ...Cam!came a squeal, and then a flurry of dark blond hair, wide blue eyes and tan skin came flying into Cams arms.Tate took a step back, unsure if this was some ex girlfriend who still had a thing for Cam.Because ...totally awkward.But Cams face showed no concern, so Tate held her tongue on judgment.Alec!the blonde yelled.Youre so slow, hurry up, its Cam!A man walked up and placed a hand on the blondes shoulder.So this was Alec.He had a pompadour hairstyle and a pair of thick framed glasses.He wore cutoff jean shorts, which normally would look horrid on a guy, but he seemed to pull them off with his worn chucks and V neck T shirt.In fact, he looked like a modern day Elvis.Cam, the blonde was saying, and Tate guessed she was Kat, Alecs girlfriend.I think I made it on the Today Show.Im not sure.But I was waving behind Matt Lauer  She looked crazy, Alec piped in.Kat ignored him and kept talking.And Lea said she saw me on the TV.I wasnt thrilled about my makeup today but thank God I wasnt wearing yellow or some awful color, right?Cam laughed.Youre famous now, Kat.She flipped her hair over her shoulder and stuck out a hip.Thats what I said.Alec is being a party pooper.Alec rolled his eyes, hauling his girlfriend back against his body and kissing the top of her head.She looked at him over her shoulder with bright eyes and a smile.The obvious affection between them made Tate grin.Cam opened his mouth, probably to introduce her, when a woman walked up to them.About Tates height, with dark pink hair cut in a short bob with bangs.She wore a cream colored, tight dress with gold trim, gold gladiator sandals, and a sort of gold snake headband.She looked like a funky Cleopatra.Tate wondered if she was some sort of street performer until she opened her mouth.Is Kat still talking about being on TV again?I think the camera was just trying to get away from me.Tate didnt know why, because the girl was stunning.Danica, you made it on, too, I saw it, Kat said.Danica rolled her eyes and then spotted Cam.Hey Cam.Cam hugged her and Tate watched closely for any extra touching.But Danica seemed about as interested in Cam as a piece of dry toast.Cam spoke up again.So, I need to introduce you guys to someone.He grabbed Tates hand and hauled her beside him.He pointed out Max and Lea, who were a couple, along with Kat and Alec.Danica, the pink Cleopatra, was another friend.And guys, this is Tatum.Tatum Ellison.My girlfriend.Danica was the first to greet her with a chin lift to her face.Nice makeup.Tate fluttered her hand near her cheek.Oh.Uh, thanks.Max was next.Nice to meet you.Damn Cam, you move fast.I just saw you a month or two ago.Yeah, well, she was my girlfriend from ...before.Five smiles wiped off five faces.The girls blinked at Tate and the guys scowled.Tate felt two inches tall.Cam must have told them about her.Hey, he spoke up.I know ...I said some things.But theres much more to the story.And lets just say, its in the past now.Were moving forward.I swear, she didnt do me wrong, okay?Alec stepped forward.Sorry, kind of attached to the guy.Nice to meet you, Tate.He shook her hand, his smile warm, and Tate began to relax.So thanks for meeting me, guys.Max shrugged.Kind of cool we were passing through when you were here.Whats this about an interview?Cam waved his hand.Long story, but Im taking the New York job ...just not in New York.Ill be working for them remotely back home.Max raised an eyebrow.And thats cool with you?Cam glanced at Tate and smiled at his friend.Yeah, its perfect for me.So what do you guys want to do?We were just about to grab some lunch.Kat shaded her eyes from the sun.Want to join?Cam looked at Tate and she smiled.Sure.She wanted the opportunity to get to know Cams friends better.He looked genuinely happy to see them.Kat was a little different, but fun to be around, and Leas sarcastic remarks and Maxs return quips were entertaining.Alec ...seemed quiet.And a little fidgety.Tate hadnt figured him out yet.They sat at table in front of the fountain and ate lunch.Kat sipped her iced tea and stared rapt at the fountain.Cam eyed Alec.You okay, man?Tate was glad this was unusual for Alec and not his normal behavior.His leg bounced and sweat dripped down his temples.Yeah, sure.Dude, youre sweating.Max slid a glass of water over to him.How about you hydrate.Danica patted Alec on the shoulder and whispered something in his ear, then pressed the water into his hand.Alec composed himself a little based on whatever Danica told him.Then he gulped down the water and crushed a piece of ice before turning to his girlfriend.Hey, you wanna go closer to the fountain?Kat turned and looked at him with her brows furrowed.What do you mean?Do you want to walk up there?
