Ha, ha.The laugh sounded as forced as it was.Ben stopped in his tracks.Youre serious, arent you?Yeah.Deadly.Fuck me, Ben said.I never thought Id see the day.Me neither.Everything all right?Olly shook his head.Not really.He took a deep breath.Can you take it off my hands?I need the money like yesterday.Ben rubbed his chin and puffed out a breath.Im not really into buying at the moment, mate.Times are hard here too.Tell me where they arent.I know.But Im desperate.I can see that.You know its history.Ben had more than likely done everything on it that had ever needed doing.You know that its been treated like a baby.Never known a more pampered pet.Then you know what this is costing me.Ben pursed his lips.Let me lend you the cash.I couldnt be sure to repay it.The scooter has to go.Ben sighed and spread his hands.OK, he said.If youre sure.Im sure.Ill give you fifteen hundred quid for it.Thats all I can manage.It was lower than the market value, but beggars couldnt be choosers.Done.Olly stuck out his hand and they shook again.Fifteen hundred quid should just about be enough money.It would have to be.73      I want Daddy to take me to nursery, Petal says.I do believe she stamps her little foot.That wont do you any good, miss.Daddy has had to go out, I explain.Hes busy today.Busy making a new life without us.My daughter pouts.She has woken up scratchy and all my attempts to cuddle and mollycoddle her have been rebuffed.Perhaps she senses something unpleasant is in the air.Unpleasant?Thats an understatement.Her world will be rocked when she finds out that Olly has walked out.I cant be the one to tell her.He will have to face that himself.When shes finished her breakfast, each mouthful a battle, I wrestle my moody child into her cardigan.God help her teachers today.She drags her toes along the pavement all the way to nursery, ruining her shoes, and I dont have the strength to tell her off.Is this the sort of thing that Olly and I will have battles about in the future?Will the buying of school shoes become a matter of strife between us?I drop her off in the playground and, gratefully, hand her over to a teaching assistant.Some of the other mothers are there, but they all stare at me and no one speaks, so I hurry off.I steel myself to walk to my next port of call.Ten minutes later and Im standing outside Jennys flat.Its a tired council block on the other side of town to where we are.I wonder if well soon, by force of circumstances, become neighbours.As I knock on the door, I feel that I should have some sort of speech rehearsed.My heart is in my mouth.If Olly is here, if he has come to her, then I have no idea what Ill do.Should I rant, rave?Should I calmly accept my culpability in this?When theres no answer, I knock again.Perhaps theyre in there together and simply wont answer.Opening the letterbox, I peer in.I can see right into the living room, but theres no sign of life.Ollys holdall isnt by the sofa.Maybe I should be grateful for that.I try his mobile again.If I can hear it ringing inside Jennys flat then I shall just fall to the floor and die on the spot.It doesnt.Wherever he is, its clear that my husband isnt here.Thwarted, I walk back into town and, inevitably, find myself rocking up at Live and Let Fry.The shop is already open and, inside, I can see that Phil is gearing up for the day ahead.As yet, there are no customers.Hey, I say as I go in.Hello, Nell, love, he says.What brings you in so early?Come and give me a hug.I let myself sink into Phils arms.He pats my back as if Im a small child.Hows the big bad world of designer handbags?Tears spring to my eyes.Very big and very bad.He holds me away from him and can obviously read the bleakness on my face.Oh, no, he says.Whats happened now?Have you got five minutes to spare?Nell, he says with a sigh.I have all the time in the world for you, love.Constance comes out of the back carrying a tray loaded with salt and pepper pots.Hello, Nell.Then she sees my expression.You look like a lady in need of tea.And sympathy, I add.Her eyes crinkle with kindness.Ill put the kettle on.Phil and I go and sit together.How many times have these caf tables served as my therapy couch, my confessional over the last year?How much emergency tea have they provided?What would I do without Phil and Constance?Well, I hope I never find out as Im certainly going to need them now.When Constance joins us and were all furnished with restorative cups of tea, I go on to explain that, this morning, on top of everything else that has happened in such a short space of time, Olly has left me.Constance shakes her head.Not Olly, she says.I thought that too, but theres no sign of him.No note.Hes not answering his mobile.I take a deep breath.I went round to Jens.Before I came here.I thought that he might be there.No, Constance says.Im sure he wouldnt have done that.But you knew that they were getting close, didnt you?I had my suspicions, she admits.Jen is very impressionable and Ollys a lovely man, but I dont think it went very far.Very far?Anywhere at all, she corrects.I dont know what to do.Ive been feeling  How can I explain that Ive been unable to function properly since all this happened?That Ive been neglecting Olly, Petal, myself?poorly, I conclude.Constance slides her arm round me.You dont have to cope with this alone, she tells me.Well help you all we can.Wont we, Phil?It goes without saying.Thank you, I whisper.Thank you so much.Well help you get Olly back.She nudges her boss.Wont we, Phil?Oh, yes, he says.Dont you worry.Thats all I want.I just want Olly back.But Im really not sure how they can help me achieve that.74      The plane was about to touch down at Miami International Airport.And not a moment too soon as far as Olly was concerned.Hed been getting more and more het up about his mission the closer he got to his destination.After selling the Vespa to Ben, hed headed straight to the ticket desk at Heathrow Airport and handed over eight hundred pounds for a one way ticket to Miami, Florida.Hopefully, he would be coming back.He looked at the flight ticket in his hand and, even now, it seemed to have a surreal quality about it.Had Nell realised yet that his passport had gone from his bedside drawer?He hoped not.Shed called him a dozen times already before hed even boarded the plane.More.It had been getting harder and harder to resist answering.He wanted nothing more than to hear the sound of her voice.As the doubts set in, he wanted her to tell him that he was doing the right thing.But what if she told him he wasnt?What if she begged him to abandon his plan and to fly straight home again?Then what?It was too late now.He was set on this course and hed have to see it through no matter what.The Vespa had gone and the remainder of the money would be used for a motel and rental car and, God willing, his return flight home.If this didnt work, then theyd simply have even less money than they did now.His flight had left England at half past nine yesterday evening.Now he was due to arrive in Miami shortly.He wondered what Nell was doing now and hoped that she wasnt too worried about him.Had she spent the night tossing and turning, fretting about where he was?More than likely.Hed tried to write her a note but nothing would come and in the end hed just left without explanation.The worst thing was he hated putting her through this, but it was for the best.In the end she would come to realise that.For now, the least she knew about what he was planning, the better.It was eleven oclock on a fine Miami morning when he touched down.Olly thought the temperature must be well into the eighties as he hit the street outside the airport.The heat was searing and, instantly, sweat poured from him.He hailed a taxi to take him the ten minutes to the Wrecks For Rent car hire place and there he handed over twenty eight dollars a day for the use of a Chevrolet Aveo that certainly wasnt the worst vehicle hed ever been in.It was the first time hed driven overseas and terror gripped him as he swung out into the weight of traffic, while every bone in his body was telling him he was on the wrong side of the road.He gripped the steering wheel, hot with perspiration as the air conditioning struggled to chill the baking interior of the car.The highway was wide, anonymous.To make up for its lack of charm, the sky above it was ridiculously blue.A blue so sharp and pure that it hurt his eyes to look at it.Even in the height of summer in Hitchin it never even approached that stupendous hue.Heading north in the traffic, the swanky art deco hotels of South Beach were way over to his right, as was the sparkling Atlantic Ocean.Holidaymakers were probably getting ready to have their lunch by the beach, sunbathing by the pool, perhaps enjoying an early cocktail to sharpen the day, but he wasnt here for the fun and sun.And where he was going definitely wasnt the playground of rich tourists.He was going to the darker side of Miami.The place where all the guidebooks said to avoid.Hed managed to find out where the Home Mall shopping channel headquarters were situated from the internet.A few hours or so of poking around and hed slowly been able to peel back the layers of their company to find out where they were based.At least he hoped he was right.Home Mall, it seemed, was located in a scruffy industrial unit in a run down area in Dade County.The sort of area that should have made them deeply suspicious, if only they had checked more carefully.A look on Google Street View had allowed him to pinpoint exactly where the building was.He only hoped that the Codys hadnt already done a runner and that this wasnt a heinously expensive wild goose chase.He had to take the chance though.What else could he do?He only had to look at Nell, how crushed she was, how broken, and know that he couldnt sit back and do nothing.He wanted his wife back and if that meant getting their money back, then he had no choice but to do this.Olly turned off Highway 95 and into the area of Opaville.Perhaps Lola and Benito Cody thought if they scammed companies on the other side of the world no one would come looking for them in Miami.How wrong they were.75      On the internet, most people seemed to say that this was the worst area in South Florida.Olly thought that he wouldnt really like to argue with that description.He couldnt think of anywhere in England that hed consider quite so scary.Hed come off the drab, traffic clogged highway and was now working his way along Main Avenue in Opaville, moving slowly in his hire car.The vehicle might be a perfectly inconspicuous shade of beige, but he still felt like he stuck out like a sore thumb.Might as well paint a target on his forehead, really.This was an area that could, politely, be called depressed.He could also think of a lot of far less polite words for it.The broad street was characterised by broken windows, buildings sprayed with graffiti, burnt out cars.The internet had also informed him that it was a notorious area for drug gangs and shoot outs.He thought it was probably true.Groups of bored youths sat on crumbling porches.They glared at him sullenly as he drove by.Feral dogs roamed the roads.Rap music at decibels high enough to make your ears bleed pumped out of a few of the houses.It looked like once, many years ago, it might have been a nice place to live.But not now.There were green areas, neglected and overgrown, that were probably, at one time, attractive parks.A few grand buildings still struggled to maintain some sort of dignity despite their decades of decay.Its heyday, if it ever had one, was long gone.Main Avenue was where the studio was supposed to be situated.He crawled along, looking for the right address.Clearly, doing this at night would be out of the question in this neighbourhood, as it might well be misconstrued.Alone and vulnerable, he felt terrified.How he would love to call Nell and hear her voice, but he didnt want anything to cause him to bottle out now.As he drove deeper into the decay, he locked the car doors and made sure the windows were firmly rolled up.The derelict houses gave way to a smattering of scruffy shops.Some were boarded up; a few looked as if they had been permanently shuttered.Only the brave continued to trade and they mostly seemed to be second hand shops or liquor stores.Olly pressed on.Eventually, he reached the right part of the long street.A glance at the address he had on his piece of paper confirmed that he was close.Small industrial units sprang up now, most of them long since abandoned.Moments later, Olly turned off into a side street.The squat building in front of him didnt look like the home of a television studio, but he was sure this was the right place.There was no sign declaring its ownership.The outside was covered in graffiti and there were no windows.The front door was covered with a metal shutter, also sprayed with colourful words.Olly pulled up in the Chevrolet and sat and stared at it.Clearly, there was no one home.He parked and got out of the car.Across the street, there was a scruffy auto repair shop  DIEGOS AUTO STOP it said above the door  and the two heavily tattooed mechanics watched his every move as he did.He hoped that they werent eyeing up his vehicle for potential spares.Was this really the right place?He guessed there was only one way he was going to find out.There was no point in knocking at the door of the Home Mall shopping channel, so he walked round the side of the building.Rubbish was piled high in the alley and a scabby dog rummaged through it.There was one of those big commercial dumpsters and, above it, a broken window.Olly checked the rest of the building.This, as far as he could tell, would be the only way of him gaining access.Glancing around him to make sure that no one was watching, he levered himself up onto the dumpster and towards the window.He pulled out a few of the sharper looking shards of glass and tossed them into the alley, then he elbowed in the rest so that there was a space big enough for him to ease himself through.He dropped down into the room below and brushed himself off, thankfully unharmed.This was some sort of storeroom, but there was currently not very much being stored.There were some empty boxes, a bit of scattered paperwork, not much more.Gingerly, he opened the door, but there was no need as, obviously, there was no one here.Olly walked into the corridor and checked a couple of other doors.Deserted offices.All shabby.Wastepaper baskets overturned.At the back, he opened a door and stepped straight into the studio he recognised from the Home Mall website that he and Nell had checked out.It was like entering another world.The fake French doors, the sunshine mural, the potted palm trees  they were all here.This space was pristine, painted in sugary candy colours and it looked Disneyesque in among the overwhelming grime surrounding it.Unfortunately, it was also completely empty So this was the right place.He wasnt sure whether he felt good or bad about that.The smartest office was at the very front of the building.It contained two desks, a computer on top of each.Both turned off.Next to one computer was a half drunk takeaway cup of coffee.It was stone cold.It could have been here for two days or two weeks.There was a bank of slightly beaten up filing cabinets just inside the front door.At the end of them, nearest to Olly, stood a baseball bat  always a useful addition to office equipment.Olly wondered what that was for.Perhaps Lolas husband had an interesting way of doing business.Hed have to be careful of that.In the corner there was a hefty safe.He wondered if Nells money was currently residing inside it.One thing about it though, a funny feeling in his stomach made him think that this part of the building didnt look as if it had been completely abandoned.Perhaps Lola Cody would be back here.In the meantime, he could at least do something to stall their efforts, to help prevent this happening to others.He took up the baseball bat, which weighed heavily in his hand, then he went back through to the studio.After a few practice swings, he smashed the potted palms, then he took out the fake French doors and punched a hole in the sunshine mural.Everything else that stood in his path in this phony set up bought it.He splintered it all into a thousand little pieces.Olly stood there breathing heavily, bat still clutched in his hand.Thanks to him, at least no more fraudulent DVDs would be made in this studio.It may not be sophisticated, it certainly wasnt legal, but it did feel very good.76      Ive just collected Petal from nursery and shes now sitting at the table eating a sandwich and chatting about her day.Im trying to concentrate on what shes saying, but my mind keeps drifting.All I can think of is Olly and where he might be.Im forcing myself not to constantly ring his mobile as its clear that hes not interested in talking to me for whatever reason.I thought that he would have called to speak to Petal by now.It must be killing him to be apart from her, if not from me.I flick on the television and find some cartoons for Petal to watch when shes finished eating.Is this how life will be from now on?Just the two of us together?I never imagined it this way.Im aware that Im still going through the motions of being a mother, but I have to force myself to click back into real life mode soon as I cant go on like this.As Im clearing away Petals plate, theres a knock on the door.Im not expecting anyone and, for a moment, my heart stops beating.Is every unexpected telephone call or ring on the doorbell going to strike dread into me?I trail down the stairs and open it.Standing there is Jenny.Hi, she says.Her voice wobbles.Can I come in?For a moment, I consider saying no.Im not sure that I want to deal with whatever it is she might have to say.I dont know where Olly is, she tells me flatly.Constance said you thought he might be with me.But hes not.Standing aside, I say, Youd better come up.Jen trips up the stairs and into the living room and I trudge behind.Instantly, Petal is out of her seat and rushing across to her.Auntie Jenny!she cries and my daughter is lifted high in the air.Hey, Jen says, crushing Petal against her.Hows my big girl?Ive missed you.Ive missed you too.Im going to watch cartoons, Petal tells her.Want to watch them with me?Jen glances at me.Mummy and I need to have a little talk, then Ill watch cartoons.She waits for my reaction, but I dont think I give her one as she adds, Maybe.Putting Petal down, she walks over to the table and takes a seat.When my daughter is out of earshot and safely ensconced in front of Shaun the Sheep, she says, Have you heard from him?As I dont know how else to handle this, I sit down opposite her.Not a thing.He didnt tell me anything, Nell.No matter what you believe.I had no idea that he was thinking of leaving.Neither did I.   Hell be back, Jenny assures me.Wherever he is, he wont stay away.How can you be so sure?Olly loves you, she says.He adores you.Petal is his life.I trail my finger through the crumbs on the table.There seem to be a lot of them.Did I give Petal her tea yet?Im sure I did.I thought you wanted my life.Jen takes a deep breath.I did, she admits.Im jealous of you, Nell.Jealous as fuck.You have a perfect husband, perfect daughter; youre doing exciting things, making something of yourself.I wanted that too.And now?Now, I just want to be your friend again.Jen sighs.Im no threat to you or your family, Nell.Im just a sad, desperate, lonely cow.Ive no bloke, no kid of my own, no career, no plan.Im just stuck at the chippy and probably will be for ever.My perfect husband isnt here now, I point out and Im not sure that even I would class Petal as a perfect daughter.But shes mine and I love her more than anything else in the world and I dont want anyone else taking her away from me.But hell be back, she reiterates.It might be today.It might be tomorrow.It might be next week.But we need to get you back on track by then, Nell.Dont let him come home to this.Her voice trails away and her gaze travels round the room.Its a bit messy.Is it?Now I look round too.A proper look.There are dishes piled high in the sink, clothes everywhere.When did this happen?When did you last spruce yourself up?I try to think, but nothing comes.It might have been in Paris or was it my wedding day?I dont know.And that makes me want to cry.Why dont you go and have a lovely long bath?Itll cheer you up no end.Ill keep an eye on Petal while I have a bit of a tidy up in here.That makes me want to cry more.Youd do that for me?Thats what friends are for, Nell.Jen gets up and comes round the table to give me a hug.Youve just had some bad knocks, love.Well all help to get you sorted.Theres no need to struggle on by yourself.Tears splash onto the table and I think theyre mine.Id like that bath.You go on, then.Leave everything to me.In the mirror, a haggard looking woman with dark circles round her eyes stares back at me.She has the hair of a harridan.Im quite taken aback when I realise that its me.No wonder the other mothers in the playground gaped at me.I look terrible.Truly terrible.No wonder Olly has cleared off.I would have done the same in his situation.Snivelling, I run myself a bath and sink into it.While I lay there, eyes closed, letting the water soothe me, I can hear Jen clinking the dishes, running the hoover round, all the time keeping up a stream of chatter with Petal.Whatever she and Olly have done  and I dont think that I want to know  shes trying to be a good friend to me now and Im so grateful for that.My copy book isnt blotless, lets face it; I have kissed Tod.I had lustful thoughts about Yves Simoneaux.There are little dark spots on my soul.Sometimes, in the heat of the moment, the right opportunity presents itself and its so hard to resist.Were only human, after all.I wonder will I feel so philosophical about things if it turns out that Olly has run off with some nubile, nineteen year old.But, if he hasnt done that, what exactly is he doing?Why doesnt he just come home?Getting out of the bath, I dry my hair and put on some make up, then I find my favourite pink cardigan and cream vintage dress that I love and get dressed.I risk facing the mirror again and, this time, a human being stares back at me.Quite a hot one.I smile and, suddenly, I look even better.The smile might not reach my heart, but pinning it on my lips makes my spirit lift.In the living room, Jenny is plumping my cushions.Wow, she says when I walk in.Someones scrubbed up well.Thanks.My lounge now looks like something out of House & Home.The dishes that were piling up in the sink have all been washed, dried and put away.Petals toys are all tidy.The clothes that were gracing the floor and the sofa have disappeared.Youve done a great job here too.Jen shrugs.Its the least I can do.She straightens up and rubs her back.Feeling a bit better?Yes.Im still not exactly ready to sing from the rooftops, but I dont feel quite as bleak as I did earlier.I can manage, I think.With the help of my friends, I can get through this.77      Olly sat outside the office of Home Mall for the rest of the day.It was only when night started to fall that he realised this wasnt the neighbourhood he should be hanging around in after dark in a hire car.Besides, no one had been back here all day and it was doubtful whether theyd turn up at night.Jet lag was now catching up with him and he was in danger of falling asleep in the car if he didnt move.A rap against the passenger window made him jump.His head spun round.Standing there was a young woman, a girl, dressed in something that looked like it might have come from the local sex shop.Hey, honey, she said.Olly groaned inside.He should have known that once dusk descended hed be a sitting duck for the ladies of the night.At least the windows were up and the doors locked.Want to taste some sugar?He wasnt entirely sure what that meant, but he knew he didnt want to.Just leaving, miss, he said.She was maybe only seventeen or eighteen.Her face was hard but he could tell that she had once been pretty.He wondered how long shed been doing this.Aw, dont go.He noticed that she weaved a little more than was necessary.Stay a while.Sorry.He held up his hand and then fired the ignition.Another time?No, thank you, he answered politely.Fuck you, she said, sweetness suddenly disappearing.Her fist banged against the window.Heart pounding, he pulled forward and then swung the car round.She was still shouting abuse at him as he drove away.Tomorrow he would leave the area a little earlier.All he wanted to do was find the Codys, not wind up in a body bag somewhere or in the boot of his own rental car.Olly had booked a motel on his mobile earlier that afternoon and he now went in search of his bed for the night.Just off the Palmetto Expressway was the Eezee Motel.It had cost him the princely sum of forty four dollars a night including taxes.As he swung into the forecourt, he could see why.A burly, bored desk clerk with one eye and a livid scar down one side of his face checked him in and handed over a key.Olly drove down the car park and pulled up outside his room door, which was right on the pavement.Not the best for security.It was a double storey building notable only for its total lack of charm.There was a tiny swimming pool, also in the car park, but the water was an interesting shade of green.It was the sort of place that any self respecting serial killer would feel right at home in.Inside the room things didnt improve much.It looked like it had last been decorated in the 1980s and that was also possibly the last time it had been cleaned.On the carpet there was a stain that could well have been blood.There was a king size bed with a rough brown cover and a bedside table that may once have been varnished.In the bathroom, the shower was straight out of Psycho.With the sole aim of keeping costs down, this cockroach ridden dump was to be his home for the next few days.Hopefully, he could do what hed come to do quickly and get home to Nell and Petal just as soon as he could.Throwing down his bag, somewhat reluctantly, Olly lay on the bed.His stomach rumbled and he remembered that he hadnt eaten since hed arrived.There was no way he was going to go out again tonight.This was the sort of neighbourhood where they took pot shots at tourists just for fun.Hunger was the least of his worries.Now he just needed to sleep, for tomorrow he had to stay sharp.He wished that he could call Nell, just hear the sound of her voice.But, if he talked to her, his resolve might well crack and he needed to stay focused on the task in hand.Instead, he flicked through the photos of his wife and his daughter on his mobile phone and went to sleep with them close to his heart.The next morning, he risked the Psycho shower and, thankfully, didnt get stabbed through the curtain.He didnt get any hot water either, but he didnt fancy complaining to the desk clerk who looked like he might want to rip his head off given half the chance.Back in the beige Chevrolet and he headed once more towards Opaville and the offices of Home Mall.On the way, he pulled in at a scruffy burger outlet and bought a breakfast treat of synthetic bun, plastic egg and dubious hamburger.But at least it was food.It didnt taste of anything but it filled a hole and he did briefly consider eating the paper bag it had arrived in for extra calories.He would have hardly noticed the difference.The coffee he washed it down with could easily have been used as paint stripper.Fortified  in a manner of speaking  Olly made his way to his stakeout point.When he arrived, the two mechanics that hed seen yesterday were still working in front of the beaten up garage on a beaten up car, albeit a different one this time.This one looked like it had bullet holes all down the side.He felt an unwelcome gulp travel down his throat.Olly held up a hand and waved in a cheery manner.Both of the mechanics glared at him and, heads down, returned to their work.Surely it wouldnt hurt to ask them if they knew anything about the owners of Home Mall.What choice did he have?There was no one else to ask anything round here.Reluctant to leave the air conditioned car, he stepped into the alley and walked across to them.In for a penny, in for a pound.As he approached, both of the mechanics looked up.He noticed that one picked up a monkey wrench and gripped it tightly.Not necessarily a good sign.Hello, guys, he said, his English accent morphing into Julie Andrews territory.Just wanted to ask a question.They didnt look impressed by that idea either.They both wore ripped sweats, grimy wifebeater vests and bandanas.They were both as wide as they were high.Each sported tattooed sleeves.It looked like they worked out.A lot.The offices over there  Olly, as casually as he could, flicked a thumb backwards  does anyone ever come and go?Depends whos asking.The man holding the monkey wrench stood and squared up to him.Ollys heart pumped erratically.But at least it was still pumping.My names Olly Meyers.Im here from England, he said, perhaps unnecessarily.The guys who own this place took me and my family for over thirty thousand dollars.Now he had their attention.The other man, still crouched by the wing of the car he was working on, whistled low through his teeth.Thirty thousand?Thats a lotta dough, man.All the money we had.And more.They cleaned us out completely.Im here to get it back.The man moved the toothpick he was chewing to the other side of his mouth.Youre one brave mother to hang round here.I have no choice, Olly said.Ive spent a lot of money and have come a long way to make this wrong right.They both nodded at that.Im Diego, the beefier of the two said.Obviously, the owner of the place.This is Andrs.He glanced up at his friend and gave a barely perceptible nod.Though he was the smaller of the two  it was a relative term  Olly was relieved to see Andrs relax his grip on the wrench.Theres a big, fat safe in there, Olly said, nodding towards the shabby offices.Id certainly like to take a look inside it.Diego raised his eyebrows at that.A safe?He pursed his lips, chewed it over in his mind as he chewed on his toothpick.Sometimes someone comes along, opens up, the man continued.He stood up and leaned on the bonnet, hood, of the car.Maybe two, three times a week.They dont stay round long.You dont know who they are?This aint the hood to be asking questions in, bro.I dont know what else to do.They havent been in a day or so.Maybe youll get lucky today.Unless the Codys had already scarpered with their ill gotten gains.But what else was he to do?Any phone numbers that hed found on the internet were all now dead.Thats my only plan, Olly admitted.The mechanics exchanged another glance.Ill ask some of the guys, Diego said.See what we can find out.Thanks, he said gratefully.Id really appreciate that.Diego smiled.One of his front teeth was gold.I like that you appreciate it.Were they laughing at him or were they really planning to help?How would he know?They could think he was some naive jerk fresh off the boat and way out of his depth.Quite probably, they were right.Still, there was nothing more he could do.Thanks again, Olly said.He didnt want to push his luck too much.Ill leave you in peace.Id like to take a trip to England, Andrs said.See Buckingham Palace and shit.Its nice, Olly said.Youd like it.If you ever come over you should contact me.He would probably run a mile if they did.They both turned back to their work, conversation closed.He left well alone and went back to his hire car.Settling himself outside the offices, he hoped that Lola Cody or someone, anyone, would turn up and answer some questions for him.He wished hed bought a newspaper or a book to read.It was going to be a long, hot day.The temperature was already climbing high and it would probably hit ninety or more before it was done.How did anyone survive summers like this?Give him good old temperamental English weather any day of the week.Switching on the radio, Olly fiddled with the buttons until he eventually found a station that wasnt hip hop.Miami Beach FM kicked out easy listening tunes.Olly risked winding down the window, but the air outside was hotter and more sticky than it had been in the car.He felt like he was in The Wire or The Sopranos or some other gritty, late night American cop drama.But this was real life and the future of his family was at stake.Then The Beach Boys came on the radio.California Girls pumped out and, for a few minutes, he pretended that he was in Miami on holiday, kicked back, and just enjoyed the tune.Thered be time enough for trouble later.78      Jen stays over.She sleeps in Petals single bed while my knobbly kneed daughter and I curl up together in mine.When does Daddy come back?Petal demands.He keeps me warmer than you.Soon, I say.Hell be back very soon.The bed just seems so empty without Olly in it.I lie there awake while my child wriggles incessantly and I wonder where he is.Where is he sleeping?Is he sleeping alone?Maybe he wants to come home but cant get back.Perhaps hes hurt?Is someone holding him against his will?Then I remember that hes taken his Vespa with him and has gone off on his own accord.His treasured record collection is still here, so Im assuming hell be back for that at the very least.Despite the fact that my husbands not here, I manage to grab a few hours of sleep and I feel significantly better when I wake the next morning.Petals nowhere in sight, but I can hear her voice coming from the kitchen.I check my phone but theres no message, no text from Olly.Nothing.When I pad through, Jen is already up and about.Shes in my dressing gown, so Im wearing Ollys and the scent of it threatens to make me feel sad again.I wrap it round me tightly.Petal is sitting expectantly at the table and theres porridge on the go.Last night Jen rustled up dinner for us out of nothing.Morning, I say with a stifled yawn.Good grief, youre organised.You need to eat something.I dont tell her that eating in the morning is now beyond my limited capabilities.Sleep well?my friend asks.Not too bad.How did you fare on the sofa?It was fine, she says.I can stay here until Olly comes back.If you want.Does she sense my hesitation?as she adds, You could do with an extra pair of hands, Nell.I think she just wants to keep an eye on me and, you know, I rather like the sound of someone keeping an eye on me.OK.Thats very kind of you.Want me to walk Petal to nursery?Then Ill go home and get some stuff?Why dont we walk Petal to the nursery together?I could do with the fresh air.To be honest, I still feel too shaky to face the mothers of the playground by myself again.We can take Dude.I think even the dog has been pining for Olly as hes been off his food like me.Yay!Yay!Yay!Thats Petal.Dude wags his tail enthusiastically.If only humans could be so easily pleased.Cool, Jen says.We all fight for the bathroom and, eventually, were all dressed and head out together.We drop Petal off at nursery and then Jen and I walk back into town.She links her arm through mine and the simple contact soothes my frayed nerves.Ill see you later, Jen says when we reach the place where we need to part ways.If you need me, just text me.Im fine.Really.Then, Youve been great, Jen.Thanks.No worries.She hugs me and I feel small against her.Im just glad that were mates again.Laters.I watch her walk away, before I say, Come on, Dude.Turning down Market Place, the dog and I walk back towards home.On our way we pass Betty the Bag Lady.No more lingering to look in the window for me.Instead, I cast a furtive glance to see whats displayed in the window.Betty still texts me regularly asking me to call her, but I have never done so.The window, as always, looks stunning.I feel so sad that we couldnt have remained friends.It would be nice to feel that I had an ally in the business and didnt seem to just constantly accumulate enemies.Still, it wasnt to be.I quicken my pace and, as I do so, the shop door swings open.Coming out is Betty.I dont know whos more shocked  me or her.We both stop dead in our tracks.Betty is the first to speak.Nell, she says.Hi.Her face breaks into a smile.Good to see you.Oh.Is it?Good to see you, too.Ive been trying to contact you for ages.I know.Now I feel shifty.I study the pavement.Im sorry Ive not returned your calls.Ive been so busy.I know!Its amazing.I shrug.It was all after Chantelle Clarke appeared on the television with one of my bags.Everything went crazy.I was so pleased to see that.A big PR agency in London organised it for me.Betty looks taken aback by that.Is it so pathetic of me to want to brag about it?I feel that it is.Ive no need to.That was me, Betty says softly.Chantelle is a friend of mine.I passed on the handbag you gave me.Now its my turn to be taken aback.It was you?Yes.I I didnt know.I was aware that Betty had some celebrity friends, but I had absolutely no idea Chantelle Clarke was among them.Thats why I was trying to call you.She desperately wanted another design.She adores your handbags.Im sorry, I say.I didnt know.Now she looks at me closely.Is everything OK with you, Nell?I realise that Betty looks her usual immaculate self and that I quite probably dont.Im fine, I lie.Everythings fine.Couldnt be better.Id love to put in an order, Betty says.Everyones been asking for your handbags in my shop.They have?Yes.Of course.Theyre great.I thought you didnt like them.Really?Why would you think that?I loved them.If Im honest, I just couldnt believe youd created them without saying a word to me.I was just stunned.Youve such a talent.I thought of Chantelle straight away.Oh.How could I have read this all so wrong?You werent mad at me for doing that, were you?I did worry that Id offended you somehow.No, no, I stammer.I just didnt realise it was you.Thank goodness, she says.I thought wed fallen out!Betty glances at her watch.I just have to shoot out, Nell, but now that weve made contact again, Id love to stock the bags.Would you let me?That is music to my ears.Not that its going to get us out of our current mess, but at least it shows that someone has some faith in me.Yes.God, yes.Ill give her the biggest discount I possibly can.Ill call you later, she says.Promise me this time youll return it.I will, I say sincerely.Of course I will.And thanks.No worries, Betty says.She touches my arm tentatively.Lovely to see you again, Nell.Her concerned gaze roves over me.Take care of yourself.Dont work too hard.Ill catch you later.She waves at me and I watch, dumbfounded, as she trips off down the street.What can I do to make it right with Betty?What can I possibly do to thank her?I have been holding a grudge against her completely without foundation.She could have thought Id turned into some stuck up bitch who believed herself to be too good to return her calls.Who could have blamed her?I havent behaved well towards her.I have blanked this woman thinking that shed spurned me, when all along it was her who orchestrated my big break.So much for Della Jewel.Looks like I did send flowers to the wrong bloody woman after all.79      In a daze of confusion, I wander back to my own shop.Outside, I stand and stare at the window.Even though I say it myself, the display looks so appealing.It still doesnt seem possible that my name is above the door.I sigh sadly.Pretty soon it may not be.I may be very grateful for Bettys order.I dont even know if weve got enough money in the bank account to cover this months rent and I cant bring myself to look.I dont even know if we have money for food, and we cant eat naffing handbags.I let myself in, make a coffee and then go and sit in the office.Now that Im alone, I try Ollys number, but theres no reply.He must still have his voicemail turned off.What should I do?I stare at the computer and the pile of post thats mounting up on my desk.The letters all look like theyre bills and I know that I dont have the means to pay any of them.I could do some sketches, think of some new designs, but whats the point?I dont even know if Ill have a business beyond the next few weeks.I could be dependent on a few bags in Bettys window rather than my own.I could be back on the market stall.I could be back in the chip shop.Sipping my coffee, I shuffle papers aimlessly.The doorbell chimes and I look up, heart in mouth.But its not Olly.Its Phil.All right, love?he says.I nod.Bearing up.We were worried.Constance and me.He holds out a big, round tin.When I look inside, theres some sort of pie topped with golden puff pastry.Chicken and mushroom.She baked it for you, so that youd have something in for your tea.Shes an angel.Tell her thanks.She was worried, love.You didnt look like yourself at all yesterday.Jens been here, I tell him.Shes been a diamond.I know.She said she was coming round.Wasnt sure how youd feel about that.All things considered.Im fine.Were fine.Shes coming to stay with me for a couple of days.Im just hoping that, by then, Olly will have made contact.Time for a coffee?No thanks, Nell.Phil pulls up a seat and lowers himself into it.I wanted to see how you are, he says, but I also wanted to talk business with you.Im not turning out to be the greatest businesswoman of all time, am I?Its a steep learning curve, Phil admits, and youve had more than your fair share of bad luck.Is it just bad luck or am I guilty of being too naive, too gullible?I want to lend you the money, Nell, he says.I can get my hands on twenty grand.Is that enough to get you out of this hole?Shaking my head, I say, I cant take that from you, Phil.We already owe you enough.Im not bothered about that, love.You know that.He shifts uncomfortably in his chair and I think how much I love this man.Hes been so good to me.Like a father.If Olly never comes home I am truly blessed by the other people I have in my life.Its just that I feel responsible for encouraging you to go out on your own.Its a big step and maybe I pushed you too much.Oh, Phil Preston.Dont even think that.None of this is down to you.I dont want to see you go under.Not when I can help.The truth of the matter is that I dont know if Im going to carry on, Phil.He recoils in shock.But you must.You cant give up so easily, Nell.You never know whats just round the corner.Something big could be on the horizon.Or there could be someone else out there waiting to rip me off, rob me of my hard earned cash, undermine my family, and destroy my self confidence.I sigh to myself.Dont give up, Nell.Promise me that.At least dont do anything until youve heard from Olly.I promise.What if he doesnt come back for weeks?Months?Or not at all?I dont voice my misgivings.Better go, he says.At least your business is thriving.Couldnt be better, Nell.Dont think that Ive forgotten the role you played in turning it around.I slapped a bit of paint about, Phil.You gave it a new lease of life.And me.Standing up, I kiss him.Youre a lovely man.Youve got a good one too, Nell.Whatevers going on in Ollys mind at the moment, dont forget that hes a good man.I wont.I walk Phil to the door and he gives me a peck on the cheek.Catch you later.Thank Constance for my dinner.He winks at me.Ive got a good one there, too.Im not going to let her go easily.Too right, I say.Im hoping Ill be coming to your wedding one day soon.You never know, Nell, he replies.You never know.That, at least, puts a smile on my face.It would be lovely if Phil and Constance could find happiness together.Doesnt that prove that, despite everything, Im still an old romantic at heart?Then, as I lift the tin with my home baked chicken and mushroom pie inside it from my desk to take it safely upstairs, my phone beeps.I have a text message.Its from Olly.Miss u, it says.All I type is, Come home.80      Olly had cracked and had texted Nell.He just needed something to connect him to home as he felt as his life had turned into a bad movie, and reality was something that was steadily slipping away.Now three days had passed and Nell had continued to text him regularly.Hed kept all the messages stored and read them over and over, but hadnt replied.He wondered what shed say to him when he eventually did go home.It depended on what happened next, he assumed.For three whole days hed done nothing but sit outside the run down offices of Home Mall.For three whole days nothing at all had occurred.For three long, hot, sweaty, sweltering, Miami days, hed stewed in his rental car, eyes fixed on the door ahead of him.Hed talked everyday to Diego and Andrs whod certainly become less wary of him, if not exactly friendly.But, so far, theyd been unable to find out anything more about the Codys than he already knew.Olly had taken to bringing sandwiches, fruit and soft drinks to keep him going through the day.But they were all warm and wilting long before noon.An ice cold beer featured heavily in his daydreams.At night he returned to the serial killer motel and, when his wide eyed wakefulness finally gave way to sleep, it was punctuated by nightmares about their home being repossessed and him fighting big dragons or snakes, or him running through forests that snatched at his clothes with Petal clutched tightly to his chest.It was fair to say that none of it was leaving him feeling rested.This morning, hed been sitting there for three hours already.His shirt was melted to him and perspiration ran down his face.His hair was stuck flat to his forehead.He wondered just how much more of this he could take.Frustration was building up inside of him.This was necessary, absolutely necessary, but it felt so futile too.Before he thought he might give in to screaming hysteria, he got out and walked further down the alley to calm his nerves.Hey, buddy, Diego called out to him.Wanna cold soda?Please, Olly said.Thats very kind of you.Diego and Andrs exchanged a laugh.Very kind.From somewhere in the back of the garage, Diego produced an ice cold Dr Pepper.Olly snapped the can opened and gulped at it gratefully.My God, thats good.Hot work waiting there every day?Yes.How long you meaning to sit it out, man?Not much longer, Olly said.Ill have to go home soon.I just didnt want to go without my money.Thatd be a tough break.Perhaps neither of them realised quite how tough it would be.Im missing my little girl.Ollys voice cracked.I just want to get back to her.Shell be wondering where her daddy is.You have a girl?Diego said.From his back pocket he produced a creased and grimy photograph of a pretty Latino girl with long black hair.I have a baby girl, too.Shes called Sophia.Olly reached for his wallet and produced his much loved picture of Petal.This is Petal.Shes four.Same age as Sophia.Shes daddys angel.Your kid is a very beautiful little lady.I know, Olly said proudly.Just like her mother.The men exchanged a grin.Sophias mother is a bitch.Left me for another man.Oh, Olly said.Im sorry to hear that.Diego shrugged.Sophia is my life.Best thing that ever happened to me.He put the photo away.I dont often get to see her.One day Ill make enough money to take her away from here.He glanced ruefully at his ramshackle garage.
