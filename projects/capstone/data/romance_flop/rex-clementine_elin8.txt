You know that means she likes you.She never talks to anyone she doesnt like.I leaned back against my own pillow and snuggled into the bed.When was the first time she talked to you?He brushed the hair from my face and smiled at me.He let out a sigh and scrunched his eyebrows together.I think it was when I met Oct.When we were ready to begin our own group.We met her and she didnt take too kindly to Octavius at first.Something about the fact at how horrible his attitude is.He smiled and pulled my hand up to his lips.Eventually they got over it.She is very quiet though and when she says something interesting, it usually means something important.I pulled the covers up around us and smiled up at him.She told me about how she found love.It was quite interesting.You met Jack then.That is a true love story.Then he isnt immortal right?I scooted closer and whispered.He is the one who she was in love with and they said that they couldnt be together.He is now.I ran my hand over Rexs head.What?Did he marry in?How though!The Gods knew!Rex laughed and kissed me gently, cupping my face before I could ask anymore questions.I dont know and if I did I probably couldnt tell you.I whined and felt myself yawn.Guess it is time for bed.He pulled me close against him.I draped my arm across his stomach and rested my head on his chest.I love you Rex.I love you too Anya.The morning sun shone on my face.I groaned and pulled the covers around me as I twisted my body in the bed.Rex was gone, I remember he said he had said he had a few appointments today.I got up from the bed and ran my hand through my messy hair.I made my way to the kitchen and skidded to a stop.I stood there in panties and a wife beater, my hair in a mess and makeup rubbed across my face.What the fuck are you doing here?Krystie turned around and leaned against the cabinets.She was wearing a black sequin dress with heels.Her pink lips crooked up into a smile.Well hello to you too princess.I came to get you.Today is the day we have to do shopping for the ceremony.Her voice dripped with honey.Ugh.Cant Cleo take me?I grabbed a cup and poured coffee into it.I dunked some cream in it and took a gulp.Sorry.We both have to go shopping.Who knows who will marry Rex.They still havent given a final remember?She raised a perfectly arched eyebrow and I downed the rest of my coffee.Whatever.I sent a cold look her way.Go wait in the car.I will meet you there.I waved my hand at her and stepped into the bathroom.I locked the door and opened my phone.I punched in Rexs number and sent him a nasty text message.I stepped into the hot shower.My phone chirped to life but I ignored it.Cant believe he let that dumb bitch in.Or did she have a key?Anger rose higher inside of me and I took a couple deep breaths.After I washed my hair and my body I stepped out and glanced at the text message.Whats wrong babe?I grumbled and sent a reply back.Your arranged marriage was here in the kitchen when I woke up.I twisted my hair and threw it up into a bun.I pulled on a black summer dress and stepped out of the kitchen.I grabbed my keys and purse and made my way outside.She was sitting in her brand new car.I scoffed and climbed into my own car.She turned her car on and pulled out of the driveway.My phone chirped and I grumbled at it.What?!Why would she be there?I shook my head.Apparently we have to go shopping.I closed the phone and took off from the driveway.We arrived at the bridal shop and I felt my stomach grow deeper.I got out and slung my purse over my shoulder.I had never bought designer dresses let alone a wedding dress.When I got marrie the first time I was measured and somebody bought my dress as a present.We stepped into the bridal shop to find a very happy woman announce our arrival.This was hectic.There were dresses everywhere.Krystie!So nice to see you!The plump woman embraced her.She was wearing black slacks and a bright purple shirt.This must be Anya.She wrapped her stubby arms around me and I froze.So nice to meet you darling.She slurred out the darling and I smiled weakly.Off to some dresses then!She pulled us towards a long row of dresses.It was an explosion of white in front of my eyes.Some had straps, some were strapless; some were puffy, some were sleek.I didnt even know what to do with myself.I was thrown into a dressing room.A dress found itself around me and I was in front of the mirror.A dress with rows of ribbon twirling down it now consumed me.A halter top wrapped around my neck and I couldnt see my feet from the voluminous tulle.No.I want a silk dress, off the shoulder, with intricate beading.The woman, whom I still havent caught her name yet, put her hand on her hip and nodded.Get back in there.She threw four dresses over the side and told me to try them on.I grabbed the first one and shook my head.I leafed through them until I found one I liked.I slid into it and smiled.It was the perfect dress.The strap slid over my shoulder and it fit my body perfectly.The beading trailed down my side and off to my hip.From there it traveled to my left leg and down where it trimmed the bottom of the dress.I twirled it around a little bit and smiled.I changed back into my normal clothes and threw the dress at the woman.Ill take that to go please.She took the dress and looked at me confused.You tried on two?How do you even expect to pay for this?This is the third most expensive dress I have.Her voice turned into a shrill as she got upset.Her face reddened and I just smiled.I have a guy, and he has this thing called a credit card.I leaned in close to her.He has a lot of money.I whispered.So if you would, I would like it to go please.I smiled and she stood still for a moment before putting my dress into a box.I looked over at Krystie who had been trying on many dresses.She was currently in a dress with poof everywhere I couldnt even tell where she was.Have fun dandelion.I waved and snatched the dress under my hand.I threw the dress into the back of my car and walked across the street to a coffee shop.The city was different than my little country town.The smell of fast food burned into my nostrils.The air felt muggy and the sky had smog.I settled down into a chair after I grabbed a coffee and a donut.Everyone else in the room can see it, everyone else but you, baby you light up my world like nobody else, the way you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed.I dug through my purse as I heard my ringtone chime in the quiet coffee shop.Hello?I answered before looking at who it was.Hey, its Cleo.Can we talk?I took a sip of my coffee and nodded to myself.It totally needed more sugar.Yeah I am at Coffee Works on 5th ave.Sweet Ill be there in like 15 minutes.Thanks.No problem.See you then.I closed the phone and placed it on the table.Outside the bustling people had slowed down.Only a few people walked among the streets.The street was nice when there wasnt anyone on it.It was like a small city in and of itself.Next to the bridal shop was a grocery store surrounded by a few more small shops.Mainly it was antique shops and mom and pop restaurants but it was definitely cute.I wouldnt mind being in a place like this but I needed land.I needed to wake up in the morning to the smell of the dew clinging to the trees.I needed to see birds flying around my backyard.I needed a space to go when I just needed to feel like I was a thousand miles away from the world but really was five steps away from the house.That is what I needed, not a city.I grabbed some more sugar and poured it into my coffee.You know that is so bad for you.I heard Cleos crisp voice behind me.I shrugged at her comment.Well I like sugar, what can I say.I sipped the coffee and made a happy noise.Much better.So what is up?She sat down across the booth from me and drank her iced tea.Well we need to talk about the ceremony.We need to talk about what is going to happen.My stomach lurched slightly.I knew this would eventually come up.I brushed the hair behind my ear and glanced up at her.The sun hit her skin just right that she didnt look pale for once.She didnt have as much eyeliner on as usual and was wearing gray as opposed to black.Well what is going to happen is going to sound pretty confusing but it will make sense when we get there okay?Two nights before you and Krystie will be taken away and put into your own house.You must not kill each other in those two days okay?She laughed and I gave a weakened smile.You will stay at this house while everything gets ready.In this time Marge will be talking to the other elders about who should be with Rex.Obviously it will be you, but they want Krystie to have a fair trial.On the last day they will tell you who will continue on with the wedding.From there on you will be able to meet with the women of the pack.We will be the ones getting you ready.Rex will have the men of the group.After that is when we start the ceremony.It wont be like a normal wedding but it will make sense as we go.They will walk you through it.Have you guys decided what will be your binding tattoo?I bit the inside of my lip and shook my head.No we havent.Damn, I knew I was missing something.Make sure you have it ready.Oct needs to know what to tattoo.She smiled and leaned back in her chair.You nervous?As nervous as I am ever going to be.Yep.I frowned at my empty coffee cup and leaned back in my chair as well.She placed a hand on my shoulder.You will be fine.Dont even bother getting nervous.She fidgeted with her cup and I looked over at her.Cleo are you okay?She shook her head no and looked up at me.Well its about Gabriel, or rather Enrique.She let out a soft sigh and frowned.Gabriel came out last night and asked me out to dinner.By the time we were going to dinner he turned back into Enrique.He was about to kiss me.Her cheeks turned pink as she said this.Oh sorry honey.I frowned.There isnt any way for Gabriel to get his own body?I whispered.What even happened do you know?She ran her hand through her curly hair and pulled it back into a bun.Yeah.I know a lot more than anyone gives me credit for.The thing is, something else happened also.I raised an eyebrow at her.I need some more iced tea though.Refill?I nodded and handed her my cup.She walked to the desk and got two more.I felt so bad for her, she fell for the one person nobody could have.She sat back down and handed me my coffee.After Enrique and Gabriel figured out the immortality they got into a huge fight.Their mother ended up dying and Gabriel was a mommys boy.He couldnt take it.Between that, his father not talking to him and his brother mad at him it was too much.Nobody knows how he did it and I dont think anyone ever will.She became quiet for a minute, just watching the people outside.We had gone on a date before he died.I really liked him but I never knew what he thought.I guess he likes me though right?He did ask me on a date.She smiled up at me but I could see the pain in her eyes.I hope you are doing okay.She nodded.Well thats the thing.She took a long sip of her drink.I thought I was falling for Gabriel, but I also had a date with Haku.I saw her cheeks blush when she spoke his name.Shut up!I giggled.Tell me about it!Nothing really happened.She had a beaming smile plastered on her face by now.He did kiss me though.I think I would rather be with him, give him a chance.I nodded a silent agreement.Thanks for being a good friend Anya.You probably realize I dont fit in with the other girls in the pack.It sucks.Dont worry I am always here.I saw Krystie leaving the bridal shop finally.Oh god it took her forever to pick.Cleo laughed at Krystie as she stuffed the bags into her car.Did you get yours already?Can I see it?Her face lit up when I told her she could.We crossed the road and I opened the trunk to show her.Oh my god it is beautiful Anya.Thanks.I just hope I will be the one wearing it.I played with the soft fabric.I told you not to worry.I have to go though.She pulled me into a hug.I hugged her back and nodded.I have to go too.I have to get to Rexs shop.She squealed and waved goodbye as she hailed a taxi.I made my way back to the car and sat for a moment.I let out a sigh as I looked at the clock.Soon I would be married and soon I would start a new life.Why was I feeling so nervous about it then?What was I scared of?Too many questions filtered their way into my head.I needed to relax.There was no way that they would pick Krystie over me.Right?Through anxiety I made my way home, about halfway there the traffic slowed.I pulled to a stop and grumbled.Ahead of me lay hundreds of cars at a standstill.Luckily next to me was Stone Ave so I pulled the car onto it and sped down it.The trees were hanging low as a rainstorm was beginning to hit.The rain started sprinkling against the windshield only for a minute and then burst into a full pour.Shit.I whispered and slowed the car down.The air had become electric with fresh water streaming from the sky.I pulled the car to a stop at a light and ticked my fingers on the steering wheel impatiently.The light flashed green and I headed straight across the four way.In a split second my whole world became white.Muffled voices swam in and out of my head in such a blur.My eyelids felt so heavy that I couldnt open them.My body was numb and the voices grew louder.What the hell happened?I dont......would that work?I cant believe you.It isnt my fault.Please dont do this.Anya?Anya can you hear me?Rexs voice cut through the garbled voices.My eyelids opened despite my body urging me to stop.A terrible throbbing was slowly filling my numb body.I was wet, from head to toe.Rain was still falling, it felt so heavy when it touched me.Anya, dont move baby.What happened?My voice was hoarse and I felt something trickling down my forehead.I tried to move my arm but it seemed to be bound down.Rex stroked the top of my forehead and looked around for something.I heard Octavius voice but couldnt understand what he was saying.A females voice filled my head as I saw someone push Rex out of the way.I reached for him but my arms were still bound.I blacked out once more.Everything was silent, everything seemed calm.I felt I was in a dream but nothing seemed to appear.When the blackness ebbed and pain overtook me I woke from my sleep.A strong sanitizing smell filled my nostrils and it was very bright.My arms had been freed and I put one over my head to cover the lights.Once my eyes had adjusted I looked up.Square ceiling tiles masked above me.I looked around and found myself in a hospital bed.I looked down and gasped at my body.My right leg was wrapped up, my left arm was in a brace and when I touched my forehead I inhaled as pain throbbed from underneath a bandage.What a great day.I whispered.I tried to push myself up into a seated position but my arm hurt too bad.There were many machines around the hospital bed.I had three IVs in my right arm and monitors on my chest.I heard a rustle and glanced over to the right of the be.There, crumpled in a chair, lay Rex.His glasses were still on, creases spiraled across his face from stress.I leaned back in the bed and tried to remember what happened.I closed my eyes and saw myself in the car once more.It was raining out, the sky was so black I couldnt see anything.I came to a stop at the light, when it turned green I pulled forward.Pain rocketed through my body once more as I couldnt remember what happened next.I felt someones hand on my shoulder and pulled back a little alarmed.Anya.Rex whispered.I opened my eyes and turned towards him.Rex what happened?He stroked my wrist and pulled his glasses off.You dont remember?I shook my head no and rolled over on the pillow to look at him better.He let out a sigh and sat on the bed next to me.You got into an accident.He motioned to my body and I bit the inside of my lip.You were pulling out and some drunk guy hit you.They say it was a miracle you survived.I felt a sickening feeling fill my stomach.A drunk driver?Miracle I survived?How did I survive?I whispered.Rex ran his hand over his head and looked up at me.His eyes were a mossy green color, one I had never seen before.Usually they were stormy blue or a brilliant blue.I pulled his hand up to my chest and held it in my own.How Rex?I whispered once more.You didnt survive Anya.What?Rexs face distorted in front of me.His forehead grew shorter, his eyes turning to a coffee color.A scream tore from my throat as his body shifted in front of me.Soon Brian was sitting in front of me.I stood shocked as a wicked laughter rose from his throat.No.I whispered.No.My voice rose and my arms were bound once more.I struggled to free myself.A syringe was pulled from a drawer and inserted into my IV.No.Dont do this Brian.A wicked smile appeared on his face and a burning sensation took over my body.The pain started in my toes and made its way up my body.A slow burning pain before I was stuck in darkness once more.No.I whispered.My eyes fluttered open and I was in the hospital room once more.I pulled myself up into a sitting position automatically.I saw Rex to the side and surveyed the room.Anya?Are you okay?He reached out to touch me but I withdrew from him.Anya its okay.He smiled reassuringly.I nodded and realized I had been suckered into a dream.I let out a soft sigh and smiled back at him.What happened?I rubbed the back of my head and touched my face where the bandage was.I winced silently and looked back at Rex.You were in a car accident.I nodded and took his hand in my own.You were driving and a car plowed into you.It was a miracle you survived.I looked down, knowing he would say that.I leaned back in the bed and looked over at him.I touched his face gently.Did you stay here the whole time?I whispered, my voice breaking.He leaned over and kissed my lips gently.I am right here baby.He whispered and stroked my forehead.So you sprained your ankle and chipped a bone in your wrist so you had to have surgery to take it out.He leaned in closer to me, the bed squeaking as he did so.You ruined the escalade pretty bad too.He had a wicked smile on his face when he said it.I smiled and leaned back against the pillow.Oops.I told you I didnt want your car anyway.Well I guess you get a new car.I hear a knock on the door and turned over to see a nurse standing there.Good to see you are up.How are you feeling?I nodded and she came over to the bed.May I take a look at your wrist?Rex released it and I handed it towards her.She unwrapped it, dried blood was fastened to the wrapping.A pain overwhelmed my arm as she unwrapped it.I looked down at my wrist.It was swollen, stitches played their way along my wrist in a zigzag pattern.She touched it a few different times and I bit the inside of my lip as she did so.Eventually she wrapped it back up.It looks okay.You should be able to go home tomorrow.If you get hungry you can either call me and I can bring you food or if you feel like walking we can go down to the cafe.Just push the nurse button okay?Thank you.I stretched my fingers and frowned at Rex.So you are getting me another car?I raised an eyebrow.He cupped my face in his and pressed his lips against mine.I could feel the hesitancy in his kiss.He was afraid he would hurt me.I pressed my lips back against his.I could feel his lip tremble against mine.Whats wrong?I whispered.He kept my head in his hands and looked into my eyes.His were a bluish green.I was worried.There is too many things happening lately.I dont want anything to ever hurt you.I nodded and kissed his forehead.I cleared my throat.What happened to the person who hit me?Rex looked away from my gaze.He didnt make it.Oh.I fiddled with my fingers before pulling Rex over to me and hugging him.I think I would like something to eat.I smiled up at him as my belly rumbled.He stood up and held his hands out towards me.I moved my legs over and looked up to Rex.Crutches?I got you.Dont worry.He smiled and weaved his arms at me.I gingerly moved my legs until they were dangling from the bed.I leaned my weight onto one leg and held onto Rex.A smirk caught my lips as I felt his muscles tighten when he grabbed me.You been working out without me?I let out a low giggle and wrapped my arm around his neck.Slowly but surely I made my way out of the room and we made our way to the cafe.About halfway there I got yelled at for not using a wheelchair and against my better judgement they forced me into one.Rex.I groaned as he insisted on pushing me.I covered my face, my cheeks turning a pink color.The cafe was at the other end of the hospital.It opened up to a large area with circular tables and an assortment of food.There were huge bay windows and a porch outside.Can we sit on the porch?I whispered and he wheeled me over to the porch.What do you want to eat?He kissed the top of my head.Anything is fine.He smiled and took off towards the food.I looked outside at the busy traffic.The sun was just as bright as in my room.The parking lot was lurking just outside and I saw a tow truck.I leaned forward as I saw it pull the Escalade up onto it.The front end was smashed it, the right side was so smushed in you couldnt tell which part used to me what.Darling!Are you okay?I heard a voice behind me and stayed still.Arms flailed around my shoulders and I saw Shaunas hair.Yeah I am fine.I smiled and her and Octavius sat down across from me.Octavius looked out the window and watched as the tow truck drove away.He let out a loud whistle and smiled at me.Rex is going to be pissed.He muttered.I nodded.I did a good job huh?Rex returned with a triumphant noise.He set down a sandwich, a soda and pudding in front of me.Rex plopped down next to Octavius and handed him a soda.So you are okay right?I mean you did something crazy.Shauna asked quietly.She grabbed Octavius drink and took some.Rex smiled at the two of them and ripped open his sandwich.I smiled up at the group and bit into my own sandwich.I am fine Shauna.I chewed my sandwich and looked over at Oct.He leaned over towards Rex and whispered something into his ear.I kicked Rex with my good leg and he smiled at me.What?I asked.Oct was just wondering if you knew how long you were out.You were in a coma for three days.Thats all.He smiled and patted my knee.Three days?I hope I didnt miss much.I gave him a weak smile and took a few more bites of my sandwich.I moved my arm and winced at the pain.Rex shot me a concerned look but I just smiled back.I looked around the table.I was supposed to be married soon and here I was sitting in a hospital.Why was more drama happening lately?All I wanted was a normal wedding and a normal life.I suppose that doesnt happen when you are marrying somebody like Rex.I let out a sigh and glanced outside.The sun was high in the sky, beckoning me towards it.I wished I could just leave this place and sit out on the beach.I looked over to Rex and knew he would do anything for me.Rex can I talk to you for a minute?My voice caught and Oct and Shauna gave each other glances.We will be back in a bit sweetie.Shauna patted my shoulder and they made their way towards the cafe.Rex pulled his chair closer to me and took my hand in his.What is wrong?His eyes were sparkling and I smiled at him.Nothing.I just want you to do me a favor.Can you bring me to the ocean?He scoffed and scrunched his eyebrows together.What?Anya you cant leave the hospital.You are still on IVs.You arent allowed to leave.I pushed away from the table but the wheelchair pushed back further than I thought it would.I squealed and Rex caught me before I rammed into a table.See Anya.He laughed and pulled me towards him.Please Rex.I pleaded.I just need some alone time.It will make me feel better.He sighed, exhausted and looked around the cafe.Give me a second okay?I will get Shauna and Oct to bring you back to your room.Thank you.I smiled and looked behind me and waved at Shauna.You okay?She asked.Yeah I am fine.Can you push me back to my room?She laughed and nodded.As we went down the hallway I noticed the rooms were mostly empty.I was the only son of a gun who had gotten hurt the past few days.When I got back to the room I rummaged around in a bag that had been sitting in Rexs chair.Shauna I dont have any clothes?Oh I brought you some.She pulled out a pair of jeans and a t shirt.Thanks.She helped me out of the horrendous hospital dress and into normal clothes.I leaned back in the bed, it was exhausting just to change clothes, how would I last at the beach?A knock interrupted my sulking and Rex stood in the doorway.He looked more awake now than he had earlier.His lines had seemed to disappear on his face and he looked like he had shaved.Ready to go beautiful?He smiled and I looked down at myself.I still looked horrendous.At least they let me go I suppose and took the IVs out.Good thing Shauna got me capris they stopped just above the wrap on my leg.My head still hurt but they gave me some pain meds to help with the pain and the bandage was gone.A small gash still was on my head but was less noticeable than the bandage.Somehow Rex got me into the car and I had to move around a few different times to find a comfortable place.I had to lean the chair all the way back and turn my foot to the right.The beach was an hour and a half away and we rode most of it in silence.The trees passed us and eventually it cleared out to houses and soon the ocean came into view.The swelling waves crashed on the rocks and I could smell the salty seaweed waft into the car.I turned towards Rex.He was concentrating on driving.We were in the Nova, he had fixed it up finally.His face had become more chiseled, or maybe it was because I hadnt seen him in days.It seemed his jaw was more pronounced.I touched his face and he smiled.I thought you fell asleep.He whispered.I laughed and looked back out at the ocean.I could feel more relaxed as we got closer.The ocean or ocean noises always seemed to be the one thing that could calm me down through anything.He passed the usual parking.Where are you going?That is where you park Rex.He flashed a smile and I looked around confused.We were making our way towards the big, rich houses.Do you have another house?I whispered.He smirked and just stepped on the gas.The sky was growing darker and I felt tired from all of the driving.
