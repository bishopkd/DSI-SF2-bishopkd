Her voice was bubbly and giggly.And he smelled perfume and makeup and a little bit of vodka.They must have pre gamed somewhere else.Thats me.How are you?She leaned closer, and her friends whispered to each other.Then she put a hand on his biceps, right under his tattoo, and squeezed her fingers.He felt like a steak being tested for doneness.Good, Kara.You?Im great.Her breath coasted over him.Yep, vodka.Hed have to give Trev a heads up on serving them.He stood up and jerked his chin toward the bar so theyd follow him.You gonna buy me a drink?she asked.Her hand hadnt let go of his arm, and he didnt bother shrugging it off.He also ignored her question.You ladies already drank?Frozen cosmos.Her eyes glittered.Ew, he thought.Well, thats good.Remember, liquor before beer, youre clear.Beer before liquor, never been sicker.She laughed and slapped his chest like that was funniest, cleverest thing shed ever heard.Ill have to remember that!He nodded.You do that.When they reached the bar, Cam placed his palm on the top and tugged on his earlobe, his sign to Trevor that they had some patrons who were on their way to drunk town.How about a pitcher of light beer on the house, ladies?Cam asked.He didnt want them ordering shots or, heaven forbid, more cosmos.Kara smiled huge, like hed just given her a diamond ring.And after extracting himself from her clutches, he resumed his post at the door.His eyes searched the bar again and this time, his gaze met Tates.Well, the side of Tates head, because she was shooting a death glare at Cosmo Kara.Then she whipped her head to him.Their eyes met, and Cam waited to see Tates reaction.She looked pissed and maybe a little hurt.Then she shook her head, her face clearing, and turned her attention back to her pool game.Cam looked around the table and noticed Marcus was right behind her, watching as she bent over the table, lining up her shot.His eyes were on her ass.And Cam wanted to throttle him.If Cam had any sense, hed turn his stool around and focus on the door and his job.Forget about Tate over there laughing at something Marcus said, her hand on his waistband, stealing looks at Cam out of the corner of her eye.Did she really want to play this game?Because Cam had perfected this fucking game in college.If she wanted Cam The Player Ruiz, shed fucking get him.He glanced at his watch.It was break time.Fucking perfect.He looked at Trevor and pointed at the clock over his head.Trev saluted back.And it was officially game time.Cam made a beeline toward Kara, then leaned down where she sat at a table along the wall with her friend.The pitcher of beer stood on the table untouched.Hey, wanna play some pool?Karas widened, and she squealed as she bounced to her feet.And Cam sighed because if he would have said that in Tates ear, she would have put on her game face, cracked her knuckles, and told him shed have his balls.He walked toward the pool table next to Tates, her eyes on him the whole time as she stood off the side while Marcus took his shot.As he drew closer, with Kara trotting behind him, Tate narrowed her eyes.Cam grabbed two pool sticks, handed one to Kara and then asked her to rack the balls.When she stared at him with wide blue eyes, he sighed and did it himself.He was a dick for using Kara, who was a nice girl.But shed caught him on a bad night, so maybe hed tell Trevor to give her a free round of shots next time she was in or something.Cam glanced over at Tate and caught her staring at them.He smiled to himself and focused back on the pool table and Karas minty breath along his temple.Game.Fucking.On.TATE STARED AS Cam stalked toward the empty pool table beside her, Kara Masters hot on his heels, staring up at him like he hung the fucking moon.Tate growled under her breath.Tate!said an irritated voice behind her, and she whipped her head around.Marcus stood with a hand on his hip, the other propped up on his pool stick.He made a proceed motion with his hand.Called your name three times.Your turn.Tate mumbled an apology and eyed the table, but her gaze kept drifting to the table next to hers, where Cam was racking the balls.Kara leaned down, chattering, her cleavage right beside his head.Cam leaned down to break the balls, shooting Tate a glance, then he turned to Kara and said something to her with a smile.Oh, that bastard.He wanted to play this game?She could play it right back.A thought trickled in the back of her mind, struggling to beat through the beer buzz she had, a thought that maybe this wasnt a good idea.That a friends truce didnt include jealousy.But one look at Karas laughter and Cams grin buried that thought under an avalanche of anger.She tugged on the hem of her shirt to lower the neckline a little and then did a flirty turn to face Marcus.She braced her hands on the edge of the pool table and rolled her shoulders back so her chest stuck out a little.Marcuss eyes darted right where she wanted them.Out of the side of her eye, she swore she saw Cam glance over.So, its been a while since I played pool, Marcus, and Im not sure Im holding my hands right, ya know?She held them up and wiggled her fingers.None of that was true.She used to have a pool table in her basement until she sold it to help pay the bills.Marcus cocked his head to the side, like he was trying to figure her out.You want me to help you?Sure!She straightened and held up her pool stick, letting it wobble in her hands.Marcus turned her around and showed her how to hold her hand on the felt, so her pool stick could slide easily in the webbing between her thumb and forefinger.His technique was actually kind of bad, but Tate played along.She stole a peek at Cam.And met his narrowed eyes.With a sharp turn of his head, he maneuvered Kara in front of him, mimicking Tate and Marcuss positions, as he directed Kara how to shoot.Tate arched her back so her butt snugged back up to Marcuss groin.His breath caught and his lips lowered to her ear.Cams face was red and he gripped Karas hip, his face pressed intimately into the side of her neck.Youre such a good teacher, Marcus, Tate moaned, eyes on Cam.She heard him say to Kara, Youre a great student, babe.Fuck, Tate, Marcus breathed into her ear.Tatum Ellison, came a sharp female voice, and Tate straightened suddenly, cracking Marcus on the chin with the back of her head.He gave a grunt of pain, and Tate turned around.Oh shit, Marcus.Im sorry!She held her hands up to see the damage but Van spoke up again.Tatum, we need to have words.Go over thereshe pointed to a table in the cornerand sit down.And you!She pointed at Cam.You go sit over there, too.He placed a hand on his chest like Who me?and Kara made some noises of protest, but one look from Van had her scurrying back to her table.Tate left Marcuss side and walked to the table with her head down.She felt like Van was going to take a ruler to her knuckles.She sat down at the table, and Cam slid into a chair beside her.Van stalked up and stood before them with her arms crossed over her chest.First of all, both of you owe Marcus and Kara an apology.Because you used them in whatever little game you were playing.Tate hung her head.Shit, that had been wrong, and she did owe Marcus an apology.She looked at Cam, and he was biting his lip.Now, we have a problem.Van tapped her foot.I thought you two were friends, right?Well, friends dont act like this.They dont get jealous of the attention the other is drawing from the opposite sex.And they certainly dont put on little performances like you did just now.Tate shifted in her chair and scratched her knee.Anything to say?Van asked.Silence.One heartbeat.Two heartbeats.Three heartbeats.A chair scraped and Cams deep voice was in her ear.What the fuck, Tate?Marcus practically had you cornered in the bar the other night and now youre playing pool with him?Because watching you flirt with every patron was killing me, and I wanted a little attention to make me feel better.Tate turned to him.Its not a big deal.Marcus and I have hung out before.We were just playing pool, not screwing in the bar.Cams jaw clenched.Wait, are you two ...are you together?Tate hesitated.No, were not together.He leaned closer.You just hesitated.Have you been together?When she didnt answer right away, his eyes widened and then turned cold.Wait, is that the guy?No ooo, Tate drew out the word.Seriously?Are you going to bring that up for the rest of our lives?No, Cam, no.If you really want honesty, Ive been with Marcus once.Last year.Thats it.No repeats will be happening.Are you happy now?The normally warm brown of his eyes swirled like a muddy river in a storm.Well damn, girl.Glad you got someone in town when you need some.Tates anger reached its peak.Oh, fuck you.What, you think I was celibate for four years?Waiting for Cam Ruiz to show up and stoop for his own leftovers?Get real.He pointed to himself.You have to flaunt it in my face?She threw her hands out to the sides.What am I flaunting?Because Im drinking?Because I dare to show my face in the same room as you?I mean, what the hell?Are you actually jealous?He made a choking sound and leaned forward, waggling his finger between them.This.This friends bullshit.It aint working.She barked out a laugh.What an Einstein you are.No shit this isnt working.Because I refuse to be a verbal punching bag.Im not going to live my life being punished for one mistake.She stood up and leaned down.So you either get over it or stop bringing it up.Because Im fucking done, Cam.He shook his head and stood up, too.Guess thats it then.Shed had him.Shed had him back for about one week.She didnt know whether to laugh or cry or throw things.Guess this truce is reversed.He looked away, his shoulders tense.Guess so.She was done.She didnt want to hear any more and as she walked toward Van, who wore a devastated look on her face, she heard a Hey, Tate.She stopped and looked at Cam over her shoulder.What?His eyes were calmer, the storm over.His voice was softer when he spoke.Ill still be there Wednesday to drive your dad.She wanted to refuse.She wanted to tell him to go to hell, that shed find her dad another ride.But that would take a lot of scrambling.She didnt have the time or energy, and despite her anger and hurt, she knew she could count on Cam not to let her down.Her responsibility to her family won out.So she just nodded, and then walked to Van.Her best friends arms encircled her, and Tate waited until she was outside the bar to break down and scream and throw things.Because Van was there to pick up her pieces and put them back together.Then Van drove Tate home, helped her and all her pieces into bed, whispering that shed be put back together again by morning.But this time, Tate didnt think so.10      CAM SIGNED INTO Utope, biting his nail and jiggling his leg.Hed acted like an asshole last night.Hed used Kara and hed said some shitty things to Tate.He wanted to blame the alcohol for his actions but hed been sober.Stone cold sober.Also jealous.And pissed off.He signed into their game and waited for a notification to pop up letting him know that Tate had played the game.He almost wanted her character to slap him.Or yell at him.But after five minutes of staring at the screen with no notification, he had to face the truth that she hadnt played.She didnt want to communicate with him.His fingers ran over the smooth buttons, the controller warm in his hand.He wanted to do something.Apologize or reach out somehow.But he didnt know what to do.So instead he shut off the game and went to check on his mom.TATE WALKED ALONGSIDE her dad in the grocery store while he rode one of those motorized chair carts.She tossed in a box of crackers on an end cap and rolled her eyes when he made a screeching sound with his mouth as he took the turn as fast as the cart would go, which was not very fast.Years ago, when she first helped him into the chair cart, shed thought hed hate it, or complain that it made him feel weak.But she should have known that hed take every opportunity to act like a kid again.He zoomed that thing around the store like he was hot shit.He echoed the high pitched beeping when he backed up.He practiced complicated turning maneuvers.He waved at other shoppers like he was royalty.He even had the cupped hand wave down.She pretended to be annoyed, but she loved how happy it made him.He grabbed a bag of white cheddar popcorn off the shelf and threw it in the cart.She glared at him.He glared back.It says its healthy, he pointed out.Yeah, in relation to a bag of greasy chips.But that popcorn isnt exactly healthy.I like it.She sighed and kept walking.So, Cam going to join us for doughnuts again anytime soon?He watched her face as he asked the question.Tate faked an extreme interest in the nutrition content of a frozen pizza.Her truce with Cam had lasted ...not long.Before they both blew it by acting like middle schoolers at recess.Every time she thought about that night at the bar last week, her stomach churned.Because shed used Marcus, got yelled at by Van, and still smarted from the barbs that had flown from Cams mouth.Why did he have to be home?And mess up her ordered life.Shed had it all figured out until Cam showed up.Tatum?She threw the box of pizza into the cart and began to walk.We never get sausage, her father said, leaning to the side to put it back in the freezer case.It was sausage?He nodded and nudged the cart closer to her.Whats going on?Nothing.You want to talk about how you feel about Cam being back?She did not.No, thats okay.Tate kept walking as she heard the whir of the cart at her heels.You want to talk about your breakup?No.No, no, no.She definitely did not want to do that.Shed rather rip out her eyelashes one by one.No, Dad.Because I think theres a lot of things unresolved there, he pushed.Unresolved?There wasnt a word to describe the clusterfuck that was her breakup with Cam.She whirled around.Dad, first of all, I dont want to discuss this.And I certainly dont want to discuss this in the freaking grocery store.He didnt back down.And those eyes didnt waver from his face.Its hard to find time to talk to you when you arent working or dead on your feet.She instantly deflated.Shit, Dad, Im sorry, I  He shook his head.That wasnt to guilt you.Youre busy and I appreciate everything you do for this family.But sometimes I think you take on more responsibility than you need to.How did he get from the Cam breakup to this?I dont  Why didnt Cam know about my cancer?She froze.That was a complicated answer.I ...um ...I never told him because we broke up ...He cocked his head.You didnt think hed still want to know?Tate looked down at her feet.She wanted to blurt out the whole sordid tale.Flop in her dads lap and cry while he smoothed her hair and told her it would all be okay.But instead, she mumbled, Probably.Baby, he said softly.She looked up, glad that the grocery store was rather deserted for an early Monday morning.Not trying to be hard on you, but sometimes decisions we make have a ripple effect on a lot of people.And thats okay, but you want to make sure those ripples dont turn into tidal waves, all right?This was weird, like he knew everything.Or maybe he suspected, but either way, all she could do was nod.He seemed satisfied with that, and started up his cart, driving past her so she had to jog to catch up.While loading the gallon of milk in the car, she changed the subject.So, I think Annes dropping off a casserole tonight.Her father pretended not to hear her.I think its that chicken spaghetti thing.Isnt that your favorite?He turned his head away from her and she suppressed a laugh.She teased him about Anne.About the crush the two had on each other but seemed to want to avoid.I think shes going to stay and eat it with you.He lifted his nose in the air, still ignoring her, and she relished getting him back for giving her a hard time earlier.She said she might wear her new black lace lingerie.What?!he cried, whipping his head to look at her.And she cracked up, clutching a container of a dozen eggs to her stomach as she doubled over.His eyes narrowed.Youre full of shit.She laughed harder.I got you to answer me.Brat, he muttered.Ill light some candles for you and turn on some Kenny G.   You turn on that music, and Ill smash the stereo.Temper, she tsked.How about Anne and I go out for burgers and you and Cam can share a nice intimate dinner over chicken spaghetti casserole?Tate sobered.Not funny.Her dad grinned.Put on some Marvin Gaye?He started swaying in his chair and snapping his fingers.Ive been really tryin, baby, he crooned.Oh God, Tate groaned and glanced up and down that empty aisle.Her dad kept singing.Lets get it on ...Im your daughter and this is super inappropriate.Lets get it on ...Im leaving.She stomped off down the aisle with the sounds of her fathers laughter behind her.ALMOST A WEEK since that night at the bar, Cam still hadnt made any plays in Utope.He checked every morning and every night.He saw that Tate had signed in on her end.But neither of them seemed willing to make the first move.It was an awkward virtual standoff.Both too stubborn to admit theyd both been out of control and immature.At least thats what Cam was telling himself.He glanced at the clock.He had a little bit of time before he had to pick up Ted and take him to his appointment.Because no matter what happened with him and Tate, hed never let her family down.He peeked into his moms bedroom and frowned when she wasnt there.Then he checked her bathroom, which was empty.Finally he found her in the basement, reaching for something on a shelf.Mom!He hadnt realized she was standing on a stool and at the sound of his voice, she started and almost fell off.Camilo!she said with a shaky hand to her chest.Why on earth are you shouting?He was at her side in seconds to steady her so she didnt fall.Whatre you doing down here?If you needed something, I couldnt have gotten it for you.She pressed her lips together.Yes, I realize that.But I was capable of walking down the stairs, stepping on a stool and getting a roll of paper towels.I didnt say you werent capable.She stepped down off the stool slowly, the roll of towels tucked under her arm.He followed her up in the stairs to the kitchen as she placed the paper towel roll on its silver holder by the sink.Youve been such a huge help to me already this summer.Between doing things around the house and the extra money, but I dont want to rely on you forever.He took a step closer, leaning a hip on the counter.Why not?She faced him.Because youll leave this fall.Youll take that job, and youll live your life.Mom  Im glad you came home after graduation.Its been wonderful to wake up every day with you in the house.You cant know how much it means to me that you did this.But I cant be the reason you stay here.I just cant.He reached for her hand.Ma ...This where you tell me youre grateful to your single mama for raising you?He shook his head.This is where I tell you again how unfair it was when I got grounded when I was six for cutting our cats whiskers off.She scowled.He kept walking into walls, you hooligan.Cam laughed.Okay, so other than the grounding thing  You were a bad boy sometimes.Im grateful, Ma.And I guess I wanted to show you that.By being here for you.She smiled and stepped closer, gripping his forearms in her hands.And I get that, Camilo.But the best way to repay me is for you to be happy doing what you love.If thats here, bouncing in a bar?Fine.But if its not, and you want to take that job, then you take it.You understand?He lucked out with a great ma.Yeah, I understand.She squeezed her hands and then released him.Good.And all I ask is that before you go, Id like you to help look into moving somewhere cheaper.A small apartment, all on one floor.That would cut expenses so my disability check would stretch farther.I looked into a couple of places already.Sure they rented this place, but still, theyd lived here for over ten years.No problem, Ma.She smiled.Youre a good man.He hugged her and pressed a kiss to her temple.A glance at the clock told him he needed to leave to pick up Ted.Need to run to get Ted.Youll be okay?Not sure if Ill be home for dinner.She paused and did that thing where she ran her tongue over her teeth, like she was searching for the words.He waved a hand.Out with it.What do you need to say?She glared, like it annoyed her he could read her.Then she huffed.You need to think about the long term repercussions of getting involved in Tates life again.Oh great, this again.He clenched his jaw.Im not  She pointed a finger at him, Yes, you are.Youre helping her out and making her rely on you.Now, Ive never been that girls biggest fan.Ill be the first to admit I think you two were too young to be as involved as you were.But now youre adults.And you need to think about what it means to be doing what youre doing with her.Im here so I should help  But why you  Because I should have been there this whole fucking time, Ma!he shouted and winced when his mom jolted at the sound of his voice.Because I left and her life went to hell and even if she made choices that contributed to that, she didnt make her dad get cancer.She deserves a break.She raised her chin in the wake of his outburst.Im not saying she doesnt deserve a break.But you need to think about how that weight is going to feel like double on her shoulders when you leave again.The guilt nearly choked him.Well, I cant do anything about that right now.Im here and I cant just stand by now.She patted his shoulder.I know.But just think about it.He didnt.On the drive over, he blasted music and thought about getting drunk later so he didnt have to think about it.At the Ellisons, Cam parked in the empty drivewayboth Tate and Jamie appeared to be at workand walked to the front door.He knocked once and heard a muffled Come in.The doorknob turned, and Cam frowned at it when he noticed the screws were a little loose.Hed have to tighten them later.Hello?he called, shutting the door behind him.Bathroom.Be out in a minute!Ted called back.Cam stuck his hands in the pockets of his shorts and grabbed an apple from a basket on the kitchen counter.He bit into the crisp fruit and chewed as he walked around, checking out the pictures framed on the wall.There were still the pictures of all the homecoming dances hed taken Tate to.And the prom.The graduation picture where they stood laughing under the archway of their school in red and black gowns.Some new ones had been added, but the difference was noticeable.A couple of pictures from holidays, it looked like.In them, Jamies eyes werent as bright.Ted was losing weight.And Tate ...she never looked at the camera.And she wasnt smiling.Cam walked back to their prom picture.Hed rented an all black tux and Tate had worn an emerald dress, her whole look like something out of Breakfast at Tiffanys.Theyd won prom king and queen their senior year.And Cam smiled sadly thinking of how theyd danced together with their plastic crowns.Taking a little stroll down memory lane, huh?said a gruff voice from behind him.Cam turned around as Ted walked slowly down the hall toward him.The older man jerked his chin toward the pictures.Tate tried to take them all down a year or so ago.But we realized the paint had faded and none of us wanted to paint again, so we left them up.Im glad.I like looking at em.Cam resisted flinching at the thought of Tate wanting to take down all the pictures.But then, he couldnt blame her.Hed ripped them all off his walls and shoved them into a shoebox.Hed wanted to burn them, but his mom had intervened.Good choice, Cam mumbled, and walked into the kitchen to throw his apple core away.He washed his hands and walked back out to the living room.How ya feeling?Same shit, different day, Ted grunted.Hed said that for as long as Cam could remember, so it made him smile.You ready?he asked.Ted walked toward the front.Already ahead of ya.Cam ducked his head and smiled bigger.Ted was quiet on the drive, lost in thought.Cam fretted that maybe he was in pain, or feeling sick, or a multitude of other things, but the guy was a grown man.If he wanted to talk about it, hed start the conversation.So Cam kept silent, fussing with the CD player.And it wasnt until twenty minutes into their forty minute drive that Ted spoke up.I need you to help Tate with Jamie.Teds voice was so low, Cam barely heard him.Im sorry?Ted cupped his knees and then ran his hands up and down his thighs.His jaw worked.Tate doesnt hide things as well as she thinks she does.I know Jamies not been himself lately.Cam tongued his cheek.Jamie was worse than just not himself.But Cam didnt want to say too much and betray Tates confidence, but he did think Ted had a right to know what was going on.He chose to stay silent.Ted sighed.Ive tried to talk to him, but he avoids me.He comes home when Im at appointments or when he knows Im resting.He shook his head.I got sick at a bad time.When he really needed a father who was present.I think hes angry and lost, and I wish I knew how to help him.Cam tapped the steering wheel.Do you want me to talk to him?Ted looked over and nodded.Yes, Id like that.He always listened to you.Cam didnt think he had sway over Jamie anymore, but he held his tongue.Ted continued.I know you and Tate are ...well ...not what you were.So if you dont want to do it for her, then do it for me.Cam didnt even have to think about it.Ill do it for all of you.Ted stared at the side of his face, and Cam resisted meeting his eyes, because he wasnt sure he wanted to see what was in those watery hazel eyes.You grew up into a good man, Camilo Ruiz.Ted patted his shoulder.And Cam had to blink at the prickle in his eyes.Would Ted still think that if hed seen how Cam treated Tate the other night?Shit, this was hard being back.I told Tate youd want to know Jamie is ...not himself, Cam muttered.Ted licked his lips and his eyes shifted.It was minutes before he spoke again.My girl means well, but shes going to have to learn she cant keep making decisions for everyone else.Those eyes bored into his temple and when Cam risked a glance at him, Teds eyes were piercing, like he was trying to convey more than just what his words meant.But Cam couldnt read minds.And he didnt get it.And by the time theyd reached the doctor, he hadnt gotten up the nerve to ask Ted to elaborate.11      TATE?CAM CALLED into the house.Hed dropped off Ted at the clinic, and the doctor had said Ted would have to stay overnight.Ted told Cam he didnt need a ride home and that hed call Anne so Tate wouldnt have to worry about it.Cam picked up his phone to text Tate to tell her, but he hesitated.He hadnt seen her since the previous week, and this was a good excuse to check on her.He called himself a fool about fifty times on the drive to Tates house, but that didnt stop him from pulling into her driveway, turning off his truck, and heading to her front door.Cam knocked and listened for an answer.Instead, he heard raised voices.He turned the doorknob and found it unlocked.So he stepped inside and followed the voices until he reached the back of the house.Through the sliding glass door, he saw Tate and Jamie on the back porch, facing off to each other, bodies tense.Youre out of control!Tate yelled.It took me a week to be able to corner you long enough to have a five minute conversation with you.You think I dont have enough to deal with?I have to worry about you drinking and getting arrested now?Jamie fluttered his lips.Fuck you.You act like youre so perfect but youre just as fucked up as me.Tate threw out a hand.What the hell is that supposed to mean?Cam backed away, thinking he should leave the siblings to argue in peace, but Jamies next statement stopped him cold.Dont get preachy at me when everyone knows youre just a cheating slut.Tate reared back like shed been slapped.And Cam was out the door.He didnt even shut it behind him as he bore down on a Jamie who looked equal parts furious and terrified.But Cam didnt give a fuck.He hoped Jamie pissed himself.Cam backed Jamie against the railing and leaned down so their faces were inches away.When he spoke, he kept his tone even but no less deadly.Dont you ever, ever speak to your sister like that again.Apologize to her.Right now.Jamies eyes shifted beyond Cams shoulder, but the sight of his shattered sister must not have been enough for him to grow a fucking conscience.I dont need to apologize to her when its the truth  Jamie.Apologize right the fuck now.The kid gathered some courage from somewhere and straightened his spine.You of all people should be happy someone finally said to her  Cam leaned even closer, using all his willpower not to knock Jamie out with a fist.No, in fact, Im not happy.Im not happy at all.Unless a woman is your wife or your girlfriend, its not your concern who she gets into bed with.But she cheated   And thats between her and me.No one else.If I hear you use that word in your sisters direction again, swear to God, you wont like the consequences.Do you hear me?Jamie gulped and his eyes shifted again to his sister.Cam took a step back and followed his gaze.Tate stood in the same spot, her face white, her entire body slack, like she barely had strength to hold herself up.She stared at them, but her eyes were blank, like she wasnt really seeing anything.I dont want to apologize, Jamie said, and Cam whipped his head to face him again.Jamie kept his eyes on his sister as he spoke.You did what you did and made him leave.And then Jamie whirled on Cam.And you.You didnt fight.You didnt fight for her.You left.You just us.He jabbed his finger into Cams chest on the last word and then took off into the house, slamming the door behind him.A minute later, Cam heard the sound of Jamies car starting up, and the squeal of tires as he took off down the street.Cam stared at the door and then took a deep breath as he turned to Tate.She still hadnt moved.She stared at the place Jamie had been standing.Tate?Nothing.Tate?Finally she looked at him and blinked.But then her eyes went big and dark and so full of pain, he thought maybe it had been better when she had looked blank.Hows dad?she asked, her eyes a little unfocused.Hes fine.He said hed call Anne to give him a ride home tomorrow.Tate nodded.Good, thats good.She sucked in a shaky breath.I have to ...she waved a hand and walked unsteadily into the house.Cam followed her, cursing himself for staying, for overhearing that conversation, for feeling sympathy for Tate.When he entered her bedroom, she was perched on the end of the bed, staring at her blank TV.Are you going to be okay?Her jaw worked.I didnt ...I didnt think about Jamie.That hed find out.He sighed.Small town.People talk.She dropped her head and stared at her hands in her lap.He hates me now.He doesnt hate you  He called me a slut  Cam clenched his jaw and spoke through gritted teeth.And Ill have a talk with him about that  It doesnt matter, she whispered.It does matter.He cant talk to you like that.Whats done is done.The finality of her words pierced his chest.He took another step toward her even though he wanted to take a step out of the room.Something you did four years ago doesnt define you.Thats not all you are.Its not?Tate looked up at him, her expression full of hope and he didnt know what the hope was for.He wanted to be in her life, but he couldnt go down that road again.He needed to get out of here.He backed up toward the door.Look, no offense but if you want to give an explanation just to ease your conscience, I got better things to do  Im not trying to give an explanation  Good, because I dont want details  She slammed her fists down into the mattress and yelled, Well thats good!There are no details, because I didnt do it!Cam froze, resting his weight back on the ball of one foot.What did you just say?She wasnt looking at him.Instead she was staring at that damn TV again.I didnt do it.The words were clearer this time.Louder.And Cam knew this was one of those moments.A life changing moment.Where he could stay and hear her out, get pulled back into her life.Or he could leave.Go back to the way hed accepted his life.Without her.His body rocked, back toward the door, forward.If he lowered his heel to the ground, hed keep walking backward.Hed leave.But his heart, his foolish heart that wanted to hear her out, pulled him forward and then he was sinking down onto the bed beside her.They sat in silence until Cam spoke.Well, I guess Im going to need an explanation now.She stared ahead as she talked, and every word was like a baseball bat slamming into his gut.Dad had just been diagnosed with cancer.And I couldnt call you at basic.And ...all I could think about was that I was going to have to stay here.In Paradise.I couldnt leave and go to college with you.But ...I wanted you to stay on track.I wanted you to finish school and get a great job and ...She took a deep breath.I didnt know how I was going to convince you of that.I know you and I knew if I told you, youd come home.Thats the last thing I wanted.So I went to this stupid, stupid party.She shook ahead and dropped her eyes to her lap again.And this guy was really drunk and hitting on me and I was drunk and I let him lead me to the bedroom.She twitched her lips.Ill be honest that I thought about sleeping with him.He leaned in and kissed my neck and thats when it hit me that this was wrong.It was so wrong.So I shoved him back and told him no.And then he threw up on me, and fell on the bed and passed out.Justshe giggled softlypassed right the fuck out.
