Caroline shook her head.I cant understand how women arent falling all over themselves to get with them.Maybe because they have taste?the man said, his brown eyes shining as he grinned down at her.Not sure if you remember me, but Im Mike Stevens.We had English junior year with Mrs.Selk.Caroline remembered a skinny kid with Coke bottle glasses and long hair whod sat behind her named Mike, but this guy looked nothing like him.He was clean cut, from the almost shaved head to the collared shirt and khakis.Mike.Right.You look good, she said.You too.And he did look good.Taller than her with lean muscle and a nice smile.No tattoos or piercings in sight.So, what do you do for a living?she asked.I own a computer repair shop on Oak Avenue.Self employed and tech savvy.A nice, stable guy.What about you?he asked.Im starting a consulting business.Ive spent the last eleven years managing and flipping bars, but I wanted to come home.Instead of trying to buy and flip another bar here, I figured I could travel for work but still be home to spend time with my sisters.Yeah, I saw Ellie hanging around.Yeah, well, she sort of bailed without telling me.Hot date.If you want, you can join me and a few of my friends, he said.Caroline wasnt in the mood to socialize with a bunch of strangers, no matter how nice Mike seemed.Thanks, but I think Im going to just take off, she said, holding out her business card to him.But maybe another time?My cell is on there, if you want to get dinner some time.Mike took the card and slipped it into his wallet.Ill give you a call, then.Oh, and thanks for helping me out with the Coulter brothers.No problem.Any time.Caroline headed toward the exit and bumped into Ellie as she was coming back in.It didnt take a genius to see Ellie had been crying.Hey, you okay?Im fine, Ellie said, wiping at her cheeks.I was just coming in to tell you Im taking off.Me, too, Caroline said.We can walk out together.Ellie didnt argue, but she was quiet the whole way out to her car.Are you okay to drive?Caroline asked.Sure.I only had one drink, Ellie said, slipping her key into the door.Plus, its not like I have to go far.Before she could think, Caroline said, I just want to say that if this guy doesnt treat you right, he doesnt deserve you.Thats sweet, Ellie said, the darkness shrouding half her face.Clich but sweet.Caroline didnt have a response to that as Ellie climbed into the car and started it up.Caroline had begun weaving back through the cars to where she had parked when she heard a drunken giggle.Dance with me.Nearby, a very drunk Kirsten was dancing up against a guy.With sparse lighting in the lot, it was hard to make out the guys features.Give me your keys, a deep voice said.A voice Caroline was very familiar with.Gabe.She heard a jingle.You want them?You gotta find them.Rolling her eyes, she passed them and continued on to where shed parked.At least Kirsten wouldnt be driving.Then, in the dim light, Caroline noticed something on her window.Pulling out her phone, she flipped on the flashlight app and saw that someone had written all over her car with what looked like shaving cream.Bitch.Whore.Leave.Charming, she muttered, wondering if she should call the Rock Canyon Police Department to report vandalism.Unlocking her car, she grabbed some napkins from the glove department and started wiping at her window.Caroline heard footsteps behind her but didnt look.Hey, isnt that her?Yeah, Im surprised she even had the nerve to come back to town.I heard her dad kicked her out because she refused to go to rehab for her coke addiction.Seriously?Giving the windshield one more swipe, she turned around to catch two women she didnt recognize passing her.Actually, it was sex addiction.If youre going to spread gossip, at least be accurate.They hurried away, and she called, Have a nice night.Great.Miss Know It All will probably have that rumor by tomorrow.Caroline climbed into her car and flipped on the headlights.Her wipers and cleaning fluid helped a little, but she was going to have to take her car through a wash before the shaving cream sat too long.The smell of smoke and bar funk filled her car.With the place packed so full, it had been impossible not to get funkified.Ugh, she wanted a shower.As she pulled out of her parking spot, her headlights illuminated Gabe and Kirsten, locked in an embrace.For some reason, seeing them together, so close they could be making out, made her grip the steering wheel harder.She didnt like Kirstens draping herself all over him like that, and why was he letting her, anyway?For someone who doesnt care about him, you sure are getting pissy.Caroline suddenly realized shed been sitting there too long with the glare of her headlights on them.And Gabe was looking right at her.Shit.Pulling forward, she drove past without looking at them.She hoped he couldnt see who was driving, but hed probably recognize the car.Damn it; she didnt want him thinking that she was spying on him, because she wasnt.She didnt care who or what he did, as long as it wasnt illegal and didnt affect her.Which is why you were basically Fatal Attraction stalking him, right?Fuck, the voice in her head needed to shut the hell up.Okay, so she was attracted to him.So what?She was attracted to lots of jackasses, and not one of them had turned out okay.This was her chance to turn over a new leaf and not follow her same old patterns.No dirt bags, assholes, or criminals.Item number two put Gabe smack in the middle of the undesirable list.It took about fifteen minutes to go through the car wash at Mr.Nelsons Chevron station.Once she was finished, she headed down Main Street to Oak Avenue, pulling down the alleyway slowly, just in case she hadnt beat Gabe home.The spot was empty.After she parked, she climbed out of the car and took a deep breath as she tried not to run for the stairs.No matter how many times she told herself that Rock Canyon was a safe place, the fact was, her rapist worked with her father just a little way down the street.And shed accidentally forgotten her Mace and Taser tonight.But she wasnt worried about Kyle making trouble, especially since he had no reason to.Shed kept his secret.Still, the quiet of the alley was making her nervous.She glanced over her shoulder nervously before rushing into the apartment the minute her key turned the lock.The door slammed harder than shed intended, her heart pounding against her breastbone as she twisted the dead bolt into place.She was jumpy as hell and had no idea why.Just nerves, she supposed, but shed lived in way rougher places than this.Maybe it was because she still hadnt shaken the run in with Kyle, and tonight, Wayne Coulters cold blue eyes and tight grip on her arm had brought on a rush of unease.Not that the two men looked alike, but the expression in Waynes eyes had reminded her of Kyles: untouchable, able to get away with anything.And why not?He had.Aside from Shelby, who obviously hadnt cared, shed never told anyone what Kyle had done.Shed simply shoved that bag of bloody sheets under a loose floorboard in the back of her closet and kept quiet.It was her fault that hed been allowed to move on and become successful.There had been so many chances for her to come clean, but every time she found an opening, Kyles words would creep back in.If she tried to press charges, would he hurt her sisters?Kyle was sick, but as long as she didnt give him a reason, he would stay away from Ellie and Val.But now with Kyle being nearby, Carolines old fears had returned.Though she wasnt as worried with Justin staying at the house most nights, what about Ellie?Any time she left the house, she was vulnerable.It wasnt the first time Caroline had worried about her sisters safety since Kyles threat.A few weeks after he raped her, Caroline still hadnt been able to sleep without the nightmares.Every night, shed dreamed of Kyles attacking her, only in her dreams, she felt and remembered everything.But one day, just as she was at her wits end and had been ready to tell her father, shed shown up at her sisters school to walk them home ...and they hadnt been there.Shed been frantic, racing to the house to see if they were there, but they werent.Shed called Vals phone, but there was no response.Just as she was about to call the police, Val and Ellie had come through the door with ice cream cones ...and a smiling Kyle behind them.Caroline hadnt been able to breathe.When shed told Kyle he needed to leave because her dad wasnt home, hed just smirked at her.Ill see you around, then.The minute Kyle was out of the house, shed dead bolted the door and started yelling at Val and Ellie that they were not to go anywhere alone with Kyle.Despite their confusion, shed dragged a promise out of them and went upstairs to her room.Once inside, shed closed the door and slid to the floor against it, sobbing.Now, Caroline headed into her room, and when she went to open her dresser drawer, she realized her hands were shaking at the memory.Get a grip.Kyle has no interest in you anymore, and youand your familyare perfectly safe.Gathering up her night clothes, she went down to the bathroom to shower.She was just getting ready to turn on the water when she heard the front door open.Hearing Kirstens high pitched giggle, followed by Gabes low voice, helped Caroline relax.She felt better having him there, which was mind boggling, because she had left her sisters to get away from all of the noise.Letting the heat rush over her body, she scrubbed herself until the water ran lukewarm.After drying off and pulling on her pjs, she stepped out of the bathroom and saw Kirsten dancing unsteadily in the dining room.Kirsten stopped dancing when she noticed her.What are you doing here?I live here, Caroline snapped, hardly glancing at the confused blonde when she caught sight of Gabe by the coffeepot, holding two cups in his hand.Their eyes locked, but she couldnt get a bead on what he was thinking or feeling.Doesnt he feel guilty for bringing home a girl who is obviously too drunk to make good choices?But Kirsten was a grown woman who had made the decision to get stupid drunk.And Gabe was making her coffee.It wasnt like hed spiked her drink.Like Kyle did to you?Caroline hated that Kyle was so fresh in her mind.Im going to bed.Try to keep it down.Gabe had the audacity to shrug.I make no promises.Stomping down the hallway, she resisted the urge to slam her door.Why are you mad?Hes not doing anything wrong.She didnt answer her inner voice.Caroline realized shed forgotten to brush her teeth and walked out of her bedroom again.Gabe and Kirsten were no longer in the kitchen.Another giggle came from behind Gabes closed door.She brushed her teeth quickly and went to bed, finally slamming the door again before she could stop herself.Shes too drunk, and he should know better.The thought came unbidden and caused her to catch her breath, trying to bite down the panic.This happened sometimes.Shed catch the harsh scent of a cologne, reminding her of the one Kyle had worn that night.Or shed taste that same cherry flavor that reminded her of the drinks Kyle had spiked.Or shed see a girl who was out of control from drinking too much.Closing her eyes didnt help, but she did it anyway and clenched her fists until her nails dug painfully into her palms.That night was still a blur, with patches of memory missing throughout, and that was almost more terrifying.Remembering the disorientation as she came in and out of consciousness.The heavy feeling of him on top of her, inside her.The pain so sharp it had made her sick.She remembered vomiting over the side of the bed and his laughter.He always seemed to be laughing at her.He was still laughing at her.Taking slow, even breaths, Caroline grabbed her iPad from her dresser and her Wi Fi plug.Nothing could chase the past away, but sometimes an episode of The Big Bang Theory could push the memories back down.Caroline set the iPad up on her nightstand and rolled onto her side, concentrating on the characters on the screen instead of the demons in her past.Eleven Ive been told if you want to find a good man, look at the way he treats his mother.I disagree.You want to find a good man?Watch the way he treats his dog.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE WOKE UP to the sound of the front door slamming.Rubbing her hands over her face, she glanced at the clock next to the bed and groaned at the red 6:07 A. M.  mocking her.Climbing out of bed, she went to the bathroom and brushed her teeth.After washing her face and twisting her hair up in a clip, she came out of the bathroom and smacked into Gabe.He grabbed her, steadying her, and she caught herself staring up at him.The lids were heavy over his obsidian eyes, as if he were only half awake.His face sported some scruff that made him look a little less perfect but no less handsome.His warm, firm grasp on her arms felt good, and the close proximity made it hard to resist stepping into him and snuggling against that hard chest.Would he wrap his arms around her, or would he pull away?You okay?he asked, his voice gravelly with sleep.Are you okay?No.Youre fantasizing about a man you despise, who takes advantage of drunk women.Stop it.It still took her another moment to pull away.Yeah, just sleepwalking.Im guessing that was your sleepover guest who slammed out of here.Yeah, she was running late for something.Nothing like the walk of shame on a Thursday morning.I wouldnt know, Gabe said, running his hand up and over the top of his head.His muscles flexed and bunched as he moved, and she silently told her body to stop swaying toward him.He wasnt hot, and she needed to stay away from him.Youve never left a girls apartment after a one night stand?Caroline asked, taking another step back.Not that I can remember, he said, moving around her into the bathroom.Spreading toothpaste on his toothbrush, he added, And I dont usually have overnight guests either.Aw, so Kirsten is special?How romantic, Caroline said sarcastically.Without giving him a chance to respond, she walked out into the living room.She was angry again, wondering what had happened to Kirsten after Gabe had taken her back to his room.Had she woken up this morning with a fuzzy recollection?Had she realized what had happened and regretted it?Needing something to do, anything to occupy her, she grabbed a few of the empty boxes left over from unpacking and headed for the front door.Actually, Im just not as big of a dick as you seem to think I am, Gabe called after her.Caroline dropped the boxes to open the door and turned to snap at him.Well, you certainly arent a good guy, or you wouldnt have slept with a woman who could barely walk a straight line.His handsome face twisted into a glare.Had she struck a nerve?I wouldnt be casting stones, princess.I heard all about your sins the minute I hit town.Furiously, she threw the boxes down the stairs outside and reached back for the knob.I guess you know what Im capable of, then.Slamming the door, she cursed all the way down the steps, her breath fogging in front of her as it hit the cold air.She saw frost coating the metal handrail and realized she was wearing only a thin long sleeved shirt, pajama bottoms, and house slippers.She was too pissed off to go back and put on a sweatshirt, though.Picking up the boxes at the bottom of the stairs, she walked down the alley toward the Dumpster.Gabe didnt know her or what she had been through.He had no right to judge her.You mean, the way you judge him?Grumbling, she opened the Dumpster and had just dropped the first box inside when she heard a faint cry coming from within.She froze and heard it again.Heart pounding, her first thought was that it sounded like a baby.Someone had thrown a baby away.No, thats not right.Babies dont mewl like that.It has to be an animal, right?Caroline wasnt much of an animal person, but the thought of someone taking something helpless and throwing it out like garbage infuriated her.Looking around for something to stand on, she saw a stack of pallets behind the Local Bean Coffee Shop.It took her a few minutes to drag them over, but once they were stacked five high, she stood on top and looked over the Dumpsters edge.It was pretty full, and reaching out, she moved the box shed just thrown on top of the pile.At that moment, she saw a black plastic garbage bag move.What if its a rat?What if its not?she said aloud and climbed inside, crawling across the top until she reached the moving bag.Gripping it with both hands, she ripped it open wide and looked inside.A lump formed in her throat as she stared at the tiny fuzzy bodies.A litter of kittens.She picked up one with fur the color of butter, but its body was cold.What the hell are you doing?Caroline looked up to find Gabe standing in front of the Dumpster, his expression blank.Someone just threw them away, she said, her voice sounding hollow as she picked up the next kitten.And then the next.But shed heard a cry.One of them must be alive.To her surprise, Gabe took a few steps closer.Here, hand them to me, he said, holding his hand over the side.She didnt argue.Handing him the yellow kitten, she saw him grimace before he set it down outside the Dumpster.He held out his hand again and one by one, she handed him the cool, lifeless bodies.When she reached the last two, a fluffy gray tabby and a short haired, cream colored kitten, she noticed that they were warmer than the others but still motionless.And then the cream one moved and meowed.Oh!she cried, a wet laugh escaping.She hadnt even realized she was crying.This ones moving.What about the other one?Gabe asked.Her smile disappeared.Its warm still, but not moving.Here, he said, and she placed the kitten in his outstretched hand.To her surprise, he started rubbing the kitten gently.What are you doing?I worked at an animal shelter once and saw the vet do this to a puppy that had stopped breathing.Did it work?she asked, hope constricting her chest as she held the squirming cream kitten close.No, he said, before placing his mouth over the kittens tiny mouth and nose and breathing into its body.He pulled back and began rubbing it vigorously all over, turning it over and over in his hands.Ive got him, Gabe said, his handsome face shining as the kitten cried weakly and squirmed in his hands.Caroline watched him cradle the small cat, amazed by his gentleness.You saved him.Gabe glanced up from the kitten, and their gazes locked.Electricity crackled around them, and suddenly, she had the urge to crawl across the garbage and kiss those full lips.Just to thank him.Hey, what are you doing in there?The connection was broken by a womans voice, and Caroline turned to see Gracie McAllister, the jealous woman from last night, racing toward them from the back of the Local Bean.Caroline cleared her throat.Someone dumped a litter of kittens into the trash.Oh my God!Bastards!Gracie looked at both of them and then down toward the ground in obvious horror.Caroline wondered if Gabe had just set the other kittens on the ground and that was what Gracie was seeing.Here, Ill take him while you climb out, Gracie said, finally, holding her hands up to Caroline.For some reason, Caroline was reluctant to release the kitten.He had called out to her, after all, but in the end, she wanted to get out of the Dumpster.Handing Gracie the little kitten, she crawled out with the help of Gabes other hand under her elbow.As soon as her feet were back on the ground, she took the creamy furball back from Gracie, her heart melting a little as he nuzzled her neck.The veterinarian is down the street, but shes probably not in yet, Gracie said as she pulled out her cell phone.Luckily, I have her cell number.Ill let her know youre coming down.Thanks, Gracie, Caroline said.Gracie shook her head and hugged her before Caroline could react.You are my new hero, Caroline Willis.There are not many women who would climb into a Dumpsterfor any reason.Caroline had never been called a hero in her life and had no idea what to say as Gracie released her to make the call.With Gracie just a few steps away, Caroline didnt want to say anything to Gabe that Gracie might hear, but damn it, the man had gone from being a total asshole to the type of guy who gave mouth to mouth to a kitten.It was unacceptable.That action alone said he had some redeeming qualities, and she didnt want to think about him like that.From their first meeting, shed put him down as self centered and bad tempered, but hed followed her outside for some reason.To explain about Kirsten maybe?Had she jumped to the wrong conclusion?Maybe shed been too drunk to drive, and hed just taken care of her.Was she reading too much into his actions?Shed tried too many times to see the good in people that just wasnt there and learned the hard way that men would screw you and disappoint you every time.It made forming attachments almost impossible, waiting for the other shoe to drop.Okay, shes on her way to the office and will meet you there, Gracie said, stepping close enough to stroke the top of the cream colored kittens head.When she spoke again, she was talking to the kitten in a high pitched baby voice.Im sorry people are assholes, but youre going to be in good hands.Caroline glanced over at Gabe, whose expression warred between amused and how fast can I get out of here.Caroline understood what he was feeling as Gracie took her hand and squeezed it.You come in for coffee anytime you want.Its on the house.Before she could argue, someone opened the back door to the coffee shop and yelled Gracies name.As she hurried away, Caroline and Gabe stood alone.Clearing her throat, Caroline said, Youre the one who should be getting free coffee.I didnt do anything but get a little dirty.I didnt do anything.Hell, I didnt even think that shit would work, he said sharply.Still, it did, so really Look, princess, I like animals and all that, but dont go thinking Im a hero because I got lucky.Im no fucking hero.Caroline was taken aback at first, but then her temper flared to life.Of course youre not.But for a minute there, I thought you might at least be a human being.He didnt say anything right away, and it burned her that shed actually felt warm fuzzies toward him.He held the kitten in one hand and a box in the other.Since the other kittens werent on the ground, she assumed they were in the box, and she held out her hand.Why dont you give me your kitten and the box.I can make it down the street on my own.Not without dropping a kitten.Theyre squirmy, Gabe said, confusing her further.Shed given him the perfect out, and he wasnt taking it.Throwing up her free hand, she snapped, Fine.Whatever.Lets go.But as she started down the alley, her little kitten began to nuzzle and knead her neck, its tiny body vibrating with a clicking purr, effectively melting Carolines heart and diffusing her anger.Hes not worth your anger or your energy.Which killed her, because for just a moment, shed thought he might be.GABE, WHY THE fuck do you have to be such an asshole?Gabe couldnt answer the question.It was true hed seen the vet use mouth to mouth on the puppy at the shelter, but the rubbing trick hed remembered from watching 101 Dalmatians, Honeys favorite movie.Now, all he could think about was the time Honey had brought home a very pregnant stray dog when they were kids.Their mother had bitched that they didnt need another mouth to feed, but shed let them keep the dog anyway.When the mutt gave birth, one of the puppies hadnt been moving.Honey started crying and praying, but hed grabbed a towel from the bathroom and started rubbing.Gabe had told Caroline that it hadnt worked because he didnt want to get her hopes up, but it had worked.The little puppy had started moving and squirming, and Honey had thrown her arms around him.Youre my hero, Gabe.Hearing the same words from Caroline had sent panic bubbling up his throat.He wasnt a good guy or a hero.If she started thinking he was anything but an arrogant dickhead, he would only disappoint her.Even at his best, there was too much bad surrounding him to combat the good.It haunted him constantly; if Honey hadnt sustained brain damage, would she remember the accident?Would she blame him?Hate him?He could only imagine, and the scenes that played out in his mind were never ones of forgiveness.Which was why allowing Caroline to get close to him would be a mistake.Despite the rocky start between them, he liked Carolines spunk.But he didnt want to feel anything for her, especially when it would only lead to hurt later on.What could he offer any woman but a broken man with a checkered past?But when hed come down the stairs and found her in the Dumpster, shed looked so sad and vulnerable, hed wanted to help her.Protect her.And now, the best way to do that was to keep her from getting too close.I think this is probably her, Caroline said, breaking into his thoughts when they arrived at the vets office just as a large truck pulled up in front.I can take the kitten if you want to go.Im good.He rubbed his thumb across the fuzzy little babys back and almost smiled when it arched and mewled.You must be Gabe and Caroline, said the young black haired woman who jumped out of the lifted diesel truck.Im Zoe Carver.Zoe was tall and leggy, and as she passed them to open the office, Gabe noticed she walked with a small limp.She pushed open the door and turned to him with a sad smile on her face.Ill take the box, if youd like.Gabe handed her the box of dead kittens and let Caroline go ahead of him as they followed Zoe through the lobby and into a small exam room.As Zoe clucked and tsked over the box, Gabe glanced toward Caroline and saw she was fighting to control her expression.It surprised him; he hadnt pegged her for the type to cry over anything.Ever.Most likely, they died from hypothermia or suffocation.Gracie said you found them in a Dumpster?Zoe asked.She didnt give them the opportunity to answer before she continued.Some people just suck.Zoe came around the exam table and held her hands open.Why dont you hand over your little darling, and Ill examine him or her.Gabe released the kitten to her and balked when she said, You two should get medals for heroism.I didnt do anything, he said quickly.It was all her.I just held the box.He avoided Carolines gaze but could feel it boring into him.The intense stare finally pulled his gaze up to meet hers, and he saw the confusion.The disappointment.If she knew the truth, shed understand.The air around him became hot and stifling as he imagined telling Caroline everything he had done.The disgust and resentment it would cause.People who found out about his DUI assumed he was an alcoholic, that he just couldnt help himself.But he hadnt been drunk or high since that night.He could have a beer or drink, but never more than one if he was out.Still, people didnt want to hear that.They just assumed the worst and wrote him off.Which was probably why hed never gone back to his hometown, except to bury his mother.The Welcome Wagon definitely hadnt been waiting for him.No, he wasnt brave or a hero.Caroline was the brave one, coming back here and facing her past.All he could do was try to make up for his.When Zoe tried to hand the kitten back to him, he backed away, glancing toward the door, toward escape.If youve got this under control, Ive got things to do.He hadnt meant to sound so sharp, but he was still surprised when Caroline said, Then go.See you at home, princess.As he left the room, he heard Zoe ask, Are you together?No, just roommates.Thankfully, Caroline replied.He gritted his teeth, irritation flashing through him.What do you expect?Instead of trying to keep a casual, comfortable living arrangement with the woman, you barge in on her showers, fight with her at every turn, and cant stop thinking about what she looks like naked.After exiting the vets office, Gabe jogged back to the apartment, hoping to blow of some steam, but it just left him more keyed up.A cold shower didnt help either, and by the time he climbed down the stairs to his bike, he wished for a pair of gloves and a sparring partner to unleash his demons on.After he found the perfect spot for his shop, he was going to have to look for a boxing gym or something close to it.Living with Caroline wasnt going to be easy, especially when he kept pissing her off at every turn.In fact, this morning shed seemed downright hostile about finding Kirsten in their apartment, but what was he supposed to do?Hed brought Kirsten back to have some fun, but when hed had to help her up the stairs, hed realized exactly how drunk she was.Hed tried making them coffee in the hopes of sobering her up, but shed lain down on the living room floor after Caroline went to bed and wouldnt get up.So, hed done the right thing and picked her up, carrying her back to his bedroom.He wasnt going to kick a woman out in the middle of the night, especially one who could barely stand, so hed put her to bed and spent the rest of the night trying to sleep on top of the covers while the tiny blonde had snored like a trucker.He would have probably headed back to bed after seeing her out this morning if he hadnt bumped into Caroline.But after she stormed out, hed followed her, intending to apologize and explain, only to find her crying in a Dumpster.The sight had left him nearly breathless.It had been the first time in his life hed ever wanted to pull a woman other than his sister into his arms and comfort her.He had wanted to see her smile, her beautiful eyes twinkling ...Pulling the bike to a stop in front of the Realtors office, Gabe cursed the crazy turn his mind had taken.Since when did he get poetic about women?Maybe hed try to find a shop with an apartment above or in the back.It was obvious he had made a mistake, trying to be a good guy.It just wasnt in his nature.He liked things his way, and he didnt want to answer to any woman.Especially not a sharp tongued beauty who only seemed to add to the regrets he carried.Twelve As Cher once sang, Its in his kiss.The first kiss can tell you whether theres a spark or the relationships doomed.Either way, the first kiss is my favorite.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE TOOK A deep breath as she knocked on her fathers door and waited for Teresa to answer.She looked up and down the street, but there was no sign of Kyles car this time, thank God.It had been four days since her encounter with him, and she still hadnt gotten up the nerve to swing by and see her father.Finally, shed called this morning and asked Teresa if her father was expecting company today.Teresa had said no, and Caroline had begged her not to say anything to her dad; shed wanted to surprise him.Though it would probably seem more like an ambush to him.Still, if she was going to help bygones be bygones, she needed to get her dad alone.Even alone, he was a bastard, but with an audience, he was completely unreasonable.It shouldnt be this hard to put this one disagreement in the past, especially when shed done so well for herself, but she still expected him to drag it out, if only for the theatrics.Her father, the drama king.Must be where his youngest daughter got it from.In fact, Val had called Caroline in the middle of the night, asking if Ellie was with her.While they were on the phone, Ellie had come home, and Val had hung up, yelling, blowing out Carolines eardrum.Whatever was going on with Ellie was going to come to a boiling point, and Caroline had a feeling it was going to be bad.But as shed told Val, Ellie was an adult.She had to make her own mistakes and learn from them.She heard a slight mewl and looked down at the animal carrier shed bought in Twin Falls after leaving the vets.Shed picked up this little carriera black tote with breathable mesh sidesalong with bottles, formula, and some fleece material for the kittens to cuddle into, figuring it would be easy to wash.Zoe had offered to find them a foster home, and Caroline had almost agreed ...until her little cream colored buddy had curled up against her neck and fallen asleep.She couldnt give up himor his brotherafter that.Zoe had given her instructions, and they were lengthy.At first, the little babies would want to eat almost every one to two hours, but eventually, she would be able to get them onto some kind of feeding schedule.Until then, it was best to treat them like newborns.True to what Zoe had said, the little vermin had already devoured three bottles of formula today.Teresa pulled the door open, her dark eyes widening before she shrieked.Ah, nia, you are home.The short round woman grabbed Carolines arm and pulled her inside, squeezing her so tightly that Caroline could hardly breathe.Wrapping her arms around Teresas shoulders in return, she realized Teresa was crying.Dont cry, Resa, Im okay, Caroline murmured, awed by the womans emotions.Teresa had been with them since Caroline was five, and she had always felt more like an aunt than their housekeeper.After her mothers death, she had even snuck out to Teresas home to cry on the older womans lap while shed stroked her hair.But now, to her shock, Teresa pulled away and smacked her arm.You.Not a word in twelve years.If it wasnt for Valerie, Id have thought you were dead in a ditch!Caroline bit her lip to keep from laughing.Teresas accent always thickened when she was angry.She could still remember Teresa shouting at them when theyd eaten half the cake Teresa had made their parents as an anniversary gift.Shed chased them out of the kitchen, slipping into rapid Spanish, and made them scrub the kitchen and take another bath before their parents returned.I called you.Only after I told Valerie that I would hunt you down!Teresa reached out and cupped Carolines cheek, shaking her head.You have grown more beautiful than when you left us.Covering the older womans hand with her own, Caroline took a breath and blinked.She didnt want to cry before she saw the old man.Thank you.Teresa pulled away first, wiping at her eyes and huffing, Well, you stayed away far too long.Im sure your father will be happy to see you.Ha.Not if his reaction at the hospital was any indication.Caroline followed Teresa to her fathers bedroom and waited behind her as she knocked on the door.Mr.Willis, there is someone here to see you.If its Kyle with the new figures, tell him Caroline stepped around Teresa and pushed the door open.Hi, Daddy.Edward Willis looked up from a pile of papers on his lap, and although he appeared stronger than he had in the hospital, seeing her once imposing father sitting in bed in the middle of the afternoon was still hard to get used to.He had aged twenty years, in Carolines opinion.His once dark, silver flecked hair was nearly white.His reading glassed perched on his nose, and the hard eyes gazing out at her were surrounded by more wrinkles than she remembered.Even his skin looked weathered, although he was still a handsome man.He was like Clint Eastwood; immortal even as he aged, his presence was still strong.Caroline tried to remember the few times in her childhood when hed been caring or affectionatehell, even just proud of herbut they were hard to come by.She felt like those memories belonged to someone else.This wasnt her home, and this wasnt the man whod raised her.They were just strangers who shared the same blood.Things could have been so different if he had just tried.Opened up and listened to them.Acted like a father, you mean?But the past was the past, and she couldnt change it.She could only try to move forward.No matter how terrifying it was.I thought I made myself quite clear that you were no longer welcome here.Caroline heard Teresa suck in a breath behind her, but she refused to be rattled.I thought maybe we could bury the hatchetpreferably not in each others backs.Edward watched her, his face flushed as he reached for something from his nightstand.How much?How much what?Caroline asked, knowing full well he was talking about money but wanting him to say it aloud.How much money do you need?Edward asked, enunciating each word with a sneer.Caroline wanted to wipe that condescending look off his face.Pulling out her scratched cell phone, she opened her bank account app and walked around the bed until she could hold out the screen to him.As you can see, Daddy, Im doing okay for myself.I am here strictly on a personal level.Edward looked positively ill as he stared at her online bank statement.Dont smile.You are an adult who made good and do not need to rub it in his face like a child.Dont smile.She grinned.Arent you proud?God, why do you have to revert to an angry, snotty teenager?If you dont want money, then there is nothing for you here, he snarled.So, let me get this straight, she said, slipping her phone back into her pocket.You dont want me around, but if I did need money, you would be okay with that?Anything to keep an embarrassment like you away from me, he said.Her eyes stung as if hed slapped her, but she choked back her tears on a harsh laugh.You are such a dick.Teresa gasped behind her, as Edward shouted, Get out of my house, you little whore!During her time as a bartender and owner, Caroline had learned to master her temper, to speak calmly and rationally when dealing with unreasonable and sometimes drunk people.But all it took was being back in her fathers presence to cause her temper to burn out of control.I am not a whore.Please, do you think I havent heard about your escapades?I chose to ignore them as long as you continued to excel in your studies and didnt cause undue embarrassment, but I knew everything you did.Really, Caroline said, her voice shaking.So you know about how Kyle Jenner drugged and raped me at his familys house party when I was fifteen?About how he threatened to hurt Ellie and Val if I said anything?Sucking in air, a heavy weight lifted as she spoke, Tell me, Daddy, if you know everything about me, then how could you hire the one man who destroyed my chance at a normal life?Unsurprisingly, her fathers face flushed purple with temper, and he shouted, Youre lying!Kyle is a strong, upstanding Upstanding?You mean wealthy and connected!Caroline hollered back, her vision blurring despite her attempt to blink back angry tears.I know Val told you about her friend in college.Kyles other victim.You know that Kyles father would do anything to protect his reputation and his son.If you think Senator Jenner is blind to his sons faults, look again.I guarantee that youll find a few skeletons in his closet.Dashing at her eyes, she added, Why would I lie about this now?Its been fifteen years since that night, so why would I bring it up now if it never happened?Caroline didnt give him a chance to answer before she continued.The only reason Ive kept quiet was because he said hed hurt Val and Ellie exactly how he hurt me, only he wouldnt drug them.That is the man you hired and treat better than your own children.You let a monster into this house.As he spoke, the blood drained from his face.If you think I would have allowed anyone to hurt you or your sisters this way, you are gravely mistaken.I would have handled things.I would have ...He seemed to be collecting himself.I would have protected you.He believed her.It was almost unbelievable, considering the several hundred scenarios of this moment that shed played in her mind over the years; in only a few had he actually believed her.She didnt know what to do with this.For years shed held onto this secret, assuming that her father wouldnt believe her unless Kyle followed through with his threata risk she was never willing to take.In fact, he was looking at her with more emotion than shed ever seen from him, even at her mothers funeral.Anger was there but so was regret.Did he regret not knowing?That shed never told him?Suddenly, it was too much.Without waiting for him to say more, to voice his thoughts, Caroline spun around and pushed past Teresa, muttering an apology as she rushed out of the house.She heard mewls of protest as the kittens bumped against her hip, and she slowed down, brushing her hair out of her already bleary vision.She couldnt see well enough to get her key in the lock, and cursing, she kicked the side of her car.Caroline?Are you okay?Caroline turned to find that the DJ, Callie Jacobsen, had pulled up alongside her.Callie was watching her with concern from the window of her SUV, her golden riot of curls pulled back from her face.Caroline opened her mouth to answer but stopped when a monster dog in the back of Callies car jumped into the passenger seat.Killer!Ratchet, dang it!Get down!If Caroline hadnt been on the verge of breaking down, she might have laughed.Killer Ratchet?What kind of name is that?Callie grinned sheepishly.His real name is Ratchet, but everyone in town thinks its Killer.Its started off as a joke, but youd be surprised at how many people back away from a dog named Killer, as opposed to Ratchet.A surprised smile came over Caroline.Is that to weed out the undesirables?Something like that, Callie said, scratching the giant dog behind his ears.Im not much of a people person.Funny.Me either, Caroline said.So, did you need some help?I thought maybe your car door was stuck or something.No, its fine.Im just shaken up.Well, okay then, if youre sure.Callies SUV started to pull forward just as Caroline called out, Hey, Callie?Yeah?In case you hadnt noticed, Im kind of a social pariah around here, but right now, I could really use some company.Do you maybe want to come over and hang out?Callie hesitated, and Caroline almost opened her mouth to let her off the hook, but then Callie nodded.Sure, that would be great.Ill follow you.Is it okay if Ratchet comes?A mewling reminded her that the kittens were hungry, and she said, As long as he doesnt try to eat cats or me, were good.I THINK ITS a great space, man, and for the size, its the best deal.Gabe nodded, considering Chases opinion.He had to admit that he was happiest with the old firehouse too, especially since the rent had just been reduced.It was located at the end of Main Street, far from most other businesses, except for the tire shop next door, but that might work in his favor anyway.It was always a good business tactic to create partnerships with the places around you, especially if you wanted to pave a larger parking lot, so to speak.As they made their way back to Chases Blazer, Gabe said, Yeah, youre right.Hey, thanks for looking at it with me.He had been surprised that Chase had agreed to go with him.No problem, Chase said, heading around to the drivers side.Im actually a little jealous.Hows that?Gabe asked.Well, I think, considering price per square foot, you got a better deal than me.Gabe laughed as he climbed inside, leaning back in the seat.Sorry about that.As he started the car, Chase said, Eh, its okay.I get better foot traffic in the main stretch of town anyway.Silence stretched in the car once the radio came on, and Gabe buckled in.Hows Honey doing?Chases question had been a long time coming, but it still knocked the breath out of him.Gabe swallowed down the knot of guilt and unease that had gathered in his throat and said, Shes doing good.Shes started painting again, mostly landscapes.Shes got a great view from her room.Thats great.The tension in the car thickened.Gabe was glad that Chase had finally brought up Honey, but now it felt like theyd lost what little ground theyd managed to cover over the last few days.Desperate to get back to that place, Gabe asked, So whats Katie up to?Katies working.Thats the only thing that sucks about our schedules; she works from ten until six, and I head in to open around five in the evening and dont get home until shes already asleep.But you guys seem happy, so it cant be that bad, Gabe offered, catching his friends sly grin.You know, I never pictured this as my life, living in a small town.Hell, even marriage was way off the menu.But when its right, you just cant help it.Gabe was glad that Chase was happy, if a little whipped.Then again, had his own life gone differently, he might have gone down the same road.With his past, though, he couldnt imagine a woman like Katie giving him a second glance.But Katies blue eyes and sweet smile arent who youd want anyway.You prefer dark beauties with smart ass mouths and killer curves.He almost snorted out loud.Caroline was definitely not a good girl.She was fire and steel and sex in a pair of painted on jeans and What the hell are you thinking so hard about?Chase asked, breaking into Gabes lust filled thoughts.Damn, what was it about her that could turn him into a daydreaming fool?Sorry.I was trying to picture myself in your shoes, and I just cant.Youre only thirty four, dude, Chase said.You still have time.Gabe didnt say anything.What was the point?As if reading his mind, Chase said, I used to think that I didnt deserve Katie and almost lost her because of it.The only person who can really make you feel less than worthy is you.And whered you pick up that bit of wisdom?Gabe said, sarcasm dripping from every word.Not many women jump with joy when they find out Im an ex con who builds motorcycles for a living.
