    At 5 oclock, Samson Oceanfront Park receives a visit from three women donning cover up dresses.They journey by way of the Belmont Hotel on Collins Avenue, each carrying something for their evening of frivolity.The two traveling ahead heave a red cooler.Mary, the taller of the two, is a brunette with long hair.Jill sports short blond hair to match her stature though she outdistances her friend in girth and chest size.Barbara, the straggler and redhead of the group, brings up the rear pushing a dolly containing three chairs.They trudge to the back and cross a wooden bridge leading out onto the sand of Sunny Isles Beach.Each gives a shiver of excitement as their Florida sun embraces them tighter than a new lover.A smile spreads across each face as they move slower across the warm sand and make their way to their destination: a small tent Albert, a hotel employee, constructed for them.Jill, knowing he crushes on Barbara, feels a brief pain of regret over her manipulation after she sees the lengths he has gone to.She will have to make good on her promise to unite them though she detests her redheaded frenemy.Mary and Jill enter the tent; each pulls items from their pockets.Jilly, what did you bring to drink?Tell me you brought the Merlot and not that god awful Schnapps.You know I hate drinking that stuff.Mary gives a stern look to her friend.Jill mashes her face and rolls her eyes.You will drink anything put under your happy little nose and you know it.She huffs then adds to please her friend, no, Mare, I didnt bring the Schnapps.She pulls a bottle of Paumanok Vintage Merlot from the cooler.Not bad, says Barbara, standing in the doorway of the tent.Where did you get that?Well, Miss Backboard, says Jill with a coy smile, I have skills that you havent seen yet.Dont worry, Miss Boulderdash, I can see your skills from here.And by the way, your skills only work half the time, given your track record.A broad grin spreads across Barbaras face.She bats her eyes with the innocence of youth at her nemesis.All right you two; were here to unwind from a long day.Youve got the whole Atlantic to work off your stress.Mary winks as she passes Barbara.Barbara smiles and follows Mary.Jill clenches her fists.Mary belongs to her, not the slut queen.She dare not leave them alone so she skulks behind with a tight smile to assist unfolding the chairs.The three women sit outside their tent drinking Merlot from plastic cups with the hotels logo on them.This beach has an odor of seaweed much stronger than other beaches they love like Hollywood.But here, the waves are smaller.You can swim out to buoys that are far out in the Atlantic Ocean.After a few drinks the smell floats off with their cares as the sun warms their skin.Mary, did you pack sandwiches?asks Barbara who wants something in her stomach besides the wine.No, Barb.I forgot.Im sorry, I always forget about eating.Next time remind me, will you?Marys face fell with Barbaras.Jill stands and removes her dress.Beneath, she wears a sexy red two piece bathing suit.Come on, Mare.Lets go for a swim before we drink too much.Mary stares at Jills huge breasts straining against the tiny shoelace she calls a top.Girl, if you get in the water like that, I know those boulders are going to fly every which way but loose.Mary laughs, giving Barbara freedom to burst.Fuck both you bitches.Im hot to trot and loving it.She turns and sashays to the water.Jilly, Im sorry.Wait, Jilly.Im coming.Mary flingss her cover up over her head and races to catch her friend.Marys conservative dark blue one piece suit is similar to what swimmers wear at their swim meets.She catches up to Jill.Together, they enter the water.Barbara sips her drink watching the women swim.Instead of swimming out to the buoys, they swim parallel to the shoreline.They swim fifty yards, stand, then swim back in the opposite direction.After two laps they return to dry off and down more liquor.How was the water?asks Barbara.Comfortable, says Jill.You should have joined us.The smile that doesnt quite reach her eyes says she doesnt mean it.Maybe next time, says Barbara.She finishes her drink and pours another.The women drink, people watch, and discuss their workday.As the sun sets, they finish their bottle of Merlot and start in on the wine coolers Barbara liberated from the hotels restaurant; the bartender is a playmate of hers.After downing the wine coolers, Marys face breaks into a wide grin.Lets go to Ladies Night tonight and rack up on the freebies.Yeah, says Barbara, Im down for that.They dont allow hooker dresses, Barb.I guess you will have to stay home tonight.Alcohol loosens Jills already freed tongue.Barbaras face contorts then brightens a rosy red.I guess half your friends wont be able to make it, will they?Quiet you two, lets go party!Mary begins packing so they can enjoy the rest of the night.# # #      Robert Austin Tyler wears a black three piece suit.He stands on a balcony above the New York Stock Exchange.He looks down at the floor of the exchange watching people run around like mice in a maze chasing cheese.He scans the chaos trying to find his broker.Robert Tyler grew up in the projects, dirt poor.Standing six feet tall and thin, it is easy to assume he has and uses his gym membership.Robert checks his watch then scans the crowd for his broker, Jerry Carpenter.His heartbeat slows as he fastens on to a man behind a desk eyeing a computer screen.Jerry Carpenter wears a white shirt with a blue tie and black slacks.He runs a hand through short, sandy hair.Jerry, stands two inches shy of six feet.He studied accounting and business management, determined to be a young tycoon by 30.Jerry looks up from his computer screen to see Robert staring down at him.Jerry takes out his cell phone.Hey, whats up?You look worried?Theres only one hour left, says Robert.I need to wait a few more minutes.Trust me.Trust you?Thats my money youre gambling.Rob, man, I got this.Im watching the numbers and theyre almost there.Dont forget why you hired me.This is my brilliant system, it hasnt failed us yet.All right, Jerr, I am counting on you.Robert continues to stalk the rail watching Jerry.If this fails, many investment projects will go south in a heartbeat.Jerry gives a thumbs up to a stone wall.Robert slides his damp hands against his suit before checking his watch for the millionth time, then paces the small area.After a few more minutes, he sees Jerry put on a red jacket and grab a plaque with a set of numbers on it heading toward the pit.Jerry maneuvers past shouting brokers to the ticker board.He holds up his number and yells, Buy, Buy, Buy.A frenzy erupts with plaques and hands waving frantically.Jerry gets out of the pit and races back to his computer to tally his haul.He leaps from his chair, Yes!He picks up the phone, one and half million profit my friend, Yee Haw!Fantastic!I never doubted you for an instant, says Robert.Tonight the drinks are on me, partner.Give me half an hour to wrap up.Ill be at Billys, says Robert.Youre a genius, buddy.Thanks for the compliment, kind sir, Jerry stands and mockingly bows toward Robert, I aim to please.See you in a few.Robert walks to the elevator and out of the building.He flags a taxi to the airport.He orders a whiskey sour at Billys Watering Hole before sitting to eat stale pretzels.Jerry arrives an hour later.Hey, order me one too; I got to go take a leak.He returns to gulp his drink in one swallow.Ahh that hit the spot.What time is our flight?Robert reaches into his vest pocket and hands Jerry a ticket.Forty five minutes, you ready?Damn, you didnt waste any time did you?Im anxious to get out of here.They climb to their feet to sit among jabbering passengers in uncomfortable chairs.Taking out fees and taxes, we cleared $1.1 million and change.If we come back in 10 days then another 10 days we can clear more than $3 million in 1 month.I told all those assholes my plan would work, but no, none of those pricks would fund me and take the chance.You know what?I think I will write a book.How is this for a title, How to Shaft Wall Street in 30 Days or Less?Jerry laughs as they rise to approach the counter for check in.All right, Mr.Stock Exchange; lets not get too big of a head.You never know when somebody might decide to use it as a punching bag.We will wait 20 days and then go back with double the money.Yes!Jerry shouts into the crowd of people.Now you are talking my language.Which account did you wire the money into?Robert asks.First National, like you told me this morning, before the exchange opened.I still think the Cayman Islands would have been better.They board the first class section of the plane, order champagne, and enjoy their flight back home to Miami, Florida.2: Lioness      Mary decides to go to the Heinekens nightclub and enjoy ladies night with her girls.Mary is five feet eight inches tall and thin as a rail.She always jokes with her girls that the biggest part of her body is her D cups.She hates them and wears clothing to hide their true might.Tonight she wears straight legged blue jeans pants and an oversized blue t shirt she ties in a knot at her waist.She rounds out her outfit with four inch turquoise heels.Mary sits at a table with Jill and Barbara.The music coming from the live band rattles their small table.Oh god, I will be so glad when they get off the stage.Mary says, grasping her drink threatening to spill over the table.Yeah, they are just awful, echoes Jill.Look at how bad this poor little table is shaking, poor baby, good thing you dont have eardrums.The drunken girl slurs her speech as she rubs the table.Aw, there there wuttle baby, Barbara jokingly says as she strokes the table to calm it further.Barbara laughs with them then turns a drunken eye to the server.Hey, you, I need another drank over here.Youve had enough to drink, says Mary.Why dont you get on the dance floor and shake some of that alcohol out of your fat ass.Barbara flicks her long red hair at Mary and pushes from the table.You are just jealous that you cant shake like this.Barbara turns and bends.She puts her hands on the floor, lifts her load high in the air and shakes and jiggles for all shes worth.Jill casts a hand to her eyes as if blinded.Oh, Lord Jesus!Stop, girl, stop.You moon me one more time and I swear I am going to kick your potholed ass out of here.Jill and Mary laugh, but Barbara doesnt care, she stands and continues to shimmy in front of them.Two protrusions appear in Barbaras extra tight white Playboy top.Her homemade blue jean cutoffs sport big diamond shaped slits cut out in the back to reveal her large backside.With the small shorts, her cheeks shine through whether she stands are moves.With her jiggling about, everything is in motion and it is only a matter of time before something flies from its orbit.With further protests, Barbara Limbaugh stops gyrating and turns to face them.Jilly Jill is a Jealous Pill.I guess I will go and find myself a real Dill.She shows her middle finger to Jill.Mary watches Barbara stagger to the dance floor and with a short shake, the universe is once again in motion.Moments later, a white man with short, spiky, black hair and a tee dyed T shirt falls into her captivating orbit.Mary turns to Jill, well, I guess theres someone for everyone, but do you really want someone like that?Oh, Mary, girl you are being a prude again.Take off their clothes, turn out the lights, and they are all the same.Just pray that he can work it, girl.Jillian Thomas is five feet five inches tall with short blond hair.She believes because she is the largest of her group of friends that she is indeed fat.Reinforced from her school days, when the school kids would always call her the big one.People have always let her down and like Mary, she counts on no one and has faith in no one.Mary decides to change the subject, How is Bert doing?He hasnt brought up marriage again if thats what youre wondering.Its been a year.Maybe you should bring it up.No.He loves me and I will wait for him to bring it up again.I still have the ring, thats enough for now.Jill twists the ring on her finger.The girls met at Marys first job interview at Dennys.The two young women ended up working the night shift together.Six months later, they were sharing their first apartment.Neither knew anything about being on their own, so it did not last long.They fought over money and chores, believing that if they were out of their parents homes, they would not have those responsibilities.Wrong!After returning home for six months they decided to forgive each other and try it again.That time it lasted for four years.A distant smile crosses Jills lips then fades.Knowing Mary left to give them more privacy, she cannot afford to have Bert Harper mad at her.Why do you think he hasnt gone further?He knows my past, says Jill.He knows I have been with girls so it cant be that.She absently rubs her girth.I guess I will just wait a little while longer and see.Mary looks back over at Barbara dancing.Lets do something useful and protect that idiot.Not me, Im going to sit here and drink and wallow in self pity.You go ahead and have fun, Miss Save a hoe.Mary ventures to the dance floor.She starts dancing with Barbarato pull her away from the groping, spike haired freak.Barbara shoves her to the side and continues to dance with the man.Barbaras face lights when a slow song plays.Barbaras body type is medium and she is two years older than her friends and an inch taller than Jill.She ignores Mary and anyone else who cares to watch her grind on her latest conquest.Mary sighs; she returns to the table and orders another drink.She is on her own tonight, lets get drunk.All right, thunders Jill.Mary drinks, but still keeps an eye on Barbara.Her heart catches when the man lowers his hands from Barbaras waist to her firmness.The man squeezes and Barbara giggles with excitement.Mary watches, but she and Jill keep drinking.Tonight is the night for swaying in your seat and knocking back drinks.Jill watches the amorous couple as Mary gets up to go to the bathroom.Dont worry I got my good eye on those bitches.Go take a dump or piss or whatever the fuck you got to do, girl.I got this shit here.Jills Montgomery accent returns as she slurs her words.Mary hates to hear it coming back, it is always an indication of Jills drunkenness.Dont get your drunk ass up; Ill be back in five.Mary goes to the bathroom.When she makes it back out to her seat, pure shock slaps her in the face.What the fuck?Jill leans back in her chair with her mouth wide open.Has she passed out?She wears a matching red blouse and skirt.The red blouse is open.A grubby looking man massages and suckles her left breast.Jill strokes the mans head and Mary can hear her saying, good boy.Jill moans.Mary shakes her head in disgust and under her breath says, you drunk ass bitch, let me go find Barbara.I will deal with your ass later.Mary stomps off in search of Barbara and the spike haired freak of her dreams.She scans the floor and the tables before deciding to check the bathroom.The room is empty, but she hears noises from one of the stalls.Mary drops to her hands and knees and takes a look.She sees two pairs of feet and gets up and rushes to the stall door and opens it.A couple is having sex doggy style in the stall with the mans back to the door.Mary sees his hairy ass first and then his spiked hair and knows she has the right couple.Get the fuck off her, you Motherfucker!The man stops and turns just in time to move as Mary flings her shoe at his head.In a drunken stagger, he shoves past her and stumbles his half naked frame out the door, trying to run and pull his pants up at the same time.Mary lets out an ear piercing scream and chases after the man.Once inside the main room, she picks up glasses from different tables to rifle at the dodging half naked man.Robert and Jerry are upstairs at a booth table near the edge of the second floor.They turn with others to witness the commotion.Mary continues to cuss the man while throwing anything she can get her hands on, including her other shoe.You Motherfucker!How dare you take advantage of my friend?she shrieks in pursuit of vengeance.Jerry, from up above, says, Damn man, that is one crazy ass bitch.Security needs to hurry up and get her ass before she kills that poor bastard.Robert says, Here they come.He starts laughing and pours some more champagne from the bottle.Security stops Mary.They block her so she cant follow the man so he runs out of the club.That bastard was in the ladies bathroom fucking my friend!Look here, lady.You cant just chase somebody throwing sharp objects at them.Did you even bother checking to see if you hurt anybody?Security asks her.What about my fucking friend, do you give a damn about her!Let me go.I have to go see if she is all right.Hold it, ma'am, you are not going anywhere.As soon as we stabilize this place, youre going to jail, says the other security officer.Mary starts moving, trying to pull loose from the men.What the fuck did I do?You need to go after that bastard.Shit!God damn it!Let me go!Mary screams and twists trying to break loose from their tight grip.One security guard turns to the other and says, Hey, Ronnie man, take her to the bathroom.Maybe it will calm her down.I will get everybody together and check on the injured.Robert watches the guard escort Mary to the ladies bathroom.As they pass a table, Mary grabs a bottle and keeps walking.When they near Marys table, she views the grungy fat bastard still pawing at her best friend.As they pass by the table, she wallops the man over the head with the bottle, shattering it.Robert looks at Jerry and both laugh until they cant laugh anymore.The grungy man falls to the floor.The security guard grabs Mary, god damn you crazy ass bitch.You better hope hes not dead!Instead of taking her to the bathroom, he handcuffs her and marches her to the security office.Mary twists and turns the whole way to the office.Let me go you bastard.I have to go check on my friends.Let me go, you fucking bastard!Shut the fuck up.He places her in their holding area and calls the police.The only place you are going is to jail.Shut the fuck up and wait for the police to get here.Mary screams, Ill get you for this!I swear Ill get you.The guard drops the phone.He walks over to her and pulls out his stun gun.He says as calmly as he can, you best try to sleep it off.Give me anymore trouble and Ill make you dance.He waves the stun gun before Marys bulging eyes.Mary wants to argue but the gun cuts her voice short.She sits straighter, calmer, electing to listen to the guards conversation with the police.The man leaves the room, afterward.Before long, the quiet induces a restful sleep.Later in the night the police arrive to claim Mary.The security guards repeat their story then point to the slumped woman.The police shake Mary.Hey, wake up.Marys eyes flutter open.She views them through a haze.She wipes the slobber from her mouth and says, wh what do you want?The officer asks, What is your name, Ma'am?Mary Lake.She wipes her hands in her hair, and pulls back her dark hair so they can see her face.She is not a troublemaker and damn well will prove it.Miss Lake, you are being arrested for drunk and disorderly.As well as  Im in a bar, you know, rowdy bar.Ma'am, you were seen by all the patrons of this establishment throwing glasses and other items at a man that you were chasing.I had good cause; he was attacking my friendraping her.Marys brows rise as blood rushes to fill her face.The two officers look at each other and then at the security guard.The guard shakes his head.Ma'am, no rape has been filed or even reported.We escorted your friends home.We have statements from over 100 people that you are responsible for this entire incident.Please stand up so I can read you your rights.Im not doing anything, leave me alone.The two police officers wrestle her to her feet.One reads her the Miranda rights and they take her out.A handcuffed Mary thrashes in front of the remaining patrons of the club who hoot and holler.She stops resisting, holding her head high in celebration.Later, Mary steps into a large holding cell with fifty other women at a downtown facility.She sits on a bench with three prostitutes.She leans against a dirty wall.Halfway between exhilaration and defeat, sleep takes her.3: Court      The next day guards place a chain between Marys legs and lead her to the courtroom.After unchaining from the others, she sits in a small room off the courtroom.After hearing her name, she trudges to the judges bench dragging the chain between her legs.She stands with a public defender in front of Judge Clark and listens to the charges against her.Not Guilty.The words quiver on her lips.Her attorney blusters, Your honor we have reached a plea deal with the prosecution and my client is ready to change her plea.He hands the judge a piece of paper.The Judge leans forward, raising his spectacles.Young lady, your attorney has offered a plea arrangement, are you in agreement with the terms?Yes, sir.This court does not have to agree with the prosecutions recommendations; given that fact, do you now plead guilty to the charges before you?Yes, sir.Very well.The Judge deliberates for a moment then adds, Young lady I am not impressed with this arrangement.On the night of October 14, you chased a man in a nightclub throwing bottles and glasses at him.I have 31 affidavits from patrons of the establishment listing their damages.I hereby order you to pay each patron $250 in damages.I order you to pay $6,000 in damages to the nightclub.And you will pay court costs and fees of both parties.The judge watches Mary gasp at her punishment.Mary fixes her mouth to speak.Her attorney stares her down to force her silence.He turns to the judge.Your honor my client is destitute.Destitution has no bearing on these proceedings counselor.Your honor if I may?Continue.My client has no way of paying these costs, she is bankrupt.Can your Honor see fit to let her pay off her debts in another fashion, perhaps community service?He nods toward the discarded paper on the bench.The judge eyes Mary.Thanks to the prosecution, I have a report of your previous encounters with the legal system.Miss Lake, you are a menace and must suffer punishment in an effort to correct your behavior.In lieu of the patrons and fees, I order you to 60 days community service beginning today.You will report to city hall and get your assignments from the city clerk.In lieu of payment to the club, I hereby ban you from the club for life.If you go within 500 feet of the establishment I will issue an arrest warrant and reinstate damages.Do not test this courts patience, Miss Lake.That is this courts judgment, case dismissed.The bailiff removes the handcuffs and unchains her feet.You are free to go.Mary turns to see her friends in the back of the courtroom.She rushes forward to give each a hug.Thanks for coming.Im sorry, Mary, it is my fault.Can you forgive me?Barbara asks.Its okay, Barb; did you make it home all right?Yeah, one of the police officers drove me.Barbara runs a hand through her red hair.You seriously need a chill pill sometimes.They laugh.Im sorry, too.Jill adds.No, Im the one who is sorry, says Mary.I could have hurt you with that bottle.Do you forgive me?Well, believe me, I was furious.A delicious grin spreads across Jills face.I was having fun.Jill!Barbaras mouth gapes.Ok, damn girl.Let me talk.Jill says to Barbara.She then turns to Mary, After checking my assets for glassware, I am happy to say no harm, no foul.Yeah, I bet it took a good year or two to check that mass, says Barbara with a wide grin.Jill plants a hand to her hip, tossing her head back, now, who is the Jealous Betty?Last time I was a B cup, I was in diapers.Jill flexes her chest toward her nemesis.Mary laughs, stop it, you two.Lets get out of here before His Highness changes his mind.The three ladies walk out of the courthouse, arm in arm down the street.Barbara asks, Mary, what do you have to do today?I dont know.I am not going to city hall till later.Lets go celebrate.Mary says.Jills face flushes red.Mare, girl, if you dont get your tight ass down there ...you can be arrested.No, I cant, the judge said to go but he didnt say when.So I win, not them.Mary stops to do a little jig.Party time ladies.Down the street, a bar captures her attention.She points.Race you.Loser buys.The women sprint down the street yelling trying to get there first.Barbara makes it in first.Woo Hoo!Losers!She holds a capital L with her fingers to display in front of the girls, loser number one, loser number two.She points at herself and says, Big dog, woof woof.They walk up to the bar.Ill have a Hurricane and these losers will have apple juice.You bitch!Jill heaves her chest.Shut up and pay, loser.Barbara downs her drink.Mary stays silent, Jills shout echoed her sentiment.She drinks her apple juice.After finishing she turns to the happy camper of the group, Now give me a Hurricane, oh Gracious One.Jill takes a sip of hers and spits.She distracts them by pointing to the door then pours the rest out.Hurricanes for everybody!Barbara flexes her shoulders, evil spreads through her being.No way, Hosea!Ill take another Hurricane and these bitches will have lemonade.Barb!Blame that bitch.Drink or die, bitches.Barbara giggles as each holds their noses in defiance and downs their drinks.bout time.Now, Hurricanes for everybody!The women venture to the jukebox, put in some coins and dance with one another.They guzzle a few more drinks, and then ready to leave the bar.Jill and Barbara stagger but Mary has no trouble walking to the door.A flash from the door stops Barbara in the doorway.She turns a bewildered glare to Mary as if getting a revelation.She puffs up.Bitch, if you ever bust in on me screwing in a bathroom stall again, she slurs, I might just kill your skinny ass.Mary chuckles, holding her side.Your dumb ass was having sex without a condom.Shit, bitch, did you see how ugly that fucker was?My god, girl, you could have a disease or worse, be pregnant with a wharf rat.Mary high fives Jill.They burst with laughter.Jill stops laughing as an epiphany hits her.She casts a dark look Marys way.Enough about this skank, what the hell possessed you to bust a bottle over me?Jill puts a hand to her breasts, you could have killed these poor girls.I said Im sorry.Jesus, you were passed out and some grungy bastard was sucking your tits like there was no tomorrow.Hell, I was helping your dumb ass out.Mary gives a nervous chuckle.Barbara erupts with laughter, passing through the doorway.The more they laughed the tighter Jill clenched her fists contemplating her attack.They didnt understand anything.Assholes.She was a natural blond but even more impressive to men were her mountainous 40DDs.She outweighed Barbara by 30 pounds and Mary by a whopping 60.Jill was always heavy set and though she was nowhere near it, while working briefly at an auto factory she received the nickname 290 by her female co workers.Jill clenched and unclenched her fingers, walking outside.I was not passed out.I had my eyes closed pretending he was Bert.Barbara turns, oh my god, how long has it been?Jill draws up.Three months.You and Bert, says Mary, havent had sex in three months, three months, Jilly?So what, its a dry spell.Everyone has them.Jill mutters.Mary stands tall.Not if they live together under the same roof in the same bed.He wont marry you and now he wont even have sex with you?Girl, you have got to get your shit together.Its not that bad, says Jill, heaving her chest.She plants her hands again.At least I have a man, not like the two of you.Im going home to my man.
