Why doesnt he want me?What did he say when you asked him?Nothing because I havent talked to him anymore.Okay, Monica said.Help me understand this.You left with him for lunch, went to his place and tried to get some, and he left you there?Is that why you didnt come back to work?Because he left you without a ride?Ashlee bowed her head in shame.No, he didnt leave me.He went out to the car to wait and I slipped out of the back door and walked home.Monica closed her eyes and slowly shook her head.She stifled a laugh.Girl, you are so extra.Pay attention, sweetie.The man is going crazy trying to reach you.He definitely wants you  I know.Hes been by here twice, but I wont let him in.Im sorry, but I dont know what the big deal is.Youve said over and over again you wanted to wait until youre married to have sex.The man tried to respect your wishes and you got mad at him?I saw how you guys were the day he picked you up for lunch, and dont think I didnt see the kiss you planted on him.Me and Ms.Flora Mae was watching.Ashlee looked up in horror, but Monica ignored her and continued.You guys were giving off so much heat I thought the place was gonna catch on fire.Shoot, had me going through my contacts trying to recycle me a man.Monica looked at her friend with a serious expression.I dont want you to look up one day and realize youve missed out on a good man because of your pride.She stood.Now get ya butt up, take a shower, and lets go so you can see him.She looked around.But first, clean up this house.Goodness.18  After weeks of pretending Terrance was Bryan, Natalia was over it.No matter what she tried, nobody could take the place of him.As far as she was concerned, it didnt get any better than Bryan Andre Hunter.She wanted him.She needed him.If only hed been at a place financially where shed needed him, she would have left Terrance without a second thought.But since that wasnt the case, she was fine with having him available whenever she needed him.Natalia was glad Terrance had to take a three day trip to San Francisco for business.His mother, Catherine Elizabeth, whom she referred to as Cruella offered to keep Breah for a few days, freeing her to catch up on the lives of Bryan and Ashlee.She had grown tired of looking on social media, mainly because Bryan had stopped posting anything interesting.For the past few days, shed been going to their homes watching.Waiting for something, anything.Shed sat outside of Ashlees pitiful apartment and watched Bryan knock and knock on her door.She knew Ashlee was home because shed seen her check the mail minutes before.But she didnt let him in.This gave Natalia the push she needed to show Bryan her new look.She hoped hed take one look at her and want her the way hed fallen for Ashlee.She put on her black, curly, shoulder length wig that looked exactly like Ashlees hair.Shed found the exact dress Ashlee wore the night he proposed to her.Shed even gone online and ordered Juicy Couture perfume after shed heard Ashlee tell someone at church that it was her new favorite fragrance.If Ashlee liked it, she was certain Bryan felt the same way.Ashlee was a lot smaller than Natalia in height and weight.She couldnt do anything about the height, but right after shed given birth she had a tummy tuck.So her body was back in tact.With the exception of her implants and perfectly shaped derriere, judging by her current view of her full length wall to wall mirror in her bedroom, she looked just like Ashlee or rather, a new and improved version of Ashlee, in her own opinion.Twenty minutes later, she walked up to the building of Lockhart Stratton & Associates.19  Bryan sat at his desk trying hard to stay focused on work.With Ashlee not speaking to him, it was next to impossible.After all of these years of dating different women, he still couldnt understand them.Women were always saying men were only after one thing and that made them mad.But, when a man tried to respect them and do the right thing by not giving in to his lustful desires, they got mad about that too.He was worried about Ashlee.Hed expected her to come out of his townhouse so he could take her back to work that day, but she never came.After ten minutes passed, hed gone back inside to check on her, but shed already left.He stood and decided to go back to her apartment and try again.He stepped out of the elevator that led to the parking garage and did a double take of the woman that stood in front of him.With the exception of a very dark tan, the face looked like Natalia but the hair, the clothing, and the shade of lip gloss were all Ashlee.She even wore the same perfume Ashlee wore.This was turning into some fatal attraction type of stuff.Natalia?He said with a puzzled expression.She hadnt been to work since having Breah so he was surprised to see her.Well hello, sexy.Natalia replied.Ive missed you.Bryan didnt respond right away.Natalia had a wild expression in her eyes.Are you okay?Better than ever.His instincts told him not to engage.Right away, he thought she needed some serious mental health help but decided against verbalizing his thoughts.Ok.Wellum.Bye.He headed towards his car, but she was hot on his tail.She slammed his car door shut as soon as he opened it.Bryan spun around quickly and found her at eye level with him.What is your problem, woman?Leave.Me.Alone.Natalia wasnt fazed.Youre so sexy when you try to act all macho.I know youre just trying to play the role of faithful fiance.Look at me, Bryan.Do you like what you see?Ive changed.I look just like Ashlee now.I smell like her too.So, you dont need her anymore.Bryan attempted to move to the side, but she didnt give him any room to maneuver.He could have easily tossed her out of the way, but he didnt want to risk hurting her and facing a lawsuit.He was also a little afraid of what she might do.She was obviously unstable.He put his hands on her arms underneath her shoulders and gently pushed her away from him.When he did, she took it as an invitation and pushed him against his car kissing him aggressively.Ashlee and Monica pulled up and saw a couple that looked like they wanted to rip each others clothes off right there in the garage.Thats a hot mess, Monica said.In broad daylight too.Ashlee looked on shaking her head slowly from side to side.She couldnt see his face but she recognized his car.And, shed recognize his profile anywhere.No, she whispered over and over.No.He said he loved me.He told me I was perfect.She looked down at her ring.He gave me his ring.He was supposed to be different.Monica was fuming.She threw the car in park and unlocked the door.Ashlee touched her shoulder to stop her.Its okay, Mon.I expected it.She slumped down in her seat but continued to watch her perfect guy caught up in an intense lip lock with another woman in broad daylight.She dropped her head and closed her eyes before she had the chance to see Bryan push the lady off of him.Lets go, Ashlee whispered.Bryan was finally able to wrestle out of Natalias embrace.He didnt realize how strong she was.This time he didnt even try to get into his car.He went inside to alert the partners of what happened and to get her the help she obviously needed.After being there for almost a year, he often saw Natalia and Jenifer spending time together so he told Jenifer he was worried about Natalia and asked if maybe she could check to see if she was okay.A loud crashing sound brought people out of their offices to see what the commotion was about.The noise came from Bryans office.Jenifer, Bryan and one of the partners, David Lockhart slowly entered Bryans office.A deranged looking Natalia stood in the midst of a ransacked office.Chairs were overturned.A table had been flipped over.Papers and files were strewn all over the floor.She was screaming, Look at me, Bryan.Im just like her.Look at me.Why dont you want me?David and Bryan looked towards each other with their mouths open.Jenifer approached Natalia in an attempt to calm her.Natalia, why dont you step into the lounge with me?Lets talk.Natalias head snapped to the right.She looked possessed.Im not leaving with you.You never wanted Bryan and me together.Were not friends.She turned her attention to Bryan.Breah needs you Bryan.She needs her dad.Im not leaving without you!All eyes turned towards Bryan.Bryan didnt know what to say.If he thought hed regretted their affair before, he really regretted it at that moment.It was Natalia who made him promise to keep Breahs paternity a secret and now she wanted to put him on blast about it.He looked at her wild red eyes, her wild hair, and the way she couldnt keep still.Its her word against his and in her current state, nobody would believe her.He was trying to get things right with Ashlee.Now was not the time to drop a baby bomb on her.He turned towards David and whispered, Call security.He looked back at Natalia.Better yet, call a looney bin.She needs professional help.20  Two weeks after the incident with Natalia, Bryan still couldnt reach Ashlee.She hadnt been to work or at least thats what he was told when he called or went up there.Her home phone had been disconnected.The cell phone hed given her kept going straight to voicemail, and when he went to her apartment, she wasnt here.He usually depended on his mother or Mother Johnson to give him a little information, but Mother Johnson was in Arkansas visiting her children and grandchildren for the summer and his mother hadnt seen her either.She hadnt even been to church.He was so determined to find her that he showed up for the womens ministry bible study on Tuesday.Bryan was tired of waiting around.He couldnt believe she was this angry with him for trying to resist sex.Bryan loved Ashlee more than anything.He decided to do something about it.Good morning, Bryan said to Trina, the receptionist on duty at Hillside.Can you page Monica Jacobs?What do you want?Monica asked.Bryan jumped.Where had she come from?Monica had the look of a woman scorned.Bryan noted her hands were curled into fists resting on her hips.She stared at him through squinted eyes, and her lip trembled.She looked like she could crush him with her bare hand.Have you seen Ashlee?I havent been able to reach her for weeks.Did you give her the phone?Shes not answering or responding to my texts.Good.Monica said as she turned to leave.That means shes got good sense.Bryan caught up with her and blocked her path.Do you know why she wont talk to me?Monica laughed, but not because she was amused.Youre good, Bryan.Real good.You play that nice guy role so well you even had me fooled.Bryan looked confused.We saw you, Bryan.Saw what?
