Shed practiced the entire weekend.She didnt like wearing makeup other than lip gloss, but she let Monica talk her into wearing eyeliner and mascara.She hoped it wasnt obvious that shed dressed up.At the same time, she hoped hed take notice.She felt awkward being left alone with him.She fumbled with Mama Esthers keys and looked off to the side away from him.Bryan broke the silence, feeling nervous all of a sudden.You look beautiful, Ashlee.She looked up at him for a brief second, noticing how good he looked in his light brown sports jacket and baby blue dress shirt.The color combination made his eyes sparkle.She looked back down.Thank you.Oh, and thank you for the flowers.That was really nice of you.For the lunch too.How did you know I loved Paneras broccoli and cheddar soup?He watched her fidget with the car keys and took note that she wouldnt make eye contact with him.Shes really shy.He smiled.Lucky guess.Ashlee glanced around.The parking lot had started to fill up and she didnt want anyone to get the wrong idea.Id better get inside.Im sure Mama Esther would like to get to her seat.The nursery fills up fast so  Wait, Bryan interrupted.Can I at least call you some time?She hesitated.I dont have a cell phone and Im not home much.Well, let me take you out for lunch today after church?Ashlee didnt say anything for a while.She looked around, contemplating his offer.She met his gaze.Why?Bryan wasnt expecting that.Why what?Why do I want to take you out?Yes.Youre a lawyer, right?Yes.I mean look at you.Youre good looking  Bryans smile widened.You think Im good looking?Ashlee blushed.What I mean is, Im sure you have a lot of options.You can have any woman you want.Im a nursing assistant with two children living on a low budget income.What would we talk about?Bryan was baffled.He couldnt believe she thought so little of herself.Doesnt she know how special she is?Shes beautiful.How do I tell her shes all Ive thought about for two weeks?Ashlee, youre gorgeous.What you do for a living doesnt define you.Its just what you do.I would feel privileged to have the chance get to know you.Its obvious you love God and thats very attractive to me.Knowing how hard you work to make a life for you and your kids makes me respect you.In my mind, I think youre perfect.Id like a chance to see if thats true.Ashlee choked back tears.Shed never had a guy say anything so nice and sincere to her before.Okay, we can do lunch but not just us.I would feel better if we were with other people.Whatever you want, he replied.I always have Sunday dinner at my moms.Would you like to join us today?I could invite Mother Johnson as well.That sounds good.So, Ill see you then.She hurried inside without looking back.9  Ashlee had kept herself occupied in the kitchen with Mama Esther and Mother Hunter, in an attempt to avoid being along with Bryan.With the exception of corn bread and yams, Mother Hunter had prepared everything the night before.Shed told Ashlee she didnt need any help, but Ashlee insisted on doing something, anything to give her an excuse to stay in the kitchen.Ashlee filled a bowl with sweet potatoes and sat at the kitchen table and started to peel them when Bryan walked in with Jordan on his neck and Jade strapped to his chest in a baby carrier.Do you mind if I take them out into the backyard to play for a while?Bryan asked Ashlee.She met his intense gaze and then looked back down into the bowl.She shook her head slightly.No I dont mind.She looked up when he turned to leave, keeping her eyes on him until he was no longer in sight.Finally pulling her gaze from Bryans direction, she saw Mama Esther and Mother Hunter watching her.Mother Hunter with a smile and Mama Esther with a raised brow.Embarrassed, she continued peeling potatoes not bothering to say anything.After grabbing a few potatoes, the two women sat at the table on each side of Ashlee.When was the last time you heard from Jamal?Mother Hunter asked.I havent seen or heard from him since Jade was a week old and I have no intention of finding him.So youre over him?Ready to move on?Ashlee didnt respond.She locked eyes with Mother Hunter.She wondered why she was suddenly curious about Jamal.Ive never seen my son this smitten before.I can tell he really likes you and it looks like hes taken a liking to the kids too.Ashlee stood and walked to the window that had a clear view of the backyard.He lowered the basketball goal and was playing with Jordan while Jade kicked and laughed from being bounced around in the carrier.Looks like the feeling is mutual.She turned and leaned onto the counter.I know its hard to trust someone when youve been let down so many times before.Im not here to tell you to date my son, though I would love it if you became a part of our family.But dont be afraid to let someone in.I see the way you look at him.Theres nothing wrong with getting to know each other.Ashlee watched Mama Esther who had been quiet most of the afternoon.She wondered what her thoughts were.Feeling Ashlees gaze, she covered the pot of potatoes shed just put on the stove, and turned to face her.It doesnt matter what I think, she said predicting Ashlees thoughts.I dont see anything wrong with you and Bryan seeing each other from time to time.Hes turned out to be a fine young man, known him since he was a baby.Hes not Jamal and hes not your father.She smiled.Pray about it and see where God leads you.Ashlee sat back and smiled watching Bryan sit Jade into her portable high chair after getting Jordan settled with his food.Hed told her to sit and enjoy her dinner while he took care of the kids.Shed never met any man who was so attentive to her and her children.She could barely eat because she couldnt take her eyes off him.She looked up to see a smiling Mother Hunter who seemed a bit too happy to see her so mesmerized by her son.Once dinner was finished, and Bryan changed into a different shirt.One that didnt have sweet potatoes on it from Jade, who kept spitting it on him from laughing so much; Bryan was finally able to pull Ashlee away from his mom and Mother Johnson.They sat on the porchs swing and talked for hours.She surprised herself at how much shed opened up to him.He was attentive and very understanding.Shed told him about being a teen mother and how her parents had kicked her out to make it on her own.She told him how Mother Johnson had stepped in and took care of the kids when their father stopped showing up.I know it seems like Mama Esther is all in my business and that I look to her for answers a lot.She said to him.But since meeting her, I finally feel like I have a mother in my life.I know its crazy that a grown woman with children feels this way, but theres so much that I missed growing up.I often felt as if my own parents didnt want me around, and my getting pregnant was the excuse they were looking for to get rid of me.Her eyes welled with tears.Its been over three years and Ive only spoken to my mom once and thats only because I called her.Even then she rushed to get off.She sighed.The messed up part is my younger sister, Aja is pregnant but theres no talk of putting her out.She wasnt forced to drop out of school.My sister Tracy told me our mom is quitting her job to help with her child.Sometimes I wonder why I wasnt good enough.Bryan didnt say much.She needed to get this out and he was glad she was comfortable enough with him to share her private thoughts.What about your dad?Hows your relationship with him?Ashlee sighed.When he was around, hed treated me better than my mom did, but he wasnt there much.When I first moved out, he gave me some money and called a few times, but after a few months, the calls stopped coming.He was there when Id given birth to Jade, but that was that last Ive seen or heard from him.Bryan was fuming.He felt an overwhelming urge to protect her, show her that she is good enough.Hed asked her about her ex.She didnt seem fazed about him at all.Shed accepted that he wasnt a part of her life.She made it very clear that two things she could not and would not deal with was a man who lied to her and a man who didnt acknowledge or take care of his children.After what Jamal put her through, that was understandable.10  Bryan went into work the next day floating on clouds from the time hed spent with Ashlee.He struggled to focus on work because Ashlee was all he wanted to think about.When the evening had drawn to a close, he wasnt ready to say good bye.Bryan offered to take Ashlee and her kids home, but Mother Johnson was not having it.She can get home the same way she got here.Besides, its getting late and yall dont have no business being inside of a car alone after dark.But, we wont be alone, Mother Johnson.Well have the kids with us.Bryan reasoned.Kids asleep in the backseat is the same as being alone.When yall get married, you can take her wherever you want whenever you want.Now say good night.Dude, whats on your mind?Kevin snapped his fingers to get Bryans attention.Hey, man, when did you get here?Whos got your mind tied up?Bryan looked up and smiled.I think Im in love, man.Why?Kevin said with a frown.Youre what?Twenty four?Why would you want to fall in love?Im not falling until Im at least thirty five.He walked further in to Bryans office and shut the door behind him.Dude, its a good thing you and Natalia didnt hook up.I hear shes about three months pregnant.Bryans smile faded.He turned to his friend.What?Yeah, man.You dodged a huge bullet.If Bryan thought he couldnt concentrate before, he definitely couldnt now.He thought back to his last conversation with Natalia.Its no big deal.We barely even have sex.Im not in love with him.Bryan needed some air.He stood up, left Kevin standing in his office and went outside.He and Natalias affair started almost four months ago and lasted for three months.He always managed to be careful, with the exception of the one time shed surprised him in the garage by sneaking up and pulling him into his car.If shes three months, I could easily be the father.He gave his head three hits with the palm of his hand.Stupid.Stupid.Stupid.How could you have been so stupid?He could barely stand the thought of looking at her and now they could possibly be sharing a child.Worrying about it wouldnt do him any good.He sent her a text asking her to come outside and talk to him.How are you feeling?He asked as she stepped into the garage.Confused, she replied, Im fine.Why?Are you pregnant?What?
