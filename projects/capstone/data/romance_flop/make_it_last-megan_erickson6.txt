Good.Recalling that he hurled slut at his sister should embarrass him.Im sorry, Jamie mumbled.Cam licked his lips.Yeah, Im sure you are.First of all, you need to tell her that.And second of all, you need to understand why thats not okay.Jamie looked up.Because shes my sister?Well ...Cam tilted his head as he thought of how he wanted to word this.Yeah, because shes your sister, but you also dont treat any woman like that.Would you call me a slut if I started talking about girls I slept with?Jamie shook his head slowly.Yeah, so dont say that shit to your sister or another woman.Got it?Jamies face was red, but he nodded.Cam patted the table and stood up.Gonna get your sister.Sit tight, all right?As he took a step away, Jamie called his name.Cam turned around.Get me a burger, will ya?Jamie asked, his eyes bright again.Cam rolled his eyes.Sure, man.Gotta put some meat on your bones, right?Jamie flexed.Hey, nothing wrong with my guns.Cam turned back around, laughing, and walked toward Tate.Her face lit up and she sprinted out from around the counter.He met her at the end as she launched herself into his arms.Thank you, she whispered.Of course.She pulled back.You guys had a good talk?Yep.About what?Cam ran his tongue over his teeth.Thats between us.But I think were on our way to getting our relationship back.Tates smile was worth all the anxiety.Im so glad.He patted her ass.Now youre up.Hes got some things to say to you, I think.Yeah?Can you take your break now?I think so.Then go talk to your brother.She blinked, then pressed her lips to his in a quick kiss.With a squeeze to his hip and a wink, she was off to Jamie.Oh, and he wants a burger!Cam called after her.Great, can you order us two?she said over her shoulder.Cam huffed and she laughed.TATE SLIPPED INTO the booth across from her brother.He looked chagrined.Hi, she said.Hey, he answered.And that was pretty much the extent of the conversation aside from the awkward meeting of gazes until Anne came over and plopped their burgers in front of them.If I dont see lips moving soonand I dont mean for eatingIm going to come take these burgers away.Am I clear?Yes, Tate said.Crystal, Jamie answered.Anne nodded and then walked away.Tate met Cams eyes where he was perched at the counter on a stool.He winked at her with a laugh, and she glared at him before focusing on her brother.Tate poked around her fries, looking for the perfect one that wasnt too crunchy or too soft.Youre doing that weird fry thing, Jamie said.Oooh, that one looked good.She picked it up and dunked it in ketchup.What weird fry thing?He pointed to her with a fry that looked soggy and limp.Where you spend five hours picking out the perfect fry, which makes no sense, because you always eat the whole basket anyway.I do not spend five hours.Well, it sure seems like it.Why do you care how I eat my fries?I dont care.I was just pointing out  All of a sudden, Tates basket was no longer in front of her.And Jamies wasnt in front of him.And Anne was standing at the end of their booth, her lips pressed in a thin line, her eyes flashing.What did I say?I want to point out that our lips were moving, Jamie explained.Annes head whipped to face him and he shrank in his seat.I hand these both over to that Hispanic hunk over there to eat unless I hear some real conversation.Quit pressuring us, Tate huffed.Quit stalling, Anne snapped back.Tate slumped down and crossed her arms over her chest.She started to count to ten to get her blood pressure down, when she heard across from her a mumbled Im sorry.She looked at Jamie, who was tugging on his ear and eyeing her through his lashes.Ive been a dick lately, huh?Tate softened her posture and leaned forward.Its not all your fault.I havent been there for you.He shook his head.No, you have.But I took it for granted and didnt take into consideration how much stress youve been under.She reached out and laid her hand over the top of his.Its been stressful for both of us.Tates nose twitched and she glanced over to see their plates at the end of the table.Anne was gone, having left sometime when they werent paying attention, leaving the food behind.Tate turned back to her brother.I made some mistakes, and when Cam and I broke up, I hadnt thought about how that affected you.And Im so sorry about that.Jamie flipped his hand over so their palms met.He said the same thing.But were older now and  You were the same age as me when you guys broke up, though.And you keep talking about how you were so young then.He squinted at her.Tate bit her lip.I hate saying, You just wait, but in a way thats the only thing I know to say.When I was eighteen, I thought I knew everything.I thought I was such a grown up.She laughed sadly.The thing is, now Im not any closer to being a grown up.I think thats how I know that I have grown up a little bit.Because now I realize I might not ever feel grown up.She cocked her head.Does that make sense?Youre a grown up when you realize youll never feel like a grown up?Tate nodded as sagely as she could.Pretty much.That ...shouldnt make sense, but it kinda does.Tate reached over and rummaged through her fries.Jamie did the same, and then a fry was under her nose.Why are you giving me a fry?Its a good one, right?She eyed it, checking for crispness and oil content.Yeah, it does look pretty good.He dropped it in her open hand.Are you calling a truce with a fry?she asked.Does your highness need filet mignon or something?Tate answered by tossing the fry in her mouth.Fine, truce.They dug into their burgers, while Tate told him a story about how Anne thought an upright mop was an intruder and called 911 before she realized cleaning supplies werent going to steal the register money.Jamie laughed, and Tate saw the younger boy in the almost a mans face.They fell silent until Tate spoke up.I tried, you know.I tried to keep us together.Jamie tore apart a napkin and dropped the bits on his plate.I know.I thought a little bit about it, because Im close to the age you were when you found out and ...Im not sure I would have handled it all like you have.You kept the bills paid and you worked your ass off.And you took care of Dad and me.I just didnt appreciate it.Tate tried to swallow her gulp of water around the lump in her throat.Thanks for saying that.Jamie met her eyes.You deserved to hear it.Then his gaze shifted over her shoulder and his face lit up.Tate turned around.She hadnt heard the door to the diner open.She blocked it out when she wasnt on duty, so she hadnt realized someone had walked inside.A girl stood inside the door, scanning the diner.She stood about Tates height and had long brown hair she pulled into a ponytail.She wore glasses and a simple pair of jeans with a plain red T shirt.Nothing about her stuck out, but when her gaze found Jamie, her face cracked into a huge smile and Tate raised her eyebrows.She looked at Jamie like he held the Earth on his shoulders.Hell, Tate thought, if someone looked at me like that, Id be smitten, too.I, uh, Jamie began, drawing Tates attention away from the girl who was making her way toward their table.I invited Ashley to meet you.I hope thats okay.Tate looked down at her stained T shirt and fraying apron.You look fine.He chuckled.She shot him a glare as the girl took a seat in the booth beside Jamie.Her big brown eyes focused on his face and she had a pretty, soft voice.Hi.Hey.Jamies face was softer than Tate had ever seen it.She liked the look.Ashley seemed to calm him, and she wondered where Ashley had been when he was getting drunk.Tate, this is my girlfriend, Ashley.Ashley, this is my sister, Tate.Tate was a hugger but it was awkward to reach across the table so she stuck out her hand to shake.Which also felt awkward but shed already made the movement, so she went with it.The girl shook Tates hand with a nervous smile on her face.Hello, Jamie talks about you all the time.About how Im a pain in the ass dictator?Ashley shook her head, her ponytail swishing along her shoulders.No, he loves you.Tate glanced at Jamie, but his eyes were on his girlfriend.Theyd had sex.Tate knew it with every bone in her body.Teenagers werent that attentive with each other unless theyd taken that step.She needed to make that birds and bees convo top priority.And thank you, Ashley said, drawing Tates attention.For what?Ashley glanced at Jamie before shoring up her shoulders and continuing.For getting him back on track.For a while there ...She waved her hand, and Jamie cut in.We broke up.Tate frowned.Oh, I didnt know ...Jamie sighed.I didnt tell you.But, Ashley cut in, things have been better since the accident.Hes promised to get his act together and I know its because of you.Tate didnt think she did much other than piss Jamie off, but shed take the thanks.Hes my brother and I love him, so youre welcome.Ashley smiled.You hungry?Jamie asked her.Burger and fries?Jamie called over to Cam.We need another burger and fries.What, do I look like I work here?Cam called back.Tate laughed as she stood up to put the order in.Nice to meet you, Ashley.I hope to see you around a lot more.Ashley grinned.Me too.14      CAM RAN HIS fingertips down Tates arm and watched as goose bumps rose on her skin in the wake of his touch.He pressed a kiss to her bare shoulder and felt her shudder under his lips.They were in her bedroom and he needed to leave for work in approximately thirty five minutes.Theyd just finished playing Utope and all he wanted to do was get her naked and get inside her.But her father was right outside in the living room, and Tate had never been good at being quiet.She rolled onto her side and propped her head on her palm.Its not nice to get me all worked up and then jet off to work in your tight black T shirt.He laughed and leaned in, pressing a kiss to her neck, adding a little tongue and teeth.When another shudder ran through her body, he grinned.Come out tonight.He cupped the back of her neck and ran a thumb along the hinge of her jaw.When I get a break, we can hang out.She scrunched her lips to the side.Ill text Van.If shes going to be there, then Ill come.Hows that?Thats acceptable.She dropped her eyes to the comforter between them.Thanks a lot for talking to Jamie.He scooted closer.Of course.Her eyes met his.When are we going to talk about ...the future?Cam knew she was uneasy about what was going to happen in the fall.She hadnt fully let herself enjoy this time with him.He could tell sometimes by the way she zoned out or hesitated before full leaning into his touch.It killed him, but at that point, he didnt have answers yet.The job prospects in Paradise sucked.And unless something better came along than what he had now, he didnt know if he had any options but to take the job.And if he didnt leave, his mom might toss him out.He had a couple ideas swarming in his head, and he decided to test the waters with the first one.So, your dad is doing well, right?And hes got Anne here.And your brother still has another year of school.Would ...He took a deep breath and plunged in.Would you consider moving to New York with me?Her eyes widened, and then blinked.Once.Twice.Her chest rose with deep breaths, and her hand was limp in his.He tugged on it.You dont have to answer now, but ...Go with you?she whispered.He nodded.Yeah, go with me.She blinked again.Live in New York with you?He kept nodding.Yes, live with me.In sin.Until we can afford a wedding or make an appointment at the justice of the peace.Her head jerked, and then her hair whipped his face as she threw her head back and burst out laughing.He didnt know if that was a good or bad sign.His body tensed.What the hell are you laughing at?She lowered her head with watery eyes.Oh, Camilo Ruiz, you blew me away with that romantic proposition, so  Do you want romance?Because  I didnt say I wanted romance, ya idiot.She chuckled.Then her face softened.Id live in sin with you anywhere.You know that.He relaxed and shoved her onto her back, then he covered her with his body and nudged her chin with his nose.She angled her head so he could focus his attention on the pale skin of her neck.Freaking me out, laughing at me like that.He followed the tendon with his tongue and teeth.Is that a yes?Her body tensed for a second below him and there was a pause before she answered.I want to.Please know that.He pulled back to look in her eyes.But ...She shook her head.Theres no but coming.I was going to say that I want to make it work, and I need some time to think about it.Okay?Okay.He fingered a lock of her hair spread out on the pillow.You know Id stay here with you, too.She gripped his face in her hands.I love you, Camilo.But I dont want that for you.But what about what I want for me?Those hazel eyes bored into his.Can you honestly tell me right now that youd be happy living in Paradise, knowing you had an amazing job off in New York?He hesitated because, fuck, did he ever want that job.But that job didnt come with Tate.And he wanted her more than anything.But that hesitation was a mistake because Tate pounced on it.See?Thats what I thought.Cam pulled his head out of her grasp and sat at the end of the bed to pull on his boots.So you get to think about moving to New York with me, but I dont have thirty fucking seconds to answer a big life question?Because I know the answer  Do you?He turned his head to face where she sat up on the bed.Do you really?She bit her lip, uncertainty crossing her face, but she plowed on.If I would have told you about my dad back when we were eighteen, what would you have done?I would have come home, he answered immediately.Aha!she said, rising onto her knees and pointing at him.But youd regret it.And then youd resent me.And then where would we be?He snatched up his T shirt and pulled it on, then walked toward the door to her bedroom.He opened it, then turned around to face her.Thats where I think youre wrong.You act like you can tell the future, and thats utter bullshit.Time to grow up and realize adults compromise on decisions, Tatum.Her mouth fell open on a gasp, and Cam walked out.But his Tate never could let him have the last word.He heard a thump behind him as she jumped off the bed, and then bare feet thudding down the hall behind him.Tates father was watching TV in his recliner and stared at them with wide eyes as they both stomped by.Dont you dare walk away from me, she growled after him and he turned around, finding her wicked hot all pissed off.No one did angry female like Tatum Ellison.I have to go to work, Tatum, he growled back.This conversation isnt over.She pointed at him with narrowed eyes.You bet your ass it isnt.She crossed her arms over her chest, and he had to suppress a grin, fighting the twitching muscles at the corner of his mouth.Youre doing that thing where youre trying not to smile.No, Im not.She cocked her head.Your lips are twitching, you liar.He reached out and grabbed her hand and hauled her to him.He leaned down to kiss her but stopped when his lips were an inch from hers.Think about what I said?She heaved a sigh.I will.Think about what I said?He nodded.I will.She rose up on her toes until her lips met his.Then she backed away with a smile.See you later tonight.He raised his chin to her, gave her dad a salute, and then walked out.TATE SIPPED HER light beer and watched as Cam checked IDs at the door.He sat in an alcove, and the lighting cast odd shadows over his face, which only made his dimples more noticeable when he smiled at some forty year old cougar.Tate glared at the womans back as she made her way to the bar and then focused again on Cam.He turned his head, met her gaze.And then winked.That smug, sexy bastard.Van plopped down across from her with a pink drink in a martini glass.Tate eyed it.Whats that?Cosmo.Tate raised her eyebrows and looked around the bar like it was the first time shed seen it.A cosmo?Im sorry, are we in Manhattan dining on lobster and wearing our good diamonds?Van shoved Tates shoulder with a laugh.Shut up.A cosmo isnt that fancy.Youre just practicing for L. A. , huh?Tate lifted up her beer and tipped the neck toward Van before taking a swig.Ill be over here enjoying my Miller High Life like that classy gal I am.Van rubbed her finger over the rim of the glass.Maaaybeee this winter you will be in Manhattan, sipping cosmos, dripping in jewels.Tate plunked her beer down on the table and glared at her best friend.Shed told Van as soon as she got to the bar about her conversation with Cam, spewing it all out in one long stream of breath before they could even get their first drink.Van ...Her friend leaned forward.Youre thinking about it right?Tate blew out a breath.I am, okay?Im thinking about it very seriously.But Jamie will still have another year of school and Dad ...She let her voice trail off.Why was she wishing doom on their heads?Hed been doing well.Van took a sip her drink and made a face.Gonna have to talk to Trev about this.Anyway, I think you need to realize they would want you to live your life.But we just got Jamie speaking to us again and he seems to be getting back on track but  Your father is aware of Jamies behavior now, so he can help get him back on track.This isnt all on you anymore.It never should have been.Tate scrunched her lips back and forth, mulling it over.She wondered if part of her was scared to take that leap, to travel to an unknown city when all shed known all her life was Paradise.Was she making excuses now?She looked up at Cam as he sat on his stool at the bar.His head was turned, shouting something to Trevor behind the bar.Then Cam threw back his head and laughed.And the sound was like a warm blanket, wrapping around her, promising her safety.How could she leave that?I think I want to, she said quietly.And I think you should, Van said back, just as quietly.A chair scraped beside her and she looked up as Marcus took a seat at their table.Hey, Tate.She hadnt talked to him since that awkward night at the bar.She darted her gaze to Cam, who was no longer laughing, his eyes dark and piercing into Marcuss back.She cleared her throat.Hey.Havent seen you around for a while.Marcuss jaw was tight, and she didnt like the glazed look in his eyes, like hed already had a couple of drinks.Uh, just been busy, you know.Working.Helping the family.Marcus chuckled, a weird, choked sound.Right, just working and helping the family and crawling into Ruizs bed again.Really fucking busy, Tate.Tate was stunned.Utterly stunned.Marcus might not be her best friend, but hed never been nasty.Marcus, Van spoke up, her voice low.If you dont get up right now and leave us be, Ill be forced to call Trevor and Cam over here, and no one wants that.But it was like Marcus didnt hear her, because his gaze never wavered from Tate.She put her hand on the table, palm down, in front of Van and met Marcuss gaze.First of all, theres no crawling being done, Marcus.What I do and who I do it with is none of your business.He snorted and his lip curled.You think youre hot shit again, dont you?Ruiz is back so you get to relive your popular prom queen days.Well, news flash, Tate.Youre just a high school graduate working at a diner.Cams gonna hightail it out of here and away from your white trash ass as soon as he can.Youre nothing but filler.Tates mouth dropped open.Wow.Holy shit, Van said with raised eyebrows.You practice that filth in the mirror before you came out, Marcus?Damn.Marcus pointed in Vans face, and then at Tate.Laugh it up, both of you.Youll see.Tate heard his boots first and knew what was coming.She shrank back in her seat, wishing she could hide away in the bathroom.Outside, Marcus, Cam said once he reached their table.His arms hung at his sides, loose, like he was the picture of relaxation, but the veins in his forearms stood out, revealing the tenseness of his muscles.Marcuss eyes widened and he smirked.Oh, you even got your own bodyguard now, Tate.Good for you.He leaned closer.But hes not going to be around forever.Cam grabbed Marcus around the biceps to haul him to his feet.Leave her alone.Marcus tried to shrug him off, but Cam held firm.Fuck you, Ruiz.Just go on and get the fuck out of town already.Looking forward to catching Tate on the rebound again.Cams face didnt move, not even a muscle twitch, and it was a little freaky.He stepped up to Marcus, toe to toe, their noses almost touching.Im going to kick you out of this bar in thirty seconds but before I do, Im going to make it clear that Tate will never be on the rebound.Ever.Because shes with me.And Im with her.And if I do leave this town, shes coming with me.Now Marcus was the one with an open mouth, speechless.And so was Tate, and so was Van.Because that was it.Cam had spoken.And then he was leading Marcus to the front door of the bar and out the door, before Tate could react.Wow.Holy shit, Van said.Tate turned to Van and blinked.Van blinked back.And then they dissolved into giggles.Tate straightened and wiped her eyes.Am I supposed to be upset about what Marcus said?I mean, it was just kind of mean and weird, right?Van plopped down in her chair and sipped her drink as Tate took her seat across from her.No, youre not supposed to be upset.Hes jealous and drunk.That was kinda hot.Cam going all Imma tell it like it is.Tate started giggling again.Van tilted her head.Im glad youre not getting all weird and letting some asshole get to you.Tate wiped the condensation off the bottle in front of her.Marcus is ...Marcus.And Cam is ...well ...Cam.He says what he means and he means what he says and he doesnt lie.Vans eyes softened.And he loves you.Tate nodded.He does.He loves me, and I believe it.I know he hooked up with all kinds of girls in college.I used to stalk his Facebook page when I was feeling pathetic about myself.In his pictures ...so many girls.She straightened and leaned forward.He could have stayed with any of them.Smart, pretty girls who want to be teachers or doctors or whatever.But he didnt.He came home.And he chose me.Again.She swirled her bottle on the table.And Im going to try really hard not to fuck it up again.What do you want to do?Van asked.Cam wants to work in security research but what do you want to do?Werent you going to go to college for software developing?Tate snorted.Shed had such big dreams in high school.She thought she could do anything.And then life knocked her on her ass and she still hadnt gotten up.God, that was a silly dream, and no, I dont want to do that anymore.So what do you want?she pressed.Tate glanced at Cam, who had walked back inside after tossing Marcus out and stopped to talk to Trevor at the bar.I want to spend time with my family, and I want to be with Cam.Do I have to have huge career ambitions?She glanced at Van, who wore a small smile.No, no you dont.I feel very anti feminist.Rosie the Riveter would be disappointed.Van laughed.It isnt anti feminist not to have big career ambitions.You just have to agree women deserve equality if they want a career.We fought so wed have this choice, to have a career or not, you know?Tate sighed.I want to be a mom.Van blinked and brushed her hand under her eye.Youd make a great one.Cams boots clomped on the floor as he stepped toward them.He leaned down with one arm braced on the table and the other cupping her neck.You all right?Dudes an asshole.She smiled.Im fine.Cam stared into her eyes, like he didnt believe her.I heard what he said.You sure?She shrugged.What would that make me if I believe things he said to me over what you say to me?Cam frowned.Uh ...An idiot, Tate said decisively.It would make me a pretty big idiot.Cams smile started at one corner of his mouth and spread to the other side, until the whites of his teeth showed and his dimples popped.And my Tatums not an idiot, he whispered.Not this time, she whispered back.He pressed his lips to hers and stood.Need to get back to work.You gonna hang out for a little?Yep.He gave her another smile, nodded to Van and then walked back to his post at the door.Van took a sip of her drink.You lucky bitch.15      TATE YAWNED AS she wiped down the tables early one morning at the diner.Shed stayed up late with Jamie last night, talking about his grades and possibly joining Junior ROTC next year at school.Shed been going to the bar more often than usual last week to see Cam at work, so shed stayed home last night with Jamie and her dad.Theyd watched baseball and ate ice creammoose tracksand yelled steeeerike!at the television.She had to start making sure she spent as much time with them as she could, especially if she planned to leave this fall ...Her stomach dipped and a bead of sweat dripped down her lower back.Her hands shook as she straightened a ketchup bottle.She blamed it on caffeine but really, she knew it was the thought of moving.God, what would she even do in New York?She couldnt picture herself in a big city.Being a New Yawkah.Cam always had that attitude, that look, like you knew he wasnt long for Paradise.But her?No one ever thought shed leave.She never thought shed leave.Shed avoided talking to Cam about it.If he brought it up, she told him she was still thinking about it.At first he just smiled, but then the frowns started and now he hadnt brought it up for a couple of days.She wondered if he was starting to give up on her.Damn it, she muttered to herself.She could leave if it meant keeping Cam, right?She hadnt told her dad yet.And there was a reason for that.Because part of her knew hed tell her to go.And she wasnt sure she wanted the permission.Tate, Annes voice said from behind her, and she straightened up from the table shed been cleaning.Yeah?Anne gestured the back room with her head.We got a frozen shipment in the back.Would you help me put it away?Sure, she answered.She checked with the one table she had, a trucker eating breakfast, and dropped him his check.After filling his coffee again, she told him he could leave the cash on the table when he was finished and to holler if he needed anything.She and Anne loaded bags of chicken nuggets and fries in the freezer in the back room, throwing out anything that had expired.Spoke to your father.Anne nudged a bag of Tater Tots with her toe.Oh yeah?What about?Tate lifted the bag.You moving to New York.Tate dropped the bag of Tater Tots on her feet and then howled as hard rocks of frozen potatoes crushed her toes.She kicked the bag off and glared at Anne.Whatre you talking about?Anne smiled.How are your feet?Tate glared.Dont you worry about my feet.What do you know about me moving to New York?I overhead you talking to Cam  So you were eavesdropping like a weirdo   and he mentioned you moving to New York with him in the fall.I didnt realize it was this big secret.I said something to your dad in passing and ...well ...he was surprised.The blood drained from Tates face.When was this?Anne leaned on the steel counter behind her.A couple of days ago?Why hasnt he said anything to me?Anne sighed.I think hes waiting for you to tell him yourself.Im sorry I spilled it.I didnt realize it was classified information.She looked chagrined enough that Tate couldnt be mad at her.She hadnt done anything malicious on purpose.And Tate should have told her father all of this sooner.Her own fault really.She wiggled her toes and kicked the bag of Tater Tots.Its okay.She looked up.What did he say?Anne smiled.I think you need to talk to him about that.Tate clasped her hands under her chin and batted her eyelashes.Pretty please?May I at least have a hint?Anne pursed her lips and rolled her eyes.He wants you to be happy and live your life.Tate squinted.Here or in New York?Anne cupped her cheek.Thats up to you.You have to make a decision for yourself now.Its time, dont you think?Tate bit her lip and nodded.BY THE END of her workday, Tate was dead on her feet.Cam had texted about coming over for dinner but she told him she needed to talk to her dad.His reply text:  Why?You know.His next text came five minutes later.I love you.Love you, too.She pulled into her driveway and parked her car.She didnt see Jamies car.Or ...rather ...Mrs.Ruizs car that Jamie was borrowing until he found something else cheap.She didnt think he was working tonight.As she stepped out of her car in her bare feet, Jamie pulled in behind her.He smiled at her as he got out of his car, and then reached back in to pull out a pizza box.Hungry?Famished.Come on then.Jamie called out, Pizzas here when they walked into the house, which was unnecessary because their dad sat on the recliner in front of them, an amused smile on his face.I see that.They set the pizza box on the coffee table and ate their pizza slices off paper plates on their laps.It was Tates favorite type of family dinner, sitting around the TV, eating and laughing.Forgetting about everything else that was going on and just enjoying each others company.With Jamies issues and her stress, they hadnt done this enough.She looked over at her dad, and he must have felt her eyes on him, because he winked at her before looking back at the TV.She smiled and looked down at her pizza, picking off a pepperoni slice and dropping it in her mouth.She mulled in her head how to bring it up, because Jamie was in the room so she had to break it gently to him ...The footrest of her dads recliner jolted back, and he placed his feet on the floor, leaning forward, eyes on her.I was waiting you out, baby, but we need to talk.Tates eyes darted to Jamie and then back to her father.Um ...well ...Jamie waved his hand.Its cool, I know already.Tate threw up her hands.What the hell?Everyones stealing my news!Her dad clasped his hands in his lap.Why didnt you talk to me about this sooner?Tate relaxed her arms and picked at her fingernails.I dunno.I think you do.She bit the inside of her cheek.Because I wasnt ready to make the decision yet myself.And whys that?This feels like therapy, Tate grumbled.
