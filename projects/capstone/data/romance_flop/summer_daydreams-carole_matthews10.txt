Well go somewhere real nice.Petals my life, too.Im doing all this for her, Olly admitted.With one last look, he also put his picture away.Thats why I need to get our money back.I dont want those bastards stealing her future.Youre right, my friend.Family is everything.We must never forget that.It was a lesson that Olly felt hed already learned.All he wanted now was to get on a plane and fly back to his wife, his child, to his old, safe life.Diego clapped him on the back.Now I must work.Thanks.Olly crushed his empty can and threw it in the nearby rubbish bin.Ill catch you later.Diego held up a hand in farewell.Olly walked back to his car and slid inside the baking tin again.Another long wait stretched ahead of him.He listened to the radio.He read about all the shootings in the local paper.It was as hot as hell in here.Despite himself, his eyes grew heavy.Eventually, he let his head sink back against his seat.On top of everything else, the bed in the Miami branch of the Bates Motel was lumpy and he could feel springs poking in his back.He didnt like to think whod slept in it before him.81      He hadnt realised that hed fallen asleep until he heard the purring of the engine of another vehicle slowly coming up the alley behind him.Olly blinked his eyes open as a Mercedes sports car passed by his parked car.It wasnt a shiny, new Merc.It was sort of battered and creaking.Suddenly he was wide awake.He had a feeling in his gut about this and his insides turned to water.The car pulled up at the side of the Home Mall offices and his heart started to race.His palms, already sweating in the heat, grew slick with sweat.Someone clambered out of the passenger seat of the car.The bulky frame, the moon face; they were familiar to him now.This was, indeed, the woman he knew from the newspapers as Lola Cody.He watched, eyes narrowed, as she waddled to the door of Home Mall.She wore white crops, a voluminous floral smock, flip flops and, of all the cheek, had one of Nells handbags over her shoulder.Probably the original sample that Nell sent her after the initial contact.That racked up Ollys rage quota another notch.He watched while she unlocked the shutter and waited as it slowly rolled up.A moment later and her husband and partner in crime, Benito Cody, joined her.His bad Hawaiian shirt was barely buttoned across the ample circumference of his stomach.Clashing shorts in what must have been XXXL size skimmed his knees.Neither of them looked like theyd stinted on the pizza and burgers.He could take on these two.No trouble.They both heaved their lumbering bodies into the office.A second later, and before he had time to think better of it, Olly was out of the car and following them.The door was just about to swing closed when he stuck his foot in it.Lola Cody and her husband had entered the front office just ahead of him.He pushed inside and quietly dropped in behind them.Hello, he said before they had a chance to get settled.Both of them spun round, open mouthed with shock.Olly stared at them.They didnt look like slick con artists; they looked like greasy no hopers and he wondered how theyd managed to trick so many people.He felt stupid that he and Nell had believed their tissue of lies and had been taken in by them.If only theyd thought to come out and meet them, see their operation, before they agreed to part with any cash, then they would have seen them for what they were.Still, there was no time for what ifs now.He was here and he wanted his money back and wouldnt be going anywhere until he got it.Theres nothing here, Lola Cody said.Her voice was loud, brassy, and she was chewing gum.We have nothing.Clearly, they thought they were about to be robbed.In some ways, they were.I think you do, Olly said.In fact, you have something thats mine.The couple backed away into the corner of the room, up against one of the dented filing cabinets that lined it.We dont know who you are, man, her husband whined.The name Nell McNamara mean anything to you?Their mouths dropped a little wider.Ive come to get our money back.We dont have it, Lola said, but her eyes travelled shiftily to the safe tucked away in the corner.Just as hed hoped.It looked like their cash was kept here.Open the safe, Olly snapped.I want our money back and I wont leave until Ive got it.Lolas husband lurched across the room, his bloated bulk swayed and wobbled and Olly knew instantly what he was targeting.From behind his back, Olly produced the baseball bat that had previously lived there.He was glad now that hed decided to take it and keep it in his car as a precaution, as insurance.This what youre looking for?Benito Cody blanched.Olly casually tapped the baseball bat against his palm.Now perhaps youll talk sensibly to me.Lola Cody was rooted to the spot.Open the safe.Get out my money.All of it.Thirty thousand dollars.When youve done that, Ill leave you in peace.Neither Lola nor her husband moved.Olly slammed the baseball bat down on top of the desk.The wood splintered.Do it!he shouted.My patience is wearing very thin.The Codys both jumped and cowered away from him.Olly shocked even himself.He did the baseball bat thing because thats what hed seen happen in the movies.The worrying fact was that, as adrenalin coursed through him, he realised that he wanted Nells money back more than anything in the world and nothing, and certainly not these two fat, badly dressed crooks, would stop him.He had no idea that, inside, he was quite so scary.He wondered if he should adopt an outlandish karate stance but was afraid that it was a step too far, particularly when he was so rusty.OK, OK, Lola Cody said.She sighed and, cursing under her breath, waddled towards the safe.You, he said to her husband, hands in the air where I can see them.With a gargantuan effort, Lola bent down and knelt before the heavy metal door.Huffing and puffing, she turned the dial, this way and that.A moment later the safe sprang open.Now it was Ollys turn to stare, open mouthed.The safe was stuffed full of money.Piles and piles of dollars bundled together spilled out.There must be hundreds of thousands in there.All in readys.His eyes bulged as he tried to take it all in.Clearly in Lola Codys world, crime did pay.And really rather well, it seemed.Thirty thousand dollars, Olly said.Thats what you owe me.Count it out.At a ponderous pace, Lola Cody pulled the bundles from the safe and let them fall to the floor.Olly now wished that hed thought to bring his holdall with him.He hadnt realised quite how big thirty thousand dollars was in cash.There was an empty cardboard box on the floor and he kicked it towards her.In there, he instructed.Quickly.The woman pulled the box to her side.Count it out, Olly barked.One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, she spat out as she placed the money into it.Her husband, hands aloft, watched her unmoving.It looked like Lola Cody was the brains behind the operation.He was just a useless pile of lard.Faster, Olly said.I havent got all day.The speed picked up a bit.The minute the box was filled, he was going straight to the motel to collect his stuff, and then his next port of call would be Miami International Airport and back home on the first flight he could get.Put an extra three thousand in there, he instructed.Thatll cover the expenses Ive incurred having to come out here and collect it.Lola Cody curled her lip at that but silently complied.It made him feel better to think that shed be picking up the bill for the skanky motel.If hed been certain of the outcome, he might well have stayed somewhere nicer.Eventually, the box was full of money.Done, she said flatly.It had better all be there, Olly said.The minute I leave, Ill be counting it and you dont want me to come back.Its all there, Lola Cody said.Now get out.Still sparky.Olly wanted to hurt them, to make them pay for all the pain that theyd put him and Nell through, but that would just reduce him to their level.Getting their cash back would be enough.This is justice, he said.If it was my call, youd be going to jail.For a long time.Be thankful that Im only taking back whats rightfully mine.With that, he picked up the cardboard box.Thirty thousand dollars was quite a heavy load, but it felt good to have it in his arms at last.Hed keep the baseball bat for the moment.Just in case.Youre finished, he said to Lola Cody.Whereas he felt like a phoenix rising from the ashes.He backed out of the office and into the Miami sunshine.82      Olly walked briskly across to his car, conscious that he had a cardboard box overflowing with bundles of cash.His heartbeat was starting to return to a more normal pace.So far, so good.Hey, buddy!Diego shouted across to him.Get what you came for?Yes!Thank you!he called back.Olly could only hope that they now didnt decide to mug him for his thirty grand.But Diego seemed like a solid bloke.Sure enough, both he and Andrs simply waved to him and appeared to be staying where they were.If hed had a hand free, Olly would have waved back.Look after that little girl of yours, Diego called.I will do!Opening the boot, Olly tossed the baseball bat inside.He sighed with relief, glad that he hadnt had to use that.When all was said and done, he wasnt one for violence.Lola Cody might not feel quite the same, but he was pleased that this had been handled swiftly and smoothly.It had, in the grand scheme of things, been quite a painless operation.Like taking candy from a baby.He had got what hed come for.Olly allowed himself a smile.Wait until he told Nell.Shed be beside herself with joy.He took one last look at the money hed just recovered, their money, then he started to lower in the box.As he did, the door of the Home Mall offices burst open and Benito and Lola Cody launched themselves out of it.They barrelled over to where he was and both pounced on him.The cardboard box fell on the ground and the bundles of money spilled out into the dust.Benito Cody grabbed his arms, while Lola Cody pulled his hair and clawed at his face with her manicured nails.It was like wrestling with two vast marshmallow mountains.Within minutes, theyd pulled him to the ground and Lola Cody sat on him.His breath was squashed out of him instantly.While she had Olly pinned to the floor, her husband scrabbled on the ground to retrieve the money.This was all going horribly wrong and he could see Nells money slipping away from him.Help, Olly gasped out.Help me.He didnt want to die in a dirty Miami alley being squashed by an extraordinarily fat woman.That wasnt how it was supposed to end.Then he heard the pounding of feet heading his way and Diego and Andrs appeared at the back of the car.They both grabbed Lola Cody and hauled her to her feet.Olly breathed again, gasping at the hot air.She was shrieking like a banshee and struggling against the grip of the strong mechanics.As his lungs were working again, Olly jumped to his feet and went to tackle the husband.Benito barged into him with his huge bulk and sent Olly flying.He was tempted to grab the baseball bat again from the car boot but, that way, danger lay.Benito Cody waddled away, picking up surprising speed and dodged back into the Home Mall offices.Get the money and get in the car, Diego shouted.Well hang onto her.Olly didnt have to be told twice.Thanks, he said, still panting.His chest hurt where Lola Cody had crushed his ribs.Thanks so much.He scooped the money up and dropped it back into the cardboard box and then into the boot of the car.Splitting one of the bundles, he gave Diego a wedge of money for them both.It could have been as much as five hundred dollars but, frankly, it was worth it for their help in getting out of this pickle.Who knew that these two fat felons would decide to bite back!Have a drink on me, Olly said.I appreciate your help.No need, man, Diego replied.But thanks.Lola Cody, still restrained, spat at him.Nice, Olly said.She spat again.That safe in there is stuffed full of money, guys.Fill your boots!Then, hurriedly, he slipped into the car.Give my love to the Queen, Andrs said.Olly turned the car in the alley and then started to pull away.In the rear view mirror he could see the two guys still holding Lola Cody firmly and she seemed to be spouting venomous abuse in his direction.Well, she could shout all she liked; he now had the money safely in the boot of his car.Then he saw that Benito Cody had reappeared from somewhere.The man was staggering towards the car, a deranged look in his eye.His arms were up, pointing forwards and, to his horror, Olly saw that Benito had a gun clasped in his hands.Instinctively, he ducked as the shot hit the back window of the rental car and shattered it into oblivion.He felt the bullet whistle past his ear.He touched his face.There was blood on it.In shock, he slowed down.Go, go, go, Diego shouted at Olly through the car window.Dont stop!Go!Get out of here.Another shot rang out and Olly flinched, but it didnt seem to connect with anything.Andrs let go of Lola Cody and Olly saw a monkey wrench travel through the air and knock the gun spinning from the hand of her husband.It skittered across the ground and Benito lunged for it.But Andrs was way too fast for him and kicked it out of harms reach.The mechanic was on top of Benito before Olly hit the end of the alley.His mind whirled.Should he stop, help them?But then he wasnt really sure he wanted to know what happened next.Christ, he was out of his depth here in this mean neighbourhood.It had turned violent so quickly.Hed had no idea that Benito Cody might produce a gun.His hands were shaking as he gripped the wheel, his knuckles white.Go!Diego shouted again.Well take care of it.So thats what Olly did.He floored the accelerator of his rental car and went.83      Ive heard nothing more from Olly since his one text message.Ive tried his phone over and over again, texted him and have even thrown words out into the universe.As yet, Ive heard nothing back.Petal is at nursery.Jen, who continues to be an unfaltering support, took her there this morning.The idea was that I would have some peace and quiet in which to work.All Ive done is drink coffee and stare at my screen in a trance.I can think of nothing but Olly and where he might be now.Until he comes back I am in complete limbo.Mid morning and the doorbell on the shop door chimes.Tod shakes the raindrops from his hair as he comes in.Is it raining?I say in the way that we British do.Summer shower, he says.It felt quite nice.I wonder if its raining where Olly is.Come up to the flat and Ill make some coffee.I dont want to disturb you.I sigh.Believe me, Tod, Im not doing anything but staring into space.Hard, eh?Like I couldnt have begun to imagine.Where did my previous life go when I had a happy boyfriend, a job that involved dolling out chips and smiling, and no worries?Tod probably doesnt even know that Olly has gone AWOL.Not working on any new designs?I dont like to tell him that I think my creativity has gone the same way as my money  down the pan.Lets take a ten minute tea break.Turning the closed sign on the door, I lead the way upstairs to the flat.My footsteps sound leaden.Tod wanders around the living room as I bang about with the kettle and cups.I even find the teapot.Thanks to Jen, we have an exciting supply of biscuits, and milk, and coffee, and sugar, and even nutritious vegetables in the fridge.What would I have done without her?Petal and I could well have starved.Putting some of the chocolate chip cookies my friend bought on a plate, I take a tray over to Tod.I sit on the sofa and he flops down next to me.Ive texted and texted you.I know.Im sorry I didnt reply.I sigh.I was in a bad place.I just wanted to come round and say that Im sorry.You already apologised, Tod, and I told you then that none of this is your doing.I pour us both tea and Tod takes a biscuit.Nursing my tea to me, I enjoy the feel of the cup burning against my hands.To feel something is better than feeling nothing.I still feel that I let you down, he says.I should have advised you better about the shopping channel contract.I had no idea it might be a scam.Me neither, I say.I think I just got caught up in the moment.I so wanted it to happen for you that maybe my normal rationalisation went out of the window.The same way that mine did.I dont blame you at all.This is, undoubtedly, all my own fault.You dont know what it means to me to hear you say that, Nell.Whod have thought that Tod Urban would ever need my approval?I thought you were blanking me out of your life.No, I say.Ive just been having some troubles.He brightens.So youre happy to continue working with me?There are still things we can do to turn this round.I shrug.The way things are going, Im not sure Im going to be able to continue to work at all.How do I explain to him that I care about nothing but getting Olly to come home?Im thinking of asking Phil to take me back in the chip shop.He wont do that, Tod says.He knows how much you have to offer.I dont tell him that Phil has already knocked me back on that front.Nor do I tell him that hes offered me the money to pay off the bank.You can still do great things, Nell.Dont lose that belief in yourself.Do I confide that actually remembering to breathe in and out is all that I can cope with at the moment?Is Olly OK with it?He purses his lips.I dont like to pry, but are things all right at home?The fact that my husband is currently absent makes me think not.I would say that pretty much shows that theyre not all right at all.I can keep this all to myself and pretend that Olly and I are fine, but what would that achieve?I decide to come clean.Ollys not around at the moment, I say.I dont know where he is.But you need him here.Yes, I do.Cant argue with that assessment.Has he left you?Tears burn behind my eyes.I didnt want to get into this with Tod, but my emotions are raw, rubbed open, and I havent the strength to hide them.Just pretending to Petal that everything is fine is taking all my energy.I dont know.He takes my hand.Im sorry to hear that, Nell.I had no idea that things were so bad.That makes two of us.Did he give you any reason?I shake my head, unsure of my voice.Then, I havent heard from him in days.What will you do if he doesnt come back?Wait.My mentor looks as if he doesnt think this is the best plan, but I cant think what else to do.If theres anything I can do to help, you must let me know.Tod clears his throat.This may well be inappropriate timing, but you know that I care more about you than simply being your mentor.Youre right, I say softly.This probably isnt the time.At any other time, any other place, with any other woman, Tod would be one hell of a catch.But Im not interested in anyone else but my husband.I wanted you to know that youre not alone in this.All you have to do is say the word and I can be here for you.Thats nice to know, Tod.Youre very kind.And youre still very much in love with Olly.Yes, I say.That just about sums it up for me.84      Olly drove back to the motel.Once inside, he locked the door and leaned against it, breathing heavily.The cardboard box full of money was in his hands, clasped against his chest.Blood dripped down the side of his neck and he put the box down on the bed and went straight into the bathroom before he added to the blood stain count already in the room.In the mirror, the one with the dim strip light above it, he examined his wound.It looked like the bullet had just grazed his ear and it had bled profusely.He pulled some toilet paper from the holder and dampened it in the cracked sink, then used it to wipe away the blood.Once it was cleaned up, it didnt look nearly so bad.A little nick; that was all it was.But if the bullet had travelled just an inch to the left, he might not be here to tell the tale.He might never have seen Nell or Petal ever again.The very thought of it made him shaky.He rinsed his face and dragged his fingers through his hair, hoping that it would make him look better.It didnt.Back in the bedroom and he changed his shirt, which was soaked with perspiration and dirty with his own blood.He threw it in the bin and then he tipped the rest of his possessions out of his holdall onto the bed.Suddenly he was grateful that he wouldnt have to spend another night in this room.He was going home.He was going home to his girls.The thought nearly had him undone.He upended the cardboard box and the money spilled out.Quickly, he counted the bundles, putting each of them into the bottom of his holdall as he did so.The money was all there, present and correct.Perhaps Diego and Andrs had gone in after theyd dealt with Lola Cody and her husband and had helped themselves to a bit of their cash  goodness only knows there was enough of it stashed in the Codys safe for them not to miss some.Olly wouldnt have blamed them if they had.In fact, part of him hoped that was exactly what his two saviours had done.He hoped that Diego had taken enough to start a new and better life with his darling daughter somewhere away from the hell hole of Opaville.The money just about fitted into his bag with room for a few toiletries and his dirty laundry on top.He zipped it up tight.No one was going to get this baby out of his hands.He looked round the room.If he never had to see another place like this in his entire life, then it would be too soon.Outside, he jumped back into the car  the car with no back window and shattered glass all over the rear seat.How was he going to explain this to the rental company?For now, that was the least of his problems.*  Six hours later and his plane was ready to taxi down the runway.Later tonight he would be in Heathrow and it couldnt come a moment sooner.It had cost him another bundle of dollars to book his ticket, but it was well worth the money.All he wanted to do now was leave this wretched place and get back on home turf.Get back to the ones he loved.The ones who loved him.The rental company had kept his deposit but it seemed a small price to pay for the damage inflicted on the car.Hed had to fill in a report too but, perhaps unsurprisingly, they didnt seem unduly fazed by the return of a shot up car.Maybe it was more common here than it was in Hertfordshire.On the plane, the air steward had insisted in prising the holdall filled with cash out of his fingers and putting it in the overhead locker for take off.Reluctantly, hed parted with it.There was no way he wanted it out of his sight for a second.It was his  his and Nells  and no one was going to take it from them again.Thankfully, hed got this far without Benito or Lola Cody chasing him, which had to be a good thing.Hed spent an anxious afternoon in the airport expecting them to come crashing through into the departure lounge at any moment, guns blazing  but they hadnt.Thankfully.Olly had checked the in flight entertainment.The films were all high action thrillers, shoot em up stories that were way too strong for the current state of his stomach.Hed opt for the Cartoon Channel instead and, with a restorative brandy, would look forward to nine hours of some of Petals favourites  Monsters Inc, Finding Nemo and Toy Story III.That should help relax him.The plane hurtled down the runway and lifted into the air.It swooped away over the sparkling sea, the golden beaches, and the art deco hotels of Miami.None of which hed seen.Perhaps one day hed come back here with Nell and Petal for a family holiday.But, then again, perhaps not.85      Jens phone beeps and she stops doing the Cinderella jigsaw with Petal and glances at the text which has just come in.Were all sitting on the floor of the living room and Petal is already bathed and ready for bed.Wow.Jen looks up, surprised.Ive got an offer of a date tonight.Now I tear my attention away from the cherry blossom tree that Im puzzling over.Good for you.The picture is of Cinders and her prince dancing together in an enchanted garden, bluebirds flitting round their heads, his magical, ten bedroom castle in the background.Just like real life, eh?Its only someone whos been coming into the pub for a while.She shrugs as if its of no consequence, but I can tell that shes excited.No big deal.Avoiding my eyes, she fiddles with the piece of unfeasibly blue sky in her hand.Thing is, Im not sure I want to leave you.To prove that Im perfectly fine, I give a little laugh.Youve been fantastic, Jen, I tell her.I dont know how Id have managed without you.But Im a big girl.I have to cope on my own some time.Im a big girl, too, Petal pipes up.You are, and we both think that Auntie Jen should go on her date, right?Yay!Petal shouts.Then, Can I come too?Maybe another time, Jenny says.She turns to me.Are you sure, Nell?I dont have to go.Of course you do, I insist.You should spend your night off doing something more interesting than Disney jigsaws.Petals face says that she cant imagine anything more interesting than Disney jigsaws.Besides, I cant keep you prisoner here for ever.Much as Id like to.The house has run like clockwork since my friend swooped in and took over.Its given me just the break that I needed, but now I ought to step back into my own life and do it myself again.Im certainly going to miss Jen though.Weve never enjoyed so many home cooked meals  half of them from Jen, the other half from Constance.Mind you, I think Ive put more than a few pounds back on because of it.The house will certainly seem quieter without Jen, and Petal adores her.I can see why Olly might have well lets just leave it at that.My thoughts wander again to my absent husband  not that hes ever far from them.If he doesnt come back to me, will I find myself going out on date nights with Jen?It doesnt bear thinking about.Jenny texts her date back to find out when and where theyre to meet.I should go home and get myself ready, she says.Youve got Cinderella to finish first, Petal points out.She kisses my daughter.Ill have to do that tomorrow, darling.Petal tuts.Now is not the time to point out that one day men will be a lot more important to her than her Cinderella jigsaws.But I hope that its a day thats a long time coming.Instead, I content myself with, Its your bedtime now, little lady.Kiss Jenny good night.Without protest, she does, then I kiss Jenny too and she shrugs on her jacket.Text me and let me know how you get on.Wish me luck, she says.You dont need it, I assure her.Youll be fabulous.As I watch her go, I do hope that Jenny finds herself a nice man.Its clear that all she wants is a home, a family of her own.Thats not a lot to ask for, is it?Bedtime, I remind Petal.Now.My chubby legged child pads through to my bedroom and climbs onto the bed.You could have your own room tonight, I point out.Jennys staying at her own house tonight.I like your bed, she says.I sigh.OK.But to be truthful, its nicer having Petal here rather than sleeping alone.She snuggles in under the duvet and demands, Story.A short one.I slide in beside her and read from a book called Fussy Freya, which we got out of the library last week.When is Daddy coming home?she asks sleepily.I dont know, sweet pea.Doesnt he love us any more?He adores you.See what I did there?That neat deflection?I have no idea if he adores Mummy any more is what I really mean.Then I wish hed come back.I can only have The Gruffalo when hes here.Daddys better at it than you.He is.I cant argue with that.Hes an excellent father.None better.Thats why his continued absence is all the more confusing.As Petal slips her thumb into her mouth and sinks into sleep, I think I might join her myself.The night is young, but Im not.I give in to a glorious yawn.I could force myself to stay awake and sit on the sofa watching rubbish television by myself, but whats the point?Might as well have an early night.Im curled up next to Petal, drifting in and out of sleep, when I hear a key in the front door.Dude barks and bounds out of the bedroom wagging his tail like a loon.Rousing myself, I glance at the clock.Not yet midnight.I thought Jenny wouldnt be back this evening.Perhaps her date didnt go as planned and she doesnt fancy spending the night alone.Slipping out of bed, I pull on my dressing gown.We can have a cuppa and a data download together about her evening before she goes to bed.Hopefully, that will make her feel better.In the living room, I flick on the light and then jump out of my skin.It isnt Jenny.It isnt Jenny at all.At the top of the stairs, theres a man standing there and, probably because Im disorientated with sleepiness, it takes me a minute to realise that its Olly.Hi, he says and the familiarity of his voice makes my heart contract.He drops the holdall hes carrying on the floor and, seconds later, were in each others arms.I hold him tightly, feeling that if I let go for even a moment, he might just disappear again.Where have you been?I ask as I smother him with kisses.Miami, he says as he smothers me back.That makes me pull away.Miami?What on earth have you been doing there?Olly sighs.Its a long story, he says.86      Olly whips open the holdall on the floor.He pulls out the dirty shirts and pants and socks, tossing them onto the carpet with abandon.Underneath it all is a whacking great pile of cash.I gasp out loud.Have you robbed a bank?This is straight from Lola Codys safe.More gasping.Its our money?!All of it, he says.Throwing my arms round him, I hug him again.You did that?For us?I couldnt let them get away with it, Nell.I couldnt have lived with myself, so I sold the Vespa, bought a ticket with the money, and went to stake out the offices of Home Mall.Hes sold the Vespa.Good grief, I know how much that scooter meant to him.I never thought hed consider parting with it.Pulling my dressing gown round me, I cuddle up next to him.For the next few days, I think Im going to be glued to his side  as Im sure Petal will be too.But why didnt you tell me?Why didnt you let me know where you were?Because you would have told me it was a bad idea.You would have wanted me to come straight back.He does have a point.Say you understand, Olly urges.I needed to do it without any distractions.I dont like to tell him that in doing it this way hes driven me to distraction.Ive been out of my mind with worry.Now you dont have to worry any more, he says.While we both sit on the floor and stare at the money, Olly fills me in on the details: the dreadful serial killer motel, the long days sitting in the rental car, the dodgy neighbourhood, the scuffle as he tried to leave, the two burly mechanics who came to his aid.Im just so filled with emotion that he would think to do this for us and I could also kill him for putting me through the agony of thinking that hed run off with another woman.But as I look at him I can see the hollows round his eyes, the tiredness there.His clothes are rumpled and he smells like a skunk.It doesnt look like hes been eating properly either.Theres a bad cut on his ear and I wonder if the unexpected fight as he left was more difficult than hes letting on.We could have done it together, Olly, I say.We couldnt.I had to do this alone.If it had gone wrong  Suddenly, his voice cracks and his words are thick with emotion.If something had happened, I couldnt have lived with myself.I wrap my arms round him tightly once more.But it didnt, I say.Youve come home safely to me.Were a family again.Thats all that matters, isnt it?Olly strokes.I nod, uncertain of my own voice.Im so pleased you got the money back, I whisper.Delighted.Thrilled.I let my fingers trace the contours of his face.But all I really wanted back was you.His lips find mine and there is nothing that has ever tasted sweeter.If Im kissing these lips for the rest of my life then Ill die a happy woman.Ollys body presses against mine and together we lie down on the carpet.He undoes the belt of my dressing gown and I shrug it off so that it becomes a blanket for us.In my haste to get my husband naked, my fingers fumble with the buttons of his shirt.I give up and help him to tug it over his head.His ribs are black with bruises and I trace the outline of them, wondering how these were caused.Olly stills my hand with his.Explanations later, he murmurs.He sinks on top of me once again.The door crashes open.Daddy!Petal cries.I thought I heard you.She launches herself across the room and barrels into him.He lets out an ouff as she crashes into his ribs.Olly envelops her in a bear hug.Have you missed me, Petalmeister?Yes, she says.Mummy isnt a very good daddy.Youre much better at it.Olly looks over at me and smiles.Im glad to hear it.I can see tears filling my husbands eyes as he holds our daughter close.You look completely worn out, I say, squeezing his arm.I am, he admits.Then lets go to bed.He raises a questioning eyebrow.All three of us, I confirm.Theres no way that wed get Petal back into her own room now that Olly has just returned home.So, with a wince, Olly picks Petal up and carries her through to our bedroom.We all slide under the duvet.Me on one side.Olly on the other.Petal slap bang in the middle.Dude slinks in and settles at the foot of the bed.Now go to sleep, Daddy, Petal instructs.Or youll be tired in the morning.Night, night.Sleep tight, Petalmeister.Tenderly, he tucks the duvet around her.Our daughter knees us both into position until shes comfortable.He winks at me over her head and mouths, I love you.Looks as if the passionate reunion will have to be put on hold.I grin to myself.But we will get it.87      Im panicking, panicking, panicking.Calm down, Olly says.He puts his hands on my shoulders and massages them.Everything will be fine.I try to breathe so that I dont hyperventilate.Have I remembered everything?I ask.Its too late now, Olly says.Its all about to kick off.Are you ready?Just need to slip on my dress.Better get a wiggle on, Mrs McNamara.Turning to face him, I give him a long, lingering kiss.Hmm, Olly says.What was that for?For making this possible, I say.For rescuing me from the depths of despair.Isnt that the duty of a husband?I smile at him.Then you execute your duties very well.This is my first show.My first proper show!Ive just taken a quick break from the madness to get myself ready.Weve managed to secure a small dressing room backstage, which, frankly, is little more than a cupboard but at least its away from the main fray.Three months have gone by since Olly returned from Miami with all of our money, safe and sound.Now were at the massive Fashion Frenzy design show in the heart of London.With some of the money that Olly got back from Lola Cody, I splashed out and organised a catwalk show to feature my handbags.I have a warehouse full of Nell McNamara bags that arrived from China several weeks ago and this is the start of our big push towards moving them.The handbags came out better than I could even have hoped and Im just praying that we get enough interest for it to be the first order of many.I also took some of the money and bought back Ollys cherished scooter without him knowing  which was, miraculously, still in the showroom window of Vroom.Ben sold it back to me for the price hed given Olly.I think he was just glad to see it returned to its rightful owner.Olly, it goes without saying, was beside himself with joy.I think its the least I could do after what he did to get our money back.The rest of the cash, of course, went straight to paying off the bank, to help cut my loan repayments.I tried to give some money back to Phil too, but he wouldnt hear of it.So thats where we stand now.Were still in debt, but not cripplingly so.What else can I tell you?Oh, we had an order from a highend French department store for our handbags.Theyd seen the scandal about Yves Simoneaux and Marie Monique in the trade magazines and fell in love with the products and decided to give them a trial.Its not a massive order, but its a start, and Im thrilled that something good has finally come of that whole episode.Of Yves or Marie, Ive heard or seen nothing since.Thank goodness.Id give her another good whacking if I did.And him.Seems as if theyve disappeared off the face of the earth, or at least crawled back into the hole that they came out of.Result!Also, Olly has managed to secure a couple of regular gigs in pubs in town, three nights a week, playing his beloved music, which will help to ease our cash flow situation as hell be bringing in some regular money.I wouldnt say that were exactly solvent, but we can, at least occasionally, veer out of the own brand aisle in the supermarket now.Tod also helped me secure some funding from The Arts Council to go towards the costs, so, whereas to come to this show would normally have cost me an arm and a leg, its just costing me an arm.You might have gathered from all my excitement that Ive finally found my mojo again.It might have taken a long time, but with Olly safely at home and things firmly back on track between us once more, my confidence gradually returned too.Following Tods advice, weve taken on a PR agency and theyve managed to get some of the bags to A list celebrities who were hoping will be papped while wearing them.The money that weve spent on the agency already seems to be paying dividends.Today alone, Ive done a dozen press and television interviews that they fixed up for me.Theyve also arranged for the editors of some of the biggest fashion magazines to be here in the audience today.One of the big, glossy lifestyle magazines has offered me a double page spread, featuring me in their entrepreneur and mother feature.Me!This is a brand new collection that were showing today and Im just head over heels in love with it and I hope that everyone else will be too.Ive gone retro Britpop, modinspired in a big way and the handbags are going to feature the Union Jack, the London Underground map, traditional red buses, and the iconic telephone box.The models will all be sporting sixties style clothes, plus some original vintage pieces Ive sourced from the market at home  our forte, I think  and Olly has dug deep into his record collection to take charge of the music for the event.If its a success, were planning to take the concept over to the New York, New Designers show next spring.Petals with us and because of the electric atmosphere, shes as hyper as if shed had two dozen bags of Haribo Starmix, and is racing round the room, bouncing off the walls and the ceiling.Ive given her a little role in the catwalk show and Im hoping that this is a good idea.Petalmeister, Olly says.Chill.But Im too upcited, Daddy!Come and sit on my knee for five minutes to calm down.You need to be ready for your big moment.Our daughter sighs her resignation to this plan and clambers onto Ollys knee where he grips her in a bear hug, which does look somewhat like a police approved restraint hold.I smile to myself.What will we do when shes fifteen?Then, just as I think I really must get changed, theres a knock on the door and Tod pops his head round it.Weve all just come to say good luck.Have you got time?Yes, of course.For my big day all the chip shop crew are here  the indispensible Jen, Constance and, of course, Phil.I wave them into the cramped space.Whatever happens in my life, Ill always have time for the most important people in my life.Without them, none of this would have been possible.Nell, love, Phil hugs me.It all looks great out there.Good.You lot seem as nervous as kittens.Theyre also all done up in their Sunday best.Tods been doing a great job keeping us all well topped up with champagne, Jen tells me.Soon well be feeling no pain.I laugh.Just dont drink so much that you nod off in the show.I want you wide awake and cheering loudly.You can rely on us for that, Phil assures me.Good luck, Nell, love.Ive got butterflies for you, Constance admits.Her hands flutter anxiously to her chest.Hey, I say, catching sight of the big sparkler on her finger.Whats all this?My friend flushes and glances over at Phil.We were going to tell you later, after the show.Youre engaged?Yes.They giggle in unison.Yesterday, Phil says.We came up to London early and I proposed.You dark horse!He grins shyly.Lets just say Id been planning it for a while.We didnt want a fuss though.A fuss you will have, I warn them.You must tell me all about it.I throw my arms around Constance and then Phil.Im delighted for you both.Nearly ready?Tod asks.I take a steadying breath.Just about.This is turning out to be quite a day.One more thing, Tod says.His grin says thats hes left the best until last.Ive just had a text from the office.He pauses to increase the suspense.Youre killing me, I tell him.Just spit it out.Lola and Benito Cody have been arrested for fraud.Looks like theres going to be a court case.The other businesses that lost their money now have a chance of getting it back and Mr and Mrs Cody could be looking at a custodial sentence.I want to slump to the floor with relief.Did you hear that, Olly?My husband nods his head.I did, but Im not sure that I believe it.Me neither, Tod says.Lets cross our fingers and hope that those guys get whats coming to them.Overjoyed, I hug Olly and then I hug Tod.I know that, in the background, Tod has been working away to bring this to fruition.Seems like his hard work may well have paid off.A woman with a clipboard and headphones puts her head round the door.Ten minutes, Ms McNamara.She disappears again.I have to get ready, I say to Tod.My models will be waiting for me to give the last minute once over to their outfits before the show kicks off.But Im going to make damn sure that I have a glass or two of champagne to celebrate that later.Well leave you in peace, Tod says, despite the mayhem thats about to break out around us.Thanks, Tod.I touch his arm and I hope that Olly doesnt see the fleeting look that travels between us.We have been through so much together and I have a lot to be grateful to this man for.He was right when he said that theres more between us than just mentor and student.We have a shared respect, a shared affection.Tod is a great bloke, no doubt, but hes not the man for me.I already have one of the best.Look after these guys for me, I tell Tod.You dont have to ask.He kisses my cheek and theres more hugging from Constance, Phil and Jen.See you later.Break a leg.When theyre all gone, I slip my outfit from its hanger.Im just about to undress, ready to put it on, when theres a tentative knock on the door.Shall I get them to see you after the show?Olly says.I shrug.Depends who it is, I guess.Olly opens the door for me and, standing there, is a glamorous woman.She says, Could I please have a word with Ms McNamara?Time is tight, Olly says.The shows about to start in a few minutes.I know.The woman sounds apologetic.But I have to leave straight afterwards and I wanted to catch Nell before the hordes descend.Im an agent, she says.I work for all the big stores  Harvey Nichols, Harrods.Id like to represent Nell.My names Sheryl Hallaway.Come in!Come in!I shout.Sheryl Hallaway is such a big noise in the fashion world that even Ive heard of her.This is someone that I definitely want on board.The immaculately groomed Sheryl Hallaway squeezes into my cupboard.Sorry about the surroundings, I say.Hello, Petal says.Youre a pretty lady.Sheryl laughs, kneels in front of my daughter, and says, So are you, darling.Whats your name?Petal.Shes adorable.Sheryl stands up and then to me, Im sorry to barge in on you when youre in a hurry, but I simply had to talk to you.She holds out a business card for me.Call me.Ive followed your work in the press and Id love to be involved in taking it to a whole new level.In fact, Id like to take you right to the top.Wow.Sheryl Hallaway wants me.Ill call you tomorrow.Good.Enjoy the show, Nell.Itll be the first of many.She shakes my hand, then Ollys, and leaves.Pinch me, Olly, I say.He wraps his arms around me.Youre not dreaming, he assures me.Its just the start of your dreams coming true.88      The woman with the clipboard appears again.Five minutes, Ms McNamara.Now Im really, really panicking.I grab my dress from its hanger.Can you give me a hand into it please, Olly?Sure.Olly holds it out and I wriggle into it.My outfit is very sixties; a sleeveless, Peter Pan collared shift dress in block colours  red, white and blue, naturally.Ive teamed it with white tights, navy flats and one of my Union Jack handbags.Its a dress Ive had for quite a while, but its one thats perfect for the occasion.A big navy bow and some original, chunky Bakelite bangles complete the outfit.Petal is, thankfully, already dressed.Shes wearing a similar pink shift with a white PVC sixties style cap covering her crazy hair.Ive made her a miniature handbag with the same Union Jack design on the front, but in pink and white.It also has extra sparkles on it as demanded by my darling daughter.Now shes parading up and down in the small space we have, practising the moves that Ive shown her.My goodness, this is a bit tight.I only tried this dress on a couple of weeks ago and it fitted perfectly.But whereas it previously skimmed my hips, it now has them in a vice like grip.Whats happened?Now I come to think of it, my boobs feel bigger too, and theres a definite bump where my flat tum used to be.Oh.Suddenly the penny drops.Perhaps all the sickness in China wasnt down to the change of water, the food, the jet lag, after all.Perhaps it was more to do with the wild night of passion that Olly and I had in the cottage in Cornwall.I cant even think when I last had a period.With everything else thats been going on, I havent had time to notice.I could very well be pregnant.My hands go to my tummy.Yep.Distinctly rounded.This isnt all down to Constances home made pies.How far gone must I be?Can it be as much as four months?Everything OK?Olly asks.Yes.I think so.I smile to myself.Now isnt the time to tell him.Ill break it to him when were alone, just me and Olly.Im sure hell be thrilled.My husband struggles with the zip, but finally Im in the snug fitting dress.I try not to let him see my contented smile.You look fantastic, he says.Thanks.Goodness only knows how well fit a new baby into our manic work schedule but well manage.Somehow weve coped with everything else thats been thrown at us.I cant see why a little addition to our family would be any different.The woman with the clipboard comes back one more time.One minute, Ms McNamara.I take a deep breath.Im done.Im as ready as Ill ever be.Lets go and see how those models are getting on.Backstage is manic.Racks of clothes are ready for the quick changes.Im relieved to see that the models are all dressed and that no one is squabbling.All the girls are in classic sixties dresses that have been individually made to reflect the handbag collection.Theyre all wearing sharply cut, bobbed wigs and heavy black eyeliner.I go along the first row of girls and check that their handbags are all in order.Each one is modelling a different Union Jack design.Looking good.Petal is, for once, speechless.Her mouth and eyes form wide circles as she takes everything in.Taking a peek out round the side of the black curtains, I can see that every chair in the place is full and I breathe a sigh of relief.Jen, Constance, Phil and Tod have prime seats in the front row.Right next to them are the fashion editors who could make or break my career.Betty is there, sipping from a glass of fizz and shes brought Chantelle Clarke with her whose presence is creating quite a stir.They both have my new Union Jack handbag and Im hoping that Chantelles makes the newspapers tomorrow.More than that, Im pleased that Betty and I are now firm friends again.Needless to say my handbags have pride of place in her shop window.Alongside Betty are students from the fashion and textiles course at my old college  the one I was at so briefly.I thought it would be nice to encourage some of the youngsters, give them a taste of what its really like, and sent along a bunch of free tickets.Id like to say that my old course tutor, Amelia Fallon, was here and that she now bitterly regrets how mean she was to me and she can see now that I was a unique talent and how she feels it was her turning down The Beatles moment.But, unfortunately, she didnt even have the courtesy to reply to my invitation.Seems as if she holds a grudge longer than I do.Close to my side, Olly slips his arms round my waist and asks, Ready, Nell?I turn and kiss him.Yes, I say.I am.Looking at the backstage manager, I give her the thumbs up.The lights go down.The music starts to pump out.The Self Preservation Society song from the fabulous film The Italian Job fills the auditorium.How appropriate.My heart pounds as the show begins.The models do me proud.They prance, preen and pout down the catwalk to rapturous applause.The quick changes go perfectly.For the second part of the show, the mellow sounds of Waterloo Sunset by The Kinks wash over the audience and the girls slink on in monochrome outfits, all with white knee high boots.For the finale, the girls switch into colourful psychedelic mini dresses and dance to The Rolling Stones and Shes Like a Rainbow.When the models have finished, they come to stand at the back of the stage.Even above the clapping, I can hear Phil, Constance and Jenny cheering.Always my staunchest supporters.But Im also pleased to see that the fashion editors, smiling broadly as they applaud, seem to like it too.This is my moment.In time honoured tradition, the designer takes to the runway at the end of the show.The curtains part and Im facing my audience.As one, they rise from their seats and give me a standing ovation.Listen to that, Nell, Olly says.They love you.I never expected this, I tell him.He squeezes my waist.Nothing more than you deserve.Lets say thank you.Tears in my eyes, I grab his hand and we walk down the catwalk, revelling in the applause.Then, as we stand together, the curtains open again and one of my favourite songs, The Monkees and Daydream Believer kicks out.This should be my theme tune.Olly couldnt have chosen better songs for us.The crowd cheer their approval as Petal, all kitted out in her sixties dress, wearing her miniature handbag at a jaunty angle, struts down the catwalk towards us.My daughter, hamming it up terribly, milks the moment for all its worth.With her short chubby legs, she mimics the models walks and then strikes a pose at the end of the runway.More cheering.Shes positively glowing.Olly and I exchange a glance and laugh.Our child is definitely a diva.Hand in hand, Olly and I join her.Judging by the response of the audience, Nell McNamara handbags are now firmly on the map.Believing in my daydreams has taken me down a rocky road.There have been incredible highs and terrible lows.But together, Petal, Olly and I have got through them.Despite all the tears, the trauma, the pain, I now know that I wouldnt have missed this crazy ride for anything.I look at my friends in the audience, my family beside me, and I know that its all been worth it.
