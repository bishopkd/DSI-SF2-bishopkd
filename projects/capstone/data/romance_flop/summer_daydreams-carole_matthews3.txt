Tod didnt seem to think it would be a problem at all.But we dont know if Tod  he mimics a girly voice.Not mine, I think!I might have mentioned Tod Urban quite a lot in the week since my excellent meeting with him, but I dont say his name like that  is talking about two hundred pounds or ten thousand.It makes a big difference to what we can do.Thats true enough.We should wait, Olly reiterates.Constance is coming to babysit.Im not a baby, Petal complains.Im four.Eat your beans, Petalmeister.Our daughter rolls her eyes at her father, but she pushes her fork into her baked beans.Weve got an hour before we have to be at work.I cant go looking like this.You look fine, I tell him.Sexy even.Hes weakening.I can see it in his frown.Where do we have to go?Im not exactly sure.Shall I call him?OK.Do it, Olly says, resigned.And sometimes I wonder where Petal has learned how to wheedle and whine from.I find the piece of paper that bears his number and punch it into my phone.The man answers in three rings and I ask him about his handbag frames and how much they are and, moments later, the deal, it seems, is done.Theyre mine, I tell Olly, hardly able to contain my excitement.Hurrah!My toe has been firmly dipped in the water of the fashion world.But we have to get them tonight.Hes clearing out the warehouse tomorrow.Olly gives me a reluctant smile.You drive a hard bargain, woman.Youd better phone Constance and ask her if she minds coming round a bit earlier.I do just that and my friend is here in a flash, wearing gold satin leggings and a leopard print top for her babysitting duties.Constance admires Ollys new look and then we both kiss our sitter and our daughter goodbye, dash out of the door and pile onto the Vespa.Where exactly are we going?Olly shouts out to me and I yell back the address.I hope this helmet doesnt ruin my hair.I have that problem all the time.Ill be more sympathetic in future!he offers and, with that, we drive off into the night.In less than fifteen minutes we find the small trading estate and pull up outside the equally small warehouse.Theres a man outside loading a van and Im guessing hes the person Ive come to see.He looks in surprise at the scooter as we climb off.I slip off my helmet.When Olly takes off his helmet and reveals his Maybelline look, the man takes a further step back.Im here about the bags, I say.In there.The man nods to the roll up door behind him and with him still keeping one eye suspiciously on Olly, we both follow him inside.On a rack at the side of the room the unfinished handbag shells are all lined up.They are the perfect shape.And there are lots of them.I feel myself gulp.All these?The man nods.Tell me youre not just on that scooter.Were just on that scooter.He shakes his head.Good luck.I count out the cash into his hands.That has made a serious dent in my college refund and I get a pang of anxiety as I see him pocket it.The man returns to loading his van and leaves us to the rows of handbag frames.Ollys eyes are wide.Youre kidding me.I brought black bin bags, I tell him.I thought we could put them in there.Theres got to be six dozen handbags there.A hundred, I say.There should be a hundred.This is going to take us at least three trips, Olly warns.We cant pile them all on the scooter in one go.Itll just fall over.But if we come backwards and forwards to get them in smaller batches then well never get to work on time.We wont if we hang about yapping, I say.So with a quick glance at each other, we launch into filling the black bin bags with them.I had no idea that a hundred handbag frames was quite so many.Or how many black sacks they would fill.Neither have I any idea where Im going to put them all when I get home.It takes us ages to bag them all up and, as Olly rightly predicted, we are both going to be so late for work.Still, we eventually load up the first lot.I have a black sack full of bag frames in each hand and Olly piles another load in front of me so that theyre sandwiched against his shoulders.Well be back for the rest soon, I tell the man.He gives me a look that reads incredulous.Ready?Olly asks.Yes.I feel decidedly unsteady.Dont go too fast.I just pray that we dont see a police car on the way home or were dead meat.Olly kicks the Vespa into life.Try to look inconspicuous, he shouts over his shoulder to me.Impossible.Im struggling to hold onto the bin bags and theyre flying out like wings into the night.I should have wide load stamped on my back.Woo hoo!I shout.Youre mad, Olly yells.I love you.I love you too!If this is what being a handbag designer feels like, then bring it on!20      Woaw!Olly says when he comes into the living room at the end of his late night punk gig.It looks like a sweatshop in here.Hes not far wrong.A week after we brought them home and the black bin bags filled with handbag shells are still stacked in the lounge awaiting a more permanent home, Im not sure where.I have all my trimmings and diamant bits and bobs spread out over the floor.My trusty glue gun is at hand.The ever reliable Phil lent me his posh camera and a few days ago I took some photographs of a beautiful, battered cod and some very cheeky chips nestling in newspaper.Today I picked them up from the printer who has transferred the images onto cotton for me.Despite the hour, I just had to make a start on them.How did the gig go?I ask.The landlord is still pissed off with me for being so late last week, Olly says as he pulls off his wig and roughs up his own hair.Thatd be the day we collected the handbag shells.Im trying to win him round again, but its a bit of an uphill struggle.Im sorry, I say.That was all my fault.It had to be done.Olly sighs, and then flops down on the sofa.I just wish there were more hours in the day.His lipstick is smeared, his mascara smudged.My heart squeezes for him.I wriggle along the floor with my work until Im sitting with my back against the sofa where hes flaked out.Itll be worth it, I promise him.Youll see.All this hard work wont last for ever.Well both be in an early grave if it does.Like his dad, are the words that are left unspoken.I know that the premature death of his father still sits heavy in Ollys heart and I can understand why he likes his life to be as laid back and as stress free as possible.But sometimes you have to let the past go and embrace the future, and I see a different future for us.I see one where Im sitting in the front row at Paris Fashion Week sipping a champagne cocktail and watching a catwalk show featuring my latest, hugely successful, collection with an immaculately dressed Olly and an impeccably behaved Petal at my side.I could kill for a Pot Noodle, Olly says, breaking into my fantasy.Any in the cupboard?Im sure there must be.Want me to look?No.Ill move myself in a minute.I just need to work up the enthusiasm.Olly strokes my hair while I cut and trim and sew and glue.Look.Ten minutes later, I hold up my first completed handbag.As its made from a bought and already finished shell, theres no diamant clasp, the lining material is silver rather than the hot pink of my dreams and the name tag Id envisaged in cool steel is a hand stitched, padded star instead, but its nearly there.The pukka article will have to come when we have some more cash behind us.Number one!Wow.Now he sits up.For real?Yeah.I think it looks good.Standing up, I parade the inaugural Nell McNamara signature Fish & Chip handbag round my front room.Think it will sell?Im no fashion expert, Olly admits.But I think it should go like hot cakes.I hope youre right.Hmm.He winds his arms round my thighs.I think such genius calls for a celebration.The look in his eyes says that he doesnt mean Pot Noodle for two.He slides off the sofa and pulls me to the floor with him.We lie down amid my fabric and trimmings and sparkles.Olly finds a tiny feather from somewhere in the heap of the mess and starts to tickle my face and neck with it.Then he moves lower and lower and lower.If we make love here, I warn him as my breath quickens, you might get a needle in your bottom.Ill risk it, Olly says.He kneels above me and peels off his God Save The Queen T shirt.Despite our advancing years, his body is still taut; his six pack  honed through years of karate practice  is still in place even though he has zero time to exercise any more.Mine, in contrast, shows the signs of childbirth and too many chocolate bars.God, youre beautiful, Olly says.As he leans in to kiss me, Im so glad that he never notices my flaws.Then, just as Im reaching for the buckle of his belt, the living room door flies open.Id like milk, Petal announces.Id like it now.Then remembering that nothing is forthcoming in this house without the p word she adds as an afterthought, Please.Olly groans before we both dissolve into fits of laughter.I dont know whats funny about that, our daughter complains.You forgot to give it to me before I went to bed, Mummy.I did not, Petal.Dont tell fibs or your nose will drop off.My child looks terminally unconcerned that this tragedy might befall her.But if you go straight back to bed, you can have a tiny bit.And a biscuit?No.No biscuit.Or your teeth will fall out.Not bovvered about that either.Olly hauls himself from the floor.Ill get it.Petal slides her hand into Ollys.I love you, Daddy, she smoothes and I can hear his heart turning to mush.I wonder if Petal is so determined to remain a cosseted only child that she hides behind doors all the time, just waiting for us to get down to it before she pounces.I dont suppose that were the only celibate couple, but it certainly feels like it sometimes.Passion thwarted once more, I turn my attention back to my handbags.Before this night is out, if Im not going to get any hot sex, then Im determined to have bags to sell!21      The next morning, I swing through the doors of Live and Let Fry for my shift, feeling as if Im walking on air.I come bearing gifts, I tell Phil, Constance and Jenny.After theyve all hugged me to death, I hold out my new Nell McNamara handbags complete with pink and white candy stripe protective dust covers.Jenny and Constance take them and pull out the bags inside.Oh, wow.Jens eyes are out on stalks.You seriously didnt make these?I seriously did.Nell, theyre fantastic.Phil, as he so often does these days, looks a bit teary.Fish and chips.He examines the handbag that Constance is holding.Thats funny.I didnt think that youd want one for yourself.Oh, I dont know.It might suit me.He takes Jens bag and models it.Arent man bags all the rage?Thanks for being my inspiration.I mean that sincerely.Phil returns the bag to Jen.Well done, girl, he says to me.Well done.Ive got to sell some yet, Phil.Tell me well done this time next year if Ive made it.I turn to Jen and Constance.In the meantime, ladies, you are my walking billboards.I want you to wear these as much as possible.We can keep them?they chorus.Absolutely.Thanks, Nell, Jen says.Youre a star.The door opens and our first customer of the day comes in.I hate to bring you all back to reality, Phil says, but aprons on.With some muttering, the girls reluctantly slide their handbags back into their protective covers and we all don our aprons and prepare for the lunchtime rush.Four hours of dishing out fish and chips and Im done.The apron is stripped off again and I dash out as quickly as I can as I have a meeting with Tod Urban.I cant wait to show him my finished product.Were meeting this time in a coffee shop and when I push, breathless through the door, hes already waiting.As always, he looks cool, calm and collected as he sips his cappuccino.I plonk myself down in the seat opposite him.Sorry, Im late, I puff.The entire population of Hitchin wanted fish and chips today.It took us ages to clean up afterwards and I could hardly just walk out and leave the others to it.You look tired, he notes.Late night too.I was cross eyed from sticking diamant sparkles on by two in the morning.Now I could actually put my head down on this table and fall fast asleep.Let me get you something, Tod says and he lifts his tall, lean frame out of the bucket chair.Tea, I say.Just tea will be fine.What I could really do with is a double espresso, but Im thinking it would just make me jittery and hyper.Cake would be good too.But Tod isnt the kind of guy that you want to stuff your face in front of.While he queues at the counter, I try to gather my thoughts and get out the Fish & Chips handbag that Ive brought to show him.Tod hands over my tea when he comes back and I show him the bag.Impressive, is his verdict as he turns it back and forth, examining every detail.Youve done a good job.Thanks.I feel ridiculously pleased when I get praise from Tod.I thought Id take it into Betty the Bag Lady this afternoon to see if shes interested in stocking them.Great idea.Ive found you a fantastic web designer for when youre ready to get that up and running.Im sure youll love his style and hes not too expensive.Always good to know.Then Tod looks serious.Some bad news though.Ive drawn a blank on the grants.Cutbacks, Im afraid.You know how it is.Everyone has used up their funding for this year.Oh.What am I going to make stock with?How can I get a website up and running?Ive spent all night making handbags.Now what am I going to do with them?Its not dead in the water, he assures me.There is money to be had.But its not worth applying again until next year.Thats months and months away.This is business, Tod tells me sagely as he sees my disappointment.You have to be prepared to take the knocks, Nell.Yes, yes.Of course.But my heart sinks nevertheless.Ill see you again soon.He finishes his coffee and so I glug down my tea.Chin up.Rome wasnt built in a day.But I just want to make handbags, I think, not build Rome.22      Im in Bettys and, once again, I pull out my new design.I feel like giving it a fanfare.A bit of ta da!After all the years of rocking up in here like the poor relation, now Im coming in here as a business colleague!Betty looks at me.I thought shed be grinning, perhaps even jumping up and down.But no.The expression on her face is puzzled, slightly put out even.She examines my handbag as if its an unexploded bomb.Do you like it?I ask, eager and nervous in equal measures.Wow, she says.I dont think her voice says wow though, it says something else.Something that I cant identify.Its very interesting.Interesting?Why is she making that sound like a bad thing?Amazing.She purses her lips.I had no idea that this is what you wanted to do.Neither did I until recently.Im trying not to bob about from foot to foot.She stares at me.Yet you never said anything?No.That stops me bobbing.She is put out.Does she see me as a rival now?Did she like it better when I was just a hard up customer drooling at the altar of her bags?I wouldnt exactly call Betty a bosom friend, but I thought that we were more than acquaintances and had enough of a connection for her to be pleased for me.This place has been an inspiration to me, I say.Its the hours Ive spent in here that finally made me realise what I want to do with my life.Really?Her stare turns to my bag again.She hates it, I can tell.Id love you to stock them.Im too excited to look at whats on offer today, but I know that my bags would sit perfectly among them.Perhaps just have the one, this one, to see how it goes.Betty looks shell shocked.Let me give it some thought, Nell, she says.Leave it with me.Right, I say.Right.Ill do that.Call in again next week and well sort something out.Im here on almost a daily basis.Was that a warning to stay away?See you next week then, I say and slink out.I stand on the street, stunned.What now?I was absolutely sure that Betty would go mad for my bags.I hate to admit that I had a window display in mind.A great one that shed keep for weeks and weeks to be admired and drooled over by the good folk of Hitchin.She knows me.She knows that I work in a chippy, that I have a small child dependent on me.Why would she not want to help me if she could, give me a leg up?I wander aimlessly, trying to get my head round her reaction.The markets on today and its bustling with life as usual.Some of the stall holders have been here for as long as I can remember and feel like old friends.The vintage stall that I love is here too and I flick through the racks of once loved clothes, but Im not really paying attention to the feel of the fabrics, the cut of the dresses as I normally do.Today my head is elsewhere.If I cant afford a website yet and Betty isnt going to stock the handbags for me, where can I possibly sell them?Theres nothing in the house for tea and we need to eat quickly as Im due back at Live and Let Fry before long, so I pick up three fresh homemade pasties from the stall adequately named, Mr Pasty.Then, as Im shoving my purchase into my bag, it dawns on me.I could have a stall here too.If I can get one on Saturday, Olly could have Petal during the day and I can ask Jenny or Constance if they would swap the lunchtime stint with me.Its an idea.I havent a clue how much it costs to get a market stall or what you have to do, but pretty soon I will.Take that, Betty.I may just have hit upon another way to get my handbags out there!23      A week later and I have a market stall.My first day is this coming Saturday and, frankly, Im bricking it.I told Olly before he went off to bed, but his response to my momentous decision was somewhat muted.He may have just been too tired to get excited.Or maybe hes just heard one too many momentous decisions from me recently.But I feel like I have no choice.I have to do something and its a relatively modest outlay to display my goods and it will, hopefully, bring in some money for me to reinvest in the business.Surrounded by handbags on my lounge floor, Im thinking of calling Tod to tell him  hoping that he will be more enthusiastic and raise my flagging spirits  when the phone rings.Petal, can you pick that up please.Im up to my eyeballs in glue guns and sparkles.Answer nicely.Hello, this is Mummys phone, she says politely.She is busy and she is still in her pyjamas.Quickly, I snatch the phone from her.Hello?Pyjamas, hey?Tod says with a laugh.Im so sorry, I tell him.My daughter is a receptionist of variable reliability.She sounds delightful.She is absolutely delightful.When she wants to be.Then, to distract him, I was just thinking of you.Same here.My awestruck heart does a little lurch.You were?The sound of his laughter again.I have some news.Id love to hear it but I cant talk now, Nell.This has to be a quick call.Im just going into a meeting.I do, however, have a proposition for you.Im infinitely open to propositions from Tod Urban, I think.I have a reception to go to tonight at Buckingham Palace and my date has let me down.Fancy it?B B Buckingham Palace, did you say?Its a promotion for The Princes Trust.It would be a great way to meet some influential people, which certainly wouldnt hurt if we were to apply to them for some funding for you.What do you say?Tonight?I can pick you up about five.That would give me just an hour to get home from my shift at Live and Let Fry and change into my glad rags.Id also need to find someone to cover my evening shift, which would mean that Id struggle for a babysitter for Petal as Olly has his punk disco gig tonight.Oh, God.Oh, God.What to do?You can tell me your news on the way down in the car, Tod continues.I have to fly.Are you up for it?Buckingham Palace!How can I possibly turn it down?Er  I need an answer now, Nell.Yes, I blurt out.Of course, yes.Great.See you at five.He hangs up.Now Im in a flat spin.I instantly phone Constance who, of course, agrees to cover my shift, but that puts my chief babysitter out of action.My second call, Jenny, is also working.So I then phone every friend Ive ever had to see if they would come round and look after Petal when Olly goes off to his gig.They are all busy with other things.It seems that I do not put enough into the babysitting circle to warrant taking anything out.Now what?Finishing off a handbag, I add extra diamants so that it will be ultra sparkly and ready for me to take to the palace tonight.No matter how many times I say that in my head, I cant convince myself that Im actually going there.I race upstairs and fling open my wardrobe to see if I have any suitable outfits for palace type events.Petal plods in behind me and promptly goes to the wardrobe to help herself to my shoes.Mummy is going to Buckingham Palace tonight, I tell her as I bounce round the room giving full reign to my excitement.Her raised eyebrow indicates a modicum of interest.She clacks about in my heels.Will you meet the Queen?I dont think so, but I might meet a Prince.Will you kiss him?I do hope not.Has she seen Prince Charles?My daughter looks disappointed by this turn of events and wonder exactly what Id have to do to impress her.I pull out a vintage Audrey Hepburn esque dress  black, sleeveless, full twirly skirt  and I cant even think when it last came out of the wardrobe.I hold it up against me and pose.The perfect accompaniment for a Fish & Chips handbag.Nice, Mummy.Can I come to the Palace too?That brings me down to earth with a bump.I sit down on the bed and pull my daughter into my arms and kiss her hair.No, sweet pea, I say.Its just for grown ups.Everythings for grown ups, Petal complains.Before you and I know it, you will be a grown up too.I hope youre not telling me a fib, she warns, or your nose will drop off.Im not, I promise.One minute youll be a little girl and the next youll be a big lady with a life of your own.So what will Daddy and me do while youre with the Prince?I dont know, sweet pea.But Ill have to sort something out pretty soon.24      Of course, Im pleased for you, Olly shouts.Im fresh out of the shower and in the bedroom getting ready for my posh night out.You dont seem it, I shout back.Rubbing the towel over me briskly, I squirt myself liberally with Chanel No 5  a very welcome Christmas present from my dear Dad every year, which I usually manage to eke out to last me the full twelve months.Im hoping it will hide any residual chip aroma.I want to make a big impression tonight and I dont want to do it with a lingering scent of haddock.It would just have been handy to have had more notice.Thats the way the cookie crumbles, I point out.The reception is tonight.Tod asked me to go this morning.What am I supposed to do?More importantly, Nell, what am I supposed to do?He lowers his voice, but the anger is still there.What am I going to do with Petal?I dont know, I admit.I tried everyone I could think of.No one was free to babysit.Then maybe you should have said no to Tod.He uses the whiny voice he does whenever he says Tod.Tod  no whining  told me it was very important for me to be there.I happen to agree.This is a once in a lifetime opportunity.The straighteners get a cursory tug through my hair before I twist it up into a chignon.I add a big black bow to the back.I cant ever remember seeing Olly so cross with me before and I dont understand what the issue is.I have to do this.Does he not see that?Phone in sick, I say.Its the only thing to do.How can I?Olly asks.Im hanging on there by a thread after being late the other week.I dont want to lose this gig and I cant let other people down at the last minute.It may not be the O2 arena, but a lot of people turn up on punk night.This is Buckingham Palace, Olly.The Princes Trust.If I get some funding from them, maybe you wont have to spend your evenings doing punk discos.Ever think of that?I dont think punk and disco go in the same sentence, Nell, he retorts before he continues with his rant.You just cant dump everything at the drop of a hat.Not when you have a family to consider.Its the first time Ive ever had to do this.Dont give me a hard time about it.Goodness only knows I feel bad enough already.But this is business.Can you see entrepreneur Karren Brady or Ultimo bra lady, Michelle Mone, turning down an invitation to the Palace?But then I bet they both have nannies to fall back on and that their husbands dont have to do two bit discos for the princely sum of fifty quid a night.I pull on my dress and turn to offer the zip to Olly.He zips me up, but rather crisply.Slipping on black velvet gloves that were my mums and black patent kitten heels at the same time, I check myself in the mirror.Suddenly, Olly is still.All the fight goes out of him.You look sensational, he says softly.Thanks.Now I feel ashamed for shouting.For the first time in my life Im torn between duty and ambition.A car pulls up outside the house and I hear the hoot of a horn.This is more than likely my ride.Go on, Olly says.Have a wonderful time.Perhaps its also due to the fact that Im driving off into the night with a rather fabulous man to a rather fabulous do.Im sure Id feel put out if the boot was on the other foot.What about Petal?Ill sort something out, he says.Dont you worry.Just go and knock them dead for the team.Ill try to.I go and kiss him.This is all for us, you know.Sometimes I have to remind myself of that, he says.Petal comes in, the cartoon on television babysitter clearly having finished its shift.Were you shouting at Daddy?Ah.Id hoped the noise of the telly might cover that.No, I tell her.I flash a glance at Olly.We were just having a grown up talk.Well, you were making too much noise.I kneel in front of Petal.Mummys going out now.Give me a kiss.My daughter hugs me and I have the urge to never let her go.I dont know how late Ill be, I say to Olly.This feels weird because I could count on one hand the amount of times Ive been out in the evening without Olly in the last five years.He comes and winds his arms round my waist.Ill be here, Olly says.Whatever time it is.You know that.Tod toots his horn again.I pick up my handbag and blowing a kiss over my shoulder, I rush out of the door.25      We speed down to London in Tods car.I dont think Ive ever been in a vehicle so plush.I have no idea what it is, but the soft leather seats mould around you and it whooshes when every other car Ive ever been in rattles.Theres some sort of soft jazzy music on the stereo, which isnt really my kind of thing, but tonight it hits the spot.If there was a drinks cabinet in here with a bottle of chilled white wine in it, I would be in seventh heaven.I sink back into my seat with a shuddering sigh.Nervous?Tod asks.Terrified.Ive never been to anything like this before and dont know what to expect.No need to be.Youll be fine.The Princes Trust has helped hundreds of businesses just like yours get off the ground.Plus, I hope were going to make some important contacts tonight.All you need to do is be charming and keep your fingers crossed.He casts a glance at me.Loving the look, by the way.Thanks.Tod doesnt look too shabby himself.Hes wearing a dinner jacket with a Nehru collar and it has a dragon embroidered in black thread on one side.Out of the blue, I think that we fit well together.Discomfited, I wonder where that thought came from.What was your news?Oh.In the excitement Id forgotten all about that.Ive organised myself a market stall.I start next week.It hardly feels groundbreaking now that Ive said it out loud.That is good news, he says with a smile.Well done.Great initiative, Nell.I love the way that Tod is always so encouraging.I dont, however, tell him that I was spurred onto it because of the lack of enthusiasm from Betty.Ill give you any help that I can.It feels good to know that Tod has got my back.Before long, we sweep up the broad expanse of The Mall and the magnificence of Buckingham Palace looms ahead of us.My knees start to tremble.Tod parks up in a side street and then, casually, takes my arm as we walk the short distance to the imposing gates of the palace.Were stopped at the gates by armed policemen and Tod shows our invitation.Were waved in and we follow the rest of the guests heading towards the Grand Entrance.There are footmen in red and gold livery to show us the way.We enter a large quadrangle and make our way across and up the red carpeted stairs and into the palace itself.My grip on Tods arm tightens.OK?I take a deep breath.A bit wobbly.Youre doing fine.He puts his hand on top of mine.Were shown into an impressive hall decorated in white and gold with red carpet.This is quite the most sumptuous room that Ive ever seen.Its thronging with people and is babbling with welcome noise.They all look like they know what theyre doing, whereas I dont.When were offered champagne by a liveried butler, I take one and try to sip it demurely while resisting the urge to knock it back in one.Tod, probably quite wisely, sips an orange juice.Theres a clap of hands.Ladies and gentlemen, a man says.Please make your way to the ballroom.Were escorted up a stunning staircase decked with enormous, sparkling chandeliers and into a long gallery that has a high, glass ceiling and is lined with pictures of past royalty.The excitement inside me is rising to fever pitch and I dont know how I manage to keep myself walking beside Tod at a sedate pace.It opens into a vast ballroom hung with dazzling chandeliers.At one end is a canopy of red velvet drapes embroidered with gold, beneath which are the thrones for the Queen and Prince Philip.The walls are lined with tables, laden with trays of canaps and fabulous flower arrangements.Music wafts from the gallery at the other end, provided by a string quartet.This is the room where they hold the Investiture ceremonies, Tod whispers to me.I dont think Im ever likely to get a knighthood so this may be my only ever chance to be in this room.Impressive, eh?Mind numbing, speech robbing, breathtaking.Oh, yes, I finally manage.I notice that Prince Charles is in the middle of the crowd and Ive only ever seen him on the telly before.Ive never even seen a member of the royal family in the flesh, let alone been in the same room as any of them.I get a star struck head rush.Wow, I breathe.Lets work the room, Tod says.Well see if we can get nearer to the Prince later.Still clinging to him, I trail in his wake as he approaches people we dont even know and introduces us.As the night wears on and the champagne starts to loosen my tongue, I find myself talking to other people who are just like me and have been helped by The Princes Trust to start their own business.I meet a woman who runs a small tea room, a young man with his own landscape gardening business and someone who designs funky stationery.I even find myself talking to the Ambassador for Nigeria about diamant sparkles of all things.Tod introduces me to a woman called Della, who I have a real laugh with as I tell her all about my business.She asks me to send her a sample handbag and slips me a business card.Shes from a PR agency, but Ive never heard of it.They are all suitably impressed with my handbag.Just as the evening is drawing to a close and my jaw is aching from smiling and my head is spinning from too much champagne, one of the footmen approaches us and ushers us towards Prince Charles.We stand in a short line and then Im presented to His Royal Highness.I have no idea what he says or what I say back, but I shake his hand and I think I curtsy, even though Im not sure if Im supposed to.Before I have the chance to do anything else, Im whisked away again.Did that really happen?I ask Tod.Feel good?I feel fabulous, I tell him.Thank you so much for bringing me.My pleasure, he says.I leave the palace and the Prince behind me, walking on air.26      The small club where Olly did his punk gigs was painted primarily in black.Its dark in here, Daddy, Petal said.Dont worry, sweet pea.Ill put the lights on.Against what every fibre of his being was telling him, hed brought Petal along to his gig tonight.What else could he do?Nell said that shed trawled round their friends to try to find a babysitter and, just in case shed missed anyone, hed tried them all again.She was right.He flicked on the lights that, to be quite honest, just made the place look seedier.His daughter wrinkled her perfect nose.Its only for a few hours until Daddy has finished work and then we can go home.Will you promise me that youll be a good girl?Petal nodded, her butter wouldnt melt in her mouth face firmly in place.He had already dressed her in her favourite little pink pyjamas and she was swaddled against the night air in her matching fluffy dressing gown.Shed sat quietly in the taxi hed had to call.Unfortunately, Petal wasnt quite old enough yet to go on the back of the Vespa.I want you to sit under here and be really, really quiet.Beneath the mixing desk was a large, vacant space.Just perfect for hiding a small child.He pushed away the thought that this was a really stupid idea.No one must know that youre here, he whispered.It will be our special secret.Mummy says that you shouldnt have secrets, Petal expounded.Its naughty.Shes right, Olly agreed.Absolutely right.Usually.But this is an extra special secret for one night only.His child didnt look convinced.We can tell Mummy, he assured her.Just not anyone here.She looked moderately appeased.I want you to slide under here.Ive brought Dudes bed.But where will Dude sleep?Ive left him his cushion.Hell be fine.The minute we get home, Dude can have his bed back.He placed it under the desk and hurried on.Your favourite blanky is in there and I want you to keep yourself nice and snuggly.Can you do that?Petal sucked her thumb and nodded.Good girl.Thats great.He kissed her smooth, warm cheek.Youre Daddys big girl.He could kill Nell for putting him in this position.If hed have thought quite how awful this would be, he should have asked if Phil would have minded Petal being at the chip shop for a couple of hours.That would be better than this.As it was, Constance was on standby to come to the house in case Nell wasnt back in time for him to go on his night shift.But it was too late to be thinking like that now  the place was about to open up and he was due to start in five minutes.No time to dash Petal off to Live and Let Fry before kick off.It was unusual that he hadnt seen the owner, Jimmy, yet and he was thankful for small mercies.No doubt hed be putting in an appearance soon.He normally opened up, cleared off into the back room for the duration of the evening, and then put his face out again at closing time.For someone who ran a music venue, he didnt seem all that keen on it.You need to settle in there now, Olly said to Petal.People will be arriving in a minute.Dont want to, Petal said.Remember what we agreed?She nodded.Its just for a short while and you have to be as quiet as a mouse.Its like a little game.That brightened her face up considerably and he hated the fact that he was doing this.Petal slid under the desk and climbed into Dudes bed.Comfy?It was fair to say that his child didnt look impressed.Ive brought these and when the music starts you must put them straight on.I dont want to wear my ear muffins, she complained.Ear muffs.I had them when I was a baby.The music will be very loud.And some of the lyrics very ripe.Theyll help to protect your ears.Petal put on the pink piggy ear muffs.God, she looked adorable enough to eat.Every time he looked at his child his heart contracted with love  though she was currently looking back at him with something bordering on contempt.Ive brought some colouring books and pencils for you.He handed them over.Happy?She shrugged her indifference.Daddy   Yes, sweet pea?I need a wee wee.Not now, Petal, he said.You went just before you came out.I do need one.I cant hold it in.A sigh.All right, all right, he said.Quick, quick.Come out.She clambered out from beneath the desk and he scooped her up and rushed her towards the loos.The gents was definitely a no no and he just hoped that the ladies was considerably cleaner and with less lurid graffiti.Thankfully, it was.Can you manage?Im not a baby, Petal insisted.It was a recurrent complaint.He waited outside the cubicle while his daughter seemed to take ages doing what she needed to do.Hurry up, Petal!You cant hurry up wee wee, Daddy!Voice indignant.It comes when it has to come.Why did women always take so long in toilets?It seemed that it started at a very young age.Finished!she trumpeted eventually, and he rushed her back to the safety of the mixing desk.Hed settled her with her books and piggy ear muffs just as Jimmy appeared.All right, Olly?Yeah, mate.Good.All set for tonight?Yeah.He was willing Petal to keep quiet and not pop her inquisitive little head out to see who it was.Lets get the punters in, then.Jimmy wandered off to open the door.Three hours.Thats all he needed to get through.Just three hours.Then he and Petal would be home and dry.Two hours in and all had been going quite well.Relatively.The dance floor had been jumping  or, more accurately, pogoing  with punk throwbacks enjoying tracks by Stiff Little Fingers, The Damned, Dead Kennedys and the obligatory Sex Pistols.If he played this stuff for long enough, he might even begin to like it  even though it couldnt compare to the likes of The Kinks, The Who and The almighty Beatles.Petal had stayed in the hidey hole, reading books and giving him an angelic smile every time he bent down to wave at her.Shed even kept her ear muffs in place and although shed kept up a constant stream of chatter while she coloured in her books, it was completely inaudible above the rest of the noise.Now, unfortunately, she was getting restless.As the club was getting warmer, shed kicked off her blanket and now the dressing gown had been tugged off too.It was difficult trying to keep a close eye on her as he mixed the tracks.He had hoped, in vain, that she might have been so tired by now that shed have nodded off to sleep.No such luck.Daddy!Petal tugged at his trouser leg.Da dee!Olly crouched down.What, Petalmeister?Just be a good girl for a little bit longer.But Daddy, Im bored.She rolled her eyes to prove just how bored she really was.He couldnt help but smile.Im nearly done.Then we can go home and you can have a lovely treat for being so good.What?He racked his brains.Ice cream?Play me a song.Now?I cant do that, sweet pea.Glee, she said.I want Glee.Her face said, Ive listened to this crap all night; youd better come up with it.I havent got any Glee.The song that was her very favourite was Dont Stop Believing.Its in your box, Daddy, his daughter informed him.I put it there.Really?His heart sank.How could a child of his loins possibly have such awful taste in music?He rummaged in his bag and, sure enough, Petals favourite Glee CD was safely secreted in here.Petal smiled smugly at him.It wont work in here.Her expression said, liar.I cant, Petal.Now wed moved on to, If you loved me   He could feel himself weakening.OK, OK, he said to her, holding up his hands in resignation.Then you promise to be a good girl until we go home?Yes.The nod was adamant.Olly sighed to himself.For one night only, a break with tradition.A little lady has specially requested this tune, so bear with me for three minutes.For better, for worse, he put on the cast of Glee singing Dont Stop Believing.It seemed that most of the stunned audience couldnt begin to believe it.They began to jeer as Petal sang along happily under the desk.They were barely into the chorus when Jimmy burst through the door at the back.What the hell are you doing?he demanded.It seemed that he did listen, after all.Ill take it off, Olly promised.Are you taking the fucking piss?Right now.Its off.Its off now.And the cast of Glee screeched to a premature halt.The audience cheered.It was then that Petal decided to pop her head out.Hello.Jimmy looked at her open mouthed.Finish tonight, he snapped.There was froth forming at the corners of his mouth.Dont come back.Ever.This isnt a bloody crche.Hes not a nice man, Petal observed as Jimmy stomped away.No, Olly said.But it was only fair to admit that he had a point.27      We cant go straight home, Tod says.The night is still young.Unfortunately, Im not.Already Ive gone from feeling like I could swing round all the lamp posts in the style of Gene Kelly to yawning my head off.This must be what it feels like to come down from a drug high.Ill swear I could lie down and sleep for a week.Were still arm in arm walking back towards Tods car.Lets go for a nightcap.I dont want any more booze.I hold up a hand.I have drunk deeply at the cup of the Princes hospitality.And why not?Tod laughs.Its not every day you get the chance to do that.No.However, all I really want to do now is go straight home to Olly and Petal and tell them all about my evening and how I would have loved them to be there.But Tod has been so good that I dont want to put a dampener on his mood.Lets have coffee, then, he suggests.Ill take you home, fit and sober.I cant argue with that.Sounds good.Tod finds a swish hotel nearby and we settle ourselves into the lounge as he orders coffee for both of us.Ordinarily, I would have been blown away by this place, but Ive just come from Buckingham Palace and it would take an awful lot to beat that.I sink back into the plush sofa with a happy sigh.Tod sits next to me, close, and rests his arm across the back of the cushion.You did really well, he says.You impressed an important contact tonight.I did?That yawn escapes again.The woman from Prestige PR, he says.Youve never heard of them?No.Della Jewel is a player.Youve got her card?Yes.Safely in my handbag, along with a dozen others.Send her a sample bag tomorrow.Dont forget.I promise that I wont.You will not believe whose hands she can get them into.Shes one well connected lady.You did well to charm her.I just had a good laugh with her.She was a lot of fun.If Id known how important she was Id probably have clammed up completely.The coffee appears and as we drink it, my eyes grow heavier.You look like you should be tucked up in bed, Tod says, and theres a twinkle in his eye.I feel myself flush.Is he flirting with me?This is the first time in years that Ive been alone with a man who isnt Olly and Im suddenly very conscious of it.I should go home now, I say.Drink up, Tod instructs, with what may be a rueful smile.Your carriage awaits.A short while later and were whizzing up the motorway.The traffic is much lighter on the journey home and soon we take the turn off to Hitchin.Not much longer and we pull up outside my house.How very scruffy and small it looks after what Ive seen tonight.I realise that I have a severe case of palace envy.Its late but theres still a light on.Olly should be home from his punk gig and getting ready to go on his night shift.Im glad that Ive caught him before he leaves.Tod and I sit there under the orange glow of the street light.Well, Tod says.Ill wish you good night.Good night.See you next week.I gather my handbag to me.Thanks so much for everything.Ive really enjoyed it.Thanks for being the perfect guest.Tod leans towards me.He tilts my chin with his finger and then softly kisses me on the lips.And, at that, I bolt out of the car.28      On the Saturday after my trip to Buckingham Palace, I make my debut at Hitchin market.Id like to say that its much anticipated, and it is  but only by me.My hedonistic night out with Tod and member of our royal family is a fast receding memory.It was very, very pleasant but it doesnt actually feel like it happened to me any more.The only part that is permanently seared in my brain is my kiss with Tod.Whatever happens, whatever future work events that we have to go to, that must never, ever be repeated again.Im a woman in a long term, committed relationship, for heavens sake.A mother of one particularly exuberant four year old.What on earth was I thinking?But, in truth, I wasnt thinking.I was caught up in the moment and I wasnt thinking at all.That doesnt make me feel any less guilty though.Still, I have enough on my mind today to keep me occupied and stop me from dwelling on it.Its pouring down with rain when we set up the market stall and it doesnt look like it will stop for the entire day.The sky is dark and sagging with grey, water laden clouds.A cold wind swirls round my feet and even my faux vintage army boots  twenty quid from Shoe Zone  cant keep it out.Forget fairy tale parties at palaces and softly stolen kisses.This is more like my version of reality.Everyone else is unloading vans but as we dont have a car, Olly and I lugged our stock up here in bin bags first thing this morning  after his night shift and before he went to bed.Even Petal was loaded up.If we can train Dude to pull a sledge, then we might well do so.Good luck, Olly says and gives me a peck on the cheek.Things are a bit cool between us and I know that he blames me for losing his punk gig, which despite insisting he hated it, I think he quite misses.We both miss the money, thats for sure.Ive spent half of the night wide awake and making stock and now have about thirty handbags to display.Theres a handful of Fish & Chips bags and some of the Eat Me/Drink Me ones.My new design features the Sindy doll in a silver frame with a view of Buckingham Palace behind her.Im sure you can guess what inspired that one.But as I put them out, I realise that there probably isnt enough choice to fill a stall.Ive got plenty of designs knocking around in my skull, but its the time and the cash that I lack to bring them all to fruition.Hopefully today will give me some more money to play with.Ive done my best to dress the stall and have made candystripe curtains to brighten up the framework and Ive hung some multi coloured bunting across the front, which I spent half the night making.Ive got big glass jars that Ive filled with colourful sweets and there are swirly lollipops sticking out of the top.Ive covered cardboard boxes of differing sizes with bright wrapping paper so that I can display the bags at a variety of heights.Petal is currently eating my decorations, dipping her chubby fingers into the jars of sweets.No more, I say.Youll be sick.I wont, she assures me.Well, no more or you wont eat your dinner.My child huffs.Mummy, thats hours away.Im opposite a fruit and veg stall and the man is already bellowing at the top of his voice, despite there being a mere handful of shoppers braving the elements.POUND A BOWL, LADIES!POUND A BOWL!GET YOUR APPLES HERE.POUND A BOWL!My daughter studies him, open mouthed.The price labels on my handbags read sixty five pounds and I wonder nervously if they are going to be too steep for my audience.HANDBAGS!Petal shouts, making me jump.GET A HANDBAG!Shush, I say.Hes shouting!Petal points to the fruit and veg man with indignation.So he is.I dont want you to shout.Its not what little girls do.Petal pulls her get a life face.Just be good, Petal.Mummy has to concentrate on work.But nothings happening.Which is also true.People are looking with interest at my handbags as they pass.One or two have even been brave enough to pick them up and examine them.Theyve taken my sweets.Theyve listened to my patter.Theyve all cooed over the bags and have told me how witty they are and how theyre great fun and how someone they know would love one.But not a single soul has bought one.By lunchtime, Im completely demoralised and starving hungry.The shouting from the man on the fruit and veg stall has started to punch a hole in my brain and Im still no nearer to making my fortune from handbags.At this rate, Im not even going to cover the cost of my stall.My hunger is not helped by the fact that Im just a few metres down from a stall selling Chinese takeaway and the delicious smell has been drifting towards me all morning.Want some Chinese food, Petal?
