Would you like to keep it?"She nodded her head, opening the parasol up and began twirling it around.I tousled her hair with my hand and pulled back the covers."It's time for you to get some sleep now.We have a lot to do tomorrow, Cassandra. "She slipped under the blanket, swimming beneath the covers."So youre going into town for my teaching curriculum?"I tilted my head in affirmation.It disturbed me that she couldnt return to school.It was so unhealthy for her to be held captive by this house.Cassandra needed other children to play with.My niece was so lonely she had created an imaginary playmate    or so I thought.* * *  The following day I took Nathaniel's sedan into Maryvale to register Cassandra and pickup her fourth grade curriculum.After leaving the Elementary School, I noticed a library at the far end of the Main Street.After putting the books and supplies in the trunk, I strolled down to the library to check out something to read.The November afternoon was bleak with oppressive gray clouds forecasting a storm on the horizon.The library was a small and quaint building on the thoroughfare.An elderly woman had me fill out the registration and handed me a card in exchange.I sat down with a sigh, attempting to collect my thoughts.The events from the previous night came to mind: the candy striped parasol and the mysterious man on the beach.It was apparent that Cassandra did not see him from her window.And I was not in the habit of imagining things, so what could this man be?Being a logical minded woman, I did not believe in the phenomena of ghosts.Once you are dead, I believed you were gone.Of course there was that ability I had for seeing the past belonging to people and objects.That was something most others couldnt understand.And yet did it have a name?I asked the librarian for the section on psychic phenomena.After almost an hour of pouring over reference books I discovered the name for my supernatural gift.It was psychometry."Psychometry is a form of extra sensory perception characterized by the ability to make relevant associations from an object of unknown history by making physical contact with that object.Supporters assert that an object may have an energy field that transfers knowledge regarding the object's history.Psychometry and psychic detectives were used by law enforcement agencies on specific cases. "I remembered reading about Profilers who assisted the police in specialized cases.Perhaps I had missed my calling in life.I could have been a psychic Nancy Drew.I returned the reference book to the shelf and began searching for an unfinished novel I had begun reading in Monterey.It was a historical work of fiction titled "Diamante's Castle".They didnt have the book in their catalog, so I searched for something else by the same author.They had a gothic romance she had written called The Lost Nightingale on the shelf.What drew me to this particular book was the picture on the cover.It featured two lovers standing on a windswept cliff overlooking a stormy sea.It reminded me of my vision with Jordan holding me on the cliffs of Eternity Bay.I glanced at my watch and noticed it was almost two.I was famished and needed to get back to Cassandra.I quickly checked out the novel and hastily made my way back to the car.It had already begun to sprinkle as I shut the door.There was a flash of lightning on the horizon followed by the rumble of distant thunder.It didnt look like I would be meeting with Jordan this evening.I hope he would understand.* * *  "What took you so long?"Cassandra scolded me.I held up the novel from the library."Sorry about that. "I apologized, "I was looking for a book that I left back home and found another one by the same author. ""Here, let me see. "she said anxiously taking the book from my hands.It was apparent that Cassandra was more interested in my novel than in the curriculum that I laid on her bedside table."This looks interesting, Aunt Laura. "She turned to look at me with imploring eyes."Can you read this to me?""No," I answered resolutely."You're too young for love stories, Cassandra. ""No I'm not," she maintained, "Devon tells me that he loves me all the time.And I love him too. "Then with an air of defiance she added."We've even kissed!"I wasn't sure how to respond to this."Now how can someone kiss a ghost?"I speculated out loud."Wouldn't your lips go right through him?"Cassandra shook her head."I can feel him touch me. "Then my thoughts drifted back to last night when I felt Jordan touch my shoulder, and when he took my hand.I looked back at Cassandra and lifted my eyebrow."And where did he touch you?"Cassandra blushed."Oh its nothing like that, Aunt Laura.We play games together.But one time he really did kiss me here. "She pointed to a spot on her forehead."So you said that you love him, Cassandra.Do you know what that means?""It's like this. "she said holding my book up in front of me."Two people together, protecting each other from the outside world. ""I'm still not going to read you that book. "I repeated."Oh, come on, Aunt Laura.I'm almost ten years old.Devon told me he would marry me someday. "I smiled at this."Now how could a human being, such as yourself become wed to a spirit?""I don't see why not.Grandmother always says that opposites attract, and that we should not dislike people because they are different from us. "I raised my hands up in futility."I see there's nothing I can say that will change your mind. "My niece grinned triumphantly, so I let it go for the time being.But I wondered where she was getting these fanciful ideas of romance.Her grandmother did not have Internet or a television, so she could not be watching any movies.Cassandra must be sneaking books from the reading room downstairs.This gave me an idea."I'll make you a deal, Cassandra.Next time I'm in town, I will find a book for you that we can read together.But first, we need to spend some time studying. "She looked quietly at the books on her bedside table in thought, and then turned to me."You got me, Aunt Laura. "she availed."When will you return to the library?"I searched her pleading eyes."Tomorrow, weather permitting. "* * *  Tomorrow the sky had cleared and the sun appeared.My introspection returned again to Jordan.Had he waited for me in the moonlight on the solitary shore?I realized that I had broken my promise.Would he be there again tonight?Was he even real?My heart had fallen for a phantom that might be as imaginary as the one in my novel.Was it possible to be in love with a ghost?Cassandra seemed to think so.Perhaps my subconscious had invented him as a distraction from my sister's death    and the reality that I had never truly been in love.Here, my other half had already fallen in love, married, given birth to a child and died.And my life had not even begun.I was in limbo    waiting.But waiting for what or who?Could my destiny be with him?And had I actually seen the future?All these questions haunted me as I drove back to the library.I focused my attention on finding a book for my niece, one that would be age appropriate.Looking through the children's section I spotted one titled My Friend Jamison.I opened the cover and read the blurb on the inside jacket."Ten year old April lives with her mother in an isolated wood.Abandoned by her father, she retreats into a world of storybooks and falls in love with Jamison, the young hero.In her fantasy, Jamison becomes real and brightens her world until the day he must leave.  "This was perfect since it was about an imaginary friend.Without me having to preach to her, I could have this book do all the work for me.I checked out the book for Cassandra and headed back to Hathaway Hall.It was already late afternoon and I remembered that the sun would be setting soon.My thoughts returned again to Jordan, my imaginary friend on the beach.When the dusk collected and the dark shadows descended, he would appear to me again in my own private sanctuary, a landscape carved in sand and bathed in a sea of dreams.When I got back, I handed my niece the library book.Cassandra had a twinkle in her eyes as she gazed at the cover.It depicted a young girl holding the hand of a ghostly boy.She glanced up at me and smiled."Devon was just here while you were gone.I told him you were going to get a book for me from the library.I cant wait for him to see this. ""You know, Cassandra.Why is it that Devon is never around when I'm here?
