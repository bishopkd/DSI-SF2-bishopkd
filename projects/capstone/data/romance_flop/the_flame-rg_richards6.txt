She winks at Mary.Mary takes in Jills entire ensemble.I guess this is why you wanted us to go ahead?She looks at the people staring.Come on.She takes Jill by the hand and leads her to Robert and Jerry.Maybe they can gather in a circle and shield the vixen.12: Walk Me to the Door      Jerry fastens on Jill as she sashays toward them.When she comes closer he sees the illusion, the center portion is a near transparent, nude color fabric.It gives the appearance the dress splits from her shoulders to her navel.She cant walk fast or everything will spill from over her ample top.Intrigue fills Jerry as he makes guesses about whats underneath.Jill wears a bracelet on her wrist to match her blond short hair and dons five inch stiletto heels.Hello, says Jerry.Hello, Im Jillian Thomas, Im happy to make your acquaintance.Jill bends before him in a graceful bow.Jerry gazes down her cleavage to see how amazing the view is from stem to stern.Im pleased to meet you, Miss Thomas.His smile is to her face but his eyes never leave the sacred ground before them.Jill indulges a moment longer then slowly lifts to guide his eyes back to another mesmerizing sight.Please call me Jill.I have a feeling we might be seeing a lot of each other.She turns slightly to reel in her catch.Barbaras face heats as she clenches her fists to the point of drawing blood.She stands at Jills side.I doubt if your husband will let you out much after tonight.Maybe you should go call him and report in.Barbara never goes after one of her friends lovers and is not about to let Jill go after hers.Jill turns with thin pursed lips.You know I am not married, Barbara, stop lying and put little Miss Green Eyes to bed.She refocuses on her prey.May I sit here?Jerry shifts his gaze from Jill to Barbara then back to Jill, I guess so.They sit on a cozy couch while Barbara stands.The others stand across from them in front of another couch.Barbara makes a move toward the happy couple.Mary springs into action, stepping in front of her raging friend.Mr.Tyler, I would like for you to meet my best friend Jill.Jill I would like for you to meet Mr.Tyler.Various emotions flash across Barbaras face.Now is not the time for cattiness but she will not take a backseat to Jills shenanigans.She grits her teeth to whisper in a calm voice.Mary, may I talk to you for a minute.Yes, says Mary.She walks Barbara away from the group.If you dont get that slut away from him I am going to kill her.Dont do anything crazy, one of you acting up is enough for me.Im not kidding, whispers Barbara through gritted teeth.I will yank her hair out by the roots.Barbara looks over at Jill on the couch whispering to Jerry.Look at that scandalous whore.Jill leans in to whisper to Jerry, making sure he gets an eye full of the girls.Excuse me a minute, Jerry, my idiot friend is having a nervous breakdown.Jill joins Mary and Barbara.Jerry shakes desperately trying to hold in his laugh.Robert glares at him from the other couch.I didnt do anything.Robert surprises them both by chuckling.You better cut it out before you get stabbed.Man, Im innocent.I was just sitting here, you saw it yourself.Robert keeps a measured tone to give useful advice.Those are three best friends; I wouldnt be a bit surprised if all three stabbed you.Pick one and be done with it.You dont have time to waste.Jill goes over and hears the two women arguing, all right, all right, all right damn it, I am out of here.I am going to the bar across the street so you two can stop your shit.I am out of here.Jill stomps to the elevator then walks across the street to a bar to have a drink in peace.A grin graces Barbaras face as she watches Jill leave.Good riddance, slut.Barbara struts back over to the couch with Mary and they each sit beside their man.Barbara gives the man across from her a stern look.Now, Robert, now that we have some quiet time, tell me about yourself, what do you do for a living?Robert smiled at her and then looks at Mary seated beside him.I dabble in a few different areas but right now I play the markets with that guy.He points, tossing the ball into Jerrys court.Jerry clears his throat.We went to college together, in fact, we were roommates.After college I went into business and got a job as a New York stockbroker.I always had a knack at picking winners.Robert wanted advice on the markets so we hooked up and are a sensational dynamic duo.Robert claps his hands silently.Jerry is the real star, he picks winners and I just provide a little cash to get the ball rolling.Well how do you like that Mary, we found ourselves a couple big timers.Barbara claps silently at Mary.Barbara, says Robert.Lets change the subject for a moment.Mary wont tell me much about herself so I am relying on you to play spoiler.Barbara eyes Mary for permission.Well, Mary is smart, dedicated, and the best friend you could ever hope for.Me, I am silly and get myself into all kinds of trouble and she is there to rescue me every time.Mary is one in a million.If you can win her heart she will be loyal forever.Robert graces Mary with a smile.That is a good friend you have got in your corner.I thought you were special the moment I saw you.He winks before turning back to Barbara.Now I need to hear her bad points and dont look at her either.Mary doesnt have bad points.Robert sizes up Barbara and tries a new tactic.Everyone has a bad side, tell me what will happen to me if I get on Marys bad side.Well, then you are asking for trouble.She looks at Mary.Mary can fly off the handle; I suppose I can say that without her getting mad at me.Mary shifts from side to side.She releases a nervous laugh.Im not mad, Barb, I try to be as fair as possible.Well, says Robert, I still dont know the hell Im in for.Tell me more.Thats enough, says Mary.It is getting late and I have an early shift tomorrow.Mary stands.The others follow suit.She walks over to Jerry, it was nice to meet you, Jerry.I hope I see you again soon.My pleasure, says Jerry.This little lady here is the most amazing woman I have ever met.Barbara grins from ear to ear.I aim to please.Robert greets Barbara with a hug.It was nice to meet you, Barbara.I hope you dont mind but I want to walk this young lady downstairs.Not at all.Barbara reaches up and kisses the tall man on the cheek.I hope you dont mind?Robert says to Mary and holds out his arm for her.Not at all, good night, you two.Mary and Robert leave for the elevator.Once off, Mary turns to Robert.You dont have to walk me, I stay just around the corner.At least let me walk you to the front door.But first, I have two wishes, if you dont mind.Robert waits, staring her down.She matches his intensity then falters.All right.First, I want you to call me Robert.I want to hear you say my name.I dont recall ever hearing you say it so if you dont mind ...Robert.Second, I would like for you to hold my hand as I walk you to the door.Mary releases a long kept breath.Her cheeks flame and her belly rumbles.No problem.She takes his warm hand and allows the escort.Robert stops at the door.He feels resistance but turns Mary toward him nevertheless.He cups her face in his hands once more and softly kisses her sweet lips.Mary keeps control.She stops her arms from flying around his neck and refuses to hug him.She feels a pull from deep within.She breaks the embrace.Goodnight, Robert.Roberts brows come together as he watches her walk down the street.Barbara rests her head against Jerrys chest on the dance floor.Her breath hitches as she listens to the steady drum of his wild heart.She loves every minute with him.But trouble rears its ugly head in the distance, a bank clock saddens her.She stops swaying and raises her head to look at him.Jerry, I hate to say it, but I have to go.Mary is not the only one with an early wake up call.I hate to leave, but I have to.No.Take the day off and stay with me.I promise you wont regret it.I have to go.Walk with me.She adds in a devilishly singsong way, You may get a surprise!I like surprises, give me a hint.Do I have to?her lips come together in a schoolgirl pout.Dont toy with me, beautiful.I have to change out of this dress.Would you be willing to lend a poor girl a helping hand?She bats her eyes and frowns playfully.Oh man, the things I have to do.Lead the way, beautiful.Barbara leads him toward the Culver Room with a seductive entrapment.Jerry trails watching her rump shaker.She gazes behind her then teases with a harder shake.Once inside, Jerry gawks as she unfastens the two brass rings that hold the dress up.She lets it fall to the floor and steps out of it.Jerry stands transfixed, she wears nothing underneath.True, they did the deed earlier but now he sees how Lady Luck graced him.Her long red hair lies against her back in teasing fashion, daring him to do the same.Her breasts are small and perky, guided missiles aimed in his direction.Jerry drops his gaze to her smooth thin waist.His eyes rake over her, pulling and digging into her flesh as they go.Goosebumps rise in their wake.Still his eyes continue their tantalizing journey, waking parts of her she hadnt realized were alive and yearning.They travel down to the amazing curvature of her hips.They move down to her shaved womanhood complete with landing strip: red of course.Jerry releases a long gasp.Barbara shimmies and his eyes fly up to her trap.My god in heaven above, can you get more beautiful?Barbara lips sprout into a big smile.She strikes a pose.How about now?Jerry shakes off a lightheaded feeling.Exquisite.If only I knew how to paint; you would be my star.Feeling an embarrassing rise in his loins, he closes the distance and kisses her.After several passionate kisses, Barbara undresses Jerry and moves him to the couch the girls sat on earlier.After more kisses and caresses, it was time to do the deed.Suddenly, there is a rustling at the doortwo female servers from the Shavers dinner party staff.Is anyone in here?One girl whispers.No, they are all at the party, says the second.Come here, baby.I dont feel right about being in here, someone could walk in.Barbara claps her hand over her mouth to keep from laughing out loud.Come here, baby, no one ever comes in here.Trust me, sweetie.I just dont feel right out in the open like this.Come on, baby, you said you wanted excitement and adventure, I am trying to give you that.Im sorry.Lets go back there, its a bathroom.We can lock the door and have some fun in there, all right, baby?That sounds better.The two women move to the small bathroom.Barbara lifts her head above the couch.Oh, shit, that was fucking close.She laughs quietly, no sex for you tonight big boy.Oh, come on, says Jerry.Look at me; I know you are not going to leave me like this!Sorry, Charlie.Barbara dresses as fast as she can.She grabs her gown off the floor and she and Jerry leave.They race down the hall to the elevator and after getting on board, laugh themselves silly while the elevator goes down.They get off the elevator and walk toward the door.Ooh, wee, that was close.My god, there are lesbians everywhere arent there?She starts laughing again.Maybe its a full moon.Jerry howls.Barbara looks to see if anyone is around.She bursts with another fit of laughter.Hell, first Jill and now these two.I have seen enough lesbians for one day.Jerrys eyes grow twice their size.His mouth hangs open.Your friend Jill is a lesbian?Well, not technically a full blown lesbo, but she does occasionally prefer the taste of women over men.I dont believe it.Jill in the red dress, the I gotta have it right now tight dress?Barbara keeps walking toward the door.Its true, she has a fiance and everything, but she does love the carpet.When they reach the door Barbara turns around.I have to get home.Will you call me?I want to see you again and I mean soon.She kisses the man, I had a wonderful time.Then she walks out of the building ensnaring him once more.She disappears around a corner, releasing her hold on him.13: After Party      Jerry putters down the street stopping at a small bar.He hungers for a beer and smoke.As he walks up to the counter he spots a blonde with short hair sitting on a stool at the end of the counter.Could it be Barbaras friend Jill?Choosing stealth, he plants himself on a bar stool on the other side of the bar.This small watering hole has a small bar area shaped into an odd shaped square.Bar stools fill each side with a bartender in the middle surrounded by bottles of liquor and glasses.Give me a Jack and Coke, light on the Coke.He says to the bartender.A woman graces his back.Anyone sitting here?Jerry turns, no.The woman sits with her drink in her hand.Thanks.Jerry pays no attention to the woman as she eyes him.He drums his fingers waiting for his drink.The woman leans closer, My name is Robin, would you like some company?No, thank you, I am just here to grab a quick drink before heading out.I could head out with you.The woman places a hand on his thigh.Jerry orders another drink and removes the womans hand.Thanks for the offer but this is not a good night, maybe some other time.He doesnt care if she is a freebie or a working girl; nothing is going to happen with her tonight.He wants to make that perfectly clear.Robin takes another sip of her drink.She gives her best smile.Let me buy you another drink before you leave and then  And then you will be on your way, skank, says Jill, standing behind the woman.Get away from my man or the only thing you will be buying is going to be two new front teeth.Whatever, the woman gulps the rest of her drink and slams the glass on the bar.Take him, hes all yours.She exits to the other side of the bar in search of fresh game.Jill watches with a scowl.Her face breaks into a smile as the woman leaves the bar with a drunk.She then turns to Jerry.Is this seat taken?Jerry gives a hefty chuckle.No, be my guest.Jill laughs and sits down.I saw her circling like a vulture.She has pulled the same number on every man that has walked through the door.I thought you might need a little help because a woman like that does not take no for an answer.I sincerely thank you, Madame.Jerry bows toward her.Can I buy you a drink?Well, I shouldnt but who gives a shit now anyway.On second thought, you might have had too many already.Jerry scans her face.No, no, no, you offered and I accepted.No take backsies, says Jill, slurring her words.Jerry studies her carefully.If that woman hadnt have left on her own, what would you have done?Drinks first, then the conversation starts.Jerry summons the bartender.Jill is already hammered but he doesnt care.Barbaras disclosure piqued his curiosity.Is she gay?We will have two more and some  Get a pitcher of beer and some glasses.She staggers to a table.Im sorry you left the party.I wanted to dance with you because that dress you have on is mind blowing.Thank you, Im glad somebody noticed.The pitcher arrives at the table, Jill pours.How about a toast?To men with good eyesight.They clink glasses and down their drinks.Jerry stares at Jill with an inquisitiveness she wont understand.Perhaps her short haircut is a sign of her lesbianism.He takes in her large breasts and decides that with breasts like that there is no way she is gay.She may have dabbled at one point but god did not make a body like that with gorgeous breasts for another woman to ignore.Those breasts have been calling for a mans touch since the dawn of time.He will gladly inscribe his name as their latest victim.Jerry pours another round from the pitcher.Here you go.Jill tries to be oblivious to Jerrys mesmerizing stare though it turns her on more than she wants to admit.She feels his eyes traveling across her body, burning holes into her skin.When she is sure his eyes are squarely focused on her breasts she turns more and leans in.Fights with Bert have left her a wanton creature, forgetting what the touch of a man feels like.That is a crime against Mother Nature and tonight she balances the scales.She makes eye contact ready to commit her crime.A penny for your thoughts?Jerry takes another drink and plunges ahead.Jerrys hands lay upon the small table dripping with sweat.His right finger moves in small circles while the left hand taps.Excitement fills Jill.Can I ask you a personal question?Yes.You dont know me very well so when I say personal, I mean personal.I could be asking you what your bra size is.I understand, go ahead and ask.All right, what is your bra size?Jill bursts with laughter loud enough to bring down the house.40DD, next question.Thanks for the info.Now for the real question, your dress intrigues me.I see the nude fabric.Would it bother you if I stared at it for a while?I am fascinated by how the dress is put together.Jill gets even more turned on by him and can feel herself moistening.She leans forward on the table.Its nude at the base but on top its transparent and all me.Go ahead, knock yourself out.I love this dress.Jerry openly stares at the dress and takes in all Jills beauty with it.He takes another drink then meets Jills stare.I wish I were the fabric that held those beauties in place.Jerry watches her reaction.Please tell me, did you rent that dress?This unexpected question stuns her.Yes, I rented it for the evening.Good, I want to buy it for you.Jill smiles, why would you want to buy it?I want you to leave here with me right now.I want us to find a quiet place so I can take that dress off and lay it beneath you.I want us to make love on top of that dress.The store will not take it back after that, so I have no other choice than to buy it because I dont want to put you in a financial bind.Jill tingles with excitement, finding it hard to catch her breath.This man knows the right things to say.She sits for a moment deciding, but the decision has been made beforehand.What the hell, you had better be worth it.Jill stands.She downs the rest of her drink and wipes her mouth.Ready, cowboy?Yee haw, you betcha!No, no, says Jill, laughing.No cowboy tonight.Ive got a beach fantasy and tonight you are my Prince Charming.Jill staggers, almost falling.Jerry laughs.Only for the night, Cinderella.Tomorrow you turn back into a maid.Jill laughs.You dont know how right you are.They cross the street in search of an access point to the beach.The beach is empty.Their tender kisses erupt into a deep lusty free for all.After several more kisses and awkward fumbling in the dark, Jill stands in front of Jerry and slowly takes her dress off.This is the moment that Jerry has been waiting for.He needs to see her breasts this instant and he needs to touch them, caress them, and suck them.Jerry is on the verge of exploding as Jill slips out of the dress and kicks it toward him.Jerry turns his head to keep from getting a face full of sand and then turns back to gaze at her beauty.He takes her by the hand.Please stand over here in the light, I want to look at you.Jill does as Jerry commands and stands with her hands on her hips grinning, waiting for Jerry to say something.You are absolutely beautiful, breathtaking.Jills short blond hair moves in the moonlight, her face aglow with excitement and anticipation.Her nipples: erect, succulent, tempting.Her somewhat narrow waist forces Jerrys eyes to the curvature of her wide hips.Her ensnaring spell drives his eyes inward to the shaven oasis: her seat of power.She watches him gulp.Do you like what you see?Of course, I do.What man wouldnt?Come here so I can see you better.Jerry spreads her dress on top of the sand in front of him.Jill comes to him to continue their lustful kisses, his thin stubble teases her lips, warming her further.She unbuttons his trousers and yanks them off with his underwear.She kisses him some more and then pushes him down on her dress.Jill plants kisses from his chest to his navel.Jerry guides her lower, throwing his head back with a loud moan.After a while, Jill kisses back up his body to his lips.They sit up and kiss more as Jerry takes Jill's bounty in his hands and with each gentle squeeze she sighs into his mouth, a siren call that begs for more squeezes.He indulges her several times before laying her down on top of her dress to complete his task.They grope under the moon.Ecstasy fills Jill.Her thoughts swarm in a fury of liquid lust.She listens to the waves crashing against the beach, trying to ground herself and make it all make sense.She wants to remember every detail of this night.She cant.To her it seems as if Jerry has somehow managed to sync his powerful thrusts with the crashing of the waves.Each thrust drives her deeper into delirium.Jill floats off into space and doesnt want the feeling to ever end.Its as if he is knocking her senseless, emptying her mind of every coherent thought but him.Then, with the world folding in on itself, her back arches with the crashing of the waves against the rocks.She hears Jerry screaming but cant see him.No, it is not Jerry, it is her giving birth to an explosive climax.Exhausted, she scrambles for air to live again.She puts a hand to her chest to control her breathing and heart rate but fails.That was ...that was ...I mean, wow, fucking incredible.She says, fumbling to put words to the unexplainable.She gasps for air.Wow, that was ...wow, agrees Jerry, fighting for the same air.They lie on the beach, Jerry on the sand and Jill next to him on her dress.When Jerry regains control he sits halfway up and turns to Jill, I meant what I said about the dress.Keep it and send me the bill.I hope we get a chance to go out and you can wear it again because I am in love with that dress.He gives a wicked smile then leans over and kisses her.Dont worry, I will be sending you the bill.Jill climbs to her feet.She shakes the sand out of her hair and her dress.Jerry watches the magnificent sight before joining her in putting his clothes back on.They exit the beach in silence walking toward the hotel.Jill stops walking and whirls.This is where we say goodnight.Thank you for the incredible evening.I dont know when I have had so much fun; I hope we get to do it again sometime.She kisses him on the cheek and leaves.Jerry breaks into a smile as he watches her leave, not believing his good fortune.He cant wait to get back and tell Robert how he scored with best friends.Jerry travels down the street whistling with a spring in his step.14: The Markets are Calling      On Saturday morning, Robert and Jerry relax in a health clubs steam room.They sit on benches with two other men wearing towels.After the men leave, Robert turns to Jerry, so what is it you are dying to tell me?Last night was the bomb.You are not going to believe the shit that happened to me.Man, it was as if I was in my own porno movie.Damn, I wish I had a camera on me so I could have recorded it all.It was fantastic.Enough already, man.Tell the shit or shut the fuck up.All right, Rob, listen to this.You know I met Barbara at your house.We hit it off and at the party the chemistry was still there.While you and Mary danced on the balcony, we went down to the first floor.We found a closet and had a quickie then returned.It was incredible.This girl has a body that just wont quit.I couldnt get enough of her.You call that the bomb?Theres more.We hurried back to the dance and you two were still on the balcony dancing.So we danced a couple of dances then you came in, remember?I remember.Well after you guys left we went across the hall and she took off her dress.I stood there and watched her and man it was incredible.Barbara is built like a brick house.I could just stand there and watch her for days without moving.I swear, man, I would die of starvation because I was too stupid to eat.You know what I mean, like those birds; uh what do you call them?Dodo birds.Yeah, them, I was mesmerized.Some girls interrupted us the second time so I walked her outside and she left.Now it gets interesting.Listen to this shit here.Barbara tells me that Jill is bi curious.Ha!Can you believe that shit?Those big ass titties and she is into girls.Cant no girl know what to do with those big ass titties.They laugh and high five.Yeah, you right about that.Jill was looking straight up in that dress.That is what I am saying, man.All that and she goes for girls.I cant believe it.Can you?Who cares, man.Tell me something I dont know.Well, anyway, I walked across the street to the bar.Jill is sitting down on a bar stool drinking.And what did you do?Robert straightens his back, ridding himself of all traces of laughter.His chest tightens as he waits in near rigid position.You know me.I went in and sat down because I wasnt sure it was her.Then this ugly ass whore starts hitting me up before I even have my first drink.This bitch would not quit.Jill comes over and chases her off and we sit and talk.Well, after a few drinks and her in that dress, I stare at those gorgeous mounds and I have to have her.So I went for it and asked if I could make sweet love to her.Robert clenches his fist beneath his towel.He keeps his face neutral and stays his quivering lip.Go on.He manages to force out.We went to the beach and had sex right there under the moonlight.Jerry playfully punches his friend in the arm while chuckling.Rob, man, she has got 40DDs that I swear to god have big nipples that look right back at you.I had sex with a lesbian and tried my damnedest to turn her back to men.Just how successful were you?although his smile vanished ages ago, Jerry has yet to take notice.
