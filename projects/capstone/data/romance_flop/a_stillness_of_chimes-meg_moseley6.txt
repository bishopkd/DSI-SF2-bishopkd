Running him ragged, no doubt.I can only imagine.A twinge of envy stabbed Laura.If shed married Sean, those three little boys with blazing blue eyes would have been her nephews, and her children would have had cousins.With Dale as their grandfather.How in the world do you handle having Dale as your father in law?Laura blurted.Annies eyes widened.Thats an interesting question.Dont read anything into it, Laura added hastily, her cheeks heating.Oh, of course not.She leaned on her shopping cart.Well, we avoid him as much as we can.Keith has ordered him to stay off our property.I wonder why Sean doesnt lay down some rules like that.I asked him once, and he said something about being merciful.Hes too tender hearted for his own good.Annie paused.I think Sean still manages to love Dale just a little, in spite of everything.Laura nodded.Stalling until she had control of herself, she picked up a tomato.Not ripe.Not even close.She put it back.I hate store bought tomatoes.Wait a couple of months, and I can bring you plenty from our garden.If youll still be in town.Im not sure Ill be here that long, but thanks.Sean will be sorry to see you go.He stopped by a few nights ago.Didnt stay long, but your name came up.Annie smiled.Matter of fact, he said youre impossible.Laura winced, wondering which tiff hed meant.I probably deserved it.No, I think he was using you as a scapegoat when hes really tied up in knots about the other thing.Other thing?TheI dont know.Ive always hoped yall would get back together, and I thought thats what he and Keith were talking about, out on the porch, so Ilistened in.Annie made a face.But that wasnt what they were talking about?No.Sean was talking about a drowning he saw a long time ago.I only heard part of it, and Keith wouldnt tell me later.Sean never mentioned anything like that?Never.He wasnt talking about my dad, was he?Sean wasnt anywhere near the lake that dayunless Im remembering everything wrong.Annie had become intensely interested in selecting a green pepper.You should ask him.She dropped a pepper into a bag.I shouldnt have said anything.Im sorry.Its okay.Really.Im still sorry.Well, I need to get home.Bye, Laura.Annie pushed her cart around the corner.Before she could lose her nerve, Laura dug her phone out of her pocket and punched Seans number.He answered on the first ring.Laura, he said in a cautious tone.Whats up?Explain this business about seeing a drowning years ago.Please?He was silent for a moment.Where did you get this information?Hed called it information.Not gossip.From Annie, she said.He grumbled something unintelligible.Whats it all about, Sean?Who drowned?I dont know.Nobody, probably.It was sort of a figurative drowning.Dont worry about it.I have the neck of a mandolin half glued.Gotta go.Bye.Wait.Dont hang up on me.IIm supposed to tell you about the party.There was a long silence.Party, he said, finally.What party?Trevors birthday party.His fifth.Tonight at six.Sorry its so last minute.Were both invited.Itll be at Gary and Ardelles house.I was supposed to ask you earlier, but But you didnt want tountil now, when you want another chance to interrogate me.Sean laughed softly.Im up to it.Ill pick you up a little before six.And then he did hang up on her.Waiting for Laura to come outside, Sean leaned against the porch pillar and looked across the road to the churchs picnic pavilion where hed carved their initials into a table on a winter evening.Hed kept coaxing her into deeper, longer kisses too.Make a cut, stop for a kiss.Make a cut, stop for three or four or five kisses.Night had fallen fast, the way it did in December, and the lights had come on in the little bungalow, reminding him of her dads unpredictable temper.He gave the pillar a pat.It was solid, like the whole house, and alive in a way that brick could never be alive.Wood could breathe.It had some give to it.He especially liked a frame house with a wraparound porch.Or any house that had Laura in itand that didnt hold echoes of Dales rages.The doorknob rattled.Laura stepped outside in a blue shirt and jeans.Holding a large, square package wrapped in garish dinosaur paper and topped with multicolored ribbons, she looked as fragile as the wrappings.Im sorry I hung up on you, he said.Youre beautiful, he added unwisely.Fragile or not, she glared at him in a way that made him think he was staring straight into a double barreled shotgun.Loaded, cocked, and aimed.That was the Laura he remembered.Fighting a smile, he lifted his hands in surrender.I take it back.Youre downright homely.Feel better now?She placed the gift in his upraised hands.Hold this, please.She locked up, dumped her keys in her purse, and frowned toward the road.Mikey escaped again.Hes out there somewhere.Laura was like Jess.Whenever brakes squealed on the road, Jess had dropped whatever she was doing to count feline noses.Hell be fine, Sean said.He always is.How much do I owe you on the gift?Dont worry about it.Laura hurried down the steps.No, Im splitting it with you.He chased her onto the driveway.What is it?She went for the passenger door, opened it before he could, and climbed in.A big remote control truck.A red one.Im glad you like red trucks.He closed the glossy red door and went around to his side.You sure about going to the party?he asked, setting the gift between them on the seat.Its not too late to call and cancel.Out of the question.But I should give you fair warning.Dont be surprised if you see some OCD behavior from Ardelle.I know.Cassie told me.You think theres any truth to it?Probably.She nailed him with that look again.Now, back to this drowning that youre so determined not to talk about.Does it have anything to do with my dad?It wasnt even the same year as your dads drowning.Maybe that would satisfy her curiosity.He fired up the truck and tried to kill his thoughts in the noise of the engine, but he only heard that ugly drowning word reverberating in his brain.Stalling for time, he pulled the truck onto the road and hit the gas.A gray blur flashed onto the roada cat?Mikey He pulled the truck hard to the left, brakes screaming.He checked his mirror, afraid hed see Mikey, but a squirrel scampered into the roadside weeds.Whew, he said.It was only a squirrel.And I missed it.Laura twisted her whole body to peer through the rear window.Are you sure it wasnt Mikey?Im sure.I saw it.She settled into her seat again.I dont know if I could stand to lose Mikey too.Her voice faltered.But the cat was old.Even if she kept him out of harms way, he couldnt have more than a few years left.Not wanting to say it, Sean took her hand.She didnt resist.Neither of them spoke in the ten minutes it took to reach the Brights new place, high on a hill outside town.It was quite the spread, a sprawling, cedar sided ranch style home with an in ground pool behind a privacy fence.They had a spectacular view of Prospect spread out below.When Sean opened Lauras doorwith difficulty, because the latch decided to stick againshe handed him the gift.She wouldnt meet his eyes.Hed known her since kindergarten.He recognized the signs that she needed to cry.And between losing her mom and hearing the rumors about her dadand half believing he hadnt loved hershe had plenty to cry about.He placed the gift on the roof of the truck.Come here, Laura.She shook her head.Dont be that way, he said.Im a friend.Friends give friends hugs.Its awkward.So?Deal with it.He opened his arms, fully expecting her to walk right past him, but she stepped close and leaned against him.Shielded from the Brights windows by a row of shrubs, he held her and stroked her hair.She still wasnt crying.Not around him.Lets skip the party, he said.Theyll understand.She shook her head against his chest.Trevor wouldnt.Hes only turning five.Hell hardly notice who shows up and who doesnt.Trevor?Ha!He notices everything.I remember that from my last trip home.Anyway, were here.Were going in.He tried to nudge her back into the truck.No.Ill call and explain.You arent up to it.Im up to it.I want to see Trevors face when he sees that big ol truck.Hell be so happy.Laura had always wanted everybody safe and happy.I love you, Sean mouthed silently into her hair.He kissed the top of her head so lightly that she couldnt have felt it.Or maybe he hadnt made it quite light enough, because her head jerked up, smacking his chin.She escaped his arms, grabbed the gift, and hustled around the bed of the truck and through the front yard.Sean followed.Gary welcomed them at the front door.Always the genial host, he gave Laura a fatherly hug, then gave Sean a cross between a hug and a bout of back slapping.Any more thoughts about the house?Gary asked after Laura had disappeared in the direction of the kitchen.Sean nodded.Once were on the other side of Memorial weekend, Ill hurry up and finish the renovations.Except then hed have more orders for instruments.Less time for the house.Good decision.Im glad to hear it.Gary lowered his voice.Hows Laura doing?Pretty well, considering she lost her mom recently.Why do people have to die?Gary asked under his breath.Because the world would get a little crowded if they didnt.Sean bit back the wisecrack in the nick of time.He walked into the kitchen in time to see Trevor accost Laura.Hey, Aunt Laura, he said, his eyes gleaming behind his glasses.Did you bring me something?Her face lit with a big grin.I sure did, sweetie.Your mom can tell you when its time to open it, okay?Its from Uncle Sean too.She set the birthday present on the table and knelt for a hug.It was complicated a bit by the way Trevor tried to see around her to check out the gift.Sean smiled, pleased with his unofficial title.Neither of them was related to the Brights, but it did feel like family.Him and Laura.Gary and Ardelle.Cassie.Tom and Tig and Trevor.He made the rounds to shake hands or hug people, as appropriate.Even the cat, that prissy, expensive parasite, welcomed him by jumping into his lap the moment he took a seat at the kitchen table.Arabella smelled like herbal shampoo, but she purred and shed fur like any ordinary cat.Somebody had put bluegrass on the stereonot Elliotts CD, but one of Gibbys.The ritzy home buzzed with music and laughter.Gary and Ardelle might have moved up in the world, but they hadnt forgotten how to let their hair down and have fun.Seans heart wasnt in it, though.When everybody else went out to the patio to harass Gary about how to cook the steaks, Sean retreated to the living room.The cat followed and claimed his lap again.He closed his eyes.He heard Cassie coming in, shouting something to somebody.Her flip flops slapped their way across the kitchen.The sound softened as they hit the carpet, and finally stopped in front of him.He opened his eyes.She stood there, squinting at him.Whats your problem?she asked.Is it obvious?Yes.She knelt beside his chair and roughed up the cats fur.Arabella twitched but went on purring.I hate birthdays, Sean said.Oh, I know.Elliott picked a bad week to drown.Yeah, thats part of it.And theres the other.Cassie frowned at him.Other?You know.Laura and me.She must have told you.Told me what?Darn it, Halloran, this sounds juicy.Out with it.Knowing she wouldnt give up until hed confessed, he let out a sigh and checked to make sure nobody was within earshot.Okay.The day I turned eighteen, I thought I was all grown up.An adult.And Laura looked so lostit was less than a week since Elliott drowned Sean stopped, remembering the blank look in her eyes, as if shed just peered over the edge of the world into the abyss.Marriage had seemed like powerful magic to shield her from more heartache.Go on, Cassie said.I asked her to marry me.Cassies eyes widened.You did?She never told you?Her best friend?Cassie shook her head, obviously enthralled.Well, what happened?She said we were too young to be thinking about marriage.Next thing I knew, shed changed her college plans.Instead of going to UGA, she went to Colorado.Like she wanted to put some distance between us.The rat.I cant believe she never told me.I guess she wanted to spare me the humiliation.He smiled a little.But I never knew I wasnt being talked about, so I felt humiliated for no good reason.See, shes the kind of woman who wont talk about an ex boyfriend.I shouldnt talk about her either.This is a different kind of talking.The constructive kind.Wow, Sean, I hope shell stay long enough to give us some time to work on her.Maybe shell even move home, unless Mikey kicks the bucket.Why would Mikey have anything to do with it?Dont you remember?Shes crazy about the cat because Elliott rescued him from a Dumpster or something.But she cant have pets in her apartment, and nobody would want to adopt such an old cat.What are you getting at?As long as Mikeys alive, theres a chance shell keep the house and move home.Youd better work fast though.Go for broke.Cassie stood up, rubbed Arabella the wrong way again, and headed for the kitchen.Sean shook his head, remembering how Laura turned him down.The moment hed realized she was saying no, her words had turned to muddy fuzz in his brain.He only knew shed been kind.Now, to find out shed never told her best friend about his stupid, misguided proposalwell, it only made him love her more.Even if she refused to love himor refused to admit she did.There was a big difference.Voices wafted toward him from the patio.Garys jovial banter and Ardelles breathless chatter.Lauras low voice, carrying a hint of the West now.Cassies big laugh and Tiggers giggle.Tig still sounded like a kid sometimes.Both Bright girls were almost like sisters to Sean.Sometimes he wished they were his real sisters.Other times, he just envied them for having two reasonably normal parents who loved them.Gary and Ardelle were good to him too, but being a charity project wasnt the same as being a son.Absently smoothing the cats silky pelt and half listening to the bluegrass on the stereo, Sean closed his eyes and remembered after school afternoons at Elliotts shop, soaking up the mans music and his kindness.Sometimes Sean had imagined being his son, a fantasy that lasted only until he realized that would make Laura his sister.That would never do.Exhausted from an evening of feigned cheerfulness and too many Gibby Sprague CDs, Laura kept her eyes on the center line as Sean drove her home.She tried to concentrate on the way the headlights ran ahead through the curves, but it didnt help.All night, shed been reliving long ago birthday parties with her parents and the Brights.Theyd always had so much fun together.As if they were really and truly all one big happy family.She made a sharp intake of breath, nearly a sob, before she could stop herself.Sean squeezed her hand.Everythings finally hitting you, he said.Right on top of losing your mom, you have the rumors about your dad.Its too much.Afraid her voice wouldnt work, she only shook her head.What are your plans for tomorrow?he asked after a long silence.Maybe she could get a couple of words out.More sorting.Why dont you get some help from somebody?Cassie, maybe?Two birds, one stone.Visit with her and make some progress on the sorting.Good idea.He parked in front of the house and shut off the engine.Sit tight.Ill get your door.It tends to stick.Like she didnt know that?But she waited as he walked around the truck.The dome light came on, making her feel exposed.She climbed out.Sean followed, hovering just behind her as she unlocked the back door.Thanks for the ride, she said, keeping her left shoulder to him so she wouldnt have to look him in the eye.Thanks for inviting me.Hey, look who decided to come home.Mikey.She turned around, her heart instantly lighter.Mikey sashayed up the steps and wound himself around her ankles.She scooped him up, caught Seans smile, and remembered her earlier terror that Mikey had been hit.Oh, I forgot Id been interrogating you, she said.You still havent explained what Annie said about a drowning.Arent you going to explain?What she overheard was a figure of speech.It wasnt a literal drowning?He hesitated a little too long.I dont believe Ive ever witnessed a literal, human drowning in my life, and I hope I never will.You have a way of not quite lying but not quite telling the truth, either.Its a gift.He walked across the porch and down the steps, then looked up at her.Next time we go out, it wont involve six other people.That was not a date, Sean.We were not technically going out.But we will.Just you wait.Lock up, now.He climbed into his truck, but he didnt start the engine until shed had time to carry the cat inside, close the door and dead bolt it.Then he flashed his headlights.The old signal was as blatant as saying it out loud.Good night.I love you.She jammed her hands into the pockets of her jeans so her fingers wouldnt be tempted to flash the porch light in answer.The truck roared out of the driveway and around the bend.Laura checked the clock.It was early.Not even ten.And as tired as she was, she knew she couldnt sleep.She might as well make a pot of decaf and try to accomplish something.Maybe shed tackle those dresser drawers.She didnt look forward to invading her mothers private space, but it had to be done.There was usually a bag of decaf in the freezer.Laura opened it and started poking around.Lots of frozen veggies and fruit.Not much meat.No red meat whatsoever, no convenience foods, and if there was any decaf it was well hidden.Reaching to the rear of the top shelf, she found a store bought bag of peas and then a clear bag full of blackberries.Her mom had always placed the berries on a small pan, leaving space between them so they wouldnt stick together as they froze.Once they were solid, shed tumbled them into plastic bags and returned them to the freezer, perfect little morsels of summers sweetness for blackberry cobblers in midwinter.Laura tossed the peas back in and clutched the bag of berries with both hands.Her mom must have picked them last yearby herself, because her young helpers had grown up.Lost in bittersweet nostalgia for the days of berry picking in the lush growth near the tracks, Laura closed her eyes.She and her friends must have brought home thousands and thousands of berries over the years.Her fingers were freezing.Gently, she placed the bag on the shelf and shut the freezer.Her mom would have chided her for leaving the door open so long.The wind was stronger now, the sound of the wind chimes clearer.Shed always loved their cheerful noise, but now it set her nerves on edge.She couldnt stand it.Halfway to the back door, she recalled the shadowy figure sweeping across the yard.Onto the moonlit road.Into the cemetery.No.She didnt want to go out there alone and thrash her way through the bushes to take down the chimes.They hung from a branch of the star magnolia, surrounded by a tangle of shrubs.It would be hard enough to find them in broad daylight but nearly impossible in the dark.Far away, coyotes yipped, chilling her blood.Their eerie voices overlapped the random music of the chimes, like two radio stations coming in at the same time, competing with each other.The shadow of the overhead fan batted incessantly at the wall, the blades making their swift circle.The coyotes went silent all at once.There was no sound but the wind in the trees and the chimes.Then the wind stilled.Everything was hushed, as if the whole world waited for something to happen.Across the road, a small crowd of churchgoers milled around the doors in the usual preservice socialization time.Not wanting them to think she was spying on them, Laura settled into a chair on the porch where shed be somewhat hidden by the lower branches of a pine.Late last night, shed found confirmation of one of her worst fears.This morning, in a fit of spite, shed deleted her moms number from her cell phone contacts.Shed used up the last of those frozen berries too.She wasnt sentimental about them anymore.Not after lying awake half the night, fuming over the note shed found in her mothers lingerie drawer.A whiff of baking cobbler escaped through the kitchen window.Her dad had always loved blackberry cobbler.With vanilla ice cream if they had it.Or whipped cream.Real whipped cream.And hed never put on a pound.Oh, Daddy, she whispered.His crazy accusation must have been true, after all.She looked up at a cloud made of bands of white and gray, chevroned.The wind had run through them like a knife through marble cake batter.Across the road, the organist pumped out some unrecognizable hymn.Most of the churchgoers had disappeared inside the building, but stragglers were still arriving.She recognized a few vehicles, a few faces.There was Garys car.He swerved into a space, climbed out, and ran around to open Ardelles door, then the rear door.Cassie climbed out of the backseat in jeans and a hot pink sweater.The three of them walked toward the church entrance, pausing to speak with two young women in flowery dresses.Gary put his arm around Ardelle and threw his head back, laughing at something.The young women laughed too, the wind rippling their skirts.They clutched Bibles like anchors to hold them to earth in the strong wind.Cassie looked over her shoulder toward the house.Laura leaned out from behind the pine and waved.Cassie waved back and made some kind of hand signal.Whatever, Laura said, watching all of them file into the church.Minutes later, Cassie sprinted across the road, across the yard, and up the steps.Breathless and laughing, she plopped herself into the chair beside Lauras.My folks probably think Im sitting in the back.My dad always said you were a corrupting influence, Laura said.Well, I can be in church pretty much any Sunday, but how often do I get to sit and visit with my oldest friend?But if you want to go, lets go.Cant.I have blackberry cobbler in the oven.Mmm, that settles it.Im not going to church.Its pretty obvious you didnt plan to anyway.Hows your mom doing?Pretty much the same.She has good days and bad days.She wont talk about anything important, and she gets mad if we suggest counseling.Laura nodded.Her dad had resisted counseling too.Not that her mom had ever pressed hard for it.Maybe she hadnt really cared.Mikey hopped onto a windowsill and meowed at them through the glass.Poor baby, Cassie said.Cant he even come onto the porch?No, hed be gone in a flash, and theres so much traffic now.Maybe he wouldnt last long outside, but hed die free and happy.Happy?Under somebodys tires?But he might be smarter than youre giving him credit for.I doubt it.He always heads straight to the road.Laura sighed.Ive been trying to decide whether or not to mention this, but I think you should know.Mikey escaped a couple of days ago because your mom let him out.My mom?Remember I told you she was overstepping her bounds?It was sweet of her to take care of things for me, but it was supposed to stop when I got into town.On Friday, she let herself in when I wasnt home.She tidied up again, and she fed Mikey and let him out.On the verge of mentioning the boxed up journals, Laura stopped, troubled by the worry in Cassies eyes.Im so sorry, Laura.Ill say something to her.Dont.I just thought you should know.It might be part of the big picture of whatevers going on with her.Maybe.Anyway, I didnt come here to talk about weird parents.I came to talk about marriage proposals.I cannot believe you never told me Sean asked you to marry him.And you turned him down?He told you?He certainly did, and if we hadnt been in the middle of Trevors party I would have dragged you off somewhere and smacked some sense into you.His timing was terrible, Cassie.It was right in the middle of losing my dad.And we were so young.Then I took off for college in Colorado, and Sean and I sort of grew apart.Grow back together then.Duh.Its not that simple.Laura hesitated, running a finger back and forth on the arm of her chair while she sought the right words.Even when we were sixteen, seventeen, I knew I didnt want to be the daughter in law of a mean drunk.Oh, come on.Do you ever hear Sean calling Dale his father?No.Sean doesnt see him as his father, so you wouldnt have to see Dale as your father in law.Cassie Wait, Ive got it.Cassie clapped her hands.Ask Sean to move to Denver.Hed start packing.You know he would.And youd never see Dale again.Laura didnt answer, but if there was any chance that her dad would come home, she couldnt stay in Denver.Shed have to return to Prospectwhere Dale lived.Cassie scowled at her.What are you so scared of?Marriage in general?Or marriage to Sean?Laura shook her head.Can you at least understand why I couldnt even think about marriage the week we turned eighteen?The same week my dad disappeared?Youre right, Seans timing was terrible, but that was then.This is now.Now wouldnt be great timing either.With all thats going on, Im a mess.Yeah.Cassie slumped back in her chair.You are.I was worse then, though.You wouldnt believe what a mess I was.Well, sure.Youd just lost your dad.It was more than that.Laura stopped, weighing her words.Now that youve had a taste of what its like to live with a parent who has some issueseven though your moms issues are minor compared to my dadsmaybe you can understand better.Hed become so hard to live with.You have no idea.Then, when we thought hed drowned, I felt a huge sense of relief and freedom.I was glad he was gone.Cassie, I was glad.And I hated myself for it.Cassie didnt answer right away, but she didnt seem shocked.Finally she shrugged.That sounds pretty normal, really.And now you think you want him back?The muffled, faraway sound of the organ floated across the road toward them as the organist murdered Amazing Grace.Laura had sung that song with her dad so many times.Shed give anything for a chance to sing it with him again.Shed give anything to tell him that although shed hated his unpredictable mood swings, his volatility, shed never hated him.Shed loved him then and she loved him now.No matter what.Yes, I want him back, she said.Even if it takes a miracle.Youll need more than one miracle.Then Ill ask God for two.Or ten or twenty.Whatever it takes.Laura closed her eyes, and once again she inhaled the sweet aroma of blackberry cobbler.Shed never eat another blackberry her mom had picked.Never again.Sean crouched on his back deck to watch the little albino raccoon feasting on the corn and table scraps laid out for him in the far corner.Silvery white in the moonlight, the baby coon looked up, more curious than wary.Nobody needed another ordinary trash can raider, but this white one was a novelty.Casper the ghost coon.Sean knew he shouldnt feed it.Hunters didnt feed coons, much less name them.Keith would never let him live it down if he found out about it.He wouldnt, though.Nobody would.Casper wouldnt last long.He was too easy to spot.Easy prey.Sean straightened.Casper scampered away, claws skittering on the smooth wood of the deck.Three seconds, and he was in the oak.He was easy to track through the branches, a pale blur in the night.The flash of white high in the tree took Sean back to the kite hed lost to the same tree when he was ten, not long after his mother passed away.Night after night, it had beat itself to death against the branches while he watched from his bedroom window.Dale had come home one day with an unexpected gift: a white and yellow kite.Seans first kite ever.Sensing that it was an apology for especially harsh treatment the night before, hed dared to hope that things were changing.Do your chores, boy, Dale had said.Then Ill help you put it together.But he was too drunk to help by the time Sean finished his chores.Keith was at work, bagging groceries, so Sean assembled the kite himself.Afraid hed be in hot water if he went as far as the park, he tried to fly it in the yard.Within minutes, it took a nosedive into the tree.Once Dale noticed, he wasnt too drunk to administer another beating.That was the last day Sean ever called him Dad.Following Keiths example, Sean started calling him Dale behind his back.A train was coming through from the south, its mournful, two tone whistle piping a lonesome tune while the wheels beat a steady rhythm.Sean cocked his head, listening.Hed never minded living near the tracks.A train in the night was evidence that he wasnt the only soul awake.Was Laura awake, brooding over everything?He hadnt heard from her since hed dropped her off the night before.He hoped he hadnt scared her off by flashing his headlights.He went inside.The thunder of a coming storm mixed with his worries to keep him awake long after hed crawled into bed.He was wrestling with that vague memory of the car in the lake when his phone rang.He grabbed it from the bedside table and checked caller ID.It was Lauraand it was too late to be a happy call.He sat up straight.Hello.She didnt answer.Outside, a vehicle rushed past on the wet street, going too fast for a rainy night.Hello, he said again, hearing a faint noise on the other end.Laura?You okay?Sean!There she was, her voice high pitched and shaky.Hes back.Who?Seans feet hit the floor.He switched on the lamp and grabbed his jeans from the chair.At the window.He The phone started cutting out.Words and fragments of words flitted in and out of his ear.Something about a beard.Was it your dad?He struggled to pull on his jeans with one hand, clamping the phone to his ear with his other hand.I dont The reception cut out again.Cursing the lousy connection, he fought one handed with his zipper.Laura?You still there?Silence.The phone slipped out of his hand, hit the floor, and slid under the bed.He ran down the hall for his gun.Nobody in his right mind would be out in this weather.The truck slued around the corner and fishtailed on the rainswept road.Sean maneuvered around a downed tree branch, swerved back to his own lane, and tromped on the accelerator.Between the swipes of the wipers, he could hardly see through the streaming glass.In less than a minute, he outran the neat layout of city blocks and crossed the railroad tracks at the edge of town where a criminal would have plenty of places to hideif he didnt mind lurking under tall trees in a thunderstorm.Kim would have advised calling the professionals.He couldnt, now that hed dropped his phone, but a loaded gun had to be worth a couple of phones.The truck fishtailed again as he hauled it around the bend by the church, tires sliding on wet pavement.The house was dark.He pulled into the drive and killed the engine but left the headlights shining while he put his hands on his gun.He didnt see anybody, but that didnt mean somebody wasnt out there.Elliott?Dale?Or a stranger.A stranger might be easier to deal with.He shut off the headlights.The churchs security lights still reached toward him from across the road.Theyd make his bare skin as visible as the albino coons white fur.He should have grabbed a shirt.A black one.Gun in hand, he opened the door and slid out.With cold rain pelting his back, he crouched beside the truck.But he didnt know which side of the truck the intruder was on.He held still, letting his eyes adjust to the dark.No noise but wind and rainand a strange absence, like a hole in the night.Spooky.No time to figure it out.He straightened, closed the door, and started for the house at a fast walk.Didnt want to run; didnt want to show his fear.He was soaked before his feet hit the steps.The rain pounded the porchs tin roof like artillery, masking his knock, but Laura cracked the door open immediately.She opened it wider, beckoned him in and pushed him to the side.He heard the bolt sliding home, the scrape of chair legs on the floor and a metallic sound.She was shoving a chair under the knob.Where was he?Sean whispered, his heart pounding, his nose dripping rain.Looking in the kitchen window.I screamed.Dropped a mug in the sinksmashed itand he ran.That clipped, staccato speech wasnt her usual style.Did you get a good look?No.It happened so fast.He was therehe was gone.And you know how nearsighted I am without my contacts or glasses.His eyes were growing accustomed to the black room.Laura was wearing Jesss white bathrobe.In the silence, his breath coming fast, he tried again to identify why the wind and the rain sounded so different tonight.Something was missing.Goose bumps stirred the hairs on his wet skin.Youve seen somebody twice, just since youve been back in town.Yes, she whispered.He could only think of the flash of brown in the green, the first day Laura was back in town, when hed walked her home from church.It might have been a man in camo, and that made three times.Tonight, it was my dad, she said.I know it was.How can you know, if you couldnt really see his face?And if it was your dad, why did he run?She pulled in a sharp breath.Because I screamed.I screamed at the top of my lungs.I didnt mean to.I didnt want to scare him away.The scream that would scare a banshee.Lets go in the den, Sean said.Thats where you always felt safe when Slattery was prowling around, remember?Maybe weve got ourselves another Slattery.He led her there, holding her hand.The den was pitch black, its heavy drapes drawn tight.He placed the gun on the floor, switched on a lamp, and tugged her down beside him on the double rocking chair.He was freezing, his shoulders still wet.Shed found her glasses.She studied him with those solemn brown eyes framed by brown plastic, but she didnt speak.We need security lights everywhere, he said.Well light up the place like Vegas.You need new locks too.And an alarm system.She only shrugged.He put his arm around her but resisted the notion to kiss the top of her head.He started the loveseat rocking.It should have been a comforting motion, but it only created a breeze on his damp skin, chilling him.A gust of wind and rain battered the house.Laura tensed.Not wanting to scare her off, he resisted the impulse to pull her closer.As long as she was in his arms, she was safe from whoever had been at her window.Except one mans body wasnt much of a shield.He couldnt be with her twenty four hours a day, either.There are guns in your dads gun safe, he said.You have the right to defend yourself if anybody breaks in.And you have a phone.Im glad you called me, but you need to call 911 too, if it happens again.Im not calling 911, she said.You told me the sheriff thinks the rumors are bogus.He wont even care.Hell care about a man whos walking around town, looking in windows.If you wont call the sheriff, youre staying somewhere else.My house, the Brights house, I dont care.Or Im staying here.Then youre staying here, she said.She sat stiffly in the dark, breathing fast and trembling like a hummingbirds wings.At a quarter to four, rain still hammered the windows.The house was an ark tossed about on a stormy ocean, with only two souls aboard.Three, if she counted the cat.But someone else had been out there in the night.Trying to remain calm and act normal, Laura walked into the kitchen and caught Sean scratching Mikeys chin and crooning some kind of nonsense to him.Since when have you been so nice to Mikey?she asked.He looked up, wearing a blue shirt that brought out the intense color of his eyes.He must have borrowed it from her dads closet.How about some coffee?Why not?Well never get back to sleep anyway.Coming right up.He went straight to the cupboard that held the good Costa Rican stuff.He knew where the coffee filters were too, and he knew how to coax the beat up coffee grinder into operating.Laura opened a different cupboard to pull out a couple of mugs.There was her dads favorite, right where it belonged.She rested her fingers on the handle.Black, plain, the mug had a hairline crack and a white chip on the rim.Mom had nagged him to throw it out but he wouldnt.She could have thrown it out once he was gone, but maybe shed turned sentimental about it.Maybe shed even come to regret the affair.Or she was just a pack rat.Laura pulled the mug from the cupboard.So many times, shed seen her dad warming his big hands around that chipped mug.Sometimes hed curved a hand tenderly around her mothers cheek too, in a kind of benediction.Laura.Seans voice was nearly in her ear.What?You okay?I dont think you heard a word I said.Hed been talking?Im fine.Ignoring Sean just behind her, she put the black mug on the counter, chose one for herself, and rummaged in the cupboard for the sugar bowl.Sean poured coffee for both of them.Still take yours like a man?Yes, thanks.She took her black coffee to the table and wrapped her hands around the heat of the crockery.Now, what were you talking about?Nothing important.His spoon clinked softly as he stirred in his usual boatload of sugar.She tried her coffee.He was right.The Costa Rican stuff was good.Good and strong.Is that cobbler?he asked.Yep.Help yourself.You dont want any?No, thank you.She closed her eyes, seeing those purple berries piled up in a bucket in the late summer sun.Seeing her moms long, slender fingers brushing the frozen berries into a plastic bag.Tucking them away for later.The perfect breakfast, Sean said.Coffee and cobbler.She kept her eyes closed and didnt answer, just listened to the sounds as he clattered around, dishing up a serving of the cobbler and then settling into the chair across from hers.His fork clinked against the plate.Delicious.Your moms recipe?No.Its one I found online.She hadnt wanted to open her moms recipe file.It would have unleashed memories of baking together.Making her dads favorite suppers.Being a happy family, most of the time.But she couldnt forget that last big blowup either.Laura shuddered and opened her eyes.Sean had his last bite of cobbler halfway to his mouth.Whats wrong?Nothing.No.Tell me whats wrong.The cobbler, she blurted.Its the lastthe last She couldnt say it.Looking bewildered, he pointed the fork toward the dish on the counter.No, theres plenty more.You want some?No.I dont meanIts not the last of the cobbler.She steeled herself, making her voice hard and clear.I made the cobbler with the last of the berries my mom ever picked.Aw, Laura.Abandoning his last bite, he came around the table and crouched beside her.He took her hand in his.Youll be missing her for a long, long time.But thats not it.Itsits about something Ive kept from you too long.Oh Sean, I dont want to tell you, but youll need to knowespecially if my dad comes back.All right.Sean sat in the chair beside hers.He didnt let go of her hand.This will sound stupid.Youll think theres no connection between blackberries and thisother topic.But bear with me.Okay.When we were teenagers, I heard my folks arguing.Wanting to stop right there, she made herself keep going.Dad accused her of being unfaithful.Sean flinched almost as if shed slapped him.Did they know you were listening?No.They were right here in the kitchen, and I was around the corner.Id left to spend the night at Cassies house, but I came back for my toothbrush.I only listened for a minute.When was this?About a month before he disappeared.She had an affair, Sean.He found out.He made his plans, and he walked away.If you thought it was related, why didnt you mention it when he went missing?We thought hed died, remember?And II didnt want to believe it was anything more than his paranoia.I thought it was best to give her the benefit of the doubt.Did she acknowledge that there was any truth to it?I dont know.I didnt eavesdrop long enough to find out.He shook his head.Maybe it wasnt true.But since then, Ive wondered about things I saw over the years.Clues that she was a little too friendly with a certain someone.She stopped, hating to say it.Last night, I found aa naughty note in her dresser.A note in masculine writing.Theres no signature, but its not my dads writing.Does anybody else know about this?Nope.Then Laura managed a half smile.I expect the other man knows.Do you know who it was?Think for a minute, Sean.You know.Itll come to you.She started a silent count to ten.At six, Seans eyes widened.Gibby.Thats my theory.By the time we were in high school, my dad was practically impossible to live with.Maybe shed started looking for someone new, and there was Gibby.Always so charming and available.And he came through town every few months.He still does.Hell be here for the weekend.I could ask him if its true, but part of me would rather not know.Id rather just forgive both of them, as if I know its true, and let it go.Thats probably a good way to handle it.But remember, you dont know the timing of the note.It might have been written long after your dad was gone.Maybe, but the simplest explanation is that the argument I overheard was about her and Gibby.And Dad walked away a month later.Seeing the sadness in Seans eyes, Laura squeezed his hand.I didnt want to tell you, Sean.Im sorry.Im sorry too, but Im glad you told me.It does put a different spin on things.He tilted his head, studying her.You think this proves that your dad walked away instead of drowning, dont you?Im about ninety nine percent convinced.Thats a mighty big leap.I know, but it all fits.I only hope that if hes alive, he wont pick next weekend to come back.When Gibbys in town.That could be a real problem.Frowning, Sean reached across the table to retrieve his coffee.It must have cooled, but he drank it anyway, staring into space.He made no move to finish eating his cobbler.Now its your turn, Laura said.I told you a whopper of a secret.When will you explain that figurative drowning?He looked up, startled, then smiled.Compared to what you just told me, its nothing.Years ago, I saw somebody sending a car into the little lake on old man Bennetts land.She pondered it for a moment.You meanlike somebody stole a car and had to get rid of it?That would make sense, wouldnt it?Its just funny that Annie made such a big deal of it.He picked up his fork and worked at straightening a crooked tine.I guess she didnt hear everything so she had to fill in the blanks from her imagination.I guess.Thunder boomed, making both of them jump.Here comes another round, Sean said.Nobody will be out in this.Laura was sure hed meant to make her feel safe from intruders, but she could only think about her father, cold and wet and miserable.Somewhere.Laura woke, her feet cold and her cheek itching against the rough fabric of the couch cushion.Instantly, she remembered the bearded man at the window.She and Sean had sat in silence for a long time after theyd moved back to the living room.They hadnt turned on any lights, though an occasional flash of lightning had shown her his troubled expression.She sat up and examined her elbow.In a few days, the bruise wouldnt be visible anymore.Sean still hadnt noticed it.The heavy old quilt lay across her.Sean must have tucked her in after she nodded off.With his gun by his side, he lay on the hooked rug on the hardwood floor, his angular features softened by the shadows of morning.No pillow, no quilt.His hair was tousled and messy.His stubborn mouth was relaxed in sleep.She had her work cut out for her, but she had to convince him that her visitor wasnt a criminal, wasnt a ghost.It was Elliott Gantt in the flesh, wandering around in a terrible storm and frightened away by his own daughters scream.She could hardly bear the thought.She swung her feet to the floor, then arranged the warm quilt over Seans long frame, pleased with the idea of transferring her body heat to him.He didnt stir, even when she pulled the quilt up to his whiskery chin and touched his cheek with one finger.Some bodyguard you are, she said.He still didnt wake.He should have been in his own bed, getting a good nights sleep.No, he should have been hard at work already, making all those mysterious little tweaks to the nearly finished instruments that he wanted to sell at his festival booth.He should have been proofreading his brochures so the printer could have them ready by Friday morning at the latest.To get Sean back where he belonged, working toward his dream, shed have to convince him she wasnt in danger.After last night, it wouldnt be easy.She tiptoed around him and went into the kitchen, where Mikey swatted her leg in a silent demand for food.She gave him a can of chicken and liver, his favorite.When she opened the trash to throw the can away, she saw shards of angels and rainbowsthe remains of the angel mug that shed dropped in the sink when she saw the man at the window.Sean had cleaned up the wreckage.The window framed a sky of the brightest blue.Small tree limbs and scattered leaves lay across the yard, varying shades of brown and green on the lawn.Sunlight glistened in still puddles.No branches moved.The wind had worn itself out in the night.She recalled those deep set eyes meeting hers for a fraction of a second.Shed screamed, and the man had ducked out of sight.It couldve been Dale.He had a beard too.But his eyes werent that deep set, were they?She was almost certain it was her dad, but after all that time in the wild, his appearance would have changed.His mind and his heart might have changed too.He might have left signs of his visit.After Laura dressed, she put her phone in her pocket.Blocking Mikeys escape, she stepped onto the leaf strewn porch.It was cold and damp beneath her bare feet.Beyond the borders of the yard, green billows of kudzu were taking over.A whole regiment of men could hide in the luxuriant growth.The world was holding its breath.No wind blew, not even enough breeze to move the chimes.She couldnt see them, hidden as they were by shrubs, but she imagined the silvery cylinders hanging motionless among the drenched leaves.There would be no footprints.The storm would have washed them away.Just as time had washed away the evidence of her mothers guilt or innocence.Then the aneurysm had taken her life.Her voice had been so calm, last Christmas, when she casually mentioned that shed already made her funeral arrangements, wanting to get them off her mind for good.Less than six months later, she was gone.Maybe shed had a premonition.She opened her phone and checked the time.It wasnt too early for a call.Cassie answered on the second ring, sounding groggy.Good morning, but next time remember Im still on California time.Good morning, Eeyore.Yeah.Whats up?
