Jill chuckled.Dont pay any attention to her, Barb.Ill be there with bells on and so will she.Maybe we will find a couple millionaires.At least two will be in the box with us.Hey, what are you guys drinking?Sex on the Beach, said Jill.That reminds me of a joke, Barb.Two people were having sex on the beach and a man walked up and said, I would like to have sex on the beach.So the bartender pointed to a couple screwing and said, well go join in buddy they dont mind.Jill started laughing hysterically.Barbara stayed silent.She looked at the alcohol in the glasses and looked skeptical.So how about it?Have you ever had sex on the beach?Jill asked Barbara.You mean the drink?No.Still confused by the joke, she looked at Mary.Hey, Mare, have you ever had sex on the beach?Jills scalp tightened.She clenched her fists.She drew up to her full height right before her face turned a bright red and she banged her fists down hard on the table.Dont you call her that you whore!You havent known her long enough to call her that you slutty ass bitch!Barbara jumped up out of her chair.She had had her fill for tonight.Im going to kick your ass all over this place, you spoiled ass bitch!Barbara balled up her fists and took a step toward Jill.Mary stood up and grabbed the half empty pitcher of beer.She drenched Jills blouse with the thrown beer and watched her jump in horror.Mary looked at Jill and scolded her.Goddamn it!How come we cant just have one damn night of peace?Damn it!She sat back in her seat and started crying.Barbara sat back down and hugged Mary.Im sorry, Mary.It wont happen again.Im so sorry for acting like that.Jill was drunk and didnt care.When Barbara returned to her seat, she grabbed the edge of the table and turned it over toward Barbara.You fucking bitch!You did this, not me, YOU!Barbara fell to the floor.Mary moved to help Barbara to her feet, a small trickle of red graced Marys forehead.Let me go!Let me go!Jill twisted in the grip of two towering bouncers.She kept yelling but the men held her firmly in their grasp.The Cuban server had told the men earlier to keep an eye on the irate Jill.These men had maneuvered themselves to a table close by the women so they could stop any problems before they developed.They did not see Mary throw the beer at Jill but they did hear Jills yelling and saw her push the table.They held Jill while the server called the police.After Mary helped Barbara to her feet she went to see about Jill.Hey, let her go.Sorry Maam but she is not going anywhere, said one of the bouncers.Fine, can you stop holding her so tight and let her breathe a little?Maam, we have to hold her until the police get here.Help me, Mare; Im sorry, you know I didnt mean it.Jill kept struggling and started to cry.Mary picked up Jills chair and put it behind her.Let her sit down, please.The men released their grip so Jill could sit down.She sat in the chair and Mary stood in front of her.Jill wrapped her arms around Marys waist and sobbed, Im sorry, Mare, Im so sorry.Mary patted Jill on the head as if a faithful dog.She brushed her hair with her hand and kept telling Jill it would be all right.Stay with me, Mare, she sobbed while holding Mary tightly around the waist with her face buried in her stomach.Im not going to leave you.I will be with you always, Jilly.Mary called Barbara over to sit beside Jill.Stay with her while I talk with them.Barbara held her bleeding elbow but agreed.All right, Mary.She sat beside Jill but did not talk to her.Jill had calmed down and was being cooperative so the men let her go and backed off.Jill looked around the room and had paid no attention to the gathering crowds.She was now feeling embarrassed and stupid.She was beginning to sober up when she looked at Barbara and got angry again.If I have to go to jail this slut is going with me because it is all her fault.Barb, could you come here, I want to apologize face to face.Barbara stood next to her but didnt say a word.Jill glanced at the womans elbow.She turned soulful grey eyes up to Barbaras face then smiled like a Cheshire Cat.The reason I asked you if you have ever had sex on the beach is because I have.I fucked Jerry last night on the beach by the Ocean Park lifeguard tower.He said I was a ten and you were a four so he had to upgrade, he doesnt want to slum anymore.She smiled again; delighted that she saw rage and jealousy flash across Barbaras face.Barbara looked at the guards behind Jill.They were talking and not paying attention to them.Barbara looked back down at Jill and this time it was she who wore the Cheshire Cat smile.She leaned down to whisper to Jill.Since all you do is lick and suck on dikes, its easy to believe that you are a professional cocksucker.Now brace yourself, Miss Jilly.Without further warning she backhanded Jill so hard that she fell backwards in her chair and hit the floor with a hard thud.Jills white skirt flew up, exposing the fact that she was bare underneath.A few people clicked pictures with their cell phones while Barbara put her hand over her mouth, feigning surprise.She sighed loudly, rushed over, and looked at the bouncers who had turned around after hearing the loud thud.Oh please, help me get her up.She must have passed out.Barbara and the men picked Jill back up.Jill could barely hold her eyes open.Talking was out of the question.Mary rushed over with the server.What happened?She finished pulling Jills skirt down and slapped Jills face lightly, Jilly, are you all right?Mary tried shaking her dazed friend.Help me get her up so we can go.Mary said to the two men.I settled everything and the police have been told not to come.The men looked at the server who confirmed what Mary said.They helped her to her feet and then Barbara and Mary got on each side of her and walked her to the door.Just a minute, said the server.She held up a camera, Smile.She took a group picture then individual pictures.When she wakes up, tell her if she comes back she will be arrested on the spot.Im sorry but that goes for you two as well.They turned back toward the door and left the club.They put her in the back seat of a taxi and both got on opposite sides to hold her up.After the taxi stopped, they helped Jill into Marys apartment and put her on the bed.Oh no, she needs a shower before she gets in bed.Help me get her in the tub.They removed her clothes and leaned her against the tiled wall.They gave her a quick shower to wash away the beer and Jill fought with them so they hurried and put her into bed.Barbara started for the door, she stopped and turned.Did you know?Know what?Her sex on the beach joke.After we left, she had sex with Jerry on the beach.I guess now I know why I didnt get flowers.Obviously I wasnt that good or satisfying.Mary burst into laughter.Maybe not, but damn, did you have to hit her that damn hard?They roared with laughter.Im still alive, bitches.Jill mumbled softly then fell back into slumber.They laughed all the more.Ill keep her awake, go home.Have fun.Barbara left and Mary got in bed next to Jill.17: Sophie and Bob      Robert sat on the edge of the bed staring at the phone.He was not sure if he needed to call or to wait until he was back in Miami and talk in person.He wiped perspiration from his hands as he readied to dial the scribbled number on the hotel pad.Earlier that morning Jerry had dragged him to another strip club that he had heard about.Only Jerry could find these hellholes.When Robert walked into the club he did not expect much, this club was just a one room building in a bad section of town.Robert looked around the room and there was only one small stage and a bar against the wall.This place had none of the glamour and appeal of modern strip clubs.The smoke filled room housed drunken men gathered around a small stage gawking at a dancer on her knees.Come on, Rob.Lets go to the stage area, you wont believe what these girls do.Robert followed Jerry, grateful they made the trip in daylight hours.His heart thundered.His scalp tightened.What can we get to drink in here?He watched the crowd, trying to stay on high alert for trouble.Ill be right back, said Jerry.He walked over to the bar and paid for two beers then came back with the two bottles.Here ya go.He gave Robert a bottle and took a drink of his.The girl we are here to see is a girl named Sophie.This girl is unbelievable; she does an act that you will remember for the rest of your life.I found out about this place on Facebook.I subscribe to a strip club hot line that keeps you updated on all of them in the country.The things people said about Sophie are incredible.He pointed to the bartender, I asked him and he said shes up next.She better hurry up, this place is giving me the creeps.Robert took a swallow from his bottle.The dancer on stage left and the announcer came out.And now, for your enjoyment, I bring you the delectable, delicious Sophie Moonbeam.A black woman came out from behind the curtain.She wore a blue and silver wrapped skirt with a V neck white blouse with large buttons in the front.She was a thick sister who whirled to grace all with her outstanding assets.The crowd went wild as she raised her skirt and gave them a glimpse of her award winning ass.It was smooth and more dark brown than black.Robert was amazed to see that she did not have all the telltale traits most strippers of her size acquired: no stretch marks, no scratches, no potholes.This woman shook her moneymaker to cheers from the crowd.Sophie turned back around and faced the men and began her striptease in earnest.She thrilled the men but very few of them threw money at her, instead they hooted and hollered, occasionally throwing a dollar or two to keep her going.She unwrapped her skirt to reveal her dental floss of a G string.Robert grinned at Jerry, wondering how long it would last before it fell apart under all those gyrations.He threw a couple dollars at her and Jerry caught his arm and vigorously shook his head.Robert stopped and just watched.She sat up and took off her top and let her large naturals sway from side to side in front of the menat least an E cup in Roberts estimation.It took a well rehearsed move to get them in motion, but once moving, she made them flap around her chest to the delight of the men.She then got back down on all fours to move toward the man farthest away from Jerry.Watch this, said Jerry to Robert.Sophie crawled to the man.He dropped a $100 bill between her hands and she came closer to him.He reached out his hands and massaged her breasts.He pinched her nipples.She giggled and pulled back like a shy schoolgirl.She then picked up her money and leaned back forward and gave him another feel.This time he leaned in and after massaging her breasts he put one of the huge breasts in his mouth and sucked hard.She pulled away and went to the next man.She performed the same routine on the next four men with varying degrees based on the money they placed in front of her.When she made it to Jerry he put down a $100 bill and licked his lips and pointed to Robert.Sophie passed by Jerry picking up the money and crawled in front of Robert.She leaned toward him and Robert felt her breast.Sophie closed her eyes and shook as if Roberts touch electrified her body.She threw her head back and sighed.She sat up and danced on her knees making her breasts dance their dance.Robert watched and felt his mouth watering.Sophie came back down in front of him and held her breasts in her hand in front of him.She licked one of her nipples and squeezed it.She smiled at Robert and then pulled her nipple.She then placed her breast up to his mouth.As he tried to lick the nipple she playfully pulled it away and giggled.She then brought it back and rubbed it on the side of his cheek.Then she put it in his mouth and as he sucked down hard on the nipple she closed her eyes, leaned back and moaned.She arched her back and moaned again as Robert pulled deeper and deeper.She shook one more time and then to Roberts shock, her bounty came forth in rich squirts.Sophie squeezed, shooting a stream of milk into his mouth.Jerry plunked down another $100 and received the same sweet nectar.Sophie then backed up and stood up and danced some more.Jerry had found a winner for sure this time.Robert slapped him on the back then they high fived each other.They watched her dance as the song changed and the music sped up.Sophie dropped her G string and turned to shake her ass in front of the men.They hooted and hollered some more.Shes not finished.Watch this and be amazed, said Jerry.Sophie turned and turned shaking and twisting.She had all the men fired up and ready.She turned and dropped low.Robert watched as this woman with this huge ass dropped straight down with her ass only inches from the floor.This girl was an athlete and had her routine down pat.She shook her ass and bounced it around, gyrating for the men.Then she stood back up and raised her hands above her head and froze in place.She stayed frozen for a minute as if gathering her strength for her finale.Then she dropped and shook her hips and made her ass clap loudly, like thunder before the lightning.The men went wild with delight.They all took out money, beckoning her to them.She did her famous booty clap a couple more times and turned around to see who had the most money in their hand.She smiled at Jerry who held a hundred dollar bill in each hand.Sophie bent down and clapped in front of his face.Jerry felt a breeze of warm air as she clapped.The scent drove him wild.She clapped again before stopping.Jerry slid the money between her legs and then he placed his right hand between her cheeks.He slid a finger inside her and turned his hand sideways.She clapped her cheeks together again in rapid secession.Jerry enjoyed himself, thrilled to watch his hand get slapped out of her ass from her clapping.Woo Wee!Jerry shouted.Sophie stood back up and continued dancing with her back to the men.She turned back around to see who would be next.Jerry pointed at Robert and he placed the money in front of him.Sophie picked up another $200.Robert rubbed her gorgeous ass with both his hands, enjoying the texture and feel.He then slid a finger between her cheeks.Her scent wafted to him as his finger slid further into her soft, slippery wetness.He turned his hand sideways and she began clapping.Robert sat there and felt breeze after breeze wash over his face.The sweet smell of her juices and funk mixed in the air to rush over his face.This woman had talent.As she moved to one of the others Jerry stood up.You ready?Robert shook his head.Yeah man, lets get out of here.They walked to the counter and got another beer each and walked out the door.Jerr, man, you were right this time.You have had some duds in the past, but man I have got to give it to you this time.She was outstanding.They got into the car and Jerry drove them back to the hotel.Oh Rob, man, he started chuckling.I want to marry a woman who can do that shit on a nightly basis!Ooh Wee!Jerry yelled as he drove.Robert sat on the bed and smelled his fingers; the scent of Sophie was still there but fading.He picked up the phone and dialed the number.After a few rings he heard a female voice answer.Hello.Mary, this is Robert.How are you tonight?Marys eye grew to saucers.She peeked from her hallway into her bedroom to see Jill still fast asleep.Robert, h how how did you get my phone number?her voice came out higher than she liked.I phoned Mrs.Belmont and forced her to give me your home phone number.Please dont be angry with me, after all it is your fault.My fault, said Mary, regaining her composure.Yes, your fault.Robert laughed jovially on the phone to let her know he was not being serious.Mary I could not go to sleep without hearing your voice.I dont know how you did it but you have cast a spell on my heart.Now tell me truthfully, are you going to take your spell off me or not?Mary laughed.She was not sure about this man but he kept her on her toes and she liked that.I wish I knew how to cast spells, she laughed.If I did, a whole lot of people would be in serious trouble.Oh, Mary, tell me the truth.Did you put a spell on me?Mary laughed again.No, I didnt.Robert sighed.Mary blustered at the silence.Hello, are you still there?Robert stayed silent.He was waiting for her to say something, wanting to know if she was going to put forth effort.Hello.Mary began to panic.She listened for Jills snoring then moved to the bathroom.She spoke with a quiet urgency.Are you there?How come you dont call me by my name?Well, Mary thought about it, you dont look like a Robert.What does that mean?I went to school with this A hole named Robert and I hated him with a passion.I mean he got under my skin.If they made a law where you could kill one person and get away with it, he would be my pick.When I say the name Robert I automatically think of him.Are you being serious?Yes, I am.I wish you had told me earlier.Now I look like a jackass trying to get you to call me something you detest.Will you forgive me, Mary?Of course, it is my fault for not speaking up in the first place.Im the one who should apologize.Will you accept my humble apology?Mary laughed quietly.I accept your humble apology.Now we have to fix this problem because I love hearing my name and in the future I plan to make you scream it.So tell me, how can we fix this problem?Mary giggled softly.She didnt know how to respond.She remained silent for a moment.Mary?I dont know, give me a suggestion.How about Rob, Bob, Bert or Beebee?Mary laughed so hard she snorted.Beebee, where on earth do you get Beebee from?She continued laughing.Robert laughs with her.He loves the sound of her voice and delights in having the ability to make her laugh.Just something I thought of.Come on, Mary, pick one.Give me a name and put me out of my misery.Mary stopped laughing and got serious.Ok, not Beebee and definitely not Bert.Bob, I like Bob.Yeah, it sounds more appropriate.I can see you as a Bob.Ok, Bob it is.Wait, how about Bobby!He said with flair.Oh my god!No!That reminds me of crazy whats her face going around yelling, Bobby!Bobby!Mary bursts out with more laughter.Robert laughs with her.When the laughter stops he responds.I know what you are talking about.Bob it is, until you think of something else.All right, Bob, said Mary.Bob.Yes, I like it.It sounds like you, Bob.Hey, Mary?What?May I call you, Mary?Mary smiles and wishes he could see her face.Thats my name, dont wear it out.Robert laughs.It is so easy to talk to you, Mary.I wasnt sure I should call but I forced myself to.Im glad you did.I was thinking of you earlier.Truthfully?Yes, truthfully.Mary looked up at her ceiling and sighed.It is easy to talk to you as well, Bob.I really wanted to hear from you.Im glad I called.Me, too.Did you get my flowers?Marys heart sank.She had forgotten but now her heart thundered.Mary, are you still there?Yes, Bob, Im here.Can I be honest?You hated the flowers didnt you?No, no I loved them.Im not good at taking care of them; they will probably die before you get back.Oh, I didnt know.Always tell me the truth, Mary; I cant stand people who lie.So what is it you have to be honest about?Mary was silent for a while.She needed time to compose her thoughts because she had to say it the right way.Robert kept silent and waited for her to speak.Mary sighed, running a stray finger around the bathroom sink.Why did you send me flowers?What is their meaning?I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you.Nothing more.So you dont expect something from me?You mean sex for flowers?Mary was silent for a while.Yes.Im glad we had this time to talk, Mary.I didnt know the flowers would make you worry.Ill be blunt.I can have sex with any woman.That is not what I am after.I like you.I think that you are a special lady and I want to take time to get to know you, the real you.Im not in a hurry to have sex, I dont need you to satisfy that need.Im not trying to sound arrogant.Im trying hard to put your mind at ease and let you know you are special and worth getting to know.Mary, I know I am not saying this right but I hope you can get my meaning.Mary listened to everything Robert said and then reviewed his words in her mind.She loved his smooth voice, how it put her at ease and made her feel safe.I understand.Thank you for not rushing me.I have a lot going on right now and dont need the extra stress.Im glad you understand.Now tell me about your day today, how did it go?Mary laughed lightly, It was all right.It is my day off and I have just been cleaning, it helps me unwind and takes my mind off things.I was in the bathroom cleaning when you called.Mary felt herself falling hard for this man.She had never known a man to ask about a womans day.She wanted to pinch herself to make sure she wasnt dreaming the whole thing but could not take the chance.What about you, how was your day?If Im one hundred percent honest, I have to tell you to never ask a question that you really dont want the answer to.He paused to see if she would say something.Well, Im babysitting Jerry until the market opens tomorrow so I cant let him out of my sight.To keep him happy I let him drag me down to a strip club because there was a stripper he wanted to see.Are you upset?No.Thank you for being honest.Sometimes honesty hurts peoples feelings but I do believe it is the best policy in the end.I cant wait until we can finish and get back to Miami.Robert took a whiff of his finger.I cant wait either.Well, it is getting late and you need your rest so I will let you go.Can I ask a favor of you?What is it?Will you go out with me when we get back?I mean a real date, just me and you.Mary smiled and grew warm all over.Yes, I would love to go out with you.Good.Now I need you to pick the place.Will you take the time and think about where we will go and what we will do?I am asking because I dont want to take you for granted and do something that you hate.I want you comfortable and at ease.Thank you for saying that, Bob.I will give it some thought and come up with something.Good, Mary.I hate to let you go but I have to.Good night, Mary, pleasant dreams.Goodnight, Bob, pleasant dreams to you, too.18: First Date      Mary thought long and hard about her date with Bob and where they would go and what they would do.In the end, she decided to play it safe and have dinner at the hotels five star restaurant.After work, she changed in the Culver Room and took the elevator down to the first floor.She walked down the long hallway and across the walkway.When she arrived at the entrance, she took time to admire the hotels famous arch ceilings.Many times she would walk the halls and never pay attention to the hotels decor.This was the perfect evening to get out of her shell and live in the moment as a different person.Mary relished the thought of being the guest instead of the servant.Mary fashioned her hair in a classic, glamorous, curly, retro look.She added that extra modern flair by incorporating finger waves with her bangs swept to the side and secured with a blue minibarrette to add sparkle and hold the side swept pieces firmly in place.She wore a light blue dress sporting a medium low cut neckline.She still was self conscious about her large bosom and often wished she were a simple B cup like Barbara.Unfortunately, she and Jill were blessed with extra padding so a string of pearls served as much needed camouflage.She would have to remember to guard them with care and return them to Mrs.Belmont at her first opportunity.She caressed them before taking a moment to review her blue pumps, deciding a blue purse would be a bit much for her evening.She phoned Bob earlier and told him to meet her at the Segara Restaurant on the first floor of the Segara Hotel.Not seeing him, she approached the hostess.Hello, Im Mary Lake.I have a reservation for 8 oclock.Has my party arrived?The hostess checked her reservations list.I dont believe so.Would you like to be seated now?Yes, please.Your server will be here in a moment.The hostess said, after escorting her to the table.She then left to wait on others.Mary looked around the impressive room.Soft piano music echoed around her while exquisite aromas filled the air.Hello, Mary.Robert looked dashing in a white shirt with brown blazer.He wore black slacks and shoes.His smile warmed her.Hello, Bob.Im glad you could make it.Please sit.You are looking wonderful tonight.He sat.Thank you for saying so.The server came over with menus.Hello, my name is Rhonda and I will be your server tonight.Please look over the menu and order when ready.What is the house special this evening?Robert asked her.Wallingtons soup.It is a bouillabaisse with turkey and potatoes, similar in texture to clam chowder.It is served with rolls and red wine.The soup comes with two entrees and a slice of red velvet cake to round out the meal.Robert watched Mary who gave no indication.We are not sure yet, give us a few moments.Of course, order when ready.Rhonda left the table.They began to look over the menu.Robert looked up at Mary after a few minutes.Anything strike your fancy?Not really.Half the things on here I cant even pronounce or know what they are.I thought you had been here before or maybe it was your favorite place?No.It is right under my nose and since I pass by it every day, I thought I might try it.Especially since you are paying and you had such a great day in the markets.Mary teased with the hint of a smile.Robert grinned.You dont make money so you can blow it the next day.Am I being hustled here?He gave a devilish grin.Not on your life, Mr.Tyler.Besides, you wouldnt mind treating a girl to a little luxury would you?Not at all.Tell me your hearts desire, Mary.Give me a chance to make your fondest dream come true.Mary feigned shock.Careful.I hear there are people in Hell today who wish they had been more careful with their wishes.I trust you.I have no doubts at all.But strictly for fun, if you could have anything on earth you wanted this very instant, what would it be?Marys eyes fell to her menu.
