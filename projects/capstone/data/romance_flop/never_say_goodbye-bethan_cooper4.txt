I grab some toast and shove it in my mouth, still trying to get my hand in my jacket sleeve.She turns and smiles at me.Hey, baby.She whispers.Hey, Mom, sorry Im going to be late.Ill talk to you later, okay?I mutter through toast.She smiles and waves goodbye.I do love that woman.I run down the hallway, struggling to hold the toast in my mouth, get my jacket on, and find my keys.I open the door and slam it behind me.I drive into town to find a clothes store.I spot one and park my ridiculously long, beautiful car.I wander into the shop.It takes me around five minutes to find what I need.I pay for it and put it into my trunk.I drive to school with the biggest smile on my face.I really hope he likes this.When I arrive at school, things just feel, well   different.I park my car, grab my bag off of the back seat, and get Luke's present out of my trunk.I put it in my bag carefully so that I dont ruin it.I put in my headphones, and while walking, find myself looking around the parking lot for Lukes car.I approach the entrance and look back.Everything looks clearer today.Everything looks beautiful.The trees swaying in the wind look beautiful, the dark grey sky above me looks beautiful.I smile and turn to walk into a familiar figure.I look up and smile.Pulling my headphones out, he pulls me to him and his arms hold my waist.Hi.I whisper.He pulls my hair away from my face and kisses me just below my earlobe.I giggle and struggle; I can feel his smile against my skin.Suddenly he pulls me so that we are running around towards the side of the school.We walk over the rubble, down a small gap, and he pushes me up against the wall.Luke, what the hell   I laugh loudly as he pulls back looking me up and down.He looks good today in a fitted white t shirt and dark denim jeans.This is very revealing.He whispers, his tone soft and seductive.His index finger outlines the neckline of my shirt, gently skimming the top of my breasts.I breathe out, not realizing I was holding it in.He moves forward so his body is pressed against mine, our noses are touching.You look hot.I whisper quickly and then look away, embarrassed.He pulls my chin back towards him so that our noses are again touching.As do you, Ellie, beautiful.He kisses me softly, no tongue, and pulls back.Thank you for my bracelet.I grin and raise my arm to show him.He puts his hand around my wrist and traces the bracelet, just as I was earlier.He leans down and kisses it gently.He looks up at me, with sorrow in his eyes.I wanted to help, yknow, with the scars.His voice reduced to a whisper, his index finger gently skimming over the faint white lines on the inside of my arm.Now I understand why.Luke, dont be stupid.I know they are there.I know.he sighs.But, maybe now you will be reminded of me and not of those bad memories.I smile at him, put my arms around his neck, and pull him toward me.His beautiful smell capturing my senses once again.Its such a lovely gesture.I look up at him and reach for my bag.And, I got you something too.I look down at my feet.Really?He asks, his tone now an excited one.Umyeah.I search my bag and hand him his gift.You asked for a new one.I say, smiling downwardly as he opens up the white t shirt.I wasnt being serious yknow, when I said you owe me a new one.He grins.I look up and catch his gaze.He pulls my chin and lightly grazes my lips with his.Thank you, Ellie.Lets try this on then shall we?He drops his bag to the ground, and pulls the hem of his t shirt over his head.Wow.I examine him.My muscle man.I pull my eyes away and look down, fumbling with my hands.You can look.He says as he pulls on the t shirt.It fits him perfectly and I cant believe he is going to wear it today.You dont have to wear it now.I blush.You bought this for me, I have to return the favor.He gestures toward my wrist and lifts my hand to his lips.We are going to be late.He whispers against my hand.We walk together, hand in hand, and I wouldnt change this full stomach, happy feeling for anything in the world.At lunch, I grab my usual sandwich and find a seat to gaze from.The lessons have gone so quickly this morning.My thoughts have been filled with a man desperate for me, who looks at me with such a beauty, like Im all he ever wanted.It feels good to be wanted, its a strange feeling.I dont know why, but when I spot Luke, I duck to hide, disrupting my reverie.I jump up and stand behind a pillar in the cafeteria.Hes with Jenna, shes holding his arm and he's looking down and smiling with her.I turn away, nervous that he might see me, but think twice about it.My subconscious makes me turn back to look.Just as I turn, he leans down and kisses her cheek.She turns and they lock mouths.No, no, no.The worst part is, is that Luke responds.It might just be for a second, but he kissed her back.The feeling of fear, adrenaline, and hurt floods my body and I think Im going to collapse.Luke pulls away from Jenna, and holds her at arms length.She looks angry but I cant concentrate with these tears falling down my cheeks.Is this betrayal?Is this it?One week of us?Of nearly falling head over heels?With those thoughts running through my mind, I watch Luke pull Jenna into an embrace.What is happening?Ella, you okay?Jades voice immediately relaxes me.I pull her into my arms and just cry into her shoulder.Hey, Ella, babe whats wrong?Come on, tell me?You were right.I mutter through tears.He doesnt want me, he never did, you were right, Jade.Come on then lets go.Jade grabs my hand and we leave school.She drives my car to town and we go for coffee.Eight      I sit in the caf, my coffee cup attached to my hand and my eyes transfixed on a painting of a bridge in Italy, or somewhere.My emotions are well and truly scattered.What do I do?Question it?Do I get angry?Was I just a problem that got out of hand?Was he just too scared to say no to me?I knew this was too quick.Ive lost it all before it could even really begin.He doesnt want me and thats whats hurting me.Am I overreacting?I have to be.Thinking deeply though, he hasnt really introduced me to anyone.He hasnt kissed me in public.That was my fault.He said he was going to.Ella, youre day dreaming, sweetie.Jade smiles at me.You really should try to ignore it, I know its going to be hard.But its only been a week, Ella.I look at her, my face ashen.I know, Jade, but in that week my life has changed.Its different.Hes been helping me.I opened up to him yknow?Now look what I fucking get.A broken heart.Is your heart broken, Ella, really?Yes.Why?Do you love him?I think I do, I havent said that I love him.We have only had one date but we have kissed so much and been caring with each other.We have even exchanged gifts.I laugh and Jade grabs my hand.Els, you do what you feel is right.Ignore me; I have no idea what you two have been up to.Have you slept with him?God, no!I look at her shocked.Just checking.She winks at me and her radiant smile makes me feel much more settled.I cant tell you what to do, Ella, but you are a sister to me and I dont want to see you hurt again.I know.I mutter.We finish our coffees and pack up to go home.I have a look at my cell, there a missed call and two text messages.*Hey, Ellie.Missed you today.Are you free tonight?Xxx*  *We need to talk.*  The first one was sent ten minutes before the second one.What the hell?Damn right we need to talk Mr.James.I reply.*Okay.*  Blunt and powerful.I put my cell back into my bag and I drive Jade home.I pull up outside her house, turn off my ignition, and breathe in.I love you, Ella, okay?You know that, right?Im always here for you.I know, Jade.I turn and smile at her.We sit side by side in my car and then the rain starts.Shit.Ill have to leave my car here.Jade, can I borrow your garage please?I cant drive this home in the rain and I can walk a few blocks.Sure, Ella, Ill open the garage for you.She knows why I cant drive it in the rain.It doesnt have a roof.I grab my bag from the back seat and give Jade a brief hug.I just want to get home.Its at least ten blocks from Jades house to mine.I stop to think, just for a second.What the hell has happened today?I can feel the emotion build again and tears are begging for escape, making my body heave.They blend in to the raindrops that have soaked my body through.I hold onto my stomach and let out a cry.It feels like its going to fall away.With bended knees and my face in my hands, I break all my love.I break it all off.I dont need him.I dont fucking need him.Before I know it, Im running.I reach a crossing and stop to breathe and steady my heart.A car is approaching and I stop to let it pass.The driver doesnt continue, so I start to cross.Ellie, get in the car!Luke yells.I turn to face him as he walks toward me.No!I shout and continue across the road.He grabs my arm and I yank it out of his reach.What, Luke?What do you want?He grabs me and pulls me against him, his body flush with mine, he kisses me with such urgency, a panic, and I give up fighting and fall against him.I pull away and catch my breath.My hands are in my hair, trying to understand but the tears just come.Why, Luke?Why?Why did you let her kiss you?Ella, how do you...?I saw, Luke, today at school.I was there.I saw you and her.I snarl.He pulls me against him and I pull away, hard.I told her no.Luke, I saw you, do you understand what Im saying?I saw!You kissed each other.I saw, Luke, I saw it all.I look down at the flooded pavement and shake my head.Dont lie to me.It wasnt like that, Ella.Youre being irrational.Im being irrational?Are you being serious?You kissed your ex, in a moment of intense lust.Then you held her!In the school cafeteria.My voice lightens.I cant do this.I raise my hands in defeat and he looks hurt.I scream into my hands and sob.It hurts.I cant stop it, it just hurts so much.How can he do that?Ella, she came onto me.I saw, Luke!You kissed her cheek and then you kissed.Your eyes were shut, Luke, you responded.You kissed her back, even if only for a second.You and your ex girlfriend shared a moment of passion.Get in the fucking car, Ellie.NO!Fine then, I'll put you in myself.Dont touch me, Luke.Ella, its fucking raining.Do you want to get hurt?Im not letting you walk home in this.I stop and stare at him.My breathing is heavy and I look at him in all his beauty.The white t shirt I bought him is clung to his muscles, his abdomen and V clearly defined by the rain.From nowhere I extend my arms and look to the sky.I let everything fall away.This is it.Ill always be lonely.When I look back, Luke is analyzing me.I walk up to him and kiss him.His arms curl around my waist and he kisses me back.His tongue fights with mine and I let go and run.He shouts after me but I cant do this.I only get what feels like a few steps away before Luke is behind me.He grabs me by my shoulders and I look up into his deep green eyes.His body soaked through with the rain, he looks longingly into my eyes.Ella, please dont say goodbye.I look away and his words cause my emotions to overload.His face is etched with worry, with regret.Our chests rise and fall fast in the cold and the rain.We were doomed from day one, Luke.We said it couldn't, it wouldnt work.We said that.I whisper.I dont love Jenna, I dont care for her.It was a moment of un clarity.A moment of stupidity.A moment I wish I could take back.Ella, please, let me kiss you.He holds my face and kisses my forehead, moving little kisses through the raindrops on my face, down to my cheeks and my nose.When his lips find mine, the connection, the electricity that binds us together tightens, we fall deeply into an embrace, and I cant help but cry.He pulls away softly and our foreheads lean against each other in the heavy, grey rain.Let me take you home, Ella.No.Ella, please    I want to see your house.He looks at me surprised but nods in agreement.As I tighten my seatbelt in the car, the warmth from the heater warms my blood that is running cold.I breathe out and turn to look at Luke.He really is soaked.A loud ring comes from the car speakers and startles me.Hello.Luke, its Dylan.Hey man I'm in the car and Im not alone, its on speakerphone.No problem, dude.Just thought you should know, Jenna is telling everyone you two are back together.I look across at him and turn away when his eyes meet mine.I look down at my fingers.Man, as I keep telling everyone, Im not with Jenna, Im with Ella.Oh shit, yeah I know.How is that by the way?Good old Ella Smella.Shes in the car Dy.You arent going to be friends calling her names.Sorry, Ella!he shouts.Thats okay.I whisper back.Dylan, Jenna isnt my problem anymore.We said goodbye today.Anyway, man.Ill talk to you later.Ive got a girl to deal with.Sure, man, see ya later.He hits the off button.Ill always be Ella Smella wont I?I whisper.Not to me, you never were to me.He looks across at me and smiles.You arent forgiven, just so you know.A small smile appears on his lips and he turns on the radio.We drive into uptown Charlotte and enter a garage attached to a very expensive looking building.On the side in big silver letters is The Madison.Whoa.When Luke parks, he switches off the ignition and we sit in silence for a second.Ella, I live here alone.I look at him puzzled and he laughs.Its one of my 18th birthday presents.I have a penthouse at this place.I look at him stunned.I wanted to meet his parents.He comes round to open my door and grabs my hand as we walk to an elevator.When it arrives, we step in and he inputs a code.I see what it is.234569.When it stops at the top, Luke puts his arm around my waist and escorts me in.I walk in to a large foyer that opens up onto the dining room.Its beautiful.With a full skyline of Charlotte, there is a terraced area outside, all glass and magical.I feel like a little child in a fun house.He gives me a quick tour of the basics and we go to sit down in the sitting area.There is a large white corner couch and a huge TV attached to the wall opposite.There is an Xbox, which surprises me.I go to pick up a controller and he tilts his head to the side.You any good?He asks.Depends what game.I tease.But Id much rather watch meaningless TV and kiss you.I shrug.Does this mean Im forgiven?Far from it, baby.I whisper.What do I mean to you?Am I yours?Or can I go kiss anyone I please?Ella, I want you, okay?Just you.I walk over to him and raise my head to meet his beautiful eyes.Stop kissing your exs then and we should be fine.This is a word of warning, Luke, okay?Im protecting myself.If you ever, ever hurt me like that again, I wont come back okay?He looks down at me, his eyes filled with wonder, and nods.I lean up and gently kiss his mouth.Can I see your room?I whisper against his mouth.He smiles and pulls me, which I assume is the way to his bedroom.I stop again to look in wonder.His room is pale blue with white pinewood features.It looks too adult for an eighteen year old.Im guessing you havent decorated this place since you moved in?Not had a chance really.But I like it in here.He looks over at me and sits on the huge four poster bed.I use that chance to invade his closet, which by the way, is as big as my bedroom.He has his own bathroom that has two sinks and a bath that could fit a huge fully developed whale in.When I come back in, he is standing looking out the window.I like the twinkling lights at night.He whispers.I walk over to join him and he curls his arm around my shoulders.I put my head against his arm.Its beautiful.I sigh.Youre so lucky to have a place like this.It was a gift from my dad.We are already in business together and I haven't even been to college yet.What does his business entail?He owns a lot of properties, he buys companies and sells them for a profit, and he has over a thousand car garages around the US.I think my dad works at one of his garages.In Charlotte?Yeah, I think so.Not sure, I know because he told me the other day, when I told him about you.Your dad knows about us?"Yeah, hes happy for me.I smile and he moves me backwards toward his bed.He pushes me gently and I fall backwards.I instantly sit up on my elbows, he moves his hand from my ankle, up my leg, and over the right side of my body, sending cold shivers throughout me.When he reaches my mouth with his, he hovers over, breathing hard against me.Luke, please kiss me.I suppress.He gently kisses my lips and works his way down the right side of my face.Gently kissing my cheeks and toward that sensitive place under my earlobe.He moves to kiss my neck, I groan with appreciation and feel his smile.We should really get you out of these wet clothes, baby, he whispers against my neck.Im all yours.Where the hell did that come from?That confidence.He needs to know of my virginity, but I cant find the words.I cant spoil this moment.Sit up, he commands and I comply.He slowly pulls my soaking wet vest top over my head so I am naked to my waist, only my pink bra covering me, and lays me back softly.My breathing is irregular; hes making me so anxious and excited, and such a desire, a want sweeps through me.He kisses me on my stomach with soft gentle erotic kisses, bites up my torso, and back to my mouth.My skin feels like its on fire.My back arches to his touch, my breathing stopping when he lets go.All my blood has risen to the surface and I ache for him and his touch.He gently kisses my mouth and looks at me deeply.We search each other, looking for what we want.The desire, the force, is too strong.I pull him close to me as I kiss and bite at his mouth, the desire in me wanting him, needing him.He gently pulls away and moves down my body.His index finger traces the outline of my jeans and he gently undoes the button and slides down the zipper.It reveals my lace pink underwear and he places his pinky finger on the inside and runs it along the surface.It makes my body shudder in response, and he pulls his hand away and abruptly sits up.Are you hungry?he asks, his head tilted playfully to the side.Yeah, are you?I whisper.Lets get take out and a watch a movie, huh?Um, sure, Luke, whatever you want.I watch as he stands up and puts his hand out for me to take.I take it and he pulls me off the bed so I fall into his arms.His arms fall around my waist and our naked torsos stick together with the dampness of the rain.Ella, he whispers.You are beautiful.All of you, you have captured me and I cant get out.I dont want to get out.Then dont.I whimper.He pulls away and looks down at me.I cant ever let you go, do you understand, Ellie?I cant explain why this has happened.Why its me and you, Im so sorry about Jenna.You werent meant to see that.We were saying goodbye.I said goodbye and told her I couldnt escort her to the prom at the end of summer.I told her that there was only one girl I wanted to take with me.One girl, who has actually taken me, caught my heart in her hands and I dont think she even knows.Luke   No, Els, let me finish.You have told me things you never thought you would tell anyone.You opened up to me about your hurt.About your life.About school and why it wasnt for you.Why nobody ever looked for you.Ella, I need to look for you.I am connected to you in such a way I cant explain.My life is supposed to be with you.We need to have each other, well, I need you.When Im with you, I feel like we are meant to be, I feel like I can do anything.Like I can become anyone.I feel such a need to be with you, Ella.I need to be with you.He slides a strand of hair behind my ear and I cant help but lean up and softly kiss him, my body shivering with cold, adrenaline, and love for this amazing man.He kisses me back softly and we fall backwards as the kiss accelerates.We fall toward the glass window and he lifts me so my naked back is against it.God, its cold.But I barely think about it.All I feel is this heat, this lust for Luke.He puts me down, and rests his hands on either side of my arms blocking me between him and the glass.Ella, spend the summer with me, fall with me.I dont know what will happen when college comes, but please, lets be us, I need us.Okay.I smile at him and he beams back at me.Youre freezing.Do you mind if I have a shower?Warm myself up a bit?Ill run you a bath, Ella, and I thought I warmed you up just now.He winks at me and pulls away.I watch him walk off, his jeans slowly dipped so I can see his underwear.Now that is a sexy look.I cant help but smile and watch.He turns around and catches me looking at him.Are you checking me out?He asks, and smiles at me.He wanders back over so he is hovering over me, not touching me.Want a bath?He asks seductively, our lips barely touching.My stomach feels like its about to implode on me, all of these mixed feelings swallowing me up.Sure, I Im okay, and yeah, maybe.I stutter and he gently kisses me.From nowhere, I grab his face in my hands and push him away.His hands are in my hair and I push him onto the bed.I climb onto him so I am astride his hips.Our bodies sink into the mattress as I kiss him, hard.I hold his hands on either side of him so that if he wanted to, he could break free.I sit up and lean forward to kiss his sternum and across his chest.I follow on from what he did to me earlier and I watch as his body comes to life with my touch.I work my way back up, kiss his beautifully sculptured jaw, and run my tongue along it.I hover over his mouth; our breaths caught with each other and kiss him.I bite his bottom lip and pull softly.He lets out a satisfying groan from somewhere deep inside him.I pull away and look into his eyes.I let go of his arms and he snakes them around me.Please don't hurt me, Luke, I know we can work.Please.He looks at me, his eyes scanning mine for something.Maybe acceptance?Truth?I promise you, Ellie, I wont hurt you, trust me.Forever and always.Forever and always?Forever and always, Ellie, my promise.I trust you.I move off him so as he can get up.Hows about that bath then?Sure.Oh shit, Ellie, do your parents know where you are?Ill text my mom.Its Friday, right?Shell be okay.Ill tell her Im at Jade's.You want to stay over?He looks at me worried, Im sure I know what about, but the inevitable will find us.If thats okay.I whisper.Absolutely.He whispers back and heads for the bathroom.Nine      Ill order take out for when you get out of the bath!He shouts from the bathroom.Chinese, Indian, or Pizza, Ella, your choice.Oh, my choice.I cant help but giggle inside.Pizza.I reply.Its yummy and its greasy.Pizza with chicken, if you dont mind.He wanders out and gazes at me, his jeans hung from his hips, he looks delicious.I dont mind baby, I like chicken on pizza.A smile appears from the corner of his mouth and he goes back into the bathroom.I take this moment to actually, really look at his room.He has no posters up and no typical teenage boy stuff around.This place is too adult for him.He has one single canvas photo on the wall opposite his bed.Its of him with his mom and dad.I grab my cell from my pocket and text my mom to tell her Im out for the night.She doesnt mind anymore because she knows I spend a lot of time at Jade's.When he appears from the bathroom, he comes and takes a seat next to me on the bed, draping a robe around me.Its so soft and warm.Thanks.I smile.You're welcome.Your bath is nearly ready.Already?Yes already, it fills up quick.He leaves the room.I wander over to the bathroom and it looks amazing.There are candles lit everywhere and even soft music playing in the background.I think the song is called Holding On and Letting Go.Its beautiful.The bath smells of strawberries and there are bubbles on the surface.I strip slowly and walk over to the bath.I leave the door unlocked, purposely.I know secretly, subconsciously, I want him to find me naked.In his bath.The water is warm and comforts my cold bones.I relax and listen to the music surrounding me; it really is fitting for the moment.I understand now what I want from Luke and what he wants from me.We need each other to function, without him I feel a weakness that wont shift, that cant shift.He makes me feel, well, happy.This is me, at happiness, and because that is such a rarity to me, it matters.A bind has been created between us, but I know that the inevitable will happen, and that at the end of summer he will leave me.We will have to end.Ella?In the bath.I shout back.Food wont be long.Okay.I miss you, want some company?Sure.I reply.He comes in, turns the music down, and sits opposite me on the edge of the marble looking bath.Mm, Ella, naked in my bath, he purrs and I cant help but feel something explode inside of me.Hey!I reply and throw bubbles at him.He laughs and splashes me back.I giggle at him, my man.You okay, Ella?Yeah, actually, I feel amazing.I sink my head under the water, embarrassed.When I rise back to the surface, I empty my ears of bathwater and push my hair from my face.Want me to shampoo your hair?Does it smell like men?I laugh.No, its a nice one I think.Thats fine then.I nod.He moves so that he is behind me and starts to gently shampoo and massage my head.It feels comforting and the tension and hurt from earlier is evaporating.The rain, the argument, their kiss, their embrace.His fingers work magic throughout me.I just feel, elevated, safe with him, and it makes me calm.This shampoo smells so good.He stops and I sigh.One sec, Ella.He mumbles as he leaves the bathroom.Hmm, where have you gone?I smile, I dont know where it comes from, but I smile, genuine and honest, and it turns into a grin.What is this?I hear Luke come back in and my smile subsides as he sits against the bathtub behind me.He has a jug in his hand and fills it with bath water.Put your head back, my mom used to do this to me when I was a kid.I comply and tilt my head back.Cute.I whisper and he rushes water through my hair.It feels so gentle and sweet, something he doesn't need to do but he does it because he can.Right now, I feel like Im wanted; a feeling that I have never physically experienced.The desire and need to feel like this has led me to him.His gentle hands are weaving throughout my hair as he applies conditioner.I moan in response to his expert hands and he copies his motions from before and pours water over my head.He finishes, pulls me back toward him, and kisses me under my earlobe.You are so beautiful, dont let anyone tell you anything else, you're perfect, Ella, he whispers against my neck.I dont know what this feeling is, but my body moves in response to his words.He stands, leaves the room, and I feel sad.Im suddenly flooded with dread and thoughts of pain.What is going to happen when it comes to college?What?So we spend one summer together and that's it?We both go to different colleges, different directions.What happens then?I just forget it?Luke pokes his head around the door and stares at me, admiring me.Foods here, Ill be in the living room, take as long as you need.I smile back at him and he leaves.What he doesnt know wont hurt him.I cry, quietly thinking about what this could be.My hands hide my face but I cant stop the tears.I breathe in slowly to try to control myself.I cant attach to someone again and end up broken.I just cant.I cant help this.Ive fallen already so deep, so longingly for him.I compose myself and shelter my body in a warm, surprisingly soft, fluffy, white towel.Once Ive dried my hair and myself, I change into one of Luke's t shirts that I found in his closet and borrowed some of his sweatpants.I look ridiculous, but at least Im warm.I pad along the cold, white tiles down the stairs toward his kitchen and smile at where I am, all my earlier thoughts hidden within me.I spot him sitting on the sofa on his phone looking so gorgeous I have to double take what I can see.He has the TV on and some program about cops is playing.Hi.I whisper and he looks up immediately to match my gaze.I look away in embarrassment.Hi, you look so cute in my stuff.He smiles and pushes his attention back to his phone.Mines still wet and I couldnt find it anyway.I shrug.Im washing and drying it for you, I hope you dont mind.No, thank you, thats nice of you.Why do I feel like Im talking to a stranger?Can I grab a drink?I ask.Of course you can.He looks up at me.Let me grab you one, soda okay?Yeah, sure.He jumps up and strides over to me.He grabs me and pulls me close to him.I release my tension and sag against him.He pulls me tightly into him and his face buries in my hair.Youre beautiful.Please, dont ever forget that.He whispers then releases me.I walk over to the couch and sit, looking longingly at the pizza in front of me.Wow, Im starving.I wont take a slice, just in case he thinks Im being rude.I look up at the TV and pretend to watch whatever the hell this is.I hear him walk back and breathe in deeply.I got you orange, I cant find any soda, hope thats okay.Of course it is.I smile at him.Pizza?He gestures.I thought youd never ask.I laugh and jump up to grab a slice.It tastes amazing and suppresses my appetite instantly.I moan in appreciation.Nice?He asks.Where the hell is this from?Most pizzerias around here are always late, or way too greasy.This is perfect.He laughs.The pizzeria down the road, they are amazing right?I always order from them.I finish my slice of pizza and gather my confidence.I reach over and take his cell from his hands.Ella, what are you  I place it on the table and find myself crawling over to him.I place my leg either side of his and look deeply into his eyes.Luke   My voice is shaking.I want you to be my first.He looks at me, his face etched with confusion.Ella, you're a virgin?Of course I am.His hands glide up the side of my body until they reach my face.He pulls me close and kisses me gently.He moves so that I am on top of him.Making out on the sofa, so clich, but so sexy.I kiss him as if my life and soul depended on it.Our tongues meet and embrace each other, making us desperate and wanting.I pull away and sit up.He follows suit.Ella, are you okay?He asks, his thumb tracing my lower lip.It makes my body growl.Luke, I, you might think this is stupid, but Im afraid that one day Ill wake up and you'll be gone, that you wont be mine.Because only in my dreams do good things happen, and then I wake up disappointed with reality.You're so great  youre the greatest thing thats ever happened to me.I don't want you to be gone, like the things in my dreams.I look down at my fingers and he lifts my chin so that I cant avoid eye contact.You speak such amazing words, Ella.I would never want this to end.You are my good dreams too.We kiss for what feels like hours when suddenly it escalates into something else.His hands begin to invade my body, his hands cupping me in areas no man has ever touched.I want this so much.He is all I could ever want.His hands and mouth continue their invasion, moans lost between pleasure and want.Gently, he lifts me and carries me to the bedroom, and with that, I know that this is it.This is Luke and I.   And I want him, I want us.Ten      He lays me gently on his bed and kisses me slowly and gently.I sit up and take off my top, revealing my body to him.He looks at me and I grab him and kiss him again."So beautiful. "He whispers against my mouth.He moves from my mouth down to my neck, does gentle kisses, and bites down my sternum.He kisses down the full length of my body, down my center, and works his way back up again.His breathing is hot and heavy against my lips.There is something I have never felt before and it's pooling hot in my stomach.His lips skim my skin and kiss across my collarbone.His tongue gently strokes out and licks every so often.My back bucks when he kisses under my ear, causing a seductive moan to escape from my lips.Where is this coming from?I can feel him hard against my leg through his underwear.I have an urge to flip him over and explore him, like he is with me.I thought this would hurt me but all I can respond to is my body.My blood has picked up profusely; my heart beating so hard it's causing my breath to falter.His fingers tickle against my ribs and I gasp when I feel his mouth over my breast.I can't control my back, it bucks again, and he licks and plays with my nipple.His left hand is playing with my left nipple and pleasure just consumes me.It feels so different to what I thought it would.My fingers twist through his hair and I pull gently.He makes a grunt; a sound that works its way from my ears straight to my groin.He lifts from my breast and looks down at my body.His eyes are dark, seductive."I've never felt this with a girl, Ella, only you.I want to taste every.Fucking.Inch. "As his fingers tickle down my ribs, his tongue works its way over my stomach.I know what he's going to do, I won't lie, and Ive seen porn.His eyes look to mine for acceptance and I nod at his unspoken question.Which Im sure would be, are you sure?His fingers hook under my panties and he pulls them down my legs, slowly, seductively.I feel his mouth on my breast once more, his tongue flicking my nipple.I almost don't realize his fingers are spreading me and he slowly slips one inside me.The feeling is, different.I know a finger is much smaller than he is, Im sure, but it still feels alien.As he works his finger in and out, I feel a sudden wideness as he inserts two fingers."Am I hurting you, baby?"He whispers against my skin."No. "I say breathlessly, almost inaudible.He is rubbing something with his fingers, which sparks electricity throughout my blood.It's like a trigger and it feels so good.His tongue stops playing with my nipple and his mouth meets mine again.His tongue works mine and we entangle in my pleasure together.His fingers have picked up speed, rubbing me hard now, causing seductive and pleasured tones to escape my lips.They come from nowhere.I try to hold them in, but I can't.I'm too lost in the moment.My body starts to build I can feel it.My legs start to ache and my skin is getting hotter by the second.Sweat is building in soft beads on my forehead.It just explodes, like desperation.My fingers grab the white sheet below me and I pull on them hard as my orgasm consumes me in its warmth.Luke's tongue slowly twists with mine and he takes my groans in his mouth.He rests his forehead against mine and closes his eyes."That was the sexiest thing I have ever seen, Ella.You're just pure ecstasy. "His lips meet mine again but I need more.My hand gingerly moves down and I trace the outline of his arousal with my fingers.He takes in a sharp breath, his eyes meet mine, lust piercing though.I could swim in just his eyes.That didn't hurt, he didn't hurt me, and I felt my first ever, pleasurable experience with a man.His thumb traces across my lower lip and I bite the pad."Fuck. "Luke gasps and grabs my arms and pins me to the mattress."Are you sure you're ready, baby?Are you one hundred percent, Ellie?I want to make love to you, but only if you want it too. "Do I want this?Yes, I do.I want to be with him, give my all to him."Yes. "He releases my arms and stands from the bed.He slowly removes his boxers and hovers over my body.His eyes never leave mine.I can see him in the corner of my eye putting on a condom slowly over his length.How the hell is that going to fit in there?His thumb collides with my clit and I struggle to breathe in.Yeah, Ive tried to masturbate before, but it was nothing like this.The feeling of his thumb rubbing soft circles is much, much more.I can feel him at my opening and he gently slides the tip in.Fullness.That's the only way I can describe it.His body shudders as he fills me completely and I know now I am definitely not breathing anymore.His soft voice fills my ear, "Are you okay, baby?Am I hurting you?"Is he hurting me?No, he's not.He's scared of hurting me, when all I want is him, I want us.I'm okay. "I whisper back and he begins to pick up his pace.His forehead rests on mine and the soreness eases away, replaced with pure pleasure, adrenaline.His palm is resting on my cheek and his lips just barely touching mine.His eyes clench shut every time he thrusts fully into me.My hips start to work of their own accord, meeting him thrust for thrust.The desire starts to pool again and I can feel it building.His groans become my adrenaline.His voice is so seductive, so endurable.He moves his forehead away from mine and his fingers grasp harshly into my hair.It just causes pleasurable pain.His lips kiss my neck and his breath is heavy against my skin."You're so beautiful, baby, my Ellie. "His words are my unraveling and I feel my blood spark to life, the ecstasy cursing through it radically, causing my body to shake and buck beneath him.Luke follows me shortly after calling my name in loud, seductive groans.If you'd have told me yesterday I'd be losing my virginity to Luke James, I'd have called you a liar.******    I awake to soft sunshine and Luke's arm wrapped firmly around my waist.I smile and remember last night, what it meant, what it means.I gently graze my fingers across his hand, across his arm, and feel him nuzzle harder against my back.I lift his hand, kiss his fingertips, and lightly bite his baby one.He groans and puts his head on my shoulder.Good morning, beautiful.he whispers and kisses my neck.Hi, I smile.I roll over so that I am facing him and his hand gently strokes my cheek, his thumb tracing my lower lip and he has a shy smile.How are you feeling?he asks.Yes, how am I feeling?I am okay.I feel....well.
