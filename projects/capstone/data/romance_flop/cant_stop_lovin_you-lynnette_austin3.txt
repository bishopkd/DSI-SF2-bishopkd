Because he missed the simple things.Friends stopping by.Easy evenings over a beer.People who cared.His mom spending the day with him, helping him paint his walls.Ten years ago, hed embraced Dallas.Had wanted big city.Now hed had it and was done with it.Dont I get a hug?he asked.The look she shot him could have frozen Lake Travis in thirty seconds flat.Dottie yoo hooed from below.Are you showing off your new paint, Brawley Odell, without inviting me?He chuckled.Not a chance, sweetheart.Were waiting on you.Come on up.He opened the door and held it while the three women filed in.Well, would you look at this.Dottie let out a small whistle.These old walls havent seen this much paint in the last century.Nice.Very nice.Very different.I like it.Maggie turned in circles, taking in the mix of colors.Her eyes fixed on his.Truth.Did you choose these shades?He glanced at his mom.I picked the pale gray.Mom decided we needed a touch of the dark to go with it.Good choice, Mom.Maggie gave her two thumbs up.I absolutely loved Annies colors.They fit her.The whole apartment did.It fit Sophie, too, after she put her own little touches on it.But this.This is right for you, Brawley.She turned another circle.Its strange to see it empty, though.The light fixtures, the vintage table Annie sanded and refurbished.All the little knickknacks.Gone.They werent me, Maggie.No, I dont suppose they were.This is temporary, but I might as well be comfortable while Im here.You could have come home, son.Youre always welcome.I know that.He laid a hand on his mothers shoulder.As much as I love you and Dad, thats not the best idea.Im too used to being on my own.And you and Dad are used to living your lives without me there.While Im sorry you dont have him, Karolyn, Im awfully glad hes here, Dottie said.For as long as he wants to stay.He should be handy to have around.His mom patted his cheek.Before I go, son, I have something in the car for you.Halfway out the door, she stopped.You need to promise to tell me if I start suffocating you.Oh, believe me, I will.His mother scurried down the stairs.Brawley looked at Maggie and Dottie.Both women simply shrugged.Karolyn was back in a flash, a huge box in her hands.Whats that?She opened the crate and pulled out a huge wreath.For your door.To celebrate spring.His mouth dropped open, and he took a step back.Mom, its covered in flowers.She squinted at it.Oh, my gosh.It is!Then she laughed at the horror struck expression on his face.He shook his head and stuck his hands in his back pockets.Men dont decorate their doors with flowers.Especially not Texans.Sure they do.She gave him a smacking kiss and hung the wreath.He winced.Shit!Hed have to hide the thing when Cash or Ty came around, then hang it back up before his mom showed up again.He glanced at Maggie and glowered at her grin.Before he could come up with a legitimate argument against it, a huge truck lumbered down the street.Brawley eyed it speculatively.Then, making out the movers logo on the side, he fisted his hand in an air pump.Yes!My furniture.Its here a day early.You want us to help?Maggie asked.No.The movers will haul everything up.Between starting the demo on the clinic last night, clearing Annies stuff out of the apartment with Cash this morning, then painting the rest of the day, Im bushed.Ill have them set the furniture in place and just stack the boxes anywhere they can for now.But we could Dottie started.Nope.Youve got a big event coming up this weekend, and Maggies got something special to show you.Why dont the two of you run along downstairs?Im in no hurry.When its all put together, Ill have everybody up for drinks.Some snacks.When his mother started back into the apartment, he shook his head, grabbed her by the waist, and turned her around.Youre leaving, too.Ive got a hunch your bodys chewing you out nearly as much as mine is me.Go.Get cleaned up and make Dad take you out to dinner.He gave her a kiss and herded her down the steps, then walked to the end of the drive to meet the movers.Finally.Once he had his things around him again, hed feel a whole lot better.Behind him, he heard Dotties cry of delight.My dress!Its not finished yet, but I want to see how it fits.He turned to see the two disappear inside and remembered how tired Maggie had looked when shed pulled in.Looks like the hours had paid off.Her unselfishness had made Dottie one happy woman.Brawley fished out his wallet and tipped the two men healthily.Job done.Then again, as he looked around the apartment, maybe he should make that job barely started.What the hell would he do with all this stuff?Everything had fit nicely in his Dallas place, a condo three times this size.Hed moved quite a bit of his furniture into storage.StillThis should prove interesting.First things first.Food.As the moving van headed off to Dallas, Maggie stepped out of Dotties, chatting a mile a minute.The gods had smiled on him.Had presented the perfect opportunity to grab Maggie for dinner.To take another small step toward making peace.Halfway downstairs, he called out to her.Hey, Red, its dinnertime.She made a production of checking her watch.Actually, its closer to a quarter past.Hah hah.You hungry?he asked.I am.Thought Id stop by Sallys and pick up a burger to eat on my drive home.I have a better idea.Im on my way out to grab something, too.Lets go together.Im not having dinner with you, Brawley.Why not?Youre hungry, Im hungry.Makes sense.Its not like Im asking you for a date.Loosen up.Loosen up?He walked down the last few stairs and closed the distance between them.Look, Im gonna be living here in Maverick Junction.From now on.When she opened her mouth, he laid a silencing finger on those luscious lips.I know youre leaving, but when you come back to visitand I know you willIm gonna be here.Your friends are my friends.We need to learn to coexist.Last night was a good start.Consider tonight a second tutoring session.She laughed.Oh, thats rich, Brawley.Youre going to teach me how to play nice?Guess you could say well learn from each other.Her eyes went a deeper shade of green.I dont know that you and I ever played nice with each other.Then maybe its time we started.She cursed the timing.If shed been five minutes sooner, shed have escaped this little scenario.Since Dottie stood at the kitchen window smiling at them, she probably shouldnt knee Brawley and take him down.Though damned if there werent still times she dreamed of doing exactly that.Make him hurt in the most elemental of ways.As she had.As she still did.Because of their shared friendships, she couldnt always avoid him.Like now.Shed rather eat dirt than a burger alone with Brawley, but hed trapped her.And he would pay.She narrowed her eyes.I want it understood this is against my better judgment.I wont enjoy this and neither will you.Understood.Lets go have an awful time.He held out his hand.Ill meet you there.Half an hour later, she had to swallow her words along with the burger.Although shed spent the better part of the day beating herself up for last nights shared kisses, here she was enjoying herself with him again.Shed forgotten how much fun Brawley could be.Had forgotten that rapier sharp wit.Hed led her to a small table at the back of the restaurant, speaking to everybody he passed, poking fun at himself, assuring them the animal clinic would be open again in a few days, and totally ignoring the speculative glances sent their way.After they sat down, Brawley asked, Dottie like the dress?She loved it.Its absolutely stunning on her.Figured it would be.Shes a good looking woman, and youre one hell of a designer.Winning combination.Sally brought them sweet teas without needing to ask.They ordered cheeseburgers and greasy fries.He pulled the lettuce off his the instant their waitress set his meal in front of him.Youre not going to eat that?Nope.Lettuce is good for you.Not on a hot sandwich, he groused.Maggie forked the lettuce and added it to her burger.You have some strange habits, Brawley Odell.Possibly, he conceded.How many will be at this shindig on Saturday?Maggie shook her head.A whole lot more than wed originally planned.Dottie and Fletch decided on an intimate family wedding.As it turns out, practically the entire town wants to come, and everybody assumes hes invited.So small and intimate has shifted to large and complicated.Exactly.And thats okay.Its only fitting that all of Maverick Junction and half of Lone Tree celebrate with them.Maggie took a bite of her burger, her tongue sliding out to lick a speck of mayonnaise from the corner of her mouth.Brawley breathed deeply and wrestled his overactive libido to the ground.For the town, its an opportunity to get dressed up and party.Pops and Dottie arent exactly your typical bride and groom.Because?Well, theyremore mature.Theyre in love with each other, not in lust like most newlyweds.In other words, you dont think theyll be falling all over each other?Brawley!Were talking about my grandfather.Yeah?So this isnt young love with all the hearts and flowers.Not that Dottie doesnt deserve the romance.Oh, I think theyre doing okay in the romance department.She laid down her sandwich.What do you mean?Oh, boy.Now hed stepped in it.He sipped his tea, giving himself a minute.Forget I said anything.How am I supposed to do that?Come on, Mags.Youre a big girl.You know what goes on between couples.She grimaced.He laughed.He couldnt help it.Theyre older, not dead, sugar.Theres still plenty of heat.Slowly, she shook her head.I dont even want to know how you can be so sure.He popped a fry in his mouth.This is a ridiculous conversation, she said.Your grandfather stopped by for a booty call after you left last night.She choked.Oh, geez.He made to pat her back, but she elbowed him away.I was at the window when he came out, all mussed, shirt half unbuttoned, and barefoot.The two of them shared a real nice kiss before he got in his truck and drove away.Believe me, sweetheart, theirs is not a platonic relationship.I never said it was.Good.He swirled another fry in ketchup.Please tell me they werent rolling around naked in the garden.In the garden?No.She pressed her fingertips to her eyes as if blocking the visual.After a full minute of silence, she threw him a wobbly smile.Im happy for him.For both of them.Its a good thing.It is.He crunched his pickle.Sad state of affairs, though, when an octogenarian is getting more than I am.Yeah, isnt it?She grinned wickedly.More than ready to leave the topic behind, he asked about Ella.Hows she working out?He questioned Maggie about her plans once she hit New York, she asked about his for the clinic.Any trace of awkwardness disappeared.He finished his fries and started on hers.She slapped his hand away.Eat your own.I did.He pointed at his empty plate.Theyre gone.Sally didnt give me as many as she gave you.Bull.Order some more.Nah, Im okay.Lightning quick, he grabbed a couple more of hers.Okay, so Ive heard the company line.He quirked a brow.About what?The clinic.I know what youre telling everybody, but will your doors open on time?Yep.I had a crew working today.Cash and Ty are gonna meet me there tomorrow.Sos my dad.If we put in a couple long days, well make it.What all are you doing?Out front, not too much.A little reorganization of the reception area, some sprucing up in the exam rooms.You know, slapping some paint on the walls, new flooring.Most of the changes are in the back.Were doing some work in Docs office.Knocking out a closet, enlarging the bath, sticking in a shower.Whoa!A shower?That sounds pretty major to me.Dotties place is great, and I love the claw foot for soaking.But a man cant live without his shower.After a day working with animals, I can be pretty grungy.With a tub, I feel like Im soaking in my own dirt.I need to wash it away, right down the drain, and Id prefer to do it before I leave the clinic.Makes sense.Want to stop and take a peek at what weve done so far?Im dying to, but I need to get home.Tomorrows another busy day.Between planning this weekends wedding, training Ella, and getting everything ready before I head to New York, Im meeting myself coming and going.They argued over the check.Its not a date, she reminded him.Therefore, I pay for my own meal.Its two friends At her raised brows, he backtracked.Its two old acquaintances sharing dinner.If one wants to pick up the others tab, why not?Youre impossible.My moms told me that a time or twelve.He walked her to her car.Before she could open the door, he snaked an arm around her waist and pulled her to him.When his mouth came down hot and hard on hers, she shocked him by rising on tiptoes to meet him.She melted into his kiss.It had been so long and felt so good.So right.When he lifted his head and stepped back, Maggie blinked.The world tilted, shook, then resettled.Why did you do that?she whispered.Im a starving man, Maggie Sullivan.Ive been aching to taste those lips again.That mouth.Thats your definition of friendly?She fought to get her breathing under control.Not yours?No.Dont guess it was.He tucked his hands in his pockets.Reaching behind her, she opened the car door and slid in.If her hands shook when she inserted the key into the ignition, it was because she was tired.It had grown late and shed had a long day.It had nothing whatsoever to do with the man standing beside her car, watching her like a cat.Nothing to do with that kiss hed just planted on her.Nothing to do with the hunger hed ignited.Damn him to hell and back.Eight  Radio blaring, windows down, and the wind whipping through her hair, Maggie wondered at the wisdom of keeping her shop open.Barely noon and here she was on the road to Maverick Junction again.Shed driven this stretch of highway so many times this past week, her car could probably make the trip without her.Her mind raced.So many things to think about, decisions to make.The shop and Pops.Even her mare.Staring out at the open range on either side of the highway, Maggie realized how much shed missed riding Duchess.Shed taken her out every day when she lived at home.Then shed moved in with Pops and, even though it had about killed her to be separated from the horse, Maggie had left her with her folks.Her original plan had been to drive over to her parents after work several times a week and take Duchess for a run.That hadnt happened.She hadnt counted on the long hours it would take to start up a business.To make it successful.Now, with the move to New York coming up, her horse would get even less exercise.It wasnt fair to Duchess, one of the best barrel racers in Texas.Theyd won medals galore.How long had it been, though, since theyd competed?Six months?A year?Geez.Maybe shed ask Ty if he wanted her.Shed make a good ride for Sophie.Maggie grinned.Sophie.City slicker through and through, shed started to settle into Texas ranch life.She didnt spook every time a cow lowed or a bull raised its head to drill her with those bloodshot eyes.She still couldnt fish worth a darn, but Maggie figured there were worse crimes.Spotting the side road to Cash and Annies, she slowed and made the turn.Annied called early this morning, wanting her input on some wedding centerpiece ideas before she showed them to Dottie.When Cashs log house came into view, Maggie sighed.She always didevery single time she visited.Hed built it himself on the edge of his grandfathers land.A lake backed up to the house and lent a serene air.Flawless.Lucky Annie.Shed won not only Cashs heart but got to wake up here every morning as a bonus.And Maggie couldnt be happier for her.As she slid from behind the wheel, Brawley limped around the corner of the house.Maggie gawked at him.Youre missing half your pants.He looked down at the gaping hole in the denims, a sheepish expression on his face.Had a bull who wanted to get a little too friendly this morning.You could have been hurt.Would you care?Of course I would.She paused.I like your mama, and shed have been brokenhearted.Youre a hard woman, Maggie Sullivan.She shrugged.He didnt really hurt you, did he?Nah.Dinged my pride a little, thats all.I didnt deal with many bulls in Dallas.Got careless.So why are you limping?Lot of weight behind him.Left a bruise.No big deal.He waggled his brows.On the other hand, maybe it does hurt some.Want to kiss it?Make it all better?In your dreams.Yeah.He sighed.Figured thats how youd feel.A customer of mine said to tell you thanks, by the way.Oh?Seems you recommended she take her scraggly looking mutt to Dawn Marie to be groomed.Let me tell you, she did one heck of a job.I barely recognized Farley.He looked ten times better than the last time she brought him to the shop.A cocker spaniel?Yes.I remember him.Mrs.Wilson needed a miracle, and Dawns the best.She is that.Maggie slid her sunglasses on top of her head.So what are you doing here?Last I checked, there wasnt any livestock here.No.As much as our Annie loves the horses, I dont think shed stand for them grazing in the front yard.Maggie wished Brawley would take off his dark shades.They added to his hot, sexy attitude, but they hid his eyes, and that left her uneasy.Cash and I rode a couple of his horses over.Im thinking about buying one now that Im gonna be here.Which one?Black Jack.She closed her eyes.The huge black stallion.Magnificent animal.You couldnt make a better choice.Thats what Im thinking.Now that Ive ridden him He spread his hands.What can I say?Love at first sight.She nodded.Im trying to figure out what to do about Duchess.Why?Duh.Im leaving.I wouldnt sell your horse yet.Give yourself time.Take things in steps.It doesnt seem fair to her.Even being here, its been so long since Ive taken her out for a ride.She sighed.There are never enough hours in the day.Ill see she gets exercised.I cant ask you to do that.You didnt.I volunteered.You need to let your dad know, though.Hed love the chance to shoot me and chalk it up to horse thievery.She rolled her eyes.Hey, just saying.Cash and I thought wed try to sweet talk Annie out of lunch.Annie stepped through the open sliders just then.Surprised registered on her face.Hey, Maggie.Brawley.What?Maggie asked.Nothing.Not used to seeing the two of you together without weapons drawn.Very funny.What happened to you?Annie stared at Brawleys torn jeans.A little accident.Im fine.Before Annie could grill him anymore, Cash rounded the corner and leaped onto the deck.Hey, beautiful.He swept Annie into a lusty kiss.In case youve forgotten, weve got an audience, Annie managed when she caught her breath.I didnt forget.Cash lifted his head.Thought Id give my pal Brawley some pointers.Figure he must need them.That would be the day, Brawley threw back.He sent a sideways glance at Maggie.Dont even think about it.She planted a hand on his chest.We could show them how its supposed to be done.Her tongue flicked out, and she shook her head.No, we couldnt.She dared a glance at Cash.Call off your dog.He frowned.Staubach?No, this one.She jerked a thumb at Brawley.At exactly that instant, Staubach came tearing around the corner.He made a flying leap, catching Brawley waist high.One slurping kiss aimed at his face, he did a U turn and headed toward Annie and Cash.Stop, Cash ordered.The dog paid no heed, barreling into them and nearly knocking Annie off her feet.She laughed and knelt to rub the dogs lopsided head.Youre a good boy, arent you?The dog, in total ecstasy now, rolled over, legs in the air, to have his belly rubbed.Annie succumbed.Damn dog gets more attention than I do, Cash muttered.Oh, thats so not true.Annie stood and made a pretense of rubbing Cashs belly.A little lower, honey.She leaned in and nipped his neck.Ouch.Annie feigned innocence.Something wrong?Nope.He nibbled at her lower lip.She gave him a gentle push.Youre so bad.Motioning to Brawley and Maggie, she said, Come on in, guys.Get washed up, and Ill set out some lunch.Afterward Maggie and I have some business to attend to.Business?Brawley frowned at Maggie.Wedding business.Ah.Brawley took Maggies hand in his and led her up the walkway.She tried to convince herself the tingles that ran up her arm and made their way through her were simply her imagination.It didnt work.Immune to Brawley Odell?No way, no how.But shed ignore both him and the effect he had on her.Another week and shed be gone.Brawley followed Cash inside.Bringing up the rear wasnt really all that bad.When you had two women like Maggie and Annie in front, the scenery proved pretty darned good.First class, in fact.He stopped in the foyer.Damn, Cash.Every time I walk in this place, Im amazed all over again.Youve done yourself proud.I have, havent I?Hands on hips, Cash swiveled to take in the view.His gaze stopped on his new wife.House isnt bad either, is it?Brawley laughed.Maggie shook her head.Oh, youre a smooth one, Cash Hardeman.He thinks itll earn him an extra piece of pie.Annie ran a hand through her hair and grinned.He might be right.Pie?You made pie?Maggie stared at her as if shed grown a second head.From scratch?Its sort of my new hobby.Ive been trying out different recipes and playing with the crust.My mom would die if she saw the mess I make.Butmy kitchen, my mess.My wife.Cash kissed her forehead, then swept off his hat and tossed it on the couch.Brawley carefully set his on a table in the foyer.He didnt consider himself superstitious, but still.No sense asking for trouble.You set your hat brim up, not only did you keep it in better shape longer, but if a little good luck passed by, rumor had it the hat would catch it.Right now, he figured he could use all the luck he could get.Cash, on the other hand, was on a real winning streak.Brawley had never seen his friend happier.His gaze slid to Maggie dressed in well worn, skin tight denims and a silky little top.His mouth watered for more than Annies pie.So, yeah, he could use some luck.Do you mind if Maggie and I look at a couple of these centerpieces before we eat?Annie called from the study.Good with me.While you do that, Brawley can take a peek at the info I have on a couple bulls Im considering.Give me his opinion.Cash laughed and yanked at the torn denim flap on Brawleys jeans.Hes an expert on bulls.You think I might borrow your horses after lunch?Cashs forehead creased.Sure.Anytime.What are you up to?Nothing.Thought maybe Id talk Maggie into a quick ride.She told me earlier she hasnt taken one for a while.A ride?Thats the only thing on your mind?Brawley glanced toward where the women sat huddled over sketches of floral arrangements, studying them as though they meant the difference between life and death.Yeah, he answered.A ride.Cash moved to the fridge, grabbed two Cokes, and tossed one toward Brawley.As he caught it, Cash snapped his own open and took a long drink.His eyes never left Brawleys.Weve been friends a long time.Brawley nodded.You know I love you like a brother.I do.Maggie means the world to me, too.Understood.Brawley chugged his own soda.You cant hurt her again.I dont intend to.You dont intend to, Cash repeated.That leaves a lot of open ground.Brawley didnt flinch.I can tell you what you want to hear.I can stand right here in your kitchen, with the scent of Annies fresh baked pie in the air, and promise not to hurt Maggie.Again.But you and I both know life doesnt come with guarantees.None of us can see into the future or know for certain what will happen down the road.A muscle ticked in Cashs jaw.You werent there to see what your leaving did to her, Brawley.You didnt hold her while she cried.For you.For the future you destroyed when you told her you werent coming back.No, I didnt.Was I scum for the way I handled that whole thing?Without a doubt.Even though my intentions were good, I was careless with Maggie, and I hurt her.He rubbed the back of his neck.If I could go back, do it over, it would never have gone down that way.But you cant, Cash said.No, I cant.I sure as hell can try to repair whats left between her and me, though.I want to do that.Shes leaving.Why not just let it be?Because, pal, its eating a hole in my gut.He set his soda on the counter.Can I borrow your horses?Easy question.Yes or no.Oh, hell.Of course you can.But Brawley?Yeah?Dont make me hunt you down like a coyote on the prowl.Brawley nodded.They gave the girls another ten minutes.Geez, how long could it take to decide between pearl white, soft white, or antique white ribbons for the bridal bouquetand what the hell difference did it make?Should we start whining about how hungry we are?he finally asked.I dont know about you, but I wouldnt have to fake it.Thought Annie said a few minutes.Cash raised his voice a little.Im famished.My wife sent me off to work without breakfast.Thats because you had other activities on your mind when you woke up this morning, Annie said from the other room.Yeah, I did, didnt I?Annie laughed.You werent complaining about the lack of food when you headed out the door.In fact, if I remember correctly, you had a mile wide smile on that smug face of yours.Brawley grinned, thinking Cash looked pretty damned pleased with himself even now.Annie stood when they moseyed into the dining room.Think we should feed these two?Since Im hungry, too, Ill vote yes.Maggie pushed back her chair, then ran a hand through that glorious mass of red curls.Brawley found another appetite whetted.Whats for lunch?Sandwiches and pasta salad.As Annie started pulling things from the fridge, she said, Sorry, guys.Meant to do lunch first, but I showed Maggie one of the pictures, and, well She shrugged.Lunch will be on the table in no time.Sure enough, inside five minutes, they relaxed on the back patio, the sun warming their backs, eating egg salad sandwiches and pasta salad, and eyeing huge slices of still warm apple pie.Staubach sprawled close, tail thumping against the deck, one eye open in case anything remotely edible fell.Brawley kicked back in his chair and studied the lake with its clear blue water, a few birds skimming its surface.Behind him, pots of geraniums and daisies brightened the log home, Annies mark, no doubt.He envied his friend this piece of paradise.His stretch in Dallas had been like time out of time.Hed lived well there.Sowed more than a few wild oats trying to dislodge Maggie from his mind and heart and never quite succeeding.Now, he was done trying.This, right here, was what he craved.Across from him, Maggies ivory complexion fairly glowed.She slathered blocker on it constantly and stayed out of the sun as much as possible.The bane of a redheads existence.That sun glinted off her red curls and created a halo effect.Talk about deceptive.Maggie?An angel?Not likely.His Maggie was real.As red blooded as they came.She popped the last bite of pie into her mouth and licked her lips.Incredible, Annie.She pointed her fork at her now empty plate.You ought to enter this in the fair.Seriously?Absolutely.Youll win hands down.And wouldnt that send Ruby Dunst into a tailspin?Cash asked.She still winning every year?Brawley asked.Cash nodded.I dont want to make anyone angry, Annie said.And theres my opening.Brawley shot to his feet, held a hand toward Maggie.Im sure you dont want to make anybody mad, either, sugar, so come take a ride with me.Excuse me?One side of his mouth kicked up in a grin.Cash says we can borrow his horses.Youre dressed for it, so lets see what youve still got.I can sit a horse better than you any day, Brawley Odell.Prove it.Maggie stood, started for the door, and stopped.I need to help clear lunch first.Annie shooed her away.Ive got this.My helper here She tipped her head at Cash.Works cheap.Stay away at least an hour.Cash winked at Brawley.Give my wife and me some time.Im awfully tired.Think I might need a nap.Annie swatted him.Hands to yourself, big boy.Not in this lifetime.He grabbed her around the waist.Time for us to skedaddle and give them some privacy.Brawley grabbed Maggies hand and pulled her behind him.Mistake.Big mistake.The words played in a loop in Maggies mind as she walked beside Brawley.Too close.His hip brushed hers.His thumb rubbed across the back of the hand he held, sending frissons of electricity shooting through her.She didnt like this man.He was bad for her.Hed cost her more than she could ever admit, even to herself.And still, she found herself attracted to him.She needed to keep her distance.That was out of the questionphysicallyright now.But she could hold her emotions in check.Could recite all the wrongs hed done her.Theyd carry her through a ride to Dallas and back.Yet when they reached the horses, she couldnt regret going along with him.It had been so long.She rested her head on the roans and cooed to her, ran a hand down the horses flank.Arent you beautiful, Indigo Girl?You and Duchess would like each other.Yes, you would, she soothed.You going to let me take a ride?Hmm?She placed her booted foot in the stirrup and swung herself up into the saddle.Beside her, Brawley mounted Black Jack in one smooth move.He clucked his tongue, and the stallion took off at a canter.Maggie followed, smiling at the wind on her face, in her hair.Better, far better than in any car, convertible or not.She and Indigo settled into a rhythm beside Brawley and Black Jack.Hed chosen well.The horse suited him.Both dark and brooding.Both handsome, brilliant specimens.They rode over the range without speaking.Maggie gave herself up to the moment and simply enjoyed.Brawley finally pulled on the reins, slowing Black Jack to a trot.They rode into a meadow, bluebonnets rioting around them.He stopped and dismounted.Letting the reins trail, he turned to Maggie and held out his arms.She hesitated.Youre safe with me, Maggie.Said the serpent to Eve.He had the good grace to laugh.Seriously.Come on.I can get down from a horse without I know youre a liberated, independent, self sufficient woman, Red.I know you can dismount.Hell, Ive seen you do it a hundred times.Remember all those rides you, Cash, and I took?We rode for hours on end.We had fun, didnt we?We did.His hands still reaching for her, he said, So just this once.Let me help you down.I wont tell a soul.She punched him on the shoulder but leaned into him.His arms closed around her, lowering her very slowly to the ground, sliding her along the length of his very hot, very hard body.By the time the toes of her boots touched the earth, she could barely breathe.Brawley He shook his head.Uh uh.No serious talk.He pulled a blanket from his saddlebag and shook it out.Lie here with me for a few minutes.Wont the horses wander away?Nope.This is a test.Cash insists theyre trained for ground tying.Drop the reins, and theyll stay put.And if they dont?Brawley held up his phone.We call the cavalry.Dropping onto the blanket, he took her hand and gave it a tug.Come here.His voice sounded husky.This is a bad idea.No.Two friends, beautiful weather, wildflowers blooming.Dont overthink this.Just enjoy.Im not gonna bite.Biting isnt exactly what Im worried about.I didnt bring you out here to seduce you, sugar.Heat flooded her face.I love it when you blush like that.She threw her hands over her cheeks.One of the curses of a redhead.Giving in, she relaxed onto the blanket.She lay back and stared up at the sky.It is a gorgeous day, isnt it?This is one of the few times weve been totally alone together since Since you threw me back like a fish that didnt measure up?He winced.Thats not what happened.She raised herself on one elbow.Its exactly what happened.I can explain.I dont want you to.She stuck her fingers in her ears.La, la, la, la, la.Brawley sat, turning his back on her.He plucked a dandelion, then a second and a third, threading them together to make a dandelion bracelet.He wrapped it around Maggies wrist.Tears burned the backs of her eyes.How many times had he done this when theyd been kids, then teens?Damn his sorry hide anyway for ruining something so special.Before she could stop herself, she leaned into him to buss his cheek.He turned his head at the last second, met her lips instead.The kiss, hot and deep, full of passion and memories, sizzled.Maggie wondered they didnt set the blanket on fire.Just as suddenly, he pulled back, clearing his throat.Think weve given Annie and Cash enough time for their afternoon delight?Cheeks flaming, she nodded.His hands touched those cheeks, cooled them.He brushed a wild tendril behind her ear.I miss you, Maggie.Im sorry, Brawley.She found Indigo Girl waiting patiently, just as Cash had promised.Catching the reins, she mounted, watched while Brawley did the same.Then, with a light tap of her heels on the mares flanks, she galloped away, Brawley right behind her.They rode back in silence.Her eyes caught on the silly dandelion bracelet Brawley had put on her wrist, and she steeled her heart against the feelings that fought to break free.She couldnt go back to the time when this man beside her was her world.Shed worked too hard to move past that.Worked too hard on her dreams, which didnt include him.Not any longer.In a few short days shed be winging to New York City.She had to stay focused.Forget the kiss that hadnt really been meant as a kiss.It had been more of a fluke.An accident.Annie, snuggled into her husband on their porch swing, waved when she and Brawley rode into the yard.Cash stood, settled his Stetson more firmly.Howd Black Jack do?Since we havent talked price yet, I should tell you hes okay.Not bad.A grin lit Brawleys face.But I cant.Black Jack is a creature of beauty, and Ive absolutely got to have him.You wont do any better, pal.I know.This little sweetheart, he pointed at Indigo Girl, is something else, too.If I hear of anyone looking for a roan, Ill pass it on.Appreciate it.Cash planted one last smoldering kiss on Annie before he and Brawley headed to the stables.Wow, Maggie said.Who knew Cash had all that in him?Annie chuckled.Lucky me, huh?You bet.Did you and Brawley have a nice ride?We did.And thats all you plan to say about it?It is.How about a glass of iced tea, then we can get back to whittling down Dotties choices so shes not overwhelmed?Bitsy will need to know today, though, so she can order the flowers.While they poked through the photos of floral arrangements, an ache started in Maggies heart.She had to be more careful.She couldnt be alone with Brawley.Her heart couldnt take it.The man was addictive.She couldnt have a single taste, a single crumb, without wanting more.And more would be bad.More would be a disaster.More would be her downfall.Nine  Brawleyd put in a long day.The temperature had spiked to near eighty, and his shirt stuck to him.First thing tomorrow hed call and get the AC people to check the unit at the clinic.It was probably as old as doc.How the staff had put up with it all this time was beyond him.He still had to run out to his parents before he could go home and put his feet up.His mind on the drive to his folks place, Brawley strode past the Maverick Junction Daily just as the door flew open.Maggie collided with him.He automatically reached out to steady herand found himself with his arms full of beautiful woman.Dressed in a flirty little sundress and sandals, her hair hanging loose, she did things to his insides.What the hell?He might as well take advantage of the situation.When opportunity knocked His head dropped to her hair, and he sniffed.You do smell good, sugar.Strawberries and sunshine.Let go of me, Brawley.In a few seconds.Now.She kept her voice low.Were making a spectacle of ourselves.That didnt used to bother you.Didnt used to, she repeated.That was a long time ago.Now let go.Ive grown up.He chuckled.Give me another minute.What Ill give you is the count of five.Her right leg moved slightly so that it rested between his.He grinned, till he realized shed lined her knee up perfectly with his family jewels.The expression on her face assured him it was no accident.To passers by, it would look so innocent.A smile curved one side of her lips.It never wavered as, her voice low, she said, One one thousand, two one thousand, three Her knee inched upward with each count, and damned if there wasnt a twinkle in her eye.The little spitfire would take him down.She had before.But damned if hed be unmanned right here on Main Street.Out of the corner of his eye, he glimpsed Mel at the window.No doubt he understood exactly what was happening.He was every bit as sure his good friend wouldnt lift a finger to help.Brawley dropped his hands and stepped away.And didnt the smug she devil raise her hands above her head like a boxer in the ring whod scored a knockout.Youre a mean one, Maggie.She shrugged.Thats what happens when a girl has two ornery boys for playmates growing up.Youre the one who taught me that move, by the way.It was for protection, he growled.In case you found yourself in a bad situation.I just did.Bull.He scowled, and she tipped her head back and laughed.Ivy Dickerson and Luanne Edwards stopped across the street.Ivy whispered something to Luanne, and Brawley waved at them.Both women hurried into Sallys Place.He turned his attention back to Maggie.Thought you hired Ella for the shop.I did, and shes working out great.So why are you here again?A quick glance toward the window confirmed that Mel had disappeared.The traitor was probably at his computer gleefully composing a story for tomorrows edition about Maggie taking him down.Hed be disappointed to learn it hadnt happened.Checking Mels progress.Hes printing the napkins and place cards for tomorrows wedding.With Dottie and Gramps in such a rush, were running right down to the wire.Everything coming along okay?You bet.Other than a quick stop at Dotties, Mels last on my to do list.Good.He caught her hand.Ride out to my parents with me.I need to pick up Dads sander, and Id like some company.His sander?I found this incredible desk at an antique shop outside Dallas.But its in desperate need of refinishing.You continue to surprise me, Mr.Odell.I would never have guessed you refurbished clinics, let alone furniture.Im a man of many talents, sweetheart.Yeah, Ill bet.Tell you the truth, though, Ive been running all day and didnt take time for lunch.Im starving.She laid a hand on her stomach, drawing his eyes to her flat abs, tiny waist, and curvy hips.Come with me.It wont take long.On our way home, well stop at Bubbas, he drawled.Ill treat you to a big old steak.She sighed.I should probably stick with a salad.Startled, he lifted his eyes to hers.A salad?You?He laid a hand on her forehead, and she knocked it away.Cut it out, Brawley.Since when do you eat rabbit food?Since Im moving to New York.What the hell?He stared at her.Excuse me if I dont see the connection between the two.Im going to be surrounded by model thin women, she wailed.Ill stand out like a sore thumb.Surprise rattled through him.Damned if she didnt mean it.He read a touch of insecurity in those extraordinary green eyes.Wrapping one hand around the back of her neck, he massaged it with his thumb.Honey, youre right.You will stick outthe way one of Englands crown jewels would stick out in a box of coal.She dropped her head and studied a weed protruding through a crack in the sidewalk.Dread pummeled him.She hadnt even left Maverick Junction yet, hadnt made the move to New York, and already it was changing her.He put a finger beneath her chin and raised her face level with his.Maggie, sweetheart, dont do this to yourself.Dont let them change you, who you are.Youre stronger than that.Youre unique, and theyre gonna love you because of that.She pressed her lips together, then nodded.I dont know about them loving me, but youre right.I am who I am.Lets go get that sander, then Im going to order the biggest steak Bubbas got.Good girl.Just a sec.She stuck her head in the newspaper office.After Mel assured her everything would be ready on time, she walked with Brawley to his SUV.As she slid in, his gut worried that Maggie hadnt really bought in to what hed said.That she was only giving lip service to it.When his mom opened the door, she gave a happy little cry and wrapped Maggie in a hug.What a nice surprise.Come on in, honey.She grinned at her son.Nice to see you, too, sweetie.Brawley shook his head and followed the women inside.The house, quiet and cool, comforted him as always.Torey, his mothers Siamese cat, came around the corner and wound between his legs.He leaned down and scratched her head.Dad said you were dropping by.What are you sanding, Brawley?An old desk.Do you need help?Nope.I think Ive got this.Good for you.Youll stay for dinner, wont you?I made plenty.Unless the familys getting together tonight, Maggie.No.Dotties kids and grandkids flew in today, and theyre planning a quiet dinner at home, resting up for tomorrow.Dad and Mom went over to Lone Tree to spend a few hours with Gramps.Brawley met Maggies eyes, and she nodded.Bye, bye Bubbas steaks.Sure, he told his mom.Were both starving.Wheres Dad?In his study.Why dont you go get what you need, then drag him in here for dinner.Everythings ready.Maggie helped Karolyn set the table while Brawley and his dad went out to the barn to find the sander.Dinner smelled heavenly, and Maggies stomach rumbled.She laughed.Sorry about that.I skipped lunch today.You have a lot on your plate right now, dont you?Sure do.You could have knocked me over with a feather when I heard about Dottie and your grandpa.Karolyn fished some crackers from the pantry and arranged them on a small platter.She added some sliced cheese.Here you go.Nibble on this while we wait for the guys.Thanks.The cheese took the edge off her hunger.Karolyns cheerful yellow and blue kitchen hadnt changed much since Maggied last been here.It felt almost as much like home as her own did.She wandered to a wall covered with photos.Karolyn and Traces wedding picture, Brawley as a baby, then on his first horse.Him and his dad fishing.Christmases, Thanksgivings, birthdays.A proud mamas wall.A strong family.Maggie studied Brawleys high school graduation picture.So young and handsome in his cap and gown.It had galled her that shed be back in high school the following year while Brawley and Cash went off to college.But shed been confident, certain she and Brawley would always be together.Then everything had changed.Iced tea or water for dinner, Maggie?Ill have iced tea, please, if you have it made.I do.She heard ice rattling in a glass as she looked at the last photo.Julia had taken it.Maggie stood between Cash and Brawley at their favorite swimming hole.The guys, bare chested, had seemed so sexy, so hot.But since then?Theyd both filled out nicely.Theyd matured.Morphed from boys to men.She wore the two piece suit shed pleaded for on a shopping trip to Austin.The mint green showed off both her hair and her figure.Good choice, Maggie.Karolyn came up behind her.The three of you were so close.She sighed and wrapped an arm around Maggies waist.We never could figure out what happened between you and Brawley.He wouldnt talk about it.Not then and not now.And Im not going to pry.Its your business.But weve missed you.Ive missed you, too.Maggie laid her head on Karolyns shoulder.The screen door opened, and the women drew apart.Brawleys mom moved to the oven and took out a pan of green chili enchiladas, the cheese bubbling on top.Maggies taste buds did their own little happy dance.Nobody made enchiladas like Karolyn Odell.Maggie, do you want to get the salad out of the fridge?Its already dressed.Sure.Oh, and theres a bowl of sour cream in there, too.She set the bowls on the table as the men came in through the mudroom.Traces suntanned, leathered face lost its smile when he spotted her.Maggie.He nodded her way.Good to see you.Been a while.Brawleys mom said, I told you if we gave things enough time Now, Karo, dont start that.The kids are here for the sander and dinner.They didnt come so youd start poking your nose in their business.Im not pokingexcept at you.She pointed a long wooden spoon at her husband and son.You two wash up.Youve been out in that barn digging around, and heaven only knows what kind of dirt youve picked up.When Trace opened his mouth, she said, Uh uh uh.No sass from either of you.Get in the washroom and clean up.Maggies hungry.She loved it.Loved this family and their dynamics.They were so easy with each other.And shed told Karolyn the truth.She had missed them terriblywell, all of them except Brawley.Okay, so maybe shed missed him a bit.But only becausebecause shed loved him.A long time ago.They ate in the kitchen, the conversation light and relaxed.Everythings ready for the wedding?Karolyn asked.I think soor almost.Hows your grandpa holding up?Amazingly well, Maggie answered.Hes happy again.The years melted away, back to when shed eaten nearly every Sunday dinner right here at this table.The best time, though, had been when she and Brawley had been able to sneak away alone.Shed lived for that.How many nights had they parked in the dark on one of the back roads?Remembering those nights, she squirmed in her chair.Brawley slid a hand on her leg, under the cover of the tablecloth.He squeezed lightly.You okay?he mouthed.She nodded, not trusting her voice, as his warm hand trailed up and down her leg, setting off sparks when he flirted with the hem of her sundress, traced a pattern on her bare skin.She wanted to pull away.Needed to pull away.Couldnt.Could you pass the salad, son?Trace asked.And with that, their contact ended.
