 Charley.Pay attention.I flinched as two hands smacked together in front of my face, a puff of air ruffling my hair.What?I snapped before realizing the hands belonged to my boss, Eva Porter.I softened my tone.What do you need, Eva?Im trying to get this press release out the door.Someone is snippy today, she said, shaking her head in disapproval.It seems to me like you could use some fun in your life.I groaned under my breath.Eva was always forcing me to participate in socially awkward events.What now?She nodded as if I had proved her point.Yep, this is exactly what you need.She held out an ivory colored enveloped which I took reluctantly.Fundraiser.Tonight.Be there.I glared at Eva and slipped the invitation from the envelope.As I read over the details, I tried to think of a good reason why I couldnt attend the event.Id love to go, Eva.Honestly.But  Stop.Eva dismissed my argument with a wave of her hand.I dont want to hear whatever pathetic excuse you were about to give.I have a date.I have a dentist appointment.I have to have my spleen removed.We both know you were about to make up an excuse because we both know you lead a pathetically dull and uneventful life.She had me.It was no secret that I spent most of my life at work and when I wasnt working, I spent my time alone in my small, one bedroom apartment eating takeout and watching bad television.It might be a dull and uneventful life, but I liked it that way.Eva, this invitation is addressed to you.I tried to hand it back to her.Im not going to an event where my name isnt even on the guest list.Evas grin was downright scary.I guess its good that I called and had you added in my place.Now you have no reason not to go.I had played right into her hands.Fine.I sighed loudly.Who do you need me to schmooze?Eva was the Founder and CEO of Children First, a Washington D. C.  non profit that focused on everything from literacy to gun violence.I had been working there almost a year as the event coordinator/marketing specialist/legislative advocate/whatever Eva decided I should be doing on a given day.One of my primary responsibilities at Children First was to attend any event where politicians might be and shove our cause down their throats.Senator Cooper is supposed to make an appearance.Eva actually winked at me.If you can get past whatever escort hell be wearing, I need you to push him on Bill 132.Bill 132 was Evas baby.It was a gun control bill that would ban assault weapons and right now it was at least five votes shy of passing in the Senate.Senator Nicholas Cooper was an independent and by all accounts undecided on the bill.Are you sure you dont want to do this instead?I was still perfecting my lobbying skills but Eva was a veteran when it came to cornering and convincing politicians.No doubt she would have Senator Cooper voting Yay in a matter of minutes.Youve got this, Eva said with a stiff nod.Just remember the advice Ive been giving you, and dont take no for an answer.I started to turn back to my neglected press release when Eva added, Oh and if Cooper makes a pass at you, your answer should be yes.Washington social events were not my thing.I didnt like making small talk, hated mingling with strangers and barely tolerated mediocre appetizers and supersized egos.But my job required me to play nice for the night, so thats exactly what I did.I discussed the weather with a Washington reporter, exchanged brownie recipes with a Senators wife and debated the merits of affirmative action with a legislative aide.After two hours of feigning interest in the people around me, I was exhausted.I was also relatively certain that Senator Cooper wasnt going to make an appearance.After slamming one more glass of champagne, my fifth of the night, I teetered as confidently as possible from the ballroom.My heels were high and I was drunk  the combination was guaranteed to lead to disaster.I made it down the long hall to the front entrance of The Capital Hotel, but a group of men blocked my exit.I tried to step around them, but the group was too large.My one recourse was to push through the middle.Excuse me, I growled, annoyed that leaving had turned into such a challenge.None of the men moved.I cleared my throat and tried again, louder.I said, excuse me.The man standing directly in front of me finally stepped to the side and glanced over his shoulder.Im sorry, Miss.Gentlemen, lets make some room.The face, the voice  I had found Senator Cooper.I now had a clear path to the door, but I was no longer anxious to leave.After standing there staring at the senator blankly for several seconds, he asked, Did you need something?I shook away my hesitation.My mission had been to corner Senator Cooper, but now that I was standing less than two feet away I couldnt think of a single thing to say to him.So instead I stuck with my original plan.No.Sorry.The path that had been cleared was narrow, and I had to step carefully between the men.I felt the warmth of Senator Coopers hand on the small of my back as he helped guide me through and I tensed.I didnt have time to figure out why his touch made me anxious because at that moment someone yelled, Gun!Men began to yell and the crowd around me pushed me backward.I stumbled and someone caught me by the arm and crushed me to their body, bringing us both to the ground.Stay down, Senator Cooper said, his voice steady and certain.My heart was pounding in my chest and it took me several attempts to find my voice.What happened?He was huddled around me and my head was tucked close to his chest.This meant I was shielded from potential danger, but I also couldnt see anything but the pinstripes on Senator Coopers shirt.Someone pulled out a gun.The guards are handling the situation.Gun?Why?It was taking me some time to catch up; it was like my brain had shut down.That isnt something I can answer presently.At last my brain clicked back into the right gear.Did they catch him?If not, we need to get out of here.I jerked away so that I could get a better look at what was happening around me.To our left, dozens of well dressed people were huddled around the room, many of them hiding behind furniture and columns.I fought back a wave of dj vu and turned to the right.Three men in suits were pinning another man to the ground.The man wasnt fighting them, but his head was turned toward us and his burning eyes were focused in our direction.Senator, I need you to come with me.Another man towered over us, a covert earpiece tucked into one ear and a gun bulging conspicuously beneath his suit jacket.He reached down to help me to my feet.Where?Senator Cooper asked as he stood, smoothing wrinkles from his dress pants.Weve secured a room.A room?Whos we?The well dressed, armed man didnt seem like a normal security guard and his grip on my arm was nearly painful.Secret Service, Maam.His grip loosened just a bit.Im Agent Flynn and I need you to come with me.Why?Agent Flynn was already walking away, his hand still firmly gripping my arm.They are securing the area, Senator Cooper explained.Theyll need to take our statements about what we saw.But I didnt see anything, I protested in futility.We were ushered down a long hallway with a group of men all dressed similarly to Agent Flynn.It didnt take a genius to realize we were in the middle of a secret service bubble.They all wore the same grim expressions.Agent Flynn finally released my arm and moved to the head of the pack.Friends of yours?I asked the senator.He seemed perfectly comfortable surrounded by a half dozen armed men.Theyre good friends to have, he quipped.Were alive, arent we?I couldnt argue with that as we followed the agents onto an elevator.It only had one button, and we sailed up to the top floor without stopping.Agent Flynn turned to the other agents.The penthouse is unoccupied and this elevator is one of the two entrances onto the floor.I want two men guarding it at all times and two men at the stairwell.No one enters this floor without clearance from me, got it?The elevator doors opened and everyone moved into action.
