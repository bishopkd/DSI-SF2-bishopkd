Why would you ask me that?Who told you that?She looked down at her stomach.Do I look fat or something?No, you dont look fat.I just heard Is it true?She turned to walk off.Dont worry, Bryan.Your perfect little world will not be disturbed.The baby isnt yours.Its my husbands.11  Ahhhhh, Ashlee tried to stifle a yawn.Dang, girl.What kept you up all night?Or should I say who kept you up all night?Monica asked after Ashlee yawned loudly for the third time.It wasnt that, trust me, she said.If theres ever a who that keeps me up at night, it would be one of my babies, Jordan or Jade Richards, and thankfully theyre sleep trained.But, someone had kept her awake all night and that someone was Bryan Hunter.Her jaws hurt from smiling so much.She stayed up all night thinking about their conversation.She couldnt believe she had told him her entire life story in a few hours.She hoped she didnt turn him off by talking too much, though he seemed interested enough.Bryan told her how proud he was of her and how much he admired a hard working woman.He was nothing like Jamal.The only thing Jamal cared about was how good shed looked.Bryan was completely different.He liked her because of her love for God, the way she took care of her children, and how she was able to make a life for herself without the help of her parents.She hated to admit it, but she was in love already.Hello, Monica sang while snapping her fingers to get Ashlees attention.Ashlee blinked.What?Ooooooh, somebodys in love.I am not in love.She tried as hard as she could to pull back her smile, but she couldnt.Okay, maybe Im a little bit in love.Oh my goodness, Mon.Hes perfect.We spent the entire afternoon together at his moms house.Monica turned her nose up.His moms house?Is that how church folks do it?Yall gotta have a chaperone?Chaperones will keep you out of a lot of trouble.Besides, I love his mom.Shes like a second mother to me.Wait, I thought Ms.Esther was like a second mom.Ashlee shook her head.No, Ms.Esther is the first mom, because the one that birthed me doesnt exist as far as Im concerned.Well, Im glad you had fun.I want all the details at lunch, not that its going to be anything juicy since you were with his mom and all.12  Bryan and Ashlee talked on the phone every night and every morning for the past six months.Most nights after shed fed Jordan and Jade and put them to bed, she stayed up and talked with Bryan for hours.She didnt even need to set an alarm anymore because he gave her a wake up call every morning at 4:45 since she had to be at work by 6:00.They usually spent their Sundays at his moms for dinner.And, on her off days, they often had lunch together.There was no doubt in his mind he wanted Ashlee to be his wife.The only problem was trying to figure out a romantic way to propose, which required them to go out at night.He didnt think Ashlee would have a problem with it, but since Mother Johnson was the only person she really trusted to keep her children, he knew it wasnt going to happen because she was adamant about the daytime hours rule.He thought if he gave Mother Johnson a call and explained what he was trying to do shed be quicker to participate, and he was right.When hed called and asked if she would babysit and explained it was because he wanted to ask Ashlee to marry him, shed said in a monotone voice, Well, its about time.I wondered how long it would take for you to know you wanted to marry somebody.Mother Johnson did not hold back her thoughts at all.Make sure you dont forget Jades blankie.The last time she didnt have it, it took forever to get her asleep.Mother Johnson said as she helped Ashlee pack the kids overnight bag.Are you sure you dont mind keeping them tonight?You have them all day every day.I dont have to go.We can do it another time.Mama Esther gave Ashlee a warm smile and embraced her.Its fine.You go on and have fun.Remember what I said about lingering around in the car or on the porch.When the date is over, go in the house.Ashlee smiled.Mama Esther had a strong opinion on dating and she wanted to make sure Ashlee didnt have any more children until she was married and able to handle it.Ashlee appreciated having someone in her corner that cared enough to be in her business.Her parents gave orders, but never spent time explaining anything.She certainly never got any affection from them.Mother Johnson moved the curtain back.Theres your friend coming up.Go on and get dressed.Make sure you stop by before you go so I can get a picture.Dang, Mon.Ashlee said as she watched Monica pull out an arm full of clothes still on hangers from her trunk.Did you bring your entire closet?Nah, only the good stuff.Monica was only a year older than Ashlee but she lived at home with her dad, so she didnt have to pay any bills.She was allowed to spend all of her money on whatever she wanted.An aspiring nursing student, she was working on her Bachelors of Science in Nursing at Hampton University.She dumped everything on Ashlees bed.Okay, do you have an idea about what you want to wear?Ashlee looked around.She really didnt have much fashion sense.She knew what she liked once she saw it on and her favorite color was purple.I know I want to wear a dress and some heels.Just find something cute and Ill try it.Monica did a quick scan of the clothes strewn across the couch.She picked up a dress.What about this one?Ashlee held it up and frowned.Wheres the rest of it?It was a strapless black bodycon dress that only came down far enough to cover her cheeks.Theres nothing there.Have you actually worn that?Girl, yeah.Its my favorite dress to go clubbing in.Monica did a Beyonc move.Like how?It doesnt hide anything.With all that donk youre carrying around, I know youve got to be flashing everyone in the room without even bending over.Oh yeah, I forgot youre into the whole I need to look modest style.Yeah, I want to look modest, Ashlee turned towards the mirror, but still sexy.Like, I want him to take notice.But I want all of my good parts covered, you know.And, I dont want to be uncomfortable, trying to pull stuff down all night.Im already nervous.Weve been dating for months, but it feels like its our first date.Well, it kind of is.I mean you usually either have the kids with you or an old lady.I guess youre right.Ashlee browsed through the clothes.Do you have anything purple?Monica started moving clothes around.A few garments fell on the floor.What about this one?Wait.Dont look at it, just try it on.But first, lets get your jewelry and makeup on so you can get the full Monica Jacobs fashion experience.Ashlee walked out of the bathroom and faced the full length mirror Monica had set up.She couldnt stop staring.She was amazed at how beautiful she looked.She wore a simple, dark purple spaghetti strapped dress that had a sweetheart neckline.It was fitted down to the waist, then loosened up and flowed past her hips ending about three inches above her knee.She wore silver studs, four inch silver stiletto sandals, and a silver tennis bracelet Bryan had delivered to her house.She ditched her normal ponytail and allowed her natural curls to flow slightly past her shoulders.Wow.I look amazing.She turned her five foot four, size two frame to get a side view.Ooooh.Look, Mon.I got a booty.Monica frowned, Barely.Whatever.She replied, still staring at herself.Monica went into her bag.Here.I got something for you.Whats this?Ashlee pulled a bottle of Juicy Couture perfume out of the gift bag and sprayed it on herself.Mmmmmm, this smells wonderful.She gave her friend a hug.I love you so much.Thank you for this.For all of it.Ashlee sniffed her wrist.Shed never had any perfume that expensive.Dont mention it, chica.Look, he should be here soon so Im gonna go.Call me when you get back.Ill grab some ice cream and come over so we can dish.13  Oh, Bryan.Ashlee took a deep breath and did a double take of her surroundings.Hed gone all out for the evening.Shed never seen anything so beautiful.Who rents a private yacht?I cant believe you did all of this for me.And, here I am crying like a baby.Im so embarrassed.Im glad youre pleased.Bryan gently wiped her tears with his hand.I realize youre a private person and dont like a lot of people making a fuss over you.So, tonight is all about us.Just the two of us.There is no one else onboard this ship except the chefs, our waiters, our musical entertainment and you and me.The jazz band played soft romantic music.The lights inside the ships cabin were dim.White candles, strategically placed around the interior, created intimate ambiance.An elegant fleur de lis pattern adorned the gold rimmed chinaware that sat atop a white tablecloth at a table for two set up on the outside deck.Crystal goblets and gold plated stemware completed the table setting.A night sky filled with stars provided the evenings light.Everything was perfect.The waiters approached their table as soon as they were seated.One held a tray with a variety of fruit.The other, two wine bottles.She looked at Bryan and whispered, Im not twenty one yet.He smiled.I know, sweetheart.Its non alcoholic.Would you like to dance?Bryan took her hand and led her to the dance floor.He placed her hands on his shoulders and gently grabbed her on each side of her waist.She wondered if he could tell she felt awkward.This was her first time slow dancing with a man.Shed missed all of the high school dances because she was pregnant and her boyfriend was out of school.Just relax, Bryan said softly.Darn it.He can tell.He pulled her closer and whispered in her ear.I love you, Ashlee.She inhaled the night air and held it.Exhale, sweetheart.She let out the breath she was holding.This was his first time telling her he loved her.I love you too, Bryan.Ashlee closed her eyes and reveled in the moment.
