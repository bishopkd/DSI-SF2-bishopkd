We didnt make a baby tonight.He jerked up and snapped on the bedside lamp.She blinked and brought up a hand to shield her eyes.Her face had gone ghostly white.What are you saying, Maggie?She pulled the sheet around herself, but he saw the rise and fall of her breasts as she breathed deeply.Focusing on a spot on the ceiling rather than look at him, she said, When you came home at the end of your fall term She stopped.Spit it out, Maggie.We took your dads truck out for a moonlight ride.I remember.Do you remember the blanket you spread in the back?What we did on it?He pulled her hand away from her face.Look at me, Maggie.She cut her eyes to his, then averted them again.You only had one condom with you.We made love twice.His stomach dropped.What are you saying?She laughed, but there was no humor in it.Come on, Brawley.Youre a big boy.You know what Im saying.You got pregnant?She nodded.You carried my baby and didnt tell me?I lost your baby.Hot tears burned in the eyes she turned to him.Anger or grief, he wondered.You lost it?She nodded.At the end of my first trimester.And you didnt tell me.Why should I?It wouldnt have changed anything.Youd already decided I had no place in your life.His head spun, trying to make sense out of what she said.Furious, he reached out to take her hand, but she jerked it away.When you say you lost the baby, do you mean miscarried or aborted?You can ask me that?She sat up and slid across the bed, as far away as she could get.Im sorry, Brawley.I think its time for you to leave.No.No?No.The questions justified, Maggie.Youre pregnant with my baby and dont think to tell me till now?Jesus.How did you think Id react?Exactly like you are.I could have been a daddy.A single tear rolled down her cheek.Ah, damn, Red.Dont cry.He leaned across, wiped the tear away with his thumb.Cursed when she flinched.I need to know the answer to my question, though.I think I deserve that much.She sniffled.Yes, I guess you do.Her eyes met his.Do you really believe I could have aborted your baby?I loved you.Maggie I miscarried.When he reached for her, she drew farther away.Dont touch me, Brawley.Not now.Okay.A muscle worked in his jaw.He supposed he should take the high road here, tell her it didnt matter.But it did.Why didnt you tell me?he whispered.What?She turned hurt eyes on him.I should have called you after you dumped me?And say what?Hey, Brawley, I know you dont want anything to do with me, and thats okay, but I thought you should know Im pregnant.If youd told me, I wouldnt have.Wouldnt have what?Dumped me?Too late.You already did.Id have done the right thing, Mags.God, you should have known that.I didnt want you under those circumstances.Ouch.Her words hurt.Hurt more because he understood.Hed picked a hell of a time to cut the strings.It didnt much matter that hed done it as much to make sure he didnt hold her back as for himself.Still, you should have told me.You shouldnt have had to go through that alone.I didnt.Mom was there for me.He grimaced.Im surprised your dad didnt drive to Dallas and take me out.Maggie smiled lopsidedly.He probably would haveif Id told him.I didnt.He still doesnt know.When things fell apart, I went to my mom.She drove me to a clinic in Austin.At Popss wedding, Rita, big hearted Rita, had asked if he still loved her daughter.He was surprised she hadnt hired a hit man instead.I owe her.Big time, he said.Yes, you do.So do I.  She was my rock.What can I do?Nothing.Wrapping a sheet around herself, Maggie stood.Its probably best if you leave now.His chest ached.I dont want to.We need to talk.She shook her head.We really dont have anything to talk about.Its all in the past, Brawley, and as nice as today was, as this was She gestured toward the bed, toward him, We both know it wont work long term.Plucking at the sheet, she said, For what its worth, I didnt intend to tell you.Tonight or ever.I figured why dump a load of guilt on you for something you cant change.She hesitated.Im going to take a shower.When I come out, Ill expect you to be gone.So Im dismissed.His jaw set in a hard line.Thats a little dramatic, but, yeah.Just like that.Just like that, she said.Youre not the Maggie I used to know.She tipped her head and regarded him.Im not so sure you ever did really know me, Brawley.Dont be stupid.We grew up together.Yes, we did.And then we grew apart.As regal as any queen who ever lived, she turned her back and walked away from him.The moonlight highlighted her back and turned it into shimmery alabaster, her red tangle of curls into every mans dreams.Finally he understood his sin.What hed done that could not be forgiven.Hed left hereighteen, pregnant, and alone.God, no wonder shed kept him at a distance all these years.Hed screwed up, and it was so much worse than hed ever imagined.Hed watched Jarvis touch her, kiss her yesterday, and it had been enough to drive him crazy.How had Maggie felt about all the women hed dated over the years?Did she still harbor any of the feelings shed once had for him?Or had he ruined that, killed those feelings forever when hed walked away all those years ago?When he hadnt been there for herand their baby.After tonight, hed have thought he could answer that question.He couldnt.He was more confused now than ever.Together, he and Maggie had created a baby.An innocent little life.A lost life.He mourned for the child hed never known about, would never know.When the shower turned on, he reached for his clothes, dressed slowly, then stole out of the apartment like a thief.Only it was Maggie who was the thief.Shed stolen his heartand refused to return it, teasing and tantalizing him with a glimpse of what could be before snatching it away again.Twenty Five  Overhead, seagulls circled, cawed, then swooped down to scavenge their breakfast.A breeze off the ocean tossed Maggies hair, and she brushed it back.Her coffee had cooled.She broke what was left of her bagel into small pieces, throwing them into the air and watching as each was snapped up by a dive bombing seabird.The sun warmed her skin but nothing could warm her inside.It had been a week since shed sent Brawley away.She hadnt handled that well.All this time shed held her silence.Then, at the worst possible moment, her secret had spilled, catching him totally off guard.She hadnt heard a word from him since shed left him there in her bed.He must hate her.Laying a hand on her flat stomach, she mourned again the loss of his child.A child hed known nothing about until seven days ago.Plucking her phone from her purse, she dialed her grandfather.She missed him, his wisdom.When he answered, his voice gruff sounding, she missed him even more.Hey, Pops, how are the newlyweds?Cant speak for the other half, but this halfs doing well.Have fun at Disney World?He laughed.We had a great time.Dottie could wallpaper a room with all the pictures she took.How about you?Hows the city treating you today?Im at South Street Seaport drinking my morning coffee.Listen.She held up her phone, sharing the sounds of the birds and a boats whistle.Hear that?she asked.Sure do.Quite a difference from Lone Tree, Texas, huh?And some.You and Dottie are at your place now?He hesitated.Yeah.Were, ah, going through some things.Youre moving.Her voice sounded flat.We are, darlin.Even if we could keep them up, we dont need two houses.Dotties offered to sell her place and move in here, but I can tell her hearts not in it.I cant say I blame her.Her gardensshes spent a lot of hours creating that oasis.Its a pretty little place.It is, and youll be happy there, Pops.Im glad you called, honey.Ive held off talking to a Realtor.Wanted to ask you first.Me?Its your house.I know that.His old voice took on a deeper timbre.But your grandma and I always figured wed leave the old homestead to you.To do whatever you wanted with it.Now, well, I kind of feel like Im selling your birthright.Nonsense.Its yours.Im in New York.If you and Dottie want to sell the house, then thats what you should do.Youre staying there then?I am.If she suffered a little melancholy at the words, she tamped it down.Hows everyone doing?Your mom and dad both miss you, but otherwise theyre fine.Your moms actually bullied Sean into taking a country line dancing class.I know.Can you believe it?I talked to them on the way here this morning.He harrumphed.Saw Ty and Sophie and the boys last night.They sure do make a nice family.They do.The boys Skyped me yesterday to show me Troubles new trick.Theyre growing like weeds.Sos Annie with that new little one shes carrying.Really?I talked with her last night, and she didnt say anything about it.A pang of regret stabbed her.She wanted to watch Annie grow big with her friends baby.Shed never had the chance to do that with Brawleys, never felt their baby quicken.So let me make sure Ive got this right, Pops said.In the last twenty four hours, youve talked to Sophie and the boys, to Annie, and to your mom and dad.That means your earlier question about everyone was either rhetorical or youre taking an around the barn route to asking about Brawley.She closed her eyes and said nothing.The old man was too perceptive by far.Hes good, her grandfather said.That what you wanted to know?She expelled the breath shed been holding.We had a fight before he left.Nothing new about that.The two of you have been bickering for over a decade now.We have not.His chuckle drifted over the line.Girl, this is me youre talking to.You and Brawley rile each other without even trying.I know he hurt you.Hurt you bad.And Id like to take him over my knee for that.But dont you think its time you pulled out that thorn and let the wound heal?Im not sure I can, Pops.Its a pretty big thorn and buried deep.Then go in for surgery.But get it done and put it away.In the background, she heard Dottie.Listen, Pops, youre busy, and I have to get to work.Okay, but you think about what I said.Will do.Love you.Love you, too.Dottie sends her love.Tell her its more than reciprocated.Thats a mighty big word.She laughed and hung up.Tossing her now very cold coffee into a nearby trash bin, she stood and brushed a couple stray crumbs from her dress.Facing the river, she let the breeze flow over her, wishing it could blow away the hurt.Shed put it awayor nearly hadfor all these years.Brawleys move back to town had irritated old wounds.Sleeping with him had been a huge mistake.Rather than healing, it had ripped those wounds wide open.Her phone rang.Brawley?Dont be an idiot.Pops?Maybe hed remembered something hed wanted to tell her.She glanced at the caller ID and frowned.She didnt recognize it.Hello?Maggie?Its Jarvis.Disappointment raced through her, but she tamped it down.Hi.The photos you took are beyond amazing.I cant thank you enough.Sure you can.Have dinner with me tonight.Tonight?Do you have other plans?No, I dont.She chewed her lip.She liked Jarvis, found him sophisticated, different from anyone shed ever dated.But she couldnt see any future for them.Whoa.Dinner, Maggie.Thats all he was proposing.A meal together.Shed had a good time with him before.If she intended to live here, wasnt it time to start that life?How better than dinner with Jarvis?Id love to.Jarvis took her to a small outside caf.They ate pasta, drank wine, and talked.The food was some of the best shed ever eaten, the evening warm, the stars brilliant.One hour turned to two, edged toward three.Over coffee and a shared piece of cheesecake, he mentioned a friend was playing sax at a club across town.Do you want to stop by?Listen to a set?Sure, why not?The club, in the basement of an old bank, turned out to be quintessential New York.Posters and graffiti covered the walls, and smoke hung in the air.The quartet had a sound that wrapped itself around you and held on.At the break, Jarvis wandered to the front to speak to his friend.He waved her over and introduced her.I could listen to you all night long, Maggie said.The saxophone is one of the most romantic instruments ever madeand you really make it sing.They talked for a few more minutes.You ready to go?Jarvis asked.Maggie nodded.The evening air felt fresh and cool after being inside.He insisted on seeing her home.When the taxi pulled up in front of her house, he asked the driver to wait.At the base of her stairs, he said, I had a wonderful time tonight.She smiled at him.I did, too.Thank you.I was feeling a little homesick, and this evening was exactly what the doctor ordered.He looked at her, his dark eyes hooded.You could ask me in.I can pay the cab and get another later.Or in the morning.Maggies heart raced.Before she could tell him no, his arm circled her waist and he pulled her to him, his lips covering hers.This second time was no different from the first.She still felt nothing.This gorgeous man wanted her.That was more than evident as he held her close, but she couldnt respond.He drew away.No?She shook her head.Is it the cowboy?No.He laid a hand on the side of her face.You sure?Hes definitely got a thing for you.She almost snorted, caught herself in time.You are so wrong.Now, his lips tilted in the faintest smile.Youre kidding me, right?I honestly thought he might tear my head off at your runway show when he caught me kissing you.If looks could kill, Id be six feet under now.We had a thing.In high school.Its long over.Then maybe we should give this another shot.He bent his head, but she reached out, rested a hand on his chest.Its been a long day, Jarvis.He nodded.Good enough.After a quick kiss on the cheek, he said, Go on.Scoot inside then.Like before, Ill wait till I hear you lock up.She felt like a heel.He was a good man.Thank you, both for the wonderful evening and for understanding.She hurried up the stairs and inserted her key in the lock.I think I understand far more than you do, he said.Maggie stepped inside, and Jarvis walked to the taxi.She watched the taillights as they disappeared into the traffic, then laid her head on the door frame.She needed a hobby.Something that required a great deal of concentration.For tonight, shed try a bath and a good book.Maybe a complicated whodunit.Problem was she already knew whodunit.The long, tall Texas cowboy.Twenty Six  The warm weather invigorated Maggie.The tree in front of her brownstone sported leaves, and flowers bloomed in a window box next door.Energy flowed, and people walked faster, smiled more.She missed the big sky in Texas, though.The stars at night, competing with the citys lights, didnt shine quite as brightly.The moon didnt seem as large hanging over a skyscraper as when it hung over the Texas prairie.There were moments when she found herself at a loss.So at home as Maggie Sullivan in Maverick Junction, she wondered about the New York Maggie Sullivan.Who was she?She checked her watch.Since she didnt need to be at the studio for another hour, she had plenty of time to stop at the neighborhood Starbucks.She could use a good cup of coffee.The line was short this morning.Coffee in hand, she actually found a table and sat down.From her vantage point, she people watched.A mother came in with her two daughters.The girls perched on stools at the counter and devoured sweet rolls.Mom, standing behind them in six inch heels, looked as though no carb would ever dare venture near her Marilyn Monroered lips.She wore a size two black pencil skirt and a phenomenal white silk blouse.Her Gucci purse made Maggies mouth water.At a corner table, another woman took a mirror from one of her four bags and quickly applied her makeup.Thered been a time Maggie would have thought four bags overkill.Not anymore.Shed quickly learned that when she left the house, she had to carry with her everything shed need for the day and into the evening.No running back home to change or pick up something shed forgotten.Smartphones, tablets, iPods.Everybody in the coffee shop was plugged in.Shed heard horror stories about the city.How you had to keep everything close.Watch your purse with an eagle eye.Yet, even here, there were neighborhoods.People called each other by name.They left purses and laptops at their seats and stepped outside for a cigarette or to the counter for a refill.It was comfortable and accepting.And it made her homesick for Ollie and Sally and Bubba.For Rhonda at her beauty shop and Mel at the newspaper.Even though shed talked to Pops a couple days before, she needed to hear his voice again.Hed be up and around.A couple minutes with him would settle her restlessness.Taking a tentative sip of coffee, she found her phone in her massive purse.Maggie?Hey, Pops.You okay?Absolutely.Im on my way to work and decided to give you a quick call.You in a taxi?No, actually Im sitting in Starbucks.Are you in Lone Tree or Maverick Junction?Were at Dotties.You know, sooner or later, youre going to have to quit thinking of the house as hers.Youre a couple now.They talked about everything and nothing.Maggie heard about Dotties newest cookie recipe, last nights T ball game where theyd rooted on Tys boys, and Jessies double.Ollie told me his business has dropped off since you left.Hes not getting as many out of towners.Im sorry about that.Not a thing you can do about it.I miss you, girl.Id be a third thumb, Pops.Youve got a new bride.The boys keeping busy at the clinic.Maggie didnt need to ask who the boy was.Im sure he is.Hes taking most of his meals out.Dotties had him to dinner a couple nights, but he usually doesnt leave once hes home.Dont think hes sleeping well.How would you know that?I hear him wandering around at night.Hes got a chair on the upstairs landing and sits out there sometimes.My guess is he misses you as much as you miss him.I dont miss him.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Dont try to bluff your grandpa.Ive been playing poker a heck of a lot longer than youve been drawing breath.She sighed.I have to go, Pops.I dont want to be late.Okay, sweetheart.Love you.Love you, too.The man read her like a book.She decided to take her coffee with her.Swinging out the door, she walked down the street.As she passed one building, the fire escape caught her attention, and she smiled.If shed had an umbrella, shed have been tempted to hook the handle over the bottom rung and pull it down like Edward in Pretty Woman.She loved that movie, loved that hed come to his senses and gone after the woman he wanted.She imagined Brawley in that limo, flowers in hand, music playing.A horn honked, startling her out of her reverie.Flagging down a taxi, she gave him her work address.The light turned green, and the cabbie took off so fast her head snapped back.She missed her car, missed driving off to wherever, whenever.But the clothes, the fashion, the endless choices of shops and restaurants?She loved it.Loved the freedom she had here.Everything had a trade off, though.Everything came with a price.Shed heard Owen on the phone the other day talking about his new designer, the fiery redhead with the Texas twang.She smiled.She was that.Brawley checked his watch again.Five minutes later than the last time and still no Doc Gibson.It wasnt like him to be late.He took out his phone and hit redial.It rang six times and went to voicemail.Hey, Doc.Me again wondering where you got off to.Im at the caf.Did you forget our lunch date?He hung up and slipped the phone back into his shirt pocket.Want another refill on your tea, Brawley?No, thanks, Sally.My teeth are practically floating now.You gonna order some lunch or wait a little longer?What have you got that you can fix me up with fast?Something to go.Chicken salad or egg salad sandwiches are quick.Egg salad.Anything with it?Why dont you toss in a bag of chips?And bring me a Styrofoam cup for this, please.He held up his tea.Gotcha.Brawley toyed with his key ring while he waited.Worry niggled at him.Doc Gibson had called last evening and asked if he wanted to meet for lunch today.Brawley had jiggled a few appointments around to make it work.Retirement was still new to Doc, and Brawley figured it would take a bit for him to settle into it.Hed stopped by the clinic every day this week, visiting with the staff, talking to the patients, even handling an appointment here and there.Todays lunch had been his suggestion, and it wasnt like him not to keep an appointment.Here you go.Sally slid two containers on the table.Catch me for it next time youre in.I know youre impatient to get going.I added a second sandwich in case Docs involved in something out at his place and hasnt eaten yet.No charge on that one.Thanks, Sally, but Im gonna tell Doc he owes you for both.The man stood me up.Brawley picked up the food, gave her a quick peck on the cheek, and headed out the door.On the way to Docs small farm, Brawley gave Phyllis a quick call at the office and explained the situation.Ive got things here, she said.Go check on the old guy.Well all feel better if you do.I wont be any longer than I need to be.Brawley hit end and cranked up Mirandas new CD.The woman had attitude.She reminded him a whole lot of Maggie.Feisty as all get out.Starving and driving one handed, he ripped into his sandwich.Breakfast had been too little and too long ago.Swinging into the long, unpaved driveway, he braked when Docs bluetick hounds rushed to meet his SUV, tongues lolling.He turned off the engine and hopped out, rubbing both dogs ears at the same time when they greeted him, their feet braced on his legs.Docs old Chevy truck sat in front of the dilapidated garage.Brawleys uneasiness grew.Doc seldom left the dogs outside unattended for long.Too many times, theyd caught a scent and took off into the surrounding hills chasing their quarry.Hey, boys, what are you doing out here, huh?Wheres Doc?He patted their backs and started up the walk.Raising his voice, he called, Doc?You outside?When he got no answer, he walked around back, the dogs at his heels.Doc?He stepped onto the porch and knocked.When there was no answer, he turned the knob and the door swung open.The dogs tried to rush past him, but he held them back by placing his booted foot in front of them.Stay outside for another minute, boys.Ill come back out for you.The house was quiet.Still.As he started down the hall, he saw one bare foot.Oh, shit!He ran the rest of the way to the kitchen, then stopped in the doorway.Doc lay on the floor, his arms outstretched, one leg bent beneath him.A mug had shattered and pieces scattered across the old linoleum.Coffee pooled on the floor and soaked into his shirt.Doc.Brawley knelt on the floor, felt for a pulse even knowing thered be none.Oh, God, Doc.Brawleys breath caught in his throat.Still on his knees, Brawley looked around the room, then back at his friend.From the amount of rigor, Brawley guesstimated hed been dead about six hours.Doc must have let Holmes and Watson out for their early morning potty break, then come inside for his first cup of coffee.Brawley hoped hed at least gotten that first taste.Doc loved his caffeine.He brushed away a tear he hadnt realized hed shed.Please, God, let him have gone quickly.Painlessly, Brawley prayed.Hot tears filled his eyes.He was too late.Not a thing he could do.The egg sandwich hed eaten roiled in his stomach, and Brawley thought he might be sick.Fighting nausea, he sat on the floor beside his good friend.Outside the front door, the dogs whined, and Brawley thanked God he hadnt let them inside.How many times had Doc come into town, the two blueticks riding in the cab of his truck, to buy them all an ice cream?Never again.Sorrow swamped him.Im gonna miss you, Doc.He swiped at his eyes, at his nose.There were things that needed done.He should probably call Howard, the county coroner.Instead, his finger hit the instant dial for Maggie.He had to talk to her.After that, hed be able to deal with the rest.Zandra, Maggies efficient, nerveless assistant answered.Im sorry, he said.I thought I was calling Maggies personal line.You did.Ms.Sullivan is busy right now and cant come to the phone.If I could take a message I dont friggin care if shes halfway up a pole flying the Lone Star flag, I The fight drained out of him.In a quiet voice, he said, I need to talk to her.I dont interrupt her unless its life and death.Not when shes designing.Brawley laid his warm hand on Docs cold one.He swallowed hard and let out a shaky breath.Then youre gonna want to interrupt her.Her heard Zandras sharp intake.Did someone Yeah.Im sorry.Ill put her right on.The room was so quiet, he heard her footsteps as she took the phone to wherever Maggie was hard at work.For one fleeting second, he wondered if he should hang up.Not drop this heartache on her.No.Shed find out anyway.Hed tell her and maybe find a little solace in the sound of her voice.Hunched over her sketch pad and lost in thought, Maggie was vaguely aware of her phone ringing.She ignored it, heard Zandra pick it up.The dress she worked on needed something more.Maybe different shoulders or a longer sleeve.Fiddling with it, she heard Zandras heels on the old oak floor.Maggie looked up when her assistant knocked on the doorjamb.I hate to bother you when youre working, but you have a call I think you need to take.The expression on Zandras face warned Maggie this wouldnt be good news.Who is it?Brawley.On rubbery legs, she stood and reached for the phone.The door closed behind Zandra.She took a deep breath.Brawley?Is Pops okay?The question gushed from her.Yeah.Something was wrong, though.She heard it in his voice, in the tone of that single word.Brawley?Im here.Where exactly is here?At Doc Gibsons.He Brawleys voice broke.He isnt okay, is he?It was more a statement than a question.No.Oh, Mags, hes dead.He was supposed to meet me at Sallys for lunch.He didnt come, and I couldnt get him on the phone.I drove out here Is anyone there with you?Just Doc.She could hear the tears in his voice, along with a touch of anger.Did you call an ambulance?No.He doesnt need an ambulance.Theres nothing anyone can do for him.Youre absolutely sure hesyou know.Yes.Im a doctor, Maggie.Okay.She hesitated.Do you want me to call the police for you?The coroner?No, Ill call Howard.I need a minute first.I needed to hear your voice.Her insides tumbled, and she hated every single mile between them.She needed to be there with him.You shouldnt be alone right now.Its the way it is.She could practically hear his shrug.Doc was alone when it happened.Brawley, that wasnt your fault.You had no way of knowing.Ill be there as soon as I can.No, Maggie.Thats not why I called.To be honest, Im not really sure why I did.Because you know I care.Time was it was a lot more than that.Yes, time was.They talked quietly for a few more minutes.I have to go now, Red.Its time to notify Howard.Time he gets out here.Are you going to be okay?Sure.And he disconnected.Maggie stared at the phone for all of two seconds before she punched in Cashs number.He answered on the second ring.Hey, sweetheart.Whats up in the city?Are you busy?No.His tone turned serious.You okay?Not really, but nothings wrong here.Doc died this morning.Son of a How do you know?Brawley called.He found him.He drove out to Docs when he didnt show up for a lunch theyd planned.Oh, damn!Cash, if theres any way you can swing it, he needs you.Right away.Hes at Docs alone with him.Why didnt he call me?Male pride?I dont know.I do know Brawley isnt in a good place right now.Hes calling the coroner, but he needs somebody there with him, Cash.Yeah, he does.Doc was like a second father to him.I dont know when the next flight leaves, but if I can get a seat on it, Im on my way home.Ill get out of here somehow or another today.Somebody should be there with Brawley now, though, not in five or six hours.Not tomorrow.Im hopping in my truck even as we speak.Thanks for calling me, hon.I appreciate it.I love you, Cash.Love you, too.She hung up.Throwing her door open, she called out, Zandra?Yes?I hate to ask you to do this, but could you make a flight reservation for me?The earliest one you can find.Already on it.She held up her laptop.Thanks!Are you okay?Zandra gave her a careful look.An old friend died.Doc Gibson.Ah, he called while we were at dinner celebrating your showing.Maggie nodded.He owned the animal clinic Brawley took over.They were close?Very.Brawleys the one who found him.Zandra grimaced.Thats a tough one.Yes.You never did tell me, even after repeated questions and nagging, whats between you and Brawley.Its impossible to miss the vibes.You love him, dont you?Maggies chin came up.Loved.Past tense.A long, long time ago.Hmmm.Not sure I believe that, but whatever you say.She bent over her keyboard.Ill let you know when I have something nailed down.Okay.In the meantime, Ill take care of what absolutely needs done here.Leave me a list.I can handle most of it, Zandra mumbled absently.Maggie zipped around making phone calls and putting the finishing touches on a couple projects.Much easier to keep busy than to dwell on what Brawley was going through right now.Doc had had a good life, but stillHe should have had more time to enjoy his retirement.She started when Zandra put an arm around her.There isnt anything here that I cant take care of or that cant wait.She handed Maggie a torn out notebook page.Your flight number and times.You have just enough time to run home and grab an overnighter.Im sure you have plenty of clothes in Maverick Junction or at your shop there.Maggie nodded, choked up again.Go.Brawleys a good man, Maggie, and despite what you claim, hes still in love with you.Right now your place is with him, not here.I called Owen and explained everything to him.And he told you to get out of here and get back to Maverick Junction, didnt he?Zandra asked.Maggie nodded and hugged her.Picking up her purse and briefcase, she started for the door.Youre sure?Im positive.From the taxi, she called her mom.Pops called me, her mom said.Im sorry, honey.He told me Brawley was the one who found Doc.Yes.My plane leaves in about two hours.Can you pick me up?In Austin?Yes.She gave her the flight number and arrival time.Daddy and I will be there.Do you need us to bring anything along?Nope.Just you.She started to cry.All afternoon, through the call with Brawley and afterward, shed held back her tears.Now, with her mom, she could let go.Have a safe flight, baby.Well see you in a few hours.Twenty Seven  The setting sun painted the sky in vibrant streaks of pink and orange as her plane touched down.Staring out the window, Maggie wondered where Doc was right now.She didnt believe life ended when the last breath left the body.Was he up there in those picture postcard clouds?If so, she wished hed help Brawley.It tore her up to think of his suffering, the sorrow that had seeped through the phone lines.Gathering up her purse and bag, she walked out into the concourse and made her way to the luggage area.And there stood her mom, arms outstretched to comfort her.Maggie almost fell into her embrace.Her dad came up behind her to take her bag.Im sorry, honey.Sorry as hell.Brawley and I havent seen eye to eye for some time now, but its a hard thing he did today.The evening sky had deepened by the time they reached her dads Buick.They stopped once for coffee and a bathroom break.After a short discussion about what had happened that day, her mom and dad kept the conversation light.Still, the drive seemed endless to Maggie.By the time they passed the Maverick Junction city limits sign, the night was pitch black.Her mom half turned in the seat.Will you stay with us tonight?Popss house is closed up right now.Theyre at Dotties.Maggie pushed her hair away from her face.I dont know.To be perfectly honest, I hadnt even thought about it.Her mind tussled with the question.Would you drive by Brawleys, Dad?I want to see if hes home.Sure.When they turned onto the street, they saw lights on in the downstairs, but all the upstairs windows were dark.Brawleys SUV was parked at a slant in the driveway, though.Pull in, Dad.He did, and she hopped out.Leaning in, she grabbed her purse and bag.What are you doing?her mom asked.She closed the back door and crouched so she could see into the car.I came home for Brawley.Because he called.Because he needs me.What makes you think hes up there?her dad asked.Doesnt look like theres a soul home.His SUVs here.He might be with Cash or Ty, honey.Or maybe hes at the clinic.Im sure with everything that happened today he missed a lot of appointments and has things to take care of.Youre right.About all of it.If he isnt here, Ill visit with Dottie and Pops for a while.One of them can drive me home, or Ill call you and you can come for me.Belatedly, she added, If thats okay.Of course it is, her dad answered.If hes not here, he might not return anytime soon, honey.Understood.I dont want you hurt again.I know.She blinked back her tears.Dottie came to the kitchen window and peeked out as her dad backed down the drive.Seeing Maggie, she waved.Maggie waved back, but walked past, slowly heading up the stairs.Fletch stepped out.Maggie!Hey, Pops.She stopped on the third step and waited till he came to her.He squeezed her so hard she could barely breathe.Geez, its good to see you, girl.Sorry it has to be under these circumstances, though.She nodded and hugged back.Is Brawley home?Yeah, the boys up there.Hes hurting.Fletch hugged her again.He could use a friend right about now.Barking sounded behind her, and Maggie turned.Whats that?Holmes and Watson.Docs hounds.Yeah.Pops scratched his head, the gray hair a little thinner than shed remembered.They, ah, needed somewhere to go.Doc was a good friend.Least Dottie and I can do is give his dogs a home.In the moonlight, she saw a sheen of tears in her grandfathers eyes.So many people loved him, Pops.Yep.He clapped her on the arm.Go on up.See if you can help the kid.She nodded and picked up her carry on.Want me to tote that up for you?No.Im good.Not a single light was on.Still she pounded on the door.Nothing.She pounded again.Go away.Her gut instinct had been right.Like a hurt animal, hed crawled away to hide.Not going to happen.She pounded hard enough that her hand would be bruised in the morning.Go away!You open this damn door, Brawley Odell, or I swear Ill go down and get Dotties key.You know her as well as I do.No way shell stay downstairs.Shell come up with me, and then instead of one, youll have two He jerked open the door.Maggie, leave.I dont want you here.His body swayed unsteadily.Her chin went up.If you didnt want me here, you shouldnt have called.Her nose wrinkled.Geez, youre a mess.This place smells worse than Bubbas on Sunday morning.She pushed past him, dropping her overnighter on the kitchen counter.He raked a hand through his hair and swore ripely when she turned on the overhead light.Covering his eyes with one hand, he said, Maggie, I swear if you dont Huh uh.You already swore.Quite nicely, too.She tapped a finger to his lips.You kiss your mama with the same mouth those words passed through?Huh?His eyes were bloodshot, his clothes rumpled, his beard heavy.She couldnt decide if the eyes were the result of tears or the empty beer bottles strew on the floor and coffee table.She almost hoped it was the beer.Her stomach twisted at the thought of him sitting up here all alone in the dark crying for a lost friend.A yapping machine started up in the bedroom, then shot across the floor at her.She knelt to scoop up the tiny fur ball.Well, hello.Arent you the cutest little thing?Brows quirked, she turned to Brawley.Marvin?Yeah, the worthless mutt.She covered the dogs ears.He doesnt mean it.He loves you.Brawley muttered what he thought about that while the dog slathered Maggies face with kisses.She chuckled.At least somebodys glad to see me.What the hell are you doing here, Maggie?Whyd you come?Youre a busy woman.A friend called.A friend whos had the worst kind of day.Im never too busy for a friend.She set the dog on the floor and moved to Brawley.He stood unmoving, watching her through slitted eyes.A friend?Yes.Ignoring the back off warnings, she simply stepped into him and wrapped her arms around his waist.Words are totally inadequate.Im so sorry, Brawley.I know how much you loved Doc.His chin trembled, but he said nothing.You cant hold it in.Itll eat you alive.When his eyes filled with tears, he dropped his head, buried his face in her hair.What happened?Howard said it was a massive coronary.Hard and fast.He doubts Doc had time to know what hit him.He was standing with his morning coffee one second and gone the next.So he didnt suffer.She felt his head shake.I fed Holmes and Watson, then sat on the floor with Doc until Howard came.I waited till they His breath caught.Till they took him away.Cash came.He waited with me.Thanks for calling him.She nodded.Your grandfather has a scanner and heard the call out.He came, too.Got there way faster than Howard.He waited with Cash and me, Maggie.Just waited with me.She knew he was fighting back tears.Knew how hard the telling was.How important it was.So she didnt interrupt.Fletch took the dogs with him.He said he and Dottie would be glad to take care of them for his old pal and fishing buddy.A low keening sound deep inside Brawley worked its way out.The floodgates opened, and his tears started.She said nothing, simply held him.Finally, embarrassed, he pulled away, rubbing his hands down his face.Sorry.Shit, Im so sorry.Im okay now.That was the beer talking, making me all sloppy.Bull.That was your heart breaking, Brawley, and its nothing to be ashamed of.It proves youre humanlike the rest of us.His brow jerked up.Have you eaten?He blinked at the smooth segue.Im not hungry.Ill assume that means no.Good.He frowned.Ive had a long day, and Im starving.Besides, itll give me a chance to cook for you.He snorted.Right.Our own Julia Child.Hey!I might not be Julia Child, but I can cook.In fact, Im a darn good cook.When I look at you, sugar, domestic goddess and chef are the very last two labels that come to mind.Really?Yeah, really.So what does come to mind?You fishing?Maybe.Heres the thing about that, darlin.You never can tell what you might snag on the end of that hook.She looked him straight in the eye.Ill risk it.Okay, dont say I didnt warn you.And, remember, you asked for it.Oh, geez.Maybe I dont want to know.Nope.Too late.He narrowed his eyes and studied her.Sensual.A little bit of a wild child.He held up a hand and ticked them off on his fingers.Creative.Sexy as hell.Bright.Fun.Tenacious as all get out.Those are a few that come to mind.But cook?Nope.She chuckled.What?No comment?None that I can think of right now.Go take a shower, Brawley.You need one.By the time youre done, dinner will be ready.Good luck with that.Have you taken a look in my fridge?Not yet.Should I be scared?Yes, be afraid.Be very afraid.With that, he headed off for the bathroom.By the way, he tossed over his shoulder, I dont have a shower.Just this great big old claw foot tub.That should do the trick.Dont drown yourself while youre in there.Hah hah.Unbuttoning his shirt, he came back to stand in the doorway.Dont suppose youd care to join me?Not tonight.I have KP duty.One call for take out pizza, and I could relieve you of that.She shook her head.See?Tenacious.She laughed and faced the fridge, prepared for a full on battle.When Brawley returned, his hair wet but combed, hed shaved and pulled on a clean shirt and pants.His feet were bare.He studied the table, then looked toward his fridge.You found all this in there?I cheated.Either your mom or Babs has been taking pity on you.You actually have a pretty well stocked freezer.Yeah, they both drop off casseroles once in a while.Annie and Sophie do, too.Not bad.So why arent you eating the food instead of stockpiling it?He shrugged.I forget its in there.By the time I leave the clinic, its late.I stop by the caf and Sally feeds me.No dishes to wash that way, either.Well, sit down.I think youll like this.Homemade chicken pot pie.Comfort food.He pulled out a chair and dropped into it.Smells good.It does that.She scooped him up a serving and set it in front of him.He looked exhausted and totally wrung out.As they ate, she wished she had some kind of magic wand to wave over him to take away the pain.But she didnt.Time would help, but nothing would ever completely erase it.He cleaned his plate, but she doubted hed tasted a thing.She yawned.Her body clock was on Eastern time.Time for bed, Brawley.Oh, yeah?He tried for cocky, but it fell short.Yes.Im tired, Maggie.So tired.He rubbed his eyes, then met hers.In the morning I have to go to the funeral home.Make arrangements.Ill go with you.His eyes, so sad, so sorrowful, stared into hers.Youre a good woman, Maggie Sullivan.With that, he headed into the bedroom, Marvin trailing behind.Scowling at the dog, Brawley scooped him up one handed and dumped him in the center of the bed.Spent a fortune on a fancy little bed for him, but the damned thing wont sleep in it.Ive tried shutting him out, but he yaps and yaps till I let him in with me.He unsnapped his jeans.Its not right.Id thought about a dog, but he was gonna be big.Masculine.Something useful.One that could hunt ducks or rabbits maybe.Instead, Im stuck with Marvin here.Kicking off his pants, tossing his shirt to the floor, Brawley flopped onto the bed, sprawled on top of the covers.Maggie walked into the room.Move.What?You need to turn back the covers and crawl between the sheets.Youll sleep better.He slid to the far side, and she pulled back the spread and top sheet.Grunting, he rolled over.When she leaned in to cover him, he caught her hand.I dont want you to go.I wont.Wordlessly, she stripped down to her T shirt and panties and slid in beside him.He wrapped himself around her and laid his head on her chest.Did you feel like this when our baby died?His question, so softly spoken, nearly took her down for the count.Maggie?Yes.Yes, Brawley, I did.Oh, God, Mags, Im so sorry.His hand tightened at her hip.I am, too.A sob tore through him.She ran her fingers through his hair and murmured words of comfort as they mourned both the loss of a friend and their baby.Brawleys tears soaked into her shirt.Shed never seen this Brawley.This vulnerable Brawley.Hed never shown her this side of himself, not even in their most intimate moments.This Brawley crawled beneath her skin and left her almost as defenseless as him.Lying in the dark beside him, listening to him grieve, another sound intruded.A quiet sound.A warning sound.The crumbling of the immunity shed built up against him in self protection.Was there a booster shotor an antibody?With a sinking heart, she accepted that she probably wouldnt avail herself of it even if it existed.Sometime after the midnight hour, she fell into an exhausted, troubled sleep.Twenty Eight  Since neither had thought to close the shades, early morning sunlight danced through the window and bounced over the bed.Brawley simply burrowed beneath his pillow.Marvin, sensing his person was awake, crawled across Maggie and snuggled up on top of Brawleys pillow.What the hell are you doing?he mumbled.Bet I can sell you to some truck driver heading back East.You want to take a ride, Marvin?Maggie fought to contain her laughter.The dog, head resting on his front paws, wagged his tail.She wished she had a camera.Grouchy in the morning, huh?
