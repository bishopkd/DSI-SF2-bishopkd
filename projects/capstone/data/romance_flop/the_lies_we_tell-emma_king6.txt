Its like you read my mind.Lets see what we can find.What we found was scotch, and plenty of it.We took a bottle and two glasses outside and made ourselves comfortable on the deck chairs.Water lapped gently on the shoreline somewhere in the distance and the moon was full as it began its journey through the sky.My family used to go to the beach every summer.Nick twirled the scotch in his glass as he spoke.My dad was a lawyer in a big firm and he worked way too many hours.But without fail, every August we headed to the beach, all six of us piled into the blue station wagon.Six?My parents and four kids  two boys and two girls.Youre the oldest?Is it that obvious?Nick laughed softly.Thats how I learned to be so bossy and arrogant.That explains it.The scotch burned as it coated my throat but I didnt mind.What about you?he asked hesitantly.Any siblings?One.Brother?Sister?Older?Younger?Nick probed.Brother.Younger.Nick sensed my reluctance to discuss it further but that didnt stop him.These are pretty basic questions, Charley.It shouldnt be this much of a struggle to get answers out of you.I know.He wasnt the first person to find my secretiveness unsettling.Usually I didnt care, but with Nick it was different.I wanted to tell him about my past, but I was having a hard time finding where to start.I finished my drink and held out my glass.Im going to need more if were going to continue down this path.Nick joined me in another drink, remaining quiet while I stayed lost in my head.He didnt seem to mind the silence.He wasnt one of those people that squirmed and fussed to fill the time; he just sipped his scotch and stared up at the sky.Tim was exactly one year younger than me, down to the day.Some kids wouldve hated sharing a birthday with their sibling, but I loved it.I always felt like no matter what, we would have this one day that was just ours and no one elses.Maybe thats why we were so close growing up, I dont know.But our close age also meant that we were in high school at the same time, and we ran in the same social circles.Tim was the life of every party, always clowning around.Everyone loved him.A dog barked loudly down the street and I was glad to have the distraction.It helped pull me from my revere.The problem with talking about Tim wasnt that I didnt want to talk about him  it was the opposite.I could talk about him for hours.Anyway, my senior year of high school was when everything changed.You know about the Morville Massacre, or at least you think you do.Everyone in the country was glued to their televisions that day.I was inside, watching my friends die.Nick reacted for the first time, the smallest of flinches.Charley, you dont have to talk about it if you dont want to.I want to, I said a little too urgently.Ive never been able to talk about it in the past, but now that Ive started I need to finish.Nick wisely topped off my glass and sat back again.It was a Monday, the Monday before prom and one month before graduation.Just saying those words took me all the way back to that day.People were excited.About prom and about the weather.It was the first really warm day of the year.Tim was wearing his baseball jersey because his team had a game that day.We were both in the lunchroom but we werent sitting at the same table.Tim was a couple of tables away, but close enough that I could hear him laughing.I barely noticed the first shot.It was loud in there with kids laughing and yelling and lunch trays clanging.It wasnt until the second shot when someone screamed that I realized something was wrong.Now that I was in the middle of it, I couldnt stop even if I wanted to.The words were coming out without any thought and the story told itself.The shooter, Ben Talbot, marching through the room weighed down with guns and ammunition.People bleeding and crying and screaming.Tim running over and shielding me, pushing me toward the exit when Bens back was turned.I was halfway down the hall before I realized Tim wasnt behind me.I stopped for just a second, wanting to run back for him but my body wouldnt let me.I froze  completely locked up by fear.The next thing I knew, a SWAT guy had thrown me over his shoulder and rushed me out of the building.I was about to reach for the bottle again but noticed that we had drained it, which was probably for the best.I had already developed a decent buzz.Tim was dead  shot in the back while he got me out of the room.Twenty four other kids died that day.I was the only one that made it out of the lunchroom alive.It had been years since I thought about any of them.Remembering Tim was emotional enough.So thats my story.Can we talk about something else now?Nick had been looking at me with that all too familiar look of pity that I hated.I knew that when people heard my story, they immediately saw me as a victim, someone that had been damaged by a terrible event.I never thought of myself as a victim but rather as someone who had been witness to a tragedy.Tim and those twenty four other kids had been victims, not me.Sure.Nick was quick to snap out of the pity party.Something you should know about tomorrows wedding.The groomsmen will be wearing kilts.All of them?I sat up in excitement.All of them.What about the groom?Im glad you asked.Craig will not be wearing a kilt.I slapped Nicks arm.That isnt fair!Nick laughed.I think the groomsmen would agree with you.Unfortunately, they lost the poker game and the kilts were their punishment.Craig actually was going to wear one, too, but his lovely bride, Carrie, found out and quickly forbade it.The groomsmen are getting their revenge by not wearing anything under the kilts.Im just glad this isnt an outdoor wedding.Though I suppose there could still be gusts of air in the chapel.I shuddered at the thought of flapping kilts and exposed dangly bits.And you thought this would just be another boring wedding.Nicks smile was contagious.In a matter of seconds he had allowed me to leave my past and rejoin the present.I havent even told you about the brides mother yet.So I leaned back and let Nick take over the conversation.He had a soothing voice and an engaging manner that had me hanging on every word.I couldve listened to him for hours.Only my excessive yawning betrayed how tired I felt.We should turn in, Nick said when he caught me stifling a yawn.Plenty of time to chat tomorrow.He picked up our glasses and empty bottle and I reluctantly followed him inside.Whenever I did finally let myself remember what happened that day ten years ago, I had nightmares about for days.Tonight would be no exception.Im glad you agreed to come with me this weekend, Nick said as he walked me to my assigned bedroom.We stopped in front of the open door, each of us awkwardly waiting for the other to make the first move.So far my only regret is that last glass of scotch.Nick smirked in an adorably cute way.I was just thinking my only regret was not encouraging you to have one more glass of scotch.I narrowed my eyes at him.Youre not trying to take advantage of me are you, Senator?Not yet.Nick took a small step forward and that was all the encouragement I needed in my semi drunk state.I grabbed the front of his shirt and twisted it in my hand, drawing him closer.His hand found the back of my neck and he guided my head toward his until our lips met in a drunken, searching kiss.He tasted like scotch and his lips were warm and inviting.Just as my body began to melt against his, Nick sighed heavily and pulled away.We shouldnt do this tonight, he said, slightly out of breath.
