All these years I believed that if he discovered the truth, he would hate my guts.Blame you?How could I blame you?She said this started when you were just fifteen.Fucking fifteen!Hes crying harder.Im sorry, Drew.I brought her into our lives and Im so goddamn sorry.I had no idea.No fucking clue she was doing that to you.How could I be so stupid, so selfish?So blind?Its not your fault, Dad Stop right there, juststop.Its all my fault.I shouldve paid better attention.I shouldve been there for you but I wasnt.I hate that.Ive let you down.He takes a deep, shuddering breath.Its over, son.My marriage is over.You dont have to worry about her being a part of our lives any longer.Shes no longer welcome in my home, in my heart, in my life.Im crying, too.The tears are falling and I sniff, trying to gain some control over my emotions.That tight feeling Ive been carrying in my chest for monthshell, yearsis slowly but surely easing.My dad knows the truth.And he doesnt hate me for it.When did she tell you?She called me hours ago.I have no idea where she is.Did you see her?Did she come there?God, shes twisted!I swear shes obsessed with you.I saw her.Fable tried to beat her up when she found out Adele had met her younger brother.Youre still with Fable?I thought you two broke up.He pauses for a moment.Wait a minute, does she know what happened between you and Adele?Yeah.My voice is a raspy whisper.Hes silent for a while, as if he needs time to process that bit of information.Things must be quite serious between you two.Sheshe figured it out when I brought her home.Adele had been less than subtle.That my father couldnt recognize her crazy, possessive behavior showed how oblivious he really was to it.Im an idiot.I hope someday you can forgive me.His words take my breath away.II feel the same way.Theres nothing for me to forgive.You were innocent in all of this.A little sob escapes him again.Im so sorry, son.For everything.We talk a little bit more and I promise to come see him soon.Hopefully going there without Adele present will remove the ghosts that haunt me in my old house.My dad needs me right now.I need to forget all those ghosts once and for all.I end the call and go back into the bedroom to find Fable sitting up, leaning against the pillows, the bedside table lamp on its lowest setting.She has the sheet tucked around her, her shoulders bare and gleaming in the soft light, and shes twirling a strand of long blond hair around her finger, staring at the ends.Shes beautiful.And so understanding, so accepting of all my secrets, I dont know what I did to earn her trust and forgiveness.I love that shes in my life.That she wants to be with me despite it all.Is everything okay?she asks, her voice hushed.Going to my side of the bed, I settle in beside her.That was my dad.I take a deep breath and stare straight ahead.Im almost afraid to look at her even though she knows everything.Adele told him what happened.How did he react?He doesnt hate me.He feels awful for what she did to me.See?Her voice is quiet.I told you he would be on your side.She did.I hadnt believed her.I guess you were right.I release a deep, shaky breath.I cant believe how accepting of me he was.Did she tell him aboutVanessa?Frowning, I turn to look at her.How could I have missed that?He never mentioned it.So Im assuming no.Fable lets the strand of hair shed been twirling fall from her fingers.Do you really think its true?That she was your daughter?I shrug.This is the information that makes me the most uncomfortable.I dont want to believe it.That I couldve been a father justblows my mind.I have a tough time talking about it with anyone, even my therapist.Its a subject I dont want to face.Especially since I havent a clue if its true or not.Theres no way I can prove it either way.Vanessas gone.I want to believe shes lying to me because its easier.Fable moves closer to me, resting her head on my shoulder, and I slip my arm around her.Closing my eyes, I voice what Ive been unable to say since the day Adele threw that bomb at me.The day we came back here, after I dropped you off at your apartment, I called Adele.I demanded she tell me the truth.She saidshe said she couldnt get pregnant with my dad so she decided to try with me.That she poked holes in the condom and she got pregnant.All it took was one time, she insisted.One freaking time.I hate her.I hate that she tricked my father and me.I hate what shes done to me.I hate that I let what happened between us control me for so long.Im sorry, Fable whispers.I close my eyes and trail my fingers across her shoulder, down her arm.I need to touch her.Having her close anchors me.Reminds me of how far Ive come in so little time.So am I.  But I cant remain in the past.I cant let what shes done cripple me for the rest of my life.I need to let it go.Let her go, once and for all.Easier said than done.Fable lifts her head so she can meet my gaze.Itll take time, Drew.Im here, though.Even though Im getting my own place, and I know you dont like that, Ill be here for you.I swear.You dont have to move I start but she cuts me off.I need to do it.I cant be dependent on you.Not like this.I want to take care of you, I whisper.I can do it.I have money.Youd never need anything if you and Owen lived here with me.She flashes me a quivery smile.I know.And I love that you want to help and take care of me.But I need to learn how to take care of myself first.She lifts her head and brushes her mouth against mine.I need to show Owen I can do this.I touch her throat and she shivers.I slip my hand around her nape and bring her in closer to me, our mouths meeting, our tongues tangling.She melts against me, slipping her arms around my neck, the sheet falling away from her so I feel nothing but soft, bare skin.After everything that happened today, my normal MO would be to run and hide.Pretend I dont exist.Focus on anything else but living.Feeling.Now, all I want to do is feel.Feel Fables mouth on mine, her hands on my body, her body moving against me.Press her into the mattress, explore her skin with my hands and lips, and push inside her, finding that connection with the one person who means more to me than anyone or anything in this world.As I stare into her eyes while buried deep in her welcoming body, I whisper that I love her.The smile she offers me in response, tender and so full of emotion, unravels me completely.She holds my heart in her hands.And for the first time in my life, I give it over to her completely.Freely.Fable Maguire owns me.And I know I own her.Fable Yesterday was one of the craziest days of my life.A whirlwind of emotions swept through me, from the highs to the lows and everything in between.I found the apartment of my dreams.I tried to beat the shit out of a woman who almost destroyed the man I love.The man I love was nearly brought to his knees when his father discovered his darkest secret.After the day we had, both of us were emotional wrecks.Somehow I still fell into Drews arms, too overcome to fight the powerful pull that tugs within both of us.That pull brings us together as if we cant resist each other.Its a fact.We justcant.We made love slowly, quietly.No teasing, no urgency.Just a fluid, delicious connection of bodies until we were both spent, falling asleep in each others arms like characters in the corniest movie youve ever seen on cable.Im the luckiest damn girl in the world.I know most girls would think Im crazy.Drew Callahan is definitely not whats on the surface.Hes troubled.He has issues, deep issues that arent resolved yet.I dont care.Hes mine.Despite being up half the night, I get up early and force Owen awake.Ply him with a real breakfast before I drive him to school using Drews truck.I need a car.More than I need furniture or anything else, a freaking car would come in real handy.I cant depend on Drew or Jen driving me forever.Colin mentioned a few days ago that he knew someone who manages a local dealership and could get me a deal.I might take him up on that offer.Smiling, I park Drews truck in his assigned spot and shut off the engine.For the first time since I dont know when, Ive surrounded myself with people who I can call my friends.Jen, T, ColinDrew.The list isnt long, but its getting there.I know my life isnt perfect, that Ill be facing more struggles.The issue with my mom is far from resolved.But for once in my life, I feel like Im in a good place.The weather turned dreary overnight, but the dark clouds heavy with rain dont spoil my mood.The wind whips up, bending the little trees that dot the apartment complex property, and I climb out of the truck, forcing the door open against an extra hard gust of air.I hit the keyless remote and start toward Drews apartment building, when I hear a voice straight out of my nightmares.Well, look at you.Moving in with him.Driving his truck.Arent you all cozy and snug in your seemingly perfect little life?I turn to find Adele standing before me, a smirk on her face.She looks odd.Still wearing the same clothes from yesterday, her hairs a mess, as if she hasnt brushed it, and her eyes are wide as she stares at me.A huge, expensive looking dark brown leather purse is slung over her shoulder and she clutches it close.Weirdly close.What are you doing here?I try to keep my voice casual but shes freaking me out a little.Somethings not quite right with this picture.Looking for you.She smiles.A chill trickles down my spine at the sight of that weird smile.Yeah, right.No, really.I wanted to talk to you.Maybe we should go somewhere and chat.She waves a hand behind her.My car is around the corner.Lets go.Like Ill just take off with her because were best friends and all.The woman is delusional.Slowly shaking my head, I start toward Drews apartment.I dont think so.She steps in front of me, halting my progress, and I glare at her.Listen, I dont want any trouble.Just let me get by, okay?No.Her smile grows.Its really creeping me out.Drew cant save you now.Youre coming with me.She reaches inside her bag and pulls out a handgun, aiming it right at me.I blink slowly and throw my hands up in surrender, backing up a step.The woman is crazed.All that talk about your life flashing before your eyes right before you think youre going to die?Yeah, thats happening to me at this very moment.Making me realize Ive hardly lived my life at all.No way am I going to let some greedy maniac bitch take it all away from me.Dont make a scene.The wind blows her hair across her face and she bats it away with her free hand, causing her to wave the gun around.I take another small step back, contemplating trying to run for it, but I have no idea if that guns loaded or not.Or if shes a good shot.Id rather not take that chance.Im not making a scene, I murmur, trying to keep my voice even.Calm.What do you want from me, Adele?She throws back her head and laughs.Everything about her actions is exaggerated.Over the top.I want everything you have.Well, not necessarily everything.Youre an ugly little slut who deserves nothing, you know that?Her words are so full of venom I almost recoil.Instead, I stand my ground.Let me get by.Ill forget this ever happened if you just let me go.No.She waves the gun again, pointing it right at me.You know what I really want?I wish you would justdisappear.That would make my life so much easier.No more worrying about Andrew falling in love with a whore.I could have him all to myself.I deserve him, you know.I created him.I made him the man he is today.I dont argue with her.Have a feeling she wouldnt listen anyway.My husband hates me, she continues, clearly on a roll.Did you hear about that?Of course you did.I try to be honest with him so he understands me better and instead he tells me he never wants to see me again.According to my husband, I destroyed both him and his son.And my daughter.Tears streak down her cheeks, a little sob escaping her.Doesnt he see how much he destroyed me?How they both destroyed me after Vanessas death?Its their fault shes gone.I can almostnot quite, but almostfeel sorry for her.The death of any family member is horrible.The death of a small child must be absolutely devastating.Both of the Callahan men hate my guts and I have nothing to live for anymore.Absolutely nothing.Its all your fault, you know, Adele says matter of factly.My jaw practically drops to the ground.And I almost felt sorry for her?How is it my fault?You came into his life and ruined everything.Everything.You made Andrew want to reveal the truth.You made him stay away from me.He was mine, you stupid bitch.All mine until you came along and stole him away from me.He was never really hers.But you cant argue with crazy.You destroyed me, so now Im going to destroy you.That gun is aimed right at me.Lets take Andrews truck.I like the idea of all of this happening in something he owns.This way, hell never forget.All of this happeningoh God, what is she talking about?Im not going anywhere with you.She straightens out her arm, that gun coming dangerously close to me.Go unlock the fucking truck right now.I do as she asks, hitting the keyless remote again, the wrong button this time.The one that sets the horn alarm off.Stupid bitch, she mutters just as the door to Drews apartment swings open.Hes standing there, clad only in a pair of sweatpants that hang loose on his hips, and I see the greedy, lustful gleam that fills Adeles gaze when she sees him.I think Im going to be sick.His eyes widen when he sees the gun in Adeles hand.He looks at me, panic in his eyes, his expression grim.What the hell is going on?Shut that fucking thing off!Adele screams and I hit the button, silencing the car.I turn my gaze on Drew, trying to convey everything I can to him in that one long look.And then it hits me.I know exactly what I need to say thatll let him know this is serious.Not that a gun isnt serious, because holy shit, I hate her shaky grip, the way she waves that gun around.How completely unhinged she is.This bitch is close to losing her shitand she wants me to take the fall for all her troubles.Hey, Drew, I say, raising my voice, tipping my head in Adeles direction.Marshmallow.Ill be here for you.Always.Drew Callahan  Drew I called 911 right before I opened the door.I dont know what compelled me to peek through the front window but Im so fucking glad I did.Adele is standing there pointing a gun at Fablehell!I almost bolted outside right then.But I knew I needed to keep a calm head.Fables life was at stake here.I needed to handle this right.So I told the emergency operator there was a crazy woman waving a gun around my parking lot and hung up.Now the crazy woman is looking straight at me.I recognize that look.For a moment, I feel like Im fifteen again.Trapped, with nowhere to go.Hating myself for whats about to happen.Wishing I were strong enough to tell her no.That awful helplessness is winding its way through me, paralyzing me for one long, agonizing moment.And then my girl says the magic word, the one that automatically springs me into action.Adele.Put the gun down.My voice is firm.I dont want her to argue with me.No.Her voice is shaky, as is the smile she flashes at me.Shes ruined my life, Andrew.Its all her fault.Its not her fault.Its mine.I start down the sidewalk toward where theyre standing.Im sorry for what I did to you.She frowns.Tears dampen her cheeks; her eyes are filled with so much sadness.This woman is completely broken.Lost.Yet I cant work up an ounce of sympathy for her.Everything thats happened to her, shes brought on herself.Youre not sorry.Adele shakes her head.None of you are.You dont care what happens to me.How Ive lost everything.Where am I supposed to go now?What am I supposed to do?I focus all of my attention on Adele.Im worried about Fable.I hate that Adele is pointing a gun at her.But I cant let the fear grip me.I need to save my girl.A divorce isnt the end of the world.Yes, it is!Adele wails, waving the gun around.Im ruined.I have nothing.Nothing to live for.Put the gun down, I say softly.Shes scaring me.I chance a look at Fable and her posture is rigid, her shoulders back.She looks almost defiant.But I note the fear in her gaze, the way her lips tremble subtly.Shes scared as hell.So am I.  I should just shoot her now and put her out of her misery, Adele mutters.No!I clamp my lips shut, pissed that I yelled at her.I just showed my hand and hope like hell it didnt register with Adele.Youll go to jail.Do you want that?To spend the rest of your life in prison?Adele shrugs.It doesnt matter anymore.Nothing matters anymore.Shoot me, then, I say, stepping in front of Fable.If youre going to do it, shoot me.You cant blame Fable.She has nothing to do with any of this.She has everything to do with it.She stole you from me, Andrew.You were mine.You belonged to me.And then you left me.You found someone else.You bring her back home and flaunt her all over the place.Shes pretty and young and gets to be with you whenever she wants.Adele aims the gun right at my chest.I hate her!You hate me, I remind her.Im the one who rejected you, who pushed you away.Its my fault.Fable presses her fingers against the middle of my back.That one little touch fuels me, makes me stronger.Clears my head and allows me to focus on what I need to do.Slowly, I reach out toward Adele.Give me the gun.She shakes her head furiously.No.Give it to me.Fuck you!She stretches out her arms straight in front, both hands gripping the gun tight, her index finger sneaking around the trigger.Step out of the way, Andrew.No.Give.Me.The.Gun.Oh, God.Adeles voice cracks, her arms trembling, the gun wavering.This isnt going to work, Andrew.I cant shoot you.I love you too much.Thats what I hoped for, though I hate her choice of words.She doesnt love me; she has some sort of weird obsession with me.Then hand the gun over.I cant.I have to do this.She drops her arms, the gun hanging from her fingers at her side.You give me no choice.Fable presses closer to me, resting her head against my back.All I can think about is her safety.Forget me, forget Adele, forget everything and everyone else.I need Fable to be okay.Give you no choice for what?I ask Adele.To do this.Its all your fault, Andrew.Never forget that.Adele places the barrel of the gun in her mouth.And pulls the trigger.Fable Drew turns to me, buries his head against my hair as he clutches me so tight, I cant breathe.Seconds later, I hear the sound of a gunshot.Its so loud my ears are ringing.I cant hear a thing.All I feel is Drew wrapped tight around me, his chest heaving, his arms shaking as they hold me close.Fuck me, she just shot herself, I think I hear him say and I try to pull away from him.But he wont let me go.People start coming out of their apartments, the sound of gunfire no doubt drawing their attention.The ringing in my ears slowly lessens.I hear gasps, one woman yelling to call the cops.Still Drew wont let me go.Dont look, he whispers close to my ear.You dont want to see her.Dont look, Fable.Worry clutches at my chest.Did he witness her doing it?I dont think so.He turned and grabbed me just before the gun went off.But I dont know.God, I hope he didnt see.I dont think my Drew can take much more tragedy and sorrow.Hes already endured enough.Someone approaches us.I can hear footsteps and I glance up, catching sight of a guy who looks around our age.Are you all right?he asks.Drew lifts his head and I glance up at him.I see the anguish, the sorrow etched all over his face.I also see tiny splatters of blood dotting his shoulders.Oh, God.Were okay.Did someone call an ambulance?Dude.The man tips his head to look past us and immediately looks away.Theres no need for an ambulance.Theres no saving her.I tighten my grip around Drews waist.Has someone called the police?Yeah, they should be on their way, the man says, his face grim.As if on cue, I hear the sirens in the near distance, coming closer and closer.Theyre going to want to talk to us.I so dont want to deal.I need to drop off my apartment deposit today.I need to go to work.Normal, everyday stuff.But my life is far from normal.I couldve been killed.I could be the one lying on the ground, blood pouring out of my body.Drew saved me.He stepped in front of me and told Adele to shoot him.I cant believe he did that.That he would sacrifice himself for meblows my mind.Makes me realize just how much he loves me.He finally relaxes his hold on me, and I pull away from him slightly so I can see his face.Did you see her do it?I ask.I have to know.Slowly he shakes his head, his gaze never leaving mine.I saw her put the gun in her mouth but I turned just as she was pulling the trigger.I couldnt watch that.He exhales on a shaky breath.I hated her, Fable.But I couldnt stand there and watch her blow her brains out.I close my eyes and press my forehead to his firm chest.Thank you, I whisper.You saved me.Ill always save you.You never have to worry about that.I finally, finally believe him.Two people in love, alone, isolated from the world, thats beautiful.Milan Kundera  Seven months later Fable Drew and I were never believers in the fairy tale.We both had our own issues, our problems, our fucked up home lives that blew all thoughts of happily ever after right out of the water.Once upon a time, we were cynics facing the world alone.Our story changed into that of two warrior cynics facing the world together.Now, we own the happily ever after and we refuse to let that bitch go.I watch him now, sitting on the sidelines of the football field.Its hot, even though its only nine in the morning, and the summer sun is intense.I have a pretty nice tan already from sitting out here for hours watching Drew practice with his team.Hes sorta dreamy out there on the field.I love watching him play.Hes so talented, so in command of his teammates and his game play.Rumors are already spreading of how his chance at an NFL contract is getting closer and closer.Once upon a time, that wouldve scared the crap out of methe thought of him leaving me behind.Or maybe hed want me to go along with himand that wouldve scared me, too.Now I take everything day by day.No need for panic.When the time comes for a decision to be made, I know well do the right thing.Together.I love how sweaty my man gets when he plays, too.Does that make me a freak?Oh, I put on a big show when he grabs me and hugs me after practice, complaining loudly how gross he is, all stinky and damp.But Im lying.I love it.Hes coming toward me now during a break, a big grin on his face, and I stand, offering him a big smacking kiss before I hand over a fresh bottle of water.He takes it from me, tears off the cap, and chugs every last drop within a few swallows.Did I mention how sexy he is when he drinks?No?Well.Im tempted to fan myself every time I watch him.Did you put on sunblock?he asks, crushing the empty plastic bottle in his fist before he hands it back to me.I clutch the bottle in my hand.Maybe.He taps the tip of my nose with his index finger.Youre turning pink.You need some.His concern for me is slightly over the top.Since what happened with Adele, hes been very overprotective.From always being there to pick me up when my shift is over at work to slathering on enough sunblock to his satisfaction, he wants to make sure Im safe.I appreciate it more than hell ever know.Im trying to get a tan, I tell him.Youre pretty tan already, baby.He draws his finger across my bared shoulder, sending a shiver through me.You know what my favorite thing in the world right now is?I frown.Where is he going with this?What?He leans in close, his mouth hovering just at my ear.Your tan lines, he whispers.And the fact that Im the only one who gets to see them.Im blushing.That he can still do that with a few words, a mere look, blows my mind.Youre bad, I say when he pulls away from me.A grin flashes.You like it.He glances over his shoulder, checking out his teammates.Look, you should go on home.Its too damn hot out here for you to sit around.Ill be done in a few hours, okay?I nod, sad hes kicking me out.But hes right.Owens around here somewhere, helping out with carrying the equipment, organizing stuff, handing out water and whatever else is needed.Drew got him the job, though its more of a volunteer thing.Owen doesnt care.Hes thrilled to be hanging out with a bunch of cool football players.Plus, its keeping him busy.Keeping him out of trouble.Ill see you later?Drew asks, grabbing my hand so he can pull me in for a kiss.Of course.I dont work today.My job at The District is still going strong.Colin is a pretty great boss.I think he has the serious hots for Jen and shes either blind or doesnt want to see it.That place is like a hotbed for juicy sexy scandal.Not that I play a part in any of it.Im riding the happily ever after wave with Drew, remember?Im taking you out tonight.Dont forget, okay?He smiles at me and I smile back.We havent had much time to go out lately.Not that we really care.We prefer to stay home and watch movies.Make out a lot on the couch, as Owen likes to complain.I did end up moving into that apartment with Owenand Drew.After what happened with Adele in the parking lot, right in front of his old place, he wanted out of there.I was the one who offered for him to move in with me after a long discussion with Owen, making sure he was okay with it.Which he was.Now were like one big, happy family.Where are you taking me?Thats a surprise.His eyes darken, his expression turning ultra serious.I love you.You know that, right?I frown.Yeah, I know.I love you, too.Lots.Lots?Mega lots.Sounds like a discount store.He grins and kisses me again as if he cant help himself.Come on, Callahan!Quit smooching on your girl and get over here!one of his teammates yells, making us both laugh.I watch him jog back to where theyre all standing in the middle of the field, my gaze never leaving him.Hes so gorgeous.Hes endured so much, yet this is truly the happiest Ive ever seen him.Ive gone with him to a few sessions with Dr.Harris and she pulled me aside at the last one, wanting to talk to me privately.She said she believes I heal him.That the reason hes been able to cope so well with the aftermath of Adeles suicide and the near mental breakdown of his father is the unconditional support I offer him so freely.Its only right, considering what he does for me.My mom has mostly fallen off the face of the earth.I can deal for the most part, but her disappearance has been a struggle for Owen.He doesnt know how to handle it.Since Drew remembers what its like to be an angry, screwed up teenage boy, he spends a lot of time with my brother.To the point that one night, as we were drifting off to sleep, Drew confessed that if this football thing didnt work out for him, he was considering staying in school so he could become a counselor and help troubled teens.I threw my arms around him and told him I thought that was a great idea.He has the kindest, sweetest heart you could ever know.Hes funny, hes smart, and he knows just what to say to make me smile.Though he does get grumpy when things dont go his way.Oh, and also when hes hungry.Hes too much of a neat freak and Im sort of a slob, so thats caused a few fights.I get hormonal and sort of bitchy during that time of the month, so he tends to steer clear.My job stresses me out, and I like to tell him he has no idea what Im stressing over since he doesnt work a real job.Oh, that really pisses him off.I only said it once.I learn from my mistakes.Mostly.We argue.But we always make upand that means makeup sex, which is awesome.We finally did it doggy style months ago and Im a total fan.No nipple rings, though.He wont let me.Though we did get matching tattoos on the insides of our right wrists a few weeks ago.Our initials entwinedD+F.We laugh together a lot.Weve also cried a few times.Hes trying to heal his relationship with his dad.Im trying to come to terms with the fact that my mom is never coming back.Our relationship is not perfect.Drew Callahan isnt perfect either.But I wouldnt have him any other way.Drew Im nervous as fuck about tonight and wonder for about the eight millionth time if Im doing the right thing.I try to ignore the doubt that lingers in my mind as I pace the living room, waiting for Fable to come out of the bathroom and finally announce shes ready to go.Sometimes she takes too damn long getting herself all primped up, or whatever it is girls do.Ive told her before that I love her just the way she is.Makeup, no makeup.Pretty dress, old raggedy shorts and T shirtwhatever shes wearing, Im all for it.Shes gorgeous.But then shell blow my mind walking out of that bathroom after being in there for a solid hour and I forget all about my impatience.Shes pretty good at that trick.Shes pretty good at a lot of tricks.You need to chill.I turn to find Owen watching me, amusement lighting his green eyes.What do you mean?I ask.Youre all anxious and crazy.Stop worrying.Shes going to fucking love it.He slaps a hand over his mouth.Dont tell her I said that.Dont worry about it.I shake my head.The kid has a foul mouth, but so do Fable and I.  How can we give him grief when we cant lead by example?Seriously, dude.Shes going to love your surprise.Love.It.Youll make her cry.Owen shakes his head.You must be pretty far gone over my sister to want to do this already.I cant live without her.And that is no lie.We belong together.Why not make it official?I sound confident, but I have a major case of nerves.Im taking her out to dinner at The District because Colinwho Im friends with now, unbelievableoffered up the private room for us to use.I jumped at it, because no way am I going to do this and make a spectacle of myself.What if she says no?She wont say no.Her scent precedes her, light and floral, making me long for her.And then she appears, coming down the hall with a little smile on her face, wearing a pale pink sundress that makes her skin look even more golden.All I see is legs and arms, and the material of the dress is so thin I can practically see through it when the light hits her just right.Fable.I clear my throat.Youre not going out in that, are you?She twirls around, the flared skirt flying out, offering me a tantalizing glimpse of bare, slender thighs.You dont like it?I fucking love it.I glance around, thankful Owens disappeared.I hear the click of his door closing.Smart kid.I can see through it.You can?She glances down with a frown.But I dont want to change.I slip my right hand into my pocket, fumbling around with the tiny box thats nestled within.I dont want her to change either.She looks amazing.But I dont want anyone else seeing her in that dress.Where are we going?she asks when I dont say anything.Uh, The District?Now shes frowning harder.Uh oh.Youre kidding.I work there all the time.I want to get away from that place, not hang out there on my night off.Im messing this up.I can already feel it.Shuffling my feet, I study the carpet, my brain scrambling to come up with a different plan.Drew.I glance up to find her watching me, her gaze narrowed.Whats up with you?Are you okay?Fuck it.Im doing this now before I totally lose my nerve and really screw up.I go to her without a word and take her hand, falling to my knee in front of her.What are you doing?she whispers, her eyes wide, her hand cold in my grip.Fable, I love you.I want you to be a permanent part of my life forever.I clear my throat, notice how her fingers are trembling.We havent been together very long, but when something feels so right and so good, you know you dont want to ever let it go.Ohmigod.Her voice is a breathy rasp as I reach inside my jeans pocket and pull out the little box thats been burning a hole in my mind ever since I bought the damn thing over a week ago.What is that?Let me show you.My fingers are shaky as I lift the lid, revealing the simple round solitaire engagement ring within.I want you to marry me.Her eyes widen as she studies the diamond, her mouth hanging open.She finally lifts her gaze to meet mine, tears sparkling in her eyes.Youre serious.This girl is truly, truly going to drive me out of my mind.Im definitely serious.I love you.I love you, too.But marriage?she squeaks as she reaches out and touches the diamond with the tip of her index finger.Marriage.I want to make this all about the forever.I drop her hand only for a moment, taking the ring out of the box so I can put it on her finger.She holds out her hand, her fingers quivering as I slip the ring on.Its a perfect fit.The ring looks perfect on her finger.And this girl is perfect for me.She brings her hand up to her face, admiring the ring close up.Oh my God, Drew, its so beautiful.Youre beautiful, I say.But I need an answer.Dont leave a man hanging.Yes.She grins as I stand and draw her into my arms.Yes, yes, yes.Ill be your wife.Are you sure youre ready to take me on?Leaning in, I kiss her.Hell yeah.I know I drive you crazy, she murmurs softly.I press my forehead to hers and stare into her pretty green eyes, winding my arms around her slender waist.You keep me sane, I whisper.You make my life worth living.Because of you, Im a better man.And with you by my side as my wife, we can take on the entire world, baby.Just you and me.She sighs, pressing her lips to mine in a soft kiss.You are so romantic.Is it wrong to admit I was sort of hoping for a poem?Hell.I completely forgot.Pulling away from her, I dig in my other pocket, withdrawing a crumpled piece of paper.I labored over this one, hoping to get the words just right.I planned on giving it to her before I actually showed her the ring.I wrote you one.You did not.She takes the paper from me and unfolds it.Did so, I say with a grin, waiting anxiously as she reads it.Most of the time Im thinking of you All of the time I love you Remembering the good times and the bad So much has Happened and Maybe Im moving too fast All I know is I Love you.And want to Live with you Only you Will you be my wife?Oh shit!Shes crying, tears flowing down her beautiful face, mascara streaking her cheeks with black.My makeups ruined, damn it.I laugh.I cant help it.Did you like it?I love it.She bursts into full on tears now and I pull her into my arms, hold her close.I love you, she whispers against my neck.Were going to make this happen, Fable.You and me.I kiss her forehead.Together.Together, she agrees.Forever.
