The lone survivor of the Morville High School Massacre.You make it sound so creepy.It had been at least two years since I had heard anyone mention that part of my past.The shock of it never faded.So thats my big secret.Now you know.Neither of us said anything for a long time.Nick finally waved the waitress over and ordered us another round of drinks.When she was gone, he said, Im sorry I pushed the issue.Its none of my business.Dont worry about it.You were much more tactful about it than most people.I couldnt remember a time when I hadnt been bombarded with questions once someone found out about my past.Lets try a different line of questioning, Nick said as the waitress returned with our beers.Charley  is that short for anything?Charlotte.I allowed a small smile.My mother was a big Bronte fan.Not Emily or Anne?Apparently not.I always thought Charlotte was the most interesting Bronte sister.I laughed.Youre telling me that you have actually spent time considering which Bronte sister was the most interesting?What can I say, Im a man of layers.You just have to peel them back one at a time to get a full appreciation of my many facets.Kind of like an onion.Ill take that as a compliment.Take it any way youd like.Nick smirked.I like where this date is headed.Twenty four hours earlier, I had never met Nick Cooper.I had heard his name on the news and read about his personal life in the gossip blogs.I thought he was arrogant, condescending and smug.Fast forward one day and I was on a date with that very same man, no longer caring if he was arrogant or smug.I no longer cared because he was also charming and funny.Despite all the reasons to the contrary, I liked Nick Cooper and for some unknown reason, he seemed to like me, too.It took another five rounds of beer and four more hours of conversation before either of us thought to check the time.I was the one to call it quits first.I had a nice time, I said as Nick walked me back to my building.It was late, and there was no one else on the quiet side street.You sound surprised.Nicks arm brushed against mine and neither of us moved away.Ill try not to be insulted.You shouldnt take it personally.Im a tough woman to please.Ive noticed.We were in front of my place now but I wasnt ready to leave Nick yet.If you wanted to do this again sometime, Id probably say yes.Thats good news for me because I need a favor.I never agreed to a favor.I promise, its not that bad.Nick grimaced.Okay, its a little bad.But I will owe you one.Out with it.I crossed my arms and tapped my foot.I have a wedding to attend this weekend and I need a date.Nick actually looked embarrassed.If I dont bring someone, Ill spend the entire wedding answering questions about Heidi.Id rather have a root canal on every tooth than do that.I had to admit, that did sound pretty torturous.Whos getting married?An old friend.Craig.Nick gave me a hopeful look.So what do you say?You in?He didnt know it yet but I didnt have the willpower to say no to Nick.Okay.Im in.Great.Ill pick you up Friday night at 8:00.Pack a bag.A bag?For a wedding?Nicks smile was half sheepish, half charming.Did I forget to mention that the wedding is in Virginia?It mustve slipped your mind.I rolled my eyes.A weekend away together after one date?Do you really think that is a good idea?Charley, I have been on a dozen first dates in the last month.Friends of friends, blind dates, women I met in coffee shops.You think this is helping your cause?I asked with the raise of a skeptical eyebrow.Nick held up a halting hand.Let me finish.Ive been on a dozen first dates, but not a single second date.Those women were beautiful, sweet, smart...and completely boring.None of them challenged me  not like you.So you can be confident that Im not taking this lightly.I dont know if that makes me feel better.In fact, I could feel panic building in my chest.Nick was one of the most direct people I had ever met.You trusted me earlier and we had a wonderful evening, Nick reminded me.Im just asking you to trust me again.I promise you wont regret it.If I was a slightly more interesting person, I wouldve already had plans for the weekend.But I was a boring person who spent nearly all her time at work or at work related events.I had no life, but now Nick Cooper was offering me one.A weekend in Virginia with a handsome, powerful man that had no problem holding my interest and claimed to be equally enamored with me.I would be a complete idiot if I said no.Okay, I agreed.Lets do it.Friday, October 9th The Daily Scandal Washingtons #1 Source for Breaking Political News and Politicians Making News Washingtons mayor, Brad Hutchinson, spoke out again today against the legalization of gay marriage.Hutchinson has long been known for his conservative approach to social issues despite being a registered Democrat.More interestingly, the distinguished mayor has also been the victim of the D. C.  rumormill alleging that he is a closeted homosexual, despite being married to a woman.In other news, Senator Cooper was spotted at a bar dazzling the same mystery woman that he entertained earlier this week at a downtown hotel.This is the first time the Senator has been spotted with the same women on two separate occasions since he announced the end of his engagement.Could things be heating up between these two?THREE You rented a beach house for the weekend?I gave the house a slow once over while Nick got our bags out of the trunk of his car.After nearly three hours of driving, the night sky had settled in and it was hard to see much of anything.I dont really like hotels, Nick explained.Besides, why be locked up in a stuffy hotel all weekend when we can have our very own slice of paradise.Paradise?In Nowhereville, Virginia?The town was so small I hadnt even been able to find it on my phones navigation system.Scoff now but youll be eating those words in the light of day.Nick hefted the bags and led the way to the front door.And its Collinsburg, Virginia.In a matter of seconds, he had unlocked the door, dropped our bags in the hallway and turned on the lights.Nick moved around the house confidently, giving me a quick tour before carrying our bags toward the bedrooms.You sure seem to know your way around, I commented.I know the owner, he replied.You can take the master bedroom.It has a nice bathroom and a balcony facing the beach.Make yourself at home and let me know if you need anything.I hesitated at the threshold of my assigned room.Thank you, Nick.He sensed my reluctance to step inside.Whats wrong?Nothing is wrong.Things were actually right for a change.Im not really tired yet.Any chance theres something to drink in this place?Nick grinned.
