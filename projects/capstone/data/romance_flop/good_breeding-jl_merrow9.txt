Oh, darling, Mummy sighed.Im so sorry.Do you want to talk about it?S all right, Mrs F.  Ill look after him.Oz put a brawny arm around Giless shoulder, the gesture of solidarity only slightly undermined by his explosive, eighty proof belch in Giless face.Mummy smiled.In fact, both of her did.In that case, Ill leave you boys to it.Now, Ive brought you each a pint of water, so dont even think of going to bed before you drink it.She left, and Oz took a swig of water.He gave another belch, this one slightly less flammable.Ive never thought Hugh was good enough for you.I was at school with him, you know.Oh?Giles hiccupped.Pardon me.Hes never mentioned you being friends.Yeah, well, he wouldnt, would he?Cause we werent.Catch him being matey with the scholarship boy, Oz added, his tone suddenly bitter.Giles stared, as the words filtered through his befuddled brain.Ozs voice sounded different, too.Just like it had at Angies.Yeah, thats right, Oz said, sticking his chin out.I got in on a scholarship, cause no way could my mum and dad afford to send me to private school.Why are you talking funny?Giles asked.Oz laughed, but it wasnt a very happy sound.Im not.Ive just stopped talking funny.See, you take a lad from a council estate and send him to some posh school, hes either going to start talking posh like the rest of them or get his bloody teeth kicked in.This is how I grew up talking.He stopped, and swigged some more water.You know where I grew up?Not ten streets away from your real mum.The chav.His arm slipped from around Giless shoulder, and he sat rigidly, staring into the blackness of the garden.Giless head was spinning.I dontI think He lurched to a standing position.I think I need to go to bed.* * * *  Next morning, Giles woke up slumped face down on top of his bed, wearing only his shirt, which was bunched up under his armpits, and one sock.The cup of tea cooling by his bedside quelled any hopes that Mummy might not have been in and seen him in such a humiliating state.Levering himself painfully upright, Giles drank the lukewarm, stewed tea.He dressed, and then staggered, shame faced and heavy headed, downstairs.Oz was sitting moodily at the kitchen table, glaring at a half eaten slice of toast.Giless stomach lurched in sympathy.Ive been a total arse, havent I?Giles said, taking a seat opposite his friend.They both winced as the chair scraped ear splittingly on the terracotta tiles.Oz gave him a weak smile.Not a total arse.Half an arse, maybe.A single buttock.His voice was back to normal.Giles wasnt sure he liked it.You dont have to pretend to be posh for me, he said, trying to smile.Oz shrugged.Sometimes even I dont know which is my real accent any more.He gave a twisted smile.
