A swimming pool with a grotto.And that rain forest with colorful poison dart frogs.She dug her nail into the plastic seam of the controller and bit her lip.This had been their escape, when the pressures of school and no money and racist assholes got to them.It was where they dreamed of what they wanted, once they graduated college.But then Tates dad got sick, and she made a bad decision and those dreams were gone.Except they werent erased.Because they were here, in this stupid video game.Tate straightened her spine and hit the START button, pulling up her saved games.She clicked on the saved Ruiz game, typed in the passwordpinkiepie, after her favorite My Little Pony characterand then there it was.Their blue house with the yellow gerbera daisies in the front garden.All the characters could be controlled by the same user.Or, since the game was connected online, theyd often played together when Cam was at his house and she was at hers.It was fun to talk to each other through the characters.As Tate stared at the TV with her stomach churning, the game resumed where theyd left it the day before Cam left.Their two characters sat on the front porch swing, drinking beer together, Tates head on Cams shoulder.She laughed, because Cam wore only a pair of camo shorts and work boots, which was the closest they could come to a military uniform in the game.She wore black pants and a black shirt and a black veil, in mourning because he was leaving.Cam had laughed when hed seen her outfit, and then his character kissed hers, and then they kissed in real life and itd been a while before theyd picked up their controllers again.She pressed the A button on her controller, which brought up suggested dialogue, as well as a blank box for her to type in her own.She hesitated.If Cam signed in to the game, he could see anything she did, replaying previous scenes with a click of a button.But he probably didnt even have the game anymore.And if he did, there was no way hed sign in.There were many things she wanted to say to Cam, but after last night, she knew what she wanted to say most at this moment.She clicked on it.Her character in the game raised her head, looked at Cam, and said, Thank you.Afterward, Tate saved the game and shut it off, then crawled into bed and hugged her pillow.She closed her eyes and pictured Cams face when he had looked at her on the front porch, so close to hers, his lips parted.She swore he was going to kiss her, and there was no way shed recover from that.Seeing Cam again made her want all the things she couldnt have.And that was a distraction.She needed to stay home and take care of her dad and Jamie.She couldnt live that life with Cam theyd dreamed of.But Cam deserved those dreams.He was a good man.A brilliant, determined man.And he should have that cute house and dog and swimming pool.A girl he loved who loved him back.He shouldnt be here in this town.The thought of him living here again, working as a bouncer after everything theyd been through, made her blood pump hot with anger.She hadnt realized his mom was struggling.Not that his mother would let Tate know anyway since she never liked Tate in the first place.Accepting Cams help wasnt an easy choice.She wanted to resist because, come fall, hed probably be gone, starting his future in the Big Apple with his fancy job.And she was happy for him.But shed still be here in this town, with only a high school diploma, working at a diner while trying to keep her dad alive and her brother out of jail.Tate considered herself a strong person, but shed been strong onceor so she thoughtand look where it had gotten her.Cam was her weakness.And she resigned herself to the fact he always would be.She didnt know how long she lay there in the early morning, drifting in and out of sleep, between the real world in her bedroom and the dream world where she was on a porch swing with Cam.Eventually the noises of her household set her permanently in the real world.She stretched and rose, padding out of her room and down the hall to the bathroom.While doing her business, she wondered how the hell she was going to deal with Jamie today.Last night, hed shut himself in his room by the time she made it back in the house, and she was too tired and drained at the time to deal with him.Today, though?That was another story.When she walked out of the bathroom, her father was on his way toward her.You need help?she asked.Im good, baby.Tate walked past Jamies door, which was still shut.She was tempted to bang on the door and drag him out by his hair or his ear or his ankle, whichever was more painful, but she needed coffee first.Shed at least been conscious enough to make the coffee last night so all she had to do was press the START button.She stood in front of it, staring at it as it brewed, like that would make it work faster.She heard her father shuffle into the kitchen and lower himself on a chair at the table.Toast okay?she asked him.Do we still have some of that quince jelly?His voice was hopeful and although she hated to give him the sugar, it made him happy.Just had Anne pick up some more.Her father made a face she couldnt decipher, and Tate turned away from him so he didnt see her smile.She always thought Anne and her father had feelings for each other, but neither was willing to make the first move.Except for this weird quince jelly arrangement.Which Tate didnt think was very romantic, but whatever.Her father was a month out from his second round of chemotherapy.It had taken a while to get his strength up to begin this second round and he was slowly starting to come back into himself.She hoped this was it, that hed beaten the lung cancer once and for all.But she knew hed never fully recover.Hed lost too much weight and muscle mass.They had some pension money from his factory job, but they had to budget everything down to pennies.Which was one reason they sold her fathers car.He never drove much anyway.Jamie had bought his old sedan for less than a thousand dollars, and he needed it for his pizza delivery job.Tate had thought about finding another job, but the diner paid her well and gave her the flexibility to take her father to his appointments.And when her whole life was spinning out of control, it was nice to have a place that grounded her.Where she knew exactly where she was supposed to be and what she was supposed to be doing.She poured herself a cup of coffee and turned around, eyeing her dad over the rim of her mug as she took a sip.How are ya feeling today?He shrugged as the toaster popped.Tate slathered it with margarine and quince jelly and slid the plate in front of him along with a large glass of apple juice.He picked up a slice, which Tate cut into triangles just to annoy him, and took a bite.Fine, he mumbled around a mouthful of bread and jelly.Did you have a good time last night?Her father didnt always sleep well, a mixture of feeling ill and the medication he was on, which gave him the jitters, but apparently last night, some god had smiled on her, because he seemed not to have a clue what had gone on.She took another sip of her coffee.Yep.She glared down the hallway, silently daring Jamie to show his face right now so she could tear him a new asshole.But he didnt show.And so she silently seethed.There was a knock at the front door and a feminine Hello?Then Van came into the kitchen holding a wax paper bag, large sunglasses covering her eyes.She plopped the bag on the counter and then took her glasses off, sliding one end into her shirt.I brought doughnuts and She held up her hand as Tate opened her mouth.Your father can have one measly doughnut hole.I want more than a doughnut hole, he grumbled.You just eat your toast, Tate shot at him.Van pulled out the doughnuts and plopped one on Tates fathers plate.Then she licked her fingers and dug out a chocolate glazed.Tate bit into a Boston creme.Van chewed and swallowed.So, wanna talk about how Cams back?Tate began to choke on her bite of doughnut, and Van slapped her back until Tate held up a hand.Cams back?her father said, his mouth hanging open in wonder.Because back in the day, he and Cam each had this mutual hero worship thing going on.At the time it warmed her heart.And now it soured her stomach.You couldnt lead in with a How are ya?or a Good morning?Tate asked.You had to ruin our lovely and pleasant doughnut breakfast by hopping right into the big questions?Van popped the last bite of her doughnut in her mouth.Im still having a lovely and pleasant time.She turned to Tates dad.Arent you, Ted?He nodded vigorously.Quite pleasant.Never been pleasanter.Tate glared at both of them.I dont like when you two team up.Van wobbled her head and made a face.Whatever.So, Cam?I have a bone to pick with you about that anyway.Tate pointed at her friend.How could you not tell me hes back and working with Trevor?Van wrinkled her nose.Trev never told me.Hes not going to be happy with the words I plan to say to his fact omitting ass.Tate snorted, and then picked at the icing on her doughnut.There were things she wanted to say, but not in front of her dad.Actually, she wasnt sure she wanted to say them out loud ...Her father cleared his throat and rose from the table.Well, Ill leave you two to do your girl talk  Dad, you dont have to do that.Tate grabbed his plates and placed them in the sink.You can stay to chat  He held up his hand with a chuckle.I can see this is a time where your old man isnt wanted.All I want to say is that Id love to say hi to Cam sometime.Maybe bring him around?Oh jeez.Oh shit.Thats exactly what she wanted to avoid.But instead, she bit her lip and nodded.Her father gave her a smile and then walked out of the kitchen.Tate collapsed into a kitchen chair and propped her chin in her hand.Van settled down beside her with another doughnut.So Cam helped you with Jamie or something?Tate gave her a brief rundown of last nights events, including Cams insistence on helping her.Well thats good, right?Vans face brightened.That he wants to help?You could sure use it.Tate sighed and raised her hand, fingered a dent in the wooden tabletop.But thats the problem, Van.I could use it.And then what happens when he leaves again?She lowered her voice.And he doesnt know about Dad.Van cocked her head.Then tell him.Hed want to know.Especially now that your dad took chemo so well.Tate pursed her lips.Cam back in town and inserting himself in her life was complicated.It dredged up all the old memories and mistakes and decisions.Shed finally come to terms with her life and her responsibilities.And the fact that none of her new life involved Cam.But now he was back, making her want things.Making her wish shed done things differently.And it hurt.It hurt places she swore shed caulked until they were sealed airtight.But Cam always had a way of worming himself inside.A door slammed open and Jamie stomped down the hall.Tate rose.Jamie, we need  Gotta go.He didnt even look at her as he made his way to the front door, keys jingling in his hand.Excuse me?Tate didnt have to force the attitude in her tone.It was there as she cocked out a hip and placed a hand on it.Sorry.Got an appointment.And then he was out the door.Tate contemplated running after him and slashing his tires or something drastic.Instead, she stamped her foot and growled in frustration.Then she sat down on her chair and stuffed a doughnut hole in her mouth.What the hell is his problem?I dont know, Tate said through a mouthful of sweet carbs.She brushed glaze crumbs off the table.But we still need to talk about what happened last night.Hes obviously avoiding that conversation.Hell, I dont want to have it, but it needs to be done.You going to tell your dad?Tate shrugged.Yeah, but after I talk to Jamie and get things settled.I dont want my dad to have to deal with this stress.Im sorry.Van placed a hand on Tates forearm.She sighed.Yeah, me too.Story of my life.Operation Catch Jamie, Avoid Cam, Help Dad was in effect.Easy peasy.7      CAM STARED AT the TV in his room.He hadnt touched it since hed been home.Theyd canceled cable long ago to save money, since his mothers only source of income right now was disability.And his TV only made him think of video games.And Utope.And Tate.He closed his eyes and sighed.The pain of what shed done had been so fresh yesterday when he first saw her.But now that hed seen she had a lot going on in her life, his feelings had shifted.Hed always want to be there for her.Hed always want to help.Before he could think too much about what he was doing, he sat up and grabbed the case for Utope and slipped the disc into the game system.He gripped the Catharsis controller and lay on his bed on his stomach, propped on his elbows and started the game.His fingers hovered over the START button and he pressed it, then pulled up the Ruiz saved game, typing in the password.And there they were.Avatar Cam and Avatar Tate, together on the porch swing.They were just pixels of CMYK, but Cam could still close his eyes and feel the weight of Tates head on his shoulder, the smell of her hair, the feel of her skin.A notification popped up in the lower right hand corner, letting him know thered been activity on this game since he last checked in.Had Tate ...?No, she probably took this game and smashed it or something.But no one else knew the password ...He clicked on it and the past scene replayed.Tate raised her head and looked at his avatar in the game, and a little speech bubble appeared over her head.Thank you.Cams whole body jolted and he nearly fell off the bed.He scrambled to his feet and then slid to his knees in front of the TV.He replayed the scene again.Thank you.And again.Thank you.And that was it.Thats all shed done.But shed done it.He frantically pulled up the menu to see when shed played it last.The time stamp showed that itd been done about three hours earlier.Only three hours ago.Shed been awake, and shed played the game just to tell Cam thank you.And before that, she hadnt played this game since the day before he left for basic.Hed run miles with a fifty pound ruck on his back, and hed entered battle simulations and hed shot a gun at targets but he wasnt sure his heart had ever beat this fast.If his hands had ever been this clammy.He dropped the controller and placed his palms on his thighs, breathing deeply, feeling the ache in his chest, the pull toward Tate.Sometime in the last twelve hours, shed hooked her chain to his heart again.And she was reeling it in.He couldnt deny it.And he didnt know what to do about it.When he got his heartbeat and breathing under control, he picked up the controller, clicked Z for action and B for speech.His character kissed Tate softly on the forehead and said, Always.CAM GLANCED AT the clock as he drank his coffee and figured it was about time to check on his mom.She was usually awake by now.Part of him wanted to put it off and just wait for her to come out on her own, all chipper and moving freely with no pain.But that was wishful thinking.He sighed and walked down the hall, touching her door with the tips of his fingertips so it slowly swung open.His mom lay on her side, staring at the door.When she smiled at him, it was strained.Mom?Cam said, walking in and taking care to sit on the bed gently so he didnt rock her.She blinked a couple of times and licked her lips.No laundry today, Camilo.Cam exhaled roughly and fisted the sheet so he didnt punch a wall.That was their code phrase for a bad pain day.Fibromyalgia was a tricky bitch.And anything that involved his mom moving her arms a lot, especially over her head, caused extreme neck and shoulder pain.He glanced at a basket of folded laundry in the corner and pursed his lips.I told you Id do that.You were working.Damn it, Ma!Cams voice rose and when she flinched at his tone, he took a deep breath to calm himself before he spoke again.Thats why Im here.To do things for you, like fold laundry so we dont have days like this.She walked her fingers forward until she covered his hand with her own.She squeezed gently until he relaxed his fist.Then he turned his palm upward and twined his fingers with hers.Ive been dealing with this for years.I can handle it.Its just going to be a bad day.But I want to help  Youre not going to be here forever.And I dont want you to be.You need to live your own life.He clenched his jaw.Right now, my life is here with you.When she smiled, it was sad.Wasnt she happy that he was home to take care of her?He was sacrificing a lot to be here, so he at least wanted her to appreciate the help.He pushed that thought aside.Do you need anything?I dont have to work until later.I think we need some groceries.You mind running to the store?Good, a job.A task that she needed completed.He could do this.He nodded eagerly.Of course.Do you have a list?On the notepad on the fridge.He leaned down and kissed her forehead.Want me to get you something to eat?She shook her head.Ill get it myself.Just going to lie here for a bit.He frowned.You sure?Im sure.He stood up and fixed the covers over her shoulders.She huffed at him and rolled her eyes but he ignored her.Call me if you need anything, okay?He made sure her phone was within easy reach.Just go already.Okay, I am!He was wearing only a pair of camo shorts, so he went into his room and slipped on a shirt and an old pair of sneakers.As he walked out the front door, he called out, Be back soon!And waited for an answer.When he heard, Drive safe!he smiled and walked outside.At ten in the morning, the June sun was out in full force.The air in his truck was thick and hot and he turned up the air conditioning full force, letting the vents blast the air in his face as it cooled.He reached for his sunglasses in the center console and accidentally knocked them on the floor of the passenger side.When he reached for them, he spotted the keychain first, a plastic My Little Pony charm hed given Tate for her seventeenth birthday.He picked up the set of keys, running his finger over the face of the pony.Pinkie Pie.Tates favorite.Their Utope password.She loved the toys when she was a kid and still watched the cartoon.Her keys must have fallen out of her purse last night.Jamie and gone into the house first, so Tate might not have realized she didnt have them.Shit, he muttered.Hed have to take them to her.He glanced at the time, figuring she worked a later shift today if she went out last night.But even if she wasnt home, hopefully he could catch her dad or brother.So when he backed out of the driveway, he headed away from the grocery store, and toward Tates house.He pulled into the driveway behind Tates Jeep, but he didnt see Jamies car anywhere, which kind of pissed Cam off.He wanted to have words with the kid where he wasnt drunk and angry.Hed have to talk to Tate about maybe taking the kid out for lunch or dinner.A neutral place where Cam could figure out where the hell all his anger was coming from.He knocked on the door and waited, shifting his weight from foot to foot and jingling Tates keys.When no one came to the door, he tried again.Finally he heard footsteps and then the door swung open.Van, why bother knocking now  Tates voice cut off and her eyes went wide when she spotted Cam on the doorstep.And he stared.Because she was wearing teeny tiny shorts that showed off her long, tan legs and a tight tank top that clearly let him know she wasnt wearing a bra.He didnt mean to stare at her chest, but holy hell.She might have lost weight other places but not there.Damn.Cam?His gaze shot up to her face.And he cleared his throat in an effort to hide his blush.He held up her keys.Uh, you left Pinkie Pie and her friends in my car, so ...He waggled them and shot her a grin.She blinked at the keys, then at his face, then smiled slightly and reached for her keys.Oh wow, I cant believe I didnt notice.It was pretty hot in my truck, so might want to give Pinkie Pie some water, make sure she isnt dehydrated.Tate chuckled softly; her head dipped as she fingered the keychain.Okay, Ill do that.A shuffling sound came from inside the house, and Cam craned his neck to see inside.Hey, is your dad here?Tate straightened and closed the door so he could barely see inside at all.Um, hes busy doing ...stuff ...so, I appreciate you bring my keys over  Cam?came a deep voice from inside.Tate whirled her head around, so her loose ponytail on top of her head flopped.Dad, I think he needs to go  I can stay for a little and say hi to your dad  But  Baby, open up the door!There were some whispered words, and then the door opened wider.Tate stood off to the side, fidgeting uncomfortably as Teds figure filled the door frame.And it took all of Cams self control not to gasp.Because this was not the large, muscled man he remembered.The man who worked at a factory building high end motorcycles.His hair was mostly gone.He had no mustache or five oclock shadow.He probably weighed half what he did the last time Cam had seen him.But he still had that smile and those bright hazel eyes Tate had inherited.Cam.He extended a thin, wrinkled hand.Good to see you, son.Cam shook his hand, feeling a slight tremor in the body of the other man.Come on in, Ted said, waving him in.Cam followed him inside, shooting Tate a what the fuck look behind his back.She at least had the decency to look ashamed.Ted took a seat on a recliner and Cams eyes fell on an oxygen tank beside him.Van brought some doughnuts this morning.Baby, why dont you get me another doughnut hole?And offer one of those apple fritters to Cam.He always liked those.Okay, Dad.Tate arranged a blanket around his frail legs and then without a look at Cam, turned and walked into the kitchen.Cam took a deep breath and followed her.In the kitchen, she set out plates and began placing doughnuts on them.Her hands were shaking and she was biting her lip.Tate  Do you still like apple fritters?Tate!I dont know why Van even gets them.Youre the only person I know who ever ate them.Tate, for fucks sake, whats going on?Tate stared at the doughnut on the plate in front of her, breathing deeply.And Cam waited.Ted had always treated him like another son.Hed been so accepting of his daughter dating one of the few minorities in this town.And to see him looking ...so weak ...made Cam sick to his stomach.He certainly didnt want a fucking doughnut.Apple fritter or not.He has lung cancer.Tates voice was soft.She picked off a flake of glaze from one of the doughnuts and stuck it in her mouth.Diagnosed a couple of years ago.He just had his second round of chemo.Theyll test soon to see if it worked.He glanced at her trembling fingers, remembering how she used to smoke.Is that why you quit?She nodded, picking more glaze off the doughnut.Im so sorry.Tate looked up at him.Thank you.Cam rested a hand on the counter and leaned closer.I feel like when I was gone, no one told me anything about what was going on back here.How come no one told me about his cancer?Cam shrugged jerkily.I think you made it clear that anything about me was no longer your concern.He threw up a hand.Seriously?Your dad has cancer and because we broke up, you think I didnt care about him anymore?What kind of robot do you think I am?Tate placed one foot on top of the other and scratched her cheek.I dont think youre a robot.I just ...Everything happened so fast.He got diagnosed and then it was this whirlwind.We were caught up in the tornado of cancer treatments, and I dont think weve touched the ground yet.Sometimes I wonder if were just in the eye of the storm right now.Where its calm before all hell breaks loose.Did you think about what I said?Ill help, Tate.They could be friends, couldnt they?And her family meant something to him.Tate pursed her lips.Then picked up a doughnut and took a big bite.Once she chewed and swallowed, she gave him a small smile.Ill think about it.She was being evasive.She was brushing him off.But he wasnt giving up, especially not now that he knew what shed been dealing with since hed been gone.Cam broke off a piece of fritter.Because even though his stomach hurt, it smelled good and Tates smile was easing that sick feeling in his gut.I can drive him to appointments or anything.Whatever.I said Id think about it.Tates voice was edged with irritation.Hey, wheres my treat!Ted called in from the living room.Tate laughed, the first real laugh hed heard from her since hed been home.Were coming, keep your pants on!Cam spent the next hour eating doughnuts and drinking coffee with Tate and her dad.They caught him up on the new businesses in town, and he told them stories about Alec and Max.Tate took an interest in Kat, Alecs girlfriend, and said shed love to meet her.When he left the house, he called his mom.She answered the phone.Did you get lost at the grocery store?Cam laughed.No, I had to stop at Tates house.He turned on his truck and sat back in his seat.So, how come you never told me about Tates dad?His mom was quiet for a moment.Its complicated.How is it complicated?You call me and say, Hey, Camilo, Tates dad has cancer.You had to have known.This whole town is one dysfunctional family.She sighed.I know, and Im sorry.I know you dont necessarily like Tate  I dont dislike her, his mom grumbled.Cam signed and ran a hand over the steering wheel.Makes me feel weird, being gone and missing everything.You were off living your life.Getting a degree.Thats better than most people in this town.He bit his lip, because it wasnt like he deserved it more than anyone else here.Okay, well, Im heading to the grocery store now.You okay?Im fine.Go and make sure the ice cream doesnt melt.Cam laughed.Okay, Ma.8      TATE GLANCED UP at the sound of the bell over the door of the diner and watched as Cam sauntered inside.He glanced around at the half full tables and then swung his gaze to where she stood behind the counter.A small smile touched his lips, and then he made his way toward her.He slid into a chair opposite her at the counter and jerked his chin to the ice cream machine.Behaving itself today?Tate rubbed the small scar on her hand.I guess so.Temperamental bitch.Cam laughed.Well, I wont make you do battle with it today.Burger and a Coke?Tate nodded and wrote it down on a slip of paper, then slapped it on the counter behind her for the kitchen.Order!Itd been this way for about a week.This tentative truce.Cam showed up at her work, dropped off take out dinners at her house, anything he could do to help.Even though she hadnt asked for a thing.But he was pushing his way into her life again without her knowing when it had started.She knew she should put a stop to it.Tell him to back off and deal with his mother and his own life.But she hadnt.And she didnt intend to.Maybe she was a masochist because she knew how this would end when he left.But the instant gratification of having him now won out.Anne walked out from the back room, smoothing down her apron.Hey there, Cam.Looking good, Anne.You just had a birthday, right?Twenty five?Anne psshed.That charm and those dimples, boy.Gonna get you in trouble one day.Already has.Cam winked and took a sip of the soda Tate slid in front of him.Trouble, Anne muttered, but her smile let Tate know she enjoyed the teasing.Tate grabbed the bin of silverware and began rolling them in napkins before the lunch rush.You talk to Jamie yet?Tate dropped a knife and it clattered on the counter.She picked it up and placed it in the napkin with its friends, the spoon and the fork.Hes avoiding me.Well, make him not avoid you.Its not that easy.I dont want to get Dad involved right now, so unless I go make a scene at his job, its hard.She dropped a silverware package in another bin and eyed Cam.Oh, and hes got a girlfriend.Cam raised his eyebrows and took another sip of his soda, crunching an ice cube.Yeah?That good or bad?I dont know.I havent met her yet but hes spending the night there.So thats a whole other issue I have to deal with.She leaned closer and spoke lower.I need to make sure hes being smart and using protection.Cam pointed at her.Okay, Ill make you a deal.Ill talk to Jamie about the drinking and the screwing.But you have to tell your dad, too.If I know Ted, hed be hurt about being kept in the dark.Tates hackles rose.You think I dont know my dad?Im trying to make the right decision  Tate.Cams voice was firm.Im not judging you.Im trying to help, okay?She deflated a little.Okay.And hopefully Jamie will listen to me.He did when he was thirteen.Tate looked up at him through her lashes as she continued to roll silverware.Yeah, well, thirteen seems like a lifetime ago.Well figure it out, okay?Tate nodded, a pricking starting behind her eyes.All this we talk was hard to hear from Cams mouth.As much as she appreciated having him back in her life as a friend, it was hard to deny she was still in love with him.Shed repressed her libido for so long and one look at Cam in his tight T shirts, those full lips grinning, those earrings she wanted to nibble, was almost too much.The day he started dating someone else, she might have to drive to the ocean and fling herself into it.Of course she knew he dated girls in college.Shed seen the pictures on Facebook when she snooped.Which was rare because it put her in a depression for about a week.But hed never been around the same girl for long, thank God.She could deal with him doing his thing, playing the field.But him getting serious with someone?The jealousy screaming through her body was no joke.But hed be gone by fall.To a big city.Hed meet some amazing girl, probably a Latina hottie with a great ass, and theyd make cute little Latino babies.But at least she wouldnt have to see them walking down the streets of Paradise together.Hopefully.For now, though, shed take him how she could.And if that was friends, at least she had him in her life somehow.Theyd been friends first.In fifth grade, Cam had been small and scrawny.Hed been bullied for being different, for having a last name that stood out.Hed had his lunch stolen almost every day, until Tate sat beside him one afternoon and shared her peanut butter and marshmallow sandwich.Hed taken it with a quiet thank you, and they ate in silence.Every day after that, she shared her lunch with him, growing wiser and packing two sandwiches for him.Until the bullies stopped bothering him because Cam wasnt suffering from their theft.And then theyd played pick up games of soccer together.And then theyd studied together.Until they had their first kiss over top of a biology textbook in high school, and theyd been together ever since.So she could do this againbe friends with Cam.As long as there were no biology textbooks.She rolled the last of the silverware and plopped it in the bin.Margo called Cams order and Tate reached for the plate, then set it in front of Cam.It was crazy how she could predict his actions for the next thirty seconds, and she watched his hands.Take the bun off.Remove onions.Rearrange lettuce and tomato.Take top bun.Shake a dollop of ketchup on top in an expanding swirl.Plop bun back on burger.Smoosh.Pick up.Take a bite.She smiled to herself as he hummed and chewed at the same time.Is that all you plan to eat all summer?Burgers?Youre going to lose that physique the armed forces worked so hard on.Cam pointed a finger at her.Mind your own business.In fact, you could stand to eat a burger or two.She propped a hand on her hip.Excuse me?Cam looked a little chagrined as he pushed his fries around on his plate.Just saying you lost weight is all.He was right.Tate only knew because her clothes had been fitting a little bit different.Guess I need to eat more doughnuts.Cam smiled.She stacked the glasses under the counter, then unstacked them and then did it again.Needing something to do with her hands to avoid looking at him when she spoke next.To pretend it wasnt such a big deal.I ...uh ...actually I do have a favor to ask.He looked up expectantly.Yeah?His voice was tempered, she could tell, like he was worried if he showed too much excitement, shed retreat.She shoved the cups away and began folding clean rags.Next Wednesday, can you drive my dad to an appointment?He might only have to stay for a couple of hours, or they might keep him overnight for some tests.Jamie and I have to work.Normally, Id ask Anne or something but she has to work too ...Cam held up his hand.No problem.I dont work Wednesdays.She dipped her head.Yeah, I know.I had Van check Trevors schedule.You could have called me or texted me.My number hasnt changed.Unless you deleted it from your phone.Of course she hadnt.She lived in fear of drunk texting him, but couldnt bring herself to delete it.No, I didnt.He shook his head, his smile a little sad.Yeah, me either.LATER THAT NIGHT, Cam signed into Utope, thinking maybe he should feed their dog.Or check out their backyard rainforest.But instead, he saw that Tate had signed in earlier.He clicked to replay her actions.And there was her avatar, in the kitchen, wearing heels and a dress and an apron.She stood at the stove, and Cam cocked his head, like that would make him able to see better what she was doing.And then his avatar walked in and sat down at the kitchen table.Tate turned around and slid a plate in front of him.Cam squinted because it looked like ...I made you apple fritters, Tate said.Cam, the real one, laughed out loud, as his character in the game picked one up and said, Mmmm.Cam watched it one more time, and then he ordered his character to go shopping.He walked to the nearby mall and headed into a kids store.For one hundred and fifty virtual dollars, he bought a huge, stuffed Pinkie Pie pony.His character couldnt fit it in his carhe had a little sports carso he had to take a bus.And all the other passengers glared at him as he squeezed into his seat with the huge stuffed pony.Cam laughed the whole time.And then he arrived home, where Tates character was outside gardening.He presented her with the gift, and she jumped up and down clapping.Friends truce?Cam asked.Tate repeated.Friends truce.Then he gave her a kiss on the forehead and walked into the house to eat the rest of his apple fritters.9      THURSDAYS WERE THE busiest nights at Dekes.It was probably a mixture of the college Thirsty Thursday mentality and the weekly dollar twenty five draft sale.Either way, Cam was busy at the door checking IDs.He didnt know if it was something in the water or what, but hed already had to turn away a group of girls and two guys for all having fakes.The girls flirted and tried to get in anyway, but he wouldnt budge.The one guy tried to slip him money to let him in and the other guy ...well, the other guy tried to flirt with him, too.But Cam didnt negotiate with terrorists and turned them all away.Tate was somewhere in the crowd with Van.He hadnt talked to her since he had lunch at the diner two days ago.He knew shed seen the game, because she smiled shyly at him and rattled her Pinkie Pie keychain.Hed smiled back and then tried to keep his eyes off her cleavage.Then he wished it were winter so she had to wear turtlenecks.Trevor was busy at the bar and gave Cam a chin lift when he turned around to check on him.Cam swung his head back to the door, but on the way, his gaze met the familiar eyes of Marcus.The guy was over in the corner of the bar with a couple of his friends, near the pool tables.Theyd never been friends and Cam knew hed just been biding his time, waiting for Cam or Tate to screw up so he could swoop in and get with her.Bastard.Cam didnt want to know why Marcus was sniffing around Tate now.And if hed done more than sniff in the past.Cam focused on a group of girls coming inside.One of them was a girl he recognized.What was her name ...Maya?Naya?Mara?Shit.She smiled at him, her tongue between her teeth in a gesture he assumed to be flirty, and handed him her ID.Cam glanced at it as he ran it through the machine.Kara Masters.He snorted to himself.So he was kinda close.Hed gone to high school with her, although he thought shed been a year younger.One check of her birth date told him she was twenty two so his memory wasnt so bad.Cam Ruiz, right?
