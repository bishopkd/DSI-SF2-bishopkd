Brawley Odell figured his life wouldnt be worth one plug nickel the second he stepped foot inside Maggies shop.Too damn bad.He hadnt driven the thirty miles from Maverick Junction to back out now.He was goin in.After all this time, hed come homeand she was leaving.He grasped the brass knob and shoulder butted the oak door.It flew open, the bell overhead jangling.Maggie Sullivan, all that gorgeous red hair scooped into a jumbled mass, stood dead center in the room.Dressed in a skirt and top the color of a forest at twilight, she held a fuzzy sweater up in front of her like a shield.Those amazing green eyes widened as he stormed in.We need to talk.He ignored the woman at the back of the store who flipped through a rack of tops.What the?He held up a hand.Dont speak.Not yet.Her mouth opened, then closed.Anger boiled in him, but he needed to find some modicum of control.Taking a deep breath, he held it for the count of ten, then slowly released it.Did you plan on telling me?Her eyes narrowed, but she said nothing.Youre invited to New York City for a showing of your new line, and you dont share that with me?I have to learn about it secondhand?Last I heard this wasnt about you, Brawley.In fact, my life, my business has absolutely nothing to do with you.His jaw clenched.Anything that affects you is my business, Mags.She snorted.Get real, Odell.You gave up any and all rights years ago.Her head tilted.Why are you even interested?You want to attend so you can show off your latest Dallas Cowboy cheerleader?Maybe order her trousseau?He shot her a deadly look, one that had made grown men back away.Not Maggie.She actually took a couple steps toward him.The woman had no survival instincts.Another reason she had no business heading off to New York alone.She tapped a scarlet tipped finger on her chin.Oh, thats right.Thered be no trousseau for your honey, would there?Maybe a weekend fling outfit for your date du jour?A one night stand set of lacy lingerie.Shut up, Maggie.Make me.Her eyes flashed.This time the look in his eyes must have warned her shed treaded too close to the edge.She stepped back.You challenging me, Maggie?When she wet her lips, his gaze dropped to her mouth, followed the tip of her pink tongue as it darted out.Only one way I could ever get you quiet, he said.Her hand shot up.Dont even think about it.No thought required.Been wanting to do this a long time now.He closed the distance between them and dropped his mouth to hers.Fire.Smoke.Hell, a full out volcanic eruption.The dressing room door opened.Brawley dragged his lips from Maggies.Maggie, honey, this is fantastic!Id like Oh.Her customer stared at the two of them.At the friend who, now sitting on the love seat, waited for her while watching the show he and Maggie had put on.From the expression on her face and the quiet little sounds she made, Brawley assumed shed enjoyed it a whole hell of a lot.Maggie pushed him away as if burned.But if what hed just felt was mutualand from the glazed expression on her face, it had beenthe kiss had short circuited more than a few wires for her, too.Still, that famous temper flared.Stella, run and get the sheriff for me.Tell Pete an idiot has come into the shop and Im being assaulted.Brawley frowned, then turned his megawatt smile on the women.Two could play this game.A little lovers spat here, ladies.Sorry to make you a party to it.I should have waited till Maggie locked up for the day.He tipped his chin toward her.But, hey, isnt she lovely?Hard to stay away till closing time.A quiet growl erupted from Maggie.As much as I hate to interrupt your shopping spree in Maggies wonderful little shop, he continued, how bout you take a short break?Run on over to the Cowboy Grill and put your feet up.Tell Ollie that Brawley Odell sent you.Have a coffee or iced tea on me.Maybe a piece of his lemon meringue pie.My treat.Yall order whatever you like.Give us a few minutes.No!Dont go anywhere.Maggie rounded on Brawley.You cant come in here and chase my customers away.Instead of answering, Brawley walked to the front door and held it open.Hesitantly, throwing speculative glances at each other, the two women hung their items on the end of a rack and walked out the door, crossing the street to Ollies.The door had barely closed behind them when Maggie stamped her foot.If I had Grandpas shotgun right now, Brawley Odell, youd be picking lead out of your useless, no good hide.My lucky day, I guess.Ohhh!You think that attitude is going to do what?Make me apologize to you?I dont think so.If thats what youve come for, you might as well follow my customers right out of here.You hurt me, Mags.Though he kept his tone flippant, it was the honest to Gods truth.A truth he hadnt meant to voice out loud.But there it was.How could you make such an important decision, have something so monumental happen, and not tell me?Hmmm.Could it be because you shut me out of your life years ago?I didnt.Thats a matter of semantics.She shrugged.Why does it matter to you where I live?You dont live here, either, not in Lone Tree or Maverick Junction.Thats where youre wrong.I rented Dottie Williss apartment today.Now that Sophie and Ty are married, the place is empty again.In fact, my new landlady is the one who told me youre leaving.Youre moving back to Maverick Junction?She looked like a five year old whod just learned there is no Santa Claus.I dont remember you telling me about this.Im telling you now.I see.Her eyes narrowed.So its okay for you to make decisions and tell me about them afterward.I, on the other hand, have to report to you when Im considering a change?Get your approval?I never said that.Sure you did.When did you decide all this?Ive been kicking it around for a bit now.Youre taking over Doc Gibsons practice.He nodded.I knew youd been helping him out, but She spread her hands.Gramps doesnt know yet.About your line?Oh, he knows about that, but not The fact youre moving to New York.Yes.Dont you think it would be better if he found out from you?She wrung her hands.I cant find the right words.I dont want to hurt him.And I hate to leave him alone.Then dont.Oh, Brawley, Ive wanted this as long as I can remember.This is my dream.I thought this shop was.His gaze wandered over the space shed created from a dilapidated storefront that had seen better days.He knew for a fact shed been the one to paint that soft pink on the walls, the chocolate brown on the crown molding and chair rail shed installed.Shed hung the lace curtains at the windows, stenciled her name on the glass.In the middle of this butt ugly, one horse town, Maggie had created a veritable oasis.The place even smelled like her.Feminine.Sexy.Secretive.Made him think of nights spent in a womans arms.Of long ago nights in this fiery redheads arms.New Yorks a big city, he said.Really?She pulled an innocent face.I didnt know that.He refused to rise to the bait, so he said nothing.Dallas isnt?she asked.Isnt what?A big city.Try to stay focused, Brawley.Brows furrowed, he thumbed back his hat brim.What does that have to do with anything?She crossed to the jewelry counter and leaned against it.Seems to me you ran off to Dallas and left everything and everyone behind.This isnt about you and me, Maggie.No?No.Good to know.I thought maybe we were in the middle of a repeat performance from ten years ago.You know, the one where you decide my future for me.The one where I have no input whatsoever.I handled that night badly.Ill admit it.But everything I did, I did for the right reasons.According to you.Yes, according to me.A fleeting expression crossed her face.Not anger.Sorrow?But it was gone so quickly, he couldnt read it.So youre moving home, she said.Are you planning to bring a playmate along?One of your cheerleaders, maybe?Have you found one wholl put up with Maverick Junctions small town way of life?Ive come home to work.To live.And Im going to New York to workand live, she countered.Dont let the door hit that cute tush on the way out.She turned on those sexy as sin heels and walked into her back room, leaving him standing therealone.Maggie didnt intentionally swing those hips, didnt intentionally make a man drool whether she was coming or going.She simply had that effect on men.She was Maggie.It was part of her DNA.He took two steps to follow.Stopped.A wise man circled the wagons and regrouped before a second attack.He considered himself wise.Damned wise.The bell over the door tinkled as he left.He supposed Maggie would take it as the white flag of surrender.She could safely come out of hiding.As long as he was in Lone Tree, he might as well have a late breakfast.At the same time, he could give the ladies an all clear and send them back to Maggies.Hed provided the gossips with plenty of ammunition for one morning.He grinned.I have a cute tush?The busybodies were on their feet before Ollies door had closed behind him.Like vultures, they smelled fresh fodder.Brawley held the door for them.Doffing his hat as they passed, he said, Have a nice day, ladies.Oh, we will, one of them answered before hustling across the street.I see you survived.Ollie, wearing an egg stained apron, set a steaming mug of black coffee in front of Brawley when he straddled a stool at the counter.Depends on your definition of survival.I made it out alive.Didnt gain a thing.Trying to talk her out of leaving us?Brawley scowled.Did everybody but me know about this?Not her grandpa.Dont think shes told him yet.Made us all promise to keep it a secret.Some secret.Humph.Ollie rolled his linebacker shoulders and lifted his chin in the direction the women had taken.Ladies said you and Maggie were having yourselves a real knock out, drag down tussle.The womans got a temper.And you dont?Brawley ignored Ollies question and blew on his coffee.Taking a sip, he scalded his tongue and set the cup back on the counter.It matches all that fierce red hair.Hair he missed running his fingers through.Hair he missed having the right to touch.But then, hed chosen to give that up years ago.Did he really want to kick up all these feelings?Had they ever truly gone to sleep?For either of them?Ollie was watching him closely.And a mouth to match, he finally said.Oh, yeah.Brawley didnt even want to think about her mouth.Those full lips.The luscious taste of her.He readjusted himself on the stool, instantly uncomfortable in his snug jeans.How about you throw a big old steak on the grill along with a couple eggs?You got it.Home fries?The works.He might as well satisfy one appetite.Two  Maggie stepped out of the back room.Her shop, her lovely shop, was empty.Yet she still felt Brawleys presence.So masculine in this feminine space.So devastatingly handsome in his worn jeans and scuffed boots, that Stetson tipped low.And lest she forget itso dangerous.Brawley Odell had single handedly ended her navet, her belief in knights in shining armor and Prince Charmings.At least when it came to her love life.Now, by moving back to Maverick Junction, he threatened her dreams of a new life in the Big Apple.How many nights had she lain awake, praying for him to come home?To come back to her.But now?Fate was, indeed, a cruel mistress.Her eighteen year old self had been putty in his hands.One touch, one kiss, and reason left her.Shed been totally defenseless when it came to him.But she wasnt eighteen anymore.Once burned, twice learned.And, boy, had she learned.She had to hang tough.Could not give in.Walking to the stereo system, she hit play and smiled when Luke Bryans peppy new country song filled the room.Sauntering over to the love seat shed painstakingly reupholstered in a beautiful floral pattern, she flopped down.Brawley had a way of leaving her feeling as though shed just weathered a Texas tornado.When the door flew open and hed thundered in, her heart had stuttered.The man did that to her.Always had, and she was deathly afraid he always would.But that didnt mean she liked him.She didnt.Not anymore.They shared friends, and because of them she couldnt totally avoid him.But the less time spent near him, the better.Hed hurt her and would again if she let him get a boot in the door.She wouldnt.Nope, when it came to that cowboy, shed bolted and padlocked her heartand thrown away the key.At fourteen, shed decided to marry him someday.And at fifteen and sixteen and seventeen and eighteen she stood by that decision.Five years.Long enough for her dreams of Brawley Odell to seriously settle into her heart and take up permanent residence.Shed figured by now theyd have three or four mini thems tearing around their house.Yeah, shed pictured the goofy, lovable dog, the white picket fence.The whole shebang.Big dreams.Big heartbreak.Now she was honest enough to admit shed set herself up for it.But damn him, hed helped her.It had almost killed her when hed headed off to Texas A&M and left her behind in Maverick Junction to finish high school.But that first semester, hed burned up the road between college and home.Then one Thursday morning hed phoned to tell her to expect him the next evening; they needed to talk.Her mom and dad were in San Antonio on business and would be gone till Monday.She and Brawley would have the house to themselves.She played hooky Friday and fixed dinner for them, set out candles, and wore her best dress.Her nails shone from a fresh manicure.When he slipped her engagement ring on her finger, she wanted everything to be perfect.This would be the night he proposed.Theyd get married, and shed live in College Station with him while he finished school.What a fool.He hadnt proposed.The dinner sat uneaten; the candles burned to a nub.Brawley hadnt stayed more than ten minutes.He hadnt even gone inside with her.His mouth set in the familiar tight line that said hed made up his mind, hed ended her fantasies.There on the front porch, the sun riding low, he told her they needed to concentrate on their futures.He had eight years of school ahead of him, and he wanted her to go to the design school shed talked about, not wait in Maverick Junction for him.When he left, he kissed her on the forehead and wished her well.Remembering it now, Maggies anger rose to the surface.Nothing shed said could change his decision.They were finished, no longer a couple.Brawley Odell had spoken, and apparently his word was law.How had she missed this autocratic streak in him?The rest of that night and the next day were a blur.Her world had shattered.She couldnt sleep, couldnt eat.Sprawled on the sofa, she watched the sun set, then rise again.How could she face life without Brawley?She loved him.No.She hated him and would as long as she lived.If only And then, Cash Hardeman, friends with both her and Brawley for as long as she could remember, stopped by.Concerned, Brawley had asked him to check on her.Cash had cleared the table of last nights dinner, done the dishes, then held her while she cried.Absolutely certain life could get no worse, a month later shed faced the fact that it actually could.Maggie shook herself and moved across the shop to tidy a display of evening bags.She glanced across the street and wondered if her customers would be back or if they were grilling Ollie about her and Brawley.Shed been young and foolish because through everything, shed told herself Brawley would be back.That shed get a phone call from him telling her how much he missed her.That thered be a knock on the front door and hed be standing there, waiting to sweep her off her feet and make that dream of happily ever after come true.Eventually, though, shed admitted none of that would happen.Reflecting on her relationship with Brawley, she realized thered never been any promises spoken.Theyd all been in her mind.In her heart.So shed kicked the lout out of her heart.Had cleaned house and trashed those dreams.Shed moved on, made new plans, and started her own business.A business that now, thanks in large part to Annelise, Cashs wife, had grown beyond her wildest expectations.Smiling, Maggie settled into one of the upholstered chairs.Annelise Montjoy Hardeman, wealthy as the legendary King Midas, had worn one of her designs to a fund raiser and then even more spectacular, Annelise had chosen Maggie to design a wedding gown for her big day, a day covered worldwide by every newspaper, magazine, and TV station.One thing led to another and now, in one short month, shed show her fall line at a huge, honest to God New York City fashion show.Theyd opted for an off season showing rather than wait another half year for September Fashion Week.She pinched herself, still unable to believe it was all true.The door opened and she started, sitting bolt upright.Stella and her friend.Maggie sighed.Her customers were back, their eyes burning with unanswered questions and the excitement of having been part of the little drama here in her shop.Well, she thought, pushing up her sleeves, she didnt intend to feed the mill.Retrieving the dress Stella had hung on the rack before she left, Maggie asked, Howd this fit?And it was back to business as usual.Maggie stopped by Ollies at the end of the day to pick up a sweet tea for the ride home.While she waited at the counter, she called her grandfather to see if he wanted anything.She didnt regret for a minute having left Maverick Junction to move in with her widowed grandpa in Lone Tree.It had been good for both of them.But she missed her folks, missed seeing them every day.She missed her friends.Still, this had been the right thing to doand in under an hour she could be back with everybody.Hey, Pops, she said when he answered.Whats up?You comin home soon?Im on my way.Before I leave town, I thought Id check to see if you need anything.Nope.Just you.Your mom called.Were meeting her and your dad at Bubbas Roadhouse for dinner.Tonight?Yep.Why didnt she call me?Guess youd need to ask her that.Maggie sighed.After the morning shed had, she wanted nothing more than to go home, climb into her pajamas, and veg out.Not gonna happen.If we plan to make it on time, her grandfather continued, youd better get a move on.Are you ready?Yep.All right.Ill need two minutes to change, then we can hit the road.She hung up, and Ollie handed her the go cup of tea.Thanks, Ollie.Gotta run.When Ollie didnt remove his hand, she met his eyes.You need to tell him.Maggies stomach fell.I know.Lots of people are in on the fact youre heading off to New York.Its not a secret anymore.Only a matter of time till somebody lets the horse out of the chute.If your grandpa finds out from one of them, itll go down a whole lot harder.She nodded.Its tough, though, you know?Hell be alone again.Ollies dark eyes twinkled.You might be surprised.Whats that supposed to mean?He swiped at the counter with a white bar cloth.Just sayin.Do you know something I dont?He laughed.At my age, Id better.Seriously, though, you need to tell him.The sooner, the better.I will.Hands on his hips, Stetson pushed back on his head, Brawley stood in the middle of his new home and took in the Tiffany blue walls, the girlie lights, the frou frou.It had to go.All of it.It might have worked for Annie, then Sophie, but it sure as hell didnt work for him.One more night here and hed have to have his testosterone levels checked cause they were bound to cry uncle and start jumping ship surrounded by all this female nonsense.Hed slap something neutral on the walls.Bring in his leather sofa, a few pieces of his Native American pottery, a couple of the paintings hed bought at the arts and craft fairs, and it would do.He peeked into the bathroom and checked out the huge claw foot tub.It might be fun to play inand damned if Maggies face and curvaceous body didnt jump into his brainbut he needed a shower.He worked too hard to be satisfied with baths.The plumbing in Dotties hundred year old house was bound to be a nightmare, though.Not something he wanted to get into, especially since the small, second story apartment was a temporary landing pad.Maybe he could do something about a shower over at the clinic.His stuff was in storage, ready to head to Maverick Junction as soon as he gave the word.Hed spent last week packing up and meeting with the movers.Damned if he knew whether or not hed made the right decision, but it felt good, coming home after over a decade away.Doc Gibson, the only vet within a fifty mile radius, had finally called it quits, and Brawley had decided to take over his practice.Hed be glad to be back doing the work hed trained for.In Dallas hed worked with pampered pets and their even more pampered owners, never really sure he was making much of a difference.Here hed be working with ranchers and their livestock, working with the pets of people he knew and cared about.And there was the rub.The double edged sword.Hed know everybody who came in to see him.Theyd know him.Gone was the anonymity hed enjoyed.The freedom to come and go as he pleased.To do whatever the hell he wanted.Despite the fact hed turned thirty on his last birthday, hed be back to answering to his parents.Back to the obligatory Sunday dinners with his family.Back to being able to pick up the phone and get in touch with his best buds over a beer.He smiled.And thats exactly what he intended to do.Right now.Pulling his phone from his hip pocket, he hit Cashs number before he remembered his pal, now married, might not be free to come out and play.Ty had tied the knot, too, a month ago.Theyd married cousins.Go figure.Annie answered.Hey, Brawley.Hows my second favorite cowboy?Better now that Im talking to you, beautiful.Is Cash around?Hell be with you in a second.Ive got him on a ladder in the closet arranging some purses for me.Brawley winced.You think I can borrow him after he finishes?Id like to meet him at the clinic.Get his take on a couple changes Im considering.Absolutely, she said.In fact, hes due for a little R and R time.Maybe when youre done, the two of you can stop at Bubbas and catch up.Annie, darlin, youre as close to perfect as God ever made.Sure you dont want to swap out guys?Her laughter came quick and easy.I love you, Brawley, but I think Ill stay with what Ive got.Hey, you makin time with my girl?Cash, Brawleys friend since first grade, came on the line.Figured she might have come to her senses by now, Brawley said.Never hurts to try.Oh, I dont know about that.Ive been known to deck men for a lot less.Brawley laughed.Yeah, you have.Most of the time, though, Ive had to step in and save your sorry ass.In your dreams.So, whats up?The two met outside the veterinary clinic that had been Doc Gibsons for the last forty or fifty years.After unlocking the door, Brawley hit the light switch.Barking dogs and howling cats greeted them.He moved into the side room and visited each one of the overnighters.Then he waved Cash back to where Doc had his office.Id like to gut this whole area.Make a new, up to date office space, add some built in bookcases, and bring the electrical wiring into this century.He opened the door that led into a small, private, and very antiquated bath.Theres a storage closet next to this.Dont need it.Figure if we knock down the wall between, I might be able to add a shower.Id like to be able to clean up here at the end of the day rather than go home to a bath.You dont like the old claw foot in Dotties apartment?I dofor lounging.Not for washing away a days worth of work, though.Annie and I had some good times in that Brawley stuck his fingers in his ears.Too much information, pal.Cash chuckled.Shame you dont have somebody to share it with.You might change your mind.Youre such a newlywed.I am that, and Im enjoying it immensely.Bragging SOB.Not bragging.Simply telling it like it is.Before Brawley could respond, Cash said, I think all this is very manageable.Lets run to Bubbas and draw up some plans over a beer.Maybe have Ty meet us there.Since he and I both did most of the work on our houses, we should be able to handle the renovations ourselves.Most of them anyway.Cash slung an arm around Brawleys shoulder.Good to have you back.Tell Maggie that.Different rodeo, buddy.You know shes leaving.Yep.Shit.Everybody but me.He pulled out his cell and called Ty, who took a pass.His triplets were in a play at their preschool.On the drive to Bubbas, Brawley and Cash tossed around the chances of the Rangers having a good season, the reasons the Cowboys hadnt had one, Cashs ranch, and Brawleys new business.Just like old times.A night out with his best pal.Finally, he was in the drivers seat, figuratively and literally.Nothing could upset him tonight.Three  Hurt Brawley Odell?What a bunch of bull.How did you hurt a man who had no heart?For the briefest instant, Maggies conscience threatened.None too gently, she nudged it away.Still, her traitorous mind flashed back to that awful night before last Christmas.It had been Brawley whod decided to stop at Sophies with a tag for her cat, whod walked in on her and the creep from Chicago whod broken into her apartment.While Ty soothed Sophie, Brawley had nailed plywood over her broken window and swept up the glass.Sophie had said that beneath his golden tan, Brawley had been nearly as pale and white lipped as she had.Still, hed done what needed doing.Shed watched him care for Doc Gibsons four legged patients, his compassion almost heartbreaking at times.He talked quietly to them, soothed them and their worried owners.So, obviously, somewhere in that tanned, muscled chest there actually was a warm, beating heart.Too bad it turned to stone whenever she was involved.It hadnt always.Images of them wrapped in each others arms in the back seat of his dads Chevy, lying together in a field of bluebonnets under the hot Texas sun, playing down at the swimming hole.Theyd been inseparable.Maybe theyd been too intense.Like anything else that hot, the relationship had burned itself out.For him, anyway.Mentally rearranging tonights plans, adjusting from dreams of a quiet evening reading to a boisterous night at Bubbas with the whole family, she pulled into the drive of her grandfathers house and stopped at the mailbox.The usual.A telephone bill, two catalogsone selling seeds and the other novelty items, a grocery flier advertising the weeks must have deals, and a hearing aid advertisement.Entering the house, Maggie kicked off her heels and dropped both her purse and the mail on an oak stand in the foyer.She carried the remnants of her iced tea into the living room.Her grandfather lounged in his recliner, remote in hand, flicking through the channels.He popped an almond into his mouth from the little bowl at his elbow.Maggies heart twisted.She hated the thought of leaving him here alone while she flew off in search of her future.She had to tell him.Tonight.Before someone else did.Her stomach tightened in anticipation.Hed be lonely, but hed be furious if she gave up her big chance to stay here with him.Damned if you do, damned if you dont.She forced a smile.Fletcher Sullivan, you are one handsome cowboy.Im going to have to beat off all the women tonight once they catch sight of you.Not bad for an old geezer, huh?Voice gruff, dressed in his best western shirt and a new pair of jeans shed laundered last night to get rid of the initial stiffness, he grinned.Hed combed his silver white hair neatly from a side part.Goin out with my favorite girl.Got to look good.Dont want to put you to shame.Thatll never happen, Pops.Im the luckiest granddaughter on earth.He pushed himself out of the leather chair, crossed the room, and gave her a hug and a kiss.We need to talk, honey.Oh, God, he knew.Her mouth went as dry as week old cornbread.Pops He shushed her.First, though, I understand Brawley came by the shop today.Gave you a bad time.Want me to talk to the boy?She smiled, relieved at the reprieve.No.I can handle him.Sure she could.The way a rabbit would handle a rattler and probably with the same results.You sure?She nodded.He didnt look convinced, but he let it drop.We still have to talk, sugar, but it can wait till were on our way.Your mother called again to make sure wed be there.Told her to keep her pants on, that wed be there when we got there and not a minute sooner.Ill bet she loved that.Give me five.She flew upstairs to her room, filled with dread.Since it wasnt Brawleys visit, he either already knew about her moveor something was wrong with him.Oh, boy.Silly to let her mind leap to that.Pops was healthy as an ox and busier than hed been in ages.She had a hard time catching him home anymore.It seemed he had plans with the guys almost every night, out doing whatever guys his age did.And that was a good thing.Friends.The staple of life.Once in her room, she closed the door, leaned against it, and let out a huge sigh.Felt the day slip away.She loved this room.The rest of the house remained locked in a time warp.Nothing had changed in the old two story since forever.After Grandma passed away and Maggie moved in, shed understood his need to keep his wife of nearly fifty years close.Because of that, shed resisted any and all urges to redecorate.She had, though, totally redone one of the guest rooms and made it her own.The Baxters, Grandpas closest neighbors, had decided to modernize their farmhouse living room.That included tearing out a beautiful old fireplace surround.When Maggie heard they intended to toss it, shed snapped it up, painted it a soft ivory, and turned it into her headboard.Both her bedroom walls and a salvaged chandelier were now the color of good champagne.Shed mixed in splashes of midnight blue.She squinted at a throw pillow.The exact color of Brawleys eyes.Oh, God.Why hadnt she realized that before now?It was so not the reason shed chosen the shade, though.Shed picked it because she liked it.Because it soothed her.Normally.Well, enough lollygagging.Time was wasting.She unzipped her slacks and stepped out of them, slid the soft sweater over her head.Standing in her closet doorway, she sighed.Smiled.Her private closet looked darned near as pretty as her store.Clothes were the love of her life.And those clothes, the designs shed created, had lavished her imagination on, would take her away from her grandpa.Oh, hed be stoic about it, tell her she had to follow her heart, but stillMaybe he should close up this big old house and move in with her parents.That wasnt going to happen, and she knew it.He and Gran had moved in here as newlyweds, had brought their baby, her dad, home from the hospital to this house.Had raised him here.No.Fletcher Sullivan wouldnt leave this house.But anticipating telling him about her plans was definitely taking some of the shine off her dream.And now there was Brawley.She pulled out her best pair of cowgirl boots.If she was going to Bubbas with Pops, boots were almost a requirement.A pair of jeans and a floaty top in shades of green finished her off.She took three minutes to refresh her makeup, then unclipped and shook out her hair.Bounding down the stairs, she saw Pops in the foyer, hat on.Obviously he was in a hurry to get the show on the road.He opened the door, and she stepped out into the early spring evening.The temperature had plunged, and she hesitated, wondering if she should run back upstairs for a sweater.Nah.Bubbas would be warm, and she could run the heater on the way home.Neither of them spoke as she backed the car down the drive and headed toward Maverick Junction.The moon was nearly full, the sky clear, the stars amazing.Maggie considered turning on the radio but realized that would be cowardly.Before she could find the right words, Pops cleared his throat.He didnt look at her, stared straight ahead.Maggie, honey, its time we had a talk.One Ive put off too long.Shouldnt have.A groan welled up in her, but she batted it down.Shed waited too long.Someone else had told him.Its as much my fault as yours, Pops.She took one hand from the wheel and gave his a squeeze.Your fault?His head snapped around to study her.Why in the world would you say that?She frowned.I No, he said.Just listen.Time I took this old bull by the horns and had my say.Okay.Jeez, the way her stomach was flipping around, shed never be able to eat a bite if they didnt get this hashed out before they reached Bubbas.Youre a good girl, Maggie, and Im proud of you.I understand people look at you and see what you want them to see.You like some bling, like your fun.But you also like the status quo.Despite all the glitz and glamour, at heart, you like nothing better than a rainy Sunday spent in an old pair of pajamas, reading.True, but I loved your grandma with all my heart.Always will.What the heck?Maggie shot him a glance.What did Grandma have to do with her move?This definitely wasnt the direction shed expected their conversation to take.I know that, Pops.But what does any of this have to do with New York?New York?He reared back.Who said anything about New York?She inhaled sharply.Im confused.Course you are.You keep interrupting me instead of listening.And shed been chastised.Sure not the first time.Better to say nothing, simply wait for him to finish.Okay, then.As if in a rush to get the words out, he blurted, Dottie and I are getting married.What?The car swerved into the other lane.She whipped it back.Her eyes fastened on her grandfather briefly.His gaze focused on the passing scenery, he braced his feet on the floor, grabbed the hand rest, and pressed his back into the seat.Pops, she snapped.Look at me.Say that again.Youd best watch where youre going before the sheriffs got to send the ambulance out for us.She turned her attention back to the two lane highway that stretched ahead for miles and miles.I asked Dottie Willis to marry me.She said yes.He swallowed hard.Dottie?Thats what I said, didnt I?Dottie Willis?Yes, maam.Nothin wrong with your hearing.Her eyes flicked from the road to him, back to the road.She tried to speak, but no words came.Her grandfather and Dottie Willis?And shed been clueless.I know this probably comes as a surprise to you A surprise?she croaked.Weve been seeing each other on and off since Cashs Fourth of July barbecue.Thats almost a year.Yep.All those dinners and nights out with the guys?She took a sip of her now warm tea.He had the good grace to look shamefaced.Some of them actually were guys nights out, but I spent a lot of them with Dottie.We took it slow.He gave a nervous little laugh.Although at our age thats probably kind of risky.He shrugged.I love her, Maggie.The woman makes me feel like a man again instead of some old, worthless, worn out bag of bones.She rubbed her forehead, not wanting to dig too deeply into what exactly that might entail.This doesnt change anything, sweetie.Dottie and I havent decided if were going to keep her house or mine, but wed love to have you live with us.She laughed.With a couple of lovesick newlyweds?Her grandfather scowled.Its wont be like that.Were too old to be carrying on.He actually blushed and gave her a sidelong look, his lips curving into a slow smile.Much.Maggie was glad shed swallowed her last drink of tea.Otherwise, sure as the sun rose in the morning, shed have spurted it across the dashboard.Hot on the heels of that thought came the realization that her grandfather wouldnt be alone when she left for New York.A heavy weight lifted from her shoulders, and a huge grin broke free.First, Pops, let me say congratulations.As soon as I get parked at the roadhouse, Ill give you a big old hug and a kiss.Then, Im ordering a bottle of Bubbas finest champagneif he carries anyand which will probably be one step away from rubbing alcoholto toast your upcoming nuptials.She paused, let out a huge breath.Theres something else, though.Something I need to share.To discuss with you.Its what I thought you were upset about.Im not upset.I realize that now.But you said you wanted to talk, and you were acting kind of funny.I was nervous.Nervous?You?About telling you.Afraid youd think I was being unfaithful to your grandmother.Oh, Pops.Her eyes filled with tears, and she blinked frantically.Never.Grandma Trudy was a lucky, lucky woman.All anybody had to do was look at the two of you, and they couldnt help seeing the love you shared.You were a great husband; she was a wonderful wife.You set an incredible example of what marriage should be.Her hands gripped the wheel a little tighter as emotion flooded her.But Grandma wouldnt want you to live the rest of your life alone.She glanced up through the windshield and waved a hand at the early evening sky.My guess is that biggest, brightest star up there is her, smiling down on us right now.Giving her blessing.Maggie heard a muffled sound and swiveled to see her grandpa blowing his nose on the white handkerchief he always carried.Even in the dim light from the dash, she saw his eyes were moist.Her own throat ached with unshed tears.My news, now.Time to dive in.You know I signed to do a fall line of clothing.Yep.For one of them big labels.Im so damned proud of you, Maggie, girl.You put off going away to school to help with Grandma when she got sick, then one thing and another.Turns out you didnt need that piece of paper.Youre gonna be a huge success without that degree.I think the jurys still out on that.Youve got a gift, Maggie, and now the world is gonna get to see it.The shows in New York.Dawning realization flashed in his eyes.How long you gonna be gone?Im moving there, Pops.Voice thick, he said, Should have guessed that.Probably would have if I hadnt been so wrapped up in my own doings.He patted her shoulder.Youve worked hard to make this happen.Cant say Im not gonna miss you cause I will.Like Id miss my right arm.But Im happy for you, sweetheart.Youre gonna take that city by storm.He raised a hip and tucked his hanky into his back pocket.Looks like weve got ourselves some major celebrating to do tonight.Is Dottie coming to dinner?Shell join us a little later, but we figured I should be alone with all of you when I dropped the bombshell.Give you and your folks some time to settle into it.Little bit of chicken in her, maybe.What do you think?I think shes a smart woman.Very smart.And very, very fortunate.Still more than a little shell shocked, Maggie parked the car in the Roadhouses dusty lot.She spotted her dads big truck under an oak, so they were already here.After nearly smothering her grandfather in a hug, she and Fletch crossed arm in arm to the ramshackle building.Bubbad hung a few early plants on the wide, wooden porch.Several Texas redbuds struggled to brighten the sides of the restaurant.But even at that, the place looked a little worse for wear, the siding weathered, the railing in need of stain.They walked up the stairs, and Pops, ever the gentleman, held the door for her.She stepped inside, half blinded by the comparative darkness, and straight into Brawley Odells arms.Hello, sweetheart.Didnt expect you here tonight.She yelped and would have backed away had he not reached out and clasped both her arms.Pops, who didnt seem to notice her discomfort, nodded at Brawley.Heard you were in Lone Tree today.Yes, sir, I was.Pops turned his attention to Maggie.Your mom and dad are already here.Ill go on over while you two chat.With that, he left her alone with her nemesis.Let go, Brawley.She kept her voice low.He dropped his hands to his sides.What are you doing here?she bit out.I might ask you the same.I came for dinner.With my folks.And I came for a beer.Cash is at the bar.Hes gonna help me draw up plans for a few renovations at the clinic.We decided to do it over a cold one.Renovations?He nodded.Doc hasnt made a single change to that place in way too many years.Its long overdue for a face lift.Even at five eight, she had to tip her head to meet his eyes.Why are you doing this, Brawley?I told you.Doc hasnt No.She shook her head.Im not talking about remodeling.Why are you really back here?Why this pretense?Pretense?She made a sound low in her throat.We both know youre not Maverick Junction.Not small town Texas.You belong in the big city with all its money and nightlife.The social niceties.The socialites.Youre at home there.Go back to Dallas, Brawley, and leave us alone.Us, she thought.She wouldnt use me.That would make it too personal, feed his already inflated ego.She shrugged off his hand but hadnt taken two steps before he was beside her again.He leaned into her, trapping her between the solid wall of his body and the buildings rough wooden one.Brawley!She shoved at him.People are looking.Let them.My parents are here.Yep.Saw them come in.What do you want?His eyes darkened to the color of midnight.You.Bullshit!She shoved at him.You look good tonight.Really?Personally, I prefer seeing the backside of youwhile youre walking away.And it is, after all, what you do best.He shook his head, straightening.Maggie, sweetheart, God broke the mold after he made you.Go to hell, Brawley.And Im not your sweetheart.His face took on an edge.You know, you accuse me of being big city, but whos heading to New York, the biggest of them all?Have you told your grandpa?His words stopped her.Its really not much of a secret, you know.Somebodys bound to let it slip tonight.I told him.On the way here.Good.Cause secrets have a way of turning on you.For one awful second, she wondered if hed uncovered the secret shed buried years ago.No.Brawley didnt talk in riddles.He said what he meant and meant what he said.It was that simple.Without another word, he left to join Cash.She hadnt been lying.She did enjoy the backside of him.Watching him walk away, she swore the man wore a pair of jeans better than any male alive.The sight was enough to make a grown woman drool.With her next breath, she cursed the day shed met him.Every time she figured shed exorcised him, he showed up again, proving her wrong.Unfortunately, like most things that tempted, Brawley was bad for her.She was strong, though.She could resist.At some point, he would become yesterdays news.And even though she longed to put him out of her mind, out of her heart, that idea saddened her.Around her, everyone quickly looked away, pretended they hadnt been indulging in a little harmless voyeurism.They slipped easily back into their own conversations and dinners.Maggie doubted there was a person in the room who didnt know her history with Brawley.That hed left her high and dry.Her dad waved from the corner table beneath the Lone Star flag, and she returned his greeting.Pasting a Miss America smile on her face, speaking to friends and neighbors as she passed, she sauntered across the room to join her parents.The entire time, she felt Brawleys gaze follow her.She would not look back.Shed already spent way too many years doing exactly that.The chrome Wurlitzer played a song about a man with wandering eyes and a cheating heart.Maybe she should buy a copy of it and play it till it seared itself into her memory bank.She snorted.As if she needed a reminder.Four  Steaming mug of coffee in hand, Brawley stepped out onto the second floor landing of his new apartment.He fought the temptation to leave the door unlocked.Maybe if he was very, very lucky, somebodyd come by and steal all the fussy doodads Annied left behind.Annie, then Sophie, he amended.Both cousins had lived here in Dotties second story apartment when theyd come to Maverick Junction.Both planned on a short stay, and each had ended up marrying one of his best friends.Darnedest thing.He propped his elbows on the railing, drinking in the early morning calm.A couple birds twittered from high in the trees.Below, Dotties garden was springing to life, bright blooms sprouting in patches.Dottie Willis.He loved the woman.Sheand her cookieshad been a part of his life forever.Her son Wes had been a couple years ahead of him in school.Hed played basketball, a damned good point guard who now lived in Albuquerque, where he had a law practice.Her daughter Lacey, a pretty little dark haired thing, lived in San Diego.Too bad.Miss Dottie would make one heck of a hands on grandma, and both Wes and Lacey had kids.He often wondered why she didnt move close to one of them.Shed surprised him when shed shown up at the roadhouse last night.All dolled up in pink silk pants and top and smelling heavenly, shed given both him and Cash a quick peck on the cheek, then joined Maggie and her family.Old Fletch had a grin the size of Texas on his face and had even kissed Dotties hand.The man was a true gentleman.Kisses and hugs had flowed freely at the Sullivan table.Hed nursed his beer and wondered how long it would take all that to dry up if he moseyed over to say hello.Once welcomed by the family, hed become a persona non grata.His fault.His bed to lie in.Carrying his coffee, Brawley hustled down the stairs.Hed stayed longer at Bubbas than hed intended last night.He and Cash had planned to grab a single beer and play with ideas for the clinics renovations.Brawley had hoped it would kill two birds with a single stoneget the plans under way and, at the same time, take his mind off a certain woman he couldnt get out of his head.Then, hed walked over to say hello to a friend and the door opened.Maggie waltzed through it, right smack into him.Damn his luck anyway.He unlocked the door to his Chevy Tahoe, set his coffee mug in the holder, and slid behind the wheel.Turning the key, the vehicle rumbled to life and he backed down the drive.All things considered, he supposed last night could have turned out worse.A lot worse, actually.He wasnt really sure whod come closer to losing ithim or Maggies dad.Sean Sullivan had considered Brawley a son back in the days when everyone assumed he and Maggie would get married.Not so now.Man, if looks could kill, his mama would be planning his funeral this morning.After his initial shock at finding Maggie in his arms, hed felt more than seen Maggies dad go on full alert.Then, out of the corner of his eye, hed watched Sean Sullivan come halfway out of his seat when hed touched Maggie during their heated conversation.No doubt about it.Hed walked a thin line.Maggies mom, though, had managed with a single touch to Seans arm and a few quiet words to get him to sit back down.Sean hadnt taken his eyes off him and Maggie, though, and Brawley knew that one wrong move, the man would be all over him.Pops, whod been friendly enough when theyd come in, didnt look any too happy, either.Papa bear with his cub, both of them.Brawley turned onto Main Street.Hed grab breakfast at Sallys.The truth?He deserved anything Maggies family could throw at himand more.The memory of her eyes bothered him most.Those spectacular green eyes had been bruised with hurt as theyd met his.Hurt and anger.The lady wasnt one to pull punches.Nothing about Margaret Emmalee Sullivan came close to lukewarm.If she was involved, she was in it up to her eyeballs.And you never had a lick of doubt about how she felt, because she had no problem telling you.As spitting mad as shed been at him, though, shed worked the room as she crossed to her parents table, stopping to talk to friends, kiss someones baby, laugh at a joke.By the time she made it to her folks, her anger seemed to have dissipated.Shed put him out of her mind.Hed been working on doing the same with her for over a decade now and still hadnt managed it.The rest of last night had been hell.Straddling the cowhide bar stool, pretending she wasnt there, pretending she didnt matter.Hed sipped his beer and half listened as Cash dissected the Rangers game that had just ended.All the while, he watched Mags.Shed leaned down to kiss both her parents, dropped another kiss on her grandfathers cheek, and took her seatback to him.Despite the rocky start, the Sullivans appeared to be in a celebratory mood.Theyd even broken out the champagne after Dottie arrivedif you could stretch the stuff Bubba stocked to fit the category.No doubt Maggies parents were proud as hell of their little girl and applauding her achievements.Little girl, his foot.Hah.Mags was a woman.All woman.Maybe she always had been.Brawley couldnt remember a time when she hadnt gotten him all churned up.Maggies mom surprised him, though.Hed have thought shed be all teary eyed at the idea of her baby leaving.Instead, Rita Sullivan, her hair a short, curly bubble, the same vivid red as her daughters, was all smiles.But come time for Maggie to hop on that New Yorkbound plane, no doubt Rita would turn on the waterworks.Pain seared his chest.Good thing he didnt still love her, or hed sit right down and cry, too.Heaven on the eyes, hell on the heart.Oh, yeah, that was Ms.Maggie Sullivan.The man whod written that song must have met her.Odd.While he hadnt been surprised to see them break out the bubbly, the toasts seemed aimed at Pops.And Dottie.What was he missing?Hed finally turned his back on their table and gotten down to business with Cash.By the time theyd finished their second beers, theyd come up with a fairly decent plan for the office renovations.Then Cash had gone home to his wife, and hed gone back to Dotties, to his frilly, girly apartment.Not quite what his life had been in Dallas.But then he hadnt wanted all that anymore, had he?Still, hed lain awake half the night rehashing things in his mind, hoping he hadnt made the second biggest mistake of his life by moving back to Maverick Junction.He parked his Chevy outside of Sallys and spied Mel heading into the Maverick Junction Daily.Hey, Mel.Brawley.Mel stopped, key in the newspaper office door.Youre up and around early today.I am every day.You had breakfast?He tipped his head toward the caf.Yep.Ate at home.Want another cup of coffee?Mel shook his head.Too much to do.Im on deadline.Okay, Brawley said.Im gonna grab a bite, then Ill come over, talk about what I had in mind for that ad I want to run.The minute he walked into the restaurant, he knew something big was in the air.The place buzzed with excitement.Hed barely sat down at his usual table by the front window when Sally, her frizzy blond hair pulled into a ponytail, hurried over.Whatever the latest gossip, it brought heightened color to her cheeks.You hear about Dottie?Then she swatted him with the menu in her hand.Course you have.Youre renting from her now, arent you?Brawley frowned.Yeah, I am, but no, I havent.Whats going on with her?She and Fletch Sullivan are getting married.What?Dottie and He shook his head.I heard you, Sally.Im just trying to decide if my brain processed the words correctly.Can you believe it?Struck mute, he simply stared at her.Guess that accounted for the champagne last night.Maggies grandpa and Dottie Willis?And nobodyd told him?And they hadnt called him over, hadnt shared the news, the excitement, with him.Time was they would have.And Dottie.She hadnt told him.Family first.He knew that.Still, it hurt.Maybe he had stayed away too long.After downing an egg white omelet as penance for yesterdays steak, he loped across the street to the newspaper office and pushed through the door.Hey, Mel.Ive got the copy written for that ad.Time to let the town know Im taking over for Maggie leaned into the counter, her head close to Mels blond one.At the sound of his voice, she turned, cocking a hand on that curvy hip.You do insist on a grand entrance, dont you?This makes two days in a row youve come barging in on me.He frowned.Difference is that yesterday I meant to.I didnt expect youd be here today.Shouldnt you be in Lone Tree?A wise man, Mel said nothing.He simply straightened and watched the two, a half smile on his lips.Today, fire engine red colored Maggies nails.She tapped one on that full bottom lip, drawing his gaze.Are you stalking me, Brawley Odell?Hah hah.Very funny.I was about to ask you the same, he returned easily.Those perfectly manicured brows rose in disdain.I was here first.Yeah, you were.But I was at Bubbas first last night.He turned to Mel.Did I or did I not tell you Id be in after I ate?You did.Brawley swiveled back to Maggie.You were outside, heard, and waited for the right moment.So youd get here before me.Her mouth dropped open.You arrogant Hey, you accused me first.She glared at him.Doesnt matter, Brawley said.Not in the least.I came to do business.Me, too.Im placing an ad.I need to hire someone to run the shop while Im gone.His heart, damn it all to hell, gave a frantic leap of joy.While youre gone?So this move to the city isnt permanent?Of course it is.Butwell, Id like to keep the boutique open for a while yet.Crestfallen, his idiot heart stopped its happy frolic and collapsed.Still, his voice sounded steady when he said, Thats probably smart.Maggie, rather than answer, returned her attention to Mel.So were good to go here?She tipped her chin at the paper between them.Yep.And itll run starting this afternoon?Mel nodded.Okay.Thanks a bunch.She gave him a quick peck on the cheek and swung around to leave.Brawley caught her arm.She stared at his hand, then up at him.This seems to be a habit of yours, so I feel compelled to say it again.Youre going to want to let go of me.He did.When she took another step toward the door, he said, Wait a minute, Mags.Why didnt you tell me about Fletch and Dottie yesterday?They werent the subject of our conversation.Besides, when we talked earlier, I didnt know.He told me on the way to Bubbas.Seriously?He whistled softly.That must have been some chat the two of you had last night.Both of you with big news.Yeah.She chuckled.I almost drove off the road when he dropped his on me.Bet you did.He grinned.It made my announcement a whole lot easier.Brawley nodded.Pops wont be alone.That matters to you.She met his eyes.It does.
