Robert clenches his fist again to await his friends response.Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive ...get the picture, says Jerry with great confidence.I mean the girl.Is she in love with you and ready to leave her fiance?Who the hell cares about that shit, man?I had sex with two best friends on the same damn night, hours apart.Thats the deal Im talking about.Thats like getting with two sisters or a mother daughter combo, man.Jerry, he says in a low sharp tone, listen to what I am saying.These women are both probably waiting on a call from you.Are you going to call either or both?What!Neither, man.You are killing my buzz.Im giving you the low down on a fantasy and you keep asking crazy questions.Just soak in the moment will you?Roberts brows draw together.Where is your common sense?Did you think about me or Mary while you were out on your escapade?This has nothing to do with the two of you.Robert bolts to his feet.He unclenches his fists but the sneer imbedded in his face will not move.He swallows hard to rid himself of his dry throat.Somehow, he manages to speak with the same calmness though it is pointed.I told you earlier to choose between the women.What the hell are you doing trying to have both?These are best friends.You turn them against each other and Mary will be caught in the middle and then I will get shafted.Goddamn it, Jerr, why did you pick now to live out your fantasy?Im sorry, man, I didnt think about you.I had no idea you and Mary would be affected by what I was doing.Sorry.Jerry puts his hand on his friends shoulder to relay his regret with a personal touch.Forget it, the deeds done.Tell me, Jerry, do you prefer one over the other?I hadnt thought about it.I guess I will have to decide.Yeah, you damn well will decide!Pick and be done with it or leave them alone.Ill give it some thought.Jerry searches his friends face for an inkling of forgiveness.Do you want me to talk to Mary?Jerry asks in a low tone.Hell no, as a matter of fact, pack your bags.We are going back to New York right now.Go home and pack and dont answer your phone.Matter of fact, Ill get your phone in the locker room and take you home.You are not going to cause any more trouble.While we are gone you are going to make a choice.Robert and Jerry leave the steam room.When they arrive at the Miami International Airport they move toward security with briefcases.Please step this way, says the security officer.He waves his wand over both men.They grab their items out of the baskets and put their shoes back on.Then it is down the escalator to their gate.You want a pizza or sandwich, says Jerry trying to do something to ease his friends tension.No.Robert says with a quick and sharp tone to cut him off.Over there.Robert points to two seats up front by the loading area.They sit and wait for boarding.Now boarding flight 862 for New Yorks LaGuardia Airport.All first class customers please come forward at this time.Robert and Jerry check in and board the airplane.Would you like a magazine to read sir?asks the flight attendant.Gauging his friends silence, Jerry shakes his head.Popping open his laptop, he types in rushed strokes and then turns the screen to his friend.I thought I should send flowers to Mary, from you, of course.These look nice.I could have a card enclosed with a message from you?Jerry searches his eyes.What do you want her to know about your leaving so suddenly?he waits, hoping he has hit on something useful.Robert takes the laptop and scrolls through the pictures then hands it back after making his choice.Dont you dare send a thing to either of the girls until after you have made your choice.He glances out the window then relaxes a bit more.After placing the order, Jerry watches his friend hoping he has redeemed himself.When they arrive at the airport they go straight to the airport hotel to rest.Jerry orders a light lunch for them and Robert opens his laptop and begins going over the numbers.They eat and talk about the markets.15: Flowers      Saturday morning was a busy day for the Belmont.At eight oclock, Barbara waited on guests at the front deskall yelled with the patience of a child.Mary gasped at the chaos.She leaned in, What the hell!Barbara whispered, I hate tourists.The computer rebooted again and now I have to wait to get these people in the system and they are not being cooperative at all.Could you help me for a minute so I can sort out all their problems?Do you want arrivals or checkouts?Trying to decipher who yelled the least proved futile.Ill take the checkouts.Mary grabbed a pad and pen then she went over to the next station and turned the computer on.While it warmed up she turned to the yelling crowd of guests.Excuse me please, excuse me!The crowd grew silent.Let me have your attention.We are having trouble with our computer system but will have the kinks worked out shortly.I need you to form two lines.I will take the checkouts in this line and she will handle the check ins in that line.Please get in the correct line and we will speed you through as fast as possible.The people continued to mumble and complain but held the noise down as they got into the proper lane.Mary asked for names from the first couple in her line.She checked the computer, it was still booting up.She took their keys.I will take down your credit card information and keep it on file for one week.If there is a problem we will phone you before we bill you.Thank you for staying with us and please come back.She smiled politely at the angry couple as they turned to leave.Mary waited on four couples and had them checked out in 20 minutes.She then went back to Barbara to see what was happening with the check ins.A flushed Barbara did her best to stay calm.Mary, the entry system is down again and I cant check anyone into rooms.I cant even tell which rooms are clean or which need maid service.This is a big mess.Mary thought for a second and then came up with a solution.She stood in front of the ten fuming couples.May I have your attention please?We need you to bear with us because the computer is down again.We will check each of you in by hand.If you have your receipt or printout from the internet that contains your rooms information on it please step over here.Mary directed them to her right.Five of the couples had their paperwork.Good, now please take out your information and we will get you into a room in 15 minutes.I am asking you to be patient and realize you may not be in the right room.If that is the case then when the computers are back up we will move you to your correct room and give you a credit.Our goal is to get you in a room so you can unwind.I am sure you want to see the city and go to the beaches so lets get you rested so you can enjoy your visit.Mary then directed the remaining five couples to sit in the lobby.A large lobby came in handy during these times.We will take care of you when we get back.It shouldnt take more than 20 minutes to get the rest of you into rooms.I thank you for your patience.This is our fault and we will fix it.Mary and Barbara grabbed a handful of keys and led the first five with paperwork out through the glass double doors to the rooms.Barbara took two couples and Mary took the other three.They wrote down their information on their pads and assigned them to rooms on the first floor that were equal in value to their paperwork.It took them less than 15 minutes to sprint back to the others.Mary and Barbara walked to the seated couples.Mary asked, Lets start with you two.May I have your names and the room you signed up for please?The man stood, we had a superior room with a garden view.Thank you.Mary consulted the chart.She turned to Barbara, put them in room 114 please.Okay, said Barbara to Mary.Come with me please and I will take you to your room.Barbara led them out through the double doors to their room.She checked the room for cleanliness before handing them the keys.If you have any further problems please let us know and I am so sorry you had to wait because of downed computers.You two have been great and I thank you for your patience.Barbara rushed back for the next couple.Mary eyed an old man with a cane and a woman in a wheelchair.Could you tell me your names and what room you purchased?The old man stood.The room is not important as long as we can get something up front, close to the door, and with a bathroom for the disabled.I have just the room, said Mary.May I have your names, please?Mr.and Mrs.Dellington, said the old man.Barbara returned to Marys side.Whos next?Take Mr.and Mrs.Dellington to room 102 please.This way please, said Barbara, holding the door open.Barbara returned from her last guest check in to find Mary tapping keys on the computer.Where in the world is your help today?You know Mrs.Belmont cut back on help.I only have Ginger and Ralph and both called in sick.I could have been all right if the computers had stayed up.Im sorry I had to call you, Mary.Its ok, Barb.Keep using this system until the computers are back up and call me if guests start coming in too fast.Mary went back into her office to rest.Barbara stayed out front and continued to check in guests.She turned her computer off and checked everyone in by hand the rest of the day.She kept the front clear of guests by lining up room keys and passing them out as soon as people came up.Mary came back out in the middle of the day to see if anything had changed with Barbara.She was pleased to find no one waiting.Everything is looking good, Barb.Has the entry system come back on line yet?No, not yet.Our tech people believe it is isolated to this workstation and will have it solved by morning.Well if you run into this problem again you have the authority to pull people from housekeeping to help you.Start with Jill and if she gives you trouble go with Pam or Alice and then call me when everything has settled down, all right?I sure will.Barbaras attention shifted to the window a florist truck pulled up.Two men got out with a bunch of flowers.Look at that, Mary; do you think they are here for a room?I dont know, but if they are, they have enough flowers to get lucky tonight.They laughed and then watched while the men brought the flowers in.The first man set the flowers on the desk and pulled out a clipboard.He turned toward Barbara.Hello, my name is Ralph Long.I have a delivery for Mary Lake, the office manager.Could you point me in the right direction, please?Marys eyes grew wide; she had never received flowers before.I am Mary Lake, are those for me?Yes, they are.Would you like them left here or do you want us to take them to your office?Here will be fine, thank you.Please sign here to confirm delivery, please.He handed her his clipboard and she signed on the signature line then gave the board back to him.Oh, I almost forgot the card.He took a card out of his jacket and handed it to Mary.Have a nice day, Madame.Thank you.The men left and Barbara could not contain herself any longer.Well, who is it from and what does it say?Mary quietly reads the card: Dear Mary, I am thinking of you and decided to send these flowers as both a gift and a peace offering.Unfortunately I had to leave and I took Jerry with me for a business trip.I hope to be back by Tuesday and regret I did not have time to tell you in person.Enjoy the flowers and forgive me for leaving so abruptly.Robert.Mary smiled and looked up at Barbara.Its from Robert.He and Jerry had to leave town for a business trip.I dont believe it!Barbara frowned.Can I read it?Please!Mary smelled the flowers while Barbara read the card.Robert had sent two sets of flowers.The first was a Red Rose and Calla Lily Bouquet and the second was multi colored Tulips.Mary looked at the flowers and felt overwhelming joy.She remembered her night with Robert and their kiss good night.She allowed herself to drift for a moment then regained her focus.Barb, help me take these to my office.Do you know anything about watering flowers?Barbara put the card down and thought about its meaning.Why was Jerry gone and why did they leave so fast?She heard Mary asking her for help and said, No, I know nothing about flowers.They always died when I took care of them.I would do better at goldfish so if he sends you some of them, let me know.She grinned at Mary and picked up the pot of tulips.Mary picked up the vase of roses and they walked down to her office.Anywhere in particular you want these?No, just set them down on the table and I will pick out a place later.Are you going to force me to ask, Mary?Ask what?What did you do or better yet, what did you give up to get those flowers?Marys face glowed with embarrassment.She grinned, waggled her brows like Robert had done, then stuck out her tongue.Im not telling.I am a good girl; you know how shy we good girls are.Mary teased her unmercifully.She knew Barbara couldnt stand it when she didnt get the answers she wanted.So Mary kept silent on the subject.When she saw that she was infuriating poor Barbara, she decided to change the subject.Have you seen Jill today?Barbara didnt want to answer.She was no fool.She knew what her friend was doing and didnt like it one bit.She was wondering how Mary had perceived her question.Did she think she was prying and just being noisy?Or did she think that maybe she was jealous?The truth is that she only wanted to know so she could figure out what it is that she was doing wrong.She was crazy about Jerry but Jerry had not sent her flowers.She had sex with him twice last night and was absolutely positive that she showed him a good time.But still she had no flowers for her effort.What was it that Mary was doing that she was failing to do?Barbara simply needed to know.She braved Marys taunts and asked again.Come on, Mary, be honest with me.I really need your help.Barbara sat and sighed.What is it about me that no man will send me flowers?Am I really that big of a slut?Marys face fell.Oh, no, Barb.She rushed over and hugged her friend.Dont believe that talk, you are not a slut.You go a little further than others do sometimes, but you are just you and guys have just got to learn that.Mary fumbled with her words while her friend shifted her large frame in a creaky chair.She didnt know exactly what to say but knew she had to say something.How did it go with Jerry after I left?We screwed.Mary took a step back at Barbaras bluntness.Okay, now tell me the details.Take a deep breath and slow down and tell me everything.Mary pulled a chair beside her friends chair and held her hands while she concentrated on what she wanted to say.After you left, me and Jerry danced some more then we talked some more.That sounds good.Well, let me back up a bit.When you and I first went to the ballroom and you went on to the balcony with Robert, we hooked up.We left the party and had a quickie in the closet ...Oh, Barb, you didnt?I couldnt help it; we had a strong sexual connection.We had to do it, I mean ...it was like I was on fire and had to put it out immediately.Im listening, go on.Mary kept holding her hands.We went back to the ballroom and you know that part, then I asked him to come with me to the Culver Room and help me change out of my dress.We started making out on the couch and when it was getting good some people came in and interrupted us.We hightailed it out of there but we made a connection, I am sure of it.He gave me compliments and said how good I looked in my dress.Mary, he said I looked like an angel and I just melted.She let go of Marys hand and chastised herself by hitting herself in the forehead with her hand.Why am I such a sucker?Do you think he likes me?You got flowers.Robert and Jerry are together so why didnt I get flowers?Barbara puts her face in her hands and starts to cry.Mary holds her, feeling her devastation.Oh Barb, dont be like that.Give it time and good things will happen for you.I dont know how to say it except to say that we are just not looking for the same things in men.I have done the one night stands and need something more now.You just need patience.Take time to figure out what you really want, all right?Now listen to me, slow down and dont go so fast.I dont know a lot but I do know that it is not a race.All right?Barbara pulls herself together and stops crying.She stands.Thanks for your help.Let me get back to work and get out of your hair.Mary brushes Barbaras red hair out of her face and gives her a tissue off her desk.Here, Lord knows I have cried so much that I know a good tissue when I see one.Both start laughing.They hug and Barbara leaves the office.Mary looks at her flowers and falls in love with the red and white flower arrangement.Suddenly, she claps a hand to her chest.Stabbing pains knock her to the floor.She cannot catch her breath.She hyperventilates.Tears stream down her feet as she holds herself.She may die if she cant get herself to calm down and take in oxygen.Then, as fast as it began it ends.She lies on the floor staring up at the ceiling.She can focus and see the tiles.She can breathe.She lies there taking in air.Mary has always had a way of messing things up and this time was no different.She thinks about the flowers and asks herself questions that she cant possibly answer.Why didnt Robert say goodbye in person?Why did he have to leave in the dead of night?Did she do something to force him to leave?Should she have given more of herself like Barbara to leave no doubt of her feelings for him?What did the flowers mean?Is there significance to the color of the roses or the number of Tulips?Was he sending her a message?Does she have to sleep with him or lose him?Mary had so many questions and she knew if she stayed in the office she would go crazy.Mary climbed to her feet.She opened her desk drawer and took out a mini bottle and drank it down.She closed the drawer and left the office.Mary walked over to the gym and into the womens locker room.She found her locker and changed her clothes.She went out into the exercise room, found a treadmill, cranked up the volume on her headphones, and ran for dear life.She blocked out the world and chased peace.16: Brace Yourself      Saturday night was a night for unwinding from a long workday.In the hotel industry weekends often take their toll on employees.While others get to jet off to exotic locations and relax, the hotel employee works during the best months of travel.They are often unable to take advantage of the many deals that are available from retailers to save money.Often their job is simply to put up with crabby people and bad behavior and do it all with a smile.The three best friends, Jill, Mary and Barbara, went to another new club to put away the days bad memories.Mary had partial relief from her running on the treadmill but found the thoughts of the flowers creeping back in.Mary dressed conservatively as usual; she wore blue jeans and a pair of Keds Champion Canvas shoes with a sleek and stylish, oversized Charmeuse blouse.The blouse was blue with a shawl collar and an on trend tie closure that added easy elegance.She bought it from the Belmonts Boutique; it was by Marc Bouwer from his M collection.She wore her long brown hair in a free flowing curly hairstyle and secured it in the back with a blue bowtie.She carried a blue tote bag with long strap over her right shoulder and entered the club first.Jill, who had missed a day and a half of work, arrived with a new almost punk hairstyle.She had cut her blond hair into a shag hairstyle with long layers.She saw Mary gazing at her.Not wanting to talk about Bert, she cut from her friend to look at the crowd.Jills dress was back to tame compared with her party outfit from the night before.She wore a white medium length skirt with low heels.Her blouse was a Rose Peasant Tunic, a black and white floral print.It was a billowy peasant silhouette with a ruffled, tie neck and drop waist.She carried no purse with her and put her identification in her bra after passing through security.Jill entered and joined Mary at the bar for a drink.Barbara arrived fifteen minutes later.Jill saw her come in from her seat at the bar.What a slut!Mary saw Barbara in the doorway.Not tonight, Jill.The last thing I need is you two going at each other.Im fine; just keep the slut away from me.She turned back around, hey barkeep, two more Cosmopolitans over here.Barbara stood in the doorway looking around the room.She was not looking for men this time, she was looking for her co workers and knew she was late.Barbara wore a tan colored, Pearl embellished V neck blouse and let her long red hair flow behind her.She thought the blouse would go well with her hair and skin color.She wore a pair of Blue London Jeans with curve hugging fit.They were VS Siren Legging Jeans that were part jean; part legging, and totally sexy.Although they fit her tightly they were stretchy and comfortable and made her feel like she was the hottest woman in the world.She spotted her friends at the bar and waved.Mary waved back but Jill had her back turned to her, drinking.Hey guys, what are you having?Cosmopolitans, said Mary.She stood and hugged Barbara.Is that a new top?She asked her but said nothing about her tight jeans.Yes, I ordered it two weeks ago and it just came in.It was waiting for me when I got home.I love the way it fits, do you really like it?I love it, said Mary.Jill finished her drink.She spun on her stool to look at Barbara.I like the fake pearls but hate the spandex.Its not spandex.Why dont you get your eyesight checked, I know a guy.Jill snickered.You know tons of guys.Stop right now.Mary said to both.She spotted an empty table.Come on, lets grab that table.A server came over and took their orders.Bring us a pitcher of Budweiser and three glasses, please.And a Rum and Coke, please, added Barbara who had catching up to do.The server looked at Jill, anything else?She said with a Spanish accent.No.That will be all, said Jill.The server was Cuban and Jill had many bad dealings with Cubans.The server returned moments later with their orders.Mary searched for a neutral topic.Jill, is that blouse from the Boutique?No, I saw a lady wearing it inside the Victorias Secret store at the Intracoastal Mall.She reached for the pitcher and filled the three glasses and took a drink.After sipping for taste, Barbara drank down the rest.I didnt come here to fight, Jill.Mary wants peace and quiet so I will do my part.She smiled at Mary.Mary nodded to Barbara and reached for her glass.Jill said nothing and forged ahead with her drinking.They chitchatted about their workday and finished the first pitcher and ordered a second.Mary and Barbara did most of the talking while Jill drank.Mary was beginning to slur her words and got up to go to the bathroom.After she was gone, Jill looked at Barbara, why the fuck do you always have to come out with us?Its been three years, dont you have any new friends by now.Her Alabama accent reared its head through her slurred speech.Im not fighting with you tonight.Mary wants peace and I am going to give it to her.If you were a real friend, so would you.Jills brows arched with her shoulders.Her face reddened.She took aim like a ballistic missile.Friend!she shrieked.You dont know what the fuck a fucking friend is bitch!Shut the fuck up and get a life!Barbaras red face matched hers.She curled her fist to knock Jill on her large backside.Mary returned from the bathroom.Barbara flexed her fists under the table and kept silent, resorting to shooting daggers at her enemy.Im back ladies, what did I miss?Mary was all smiles and poured herself another drink.Nothing at all, said Barbara in an air of serenity.Jill again said nothing and picked up her drink and drank it down in one gulp, finishing the second pitcher of beer.The tension at the table thickened.Jill was in a mood that would not get any better as the night progressed.Barbara scanned the dance floor, smiling.She finished her drink and called for a server.Could you bring us another pitcher please?The server hesitated for a moment then agreed and left.Barbara said, I see an old friend dancing over there, Ill be back.Jill watched Barbara make her way over to the dance floor.Barbaras friend had stopped dancing and was talking with another man.She tapped him on the back and he turned around and hugged her.They went over to a table and were laughing and talking.Jill looked at Barbara and was disgusted that she had such a big smile on her face and was showing every tooth in her mouth.I wonder if slut bags is going to show him just how big her mouth is?Mary didnt want to look at them but turned to see what was bugging Jill so much.She didnt see anything wrong, yes Barbara was twirling her red hair seductively and grinning but she saw nothing out of the ordinary.You have been shitty to Barb all night long, what the hell is your problem tonight?Mary stumbled over the words.Why do we have to hang out with her every time we go out?God, Mare, she is pathetic.Jill maintained her disapproval of Barbara and did not care if Marys night would go well or not.We need to get rid of her fat ass and send her back to the boondocks where a bitch like her would feel at home.Her country accent grew more pronounced with every slurred word.Mary scowled.If I get rid of Barb I would get rid of you, too.Now stop your craziness and tell me what the hell is wrong!Rage flashed across Jills face.How could Mary be so blind?How could she like such a tart?She pushed her drink aside and snapped her fingers at the server who was taking an order nearby.The server trudged over and gave her a tight smile.Two Mojitos.Her accent made it difficult for the server to know what she wanted.Excuse me but I didnt understand what you wanted.Two fucking Mojitos, bitch, did you understand me that fucking time?Learn the fucking language or get back on your raft and take your ass home.Can we get two Mojitos, please, and then we are finished for the night.Mary said calmly to the Cuban woman serving them.Bring me the bill and dont forget to write in your tip.The server smiled and nodded at Mary.She gave a weary look to Jill and then she left.Mary wanted to yell at Jill but knew it would not do any good.Let her ride it out and it would be better in the morning.She looked for Barbara and saw her still at the table with her friend.They were drinking and talking and having a good time.Has she forgotten about Jerry?She wished that she could forget about the flowers but they were always there in the back of her mind.She thought about how she would handle the situation when Robert returned from his business trip but had no solution.If only she had her friend to talk it over with.Tonight that would be impossible.She thought about the last time she was with a man and what she would do with Robert.How far would she go?What will a man like him expect?Should she have had sex with him already?Mary needed her friend but would have to wait for answers.The server came back with the bill and she doubled the servers tip and handed her a credit card.Here you go.Thank you, said the server.She ran Marys card at the table and gave it back to her.You be careful leaving and have a nice night tonight.The woman then left to wait on new arrivals.Mary looked at Jill who was still drinking and glaring at Barbara.As good as you are looking tonight, why dont you go take a spin on the dance floor and let everyone take a look at you?Jill drank some more, not tonight, Mare, drinking is the word of the day.The words did not make sense but Mary knew what she meant.She took a sip of her drink and looked at the half empty pitcher of beer.She tried to remember who drank the most and whether that was the third or just the second, she had lost count.Barbara came back to the table waving a piece of paper with some writing on it.Guess what?We have all been invited to a Miami Dolphins football game.She nodded, smiling.Box seats with catering service.Oh yeah!She was so proud she waved the paper at both women.I guess lying on your back pays off every now and then.
