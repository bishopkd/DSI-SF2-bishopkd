I called out to him and he turned to look at me.His chubby face smiled at me.His hair was blowing in the wind.I reached my arms out to grab him but his face turned into a mad face.He began yelling at me.I couldnt make out the words but something was wrong.I fell off a cliff, my body diving into the cool air.It turned me upside down and around.I stopped just inches before colliding my body into the cement beneath me.A maze filled the once clear air.I ran my hand through the stone walls as I began to walk.Noises began to fill the void behind the sky turned a dark color.Rain began splattering in all directions and I began to run.Turning right and left as I hurried through the maze.Each time I reached a dead end I would scream out a curse.Help me.I pleaded as I made my way back to the beginning.This only caused me to become more lost.I sat down in utter exhaustion and saw the woman from the party earlier.Having a hard time?I nodded and hung my head.This maze was ridiculous.Take my hand.She held her hand out and I looked up at her.Do it.She commanded and I did as told.I took her hand and closed my eyes.When I opened them again there was Rex.You need to marry him.She whispered and I looked over at him.He was in skinny jeans and a tank top.His tattoos were brilliant against his tan skin.You need to make him happy.Once he is happy, you will be happy as well.How do you know?What will happen with Shauna and Oct?You ask too many questions.Be simple.See what is in front of you.You have something unique.Dont lose it.Once you get something amazing and claim it, nothing can ever take it.I nodded to looked up at her.Her eyes were smiling even though her face wasnt.It is okay to be scared.I was at first too.It is not that hard.She began disappearing and I opened my mouth but stopped myself from speaking.I stood there looking at Rex.He was smiling but not at me.Krystie tore through the image and hugged him.If you dont see what is in front of you it will be gone.Her voice filtered through my mind.Krystie broke in pieces in front of him as I set my jaw and decided I was his.I was his.Simple.A smile spread across my face and I realized I had made the decision.I would become immortal and join the Tainted as one of their own.I would be immortal.Rex turned into a cloud of smoke and blackness overtook me once more.I awoke to a large red room.There was a chandelier hanging from the ceiling with various paintings spread across the walls.I curled into Rex and pulled the covers over us.I was freezing.I rubbed my eyes and looked at him.He looked restless, peaceful, while he slept.You had the dream didnt you.He whispered and opened his eyes.They were bright blue and I tilted my head at him.You did.Marjorie told you what to do didnt she?He kissed me and I couldnt help kissing him back, a smile beaming on my face.She is the oldest of the immortals.She has a connection with each of us nobody else does.You did have the dream right?The last question his voice quivered as he was scared I didnt.If it was her telling me what to do, then yes I did.He let out a whoop and pulled me close against him.Anya I want you to be mine.I want you to marry me.His voice rose an octave with pure excitement and I couldnt contain my own excitement.I want to Rex.Yes!I want to be yours.Our lips met with a spark.I felt the happiest I have ever felt in my whole life.Something inside of me had begun to grow when we had met and now was blooming full and bright.The whole fireworks sensation everyone talks about?This was fireworks forever, standing right underneath them and the sparks touching my cheeks.It was pure excitement, love and everything a human being needs to live wrapped into one.He put a finger to my lip and told me to stay put.I wrapped the sheets around me and he disappeared into another room.I pouted for a minute but soon he returned.He held out a small blue box.For those women out there, yes it was a Tiffanys box!What is this?Well it is like any other marriage.He opened the box and held it out.Will you marry me?There in front of me was a large heart shaped diamond.Smaller diamonds went down the side of the platinum ring.It was the prettiest ring I had ever seen and must have cost a fortune.I sat breathless for a minute and nodded.I looked up at him and a few tears fell down my cheeks.He brushed them away and slipped the ring onto my finger.I love you.He kissed me and ran his fingers through my hair.I played with the ring for a minute before giggling.I love you so much Rex.I hugged him and couldnt take the smile off my face.Oh man, wait till the ladies see this at work.Wait, Shauna was debating getting married.I pulled away and gave him a wry look.What?He asked helplessly and tried to hug me again.Are you asking me because Octavius asked Shauna?I pulled the covers tighter around me but stopped as I saw the pure shock on his face.What?Oh good.I giggled and hugged him tightly.They are too?That is crazy!I could feel the humour in his voice but couldnt stop myself from being excited.I kissed him and we fell back into the tangle of sheets once more.He slid one hand up into my hair, tangling his fingers within it.He wrapped his other hand around my waist and slid me close to him as he began kissing me.We should probably not do that wherever we are.I murmured between kisses.We did it last night.Why is tonight any different?He smirked.I dont even know where we are!He pulled the sheet away from me and I raised an eyebrow.We are safe.Relax.You are engaged, you shouldnt worry about where we do it.His eyes twinkled and I let myself relax under his weight.We better be safe.Or I am blaming you.I wouldnt let you get hurt darling.I smiled and his lips pressed themselves against mine once more.I was getting married.Who would believe that?After my husband dying and living four years with depression, my apartment burning up and my car shitting the bed I could still find happiness.We had managed our way home after celebrating our engagement.Right as I walked through the door of my new home my phone rang.Hello?I answered after I realized it was Shauna.We are getting married!Me too.I giggled and I could hear her laugh on the other end.Seriously?This is ridiculous!I nodded and looked over at Rex.We should have our bachelorette parties together.I smirked over at Rex as she laughed on the other end.Gotta go.But lets plan on that.Bye.Her voice was chirpy, happier than it had been in a while.I still couldnt believe my best friend was getting married, let alone me.Shauna?Rexs voice asked as I nodded and put my phone away.Do you swear you didnt plan this?I asked as I wrapped my arms around his neck.Scouts honor my lady.He laughed and kissed me.I want to show you something.I raised an eyebrow and tilted my head to the side.He took my hand in his and pulled me to his bedroom.Oh that kind of something!He laughed and shook his head.No I am serious!He lightly placed me on the bed and left the room.Close your eyes.I let out a sigh and closed my eyes.I peeked through my fingers as he walked into the room.He was holding a large painting but it was backwards so I couldnt see it.Okay.Look.I opened my eyes as he turned it around.It was a painting of me.I was standing in my dress from the night before with my mask on.I was leaning against a wall, one leg up and the split perfectly falling where you couldnt see anything.He captured my eyes perfectly, my mask looked delicate and you could see the curves in my dress.I stared at it for a while before he coughed.It is beautiful.I smiled and he sat on the bed next to me.When did you make it?I looked up at him and kissed his cheek.Last night after you fell asleep.He stroked my hair.We can put it in the new house if you want.What?New house?I raised an eyebrow and leaned back a bit.Yes.We need a new house.This is only big enough for me.Does he forget he lives in a huge house?I didnt know what to say.Um..Okay.What is wrong with this house?Cant you just let me buy us a house?Do you want one as big as Octavius?Or smaller?As big as Octs!That was a mansion.I will have to look at the houses first.I stuttered and he touched my belly.Well how many bedrooms should I look for?I pushed his hand away playfully.I dont know.Ask me tomorrow.I laughed and leaned back on the bed.Did he just ask if I wanted children along with a house?Oh goodness.This is a lot to handle.He kissed my neck and I let myself relax a little.Well would you consider having children?I never thought of it before honestly.I whispered and closed my eyes.The air seemed stuffy and he slowly leaned over me, placing the painting to the side.His body slid across mine and when I opened my eyes he was on top of me.He leaned down and kissed me gently.Well I would love kids.He whispered in my ear and kissed down my shoulder to my ring.I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back to my lips.Kids never were anything Brian and I talked about.I didnt want them because we were too young, and then I didnt want one because I was too consumed by work.Maybe I could finally have a child now.Maybe I finally could be the mother I always subliminally wanted to me.I didnt even hear the door open as his lips were on mine.I heard a deep voice break through the bliss I was in.Rex we need you now.He turned towards them and stood up.There were two large men in black tuxes and aviators.One was tall with a bulky stance and short black hair.The other was shorter and wider with medium length brown hair.Rex let out a low growl and stood in front of me.I pulled the covers around myself and felt fear rising up in my throat.Go away.I told you it is over.I am through with her.The taller one nodded and took a step towards him.We cant do that.Tell her yourself.The mans voice was so deep.He looked from me back to Rex.He looked like he was from the FBI or something, just bursting into our apartment.Before I could piece together what they were there for Rex responded.I have!His hands turned into fists.I had never seen him this angry before.I looked at each man and slowly stood up next to Rex and took his hand.My eyes showed my fear but I tried to make it diminish.Thats her?The brown haired one snorted and stuck his sausage finger at me.I scowled at him and they began to walk around the room.I pressed myself closer to Rex and he protectively wrapped his arm around me.What is going on?I asked, my voice was shaking.Nothing, just keep quiet.He hissed back at me, never taking his eyes off of the two brutes.The brown haired one picked up the painting of me and let out a low laugh before tossing it onto the bed.Thank god it didnt break, I swear I could have killed him.The black haired one touched his ear and began talking into a small piece of electronic.He nodded and waved at the other man to leave.She will be by tonight, if you arent here there will be trouble.He smirked and tapped his sunglasses at me.Nice day lady.Once they left the house Rex tore away from me and began running around gathering things up.I stood completely still.What the fuck were they talking about?She?Who!A few minutes passed as my head wrapped around all the possibilities.The worst case scenario was that it was a woman from his past who he broke up with.Now she wants him back.He touched my shoulder.Anya?My eyes were slightly glazed over in thought.He shook me and repeated my name.What the fuck was that Rex!I yelled at him and pulled away.I thought you said you didnt have any shit like that!My voice was raised, the first time I had ever yelled at him.You said you would tell me everything.You said no secrets.You promised me Rex.I sounded defeated and exhausted even though emotions were welling up inside of me.I know baby.I promise I will explain but it is not safe here for you.Why!Who is this woman?He didnt look at me, only at the ground.He spoke softly and reached for my hand but I denied it from him.My mother.He whispered.What the?I groaned and walked into the kitchen, plopping down in a chair and putting my head in my hands.She wasnt immortal?She was a human and his father was a God.How is she living?That doesnt make any sense.He followed me and took my hand in his despite my restraint.Honey, it is a really long story.Just please listen to me.We cant stay here.His voice dropped.If we do she will kill you.I looked up at him, shocked at this sick joke he was playing.As I looked into his eyes I realized he wasnt playing around, he was completely serious.Okay.I whispered.I grabbed one of the bags as he thrust it at me.I slid on clothes quickly.I took my purse and followed him to the Escalade.We threw the bags into the back and I climbed in.Where will we go?I looked over at him.He turned the car on and sped out of the driveway.He turned the music and I figured he was pretty pissed.The hard rock music blared as we made our way to the highway.I took out my phone and texted Octavius.Okay long story short, Rex is pissed.He is taking me somewhere.Any clue where?About three seconds later my phone began to ring.He took the phone from my hand and threw it in the back.Hey!I reached back to grab it but he caught my arm.No texting.She will find us.He spoke quietly but stern.His face was straightforward on the road, he never had looked over at me when he spoke.His nose was flaring and his jaw was set.I nodded and bit the inside of my lip as I watched the passing trees.We had gone out of the city and into a countryside.There were only a few houses every couple of miles.I leaned back in my chair and pushed my hair from my face.I was terrified, so many more questions running through my mind.I had finally gotten over the immortality aspect and now a psycho mother?No way this was a normal family.Maybe I should have asked before I had gotten caught up in all of this.I closed my eyes and felt his hand on my knee.He always did this when he drove, it comforted me and I think it secretly made him relax.I kept my eyes closed as the questions blew through my mind.I picked the ones most important and repeated them in my head so when we stopped I could ask.My phone went off again but I didnt bother trying to get it.His thumb stroked the side of my knee and I turned towards him.He wrapped his arm around me and I sunk against his shoulder.I love you.I whispered.I just wish I knew where we were going.He nodded but his eyes never left the road.You will see.Please dont stress.We drove for two hours, with me falling in and out of sleep.It was a long boring ride with many highways.When I looked up I noticed we were in a higher class neighborhood.Each house had its own fancy driveway, carved pathway to the door, lights surrounding each lot and the houses were enormous.These houses were bigger than Octavius.I pressed my face against the window and watched the houses slowly crawl by.I noticed a large Victorian house, painted gray and black.A colonial house with blue shutters and tan siding passed along next followed by one made up with a majority of windows, inviting one into their home easily.We pulled along a long road and finally he turned into a driveway.A large gate with something scribbled across the top of it filled my view.He pushed three buttons on the pager and the gates rolled away.Here we are.His voice sounded confident among everything that had just happened.As the car rolled up the driveway a large house appeared among the land.The driveway was at least half a mile long.Lanterns followed the road and it had been recently landscaped.The house itself was twice as big as Octavius.It was a castle that now filled my eyes and I let out a soft gasp.Rising from the ground was a huge rock castle, spires stretching up from the roof.The tips were blue and the castle was a pale gray color.A large door stood in the way of walking into the place.Windows etched with intricate designs were everywhere and I thought I spotted gargoyles on the very top.The car had come to a stop and I realized my mouth was open, gaping at this large castle.And you have been making me live in that puny house!Was the first thing out of my mouth.He simply laughed and pulled me close.His fingers wound in my hair.Im sorry to make you rush out.This is the other home.I told you I had one for children.I smirked and kissed him.So lets get inside and I can tell you the whole mother issue.We made our way into the large house and I couldnt help but feeling like I was in a Disney castle.A large U shaped staircase filled my view as we entered the castle.Chandeliers danced across the ceiling, playing light across the ruby red carpet snaking its way up the stairs.The staircase had black carvings amongst the tan railing.My lips parted in a half awe and Rexs laugh cut through my amazement.What?I asked still slightly grumpy about the whole situation.He smiled and walked away from me.The top of the stairs branched into three rooms and downstairs there were at least seven.He took the first door to the left.I tentatively followed him and noticed we were now in the kitchen.Each room seemed to amaze me more.Brand new appliances were scattered around the kitchen, bright silver among the sky blue walls.He put a black bag on the table and took some things from it.I saw him put a bottle of wine, some bottles of water, a loaf of bread, some sandwich meat and a salad in the fridge.I gingerly slid into one of the bar stools that hugged the table.After he finished he stood, with hand on hip, and looked at me.A smile lit up his face as he looked down at me.Dont give me that look.I crossed my arms across my chest and leaned back against the chair.I let out a soft sigh as he walked over and began rubbing my shoulders.So the mother thing?I asked and he stopped for a minute and then continued without answering my question.I frowned and leaned forward but he pulled me back against him.Dont be like this.He cooed in my ear.Then explain.I responded with a stern voice.I am sick of learning about this shit after the fact.I was fine with the immortal thing, I thought you were going to tell me everything.The sound of defeat filled my voice.Baby, lets eat dinner.Let me show you the house and lets relax.We are safe here.The castle held a very safe feeling against me.There was a west wing and an east wing.The main section of the house had the kitchen, living room, dining room and an office.Each wing mirrored each other with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a master set of each.The night had proceeded as he told it me it would.We had a spaghetti dinner and a bottle of wine.The only thing that didnt go according to plan was when those two big oafs caught me and took me from Rex.He had said we were safe so I had wandered the house and when I stepped into a bedroom on the west wing was when they grabbed me.I could barely see them but I knew it was them, who else could it have been?They put a bag over my head and tied my hands behind my back.All I could remember was them hitting my head and I fell into blackness.Where was my Rex?Why wasnt he saving me?I awoke in a bedroom much like the ones in the castle, which was so named Winthrop Manor.There was a hideous floral print stretched across the walls and even the bed set matched.I pulled myself into a sitting position as quickly as I could, not sure where I was.I looked down at a white shirt and jeans I was now wearing.My hair was free around my shoulders and I pulled it back into a ponytail.I touched my forehead and a searing pain ripped through my head.I noticed there was a small door to the back of the room and figured it was a bathroom.I made my way over and looked into the mirror.There was a large gash that went across half my forehead.It had been stitched though, which had me confused.If someone was keeping me hostage why would they fix up my wound?I heard a knock on the door and looked for something to defend myself with.I stepped out of the bathroom slowly and bit the inside of my lip.Someone was sitting on the bed now.She was draped in black lace, a hat sat atop of her head.I moved my bare feet on the floor quietly but her voice stopped me.Dont even bother.They are outside and can kill you at any moment.I felt my stomach lurch as her voice filled the room.It had a buttery aspect to it but it was laced with a razor blade side.I stood there motionless and looked down at myself.I noticed there was a large cut on my foot and my leg had started to seep blood through the jeans.They will heal.They are just flesh wounds.Her voice rang out again.In one large sweeping motion she now stood in front of me.She was a tall woman, almost six feet I would say, with long black hair that hugged her shoulders.Her face was cold and heartless although.Her eyes were black as night, her pale skin just made them brighter.Her lips were thin pink lines, the only thing with color on her whole face.Her eyelashes were thin along with her eyebrows.Small lines trailed their way from her eyes and lips, suggesting she was aging.She gave me a once over and smiled, her teeth showing only slightly.I felt something in the pit of my stomach and stood up straighter.Well we must get you ready.Ready for what?I asked and she shot me a look.Do not spoke unless you are spoken to.She shot me a look of distaste and let out a couple slow breaths as she regained her composure.We must get you ready to meet people okay?She tried to hold her voice but it wavered at the end.With that she left the room and a small woman walked in.She was wearing a large dress, it looked like one you would wear in the older times, fit with corset and all.She smiled and grabbed a box from a closet I hadnt noticed before.Her hair was piled up on top of her head in many curls.Her hair was blonde, her skin tan and she was skinny as a rail.She opened the box and pulled out a sky blue dress.I had stayed in my spot but now walked over to her.Why am I getting dressed up?I asked her.Her chocolate brown eyes melted as if she was confused someone was talking to her.She shook her head and laid the dress out on the bed.To meet him.I raised an eyebrow at her, trying to keep my eye from the gorgeous dress.Her husband.What?I looked back at her, completely blindsided by this.Yep.Please be careful what you say, he is a God and he has powers still.I groaned and sat down in a chair.Could this get any more fucking confusing?Please miss, we need to get you dressed.I nodded and looked back at the dress.There was a white area that covered my bust and just went a little off my shoulders.Then the dress plunged into the blue, small areas bunched up to make one look slimmer.At the end was another layer of white, popping out from beneath the dress.I pulled away as she tried to help me from my clothes.I got it.I whispered and pulled the jeans and shirt off.I looked down at my body, a yellow bruise lined my left ribs, the two marks on my legs had stopped bleeding but looked horrible.I didnt even noticed the girl leave the room but when she returned she began to bandage the cuts.What is your name?I whispered as she fixed my cuts.Wincing every now and then I looked down at her.Gloria.I came to work here a long time ago.Sorry.She apologized for the pain and I couldnt believe it.She was so nice, how could she stand that bitch who we had met earlier.That bitch is totally Rexs mom!Do you know why I am here?I asked as she put bandages on and I started to pull the dress on.It was large but it did have a princess feel to it.She nodded but didnt speak until I had the dress completed.She wants to know if you are right for her son.She smoothed the dress out and I looked down at myself.I dont know what I felt.I didnt feel beautiful like I did when we had the masquerade ball.I just felt silly.Gloria led me to the vanity and sat me down.She pulled the hair tie from my hair and began brushing it.She is picky, rude and always thinks of herself.Dont talk too much.She spoke with a calm manner.Are you like a maid?I asked quietly, almost instantly regretting it as I felt her shudder against my hair.It is a little more complicated than that I am afraid.She pulled my hair up into an elegant spiral much like her own.My hair was naturally curling around the bun and she simply pinned it in place.She now sat in front of me and did my makeup, concealing the mark on my face completely.I was quite astonished.A soft rap came at the door and she smiled at me.It is time.I stood up and slipped on the shoes she gave me.**    Rex had been writing a long, boring email to his mother about how he would not talk to her when he heard Anyas scream ring out.He dashed away from the computer with pure shock on his face.How did she find them here?Anya?He called out and noticed a flicker of something.He rushed down the hall and one of her shoes had fallen off.Anya!He called again.He took up, running much faster than he ever had before.His heart was pounding in his chest, all he could hear were her groans of protest as they carried her away.He noticed a window opened as they pulled her out.The two big oafs from before.No!He called and ran after them.He jumped through the window and took off on the wet grass towards their car.They were faster however and skidded from the parking lot.No Anya!He spoke breathlessly and put his hands on his knees.No.After a few minutes he had sunk into the grass, still repeating her name.He let out a loud scream, filling the quiet air.In his pocket his phone vibrated and he took it out, looking at the name before throwing it into the grass.He covered his face and rolled onto his stomach.He stopped for a second and got up, climbing his way over to the phone and picked it up.Octavius?Are you there?His rough voice filled the phone.Rex!Where ya been buddy?I need you.Right now.Please.His voice cracked and he sat up.They took her.They took Anya.What are you talking about?Oct asked concerned on the other end.Ill send you the address.Just come now.With that he hung up the phone and texted him the address.He fell back down into the grass and closed his eyes.To see his mother again would be gut wrenching.The last time he had seen her was to show her Krystie.That whole situation didnt work out quite right and now all she wanted was him to get back with her.She didnt understand why he couldnt be with someone who was already immortal.The thing about being with someone who is already immortal is there is no way to show you really love them.He would give up his immortality for Anya, he couldnt do that for Krystie.To be with an immortal was just being immortal.He sighed and could see his breath in the cool night sky.Sir.A soft voice broke his thoughts and at first his body went rigid and then it relaxed.It was the butler, he always showed up randomly.There has been a situation.Your lady friend has been taken and your mother wants you there at 10 am.I hear you have called Octavius.Shall we crack open the lair?Rex could see his face light up without looking up at him.He stood up and hugged the butler even though he just stood still.Lets do this.**    I walked through the house with Gloria by my side.I looked at the paintings that I assumed were done by Rex.They matched his brush strokes perfectly and the amount of color.I missed him terribly.Gloria pulled me to the right of the hallway as a group of oafs as I now called them, walked by.She shook her head and I nodded.They must be her guards or something.We made our way to a large temple looking area.There were large pillars that lined up in a row with a carpet going down the middle.Torches were lit also even though it was daylight out.We stopped for a second and Gloria bowed down.I looked around confused, but did what she did.We then made our way down the long hallway.It was open, outside, so I could feel the breeze.It was cool against this hot dress and I could feel my hair slipping already.I held my hands in front of me for Gloria said not to touch it.If it falls it falls.As we walked I could see what looked like a throne room opening up in front of us.There sat two people, the woman from earlier and a man, with guards on either side.The guards were wearing all black, their heads down and swords at their hip.No way I was getting out of this one easily.As we approached the thrones we bowed and waited for one to speak.Eventually the woman spoke and we stood back up.The man had long black hair that looked identical to the womans.He was wearing what looked like traditional armor but he had a long black cape made from some sort of animal.His face was virtually free of wrinkles but you could tell he was older.His skin was olive and his eyes a dark gray color.So you must be Anya.His voice slid across the room and I looked up at him.
