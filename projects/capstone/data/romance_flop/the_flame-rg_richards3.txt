Now, if we can get back to the pamphlet, I would like to direct your attention to page four  Do you find me attractive?Excuse me?Do you find me attractive?Mary puffs up.She centers herself as she gazes at the pamphlet in her lap.If she didnt look, she would be safe.She shifts.I I I have never thought about it.I am asking you to think about it now.Do you find me attractive?I have never thought about it.I dont judge everyone I meet.She keeps her eyes on the pamphlet.Answer this one question for me and then we can go to page four.Look at me right now and give me an answer.Mary takes a deep breath and exhales, thankful he is seated across from her.Her head fights to stay down but she needs to look to end this topic of conversation.Moments later she wins the battle.She looks at Robert and studies his face so her response will be thoughtful.She doesnt want to give him an excuse to keep going over this same line of questioning.Concentrate, concentrate.You can do this and it will all be over in a flash.You are a handsome man.Now lets turn to page four and begin.Mary rubs her damp hand on her thigh.She opens the pamphlet and talks fast, glad she looked it over before arriving.The page shows the buildings logo and a rendering of what the outside would look like.Robert regards Marys long brown hair and can think of no other word than beautiful.Mary starts her presentation.Your donation will help to get the building constructed from the ground all the way to the outsides completion.We are aware that these are hard times for many people, including the rich, so our priority is to complete the outside in two years and hope the economys recovery has begun for our inside furnishings.If not, a second round of donations completes the project.Mary keeps her eyes on the pamphlet while waiting for a response.Heat rushes across her face to turn it beet red.Her throat goes dry.She swallows trying to breathe easier and appear as if she doesnt have a care in the world.Robert studies her face.Why did I offend you when I called you beautiful?I meant no disrespect.Marys shoulders hunch.She straightens to appear taller, chastising herself for moving.She brushes a strand of hair behind her ear.I was not offended.But your response was as if I had hit or shot you.Can you explain it to me?Be honest I really want to know what I said wrong.How am I going to get out of this?I dont exactly remember what I said.Robert holds up a finger, you said that men always call women beautiful and it is a generic line that works only on the weak.Thank you, she says mockingly.I think I will take that drink now.She needs more time to work out an answer and anything she can do to stall she is going to do.Robert hurries to the small bar.Bourbon, whiskey, or rum.Whiskey, please, on the rocks.Make it a double.Marys heart sinks after giving her answer.Dumb, dumb, dumb.You are letting this man know you are a veteran drinker.Dont be so dumb, girl!She wipes her hands again, they have never perspired this much.When Robert returns, she takes one sip then sets it on the coffee table.She vows not to take another.Men always call women beautiful.It lowers their defenses and makes them easy prey.I dont like beautiful, pretty, or cute.So, it is a personal insult is what you are saying.Not an insult per se, it is more like, not creative or imaginative.Oh, I get it now.You want a man to work for it.You want him to come up with something more unique to show you that he is talking about you and only you.Yes, exactly.She gulps while staring at her drink.So I did insult you earlier.Mary clamps down on her thigh to stop the shake in her leg.To hell with it, she takes another sip.Okay, a little.She curses herself for the sip.She reinstates her vow.I sincerely apologize to you.I am grateful you gave me a chance to apologize for my ignorance.Robert points to the pamphlet.Now this building, where will it be constructed and how many square feet are we talking about?Now, I have to apologize.I dont know the numbers.I can tell you the center will be one of the nations top research institutions and they will bring the best minds here to work on cures.Good.We need something like that here.It will attract more people to this area and be a boom for growth.He decides to ask another question, forgive me but, if you had to describe yourself what words would use or like for others to use?Sorry, that would be insider trading.Mary slips and gives a broad grin then doubles her troubles by looking into his brown eyes.She recovers to find the pamphlet interesting again.How did you know I was in the stock markets?Im sorry I didnt.I just meant it would be inside information.You are talking about information that I could use to manipulate the outcome.That is insider trading at its best.You must play the markets?Mary throws caution to the wind and takes another drink, gulping the rest of her whiskey.No.I guess I remember the term from the news, a lot is going on in the markets.True, but I still want to know the answer to my question.If I were meeting you for the first time, instead of calling you beautiful, what would I call you?He rises to fix himself another drink, would you like another?Yes.I mean, if you are having another.Mary observes Robert from the back to size him up.He is tall, six feet she thinks, wearing black slacks with a light blue shirt.Mary gazes at his rear end: muscular and fit.When he turns she gazes at his athletic chest.She wonders why so many young men his age shave their heads.She gathers her thoughts but doesnt ask the question on her mind.When he returns, she manages only a thin, thank you.Youre welcome, says Robert.And the answer to my question?Im not going to give one.A woman never reveals her weaknesses.Mary sips her drink.Weaknesses, so you are not an infallible robot?Mary laughs.No.Im not.Im far from perfect.May I ask you a personal question?asks Robert.Yes.You dont know me, when I say personal, I mean personal.I might ask you whats your bra size?You know, personal.Mary takes another sip.Nervousness wanes with her new infusion.All right.You can ask me one personal question.Will you answer truthfully?Yes, I will.A dull alarm sounds within her.No matter, she agreed.I was at the club the other night and saw you throw a bottle at a man.Why were you chasing him?What did he do?Marys face turns crimson.The drink slips from her hand to crash against the hardwood floor.She bolts for the door.She flings it open and exits without a word.She searches, yelling, Barb, where are you?Over here.Mary moves toward the direction of the voice.A pounding from her chest makes its way to her throat.She finds it hard to swallow.Her vision blurs, then Barbara and Jerry come into view.Lets go, were leaving.Now!She marches toward the front of the house and salvation.Barbara races for her friend.Whats wrong, Mary?As Mary approaches the front of the house, Roberts voice sails to her.Im sorry.I didnt mean to upset you.I just wanted to know what was going on.Fuck you, motherfucker!Mary yells.She opens the door, hurry up, Barb.Barbara makes it to the car and they leave.What the hell did you do, man?Jerry asks, fanning the dust cloud left in their wake.I asked her why she was chasing that guy with the bottle.Dude, you fucked up.I know.Robert sighs.Thanks anyway.No problem, I got her phone number.We might go out tonight.Hey, maybe I can put in a good word for you.You know how these women like to stick together.Is it worth it?Im not sure yet, maybe.Barbara follows Mary into her office.Some of what her friend said made sense but Barbara still finds the episode confusing.Mary pulls two mini bottles from her desk.They sit and drink.Barbara says, that is not a good reason for you to be so pissed, Mary.My god, you go off over the silliest stuff.I was just getting to know that guy.Can you stop thinking about that man for a minute, Barb.My god, you just met the man two seconds ago, give it a rest will you.Redness rushes into Barbaras face.Instead of screaming, her voice softens, becoming tighter.I know what I like and I go after it; why dont you stop being so prissy and go for what you want.What the hell does that even mean?I know you and I know you like him.You are just running scared as always.You dont know a damn thing about me.And I dont want to know either.Im going back to work, Miss Spinster.Barbara moves toward the door.Mary yells.Go ahead, Miss Slutass.Barbara gives her the finger and slams the door.Mary downs a new bottle, wondering if she should call Mrs.Cartwright.7: The Amazon      That night, after finishing a long day of work at the Belmonta day made longer by slow union workers repairing their broken down air conditionerthe three women walk into Club Calis to blow off some steam.Jills friend told her of the new club opening at the end of Haulover Park.Barbara strolls in wearing a tight almost see thru white top without a braagain.She wears white striped blue shorts that struggle to cover her mammoth backside.Theres a table over there, says Barbara, pointing toward the dance floor.She ushers her friends through the crowd to the table.Jesus, whispers Mary while walking behind her friend.She shakes her head, recounting the times she preached to Barbara about proper dress.It never does any good.Barbaras retort is that she dresses for success and to impress.Mary, not looking to hook up with anyone, dresses conservatively.She wears a large white T shirt and a Miami Dolphins jersey over it.She wears blue jeans and tennis shoes with a big blue purse featuring the Miami Dolphins logo.Most bars serve free mini bottles to first timers and to women on Ladies Night, her large purse makes an excellent carry home bag for the precious items.Marys long brown hair is in a loose ponytail and she dons a dolphins cap.She shakes her head toward her other friend but doesnt commit for Jill dresses equally bad with her double Ds spilling over her low cut red top.If Mary were to guess, Jill and Bert havent worked out their problems as of yet.Hey, Mare, the first rounds on you, says Jill, strutting in wearing her faded extra tight blue jeans.Mary summons the server.Three Hurricanes, please?Barbara yells over the loud music, no way, new club, new drink, lets try something different.She looks at the server.Whats the house special tonight?Harvey Wallbangers.You want to try them?Sure, bring us three, says Mary.Jill rises, craning her neck.Ill be right back.As she walks away, Mary shakes her head.Jills ass jiggles in the tight jeans.Mary frowns.Stop it, says Barbara.You are not going to ruin another night with your shit.We dress the way we want to and that is that.Barbara points to the dance floor, you see anybody you want to dance with?Mary scans the gyrating bodies.They are making fools of themselves.She would never be so vulgar.No.I am just here for my girls.The server returns with the drinks.Nine dollars even.Keep the rest for your tip, says Mary handing her $12.Thanks.The server reaches into her apron and pulls out two bottles.Would you ladies like the Jack or the Crown?Barbara says, Both.Mary adds, if it is ok.Sure, says the server.She graces them with four bottles.You guys have a good night.Mary surreptitiously slides the bottles in her purse.Youve wanted to say it all day, go ahead.Barbara stares through her for a moment.Did you call Mrs.Cartwright?No.Barbara took a sip of her drink.Not bad.She sips again.Are you going to call Mr.Tyler?No.Stop tripping, you have to turn in the money by tomorrow and you know it.Mary runs a finger around the rim of her glass.She takes a long sip.Yeah, I know.Mary, just get it over with and phone him.If you are lucky, he will be out and you will get his machine.Leave a message and you are covered.Do it now.I want to enjoy the rest of this night.She hands Mary her cell phone.Mary takes the phone and searches her purse for the number.She finds it and dials Mr.Tylers home phone.Mary listens with excitement as it rings once, then twice.Hope builds as she listens to a mechanized voice.She sighs.Hello, this is Mary Lake, she blurts.I am calling to remind you of your donation.Please call Mrs.Cartwright tomorrow at 555 2169.Thank you.Mary hangs up the phone.Done.Oh, yeah, party time, says Barbara shaking her head.Lets get on the dance floor and shake it like its hot.Im with you, girl, lets go.Mary downs the rest of her drink.They rush to the floor to dance with each other.Jill comes out of the bathroom and watches the two women dancing.All right, Mare, she yells at Mary.She goes back to the table and finds that her glass is empty.Son of a bitch!She goes over to the bar and orders a pitcher of beer and brings it back to the table.She pours herself a glass and enjoys her drink.The two women come back to the table and Jill asks, Which one of you bitches drank my drink?They laugh and say in unison, she did.They sit, laughing.Jill pours another round.Barbara scans the dance floor while twirling her red hair.She sees a man she likes and heads back to the floor.See you, girls, I think I just saw Mr.Right.You mean Mr.Right Now, says Mary.She and Jill laugh.Barbara gives them the finger before moving toward her new beau.The two women sit for a while and drink.Jill empties the pitcher.She cups her hands around her mouth.Hey, we need another pitcher over here.She mocks Marys scowl.What is the matter with you tonight?You seem out of sorts.Mary shakes her head.Im ok; this might be my last night of freedom if I dont get this old battle ax off my case.You never did tell me, how was that guy you had to see?You mean Mr.Tyler.He was ok after I got to know him a little better.I admit I was wrong about him at first, he is very nice and thoughtful.So what is the problem?Jill leans in to hear better.I dont know.I cant explain what Im feeling.I like him but there is something there that bothers me.Something in the background that I cant get past.You know what I mean?Nope.Hes friendly enough; he actually talks to me which is unusual for a man.He asked me personal questions that you shouldnt ask unless you really know the person.Those sorts of things, I dont know.Its hard to explain.Well, I guess it will work itself out.Lets go dance.Maybe later, you go ahead and keep an eye on Barbara while you are out there.Ill try, says Jill.Mary sits, watching the server approach with another pitcher of beer.Could you bring me another Harvey Wallbanger and a Hurricane?Oh and some pretzels too, please.Ill be right back.The server leaves.Mary downs two each of the Harvey Wallbangers and Hurricanes.While they dance she starts on the second pitcher and is almost finished with her first glass when Barbara returns from the dance floor.Barbara breathes hard from her wild gyrations.Woo, Mary, girl, you are missing it.I was dancing with these two guys that had me pinned in like an ice cream sandwich.Barbara does a dance move from her seated position then pours herself a glass of beer and drinks it down without stopping.Woo, she says and slams the glass back down on the table.That hit the spot, girl.Bitch, you are on the edge.If you do something to fuck this night up Im going to kill your big ass.Mary leers at her not wanting to get into more trouble.Mrs.Cartwright is enough for her.Dont worry, says Barbara, damn!Im going to go back and boogie because you are killing my buzz, bitch.Barbara lets out a scream and dances back to the crowd.She begins grinding on two black guys.Mary smiles surmising the two men must be the guys she mentioned earlier as part of her ice cream sandwich.Mary roars with laughter watching Barbara do her best snake dance.The men move so close you cannot slide a piece of paper between them.They move rhythmically like one big snake.Mary finishes off her drink and keeps watching the ice cream sandwich.A smile spreads across her face.With Barbaras long red hair they look more like a Neapolitan.Barbaras schoolgirl laughter sends waves of joy spiraling throughout her friend.Yes, she is enjoying her freedom from work.Jill ventures back to the table breathing hard.Mare, what is your hang up tonight?Jill gulps like Barbara had done earlier.Oh Jesus, that is some good shit!She stares at Mary.Forget that guy and find you one here, Ill help you look.Whats your fancy tonight?Mary smiles and pours herself another drink.Im good; I just want to watch my girls have a good time.Bitch, Im older than you.You are the baby of the bunch, shit.Let me hook you up with somebody.How about that guy over there in the green shirt?Jill points to a young man on a barstool.Mary chuckles.College kids?If I wanted a fucking baby I would get pregnant and change shitty diapers all night.The two women laugh.Come on Mare, you look depressed.Im fine Mrs.Jill Joy.Marys smile doesnt quite reach her eyes.I know when you start doing that to just leave you alone and let you stew in your own juices.Ill be on the dance floor getting mine.Jill stands, does a shake then wanders back into the gyrating crowd.Marys heart seizes as she watches Barbara leave the dance floor.She trips over her own feet and falls to the floor.Im all right, Im all right, Mary says to a couple that helps her to her feet.These god damn rugs can kill a motherfucker up in here!She screamed at a server who comes over to help.Mary sits back down in her chair, forgetting why she rose: Barbara.She scans the crowd.Jill is there slow dancing with another woman but no Barbara.She scans again then returns to the blonde with a mans short crew cut who has her head buried between Jills mountains.Her hands cup Jills ass as they slow dance in one spot.Mary shakes her head in disgust.Poor Bert.The woman turns her head to the side but keeps her head firmly attached to Jill while they continue to slow drag.Mary sees a hoop earring in her nose and a tattoo under her eye.Mary takes another drink and scans once more for Barbara.She turns her gaze back to Jill in time to catch them deep French kissing.The two saunter to Marys table hugging each other.A woman sits at the bar watching the happy couple.She leaves her barstool to intercept them.Hey, bitch, she says to Jill with a heavy Spanish accent.Jill turns.What the fuck are you doing with my woman?Jill glares at the tall heavyset woman, unafraid.Fuck off, punta.Then she turns to go to her table with her new playmate.The enraged woman walks up behind Jill and kicks her in her lower back, pushing her forward.Take that you fucking skank.Mess with my bitch and you will get more than that you trailer trash motherfucker.She grabs her girlfriend by the arm and they turn to leave.Jill leaps to her feet with a scowl.Not today, motherfucker.Not today!Jill releases an ear piercing scream and charges the woman.A crowd gathers, whipping out cell phones to snap pictures and record the action.One girl holding a red cell phone says, This will look good on my Facebook page.She high fives another girl.Jill and the woman tumble.The crowd circles with shouts of, fight, Fight, FIGHT!Jill is the first to rise with crowd infused energy, she strikes the woman across the jaw.The woman hits the floor and then rolls unto her stomach before rising again.She hits Jill in the stomach as Jill comes in to land another punch.Jill doubles over but stays on her feet.The woman then lets out a scream and punches Jill squarely in the back of her head.Lights out.The woman spits on her carcass then curses her in Spanish.She grabs her prize and leaves.Mary wobbles over to Jill.Barbara arrives moments later to a half conscious Jill and frantic Mary.With no time to spare, they get on either side of Jill, pick her up, and drag her out of the club before security arrives.Where the fuck were you two while I was getting my ass kicked by that goddamn Amazon bitch?asks a staggering Jill.She limps down the street between the two women.Keep quiet and stop crying like a bitch, says Mary.You are going to stay at my place tonight so Bert doesnt find out.With any luck the swelling will be gone by then.She beat the holy living shit out of you, girl, says Barbara.Thats what happens when you mess with other peoples property, scolds Mary.Fuck off!Jill stubs her toe and shrieks.She hops away from her friends then turns.Why didnt you help me?I wasnt about to get my ass kicked, says Mary.Hell, I think that bitch knew karate.She and Barbara laugh as the three girls climb into a cab to go home.8: Strip Duty      Tuesday evening:      Robert and Jerry ogle stage acts from their perched table off the main stage.Jerry whispers to Robert as a stripper wearing a teal g string saunters toward them.Would either of you gentlemen like a lap dance?Maybe, says Jerry.He arches his brows.What kind are you offering?A sinful smile spreads across her face.Hands off only out here, but if you go back to the Champagne Room with me, who knows.Maybe later, honey, says Jerry.After seeing her downturned face, his brows arch once more.What the hell.Ill take a lap dance right here.Come to papa.He slides his chair back a little and motions the stripper to him.Jerry moves with her during her five minute show.Unable to entice him into the back, she collects her reward and strolls to the next table to try her luck there.Love in a g string, Yee Haw!Roberts glare silences Jerrys dance.You are supposed to be helping me get at this woman.No more dances, man, I need some help here.Relax, man, I got you covered.I dont understand why you are so hung up on this chick.Yeah, she has a rack on her but get real, man, she is just average.This one can be special; I get a good feeling every time we talk.I just need a way in.A little help would be appreciated.Jerry rolls his eyes.The mommas boy speaks.Just buy her something.Let her know you are loaded and she will come knocking.Great strategy, Jerr.I see why the ladies come running.Fuck you, man.That was a low blow.Every woman is not Jenny.Find someone real.I have got real, right there on that stage.Besides, you got the same problem and dont even know it.Jerry stands and showers the gyrating beauty on stage with a handful of singles.You are wasting your life.Believe me, there is going to come a time when you regret it all.Hey, I set the price from now on.Jerry chugs from his fourth drink then slams the glass on the table spilling whats left.No bitch is getting me by the balls ever again.I set the price in this motherfucker.And if memory serves, the bitchs friend rolled yo ass at the same fucking  A glare silences every thought in his alcohol liquefied brain.Robert grabs his drink.Jerry trails him to a different stage to watch an Asian stripper loosen her top.After a long drink and a hard stare, Robert fixes a stoic expression to a tired face.I recovered.Tell it to somebody who doesnt know you.The soft spoken words sting.I need something more than this, and so do you.This is good for temporary fun but I have had it with all this bullshit.I want a woman who is there for me and doesnt cost a dime.The girl catches their attention when she drops down and spreads her legs wide.Robert pulls out a wad of singles.He hands half to his friend and makes it rain with the rest.Take it off girl, take it off, yells Jerry.He ignores what Robert has said and knows that he has the good life already.The stripper brings her legs together and takes off her bottoms and puts them on Jerrys head.Jerry sniffs them and puts them in his pocket.She then leans in to kiss him.Jerry deepens his voice.I want you in the Champagne Room, Ill be waiting.Jerry and Robert go back to their table and have another drink.If you are staying, man, Im going home.I have had enough of these girls.Im staying, man, shes mine.Jerry smiles and hands Robert his drink.You have fun.Here, take the rest of this, Robert hands him the rest of his cash and finishes his drink.He heads out the door with a wave.When Robert makes it home he goes to his answering machine to check his messages.He takes off his shirt and goes into the kitchen for leftovers.He listens to different messages from different people as he brings his plate back into the living room and sets it on the coffee table.
