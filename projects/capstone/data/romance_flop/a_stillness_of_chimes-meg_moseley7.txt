I have a favor to ask.Laura made her voice bright and cheerful.Sean is so paranoid about prowlers, its ridiculous.Hes sticking to me like glue.Playing bodyguard.Lucky girl.Hes one cute bodyguard.Hes one busy luthier.He needs to be in his shop, doing prep work for the weekend.Whats to do?He only needs to show up at his booth and flash that adorable smile at the ladies, and hell sell instruments like hotcakes.Theres a little more to it than that.And would you please stop trying to make him sound soso Gorgeous and sweet and sexy?Cassie.Stop it.Cassie laughed.Okay, okay.Whats the favor?If Im here, hell insist on being here too.Can I hang out at your house today?And spend the night?Or is that a problem, given your moms situation?Not a problem.Shes pretty darned normal most of the time.Come on over, anytime.Thanks.Maybe Ill bring some of my moms papers to sort through.Good idea.Bring enough busywork so my mom wont draft you to help with her eternal scrapping.Cassie yawned.Well have a sleepover tonight.Ill see ya when you show up.Ill be there soon.Laura closed her phone, pleased with herself for having told the truth but not the whole truth.Cassie didnt need to know about the man at the window.Not yet.Throwing off the remnants of sleep, Sean raised his head and frowned at the quilt on his chest.He couldnt comprehend how it got there.Something poked his side.Rise and shine, bodyguard.Youve been sleeping on the job.He blinked.Laura came into focus, sitting on the couch with her big toe prodding his ribs.Shed changed to jeans and a sleeveless white shirt.The outfit reminded him of long, hot days, fishing on Hamlin Lake before it had become the scene of a tragedy.Before shed moved to Denver, where she turned pale in the wintertime.He wanted her to move back, to go fishing with him and get her fishermans tan backexcept shed insist on sunscreen for both of them.He seized her foot.Sorry, but thats the kind of service a client gets when she doesnt pay her bodyguard one red cent.Her foot escaped his grasp.The coffees free, though.You want some?Yeah.Ill make it.Why do you always insist on making it?You make it too strong.Wimp, she said.Her smile wasnt quite genuine.And no wonder, after the bomb shed dropped on him in the middle of the night.But if she didnt want to talk anymore about her mom and Gibby, neither did Sean.Hed rather not even think about it.He rose, dropped the quilt on the couch, then picked up his gun and placed it on top of Jesss tall, thirty year old television cabinet that hadnt held a TV in years.In the kitchen, he pulled the coffee out of the cupboard.He filled the lid of the coffee grinder with beans and dumped them into the hopper.But the grinder was obstinate.He picked it up and shook it.This thing has a short in it somewhere.He pressed the button again, and it decided to work.He faced Laura, his mind swimming with ideas about security lights, alarms, peepholes in the doors.We need a plan.Ive got one.Part of one, anyway.Ill spend the day at the Brights house.The night too.Then you wont feel like you have to baby sit me.The knot of tension inside him began to unwind.Good idea.Im already packed, and Cassies expecting me.She says well have a sleepover.I guess shell want to watch movies and eat junk food.Excellent, he said, already starting to tune out the rest.As the coffee brewed, he made his plans.With Laura safe and sound at the Brights place, hed be free to take care of business.She poured coffee for both of them, putting hers in a travel mug, and regarded him with a solemn expression.While Im gone, she said softly, if anybody shows up, whether its my dad or someone else, I dont want any guns.Understand?Sean hesitated, picturing himself face to face with an intruder.Keith had learned in the service that if somebodys aiming at you, you dont mess around.It aint Hollywood, Keith said.Aim to killor be killed.The guy at the window probably wasnt your dad, Laura.Understand?You have no way of knowing that.But heres the bottom line.My dads safety is my top concern.Dont be trigger happy, just in case its him.Do you understand?Sean was silent.As far as he knew, Elliott had never hurt anybody except the time he blew up at Gary and the time he decked Dale.Maybe the fact that Gibby lived in Nashville had saved him.Laura took a step closer.Sean, I know youre safety conscious, but accidents happen.You dont want to accidentally shoot Dale either, do you?He chuckled.Now that you mention it Thats not funny.Promise me.No guns.No guns while youre gone, he said with a sigh.You mean it?I mean it.But when she came back, that was a different story.And dont go around telling people what happened last night.Remember, I dont want the sheriffs department to get involved.I cant tell law enforcement no guns.Sean considered her request.He was willing to get the law involved if Lauras safety was at stake, but not just to track down rumors.Shed be perfectly safe at the Brights house.And he would find a way to make her stay longer than overnight.Youre right, he said.I wont tell anybody.Okay, then.Im off.And dont you dare baby sit the house all day.She tapped his chest with her forefinger.Sean Michael Halloran, up and coming luthier, doesnt have time to moonlight as a house sitter.The festival starts on Friday.Fridays just the warmup, remember?I wont open my booth until Saturday morning.And Saturday will be here before you know it.Go home and get to work.He was already making a mental list of the tools hed pick up.His phone too.He couldnt live without his phone.Yes maam, he said.Finally, she smiled.Good boy.She picked up Mikey and kissed the top of his head.You be a good boy too.Dont run off.Sean moved closer.I should stick my head between you and the cat so youll kiss me by accident.You might even like it.I promise I dont have fleas.Neither does Mikeyand he never bosses me around.She rubbed her face against Mikeys and set him on the floor.But Im a better kisser than Mikey, Sean said.I have real lips.Im sure you remember them.Like I remember yours.Her cheeks turned pink, but she didnt answer.She slung the handles of a small overnight bag over her shoulder and crouched to pick up a cardboard file box that looked a little too heavy for her.Let me get it, whatever it is.Its Moms papers to sort through, she said in a matter of fact tone that belied the blush on her face.Itll give me something to do while I listen to Ardelles chitchat.Good luck with that.He nudged her out of the way and took charge of the box.She headed toward her moms SUV instead of her own car.Shed already put For Sale signs in the windows.He followed, hobbling barefoot across the sharp gravel.While Laura climbed behind the wheel, he put the box in the back of the SUV and shut the door.The vehicle had been kept in the garage since shortly after Jess died, and old, dried marks from the wiper blade still made a gray peacocks fan on the dirty glass of the rear window.The last time she drove to town, it must have been a rainy day.Her last day to run errands.Bye, Laura called, using that matter of fact tone again.Bye.Be good.You too.She started the engine and then leaned her head out the window.Thanks for staying with me.Im glad you called.Picking his way back over the gravel, Sean remembered finding that secondhand SUV for Jess.Shed wanted something reliable to last ten years or so.Hed kidded her about ditching her old minivan because she was tired of the soccer mom image that came with it.Shed joked about wanting to be a soccer grandma one day.He pictured three or four redheads playing soccer.Riding their bikes.Bouncing on a trampoline, screaming, having a ball.Maybe one of them would be a little girl dragging a doll along everywhere she went.Lord willing, someday hed be the kind of father who would teach a kid how to fly a kite or swing a hammer or play a guitar.The kind of father who gave hugs.The kind of father who couldnt make a kid cower in a corner just by looking at him.On the steps, he brushed gravel from the soles of his feet and looked up in time to see the SUV disappear around the bend.He blew out a long sigh of relief.Laura was safe.He wondered what he would do if their trespasser had a gun.Especially if he proved to be Elliott after all.Sean couldnt imagine firing at a broken down wreck of a man, but he couldnt picture Elliott that way.Hed always been a lithe, strong outdoors man with a quick smile.Hed had a simple tattoo on one muscular forearm, the lettering vaguely Celtic in style.The two words looked as if theyd been lifted from the middle of a sentence because they werent capitalized: life everlasting, with the tail of the g curving into the purple vein on his wrist.Elliott had never volunteered anything about the significance of the tattoo, and Sean had never asked.Slowly, he walked inside.Life everlasting was all well and good, but he had to focus on the here and now.Hed start with a trip to the hardware store.Laura was about to lower the file box to the Brights doorstep so shed have a hand free to use the shiny brass door knocker, but the door swung open.Cassie stood there in a tank top and cutoffs, her hair turbaned in a pale yellow towel.She took the box, leaving Laura with nothing to carry but her purse and the overnight bag.Come on in, Cassie said.Lets go back to my room.Well, its the guest room.I dont exactly have my own room here.Wheres your mom?On the phone with Tig.Laura followed Cassie across travertine tiles to the living room, where the funeral plants were still clustered around the fireplace, then down the hall to the plush white carpet of a sunny bedroom.The walls were an even softer shade of the towels yellow.The bed linens and the curtains were tastefully subdued but almost too well coordinated with each other.Very nice, Laura said, taking it in.Just like the rest of the house.I feel like Ive stepped into a decorating magazine.Yeah, it makes me feel like a peon.We live in the tiniest, ugliest apartment ever.Youll have to come see us sometime so you can feel superior.Aw, rats.Here comes my mom already.Ardelle stuck her head in.Is that Laura I hear?Hey, honey.Its so good to see you.Are you doing all right?Most of the time.Oh, I know its hard.Your mom was the sweetest soul.She and your dad loved each other so much.Ardelle came closer, twisting her hands together.Well never know what he went through in the war, but she was so good to him even when he had his moods.She never even looked at another man after he drowned.Laura only nodded, keeping her expression neutral, although her heart felt like a battlefield.Itd be such a shame if its true that hes alive, now that its too late because shes dead Mom, Cassie scolded.Dont be insensitive.Youre about to make Laura cry.But wouldnt it be wonderful if hes alive?Tig says old Mrs.Gustafson is spreading stories about seeing him on the road by their house.Lauras heart thumped.When?Ardelle waved the question away with her plump hand.Oh, I didnt ask for details.You know I dont like to meddle in other folks business.Mother dear, Cassie said firmly, you are the biggest meddler and gossip I know.I am not.You let yourself into Lauras house a few days ago without permission, didnt you?Laura put her hand on Cassies arm.Stop, Cassie.Let it go.But Cassie was on a roll.And you let the cat get out, Mom.He could have been hit by a car.Ardelle hung her head.I was only trying to help.Its called breaking and entering, Cassie snapped.Jess gave me a key!I was her most trusted friend.Ardelles eyes filled with tears.Laura, you asked me to feed the cat and all, and now youre calling me a thief?No, Laura said gently.Nobodys calling you a thief.Its just that I dont need your help anymore, now that Im in town.Well, I never!You asked for my help.Ardelles chin quivered.If you dont want me in your mothers home, I dont want you in mine.She flounced out of the room.Laura stared at the empty doorway.What had happened to warm hearted, fun loving Ardelle?I dont believe it, Cassie said.The drama mama is kicking you out.She flopped onto the bed, flinging one arm over her face in a fake swoon.Lets ignore her awhile and see what happens.No.Not when shes this upset.Id better not stay.Cassie lifted her arm just enough so she could peer at Laura.Youre abandoning me?Sorry, but youre the one who got her riled up, so youre the one who gets to calm her down.Dont be too hard on her, though.She might not want to behave the way shes behaving.I know, Cassie said mournfully.She sat up on the bed.It was really weird, wasnt it?Really unlike her.I hate to worry Dad, but Id better tell him.He absolutely needs to know.Ill call you later and see how shes doing.Laura gathered the things shed brought and headed out again.Shed stay away for a while.Ardelles comments had hurt.But there was no time for tears.Driving back to town, Laura tried to remember exactly where the Gustafsons lived.With a little luck, shy Mrs.Gustafson might be home alone and able to describe exactly what she saw, without any interference from her bossy husband.Sean hit the brakes, approaching the long curve by Jesss house.Lauras house, now, but probably not for long.A dollar to a doughnut, shed put it on the market and head back to Denver.Hed move there too, if he thought she might want his company.It was nearly noon.That gave him time to finish by dark.He was still waiting for a call back from a security company, but hed already picked up everything he could install himself.If he could talk Laura into staying with the Brights until everything blew over, maybe his precautions werent even necessary.But they couldnt hurt.The house came into viewand Jesss SUV stood in the driveway, bold as brass.The vehicle Laura had driven away in.There she was, at the edge of the road.In one hand, she carried a big plastic pitcher like the kind his mom had always used for mixing up Kool Aid.In the other hand, she carried a tall tin vase.Either not noticing him or ignoring him, Laura hurried across the road, her hair somewhat tamed by the black and white bandanna shed adopted as her own.Surefooted as a kid, she started up the steps set into the grassy bank.Sean parked behind the SUV.Leaving his purchases in the truck and feeling like a paranoid fool, he followed her across the road.He didnt expect any trouble on a bright, sunny afternoon, with the pastors car parked in the lot, but he wasnt letting her out of his sight.And he was glad to have his phone in his pocket again, just in case.A mourning dove burst out of the dogwood by the Gantt family plot as Laura slowed and stopped there.She set both containers on the ground and twisted her hands behind her back, her head bowed.Not wanting to intrude on her privacy, Sean waited at a distance and looked around the cemetery.Bushes and small trees had been planted beside other graves too.Some of the headstones were tipping.Some had fallen.Some were covered with lichen and darkened with age.Jesss grave, though, was all too recent and still unmarked by a headstone, and the bronze plaque that bore Elliotts name still gleamed as if it were new.He eyed the jungle of vines that backed the graveyard.A day at a time, an inch at a time, the mass of green crept forward, slashed back annually by a small army of men from the church and browned every winter by the first frost.The churchs weathered picnic pavilion stood on one side of the property, the cemetery lay on the other, and the church stood in the middle, dividing life from death.Keeping them at arms length.The life sidepicnics, parties, supper on the grounds.The death sidefunerals, headstones, bones.But all those crosses didnt mean a thing if death wasnt the doorway to eternal life.He looked back at Laura.Her coppery hair spilled down her back from beneath the bandanna, bright as a new penny in the sun.Shed always stood out in a crowd like a redbird in a flock of sparrows.She reached into the pitcher and pulled out clippers, then walked to a mass of pink azaleas that bordered the church property.Working quickly, she gathered an armload of long branches bursting with blooms.The hedge was so full, nobody would notice shed cut some.Tired of waiting, he moved a step closer.Laura, he called in the no nonsense tone he used on Keiths boys when they tried to pull a fast one.She turned to face him.Hey, Sean.I thought you were staying at the Brights place.She waved it away.Long story.Anyway, I thought you were going to work.Why did you come back?Im installing some new locks and so on.But you wont be here overnight, will you?Yes, I will.Ardelle got pretty upset with me.She thinks I accused her of being a thief.Did you?Of course not.I was a little irritated with her because shed let herself in one day when I wasnt home, but Cassie made a federal case of it and things escalated.Lets just say Ardelle isnt the same old fun loving Ardelle I remember from years ago.Stay at my house, then.No, Sean.Thank you.His jaw tightened as she returned to the family plot, where she filled the tin container with azalea branches and placed it at her moms grave.She walked to the nearest faucet, filled the pitcher, and came back to pour water into the vase.No flowers for Elliott, of course.She believed he was alive.There, she said, putting the clippers in the empty plastic pitcher.Now it doesnt look so abandoned.So lonesome.The almost imperceptible trembling of her voice prompted Sean to take a closer look at her.You okay?Not really.I justwell, yesterday morning I was so upset about that stupid note in Moms drawer that I deleted her number from my phone and I used up the last of the blackberries on purpose, and now I see how petty and mean spirited that was and I want to tell her Im sorry, but shes not here.She stopped to take a breath.So Im putting flowers on her grave, but it doesnt do any good.Sounds like youre having a rough day, he said cautiously.She made a face.Ive crammed a lot of craziness into one morning.After I left Ardelles I checked out a rumor about a prowler The Gustafsons?I heard that one too.Turned out to be their neighbor.She nodded sadly.So that was a wild goose chase.Then I didnt know where to go.Ardelle doesnt want me there, and you dont want me here.So I went to the cabin.Sean tensed, not liking the idea at all.Why the cabin?She studied the ground.Youll think this is stupid, but on Friday I left some food and clothes there for my dad.Theyre gone.Oh, Laura.Anybody could have taken them.She raised her chin.I know, but it didnt do any harm to leave them there.Sean moved closer.Dont go back alone, though.We dont know who might be hanging around.We still dont know who was at your window last night either, or what he was up to.If its not a good time to stay at the Brights house, you can stay at mine.Then your nighttime visitor wont know where to find you.Dont you understand?I want him to find me.Not if its a stranger, you dont.A criminal.Please, be reasonable.Im being perfectly reasonable, she said sweetly.Youre the one who isnt.She looked both ways for traffic and ran back to the house with her plastic pitcher.That was her idea of being reasonable?Thoroughly exasperated with her irrational decisions, he followed slowly.After shed gone inside, he glanced over his shoulder, wondering if someone might have been watching them from the far side of the cemetery.In the noonday sun, the azaleas were such a vivid pink that they didnt look real.He stopped at his truck to retrieve his tools and the bags from the hardware store.He sorted out his purchases, found one of the new locksets, and sat down on the porch with the front door open so he could remove the old lock.Laura walked up behind him.If you have to sit there with the door wide open, Id better lock Mikey in the bathroom.Thanks.I forgot about Mikey.But I wish you cared about your own safety as much as you care about his.Hes just a cat.If its his day to die, its his day to die.Laura cornered Mikey a few feet from the door and scooped up a writhing armful of resentful feline.Today isnt that day.She carted Mikey away.Sean heard the soft plop as she deposited the cat on the bathroom floor, and then the click of the latch as she shut him in.She came back, her face solemn.I do appreciate everything youre doing, Sean.Really, I do.Thank you.You need to let me know what I owe you for the locks and all.But as soon as youve finished, you need to hole up in your shop and finish those instruments.You want to see some of them on stage in Nashville someday, remember?Not as much as he wanted to see them in the hands of children.Children with his last name and Lauras red hair.But that would never happen if he couldnt keep her safe.In a little while, maybe Ill run home and bring back some projects to work on, he said.You can come with me.Wont I be safe behind the new deadbolts?In broad daylight?He shrugged and went back to work.Oh no, she said.You know what I just realized?What?The new locks will make it look like I really think Ardelles a thief.She sighed.Id better call Cassie and see if her mom has calmed down at all.She retreated into the depths of the house, leaving Sean alone with his worries.Her mothers morning freak out had left Cassie drowning in guilt.It was her fault for coming down so hard on her.The sharp knife hit the cutting board in a steady rhythm as Ardelle made exquisitely thin tomato slicesfar more than she needed for only two sandwiches.They were going to be awesome sandwiches, though.Cassies folks didnt eat cheapo white bread anymore.Now they could afford whole grain bread from the bakery and expensive, thin sliced meats from the deli.Deli cheese too, and fancy mustard.The kind that cost four bucks for a four ounce jar.That was sixteen dollars a pound.Her mom had been fussing with the sandwiches for at least ten minutes, but finally she was satisfied.She sliced them on the diagonal, placed them on pretty plates, and started garnishing the plates with gourmet bread and butter pickle slices.Cassies cell phone rang.Shed expected a call back from Drew, but it wasnt his ring tone.It was Lauras.Mom, Ive got a call.Go ahead and start eating without me.All right, sweetie, her mom said.Tell Drew hey for me.Cassie walked to the far side of the sunroom and looked out over the glittering turquoise of the pool.Sup?she said softly.Hi, Laura said.I just wanted to check in.Is your mom still upset?Not really.Now shes being super sweet, like she feels terrible about overreacting.I feel terrible about it too, but it mightve been good that it happened, you know?She might wake up and realize she needs some help.I hope so.Everything okay over at your place?Pretty much, yes.Seans changing the locks, but it has nothing to do with keeping your mom out.It was his idea, in case my prowler comes back.Hes such a great guy.Sos Keith.Their mom must have been a good influence on them before she died, because theyre not a bit like Dale.Enough, Laura said firmly.Right.Cassie turned toward the kitchen.Now her mom seemed to be rearranging the stacks of pickles on the plates.You wouldnt believe how long it took my mom to make a couple of sandwiches just now, she said softly.Shes still fiddling with them.Its insane.Nobody is one hundred percent sane.Lauras voice wavered.Aw, Laura.You sound like you need a shoulder to cry on.If you try to point me toward Seans shoulder, I will hang up on you.All right, all right.Are you okay, though?Really?Im sorry I snapped at you.Im just so tired.Once everything calms down, Ill want to make sure everythings okay between your mom and me.Bye.Okay.Ill keep you posted.But Laura had already ended the call.She never ended a call so abruptly.She must have been about to start crying.She wasnt the only one.Cassies insides were a muddle of worries.She wanted Drew to help her sort things out, but he was so tied down to his business that she couldnt keep him on the phone long enough for a meaningful conversation.He cared.Of course he cared.He was just too busy to talk to his wife.Her dad had been too busy for his wife too, for years.If all entrepreneurs were that way, Sean would be too busy for Laura.Theyd be better off without each other.Give up on the matchmaking, Cassie whispered.Marriage wasnt all it was cracked up to be.Sniffling a little, she practiced a happy face for her mothers benefit and walked back inside.It was only late afternoon but Laura was so short on sleep that she could have sworn it was midnight.She and Sean had eaten an early supper because theyd both forgotten to eat lunch.Finished with the cleanup, which meant throwing away paper plates and a pizza box, she peeked out the kitchen window.Sean stood at the porch railing, looking up at the mountains.After a nearly windless day, a healthy breeze streamed through the gap, playing with his wild man hair that lay straight and long on his collar.His shirt nearly matched the shade of his faded jeans.Hed stood there a long time.Either he expected to see her dad stroll out of some little hollow, or he thought it was a good spot to play bodyguard.He took the role seriously.Except for a quick trip to pick up the pizza and to grab a few things from his house, hed stayed all day, obsessing over the locks and the security lights while she sorted her moms belongings.Blocking Mikeys escape route with her foot, Laura stepped onto the porch.She hoped the stiff wind would blow itself out before dark.She didnt want to spend another night with her imagination making footfalls out of every gust and her dads voice out of every scraping branch.Sean hummed some sad tune as he studied the mountains.Shed always loved to watch him when he was wrapped up in a song, his eyes dreamy.She could have stood there all night, listening.He had always been there for her.Hed stuck up for her, from the playground in primary school to the halls of the high school.Sure, he tried to act like he was her bossthen and nowbut that went both ways.In spite of their eternal power struggle, they would always be friends.Maybe they could be more than friends again, someday.Somewhere far from Dale.She recognized the melody Sean was hummingan old Scots ballad about crows watching a man die in the wilderness.It had been funny in a macabre way when her dad sang it, years ago.Now?Not so much.Thats a gruesome song, she said.Yeah.Sorry.He looked at her, looked at her hard.Are you all right?Yes.Go on home, Sean.Nothing has happened all day, and nothings going to happen all night.Ill be fine, especially now with the new locks and the security lights.Im staying.Deal with it.Laura didnt argue.Deep inside, she didnt want to be alone.She joined him at the railing.Scanning the hills, she imagined her dad home again.She could almost remember his voice.Almost.Whats wrong?Sean asked.Drat him.He read her too easily.It has been kind of a tough day, she said.And maybe its just because Im so tired, but I cant seem to get Dads face out of my mind, but I cant quite remember him either.Not clearly.Not his face, not his voice.Its all muddy.I know what you mean.And its like my heart is divided.One part hopes I can have him back.The other part is afraid I cantor Ill have him back but hell be too changed.Sean only nodded, leaving her to sort out her fears in silence.Even if her dad was alive, even if he came back, he might be beyond mending.He might as well have died.Yet she still hoped.Fear and hope.Like tectonic plates, those opposing forces shoved against each other, building pressure.Something had to give.Let him go, said one voice in her head.Hes gone already.Another voice said: Hang on.Keep the faith.Keep believing.It was like straddling a fault and waiting for an earthquake to hit.On one side of the fault, her dad still lived and was, somehow, fixable.Could be restored to his old life.Could be loved and comforted, at least.On the other side lay a plane where shed never have her dad backat least not the way shed known him.But she couldnt decide which side of the fault to stand on, and she couldnt arrange the outcome, anyway.She could only try to brace herself for the coming cataclysm.I know you must cry in private sometimes, Sean said matter of factly.You can cry in front of me too, honey.She let out a puny laugh.You really want me to cry, dont you?You think it would be therapeutic.Yes maam.Would you just shut up and cry, please?Stop fighting it.Im not fighting anything.Youre fighting a normal reaction to all the stress youre under.Youve lost your mom, you want to believe your dad is back, and now youre dealing with your moms indiscretions.Alleged indiscretions, that is.Then theres your trespasser My dad isnt a trespasser, Sean.This is his house.Laura, at some point you might have to face the fact that he really isnt back, cant come back, ever.Suddenly shed decided where she stood.Thats not a fact.Its an opinion.I believe hes alive, and I believe hes not beyond help.Sean had no quick comeback this time.His expression had changed in some subtle way, as if hed tuned her out.Listen, he said abruptly.Thats it.Thats the hole in the night.What are you talking about?When I drove over at three in the morning, I noticed but I didnt understand.Just listen.Then tell me what you hear.A distant siren, miles away.Birds.The wind, rushing through millions of green leaves and brown branches.Laura held her breath.Something was missing.She didnt hear the random music that had always sung along with the wind.Something had stilled her mothers wind chimesor someone had taken them.Only one person on earth would want those wind chimes.Giddy with fear and hope, she turned toward Sean.Hes back.Hes really back.Sean didnt answer, but she saw the doubt in his eyes.He opened his arms and drew her close.They had chosen different sides.Different tectonic plates.She clung to him anyway, while the wind ran around the little house like water around a boulder in a stream.Sean stood in the living room and studied the rope hed taken down from the little magnolia tree.The rope was thin, brown, discolored by years in the weather.It ended in a fresh cut, delivered by a sharp instrument.The center of the rope was white and clean.Who would have gone into the backyard to cut down Jesss wind chimes?If the house stood in town, close to other homes, a difficult neighbor might fuss about the noise and cut down the chimes out of spite.Out here, though, nearly in the country, with lots of room between houses?Nobody had ever cared.Elliott had given them to Jess one Valentines Day, long before he disappeared.Lauras theory was that Elliott had taken them.Sean wasnt inclined to agree with her, but whoever it was, hed used a very sharp knife.He was probably the same man shed seen at her window.That was the night the new silence had started, but Sean hadnt realized the chimes were gone until tonight.He moved toward the couch, careful not to wake her.Even after their unsettling discovery, exhaustion had caught up with her.At least shed eaten a little.Not much, though.He wished Elliotts old hound dog was still around to eat the leftovers.Geezer was long gone, though.After a couple of weeks of moping for his vanished master, the dog had disappeared too.Fighting off the image of Elliott at the edge of the woods, whistling softly for his dog, Sean crouched beside Laura.He brushed a lock of hair off her cheek.She didnt react.He straightened.He had to talk things over with his brotheron the porch, so his voice wouldnt wake her.But the sensor had already kicked the security lights on, and hed feel like he was on stage.An easy target.At the back door, he hit the switch that killed those too bright lights.Instantly, it was a normal twilight.He walked onto the porch and around the side where he could see across the road.In the fading light, the azaleas in the tall tin vase looked more purple than pink.From this angle, looking across the hillside, the graveyard was like a little cityscape, the gravestones its skyscrapers and towers.The plots, divided by cement curbs, were city blocks.Even the flowers decorating the graves fit into the scene, looking like flowering shrubs beside the towers.A city of the dead.A city that awaited another new citizen.Someone was going to die.The notion settled on him like a blanket of ice.A premonition, he would have called it, if hed believed in such things.But everyone was going to die, someday.It was only a matter of time.Tonight, though, or tomorrow or next week, it had better not be Laura.He wanted to see her live to play with their grandchildren.Their great grandchildren too, if they didnt waste too much time.He walked toward the far end of the porch.The side that looked out on mountains instead of graves.He settled into the chair, pulled out his phone, and tried to collect his thoughts.He had to swear Keith to secrecy and bring him up to date.He shouldnt get involved unless he knew the whole story and what a mess it was.Adultery maybe and lies maybe.And maybe thered even been some bloodshed early on, if that car in the lake meant anything.The conversation proved to be even harder than hed anticipated.Keith blasted him.All this is going on, and you havent called the sheriff?Sean, thats flat out irresponsible.Laura has her reasons for wanting to keep the law out of it.Does she have a better answer than the law?We just want to find Elliott before somebody else does.If hes alive, that is.Stop saying if, okay?Were going to play a little game of Lets Pretend.Pretend hes alive.He doesnt want to be found, obviously.Even if hes close to town, we could search for months and never find a trace of himunless we get into his head.Sean fell silent, trying to drop his skepticism and be a willing believer.Just for a while.Where would Elliott hide?How close to town?Where would he feel at home?At his boyhood home.The old cabin.Out of town, but not too far.It was a falling down wreck, but Elliott could create a shelter out of nothing.I think the cabin makes sense, Sean said.I do too.Its within walking distance of town.A long walk, but doable.I should stake it out.Soon.You want to come?Ill think about it, Keith said.In the background, there was a sudden crash, followed by the shrill wail of his youngest.Id better go rescue Annie.Ill talk to you later.Sean put his phone away, resigned to doing his stakeout alone.Keith was a family man and a sensible guy who listened to his wife.Annie would tell him he didnt need to run around the countryside chasing a phantom.Night had fallen fast.The mountains loomed black against the dark sky, seeming closer than they really were.If Sean blocked off the lights of the church with his hand, he could imagine himself in the midst of the Southern Nantahala Wilderness, miles from another living soul.Night sounds gathered around him, took him in.Far away, a fox barked.Nearby, spring peepers and a whippoorwill made their racket against the backdrop of a constant wind.A sudden yipping and yelping exploded in the hills.Coyotes.They sounded like a flock of demented birds.They usually saved their eerie ruckus for early morning, but something must have set them off.He was glad Mikey was safe inside.Time to go in, before he started believing in ghosts and haunts.He went in and turned on the outside lights again.They threw the yard and the porch into stark, artificial daylight.He didnt blame Laura for hating them.She lay still, her breathing easy and slow.For a moment he tormented himself with the idea of kissing her as she slept, but the kind of kiss he was imagining wouldnt go unnoticed.Shed wake up and claw his eyes out.He gave her foot a firm squeeze instead.Still no reaction.He was bone tired too.He never turned in so early, but maybe hed at least lie down for a while.But where?Not in Lauras bed; a man just didnt fall into a womans bed without her permission, even if she wasnt in it.And the guest bed was piled high with clothes she planned to donate somewhere.Jesss room?No, he wasnt sleeping in a dead womans bed.He was too spooked already, for a variety of reasons.Once again, his truck would be in the driveway overnight.He didnt care about the old hens and their gossip, but Elliott might be out there somewhere, watching.A classic case of the overprotective father.He might be upset that his baby girl had a man staying in the house.Keep your hands where they belong, Elliott had warned Sean years ago.Some men might not protect their daughters, but Ill always protect my little girl.In the next breath, Elliott had made Sean promise to take care of her.Im trying, man, Sean said quietly.Im trying.He found a sleeping bag in the hall closet and spread it on the floor by the couch.It was better than the night before, when hed slept on nothing but the hooked rug.He felt sorry for himself, a little, until he thought of Elliott in the wild.Sean shook his head.The game of Lets Pretend had already contaminated his mind.He went outside, pausing to look and listen for anything unusual, and retrieved his gun from the rack in the truck.Back inside, he slid the weapon under the couch.He would still obey Lauras no guns rule if he could, but he wanted to be prepared for anything.Lying on the sleeping bag, he listened to the new silence.Hed never realized how much the chimes had been a part of every storm.A single night light shone on the wall, casting a faint reflection off the gleaming wood of the grandfather clock as it ticked.Knowing he wouldnt be able to stay awake, he closed his eyes and hoped for a guardian angel or two.Not effeminate Hallmark style angels, but the real McCoy with flaming swords in their hands and the power of God behind them.Laura woke to the aroma of fresh coffee.Everything was blurry without glasses or contacts, but she saw a sleeping bag rolled up and sitting on the floor.Seans boots lay cattywampus by the front door.Now the coffee made sense.Long before bedtime, she must have fallen asleep on the couch.Shed slept straight through, and hed camped out on her floor again.The old ladies would have a field day with that.Not that it mattered.Gossip wasnt important anymore, unless someone had a new rumor that held a grain of truth.But the truth was simply that her dad had been lurking around his own house.Cutting down the wind chimes hed given his wife.He wasnt hiding in the mountains.He was somewhere within walking distance.The thought made her pulse quicken with excitement.She sat up, running a hand through her messy hair, and squinted at the white glare of the new lights outside.They ruined the sunrise.Wearing jeans and a black shirt, Sean walked out of the kitchen carrying two identical green mugs, part of a set shed given her mom for Christmas a few years ago.You awake, sweetheart?Just barely.Hed already moved on to sweetheart, and shed answered without even thinking.It was as if theyd time traveled back to high school.Except everything had changed.He set both mugs on the coffee table, then sat on the floor beside her and leaned against the couch.He picked up his coffee, took a sip, and yawned.Out of his line of vision, she brought one finger close to his hair and imagined playing with it.Or cutting it.Shed have to talk him into a haircut.He needed a shave too.She sat up straighter and wrapped both her hands around her coffee to keep them out of his hair.The security lights assaulted her eyes through the curtains.I hate those new lights.I knew you would, but relax.Theyll go off as soon as theres enough natural light.Or as soon as I hit the switch.I see, he said in a weary voice.I went to all the trouble of installing them just so you can be your usual uncooperative self.Im sorry, Sean.I really do appreciate your efforts to take care of me.Its only what I promised your dad.She stared down at the top of his head.You did what?When we were seventeen, he gave me the keep your hands off my daughter lecture, and then he made me promise to take good care of you.Suddenly she was wide awake.You meanlike he thought he wouldnt be around?No.More like he thought wed marry someday.Which is a fine idea.Sean, stop it.Once shed conquered the lump in her throat, she dared to speak again.You should spend the day in your workshop.If I need you, Ill call.You can be here in three minutes.He was silent for a little while.All right.Im not too worried about what might happen in broad daylight.As long as you keep your doors locked, you can kick me out during the day, but Im staying here again tonight.Like it or not.Ooh, the rumors will fly.People will say youve moved in.I dont care.Im not leaving you here alone at night.He rose, leaving his coffee on the table, and looked down at her.Ill be back.See you later, then.She gave him a little wave, then closed her eyes, deliberately shutting him out.Afraid of what he might say or do next.Later, he echoed.Behave yourself.He crossed the floor, his boots making a heavy tread.His keys jingled.The door shut firmly, and the lock clicked.Still keeping her eyes closed, she listened to the sounds of his departure.Once the sound of the trucks engine had faded into the distance, she opened her eyes.If hed flashed his lights again, shed missed it.It was Seans favorite time to be in the shop, when the slant of the late sunlight gave the room a dramatic glow.Dale had arrived just in time to spoil it.He was getting cagier.He must have parked around the corner, and when Sean walked to the street for his mail, the old man slipped through the side yard and into the shop.Sean was packed up and itchy to return to Lauras place before nightfall, but Dale never stayed long.Hed been roaming around for five minutes now, examining everything and fingering most of it, but even in his half tanked state he had the sense not to open the door to the spray room and wood storage.He swayed on his feet as he pointed vaguely toward the window.Isnt your sign a little too, you know, fancy schmancy?Sean shrugged.When he made the sign, hed taken great pains to keep the style simple, but he should have left off his middle name.Sean Michael Halloran, Luthier, sounded pretentious.The sign didnt even show from the street, though, so it didnt much matter.Its my name and my occupation, Sean said.Thats all.Its a pansy kind of occupation.I know, I know.Thats why youll leave me the pansy gun when you die.Its something to look forward to.Dale slurred an ugly curse.Why, thank you, Sean said, earning himself another one.Dale laughed.Whered you learn to be so polite, boy?I sure didnt teach you that.You sure didnt.As Dale made a slow, unsteady circuit of the shop, he kept glancing back at Sean as if to gauge his mood.Sean knew what was coming next.You got any cash?If you want to sell me the pansy gun, I do.I aint a gun shop.I aint selling.And Im not a bank.Dale rubbed his eyes.They put out any reward money on Gantt?Sean almost laughed at the absurdity.No.And they wont, so forget it.Thats all right.Just findin him will be enough for me.Hes back.I know he is.Once he has the guts to show his face, Ill get even.Get even for what?That call.What call?You know, idiot.The phone call.When you were a kid.The one that saved my life?Dale snarled another curse.Why do you always exaggerate?I dont.And Elliott couldnt have made the call.He was too busy patching me up.Dont try to get revenge for something he didnt do.Dale cracked a smile.I wouldnt hurt him.Id just kick him around a little.Pay him back for stealing my son.It aint right for a man to do that.Gary Bright too.He did the same.They never stole a thing from you, Dale.Sure, they helped me.They both did.You wouldnt believe all the ways Gary has helped me, and he never asks me to pay him back.Pay it forward, he says.You, though?Youre always begging me for cash.And sympathy.Poor, poor Dale, always the innocent victim.Sean ducked just in time.Dales fist hit air and he reeled.Get out.Sean seized him before he could catch his balance and frog marched him to the door.Get off my property and stay off.Stay off Lauras property too.With one final shove, Sean evicted him, then nipped back inside and drew the deadbolt.Dale howled, probably not in pain but in rage, then stumbled and fell face first on the grass.He lay motionless in the same spot where Sean had assembled the kite so many years ago.About the time Sean was getting worried, Dale picked himself up and limped toward the front yard.Leaning like a tree in a strong wind, he disappeared around the corner of the house hed once owned.So angry he could hardly form a coherent sentence, Sean called 911 to report the DUI in a black pickup truck.Once again, the dispatcher said theyd be on the lookout.After hed hung up, Sean nearly called back to report Dales illegal ownership of a handgun.It wasnt hurting anyone in a closet in Dales cramped apartment, though.It probably hadnt been fired in a generation or more.He was afraid to fire it, afraid to take it out of its case, even afraid to admit that he had it.The last remnant of the Halloran familys wealth, it was his only remaining treasure.Sean moved around the shop, touching his fingertips to the instruments he loved.Dale hadnt harmed anything yet, although there was always the chance that hed set the place on fire some night.Or show up with a sledgehammer and start swinging.The workbenches and the pegboard walls held instruments in all stages of gestation.Some were held together with clamps and vises.Some awaited their final finishes.Some needed nothing more than price tags and new owners.He inhaled the smells of varnish, glue, and wood and savored the satiny sheen of the instruments.The utilitarian beauty of the tools.The clutter of strings and picks and capos.Elliott had introduced him to all of itthe world of musicthe day hed handed him a broom and said, Sweep.I cant pay much, but Ill teach you everything I know.Sean had swept like crazy.He would have swept a path to the moon for Elliott.Or for Laura.Still would.Hed better get over there.She might feel a little too secure with those new locks.There were ways around them, including a simple knock.She wouldnt open the door for just anybody, but she might open it for her dad.Or someone who claimed to be him.Choosing only one mandolin and one guitar that still needed breaking in, Sean tucked them into their cases and locked up.As he backed the truck out of the driveway, he saw the albino raccoon inching his way down the trunk of the big oak.Sean hadnt seen him in a couple of days and was glad the little guy was still around.He rolled down his window.Casper!Get back in that tree.Dont come out until dark.Casper froze, hugging the trunk, but didnt retreat.Good luck to you, then.Sean rolled up his window and hit the gas.He must have gone nuts.He was giving survival advice to a baby raccoon.By the time he reached Lauras house, a healthy sense of victory had crowded out the anger hed felt toward Dale.Sean slowed at the curve, his eyes drawn to the graveyard.All over the cemetery, the wind had toppled real and artificial flowers.Lauras tall tin vase had fallen, spilling pink azaleas across the grave.He hoped she wouldnt notice.He didnt want her in the graveyard at nightfall.Pulling into the driveway, he spotted her on the far side of the porch, facing the mountains at the rear of the house.He decided to use the front door for a change, to see if she was remembering to keep it locked.He carted the instruments and his duffel bag up the front steps.The door was locked.Good girl, he said under his breath, juggling everything while he found his key.Leaving his things in the living room, he walked through the kitchen and out the back door.Laura still leaned against the railing at the far end of the porch.Shed pulled her hair into a neat, schoolteacher ish bun that wasnt half as sexy as the messy, curly ponytails of her tomboy days.Sexy enough, though.He wanted to sneak up behind her and kiss the nape of her neck, but Elliott had taught her some painfully effective ways to discourage unwanted attention, using nothing but her hands and feet.Reluctantly ending his unobserved survey of her, he shut the door and stepped onto the porch.Im back.Then he felt like an idiot for stating the obvious.No doubt shed heard his truck from a quarter mile away.Looking over her shoulder, she gave him a wary smile.Did you accomplish much today?I did.He wanted to add I kicked Dale out, accompanied by some chest thumping, but it wasnt something to brag about.Did you bring any work with you?Careful not to crowd her too much, he joined her at the railing.A little bit.Some guy from an alarm company stopped by with information.I told him Im not interested.Got it?Yes maam.It was her house.Her life.He couldnt make her decisions for her.A blue jay sailed past, its feathers bright against the dusky sky, and lit in the feathery branches of a pine.Ten feet below the jay, a woodpecker rattled against the furrowed, moss patched trunk.Two birds on one tree, when they had hundreds to choose from.How many millions of pines were there?How many thousands of tree covered ridges?When hed gone online to search satellite images of Prospect and the surrounding mountains, it had been daunting to see so much wilderness so close to town.The mountains were full of ruined cabins, hunting shacks, bat haunted caves.Abandoned gold mines and logging camps too.Then there were the primitive campsites on federal and state land, or a man could create his own little spot.
