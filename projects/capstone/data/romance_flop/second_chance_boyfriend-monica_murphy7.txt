The smile that appears is worth my few hours away from Drew.I think this girl needs my friendship more than I realize.I dont know, La Salles?I smack her lightly on the arm.Good one.I dont think so.How about Jakes?Its always hopping.Wellyou do realize Im underage.I used to have a fake ID but I lost it.After a bouncer made me sign a piece of paper to make sure the signature matched it one night about a year ago when I was with some loser dude on a date, and it didnt match.I was done for.He snatched that license from me and I havent bothered to find another one since.So Im not much fun on the go out and get drinks deal.Jen laughed and shook her head.I forgot.You act so much older than twenty, you know?Youre like an old soul.I dont know whether to take that as a compliment or an insult.I wrinkle my nose.She laughs some more.Its definitely a compliment.We can go out to dinner.Ill drink and you can watch me.Ooh, sounds fun, I say sarcastically, but I really do mean it.Ill text you details tomorrow.Jen slings her purse over her shoulder, studying me.You dont mind, do you?I know you have that guy in your life now.I squirm, suddenly uncomfortable.Im not prepared to talk about Drew with anyone yet.I can stand to be away from him for a few hours.Maybe.Are you sure?Her gentle voice and twinkling eyes tell me shes teasing, but I also wonder if shes worried Ill bail on her for a guy, which I have no plans in doing.Drew and I dont need to spend every waking moment together.Though sometimes it sure feels like we do.Being away from him is hard.Silly, considering hes been back in my life for only a matter of days, but we share such an intense connection, its hard to ignore it.By the dreamy look on your face, Im going to guess this guy must be pretty special.Jen nudges me.You can tell me all about him tomorrow night.Yeah, I agree with a laugh, but I doubt I will.What I share with Drew is still a little too special to blab about with my new friend.Drew I watch Fable exit the restaurant.Shes with the same girl who worked with her the night of Logans party.Tall, with dark hair and olive skin, shes the complete opposite of Fable in every way.Its sort of funny, watching them talk animatedly with each other.A yin to each others yang.My heart squeezes in my chest when I see Fable laugh and shake her head.She looks happy.The happiest Ive ever seen her.Id like to think Im responsible for some of that happiness.I know shes made me the happiest Ive ever been.She waves goodbye to her friend and walks across the parking lot toward my truck.Im struck anew by how beautiful she is, her smile growing on her face as she comes closer.Shes wearing those damn shorts again, the ones that are way too short, and this time shes added black tights to the mix.They make her legs look incredibly long.And incredibly hot.Pushing away from the side of the truck, I meet her halfway, slipping my arms around her and pulling her in for a quick kiss.Shes warm to my cold since Ive been standing outside for the last ten minutes, and she brushes her nose against mine before she pulls away.Youre freezing, she murmurs.Her voice alone warms me up and I open the truck door for her without a word, pushing her inside by cupping her backside, making her squeal.I slam the door and round the truck, eager to take her back to my place, though I have no idea where she wants to go.She probably has to get home.She has responsibilities, after all.And I have none, as my shrink so kindly reminded me.Where to?I ask casually once I slip behind the wheel.I should probably go home.She wont meet my gaze, and I wonder why.No problem.I throw the truck into gear and pull out of the parking lot, turning onto the street.Busy night?Exhausting.Thank God Im off tomorrow.We should do something.I dont have school and she doesnt work.We could stay in bed all day and Id be perfectly content.Um, about tomorrow.She sounds hesitant.Even a little nervous.My friend Jen, the girl I work with?She asked if we could hang out together tomorrow night.Go to dinner and have drinks.Stuff like that.You dont care, do you?I care a lot.Id rather she never left my side, but Im being completely unrealistic.And also thinking like a jealous ass.I dont mind.I mean, Im not your keeper.Shes watching me.I can feel her eyes on me though I face straight ahead.Itll only be for a few hours.I get the sense Jen doesnt have many friends.I dont either.Its nice to find one who doesnt think Im out to fuck her boyfriend behind her back.I have to look at her now, shocked at the harsh way she just spoke.Did you used to do that?Fuck other girls boyfriends behind their backs?She shoots me an icy stare.No.A sigh escapes her.Fine.I made one mistake.Only because he lied to me and said he didnt have a girlfriend.I was a sophomore in high school and he was a senior.Gorgeous.Popular.Played on the football team, sort of like a weak copy of you.We went out on a few dates.He was always sneaking me around, never taking me out in public or with his friends, but I didnt care.I was too far gone over him.This story is going in a bad direction.I can feel it.A weak copy of me?What, does she have a pattern?A type she prefers?Is she saying I fall under that type?You know what I mean.She waves a hand.He was my first.I gave up my V card to him because I was stupid, thinking it would bring us closer and he would fall totally in love with me.Then I find out he has a girlfriend, right after I had sex with him.He was totally using me because she wouldnt mess around with him, so he ran out and found the first dumb girl who would.I both feel sorry for her and infuriated with her that she would do something so careless.So, what, you were fifteen when you were first with that guy?Yeah.How many guys have you been with, Fable?Okay, now I totally sound like the jealous asshole boyfriend.I dont want to be that guy.I know she needs to get her past off her chest and it shouldnt matter.It shouldnt hurt me.I didnt know her then.We were both different people then.But knowing about her past does hurt.I cant deny it.Youre going to automatically assume the number is outrageous, arent you?I really didnt expect you to pass judgment on me like everyone else in my life.She crosses her arms in front of her chest.You disappoint me, Drew.I figured you were better than that.Fuck.How do I respond?Ive blown it completely.Now shes pissed.I can practically see the steam rising out of her ears.She refuses to look at me, too.Instead she chooses to stare straight ahead for the rest of the ride to her apartment, her jaw hard, her eyes narrowed.From happy to angry in a matter of minutes, thats what I just did to her.And why?Because Im feeling a little possessive of her time and I want her to spend it all with me?Am I that insecure?Ive never had a real girlfriend before.Ive never been someones boyfriend.Twenty freaking one years old and Im a complete, clueless idiot when it comes to relationships and how to make them work.I pull into the parking lot of her apartment complex and her hand is already on the door handle.She looks ready to leap out of the vehicle while its still in motion, she wants to get away from me that badly.Fable, wait.Hitting the brakes, I wait for her to respond, but she doesnt.Her back is to me, her body poised to take flight and escape right out the door.Ive hurt her and I hate that.Im sorry, I say, my voice soft.I didnt mean to pass judgment on you.I have no right to do so.You accept all my faults, so its the least I can do for you.She turns to glare at me.Because I accept your faults, youll accept mine?Is that all this is?If so, I need more from you, Drew.This isnt some tit for tat sort of deal.I need your trust.I need you to believe that I want to be with you and only you.And my past cant shade our present or our future.My past has always followed me, and you know what sucks?Most of the stories out there are completely untrue.I make a few wrong steps, a few bad mistakes, and it turns into me ruling a multiyear slutdom over all the guys.Through high school, outside of high school I remain quiet, absorbing her words.Shes right.I cant let her past bother me or darken our future.If I do, Im just setting us up to fail.Im not perfect, she murmurs.No one is.But Im not going to pay for my mistakes every time you get mad at me or jealous.Going out with Jen tomorrow night isnt about me trying to flirt with other guys or anything like that.I never said it was.Her eyes soften the slightest bit.So whats the problem?Why are you acting like this?Im not good at this sort of thing.Im fucking it all up and I dont know why.I tap my fingers against the edge of the steering wheel, unsure of what to say next, feeling edgy as hell.She holds all the cards in this argument right now.Im scared shes going to say Im not worth the trouble.Using that as an excuse isnt going to fly forever, you know.After a while, itll just get old.What are we doing, Fable?I ask incredulously.She shrugs.Having our first fight as a couple?I want to laugh, but I dont.I mean this.Us.Whats going on between us?If you have to ask, that scares me, she answers warily.Are we really a couple?Are we in a relationship?We havent defined it yet.Do we need to?Cant we just take it day by day?She turns away from me and stares out the window.Im tired.Maybe we shouldnt talk about this now.Panic rises within me.But I think I want to be alone.Im super tired and the last few days have been sorta overwhelming.She opens the door and climbs out of my truck, bending over so she can meet my gaze through the still open door.Ill call you tomorrow?It feels like shes leaving me for good.My throats dry and I can hardly force any words out, Im so worried this is it.With my luck, Ill never see her again.Yeah, I croak before she slams the door.Call me.She offers me a tiny smile before she lets the door close.And then she turns and walks away.Taking my heart with her.If I had a flower for every time I thought of youI could walk through my garden forever.Alfred, Lord Tennyson  Fable Wake up.I yank the covers from Owen and he tries to grab at them, rolling onto his back with an agonized groan.Shit, Fabes, what are you doing here?And why are you waking me up like some sort of drill sergeant?Ha, if I were a drill sergeant Id have a whistle blasting in your ear and be commanding you to run some damn laps.I thwack him on the leg with my index finger and thumb, dropping the comforter back on him in a pile.Youre going to be late for school.He cracks open his eyes and glances at the clock on his rickety bedside table.Its not even seven yet.Why the hell are you up?What are you even doing here?I thought youd stay the night with your new lover boy again.Yeah, well, so did I.  Id even contemplated asking Drew to stay with me so I could be here for Owen last night.But that petty argument we got into ruined all those plans.I wanted to stay home and talk to you.I sit on the edge of his bed, glancing around his room.Its a disaster, not that mine is much better, but at least I dont have smelly socks lying all over the place and a pile of dirty clothes in the middle of the room that I swear is waist high.You need to douche this room, and soon.Did my big sister use the word douche?Now I think Ive heard it all.He sits up and rubs the back of his head.I cant believe you ditched your new man for me.You must want to talk about some serious shit.Why must you continue to use such foul language?I sound like a mom.I should be used to his constant cussing.And really, I have no room to judge.Ive had a foul mouth for years.It was my first act of rebellion against my mother and I never let up.Gimme a break.You curse like a sailor.He stifles a yawn and scratches his bare chest.What do you want to talk about?Ive been thinking.I pluck at a loose thread on his worn comforter.I really wish I had more money so I could buy the two of us nicer things.I want to find a different apartment.Hes quiet for a moment and I look at him, see the shock and disbelief written all over his face.You want to move?And leave me with Mom all alone?No.I shake my head.No, no, no.I would never do that.I want us to leave Mom.I want the two of us to live together.When he doesnt say a word, I forge on.Shes never here.Shes always with her new boyfriend and she doesnt have a job anymore, so she cant pay rent.Im paying for everything, and trust me, its hard.I dont make a ton of money.I work freaking part time, though my new boss is willing to give me more hours.Thats great.It is, but we still have too much apartment here.I bet I could find a two bedroom in a better neighborhood for way less money.What do you think?You want to do it?Ill go wherever you go, he says, but I can hear the hesitation in his voice.But what?ButIm only fourteen.Arent there legalities or whatever about that sort of stuff?Like, wont Mom have to make you my guardian or something if I go and live with you?Why would she need to?Lets not pretend that she wants us around here so bad.She wont care if you come live with me.She might.He drops his head, bunching the comforter up in his lap.Crap.He wants to believe Mom actually cares about him.After all, hes just a kid.No one wants to face the realization that their mom doesnt give a rats ass about them.I still dont like facing it.But Ive put up a wall against the pain and tell myself it doesnt matter.I dont need her.Owen.I grip his knee and he looks up, his gaze meeting mine.We both have the same eyes as Mom, though I always thought his were prettier.He has the thickest, darkest lashes Ive ever seen, and I dont know where he got them from considering his hair is a dirty blond.Girls are going to go crazy for those eyes someday, if they arent already.My brother is handsome.Cocky and full of attitude.I feel sorry for any girl who falls for him.I want you with me.I dont want to do this alone.What about Drew Callahan?Wouldnt you want to move in with him?Isnt he rich?I grimace.I have no idea whats going on with Drew.But you and me?Were blood.Were family.Im not about to leave you.Were all each other has.Whats Mom gonna do?Dont you think shell get mad?I doubt it.This way she doesnt have to worry about us and she can go live with her boyfriend.I can find a nicer place thats smaller and pay less rent.Its a win win for us all.I cant think about Mom getting upset with me for wanting to do this.Why should she care?Im making her life easier.What happens if it doesnt work out for her and Larry the Loser?Then where will she go?Owen.I grip his knee tighter.Shes not our responsibility.Shes an adult.She can take care of herself.He tilts his head, screws up his lips.Looking far older and world weary than any fourteen year old should.I just worry about her.I worry about you, too.Im supposed to be the man of the house.My jaw drops.Who told you that?Mom.A long time ago.She said I had to watch out for the both of you and I promised I always would.I havent done the best job of it, but I swear, I try.My heart breaks for this kid.Hes gone through so much at too young of an age.Hes seen too much.Grabbing his shoulders, I bring him in for a quick hug, not holding on to him for too long since I know hell just wiggle out of my grip anyway.Well take care of each other, okay?Its not all on me or all on you.Well share the load.Ill help you with whatever you need, Fabes.Im on your side.I promise.He clings to me and I hug him close, savoring it for a little while longer.I love him so much.I hate that hes conflicted between Mom and me.Go take a shower, I tell him once I get up off the bed and start out of his room.And when you get home today, I want you to clean this room.It sucks.His laughter follows me down the hall as I head toward the kitchen.Ive been up for over a half hour, lying in bed, staring at the ceiling.Thinking of looking for an apartment today, talking to Owen about it, maybe gathering up the courage to talk to Mom about her moving out.Trying my best to not think of Drew.What the hell happened last night, anyway?Our fight had started out of nothing.I tried to be honest with him and he got all macho man how many guys have you fucked anyway on me.I accept him for who he is, flaws and all, so why cant he accept me?I get irritated just thinking about it.So its best I dont.A knock sounds at the door and I scowl.Who the hell is here at seven in the morning?Stomping over to the door, I look through the peephole but I see nothing.I throw open the door and peek to the left, then the right.No ones there.Then I glance down and find a gorgeous bouquet of wildflowers sitting on the thin, faded doormat.The vase is full of a riot of colorful blooms; I cant identify any of them beyond their pretty colors.I know in an instant who theyre from.Grabbing the vase, I clutch it in my hand as I step farther outside, my gaze steady as I study the parking lot.But I dont see his truck.I dont see any indication hes been here at all other than the flowers in my hand.How the heck did he get them here and then disappear?I know hes fast on the football field, but come on.Where did he go?Who the hell was knockingoh, Lover Boy.I turn to see Owen grinning at me, wearing a stained T shirt with some unknown and Im sure crappy bands logo on the front and black faded skinny jeans.We walk back into the apartment together.Thats what youre wearing to school?He glances down at himself.Im not going to the prom.Gimme a break.Hey, you got any smokes?Owen!Promise me youre not smoking.The guilty look on his face says it all.If the flowers werent so beautiful, Id hurl the vase at him, Im so pissed.Youre too young to smoke.Its a horrible, nasty habit.You do it.Not all the time.I mostly quit.Yeah, that sounds lame as hell.I only smoke every once in a while, Owen whines.It soothes my nerves.Such a bullshit answer.Im sure if I dug around in your room right now, Id find some weed, too.Am I right?I raise a brow, just daring him to deny it.His eyes widen the slightest bit right before he goes for pure defiant nonchalance.Oh, who cares?You act like youve always been on the straight and narrow.I bet youve smoked a few bowls in your life.Not really.Drugs dont do much for me.I smoked a joint here and there through high school, but cigarettes were my major vice.The occasional keg party would do me in, too.Make me do stupid things.Thats why I avoided them after a while.Im twenty, youre fourteen.Theres a difference between what Im doing and what youre doing.Such crap, Owen mutters as he walks away from me, heading toward the couch where his sweatshirt is flung over the back.Im outta here.I set the vase down on the kitchen counter, my pleasure at receiving the flowers evaporating when I realize Ive not only just gotten into a huge fight with my brother, but I did the same thing with Drew last night.Whos the one with the problem, hmm?Owen, look.Im sorry.He stops at the door, as if hes waiting for me to further explain myself.I just hate to see you make a bunch of stupid mistakes like I did.I wish you could learn from me.Im going to do what I do no matter what, Fabes.I wish you could see that.He turns to face me, looking like a ragamuffin in his faded black sweatshirt streaked with bleach stains.Who the hell does his laundry?Oh, thats right, he does.Im not a bad kid.I get decent grades.I only skip class sometimes.And I have good friends.So I smoke here and there.So I get high and forget about my troubles for a while.Is that so bad?Yes!I want to shout at him.I want you to be perfect and well behaved and never give me any problems.I dont want you doing drugs or smoking or drinking or fooling around with girls.I want you to be eight years old forever.Maybe we can talk later?I suggest.I should be here when you get home from school.What else is there to talk about?Youve already made up your mind.Were moving without Mom, you hate that I smoke, and you think Im a fuck up.Whatever.He leaves the apartment without another word, slamming the door behind him, and Im left standing there, so shocked my mouth is hanging open.Holy.Crap.Ive stepped in it all over the place.Why am I so confrontational lately?What the hell is my problem?Regret settles over me and I sit heavily on the creaky bar stool.Way to go and screw up that conversation.Clearly Im the one with the bad attitude.I keep picking fights with my favorite people.Not the smartest move Ive ever made, thats for sure.I run my finger over one of the soft flower petals.Its a bright, sunny yellow, the complete opposite of my morose mood.Look at me.A man leaves me flowers on my doorstep and Im all mopey.I should be the one apologizing and hes the one making grand gestures.No guy has ever brought me flowers.Ever.My gaze catches sight of a small cream colored envelope nestled among the blooms and I snatch it up, opening the envelope with trembling fingers.Fable is Faithful Amazing Beautiful Loving Exquisite Im sorry.Drew  A wistful sigh full of longing escapes me.I think hes trying to slowly tear me apart so he can be the only one who puts me back together.His words kill me.Slay me dead.And they fill me with so much hope, I dont know how I could have ever doubted him.Drew My head is throbbing when I wake up, my brain foggy.I lay awake in bed most of the night, replaying my conversation with Fable.Unable to figure out exactly where everything went wrong, but since Im a world class screw up, it had to be my fault.I finally gave up pretending to sleep and climbed out of bed, threw on some clothes, and went to a local supermarket.Found a beautiful arrangement of wildflowers and bought it without thinking twice.Yeah, maybe I shouldve got her some roses since theyre twice as expensive and supposedly are more romantic, but they didnt seem Fables style.The note made me work a little harder.I wanted to get it just right.No way could I use the word marshmallow.She wouldve killed me.Id like to see her use it on me again.The one time she did, I almost blew it and didnt show up.But if she ever did use our code word again, Id love to see that moment of sweet surprise wash over her when I come to rescue her so fast, her head spins.Instead, I write her a little poem using her name.Much like I did for my tattoo, though this one is simpler.Sweeter.All about her.Once I got back home, I crashed out.Woke up hours later with the hangover feeling, the suns light deathly bright in my room.Feels like the day is already half over and when I check my phone, I see that it almost is.I also see I have a bunch of text messages from a certain someone.Drew is Delicious Real Extra sexy and Wonderful My heart threatens to crack.She wrote me a poem back.I cant fucking believe it.I text her a response: You got the flowers then.She replies immediately.I love the flowers.Thank you.A smile forms on my lips as I answer her.Youre welcome.Did you like the note?I loved the note even more.I think youre a closet romantic.My smile grows.Only for you.She doesnt answer, and I wonder if I somehow screwed up.Then I get pissed at myself for always thinking I screwed up.She finally texts back: What are you doing?Im still in bed.I pause.Should I say what I really want to say next?Aw, fuck it.Thinking of you.I send the text, my heart rate increasing.I hope shes forgiven me.Im dying to see her.Are you naked, Drew?Because I could totally get on board with that image.I burst out laughing at her text and quickly reply.You want me naked?That can be arranged.Im only in sweats, not even wearing any underwear.That Im thinking like this almost makes me want to laugh.Also makes me want to suggest we indulge in some of that phone sex/sexting thing we talked about a few nights ago, which sort of blows my mind.But with Fable, Im willing to do just about anything.Only if Im naked with you.A few words typed on a screen and Im hard as steel.Damn, this girl.My doorbell rings and I go completely still.Who the hell is that?I head toward the door and open it, shock rendering me frozen when I find Fable standing on my doorstep, her cell phone clutched in her hand.A wicked smile curves her lips and I let my gaze wander over her.Shes wearing bright pink cotton shorts and a black long sleeve T shirt that clings to her breasts and makes them look huge.Her hair is pulled back in a long braid, wild blond strands brushing her cheeks.Her face is devoid of makeup with the exception of some gloss slicking her lips, making them extra shiny.Extra kissable.My girl is gorgeous.Those shorts should be criminal.Theyre like a lethal weapon.I swear if I keep staring at her legs Ill keel over from witnessing too much hotness.I keep getting these crazy messages from some random guy.She holds her phone up.I see the last message I sent her on the screen, along with her accompanying reply.Shes just as guilty.He says he wants to get naked with me.I lean against the door.If she wants to play this game, fine.Im up for it.Might make things more interesting.Hmm, weird.Why would anyone want to get naked with you?She rests her hands on her hips.I dont know.Looks like youre almost naked.Glancing down at myself, I scratch my bare chest.I can feel her eyes on me and I look up, watching her as she blatantly checks me out.Just like I blatantly checked her out only moments ago.I assume youve accepted my apology?Her expression changes in an instant.Those pretty green eyes dim and her mouth softens.Im the one who should apologize.I feel like Ive been picking fights all over the place.I grab her hand and yank her inside, shutting the door behind her.Without giving her a chance to think, let alone escape, I pin her against the door and hold her there with my body, my hands on her waist.Her skin is warm, I can feel her heat through the thin barrier of her shirt, and I want her.Beneath me, over me, with me.Always.Who else are you fighting with?I slip my fingers beneath the hem of her shirt so I can touch soft, pliant flesh.My brother.A shaky breath escapes her.Im sorry we argued last night, Drew.I love how she always cuts through the bullshit.There are no lingering misunderstandings or grudges.We argue, we challenge each other, we apologize, we move on.Im sorry, too.I lean in closer and inhale the subtle scent of her shampoo.She smells so good.Everything about her smells amazing.Shes warm and fragrant and soft in my arms, her breasts nestled against my bare chest, her arms wrapping loosely around my waist.Wanna have makeup sex?She giggles just before I rain kisses along her slender neck.The giggles turn instantly into a low moan and she slides her hands up my back, her nails skimming my skin.I would love to have makeup sex.Before she can say another word, I lift my head and settle my mouth on hers.Im hungry for her sweet lips, her tongue.I devour her, holding her in place as I cup her head with my hands, my fingers tangling in her hair, ruining her braid.She whimpers against my mouth, her hands diving beneath the loose waistband of my sweats, and I hear her murmur of pleasure when she discovers I have no underwear on.You are so bad, she whispers, her tongue darting out to lick my lower lip as she shoves my sweats down so they fall in a heap around my ankles.I step out of them and kick them out of the way, my tongue doing a slow search of the inside of her mouth.No one who knows me would ever consider me a bad boy.I left that image up to other guys, always happy to stay in my good guy place.Girls preferred bad boys, so I walked the straight and narrow.Plus, I flat out didnt like feeling bad.Being full of secret shame does that to a person.Fable makes me want to be bad for her, just to hear her say it.Her pleased tone is unmistakable.I think she likes corrupting me.My mouth never leaving hers, I grab her ass and lift.She twines her legs around my hips, clinging to me, the heat of her burning my dick through the thin fabric of her shorts.I frantically tug at them, dropping her so her feet fall to the ground only so I can push her shorts and lacy panties off, she helping me the entire time.Regret flashes through me as I watch the delicate scrape of fabric fall to the floor.Id have to linger over those pretty lace panties next time.Im too eager, too caught up in the moment to take it slow.I needed to be inside her.Now.Drew.She pants my name against my lips as I lift her back up, those sexy legs going around my hips, her ankles digging into my ass.I want to feel you.Youre feeling me right now, baby.Oh hell yeah, shes feeling me, and Im feeling her.Shes so slick and hot, the head of my cock nudges against her folds and all I want to do is plunge inside her.Fuck her until I cant see straight and Im coming so hard I cant think.I meanoh God, I cant think when you do that, she whispers, her voice trembling when I thrust against her, nice and slow.Im on the pill, Drew.Thats awesome.Yeah, no babies for us.We can barely handle each other, let alone throw a kid in the mix.She tugs on my hair, getting my attention.I mean, I want you inside me with no barriers.No condom.I stare into her eyes, my breaths coming in ragged pants, my skin already glistening with sweat.And I havent even been inside her yet.Im so worked up, so ready to do whatever she asks me to do, I dont give her suggestion a second thought.Im fully on board.That sounds like a great plan, I say as I slide inside her.Ah, fuck.Closing my eyes, I lean my forehead against hers, hear the thunk of the back of her head making connection with the door.But she doesnt seem hurt.More like overcome with sensation, just like I am.Without the condom on, the heat of her, snug and wet, its all a million times more intense.I could buck against her once and probably come like a geyser.Instead I take a deep breath and stay completely still.Shes so tight, so hot, and she shifts against me, making me groan and squeeze her hips hard to prevent her from moving any further.W whats wrong?She sounds confused.I open my eyes to see her troubled gaze.You keep moving like that, Im done.Moving like what?Justmoving.She does it once more, a subtle thrust of her hips, her legs tightening around me, sending me deeper, and I groan again, moving my forehead away from her so I can press it against the door.I cant take it.Why?She runs her hands through my hair, her nails scratching lightly along my scalp, and I shiver.Ill come so fast, Ill embarrass myself.Shes slowly sliding up and down, riding me as best she can.I want you to come fast.I want to watch you lose control.I find it She sets her mouth against my ear and releases a shuddering breath.Extra sexy.I smile despite my agony and lift my head to look at her.Shes quoting her poem to me and I love her for it.Weve only started.What about you?Come for me, Drew.Shes grinding against me now, and Im grinding back as if I have no control over myself.Theres plenty of time for us to do this again this afternoon, right?Right, I agree because at the moment, Ill agree to just about anything, she feels so fucking amazing wrapped all around me, her top and bra still on, the lower half of her body completely bare.Rectifying my neglect, I push her shirt up, exposing her white lacy bra that offers a glimpse of her hard pink nipples beneath, and I groan.Im going to lose it.I run my fingers along the edge of her bra, feel the tremble ripple beneath her creamy soft skin from my touch.I love you, Drew, she whispers.I watch her, entranced by the expression on her face.Her eyes are closed, shes biting her lower lip as I continue to touch her, as she continues to ride me, and Im completely and totally overwhelmed.I love you, too, I murmur against her swollen lips just before I kiss her, my tongue thrusting in her mouth much like I thrust deep inside her body.Continually, again and again, trying to convey all of the feelings, the love and the need and the want I have for her.Her little cry tells me shes closer than I thought and I increase my pace, spilling myself inside her within seconds.Shes coming, too, her body gripping my cock tight as she convulses around me, and I open my eyes.Watch her fall apart, intoxicated by the flush of her skin, the little anguished sounds she makes, the way she feels, the way she smells.Clutching her close, I run my fingers through her messy hair, touching her, calming my racing heart.She is my everything and I swear at this very moment, I will never let her go.Stand up for something you love.Even if it means you stand alone.Unknown  Drew My cells nagging ringtone wakes me up and I lift my head, glancing down to find Fable snuggled against me, warm and naked and fast asleep.Her arm is draped over my stomach, her cheek pressed against my pecs, her silky soft hair in my face.Hell no do I want to answer that call.Whoever it is can wait.I have my girl sprawled all over me, fast asleep.Why would I want to end this anytime soon?My phone stops ringing only to start again and I reach out, grabbing it from my bedside table to see who it could be.The word Dad flashes on the screen and I answer the call, trying my best to keep my voice low so I dont disturb Fable.Hey.Can you talk?He sounds frantic.Freaked out and upset.Sure, give me a minute.I disengage myself from Fables grip and she murmurs in her sleep when I slide away from her.Quietly I climb out of bed, grab my sweats, and slip them on before I head out into the living room.Whats going on?I ask.His breathing is ragged before he starts speaking.Adele cheated on me.I know it.Ive seen proof.Were finished.Through.I wont put up with her lies any longer.I fall onto the couch, my skin going ice cold at his words.What sort of proof have you seen?I followed her.She went to the country club, told me she was going for golf lessons.Some lessons.He snorts.She met up with the golf pro, dragged him into a private room, and kept him in there for hours.Hours.When they finally came back out, he had a shit eating grin on his face and she had a fresh fucked look about her.He groaned.I confronted them.Ah, Dad.My heart hurts for him.At his pain, the humiliation of what he must have endured.And for him to confront Adele and her piece on the sidedamn, he mustve been enraged.She went crazy, son.Crazy.Crying, hysterical, full of denials.All of them lies, all of them.Where are you now?At the house.I kicked her out.Left the country club, raced home, and tossed all her shit out onto the lawn.She followed me, raged at me in the front yard, and swore she was going to call the cops.So I did it for her.Closing my eyes, I scrub my hand over my face.My dads imploding marriage was one big fucked up mess.You called the cops?Sure did.And I asked them to escort her off the premises since she wouldnt leave.Considering my name is the only one on the mortgage, I think legally I have that right even though were married.Hell I dont know.He pauses.I met with my lawyer today and were proceeding with the divorce.The papers are being drawn up.She should be served in the next few days.Im done.Really.My voice is flat and full of doubt.I cant help it.Really.I know you probably find it hard to believe, but Im dead serious.She has wronged me so completely, theres no way she could ever come back from that.I cant trust her.Im done.If he knew what happened between Adele and me, hed probably be done with me, too.I can hardly stand the thought.Besides Fable, hes all I have.Has she bothered you lately?Like in the last twenty four hours?No.I havent heard from her at all.I figure shes staying with her fucking golf pro.Let her go see how uncomfortable her life will be, living with a punk ass kid working a shit job?Shell figure out real quick he wasnt worth screwing up our entire marriage over.The bitterness in Dads voice is overpowering.I dont know if Ive ever heard him sound so angry.If you need to get away from all the crap, come up here and hang out with me.I have the extra bedroom or you can grab a hotel room.Spend some time with me, clear your mind, I offer.Fable probably wont be pleased.Shes not a huge fan of my dad, but Ill worry about her later.I need to help him.He sounds off.Consumed with anger, and that cant be healthy.I appreciate the offer, but no way am I leaving this house.With my luck shed move her pretty ass back in here and never leave.Then shed get me on squatters rights or some such shit.I cant have it.Im staying put, he says determinedly.I bite back the sigh of relief that wants to escape.Well, know the offer still stands.I appreciate it, son, I do.I just cant believe His voice trails off and he releases a shuddering breath.God, I hope hes not crying.I cant believe she would do something like this to me.After everything weve been through, everything weve shared together, she goes and does something like this.Its unbelievable.Theres nothing I can say.I cant console him.I want him to run as far and as fast away from Adele as he can.But he loves her.For whatever reason, he loves her, and now hes hurting from her betrayal.Imagine if he found out what I did to him.I think of Vanessa.I still dont know the truth.No way do I want to go to Adele and demand the truth.Shed tell me one thing and Dad another.Sick, twisted bitch.I talk to Dad for a few minutes longer.More like let him rattle on for a while over how much she betrayed him while I listen and make the appropriate noises where needed.He cant stop talking about it.Hes starting to repeat himself, saying the same things over and over, his voice full of fire, his anger and sadness so strong I feel it settle over me like a heavy, wet blanket.But then I glance up and catch Fable standing in the hallway, her hair sticking out all over the place, my dark blue comforter wrapped around her naked body, her expression hesitant.Dad, I gotta go.Call me if you need me.Before he can reply, I end the call and go to her, slipping my arms around her and pulling her in, the bulky comforter preventing me from getting too close.Hey, youre awake.I woke up when you slipped out of bed.She rests her hands on my bare chest, stroking my skin.Is everything okay?
