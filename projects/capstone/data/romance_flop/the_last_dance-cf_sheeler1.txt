   It was 11:30am, Joshua was preparing lunch for Ruth.The last six months had been rough on Joshua.When the doctors said that they could do nothing else for Ruth, Joshua had mixed emotions.On one hand he was very sad, but on the other hand he was relieved that Ruth's suffering would soon be over.Joshua hated feeling that way, but he hated seeing his life long mate suffer even more.Joshua finished preparing lunch and looked at the clock.It was time for the Minhah, the afternoon prayer.Every day, for as long as he could remember, Joshua had prayed three times a day."It's been a Jewish custom since Moses led the Hebrews out of Egypt," Joshua's father had told him when he was a child.Joshua went to the bedroom to look in on Ruth.She was sleeping peacefully.Joshua left the bedroom door opened when he went into the living room to pray.This was his way of having Ruth with him during prayer.In the corner of the living room sat the most important thing in the little house, a simple shrine with seven candles, an incense burner and a bowl that held bread at worship time.
