Im going to trade you in for a new model!Hrrn, grunted Pete.Oz looked terrified.They sat down for a cup of tea.Giles was oddly touched to find his served in a mug with Wayne emblazoned on it in garish letters.Well, int this nice?Angie said.Giles opened his mouth to make a polite reply, but was interrupted by the slam of the front door.His brother, the ape, lumbered in, scratching its armpit.Its eyes narrowed when it saw them, and Giles instinctively huddled up to Oz for protection.Ullo, love.Our Waynes come round again, and he brung his boyfriend and all, Angie said brightly.The ape scowled, and stepped towards them.Giles tensed.Oz laughed, and leant back, resting one ankle on the opposite knee.His arms spread along the back of the sofa, emphasizing the breadth of his shoulders, while his shirt was stretched taut over a rather fine pair of pecs.Nah, its just your mums little joke.Ozs voice sounded different, Giles realised.His vowels were flatter; the consonants less defined.Not that youd have a problem with it if I was, would you?Despite his seemingly relaxed posture, Oz didnt take his eyes off Darren for an instant.The ape stared at him for a long moment, then subsided, and slumped into its chair.After a brief tussle with its father for the remote control, which it lost, it settled for glaring steadily at the television and totally ignoring them.So have you got a bloke, then, love?Angie asked brightly, as if massive amounts of testosterone had not just been expended in front of her.Oh, yes.His names Hugh, Giles began, with a fond smile.I met him in my first year at Oxford, at a wine tasting.Hed been instantly smitten by the mans rakish good looks, perfectly tailored jacket, and theatrical shudders of distaste at most of what was served.We got talking over some rather vile champagne, and Hugh invited me to the Beaujolais breakfast over at his college, and well, weve been together ever since.He blushed a little at the memory of that morning.Hugh was reading Egyptology, which meant no lectures before noonand then only on Thursdaysand Giles had been only too happy to skip his own classes to accept Hughs invitation to a post breakfast rogering back at Merton.He sounds lovely, doesnt he, Shards?I hope he treats you right.Oh, Hughs a perfect gentleman, Giles assured her.Weve had our ups and downs, but doesnt everyone?Hugh hadnt spoken to him for weeks after Giles had been unwise enough to voice his opinion that the ban on foxhunting wasnt such a very bad idea, all things considered.Then there had been the business about Hugh sleeping with the captain of the Varsity rugby team before the try outs.Giles had been devastated at first.But after Hughs explanation, Giles had quite agreed it was simply the sensible thing to dothe rugger equivalent of the theatrical casting couch, so to speakand nothing for him to be jealous about.Im seeing him tonight, actuallywere going to the opera.What about you, then, Oz?Angie asked.I bet youve got someone and all, with looks like those.Oz started.Oh, me?No, Imno.Not at the moment.Giles wasnt sure he liked that at the moment.Did Oz have someone he fancied, then?Who was he?And why hadnt Giles known about it?And who was he?Never mind, love, Angie consoled him.Im sure youll find someone.Ere, Shards, youre not seeing no one at the mo, are you?Shards looked up from her article on STDs, and considered Oz for a long moment.Nah.E aint my type.
