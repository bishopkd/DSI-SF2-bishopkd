So, Diana, have you managed to insult my date yet?Without a doubt, she replied.So far she seems less trampy than the others but she doesnt talk much.You talk enough for ten people.Nick was smiling but I could tell that he wasnt entirely joking.Wheres your husband?Shouldnt you be nagging him or bossing him around?Diana waved a dismissive hand.He can wait.I want to learn more about your lady friend.Not now, Dee.Nick was done with the friendly banter.Whats up your ass, Coop?she asked with flashing eyes.Nick placed his hand on the small of my back as he squared off against his friend.I like this one and Im not going to let you scare her away.Huh.Dianas head tilted as she studied Nick.So you do.Good.Im sure Ill like her, too.Two people who like me in one room?I guess there really is a first time for everything.I almost cringed at the amount of sass in my tone but Diana laughed.You and I are going to be good friends.She winked and toddled away on her impossibly high heels.I apologize for everything she said, which Im sure was crass and rude.Nick shook his head as he watched her leave.Dont worry about it.I kind of like her.So far she was the only person that had even bothered to talk to me.When I looked at Nick, he jaw was clenched.How are you doing?Nick looked away.Just dandy.I love weddings.Salt in an open wound?I asked as nonchalantly as possible.Something like that.Nick flinched and turned back to me.Charley, Im sorry.I had no idea this wedding was going to bother me so much.I thought I was over everything that happened with Heidi.Nick, dont worry about it.I touched his arm.Can I do anything to make it better?A slow smile appeared.Im sure you can.Ill let you know.This time I gave into the urge to hug him and he returned my embrace enthusiastically.His hands stroked my back as he exhaled into my neck.For the record, just being with you helps.Ditto.Nick went to get us another drink while I made my way into the ballroom to find our seats.According to the place card I was handed at the door, we were sitting at table 8.The other seats at the table were already filled and nobody looked in my direction as I stood behind the two remaining seats.After a pregnant pause, I slipped into my seat as quietly as possible.I agree, Alexa.No one thought he would actually attend.After what happened with his engagement, he must be mortified.The skinny woman across from me was talking loudly to the woman on her left, presumably Alexa.Alexa spoke equally loud.Oh, yes, Talia.It was terrible what happened.We all agree about that.But I think we all can also agree that he wasnt completely innocent in the whole thing.What do you know?Talia leaned so far forward in her seat that she nearly slid right off it.Well, mostly its just gossip.But Katies sister Betsy worked with some woman that was supposedly sleeping with the senator for years.Im sure Heidi knew about it, too.Everyone knew about it.It took me that long to realize they were talking about Nick.I didnt want to hear any more gossip from women who couldnt even be bothered to acknowledge my existence.Its a shame Nick couldnt keep his pants on.Their wedding wouldve been lovely.I opened my mouth to interrupt them but someone beat me to it.I see weve been seated with my fan club, Nick said smoothly, placing our drinks on the table with a loud thud that caused the others to look in our direction at last.He took his seat next to me, his knee bumping against mine.Nick.Alexa turned a bright shade of pink.I take it youve introduced yourself to my date?Nick took my hand.Charley, these are some catty women that know Carrie.Its a pleasure Im sure.I didnt even glance in their direction.Lets hope the food is better than the company.I dont see how it could possibly be any worse.No one spoke a word throughout dinner.Nick and I maintained our stern expressions in the interest of making the others uncomfortable, all the while engaging in excessive groping underneath the table.Nicks hand was all the way up my thigh when they announced that the dancing would begin in five minutes.Nick and I groaned at the same time and his hand resumed its journey.I stopped him just as his finger traced the edge of my panties.Come with me, I urged, rising out of my chair.Nick was startled but her recovered quickly and followed me across the room.Since the reception location was really just an old mansion, I assumed there were plenty of rooms we could duck into to release some sexual tension.I led Nick up the stairs and he stopped me once we were on the second floor.I appreciate the enthusiasm but we dont have to do this.We could just go back to the house.Nicks cheeks were flushed and he sounded slightly out of breath.I didnt give him a chance to recover.Instead, I grabbed the lapels of his suit jacket and pulled him close.Why wait?I asked pressing my lips eagerly against his and forcing my tongue inside.Nick responded by lifting me against him and backing me up until I was pinned against the wall.One hand caressed the side of my neck while the other slipped below the hem of my dress.I lifted my leg and wrapped it around Nick until we were pressed together, his bulge against my sweet spot with just layers of fabric in the way.Lets find a room, Nick panted.He pulled away reluctantly and opened the door to the first room on the left.We had both stepped all the way into the room and closed the door before we realized we werent alone.In fact, the groom was standing next to the bed, caught quite literally with his pants down.Shit, Craig.Sorry, we thought the room was empty.Nick started to back us out of the room.Nick.Craig reached for his pants and lost his balance.He caught himself before falling but not before taking a couple of steps to the right, revealing the reason why he was in the bedroom with his pants around his ankles.Mayor Hutchinson stared at us from his seat on the bed.Shit, Nick said again while I stood dumbly with my mouth hanging open.This isnt what it looks like.Craig hurried to fasten his pants.Nick, its not what you think.I swear.Nick shook his head several times as if he could clear the image from his brain.We were just leaving.Were sorry, I echoed lamely as I hurried to follow Nick.I caught up with him in the lobby downstairs.Nick.Stop.I cant talk about this right now, Charley.When Nick turned around his eyes were wide and his hands were shaking.I think you have to, Nick.You cant ignore what we just saw.I noticed that several people milling around in the lobby were watching us.Lets go outside.Nick charged ahead of me and we walked around the building until we were out of earshot of any eavesdroppers.You need to talk to Craig and let him explain.Maybe it really wasnt what we think.I knew my protest sounded silly but the situation was too ridiculous to be true.Craig was upstairs in a bedroom with his pants around his ankles during his wedding reception with someone that wasnt his wife.
