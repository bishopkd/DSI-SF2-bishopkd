You dont know what this means.I do, he assures me.Just make me proud, Nell.Thats all I ask.Im in.My heads spinning.In two weeks I start my new Art and Design foundation course.In two weeks I start my new life.10      Olly stares at me open mouthed.I thought we agreed that wed wait until next year?But Phil offered to lend me the money, I remind him.I can do it now.Were sitting on the steps by the duck pond opposite St Marys Church.Were enjoying some quality time together as a family  grabbing a guilty hour before Im back on shift again at six.The intended visit to Mount Ironalot will have to wait.Crumpled clothes will be de rigour again for the week.Its a beautiful, sunny day in downtown Hitchin.The sky is blue and cloud free.But the air is cool today and I pull my cardigan around me.Normally, Olly would put his arm round my shoulders, but he doesnt.Petal is busy bossing the poor, unfortunate ducks about and doling out bread to those she thinks are well behaved enough to deserve it.Even the dog is out with us and is trying to pretend hes cool about the ducks, but I know that hes secretly longing to give one just a little chew.Whats the rush?Olly asks.Why wait?We descend into silence.Stay away from the edge, Olly warns our daughter as she waddles after a duck.I just thought wed make such a big decision together, as partners.I cant help feeling hurt that Phil, Jenny and Constance seem to take precedence.It was a spur of the moment thing.I got caught up in their enthusiasm, I confess.It felt nice to have them cheering me on.Are you saying I dont?Why are we arguing about this?I feel really lucky to have got the last place, really lucky to have friends who care enough to want a better life for me, for us.Youre right, Olly concedes.Of course, youre right.I just feel a bit excluded.I lean against him and, finally, his arms slip round my waist.It wasnt intentional.It was simply how it happened.Olly sighs.Im stoked for you.Really I am.Im just worried about how well pay Phil back, worried about the extra work involved, worried that it will change us.I can go along with the first two, I tell him, but why would it change us?He shrugs.These things do.Not if you dont let them.I want to do everything I can to support you, Olly says.Ill take on some extra work so that you can cut back on your shifts.I dont like to admit that I havent quite worked out how well pay Phil back yet.Maybe we can give him a bit each month and then pay off the lump when I land myself a fabulously creative and extravagantly paid job at the end of the course.Its something I need to discuss with him, but my boss is so excited that Im going that he wont even deal with the nitty gritty of the finance.Its this little lady Im concerned about, Olly continues.What will we do with her?Im taking a course, Olly.At the local college, I remind him.I havent signed up for NASAs astronaut training programme.Itll be a breeze.I think, famous last words, even as I say it.Youre right.Im probably overthinking it.I want our daughter to be proud of us.I know.At that moment Petal lifts her skirt above her head and bends over, displaying her rugby players legs and spotty pants to the world.Olly puts his head in his hands.She gets that from you.Petal!I call out.What are you doing?Im showing the ducks my bottom, she shouts back.Clearly, shes not quite so concerned about making us proud of her.11      Day one of my new life as an art student.I got up mega early in order to leave myself hours of calm and collected preparation, so I can walk into my college in a Zen like state ready to absorb knowledge like a sponge.Petal sicking up in the bed is not a good start.Ive got a poorly tummy, my daughter complains.I lift her and take her into her own room, wiping her down with a warm flannel, changing her sicky pyjamas for clean ones and settling her in her own bed.Then my daughter promptly throws up down herself again and I repeat the process once more.After that I go and chivvy Olly out of our bed.Im not feeling that great myself, he moans.He does look a little peaky but Ive no time to be sympathetic to man illness now.Has he actually been sick?No.Im afraid that Olly will just have to get on with it.Take her temperature regularly, I instruct.If she doesnt look like shes getting any better by mid morning, call the doctor.Youre still going into college?he asks.Of course.That shouldnt even be a question.What else can I do?I bite down my impatience.I have to, Olly.How can I miss my very first day?He groans and sways a bit.Now I think hes putting it on.How can you leave us?Ill call Constance.Shell come up and sit with you for a couple of hours.Dont worry, he says.I swear hes putting that croak in his voice.Well manage.Its probably just a twenty four hour bug, I assure him.I rack my brain to remember what we had for dinner last night and whether Ive poisoned them both by giving them something to eat that was past its sell by date.But we just had oven chips and fried eggs, so I think Im in the clear.Stripping the bed, I put on clean sheets while Olly has a shower.I grit my teeth as much groaning emanates from the bathroom.By rights, its me who should be in there now.This was my master plan.Instead, I carry the sheets downstairs to put them in the washing machine, but when I eventually reach the kitchen, a bloodbath awaits me.Oh, no.Not today!Dude, whats happened?The dog bounces up and down, so pleased to see me and, therefore, puts more bloody footprints on the kitchen floor.On the work surface, the biscuit jar is up ended and there seem to be more than a few missing.It seems that Dudes attempts to have a biscuit frenzy also led him to upset the knife block and judging by the blood trail, it looks as if hes cut his paw on one of the knives.Bending down to examine it, I get licked all over my face for my trouble.Oh, Dude.Look at you.Manhandling my pooch, I manage to see that the cut doesnt look too bad in relation to the amount of blood hes managed to daub round the kitchen.More licking interspersed with whimpering.With a new J cloth, I bathe his paw and conclude, thankfully, that it doesnt need stitches.A vets bill on top of everything else would finish us off.Ive had to spend a hundred and fifty quid on the list of required materials to take in with me to college  something I perhaps should have expected, but hadnt.I tie Dude to the back door handle with his lead, while I set about mopping the floor with disinfectant and wiping down all the surfaces that have been customised with red paw prints.By now, according to Plan A, I should be sitting down to watch a relaxing ten minutes of Daybreak with my cup of tea and my bowl of Lidl muesli.Fat chance.When Ive finished cleaning the kitchen, I throw the dirty sheets and the two sicky pairs of Petals pyjamas into the washing machine before realising that I ran out of washing powder yesterday.Ill have to pop out in my lunch hour to get some.I release Dude from the door handle and feed him, then I find a bandage in the first aid drawer, which is always wellstocked due to Petals propensity for walking into things, falling over them, having them drop on her from a great height.I wind it round Dudes paw knowing full well that it will be chewed off in five minutes flat.I quickly make a sandwich  no disasters there  so that I can cut costs by avoiding the student canteen.Then, with the frantic realisation that time is running out, I dash upstairs to run round the shower.Olly is back in bed and Petal is beside him.Were going to stay here, he tells me.Until were better.Marvellous, I think uncharitably.Bloody marvellous.In the shower, no hot water left.Typical.All thoughts of an impressive hairdo, a quirkily different outfit suitable for an art student and maybe even some slap, go completely out of the window.Instead, I pull back my hair into a ponytail, bite my lips a bit to make them red and then throw on whatevers to hand that looks clean.I blow a kiss to Olly and Petal.If they have got something contagious I should try to keep my distance.Love you both, I say.Ill phone when I can, to see how you are.Olly groans and Petal bursts into tears.Dont go, Mummy,  she sobs.Dont go.Thats my heartstrings twanged to breaking point.I rush over to cuddle her, taking her in my arms and pressing her against my chest.Im a terrible mother for even thinking of leaving her.Go, Olly croaks.Youre going to be late.So I am.Ill be back before you know it, I promise Petal and she wails some more.With the sound of my daughters crying ringing in my ears, I belt out of the house, leg it down into town like a thing possessed and fly through the doors of the college at a speed that Usain Bolt would be proud of.But nothing can disguise the fact that Im late, late, late.And on my first day, too.I could weep.Without too much fuss Im pointed towards my classroom and dash in there, still out of breath and panting in the style of Dude.Everyone else is in there, sitting down, looking bright eyed and attentive, ready for action.I already feel that my morning has seen enough action to be going on with.All eyes swing towards me.An elderly, pinch faced woman stands at the head of the class.She looks as if she feels that life has dealt her a mean hand.Shes immaculately dressed, stylish but with an individual edge.She also doesnt have a hair out of place.The sharp glance at her watch tells me that my tardy arrival hasnt gone unnoticed.Good morning, she says crisply.So glad that you were able to join us.12      The rest of my week does not get any better.Nor the week after.Nor the week after that.I race home from college every night at five oclock, say hello to Olly and Petal and then race out again to get to my shift at Live and Let Fry by six.By the time I finish at ten oclock and the entire population of Hitchin is filled with chips, I am on my knees.Then I rush home to take over from Olly, while he goes off to do his night shift at the pizza factory.When hes not making high end, boxed pizzas, he swaps his beloved sixties gear for a black T shirt and ripped bondage trousers and sets off  hair gelled into mountainous, and possibly lethal, spikes  to do the punk gig that he bagged at a local bar.The brief peck on the cheek in the kitchen as we hand over the baton is the closest we get to a sex life.During the short window of time after closing Live and Let Fry and before I collapse into bed with exhaustion next to my darling daughter, Im also supposed to be wonderfully creative with artwork to take in for the next day.Its fair to say that my meals of late have been largely chip based.I m so grateful that Olly and Petal did only have a quickie stomach bug and were both as right as rain again within a couple of days.Is it bad that I dont have time to either be ill myself or to have my family ailing?It will get better, I keep telling myself.It has to.Because I cant really afford for it not to.Everything is riding on this and Ill let so many people down if I cant cut it  including myself.Plus, it seems that my main course tutor, Ms Amelia Fallon, has taken an instant dislike to me.Every time she talks to me she curls her nose up and I wonder if its because I am permanently surrounded by eau de fish and chips or if theres another reason for her distaste.It could well be that Im the only one on my course whos always late, always harried, always one step behind everyone else.But then Ms Amelia Fallon seems to have her own issues.She clearly thinks that in her day she should have been the next Vivienne Westwood or Nicole Farhi.I dont think she ever saw tutoring students at a local art college as her role in life, so I try not to think too many mean thoughts about her.Perhaps if she knew what was going on in my life she would be more sympathetic, cut me some slack.In my defence, I have been out of formal education for so long, that Im struggling to get back into it.The last time I was in a classroom was over fourteen years ago.Im distinctly out of practise.And I wasnt that great at it, even when I was last at school.It also feels like Im a hundred years older than all of the other students, which doesnt help.They all look so young and carefree, so fresh faced and impossibly trendy.They all look like they have no commitments, no significant other, no demanding four year old, no dog, no evening job at the chip shop.They all look like their mums still do their washing and ironing.They sit around together sipping coffee and gossiping, probably exchanging ridiculously creative ideas and I do not.During all of my breaks, I ring Olly and check that he and Petal are still alive and coping without me.During my lunchtime, I shop for food, pay bills and do all the stuff that real grown ups have to fit into their lives.At the chip shop my home made or vintage clothing makes me stand out as individual, kooky.Here I look as dated as my clothes and although I thought that art courses might attract individuals, all the other students look exactly the same.I know that I need to give myself a fresh image if I have any hope of blending in.But when?When am I actually going to fit this in along with everything else?Back in the room.Back in the room, Phil says, clicking his fingers.I laugh and jerk myself back into the present.I was away with the fairies then.Tell me about it.Luckily for me, we have a brief lull in the steady stream of customers needing their chip fix tonight.Thinking about tomorrows coursework, I lie.But now that I do think about tomorrows coursework, I realise that I still have to do it when I get home.Is it all going OK?Yeah, yeah.How can I tell Phil anything else when he is helping me to fund this new venture?Its fine.Very exciting.And it is.In some ways.Ive already learned so much  I can find my way round a decent camera now, I know the basics of screen printing, I can handle a glue gun and all kinds of other fun stuff.It would just be nice if I had a clone or two.One of me could then go to work and earn the money, one could look after the childcare and the dogs requirements, one could enjoy this course to the full, and the other one could produce fabulous, nutritionally balanced meals every night shortly before having wild sex with my other half.I am beginning to realise that one person can not hold all this stuff together.But how do I ever get out of this rut if I dont soldier on?Done the right thing?Oh, God, absolutely.This is the right thing.When Im not worrying about my snotty tutor or how young and silly my fellow students are, I love every minute of it.I adore the things Im learning and the fact that I feel like Im bettering myself.If only I had more time, I feel like my creativity would explode out of me like a volcano.Then watch out, world!Some more customers wander in and our conversation is curtailed, which Im relieved about.I dont want Phil to think that Im not enjoying it or that Im not supremely grateful.Half an hour later and were shutting up the shop together.You would tell me if there was anything wrong, wouldnt you?Phil says as he locks up and we stand outside on the pavement together in the cold night air.Yeah.Sure.Everythings fine.Its just that Im trying to cram a quart into a pint pot.Want a lift home?Thanks, but Ill walk.I could do with five minutes of fresh air.I set off home, walking through the old part of Hitchin and past my favourite shop.In the window of Betty the Bag Lady, the handbags glint in the moonlight.I have my foot in Bettys world now.One day I could be like her and be someone and do something.And nothing that happens is going to make me give up my dream.13      Why doesnt Mummy ever come home any more?Petal asked Olly.She does.Does not.They were in the kitchen making cupcakes together.Their cakes were safely out of the oven, golden and brown.Baking on a regular basis with his daughter had certainly brought out his own inner Jamie Oliver.Petal was standing on her pink plastic box so that she could reach the kitchen surface and his heart squeezed every time he looked at her.Four years on the planet and he still couldnt believe this beautiful creature was his child.She was the one amazing thing hed done in his life and he loved every hair on her head, every pout of her rosebud lips.A surge of joy went through him every time she called his name  except, of course, when it was three in the morning.Then he much preferred it if she wanted her mummy.The cakes were cooling nicely on a wire rack.Now they were at the critical icing stage.Put this water into the icing sugar.Gently, gently.He guided his daughters hand as she gripped the spoon, hamfisted.More than once theyd both been covered in a cloud of sweet white dust due to Petals exuberance.I want her to be at home, his daughter continued, trying out her extra whiny voice.Well, Mummys at college at the moment, sweet pea.Shes learning how to be a famous artist.Judging by the scowl on Petals face, it seemed that she wasnt overly impressed by this state of affairs.Though, if he was honest, three weeks into Nells course and he was beginning to feel exactly the same as his daughter.Does she still love us?Of course she does.And were baking these cakes to show how much we love her too.Petal took a moment to digest that and dipped her finger in the bowl of icing sugar to aid concentration.We dont put our fingers in the bowls, Petal.We do, Daddy, she corrected.Yes, we do.To prove it she scooped up another blob of icing and ate it with relish.Ah, well.Kitchen hygiene was overrated anyway.A certain amount of germs were good for you.He was sure hed seen Nigella doing the same thing on her TV show.That was probably where Petal was picking up her bad habits from.In his dark moments though, he did wonder where Nells sudden desire to change their lives had come from.Wasnt Nell happy with him any more?The thing that he loved the most about her was that she never complained, never whined, she just always got on with whatever life threw at her.Had he misread her all these years and instead of being content, shed been simmering away with unspoken dissatisfaction?They might not have money to burn, but they had a roof over their heads and food on the table  even though it was from the more bottom end supermarket chains.Was that really a problem?Maybe that just wasnt enough for the modern woman.Hed seen what ambition had done to his father.Hed been a builder out in all weathers, all hours of the day.When he did get home, hed shut himself away in the office and do paperwork until the small hours.As a child, Olly had rarely seen him.When he did, he never smiled and was always stressed.His bark wasnt always worse than his bite and sometimes hed have to move quickly to avoid a back hander.Olly realised now that it was just due to the pressure he was constantly under, but he didnt ever want to be a dad like that to his child.Throughout his childhood, theyd lived in a decent sized house and his mum and dad both drove top of the range Mercs.His dad had an ulcer by the time he was thirty.Hed died at the age of forty six.Keeled over with a heart attack while he was mixing concrete.Looking back, had his dads desire to make money at all costs been the right thing to do?Wouldnt it have been better for him to have eased back, had a little less money, but enjoyed life and stayed with them for longer?His widowed mother had sold the big house within months and now lived in Spain and he hardly ever saw her.Olly didnt want that kind of future for himself or his family.What colour shall we make the icing?he asked Petal.BLACK!I have pink, yellow or blue.Petal was clearly not bowled over by the feeble selection on offer.Blue, she ventured, somewhat reluctantly.Lets do blue.We also have sprinkles to put on top.Yay!she shouted.Sprinkles!Sprinkles!Sprinkles!Well, that had cheered her up considerably.If only grownup ladies were so easily pleased.14      When I get home, Olly and Petal are both lying flat out on the sofa in the living room, sparko.I tiptoe towards them, kneel down beside Olly and kiss him on the nose.It twitches in his sleep.Hey there, sleepyhead.I stroke his arm gently and he rouses.Whats the time?Time you were at work and time this little one was in bed.Olly pushes himself up.He looks completely shattered.I think he would have been there for the whole night if I hadnt woken him up.Im not the only one burning the candles at both ends.We both must have dropped off, he says with a shake of his head and a stretch.The last thing I remember is watching In the Night Garden.Petal might be too old for it now, but its still her favourite programme.Frankly, if they ever needed a stand in for Igglepiggle or Upsy Bleeding Daisy, then Im your man.I could recite every word off by heart.Ill take her upstairs, I say.We have made a rod for our own backs in that Petal always sleeps with me when Olly is working nights and that means, of course, that she wont settle in her own bed when hes not.I think shell still be sleeping between us when shes twenty five.I just hope she doesnt bring home too many boyfriends.Ill do it.Olly yawns again.He scoops our daughter into his arms.At least Petal is already in her pyjamas.Stick the kettle on, love.Another yawn.Coffee?Yeah.Nice and strong.Black.He throws his head back and groans.Need something to keep me awake all night.I go through to the kitchen and make coffee.Im going to need one myself if Im going to have any hope of doing my work for tomorrow, rather than give in to the overwhelming urge to go and slip into bed next to my child.I feel as if I havent seen her properly for weeks and Im missing my Petal fix.But theres a dozen different things I need to get on top of, so I put two good spoonfuls of full hit, instant coffee in the cups and hang the expense.The work to be handed in is stacking up and I feel as if Im slipping behind.I can appreciate that theres a lot to be crammed into this short year, but I wish wed started at a slightly more sedate speed so that I could ease myself into it.I wonder, does the pace let up at all as we get into the course or is it going to be flat out all the way?Its clear that Olly and Petal have spent the afternoon baking and I get an unwanted and unfamiliar twinge of jealousy that Olly is spending much more quality time with our daughter than I am.I sample one of the cakes and conclude that they really are very good.When Olly comes down, hes changed into his work clothes.A grey that was once white T shirt with The Beatles on the front and jeans with no knees.The scruffier he is the more I love him.He adds some cold water to his cup and gulps down his coffee.Got to fly.So soon?I wind my arms round his waist and pull him close.Oh, what I wouldnt give to lie in these arms tonight.He presses his face against my hair.At the weekend, he says.We can snatch some time together at the weekend.Ill hold you to it.He kisses me briefly and then leaves.I wander round the house aimlessly for ten minutes while I sip my coffee and I would so love to switch on the television and just lie on the sofa and watch something mindless, but I have a project to do for tomorrow and I havent even begun to think about it.Clearing a space in the middle of Petals toys, I settle on the floor and pull my bag with my college work in it towards me.My eyes are so heavy.I could just do with half an hours sleep, but its just not going to be possible.I must get this work done.Its for Amelia Fallon, my course tutor  she of the pinched face and the turned up nose  and I know that it doesnt just have to be good, it has to be marvellous.Dragging a cushion from the sofa, I plump it up and then stretch out on the floor, resting my head on it while I start some doodles.My eyes feel like lead weights.This level of tiredness surely isnt conducive to fabulous creativity.Coffee, coffee, I need more coffee.I shake myself awake and swallow the dregs from my cup.Ill just do half an hour on this and then Ill make myself another one.What seems like a minute later and Olly is stroking my hair.I open my eyes.Oh, God, I must have fallen asleep when I really didnt mean to.What are you doing here?I could ask you the same thing.Im still lying on the floor, head on my cushion, work  untouched  spread out in front of me.I hear myself groan.Surely he hasnt come back from his night shift already?Please tell me that I havent been here all night.Sadly, you have been here all night.I haul myself up.Every bone in my body aches where Ive been lying on the hard floor.He sits down beside me and I lean against him and start to cry.Im so tired, I tell him.So very tired.Dont go in today, Olly suggests.Go to bed.Catch up on your sleep.I have to go in today.Ive got an assessment with that old harridan whos my course tutor.She would just love it if I was absent for that.Im sure shed just love to mark up a nul points on my report card.I cant miss this.You can barely keep your eyes open, Nell.Nothing is that important.It is, I sob.Its important to me.He studies me and his face assumes a resigned expression.Then go and have a shower while I make breakfast.I glance at my watch.No chance of churning out a fabulous project now.Ill just explain exactly what happened to Amelia Fallon and the difficulties of my situation.Im sure shell understand.Wont she?15      Its not good enough, Nell, Amelia Pinched Face Turned up Nose Fallon says.Its really not good enough.Were sitting at opposite sides of her desk and I feel like I am five years old again and in trouble with the head teacher.Needless to say, I was late and my interview/interrogation has not got off to a good start.Outside the door I can hear the noisy buzz of the college, students chattering, feet clattering.In here it is silent, and about as comfortable as a tomb.I have just explained that I have not completed  not even begun  my latest project and to say that it has not gone down well, is something of an understatement.After an awkward amount of time has passed, Amelia folds her arms and leans forward.Her face is close to mine and I resist the urge to back away.She lets out a weary sigh.I am all the troubles in her world personified.Im going to have to ask you to leave the course.That hits me like a body blow.Leave?Im afraid so.She isnt afraid at all.I can tell that much.But whatever I had expected from today, this wasnt it.I thought she would complain, lecture, reprimand.I didnt think that she would simply truncate my dream.Im struggling to hold my tears in check, but this woman will not make me cry.When I find my voice, I ask, But why?She purses those hideous lips.Im not really sure that youre cut out for this.Your work is always late.Youre always late.When you do deliver the required projects, they arent really up to scratch.Ive been here a few weeks, I plead.How can you tell yet?Ive been out of full time education for years.It may just be taking me longer to get into it than the other students.I could be the tortoise to their hares.I cant be worse than any of those kids, I think.I cant.Really, I cant.On top of everything, I have a job to hold down and my daughter to look after.This only makes me think that you wont be able to manage at all when the pressure is really on.Im speechless.Do you think I should make allowances for you?When everyone else is coping quite nicely, you think you should be a special case?Yes, I want to say.Isnt that the point of your job?Arent you here to help me when its all going tits up?You should understand, more than anyone, that Im trying my best and this is probably more important, more critical to me than any of the other youngsters who have much more of their lives left to make mistakes, to realise their ambitions.I can arrange for a refund for you for the rest of your fees, she says without warmth.Thats the best I can offer.Dont I have the right to appeal?What I mean is, cant someone in this college help me?I cant only be at the mercy of this woman who has clearly decided to get rid of me simply because she can.Because shes bitter and twisted.Because she has some point to prove.Im afraid not.My tutor closes the folder in front of her that bears my name.Im history.Just like that.She stands up.Im to be dismissed.One day youll thank me for this.Im doing you a favour, Nell.Perhaps you need to rethink your plans.I simply think you arent good enough to make it in this world.That cuts me to the quick.I am good enough.Im sure that I am.I can prove that I am.I dont think so.Everyone deserves a second chance.But as she ushers me to the door, it seems that Amelia Fallon is unmoved.16      In a daze, I walk out of the college.For hours I wander about aimlessly trying to get my head straight and failing.My dreams, before they even got off the ground, have crashed and burned round my ears.Up by the busy library, I sit alone in the small and pretty Physic Garden thats right next door.I sometimes come to this place with Petal after weve collected new books for her to read.We both love it here.Its a quiet little oasis in the bustling town centre.Im surrounded by plants that are supposed to heal or provide succour  lavender, chamomile, St Johns wort.Today, they do nothing for me.I crush some lavender in my hand and breathe in the scent.Pretty, but my mind remains in turmoil.The wind whips up and I get so cold that my bones start to freeze and my brain goes numb.So I move on again.I dont really know where Im going, but I eventually find myself outside Live and Let Fry just as they are about to close up after lunchtime service, which is just as well as I dont want to go home while Im in this state.My eyes are raw from crying and I stumble inside.Constance is wiping down the tables and as soon as she sees me, she abandons her cloth and takes me in her arms.Nell, love, she says, frowning.What on earth is the matter?College, I sob.Ive been thrown off my course.Oh my goodness, she says, hand going to her heart.Is that all?I thought someone was hurt.Now dry those tears.Thrown off your course?She tuts.That can be fixed.She leads me to a table and sits me down.Then she calls out.Phil!Phil!Our Nell is here and she needs tea!Phil and Jenny appear from the back of the chippy.My bosss face falls when he sees me.Nell, love.He comes and slips into the seat next to me and puts his arm round my shoulder, which makes the tears that I just about had under control flow again.This place feels like my sanctuary, my home.Im loved here, not out on a limb.They dont think Im stupid, lazy, incapable.They dont tell me here that Im not good enough.Jen says, Ill make that tea.She disappears into the back once more.Constance hands me a napkin and I blow my nose into it.Now then, Phil says softly.Tell us all about it.I launch into my tale of how Ive struggled to keep up with the work, struggled to keep all of my balls in the air, struggled to make the one important person at the college like me, like my work.Oh, Nell, Phil says after he hears me out.We could have helped you out.Why didnt you say?We thought you were eating it up for breakfast.None of us knew you were struggling.Were your friends, Nell.I wanted to show you all that I could do it.Look where thats left me.My eyes fill with tears again.Dont fret, he says, patting my back.There are other courses.She thought my work was rubbish, Phil.She thought I was rubbish.What if I sign up for another course and they say the same thing?Then all my dreams, my hopes will be truly crushed.They wont, he assures me.Youre wonderful.Ive a good mind to go down to that college and drag that woman up here and make her look at what youve done.You were too good for them, thats the problem.I have to laugh at that.Its lovely to have friends who have such blind faith in me.Its not blind, Phil points out.We can see what your work has done.Shes the one who cant.Jen brings the tea and some chocolate digestives and we all dig in, gratefully.Shes probably just jealous, is Jens take on this.Youre young and fit and have the whole of your life ahead of you.Well, most of it.Shes a bitter old bag who probably hasnt had a decent shag in years.That makes us all laugh.If only life were so simple.But the long and the short of it is that, decent shag or not, she still had my future in her hands.And she decided that it was not going to be on her bloody course, come hell and high water.I put my head in my hands.So what now?Constance wants to know.Can I have my full time job back, Phil?Im going to be free at lunchtime now.I try to make light of it but inside my heart is breaking.No, Phil says.No.Im not having you back here.He sounds fairly adamant.Youre not giving up that easily, Nell McNamara.Oh, no.I cant face starting another college course, I tell him.Anywhere I went would be further away for one thing, and even more difficult to work round Petal.Not to mention the fact that my already shaky confidence, my self esteem, has been smashed into the weeds.Constance holds my hands.Phils right, love.Dont give up this easily.We need to come up with a Plan B.   Plan B could just be to stay working in a chippy for the rest of my life with my good and well meaning friends.Will you get any money back from the course?Phil asks.Full refund, I tell him.That offers some consolation.Phils money hasnt been completely wasted.At least thats not lost.Ill give it straight back to you.Otherwise I might be tempted to have a retail frenzy of the handbag nature to cheer myself up.Thats not what Im worried about, he says.I want you to keep it and put it to good use.He looks thoughtful as he chomps on his biscuit.Eventually, he declares, You have to set up on your own, then you can work hours to suit you.Its the only way.I cant do that.I dont know the first thing about running a business.Ill help you all I can, Phil offers.You know that.The money you get back from the college course can go towards start up costs.Start up costs?But what would I do?What have you learned on your course so far?Jenny wants to know.Not a lot, Jen, I admit.Ive only been there a scant month.A bit of the basics of screen printing.I know my way round a camera better than I did and I can handle a glue gun now.All great stuff, which Ive loved doing, but not that much practical to show for nearly a month of study.You could start up a company that revamps chippies, Constance suggests.She did that for a bit of fun, Jen says, and to help Phil out.What she really needs is to do something that shes got a passion for.They all turn to look at me, expectant.Handbags.Its out of my mouth before its gone through my brain.Handbags.I blink at the revelation and they blink back.Thats what Ive got a passion for.Brilliant, Jen says, applauding.Handbags it is!But I dont know anything about making handbags.Get on that internet then, love, Constance suggests.You can find out how to make anything on there, they must have a section on handbags.We all giggle again and I sigh with relief as the tension ebbs out of me.There are all kinds of grants for new businesses, Phil says.Once you get your plan together, Im sure youll be eligible for something.Plan ?Even the word terrifies me.Do you think?Youll never know until you try, love, Constance says.Youve got to give it a go.You cant give up at the first hurdle.What about if it all goes horribly wrong, like the college course?Im not sure my fragile ego could take another knock out blow.Do you think Alan Sugar would have given up at the first hurdle?I shrug.I guess not.Youve got a lot to think about, Nell, Phil says.But never forget that were here to help you.He squeezes my shoulder.Were your friends.I dont know what Id do without you guys, I admit.Now, I wipe my eyes on my sleeve, Id better get home as Im due back here very soon.In less than an hour to be exact.Ill cover your shift tonight, Constance says.You look exhausted.Normally, Id protest and insist that I carry on and think about how much we need the money, but I feel completely wiped out and emotionally drained.Plus, Constance has her not to be argued with face on.I would quite like a night in with Olly and Petal.Then thats what you should do.She pats my knee.Thanks, Constance.I kiss my friend gratefully.Thanks to you all.Go home, Jenny says.Or youll have us all blubbing.So I gather myself together and leave them to finish tidying up.I walk slowly towards my home and take my usual route past Betty the Bag Lady.Betty isnt in this afternoon, its her assistant whos on duty, so I stand outside and stare at the bags in the window.All of my life Ive loved them.Could I do this?Can I skip the whole formal training thing and go straight into doing something like this?My friends seem to think that I can, but then their confidence in me could be entirely misplaced.After all, I have absolutely no confidence in myself.17      Olly and I lie on the sofa facing each other like bookends, feet entwined, enjoying the rare night in together.He still looks rather shell shocked by my news.To be honest, Im not much different.My thoughts are scattered all over the place like seeds in the wind.On the one hand, Amelia Fallons nagging voice is in my head, filling my brain with negative vibes.On the other, it feels like a tiny little bud of something exciting might be blossoming in there too.Ill support you, whatever you want to do, Olly says.But starting your own business?Wow.I know.Its crazy.But crazy actually feels quite good.I thought I could perhaps design and make handbags.Maybe sell a few in Bettys shop.Youre not going to become rich and famous selling a few in Bettys shop, he quite rightly points out.Its a start, though.I hug the cupcake cushion to me.I can fit it in round my shifts at the chippy and see if it takes off.Phil said I can hang on to the money he loaned us.He thought there might be some business grants available too.Do you think I should go for it?Why not?Olly says.If you do it part time.As a sort of hobby.Yeah.Hobby, my arse.It wont be as mad as the last few weeks have been.I promise.I keep quiet about my budding plans to give Lulu Guinness a run for her money.Petal has missed you, he tells me.So have I.   He shimmies up to my end of the sofa and we lie along the length of each other, settling into the contours that are now so familiar.Hmm, Olly says.Remember when we used to do this as teenagers?Oh, yes, I murmur.I always had to watch where your hands were in case my mum or dad walked in.Oh, happy days, Olly says.His lips find mine and he holds me tightly.Then the door opens and, instinctively, I check if my clothing is in place.When are you coming to bed?Petal says, rubbing her eyes.I cant sleep without you.Olly rolls away from me.Petalmeister, what are you doing up?You should be in bed.So should you, our daughter says.Have you seen the time?Why is it that your children like to parrot back your own phrases to you?OK, Olly says.Were coming now.Scoot up those stairs as quickly as you can, otherwise youre in your own bed.Petal leaves the room in a whirlwind.Olly sighs.When did our lives become controlled by our child?When she was born, I remind him.Shall we go up?Were not going to get a minutes peace until we do.You go up, I tell him.I just want to do a few things.Maybe sketch out some ideas.After the last few weeks of struggling to be creative on request, I suddenly find that Ive got all kinds of things buzzing round my head.Dont be long, hun.I wont.He plants a lingering kiss on my head and goes out of the door.I get my college bag and pull out my sketch pad.I settle back into the sofa with it propped up on my knees and push away the yawn that wants to come.Its no good.Im way too comfortable.If I stay here, Ill only fall asleep.I take my pad and climb the stairs.Dude lopes out of the kitchen and quietly follows at my heels.Trying not to disturb my family, I creep into the spare room and, surrounded on all sides by Ollys beloved records, open the wardrobe.The dog curls up in the corner.My collection of handbags is neatly laid out in front of me.Frankly, its about the only bit of the house that is neat.Pulling out half a dozen, I lay them on the floor then tenderly slip each one out of its dust bag.Theres a striking black and white canvas bucket bag with a screen print of Judy Garland on it  still one of my favourites.Next to it theres a bag with bamboo handles and a bright tropical print featuring parrots and palm trees studded with sequins and beads, which was fantastic to wear when Olly and I used to have holidays that didnt involve a cramped tent or a caravan.The tiny shimmery gold affair with cream vintage lace was bought for my cousins wedding from a flea market and hardly ever gets an outing, even though its gorgeous.I might take it with me to the chippy tomorrow just to give it some fresh air.Theres also a pretty little cerise fabric one that looks like a flower and it has a big diamant sparkle in the middle.I dont think Ive used this since Petal was born either, as its only big enough to hold a lipstick and a tissue and these days I cant go out without a suitcase full of emergency gear.On the more unusual side, I have a green leather bag in the shape of a watering can, one thats made from two old vinyl records and one thats a recycled number plate.One is a red patent leather radio complete with moving dials and theres a big yellow teapot too.Petals favourite.Finally, my top treasure.My one and only Lulu Guinness bag.Olly bought this for me when Petal was born, at great expense.Its a slim clutch in black with a picture of a London bus and a woman in a sharp fifties suit with a nipped in waist embroidered on the front.Its my prize possession.If the house was burning down, Id first rescue Petal, then the dog, then this handbag.Im assuming Olly would be able to make his own escape.An hour and one chewed pencil later, and Ive roughed out two designs that give me a frisson of excitement all along the hairs on my neck.Dude snores away in the corner, paddling the air with his feet.In his dream he could well be chasing next doors cat with whom he has a hate/hate relationship.The entire house is asleep but me.I know that Im way too excited to settle tonight.Somehow I resist the urge to go into the bedroom and show these to Olly as Im sure he wouldnt be very enthusiastic after having his precious beauty sleep interrupted.I hold my designs out at arms length and try to regard them with a critical eye.Theyre good.No matter what the dastardly Amelia Fallon might think, I know in my heart of hearts that theyre good.18      Im in the offices of Best of Business and, accordingly, Im trying to look like a businesswoman.Phil was right.Even in these straitened times, there is still help to be had with setting up new businesses.I am classed as a micro entrepreneur in Best of Business jargon and am to be the future of our country.Jolly glad about that.I found out all about them from the library and when I called the helpline, I was offered an appointment for the next day.From there I was matched with my very own advisor to help me through the trials and tribulations of business startup.An official hand holder for the first year of my companys existence.Believe me; I feel that I need one as this all seems totally daunting.Theyve managed to hook me up with someone, they say, who has experience that matches my business perfectly.I do hope so.Best of all, theres no charge for his services for the initial period of a year.Nothing.This is equally good as Id never be able to afford it otherwise.Today, Im due to meet him for the first time.The offices are very posh  all glass, stainless steel and low lime green sofas.I dont think Ive ever been in a place like this before.Frankly, Im feeling a bit wide eyed and unworthy.Im glad that I spruced myself up.Today, Ms Nell McNamara, micro entrepreneur, is wearing a black dirndl skirt, red blouse and ballet flats.Im also carrying my Judy Garland bag  primarily because its the biggest one I possess and Im anticipating taking away lots of pamphlets.Sitting opposite me in an armchair that mirrors mine, is a man called Tod Urban who is to be my appointed mentor and its fair to say that Mr Urban is very easy on the eye.I had expected a business mentor to be staid, soberly dressed in the style of a bank manager.But he isnt.This mans wearing slim black jeans, a white T shirt and winklepicker shoes.His hair is showing some grey at the temples and its worn long, swept back from his face.I think some men get better with age  you only need to look at George Clooney (something I try to do as often as possible)  and I think that Tod Urban is also one of them.No need to be nervous, Nell, he says.His mouth curls into a warm smile.Just relax.Kick back.I fiddle with my handbag.Kicking back wont happen.Bolt upright is going to have to suffice.Were just going to have a chat, he explains.Find out what makes each of us tick.See if we can work well together.I nod.Come on, voice, make a reappearance!Shall I start by telling you about myself?How I came to be an advisor for Best of Business?Yes, please, I squeak.Well, Ive been in the fashion industry for longer than I care to remember.For the last fifteen years I was a buyer in the trade, Tod tells me.Before that, I was a designer working with people like Brit Connection, Nikki Dahly, Made with Love.All big designer names.Im impressed.And not a little over awed.Im semi retired now, he goes on.I think he can only be late forties, early fifties at a push.Young to consider retiring.I wanted to get out of the rat race.You know how it is.I can only nod.I think I may actually be trying to get into the rat race.I have a house in the South of France that I like to spend time at, so I do some consultancy work now and I usually mentor one or two people here at Best of Business at any one time.We should all give something back, right?Right, I echo.But I think that first I would actually like to take something out.I like to think that I could help you to avoid making the mistakes that I did when I started out.Thats music to my ears.Im so naive that I dont even know what mistakes I can make.Tod Urban spreads his hands expansively.So, he says.Im all yours.His smile is very disarming and I think Im getting a bit hot under the collar.How can I help?Im looking to start a business, I tell him, and really have no idea where to begin.He glances at the folder on his lap.Designing handbags, it says on my notes.Thats right.Any experience?I shake my head.Not in that line.But you do work now?In a chip shop.He roars with laughter.Quite a change then.I guess so.Well, I admire your ambition, Nell.If you want to know, I started out as a welder.It was the other blokes on the site who persuaded me to try something else.They could see that my heart wasnt in being on a building site for the rest of my life.Thats pretty much what the guys I work with in the chip shop have done with me, I admit.I gave the shop a makeover and they all said that I should try something else.Something more creative.He makes a steeple of his hands and studies me over it.As well as being creative, you know that youre going to need a lot of grit and determination.I think I have that.Plus some cash to get you going.That I dont really have, I confess.I only want to tap into Phils money as a very last resort.If I can give it back to him now, so much the better.Luckily, thats where I come in.Ill go through your business plan with you and see if we cant get you a grant or two as a kick start.Times are tough but, if we look hard enough, theres money to be had.I risk a smile.Is it really that easy?You have your business plan with you?Oh, Ive been a busy little bee in the last few days.Theres a track worn from my house to the central library and back.The computer Ive been using there is probably still smoking.Olly has been a trouper  as always  and has kept Petal entertained while Ive put together my business plan.How grand does that sound!Business plan, eh?The internet has been a godsend.What did we do before it?Sure enough, as Constance had predicted, I found that there were a million different sites all telling me how to not only buy handbags, but also how to make handbags, where to buy handbag supplies  in fact, everything I ever needed to know about handbags but was afraid to ask.This morning, on eBay, I managed to find a man  only a few miles away from us  advertising a surplus of finished handbag frames for a sum that, even to me, seemed as cheap as chips.They look as if they might suit my purpose just fine.Currently there are no bids on them and theres a mobile phone number listed.I jotted it down with a view to calling him later to see if I can buy them outright.As Tod waits patiently, I rummage in the depths of my voluminous bag and pull out the folder Ive taken such care in preparing.He takes it from me and scans the pages carefully.Looks good, he says, a few minutes later.Well go through this together carefully, step by step.But it certainly seems as if youre on the right track.He tosses the folder with my name on it to one side.The second time that has happened to me in a week.But this has a very different feel to it.Now on to important things.My new mentor slides his armchair next to mine and rubs his hands together.You have some designs with you?Just a couple.Nervously, I delve into my bag again and find my initial sketches.I feel sick at the thought that Tod might not like them, that he might tell me Im rubbish, that Im not good enough.Clearly, Amelia Fallons barbs have got stuck under my skin.Ive sketched out a large, rigid framed handbag with a diamant clasp and detachable shoulder strap, something simple and something very like the ones Ive found on the internet this morning.On the first one theres a drawing of a juicy piece of battered cod on one side and on the other some chips in a bit of newspaper.Both bags are silver and have hot pink satin lining and a Nell McNamara tag.I thought Id finish both bags with little sparkles of diamant.I pass the sketch to him.Tod laughs again when he sees them, but in a good way.Fabulous, he says.Really fabulous.This should give you a nice start.He holds up the designs.Pop art meets commercial irony.He nods his approval.Im liking it.I have no idea what he means but, clearly, he thinks its good.My other idea is a different design on the same basic frame  already I have an eye on the costs.This one has a pink cupcake on one side with Eat Me!written above it and on the flip side a blue beaker with Drink Me!Fun, Ted says.A lot of fun.He puts the drawings down.I certainly think youre on the right track here.You really think so?Without doubt.He rubs his chin.I think youre going places, Ms McNamara.Great name by the way.Are you planning to use that?Yes, I say uncertainly.I thought so.Excellent.Im thinking Anya Hindmarch, Loren Taylor, Orla Kiely.Nell McNamara is a name that says designer handbags.It is?His eyes rove over my outfit.The image is great too.I cant help but grin.Not only does he like my name but he seems to like everything about me.Up yours, Amelia Fallon!Now, lets have a proper look at this business plan and see if we cant get you some funding.So from art college reject to budding entrepreneur in one fell swoop.I think I like this mentor much better than the last one.19      Olly is already dressed in his punk gear ready to do his gig tonight and is wearing more eyeliner and mascara than I am.His face is pale, his lipstick red.Clearly, its not only Petal who likes to play with my make up bag.Ill be lucky if I get a look in soon.Theres a ragged black wig on his head.He currently appears to be channelling Robert Smith of The Cure and, strangely, I quite like the style.What?he asks.I smile at him.I was just wondering if I could love a man who wears more lippy than me.Needs must.As long as I dont start teaming it with a twinset and pearls and calling myself Olive at the weekends, youll be fine.Thank you, I say.Thank you for doing this.He shrugs.There are worse jobs.Im just hoping that no one I know sees me.Daddy, I like it when you look like a lady, Petal pipes up.There you are, Olly says.Seal of approval from the Petalmeister.I chew at my fingernail as he, Petal and I finish our plates of beans on toast.Promise you wont want to kill me  Olly looks as if he doesnt want to commit himself  but I really want to go and get those handbag frames from the eBay man before someone else nabs them.The cheque for the refund from my college course came in today and its already banked and in our joint account.I was planning on handing it straight back to Phil, but this is too good an opportunity to pass up and now the thought of it is burning a hole in my hot, little hand.Theyre a bargain, I remind Olly, in case hes forgotten in the five minutes since I last told him.What if theyve already gone?We should wait until we know if youve got any kind of grant or funding, Olly reasons.Its not a good idea to count your chickens before theyve hatched.
