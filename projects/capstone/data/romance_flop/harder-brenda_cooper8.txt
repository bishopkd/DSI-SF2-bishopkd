I like your hair.You want me to leave it long?Ill buy you some pearl combs.She smiles, resting her hands on my shoulders.I lift the hair away from her neck and kiss where it makes her shiver.Kiss her throat.Cup her breasts.She feels so good against me.Im too full, and touching her helpsjust the weight of her pushing my thighs down, the sight of her bare tits and her skin, her big brown eyes right on me.What else do you want?This time when she asks, it feels bigger, and my throat gets full and tight because I dont have any way to know.Other guys my agetheyve been figuring out the answer to that question for years.Theyve got interests and hobbies and talents and goals.Theyve got fantasies, ambitions, resentment when the world doesnt fall at their feet.I have no idea what I want, not beyond this moment, but this moment is expanding around us.This moment is endless.It ripples out, broadening with every movement of her hips as she rises and settles, rocking against my thighs.I want you to look at me, I tell her.She brushes her lips over mine.Im looking at you.Right at me, I say, gathering up her hair again, brushing the feathered ends up and down her shoulder blades, the column of her spine, making her arch and shiver.The whole time.Her smile is shy, her cheek warm against the back of my hand.The whole time implies duration.Mmm hmm.That smile.Duration of what?The whole time Im fucking you.She lifts her breasts in her palms and rubs her thumbs over the nipples, offering them to me.All right.Stand up.I peel off her socks and her tights.I ease my fingers beneath the elastic of her panties at each hip bone and slide them around and down, following the curve of her ass, tickling across the top of her upper thighs.Her pupils are bottomless black.She watches as I kiss her navel.As I lift her hands off my shoulders, link our fingers together, pull her arms behind, and capture her wrists loosely at the small of her back in one fist while I work her panties down to the floor.I stop wherever I want to test her flesh against my tongue.Firm and lean over muscle, stretched over bone, soft and yielding at her inner thighs.Her ribcage lifts under my hands, her nipples harden under my palms.I love her body, her face, her smile, the breath moving in and out of herlove her heartbeat and the way it quickens, the way she gasps when I lick over her nipple.I love her.Caroline Piasecki.I always will.Keep your hands there.Her mouth is slack, her gaze soft, her hair falling all around her.I pull it forward from the back to make a curtain around my head.Kiss her stomach.I hold her ass in my hands, wrists brushing her knuckles, suck her nipple into my mouth and draw on it, flick my tongue over it, rhythmic and fast, relentless.I can smell what I do to her.If I werent in the shadow of her hair, I could see the desire in her eyes on mine, the warm pink spreading across her upper chest, the flush on her thighs.I grip the backs of them.Move my head into the light so I can lick into the heat and the wet and the mess Ive made of her.Lick into the heart of her, thinking shes mine, she wants to be mine, and whatever it is she sees in me, thats who I want to be.The best in me.The version of me that deserves a woman like her, fierce and strong and smart and loyal.I could make her come, but I stop short of it, her hamstrings trembling.If I let her, shed buckle at the knees, drop her hands to my shoulders, slump into me.If I asked her to, shed lie back on the carpet.Shed move to all fours and turn around and present.Shed suck me.Pull me tight and hard until I came against her belly.Shed let me take her from behind with a tight grip on her hips even though she never comes that way, not unless I touch her clit.Shed let me shoot over her low back, striping over her spine, her ass, the whitest skin of her body.Thinking of everything Caroline would give me, I think of Rita Tomlinson.How she would direct me.Talk dirty to me, talk down to me, like I belonged to hermy fingers and my mouth her tools, the same muscles I used to carry her husbands golf bag available for her pleasure.Do it, she would say.Touch me.Take me.Harder.Faster.Now.I was never a person to her.The first girl I ever fucked took me in a shed behind the trailer park laundry.She stuck her hand into my shorts, and her palm was clammy hot.Her breath smelled like watermelon gum.I was hard and willing, but it wasnt like this.I liked it, what that girl did to me.What Rita did, I hated it, and I liked it, but I didnt choose it.Later, when I did choose, it was always fast and hard and impersonal.Carolines the only woman Ive ever touched like this.The only one whos been my choice.I dont want to see myself as the loser of a series of battles, all the odds stacked against me from day one, but its hard not to wish Id had more of this along the way.More love.More touch.More people who looked at me the way Caroline does, saw me like she does, asked me what I want.I touch the loose fists of her fingers, and she grips my hands tight.Bed, I say, barely audible.Get on the bed.She does as I ask, clearing away the books.I turn on the closet light and flip the overhead switch off so its quiet and dark and we can be just the two of us.She watches me strip.Watches me crawl up over her, strokes my arms and my shoulders as I lower down to my elbows to kiss her.How come youre so much bigger?she asks me.Landscaping.And lifting weights in Bos garage.Burning off frustration and hatred.Trying to get rid of the habit of her, the knack for hope Id picked up in Putnam.When I got off the plane and saw you, she says, I thought you were scary.I felt scary.She widens her thighs to bring me between them.Lifts her hips to rub hot swollen slickness over my cock.You feel good to me now.Thats all I want.To be good to you.Her hand curls over the back of my neck.Be good to me forever.I hope I get to.She lifts her knees.Tips up her hips.Invites me inside.We decide.You and me.I kiss her, my tongue delving into her mouth, my boundaries dissolving.She kisses me, her fingertips digging into my shoulder blades, nails biting crescent moons into my back.When I can stand to pull away, I back off so I can tell her, I dont think I ever made a decision on you.It got made for me when we met.Same here.Youll recall I fainted.Oh, I recall.You were over top of me, just like this.Thinking dirty thoughts.Mutual dirty thoughts.Even while you were passing out?I think I passed out from how dirty my thoughts were.I rest my forehead against hers, resisting the urgent message of my cock to make this happen now, now, now.She lifts her hips again.You said you wanted to get inside me.It was hot out.I said I wanted to get you inside.It sounded like the same thing.Another hint from her hips.Would you?Get inside you?Yes.We need a condom.Not really.Im on birth control.I didntIt wasnt like I tried to make you think.I wasnt fucking other women.Because you love me, she whispers.Because I love you.Its the first time Ive ever told her.She already knew, though.Shes known forever.I love you, too, West.After all that.You know I do.She tightens her arms around me.Come inside me now.She lifts.I thrust.Gliding, sinking, easy and hard at the same time, but perfect, because me and Carolinethats who we are.Thats the way were going to be.Deep, deeper.Hard, harder.Fast, faster.Clutching, gripping, grabbing, pulling, kissing, holding on.Theres nowhere to go and nowhere else we have to be.This is what I want.The first thing, the main thingthis woman in my arms, in my life.This woman next to me.As long as Ive got her, I can figure out the rest of it.I can do whatever Ive got to do and be whoever I need to be to keep her.Theres a reason they call it falling in lovebecause of the way it tips you ass over teakettle and then shakes your life up, hard.Dont get me wrong.Theres nothing like it.No better drug.No adventure more fantastic.But it changes things.It changes you.I got West back that November and fell in love with him all over again.It was like that Gravitron carnival ride where you stand against a wall and they spin you and spin you until the floor drops away and youre stuck there by centrifugal force.I never could stop myself from laughing on that ride.Id try so hard to peel my hand off the side, lift my arm, wave at my sisters across the way.My oldest sister, Janelle, always tried fancy stuff, walking her feet up, posing kind of silly.Alison would be white faced, scared.I would laugh until my cheeks hurt, slain by the hilarity of my own helplessness.It snowed early and often that winter, and West and I laughed so much.Talked so much.Fucked all the time, everywhere, completely helpless against the urge to put our hands on each other.School.Sleep.Food.Sex.West.I didnt have the strength for anything else.I was falling, swooping, drifting, whirling around.Laughing.When I finally hit the ground, I hadnt braced for the impact, but I was too dizzy, laughing too hard to care.I wouldnt have changed the ride for anything.When the phone rings, Im on Wests couch.Ive got a library book in one hand, Frankies head in my lap, and no way to reach my cell.Can you get that?I ask.She glances at the screen as she hands it to me.Its your dad.Oh.My stomach sinks, and Im hitting the answer button with my thumb when it occurs to me that the response has become ingrained.When my dad calls, its because he wants to talk about the case, and talking about the case makes me queasy.I drive to Des Moines and my pulse picks up on the interstate.I walk past my attorneys receptionist and start to sweat.Hey, Dad.Hi, he says.I wanted to warn you, youre going to get a call in the next day or two from a staffer at State Senator Carlisles office.Theyre interested You guys want to get Chinese for dinner?West has wandered in from the kitchen.I thought you were making Sloppy Joes, Frankie says.Were out of ketchup.I hate Chinese.You like those crispy things.Crab rangoon.Nuh uh.You liked them last week.My dads still talking.bill might come out of it, and she thought Well, what do you want?West asks.I want Sloppy Joes.I already said we dont have ketchup.So go get some.By the time I got back from the store, itd be Sorry, can you hang on a second?I slide out from under Frankies head and take my call into the bedroom.As I pass by West, he finally notices the phone in my hand and mouths the word Sorry.I shake my head to indicate its no big deal.As I step into his bedroom, I can hear him and Frankie resume their bickering.say she was talking on the phone?I thought you saw.Obviously I didnt.Whos she talking to?Her dad.Jesus, Franks, and you didnt think maybe we should The closing door cuts off the sound of their voices.I sit on the edge of the mattress.Okay, I say.Repeat that last thing you were telling me?Where are you?my dad asks.At Wests.Again?Again.I scoot on the mattress until my back hits the wall, and then I stick my legs underneath the hideous comforter.Ive slept here so many times now that its beginning to feel like my hideous comforter.My room.Cozy and familiar.Caroline.My father packs a million admonitions into the three syllables of my name.Lets not start this, okay?Some days, I wish Id never told him I was back together with West, because he will not let it go.West has always been and apparently will always be that boy to my dad.As in, That boy is all wrong for you, That boy is trouble, That boy is going to break your heart, and, lately, That boy is a distraction you dont need.The sister is there?he asks.Her name is Frankie, Dad.She lives here.Im not comfortable with it.You dont actually have to be.I was talking to Janelle, and Stop right there, I tell him.Return to the reason you called.Or I will hang up.That earns me another sigh, but it works.Dad tells me theres gossip on the judge grapevine that Senator Carlisle is looking at introducing a law to criminalize revenge porn.Someone told someone who told my dad that I might be contacted as an expert witness.Expert witness.The phrase gives me goose bumps.I want to be an expert witness.I know your instinct is going to be to help with this, he says.Normally, Id support that, but were in a delicate position with the case, and any testimony you share even informally might come back to bite us in the ass.If they find out that the Jane Doe in the suit is you I get it.Anything you say right now, Carolineanything that might become public he warns.No, right, I get it.If they call, Ill be careful.This is how lawsuits work: they limit your options, choke off your freedom to speak and act and be who you want, because you always have to be thinking about the jury in your future and how they might see your behavior.Im not sure who gave them your name, even, he says.We have to be cautious about your profile.This issues starting to get a lot of attention, and if you become a spokesperson, get known as an activist, that affects our options down the road.We want to Dad, I get it.Thanks for the warning.You can stop now.I can see him in my minds eye.Hes in his study at home, Im sure, feet propped up on his desk, fingertips pressing into one temple, forehead creased in a frown.Sighing.Okay, he says.Hows everything going with your classes?Classes are fine.You have everything you need?Yep.You should come down this weekend, he says.We could see a movie.I cant.Its the truth, but I probably would have said the same thing even if it werent.Ive got plans here.Thanks, though.All right.Well, call me if you hear from these people.OrYou know.If you need me for anything.I will.West cracks the door open, looks in to see if Im still on the phone.Ive got to go, Dad, I say.Okay.Goodnight, sweetheart.Goodnight.I hear him say, I love you as Im hanging up, but its too late to say it back.West sits down next to me.He slides his hand down my blanket covered leg and squeezes my toes.I wiggle them in his grip, relieved for no good reason that hes here.Everything okay?he asks.Yeah.He just wanted to warn me about a phone call he thought I couldnt be trusted to handle without his advice.You sound testy.I am testy.I thought Id established boundaries with my dad last year.I thought we had an understanding, but every time I turn around I have to remind him once more that Im a grown up now.And then there were those two words: expert witness.West drags his hand up my thigh.Me, too.Frankies driving me fucking nuts.Sorry.She doesnt do that with me.Because she worships the ground you walk on.Its a girl thing.I remember when I was her age, I was completely in love with my music teacher.She had long blond hair and wore silver jewelry and diamond studs, and she smelled like spicy perfume.I couldnt decide if I wanted her to be my mom or my girlfriend.She lived down the street from us and hired me to feed her cats when she was out of town.You dont even like cats.I know.But I spent hours in her house looking at all her stuff and thinking how I was going to have a place decorated exactly like hers someday, and I would dress like her and act like her.It would be impossibly glamorous.West gives me a once over.Im wearing jeans and a ratty sweatshirt.I put my hair in a loose ponytail right after I showered this morning and left it there.Some of its probably still wet.Impossibly glamorous, huh?Shut up.Your sister thinks Im glamorous.We both do.We cant help it.Youre the most glamorous creature either of us has ever met.I lean forward and shove his shoulder.He catches me under the arms and drags me over his body as he lies down.We end up crossways on the bed, laughing.When he tries to pull me close enough to kiss, I resist.Cmon, princess, he whispers.Cheer me up.In thirty seconds, your sisters going to be all, What are you guys doing in there?Eew!Gross!Knock it off!I know.We have to hurry up and do something really gross before she notices.He tugs again, and I let him kiss me.His mouth is soft, his tongue hot and demanding.It takes about four seconds for me to forget why Im supposed to be resisting his demands.Four more to get over my grumpiness.I feel a slackening around my breasts and his hot palms move beneath the bra hes just unfastened.He cups my breasts, making my nipples ache.The damp surge of need that follows makes me moan.When Frankie knocks on the door, Im far enough gone to be startled.I jump, and West pinches one nipple hard, which makes me hiss.Shh, he says.His other hand tightens on my ass, fingers digging low and deep and dirty, making the ache between my legs worse.West?Frankie calls.Are you ordering Chinese or not?Im hungry.Shes evil, I whisper.I tilt my hips and grind against his erection.Hes so hard.If his sister werent here But his sisters always going to be here.I know, he whispers back.Im a complete failure as a parent.Frankie bangs on the door again.You better not be doing anything gross in there!Do you want Chinese?he asks me.Im fine with it.Yeah, but what do you want?I smile down at him.Rub myself against his erection.That.Grinning, he asks, What do you want that you can actually have before Franks goes to bed?To finish my reading.You want me to keep her out of your hair?Nope.Youll tell me if she is.Ill tell her if she is.Remember?I deal with Frankie and me.You deal with Frankie and the rest of the world.She pounds on the door again.West?Im starving.Lay off, will you?he calls.Well be out in a second.What are you doing in there?Putting away laundry.And Im the Queen of Sheba.He lifts an eyebrow and whispers, Queen of Sheba?Where does she get this shit?School?He takes me by the hips and lifts me off him.I better order.You want chicken fried rice and an egg roll?Yep.And an orgasm.He sits up quick and kisses me hard.By the time hes done, Im breathless.Make that two orgasms.West flops down on the bed again, raking his hand through his hair.Its long enough now that it sticks up when he pushes his fingers through it, which means its pretty much always sticking up.You and me both.How many hours until bedtime?Four.I look at the clock.Five, I bet.She hasnt been to sleep before ten all week.He looks at the door.He looks at my shirt.Specifically, he looks at my nipples, then rubs his thumb back and forth over one.Back and forth, until I feel as though Im turning to lava between my thighs.Youre killing me, I whisper.No, he says.Im killing me.Then Im on my back again, and hes over me.Keep quiet, and Ill give you that first orgasm right now.Im about to tell him its not happeningnot with his sister hovering out therewhen he pulls my knee up and rocks into me, hard.Oh.God.Its so happening.If youre not out in five minutes, Im going to eat at Rikki and Lauries, Frankie says through the door.Ill tell them you starved me.Ill say youre locked in the bedroom making dirty noises, and West picks up a book off the nightstand and throws it at the door.Hey!Frankie shouts.Well be out when were done with the laundry, he says.Fine.I hear her footsteps retreating down the hall.We really should go, I say, but its completely halfhearted.I cant make myself mean it, because his eyes are blue in this light, dark and intent, and his hand is moving under my shirt.In a minute.One minute?Maybe two.You cant make me come in two minutes.Watch me.His thumb finds my nipple again.My eyelids droop.I cant keep them opennot when hes touching me like this.Kissing me this way.Not when hes unsnapping my jeans, lowering the zipper, finding me hot and wet and making me hotter and wetter.He whispers dirty promises in my ear, licks and sucks me.He finds all my weak spots and exploits them.Ninety seconds, he says after I come.Theres laughter in his voice.Easy.Dont call me easy, I rasp.I sound so weak and soft, exhausted as though Ive run a marathon when all Ive actually done is breathe hard, tighten up against Wests fingers, and bite down on the noise while he makes my body sing.West chuckles, clasping my wrists in his hands and collapsing on top of me.Weve only got thirty seconds left before Frankies back at the door, but theyre sweet.So sweet.By the time I get off the phone with the senators aide, Im smiling.This is the third time Ive talked to him this week and the first call when I felt like I was making solid progress.How are my toes coming along?I ask Frankie.Im doing the second clear coat.Sweet.She concentrates on the motions of the little black nail polish brush.I look up at the kitchen ceiling, walking back through the conversation.I forgot to talk to him about fraud.All those sites that take customers money with the promise of wiping their reputations onlinesomeone needs to stop that.I lost a bucketload of Wests money to one of them.And I need to see if Whos Jane Doe?Frankie asks.Hmm?Whos Jane Doe?It takes a minute for my attention to settle on the question.It depends.Its a name the government uses when they dont know who someone is.Like, if you find a dead body and cant identify it, if its a man, its John Doe, and if its a woman, you call her Jane Doe.But in legal cases, you use those names for when the victim wants to keep her identity a secret.You told that man on the phone not to use the word victim.I did.I like the word target better.But usually when we talk about crime, we talk about perpetrators and victims.Carefully, she brushes polish over my big toe.So you were a victim, but you dont want anyone to know?Well, not exactly.But youre Jane Doe.Thats what West said.For me its just a strategy, I tell her.Its a way of keeping the records of the case sealed.Frankie puts the brush back into the bottle and twists the cap closed.I wish I could do that.Do what?Make it so no one knows about Clint.Is he still bothering you?No, he stays away from me now.He has to.But when Mr.Gorham came to our class to talk about bullying, I think it was kind of like Jane Doe?Because he didnt use my name or anything, only everyone knew he was talking about me anyway.I wish I could justI dont know.Erase what happened.Start over.I know how you feel.So much of last year, I wanted to erase what happened to me.But you know, I say carefully, when bad stuff like that happens, sometimes it can be good, too.Like, last year, this guy I used to care about, he wanted me to feel like I didnt matterlike I was a bad person, and I deserved bad things to happen to me.So he did something to embarrass me online.And it worked.I felt awful.But then I figured out that he was wrong about me, and that he was the one who had a problem, not me.And it made me stronger.How?Its hard to explain.I guess its that I dont think anyones ever going to be able to do to me again what that guy did.Im sure Ill get hurt other ways, but not that way.I dont realize until after the words are out of my mouth that Im not just talking about Nate.Im talking about West, too.If it werent for Nates attack, I wouldnt have been able to deal with what West did to me in Silt.But I can deal with it.Because Im stronger.Im different.And Im glad for it.You know what I figured out?I ask.That only I get to decide what my actions mean.Only I get to choose how I feel about who I am and what I did.I get to define what Ill accept and what I wont.And that goes for you, too.Youre in charge of your life.She wrinkles her nose.West is in charge of my life.Hes in charge of keeping you alive and fed and all that, and making sure you have a chance to learn stuff and become a good person.Youre in charge of everything else.And you know, what Clint did, that sucks.It should never have happened.Im sorry it did happen.But the thing to remember is, he was the one with the problem, not you.You were the one who fought back.Not in the most constructive way possible, I think we can agree She cuts me a glance.Smiles when she sees Im smiling.but you know you have it in you.You can stand up for yourself and take down the guy whos threatening you.And that has to feel pretty good, right?Frankie nods.Hes afraid of me now.Awesome.Just so long as you dont use your mighty fists again, right?Right.Frankie tilts her head, thinking.Is the guy who tried to hurt you afraid of you?I see it in my headNate passing me on my way home from class.Glancing to the side so he doesnt have to meet my eyes.I think he kind of is, actually.But what matters to me even more is that Im not afraid of him.I wiggle my toes.Are these done?Yeah, but you cant walk around for a while.You want to make some popcorn?Movie style?Is there any other way?No.Youll have to do the hard work, though, I say.Since I cant move.I know how.Frankie skips over to the cabinet to get out the air popper.Skips.I wish West could see her.Ill tell him later tonight, when he gets back from working with Laurie.Ill tell him all of this, because it will help remind him that even though shes struggling, his sister is amazing and resilient.So am I.  Bridget uses tongs to pick four hard boiled eggs out of the bowl on the salad bar.Can you make some for me?I ask.Sure.She adds three more eggs.Are you going to do a sandwich?Maybe just on crackers.Okay.Pick me up some bread, and Ill get the mayo.Its halfway through December, and were in the dining hall, grabbing lunch between classes.This has been our Wednesday thing since freshman year, and even though were both off the meal plan, eating most of our meals at the house, we still do Wednesdays.Or we try to.I missed last Wednesday because I had to go to Iowa City for depositions with my lawyer in the afternoon.Those werent too bad, but this morning I had to get up at the ass crack of dawn and drive to Iowa City again, this time to be deposed by Nates legal team.November belonged to West, although I spent a couple days with my dad at Thanksgiving.December belongs to the case.You want me to get your drinks?Bridgets scooping low fat mayo into a bowl.Yeah, maybe two waters and a skim milk?The dining hall uses these tiny glasses, so you have to take three or four to get enough liquid.I carry the drinks, bread, crackers, and the bowl of soup I got on the line over to the table by the window where Bridget and I like to sit.Shes already there, mashing up hard boiled eggs with a fork.Theres a pile of finely diced dill pickle on a plate.I slide into my seat and reach for the celery stalk.I dice with a butter knife, remembering the first time I saw her make egg salad with ingredients off the salad bar.It was just a few days into first year orientation.I was so glad, then, to have been assigned to Bridget by the housing gods, because here was a girl with ideas.Here was a friend who was smart and kind and matched to me in every way that mattered.She finishes mixing mayonnaise into the bowl of eggs.I can take that celery.I pass her the plate, and she tips the diced celery in, along with the pickle, salt, and pepper.How was your lawyer thing?she asks.Horrible.What was it like?They asked me every question fourteen times, and most of the time I wasnt allowed to answer.When I was, I had to say whatever one thing Id rehearsed with the lawyer, and then Nates lawyer would say something to make it sound like I was a crazy slut.God.I know.But it was exactly the way my dad told me it would be, so I knew what to expect.Does that help?What?Knowing what to expect?I shrug, because the cry pressure is building behind my eyes, and I should be tougher than this.I am tougher than this.It just turns out that when smart, rich guys in suits spend hours asking you questions designed to make you feel like a crazy slut, its really hard not to start feeling like a crazy slut.Youre not a crazy slut.We dont even believe in sluts.I know.But its still hard.Its, like, superhuman difficult.Did you cry?In the car on the way home.But not in front of the lawyers?No, but only because we took two breaks so I could pull myself together.Cant you get out of doing this?Only if we withdraw the suit.But youre not thinking about that.I dont know.I dont know if Im thinking about it.I havent let myself think about it.But I keep hearing what Frankie asked me.So you were a victim, but you dont want anyone to know?It feels wrong.Ive always believed I could do whatever I put my mind to, but if I want to get into law school with my sex pictures on the Internetif I want to get through law school and out the other side, to practice and advocate for social justice, to run for office and become a legislator and change the world for the betterwhat do I have to do to make that happen?My dad says this is what I have to do.Push through the suit.Wear the Jane Doe straitjacket.Im not so sure anymore.At the long table to our left, a big group of students bursts into laughter.I have to swallow, because my throat hurts.I wonder if Im coming down with something.Caroline?Bridget reaches across the table to cover my hand with hers.Why are you doing this when it makes you so unhappy?I swallow again.My throat aches, and my eyes fill with tears.I dont have an answer.I wake up in the dark.The clock reads 2:48 a. m.  West is plastered against me, and hes way too hot.The air in his bedroom is dry from the space heater running in the corner.I have one nostril thats completely blocked, and the other is so desiccated I can only inhale a thin stream of overwarm oxygen.Theres no way Im getting back to sleep.When I try to wiggle out from under his arm, it tightens for a second.Where you going?His voice is husky with sleep.Just out to the living room.You need me to rub your head?Its my favorite way to fall asleepWests fingers rubbing circles over my scalp.Maybe later.I have to pee anyway.Come back soon.I will.After I visit the bathroom, I stop in the kitchen for a glass of water, then pad out to the sofa.I wrap myself in the ratty afghan on the couch and sit in the dark.Untethered, my mind wanders.I pluck at the holes in the ratty old blanket, which I suspect Wests grandma must have knit in the 90s.Its got the color palettemaroon and forest green.In the bedroom, I hear West turn over, rustling the covers.I think about the depositions.How terrible they made me feel.I curl into a ball under the blanket and close my eyes.A spring creaks.Seconds later, a telltale floorboard groans, and then I hear water running in the bathroom.By the time he comes into view, Im sitting up again.Hes got nothing but boxers on, which seems crazy for December, but Wests internal furnace runs hotter than mine.He scratches his stomach.Scoot over.When I do, he sits down sideways and positions me between his outstretched legs.Pillow.I hand him one.He sticks it behind his head, wraps me in his arms, and leans back, pulling me down with him, my body wedged between the couch and his skin, my head resting in the nook beneath his shoulder.He feels good.He smells good.Its so good being with West.I wish I could explain to my dadto anyone who thinks I dont belong with this manhow I feel in moments like this one.Moments when the rightness of the two of us expands inside me, pushing out against the walls of my chest until what Im experiencing is so much more than I can put in words.Gratitude.Satisfaction.Contentment.I dont know how to say it.There isnt any way.Theres just this big, blissful feeling that I want to spend the rest of my life in.West kisses the top of my head.Pull that blanket up, would you?I raise it to cover my shoulders and his stomach, and then from underneath I tuck it in along his side, pushing a few inches of blanket beneath his thigh, his stomach, his upper arm.I like to fuss over him, but not too much.Just a little bit, where he might not notice and get spoiled.Sorry I woke you up, I say.Sokay.Whats going on in your brain?Too much, apparently.Yep.He shifts his shoulders, settling us deeper into the couch.Tell me.I talked to Paul again today, I say.Remind me whos Paul?The senators aide.Oh, right.So, I dont know.I was just thinking about it.Not about him, but more about what its like when Im talking to him.I feel likelike there are things I can tell him that no one else is going to.Things he doesnt getdoesnt understand properlybut I can change his mind.About revenge porn?For starters, yeah.I think its getting so I could change almost anyones mind on that, if I had a clear shot at it.If they arent, you know, a prejudiced jerk or whatever.I bet you could.And this is going to sound dumb, but I feel a little bit like I was born to do that.His reaction is an exhale across the top of my heada huff of pleasure and amusement.Maybe you were.I twist so I can see his face.Maybe I was, West.His eyes hold mine, steady and calm.Theres no mocking in them.He runs his hand up and down my back beneath my T shirt.His palm is warm on my bare skin, but his eyes are warmer.So sure of me.He wants me to talk to the media, I confess.Who, the aide?I guess the senator.They think their best shot at getting this passed is to start with a public education phase, and they want to set up interviews with major newspapers and some of the morning shows on local news in Des Moines and Iowa City, the Quad CitiesThey want to put a face on revenge porn in Iowa.Your face.My face.Makes sense to me.Youve got a beautiful face.My dad would shit a brick if I said yes.Yep.But I was thinking You were thinking you were gonna say yes.I smile a little.I cant help itits nice to be known.I love that he knows me.I want to.Whats the point of suing Nate, spending all this money trying to destroy Nate, if it means I cant do any of the other stuff I want to do?Theres no point, right?Right.He squeezes me tighter.We lie there like that for a while, just breathing.Wests hand warms the base of my spine.What do you want, baby?he asks.Right now?No.Down the road.Ten years, twenty yearswhat do you want?I hitch my leg up over his stomach and snuggle closer until Ive got my face in his neck.I tell his throat, his pulse, I want to be president.His heart beats, steady and strong.I can feel him, alive against my lips.Ive never said that out loud before, I admit.Not since I was a little girl and Janelle told me women dont get to be president, and that even if they did, I would never be the president because just how special did I think I was anyway?And she was right.I get it, how impossible it is.Even then, I got it.So I stopped saying it out loud, and I kind of stopped letting myself think that far ahead.I just think about, you know, law school, getting a job after, working my way into local office.But thats not where you want to end up.No, I want to end up in the White House.And I know I dont have a great shot at it, because nobody does.No woman does.And even if every other star in the universe lined up for me, with what happened last year, its probably impossible.The way the world is Caro, he says.Yeah.Stop telling me why you cant have what you want.My cheeks are hot.Im breathing fast, just from admitting such a deep, foolish hope to him.From trusting him with that.There are a lot of reasons why I cant have it.Well, yeah.But if you want Pennsylvania Avenue, baby, you should go for it.You think?Fuck yeah, I think.Youre smart and strong and gorgeous and talented.Youre a leaderI always believed that.You need to do your leader thing, and that means you take what happened to you last year and you use it to change the world.Beat people over the head with it if you have to.Talk and talk until the worlds got to listen.And then if you want to be president, what you have on your record is what happened to you and what you did about it.Nothing to be ashamed of.His words wash over me like warm water.They wipe me clean, leave me pure and righteous.Because what he saidthats just exactly what I want to do.Just exactly how I want my future to be.Its so big, I say.It scares me.Theres nothing wrong with being scared.Being scared keeps you sharp.And anyway, you can break it down to one ballot at a time.Youve got my vote.Thats good.Only 126 million to go.I have faith in you.I wriggle up and kiss his jaw.Youre sweet.He takes my cheek in his hand and traps me with his eyes.Hes so solemn.I can see how much he wants me to hear him when he says, Im not doing you a favor, Caro.My heart is full and my lungs feel bound up tight with love and gratitude, fear and promise.Im glad you told me, he says.I am, too.I am, because now I know what comes next, and it doesnt seem to matter that it will be hard.Its just the thing Ive got to do.I have to settle the lawsuit, I say.It makes me feel like shit, and it sucks up all this time and resources.I dont think theres any point to it.When I go home for Christmas, Im going to tell my dad.He smooths his hands over my hair.Okay.And Im going to call Paul back and tell him Ill do the media stuff.Maybe I can do an interview for the school paper and the paper in town.I could write some pieces for online, too.Salon, or HuffPo?Ill have to look around at where I might be able to do a personal essay kind of thing.Or else He pushes on the back of my head, brings me down to his mouth, and kisses the words off my lips.What was that for?I ask.You were getting loud.I dont want you to wake Franks up.I wasnt getting He kisses me again, and he does it so well that Im smiling when I stop to breathe.Liar.Not to you, he says.You just wanted to kiss me.That makes him smile.Got me there.This time, its me who kisses him.My excitement becomes our excitement, the kiss sinuous and liberating, like running fast and falling down in the grass and looking up at the spinning sky.I want to tell him more.Tell him everything I ever hoped for.All the ways Ive let my ambition be taken from me, yanked from my fingers like so many papers flung onto the floor, scattered around my feet.Sooner or later, Ill tell him everything.He lifts me and carries me down the hall to our room.The blanket falls to the floor when he locks the door, but Im not cold.Not with his body over me, his eyes on mine, his words inside me.Youve got my vote.I think, fleetingly, that the reason I dont need vengeance is that I have love.Vengeance doesnt give you anything.It doesnt fill you up or soothe you, satisfy you or change you.And even if it did, I dont need that, because my heart is already full.Wests hands are on my ass, his lips on my neck, at my throat, on my collarbones, moving down.Hes teasing me, smiling and calling me Madam President, pulling my shirt off over my head and licking his way down my chest.
