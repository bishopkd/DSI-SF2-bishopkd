And I played tennis and was a flautist in the band.I knew it, he said with a delighted laugh.Nerd!Yeah, well, takes one to know one.My annoyance had faded and I was quickly becoming aware of just how smitten I was with Nicholas Cooper.His persistence paid off because before I knew it, I was telling stories about my childhood.He laughed heartily when I told him about the time that Tim and I ran away from home but returned an hour later because we were hungry and forgot to take food with us.We both laughed as I recalled my short lived stint in the marching band, removed after tripping over my own feet and knocking down the school mascot.We were both reluctant to leave but the wedding was only an hour away and we still needed to change.When we stood, sand clung to our clothes and Nick helped me brush it from my pants.I was very conscious of the feeling of his hands skimming over my body.It took a lot of will power not to jump him right there.Nick mustve agreed because he said, We could always skip the wedding.They probably wont even notice if I dont show up.I thought this was a good friend?Nick shrugged.I have other friends.Nice try, I said, grabbing his hand and tugging him away from the water.Im not going to be responsible for the end of your friendship.Youre not even going to like Craig when you meet him.Hes rich and smug.I dont even like him most of the time.Its not going to work.Were going to your friends wedding.I stopped walking and kissed Nick on the cheek.Dont worry, we still have the rest of the weekend for us.Nicks face turned serious.I really hope we have more than just this weekend.Me, too.Saturday, October 10th The Daily Scandal Washingtons #1 Source for Breaking Political News and Politicians Making News Area politicians will be spending their weekend attending the wedding of billionaire Craig Bender.Bender made his money and claim to fame on Wall Street, and had previously worked with D. C. s mayor, Brad Hutchinson.The mayor is expected to be in attendance as well as many other distinguished businessmen and politicians.A friend of Benders tells us that Senator Cooper will also be among the illustrious attendees and that it is expected he will be accompanied by the same woman he was spotted with multiple times this week.Will these two lovebirds be making their own wedding plans sometime soon?FOUR There are a lot of rich people here.I looked around the parking lot at the other men and women that were headed toward the chapel.One gentleman looked familiar.Is that our mayor?Yes.Nick didnt sound surprise.Why is that not a big deal?Hes practically a celebrity.After I said that I realized how ridiculous it sounded.Nick himself was even more famous than the mayor.Craig and the mayor were roommates in grad school.They worked together on Wall Street for years.I would be more surprised if he wasnt here.Nick took my hand and led us into the crowd that was headed inside.Wait, I whispered loudly.Is your friend Craig Bender?The Craig Bender?The billionaire?Yes.Way to bury the lead, Cooper.I glanced around, nervously trying to determine if I fit in with rest of the attendees in my off the rack dress.Inside, the chapel looked like a miniature version of a royal wedding.Diamonds sparkled like stars in the night sky.We slid into a pew near the back and I leaned close to Nick.This was a bad idea, I said in a hushed tone.I dont belong here.Nicks face registered confusion.What are you talking about?Of course you belong here  youre my guest.You shouldve brought someone else, I insisted, fiddling with the hem of my midnight blue dress.Someone fancier.Prettier.Richer.Nick rolled his eyes.Fancier and richer are overrated qualities in a woman.Well, fine.Prettier then.My eye caught site of a woman that had likely been a swimsuit model at some point in her life.Nicks arm went around my shoulder and he pressed his lips to my ear.Ive never seen a more beautiful woman in my life.I was about to tell Nick that I thought he was full of shit, but the organ struck up the bridal march and there was nothing I could do but relish in the lingering warmth from his breath on my ear.By all accounts, it was a normal wedding.Not average in anyway, but normal.Unflattering bridesmaids dresses, an obviously drunk groomsman, and a beaming bride.If the brides dress hadnt cost more than my car, I couldve almost forgotten that the groom was one of the richest men in the country.The pastor gave the usual speech about marriage being the union of two people and I stifled a yawn.When the couple began to exchange their vows, Nicks arm tightened around my shoulders and his breathing quickened.It occurred to me that this was probably the first wedding he had been to since his engagement had ended.I placed what I hoped was a comforting hand on this thigh and he let out a low sigh and squeezed my shoulder.I dos were said and rings were exchanged.The whole ordeal lasted less than twenty minutes but it felt much longer.We joined the other attendees in a round of warm applause while the newly married couple swapped some spit in front of all their loved ones.The whole thing was sickeningly perfect.I wanted to check in with Nick to see how he was holding up but as soon as we stepped outside we were surrounded by people that wanted to say hello to Senator Cooper.I stood by his side and smiled politely, shaking hands and making polite conversation.Fortunately, they werent there to see me.Nearly all the conversation was directed at Nick and he responded to it in perfect political form.By the time the crowd scattered to find the nearest bar at the cocktail hour, my cheeks were sore from all the awkward smiling.That was intense, I said as we walked back to the car.Welcome to my life, Nick responded with a grimace.Everyone hates politicians until they need something.Then theyre the most popular people in the room.We drove to the reception in silence.Nick was still tense and I couldnt think of anything to say that wasnt a comment on the wedding  the very topic I was trying to avoid.Since the town was so small it only took us two minutes to drive to the reception but I was still anxious to get out of the car.Drink?Nick said as soon as we walked into the lobby.An open bar was up and running just feet from the entrance.I nodded and he took off without asking what I wanted to drink.Without Nick by my side, I felt very out of place in a crowd of people that all knew each other very well.I rocked on my heels and twisted a strand of hair between my fingers.Charley, right?We met back at the chapel.I whirled around and found a woman that looked vaguely familiar holding out a dainty hand for me to shake.Of course, I said, though I barely remembered meeting her.Diana, she said helpfully.Im friends with Craig and Nick.We went to college together.I tried to form some kind of coherent thought but words escaped me so I nodded instead.Im so glad Nick found a date to this circus.No one should have to face this alone.Diana made a face like she smelled something rotten.Plus now hell look less pathetic.So you and Nick are close?I wasnt sure yet if I liked Diana, but she certainly was honest and I could appreciate that.Sure.He introduced me to my husband, Peter.He was best man at our wedding.This time her face emoted pity.Its a shame what happened with Heidi.She really did a number on him.Hes been so pathetic since the break up.Dating those slutty bimbos.Present company excluded, of course.Of course.My mouth suddenly felt very dry.I see youve made a friend, Nick said, handing me a drink.I ignored the remark and took a grateful sip.Beer?I took a guess.Nick continued to ignore Diana.Would you like something else?No.Beer was a good guess.I smiled and took another sip.Nick nodded, pleased that he had guesses correctly.
