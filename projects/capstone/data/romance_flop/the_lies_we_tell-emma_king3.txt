Come on.You can trust me.I exaggerated a wink.What really happened with the fianc?Did you get caught cheating?Wow.Thats an extremely personal question.Nick tried to act offended but he was two drinks ahead of me and feeling good.Thats not something I usually talk about on a first date.This isnt a date, I reminded him.This is an imprisonment.Drinks.Awkward conversation.Hotel room.He ticked each item off on a finger.Sure sounds like a date to me.Im beginning to see why you arent engaged anymore.I finished off my drink in one big gulp.We both looked up in surprise when the bedroom door opened.We hadnt seen any activity from the room in quite a while.Agent Flynn stepped out of the room looking like he had aged ten years.His hair was disheveled as if he had been running his hands through it and his tie was crooked.You two are free to leave, he said through tight lips.An agent will drive you home, and well escort you through the back exit.Thats it?You arent going to tell us what happened downstairs?The indignation in my voice surprised even me.An individual was apprehended as he approached the Vice President with a weapon.Thats really all you need to know.That doesnt explain why you had to keep us trapped up here all night.When I stood up, I wobbled slightly.I wasnt sure if it was from the drinks or from not moving for the past couple of hours.Agent Flynn sighed.Due to your proximity to the Vice President, we had to be sure that you were not an intended target.You were not.Nick broke the tension with a joke.For once, someone didnt want me dead.Ill count that as a win.You know, thats something that was never a concern for me until you came into my life.Until I saved your life, you mean, Nick corrected me with a flash of his boyish grin.Alright.I clapped my hands together.Im ready to go.Wheres this back exit?Agent Flynn took us down the same elevator we went up in, but headed to the back of the hotel as we exited.I glanced quickly to the right and saw that the main lobby was still locked down and swarming with police.Youll be able to avoid the media this way also, Agent Flynn explained.I hear its a bit of a circus out front.I imagine there are quite a few clowns out there, I said, surprised when Nick laughed.Most people didnt find my jokes to be very funny.Agent Flynn stopped short at the end of the hallway and pressed a finger to his ear, listening to whatever the mystery voice was saying in his ear piece.Your car is here, he said, pushing open an unmarked door.A black sedan waited for us in the alley.No offense, but I hope we dont meet again, I said to Agent Flynn.He didnt look the least bit offended as he opened the car door for me.Nick suggested that I be dropped off first so I gave the driver my address and stole a glance at my phone.Seven missed calls from Eva, which meant she had been watching the news.Nick was busy with his phone as well, his brow furrowed in concentration as he read through his email.Glad to be back in the real world?he asked without looking up.It occurred to me that the last couple of hours in that hotel room were some of the most peaceful moments I had experienced in a long time.There was something to be said for locking out life, having a couple of drinks, and turning off your brain.You mightve been on to something, I confessed.I know we dont know each other very well, but something you should know about me is that Im always right.Nick smirked as he threw my own words back in my face.I allowed myself a small smile.This is me, I said as we pulled up in front of my building.Maybe Ill see you around town.Maybe.Nick looked like he was going to say more but changed his mind.Have a good night.I was halfway out the door when Nick stopped me.Charley?Yeah?Nicks eyes narrowed as he thought for a second.It was really nice to meet you.Ditto, I said.Thanks for the stimulating conversation.Anytime.With that, I shut the door on Nicholas Cooper, certain that our paths would cross again someday.I had no idea just how soon it would be.Tuesday, October 6th The Daily Scandal Washingtons #1 Source for Breaking Political News and Politicians Making News Last night, an attempt was made on the life of the Vice President.Eye witnesses say that a man attempted to attack the VP while at a fundraiser at The Capital Hotel.No one was harmed in the incident but the hotel and surrounding vicinity were in lockdown for hours.Other sources tell the Daily Scandal that Senator Nicholas Cooper was escorted to a private suite accompanied by a beautiful young woman.It is not known whether this woman was another of the senators many conquests but it was confirmed that the two of them disappeared for hours.Im sure this isnt the last well hear of this mystery woman.TWO Thats all youve got for me?Eva slammed her coffee mug onto my desk, spilling it in the process.You were locked in a room with Senator Cooper for a couple of hours and you didnt walk away with any clue as to how hes going to vote?I had other things on my mind right then, I said, using a tissue to wipe up the spilled coffee.Besides, I dont think the senator even knows how hes going to vote yet.Really?Eva sat up straight.So you did have a heart to heart with him then?Thats a bit of an embellishment.We talked a little, thats all.Eva and I had already been through this line of questioning several times.I was relieved when Evas assistant, Mindy, knocked on my open office door.I have a delivery for Charley, she said, stepping into the room holding an embarrassingly large display of flowers.Mindy was grinning like a fool as she set the vase on my desk.Looks like you have an admirer.Eva nearly knocked over the entire thing reaching for the card.Fortunately, my reflexes were quick and I snatched the card just before her hand closed over it.I believe Mindy said these flowers are for me.I gave Eva a pointed look as I opened the miniature envelope and slid out the tiny stationary inside.The handwriting was neat and precise, clearly legible.Charley  I enjoyed our time together last night.Any chance you would be interested in doing it again?Minus the near death experience, of course.We can even argue politics again.Just say yes.~Nick Well, that certainly was an interesting twist.I could feel both Eva and Mindy watching me and my cheeks flushed.If I told Eva who the flowers were from, she would never stop trying to use it to her advantage.On the other hand, she wasnt going anywhere without some kind of explanation.Nothing to see here, I said, pretending to shoo them away with the card.Eva wasnt having it.Spill it, Tanner.Youre blushing too much for it to be nothing.Theyre from that blind date I went on last week.Remember the one my friend Tara set me up on?The guy that made me pay the bill?Anyway, this is his way of apologizing I guess.I turned to my computer and pretended to be busy answering emails after sliding the card under my keyboard, out of sight.I dont buy a word you said.Eva slid off my desk and smoothed down her dress.I have to run to a meeting, but this isnt over.Eva was right  it wasnt over.As much as I tried to forget about Nick and focus on work, the flowers werent exactly easy to ignore.And every time I saw them, or caught a whiff of them, I started thinking about the note.Nick wanted me to say yes, but he didnt leave a phone number or email address.I couldnt say yes even if I wanted to.The question remained  did I want to say yes?I had a bad track record when it came to dating.Twenty eight years and I had never been in a serious, adult relationship.My friends teased that I was a commitment phobe but the reality was that I had a very low tolerance for people.Thats not to say that I was terribly picky, I just didnt like to put up with peoples crap.Fool me once, get the hell out of my life.Nick Cooper was the exact type of guy I typically avoided so when I found him sitting on my doorstep after work, I thought about running away.
