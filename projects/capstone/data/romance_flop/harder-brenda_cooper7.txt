Tell me if I was wrong, I say.What I said in the truck on the way to the airport.Which part did I get wrong?He shakes his head.Says something against my hand that I cant understand.I take my palm away.No part, he repeats.You were right.Youre always right.Im not, though.Im guessing all the time, and I screw up.Dont put me on a pedestal.Youre always right about the stuff that matters.When he smoothes his hand over my forehead, pushing away a strand of hair that stuck to my temple, I take his wrist and pull it down until his palm is pressing flat over my heart.I leave it there.Let him feel it beat.Im alive.I guess thats what Im showing him.I dont want to spend my life staring backward at everything thats gone wrong.I want to be here.So I pull him down by the back of his neck until his mouth is on mine and hes kissing me again with his hand over my heart.Hes kissing me deeper, moving over me, stroking my tongue with his, letting me feel the heat and the strength in him.There are things I want to say, blanks in the conversation that the good girl who still lives in me insists Ive got to fill up.She wants to tell him, I forgive you.She wants to say, I still love you.She wants to press her hand over his heart, too, and make him swear never to leave.Never to fuck up like that again.But Im not her anymore.Im not sure if I do forgive him.I know I love him, but I dont want him to have those words.I want him to earn them back.Convince me, I think, as my blanket falls away.As Wests thigh moves between mine, his belt dragging over my hip, his hands so sure of themselves, so good at gliding down my back to my ass, at grabbing and lifting and positioning me just so.Were gonna go slower this time, he says, kissing over my collarbone.So much slower it might just kill me.Make sure its not so slow that I dont notice its happening.He grins.Its almost right.Almost Wests smile.But hes holding something back.Tell me.I put my fingertip at that worry line between his eyebrows that wont quite go away.Dont get me wrong, he says.I like this.I want this.But shouldnt we be talking?My hands are sneaking up his back, his smooth tan skin, every bit of him familiar but different, broader, stronger, harder.We are talking, I say.Because we are.What he means is that were not following a script.Only, there is no script.There are no rules for this.I dont think were doing it wrong, because I dont believe theres any way to do it wrong or any way to do it right outside of how I feel, how he feels, how we feel between us.All the songs are love songs.Thats what Im learning.All the songs are love songs, and this one is ours.Are you happy?I ask.Right now, this instant?He kisses the top of my shoulder.My biceps muscle.Youre naked.Does that mean yes?That means fuck yes.Me, too.He kisses the swell of my breast.Cups them both in his hands and drops his head to my cleavage.His back rises under my palms.Are you smelling my boobs?Im smelling you.Thats a little weird.Okay.He roots his nose in there until it touches my breastbone.Kisses that spot.I can live with weird.He kisses my ribs, licks down my ribcage, mouths my stomach, smells me at my navel and then between my legs.Looks up with his hands already dug under my ass, his mouth an inch from the stripe of my pubic hair, and says, You still happy?He sounds like hes teasing, but I know what hes asking.All the guidebooks and conventional wisdom in the world say this is where I should snap.This is the moment when I should be angry, disgusted, cold with him.I should want vengeance.I should rain down my vengeance upon him, and the last thing I should ever let him do is what hes about to do right now.But Im swollen and aching and I need him.When I squirm, he smiles and licks a hot line right through the middle of me.Im not sure I believe in vengeance.I know I dont believe in tit for tat, this but not that, you can until I say you cant, I love you until I decide I dont.With West, I picked deep and then deeper.I picked all the way, hot and cold, good and bad, dark and light.I picked West in my bed and West on his fire escape in the snow, chicken soup West and bakery West, drug dealer West and brawler West, West in Silt and West in Putnam.I picked hand jobs and blow jobs and doggy style and missionary and sloppy oral and morning breath kisses and nights when were too tired and we just hold hands and go to sleep.I picked him.Him.This is where we are now.Who we are right now.Us.I dont know how Ill feel in the morning.Im not pretending its all going to be perfect, that its perfect now, or even that perfect is a real thing that exists in the world.But tonight, theres no bullshit between the two of us.Theres just his hand sliding up my thigh.His mouth moving down, his breath on my clit.What he wants to do.What I want to let him give me.Thats all this is.I put my hand over the top of his head, rake my nails over his scalp and give him one hard, firm push.Easy there, tiger, he says.Were taking it slow, remember?This time when he smiles, its his real smile.I know, because it hits me down low and deep, makes me shudder, makes me wetter than I already was.So slow, Caro.Youre gonna hate me for it.I dont, though.He tortures me, asks me every now and then, You happy?I keep saying yes even though hes killing me.Yes, yes, West, God.He kills me and kills me.Im so happy, I could die.West Can I talk to you?Thats what I asked Caroline in her room, in her bed.Can I talk to you?I asked Frankie the next morning over pancakes.I called her counselor and set up another meeting.Can I talk to you?I left my boss at the window plant a message, asking him to call me back, giving notice that Id be quitting as soon as I found work with daylight hours.I dont think Id ever talked so much in my life as I talked that November.You get your mind made up that you know how everything is and so theres no point in talking.You know what youve got to do.You know what the future looks like.And then you hit some pivot point, some paradigm shift that shows you everything you thought you knew wasnt right, so you start going around all the time saying, Can we talk?I have to ask you something.Ive got things I need to tell you.I guess its because Im stubbornbecause I get set in my ways, pulling the cart through the same ruts day after daybut I always thought when I asked people to talk to me that I knew how the conversation would go.What Id say.What theyd say back.Its funny, because I was always wrong.Those weeks in November and on into Decemberthey were full of surprises.Happy surprises, sad surprises, gutting surprises, frustrating surprises, amazing surprises.Caroline was sometimes the biggest surprise of all, because she kept coming around.Staying over.Sticking by me.And those were the weeks that everything finally changed.I stopped thinking I knew how my life was going to go.I started waking up in the morning thinking how interesting it would be to see what happened next.And somewhere along the way, I noticed I wasnt asking, Can I talk to you?anymore.I was just talking.Listening.Getting surprised, and liking it.The morning after Krishnas party, Frankies picking at her pancakes, and Im trying not to care.She drenched them in syrup.I warned her it was too much, suggested she could put the syrup in a cup and dip the pieces so shed have the right amount, but she just rolled her eyes like I was the stupidest person on the planet and kept squirting the syrup on.She ate four bites.Now shes poking at whats left.Lifting the edges up with her fork.Dropping them with a heavy, wet splat.Her hairs a rats nest at the crown of her head, and shes wearing a nightgown with Tinkerbell on it that pulls too tight across her chest.A kids nightgown on a teenagers body.I need to get her new pajamas.I push my chair back and stand, thinking Ill do the dishes.That way, I dont have to get annoyed at her for wrecking the breakfast I made.What are we doing today?she asks.The plan is to sort through our shit.Have a heart to heart and work it all out.Frankie isnt aware of the plan yet.I sit back down.Shes eased one elbow onto the glass top of the table and dropped her head so the pancakes are exactly at eye level.I watch as she lifts up the whole stack of pancakes and drops it down.Splat.Youre gonna get syrup in your eyeballs doing that.She glances over to check if Im serious.I thought wed just hang out at home, I say.If its okay with you.All day?Sure, why not?Youre always making me do stuff on the weekends.I thought you liked doing stuff.Not all the time.We dont do stuff all the time.Every weekend.You dont want to do stuff with me?She shrugs.Forks up her pancakes four or five inches.Splat.Was it fun over with Rikki and Laurie?I ask.Yeah.What movies did you guys watch?I dont know what they were called.What were they about?There was one with these boys whose dad took them to an island and they killed him by accident.For real?No, it was just a movie.Her tone of voice says I could not possibly be more of a moron.Was it R rated?How should I know?It was from Russia.There were subtitles so you could understand what they were saying.What was the other movie?It was likeI dont know how to describe it.Kind of old timey, but it wasnt old, and there were boats and stuff?I couldnt figure out what was going on.Rikki said it was nonrepresentational, which means it wasnt really about anything.Whats the point of a movie like that?Its what they were watching.I mean, is it supposed to be pretty to look at it, or some kind of commentary on the human condition, or what?She shrugs.I wait a beat, but thats all Im getting out of her.Did you have bad dreams over there?No.Why would I?I dont know.Why wouldnt you?It was nice, she says.Their guest room has the softest blanket in the whole world, and one of those mattresses like on TV thats made of foam.When you lay down on it you sink in like youre going to sleep in an alien pod.Ive never slept on one of those.It wasnt very comfortable.But it was cool.Having temporarily forgotten shes supposed to be annoying me with the pancakes, she cuts off a sliver of a bite from the edge.Too sweet.I can tell by the way she chews slow and drinks a lot of water afterward.You want me to do the pancakes over?Nah.Im not that hungry.All right.I get up to do the dishes.I place the stopper, squirt soap into the sink, watch steam rise off the stream of hot water coming from the tap.That was the longest conversation Ive had with Frankie in ages, and I dont want to wreck it.West?she says to my back.Yeah?What did Mr.Gorham say?A real question about a real thing, asked in a civil tone of voice.I could fucking cheer, it feels like such an accomplishment.He said hell take care of things with this Clint kid.You wont have to sit near him on the bus anymore, or in class.Silence.Thats good, right?Yeah, she says.Thanks.I swallow over a lump in my throat.I didnt do much, but youre welcome.While the bubbles rise in the sink, I think about what else there is to talk about.About how to get from surviving to thriving.I havent got a clue, so I think about what Caroline might say.He wants to get you doing more gifted and talented stuff.He always says that.It sounds like he thinks its pretty important.I dont want to do it.I turn to look at her, trying not to let on how much her statement worries me.My sister looks sallow under the kitchen lights.Shes sitting with her arms and legs crossed, a stubborn frown fixed on the far wall.Sure you do, I say.No, I dont.Why not?I just dont, okay?No, look And then I stop myself, because I can hear my volume rising, and no.Not going to be that man.I recognize the way she looks right now.Ive felt that mask on my own face, that hard set to my jaw, that steel in my eyes.All Im going to accomplish if I keep after her right now is to make her dig in further.I dont know what her reasons are, but shes got them.Me and herwere alike that way.So instead of giving her grief, I ask, What do you want?Her eyes narrow.What do you mean?You didnt want pancakes for breakfast, you didnt want to move here, you dont want gifted and talentedwhat do you want, Franks?You want to go back to Silt?You want to take art lessons after school?You want me to find this Clint kid and punch him in the face?What?Her eyebrows are drawn in, her face sharp.I want to go to my room, she says.I close my eyes and breathe.This is what Im getting from her right now, and its fine.Its not what I want, but I can live with it.Im trying to do right by you, I say.You know that.She nods, slowly.So think about what I asked, and when you know the answer, tell me.Okay.Okay.And then, as though its an afterthoughtas though I havent been thinking about how to tell her all morningI say, Carolines coming over later.What for?To study.And shell probably stay for dinner.Good.Frankie starts down the hall.She might stay the night.Frankie stops on her threshold.Like, in your room?I clear my throat.Yeah.Gross.Then she disappears, closes the door shut behind her, and Im standing there like a jackass, unsure whether to count that conversation as a success or a failure.Theres snow flurries that afternoon.Its too early for snow.Im watching them fall in fuzzy, lazy swoops when I see Laurie come out of the house and go into his workshop.Frankies in her room.She came out a few minutes after our talk, asked me for a ruler and some paper from my art class sketchbook, and then returned to her cave.Later, she emerged again and said her pencils all sucked and she had to use the set I bought for my art class.I gave her one of them and the sharpener.She disappeared.Bored with my reading, I text Caroline.Its snowing, FFS.She texts back, I noticed.When are you coming over?Little while.Im writing.You think the roads are slippery?Its melting, Oregon boy.Too warm for it to stick.Come over, then.What are you doing?Reading about Stalin.Hows Stalin?Megalomaniac.How are the Irish?Such a problem.Come over.I need to finish this draft.Come over.Yeesh.I grin.An hour?Two.Bah.Youll survive, darling.Call me that later when Im fucking you.In your dreams.I know, right?Quit texting me or Ill never finish.See you in 1 hr.58 min.GOD.Satisfied, I put the phone down.Frankie comes out with a paper in her hand.What?she says.What what?Your face.She points.I run my hand over my mouth and chin.Im still smiling.Carolines coming over, I report.You told me that already.Yeah.She shifts from foot to foot.So I guess shell be over a lot now, huh?She might.You know, she was my friend first.She was my girlfriend first.But that was a long time ago.It was last spring.And you fucked it up.Who told you I fucked it up?She rolls her eyes.Like anybody needed to tell me.Yeah, well, I fixed it, so now were gonna have to share her.Will she still pick me up from school?I think you better ask her that when she gets here.Shes coming now?In a couple hours.Frankie waves the paper at me.I want to run over and give this to Rikki.Can I see?She flips the paper over and shows it to me.Its a portrait of a womanglamorous, all hair and lips like a fashion model.Its shaded and intricate, with decent perspective.Fucking impressive.Way better than her other drawings.You made that?Rikki showed me how.You just make a grid on the magazine and then you make a bigger grid on the picture, and you draw it one square at a time.Its easy.Its not really like drawing at all.She hands it to me, and I can see the faint gridlines now and some details that arent quite righta squinty eye, the jewelry cartoonish where Frankie drew what she thought it was supposed to look like instead of what it actually looks like.Still.This is amazing.No, its not.Franks Can I take it over to Rikkis?Yeah, if you get dressed first.I give her the picture back.Would you make me one next?Why?I dont know.Just to have it.I guess so.Sure.Great.She leaves the room, and I hear a dresser drawer open.When she comes out, shes wearing jeansnormal jeans, not huge onesand a giant sweatshirt.She opens the front door.You should draw your own, she says.Its really easy.I could show you how.I follow her to the door.After dinner.Id like that.She smiles up at me.Careful on the steps, I say.Its snowing.Okay, Grandpa.I watch her make her way down, one hand gliding over the powder on the railing.Then shes off, running across the yard without a coat, snow falling in her hair.Lauries moving around in the space outside his workshop.I wanted to talk to him, so I throw on a coat and head down the stairs myself.I find him buried to the elbows in a big gray metal box on stilts, peering through a small glass window while a compressor hums loud over a low hissing sound that stops and starts, stops and starts.I dont come out here much, and when I do its usually because Im grabbing Frankie for hanging around too long.I dont blame her for wanting to hang around, though.Lauries workshop is sweet.Its like a barn crossed with a carport.Inside, theres a space like a hayloft full of rusted out pieces of scrap metal and a row of stalls that makes me think the place was a stable once.Each stall holds a different kind of supplieswood and metal, ceramics, rubber, glass.The open air part under the carport roof is where he does welding.Theres a big compressor just inside the door, propane tanks, face shield, huge gloves, I dont know what all else.Im still trying to figure out what the fuck the story is with the gray metal box when the compressor kicks off and he steps back.Hey, West, he says.Hey, Professor Collins.Laurie.I cant call him Laurie to his face.Its not only because hes a professorits also because hes my landlord and hes got a Wikipedia page that calls him an internationally acclaimed multimedia three dimensional artist.What is that thing?I ask.Sandblaster.What are you blasting?Glass.He withdraws his arms, unscrews the wing nuts on either side of the window he was looking through, and extracts a beige shape.Thatswhat is that?Its a hammer.A glass hammer.Its almost entirely wrapped in masking tape, like a hammer mummy with just the round surface you hit with and the bottom of the handle showing.What for?Its a series.Tools.This ones just a studyI have a commission to do a big one.But the logistics are a pain in the ass.He takes his mummy hammer inside the barn.I hear water running.I edge closer to the sandblaster, curious what it looks like inside.Theres a brass colored nozzle attached to a hose laying on top of an open plastic grid.The nozzle must shoot sand at the glass, and then the sand falls off and through the grid to come out the hole in the bottom.Neat.Laurie comes back out drying his glass hammer with a paper towel, a roll of masking tape dangling from his fingers.Unwrapped, the hammer is aqua blue, shining, and I want to touch it.I want to wrap my fingers around the handle and pound something with itwhich is all wrong, because it would shatter if I did that, and Id be fucking disappointed.It reminds me of Studio Art last week, how Rikki was debating with Raffe about what art is.Raffe said art has no purposethat if something has a purpose, its not art.And Rikki said the opposite.That the purpose of art is to make you feel or think, and a lot of the time both.Art provokes a response, she told us.Be provocative.You want to try the sandblaster?Laurie asks.Sure.Give me a minute to mask it again.He wraps tape over the polished surface of the hammer, leaving one strip around the handle bare.So what were doing is blasting off the polish to give it a frosty surface.The hammer is heavy when he hands it over.I touch the strip, cool glass beneath my fingertip.Put it inside there, he says.Careful with it, thoughI had that thing in the kiln more than a week.Just to cast it?Yep.You have to bring the temperature up slowly, hold it there, bring it back down just as slow.Otherwise itll crack, explode, God only knows.Glass is fussy.Took me eleven tries to get that hammer.Eleven tries.A week in the kiln for each one.This thing is worth a fucking fortune in fuel and labor.I place it on the grating carefully, close the observation window, and push my hands into the gloves.Theyre bulky.The nozzle is hard to hold on to.When I first pull the trigger, the hammer jumps from the compressed hit of air, and I almost drop it.Good, Laurie says.Just do that back and forth evenly.For how long?Until its done.Its meticulous work, satisfying.After I get the hang of it, I relax enough to say, I wanted to thank you for watching Frankie last night.No thanks necessary.It was fun.She behaved herself, I hope?Always, he says.And I was happy to see your truck wasnt out here when I went to bed.A minute passes.Laurie comments, Rikki says youre doing well in Studio Art.Im spending three times as long on that class as everything else, just praying to get out of there with a B.  She says you have an interesting mind.I have the least interesting mind in there.What makes you say that?I tilt my head toward the sandblaster.This kind of stuff is easy for me.Machines, problems, figuring out one step after the next.But Rikki wants me to be creative, and Im not.Laurie seems to accept this.Hes quiet for a while.Then he asks, You ever use a wheel to grind glass?No.Want to try?I do.I want to see the kiln, too, and find out what it costs to run it for a week.Ask what happens when you scale it upwhat kind of logistics problems does he mean?Hows he going to cast a giant hammer?Can he make it in pieces?Id better get back to my reading, I say.I draw my hands out of the box and turn the art back over to the artist.He takes the hammer and holds it lightly with his fingertips, flipping it one way and the other.Hows the factory?he asks.Im giving notice.I need to find something where Ill be home more with Frankie.You want to work for me?he asks.I need an assistant.Flexible hours.Decent money.What kind of work?Stuff like this.Finishing.Polishing.Answering email or phone calls.Whatever I dont feel like doing, to be honest.Im behind on this commission.I could use the help.Shouldnt you hire an art major?He waves the hammer in dismissal, making me worry hes going to drop it.Ive been trying, but I cant find any who know fuck all about tools.You seem like you know tools.And like I said, Rikki thinks your mind is interesting.I guessyeah.I would.As long as you know what youre getting.You need references or something?He laughs.Youre twenty one years old, youre raising your kid sister, studying your ass off, doing night shifts at a window factory.You could be an ex con and Id still probably hire you.Under the table, though, okay?I dont want to deal with taxes.He holds out his hand.I shake it.I mean, fuck, of course I shake it.Even if the moneys only so so, the jobs perfect.But when his fingers grip mine, Im not thinking about Frankie or the paycheck.Im thinking about whats inside that workshop.Compressors and welders and kilns, polishing equipment, all kinds of shit I dont know the names of.Tools to learn how to use.Systems to work out.It takes me a minute to figure out why my hearts beating so fast.Its been such a long time.Im excited.That night, Carolines in my bed.She sits with her back cushioned by my pillow, her hair down over her shoulders and her arms, tongue toying with her tooth gap, typing on her laptop.Im at the desk, supposedly studying for a Spanish quiz, but Spanish is easy.Caroline is right there.On my bed.Quit looking at me, she says.Im trying to think.Its late.Its only eleven.Frankies sleeping.Its late.Fingers hovering over the trackpad, she smirks.Im almost done.You said that an hour ago.Maybe I want you to spend some time wanting what you cant have.I been wanting what I couldnt have since I went back to Oregon last March.She takes her hand off the trackpad.You couldve had me, though, she says.All you had to do was ask.I drop my feet from the desk and clasp my hands together.I promised her no bullshit, but its hard to know how to find explanations without it.I owe her an explanation.I never wanted to leave Silt, I say.But thats not what I mean.I take a breath, try again.I never wanted to, because it never seemed possible.When I was a kid, I was too young to aim that high.I wanted to get through the day, the week, whatever.I wanted to get enough to eat, or if my dad was around, to not get beat.Or I wanted my mom and dad to get married, because I had this idea that things would get better if they were married.But then Frankie was born, and by the time I was old enough to think about leaving, I knew I couldnt leave without her.So when I dreamed about what I wanted to happen, it was always about her leaving.Caroline puts her laptop down on the floor by the bed.Pats the spot next to her on the mattress.In a minute, I say.I want to get this out first.Rubbing my hands together, I reach for the words.When I came here my first yearI wasnt really here, I think.My body was here, but my head was in Silt, with Frankie, and everything I did my first two yearseverything with youits like I let myself get close to what I wanted, but I wouldnt really take it.I was following this plan for what I was supposed to do that was all about what Frankie was going to need me to be.And youGod, I was so fucking hard on you, pushing and pushing you away when you were all I wanted.I felt like I had to do that, because I wasnt here, right?I had to convince myself I wasnt here so I could be there, with her.West, come sit by me.Im almost done.She walks over and knocks at my hands until I move them apart.Then she straddles my lap.She puts her palms on my shoulders, resting comfortably on my thighs.You were too far away, she says.Now you can tell me the rest.I wrap my arms around her and hold her first.Feel how soft she is.Move her hair behind her shoulders and inhale against her neck.So you went back to Silt, she says.Yeah, but before that, when we got together, those weeks last springyou have to understand, Caro, then I was here.I was with you, and being with you was the only thing Id done that was just for me in Forever, she says.Ever, I reply.It was the only thing Id done for me ever.And then you went back to Silt.You saw what its like there.Theres no place for me to want anything.Its just what I can want for Frankie.At least, thats how it feels.Maybe thats not how it is.Maybe I couldve called you up, said, Come help me do this, and we wouldve been okay there, but it didnt feel like anything I could let myself do.Tell me how it felt.Shes stroking my head, my neck.Im so tense, my back teeth ache.It felt like if I tried to do that, I would ruin you.Not even that I would be doing it.That Silt would, my family, just the way it is therewhere I come from ruins people.Good people.And Id have to watch it happen.Id be responsible for it, because I wanted you and drew you to me across all those miles.I couldnt.I get my hands in her hair and kiss her.I couldnt.She smiles, but its the sad kind, the kind that hurts.You were ten when Frankie was born.Yeah.The same age she is now.Mmm hmm.Do you ever think about thatyour sister with a baby?Christ.No.But its the same, right?If Frankie were in your shoes, if she had a baby brother born and nobody to take care of him but her It gives me chills.Dont.She runs her hands up and down my arms, warming away the goose bumps.Its cruel even to think about, isnt it?Shes a kid.Shes too young.But so were you.I was old enough.You were always as old as you had to be.Thats the part that breaks my heart.She resettles herself on my lap, pressing closer.How old were you when you met the Tomlinsons?Sixteen.How old the first time?With Mrs.Tomlinson?I didnt tell her.She never asked me directly, and I avoided the subject, never wanting her to have to think about me fucking an older woman, a married woman, a woman I gave what she wanted so shed give me what I needed.I fucked Mrs.Tomlinson because that was what I had to do to get out of Silt.Caroline knows it.Shes figured it out.I can see it in her eyes.Baby, dont you think How old?she repeats.I blow out a long exhale.Sixteen.Did you want her?She was pretty.I wasnt a virgin.But she was the one who initiated it.Yeah, I wouldnt have Im forced to stop, the memory choking me hard for a second.How fucking terrified I was the first time in her car, when she sucked me off in the parking lot of the golf course and I watched out the window for Dr.T to drive up.How scared I was to say no, how furious that I had to say yes.Furious at how I responded to her when I knew even at sixteen that she couldnt be right in the head.That what she wanted from me wasnt sexit was something else.Some hit of power, of danger.I was so furious at Dr.T for not knowing about it.For never putting a stop to it.It wouldve ruined my chance at Putnam, but there were times I still wished to fuck hed figure it out.Resting my head against Carolines shoulder, I breathe in the scent of her hair.She was his wife, I say.And I already knew he could be my ticket out of there if I played it right.Its illegal what she did to you.I consented.Sixteen year olds cant consent to sex with adults.You were indebted to her, afraid of her husband and what you would lose if you told her no.Something in her tone tells me its a question, and she needs the answer.Not for herself, but for me.She needs me to acknowledge that what shes saying, this story shes tellingits my story.It is.But I never saw it that way.I never let myself see it that way.I just thought about it as what I had to do, and I didnt let myself wonder why Rita Tomlinson wanted to fuck a minor or what it meant for me that I was the minor she decided to fuck.Yes, I whisper.West?I lift my head and say it again.Yes.If that happened to your sister in six years Rage.Shame.All over me.God, this is why I dont do this, why I never wanted to do this, because its too fucking awful.Please dont.I want to make sure you hear me.I hear you.But dont go there.Please.She strokes her hands over my head, down my neck, across my shoulders, along my arms.My chest.My back.Everywhere she can reach.She holds me, and it helps.Slows me down.Brings me back into my body.Even though my life before her isnt something she can fix, it helps.Thats why I dont want to hear it, she says.I dont want to hear you tell me how worthless you are, or why youre sorry for what you did to me with that woman.I know what you did and what it meant.I know.And it wasnt about sex.It was aboutGod, I dont even have the word for it.Hopelessness.Despair.I used sex to make you leave me.It wasthat was something special between us.Sacred, even.And I turned it into a weapon.Turned it on you.What else did you have to use?she asks.Its like thawing from a freeze.It burns.It takes my breath away, and I have to drop my head again and breathe.Its harder than I thought it would be.Harder still when she says, It hurt me so bad, West.I dont want you to think Im being Mother Teresa here, pretending it didnt.Im shaking.Caro.No, I should say this.I should level with you, because it hasnt stopped hurting.Sometimes I think about it and I cant stand it, like I really cant stand it, and I have to do something to get out of my head or Ill just be so full of hate.So mad at you.I dont know if I was ever as mad at Nate, even, because what he did was nasty, but what you did was so fucking personal.I expect her to draw farther away from me.She puts her arms around me instead.Her hot cheek presses against my neck.What helps, she says, is when Im looking out the window of the truck and seeing you with her, sometimes I can flip that.So Im looking in it, at me.Imagining what you were feeling to make you do that.And you know, West, its fucking awful from that direction, too.It hurts.I almost cant stand it, because it means I have to accept how badly I failed you when you went home to Silt.How badly everyone failed you.I wasnt your responsibility.You were, she says.You were, and you still are.And the good thing is, when I put myself outside the truck, after I do it, Im notIm still mad, but Im mad at the whole world, you know?Im just as mad for you as Im mad at you, and I can kind of see how it will be easier to feel that way next time.That eventually, its the only way Ill feel.That Silt was this awful thing that happened to both of us together, instead of something you did to me.She kind of laughs.I mean, Im not quite there yet.But Im trying.Im sorry, I tell her.More sorry than youll ever know.I know you are, she says.Im sorry, too.But now youre here.Im trying to be here.Im trying so hard.She holds me.We stay like that until I can breathe again, and I start to feel more than just guilt and shame.Until I can feel her warmth and smell her body.Caroline on my lap.My dick wakes up.It seems fucked up that its even possible for me to want her after what we just talked about, but I do.And she wiggles against me, letting me know she wants me, too.So tell me something, West, she says.What do you want?No way Caroline can know I asked Frankie the same thing over pancakes this morning.No way can she know that nobody ever asks me that.Nobody but her.She kisses along my jaw.What do you want, West?she whispers.She kisses my eyebrows and my forehead and the tip of my nose.What do you want?I take her chin and guide her mouth to mine.I grab hold of her sweater.Im going to show her.The sweater is longdown below her hips when shes standing upand I pull it off over her head because I like the contrast of the waistband of her black leggings against the pale skin of her stomach.Her bare breasts and her soft cotton covered thighs.I thought about you like this in Silt, I say.Oh, yeah?When you were staying at my grandmas.That time I was over for dinner, sitting by you on the couch, it was all I could fucking think ofgetting just enough of your clothes off to put my mouth on you.Slide my fingers inside you.We were in a room full of people.I know.All day at work, you were texting me, trying to get under my skin, and I was thinking about getting you upstairs alone at Joans on those mismatched pieces of carpet.She still have those?Yeah.You had a lot of plans.Not plans.Urges.Needs.Impulses I kept shutting down, because I was so sure I had to.At the airport, I saw you before you even came outside, I confess.You were fussing with your bag behind the glass, and I wanted you to stay right there so I could watch you.You looked amazing.You looked like Like water in the desert.Like color in a black and white movie.Stupid clichs.She looked like Caroline.Like herself.I could hardly believe she was real.I drove twenty miles over the limit all the way to Eugene, I say.She drops her forehead onto mine.You idiot.I knew as soon as you came through the door, Id ruin it.There wasnt any way not to ruin it, and it made me so fucking angry, so thats what you ended up seeing when you did come outside.How angry I was at the world for making me and you impossible.Were not impossible.She tilts her hips into me.Were right here.I smooth my hands over her ass.I shouldve just told you how bad I wanted you.How I wanted you in the truck on the way from the airport.At the funeral home in that family room with the door locked.How I couldnt stop thinking how youd bite your wrist if I bent you over the back of the couch.Bite my shoulder if I lifted you up against the inside of the bathroom door.Her pupils are huge.You looked at me sometimes likebut you wouldnt talk to me.I felt so black.So dark.And it wasnt right, you know?It was sick to want you like that, to want some quick fuck when you were trying to help me.Maybe it would have made you feel better.It would have made me feel like complete shit.And that sounded good, toogetting something I wanted that much, then getting punished for it.She kisses me.Sinks down onto me, grinds herself against me, licks over my lip, and bites it.What do you want?she whispers.This time its a taunt.A tease.This is all I want.Just this.This is the only thing I ever wanted for myself.Let your hair down, I say.She unwraps the elastic shes got it bundled up in.It falls down over her back and shoulders, and I gather it in my hands.Its so long.Ive been thinking of cutting it.
