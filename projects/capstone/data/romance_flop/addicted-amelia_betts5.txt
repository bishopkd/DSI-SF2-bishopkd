She sounded angry, which surprised me because I knew from personal experience that it took a lot to make my best friend angry.Oh no, wait!I said.Ask me your question again!Im all ears.No, you know what?This is what happens when you have a guy anywhere near your orbit.Thats not true!Mischa you obsess to the point of absolute ridiculousness.I mean, we talked about Bradley for like two years straight.Shh, dont say that.Bradley, Bradley, Bradley, Bradley!Ill say it whenever I want!You dated the guy for three months!Three and a half.Whatever!My point is, youre a much better person when theres no guy, because youre crazy when there is and theres no room for anything else.Or anyone else!You cant even listen to one story about my life.My heart plummeted, knowing that her accusation was, in fact, more than a little true.I defended myself nonetheless.Gracie, of course I can.Please, tell me.No, Mischa.Ill talk to you later.Gracie, wait!Im sorry!But my final pleas were met with a dial tone.She had already hung up.I texted her another Im sorry and pounded Juliens old mattress in frustration.* * * When I showed up at his office thirty minutes later, Julien didnt seem fazed by my tardiness.In fact, he seemed mildly amused when handing over two more books for photocopying.A ridiculously unfounded fear made its way into my head: Does he have a nanny cam trained on the pantry?Did he see me eat all his food?Thanks again for last nights dinner, I said, pausing at the doorway as I contemplated whether or not to mention the Droolian Poundwell text so that the non news wouldnt come from Cecile.A wry smile came over Juliens face.Hey, was that guy really your cousin?Pardon me?Id heard exactly what he said.What was I supposed to tell him?The chef from the restaurant?Is he really your cousin?Oh umm I shifted uncomfortably.I couldnt very well lie to Juliens face, especially since he already seemed to know the truth.No, I admitted.I dont know why I didnt say anything after we left.I felt bad that he lied to you.Julien chuckled, and I relaxed a little.Thats okay, he said.I dont expect you to share the details of your personal life with me.I just had a hunch.Wanted to make sure my bullshit radar still works.Well, hes not my boyfriend, either, I told him with an exaggerated roll of the eyes, unintentionally revealing my insecurities around Liam.Mmm hmm, one of those.Julien lowered his laptop screen and leaned on the edge of the desk.Not that youre looking for my advice, but ever since I had a daughter, I started looking at guys a whole new way, and he seems like one of those I would ban from my house.I nodded, thinking, You dont know the half of it.Youre a smart girl to be single at this age, Mischa, he said, making the false assumption that I had loads of options.I got married young, but if I hadnt found the exact right person at such a young age, I would have waited longer.A lot longer.And youve got so much ahead of you.Grad school.Possibly a PhD if you decide to go that route I tried to hide the look of confusion on my face as Julien described this future for me.I had never thought of myself as a potential PhD candidate, although I found it flattering that he could envision it.And then your fate is entirely dependent on which school hires you, and believe me, relationships are mostly doomed when it comes to that.But I digress.He sat back in his chair, folding his hands across his chest.I just think youre better off if that guys not your boyfriend.Hes got that sparkle in his eye, and its not the right kind of sparkle.I nodded, taking in Juliens fatherly advice like a spoonful of sour milk.He was right of course, but it was painful to hear Liam described as the guy with the wrong kind of sparkle.It only confirmed my fear that Id imagined the underlying connection Id felt with him.That Liam had duped me, the way he must dupe every girl.All right, well these books arent gonna copy themselves!My voice broke a little as I turned to leave.All right, Mischa, said Julien, and flipped his laptop screen back up.I gave a quick wave and trudged out into the empty hallway, where I got out my phone and started to call Gracie before I remembered how our last conversation had ended.* * * All the copy machines were taken when I got to the library, even the one hidden behind the fourth floor study carrels, so I decided to wait it out for a while in the drab, windowless computer lab, where e mail and Facebook checking quickly devolved into shameless googling of Liam Harrison.As much as I wanted to take Juliens advice to heart, I hadnt been able to get Liam off my mind, and now that I knew his full name, not to mention the name of his famous band, I couldnt resist the Internet vortex that was calling my name.First came an image search, which sent me to various obsessive fan sites with a seemingly endless supply of concert pics.Then there was the bands website, which taught me what kind of guitar Liam learned to play on (a Dove acoustic), his absolute favorite electric (Gibson Les Paul Junior), and his Beatles inspired middle name (George).Then there were the album reviews, which pointed out Liams songwriting contributions, including the fact that hed written the music and the lyrics for Ginger Snap, meaning hed probably made a good chunk of money off that one song alone.Who cares?The angel on my shoulder tried to talk sense into me as I scrolled down to yet another music magazine profile of Liams old band.Gracie had been right, and the more links I clicked, the more I was proving her point.My obsessiveness was my Achilles heel.As I typed Liams name into the Google search box one more time, I could feel it in my bones: Self destruction was imminent.* * * Tuesday, June?: Oceanside Rec Center Meeting Topic of discussion: Falling off the Wagon Calories imbibed: ???(no attention span = no idea) I hadnt seen Liam in almost a week when I showed up to my regular meeting on Tuesday night.Needless to say, I had spent the entire weekend dreaming up ways of running into him and rewarding myself with snacks whenever I actively refrained from calling the restaurant.I could think of nothing but Liam, actually, and was therefore newly grateful that my job entailed little more than flattening books against a glass surface and pressing a copy button one hundred thousand times per day.Because otherwise, I would have been completely and utterly useless.When not copying, I was eating and avoiding scales at all costs, but my ill fitting wardrobe indicated I had gained at least five or ten pounds.I was also avoiding mirrors.The only clothes that looked halfway decent were my tentlike maxi dresses that made me look like an inflated bowling pin roaming around in search of its natural habitat, and if I so much as caught myself in the reflection of a window, it was enough to send me right back to the trough.Yes, I felt like a literal and figurative pig.Which is why the days topic of discussion, Falling off the Wagon, hit a little too close to home.I contemplated leaving, but I didnt even have the willpower to manage that.When it came time for the main share, a regular contributor named Meghan took the stage.How much time would you like, dear?Sherrill, the moderator, said as she leaned forward from her perch on the side of the stage, glancing over her bifocals at Meghan while fumbling in an NPR tote bag for the stopwatch.Eight minutes, please.Impressively cool and collected, Meghan sat down on the chair that shed brought up to the stage and crossed her legs.She was around my age, although I didnt recognize her from campus, and she had the accent of a local.Despite being a little overweight, she always looked put together at the meetings and knew how to dress for her shape (she was an apple, like me), which I admired.Somehow I never seemed to achieve the most flattering look, even in my skinnier phases; everything was either a little too tight (aspirational would be a kind word for it) or a little too frumpy (defeatist).Hello everyone.Im Meghan, and Im an overeater.Hi, Meghan, the group chanted in unison.Im happy todays topic is about falling off the wagon, because its something Im very familiar with.In the past year, Id say its happened to me four or five times.Oh please.I wanted to roll my eyes and stomp on the floor and shout, I fall off the wagon four or five times a day!But that would have been terrible, and of course I didnt do it.The last time was just this past week.Ive been dealing with a really hard breakup, and it was on a night when my ex had been calling and texting, trying to get me to come over and sleep with him.The first few months after the breakup, I would answer his booty calls because I felt so lonely.I missed him all the time.But I knew he didnt want me beyond the sex and it made me feel terrible afterward.Now that I think of it, probably every binge this past year has come after one of our hookups.Food and men, men and food.In so many of our stories, they were two interchangeable entities.One would replace the need for the other, and vice versa.Right now, I was battling the urge to eat everything in the state of Florida to fill the gargantuan void that I so desperately wanted Liam to occupy.Its funny, Meghan continued, the best relationship Ive ever had was with my high school boyfriend.He was also a binge eater.And a football player, one of the big guys on defense, and we would just eat and eat and eat togetherthat was our favorite thing to do.I mean, I know thats not healthy or whatever, and its not what I want for my future, but in terms of, I guess, mutual respect and understanding I just felt like we were in the same boat, he and I.  I found myself nodding along and considered the similarity between falling for a fellow binger and falling for a sex addict.I was reminded again that my attraction to Liam wasnt just physical, even though it seemed like it on the surface.Things went deeper with him because I knew he had vices like mine.There was a humanity there because of his addiction to sex, and although I didnt fully understand Liams fixation on it, I could certainly relate.Not to mention I was becoming more and more fixated on sex myself, after he had entered the picture.Well, that and food.Food and sex, sex and food.Straightening up in my chair, I forced myself to listen to the rest of Meghans share with rapt attention but became distracted, as usual, for the remainder of the meeting, drifting in and out of thoughts about Liam and my concerns about how mad Gracie was.Luckily there was no gratitude share with this group, so I was able to coast through without saying a wordbesides the serenity prayer, of course.God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference, we all recited, holding hands in a crooked circle.Then the die hards, as they always did, jostled the hands of their neighbors and raised their voices with the coda Keep coming back!It works if you work it!I never joined in on the last part, mainly because it would have been disingenuous.If I was going to be falling off the wagon more than once a day, I certainly wasnt going to be shouting about how well the program was working for me.Ten Certain meetings sent me straight to the drive thru, depending on how happy and together the nights speakers had seemed in contrast to myself.Tonights meeting, however, had made me want to see Liam more than ever.For some reason, when Meghan had described her relationship with her overeating, football playing high school sweetheart, it had stoked my infatuation with him to the point where I found myself driving to his restaurant without even noticing what I was doing.My car had seemed to steer itself, and before I knew it I was coasting in to the employee parking lot behind Trio, headlights turned off preemptively like I was planning to rob the place.As I parked, I heard my phone ringing in my purse and scrambled to answer it, hoping whoever had called would talk me out of what I was doing.Then I saw that it was Isabellano such luck.Darling, how long do I heat up these potatoes?she greeted me, sounding frustrated.In the oven or in the microwave?I said.The microwave, you silly rabbit!You think I have time for the oven?Its ten oclock!Why are you eating so late?I fell asleep at six.Dont ask.Try two minutes on medium power, I instructed, checking my rearview mirror for any signs of life in the parking lot.Okeydokey, and how are you?Oh, Im okay.Im just sitting in the parking lot of Liams restaurant, wondering how I got here.Oh, well Ill let you get back to it, then!No, wait!Isabellawhat do I do?About what?Youre having a nighttime rendezvous.It sounds very romantic.I am brimming with envy.But he doesnt even know Im here.Am I gonna look crazy barging in on him here?Darling, nothing is crazy.And dont you want to have a story for me next time you see me, other thanfor this she employed her best whiny voiceOh no, Im such a schlappschwanz, I drove home and cried into my pillow.Woe is me.Okay, okay.Enjoy your potatoes.Thank you.And dont forget the horseradish sauce!I would never.Auf wiedersehen, she said, and hung up.Isabellas counsel had left me feeling no more prepared for what I was about to do.For a few minutes I just sat there in the darkened car, noticing my pulse as blood hummed through my veins at a faster and faster clip.No option sounded like a good one.Knocking on the door at the tail end of the dinner rush?Calling the hostess and faking another family emergency?Walking in and asking for a table when I could barely afford an appetizer?No.Answer D: None of the above.While the tiny speck of rationality left inside my brain was urging me to heed Juliens good advice and drive home, that speck had nothing on a head full of delusion.I got out of the car and paced the parking lot.A minute later, I was rapping on the back door that led to the kitchen, lightly at first, then harder, to no avail.The bustle inside the kitchen was probably drowning out anything on a lower register than human shouting, so I was going to have to get more creative.This meant turning the knob and pulling on the heavy door, only to find it locked.Now what?March through the restaurant to the kitchen and get tackled by security guards along the way?Of course, I knew that wasnt going to happenthere were no security guards.However, there were some very territorial seeming waitresses, and who did I think I was to go up against them?Wonder Woman?And then, boom!Something just short of a Biblical miracle happened.The door slammed into me and I stumbled backward as a rubber gloved, apron clad dishwasher busted outside with a large bag of trash.He didnt see me as he kicked the stopper behind him so the door stayed ajar.Eyes on his back, I bent my knees in a slight crouch, thinking that, in this moment, all that separated me from an action movie starlet was a black catsuit.Then thinking, Thank God Im not wearing a black catsuit.Frantic and unprepared, I bolted into the kitchen, where the steely bright lights seemed to amplify how ridiculous and disturbing my entrance must have looked.Everyonenot just some of the kitchen staff but everyoneturned to look after the first head whipped around at the sight of me standing in the doorway, head down, eyes scanning the room, arms outstretched as if I were surfing.Ignoring them as best I could, I surveyed the room in search of Liam, hurrying down the middle aisle in my billowing tent of a maxi dress until I spotted him in a cramped corner, concentrating over a large saut pan.Catching him unawares, I took a split second to appreciate his classic profile, the strong, tanned forearms exposed under the rolled up sleeves of his chefs coat, the pert little bump of his ass just visible in his loose black pants.Excuse me?Can I help you?I heard an annoyed line cook bark at me from behind.Ignoring my pursuer, I called out Liams name.He glanced up from a saut pan in a blas manner, but when our eyes met his tripled in size.What the hell?he said.Can I speak with you outside for a second?I was short of breath from the bolting around and the general panic.Uhh He looked around, not sure how to react to the onslaught of me.Give me a minute.Ill meet you out there.Retreating, I waited by the door for a couple of minutes that felt more like hours, my sanity slowly returning to tell me what a fool I was for doing this.I became convinced that he was never going to come and started back to my car, stopping only when I heard the swing of the kitchen door.I turned to find him standing there like a vision in his white chefs coat, his furrowed brow indicating that my intrusion was just thatan intrusion.You got the wrong night, Mischa.Shoulda been here yesterday, same time.I was standing here like an idiot.He moved toward me, and I met him halfway until there were only inches between us in the middle of the parking lot.There was a hint of a smile detectable on his face, but I couldnt tell if he was actually happy to see me or just vaguely amused.I, on the other hand, felt like I was finally scratching an itch just being near him again.My hands wanted to grab his waist to make sure he was really there.I know, Im sorry.I dont know what Im doing.I stumbled over my words; my head was swimming.I just had to see you.I know that sounds stupid.Liam studied me with a straight face.There seemed to be a glint of sympathy in his eyes.That doesnt sound stupid.Not to me.I smiled.His words were reassuring, but not his actions.He hadnt reached out to touch me.In fact, he seemed to have taken a tiny step backward.Was he just telling me what I wanted to hear?Im sorry, I shouldnt have come, I said.Liam shut his eyes and shook his head.No.Its youre fine.I wanted to see you too.Again words only but they sounded heartfelt.Also, his accent was particularly sexy when spoken in hushed tones.He had been whispering, probably out of concern that one of his workers could interrupt at any minute, but it lent our interaction a conspiratorial air, like we were two people with a secret.I closed my eyes for a moment and clung to that feeling.Its just not a good time for me to be doing any of this.His words snapped me back into dismal reality.I didnt mean to sound harsh on the phone last night.Its just that Im supposed to be avoiding sex, Mischa.Its not that I dont want to; its that I cant in my right mind.Oh.I knew this already, so why did it hit me like the worst bit of bad news Id heard in all my life?Why are you looking at me that way?he said.What way?I straightened my posture, remembering some TED Talk I had seen about mimicking superhero stances in moments of self doubt.Like that.Like a lost puppy or something.Lost puppy?Ha.Whatever look I had had on my face turned into one of defiance: curled lip, one eye winking shut.I suddenly felt angry and embarrassed, indignant at the way Liam had torn through my world like a tornado, touching ground only a couple of times before leaving behind his trail of destruction, then calling me a lost puppy when I had a perfectly viable emotional reaction.The push pull reminded me of the way Bradley had treated me; one day I was his favorite person, the next a pariah.I had no response for Liamall I could do was shake my head and slowly back away.As usual, my actions betrayed my lack of experience in this life.I was behaving like a scorned teenager, but I didnt know any other way.Mischa, wait, Liam called after me, but stayed planted in the middle of the parking lot.Forget it!Forget I was here.Please.I fumbled with my keys.Finding the right one, I swung my drivers side door open so forcefully that it knocked the car beside mine.Flustered, I checked the other cars door to make sure it was fine, then fell into the drivers seat.Starting the car, I shifted into reverse when suddenly Liam appeared outside my passenger door and swung it open, plopping himself onto the seat.All right, where are we going?he asked, loud and a little manic.What?Nowhere.Dont you have food to cook?Nah, they got it under control.Lets get outta here.Like a thief in a getaway car, he glanced in the side mirror.And go where?I thought you were avoiding I am.That doesnt mean we cant go for a joyride, keep each other out of trouble, right?He found the reclining knob on the side of his seat and tried to lean his seat back to no avail.I laughed at the sight of Liam the Mercedes driver in my crappy little car.That doesnt work, I said.Even better, he said, and patted his knees eagerly, like hed been waiting all his life to ride around in a decades old, half broken Honda.* * * We drove aimlessly for a while, Liam floating his hand in the warm breeze outside the passenger window, me trying to figure out what was actually happening here.Were we buddies now that he had sworn off sex?Would I be able to handle that?So wheres your spot?he asked.I dont know, what do you mean?Like where do you go for fun?What would be on the agenda if you were out on the town with your girlfriends?I shook my head.I hate to disappoint, but Im not that exciting.I mean, I go to the same two bars everybody else goes to, but I dont even like them really.Lets not go to a bar.Alcohol lowers the inhibitions.Where else?Cmon, theres gotta be something.I searched my brain, wishing I had a spot as Liam had suggested.Then I realized I didI had mentioned it to him the other night.There is one place, I said.Terrific.Surprise me.Liam placed his hands over his eyes and stayed that way as I made an abrupt U turn and drove the short distance to Oceanside Plaza, a vast outdoor shopping mall by the beach where Sasha Myerss spa was located in a three story building separate from the others.The only other time I had snuck in after hours was on Gracies birthday when she had insisted I take her after a night of bar hopping.If I were you, Id do this all the damn time, she had said, arms outstretched on the marble ledge as she had drunkenly luxuriated in the hot tub.She doesnt even know I kept the key, I had told her, guilt ridden.Exactly, Holmes!Gracie had rolled her eyes at me, infuriated as ever by my squareness.She was the kind of person who got her thrills from breaking the rules, whereas I had spent that entire night checking the clock on my phone and peering into the parking lot for security guards.When I took Liam there, the parking lot attached to the mall was closed.They had recently started charging for parking and the ticket machine shut down at nine, so we parked on the street outside and hopped the measly two foot stucco barrier that surrounded the place.Oh, fantastic, are we getting the couples massage?Liam feigned a snobby accent as I unlocked the front door and disarmed the alarm system, using the code that Sasha had never changed from the manufacturer provided 1 2 3 4.I slipped in and waved him inside, noticing my hands slightly shaking as I fumbled for the key and locked the door behind us.There had been too much silence between us since we had gotten out of the car, and the awkwardness persisted as we rode the elevator to the rooftop.In fact, I was still auditioning various conversation starters as the elevator door opened and I led him out onto Sashas splashy sundeck.This was the pride and joy of the spa and probably my favorite place in all of Oceansidethere was a saline pool and a hot tub, and every inch of the roof was marble tiled.The minimalist deck chairs were all oriented toward the ocean, which was visible from three sides, and the waist high railings were made of glass so as not to obstruct the view.Slipping behind the elevator structure, I switched on the pool lights.Wow.Liam walked around the periphery and stopped to lean over the railing.This is some spot.I know, right?I sidled up next to him, fighting the urge to touch his shoulder or grasp his hand.There was a slight breeze but the air was still warm, left over from earlier when the temperature had reached 100 degrees in the middle of the day.The bright, silvery moon hung low in the sky.This night is perfect, I said.Liam grasped the railing with both hands.I fucking love the ocean, man.It reminds me of home.Not me.Where you from?Iowa.Yikes.I was there once.With your band?I asked the question even though I already knew the answer from my extensive online research.Yeah, with my band For a second it seemed like he was going to say more, but he stopped himself.Something had come over him at the mention of his past.I glanced at the side of his face to see how he looked, which seemed like a combination of sad and angry.Careful not to stare, I peered down at the ocean and followed the sleepy little waves with my eyes as they snuck onto the shore and quietly receded.Hey!Last one in the pools a rotten egg!Liam shouted, tearing away from the railing and ripping his jacket and shirt off on the way to the pool.At the edge, ready to jump in, he dropped his pants and boxers, and I saw the entire back of his body, naked, just before he dove.Now thats just unfair, I thought.Cmon!This feels great!Treading water, he ran his hands through his wet hair and nodded backward, beckoning me.I shook my head as I approached the pool, kicking off my flip flops to dip my feet in.From there, I stared at his body, illuminated by the lights in the pool, but the water moved too much for me to get a clear picture.Stop staring and get in already, he teased.Im not getting naked in front of you.Were supposed to be keeping each other out of trouble, remember?Who said skinny dipping was sexual?I find it quite chaste, actually.Back to nature, and all that.He smirked and held up an index finger, curling it toward him in the same sexy come hither maneuver he had used the first time he tried to seduce me.Sticking to my guns, I sat down on the pool ledge, pulled my dress up to my knees, and dropped my legs into the tepid water.I couldnt tell what was more refreshing, the saline pool water coursing around my legs or the fact that Id denied Liams request.Maybe I could handle being just friends after all.He waded up to me and grabbed my ankles, pretending to yank me into the pool.Youd better not!I warned, half of me wanting him to pull me in, the other half envisioning him climbing out of the pool and on top of me, smothering me with his slick, wet, naked body.Hey, thanks for bringing me here, he said.Stretching his arms out wide, he fell backward into the water and swam a lap of backstroke while inadvertently presenting his muscled torso and legs for me to peruse.By the time he reached the other end of the pool, Id unwittingly let my mouth fall open, something I only realized after he had flipped around to face me and mimicked my expression.Oh God.I used to work here, I said, averting my eyes to avoid any further humiliation.Its probably my favorite place in Oceanside, up here on the roof.I can see that.Whats yours?I glanced back at him as he waded toward me, slicking back his hair again.I dont know, Ive never thought about it As Liam got closer, I noticed his green eyes sparkling in the blue glow of the pool lights.It reminded me of the first time we met, when the church parking lot lights had lit up his eyes so that they looked almost iridescent.Probably my restaurant, he finally said.Its the only place I feel totally fulfilled, you know?I dont think about my problems when Im there.He chuckled to himself.Which is odd, because the restaurant has plenty of problems of its own.But you know what I mean.Who you are, your personal life, it all goes out the window when you have a business to run, food to cook.Is that how you used to feel when you performed?Like you forgot all your problems?I was doing the thing where I asked all the questions to ensure we didnt start talking about me, afraid of what I might reveal.No.It wasnt the same.I mean, I liked it when we were young.But later on, I ended up hating it being onstage.I felt like everybody was looking at me.I laughed at his seemingly obvious statement.Well, they kinda were.Yeah, thats not what I mean.I dont know.It felt intrusive.I didnt really like myself.It makes it hard.I nodded.I couldnt imagine having to stand onstage in front of thousands of people.I guess I always just assumed the myth about rock stars, like youre living everyones biggest fantasy.Well, theres that too.I definitely lived the fantasy, at least part of the time.Hey, is that a hot tub?He pointed to the other end of the pool.I nodded, trying to curb my enthusiasm at the thought of Liam making the journey from pool to hot tub naked.Do your lower legs want to come join me in the hot tub, then?Without waiting for an answer, Liam hoisted his drenched, naked body out of the pool directly beside me.Trickles of water dropped off of him and onto my shirt.The urge to stare was maddening, but I kept my eyes to myself, a wicked smile threatening to creep across my face.No!my inner voice chastised.No looking, no flirting, no touching.Poker faced and decidedly not staring at Liams ass, I followed him to the hot tub and, once again, sat on the side, this time as far away from him as possible.Inwardly, I gave myself a heartfelt congratulations for keeping my dress on and staying the course.If I had gone in the pool, all I would have thought about was whether or not he was looking at me, whether or not he was still attracted to me, or if somehow he had magically changed his mind about having sex with me again.So, hows it going with the eating?he said, seemingly out of nowhere.Pardon?I responded with arched eyebrows, immediately on the defense.Whenever I felt offended, I made a point of saying pardon instead of excuse me.For some reason, it seemed to convey more anger.You said you do the Overeater meetings, right?Yeah, well, anonymously I do.Well, friend, Im not trying to pry.Its just that you told me about it.He flashed a crooked smile, something that probably got him out of trouble more often than not.I figure its probably all in your head, though.I told you, I think you look great.I like a girl with a little meat on her.Ugh, please dont say that!My cheeks reddened.Why are you so insecure?I shook my head and redirected my attention to the stars, my feet nervously kicking back and forth underwater.I dont know.Anyway, OA is not about weight.Its about food ruling your life.Some people who go are totally average.Some are even thin.So why does food rule your life, then?Cmon, be real with me.My mother committed suicide when I was three.Whats your excuse?Oh my God, Im so sorry.I looked back at Liam, whose expression had turned serious.Its not your fault, he said.She threw herself off a bridge.When I was eighteen, I tried to do the same.Same bridge even.Wow, I said, at a loss for words.Liams abrupt confession had snapped me out of my insecure pity party, reminding me this was a troubled soul I was dealing with, even if he did come disguised in the body of Adonis.I didnt do it anyway.I came this close He held up his index finger and thumb for emphasis.But I didnt do it.So theres my most intimate fucking secret.Now whats yours?I dont know, nothing like that.Heres the thingI dont really like talking about myself, I said.Why not?You dont trust people?I shook my head, trying to find the right words to explain my unwillingness to share personal information.You dont trust men?To this I nodded.It was a knee jerk reaction, unintentionally honest.My dad left when I was eight.Whered he go?The Philippines.Never to return again?Nope.I rolled my eyes to feign indifference, feeling a trickle of sweat slowly making its way down my chest.I felt like running and hiding.Something about acknowledging that my dad had left long ago was nearly unbearable.When I had told Bradley the same thing, about a month into dating him, he had gone silent and then asked, without a hint of irony, So, does that mean you have daddy issues?Liam stood up from his seat in the hot tub and walked over to me, placing a warm, wet hand on my knee.The shock of his touch sent a wave of electricity up my leg.Thats rough, he said.Hey, at least he didnt commit suicide.The minute it came out, I regretted how flippant my comment sounded.Im sorry.That sounded horrible Listen, I never knew her.I cant remember her.Itd probably be just as hard if I knew she was in another country somewhere, ignoring me.Who knows?I looked into Liams iridescent eyes just inches from my own.He removed his hand from my knee and held it out for me to take.When I placed my hand in his, he tenderly kissed the top of it, the soft warmth of his lips against my skin causing me to shudder.My breath caught.I was overwhelmed by his touch, his proximity, my body stiffening in anticipation of what would come next.But nothing else happened.He released my hand and returned to his seat.My dad never talked about my mom growing up, he said.I guess he thought it was less painful that way.We didnt visit her grave or mention her on her birthday.Her side of the family lived eight hours away in a small town, and we never went to see them.He even hid all the pictures of her.I think he was worried I would ask too many questions if he left them out.Anyway, now I cant stop thinking about sex, go figure.Its the only thing Ive cared about since I was ten.Its why I started a band.We had groupies by the time we were fifteen, some of them in their twenties.I just had sex all the fucking time, like all the fucking time.Id try to keep a girlfriend every now and then but I cheated on all of them.The only solution I ever came up with was to avoid sex with real people as much as possible because it always turns to shit.But when I dont do it with women, I masturbate constantly.Except for these past few months.Bobbys really been helping me get better, even though hes a bit of a wanker.I laughed at the thought of Bobby ushering Liam away from me like a stern parent.Yeah, how was that guy ever a sex addict?I mean, who was he doing it with?Internet porn.Oh right.Liam stretched his arms behind him on the hot tub ledge and, for the first time that night, stared at mereally staredstudying my face in a way that made me feel shy.I leaned back on my hands and looked up at the sky, pretending not to careand part of me didnt.Somehow talking candidly about my dad had made me feel strangely free, like I had nothing to hide.Were underdogs, Mischa.And thats a good thing.Therere a lot of people walking around acting like theyve got no problems, no skeletons in their closet, and maybe they dont!But thats what makes us interesting.Youre a good egg, though, I can tell.Your mom probably never had to worry about you when you were younger.Only when I would binge eat half a weeks worth of food in one night, I said matter of factly.Liam looked at me in disbelief and we both laughed.I wanted to say something to prove that I wasnt as good as he thoughtsomehow that comment made me feel like he was distancing himself from me, even though he had meant it as a compliment.I lowered my voice in an attempt to sound confessional.Hey I had a dream about you the other night.I walked in on you with another girl, and then all three of us were having sex.Ooh!Thats not a good girls dream.Her name was Hadara.The other girl, I mean.He raised his eyebrows.Exotic!It all seemed very real.It made me think, you probably do that a lot, huh?Have threesomes?Eh.Not anymore.Theyre overrated.Of course he has an opinion on threesomes.Why?You know, its clich but the whole attention problem.Two people start to pair off and the third gets jealous.Did you ever have a threesome with another man?Liam looked at me for a while before answering.Yeah.I exhaled loudly without meaning to, recalling the day in seventh grade sex ed when the teacher talked about high risk behaviors and all the terrible afflictions that came along with them.A question that should have popped into my head the minute Id met him crossed my lips without warning.So do you get tested regularly?Im clean, he answered, a hint of defiance in his voice.And by the way, the time with the guy was in my early twenties.Of course!Im not judging you.Im sorry.I had a crush on a girl once.I just mentioned the testing thing because I meant to say it the other night.That was bad timing.I dont know why people take it so personally Mischa, he interrupted my rambling.Calm down.We were safe, and Im not taking it personally.Okay.All right.He lowered his arms back into the hot tub and watched the water as it bubbled up around him.A long pause followed.We had hit a wall.One of my legs kicked too hard and surfaced, sending a little splash of water into his face.Oops.Sorry, I said.I jokingly braced myself, and Liam waded over to me and grabbed my feet.I could do it!he said, and gave them a tug.You could be in here in two seconds flat!I wiggled my feet in his hands.Please have mercy on me, I begged.Liam bit his lower lip and tugged once more.Why do you make me feel giddy?he said.I chuckled, my cheeks aching from smiling so big.Ditto, I said.Liam sat down again.He let his arms float on the surface of the water.So what do you do?Other than run errands for that boring professor guy?I raised my eyebrows, surprised to hear Liam slight Julien.Obviously they hadnt hit it off when I had been hiding in the bathroom the other night.Well, Im working on a juice cleanse, I said, stretching out my legs in the water, and Im waiting to hear back from grad schools.I applied for some masters programs in nutrition.Liams face crumpled.He suddenly seemed distracted as he reached out for one of my toes.Do you think Im a slut?he said in a gloomy tone of voice.He pinched my toe and let it free again.No!I leaned forward to sit on my hands.I tried to make eye contact with him but he looked away.Yeah you do.How could you not?You think Im the slut thats going to give you AIDS, he said, and flicked at the water.I really dont.My heart was swelling.I wanted to comfort him; he seemed so vulnerable.Liam Never mind.Its getting hot in here.He rose from his seat, his naked torso in full view.We should probably go.
