Just as though what he said really didnt matter at all.Where is she?I ask after I swallow.I cant bring myself to say her name.Fable would like that.If she had a chance, I know shed scratch that bitchs eyes out.Shes still at the house.I asked her to leave and she refused.Dad wipes the corner of his mouth with his napkin.Not quite sure what Im going to do about that.I cant kick her outyet.She really has nowhere to go.And she was the mother of my child.Maybe.I swallow hard.Where will you go?He shrugs.Im staying at a hotel for the moment.And shell trip herself up.I have a plan.My appetite leaves me.If this is going to be an ugly divorce and Im somehow involved, I dont think I can take it.Whats your plan?His gaze is pointed again, directly aimed at me, and I want to squirm.Shes having an affair.I know it, I can feel it, but I dont have proof.My stomach churns.If this has anything to do with her and me, I dont know what Ill do.God, that was so long ago!No way could their current problems have anything to do with me.Who do you think shes messing around with?That Im not sure.Its only been going on for a few months, but I know shes involved with someone.And I dont think this is the first time shes done this sort of thing.Shit.My dads right.This isnt the first time.And I havent been with her in years, so Im sure I wasnt her only.More like the first in a long string of guys.She thrives on attention.Needs it like we need oxygen to breathe.Im sorry, Dad.I am.Im sorry that he has to go through this and deal with an evil, cheating, immoral bitch for a wife.He has no idea of the damage shes wrought to his family.My dads oblivious.He definitely has his faults.I know hes not perfectnone of us arebut I wouldnt wish this on him.He chose her, though.Now he has to deal with the fallout of their dissolving marriage.Dont be sorry.My dad waves his hand, dismissing my worry with a flick of his fingers.Shes a stupid bitch who finally ran out of options.Whoever shes fucking, I think he works at the country club.Shes slumming.Great.Dad must love this.And I think hes young, he continues.Shes dressing like shes twenty and listening to music that would only appeal to a silly teenage girl.I caught her working out in a Justin Bieber T shirt a few weeks ago while listening to some boy band.Shes too damn old to wear that sort of crap.What woman her age does that?I want to laugh, but I keep it to myself.Im not laughing at my dads irritation.More like at her desperation and the fact that she seems to like them young.I can either laugh or go into a complete rage.Shes disgusting.How do you know shes having an affair?Im not one hundred percent sure, but I hired a private investigator.Hes tailing her now.Finding out all her juicy secrets.Bitch doesnt stand a chance.Neither do I if he finds out the juicy secret I share with her.I hope it doesnt blow up in your face.How could it?Im not the one whos done wrong here.She is.Ive been faithful to her our entire marriage.My good friend guilt nestles in deep within me and I push my plate away.This is the last thing I want to hear.Id almost prefer it if my dad admitted hed cheated on Adele.Really, Dad?You can be honest with me, you know.Its not like Im going to tell.Really.His expression is hard; his eyes, as blue as mine, are cold.I loved her.Deep down inside, I still do.But I have to wonder if she ever loved me.How long has she been unfaithful?Who else is involved?How deep do her lies go?He shakes his head, his disgust clear.Shes wronged me.Made a fool of me in front of our friends.For all I know, shes been flaunting this boy toy of hers while Im out of town working.I dont know.You talk like you want to get revenge on her.I dont know how to react.Dont know what to say.His words fill me with fear.He could push her to admit things I never want her to confess.I dont know if Ive ever seen my dad like this.Maybe I do.He laughs, but its an angry sound, as if torn from his throat.Maybe I want to make her suffer.Make her look like a stupid slut.I gave her everything.When we first met, she was perfect.Beautiful, fun, thoughtful, and amazing in bed.I grimace.Last thing I want to hear.Didnt need to know that.Come on, Drew.Youre an adult.That sort of comment shouldnt bother you.He studies me.Now that I think of it, you havent mentioned your little girlfriend.Are you two still together?My entire body stiffens at the reminder of Fable.We broke up.Not really, but technically we were never together, so what else can I say?Thats a shame.His words are completely insincere.Not that I thought she was the sort of girl for you.What the hell is that supposed to mean?I growl, flexing my hands into fists.You know exactly what I mean.Shes the sort of girl you screw on the side, not the one you keep forever.I stand so fast I knock my chair into the person sitting behind me.My blood boiling, I glare at my father, but all I can see is red.You have no idea what youre talking about.Fable is one of the best people Ive ever known.Shes loyal, kind, sweet Dads gaze meets mine, his eyes full of contempt.Im making a scene and he doesnt like it.I really couldnt give a shit.If shes so great, why arent you with her?The truth falls from my lips with ease.Because Im not good enough for her.I leave the restaurant without another word.Fable You look different.I smooth my hand over my newly colored hair, my freshly painted nails catching my eye.Theyre red, as bright as the color coating my lips, and I feel like a different person.But I want to show indifference.As if this sort of thing is common for me.That handsome men who just so happen to be my boss whisk me to a popular and expensive hair salon in the late afternoon without an appointment and pay for my complete makeover.All the while hes standing by with a satisfied grin on his face, as if hes solely responsible for my transformation.Which he sort of is.I should be insulted.Colin taking me to the salon is basically saying I dont look good enough to work for him.That I need to change at least physically.But secretly, its also flattering, his attention.No one pays attention to me.They all just count on me to get stuff done.My mom, my brother, my old boss at La Salles yep, I gave notice this morning, finally.Drew paid attention for a little while, but hes too wrapped up in his own problems to worry about mine.I miss him.I hate that I miss him, but I do.Funny how someone can come into your life for such a brief time yet leave such a lasting impression.He permanently imprinted himself on my heart, and I permanently imprinted his name on my skin.Its silly, longing for a man who doesnt long for me.Your hair the blond is darker.Jennifer smiles at me, nodding with approval.I like it.Suits you better.Colin is a great boss, but he employs a bunch of bitches at his restaurant.And Im starting to realize why theyre so bitchy were all in direct competition with one another, not only for being the most wanted waitress at The District, thus getting the most in tip money at the end of the evening, but also to be the most wanted waitress in Colins eyes.Which is all sorts of fucked up if I think about it too long.So I banish the realization from my brain, something Im so good at.Jennifer so far has been the nicest to me, but she was the new girl on the block until I showed up, so shes probably thankful theres a fresh target here for them to hate.Shes pretty in an exotic, almost mysterious way, which I find amusing considering her standard, every girl name.She has long straight as paper black hair, large dark brown eyes, and olive colored skin, and shes so incredibly tall, I get a crick in my neck if I stare up at her for too long.Shes everything Im not.Were complete opposites in every way.Did Colin take you to get your hair done?she asks as we set the tables for the evening.Im doling out the silverware, shes setting out the freshly polished glasses, and Im so startled by her question, I stand there with my mouth hanging open for a second.Long enough that she speaks again.Its okay to admit it.He took me for a haircut and mini makeover when I first started.She smiles, her cheeks tinged red.Colin likes to take in strays and fix them up.Bring us to our full potential, is how he phrased it to me.Her words make me feel the tiniest bit less special, and I want to smack myself.Dont you think thats sort of Weird?she finishes for me with a rueful smile.Yeah.I finish setting the silverware on the table and watch her as she carefully adjusts the last water glass, placing it sit just so.The table linens are a perfect, creaseless white, with an equally perfect silver bowl sitting in the middle, full of freshly cut flowers the colors of spring.All vibrant pinks and lavenders and whites, they add a touch of sophisticated glamour to an otherwise plain palette.The entire restaurant is like this.Sexy yet restrained elegance.No wonder all the beautiful people love to come here.Colin likes to think of himself as a knight in shining armor to all of us.Like he swooped in and rescued us from our horrible lives and gave us new ones, Jennifer explains.I frown.I dont need someone in my life with a hero complex.With Drew, I was the one with the hero complex, and that got me absolutely nowhere.And why the hell does everything still have to come back to him?I need to let him go, once and for all.Thats ridiculous, I say.Jennifer shrugs.Its the truth, isnt it?Where were you working before?I was at some crappy bar on the outskirts of town, where the customers couldnt keep their hands off me.I hated it.Colin came in there one night over a month ago, all clean and golden and shiny.He practically begged me to come work for him, but I didnt trust him.Her eyes darken even more, shading secrets from me, Im sure.It was just before Christmas, and I was pretty much broke and alone.He took me in and I havent looked back since.Took you in what do you mean?Im staying at his house.Her gaze skitters away from mine.Im not the first.I wont be the last.Wow.Hes like the Pied Piper, and we all follow after him like a bunch of hypnotized mice.I feel like a fool for thinking the attention he gave me was special.Unusual.I was just another in a long list of girls who work here hes taken under his wing.Im such a skeptic, I still cant help but wonder if he has an ulterior motive.Theres a private party coming in at nine.Tenerria walks into the dining area, her demeanor all business.Shes the shift manager, having worked with Colin at his previous restaurants.He brought her with him to help open The District and Im not sure if shes a permanent fixture or eventually moving on.I respect the hell out of T, which everyone calls her, but she also scares the crap out of me.Fifteen confirmed college football players celebrating a twenty first birthday, so be prepared.That confirmed number will probably fly out the window.My heart drops to my toes.Football players.Could Drew be one of the people coming tonight?Hes not one to be social, and last I heard because the rumor mill is rampant in this small townDrew had left.Not that I ever pay too much attention to rumors.Theyre usually all lies.Im throwing you to the wolves tonight, Fable, T continues, a smile curling her bright red lips.Were all wearing the new uniform Colin gave us earlier: black shorts, white lace tops with a black bra underneath.I added the black heels that I teeter precariously on.He even gave us the same lipstick, so that wed all match.You and Jen both are working the private party.We have an extra bartender on staff as well, so you should be set.Nerves eat at my stomach.Okay, I say weakly.Being around football players will make me think of Drew.Plus, theyll probably give me shit because yep, Im ashamed to say, Ive been with a few.Nothing major, mostly make out/grope sessions, but still.It was back when my self esteem was in tatters and I thought their attention was the only kind I deserved.So embarrassing!I hope they dont say anything rude.More than anything, I hope Drews not there.Okay, I lie.A teeny tiny part of me hopes Drew shows up.Not that I know what Id say to him.Fuck you for stomping all over my heart!Hmm, yeah.That would go over real well.What do you think of the new duds?T asks.I glance down at myself.The shorts are extra short but at least Im not in a dress, where Im always afraid my ass is hanging out.And the lace tops are most definitely see through, but I dont feel like my goods are on blatant display.Im always afraid Ill get cold, but theres too much running around throughout the evening for that to happen.I like them.I do, too, Jen pipes up, moving so she stands beside me.I prefer the shorts to the dresses.Feels like I can move better in them.Same.I nod in agreement.Why did he pick out new clothes for us?And even gave us all matching lipstick?Saying the question out loud makes me realize just how odd the situation is.I mean, who does this sort of thing?He likes all of us to look the same yet different.Bring some of our own personality to the outfit, you know?T runs her gaze over Jen and me.I know you were just given the outfits but the next time you work, make sure you add something to give yourself a little more pizazz.Individuality.What if I cant afford it?I had to ask.Im mostly a broke joke.The biggest extravagance Ive given myself is the damn tattoo with the initials of a man who ditched me.The expensive shoes I wear?A gift from Drew.The same ones I wore the night of that crazy country club dinner, when he kissed me for the first time.Just the memory of his lips grazing mine sends a shiver stealing over me.Fable, you can go to one of those cheap stores in the mall and pick up a three dollar necklace.Theres Target and Walmart, too.Shaking her head, T starts to walk away.Get those tables set up.Doors open in fifteen!Jen and I busily finish setting up the tables, polishing glass, lighting candles, and sweeping the bare wood floors.Colin comes in, offering murmured words to Jen I cant quite catch before he locks his gaze with mine and heads toward me.Much improved, he says, stopping directly in front of me, crossing his arms in front of his chest.Hes wearing a black T shirt that stretches across his wide shoulders and chest and black pants.The dark clothing only seems to emphasize the golden hair, the golden skin, and the pale blue eyes.Ugh!I hate that Im noticing this.And I hate how proprietary he seems.Yet that approving light in his gaze secretly pleases me.Makes me want to stand tall and preen like a good little girl whos done right.Sick and twisted, I know.You were there for the transformation yesterday.It had taken hours.We finally left the salon after nine.Luckily enough, I wasnt scheduled last night and considering he was the boss, he could show up at the restaurant whenever he felt like it.Hed even driven me home.Now hes acting as if he hadnt seen the end results last night.Weird.Youre right.I was.But its different, seeing you here tonight.In your element.He flicks his chin in my direction.Like the new uniforms?They were proving to be the hottest topic of conversation around here.Kind of see through, but yeah, I like them.Im glad.Reaching out, he squeezes my arm as he passes.Nice shoes, he tosses out over his shoulder.A little smile curls my lips and I glance up, catching Jennifer watching me with a narrowed gaze.She turns and leaves before I can say anything and I watch her retreating back, wondering what that was all about.Wondering what sort of weird little love triangle I mightve let myself walk into.I hate the idea of anyone else having you.Drew Callahan  Drew They scream and shout my name the second I slip inside the private room at The District, the new restaurant where Logans party is being held.Every one of my teammates is already shitfaced and its only ten.I can see it in their blurry eyes and red cheeks, hear it in their too loud voices.But hey, at least theyre happy to see me.I figured Id become the enemy.The asshole who lost their chance at a bowl game.Wed been close, so close every one of us had started to taste that faint glimmer of victory.Then I met a girl, we went home together, and I let everything that happened there fuck my head all up.Stupid.Logan approaches and gives me a shoulder slapping hug.He reeks of alcohol and I push away from him, startled when Jace appears by my side, placing a beer in my hand and telling me to drink up.I dutifully do as Im told, ready to lose myself for at least a few hours.The visit with my dad had turned tense the moment he insulted Fable.Crazy, considering we werent together anymore, but I wasnt going to stand by and let him say rude crap about her.Truthfully, she was above all of us and I refuse to let him drag her through the mud, even if it was only to me.After that fiasco of a lunch, he dealt constantly with Adele calling him, texting him, calling him again.I didnt need that reminder, so I stayed away.Which meant we were apart for much of his visit, until he finally told me this morning he needed to go back home and attend to business.Bullshit.Business was code for Adele.I didnt call him on it, merely nodded and let him go.Promising him wed get together again soon.Yeah, right.I dont see that happy reunion happening anytime soon.Youve been in hiding, Logan says as he sits next to me, a drink clutched in his hand.His head lolls, as if he cant quite keep it upright, and I shake my head, chuckling as I sip from my beer.Sierra Nevada, the beer of choice in this townits about the only kind I can drink.The rest tastes like swill.Ive been around, I say with a shrug.Lying low.Taking fewer classes this semester.I needed a break.I get it, man.I get it.And hey, dont let Coach mess with your head.It wasnt your fault, our spectacular losses at the end of the season.Logans expression goes serious.As serious as it can go, considering how drunk he is.We all sorta fucked up, you know?I take another, bigger swig of beer.I need it, since the topic of conversation has veered in a serious direction.You think so?I wonder if hes just feeding me a line.Definitely.He nods eagerly, his head still bobbing.Im glad youre here, man.You never go out with us.I feel like Im special or something, you showing up for my birthday and shit.Not every day a jackass like me turns twenty one.We both laugh.Youre right.Youre a total jackass.Not really.Logans a decent guy.And besides, I couldnt sit at home with my thoughts any longer.I was driving myself crazy.Logan grins.You need to hang out with us more.Wait until you see the waitresses who are ours for the night.Theyre fucking hot.One of them everyone knows, some blond groupie with an amazing ass.The other one is tall and dark.Looks like a damn model.An uneasy sensation slides through me at the description of the blonde, but I push it aside.What are the odds?And there are plenty of blond team groupies out there.Cute, huh?I feign interest.Cute doesnt begin to describe either of them.Theyre complete opposites and completely hot.Logan tilts his head back so it bumps the back of the chair.I need to get laid, he says at the ceiling.I havent had sex as a twenty one year old yet.I think tonight calls for a celebration of the get laid kind.Im surprised theres no girls here.My teammates are known for having crazy parties with half naked girls in attendance.Half the reason why I would never go half naked females coming at me used to scare the shit out of me.They still make me uncomfortable because they always, always want something I cant give them.Like my attention, my time.Forget that shit.Theres only one half naked female I would welcome with open arms if she came at me right now.And she hates me.Oh, the girls are coming later.Logan smiles and closes his eyes.Actually, were going to go and see them.Promise me youll come with us.Uh Sounds like a nightmare.Logan cracks open his eyes.Promise me.Ill start shouting and making a scene if you dont promise.Fine, fine, Ill go.I have no idea what I just agreed to but it cant be good, judging by the sight of the wide smile Logans wearing.Besides, hell probably shout and make a scene no matter what I say.A tall, dark haired girl enters the private room, a smile curving her full red lips as she starts passing out drinks from the heavy tray she carries.She comes to me after she empties her tray, her dark brown gaze connecting with mine.Ah, a fresh face.I see you have a beer already, but do you need anything else?Something to eat, another drink?Get him a shot, Logan says, his voice already slurred.Tequila.Patrn.She looks at me expectantly but shes talking to Logan.Only one shot, birthday boy?Get us a round of eight.What the hell?Im not doing a bunch of shots with you.I dont care if its your birthday or not.Dont be such a downer.Logan waves a hand.Eight shots of Patrn, pretty lady.Hey, what are you doing later?Wanna come with us when we take the party to our next stop?She laughs and shakes her head.Sorry, I work until one.I appreciate the offer, though.Her gaze meets mine once more.Another beer, maybe?Sure.I shrug.Ill do one shot and the second beer and then Im done.Being drunk means being out of control, and I dont like that.Turning on her heel, she threads her way through the crowded room, earning more than a few appreciative glances and low whistles.The minute shes gone, they all start talking about her.Her ass, her tits, her pretty face.She has a mouth made for cock sucking, Jace says with all the authority in the world.I nod in agreement, feeling like an ass for doing even that.Put a bunch of guys together, fill them with alcohol, and we turn into complete assholes.Wait till you see the other one, Logan pipes up.Talk about a mouth made for cock sucking.And from what I hear, shes done that and more with a few lucky bastards that are here tonight.Laughter rings throughout the room.Logan says it loud enough and I know.I know without a doubt theyre talking about Fable.She admitted it to me when we were together.How she messed around with a few of my teammates, though she said she never took it too far.Had she lied?Just trying to save face so she wouldnt look like a slut?I dont think shes a slut.You thought she was a slut when you hired her to be your fake girlfriend.Thats the reason you chose her.I shove the irritating as shit voice out of my head and finish off my beer.The alcohol is already working its magic, sliding through my veins, buzzing through my head.Miss Tall, Dark, and Pretty shows back up relatively quick, handing a fresh beer over to me with a smile before she lines up the eight shots of Patron in front of Logan with a little flourish.He immediately takes a near overflowing shot glass and raises it toward me.Come on, Callahan.I grab one, a few other guys grab one as well, and were all clinking glasses, saluting Logan before we down them simultaneously.The tequila burns down my throat and I grimace, laughing when Logan shoves another shot glass into my hand, and I toss that one back, too.Within minutes Im feeling no pain.Fuck my problems, Im good.Ive polished off three shots and two beers and nothing can hurt me.Nothing.Until the girl I love more than anyone else in the world strides into the room looking like my every fantasy come to life.Fable I told myself again and again no way would Drew be here.And then I enter the private room where the partys being held to relieve Jen so she can take a break, and there he is.Breathtakingly gorgeous, looking as shocked as I feeland drunk.I see it in his eyes, his expression, in the wobbly way he jumps to his feet as if hes going to come for me.But then its as if he remembers himself, remembers where hes at.He settles back into his chair, laughing at whatever the guy sitting next to him is saying, but his gaze never, ever leaves me.I want to run to him.I want to run away from him.Holy shit, this is so not how I saw it going down when I finally came face to face with him again!Youre looking good, Fable.One of the senior football playersI think his name is Tad?Ty?eyes me, his mouth curved in a knowing smirk.Knowing because yes, hes a shameful moment from my past.Barely out of high school and so eager to please, I used to watch the team practice, sitting on the sidelines in the heat of the summer in my too short shorts and my skimpy tank top.Tad, Ty, whatever his name is asked me out, and I accepted and ended up giving him a blow job while in his car on our first and only date.Not one of my proudest moments.But at the time, I cherished the attention he gave me.I was so needy, so foolish.Of course, the jerk never called.Not that I wouldve gone out with him again.One awkward blow job was more than enough between us, thank you very much.Thanks.I smile, pretending I dont know him.Would you like to order something else?Yeah.He moves in close.Hes tall and broad, all muscle, with dark hair buzzed short and a nasty gleam in his eyes.I step back and he grabs my arm, holding me close to him.Dipping his head, his mouth is next to my ear as he asks, How about another blow job later tonight?I pull out of his grip, anger blazing through me so strong my bodys shaking.Fuck off, I mutter and turn away from him, his gritty laughter following me as I push through the throng of well muscled athletes that crowd the room.All the while Im trying my best to avoid Drew.I can feel his eyes on me.I know he sees me, is watching me, and I dont want to approach him.What would I say?What would I do?I both want to throw myself into his arms and throw a right hook into his perfect square jaw.He asks me to rescue him and then he ditches me.Tells me he loves me in a note and never replies to my calls or texts.Hes a jerk.Hes an asshole.Im in love with a jerky asshole and damn, thats painful to admit.Gathering my bearings, I take orders, clear empty bottles and glasses, and lollygag enough in the hope that I wont make it to the back left corner.I finally flee the stifling room minutes later, leaning against the wall for a few seconds, desperate to catch my breath.I didnt expect this, yet part of me did.I thought I could handle seeing him, but I cant.This situation Im in is hopeless.I hate that he didnt approach me and Im so thankful he didnt.I probably wouldve done something really stupid.Like beg him to tell me why.Thats all that keeps running through my head as I stand at the bar minutes later, waiting for my orders to be filled.Why did he leave me?Why didnt he ever call me back?Why didnt he text me?That was the absolute least he could have done.Text me back a simple were done.I wouldve let him go.I wouldve been hurt, angry, and sad, but I couldve handled it.It would have been better than how he actually did treat me.The asshole.Why, asshole?That might be a fun way to confront him.But knowing Drew, hed run.Hes real good at that.Running.I take my full tray of drinks back into the party room, the anxious nerves running through me making my knees shake.The guys are even rowdier than when I left them only minutes before, giving me an endless bunch of grief, talking dirty, talking loud.Theyre keeping a running tab; Logans parents arranged the party since theyre bazillionaires who live in Marin County, and I bet theyre going to end up spending about two months of my wages tonight in a matter of hours.Crazy.So, Fable.Its Ty again.I heard someone call him that, not Tad.Nice that he made such an impression I cant even remember his name.I promised Logan you would give him a special birthday present.I roll my eyes, offering a sweet smile to the birthday boy.Im not about to insult him.His parents are spending the big bucks so he can celebrate like a drunken frat jock.Dont make promises you cant keep, Ty.Logan laughs, his gaze never leaving me.Hes wobbling on his feet, his eyes are bloodshot, and I know hes good and drunk.No surprise, though, since he just turned twenty one.This sort of drunken evening celebrating a twenty first birthday is a ritual in these parts.I told him Im sure I could arrange a blow job just for him.Ty smiles, though it never reaches his eyes.From you.My smile fades, replaced by a scowl.I want to sock this asshole in his smug face, but I restrain myself.Ive worked here only a week.I cant screw this up.The money is too good.And this place is way classier than La Salles.But still full of drunk jerks.I cant escape them no matter how hard I try.Very funny, I say, trying to keep it light.I turn away from them, ready to gather more discarded glasses and bottles, but Ty reaches out and grabs my arm.Again.Stopping me in my tracks.I glare at him over my shoulder and tug.Let go of me.Say youll do it.His voice is firm, his gaze like ice.Say youll give Logan a blow job.Its his birthday.A hummer is the least you can give him.No.I try to escape his grip but its like a vise.Get your hands off me.Not until you swear youll give him a BJ.Come on.Not like you havent given it up practically to the entire team.His voice is firm as he steps closer to me.Say it, Fable.Say youll do it.My knee twitches.I want to slam him in the balls with it.I cant believe hes talking to me like this.Looking at me like he wants to tear me apart.What a pervert.Ty, let her go, Logan says, his voice timid.Shut up.Ty never looks away from me and he pulls me even closer, though my feet drag, making me stumble.I so dont want to be close to this guy.He gives me the creeps.Stop pretending youre a good little girl, Fable.You know all about getting on your knees and sucking cock, am I right?His words offend the hell out of me and I part my lips, ready to read him the riot act, when all of a sudden, all the hairs on my body are standing on end.Im hyperaware someone is behind me.I can feel his warmth, his strength.Smell him.Clean and fresh and so deliciouslyDrew.Let her go, Ty, before I break every fucking bone in your body.His voice is low, menacing.I wouldnt fuck with him if he sounded like that to me.Anger makes his deep voice vibrate and a shiver slithers down my spine.Show the lady some respect.Ty releases me with a little shove.Shaking his head, he laughs, though he doesnt sound amused.Pissed is more like it.Like this whore is a lady.And since when the hell do you care about chicks, Callahan?I always wondered if you preferred dick.Dont be an asshole, Logan starts, and Ty glares at him.I inhale on a sharp breath, my entire body tingling when Drew settles his hand low on my back so he can guide me out of his way.And lunges straight toward Ty.Drew, no!I shout as I leap back from the fray.One second everyone is having a good time, the next theres a damn riot.All the guys run toward Drew and Ty, who are both struggling to get that first punch in.I grab hold of a belt loop on Drews jeans and tug, screaming at him to stop, and finally he glances up, his beautiful and wild blue eyes meeting mine.Stop!I repeat, desperate to keep my voice calm.Please.Before you get in trouble.He pushes Ty away from him and stands, wiping the corner of his mouth with the back of his hand.His gaze locks on me, anger radiating from him in tangible waves, and I swallow hard, trying my best to keep my composure.But damn, Drew Callahan is hot when hes mad.He called you a whore, he mutters, the fury in his eyes igniting to full on flame.I dont think Ive ever seen him this angry.Lots of guys call me a whore, I say, my cheeks heating with embarrassment.Its true and I hate it, but Ive made my own whorish bed and on occasion, I have to lie in it.I wont fucking stand for it, Fable.Hearing him say my name sends pleasure washing through me, leaving me weak kneed.Ive missed him so much and to have him here, standing in front of me, despite the crappy circumstances, fills me with so much happiness tears threaten to spring.I blink them back, feeling infinitely stupid.I dont need a knight in shining armor.Funny, thats the second reference tonight to noble knights.And Im lying.I do need someone to come and rescue me.And I still want it to be him.Drew.Right.Of course you dont.Youre stronger than the rest of us, right?Sure as hell stronger than me.He turns away and leaves me without another word.I stare, gaping at his retreating back, wondering what the hell provoked that comment.What did I do to deserve his anger?Isnt he the one who ditched me?I refuse to feel guilty.I refuse to chase after him and ask him why.Ask him if hes okay.Ask him if hes still talking to that horrendous bitch who fucked up his head so thoroughly.Furious, I grab my empty tray and gather beer bottles, stacking them until theyre rolling back and forth, clanking against one another.Jen finally enters the room, oblivious to the ruckus that just played out only minutes earlier, and I smile in relief when she approaches.Why is it so quiet in here?she asks.A couple of them almost got into a fight.I decided not to mention that the fight was about me.Jen rolls her eyes and starts to help me clear the tables.Figures.Get a bunch of testosterone laden men in close proximity and watch them beat their chests until they prove whos the mightiest of them all.I dont answer.I continue to clean up and then stalk out of the room toward the bar, where I dump everything in the trash, the bottles again clanking together with an immensely satisfying sound.Irritation makes me want growl at anyone who so much as looks in my direction.Shit!Im dying for a smoke.Whats your problem?T appears out of nowhere, startling me.Uh I dont know what to say.Dont want to bitch for fear of looking like I cant handle my job.Dont want to tell her what happened, either, since she might ask me why they were fighting and how I became involved.So instead, I shrug.Men suck.Well.Thats close enough to the truth.Her expression changes to pure sympathy.Yeah, they do.Listen.Go cool off for a few.You look ready to blow a gasket.But I just took a break Ill cover for you.Youve got five minutes.T smiles, pats my arm, and heads for the private party room.And I dart outside for that much needed smoke.None of your scars can make me love you less.Unknown  Drew Shes gone.One minute shes in the same fucking room as me, breathing the same air, and then Ty Webster has to act like a disgusting pig and insult her.The girl I love.The girl who I havent been with in so long, just seeing her steals my breath and hurts my heart.So I did what any guy wouldve done to defend his girl.I went after Ty.Was ready to beat the shit out of him, too, until all my teammates came at us to break us up.And Fable.Staring at me, grabbing me and trying to pull me off of him.I let her.I looked her right in the eyes and listened to her soft pleas.I left Ty alone all for her.I wouldve also kicked his ass for her.Even though shes not really my girl anymore.And whose fault is that?Dude, you need to go apologize to Ty.Logan is in my face, looking a little more sober.I think the argument sobered up a lot of us.I cant have my friends fighting on my birthday.Tell him to apologize to Fable and then well talk.I shake my head, my earlier buzz gone, gone, gone.Which sucks, because it helped me forget, even for a little while.But then she had to walk into the room.Beautiful and sexy, and everything Ive ever wanted.Something was a little off about her appearance, though.She looked like my Fable, yet she didnt.Who the hell is Fable?Logan frowns.The waitress he called a whore.I can barely get the word out Im so pissed.Logan sighs.You know how he is.Chicks dont mean shit to him.Yeah, well, he needs to learn some respect.Before Im tempted to go back and finish what I started with Ty, I leave the room and head down the narrow hall, where I spot a door that leads outside to the back of the restaurant.I need to cool off.Get my head back together.Maybe just flat out bail.Im sure no one wants me around anymore.I tried to start a fight with one of my teammates over a girl they all consider a whore, and that kills me.Bros before hos, and all that other bullshit.No matter that were not really together anymore, Fable will always come first.I push open the door and find myself in a narrow alley.The unmistakable scent of cigarette smoke lingers in the air and I glance to my right to find her.Fable.Sitting on the edge of an overturned giant plastic crate, puffing away on a cancer stick like its her last salvation.Smoking kills, you know.I said that to her the night of the country club dinner.The night I first kissed her, first learned her taste, how she felt beneath my hands, the breathy little sounds she makes when shes becoming aroused.She sends me a withering stare, accompanied by an exhale of smoke in my direction.Then leave so you dont have to breathe my cancerous air.Im rooted to the spot.Afraid to approach her for fear shell tell me to fuck off, which I deserve.Im glad I found you.I wanted to talk to you.Really?She arches a brow, her cigarette dangling from her fingers.What more could you have to say?I mean, I got your message pretty loud and clear after I didnt hear from you.Youre right.It was a dick move.I totally deserve your anger.I take a deep breath.Listen, I know what I did was wrong.I shouldnt have walked away from you.You didnt just walk away.You stayed away for over two months.Probably wouldve been longer, too, if you hadnt seen me tonight, right?Were you just going to avoid me forever?She bends over and stubs the cigarette out in the tray thats sitting at her feet.I stare at Fable, overcome with having her in front of me after not being near her for so long.Shes beautiful, pissed at me, and soGod.I dont even know what to think.Seeing her again is like having a million electric shocks jolting through my veins, both paralyzing me and goading me into action.Im overcome.All I know is I need her.Now more than ever.I dont know what I was going to do, I finally say.Typical.I feel like a doll.Like a stupid, pretty doll no one cares about, forgotten on a shelf.Every once in a while, you or whoever else wants to take me down from the shelf and play with me for a bit.Just enough to get my hopes up and make me believe someone really cares about me.Then Im forgotten again.Like I dont even exist.She tosses her head back and gazes up at the dark sky.My mom was pretty dead on when she named me Fable, wasnt she?I dont feel real to anyone.Youre real to me, I whisper.So damn real, it hurts not to touch her.I want her in my arms so bad its killing me.She stands and crosses her arms in front of her chest, plumping up her breasts in the sexy as hell black bra that I can see through the thin white lace shirt she has on.The outfit kills me.I want to both tear it off of her and throw a coat over her shoulders so no other guy can see her like this.I cant do this, Drew.I cant pretend like seeing you after so long is no big deal when really my heart is cracking in two.A laugh escapes her, though it lacks humor.I think its best if we stay away from each other.Having you in front of me hurts too much.My heart bottoms out.Completely.I cant believe shes saying this.Fighting the panic that threatens to sweep me under, I step closer to her.Fable She steps back, looking scared, as if she has nowhere to go, and that makes me feel like shit.You should go.I take another step toward her, and she takes another one back, bumping against the wall behind her.Shes trapped, she knows it, and all I can think is thank God she cant run away from me.You dont want me to leave.Yes, I do.She nods, her expression firm, but her voice is weak.I move in so close I invade her personal space.Her warmth, her scent wraps around me, intoxicating me, and I brace my hands on the wall above her head, my arms bracketing her.Ive got her completely caged in, and as I gaze down at her pretty, angry upturned face, all I can think is how much I want to kiss her and smudge that bright red lipstick all to hell.How late do you work?I ask, my voice low, my thoughts dirty.I want to get her home.Naked.In my bed.Impossible considering how Ive ruined this fragile thing between us, but I have hopes I can turn everything around.The trembling in her body is a clue shes not over me.The way shes looking at me with all that pent up longing in her gaze tells me I still have a chance.
