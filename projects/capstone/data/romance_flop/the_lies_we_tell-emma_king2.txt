Everyone but me, that is.Coming?Senator Cooper asked, looking at me questioningly.I dont think I really have a choice.Agent Flynn waved me forward.You dont.The penthouse suite was impressive, but I was too distracted to fully appreciate it.More agents milled about the main room, talking on cell phones and making plans in loud voices.Agent Flynn pointed to an oversized couch on the far side of the room.Have a seat and get comfortable.Youll be here for a while.He hurried away without a backward glance, marching straight into the bedroom and closing the door decisively behind him.Senator Cooper and I didnt speak as we crossed the room and took seats next to each other, keeping a good amount of distance between us.I turned my attention to the television in the corner which had been turned to the local news.An attractive redhead in a skin tight blue dress was standing just outside our hotel, looking serious but still sexy as she broke the news of the almost incident that had just occurred.Why the big deal?I wondered out loud.Sure, a few important people were at the event but it wasnt like someone had been shot.Senator Cooper pointed to the bedroom.I think it might have something to do with the VIP hiding in the bedroom.What VIP?I hadnt seen anyone but Agent Flynn enter that room.Vice President Anderson is in there.He was standing next to me when the chaos went down and he was the first person escorted up here.The senator turned back to the television looking bored.So much for women and children first...I suppose you expect me to thank you for saving my life.I gave him a look that said I felt the exact opposite of grateful.He shot me a surprised glance.Did I say something wrong?I shook my head, still feeling unsettled by the turn of events.No, forget it.Im still frazzled I guess.Lets start over, he suggested, offering his hand.Im Nick Cooper.I laughed involuntarily as I shook his hand.I know who you are, Senator.Nick, please, he said almost pleadingly.So you know who I am, but I still dont know who you are.Charley.Charley Tanner.Nick raised a questioning eyebrow and I continued, Its kind of a nickname.I realize Charley isnt a typical name for a woman.No objections from me.I like it.Nick smiled for the first time revealing two rows of perfect white teeth.The smile erased at least ten years from his face and he no longer looked like Senator Cooper.I hope no one is waiting for you.Im sorry?My mouth suddenly felt very dry.Nick chuckled.That didnt come out right.I just meant, you were on your way out when all this happened, so I hope you werent meeting someone or they will either be very worried or very mad.Oh.I had almost forgotten that I had been about to leave the hotel; that seemed like such a long time ago.No, I wasnt meeting anyone.I was just going home.Was it really so boring that you needed to leave before ten oclock?Nick tugged at the knot of his tie, loosening it imperceptibly.Im not much of a socialite.So what brought you to the event then?I considered my answer and decided to go with the truth.You.Me?Nick coughed.Well you certainly are forward.I shrugged.My brain is too fried to come up with a believable lie.You didnt come here to kill me, did you?Nicks joke fell flat as one of the secret service agents entered the suite and went directly to the bedroom door.I came to schmooze you actually.Voices were being raised on the other side of the bedroom wall.I work for Eva Porter and Children First.Ah, Eva.I know her well.Nick smiled reluctantly.This is about Bill 132?Your vote is key.It can make or break your future in politics.Im sure you dont need me to tell you that.I had read a lot about Senator Cooper in the news over the past couple of years and I knew he was as politically savvy as they came.You want to be on the right side of this one.And the right side is your side?I know we dont know each other, Senator, but one thing you should know about me is that Im always right.Nick.Call me Nick.His blue eyes flashed and he leaned forward intently.Tell me something, Charley.Why this bill?Why do you care enough about this bill to come to an event hoping for two minutes of my evening to give me the same pitch Ive already heard a dozen times?I couldve told him right then, the whole truth.My truth was powerful enough to convince him.But I had never told anyone that truth, and I wasnt ready to start now.After what almost happened tonight, do you really need a reason?Someone was able to get within a few feet of the Vice President of the United States while carrying a gun.Isnt that reason enough?No.Nick shook his head.Its not enough.Passing this bill doesnt guarantee that all the bad guys will stop finding ways to kill people.Im sure you can agree with that.Life doesnt have any guarantees, but that doesnt mean you give up.I could feel a familiar annoyance building.Look, people speed every day, but that doesnt mean we get rid of speed limits.Its safer to drive slower, so we pass laws to that effect.Bill 132 is the same thing.Yeah, some bad guys are still going to get guns but we should make it as hard as we can for them.What about the Second Amendment?Stop.Youre not honestly going to argue that the Second Amendment was intended to protect a potential criminals right to own an assault weapon, are you?I groaned and felt slightly better when I saw the corner of Nicks lips twitch as he fought back a smile.No, I wasnt going to argue that.I was just trying to annoy you.Now he let himself smirk.Has anyone ever told you that your nostrils flare adorably when you are irritated?Has anyone ever told you that you are kind of an ass?I smiled sweetly.Too many people to count, he answered easily.I really wanted to stay annoyed but he was too darn charming.Nick wasnt like the other politicians I had met in Washington; he didnt seem to be at all impressed by his status and even seemed a bit embarrassed by it.We had been on lockdown for at least thirty minutes and he hadnt checked his cell phone once even though I heard it vibrating nonstop in his pocket.Not that this hasnt been a knee slapping good time but how long do you think they are going to keep us here?I nodded toward two agents lurking in the far corner of the room.No clue.Nick shot me a sidelong glance.For a bit longer I hope.Really?I raised a surprised eyebrow.Nick patted the suit pocket that held his phone.The real world waits on the outside.Plus theres the stimulating conversation weve been having.Id rather be watching bad reality television right now.But even as I said the words I realized they were a lie.I enjoyed talking to Nick Cooper, even if it meant being locked in a room swarming with secret service agents.We could bust open the mini bar and get drunk if youd like, Nick offered.I like the way you think, Senator Cooper.The mini bar was well stocked and we had no problem finding a few drinks to take the edge off our tense situation.After three drinks made from overpriced mini bottles of vodka, I managed to forget that I had only known Nick for the last two hours.
