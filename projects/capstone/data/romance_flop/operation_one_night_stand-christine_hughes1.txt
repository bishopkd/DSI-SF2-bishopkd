I had commandeered the sofa.The beautiful, butter yellow sofa Sarah had purchased when she first moved to her amazingly spacious two bedroom apartment almost three years ago now probably had a permanent imprint of my ass.The cushions had become a wasteland overflowing with wads of snotty tissues, and creamy brown stains from my new, aptly named addictionPint of Tearssmeared the arm.My trusty sidekick, Mr.Bibbles, a childhood stuffed thingI wasnt sure anymore if he ever really was a bearlay oddly contorted at my side.For five years, Steven and I dated.Lived together.Worked together.Dreamed together.That was before it all went to shit.That was before I found him in my bed with Betsy the Intern.That was before he figured it was okay to forget about the fact that he was my fianc.That was before I found myself homeless, refusing to ask my parents for help.I showed up with nothing but a suitcase full of crapand Mr.Bibblesat Sarahs door.I didnt even have to ask.Within twenty four hours, my room was decorated, my bed was made, and I was moved in.For the past six weeks, Id lived with Sarah.My best friend, my trusty confidant, and, probably, the only person on earth whod have put up with my shit for as long as she has.Besides the other third of our trio, Mel.My nightly crying fits, my refusal to leave the house for anything other than work, and my newly minted status as Ice Cream Dreamss most valuable customer wore on my friends.Every day on the way home from work, before I planted my growing ass on the once beautiful sofa and cried, I stopped at a tiny little ice cream shop called Ice Cream Dreams.They pride themselves on making any ice cream concoction to fit any mood.The first day I walked in, the girl behind the counter took one look at me and Pint of Tears was born.Chocolate on chocolate mixed with chocolate, gummy bears, marshmallow, and peanut butter.It became their best selling ice cream flavor of the fall.Probably because of me.Me and my ever growing, ice cream eating, tear shedding, sofa arm smearing ass.I would silently curse Sarah as she invited me out every Friday.Every Saturday.I would inwardly cringe at the ten pounds Id gainedwhile simultaneously thanking my speedy metabolism that it wasnt moreas I watched from my perch on her butter yellow sofa while she left for the gym with yoga mat in hand.All I needed was a spoon, a pint, and a remote control.My new life.Sucked.Id taken to sitting on the couch and watching every single depressing break up movie ever filmed.Multiple times.From black and whites, animated, Ryan Gosling, Jack and Rose to addictions, affairs, Ryan Gosling, Jack and Rose.Oh, and by the way, Rose, I call bullshit.Jack would have pulled your ass from the frozen waters of the Atlantic and shared some space on that door or whatever the hell you were floating on.Then again, maybe you knew something we didnt.Maybe he deserved an icy, watery grave.Maybe you were on to something.Men.Fuck em.Sideways.One particular Friday night, I was in the middle of another round of Which Movie Is More Depressing?(When a Man Loves a Woman was winning, by the way) when I heard Sarahs key in the lock.At the time, I wasnt fazed.Wed gotten into a routine.Shed come home from her date or the gym or dinner out with friends, ask me how I was, ask me if I needed anything, and, when I said no, shed say good night and go to bed.Once in a while shed sit on the couch with me, eat out of her own pint of Support System (yeah, another flavor), and watch me as I worked on my ugly crying face.I was pretty sure it was the ugliest crying face ever.I was giving that actress from Homeland a run for her ugly crying face money.Which is weird, because without the ugly crying face, shes beautiful.She never would have let Jack sink to the icy depths.Then again, better to sink than live with the daily heartbreak of a roaming dick.Instead, Sarah walked in with backup.Melody stormed into the room, ripped off my blanket, and threw Mr.Bibbles across the room.Sarah calmly walked over, grabbed my ice cream and spoon, and placed them on the kitchen counter.What the hell?I shrank into the sofa.This is an intervention.Mel, you threw my bear!Screw your bear, Caroline.Enough is enough.So Steven cheated on you.That doesnt mean you have to become an ice cream swilling hermit!What the hell happened to you?You are a hot mess, doll face, Sarah quipped as she pulled a new pack of baby wipes from her purse and began wiping the chocolate off my face.Maybe I was.Ill see your hot mess and raise you a walking disaster.At least thats what shell be if this shit keeps up.Leave me alone.And dont talk about me like Im not here.I tried to retreat as far into the corner of the sofa as I could.Unfortunately, the more I squished in, the more tissues squished out.Sarah hung up her coat before sitting on the coffee table across from me.Sweetie, we know youre hurting.But its time to move on.Youre still working with him, youre reminded every day of what happened.No wonder youre stuck.You need to get up, get out, and find a new job.Move past this.How am I supposed to move past anything?I see Steven every single day.Its not like I can magically unsee him.I fingered the engagement ring I wore around my neck as fresh tears spilled over.I couldnt bring myself to get rid of it.Unfortunately, Steven still worked at the law firm, so I couldnt escape him.Who was I kidding?His daddy was the law firm.I know its hard.I cant imagine having to see the two of them day after day, Sarah said, reminding me that Betsy and her welcoming vagina worked there, too.Every day I walk in and try to keep my head high but I keep running into her stink eye.She wont stop fucking staring at me.Sarah dodged my wild hand gestures.Like Im the one who ruined her life by walking in on them.Melody held the box of tissues and I yanked a bunch out and wiped my face.Not to mention that everyone knows Steven and I broke up.Like anyone in the office needed anything else to gossip about.Fuck them.Theyre a bunch of middle aged leeches who arent happy unless someone else in unhappy.And fuck her.Punch her in the face, Melody suggested.Shes just mad she cant fuck the bosss son anymore.Right.I know theyre still boning like theyre the last two people on earth.I blew my nose.Probably still doing it in the bed Steven and I bought when we moved in together.I could no longer breathe through my nose.I bet they have sex in the office, too.Fuck them both.I am sure they are not having sex in the office.Sarah laughed as Melody pursed her lips and checked out her fingernails.You think theyre having sex in the office?I asked her.Of course she doesnt.Right Mel?Mel didnt answer, so Sarah threw a pillow at her.Right?I dont think it matters if they are still boning.Of course it matters!He begs for my forgiveness every single day.Oh, Caroline, forgive me.I love you so much.She means nothing.It made my skin crawl.Bahhh.I want him to shut up.Just shut up!Well, thats something, Melody piped up.What?I asked.Mad.Mad is better than what youve been doing.And what have I been doing, Melody?I mean besides mourning the loss of a five year relationship with my fianc who cheated on me?Besides walking into a work every day and having people actually stop talking the second I come within earshot?Turning it over and over in my head, trying to figure out what I did wrong when I know Steven made the decision to cheat, not me?I stood and threw my tissues.How should I be dealing with it, Mel?Tell me.Id love to take advice from a bed hopper who wouldnt know a relationship if it kicked her in the twat.Immediately my hands flew to my mouth.Nice.Melody smirked and Sarah gasped.Im sorry.So sorry.I dont know whatStop.Its fine.I kind of like the sass.Mel winked.Glad to see you fired up over something other than ice cream and Leonardo DiCaprios icy death.Rose should have made room, I mumbled.Holy shit.Enough.I will cancel cable if you dont stop.Sarah rolled her eyes.Sorry.Look, dont be sorry.Be brave.Be strong.Be happy.Be amazing.Dont be sorry.Melody handed me another tissue.Exactly.You need to get up, get out, and meet some people.People.Melody waved Sarah off.Pssh.She means men.You need to meet some men.You need to get your lady parts readyMel grabbed her crotchand give them some love.My lady parts are fine the way they are.Shriveled up?They are not shriveled up.Whens the last time you had sex?What does that matter?The fact that you answered my question with that question tells me too long.You need to get out and meet someone.I dropped my head between my knees.What if I cant?What if no one else wants me?Sarah dropped onto the couch next to me and rubbed my back while Melody headed toward the back of the apartment.In that moment I knew I had hit rock bottom and there was nowhere for me to go but up.But up to where?What or who would be waiting for me at the top of whatever?The answers were sitting next to me rubbing my back and walking back into the living room, bathroom garbage can in hand.Look, Melody began as she placed the garbage can on the coffee table and sat next to it, youre beautiful, talented, and smart.Who wouldnt want you?I mean, shit, youre only twenty eight years old and the world is your oyster!Youve had, what?Two, maybe three, boyfriends in your life?How many one night stands?How many nights of just fun?How many nights that were all about you and what you want?Now isnt the time to wonder who will want you, now is the time to take what you want.Ive never had a one night stand.I crinkled my nose in mock disgust to mask the embarrassing lack of experience in that department.In truth, it had always been something I was too nervous to do, something other people did.I was a relationship girl.Always with a boyfriend.Now is the time for you to live your life.Start over.With a one night stand?Sure.Why not?Sarah asked.Thats just not what I do.I shook my head.You need to do something.Tell Steven to fuck off.Put the damn ring away.I clutched it and Sarah rolled her eyes.I dont mean get rid of itI say sell it, Melody added.What I mean is take it off, put it away.Kick up your heels.Step out of the shadow Steven kept you in.Christ, Care.Sarah threw her arms up in frustration.I need wine.Anyone else need wine?You need to ask?Mel laughed.Look, I appreciate what youre trying to do, but I cant just go out and date someone.I cant just go and talk to strange men.Thats not me.Ive slept with exactly two people and both were boyfriends.We are not saying you have to go bang every guy you meet but whats wrong with a one night stand?Steven saidWhat the fuck?Melody grabbed her hair.Who the fuck cares what Steven said, Care?Really?I dont mean to be a bitch here but, seriously, I am pretty sure you need to stop with the Steven references.Hes lucky I didnt castrate his cheating ass.ButBut what?I dont want people to think Im a slut.Melody laughed.I had a one night stand last weekend.Does that make me a slut?Melody stared at me.Thats not really a good example, Mel.Sarah handed her a glass of red before handing me mine.You had a one night stand the weekend before that, too.And the weekend before that, I added.Melody opened her mouth and closed it quickly before shaking her head and taking a large swallow of wine.Look, my point is that you can.She stood and plucked the wadded up snot rags from the sofa and tossed them in the trash.There comes a time when you need a reality check.Realize this truth: youll never be good enough for some people.Say it over and over again until it sinks into your sad little skull.I ducked away when she rapped her knuckles on my head.And when you realize that, ask yourself whether its your problem or theirs.The harsh bitch of reality coldcocked me across the heart.I wasnt ready to realize anything.Fresh tears spilled down my face.Mel, I just want to move on.I want all this past me.Of course you do.And well help you.Come on, get up.Melody put down her glass and grabbed my arm, yanking me out of my seat.I looked back longingly at my spot before turning to face her.Drink the wine.I took a sip.No.Drink the whole thing.I looked to Sarah and she nodded.I brought the overpoured glass to my mouth and drank.I drank and drank until the glass was empty and Sarah took the glass from my hand.Wiping the tears from my cheeks and brushing the hair out of my eyes, Melody continued, We have a plan.Yes.Weve got it all figured out.Sarah smirked as they walked me down the hall.That plan began with a very invasive cold shower and a loofah, quite a bit of complaining on my part, and fresh pajamas.When I was finally cleansed of tears, snot, and sticky trails of ice cream, the girls sat me on the couchMr.Bibbles was nowhere to be foundhanded me another glass of wine, and laid out their plan.I sat and listened.And drank.And tried to understand.All I ended up doing was drinking more.You want me to what?I reached forward and tried to pour the empty bottle into my glass.Melody hopped up and ran to the kitchen.I held my finger to my lips until my glass was filled.I needed the silence to process this plan.Well go to a bar Sarah began.Someplace new, Melody interrupted.Yes.And well scan the crowd.Look for someone take home worthy.When you find him, nominate him as the target.And do what again?Flirt.Pick him up.Do what you need to do.Sarah was way too into this.So what youre saying is, I walk into a bar, point at a hot guy, and declare that I am bringing him home.Yes.Why cant I just get his number?Because this is Operation One Night Stand, not Operation Get His Number.What if I cant find anyone take home worthy?Then you dont.Thats the point.There is no timeline.Right.We just go out and watch you troll for the one.Im supposed to marry the one.Not this one.Melody high fived Sarah.I rolled my eyes, stood, and paced the room.Lets leave that alone for a bit.Tell me about the plan.There has to be more to this plan than me getting it on with a hottie stranger guy.I needed the subject to change, even if only for a minute.I wasnt that girl.I didnt sleep around.But, holy hell, I really wanted to be.Right.More about the plan.Sarah refilled her glass before handing Mel the bottle.We need to rip this Band Aid off.We need to get free and clear of all thisshe waved her arms around, sloshing the red liquid onto the hardwoodshit.Shit.I nodded my head and continued to pace.Remove the shit.I was pretty sure I needed more wine.Pour me.I held out my glass and Melody poured.Are you ready to hear this part?Rip off the Band Aid.It was my turn to slosh.You need toSarah pausedwhy dont you sit down for this?Sit down?I pointed to the couch.Yeah.That would be good.Melody agreed.Drink.The three of us drank deeply before Sarah continued.Youneedtoquityourjob.Im sorrywhat?It sounded like you said I need to quit my job.I laughed and took a sip.When neither one of them corrected me and, instead, averted their eyes and busied themselves with refilling their wineglasses, I nearly choked.You cant be serious?I cant quit my job!How would I pay for anything?How the hell would I make rent, Sarah?You gonna foot the bill on your teachers salary?Wait, wait.Settle your tits, doll, Melody reasoned.Are you really going to subject yourself to working alongside Steven and his fuck toy?Around all those miserable people?When was the last time you didnt dread going to work?All the Steven business aside, when?That isnt the point.It is the point.There is no way you are going to get past this unless you make a clean break, Sarah said.How am I going to find a new job?The same way everyone else finds a new job.You look for one.You use your network.Mel and I will help you, and I am sure your parents will help you, until you get on your feet.My mom never liked Steven, I mumbled and chewed on a fingernail.Neither did I, Melody blurted.What?I thought we were being honest.We are.Sarah pointed between herself and Melody.We need Caroline to be honest.Me?About what?What you want.Do you want to stay in Stevens shadow?Do you want to stare at Betsy the Intern all day long?Do you want to work someplace that chews away everything great about you until you become an empty shell?Or do you want to take life by the balls and live a little?Its a lot to take in so fast.So fast?Youve become part of the decor, darling.Get your sweet ass off my couch before I remove you from it myself.Sarah smiled.And you think I need to have sex with a stranger?I think youre looking too much into it.I dont know.I need time to think.And I did think.And partake in numerous talks about the ins and outs of dating and one night standsI mean, I had been out of the game for five years.We took a trip the next day to a hair salon and Fred Burkes, a high end boutique store, and even squeezed in some much needed fat burning with spin class on Sunday.In between all of it, my ice cream was thrown out, Ice Cream Dreams was asked not to sell my ice cream to me anymore, and my rsum and cover letters were revamped.All I needed to do was rip off the Band Aid.Easier said than done.TwoAfter a short train ride from New Jersey to New York, I walked into work the following Monday completely unsure about what I was going to do.I managed to avoid both Steven and Betsy for most of the morning.Mostly because I hid from them.I still wasnt sure what I was going to do.Even after a long phone conversation with my dad I didnt feel any better and my dad always made me feel better; the only advice he had for me was to make a list of all the reasons I should stay at my job and a list of the reasons I should leave.It was good advice but Id been at work for two hours and only succeeded in drawing a line down the middle of a piece of paper.I hadnt even started on the files sitting on my desk nor had I opened one e mail.I shook my head and tossed my pen on the desk.Picking up my coffee cup, I made my way to the break room, intending to caffeinate my way through the next hour, when I walked into Betsy.I dropped my mug and she dropped a stack of papers.I stood staring as she knelt down and scrambled to clean up the mess.I wondered how she was able to do so without exposing at least some part of her body.It appeared her idea of business casual differed greatly from mine.She mustve realized I was just standing there because she looked up, annoyance smeared all over her heavily made up face.You think you could help me since it was your fault?My fault?She really was not a good person.Yeah.Your heads been up your own ass for weeks.And dont think Im the only one whos noticed.Up my own ass.I counted backward from ten.Whats going on, ladies?Steven looked entirely too uncomfortable as he approached.Nothing, baby.Betsy side eyed me.Can you help me pick these up?She arched her back and looked up at him with big, blinky doe eyes.Uh, sure.Steven glanced in my direction before squatting down and quickly shuffling the papers into her hands.Up.My.Own.Ass, I repeated.What was that?Steven asked.Are you kidding me?I lowered my voice to a fierce whisper and stepped toward Betsy.She stepped back and into a desk.My head has been up my own ass for exactly how long?It couldnt be six weeks, could it?It could not be since I found you fucking my fianc in my bed, could it?Steven placed his hand on the small of my back.CareDont touch me.Do you have any idea what you did?Do you take any responsibility for what happened?I felt the gravity of the past six weeks begin to crumble.For weeks Ive been blaming Betsy the WonderslutHey!She interrupted and I snapped my head in her direction.Really?Dont talk.I held my hand up toward her before returning my attention to the real issue.You asked me to marry you.Do you know what that means?That means you only want to be with me.That means you dont go around sticking your dick in the office floozy.Betsy didnt mean anything.She was a mistake!Steven!The tears in Betsys eyes proved that she was unaware of his lack of feelings toward her.I dont believe you.I was supposed to be able to trust you.I mean, what else have you been hiding over the past five years?How many times did you do this?Steven leaned in.Can we talk about this in private?I looked around at the small group of people listening in on our conversation.No.Im done, Steven.I hope you and Betsy are very happy together.The rest of youI waved my armsfind something else to talk about.Im done.Listen to me, Care.She did not mean anything to me.Betsy sobbed into her hands, turned, and quickly made for the bathroom.How she managed to stay upright on those heels was amazing.Looks like your girl needs some consoling.You might want to go take care of that.I tilted my head, picked up my mug, and headed to the break room to get my coffee.A few hours later, I was sitting in my office, cold pad Thai sitting on my desk from lunch.Id just finished running through my backlog of e mails and putting the finishing touches on a few of the files that needed my attention.Underneath one of the folders was the legal pad that held the beginnings of my list.I shoved everything else to the side and centered the pad on the desk in front of me.Taking out my favorite pencil from my drawer, I leaned back, observed the teeth marks Id placed in the never sharpened pencil, and popped it between my teeth.It wasnt long before I had both lists filled with reasons.And the more I looked through and thought about it, the more I knew what I needed to do.At three oclock I knocked on the office door of the human resources manager, resignation letter in hand.She was kind enough to sit with me while I explained that I was leaving the firm.Band Aid ripped.I was pleasantly surprised that it didnt hurt as much as I expected it to.Especially since I was about to be out of a job with nothing else lined up.I hadnt yet locked down a job, hadnt secured an interview, hadnt even had a chance to look, but I knew for certain that I couldnt work there anymore.To my surprise, it was a wonderful conversation and by the end of an hour, she had made a few phone calls, setting me up with interviews.As I walked back to my office, I found Steven standing at my desk, legal pad full of reasons in hand.Excuse me.Thats mine.I snatched the pad from his hand.Youre leaving?Is that what you got out of that?I smirked.You dont have to leave.Sweetie, you think I want to leave?You think I want to start over?Of course I dont.But I have to.I cant keep sitting here wondering why you did what you did, wondering what I did to cause itYou didnt do anything wrong.I know, Steven.Look.I have to do this for me.You hate change.Yeah.I do.But right now, Steven, I hate the way I feel when Im around you even more.I knew I didnt owe him any explanation but the dejected look on his face was all the fuel I needed to cement the fact that moving on was by far a better choice than subjecting myself to working side by side with such an ass.I was on cloud nine, contemplating all the newness about to befall me, as I watched Steven stand in my office without speaking.I glanced over his shoulder and was surprised to see Betsy walk slowly to her desk, empty box in hand.I viewed the event with an unusual amount of glee as she packed up her belongings.It truly was a popcorn moment.I looked away for a few seconds.I felt bad for my obvious schadenfreudean thoughts.The feeling was short lived.I plopped in my chair and spun as she walked, head down, with a tiny box in her hands, to the elevator.I knew I should be more mature about the situation, but from what I could figure, she left on her own accord.For the same reason I decided to leave.And of course I thought she deserved a bout of unhappiness.Not as much as Steven, but she knew he was my fianc and, as much as we should all direct our anger toward the person in our lives committing the indiscretion, she absolutely, one hundred percent, knew Steven and I were engaged.I could not have cared less if she was good at her job, if she was a nice person, or if she was dying a slow death from a severe case of genital warts.It didnt even matter that I had only two weeks left.Two weeks was a slow torturous lifetime in hell if she was within a hundred yards of me.And I wished her nothing but herpes and a bad case of diarrhea.And I sincerely hoped Steven suffered the same.However, I had to keep myself from squealing with glee as I watched Steven freeze and stare as his piece of ass made her way out the door.He turned to look at me and I painted on the best who me?face I could muster.Inside I was doing back flips.None of it mattered.As soon as I gave notice, the great weight of sadness lifted off my shoulders and my attitude changed.In that moment, I decided that poor me was no longer my battle cry.Melody and Sarah were right.I was twenty eight, with my whole life ahead of me.Who was I to ignore that?Did you have to get her fired?Steven interrupted my silent hear me roar mantra.I didnt do anything.I just quit my job.Looks like she had the same idea.End of story.CareSteven.I glared at him, wishing actual daggers would shoot from my eyes and hit him in the face.Hey!Bobby popped his head in my door and frowned when he saw Steven.Did you hear?Betsy quit!There you go.I waved my hand toward Bobby to show Steven that I didnt, in fact, have Betsy fired.Not that banging my fianc is any sort of grounds for termination.Thanks, Bobby.You can leave my door open.Dropping his shoulders, Steven looked at me one last time.It didnt have to be this way.There is no other way for it to be.You made sure of that when you fucked the intern in our bed while I walked around oblivious with a two carat engagement ring on my finger.Who does that?A douche bag, thats who.Now, please, close the door on your way out.I have work to do.Who are you?My Caroline doesnt talk like that.Your Caroline doesnt exist anymore.Read the obituary.It reads: Here lies Stevens Caroline.Fucked over by a pretentious douche bag and his plastic intern.I was a bit alarmed at how good it felt to tell Steven what was on my mind.His gaze fell to the floor and his shoulders sagged.He opened his mouth to speak again but must have thought better of it.It felt even better when I watched him close the door.As soon as he left, I picked up the phone and dialed Sarah, knowing she was on her way home.Did you do it?Sarah asked in reference to part one of the plan.I did.And Betsy the Wonder Slut quit, too.A nice extension of the plan.I wasnt expecting that.I heard her chewing.Neither was I.  And I told off Steven.I am so amped.Excellent.Adrenaline is a beautiful thing.What are you eating?Its awfully loud.Carrots.Not everyone can eat six million gallons of ice cream in a six week period and still have a great ass.True.So listen, Ive been giving it a lot of thought and I think part two of the plan would be good for me.So youre in?Im in.Excellent.All weekend, I had been inundated with a three part plan.Melody and Sarah had done quite a bit of thinking and come up with what they deemed to be a fool proof method for helping me move on.Part one was complete.I quit my job.Ill find a new one.Especially with help from the very kind human resources manager.Just so you know, Sarah continued, there is an addendum to the plan.one point five, if you will.You gave two weeks notice?You dont have to stay longer than that, right?No.Im done the Friday before Thanksgiving.Good, because the three of us are spending Thanksgiving in Jamaica.What?We all need to decompress, Care.I need to get away from school, Mel needs to back away from her job for a bit, and you need, well, you need this, too.Im not taking no for an answer.Im booking the second I get off the phone with you.I guess spontaneity was the lesson for  one point five of the plan.Book it.Part two was a little dicier, a little less old me and a lot more new me.But then again, Operation One Night Stand was a go and I had two weeks to get up the nerve to go through with it.At least Id be on a plane out of town soon after, so Id be able to obsess about it in a different country.I was going to step out into the sun and live my life.And Id spend a week in Jamaica with my two best friends doing just that.ThreeNothing like bar hopping in late November snow.My cute beige heels already had salt scuffing the toes and my brand new Sevens were wet at the cuff and wed hit only two bars.Thankfully I knew the second we walked into Murphys Id make good on my bet.Operation One Night Stand was on.Melody and Sarah thought it would be fun to turn the whole thing into an actual bet.Since I had control over the who and the when, the bet was against the fact that Id find someone on the first night.Sarah and Mel, knowing that I wasnt the most adventurous of our group, bet me fifty bucks that Id back out and try again another night.Unfortunately for them, I hadnt had sex in two months and I was hurting for a good romp.Of course, I let them think they had me.Two bars down and not a single prospect?Not likely for most.Especially in a college town.Then again, I wasnt a college girl.Four years after I finished grad school and I was still trolling the local scene for the one nighter Id never experienced.My life apparently sucked.That, or I was still reeling over my breakup with Steven.Or the fact that Id just completed my last day at the firm.Whatever.Not the thing to focus on.I was on the prowl, much to the chagrin of my small, tight group of friends.Maybe Melody, who I met the first day of freshman bio, was right: maybe I was going off the deep end.It was nearing ten oclock and I had yet to find a suitable bedmate for the night.When it came to guys, I was picky.Not that a one night stand was a necessary thing to cross off my list.The girls found it hard to believe when I said Id never had one and I guess, at twenty eight, it was time.But, like I said, the second we hit Murphys, I spotted my target.He was tall, with closely cropped blond hair and dark eyes and was surrounded by a group of guys.He looked older than the rest of the guys in his whole group did.Something about the way he stood.Self confidence radiated across the bar.I had a feeling he was used to getting what he wanted and I figured that worked in my favor.It was more likely hed see us as kindred spirits, even if it was just sex.And sex was like riding a bicycle right?No way was he going to back down from what I had planned.We made our way to the opposite side of the bar so I could get a better look at the man Id be sharing a bedor a floor, a wall, a stairwellwith later.Elbowing Sarah, I declared, Him, and nodded across the bar.Blondie?Yep.Bets on.Get em, girl.And remember, if at first you dont succeed, destroy all the evidence you tried in the first place.She nudged my ribs and ordered me a drink.Since it was a special night, I avoided my usual beer and sipped on two fingers of cinnamon liqueur on ice.The bartender was cute and seemed to be in a good mood, so I decided to bring him in on my little plan.If it was going to go my way, I was going to need him.Id been planning the night for two weeks.So much for one night stand spontaneity.Then again, I was a planner.I waited until he came closer before I called him over.Up close, he was more than cute.I could picture him with an open belt and his jeans sitting low on his ass.Holy shit.I could get lost in those eyes.Damn.But he wasnt the target.Im Caroline.Hi, Caroline.Im Brian.Nice to meet you.Nice to meet you, too.I was wondering if you could help me out.Eyeing my tumbler, he lifted an eyebrow, pushed his wavy brown hair out of his eyes, and responded, Sure.What do you need?Looking around to make sure Sarah and Mel werent listening in, I whispered to my new bartender friend, I have a bet with my girls and I cant lose.It would kill my buzz and I need your help.So, I need to send that guy over thereI pointed slightlya drink.Something fun.Sexy.Sexy, huh?The way his mouth moved when he said the word sexy had me wondering what it would be like to be sprawled across the bar with Brian on top of me, those teeth scraping my skin, that tongue sliding up and down my body.Unfortunately, I had to pull myself out of my own head because I needed to focus.It was just so hard to do so when his baby blues looked at me like that.Like I was the only person in the crowded bar.Suggestive.The word came out throatier than I anticipated and Brians eyes gleamed mischievously.Suggestive.Sexy.Kind of like you.He winked and a warm tingle spread between my thighs.Was that all it took to moisten the panties these days?Jesus, I needed to get laid.I was DEFCON 1 horny.Down, girl.Which one again?Blond.Tall.With a bunch of his friends.Bartender Brian was good.He looked at my target without actually looking at him.Id have to ask him later how he did that.Yeah.Something fun.A shot.Definitely a shot.Got it.Be right back.I watched Brian mix a bunch of stuff into a shaker and pour a shot.When he brought it to the guy, he leaned in and whispered, barely tilting his head in my direction.The target lifted big brown eyes in my direction, nodded thanks as he lifted the shot, and threw it back before turning back to his friends.Shit.That didnt work.It seemed like a good idea.Id have to rethink.Brian poured another drink for some random college girl before returning to me.What did you give him?My hand reached for his and he slid his fingers along the back of my hand.Sex Up Against the Wall.What?I could feel my ears redden.Like a Sex on the Beach but with a little Harvey Wallbanger.Again with the wink.Bartender Brian was hot.I needed some air.Ill be right back.Giving up already?He stood up and crossed his arms over his chest.Hardly.I winked back at him and watched a slow, sexy smile spread across his face.I made my way across the room.I was going to have to pass tall, blond, and handsome to get to the bathroom.With a newly formed set of balls, I decided to brush past him, walking right through his little group of friends.Feeling slightly badass with my four inch heels, I knew my ass looked great.It was my best feature.Score one for an hour a day at the gym.I quickly tugged my shirt, making sure to expose a little more cleavage while keeping my newly purchased bra under wraps.At least for the moment.Carefully, I kept my eyes on him.It wasnt until I brushed against him that he looked.My hand barely swiped across his crotch.It was a fuller package than Id imagined.Eyes locked, I mustered whatever brash sex appeal I could and hoped I was able to convey my desire silently.I was pretty sure it worked since he put his hand on my arm and whispered, Hi.I leaned in, prompting him to bend down slightlyhe had at least a foot on meand whispered the greeting back, making sure to keep my whisper breathy while grazing his earlobe with my lips.I moved on quickly, feeling his eyes watch me walk away.I heard his red headed friend say something about hitting that and I flipped my hair over my shoulder.Once I finished in the bathroom, I avoided the target.A quick peek over at him, however, stirred the butterflies in my stomach.He was watching me.There is no better feeling than realizing someone youre into is checking you out.I ran into a few people I knew and quickly exchanged pleasantries before heading back to Bartender Brian.Caroline!Nice to see you came back.I saved your seat.You did?I saw those shoes.Didnt think it would be right for you to stand on them all night.You noticed my shoes?Was he gay?Well, yeah.Something was making that ass swing when you walked away.Not gay.Why did I care?He was not the target.Give a girl the right pair of shoes and she can take over the world.Touch.Bartender Brian slid a drink in front of me.Whats this?From him.He nodded across the bar.Target lifted his drink and nodded.What is it?He motioned for me to lean in, meeting me halfway across the bar.Tucking my hair behind my ear he whispered, Screaming Orgasm.He lingered a beat longer, long enough for me to feel his breath on my skin.When he pulled away, he smelled like cinnamon.I looked down; my original drink was empty.I ran my finger around the rim of the glass and looked at him.Shrugging, he said, I was thirsty.Drink up.Smiling, I lifted my shot glass and drank.My lips were moist and a drop of the alcohol slid down my chin.Bartender Brian reached over and wiped it away with his finger before putting it in his mouth.A change of panties would be required if this shit kept up.Your turn.For the life of me I couldnt figure out what he was talking about.I touched my face where his finger was a moment ago.I felt that touch down to my toes.Earth to Caroline.He snapped in front of me.Huh?Your turn.My turn for what?Drinks.Sexy.Suggestive.Mr.Tall Blond and Dumb over there.He isnt dumb!Brian laughed easily.If you say so.Whatll it be?I dont know.I didnt think that far ahead.Um, Slippery Nipple?Bartender Brian pursed his nibblicious full lips before saying, You got it.He tucked his towel in the back of his pants before retrieving a cell phone from his front pocket.He turned away from me and began making the drink.He stopped a few times along the way to pull a few beers for some other customers.I watched as some slutty girl lifted herself on the bar, leaned in, and kissed him on the cheek.He dipped his head and smiled, touching her nose with the tip of his finger.The same finger he used to wipe the small bit of my drink that slipped down my chin.Who is that bitch?I shook the thought from my head.Bartender Brian wasnt my target but he did deliver the drink as promised.Once again Tall Blond and Dumber, Handsomelocked eyes with me and mouthed the words, Thank you.He quickly threw it back before leaning into Brian.Brian laughed and high fived him.I wonder what theyre talking about.Hey!Melody yelled in my ear.Get fucked yet?She was always a bit of a close talker but when she was drinking, the closeness was magnified.Honestly, all I had to do was lick my lips at that moment and wed be making out French style.Not that thered be anything wrong with that.But at the moment, Melodys tongue wasnt on my list of things to do so I took a step back.Unfortunately, there wasnt anywhere to go and I was practically bent backward over the bar.Hey, Mel.No, I didnt.What are you up to?I ran into that Jeff guy.Stevens friend.Jeff is here?My stomach lurched.Wherever there was Jeff, Steven wasnt too far behind.A new start.I needed that without him.
