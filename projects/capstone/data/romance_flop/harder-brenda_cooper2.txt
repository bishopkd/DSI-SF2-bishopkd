I sit beside him and ask, How was your day?Got a lot of texts.Anything interesting?He stares at the TV with his plate balanced on his lap and bites into a pull apart roll slathered in butter.Nope.But he slants me a look, and the smart ass tilt to his mouth makes me flush with heat.Ive seen that smile in bed, over dinner, in his car, in the bakery, in every corner of our lives together.I miss that smile.You cant ignore me into disappearing, I say.He just chews and swallows, staring, straight ahead.I lean close and whisper so only he can hear me.Im not leaving until I know youre okay.Everything about him gets still.He doesnt even breathe, and Im holding my own breath in sympathy, so caught up in him that I dont even realize it until he draws air deep into his lungs and turns toward me.His face bare inches away.His thigh hot alongside mine.His eyes, his nose, his mouth, his face.God.There cant be another woman.Not between me and Westthere cant be, because if there were, I wouldnt feel like this.I couldnt feel like this.This alive.This real.Not if he didnt feel it, too.So if I tell you Im okay, youll go?he asks.I have to believe it.My white shirt is reflected in his eyes, a glare against the darkness of his pupils.His nostrils flare.I know he feels something.I know hes got things he wants to say to me.So why wont he open his mouth and say them?After he left Putnam, West shut down any conversation that included the words move or transfer, any talk of seeing each other again.Everything is black or white for West.His mom went back to his dad, so he had to go back to Frankie.All he got of her was one afternoon a week at the McDonalds near her school.An hour for West to look his sister and his mom over for bruises, interpret their answers to his questions, wait for the day he found out something was wrong.The rest of the time, he worked.He slept.He went to the bars with Bo, and every now and then got drunk enough to call and tell me the truth as he saw it.We were over.I shouldnt keep trying to be his friend.I shouldnt text him.We were over, so we shouldnt be talking on the phone at two in the morning, except we were.Because hed called me.And once we were talking, we found ourselves joking, meandering around until he said something or I did and we slid down into the dark together, hands where they shouldnt be, saying everything wed been holding back.Miss you.Want you.Need you.Still love you.Baby, I cant.I cant.Hed tell me I deserved better, but I could never make myself believe there was anyone for me but West.I watch the color rise in his cheeks.I look at his throat, where his pulse beats.I feel the heat coming off him, the want.He can lie to me in a text.He can lie over the phone.But he cant sit here and lie to me with his body.Make me believe youre fine, I say.Tell me you dont miss me.You dont want me.Youre not thinking about me all the time, as much as Im thinking about you.I reach out for his thigh and find a grip above the knee.Tell me.The muscles in his leg twitch beneath my fingers.West wraps a hand around the back of my neck.He leans in close.I think he means to say something harsh, to convey the hard truth of our hopeless situation.I should brace myself for it, except I cant.That hand on the back of my neck makes me soften instantly, everywhere.This is how he used to kiss me.Just like this.And when he lets me this close, looks at me this way, I can see right into him and catalog every feeling chasing its way across his face.His longing.His lust.His need for me, his craving for my softness, his desire to claim something tender in this blighted life of his.I can see anguish, too.Agony.I watch agony overpower his tenderness, wrestle its way to the forefront, and shut down his expression until all the feeling left is in his lawless, angry eyes.Stay with Frankie, he says.Thats all I want from you.He stands and walks out of the room, like thats a normal thing to do.Get up in the middle of everything, step over the crawling baby, stuff his plate in the garbage can and go.Go wherever.Go somewhere I cant follow him.I think about borrowing a car, asking for directions out to Bos place.I could park and knock on the door, find West, corner him.I could flatten my hands on his chest and shove him.Say what youre thinking.Admit what I mean to you.Talk to me about what youre going to do now that hes dead.Promise youre coming back to me, convince me you love me, tell me youre sorry.What stops me is how badly I want him.I want to follow him around the way Frankie follows me.Push myself up against him, seeking comfort.What stops me, too, is what I saw.What West let me see: that hes hurting badly, and his hardness is the only defense hes got.Im here for him.Not for myself.Stay with Frankie, he said.Thats what I do.My third day in Silt is like the first two.West makes himself scarce and refuses to answer my texts.My dad calls and I ignore him.Four times.I cant be here and still be thinking about whats going on back home, not if I want to stay sane.Its too much.And Im weary of talking to my dad.Hes obsessed with the trial.Talking to my dad about trial stuff ate my entire summerthe trial and West, West and the trial.Lying awake nights in my bedroom at the house where I grew up, I felt sometimes like I was disappearing.Like I was nothing but the aftermath of last year: what happened with Nate, what happened with West.Instead of taking Dads calls, I do my detective thing in the morning, insinuating myself into conversations, learning the names of all Wests cousins, the personalities of his aunts and uncles, the simmering feuds and complicated webs of animosity that fuel this familys daily dramas.There are a lot of dramas.I can see why West opted out for six years.Michelle has to go in to the police station for an interview.Joan teaches Frankie and me to play backgammon, and we have a tournament at the kitchen table while she makes chili, knits, and talks on the phone with her daughters, one after the other, each of them pissed about something.Michelle comes home with a headache, cries when Joan asks her what the police wanted to know, and falls asleep on the couch.Frankie gets bored and wants to play Skip Bo.When Joan tells her she doesnt have it, Frankie says shes got it at the trailer.Also at the trailer are her clothes, her toiletries, her cell phone, the blanket off her bed, and everything else in the world a ten year old girl could possibly want.Can we go get it?she asks.Please, Caroline?I dont have a car, remember?I can ask West.Hell say no.They all say no.She folds her arms and collapses on top of her cards in despair.Its a crime scene, hon.But late in the afternoon, Joan takes a phone call out to the porch.When she comes back inside, she tells us the police have classified Wyatt Leavitts death accidental.Theyre releasing the body.The funeral will be tomorrow.That night, after Frankie falls asleep, Joan walks up the attic steps.You decent?Yeah.Im wearing a long sleeved T shirt and yoga pants.Decent enough.Come with me.A short drive later, were parked in front of a dark trailer with crime scene tape across the door.The knob turns easily under her hand.She shows me how to duck under the tape.Breaking and entering, I think.Contaminating a crime scene.Technically, its not a crime scene anymore.But even if it were, I think Id be here.I need to see this place.I need to know it, because this is where West came from.This is his past.I take it inthe musty smell, the cheap paneling over thin walls.The scratched tabletop, its wood grain a sticker half peeled away, revealing the white of the backing.Joan comes out of the bedroom with her arms full of clothes and says, Get me a trash bag from under the kitchen sink.I do as Im told, thinking about where West would have kept his things.What he might have called his own and how he would have protected it.He never wanted me to see this.My cell rings.I fumble getting it out of my pocket, inadvertently accepting the call.My fathers voice says, Caroline?Hey, Dad.Ive been calling you all day.Joan comes out with another load of clothes.I squeeze the phone to my shoulder and hold open the trash bag.She stuffs the clothes inside.Sorry, Im keeping busy.Doing what?Trespassing.Invading the privacy of the man I love.Banging my head against a brick wall.Only I dont think West is a brick wall, as much as he looks like one.The bricks he surrounds himself with are no more real than the wood grain surface of the tabletop.I cant talk right now, I tell my dad.When can you talk?I dont know, I say.Ill call you.Youll have to do better than that.I set up a meeting for Tuesday, because I have some questions about the complaint.I need you to weigh in on a few things before then.Will you be back?Or I cant listen.Outside, the heavy thump of bass draws closer.Lights cut across the window and pan over the wall, illuminating a dark decoration against the wallpaper.A spatter pattern.Blood.I disconnect the phone.Joan comes out with a handful of jewelry and Frankies Skip Bo cards.Lets get out of here, she says.I want to move.Escape.But I stand another minute in the beating heart of Wests nightmares, because for so many years, escape was impossible for him.We ride back to Joans house with the windows down.I turn my phone over and over in my hand, thinking about my dad.Wests dad is dead.I saw his blood.Joan must have seen it, too.Her sons life, spilled across the walls.Wasted.I came here to help, but theres so little thats in my power to do.All I can do is stay.Love him.Hope.I carry the bags up the stairs so Frankie will see them when she wakes up.My fourth day in Silt is the funeral.West stands by the coffin with his mother.I try not to stare, but I cant stop.His thighs strain the trousers of his suit.The jacket is so tight across the shoulders, he looks like a thug in a gangster movie.When he bends down to hug one of his little cousins, I notice how shiny the pants are across the backside, and I worry hes going to split them.Maybe he borrowed it, but the ache in my body says no.This is his best suit.This is his suit from before, maybe the suit he graduated high school in, wore to prom, I dont know.It doesnt fit him, and I want to cry.He looks so angry.He didnt want to come.His mom couldnt talk him into it.His grandma knew better than to try.Frankie wanted him here.Shes all the way on the other side of the room with her aunt Heather, who has three kids with different fathers and lives on disability in western Idaho.Heather is rubbing her lower back like it hurts.All this standing around talking to people makes my back hurt, and I didnt get hit by a falling pallet at a warehouse ten years ago.Weve been here for six hours.Its hot and too dry, were tired, and theres nothing to drink or eat.Every few minutes, Frankie looks around until she finds West.Her shoulders ease.Hes trying so hard to make this work out for her.As though, if he does that, he wont have to deal with it himself.I suspect he thinks that he is dealing with it, but when he drops his guard his face tells me the truth.When he looks off in the distance and lets that angry mask fall for a second, half a second, an instant, I see.I saw him watching Frankie talk to an older teenage cousin, everything raw in West exposed in his faceprotectiveness, aggression, fear, love.God, I miss his face.I miss the mornings when Id wake up before him and look and look until I could close my eyes and see him there, the tangle of his eyelashes, the shape of his mouth, the scar in his eyebrow.I miss the nights when Id sit on the couch and hed be on the floor below me, book open on his lap, one arm thrown over the cushion behind him, and his fingers heavy on my thigh.How hed read something interesting and turn to tell me, his smile cockeyed and bright, my world full of him all the way out to the edges.When he looks in my direction, I catch his gaze and hold it, and its my yearning that propels me across the floor toward him.Its the click of our connection, as powerful as ever, magnetic even from across a room.Its my hope that maybe I can say something, maybe But a couple gets there ahead of me, the woman touching Wests elbow and sharing condolences.A beautiful woman with black hair, older than me by a decade, perfectly made up.I envy her poise and her boobs and her fuchsia wrap dress, but mostly I envy that shes touching West and Im not.I look away.Right into the open coffin.I dont know whose idea that was.Id assumed it would be closed, because hello, gunshot wound?But I guess they just pack the holes full of whatever and slap a suit on the body, because theres Wests dad, laid out like He looks so much like West.Its creepy how much he looks like West.Like West, dead.Im not tricked, Im not stupid, but my heart is, apparently, and my bodys in a galloping panic, sweating and hot, tears in my eyes.Look away.The woman is hugging West.Up on her toes, pressing her breasts into his chest.Its a little too much hug, you know?With hips in it, and hips arent supposed to touch when you hug at a funeral.Look away.Separated from them by a few feet, theres a man talking to Wests mom.Older, distinguished gray hair, great suit.Michelle is crying again, although its dignified funeral crying.Hes offering her a hankie, and the hug is still going on to his right.His mouth looks like mine musttugged down at the corners, as if hes wishing the hug would die a painful death.As though hed like to tear the hug off them, throw it on the ground, step on it.Look away.Coffin again.I burp, taste vomit, wobble a little on my heels, and stagger, prompting me to reach out to steady myself.White satin lining, cool against my skin.I remember reading that funeral homes charge the grieving a fortune for stuff like satin linings and urns to put the ashes in, and you dont get any choice because its not like theyll let you turn up with a reusable Ziploc tote and say Fill er up.Everything costs money.Wests grandma is living on Social Security and her dead husbands medical benefits from a union job he had with the railroad.If she didnt own her house outright, she wouldnt be able to get by.As it is, Michelles been giving her money for groceries.Michelle borrows about five hundred bucks a month from West, sometimes more.Shes not working since Wyatt got killed.This dusty pink carpet, the tasteful hush, the rows of side tables full of flowersWest is paying for it.Paying to embalm the man whose fists crashed into his face.I look at the corpse again, because thats all he is now, a corpse.I stare at his face until I can see the makeupmascara on his lashes, creamy foundation, blush.Not West.Just some asshole who donated the sperm.Im glad hes dead.The man whos been talking to Wests mom touches his wifes elbow and leans down to say something in her ear.She lets go of West finally, smiling, nodding.They say their goodbyes and move away.West glances at me.Cuts to the coffin.Mumbles, Stay with my mom.He walks away.Damn him.Damn him for lying to me, damn him for not talking to me, and damn him for pretending there was ever someone else.There was just West, here, convincing himself he could never come back to me.That there wouldnt ever be a way for us to be together again.West deciding Id be better off if he let me go.Whats she look like?Id asked him.Does she make you laugh?Do you love her?No reply.I spent a day fuming, analyzing, talking, drinking, and came back at him with Do her knees go weak when you kiss her?Does she smile when you fuck her?Does she say your name?I was drunk and bold that night.Righteous, shouting.West hung up on me.My best friend, Bridget, had to pry the phone from my hand, because I was shaking with anger.I didnt feel the tears until she wiped them away.I study his retreating back, his stifled shoulders moving through the room.Moving away from me.I understand him better than anyone alive.I just dont know what the fuck to do about him.Wests grandma liberates me.She whispers, Go on, and takes Michelles arm.I weave between the rows of chairs set up for the service in half an hour, out of the room and down the broad main hallway of the funeral home, with its fussy old fashioned couches and its wall art no one could ever possibly object tomostly shepherdesses and cows, with a seascape thrown in for good measure.West is nowhere in sight.He must have gone outside to smoke.Near the exit doors, I see the man whod been talking to Wests mom by the coffin.I start to pass him, and he says, Youre Caroline, arent you?Yes.He extends a hand.Evan Tomlinson.May I speak with you for a moment?Tomlinson.Dr.Tomlinson.West calls him Dr.T.  This is the man who paid for West to go to Putnam.Of course.From the viewing room where Wests dad is, I hear a door slam.Someone going outside?Theyd have to use the big set of double doors by the coffin.The door scrapes open and slams shut again.I was surprised to find you here, Dr.Tomlinson says.I understood West had cut all his ties to Putnam.Hes tried.He sinks his hands into his trouser pockets.His eyes flick across my face, seeking.I guess he finds whatever hes after, because he says, Im going to cut right to the chase.West Leavitt making wood chips is a waste of a life.Its a waste of intelligence, and we dont have so much intelligence to spare in this world that I like seeing it thrown away.Ive been trying to get him back to Putnam, and Im hoping you can help.Yes.Yes, I can help.Yes, yes, yes.What did you have in mind?As an alumnus and a major donor, Ive been offered the opportunity to recommend a student to the college for a legacy scholarship.Its an attractive dealtuition and board are covered, and all West would have to demonstrate is an ability to benefit.So far, so good.I cant think of anyone with greater ability to benefit from a Putnam education than West.If you control a legacy scholarship, why didnt you recommend West for that before?I ask.Instead of paying his tuition and everything yourself?This is a new thing Ive been developing with the financial aid office since I sent West to Putnam.I think it was my sponsoring him as a student there that got their attention.I see.And have you mentioned this to West?I have.He turned me down.He wouldnt say why.When did you ask him?Just the other week.Before his father He loops his hand in the air, encompassing everything surrounding us.got shot.ended up here.Did you mention his sister when you made this offer?No.He wont leave her behind.Hes too young to be responsible for that girl.I shake my head, unwilling to agree or disagree.Sure, West is too young, but what does that mean anyway?Hes the age he is.Hes the person he is.Hes been responsible for his sister a long time, and hes going to take care of her regardless of what Dr.T or I think.Regardless of what anyone thinks.Dr.Tomlinson Just then, the funeral director comes through the front door.Hes red faced, and he reeks of panic.Wheres Mrs.Leavitt?She was in the viewing room.She isnt now.Could you do me a favor and look in the bathroom?Its important that I find her.Why?Whats going on?Theres asome unpleasantness in the parking lot, and if anyone can put a stop to it Im already on my way out.Im familiar with West and unpleasantness.He has a bad habit of swinging instead of thinking.I have a bad habit of walking into his punches.Outside, I find a crowd bunched tight between two parallel rows of cars.I duck and weave like an eel to get a view of the action, and then Im not sure what Im looking at.West has both arms out, holding his uncle Jack apart from a man I dont know.No respect!his uncle is shouting.No excuse for this fucker!The guy being yelled at has a shaved head.Hes built like a brick wall in a suit.I clue in to his identity when he flinches at the word killer.Bo.There are others shouting, too, adding to the chorus of voices.Frankies in the crowd behind him, white faced, silent.Calm down, West says to his uncle.Jack is Joans sonWests dads brother.He doesnt work.I overheard his wife, Stephanie, telling Wests aunt Laura that she put the kids to bed last night and then spent two hours driving around looking for him so she could drag him home and dry him out for the funeral.He sounds like hes plenty wet now, though.Ill fucking calm down when that fucktard is gone from my brothers fucking funeral!He came to pay his respects.He should be in jail!Thats for the police to decide.He shot Wyatt, West!Cold fucking blood!I cant believe youre taking his side.Fucking staying with him, driving his truck aroundit disgusts me.Im close enough now to smell the liquor fumes coming off Jack.I search for Wests mom, knowing she and Bo are the two poles of all this conflict.Two points in a triangle whose third point has been removed.When I find her, thats when I know this situation is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.I once went out after a storm with my dad and saw a downed telephone pole in the road, the severed end of a power line showering electricity into the dark night.Thats what Wests moms eyes are like.That much energy, loose and sparking.Lacking only a glancing touch to cause damage beyond measure.You got some nerve, coming here, Michelle says.She jerks her chin up.For one frozen instant, I see a strong resemblance to West.Its in her jaw.In the fire in her eyes.After what you did?Her voice is rising.After what you said to me, what you promised, and now youre disrupting his funeral?His fucking funeral, Bo!You take him from me and you cant leave me that much?Shes stalking toward him now, warming up.Bos protests are too quiet to affect her gathering momentum.Her curses fall on him like rain.Dark and cold.They pelt him, and he squares his shoulders.Looks into the distance, past her.Its not until she tries to slap him that he lays a hand on her, but one hand is all it takes.She tries to wrench her arm away, shouts in pain when she fails, and bloodlust ripples through the crowd, a tangible wave of ugly impulse.I want to keep it from getting any worse, but no one I see has a stake in stopping this.Laura is so nonconfrontational, its a shock her spine hasnt dissolved.Id hoped Stephanie could be counted on to prevent her husband from behaving like a jackass, but the excitement in her eyes says she loves this.Heathers not someone to be counted on.The cousins are strangers to me.The funeral home director is missing.My gaze collides with Wests.He mouths the word Frankie.The least I can do.I look for the fastest way to get to her.Its a straight line, so I cut through the empty space between Bo and West, ducking under Wests outstretched arms.Come with me, I say.We have to find your grandma.Her eyes are on Bo.He shouldnt be here.I know.Come on.I pull at her arm, and she falls against my side.We zip indoors, casing the joint for Joan.Family room, bathroom, hallway, coffin room.We find her alone in an empty visitation room.When I tell her whats going on, she just sits there, gazing at a lit cross in a niche.Please, I beg.She meets my eyes, and her gaze tells me shes no stranger to this kind of thing.The people out there are her family.She made them with her body, watched them make others, weathered years worth of this behavior.Drinking problems, health problems, abuse, alienation, violence, death.I wish shed at least had a chance to bury her no good son with some dignity, but I want her to step in and help West even more.Hes on his own out there, I say.She closes her eyes.Sighs.Gets to her feet.When she walks across the threshold, I want to go with her, but Im worried about Frankie.I cant protect her and be with West both.Its killing me not to know whats happening to him.Will you stay here?I ask.She bites her lip.Shakes her head.Im supposed to keep you out of trouble, but your brother Is out there.Is the only thing I care about anymore.You really love him, huh?she says.I feel the tears coming up, but I take a deep breath and swallow them back down.Yeah.I wont come all the way out, she says.Ill stay in the doorway, so I can see whats going on.Good enough.We hustle toward the front of the funeral parlor.Im halfway down the hall when she takes my elbow.Caroline?Yeah?Im sorry.Her apology rings in my ears as I hurry away.Sorry.As if this is her fault.I hear sirens in the distance.Did the funeral director call the police?I think he must have, and it feels like overkill until I step through the door and into a disaster.I see a man in a suit jacket throwing a punch.A woman teetering on high heels, bent double.I hear a high pitched whistle, the smack of bone against bone.I watch a stranger head butt another stranger, the spray of blood the single most repulsive sight Ive ever witnessed.This is a brawl, I think.This is what a brawl looks like.The chaos is random, not coordinated like in a movie, and I cant locate West, cant even penetrate the first layer of heaving bodies, which is hard for me to understand because there arent a hundred people in this parking lot.There aretwenty?Twenty five?I should be able to get to the middle of them.I try, but my instinct for self preservation is too healthy.Every time a hip or fist or elbow comes at me, I jerk back.Then suddenly the melee breaks open and I see Wests mom and Bo.Hes got his arms around her from behind.Shes completely wild in his grip, shouting obscenities, trying to break loose.She looks like the madwoman in the attic, her hair wild, voice rough, mascara streaking down her cheeks.I glance toward the entrance and locate Frankie where she said she would be.Seeing this.Im sorry, too, Franks.Bos trying to get Michelle out of the middle of the tumult.Wests grandma is helping, I realizeshes the one who cleared the path, the one whose shrill whistle keeps cutting through the noiseand West is holding the crowd off Bos back.He shoves someone.Throws a punch.He takes a hit to his cheek, his head snapping back, and then Im running right for him.Sprinting toward West as the air starts to flash and bleed red.The screams of the sirens split the sky.A policeman has West facedown over the back of a patrol car with his legs spread.His forehead is mashed against metal, the seam between the shoulders of his suit jacket split open, the white of his shirt showing through.Excuse me.I grab a passing officers arm.Excuse me!She shakes me off, talks into her radio.I step closer to the car and try to get the attention of the guy with West.Is he being arrested?What about his rights?He didnt do anything, it wasnt his fault, hes not a criminaldamn it, youre not listening to me West barks, Caro!How mean he looks with that bruise blooming on his cheek.How much like the man they think he is.A roughneck brawling at a funeral.Knock it off, he says.Let them do their jobs.But it wasnt your fault!Theyll fucking figure that out if you give them a few seconds peace.When a third cop takes my upper arm in a tight grip and leads me away from West, I bite my tongue.I end up against the building, beside Joan.I cant believe this, I say.He was trying to stop it.If he keeps ahold of his temper, hell be fine, she says.Nothing about this situation is fine.I press the back of my head into the buildings vinyl siding and try to breathe.Wests mom is bundled into the back of a patrol car, where she abruptly flips from blank catatonia to screaming again in her hoarse, ravaged voice.His funeral!shes yelling.His fucking funeral!Bo gets taken to the station in another car.Wests uncle Jack goes to the hospital with a broken nose, and the rest of the aunts and uncles and cousins disperse.I dont know if theyre heading to the hospital, the police station, or if theyre just done with the whole scene.West is allowed to stand, and he gives his statement in the parking lot out of my earshot.An officer comes over to talk to me.I tell him what I know.It takes longer than I thought it would, and by the time Im finished West is nowhere in sight.The lot is nearly empty.The funeral director appears at my elbow.If youll come inside, miss.I cant think of any reason not to follow him.My feet operate on their own set of instructions.My face feels stiff.I think I might be a little shocky.He shows me into the viewing room, where a small group stands in front of the coffinWest, Joan, Frankie, the Tomlinsons.All thats left of the mourners, I guess, because as soon as he deposits me next to West, he takes a place at a lectern beside the coffin.Whats going on?I ask West.Funeral.Now?He finds my hand, squeezes it once hard, and lets go.It soon becomes clear that whatever program was planned has been tossed out the window.Were treated to a short, generic speech, and then were all asked to step out into the other side of the room behind a fabric covered panel while they close the coffin.The Tomlinsons hold an angry whisper conference in the corner.If I had to guess, Id say Dr.T wants to leave and his wife is refusing.I cant imagine why she would want to stay.Frankie is folded in a chair, her arms wrapped around her knees.West sits beside her.Hes missing from his face, all the anger wiped away and replaced with the impassive blank nothingness I remember from when he was at Putnam and we were both denying how we felt about each other.I dont want anything from anyone that expression says.It makes me want to give him the world on a plate.Give him absolutely everything he could ever desire.It makes me want to apologize for his lot in life and for the differences between his world and mine, because West is amazing, and his life sucks.His life is always going to suck if he stays here, in his mothers orbit, and assigns himself the job of keeping order.There isnt anything I can do about it.After a while, the panels roll open.The coffin is wheeled outside on a sort of pallet.We watch them load it into the hearse to drive it uphill to the cemetery, which is just behind the funeral home.At the graveside, West remains impassive until were invited to throw flowers or earth on the coffin.Then he steps out of the circle of mourners to where a shovel leans against a nearby utility truck, grabs it, and digs into the pile of dirt at the head of the grave.Tossing in one shovelful after another until the earth stops sliding off the domed lid and starts to accumulate.This is not, obviously, what the funeral director had in mind, but no one seems inclined to put a stop to it.Joan leads Frankie back inside.Mrs.Tomlinson follows.Dr.Tomlinson didnt show up at the grave at all.West and I remain, along with the funeral director, whos giving me a pleading look.I shrug.West shovels.His eyes are fevered, his cheeks pink.The funeral director returns to the building.I start to wonder how long it takes to fill a grave.I cant imagine leaving him here alone.Spotting a second shovel in the back of the truck, I retrieve it and carry it to the dirt pile.Wests gaze locks with mine.We stare at each other.Theres no tenderness in it.Its a clash of wills.Its him saying, Stay the fuck out of this, and me saying, Make me.Its him snapping, I dont want you here.You dont belong in Silt.I dont need you.Its me shouting, You dont fucking know what you need.Stop being so stubborn.Take what Im trying to give you.Take it.What I want to do is drop the shovel and walk over to where he is.To slip my arms around him, press myself against him, flatten my breasts into his chest, kiss him until he has no choice but to kiss me backto kiss me the way he used to, sparks striking into a burn so fast and hot that sometimes we couldnt get our clothes off quick enough, couldnt manage to do more than unzip jeans and shove underwear out of the way just far enough to join our bodies together.Its unbelievable how badly I want that back.How urgently I wish we could get lost in each other, find joy again.I understand, though, that its not what he wants from me.I take off my heels, sink the blade into the soil, move it through the air until it hovers over the gleaming black surface of the box Wests father will rot in.The thump of earth landing on steel gives me a cheap satisfaction.Im awkward with the shovel, losing more dirt than I get in, dropping some of it on my feet, where it gets between my toes, moist and muddy.Within a few minutes, my back starts to hurt.Then my hands.West moves fluidly, his body graceful in action.The blade of his shovel sings.Still, it takes a long time.I get blisters.I dont stop.The sun drops toward the horizon.When we finish, he takes my shovel and returns them both to the truck.He stands beside the grave, hands loose and empty.He looks like a boyso much like a boy that I understand viscerally that he was as young as Frankie once.He was a kid who wanted a father and got nothing but disappointment.A boy who got punched, kicked, abandoned, and then told to stop holding on to the past.To let it go.His mother, his grandmother, this whole familythey all asked him, again and again, to give his father one more chance.Maybe this time Wyatt would be different.Maybe this time life would be fair and kind, and happiness would be possible.It never was, though.Not for West.I dont know how he can survive here.I dont know how hes not crushed, because it crushes me just to watch him.This whole placeits beautiful, that winding road from the airport, the trees in the mountains, the buttes and the ocean.Its not fair that its beautiful, because its so outrageously cruel to the man I love.If West stays here, this place will kill him.I step closer, skirt around the grave until I can feel the heat coming off his arm.I touch him, my hand on the curve of his shoulder.West.Its not fair to ask him for anything right now, but I dont want to take from him.I only want him to lean on me.I want to give him rest, oblivion, escape.Something.Ive been trying to give him space, trying not to dig up feelings he cant handle when hes already got so much to deal with, but I cant take it anymore.I cant believe that this is betterthat somehow its better for West not to have whatever comfort I can give him, its better for me to be three feet away from him and telling myself I cant get closer, not now, not tomorrow, maybe not ever.How the fuck is this better?For who?Not for me.Not for West.Surely not for West.I move around to his front and insinuate my hands into the space between his arms and his sides.I rest my cheek against his heaving chest.If you want me, I say.No strings.No anythingjust, if you want to forget for an hour.Whatever you want.I tighten my arms around him.Hes so much harder than he used to be.All this armor between him and the world.I want him to know that I see it there.I know what it is, and if he wants to take it off with me, he can.I love him.I love him so fucking much, and this is all Ive got to offer that he can possibly take.So I squeeze him as tight as I can until he yields.His weight bows into me.Not all, but a fraction of it.A crack in the blank concrete wall of his self denial.His hand comes to the back of my head, the nape of my neck, pressing my face into the ragged sound of his breathing.Caro, he says into my hair.Its the first time hes said my name like he used to.Like its precious.Like Im precious.I can come out to Bos, I whisper.Or we could find a motel.Whatever you need.When I lift my chin, his eyes are closed, so I kiss him.I kiss his mouth.The margin of it.The swell of the bruise on his cheekbone.His soft lips, his lowered eyelashes.This boy I love.I kiss beneath his jaw, my tongue flicking out to taste his sweat, his skin, and then his hands are on me, lifting my chin, and hes kissing me back.Its no tender reunionits a swan dive right into the middle of where we used to be, a plunge into blind lust and tension and sex.His tongue, his frustration, his taste, his heat, his lips on mine, his hands guiding me, giving me all of that, all of it, and I get carried away.Stoned on the taste of him, high on possibility, I tell him, Its going to be okay.Not because I believe it, but because I want to.Well get through this.And thats all it takes for me to wreck it.All it takes for him to take his hands off me and draw away.When he opens his eyes, I can see my error written there.Because what sounds like hope to me isnt hope to West.Its just a reminder that he cant have anything he wants.Theres no we.He steps back.Brushes his hands over his thighs.I dont need anything from you.I know what hes doing.Of course I do.He does, toohe has to, because his words are so patently ridiculous.My chest is still heaving.My lips are wet and full.My whole body aches, and West is saying, You should think about going home.It hurts.God.It hurts so much.But even as it hurts, I dont believe him.Ive had West inside my body.Ive locked my gaze with his for that first deep thrust, and I know what he looks like when he wants me.I know how he kisses when hes hurting, how he craves the oblivion our bodies can make together, the comfort afterward, the tired quiet space to talk in, to tell me whats weighing him down.I know better than anyone how to read the language of West denying himself what he wants.So I let him walk down the hill alone.I watch his broad back get smaller, watch him pull off his suit jacket and ball it up and throw it in the Dumpster outside the funeral home.I watch him disappear around the corner of the building, and I count off the time in my head.Ten minutes.Then Im going after him.The funeral home is hushed.Quiet as a doctors office or a chapel, places people arent supposed to enjoy themselves.Suspended places.The door into the viewing room stands open, but theres no one in there.No one in the hall, no one in the family lounge area.I walk out into the parking lot.The sun has dropped beyond the horizon line, and although theres still enough light to see, dusk is gathering.Im tired.I want a hot shower and a warm bed, and Im going to make West take me to Bos tonight.Even if he wont touch me, Im sick of sleeping on carpet squares in an attic that makes me sneeze.I dont want to wake up tomorrow morning with crusty, red rimmed eyes.Joans Chevy sedan is gone.She must have taken Frankie back to her place.I walk to the truck and check the door.Unlocked.Once Im settled into the passenger seat, I text himWhere are you?then glance at my email.Tired and lonely, I text my dad.Just wanted to check in.Im fine.I think how lucky I am, how extraordinarily lucky.Being with Wests family, seeing the way they are, helps me remember that my life has basically been amazing in every way that matters.Sure, I lost my mom, but I wasnt old enough when she died to remember having her.Who I remember is my dad, and hes always been there for me and my sisters.Crabby and controlling, yes, but Ive never doubted that he wants the best for me.Not for a second.And whatever minor differences I have with him, theyre always going to be just that: minor.I send another text.Im glad youre my dad.I love you.I wait a minute, but he doesnt write back.Neither does West.I lay my head down on the seat and close my eyes, hoping West will turn up before it gets too chilly.Even in the summer, its cold here at night.Something to do with the mountains.West would know why, if I asked him.I fish my earbuds out of my purse and put a song I like on repeat at low volume.Sleep comes down on me slowly, stealing into the song, rocking me to safety.The next thing I know, I come awake to a thump.My hand clutches closed around my phone; when I sit up and look out the windows, I dont see anything.Its completely dark now, the parking lot just a gravel patch with no streetlights to illuminate it.I hear a womans laugh, low and intimate.Theres another thumpa body making contact with the side panel of the truck.A quiet squeak against glass, and now I crane my head farther around to see something moving against the narrow window of the back part of the cab.A shadow, fuzzed at the edges.I realize its a womans hair when she says, No one can see us out here.A cloud of black hair, and the back of a dress that would be purple if it were light enough to tell color from shadow.The woman who hugged him too long beside the coffin.Mrs.Tomlinson.Wests voice replies, Youll have to be quiet.You know I cant.You need something to shove in your mouth?She laughs.Turn around, he says.A clack against the window.Her wedding ring.Its the ring that makes it real.The white streak of her teeth.Im dizzy.So disoriented, I close my eyes.That makes it worse.For a long moment, Im falling, stuck inside a pocket of time, drenched in violent revulsion as though its been dropped on me from above.A bucketload of antipathy, a full body no.No, this cant be happening.Her ring taps against the glass again.Yeah.Yeah, I missed that mouth.I dont hear what West says.I cant see him.I cant see him because hes down on his knees with his face between her legs.I turn away from them, blinking into darkness.When I was three, I fell into a lake in the winter.We went to a dock where you could throw bread crusts to ducks and geeseme and my two older sisters with my dadand I think Dad must have taken his eyes off me for a second too long.I remember fear when I backed away from something that scared me.I remember surprise when I fell.I dont remember being afraid in the water.Only sinking into a cold so absolute, a descent so inevitable, that I accepted it.Thats what this is like.I know its happening.I know Im angry.I know my hands are shaking, and Im nauseated.But all of that is as unimportant as the frantic shouting of my sisters muffled by the water.Im cold.Encased.Sinking.I drift without moving as the sounds she makes become more frantic.We could compare notes.Is he doing that thing with his tongue, Mrs.Tomlinson?Oh, he must have just scissored his fingers.That gets me, too.How many times have you done this?Did it start when he was your caddy?How old was he then?How many different ways did you use him?Hes using you now.They arent my thoughts.Its not my own ironic detachment, its just a random defense.A mouthy guard at the door.The real me is awash in rage and shame and sorrow so deep Im not even allowed access to it.I have to sink away.Let the water take me.Im annoyed when my phone vibrates in my hand.I glance at the screen and see that I have new texts from my dad and West.In funeral home office, Wests first text says.Im going to be a few minutes still.Wrapping things up w/ director.If we were inside the funeral home, Id have to feel something right now.Thats what theyre for, these places we create to receive grief, to allow it and mute it at the same time.But in the cab of this truck, drifting down into the cold with the scent of tobacco in my veins, Im protected from having to feel.Suspended, for now.I read the texts from my dad while West brings Mrs.Tomlinson to orgasm.I love you too, C.  Whats the word thereany idea when youll be home?A third one arrives.Let me know when, Ill pick you up.Shes noisy when she comes.I didnt know people were that noisy outside of movies.This scene is a parody, a terrible movie I cant turn off.Gravel clatters.West getting to his feet.He must see the interior of the truck illuminated by the screen of my phone.Her, too, now that her eyes are open.The sounds theyre making probably mean something.Im supposed to care.
