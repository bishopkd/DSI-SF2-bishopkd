Maybe it was the lighthouse, I wasn't sure."We're almost there. "he assured me.We ventured further into the mist, swallowed by a cloud until he was obscured from sight."Jordan, where are you?"He was no longer holding my hand.I cried out, but there was no answer.Was this death or oblivion?Just when I was about to turn around and go back, I heard his voice."We're here now. "he said softly.As I turned in the direction of his voice, the vapor began to evaporate.We stood in a clearing on the beach with the familiar sight of Hathaway Hall perched on the cliff above.It was daylight now and Jordan beamed at me with an intensity of pure love."This is our place," he continued, A playground for all eternity.We can be here together forever, and nobody and nothing can come between us    neither day or night, nor life or death. "His lips parted into a crooked smile."It's a perfect sanctuary for us. "My eyes swept the canvas of the dream.A brilliant rainbow married the sky with the ocean in a dazzling display of light.I must have drunk a magical elixir that heightened my senses.But I realized the only elixir I was intoxicated by, was love.Love for Jordan, and this new haven, our home on the beach.He took my hand and led me across the sand, our footprints leaving tracks along the shore.The tide rolled in and lapped at my feet.Everything appeared so very real.Even the air smelled fresh and salty as it animated the beach grass among the dunes.Jordan ascended the stairs leading to the house and beckoned for me to follow.The windows of Hathaway Hall twinkled like diamonds in the sun.When we arrived at the top, he walked to the precipice taking in the view.The lighthouse to the north gleamed as if brand new.He turned his head, reached out and offered his hand to me.I stood beside him on the cliff, with the tide of wind rippling through us.The moment was enchanted and the panorama of Eternity Bay seemed endless.I closed my eyes to taste the air.There was a scent of jasmine there.That had been the perfume my sister often wore.When I opened my eyes, I heard a familiar voice beckoning somewhere below."I've been waiting for you. "it called.I leaned over, attempting to find its source, but swayed and lost my balance.Jordan reached out for me, but it was too late.I fell over the edge, plunging down to the rocks below.I woke up in my bed drenched in sweat.My room was dark and I squinted to see the clock.It was already after midnight.I had slept most of the day, and missed my opportunity to see Jordan again.It felt like someone had drained all of the oxygen from the room.I got up to open the window and stopped.There upon my window sill, by the light of the moon, was a row of sea shells.I experienced a sensation of dj vu as I beheld the collection before me.For it resembled the one back home in Monterey.Jordan had been here, in my room, while I was asleep.He somehow knew, like he always did.I reached out to touch them to see if they were real.Indeed, they were, just as his love for me.In my heart I felt the warmth of his devotion.I went upstairs to check on Cassandra.She was fast asleep.Then I heard a noise in the corner of her room that startled me.I moved closer to inspect the area.It was so dark; I parted the curtain to allow the moonlight entrance.No rodents, nothing fallen, no Devon.I smiled at the thought that I might actually glimpse her imaginary friend.Though if Jordan was dead and haunting me, why could it not be possible for my niece?I closed the curtain and returned to my room.It was 1:30 a. m.  and I couldn't fall back to sleep.I peered out my window which had a western view of the cliffs.Looking down upon the beach for a sign of Jordan, but it was empty.I felt disconnected from life.Adriana was gone, my mother no longer recognized me, Nathan had severed our relationship, and Jordan was dead.These were all unchangeable aspects of my life and I wasn't sure how to deal with them.I thought about how the lighthouse door opened when I was with Jordan.Would it open now?I went to the front hall closet and put on my overcoat.Outside there was a chilly mist that had settled on the grounds.Everything appeared damp and sodden.I made my way hurriedly down the steps to the beach.A few minutes later I was at the lighthouse.I turned the handle, but it refused to budge.It was still locked.Had I imagined going inside and climbing those stairs?I retraced my steps and returned to Hathaway Hall.It was too cold to remain outside.I decided to read more of my sister's journal.Taking her journal with me into the Reading Room, I once again sat down.Switching on the lamp beside me, I opened the diary to a recent entry.March 12  Our birthday had arrived.I phoned Laura to wish her happy birthday and see how mother was doing.Unfortunately, she is now in a convalescent home.I long for the past, those days of our youth when mother and father took us to the Fair.We would have picnics and trips up the coast to Hearst Castle.But what I remembered most fondly, was the day when Laura and I travelled by train to Grandma Quincy's farm in Nebraska.Neither of us had been away from California, and taking that long train ride together was a unique experience.I set the book down recalling my own memories of that time.It was just before Adriana had left Monterey to marry Sebastian.On our eighteenth birthday, father had purchased two train tickets for us to go out and see the world; a world so much larger than our Monterey.It was a memorable time for me, and the last time I saw my sister alive.I flipped through the journal, pausing here and there.At one particular spot, I rested my hand on the page and got a jolt.In my mind, appeared an image of Sebastian reading the journal and dropping it to the floor.Curious, I began to read the entry.June 25  It had been too much for me to handle, the beatings had become a regular part of my afternoons with Sebastian.I needed to escape from him and the pain of what my life had become.So each sunset, I would go down to the beach and meet with my first love.For my life was with Jordan now.Like Sebastian, I also dropped the journal to the floor as if electrocuted."Jordan, my Jordan?"I asked myself.Could he be the same man who was in love with my sister?I needed to get some answers.I looked out the window and watched the sun begin to rise.Soon the library would be open and I would find an explanation, answers to my questions.What truth would I discover?What skeletons would I uncover?How had Jordan died?Would the man in the casket be the same man I met on the beach?The viewing and funeral would be at 11:30 this morning on Ellstrom Lane."Aunt Laura?"a voice called from behind me."Oh, Cassandra, you startled me. "I exclaimed.I quickly hid the journal under the seat cushion as I stood up."What are you doing in here so early?"she asked innocently.I looked around for some excuse."I got restless and couldn't sleep, so I came here to find something to read. "Her forehead crinkled into a frown."What about that book you got from the library?""Actually, I already finished that," I smiled."In fact, I was going to return it today.Is there anything I can get for you while I'm there?"She shook her head."We're still not finished with My Friend Jamison. "I regretted not spending more time with her over the weekend."I'm sorry, Cassandra.I've been so preoccupied.I wanted to give you some free time from your studies the last couple days, but I've neglected our reading time together. "In truth, I felt the weight of guilt upon me ."I promise we'll read your book later on when I get back. "My niece seemed pleased by this and wandered out of the room.I took the book out from beneath the seat cushion and returned it to the desk in my bedroom.I got cleaned up, changed my clothes and by the time I was finished, the sun had already risen outside.I prepared myself some breakfast and hastily finished before I could be confronted by Nathaniel.I took my sweater from the hall closet and made my way into town.Despite the late autumn chill, the walk was beautiful and serene.By the time I reached Main Street, it was almost eight thirty.The library would be open in thirty minutes.I stopped at Cramer's Caf, ordered a latte and took a table in the outside patio.
