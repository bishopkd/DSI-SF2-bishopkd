Its missing now.I suppose it fell off somewhere near the bottom of the steps.Christopher volunteered to go down to get it while the girls and I went outside to warm up.I would have liked to accept his offer but I stated firmly that I would run back and fetch it myself.Pride stiffened my backbone and made me call out airily, Wait outside, Ill be right back up.My brave words were still echoing from the farthest reaches of the vaulted chancel as I made my way back.I relit an oil lantern and proceeded determinedly down the narrow stairway.It seemed to have grown even colder since I had left.Rivulets of brackish water oozed from the rough sides of the walls and fell into soupy puddles with a tinny, clinking sound.I tried to turn off my thoughts, to concentrate on my search for the missing reticule.As I reached the end of the steps, the object of my search appeared in the circle of light from the lamp.I stepped forward and my body came up against a warm, solid mass.I stepped back quickly and there, in the light of my lamp, glowed a fantastically shadowed face.Sacre bleu!The French curse rang profanely.I didnt waste time screaming.I just fled.I didnt stop until I was encircled by Christophers comforting arms.I told him what happened with chattering teeth.He looked grim as he let go of me and said, You three stay up here.Im going down to investigate.No, Christopher, you cant.That man was hiding down there.Dont you see?Hes probably a smuggler.If you go back there hes likely to kill you.I was desperate with fear.Christopher pulled back his jacket, revealing a serviceable looking pistol held in place by a leather strap.Dont worry on my account, Elizabeth.I may not be able to hit the side of a smokehouse with an old fowling piece, but with a pistol Im a dead shot.He disappeared down the stairway.After what seemed like hours, he returned.There was no sign of him by the time I got down there.He must have gone into one of those connecting tunnels.It would be foolish to try to follow him.I dont know my way around down there so it would give him too much of an advantage, Christopher concluded with reluctance.Of course you shouldnt go after him.Its not your business to go chasing after smugglers.Thats up to the customs men.What made you go after him anyway?I asked.Christopher shrugged.His face took on a guarded look.Just an impulse, I guess.That man may have been down there earlier when we went down.I dont like being spied on.Its a dashed havey cavey business.Lets get back to the Goodbodys before they get worried about us.I wasnt about to argue with that!He couldnt have been more eager to get away than I was.On the way down the hill he handed me my reticule, which he had remembered to pick up from the cavern floor.As I took it from him I asked: Christopher, why are you carrying a pistol?Do you always bring it places with you?Well, no.Uncle Nicky thought it would be a good idea for me to have it with me since the whole thing surrounding my fathers death isnt resolved.He was still looking uncomfortable.I shouldnt have shown it to you.I dont want you to be frightened.There is just a remote possibility that whoever killed my father could take another crack at me.Of course, thats totally unlikely; the gun is the merest precaution, he pointed out a little too emphatically.I was happy for the sane normal atmosphere of the Goodbody home.They were alarmed at the story we told them but didnt hesitate to endorse our actions.The possibility that the man in the crypt had been another tourist who was just as startled as I was speedily dismissed.No tourist would have been down in that stygian darkness without a lamp to guide him.Also, a legitimate visitor would have followed me, calling out reassurances.No, the man was probably a smuggler, perhaps checking on a cache of contraband brought into port one moonless night when respectable folk were home safe in their beds.There was general agreement that the story of my encounter should go no further than this snug parlor.The gentlemen, as the smugglers were called, had a longer arm than the law even in these civilized times, and it could be fatally dangerous to provoke them.Besides, the excisemen were far from popular in the neighborhood as their jobs often involved harassing legitimate fishermen as they searched for illegal cargos.It wasnt until I lay in bed that night that I remembered the oath that the smuggler had uttered as I ran into him.Sacre bleu.How many smugglers in Dyle would curse in French?Seven After the excitement of our visit to Dyle, the next few days seemed sadly flat.Christopher had gone away with Lord Dearborne to spend some time at Petersperch.Kit had hinted broadly that there would be a surprise for me on his return.So there was that to look forward to, I supposed, making a few uneven stitches in the worn sheet I was darning.My bare feet were cool against the uneven stone floor of the cottage.It had been warm all week.I wondered what Christopher and his handsome guardian were doing at this minute.Perhaps sitting in an elegant velvet walled drawing room sipping chilled champagne from crystal goblets.I leaned back against the old elm settee and lifted my feet up onto a nearby chair.Wearily I reached my hand up to rub the back of my neck, when the memory of Lord Dearbornes caress that day in the library came floating, unbidden, into my mind.Hastily lowering my hand, I glanced across the room to where Mrs.Goodbody sweated over her butter churn, to make sure she hadnt noticed the betraying rush of color to my cheeks.I saw with relief that she was still intent on her task.She was attacking the semiliquid butter with such vigor that it set a tremble the flitch of home cured bacon which hung from the ceiling.I smiled, thinking how Christopher always managed to knock his head on the bacon whenever he came into the cottage.I decided to get up from my comfortable place and add some water to the peonies that I had placed in an old stoneware vase in the middle of the table.The heat had wilted them until they looked like the wives of Henry VIII, making obeisance before losing their heads.Halloa, came from outside.It sounded like Christopher himself.Were here, I called back, and he entered, promptly setting the flitch of bacon to swinging with a knock of his head.Blast!he muttered.Oh, poor Christopher.Weve been thinking about moving that bacon for quite some time, I said.How are you all?he said, nodding to Mrs.Goodbody.Its good to have you back, young sir, she said heartily.Elizabeth and I were becoming bored without our young Christopher.Christopher looked pleased.Youll be gladder yet to hear Im back when I tell you what weve brought with usthe primest bits of blood you ever saw, said Christopher with the air of one delivering joyful tidings.Kit, Ive never heard anyone like you for going on about blood, I told him tartly.He frowned at my response and then laughed, lifting me in his arms and whirling me round and round, threatening to upset every knickknack in the cottage.Theres never another girl like you, Lizbeth.Kit put me down, choking with laughter.I mean horses, little dunce.Remember I said Id teach you how to ride?You know, on the night of the Macreadys ball!Well, so I will.Uncle Nickys bought us horses to ride.Run and get into your riding habit now.Itll be the greatest sport ever!I was about to protest that I didnt own a riding habit when it occurred to me that there was one in the shipment from London.I remembered it particularly because the bonnet that came with it had a teal blue poke front trimmed with puffs of ribbon and everyone had been dismayed that it was so pretty but there had been no horses to wear it for.Go, said Christopher, nudging me imperatively toward the bedroom.I wondered more about the horses as I donned my riding habit.Was the marquis extending his commission more than was customary in this case?Horses were hardly a necessity of life.Perhaps he was doing it to amuse Christopher.It occurred to me that I should look these gift horses in the mouth and place it before the marquis that he was being overly generous.But life is full of things that one should do and one does not.The twins were already bouncing around on a pair of lively chestnut Welsh ponies at the shouted corrections and instructions of Jason, the groom.We picked a very ladylike mare for you, Christopher said.She had beautiful manners, youll get along famously with her.Jason, bring out Snowball, he called.Jason disappeared into the stables and came out again leading a delicate looking pearl gray mare who pawed the ground and snickered as she was brought over to us.In spite of her delicate appearance, she looked rather large from up close.Too large.Might as well begin right away.Come over to the mounting block.Thats right, now put your left foot in the stirrup, said Christopher, with the unconcern of someone born on a horses back.No, Elizabeth, not like that!All you have to do is slide your foot into the stirrup.I am trying to, I said, vexed.But the horse keeps moving away.Right.Well, Ill help you mount.Jason, hold tight on the reins and Ill give her a boost.There now, up you go!In a flash, I was on the horses back.It was a very long way to the ground.Hello down there, I said weakly.My vertigo increased as Snowball began turning in circles underneath me.Snowball is a weathercock, I told Christopher.You stole her from the top of the barn.No, honestly, I didnt.She only acts that way because she knows youre a beginner, said Christopher, intent on his new role as Jobs Comforter.Being on horseback was a strange feeling.The twins were soon right at home on a horses back.As for my own case, never was there a more patient teacher than Christopher nor a more inept pupil than myself.I had less grace on the Arabian mare than a farmboy on a plowhorse; moreover, instead of improving as the lessons went on, I merely grew more nervous.Once, in despair, Christopher cried: Elizabeth, youll never be able to ride until you show the horse whos boss.I dont have to show the horse whos boss, I wailed.Snowball already knows that shes the boss, its a foregone conclusion, shes fifty times bigger than I.  Christopher sighed, patting me on the shoulder with tolerant affection.Im afraid youre just too nice to ever be much of a rider.*** Apart from riding lessons and the usual chores, the twins and I devoted all our energies to preparations for the Norman Conquest pageant.Christophers efficient and imaginative assistance made us sure that our depiction of the invasion would be so spectacular as to outdo the real thing.After I had completed the final draft of the dialogue and read it aloud in the cottage, Mrs.Goodbody pronounced it not half bad, which my sisters and I interpreted as tribute indeed.There had been only one reservation.Mrs.Goodbody felt that a reference by King Harold to William the Bastard was coming it a bit strong and she told me mildly that I could keep or change the line as I saw fit; unfortunately, the look that accompanied her words made it clear that I had better see fit.I wanted to oblige her.But William the Love Child?I was mulling the problem as I lay flopped on my stomach on a worn blanket under a honeysuckle bush near the orchard.It was one of my favorite places for thinking, especially in the summer; it combined quiet with shade and the sweet perfume of blooming honeysuckle.Today I was awaiting the arrival of Christopher and the twins for a Play Committee meeting.I was munching absent mindedly on an oaten cake left from lunch when I heard the firm tread of leather boots approaching.Well, Kit, I called out without turning my head, what do you think?Shall we have a bastard or a love child?The footsteps stopped and I froze as I heard the voice that accompanied them.It would seem that the freedom of manners current among modern youth has reached alarming proportions.Lord Dearbornes drawl was lightly spiced with sarcasm.I flushed, thinking sourly that if we were talking about the freedom of modern manners, the marquis was certainly no one to moralize.I wondered what he would say if I asked him if he had warned the Snow Queen or Lady Doran about overfree manners.It was better not to find out.Its the play for our parish fte day, I explained.We plan to put on the Norman invasion of England this year and Mrs.Goodbody doesnt think we should call William the Conqueror by William the Bastard (for all that its true).But if we call him William the Love Child, it will sound like were only calling him that because we didnt have the courage to say bastard.If you can see what I mean.To my surprise, the marquis dropped, with lazy grace, next to me on the blanket.I can see that it would be a struggle for a sincere playwright.I couldnt tell whether he meant to be satirical.Torn between artistic integrity and the limitations of ones audience.Im afraid youll have to settle for natural sona compromise of bluntness and insipidity.Natural son.I thought it over and sighed.I suppose it will do though it still rings like a euphemism.Lord Dearborne supported himself on one elbow.He was dressed casually, in buckskins and riding boots with his lawn shirt open at the neck.A light breeze gently ruffled his hair as his sapphire eyes scanned me with idle speculation.His new benign attitude put me more on my guard than ever.What a pity it is that my guard is so weak.I returned his look with one of grave suspicion.I suppose that youve come out here to tell me something unpleasant, I told him candidly.I cant think of any other reason for you to come out here and cozy up to me.Cant you?A smile lurked behind the brilliant eyes.Actually I do have something Id like to ask you.I meant to lead up to it by tactful degrees but since youre so perceptive I might as well tell you now.Pray, do, I requested with dignity.Its nothing so terrible, only that I would like you to take one of the servants whenever you leave the estate grounds.Of all things, I had not been expecting this.I stared at him, amazed.But that would be ridiculous!I said, in rather a hurry.To begin with, I never go anywhere.Well except Dyle, but thats only once a year.Oh, and I went to the squires ball, though I doubt if they would ask me again because they only had me on Kits account.My God, was I now to be like Christopher, with spying bodyguards?I felt a nasty tinge of resentment creep up to sit gargoyle like on my shoulder.I wasnt used to taking orders from anyone but Mrs.Goodbody.I daresay its that you dont want me in Mudbury alone.Now that I can understandsuch a den of vice and iniquity as it is.I could hear the rebellion in my voice.Its a routine precaution.I work in the War Office and you are my dependent.Theres no real danger, of course.It is general government policy.Your friend Christopher is used to this sort of thing.It was all too pat for me.Your routine precautions didnt help Christopher and his father much, did they?I blurted out.He seemed to hesitate.So Kit confided that to you.Christophers father was directly involved in military espionage for the Crown.Unfortunately, this made him a prime target for Bonapartist agents.Obviously you dont qualify as a dire threat to Napoleon.The marquis looked like he had more to say, but he was interrupted by a long, silvery whistle that sounded like a cross between a calfs bleat and the somber honk of flying geese.The whistle was quickly answered by another.I picked up a long, fat blade of grass, folded it between my thumbs, and made an echo of the whistles.Do you hear those whistles?Those are my sisters calling to each other.Grass whistles are our secret signals.They can be heard farther than a shout, I explained.A more experienced woman would have been quick to recognize the sensuality behind the marquiss slow, lazy smile.I misunderstood.Encouraged by his smile, I asked him doubtfully if he had made grass whistles as a child; it was hard to picture Lord Dearborne as a rowdy schoolboy.No, but why dont you teach me, he said with a deepening smile.It seems like a valuable skill to acquire.Oh, the traps that are laid for the unwary.Id been warned before that Lord Dearborne was an experienced rake, but that didnt deter me from taking the bait like a mouse scampering to a cheesed mousetrap.I took a spike of grass between my thumbs, carefully cupping my fingers with the tips touching, and presented my hands to him with great seriousness.See, first you must hold the grass like this.He took my cupped hands gently between his and regarded me quizzically.And then?Then you bring your fingers to your lips Oh, stupid, stupid me.His long fingers slowly removed the grass from my hands and opened my fingers so that they lay palm up in his grasp.He drew both trembling palms to his lips, kissing them softly.These were the first real kisses I had received from a member of the male sex and they had a devastating effect.I melted as butter in the sun.His fingers caressed the sensitive skin of my wrists before drawing them up to his neck, at the same time forcing my shoulders gently down until I lay back on the blanket, passive and stunned.He tenderly lifted a strand of hair from my forehead, brushing his lips lightly across the skin beneath.A moment passed.His voice was a husky whisper: I wish that my conscience was either a bit stronger or a bit weaker.My God, youd be such an easy mark.He cupped my cheek in his hand.Youre so damnably seductive even in all your innocence.There should be a legion of chaperones protecting your virtue.Such a slow learner, pet.He was right.He was also gone before I realized it.I opened my eyes and I was alone, listening once again to the far off whistle of the twins.It seemed as though nothing had happened, like he had not been beside me at all, had not kissed me and spoken to me.It had been a dream or a wish.I stood up and shakily brushed the grass from the front of my gown.Far off over the hill, I could see the twins running toward me.Christopher would be here as well.It was time for our meeting.*** Later that week, another misfortune occurred among the staff at Barfrestly Manor.Although it was not as serious as the mishap which ended Henri, it was still the cause of considerable alarm.Jason, the undergroom, while exercising one of the horses, stepped into a rabbit hole and broke his leg.Dr.Brent spied me at the cottage door as he was riding out after attending Jason.Though I gave him no encouragement, he trotted over to say hello, his oversized medicine bag bumping clumsily against the saddle back, where it was secured.Well, hows the little sleuth?Still a lover of French cuisine?he asked, smiling down at me.Gentlemen will have their joke.Im doing very well, thank you.Have you finished setting the undergrooms leg?Will he be all right, do you think?Yes, hell do, it was a simple fracture.You would do well to fill in that hole the horse tripped in though; someone might have a nasty fall.He favored me with a patronizing smirk.Where is your little friend Christopher?His horse sidled briefly as he reached down to slap a deerfly from its neck.Oh, hes around.Im surprised you didnt see him.The smirk intensified and his eyes widened with unconvincing disingenuousness.But how good it is of Lord Dearborne to keep you here, you and Christopher make such charming playfellows.The marquis is not being good at all, I retorted, stung.Dr.Brent had a special talent for touching the raw places.My sisters and I are responsibilities of the estate.Its in the will.Ah, naturally, its in the will.Good bye for now, and give my regards to your sturdy Mrs.Goodbody, he said, turning his horse.I watched him ride out of sight, down the carriageway.He had an obnoxious way of putting tilings; in fact, he could make my hands curl into fists just by the way he said how di doo.It wasnt only the things he said, it was also the way he said them, as though he knew that you fed your share of boiled turnips to the cat or used your church offering money to buy peppermint sticks.Like the nursery rhyme:  I do not like thee, Dr.Fell, The reason why I can not tell, But this I know, and know full well, I do not like thee, Dr.Fell.The marquis instructed Joe Hawkins to fill in the rabbit holes in the pasture, but even with the assistance of my sharp eyed sisters, Joe was unable to find the offending opening.Jason was put on a stagecoach for another Lome property, to recuperate under the watchful eye of his mother, who was housekeeper there.Luckily for him, Dr.Brent was able to recommend a replacement as undergroom, because there were now so many horses at Barfrestly, between riding hacks and coach horses, that it was full time work for two people to care for them.The play was only a week away now and we were busy with dozens of last minute tasks.It was necessary for me to go into Mudbury to round up some final propsa rusty old sword from the blacksmith that looked like it had been around since the real Norman invasion, an old hobbyhorse for one of the twins to ride (whats a battle without cavalry?).These items and others had to be collected and ready in time for our dress rehearsal.I set off on foot for the village, alone.I knew Lord Dearborne didnt want me to go places by myself, but I had several reasons, good ones, I thought, for ignoring his politely phrased orders.One, it was only Mudbury; two, I was not about to walk around Mudbury with a servant in tow.Lord, people would think Id grown as puffed up as the squires wife!Lastly, I was a big girl now, in spite of what the marquis obviously thought.I hadnt been allowed to go alone to the village until my fifteenth birthday.Mrs.Goodbody always said, Little ships must keep to shore, larger ships may venture more.I was a larger ship now and I wasnt going to give up this hard won privilege, marquis or no marquis.I felt the little resentment gargoyle still enthroned on my shoulder.After picking up the old sword, I stood outside the blacksmith shop, chatting with the smithy.He was only too glad for the company and an excuse to pass a few minutes in the fresh air.The blacksmith was just in the middle of telling me how lucky I was to ride on such wonderful horses as Lord Dearbornes when my eyes widened like harvest moons.I had been idly regarding the passersby, when, incredibly, I saw the same man that I had smashed into in the church crypt in Dyle!There was no doubt it was him, walking hunched over down the other side of the road!He was wearing an olive reefer jacket with top boots, but it was the face that was unmistakable.It didnt seem fantastically scary now, not being illuminated in yellow in the depths of a crypt, but it was still a singular face.He had thick, bushy eyebrows, a pliable cucumber for a nose, and his cheeks were covered with pockmarks.His shoulders and back appeared murderously strong.Heart beating like a hammer and anvil, I watched him pass.When he was almost out of sight I took my leave of the blacksmith and began to follow, keeping a discreet distance.What on earth could he be doing in Mudburynot even the most optimistic smuggler could think that there was any business to transact here.Had he come to find me?To punish me for seeing him in Dyle?To spy, like Christa said?I decided to do a little spying of my own.Better to find out what he was up to now than have him kidnap me from my bed.I followed him to the edge of the common land where he paused by a two story brownstone house.I watched him from the shadow of a weeping willow as he eyed the house speculatively.The shutters were closed and there was no light showing.I knew Dr.Brent lived in this house.Perhaps Mr.Sacre Bleu was going to rob his house in his absence.But no.He began walking again, down the edge of the common land to a stand of trees, and then down the other side of a long flint wall.He was stomping along deliberately in what I assumed was a sailors walk, and took occasional glances over his shoulder.I was careful now to stay hidden as well as I could behind the flint wall.He took a sharp turn and took a narrow path into the woods.I followed him, stopping now and then to see if I could still hear his feet shuffling through the leaves.The noise stopped ahead of me and I took it for a sign that he had reached his destination.I crept quietly and low to the ground in a roundabout way, leaving the path and circling, wondering what to do next.A pheasant flushed in front of me, stopping my heart with the commotion of its wings.I waited a few moments and then continued, very cautiously.Between the trees, I could see a small meadow filled with friars cap and lanky Queen Annes lace.In the middle of the meadow was a large spreading oak.I crouched down underneath a beautifully delicate group of ferns, and observed as Mr.Sacre Bleu placed something under the gnarled roots of the oak.He turned and left the scene, going down the path again.I waited for a few moments, getting up the courage to investigate the mystery under the roots.His footsteps faded, and I held back yet longer.I wanted to make certain he wasnt coming back, so I mentally recited all seven verses of Rise, the Children of Salvation before I went to look.Having finished the hymn, I crossed the meadow to the oak, to see a corner of what looked like sailcloth sticking out from underneath the roots.I reached down and pulled it out.It felt light in my hands.I had no idea what it containedsmuggled goods, war secrets, or what.I was never to know the answer, for suddenly I was struck from behind by what seemed a bolt of lightning.I remember thinking, But its not even rainingand falling forward to the ground I was dreaming a fitful, fearful dream, in which I was being tossed on the breast of the sea in a very small boat which rode up and down on the waves.I was seasick and vomiting over the side, and was dimly conscious of a cool hand laid on the back of my neck.Thats the way.Let it all up and youll feel much better.The voice was gentle, caring.Here, lets wipe your face and rest a while.I sensed a clean handkerchief being passed over my face, and yes, I did feel a little better.I opened my eyesthe light was much too brightand saw Lord Dearborne kneeling next to me.He was draping his coat over my shoulders.Why did you hit me?I said to him, weakly.I was not the malefactor, although you were up to something which annoyed someone to the extent that he decided to chloroform you.It also appears that you have been struck on the head.Out with it, what mischief were you up to?What was so important that it made you disobey me and go wandering around the countryside alone?You are not my father.You are not even Mrs.Goodbody.You have no right to order me to do anything.That does not answer my question.What were you doing wandering around in the middle of nowhere?I was sick, and he was being entirely too forward in his manner of questioning.This made me angry.What were you doing out here?I asked him.I was riding.Peterby was showing me this deserted corner of his property, and I was on my way home down the path through the woods.Now if you dont come across with the information I have requested of you I will add to that lump on the back of your head.He looked decidedly grim.It made me hate him, but I was also afraid, so I told him: I was following Mr.Sacre Bleu.And who, pray tell, is he?Hes an ugly sailor type person with a cucumber nose who swears in French.A different look, perhaps of recognition, passed over the marquiss face.You followed him here.What was he doing?He was poking around underneath the big oak over there.I went over to look and there was some sort of package there.The marquis got up and walked to the oak, investigating where I had pointed, under the roots.There is nothing here now, he said.What does it all mean?I called to him weakly.It means you should do as I say regarding my desire for your protection.It also means that you had better tend to your play producing and other domestic pursuits and leave off following cucumber nosed suspicious persons.If it pleases Your Lordship.It pleases me.Now lets go back to the estate and you can have Mrs.Goodfellow attend to that crack on your head.Mrs.Goodbody.Whoever.Now lets go, Ill give you a hand up.This I allowed.But when he put his arm around my waist, I pulled at it with all my strength.I may be a slow learner but I am catching on.You may place that arm somewhere else.You little fool.Do you want to fall off the horse and break your neck?Non tali auxilio nee defensoribus istis tempus eget.Thats Virgil.And it means I know what it means, he interrupted.Not such aid nor such defenders does the time require.What an independent little creature you are.But dont fight me now.Youve been hurt and I want to take you home quickly.His voice had softened persuasively and he caressed my face gently with the back of his hand.This time when he pulled me into his arms and lifted me lightly into the saddle, I didnt object.I didnt push him away when he mounted behind me, one strong arm steadying me against his chest.Perhaps it was only the effects of the head injury that kept me leaning quietly on his hard body as the stallions effortless strides carried us back to Barfrestly.Eight Lord Dearborne created quite a sensation riding up to Barfrestly Manor with me in the saddle in front of him.He ignored me when I demanded to be allowed to walk into the cottage, brusquely picking me up and carrying me straight to my bed, as Mrs.Goodbody came hurrying across the yard, mobcap askew, puffing like a March wind.My Lord!Elizabeth!My dear lambkin!Where are you hurt, my love?asked Mrs.Goodbody, white faced.Your head?My word, heres a lump as big as an egg!Was that nasty Plumford boy throwing rocks again?If it was he then depend upon it I shall go straight to his father and give him a piece of my mind!Oh, no, Mrs.Goodbody, it was nothing so bad as that, I assured her.Only I was following a smuggler, or perhaps a spy, one cant be sure for he swears in Frenchonly that alone doesnt mean he is a spy, er, where was I?Oh yes.I followed him and saw him hide a parcel, probably stolen state secrets, or maybe I paused to reflect.Maybe just smuggled gems of great value.Well anyway, he came back around after I thought he was gone and hit my head.Mrs.Goodbody choked and said she never did, not in all her born days, hear the likes of my story, which was a gratifying response.What was to follow was not gratifying in the least.Lord Dearborne, with an air of paternal solicitude that would have done credit to an archbishop, leaned over me and patted me on the hand.Yes, Mrs.Goodbody, he said with the innocence of a suckling babe, its a pity that Elizabeth forgot to take an escort with her as I requested.There are a good many rogues about the countryside in these unsettled times.There, now the fat was in the fire.Elizabeth Cordell, exclaimed Mrs.Goodbody, her complexion changing from white to red.Do you mean to say that the marquis asked you not to go out alone and you never told me of it and then deliberately went and disobeyed him?Talebearer!Snitch!I yelled wrathfully at Lord Dearborne, who ignored me completely.He told Mrs.Goodbody that he would have a doctor summoned, and left.He was no sooner out the door than I received a snappy lecture from Mrs.Goodbody on the evils of disobedience and ingratitude.Score one for Lord Dearborne.From now on there wasnt a bats chance in the daytime that I would be able to leave the estate grounds without an escort.And further, the more Mrs.Goodbody lectured me on the gratitude I owed to Lord Dearborne, the less gratitude I felt.The man could probably have housed and shod a thousand orphans without feeling the slightest pinch.Besides, it was in the will, wasnt it?He had to support us by law.There was no point in arguing with Mrs.Goodbody on this head as His Lordship had already flummoxed her finely.In the time since Lord Dearbornes arrival she had gone from thinking of him as a desperate libertine to regarding him as a paragon among men.I could have disillusioned her by mentioning what he had been about under the honeysuckle bush, had I not been much, much too embarrassed to reveal that to anyone.I shuddered to think of my own response.Youd be such an easy mark, he had said.I felt my cheeks burn with shame and promised myself to be wary of him and his rakish trickery in the future.There was no desire in Miss Elizabeth Cordell to join the ranks of Dearbornes discarded conquests.When Dr.Brent arrived, he took a cursory glance at the lump on my head, congratulated Mrs.Goodbody on her excellent good sense in applying cold compresses, advised her to keep me in bed for a day, and predicted I would do very well.(This just shows you what an unsympathetic clodpole of a doctor he was. )The reactions of Christopher and my sisters were more to my taste.They declared me a heroine, and my attacker a villain of the first water.Christopher, as usual, couldnt be brought to share my reaction to Lord Dearbornes unfair restriction on my personal freedom.It stands to reason that Im not in danger, Kit, I argued.Why, the fellow would have killed me as I lay there if he had intended to do away with me.He just didnt want to be interfered with at that moment  Lizbeth, I swear you make my flesh creep, prosing on about your own murder like that, groaned Christopher.Of course Uncle Nicky has to protect you.Dash it all, its his duty as a gentleman.Tell you what it is, Princess, youre just not used to male authoritydidnt have a brother, lost your father when you were a child, and Ill wager the admiral never gave you more than a half hour of attention in all his years as your guardian.And as for that vicar you place so much faith in oh, well, dont flare up at me, I shant say another word.That was all that could be had from Christopher on the subject.The next few days passed slowly, domestic tinkering relieved by visits from the curious.Even the squire came to inquire how I did and to ask the marquis what action to take to capture the villain.Lord Dearborne had told him (as I heard from Mrs.Goodbody, who was present at the time) that there was no need to trouble himself with the matterthe proper authorities had already been contacted.I wondered who the marquis considered the proper authorities.Even spending time at home can get you in trouble.One afternoon I had company that I would rather have missed.I had thought that the squires ball would be merely a memory and that would be that.It didnt occur to me that anyone would try to further their acquaintance with me.That is why you could have knocked me over with a quill pen when Cecilia Macready paid a call on me, accompanied by a veritable entourage of other people I had no wish to see.As you have gathered, I was raised to be a country girl, and like any other country girl, I can spin, weave, plate straw, and make black pudding.I dont know if you have had experience with black pudding.To me it is a disgusting concoction, but Mrs.Goodbody is very partial to it.It is a goats belly stuffed with blood and fat.When preparing this dish, I have no doubt that my face assumes, of its own volition, a harassed and disgusted look.Such a look is what I was clad in, along with a greasy striped calico apron which had been cheerily starched before I began my labors.My hair had become an annoyance to me, so I had bunched it up and put it under a linen mobcap, where it lurked in miserable captivity, to sneak out occasionally and exercise itself in ticklish fashion on the back of my neck until I could find time to recapture it and put it back in its prison.My clothes were sticking to me in the heat from the stove, and I was just about to step out and take some air when there came a knock on the door.I set down my ladle, walked to the door, and opened it.Pardon me, girl, said a vaguely familiar voice.Oh, Elizabeth, its you!Such a charming little cottage you have here!Cecilia Macready hadnt recognized me out of my ball gown, and feeling like Cinderella at midnight, I cast out for my pumpkin coach, or at any rate, some way to salvage some dignity from the situation.With her were Christopher, Jeffrey, the marquis, a boy I recognized from the ball, and Lady Catherine Doran, of all people, looking like a vision from heaven.What was I to do?The boy from the ball spoke, in his peculiar braying tone: Well, being a republican myself, and somewhat of a free thinker, I believe it is laudable for a person of Elizabeths aristocratic station to live in a hovel like a common peasant.Sneck up, Godfrey, you bellow like a cow.You are a common peasant.This from Christopher, the friendly face in the crowd.Elizabeth, you remember Godfrey Woodman from the ball.He thinks he is Oliver Cromwell, dont you, Godfrey.Oh dear, said Lady Catherine.I feel faint.She was holding a delicate lace handkerchief to her pretty nose as the steam from the pudding wafted past her on its way out.Elizabeth, said Christopher.Pay no attention to my companions.Seeing anyone exert themselves upsets them; they feel it is bad form.Why dont you run and put on your riding dress and we shall go riding.I really cant leave my cooking right now, I stammered.But then something began to right itself, and I was on my feet again.I am making black pudding.It is made from goats blood and fat.It is really quite wholesome.I scooped up some with the ladle and waved it around airily.Godfrey, youll surely have a taste, wont you?This is good republican food.Godfrey turned pale, shaking his head in a vigorous negative jerk.This set the marquis and Christopher to unashamed laughter.When the marquis composed himself, he asked: Cat, why dont you try some?You are looking a mite faint.It might be just the thing to perk you up.Lady Catherine gave the marquis a look meant to be meaningful.What I do need, she said languidly, is just a brief recline upon a bed The insinuation was so strong that its intent was obvious even to me.I felt a warm blush creeping unbidden to my face.Christopher, who had been regarding me closely, hastily intervened: I can see that weve come pushing in on you at a most inconvenient moment.Cecilia and company just rode over from Macready to pay their respects, but well be off now.And they were off.I went back to my pudding chores, and after what seemed an eternity, I was through.I was sitting in the doorway cooling off, when Christopher rode up again, dismounted, and sat down by me on the step.He was wearing an apologetic air which fitted him stiffly, like a new suit of clothes.
