And this only confirms it, Hugh continued.Im sure youd be happier with someone of your own kind.Giles bristled.And what the hell is that supposed to mean?Now, for Gods sake dont go all Socialist Worker on me!Socialist Worker?Socialist bloody Worker?What the hell are you on about?Giles could hear his voice rising in both pitch and volume, but was powerless to prevent it.People of your class are always the same  Scuse me, gents, the barman broke in.Would you mind keeping it down a bit?People are starting to complain.Giles swung round to face him.Then they can damn well keep their noses out of it!This is a private discussion between me and myHugh?Hugh?He looked around frantically, but Hugh had gone.Back to their box?Yes, that was it.Giles should go and join him, and by the end of the last act theyd be all right again.When Giles got back to the box, it was empty.Reluctant to give up hope, Giles waited and waited.Mimis death scene seemed even more affecting than usual, Giles wasnt sure whyhe had tears streaming down his cheeks by the end.Hugh would mock him for it mercilessly  But Hugh wasnt there.* * * *  Oz was in the conservatory again when Giles got home.He seemed to have forsaken the Insanely Bad Elf in favour of one of Mummys bottles of Stoli.Giles slumped down beside him, and mutely held out his hand for the bottle of vodka.Hugh dumped me, he said, after a long swallow and a short coughing fit.Bastard.Ill scratch Upper Class Twat of the Year into the side of his Merc with my keys, how about that?Oz suggested.Giles groaned, and took another swig from the bottle of vodka.Wasnt it Twit, anyway?In the Monty Python sketch, I mean?Oh, who cares.I think Hughs more of a twat than a twit, dont you?Giles didnt answer.Was Hugh really a what Oz had said?Had Giles just wasted nearly two years of his life on on a front bottom?And why was he drinking vodka, anyway?He looked around the conservatory, whose walls kept tilting drunkenly.Ha.Stupid walls.Couldnt hold their drink Wheres my whisky?Gone, Oz said happily, holding up not one but two empty bottles of Scotch.On closer examination Giles realised that there were two Ozzes as well.Bugger.Yeah, I could just scratch that into the car instead, thatd work.Be quicker, too.Less chance of getting caught.Gis the vodka.Giles held out the bottle, wondering which of the two Ozzes would get to it first.The answer, as it happened, was neither.I think Ill take that, darling.Mummy?Giles looked up and began to snigger.Ive got two mummies!His face fell.And no boyfriend, he finished dolefully.
