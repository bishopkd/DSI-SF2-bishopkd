After all the years I have suffered, seeing you denied your true station in life, Im not going to have you saying anything so silly!Lordy me, whatever would your poor mama say?Tis like a wish come true, seeing you in your rightful company, Mrs.Goodbody had lectured.I remembered an anecdote Christopher had told me about the great Beau Brummell, who is quite the most fashionable man in England.Once, at a dinner party, he had asked a footman to name him his neighboring diners rather than trouble himself to turn his head to discover their identities on his own.Thankfully, I was to discover that affectation due more to avoid the disarrangement of the fastidious beaus neckwear than to the formality prevailing at the supper tables of the haute monde.Lady Anne was the liveliest lady imaginable, and alternately teased her brother, shared the latest political gossip with Lord Dearborne, and upon hearing that I was interested in classical studies, announced that she would take me to see Lord Elgins marbles on the very next afternoon, though Nicky disapproves dreadfully of the method of their acquisition.Yes, do take her, Anne.I daresay she will regard them as sacred relics, said Christopher, leaning over to tap me on the nose.Better enjoy your leisure while you can, Lizbeth, I daresay msister has a million devilish places to drag us to thereafter!Dont I just!sparkled Lady Anne.Ive only two weeks left before I join my husband in Europe; well be gone for four whole months.Tis an eternity, I assure you.So Ive to pack four months of socializing into a scanty fortnight and that takes a deal of ingenuity.Oh, Elizabeth, there are so many people that I want you to meet and not near enough time.Dont worry, though, for as soon as we are back from Europe we will install in my dear Johns house on St.James Square.A mammoth pile I promise you, but the most modish of locations!And you will come and stay with us for an extended visit.No, no, my dear, dont refuse me.Indeed, I would have had you come the moment I learned of your existence from Christopher, but all is at sixes and sevens with us with John suddenly being given that foreign assignment.He left last week for Amsterdam, John that is, and I was so delighted when Nicky sent to ask me to stay here.Ah, speaking of devilish places, Lady Anne continued with a sly glance at the marquis, Kit, my love, tomorrow night we go to Lady Catherine Dorans for a ball.It will be a dreadful squeeze, I know, but all the world comes.And, as Lady Anne had promised, it did seem that all the world had come to Lady Catherines on the next evening.Never before had I dreamed that so many spangled ladies and carefully tailored gentlemen existed.And the names of the guests!We hadnt been there for half an hour before Lady Anne had introduced me to so many notables that my head was swimming.As if it were a mere nothing, Lady Anne had made me known to distinguished generals, intimidatingly famous peers of the realm, and even a royal duke.I was grateful, though slightly overwhelmed, that Lady Anne herself supervised my preparation even to the finishing touch of adding one of her own heart shaped diamond pins to the shimmering cascade of curls that my ladies had lovingly arranged.The gown I wore was the heavenliest creation of semitransparent silk, smoky topaz with a demitrain.I wore my first pair of long gloves, too, and I was glad to have them for, as I ruefully told Christopher as he led me out for the first dance, my wrists were the only part of me decently covered.You mean the neck of your gown?Of course its decent, Christopher replied reassuringly.You can depend on msister to send you out just right.The girls got excellent taste, even the Beau says so and everyone knows how finicky he is.Sides, its the style to look as naked as possible.Its considered classicalthat should please you.Even the mens trousers are skintight in emulation of nude Greek statues.I hadnt noticed any mens trousers, I managed to shoot back primly, if slightly untruthfully, before Christopher and I were separated by a movement of the dance.It was some time before I was returned to Lady Anne.Christopher had a cadre of his own to introduce me to.Dozens of cheerful, friendly young people swarmed around us in between sets, eager to talk with Christopher after his absence from London.So many of Christophers friends led me out to the dance floor that at last I had to beg for a rest.Lady Anne was seated on a crocodile footed Egyptian sofa set picturesquely near a potted palm.She appeared to be immersed in earnest conversation with a foppish young man, but as I arrived she ousted him promptly and installed me in his place.Ah, there you are, Elizabeth.Richard, do run and find Elizabeth some refreshment.I vow this room has become horridly close.The crowd separated then, and across the room I saw Lord Dearborne.The marquis was beautiful by daylight but there ought to be a law against him in candlelight.The effect is devastating.The gleaming brass buttons of his satin waistcoat seemed almost dull in comparison to the shining highlights of his curling shoulder length hair.I ascertained with amusement that I was not the only female to notice.A number of ladies cast languishing glances at my guardian.I watched in fascination as Lady Catherine came to press herself against the marquis in an unconvincing stumble.Dreadful!I ejaculated in an undervoice that Lady Anne, who had followed the direction of my gaze, was able to hear.Then I flushed brightly with the shocked realization that I would have liked to try much the same thing myself.Lady Anne, thankfully misinterpreting my blush, returned confidentially, Dreadful is the word for it.But its not a view that we will have to put up with much longer.Lady Cats star is definitely on the wane.Already Nicholas is losing interest in her full blown purring.She tapped her ivory fan on her palm several times before asking casually, Tell me, what do you think of Nicky?I saw Lady Doran say something that produced one of Lord Dearbornes most alluring smiles.I think of him as little as I can possibly manage!I realized that this was scarcely a proper sentiment to express about the man who is at least legally ones guardian.Oh dear, that makes me sound like the most ungrateful beast in nature and I am fully sensible of all that Lord Dearborne has done for my sisters and me.I dont know what would have happened to us if Lord Dearborne hadnt gone on supporting us after Admiral Barfreston died.Sometimes Lord Dearborne can be the most charming of companions.And then there are times I stopped.I couldnt bring myself to talk about those times to anyone.Lady Anne regarded me strangely.Times when he scarcely notices me, I finished lamely.After a moment she spoke again, though sadly.Its very tragic that someone with the enormous potential that Nicholas has for real happiness gets caught up in so many meaningless affairs.Ive known Nicky since we were childrenour families were very close.If you could have seen him as a boy, Elizabeth He was full of life and so idealistic.Then one summer, his family didnt come to visit us as they had every year before.We got a scribbled note from Nickys mother that said they wouldnt be able to get away from London that year.Later, of course, the whole story came out.Nicky had had an affair with a married woman more than twice his age.Apparently her husband found out and made a bungled attempt at suicidehe even tried to bring a divorce action against his wife, naming Nicky as her lover.Nicky was only sixteen at the time.Nothing ever came of it, and its ancient history now by London standards of gossip.But when I met Nicky after that he had changed.I mean, he didnt withdraw from the world into embittered seclusion, he had just sort of soured on life.He was harder and there was a streak of cynicism that hadnt been there before.You see, the whole affair wasnt unusually scandalous by society standards, but it was all so sordid.Any woman who cares about Nicky will have to be very patient with him while he learns how to love all over again.Lady Anne gave me a sidelong glance, then continued: When it was over, society welcomed Nicky back with open armsthey were willing to accept far worse youthful peccadillos from anyone with Nickys title and wealth.Naturally, Nicky was well aware of the reason for their broad minded leniency toward him and that did nothing to improve his opinion of the human race.He has such contempt for womenhes used to taking what he wants without needing to ask first.I think that it would do him an enormous amount of good to care enough to ask.I thought of Lord Dearborne on those few occasions when he had unbent with me and his smiles thenas they were without mockery or contempt.Had this been what he was like as a young man before world weary boredom had eclipsed the sweetness?I wished suddenly, passionately, that he could regain whatever it was that he had lost in the process of growing up.For no apparent reason I suddenly recalled the time he had caressed me in his arrogant, loveless fashion under the honeysuckle bush, and again flushed to the roots of my hair.I was glad to have my wayward thoughts interrupted by Lady Anne, who drew my attention to a young man elbowing his way impatiently across the crowded floor.Oh Lord, Elizabeth, look.Tis Godfrey Woodman coming toward us.Kit says that hes developed the most profound crush on you while staying in Kent.I suppose theres nothing for it but you will have to dance with the tiresome fellow.Au revoir, my dear.To be honest, I didnt think Godfrey a tiresome fellow in the least.True, he had less sense of humor than a nesting osprey, but then he is a very good poet for all that he hasnt caught the public fancy.And I was glad to see a familiar face in the vast sea of unknown fashionables.After we danced, Godfrey led me over to a vacant seat and we exchanged ecstasies over Lord Elgins marbles.He was about to quote me a stanza from the epic poem he was sweating over at present when, very much to my amazement, we were joined by Lady Catherine Doran herself.Ah, Godfrey, prosing on about your poetry again?Dull work for Miss Elizabeth, you may be sure Run off now and let us chat a bit, said Lady Catherine, gifting Godfrey with a smile that robbed her words of offense.Elizabeth, my dear, I hope that you dont mind my informality but we hardly need stand upon ceremony, do you think?Nicky and I are such old friends.So, how do you find London?Its very big, I replied foolishly.There was something so intensely suave about Lady Catherine that it left me feeling remarkably gauche.Lady Catherine laughed as though I had made the cleverest witticism she had heard in days.Ah, to think that Nicky has undertaken your guardianship.How delightfully paternal of him!But tell me.My cousin, dear Mrs.Macready, told me that youve had some excitement since Nicky arrived, with the death of the French cook, no less!Here, my dear, let me refill your wineglass and you can tell me about it.I was so flattered that Lady Catherine was interested in talking to me that I was rendered inarticulate for a few moments.She was so warmly encouraging, though, that I soon lost the shys and gave forth with the full tale of Henris death, or what I knew of it, anyway.Lady Catherine hung on every word.I finished by telling her that I should dearly love to solve the riddles that I was sure still existed in connection with Henris death.Perhaps you shall, my dear.But how is this?You dont drink!Have another glass of wine.There now.We may be comfortable again.Let me tell you a tale in exchange for that fascinating one you told me.Lady Catherine went on to relate several very funny pieces of London gossip, what Beau Brummell had said to Lord Alvenley the other evening at dinner, and who Lady Caroline Lamb had tossed a plate of orange peels at during Lady Jerseys al fresco picnic.It is a very special type of flattery that Lady Catherine uses.She is so attentive, and so involved with everything you say that it gives you a marvelous, though false, sense of your own importance.Truthfully, my hostess was a little too attentive.She refilled my wineglass so many times that I was beginning to feel fuzzy.Wine is not my favorite beverage, but I was afraid to offend her by refusing to drink, which just shows you what a wimp I was at the time.The candlelit scene became a soft twinkling blur with Lady Catherine dominating the center.I dont recall how it was that we came to be joined by Lesley Peterby.I only remember Lady Catherine smile up at him in greeting.Ah, my dearest Lesley, how charming you are, as usual.Elizabeth, surely you know Lesley Peterby.I can see that Lesley is feverish to have some little chat with you, Elizabeth.You have met before, have you not?I made an effort at a polite smile which Lady Catherine promptly, if erroneously, interpreted as a signal to play least in sight.There I was, talking to Lord Peterlyn.Peterley?Petersby?The simplest name can become a tongue teaser if youre tipsy enough.Oh well, choose one and forge ahead.How are you this evening, Lord Petersy?His rather nasty one sided grin became even nastier.Peterby.But why not dispense with formalities?My friends call me Lesley.I was far from sure that I wanted to dispense with formalities.What I would have liked was a few minutes of country air to clear my head.Im not one of your friends.Im only your acquaintanceofficially at least.So I dont want to call you by your first name, Lord Peter thing.Furthermore, I dont feel like talking, so if you want to sit here, then either you will have to do all the talking or put up with silence.I was hit by the horrid suspicion that I was even more intoxicated than I thought.Imagine snapping like that at a man I hardly knew, and at a high society ball, at that.Far from minding, my companion threw back his head and laughed.Very well, then, charmer.You have merely to sit back and relax while I attempt to carry on the conversation for both of us.Let me see, what can two people discuss on such shallow acquaintance?The weather, perhaps?And do you find the climate to your liking, Miss Cordell?Yes, thank you kindly, Lord Peterby.Twas a trifle sultry yesterday, was it not, Miss Cordell?Decidedly, Lord Peterby.But not unseasonably so, I think.He paused to take a quick swallow of wine.There.You see, there is no need for you to enter the conversation at all.In fact, it would be quite superfluous.I found myself giggling.How absurd you are!Im afraid that I was awfully rude.I leaned toward him confidentially.You see, this is my first night in London society.Excellent.Rudeness is an essential ingredient for a long and successful reign in polite society.Witness the triumphs of Beau Brummell, Lady Jersey, and Lord Dearborne.The triumphs of Lord Dearborne were not my favorite subject.I drew myself up and said with dignity, Lord Dearborne is my guardian.I thought this over a moment.Sort of, I added conscientiously.Indeed?He had a smile like a cat.Do cats smile?Oh, how I wished that I had refused those last three glasses of wine.I rose to my feet with resolution, if not equilibrium.I am sorry to have to part company with you, Lord Peterness, but I intend to walk in Lady Catherines flowers among Lady Catherines flowers, that is.The carpeted floor tilted slightly beneath my feet and I was glad to grab hold of Lord Whatevers arm, as he had risen with me.Then you must let me accompany you, my fair acquaintance.I know my way around this garden well.He took my arm and escorted me across the room as I muttered crossly, Well, all right, if you must.I felt a wonderfully sweet breeze from the large glass double doors at the end of the room, but before we reached there, we were intercepted by my sort of guardian.The marquis, at his most urbane, charmingly but firmly dismissed Lord Peterwhat, who left after honoring me with one more predatory glance.But I wanted to go out into the garden, I squawked unhappily up at the marquis.And so you shall, infant.He led me out onto a lantern lit stone veranda.But not with Lesley Peterby.We descended several steep steps onto an uneven flagstone walkway.I took in a deep breath of floral scented air and exhaled slowly, feeling my nausea dissipate slightly, though the dizziness remained.I didnt relish the idea of Lord Dearborne telling me whom to go into the garden with.Is there something wrong with Lord Peterby?Not if youve a taste for coupling under the shrubbery, he said bluntly.I wasted about thirty seconds on a choking fit before grinding out, You are the one with the taste for coupling under the bushes, not I!Of all the hateful, degrading things to insinuate I returned to choking.Gently now, I wasnt questioning your behavior, only Lesleys.He isnt alwayslet me see, how to put this delicately enough for your earsshall we say, very gentle with women that interest him.You may say anything you like.Anything at all.Pray dont bother to consider delicacyIm sure that it would seem dreadfully provincial for you to do so.I stopped and lifted my hands to my swimming head, shutting my eyes tightly.Lord Dearborne, I think Im drunk.The hands that supported my shoulders had comforting strength.Here.Just behind you is a stone bench.Thats right.Good heavens, you foolish child, its nothing to cry about.Oh yes, it is!If Mrs.Goodbody could see me now, shed never speak to me again.And think of my sisters, how will I ever face them?I recited a melancholy catalogue of all the people that I could never again face.At one point I heard what sounded like a quickly repressed laugh from Lord Dearborne, but when I turned to look up suspiciously at him he was a study in straight faced sympathy.Sniffing dolefully, I accepted his proffered handkerchief.Now listen, my charming little nitwit, there is no need to panic.Youre not roaring drunk by any means.You drank a little too much too fast.It happens to everyone occasionally.You are just not experienced enough to know how to hide it.Youre saying that I cant hold my liquor like a man, I exclaimed.To my helpless surprise, the chill of the night breeze was banished by the warmth of the marquiss arm, which pulled me close against his hard body.The moment lasted forever, as though some giant hand of a time clock had stopped.A concerned call from Christopher brought it screeching back into motion.Elizabeth, there you are.I saw her looking a little tippy inside, Uncle Nicky.Need any help?Would you sit here with her for a few minutes?Im going to slip discreetly into the kitchen and bring a cup of coffee.The marquis grinned at Christopher.Im afraid that your protge isnt yet used to unwatered wine.Lord Dearborne melted into the darkness.Christopher took his place beside me and I lay my head rather heavily on his shoulder.Oh Kit, I feel so utterly wretched.I know exactly how it is, commiserated Christopher in a kind voice.Too much wine can make one feel sick as a sewer dog.Christopher!I said, rallying at this surprising information.Do you mean to tell me that youve been inebriated?Lord yes, he said cheerfully.Been half seas over dozens of times.But youre barely fuzzled, Princess.Never fear, Uncle Nicky and Ill have you right as a trivet in no time.The marquis returned and, plying me with coffee and comfort, he and Christopher slowly revived me.Lord Dearborne had somehow found my shawl inside and now draped it round my shoulders.Christopher carefully wiped my face with his handkerchief, dampened in the fountain.While I shivered at the touch of his fingers, Lord Dearborne tucked some errant strands of my coiffure back into place.Finally, Christopher stood back to survey their repairs.She looks good as new, eh Uncle Nicky?If they ever abolish the aristocracy in England then you and I can become ladies maids, dont you think?How do you feel now, mdear?As good as one can whos spent the evening sacrificing on the shrine to Bacchus.II want to thank you.Youve both been very kind The childs in worse shape than we suspected, Kit, said Lord Dearborne, shaking his head in mock dismay.Thank you are two words I never expected to hear from Elizabeth.Of all the detestable conceited!I gasped.There.Now you sound much more like yourself.May I have the honor of escorting you back inside?Refusing the marquiss proffered arm, I brought my chin right up and marched back toward the house, now much steadier on my feet.The funny thing was that my overconsumption of wine didnt ruin my evening in the least.I was to enjoy three more hours of dancing before I tumbled into bed and slept like a baby until the outrageous hour of nine oclock in the morning.Eleven I woke the next morning with my mattress swaying under me like the lurchings of a small craft on a rough ocean.With effort I opened my eyes and blurrily beheld one large violet eye, not two inches above my face.All right, Christa, you can stop bouncing.Shes awake, instructed the eye.Groaning, I thrust my head under a goose down pillow only to have it wrenched mercilessly from me.Go away, you Furies.I rubbed my tender temples.Christa, stop bumping the bed!If you two had lived during the Spanish Inquisition, they would have given you jobs straight away, torturing Protestants.Listen to her, Caro.Ill tell you why shes so out of reason cross this morning.Last night she must have got herself glorious oiled, Christa pronounced knowledgeably while propping the pillows into an inviting heap behind me.Glorious oiled?I repeated hazily.Wherever did you learn that expression?I sat up and leaned back against the soft mound of pillows.From Andy.Hes Lord Dearbornes second junior footman, and full of gig too.Theres hundreds of servants here.Well, perhaps not precisely hundreds but many, many.Caro came to sit on the other side of me and began to drag a hairbrush firmly through my tangled curls.If youd had any sense, you would have brushed this mop last night before going to sleep, then it wouldnt be so hard to comb out now.Have you forgotten that Christopher is going to take us to the Tower of London today?Caros eyes met mine reproachfully.Er, no, no.Tower of London?What fun.I tried to infuse my voice with enthusiasm.And isnt that friend of Lady Annes with daughters your age to come over later this afternoon?Lady Anne is very kind, isnt she?Yes.And yesterday she told us that we were almost family, because Lord Dearborne is Christophers guardian and hes ours tooso that makes us like sisters to Kit and so to Lady Anne.What do you think of that?I think thats tossing genealogy out with a vengeance, I laughed.Who was that plump little lady that you went walking with yesterday?I saw you go out with her after we came back from Lord Elgins, when I was supposed to be resting up for the ball.So.You were gazing out the window instead of resting, noted Caro, shrewdly.That was Mrs.Jameson, who is Lady Annes dresser.Do you know that all she does is look after Lady Annes clothes and fix her hair?And she gets paid a monstrous fat salary for it, too.Anyway, she took a liking to us and guided us on a walk through Hyde Park.It was at five oclock, which is the most fashionable hour, and the park was simply crawling with The Elegant.Do you know that we saw Beau Brummell and Lord Petersham!And guess who was riding with them?Caros voice was pregnant with mystery.Um, let me see.Napoleon Bonaparte?No?Was it William Shakesoww!Caro, thats quite a brisk touch on the hairbrush.Stop making such foolish jokes then.Beg pardon.Who was riding with Beau Brummell and Lord Petersham?Lord Dearborne!And he reined in when he saw us and came over to ask if Caro had recovered from her poison weed attack.What do you think of that?Everyone about was staring at us in envy, Mrs.Jameson says, because we were talking to such sought after gentlemen.Oh, and Lord Dearborne introduced us to his companions.I almost fainted when I met Beau Brummellhe is so censorious, they say.I was sure that my bonnet was perched askew or that I had soot on my nose.Christa put one hand up to rub the tip of her nose reminiscently.Mrs.Jameson assured us later that we looked very well, quite  la jeune fille.Did you know that it was Lady Anne herself that bought our clothes and sent them to Barfrestly for us?Mrs.Jameson went with her to help pick them out.Mrs.Jameson said that there was the drollest note from Mrs.Goodbody in with the marquiss letter when he asked her to choose clothes for us.Mrs.Goodbody wrote down our specifics and our coloringshe said that we had yaller white hare and pink eyes!Pink eyes, indeed!I exclaimed, laughing.How I will roast her for that one.Speaking of Mrs.Goodbody, have either of you noticed that She smells of April and here it is most June?interrupted Christa.Course weve noticed.I think her and the marquiss valet mean to make a match of it.Roger is a capital fellowperhaps hes almost good enough for her.Dont worry about Mrs.Goodbodys amours, Lizzie, we know that youve other things to tease you.You can depend on the offices of Caro and me to further that romance.With that alarming promise, Christa took her twin by the arm, tossed the hairbrush upon my marble topped dressing table, and left me with the dire warning that if I wasnt ready shortly theyd take me to the Tower in my nightdress.The next days passed in a whirlwind of sociability.Lady Anne had certainly meant it when she said that she intended to cram four months of civilized life into two weeks.Every moment was organized into a social gathering of some kind.Balls, routs, picnics, assemblies, soires, receptions, and card parties came head upon heel at an alarming rate.I was initiated into the mysteries of hazard and whist by Christopher, who supplemented his instruction with a rule book that advised one (rather shockingly) to sneak glimpses of the opponents cards to improve ones chances.Lady Anne gave me some very to the point counsel concerning the more esoteric conduct required by the beau mondesuch as a lady may not dance more than two times with one gentleman in a single evening and dont gallop your horse in Hyde Park.I was more than able to reassure her on that head; for all the time and patience Christopher had expended trying to teach me to ride, I was still a losing proposition in the saddle.I wouldnt have nerve enough to walk a horse in the milling, winding traffic in the park, much less gallop on one.And whenever we were not out or getting ready to go out, we were either receiving visitors or preparing to receive them.One morning, several days later, was particularly trying.We must have had upward of thirty people pay us morning calls.After the first three coachloads, Christopher had suddenly recalled an engagement to ride in the park with his friends, basely deserting his sister and me to the rigors of polite society.Not that Lady Anne minded it.I had swiftly come to realize that she was an indefatigable socializer.Finally we bade farewell to the last of our visitors and walked arm in arm to the dining room for lunch.Lord Dearborne was already there; I had seen him return from his mornings briefing with the P. M.  about a quarter hour earlier.We exchanged greetings and I tottered to a Chinese blue flowered wing chair.That was harder than chopping wood!Ive never in my life had to be so civil to so many people in so short a time.Lady Anne, that Sir Egbert Mysner must be the greatest friend of yours.Hes been here every morning this week.Lady Anne raised her eyebrows.And I suppose you think Lesley Peterby, Godfrey Woodman, and half a dozen others that I cant name off the top of my head are great friends of mine, too.Elizabeth, you must drive your admirers demented with your denseness.A good proportion of the company today was here for the sole purpose of paying suit to you.My mouth fell open.You dont say?Yes, I do say.Furthermore, I do wish that youd endeavor to rid yourself of your horrid habit of calling me Lady Anne.I swear you make me feel sixty.I balanced my elbows on my knees, and rested my chin on the backs of my fists.Do you know, LadI mean, Anne, this is the first time that Ive ever had suitors.I mean, Ive had seducers before, but thats not precisely the same, is it?I heard a gasp from behind Lord Dearbornes linen napkin.Nicky, stop laughing.How can you be so callous?Poor Elizabeth, I can see that youve been subject to the most shameful persecution.But pray, never repeat what you just said in company, or people will get the oddest notions, I assure you.Christopher strolled in, deep in thought.Lord, there have been some strange characters haunting the house of late.Was that Egbert Mysner shambling out of the front just now?I answered his question with alacrity.Yes, it was.And Anne says that hes my suitor.I spoke with pardonable pride.What!said Christopher with a grimace.That odious little lizard had the nerve to come here making up to you?My God, I hope that you sent him about his business with no further ado!Well, not exactly.I mean I didnt want to be uncivil.Dont you like him, Christopher?I inquired cautiously.Of course I dont like him.Hes the most self satisfied, prosy rat I ever met.When we were at Eton he was in the form ahead of meand continuously stuffing himself with cranberry tarts that his mother sent him.This was delivered with the air of one producing information that would forever rob poor Egbert of any shred of a reputation.You ought to have more sense than to go encouraging a detestable grabtart like him!Much abashed by this severity, I could only reply meekly, I wasnt encouraging him.Christopher regarded me doubtfully.I suppose that you didnt mean to, but if you sit around peeping up at him through those long eyelashes of yours, I daresay well never be rid of him, Christopher sighed.And watch that you dont go playing off your tricks on Lesley Peterby.Hes a deuced fine horseman, but the very devil with women.I saw you about to traipse off to the balcony with him the other night at Lady Dorans.If Uncle Nicky hadnt intercepted you, you might have found yourself in the basket.That did it!Oh, I would, would I?I retorted.Ill tell you something, Christopher.I may not be quite up to snuff in your eyes, but I am not so wet behind the ears as to be incapable of taking care of myself.There is no reason that I cant go anywhere, at any time and in any company I choose, without suffering the least ill effects.If you discount several bad scares and a lump on the head.Christopher was too polite to say it, but I could tell what he was thinking.At that moment I would cheerfully have handed over my much praised eyelashes for a chance to prove that I was competent to handle myself from bluff to bottomland.Ill show you if it kills me, I thought recklessly.Of course, I had no idea then that it almost would.At any rate, I was the victim of so much raillery from Christopher and the twins about my admirers that I began hiding in the closet whenever a fresh bouquet of flowers arrived.Caro delighted in thinking up horrible nicknames for every unmarried male under the age of sixty who entered the house.Sir Mysner became Sir Egbert Eggplant, Lord Peterby was dubbed Lord Lesley the Loose, and poor Godfrey Woodman was christened the Chinless Wonder.After that, probably with the intention of diluting the influence of Egbert Mysner and Godfrey Woodman, Christopher spared no pains to introduce me to his own circle of friends.They formed a cheerful, playfully gallant court; they were always ready to crowd around me at parties, fetching me countless pieces of cake and oceans of lemonade; they argued good naturedly over the privilege of standing up with me; and they took me up beside them at the park, to ride in their dashing high perch phaetons.However much they might shine in a ballroom though, Christopher and his friends had their hearts in the boxing ring, the hunting fields, and the racetracksthe boys were sports mad.Lord Dearborne, I discovered, moved in quite a different set.His was the world of influence and prestige.His friends numbered among the most celebrated names in England, and his title opened all doors.He was gone from Lorne House often, spending much of his time with the Prince Regent, who doted on his presence both at work and at play.There were times when Lord Dearborne attended the same social functions as we did, though he often came or left with a party of his own.Even when we were home for dinner, which was not often, we rarely saw himhe usually dined out.When he was around, I enjoyed his ironic view of his surroundings.I would be at a party, someone would make a preposterous remark, and I would find myself wishing for the marquiss acid tongue and quick comeback.Now and then I found myself gazing through the crowd for him when I entered some social function.Christopher told me that Lord Dearborne intended to attend the Ingrams garden ball; I had been there for at least an hour and hadnt seen him though, perhaps because there was such a great crush of guests.Lord Ingrams House (for its much too grand to be called a mere house) is situated on the outskirts of London, in an area still quite rural.The Ingrams extensive gardens are cut by well kept terraces and charming promenades that were now strung with Japanese lanterns, in such proliferation that only the more inebriated guests stood in any danger of bumping into any of the pseudo Roman statues or oversized urns that Lady Ingram thought (mistakenly, in my opinion) added refinement to her grounds.I had been conscientiously executing a country dance with one of Lady Annes elderly great uncles when it came time for the musicians to take their break.My octogenarian gallant escorted me back to the quiet moon kissed corner in the garden where Lady Anne was chatting with two formidable matrons who patronized me briefly before returning to their interrupted coze.It was some time now since the last of the suns rays had vanished, and a testy little breeze came to lick at my bare arms and shoulders.Lady Anne, seated next to me on the wrought iron settee, must have noticed me shiver, for she gave me a quick hug and said: Why, I believe that youre chilly, arent you?One doesnt notice the wind when one is dancing, but as soon as one sits down, it creeps up.Never mind, my dear, Ill run up to the cloakroom and fetch your shawl.No, no!I will get it myself, theres not the least need for you to go, I told her hastily, terrified by the prospect of being left to converse with Lady Annes haughty friends.I would almost rather chat with the executioners axe as these autocratic damsels.I can find my way about easily.The gardens are laid out so logically and Ill be back in a flash.One of the ladies lifted her eyebrows in well bred surprise, which informed me that in a flash, a tidbit gleaned from Christophers vocabulary, was a sadly vulgar phrase.The raised eyebrows and an absentminded pat from Lady Anne sped me on my way.Walking down a white, crushed rock path through the beautiful flower beds, I found myself with a delightfully free feeling of being let out of lessons.At the end of a path to my left I spied a row of foxgloves nodding invitingly.Why not?What danger could possibly befall me walking alone in the Ingrams garden?I was soon to find out.At the curve of the walk was a modern statue of Cupid, one of those chubby cherub types.Its terrible what sculptors have done to the dangerous Greek god of love.Out of impulse I placed a kiss on his plump lips, and pulled a pout back at him.At the other side of the small pathway was a red brick wall and growing off into the darkness was a line of delicate yellow daffodils.Their coloring seemed to almost match the gown I was wearing and I held out my hem to a petal to compare the two more closely.A melody wafting through the trees informed me that the musicians had resumed their playing.Humming the tune, I swayed from side to side with the music, and curtseyed to the honey locust tree, saying aloud, Wont you share this dance with me?I would be delighted!said a deep male voice from the shadow of the tree.I screamed.A form stepped out of the shadow, and it was a moment before I recognized Lord Lesley Peterby.Thank heavens its you, I said, gasping with relief.You gave me such a fright.Why didnt you declare yourself immediately when I entered this alcove?I would have missed a charming little spectacle.The moon glinted from his wavy dark hair, which was falling over one eye in its usual fashion.His eyes traced the neckline of my gown.He came over to stand too close to me, and I backed away from him.The alcove suddenly became very dark and isolated, the music drifting down from the night sky an ethereal orchestra from the dark side of the moon.Well, Lady Anne will be expecting me, I said with false brightness.Peterby stepped into the path.I attempted to sidestep him, and with a neat, imperceptible movement on his part, I walked right into his arms.You give your kisses freely to a stone Cupid, he purred dangerously.Why not bestow them where they will be appreciated?I disentangled myself and took three rapid steps back.Lord Peterby, let me correct your evident misapprehension that I came to this alcove for any purpose other than to sniff the flowers and be by myself.Will you kindly step back from the path and allow me to be on my way?Now, according to every book I had ever read, that line should have crushed him into submission.Unfortunately, it appeared that Lord Peterby had not read the same books.He walked toward me, I continued to back away, until suddenlyto my dismayI felt the roughness of the brick wall through the back of my gown.He placed a hand on either side of me, flat on the wall.Oh yes, I will let you be on your way, but not just yet, my angel.I am not interested in whatever you have in mind, I said tartly.If you wish to accompany me back to the dance, that is fine.If not, allow me to pass.His eyes narrowed.Whats the matter?Are you afraid of a real man?Or do you prefer the fumblings of inexpert schoolboys?I dont prefer anyones fumbling advances right now.If you had any decency, you would desist from your unwelcome attentions.By God, when some lightskirt thinks she can lecture me about decency Dont put on a load of innocent airs for me, my beautiful Cyprian.I know Kit Warrington has you in keeping.I was stunned.What do you mean, in keeping?I asked him weakly, hoping I had misunderstood.He laughed harshly.Come now, Christopher couldnt be that bad a lover for all his tender years.Especially if that little ballet dancer he supported last year is any indication.She seemed happy with the arrangement.And then, because I couldnt think of anything mean enough to say back, out of sheer shaking temper I hit him.My novel reading sisters would have been so pleased to see me imitate the behavior of their favorite heroines, and for a split second I felt a vaguely surprised pride in myselfI didnt know that I had it in me.My satisfaction lived less than a heartbeat though, dying with one look at Lord Peterbys face.His arm slid down the wall and he grabbed me with iron fingers.God damn you, you little slut, he snarled.Ill break you in half if you try that again.Tears of rage sprang into my eyes.Go ahead.Id rather endure a beating than put up with your hateful advances.If I were a man you wouldnt dare to stand here telling despicable lies about Christopher.By God, if you were a man Youd better spend your time learning to be a woman first if you intend to keep Christopher interested.Let me give you a lesson in womanhood.His merciless hands dragged me behind him through the nearby bushes.My heart jumped to my throat, blocking a scream as I realized the peril of my situation.I gathered my breath for another attempt, only to feel Peterbys hands close tightly over my lips.Be silent, he growled.We came to a rectangle of light that I recognized as a window in the yellow stone gatehouse that our carriage had passed on the way into Ingram Park.Now look in the window and see how a real woman behaves.Shocked, apprehensive, I did as he commanded.Inside stood Lady Catherine and Lord Dearborne, locked in a torrid embrace.A large ruby winked malevolently on the marquiss hand as he caressed Lady Catherines bare shoulder.Their relationship was no secret to me, but there was something very powerful about observing it with my own eyes.I turned to look at Peterby, who was leaning against the building, his arms crossed casually in front of him.If you aspire to the demimonde, then take a lesson from Londons leading strumpet.Lady Cat knows all the tricks.He took my chin roughly between his fingers.When you decide youve had enough of the adolescent set, look me up.Ill be very generous.He turned on his heel and left me alone and shivering.Luckily, Christopher and Anne interpreted my stony silence on the way home from the ball as exhaustion.They tactfully suggested that we all retire immediately upon arrival at Lorne House.I lay sleepless in bed listening to the sounds of the great house quieting down for the night.I tossed restlessly for some time before relighting my candle and looking about for something readable.Unfortunately, I had no promising volume at hand and began to think wistfully of Lord Dearbornes well stocked library downstairs.Crawling out of bed, I hunted through my Hepplewhite tallboy for a warm dressing gown, as my nightdress was one wispy layer of white chiffon.The house was in absolute slumber as I slipped down the stairs.On entering the library, I was delighted to find that someone had left a fire burning in the polished steel grate; it had been a chilly evening.I sat primly on the Queen Anne damask sofa and opened a leather bound book of Shakespearean sonnets.
