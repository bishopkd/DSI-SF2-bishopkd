Unfortunately, he spotted me just as I was about to flee.Charley, he said, rising fluidly.He was wearing a dark gray suit with a robins egg blue shirt that was just a shade darker than his eyes.Last night I had been in a bit of shock and hadnt been able to fully appreciate his subtle beauty  the sharp cheekbones and strong jaw.His tall, lean body and inviting smile.Nick was classically good looking, but not obnoxiously so.I couldnt help but return his smile.Nick.His smile grew wider at the sound of his name.He straightened his tie as he stepped closer.You got my note?I did.My brain had gone blank and I had to struggle to remember what the note had said.You forgot to leave a number.I didnt forget.Nick shoved his hands in his pockets and lowered his voice.I prefer to get my answers in person.Even if its a rejection?He shrugged.I wouldnt know.I never take no for an answer.So you really are just as cocky as they say.As who says?He tilted his head just a little.The Daily Scandal, for one.I was challenging Nick and he knew it.For his part, he didnt take the bait.People like to talk.The internet lets them do that anonymously.Ive got more important things to worry about than what the internet says about me.Nick tried to sound nonchalant but I detected annoyance in his tone.Youre not avoiding the question, are you?I honestly didnt know.He had given me the entire day to decide what my answer would be and I was still undecided.Thank you for the flowers, I said instead.That was very sweet of you.I have my moments.His eyes narrowed suspiciously.You still havent answered my question.Should I be worried?A cloud passed over us, literally, blocking the sun momentarily.The sudden darkening was ominous.Nicks face was more angular in the shadow and made him seem slightly dangerous, like his inner bad boy was being exposed.I had a weakness for bad boys.Fine.Fine?His eyebrows rose hopefully.My answer is yes, I guess.Nick laughed awkwardly.Please, try to contain your excitement.Im sorry.Youre right.I was being rude and we both knew it.Lets give it a shot.I was hoping you would say that.He gestured down the road in the direction from which I had arrived.Lets go.Lets go?I asked in alarm.Like, right now?Sure.Unless you have other plans...A quick smile that made it impossible to say no.Okay, lets go, I agreed.Whats the plan?What makes you think I have a plan?This time his smile hinted of mischief and there was no doubt that he actually did have a plan.So Im just supposed to blindly follow you?Its called trust, Charley.Nick held out his hand.So do you trust me?I gave his hand a long look before cautiously placing my hand in it.Dont make me regret this.I didnt know what to expect as Nick led me down the street.He walked leisurely but with confidence, keeping up a steady stream of small talk.I wasnt usually a big fan of small talk but Nick had a special charm in his demeanor that I couldnt resist.Before sitting down for dinner, we had both run through our biographies and we were ready to tackle more serious matters.How did you find this place?I asked, looking around the bar.It was nearly empty and we were seated at a small table near the back, while four other patrons lined the bar.We were able to talk freely without anyone overhearing us.My ex lived a couple of blocks over.I spent a lot of time in here when I needed to get away.Nick took a long drink of his beer.The ex fianc?My interest was piqued.It was no secret that Nicks recently failed romance had been the talk of the town.His broken engagement had made him the most eligible bachelor in Congress.Nicks jaw clenched for several seconds before he nodded and said, Heidi.I leaned forward and lowered my voice even though no one could hear a word we were saying.Details please.What details?All of them.How did you meet?How long did you date?Why did you break up?At a charity event.Two years.And its a long story.Nick tilted his beer at me.Your turn.Fire away.I leaned back in my chair and crossed my arms.Why do I know your name?Because I told it to you?Nick shook his head.Thats not what I mean and you know it.Ive heard your name, and it happened long before these last 24 hours.Its a common name.Im sure there are dozens of Charley Tanners floating around.Nick smirked.Female Charley Tanners?I doubt that.I shrugged.Ive lived in Washington a long time.We run in similar circles.Everyone in Washington runs in the same circle.This town is one giant political circle.Nick twirled his beer bottle in a slow loop on the table.I could just pull out my phone and Google you.Our first date and youre already talking about Googling me?Scandalous.I tried to keep my tone even but we both knew he had me.Even if I kept my mouth shut on the matter, it would take less than thirty seconds for him to find out on his own.Wait.Nick held up a hand to stop me.Where are you from?Wisconsin.Where in Wisconsin?The second I answered that question, Nick would figure it out on his own.I didnt so much as blink when I answered, Morville.I could see the recognition pass over his face.Any flirtation that had been skirting at the edge of our conversation was now gone completely.How old are you?Nick wasnt at all embarrassed by his bold question.Twenty eight.Charley Tanner.This time when he said my name his voice sounded haunted.
