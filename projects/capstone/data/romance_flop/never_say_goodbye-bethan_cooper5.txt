...happy.I grin.Me too, Ellie, last night was...words fail me.I smile at him and copy his motions with my fingers.I trace his sculptured jaw, across his stubble, and gently lean forward and kiss his mouth.He holds me there and kisses me back softly and I smile beneath the kiss.He rolls me over so that I am beneath him.I think I might love you, I whisper and he raises his head to meet my stare.His eyes search mine in an attempt to understand my words and his forehead rests against mine.Do you mean that?He whispers, his eyes clenched shut.Yes, I think I do.He gently kisses me again and we fall into each other.I feel his love and fight for me, and we gently make love once more.******    Im gently dozing when his fingertips gently graze across my scars.I hate how all these lines show how sad you were.He looks refined, ashamed.It feels so soft and gentle when such a pain occurred there.They show me how much I hated myself, blamed myself, for Jay, for everything.This one is wider than the others.He looks at me with such a worry etched on his perfect face.Luke...please dont feel sorry for me.I look down at the scar and watch his index finger go back and forth across it and I remember how that one happened instantly.That was my first one.I whisper.Tell me, Ella, he whispers.You really want to know?He looks down at my arm and back up to me.I just want to understand.Okay.I breathe in deeply and shudder at the memory.I was at school.It was lunch and I felt completely alone.I had no one.I walked into my English class; I know it was a Tuesday because he died on Saturday.I stop and he looks at me and kisses my forehead gently.As I walked in, there was no teacher, just the class.Some sat on tables, some sat at their desks.I believe you were there, too.Just as I thought my day couldnt get any lower, they all started to chant Ella 'Smella'.Then, as if I wasnt afraid enough, orange juice, water, pencils, paper, hit me from all directions.Someone even spat at me.At that moment, I wanted to know why these people hated me, why they didnt care about me.What had I ever done to hurt them?What gave them the right to hurt me?The worst part was that even Jade wasnt interested in me.I just broke down in front of everyone.He puts his finger to my lips to silence me.Ella, I cant listen to this, I remember.I don't know why people did that, why they felt the need to hurt you.I never even involved myself.Luke, let me finish.I give him a reassuring smile and he goes back to stroking my arm.I just remember angrily wiping my tears away and I felt such an anger, a hate, a fury.I walked into the cafeteria....I grabbed a plastic knife and fork, opened the packaging, and threw the fork in a trashcan.I went into the girls restroom and locked myself in a stall.I pushed up my sleeve and stared at my wrist.I know my tears were hot and heavy because I remember dashing them away.I saw where I wanted to do it, placed the knife to my wrist, and with each cut I felt angrier and angrier slicing into my flesh.The blood just poured out of me, Luke, and I just remember the noise, it was like a dripping tap, each drop of blood hitting the cold floor and I felt numb.I felt nothing.I panicked and I held my wrist with my other hand.I thought Id cut an artery.The blood just kept escaping, no matter how hard I pressed my hand to it.I began to cry, not just an average cry, but also a howl.I couldnt stop the pain, this pain I felt for Jay, for my life.But I couldn't feel the pain from my wrist, it emptied so much out, pouring it away with the blood.I stop to choke back the sob of my memories.Luke is still listening.His face just empty of emotion and I know, deep down, how he feels for me.I swallow hard.I walked out of the restroom and people were everywhere.Nobody stopped me.Nobody asked me if I was okay, do you know how that feels?I turn back to face Luke and hes crying.No, Luke, dont cry for me, I beg.Honestly, Im passed all this, honest.I smile and wipe his tears away.Its just guilt, Els, It just makes me sad to know you were like this.You always stood out to me, Ella; I think I even liked you then.I could have defended you, but no, my reputation mattered more and Im so sorry for that, Ella, I really am.Its not your fault, none of this is.Its just all about my depression, my loss, and me.It will one day all disappear, my anxiety, my panic attacks.I know one day they will disappear.He smiles at me and gently kisses my lips.What do you want to do today?I dont know what do you have in mind?I could take you to a high school party...My expression is blank.Or not...he laughs.What college are you going to, Luke?Ella...I dont want to ruin this right now.Im going to UCLA I think.Its what I want.Tell me, Luke.I got into Princeton.He breathes.I have to look away.Oh God, what do I do?In four weeks he is going to be 2,000 miles away from me.See, Ella, I told you.His fingers float through my hair as I try thinking of a logical way for us to work.That's across the country, I sigh.I know.Its closer to home for me, just a short flight.My dad wants me to come home on weekends to help with the business we are developing so I have something to cling to after college.I cant help it but unbidden, unwanted tears gently fall down my cheeks.Oh, Ella, please dont cry, I cant bear it.He pulls me close and I sob quietly against his chest.This is what you meant isnt it?Why we couldnt work, this is what you meant isnt it?Yes.You told me what college you were going to and I had to try distance myself, but, Ella, I cant.I pull away and wipe my eyes.We will make it work, Luke, I cant only have four weeks with you, I love you.Actually, Ella, Im gone the day after prom.WHAT?I shout."You lied to me?"He sighs softly.I need to be settled in New Jersey and my time obviously starts before yours.I look at him and sigh.I cant be this, do this now.I dont want to know that we have to split and be so far away from each other.I need a shower, I breathe.Ella...please, he begs.Luke, I cant.I just...cant, okay?I shift to move off the bed and he grabs my wrist and pulls me back so I am on top of him.Straddling his hips, I gently lean down and kiss his partly opened mouth.I cant.I whisper and he pulls me down and holds me, neither one of us wanting to let go.Eleven      After what feels like forever, he loosens his grip on me and I climb off, holding back my tears.Shit, shit, shit.I dont have my car.I need distance and I dont have my fucking car!Ella.Luke breathes as I scurry around his room, looking for something to cover my modesty.Hes sitting up looking at me, his green eyes filled with worry.He seriously takes my breath away.I stop and stare for just a second.Holy fucking shit.Ive lost my virginity and now hes told me hes leaving in two weeks.Before I know it, Im on the floor in a crumpled heap, holding his sweatpants close to my chest.I sob into the comfort of them and his warm arms cradle me.Breathe, Ella.Luke strokes along my upper arm, I breathe slowly in and out, letting the air flow through my lungs.Luke.I sob.Ive got no place to go without you, its just too much, and Ive just given myself to you, God.I say the last word with rage.Ive fucking given myself to you!I scream.Ella, please dont curse at me!He looks down at me, his face screwed up with anger.You wanted to, I wanted to.We are both consenting adults.THATS NOT THE FUCKING POINT!I growl.IF I KNEW YOU WERE GOING AWAY IN TWO MOTHER FUCKING WEEKS, I PROBABLY WOULDNT HAVE GIVEN MYSELF UP TO YOU.I jump to my feet, storm over to the bathroom, and close the door.Im filled with rage.I put his sweats back on and pull on a bathrobe.Putting my hands on either side of the sink, I scream into the mirror, looking at the stranger staring back at me.Hes bashing hard on the door but right now, I couldnt really give a fuck.ELLA, LET ME IN!He shouts.NO!Please, Ella.He begs.Theres a long silence and I listen intently for his next move.Fine, have it your way.Before I know it, the door is smashed open, shards of wood scatter to the floor, and the door is hanging on its bottom hinge.What the fuck?Luke has my head in his hands, kissing mercilessly at my mouth, pushing me hard up against the wall.I gasp at the impact.No, I don't want you.I just cant...help it.My body gives in and we are in a state of passion and outrage.His tongue clashes with mine fiercely and we are smashing around his bathroom.He lifts me on to the vanity unit and a glass tumbler falls to floor, smashing into a million pieces.I briefly look away to assess the damage, he roughly pulls my chin back to look at him, and he stares at me.His stare just...melts me.God, Ella, You are mine.What?I whisper.M. I. N. E He spells it out, each letter a staccato.How am I yours?I look at him, my head tilted to the side playfully.You just are.Ella, Im in love with you too.What?I say, breathing heavily now.You consume me, overwhelm me, You.Are.Mine.He grabs my face and kisses me again   Hard.He pulls a remote from the drawer next to me and turns on the stereo.Bullet For My Valentine plays, These Tears Dont Fall.I know it so well.Oh, angry music.We kiss, desperately pleading with each other.He strips me, fast.My bathrobe yanked open, sweatpants off in seconds.He grabs both of my ankles, spreading my legs open and takes me again, but this time its hard, desperate.The lyrics catch me.Would she hear me if I called her name?Would she hold me if she knew my shame?Were in an angry, passionate, erotic embrace, our bodies serving and working with each other.I writhe on the surface of his sink; my hips moving up to meet him.He thrusts into me hard and fast, completely filling me.Come for me, baby, he whispers seductively into my ear, and on his cue, I climax, spiraling endlessly, and I scream as if for my life.He keeps up his pace, entering me over and over again, supplying me with multiple orgasms until he finds his release and holds me, my legs still shaking and my toes are numb.Why are my toes so numb?Our sweaty bodies hold each other.Hes just taken me on his vanity unit.Oh, my, God.I look up at him and he smirks then kisses me.Did you use a condom?I blurt out and he looks down at me, shocked.Shit.he whispers and looks at me panicked.Of course I fucking did, Ella.He slides out of me, releases me, and turns to wink at me.Fucking arrogant pig!Oi!I shout and watch his magnificent, flawless, muscled, godly body look back at me.Yes?He asks sweetly.Where are you going?I say, conscious of myself, still sitting butt naked on his vanity unit.To have a shower.Are you coming?He asks, a grin across his face.Now the fucking shower, three times already, and now the shower?Um yeah, sure.I submit, gently easing my sore body off the vanity unit.I follow him, staring at his ass as we make what feels like a mile walk to the end of the bathroom.When he turns to look at me, I look down at my fingers, embarrassed.Ella?he raises my chin and I look into his beautiful emerald green eyes.Are you okay?he asks softly, his thumb tracing my lower lip.I guess.I shrug.I need to know, Els, are you okay, baby?No.I answer, because it is in fact, the truth.Oh, Ellie.He groans and pulls me close.I meant it, I have fallen in love with you.I search his eyes and he searches mine.We have seriously, royally fucked ourselves over.This is fucked up.I whisper.I know, we will figure it out, Ellie, I promise.I trust you.I smile softly at him and he gently kisses my lips.He puts his hands under my rear and lifts me up.I squeal and giggle and he laughs.He sounds beautiful.He takes me to the far end of the room where the shower is enclosed in a glass house.He gently places me in and I pout.Are you not getting in?I smile.Of course, baby.He smirks.He stumbles in behind me and I look at the dials to turn the shower on.Why are there like, five dials for a shower?He walks over to the far wall, hovers his hand over a black dot, and instantly water begins to fall from the ceiling.The whole ceiling is the shower; its beautiful, like rain.Whoa.I gasp, and he walks over to me.Amazing, isnt it?Yes, its like its raining, but its warm.I giggle.His hands cup my cheeks and he kisses me.Body wash and shampoo are over there.He points with his chin to the far left corner, where there is a shelving unit of all sorts of products.I wander over and try find a floral smelling one.I move a shower gel and behind it is a girls one.Its pink, with flowers on the bottle.I pick it up and turn to face him.I put my hand on my hip and try my hardest to look cute.Is this yours?I laugh.He bows his head and looks back at me.No, that was Jennas.He sighs.Oh for fucks sake.I turn and put it back.I was not expecting that.Did Jenna live here?He looks at me with a look of horror on his face, which instantly changes to a frown as he strides towards me.He bends down to my ear and breathes in.No.She didnt.Then, why is her shower gel here?I don't know.He shrugs.Youre a shit liar.I mumble.Don't curse at me, Ella!He groans.Listen, we need to have a chat about everything, how are you feeling?Are you feeling sore?How inappropriate.Yes.I sigh.Come on, lets shower.He holds out his hand to me and pulls me close.Kissing in the rain.Twelve      He leaves the shower, and before I can even think about my actions, Im holding onto Jennas shower gel and squeezing every last drop down the drain.I drop it, satisfied, and exit the glass room.Its now technically a sauna.I have no fucking idea how to turn it off.I wrap myself in a warm, fluffy, white towel, and quickly towel dry my hair.I pad into the bedroom and Luke is nowhere to be seen.On the bed is my outfit from yesterday; folded neatly with a pair of shoes Ive never seen before.Theyre not mine.I look inside and the tag is still firmly attached.A brand new pair of pink Vans, just for me.I smile but feel guilty.I dont want him buying me things.Even the size is right.I dont have any clean underwear, shit.I open Lukes top drawer and he has several pairs of Calvin Klein boxer shorts and neatly folded socks.Jeez.I pull out a pair and a small jewelry box falls to the floor.I slide on the boxers and leave the box on the floor.I really dont want to know whom that was intended for.I find my bra under the bed, slip it on, and my vest top and jeans follow suit.I slip on my new Vans, satisfied when they fit me.I walk over to his full length mirror and look at myself.I really dont know how I feel.Pleased?Angry?I really dont know.Im distracted when my cell starts buzzing on the bedside table.Its an unknown caller.Hello?Ella...Yes?Who is this?Jenna.She sighs.Listen, Ella, you need to leave.What?No, I dont.How did you get my number?Ella, Luke doesnt love you, it was all a high school ploy, a bet, to see if he could get your fat ass into bed.She spits at me.Youre a fucking liar.I breathe and she laughs hysterically down the phone.No, Im not.Youre the liar.Youre lying to yourself, girl.Jenna, why are you saying these things?It cant be true.Because I can.she whispers.What?You just expect me to believe you?I sigh.Ella, has he taken you yet?Has he told you he loves you?Taken you to the baseball field?Bought you a gift?I start to shake uncontrollably just as Luke enters the room.Ella, are you okay?He walks over to me and cups my face.Ask the bitch.I mumble and shove my cell into his hands.Ella...what?Hello?Jenna, what the fuck?I grab my bag and run down the stairs and towards the foyer doors.How the fuck do I get out?I try the door and its locked.I really dont want to be made a fool of.I stride over to the other side of the room, open the balcony doors, and step out.Shit, its cold today.I close the doors behind me quietly and fall to the floor.Im really fucking fed up of crying.Dry cries heave my body but I just cant cry anymore.I take my iPod out of my bag and shove the headphones in my ears.Coldplays The Scientist plays and I breathe slowly to the music.I stand and shuffle closer to the edge.Shit, this is high.I look over and notice Lukes car driving away.Oh, Fuck.I mumble.He cant be going after me.He didnt even look.He cant have, Ive only been here a few minutes.I turn, open the balcony doors, and wander back in.Im grateful for the heat, as Im shivering from the cold.I make my way to the kitchen and sit on a stool.Coldplay sing to me.Nobody said it was easy.I help myself to some of Lucky Charms after searching for a bowl for too long.I found my cell on the kitchen counter.I flick through my phone, looking at the recent photos Ive taken.There is one of Holly and me.I really need to get that framed.There is one of Luke, hes sticking his tongue out at the camera and he looks carefree.I didnt take this.He must have done it last night.I smile but a single inconvenient tear falls down my cheek.I rub it away and snap my phone shut.I hear a loud crash and voices screaming at each other.Luke, get off me!No, you brought this on yourself, Jenna.I instantly jump off the stool and run in the opposite direction to the voices.He's brought Jenna here.Shit.I try each door to my right, and none open but one.I open it and lock it from the other side.Its a bathroom.I sigh and listen intently to the door.ELLA!Luke screams and I hear him trying each door as I did.I back away.When he tries the handle on the bathroom, I hold my breath and he knocks gently.Ella, baby, I know youre in there.Go away.I whisper.Ella, Im not breaking another fucking door down!Let me in.I sigh and unlock the door, against every instinct in my body.His arms are on the doorframe above his head.He looks down at me and sighs.I didnt know where you were.He grumbles.I was on the balcony.Why?Its freezing outside.I needed to think clearly.Why?His green eyes look sad, worried.Because everything becomes hazy around you, Luke.Jenna...she said...well, you probably know what she said.I know shes here.Shes in the dining room.He whispers.Why?I want her to apologize.He drops his arms and shrugs.I dont want her apology, she wants you.I say, breathlessly.Thats a shame, because I want you.His tone is matter of fact.Luke, you kissed her yesterday.I shake my head with irritancy.I thought we sorted all that?I told you, Ella, it was a goodbye, but here she is trying her hardest to break us up.How did you get her here?I murmur.I asked her to come here to collect her stuff on the phone, she agreed, and I went to pick her up.It was a little ploy.He grins and I cant help but smile back.He gently holds my arm and pulls me into a cuddle.His arms fully wrap around my body now and I am cocooned in a Luke fortress.He gently pulls me away, and brushes my lips with his.Just you, Ella, I promise.He gently places a stray lock of hair behind my ear.We walk hand in hand toward the dining room, toward a girl who has always made my life hell.What the fuck is she doing here?I wince at her violence and Luke pulls me harder into his side.Jenna, Ella is my girlfriend.Luke grits his teeth and holds my hand tighter.I was your girlfriend last week, do you just pick and choose?Luke laughs uncontrollably.I look up at him, my eyebrow cocked and he smiles down at me.No, Jenna, Ella and I are together, me and you, well, we were just a mistake.How can you say that, Luke?What about us?Our time together?Did I mean nothing?Luke instantly drops my hand and steps toward Jenna.Oh, what?Of course you didnt, Jenna, you know how it was for me.Then why break me?I watch in agonizing fear and loss as Luke holds his ex girlfriend in an embrace.Her head appears over his shoulder and she smiles at me.His arms cocoon her, just like he was doing to me, and his head buries into her long blonde hair.I feel myself back up, and as my back hits a stool at the breakfast bar, Luke lets go of Jenna.He turns to look at me and all the color drains his beautiful face.I just cant witness this.Ella, noplease  he looks ashen and I cant be here right now, I cant see him.No, see you later.I grab my bag from the kitchen counter.Ella, please let me take you home and not like this.He grabs my arm and I pull it back.Fuck off, Luke.I growl.ELLA, PLEASE!Dont curse at me.Ill just leave you to attend to your ex then, maybe when you are ready, lets say in two weeks, we can call it a day.Then nobody needs to hurt anymore.Let me take you home.He asks, meekly.Hes desperate to touch me; I can see it in his eyes.No, Ill get a bus or call my dad.I need to calm down.Ella, please, youre being unreasonable again.Please, let me take you home.He walks over to me and I can barely contain my anxiety, my urge to do things unbidden.No Ella, please dont, youll regret it, it will take over your life...again.I have an urge right now, Luke.I need to go control it.What do you mean an urge?No, not here Luke, remember what I told you goddamn it.You're so obtuse.See you, Jenna, enjoy his company.Im sure I will Smella!She grins, Luke looks back at her, and it instantly disappears.I sigh deeply and cup his face in my hands.Youll know what you want soon, and when you decide, come to me tonight.Okay.He whispers and I gently kiss him.Bye.Bye, Ellie.I release his face and walk over to the foyer door.To my surprise it unlocks and I step out to walk my long trip home.******    I slump on my bed, my headphones snuggled in my ears, My Chemical Romance sing about not being okay.Yes, thats right, I am not okay.He is the love of my life, I know that for sure.I just dont know what he wants from me.Does he want me?Last night I lost my virginity to a high school jock, someone who I only really started to speak to a week ago.He took me and made love to me, we even had angry sex.Mmmm, angry sex was good.His body haunts me.The rain and his toned, tight muscles tight under his t shirt, feeling his skin on top of mine.The biting, the kissing, the passion.If lovemaking is always like that then I will never feel the need to say no, but only with Luke.College will be hard and Im petrified that this is goodbye.Right now, all Im thinking about is touching him when hes doing God knows what with her.Thirteen      I awake to a knock on my bedroom door.Ella?Its mom.I reach up my arm to indicate she can come in and she sits on the end of my bed.I sit up and she straightens her dress.Hey, baby.She whispers.Listen, your dad has told me youre seeing Luke James.Is this true?Yeah, well sort of.Tell me, angel, I want you to talk to me about this stuff, your sister does, and you just keep yourself locked away.I want to know if youre happy.She smiles at me and nods gently.Mom, I cant tell you about this stuff, its personal.Ella, you fail to forget at what age I met your father.We were only twenty one, he was my first.Ergh, Mom!Gross!I laugh and throw a pillow at her.Please, Ella, talk to me.She pleads.Okay, I can talk to my mom, right?Whats she going to do?I slept with him.I blurt out and she backs off but gently smiles at me.Okay, how was it?Amazing, we have this connection, Ive never felt it before.Its like we were meant to be but we cant be, and thats what is going to break us.Mom, hes going to Princeton.Oh, shit  She whispers.Mom!No cursing!I laugh and she laughs with me.Ella, you are a grown up now.Eighteen is considered an adult.High school is over, you have prom to look forward to.If you and Luke are falling for each other, at least you have the summer together right?Wrong, he leaves in two weeks.Im trying my hardest to hold back my tears, a lump tightening and forming in my throat.Ella, baby, I can see you care for him, hell, maybe even love him.You know me; love makes the world go around in my eyes.You have two weeks together.Enjoy those and maybe after, who knows?She smiles at me and I reach out my arms so I can have a mom hug.Thanks, Mom.I whisper and she gently releases me.I have some rules, Ella.Luke is downstairs and this is why I wanted to know how you felt.He can stay in here, if thats what you wanted to do, but not in your bed.She scowls at me and I nod.Okay.Is he really here?Yeah, and hes waiting for you.To do what?I dont know, Ella, just put some clothes on and go say hi.I scramble up out of bed and find my jeans.I pull them on and slip on my Metallica t shirt.I go check myself in my bathroom mirror and sort my hair out.Ive put it in a center parting and it falls in soft waves down my shoulders.I actually look okay.As I reach the second landing, hes standing there at the bottom of the stairs looking at his feet with a bouquet of lilies in his hand.I stop and just look at him over the banister for a second.He looks amazing.Im feeling lucky right now, I feel like Ive found something I can never let go.He looks up and spots me, puts the lilies on table, and runs up the stairs two at a time.He walks towards me.He kisses me softly, my mouth surrendering to his.I make sure my parents are out of sight then groan under his kiss as he bites my bottom lip, hard.His kisses and soft little bites move down my neck and follows his path back up again.He bites down harder when he reaches my shoulder.Oh, God.The sexual desire is on fire.I want him right now on my landing.I missed you.He mutters between kisses.He pulls away gently and kisses my forehead.What are you doing to me, Ella, Jesus.I missed you too.I whisper and he smiles at me.We sit around my parents dinner table, Luke cautiously doing small touches to my thigh and knees.I smirk under his touch and he knows he's affecting me.So...Luke, do you work for your father?My dads gently picking up pasta with his fork and looking friendly at Luke.Yes sir, have done so since I was sixteen.Wow, young worker huh?He smiles at Luke and he gives him a satisfactory nod.Listen, Els  my mom smiles at me.We are going out to England next week, your granny insisted.You can come if youd like, you too, Luke.She looks over to Luke and I turn to face him.You want to come?I smile at him and tilt my head.His eyes meet mine and he smiles back.Sure, how long for, Mrs.Stone?Just a few days.You can see where Ella was born.My mom says, heftily putting more potatoes on her plate.Youre British?He looks at me, his brow raised.Um...yeah.Well, I was born in England; my moms family is British.Oh, makes sense, you have a mixed accent, Mrs.Stone.Please, Luke, call me Amanda.I smile at my moms name, and she winks at him.Should be fun.Holly laughs.Lets just hope Alex isnt about.I drop my fork against my plate and shoot her a warning look.Shit!Fucking shit!Lukes grasp on my knee becomes hard and I know he is angry with me.Later.I whisper and look back over at Holly.Youre dead.I mouth and she laughs.******    Luke gently closes my bedroom door behind him and slumps his back against it, his arms crossed over his chest.Alex, huh?Luke raises one eyebrow at me and I sigh with exasperation.He was a summer boyfriend, okay?It was like three years ago.He was there for me, we were just being teenagers.Like, me and you?He points to me and back to him to mimic his words.No, Luke, not like me and you.I repeat his gesture, and sit on the end of my bed.I didnt love him.I whisper and he pushes away from the door.He crouches down and puts his hands on my knees.Im joking baby, I just want to get jealous over you.How about I go kiss someone else?I dont know, maybe Jenna?Low blow.He sighs.I know, Im sorry, tell me what happened today.You came to me so Im guessing that you want me.I wink at him and he moves so he is sitting next to me.He pushes my hair past my right shoulder and kisses my neck gently.I tremble against his lips, and he pulls away.Jenna was very angry after you left.I tried to calm her down, tell her that her and I are nothing and we never were, because we weren't, Els, we arent.She told me about what she said on the phone, it was just her being manipulative and jealous.I told her about the things I had done for you because I thought I could trust her.I never did those things for anyone but you.He sighs and looks at his knotted fingers.She is very jealous.I guess its because I fell for you instantly where I never really felt anything for her.Shes heartbroken, Ellie.I broke her heart.Hey  I whisper and turn his chin, so as he meets my gaze.Dont feel guilty because someone fell in love with you, I feel sorry for her because if it were me, well, I think Id probably break too.He runs his cool fingers across my cheek and into my hair.I close my eyes and welcome his hand.He traces his fingers across my eyebrows and down across my mouth.I love you.He whispers and I open my eyes.He loves me.Forever and always, Ellie.I smile and gently part my lips.He leans in and kisses me gently, soft, long kisses.I would die if I couldnt ever see those beautiful blue eyes again.Id die if I could never see you again.I murmur under his lips.Its going to hurt so badly.Isnt it, Luke?I pull away gently, his hand still resting on my face.It will break us, Ellie, but we need to live today, and tomorrow, and not worry about what is going to happen, because the inevitable will catch up with us, it will haunt us, but we can make it work baby, we can.I promise.His thumb gently skims my bottom lip and I catch it and kiss it softly.Forever and always.I whisper.Fourteen      My dream woke me up and Im sitting awake, getting frustrated trying to remember what it was about.Its dark but I can make out the ceiling.Luke is asleep on the floor next to me; I couldnt break my moms rule when she trusts me so much right now.I watch faintly in the darkness as his lungs breathe in and out and his body responds with their movements.I pull the covers off and swing my legs around to the edge of the bed.I gently walk the short distance to Luke and his blow up bed.I kneel beside him and kiss his cheek.He stirs gently and turns onto his front.His phone vibrates, causing me to hold my breath.He moans and pushes the phone out from under his pillow and onto my hardwood floor.I let out a quiet breath and breathe in deeply.I grab his phone, nervous to who could be texting him at this time, and unlock it.I see Jennas name and put the phone back on the floor.It starts vibrating again, but this time it doesnt stop.I gently stand and walk back over to my bed and lay down quietly.Luke picks up his phone and answers it, because its so quiet, I can hear the whole conversation.Hello?He mumbles sleepily.Where the fuck are you, Luke?Jenna?Yeah, where are you?At Ellas, why?What the fuck are you doing there?You cant say what you said tonight and go back to her, what did you mean?Jenna, what are you talking about?I hold my breath and close my eyes.You are such a bull shitter.I guess youre talking in code because shes there.Fucking coward.Whoa, wait a second there, Jenna.I have no freaking idea what youre talking about.We sorted everything earlier today, thats the last of it.What was with the text then?What text?He sighs.You texted me saying sorry, that you missed me, and that youll meet me at half past one at the park.No, I didnt.I never texted you, Jenna.Yes, you fucking did!Check your damn phone, you dick.Oh Christ, give me five minutes and Ill call you back.I watch as Luke sits up and checks his phone.'What the fuck. 'He whispers and looks over at me.He gets up, walks over to my bathroom, his phone now at his ear, and gently closes the door.The light switches on and illuminates my room slightly.I can hear mumbling but its too vague to understand.I really wish my bathroom wasn't so far away.I sigh and groan into my hands.After what feels like an eternity, Luke stumbles out of the bathroom and I pretend to be asleep.I am on my side and I watch as he struggles to pull on his clothes.When hes dressed, he comes over to me and I squint my eyes shut.He hovers over my cheek, gently kisses it and whispers Im so sorry, Ellie.With that, he leaves, and I sit up dazed by what just happened.******    I don't know how I got here, but Im here.Im sitting in my sisters car, which I followed Luke in.Hes come to the park Jenna mentioned and Im breathing too harshly, battling with myself.Why have I come here?I duck slightly when I see Luke come into view.I think I feel a bullet to my heart when Jenna comes into my line of vision.Her hand is in his, locked, tight.My fucking God, that hurts.Id rather someone chewed my heart up and stomped on it.They walk hand in hand down the street away from me, toward his car.I cant help it, but an unexpected harsh lump forms in my throat, begging me for release, but I cant feel.When he starts his car, I let him drive away in front of me before I start to follow.I turn on the ignition with trembling fingers and sigh as I pull away.I follow them for a few miles, keeping my distance so they didnt think they were being followed.We were heading for downtown Charlotte so it was then I knew he was taking her to his penthouse.Dawn was approaching and I couldnt breathe anymore.I watched as he turned into the parking duplex and saw the gate close behind them.I pulled up across the street and wept.My body was afraid of pain; I had made it feel that way.I had messed it up.I really wanted to hurt right now.These tears are useless.They wont remind me of what happened.******    The orange and yellow light woke me and I squinted at its brightness.I had fallen asleep in the car, my body turned on its side facing the passenger window.I slowly sat up and stretched my arms up.I open Hollys glove box and search her CDs for something angry to listen to.I sigh when I find Bon Jovis greatest hits and smile at the memories this CD had brought on family holidays.I gently pushed it into the CD slot and You Give Love a Bad Name plays quite coincidently through the car.I start the ignition and drive home, not knowing why Jenna and Luke were holding hands, and not having the confidence to ask him about it.The drive home is long and boring.I cant do this with him lying to me.I need to see Jade.I stop in a deserted parking lot and pick up my cell.It rings once before she answers.Morning.She sings and I can feel her smile.Morning, I reply with no smile in my voice.Ella, whats wrong babe?Luke.I whisper.Can I come see you?Im not far from you and I need you to drive my car back for me.Sure, see you soon.I snap my cell shut and it immediately rings again.The caller ID would normally make my heart melt, but right now, its making it burn.Hello.I whisper.Ellie.He says firmly.I need to tell you something.Let me save you the fucking bother, you and Jenna are back together, shes in your apartment right now, and you left me in the middle of the freaking night for her.How about you tell me nothing.Dont phone me; dont even try come to my house, and sure as hell, you arent coming to England with us next week.Forever and always, my fucking ass.With that, I snap the phone shut, and burst into tears.Forever and fucking always.
