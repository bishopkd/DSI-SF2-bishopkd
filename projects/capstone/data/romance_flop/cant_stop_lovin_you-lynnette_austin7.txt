And I cant tell you how much I appreciate this.Ive been obsessing over the second cup I didnt have.You really dont need to do this every day, though.Sure I do.I like you.Be careful.I could get used to it.Youd better.After your show, everybody will be scrambling for your work and your attention.Your designs are spectacular, Maggie.You like them?Like?No.Love?Oh, yes!Wait till you see what weve done.I cant wait.Maggie stopped by her office to put down her purse and briefcase.Did the red silk come in?Late yesterday afternoon.Ooh, boy, thats cutting it close.Tell me about it, Zandra said.Did you get settled in?My suitcases are piled in the middle of the bedroom.Thats as far as I got.Id probably have starved if you hadnt taken pity on me and stocked my pantry and fridge.Again, I owe you a huge thanks.I cant tell you how much I appreciated it.I wasnt sure what youd want, so I stuck with things Id seen you eat when you were here before.Smart lady.And drop dead gorgeous, Maggie thought.Zandra, with her slim, six foot body, exotic brown eyes, and long black hair, put every model Maggie had met to shame.Today she looked edgy in her black leather pants and jacket.A red top peeked from the jacket, highlighting her smooth caff au lait skin.They stepped into the workroom, and Maggies heart stopped.Id ask what you think, but the look on your face says it all.Absently, Maggie set her coffee on a table.Large windows took up the better part of two walls and early morning sun spilled over swaths of fabric, patterns, and completed outfits.Without a word, she wandered through the maze of workstations, fingering cotton, silk, and linen.She adjusted a collar, studied buttons and zippers.This had to be nearly as exciting as giving birth, in a way.Shed created all this.Standing in the center of the room, she took it in, her smile spreading.I know I cant, but oh, how I want to pull out my camera or phone and take pictures.Maggie wrapped her arms around herself.Pretty spectacular.Zandra spoke from the doorway.You see any problems?The hem on the dark brown dress needs to be shortened.I want different buttons on the black and white blazer.Her head whirled with ideas.Alterations.Excitement.Zandra was right.The collection was pretty darn spectacular.All in all, Maggie said, Im thrilled.A couple of the seamstresses shed met on her last two trips wandered in, and the workday began.Knee deep in pleated organza, Maggie recognized the tap of Zandras heels as she crossed the hardwood floor.Around a mouthful of straight pins, she said, Please dont tell me we have any wrinkles in our plans.No wrinkles, her assistant assured her.You have company.Company?Her mind flew to Brawley.Stupid.Owen had already been by and left a happy man.So who was here now?From where she knelt on the floor in front of her dress form, Maggie looked up into one of the strongest faces shed ever seen.Dark, thick brows highlighted deep set, intense black eyes.A strong, straight nose over full lips.A heavy stubble of black over his cheeks and jaw.She was staring but darned if she could stop.She jabbed the pins into her wristband and stood, extending her hand.Hi.Im Maggie Sullivan.He took her hand, raised it to his lips, and kissed the back of it.Youre quite beautiful.That red hair and green eyes.A magnificent combination.His gaze moved slowly over the curves of her body, and she felt herself flush.Zandra cleared her throat.Maggie, this is Jarvis Quillen.Hes your photographer.Jarvis, its great to finally meet you.Ive heard over and over how fortunate I am youve agreed to work with me.How could I refuse?Maggie laughed.Right.Lets see.She tapped a finger on her chin.Im a brand new unknown, have no credentials, and no track record.Hmmm.Owen Cook never backs anything but stars.The fact he brought you to the city is enough for me.Jarvis put a hand into the pocket of his black designer jeans.Ive got a shoot this afternoon, but I wanted to stop by and meet you.He tilted his head and narrowed his eyes.Listen, Id like to talk about your collection.Get an idea what you have in mind for your photos.Are you free tonight?Yes, actually I am.I just arrived yesterday so my calendar is pretty open.In fact, nonexistent best describes my commitmentsoutside of work.Zandra, give Maggie directions to Gotham Bar and Grill.Why dont we meet there at, say, eight?Will that work for you?Absolutely.What should I wear?His eyes moved over her again.Exactly what you have on.Its perfect.One of your own?She nodded.I like it.She watched him stride away, noticed the confidence, the self assurance.This man had a big personality.He took up a lot of space simply by walking into a room.Zandra started back to the office.Ill write down the restaurants address for you, she threw over her shoulder.Take a cab.And Jarvis is right.Dont change.That outfit really is perfect.She stopped.What?Hes pretty spectacular, isnt he?Zandra asked.The two shared a womans smile.Yeah, he is that, Maggie agreed.But tonights strictly business.Tell yourself whatever works.Brawley scratched his head.What the hell was he gonna do with this thing?Phyllis, he called.She stuck her head in the door.Yeah?Know anybody looking for a dog?As in to take home and keep?She eyed the filthy animal stretched out on the exam table.He sure has made himself at home, hasnt he?The dog yawned and dropped his head onto his front paws.Id say so.Brawley ran a hand over his chin.Cashs sister dropped him off while you were at the post office.Somebody abandoned him?Seems so.Why didnt Babs keep him or take him out to her brothers place?Id think Cash could always find room for a dog at the ranch.She wanted him checked out first.Nothing wrong with that one, Phyllis said, that a good bath wont take care of.Give Cash a call yourself.Already did.He reminded me hes got Staubach.Says hes enough for anyone.He doesnt want another dog, especially not a sissy one.His words.Phyllis laughed.What?He thinks it would emasculate him to have a fluffy little ball of fur following him around?Brawley took another look at the dog.Cant say Id argue with that.Cashs real concern is that hed get in the barn and end up under one of the horses hooves.Or spook one of them and both dog and horse would get hurt.Cant blame him.I sure as hell would never own a dog like this.The dog in question took that moment to crawl to the tables edge and lick Brawleys hand.Not gonna work, boy.Not enough sugar coating in the world.The dog stared up at him with huge brown eyes.He loves you already, his assistant said.Bull.He thinks Im an easy mark.He turned back to the dog.Im not.The dog licked him again, his stubby tail wagging.Call Dawn Marie.Maybe shell take him or know somebody whos looking for one.She was my first call.I tried to guilt her into taking him, but no go.Good luck, Doc.Phyllis started to close the door.Ill have to put him to sleep.His assistant slapped a hand on the door and held it open.You wouldnt.I cant keep every animal that gets dragged in here.No, I guess you cant.But last time I counted, you had exactly zero pets of your own.And thats the way it has to be right now.Im renting.So?Didnt you talk Sophie into keeping Lilybelle?Seems to me she was renting the very same apartment youre in.Phyllis narrowed her eyes.Call Dottie.Shell tell you to bring him home.No.No way.If I get a dog, its gonna be a mans dog, not this six inch tall, five pound runt.The dog whined.Oh, see?Phyllis walked back into the room and ran a hand over the dogs head.Did he hurt your feelings?Mean old Doctor Odell.Youre a good boy, arent you?The little tail wagged so hard the ball of fur almost vibrated off the table.Hes an ankle biter, Brawley groused.A Yorkie, she corrected.Dont see many of them here in Maverick Junction.Theyre more of a city dog.Yeah, theyre good for apartments.There you go.Isnt that what I just said?He rolled his eyes.Dont you have something you need to do?Yes, and I was doing it until my boss called me in here to look at this sweet thing.The sweet thing yapped and blinked, tail still going a mile a minute.The door swung shut behind her, and Brawley leaned against the exam table.What are we gonna do with you, huh?Maybe Ill call Dawn and see if shell at least give you a bath and a new haircut.But, I promise, Boy Scouts honor, no bows or ribbons.We guys have to stick together.Once we get you cleaned up, people will fall over each other to take you home.He scratched the dogs head.Yes, they will.Maggie groaned when she caught sight of the clock.Too late to run home and change so she would, indeed, be wearing what she had on.Thank God shed chosen a day to evening dress this morning.She trusted Zandras word that it would be fine, but a shower would have been nice.Needing a little time alone with her collection, shed sent Zandra and the other workers home an hour ago.She freshened up her makeup, then spied a bolt of blue fabric.Exactly what the doctor ordered.Crossing to it, she cut off a length, then sat down at one of the sewing machines and whipped up a scarf.It added a little extra pizzazz to her outfit.She turned off the lights, but, instead of leaving, she moved to the large windows.Incredible.Not quite dark, streetlights were just flickering to life.Some windows in the buildings around her still glowed with lights, people working late like herself.Others were dark.But down below, traffic streamed by in a steady pace.Stoplights shone red and green, making her think of Christmas.If possible, the street was even busier than when shed arrived this morning.She swiveled on her heel.Dress forms scattered around the room sported her creations.Some had been finished, some nearly, others in the midst of major reconstruction.Every single one carried a Maggie label.Had she ever been this excited?This terrified?And shed be late if she didnt leave right this minute.She grabbed her purse and briefcase, then set the security system.When she stepped outside the building, the chill in the air surprised her and made her glad her dress had sleeves.A taxi barreled down the street toward her.She held up her hand, and it actually stopped.Grinning, she hopped into the back seat and gave the driver the restaurants address.Her phone pinged.Uh oh.Had Jarvis canceled?She brought up the message.It was from Brawley.Want a dog?Nope.The next message was a photo.Hes been abandoned.She smiled at the little dog in the big mans arms.He looks good right where he is.Youd love him.He was right.She would.And hadnt she been thinking a pet would be good company?Hes in TX, Im in NY.Ill hand deliver.Her breath caught.Would he actually come to New York?She gave herself a mental head slap.Nope.Not going there.The old Fool me once, shame on you.Fool me twice, shame on me ran through her head.She was nobodys fool.2 busy for a pet, she typed.Brawleys next message hit hard.Four simple words.Can we be friends?She closed her eyes.Thered been a time when that was a given.Theyd been so close, known each others thoughts without any need for words.She texted him back.Dont think so.She hit send and experienced a jolt of pain.Without giving herself time for second thoughts, she tucked her phone in the side pocket of her purse.If he answered, shed ignore it.Tonight she was taking one more step toward the beginning of her new life.It had been one hell of a day.Sprawled across his bed, Brawley dug his phone out of his pocket and stared again at Maggies message.She was a tough one to figure out.Thisso cold.Yet the night of her grandfathers wedding shed been almost too hot to touch.That dance theyd shared in the front yard had been a little slice of heaven.Shed let down her guard.Forgotten to be all bristly and standoffish.What was she doing tonight?It didnt really matter, did it?He scrolled through his texts and found the picture of her outside her new brownstone.Sighing, he turned off the phone and tossed it onto the bed beside him.He rolled over and caught sight of the picture hed taken at the wedding.Maggie, her head thrown back in laughter.Those green eyes shining with happiness.Grabbing it, he turned it facedown.He didnt want to look at it anymore.Jamming a pillow under his head, he curled into it and fell asleep fully dressed, the stupid little dog curled up beside him, snoring.Nineteen  Standing in front of Gothams bathroom mirror, Maggie chewed herself out.She should never have come out with Jarvis.Huge mistake.When hed asked her, though, shed jumped at the chance.He would be the photographer for her new line.The stronger their connection, the better his work.Right?She worried her bottom lip.It would have been unprofessional not to have come.How could she figure out the correct etiquette in these situations?In Maverick Junction, she understood the rules.Knew how the game was played.But here?A fish out of water.While a part of her found it unbelievably thrilling to sit in this elegant restaurant across the table from a veritable stranger who looked like something straight out of a girls bad boy fantasies, she also found it unsettling.Theyd discussed work, her upcoming show, and his ideas about the photography side of it.Shed shared her plans for the future, and hed told her about his own.His struggle to get where he was.And right now, he had to be wondering if shed dropped off the face of the earth.Hands wrapped around the edge of the sink, Maggie leaned closer to the mirror and stared into her own eyes, reminded herself this was exactly what shed worked so hard to achieve.She was suffering a case of adult homesickness tonight.Period.Reaching into her purse, she pulled out her lipstick and flicked it across her lips.So why did she wish it was Brawley waiting for her?Damn!Why couldnt he have waited another couple months to return home?Shed have been gone and wouldnt have missed what shed never had.Except she had had him.Once upon a time, long, long ago.She shook her head.She had an exciting new life.And part of that newness sat at a white cloth covered table twiddling his thumbs waiting for her.She exhaled sharply.Everything would be fine.Better than fine.A smile on her face, she left her temporary refuge.Jarvis stood as she approached, an expression of relief on his handsome face.Youre incredibly beautiful, Maggie.He held her chair for her.Id love to shoot you sometime.Her smile broadened.Im assuming thats with a camera.Of course.Back in Texas, when you talk about shooting somethingWell, enough said, huh?Rather than answer, he took her hand in his and kissed the back of it.Would you like dessert?Another coffee?She patted her tummy.No, thanks.She took in the ambience.This was wonderful, Jarvis.Back in my small hometown, we have two restaurants, three if you count Ollies in Lone Tree.Believe me, theyre nothing like this.Would I like it there?She tilted her head, gave it some thought.You know, I think you mightfor a short time.Then youd miss the cosmopolitan scene.Maverick Junction is really in the boonies.And you love it, dont you?Yes.I do.But this?She held out a hand.I love this, too.I confess its going to take a while to get used to all the people, the noise, the nonstop of it all.Do you miss your family?Id be a liar if I said no.My parents, my grandfather, my friends.Yes, I miss them.But its only been a day since I left.I dont have my sea legs under me yet.She smiled.Besides, theyre all flying in for my show.Really?She nodded.You can meet them then.And my friends Annelise and Sophie have both agreed to walk the runway for me.Annelise.Jarviss forehead creased in thought.Is that Annelise Montjoy?Hardeman now, but yes.She started this whole crazy ride when she wore one of my designs to a fund raiser in Dallas.An incredible gown.You saw it?The world saw it, Maggie, and was brought to its knees.She blushed.I think thats a total exaggeration, but thank you.Jarvis shook his head.Its not.Those pictures popped up and had everybody asking the same question.Who is Maggie Sullivan, and how can I get my hands on her and her designs?She laughed.Jarvis was easy to talk to.Besides family and friends, anything else you miss back home?She frowned.Anything else?He chuckled.My attempt at subtle.Ill go for blunt.Do you have a guy back home?Someone waiting for you?Duh.She raised a hand to her forehead and rolled her eyes.Sorry.I dont get out much.She shook her head and another wave of melancholy washed over her.No.No one at home.Her heart pinched as she remembered Brawleys parting kiss.Good to know.But I have to wonder then, what the hell is wrong with the men in Maverick Junction?Excuse me?Why arent they swarming around you?Are they all blind?She grinned.Hardly.Ive been pretty busy.Still.It makes no sense to me that a woman like you doesnt have half a dozen men chasing her.The waiter returned with Jarviss credit card.He signed the charge slip and slid his AmEx into his wallet.Ready?Yes.Thanks for dinner.Youre very welcome.He stood, then came around the table to slide her chair back for her.He took her hand as they walked together from the restaurant.After they hailed a taxi, she slid across the seat, and Jarvis got in, moving across till their hips touched.Resting his arm on the back of the seat, he gave the driver her address.As they pulled away from the curb, he wrapped an arm tightly around her, and Maggie found herself uneasy again.She wasnt sophisticated enough for this man.Yet she felt totally at ease with Brawley.She had no problem telling him exactly how she felt, good or bad.And Brawley could match this urbanite step for step in social graces.In Dallas, hed mixed very easily with the citys elite.Still, he was Brawley.Jarvis broke into her thoughts.I had a nice time tonight.Me, too.Both remained quiet as the taxi fought its way through the still heavy traffic, wending street by street to her new apartment.Before Maggie realized exactly where they were, the cab pulled over to the curb.Were here already?Jarvis nodded and asked the cabbie to wait.Opening the door, he got out, then reached in to help her.Maggies tongue shot out to lick suddenly dry lips.She had no idea what to expect.Stupid.Jarvis was a colleague, someone she worked with.Tonight had been business.She turned to him.Thanks so His lips came down on hers.Surprised, Maggie opened her mouth to protest.Jarvis took advantage and slid his tongue inside.Her mind reeled.Jarviss kiss was pleasant.Very skilled.And she felt nothing.His kiss didnt set her on fire the way Brawleys did.She didnt find herself wanting more.Wanting to tear this mans clothes off and take.Jarvis lifted his head and studied her.Should I apologize?What?No!Of course not.Its justI didnt expect that.Really?Id think that even in Maverick Junction, Texas, a nice meal out, a beautiful woman, a red blooded man, the moonlight He pointed to where it peeped out behind a cloud.Seems to me the evening would end like this or with the woman asking that man in for a cocktail or another cup of coffee.He trailed off, and Maggie knew exactly what he hoped for.She might be small town, but she doubted even in the city every first date ended up with a roll in the hay or the boudoir as the case might be.Was Jarvis taking advantage of her vulnerability, or was he truly interested?She couldnt tell and that bothered her.If Brawley was here, hed punch the guys lights out for even suggesting it.But then she wouldnt be with Jarvis if Brawley was here, would she?And shed done it again.She had to quit inserting Brawley into every situation.Jarvis, she started, aware she needed to tread lightly.Theyd be working closely on this upcoming show.Right now isnt a good time.I think, at least until the show is over, we need to shy away from any personal relationship and keep things on a professional level.Nothing says we cant do both.Id prefer we didnt.An uneasy silence ensued.Finally, he nodded.Okay.I wont push.But when we put the show to bed, I intend to do the same to you.Oh, geez.Her breath caught.She couldnt think of a thing to say.He laughed softly.I believe Ive shocked you, Maggie Sullivan.Were not through, you and I.  We could be very good together.Looking over his shoulder at the taxi, he said, Run on in.Ill stay until I hear the lock snap into place.He kissed her lightly on the cheek.Go on now.His voice deepened.Pleasant dreams.Like a cowardly lion, she did exactly that.She hurried up the stairs, gave him one quick wave, and ducked inside, throwing the lock behind her.Upstairs, she let herself into her apartment, then simply collapsed against the door and closed her eyes.She stood there a good five minutes, trying to decide exactly what had happened.Kicking off her shoes, she dropped her purse onto a chair and flopped down on the sofa.She wouldnt have gone to bed with him tonight under any circumstances.She wasnt into sleeping around.Never had been.The apartment was too quiet.She turned on the stereo system and fussed with it till she found a country station.Dierks Bentley.Thinking of You.The same song she and Brawley had danced to at Bubbas.She grabbed a pillow off the sofa and threw it across the room.Damn it, damn it, damn it!She had to exorcise the man from her mind.He didnt belong there.Hed left her without any warning.Left her pregnant and hurting.Scared and heartbroken.And now he was screwing this up, too!Well, damned if shed let him.No siree.Time to go to bed.Tomorrow would be another long, busy day.As she started down the hallway, she heard her phone signal an incoming message.Digging it from her purse, she saw it was from none other than Brawley.Fine.Nothing said she had to read it.Shed hit delete and it would be gone.Just like that.Her traitorous finger, though, opened the message.Settling in okay?Not as well as I should be, she wanted to scream, because youre haunting me.Instead she typed, Does it really matter?His answer came quickly.Of course.Shouldnt u b asleep?Cant.Took a late nap.Wide awake now.What do u want, Brawley?Id start with being your friend again.Dont think thats possible.A long distance friendship, Red.What can it hurt?She sat cross legged on the bed, chewing her bottom lip to a bloody pulp.It cant hurt a thing, she typed.Because I have no feelings for u.   Yes, u do, came his response.U dont like me.Negative, true, but a feeling nonetheless.Good night, Brawley.She closed her phone and slid out of bed.Fifteen minutes later, face scrubbed, teeth brushed, and wearing her favorite pajamas, she turned out the light.Willed sleep to come.Refused to acknowledge the tear that slipped down her cheek and onto her pillow as the moon shone through her window, the same moon that shone on him in Texas.Twenty  Maggie had worked harder than shed ever worked in her life, her first full week in New York extremely productive.At this point, the list of to dos had whittled down to finish work on her garments, last minute decisions about presentation.And those things she had to do herself.It seemed strange today with only Zandra and herself at the studio.Shed sewed, ripped, and sewed some more until she swore her fingers bled.But when shed locked up tonight, shed been pleased.It was good.Opening the door to her apartment, she sighed and almost cried when she stepped out of the shoes shed loved only this morning.Right now, she didnt care if she ever saw them again.Shed had the forethought to turn on a lamp before shed left that morning, and now, in the twilight, its soft glow bathed the living room.Its warmth welcomed her home.After the steady stream of phone calls, the chatter of delivery boys, and the constant traffic and sirens, the apartment was blessedly silent except for the quiet humming of the refrigerator.It almost made her ears hurt.She needed to eat, but she needed to sit down even more badly.Sliding onto the sofa, she propped her feet on the coffee table and rested her head on the back of the couch.Shed give herself ten minutes, then shed get up, wash off her makeup, and start dinner.The ping of her phone woke her.She sat up, looked around, and wondered for two brief seconds where she was.The twilight outside her windows had faded to full fledged blackor as close to black as the city got.A quick glance at the wall clock told her the ten minute sit down had turned into almost an hours nap.Running her fingers through her hair, yawning hugely, she grabbed her phone.Brawley.Phone in hand, she headed for the kitchen and food.What had he sent her now?The photo of Jesse, Jonah, and Josh in those outrageous swim goggles, goofy smiles on their faces, had her laughing out loud.And the one of the sweet little dog.Ohhh.Shed loved to cover him in smooches and prayed Brawley found a good home for him.In the next second, her refrigerator door hanging open, homesickness hit, far worse than the one summer shed gone to camp.Shed fought with her parents for three years to go.Theyd finally given in, but once shed arrived, shed wanted nothing more than to be home.If her folks were surprised when she didnt bring up camp the following summer, they never said a word.And now?She was a big girl with a job to do.The homesickness would pass.She opened her text.No message.Just a photo of her and her parents at the wedding.Exactly what she needed.Tomorrow, shed get a copy made and set it by her bed.Why was Brawley being so nice?By Friday, Maggie needed a dose of normality and escaped for a quick lunch.She ate a hot dog from one of the street vendors as she walked the crowded streets.Eighty degrees and sunny.She felt like a kid playing hookywhich only added that touch of the forbidden to her enjoyment.On the way back to the workroom, she spied the ugliest stuffed dog shed ever seen in her life in a store window.She swore the manufacturer had used Staubach, Cashs lovable, but horrendously ugly mutt, for the model.His and Annies baby absolutely had to have it for the nursery.She ducked inside the shop.But if she sent a gift to Annie and Cashs unborn baby, shouldnt she send a package to Ty and Sophies boys?Aunts, even honorary ones, couldnt play favorites.So she stole another thirty minutes to scour the shops for just the right thing.She finally found it.Pint size New York firefighter helmets.The boys could wear them with the goggles when they did construction work.Shed have Zander pack them up todayalong with the little Yorkie figurine shed bought for Brawley.Annie had told her he still had the dog and that, even though he complained about it constantly, the Yorkie went to work with him and followed him everywhere.What she wouldnt give to see that!Brawley swerved into Sadlers Store.Cash and Ty were coming over tonight for a card game, so hed need to stock up on some cold ones.He cracked his window for the dog.Stay put, and keep quiet.The dog plopped his butt on the seat and gave Brawley a soulful look.Cut it out.You cant go with me.Brawley closed the door and started across the lot.A former teacher, long retired, stood beside her car with a full shopping cart.How about I load that for you, Mrs.Sandburg?Why, Brawley Odell, Id appreciate that.How are your mother and father?Theyre great, maam.And the clinic?I hear youve really spiffed up the place.Doc had a good business, but I figured it might be time for a few changes.She patted his cheek.Doc did a fine job with the animals.Last time I was in there, though, just before Bootsie passed, the place looked ready to cave in.Brawley chuckled.Hopefully thats not the case anymore.You hear from Maggie?Zing.The woman always did have a habit of tossing you a question you couldnt answer.Math, language arts, or relationships.She had it covered.Ive had a couple e mails.Shes doing well and working hard.Humph.That doesnt sound very personal.A blush, damn it, heated his face.Maggie and I are old friends, Mrs.Sandburg.She gave his shoulder a nudge.Go on now.You expect me to buy that?I used to see the two of you walking along Main Street or after the high school football game.Ive got eyes, boy, and there was a whole lot more than friendship between you.Brawley remembered all that, too.That was a long time ago.Understood.But when I heard you planned to move back, Id hoped there might still be a spark there.Shes not involved with anybody, you know.Got a notion shes been waiting for you.No, maam.And that hurt more than he cared to think about.He set the last bag in her trunk and closed it.There you go.You drive carefully.I always do.Thank you, Brawley.Youre very welcome.He opened her door for her, then tipped his hat and moved into the store, a far cry from the fancy deli hed shopped at in Dallas.And a lot more interesting.Sadlers sold everything from nuts to bolts to Stetsons and sirloin steak.If you needed it, youd find it hereor a damned good substitute.He made a face at the stuffed buffalo inside the door and gave his nose a minute to adjust to the mixed scent of leather and produce.Grabbing a cart, he headed to the cooler.On the way, he passed the chips and threw in a bag.At the freezer section, he tossed in a couple pizzas.Two six packs from the cooler joined them.Never knew if somebody else might show up, and it sure wouldnt do to run out of beer.His basket much fuller than hed intended, he wheeled it into Missy Iversons checkout lane.Hows that buntings wing doing, Missy?Almost healed.Davey and a couple of his friends are planning a bon voyage party for Tweety next week.Thats kids for you.Yeah.She held up crossed fingers.Im praying none of the neighborhood cats crash the party.He grimaced.That would be bad.He emptied his carts contents onto the conveyer belt.While Missy rang him up, his eye caught on one of the tabloids.Bored, he grabbed the scandal sheet off the rack and idly flipped through it.What the hell?He checked the cover, saw yesterdays date.Some of the blood returned to his brain.Maggie worked fast.He wanted to toss the sorry excuse for a news magazine to the floor and stomp on it.Instead, he added it to his groceries.You want that?Missy looked surprised.Thought Id, ah, put it in the waiting room.Give my patients owners something to read.Yeah, a lot of people like these things.Cant believe they actually think the dribble in them is true.You got that right.Woodenly, he paid for his groceries, picked up the bags and the beer, and left.Once inside his SUV, he fed Marvin a couple doggie biscuits, then pulled out the magazine and flipped to page five.There, at the bottom, was a color image of Maggie and some smarmy guy, glasses of champagne in hand, toasting each other.And she was smiling at him.Smiling at the jerk the way Brawley wanted her to smile at him.The difference between them?Real estate.The jerk apparently lived in New York while he lived in Maverick Junction.He squinted at the photo.What was Maggie thinking?The guy was a mess.His hair stuck out all over the placeand hed no doubt worked hard to get it like that.He had a major case of five oclock shadow.Again, no doubt deliberate.And an earring, for Gods sake.A mammoth diamond earring.Probably fake.How had she hooked up with him so fast?Didnt she know it could be dangerous to pick up guys in the city?Hell, anywhere for that matter.Look what had happened to Sophie.He tore his eyes off the picture long enough to read the small paragraph beneath it.Maggie Sullivan, up and coming fashion designer, is seen celebrating her new clothing line with go to photographer Jarvis Quillen.So shed met him at work.Okay.He breathed easier.She should be safe.Shed met him at work!Shit!That meant they had shared interests, would spend a lot of time together.The guy looked like one of those bad boys girls swooned over.Brawley squinted at the grainy snapshot.From what he could tell, old Jarvis even dressed in the stereotypical bad boy black leather.Brawley wondered if hed arranged with one of his photographer friends to get caught on film.The picture looked posed.Jarvis Quillen?What the hell kind of name was that?A made up one hed bet.The guys real name was probably something very uncool.Maybe Seymour Smith or Norbert Jones.He leaned up on his left hip and pulled his phone from his right back pocket.Jabbing much harder than necessary, he typed a quick message.Hows Jarvis?Before he could hit send, though, he came to his senses and deleted the snippy words.His stomach growled.If he hurried, hed have time for a quick snack before the guys showed up.Hed eaten lunch on the run today, between patients, and hed passed hungry an hour ago.Brawley had barely cleaned up after his PB&J when he heard the truck pull in.Ty and Cash came up the stairs together, Staubach at their heels.Ty had apparently left Trouble at home again.Hearing the door open, the Yorkie came tearing out of Brawleys bedroom.Seeing the big dog in his kitchen, he hit the brakes and skidded halfway across the flooring.Brawley glanced at Cash.Theyll be fine, his friend assured.Staubachs an old hand at this.You name him yet?Ty asked.Marvin.Marvin?Yeah.Got a problem with that?None at all.Doesnt mean Im keeping him.Cash looked at Ty.Bet you twenty.No way.Im using my money to take yours tonight in poker.You guys are butts, Brawley growled.Probably.Welcome to the dog owners club.Cash patted his friend on the back.Always figured you for a hunting dog.Something a little more masculine.In his heart, Marvins a killer.Right.A little sniffing and circling, a few small yips from the Yorkie, and the dogs accepted each other.Staubach roamed the kitchen, accepted the piece of cheese Brawley offered, then curled up on the living room rug, tail thumping a wild beat on the floor.Brawley wondered if Dottie and Fletch could hear it downstairs.Not to be outdone, Marvin sat on his rear, patiently waiting for a handout.Go away, Brawley said.You started it, Cash said.You cant play favorites.Give him a piece.Brawley tossed the dog some cheese, and it disappeared immediately.When Marvin turned his big brown eyes back to him, Brawley shook his head.No more.Go lay down.With a sigh, the little dog wandered off to the living room and dropped down beside Staubach.You get any bites on the ad you ran with Mel?Not a one, Brawley answered.Either nobodys reading the paper or no one wants a new dog.Least not like him.He tipped his head toward Marvin.People in Texas like things big.The other two nodded.What are Sophie and Annie doing tonight?They decided it would be a good movie night.Theyre setting the boys up with a Disney film in the den, and the two of them have big plans for some new chick flick, Ty said.I swear they have enough food to feed an army.Ive got pizza.Some cheese, chips, and beer.What more could any man want?Cash asked.He sat down at the table and started shuffling the deck of cards Brawley handed him.Open me one of those beers, why dont you?Brawley popped the top on three of them, then set the oven to preheat.Staubach watched everything with one eye.That dog doesnt miss a thing, does he?Nope.Cash dealt five cards to each of them.Ty picked up his, studied them, and took a sip of beer.Then he pushed a few of his chips to the center of the table.Brawley eyed them and met his bet.Cash followed suit.Remember the time you lifted the bottle of Jim Beam from your dad and I borrowed a pack of Camels from mine?Ty groaned.I dont think Ive ever been so sick in my life.Yeah, you tossed your cookies all over the back seat of my dads Buick.He grounded me for a week and made me clean up the mess.Ty laughed.If I remember right, you tossed a few of your own cookies doing it.Damn straight.Recycled Jim Beam is rank.Cash picked up the deck.How many?Ty tossed two cards onto the table.A pair.Cash dealt him two.Brawley?He discarded three, and Cash gave him a trio.After another look at his own, he replaced two.How about the time Maggie followed us to the pond behind your grandpas, Cash?Ty grinned.You threw that snake in the water with her.I think thats why she learned to shoot.Always figured shed plug me with the first bullet, the snake with the second.As it was, she gave me one hell of a shiner.Ty nodded.That girl turned into a monster when she got mad.Still does, Brawley said.You should know.Yeah, yeah, yeah.A knock sounded at the door, and the guys looked at each other.You invite anybody else?Nope.Another knock at the door had Brawley tossing his cards on the table.When he scraped back his chair, Staubach leaped to his feet, wanting to be part of the welcoming committee.Marvin yipped and darted across the room to join them.What am I?The zoo keeper?Brawley had hung a blind over the doors window to give himself some privacy, but it kept him from seeing who was outside.Im gonna grab another beer, Ty said.Get one for me, too, Cash said.Make it three.Then toss that pizza in the oven.Brawley threw open the door, then simply stood there, hand on the knob.Are you going to invite me in?Behind him, he could feel Ty and Cash studying the new arrival.Staubach licked their guests hand, and she drew back, a look of disgust on her face.Cash snapped his fingers and pointed at the floor.Both dogs reluctantly lay down.Rachel.Brawley blinked, but couldnt for the life of him think what to say.Shed called.Hed told her not to come.Then he spotted her overnight case.Oh, boy.This was so not happening.Ty closed the fridge door and cleared his throat.We can go, bro, if you want No.The ladys not staying.Rachel made a small indignant squeak.I drove all the way from Dallas.And Im sure your car will make the drive back just fine.Cash stood.Maybe this is a conversation you should have in private.I know you, Rachel said.We met at the Then and Now fund raiser.Yes, we did.You were with Annelise Montjoy.Annelise Hardeman now.I know.She glowed.I saw your wedding pictures in all the magazines.Cashs face took on a pained expression.Brawley knew he had yet to get comfortable with his wifes celebrity status.Brawley threw his pal a heated look.You and Ty stay right where you are.He turned back to his uninvited guest.Lets take this outside.She pouted but stepped back.Joining her on the landing, he closed the door behind him.He could only imagine the conversation between his friends inside.I miss you.She stepped closer and laid a hand on his chest.Oh, God.He ran his fingers through his hair.He hated this.Why did women have to push?When a relationship ended, it ended.Then he thought of Maggie.Was that how she felt about him?That he was trying to breathe life into a dead affair?That was different.Their relationship hadnt actually ended.Brawley?He snapped back to the present problem.Damn, dressed in white leggings and a skinny little top, Rachel looked good.A man would have to be dead not to notice her.But she had no depth.Shed never be Maggie.Why are you here?I told you.I miss you.Her hand ran up the front of his shirt.I called.Yes, you did, and I told you not to come.Were done, Rachel.Im sorry.He laid a hand on her shoulder and was shocked to see tears.Real?he wondered.Or good acting?You mean that, dont you?Yes.Can I spend the night with you?He shook his head.She reached up, traced a finger along his ear.Brawley jerked his head away.Stop that.You cant really expect me to drive all the way back to Dallas tonight.Temper replaced her tears.He sighed and raked his hair again.No, he couldnt send her down the road.Not this late.But by damn, she wasnt sleeping here.Glancing down the stairs, he made up his mind.As much as he hated to do it, he couldnt think of any other solution.Come with me.He picked up her case and headed down the steps.My landlady has an extra room.Im sure she wont mind if you use it tonight.Your landlady?You met her in Dallas.The older woman with Annie?Yep.But Pops answered the quick rap on Dotties door.Hey, Brawley.I almost talked Dottie into letting me join you upstairs tonight.Youre more than welcome.I told you that.Yeah, I know, but weve decided to watch one of her favorite movies.Doctor Zhivago.He rolled his eyes, then caught sight of Rachel, whod made her way slowly down the stairs and now stood behind Brawley.Whos this?Dottie peeked around the living room doorway.Hey, Brawley.Then she saw Rachel.Oh, I thought tonight was poker night with the boys.It is.He shifted, scuffed his foot on her welcome mat.Dottie, this is Rachel Morgan.You met her in Dallas.Oh, yes.Dottie smiled.Come in, Rachel.Brawley, whats wrong with you keeping her standing outside?She tucked her arm through her husbands.Rachel, have you met Fletch?Looking more than a little stunned, Rachel shook her head.Fletch held out a hand.Fletcher Sullivan.Come on in.Both of you.Rachel shook his hand.Nice to meet you.I have a huge favor to ask, Brawley said.Wait.Rachel turned to him and whispered, I can get a hotel room.I dont want to bother them.No rooms for a long way, Rach.I think this is your best bet for tonight.He raised his voice.Dottie, Fletch, do you think you could put Rachel up for tonight?Dottie blinked, and Fletchs eyes narrowed.Certainly, Dottie said.The spare rooms all freshened up.I did it right after the kids left, when we came back from Austin.Personally, Id be glad to have her.Fletch met Brawleys gaze.Seeing how youve only got one bed upstairs and all.Pretty hard to have overnight company, right, boy?Brawley stared Maggies grandpa down.Message received loud and clear, and youre right.A hundred percent.Well, then, Fletch, why dont you take the girls suitcase back to the extra room?Dottie nudged her husband.Yep.Have you had dinner?Dottie asked.Yes.Yes, I have.Dottie tipped her head at Brawley.When youre done saying whatever it is needs said, you come on into the living room, Rachel.Weve got cookies and coffee to go with our movie.With that she drifted into the front room.Good night, Rachel.Have a safe trip back.He opened the door and stepped outside.Wait.She followed him out.Im sorry, Brawley.I didnt come to cause you any problems.I think you underestimate yourself.Youre a good person, and Im not sure I appreciated you enough.She laid a hand on his cheek.Theres more to me than my role as a Dallas Cowboy cheerleader.I know that.Do you?Her eyes searched his face.I wonder.Im not sure I ever really showed you the real me.I was too busy being the sexy, empty headed cheerleader I thought you wanted.She stepped back into the house.Putting a hand on the door, she started to close it.I wish you well.He stared at the closed door, then watched through the window as she joined Dottie and Fletch in the living room.And he felt like a heel.He just couldnt seem to get it right.Youre sure you dont want to come to Maggies show?Cash asked.Brawley sighed.Weve been through this before.Doc will take care of the clinic.Have you been talking to him?What?No!But Im sure he wouldnt mind.Cash ran a hand over his chin.Im sure he wouldnt, either.Hes offered a dozen times this past week, Brawley admitted.You need to think about it, Ty said.I have.He walked outside with his friends and stood at the end of the drive as they headed home to their wives.He thought about Rachel tucked away in Dotties spare room.All in all, that had turned out better than it should have.Hed expected Rachel to make more of a fuss.Maybe he had underestimated her.She wasnt for him, though, and he wasnt for her.Hed never make her happy, not in the long run.While he climbed the stairs, he resolved to make a change.Hed been on idle way too many years, and it was past time to take charge of his life.If he wanted Maggie in itand he didhed better man up and do what needed to be done.Back inside, he locked the door behind him in case Rachel decided to pay a late night visit.He tossed beer bottles into the recycling bin, broke down the pizza boxes and added those, then mopped up the crumbs and water rings from the table.He dumped the dirty plates and silverware into the dishwasher.Marvin trotted right along beside him, his nails clicking on the aged linoleum.Finished with his tidying, he picked up the remote and turned the TV station to ESPN.Two sportscasters argued over the value of pinch hitters.The overhead kitchen light glared in his eyes, and he flipped it off.A lamp beside the sofa shed a soft glow over the small apartment.Flopping onto the leather sofa, he jammed a throw pillow under his head, then covered his face with his hand.The sofa cushion sagged as Marvin hopped up beside him.He reached down and rubbed the dogs head.What the hell was he going to do?Cashs question had started the debate raging in his head again.When everybody else flew off to New York to support Maggie at her showing could he really sit at home twiddling his thumbs?Forget that!He reached for his laptop, but his eyes caught on the clock.Oops.Way too late to mess with this.Besides, he couldnt simply show up there, could he?Hed already eaten more than a fair share of crow.Hed apologized, tried to explain.But would Maggie have any of it?Oh, no.She wouldnt listen.Wouldnt believe.And damned if he intended to crawl again.He needed to think about this.Time to go to bed.He had to work tomorrow.He toed off his boots and stripped off his socks.Walking barefoot into the bedroom, he dropped his clothes inside the door.Jeans, shirt, boxersall of itlanded in a heap on the hardwood floor.Sliding beneath the sheets, still rumpled from last night, he stared up at the ceiling.Sleep refused to come.Marvin, curled up beside him, didnt have the same problem.He started snoring inside two minutes.Slowly, a plan formed in Brawleys mind.A way to save face.Throwing back the bedclothes, he jumped up, grabbed his boxers from the pile, and stepped into them.In the living room, he turned on his laptop.Somewhere in that huge city, there had to be a veterinary conference he could attend.Animal doctors came together all the time to discuss the latest treatment and medicines.It was simply a matter of finding it and registering.Voila.The answer to his problem.Twenty One  On her hands and knees adjusting a hem, Maggie heard the door slap open.When she turned, Sophie and Annie stood just inside the room, a look of awe on their faces.Hey!Maggie scrambled to her feet.Im so glad youre here!How was the flight?Great!She opened her arms, and the three of them met in the middle of the room for a huge hug.All of them talking at once, she showed them around, pointing out features of the outfits arranged on dress forms.Which is mine?Sophie asked.Over here.Maggie led them to a slim, floor length gown in black charmeuse.Swirly black lace over a nude, barely there fabric formed the top.Sophie stared at it, then at Maggie.I can actually wear this?Youd better wear it.I made it specifically to your measurements.Oh, Tys going to want me so bad when he sees me in this, she sang.I think thats a pretty accurate prediction, although my guess is hed want you even dressed in a feed sack.Well try this on and see if I need to make any nips or tucks.Sophie clapped her hands.I feel like a kid on the last day of school.Then Maggie glanced at Annie, her eyes taking in subtle changes.We may need to make a few adjustments to the fit on yours, Mama in waiting.Annie beamed and patted her still flat tummy.Im so glad the doctor gave me permission to fly.Id have died if I couldnt be here.Me, too.Without friends Maggie shook her head.Nothings quite as sweet.She walked them over to a black two piece outfit.The knit top zipped halfway down the front and had bat sleeves.Maggie had paired it with a very short, slim skirt.This ones yours, Annie.The top has a blousy fit.It should be perfect for you.Oooh, I like this.Annie ran a hand over the shoulders and down the sleeves.I think Ill let Cash buy it for me.She grinned.And Id be eternally grateful.That way Ill have at least one sale.Maggie.
