Sophie draped an arm over her shoulder.Youre not seriously worried, are you?Yes, I am.Owen has invested a lot of money in all this.She waved a hand around the room.Im praying he didnt misplace his trust.No way.Theyre going to love you.Annie pulled out her phone.You cant take any pictures, Maggie said quickly.No, I know.Im texting a few friends to tell them how wonderful your collection is and that I cant wait to see them at the show tomorrow.Theyll tell a few friends who will tell a few friends.Cant hurt to salt the place, right?Youre good.Ive spent too many years with Dad and Grandpa to let this kind of opportunity pass.Glancing around, Annie said, Im starving.Feeding two, you know.Can you take time for lunch?I cant, but theres a great little restaurant two doors down.Why dont you go have lunch, bring something back for me, and well do your fittings?Sounds good.Dont eat too much.Remember, you have to fit into these outfits tomorrow.Annie waved over her shoulder.Well skip dessert.Speak for yourself, Sophie said.Maggie put a hand on her back and stretched into it.It had been a long day.But she was ready.Every single outfit had been completed and accessorized.A lot of designers seemed to thrive on last minute drama.Not her.Shed insisted Annie and Sophie go back to her apartment earlier with orders for Annie to nap.Shed been looking rather peaked by the time theyd finished her fitting.Having already sent everyone including Zandra home, Maggie shut off the lights and locked up.After months, heck, years of preparing for this, now, on the eve of her first showing, it all seemed surreal.Rather than take the subway, she decided to splurge on a taxi.It wasnt every day she finished putting final touches on her very own runway show.When she reached her apartment, she smiled at the lights on in the windows.Her friends waited inside for her.She flew up the stairs with renewed vigor.Opening the door, she called, Hello.Anybody home?Annie peeked around the kitchen counter.Hey, Maggie.This place is wonderful.It is, isnt it?She dropped her keys and purse on the little stand inside the door.Sophie came down the hall, a towel wrapped around her.I already took my shower, so the bath is open.Maggie dropped into a chair.Good.I might stand under the water for the rest of the evening.Im beat.She reached down and pulled off her shoes.Oh, my feet love me right now.Sophie and Annie glanced at each other.Maggie caught it.What?We thought you might be in this shape when you hit the door, Annie said.Sophie nodded.And?Maggie prompted.Sophie took a peek at the wall clock.You have about twenty minutes for that shower.I noticed a comfy, terry cloth robe hanging on the back of the bathroom door.If you want, you can wear that to dinner.My robe?Maggies forehead creased in a frown.Thats pretty casual even for Maverick Junction.Im not sure Id get away with it here in the city.Not out and around maybe, Annie said.But you certainly can here in your own home.I intend to wear my pjs, Sophie said.And Im changing into mine, Annie added.As soon as the food comes.Somebody has to be decent to answer the door.What are you talking about?Whos coming?The delivery boy with all things decadent from my favorite restaurant.You ordered in?I did.Oh, Annie, I do love you.Maggie hadnt realized how badly shed missed this.The food came ten minutes after her shower, and they ate in the living room, talking a mile a minute about Maverick Junction, her show, the coming baby, books theyd read, and movies theyd watched.About everything and nothing.A church bell tower down the street chimed eleven times.Can it be that late?Maggie checked the wall clock.Were running on Central time, so according to our internal clock its only ten, Annie said.Between the trip and this little one, though, Im bushed.You slept almost the whole way here, Sophie said.Annies brows rose.Im surprised you noticed.We barely had our seat belts fastened before you, the nervous flier, fell asleep.Guilty as charged.I had a good reason, though.Jesse caught some kind of virus at school and spent most of the night in the bathroom throwing up.My guess is the other two will be at it tonight, although when I checked in, Ty said so far, so good.Who are the boys staying with when he flies out?His mom and dad.Theyll have their hands full if the upchucking starts while theyre with them.Babs wanted them for a little auntie time, but she has to run to Austin tomorrow.Shell be on standby after she gets home if Gram and Grampa need her.Sophie threw Annie an evil grin.You have no idea what youre in for, cuz.That may be, Annie said.However, Im only going to experience everything times one, not times three.There is that.Maggie yawned and stretched.I hate to be a party pooper, girls, but I need to find my bed.Ive been working my butt off, and tomorrow promises to be a long day.She pointed at them.And you.Ive told everyone I have the two most beautiful women in the world modeling for me, so we cant have any red eyes from lack of sleep.Sophie picked up their glasses and walked to the kitchen with them.Good night, then, Cinderella.Sleep well.You have everything you need?Maggie asked.Yes, we do.I hate having you sleep on the couch, Sophie.Its a comfortable sofa, and Ill be fine.Go to bed.Okay, okay.Maggie hugged her friends.I cant even begin to tell you how glad I am that youre here.Youre exactly what the doctor ordered.As she closed her bedroom door, she heard Annie and Sophie talking and smiled.The apartment had been too quiet.She liked it like this, full of friends and laughter.She brushed her teeth and slid into bed.Her phone chirped, and she reached across the nightstand to check the text.Hows it going?Ready for your big day?Brawley was thinking about her.Maggie quickly typed an answer.I hope so.Sophie and Annie arrived today.Companys always fun.Got that right, she typed.Hear you had company, too.No response.Maybe she shouldnt have taunted him with that, but darn it, the idea of Rachel showing up at his door raised her hackles.It shouldnt.Brawley deserved a life.A wife and children.Regardless of whether shed stayed in Maverick Junction or moved here, the cowboy would never be hers.Sooner or later, he was bound to find someone, but she didnt want it to be Rachel.Her phone chirped again, and she grabbed it.Rachel slept in Dotties extra room.Didnt speak to her more than a couple minutes.He sounded impatient.Good.Of course, shed already known Rachel hadnt stayed with him, but still Wasnt talking that had me worried.The instant she sent it, she groaned.That had been a mistake.Shed told him she didnt care.And she didnt.But he might get the wrong idea from that message.She quickly typed another.Love life a little bumpy?His response was almost immediate.Never loved her, Mags.Youre the only woman I ever said those words to.Oh, God.The phone nearly slid from her boneless fingers.Before she could respond, another message blipped onto her screen.Cat got your tongue, Red?She silenced the phone and pulled the covers over her head.Twenty Two  The morning sun had barely peeked between the two buildings across the street when Maggie padded into the bath.So much rode on today.Please, please let the show be a success, she prayed.If it flopped, shed never get another chance.Never be able to hold up her head.If it was a successShe shook her head.She couldnt go there.Not yet.Didnt want to jinx it.She took a quick shower, did her makeup carefully, and fixed her hair in a messy twist.When she opened her closet door, she didnt even try to curb her heartfelt sigh.The outfit shed wear today hung front and center.Shed designed it with as much care as shed put into any the models would wear.The slim black pants and hunter green and black printed tunic top fit her perfectly.A short leather jacket with zippers galore finished it off.Oh, and the boots.They were almost orgasmic.The outfit was a mix of edgy and professional.It shouted successful and chic.She loved it.For right now, though, she threw on a pair of jeans and a tee.She still had far too much to do.Shed take the outfit with her and change at the studio.Sophie roused enough to give Maggie a sleepy smile as she tiptoed past, boots in hand.You leaving?she asked.In a few minutes.Will it bother you if I make a cup of coffee?Not at all.Sophie rubbed her eyes.You have no idea what mornings are like back home.This is heaven.She nestled down into her pillow and fell instantly asleep again.Any other morning, Maggie might have envied her, but not this morning.Flying high on adrenaline, she impatiently watched the coffee gurgle into her cup.She slathered a piece of toast with peanut butter, grabbed her coffee, and rushed out the door.A taxi, like a hungry shark on the lookout for prey, cruised slowly along the street, and she flagged it down.Even though shed checked and double checked everything before shed left her studio yesterday, she needed to be there when the movers loaded the racks of clothing into the van for their trip to the show venue.Zandra arrived ten minutes after she did.Did you eat this morning?she asked Maggie.Toast and coffee.You need protein.I put half a jar of peanut butter on my toast.Zandra slid her sunglasses down her nose and looked at Maggie over the top of them.I seriously doubt that.Okay.I might have overstated, but I did cover it with PB.Rather than bothering to answer, Zandra punched in a number on her cell and ordered two full breakfasts from the corner deli.We can eat while we wait for the transport guys.Id argue, but Ive got an idea this will be our last chance at food for quite a while.You are so right, Kemosabe.She frowned.What did the Lone Ranger call Tonto?If youre Kemosabe, who am I?Maggie laughed.I have no idea.But honestly, Zandra?I dont care what you call yourself.Youre a gift from heaven.I couldnt have pulled this off without you.Oh, I think youd have done fine.A knock sounded at the door before Jeb from the deli stuck his head inside.Got a couple breakfasts here.Anybody hungry?Starving, Zandra said.Maggie pulled some bills from her top drawer and handed them to Jeb.Here you go.She took the bag from him.Break a leg today, Ms.Sullivan.Thanks.They sat cross legged on the floor in the middle of the studio and ate.Maggie realized that, despite her toast, she was ravenous.After last nights dinner, she hadnt thought shed ever eat again.Annie had ordered enough food for an army.Half of it was stacked in plastic in her fridge.The door popped open again, and a flash went off.Startled, Maggie dropped her fork, then laughed.Jarvis.Good morning.It is that.He hadnt shaved, and his clothes looked thrown together carelessly.Maggie was certain, though, hed chosen each piece carefully to gain exactly that effect.As a photographer, he knew better than anyone that this business was all about image.Thought Id take a few shots of you doing last minute prep on the collection.Instead you caught me stuffing my face.Hungry?she asked.He dropped to the floor, picked up one of the plastic forks, and took a bite of her scrambled eggs.Not bad.But Im not all that hungry.Not for breakfast.The look he sent her told her exactly what he craved.Zandra shot to her feet.I think this is where I exit left and find something in the office to keep me occupied.No.Maggie stood.I need you right here to help with the loading.The men will be here any minute.Jarvis shrugged.Nothing ventured He wandered to the racks.Looks like everythings under control.I sure hope so.Come stand by the window.I want a couple shots with the buildings behind you, the racks of clothes in front of you.She rolled her eyes.Its all part of the game, Maggie.I know.Sitting on the window ledge, she sent him a megawatt smile.Jarvis blew out his breath.Dont understand how any man still breathing can resist that.His camera clicked, once, twice, three times.Two hours later, Maggie stood looking over the venue.The pristine white tent in Bryant Park symbolized her dream come true.Rather than wait for September Fashion Week, she and Owen had opted for an off season showing.In just under four hours, the first model would walk down that runway wearing one of Maggies designs.Right now, though, not another soul was here.Annie and Sophie, along with Zandra, understanding her need to enjoy this moment alone, would arrive shortly.The movers had finished, and her outfits hung on covered racks.Shed actually ridden in the truck with the guys to oversee the transfer.Right now, though, at this moment in time, it was only her, a dream, and row upon row of empty chairs.She tried to envision the room full of people and worried again that no one would show up for an unknowns premier.Overhead, chandeliers sparkled.The stage crew would be here any minute to do their job with lighting and backdrop, and the florists would show up to handle that part of the staging.Slowly, she walked to the runway, ran a finger along the edge of it.Had Valentino, Versace, or Carolina Herrera ever been this nervous?Doubted their vision?Not that she considered herself in their league.But then, they hadnt been in their league, either, when they first started out, had they?She made her way around the stage to the back.The dressing area, the makeup section, the cubbies for the hairstylists.Unable to resist, she stepped through the opening and took a walk down the runwaywith attitude.At the end, she stopped, pivoted, and bowed.Then, laughing out loud, she sauntered back and slipped through the curtain.God, she loved this!With any luck, shed be back for a repeat performance next year and the year after that.She prayed she never took it for granted.Never lost this magical feeling.For the actual show, thered be lights and music.More magic.Last night with Annie and Sophie had been wonderful.Had grounded her.Today, her mom and dad, Pops and Dottie, Cash and Ty would all be here to share her special day.Initially theyd considered flying in early, then decided to wait.Last night had been girls night.Today, theyd meet her at the show, then theyd all go to dinner.If some small part of her cried foul because Brawley would be missing, she shushed it.After all, shed made it more than clear she didnt want him to attend.Shed been celebrating without him for years.Not true, the devil on her left shoulder chided.And darned if her right shoulder angel, the one who should be on her side, didnt nod in agreement.Hes always come when its important.Hes been around for every big day of your life.Well, too bad.He wouldnt be here today, and that was that.Security had been stationed out front, both to ensure her designs remained secret till the unveiling and for crowd control.Attendees had to be vetted.Since they had a limited number of seats, it was crucial they accommodate invited guests and photographers before admitting the public.Again, Maggie smiled.She could only hope that would be a problem!A florist burst through the door holding a fragrant bouquet of white and purple lilacs.For you, Ms.Sullivan.Thank you!She took the vase and inhaled deeply.Was there anything that smelled better?She read the card and smiled.Brawley had sent her flowers.He would be part of today.She wanted to cry.She missed him, damn it.One by one, and in small groups, workers, models, and stylists trickled in, and Maggie set the flowers on one of the workstations.Pushing Brawley farther to the back of her mind, she wished she had handcuffs and duct tape to keep him there.She peeked at each outfit again, checking for the hundredth time that everything was exactly right.At their stations, hairdressers and makeup artists set out the tools of their trade.Zandra zipped around the room, lending a hand wherever needed.Sophie and Annie, after a quick sniff of lilac, sat down in a couple of the makeup chairs.Once the show started, this area would turn to chaos regardless of her planning.She understood that.But the whole show had to be choreographed to the second.Inside twenty minutes, the backstage team would send all her models down the runway.She couldnt afford to screw up.Not wanting to be thought of as a one note designer, but understanding the risk, shed included a little of everything in todays show.A belted thigh length hooded leather jacket over a silk top and black leggings.A camel brown leather skirt and a cashmere top.A woolen jacket paired with a skirt in alternating corduroy and leather panels.Tights and cowboy boots would finish that outfit, a nod to her Texas roots.Along with the casual, shed created office and evening wear.Shed added chunky jewelry and big bags.There was nothing shy about her collection.The last rack held the real showstoppers.Two wedding gowns.One an A line flow of champagne colored velvet, the other a white silk chiffon strapless dress with a deep front slit and lots of layers.They couldnt be more differentand she loved them both.Shed hesitated to include them, then figured what the heck.After Annies wedding, a lot of brides had tapped her to create their gowns.Why not go for it?It was a part of the business she adored, designing a dress for the most memorable day of a womans life.While the last of the models drifted in, Maggie and her assistants busily steamed dresses, slacks, and tops.The noise escalated.She closed her eyes and took two seconds to envision the earlier quiet, the peace that reigned when shed first entered, and tried to match that with the present madhouse.She couldnt and grinned.She loved it.Twenty Three  If Lady Luck hung with him, he might make it.Thankful he hadnt checked any baggage, Brawley swung the strap of his carry on over his shoulder and headed for outside.New York air, heavy with late spring heat, smog, and noise, hit him the second he stepped through the doors.And this was the world Maggie chosejust as hed picked Dallas.Hadnt he always missed Maverick Junction, though?The longing to return had grown every time hed visited.Each time he and Maggie bumped into each other.Hailing a taxi, he told the driver to take him to Tiffanys.Before he went to his hotel to change, he had some shopping to do.An hour and a half later, arms folded over his chest, Brawley leaned against a tent pole.It had been almost a month since hed seen Maggie, and this first sight was as sweet as honey drizzled over one of his mamas warm, homemade biscuits.God, hed missed this woman.Totally in her element, Maggie looked absolutely stunning in a black leather jacket and boots, slim pants, and a dark green and black top.With her wild red curls somewhat tamed into submission in a sexy twist, she was a vision.Surrounded by high paid fashion models, she outshone them all.He watched her sew on a loose button, find a missing shoe, and handle a hairdo problem without missing a beat.One of the models approached her.Dont you think this dress would have been better in a brighter fabric?Red maybe?For the briefest second, Maggies eyes flashed.Then a thin veneer of cool professionalism covered her redheads fiery temper.No, I dont.With that she walked away, leaving the pouting diva behind.When she stopped beside a vase of flowers, he recognized them for the ones hed sent, and his heart staggered into a crazy Texas two step.She traced a leaf and leaned in to smell the lilacs, her lips curving in a smile.Good.She was thinking about him.With one heavy lidded glance her way, he touched the box in his pocket and slipped from the doorway.Hed stepped back here to wish her luck.It didnt look like she would need it.From what hed seen, Maggie Sullivan should be all the rage come tomorrow morning.New Yorks newest darling.She wouldnt be coming home.He pulled out the ticket Rita had palmed him and tracked down his seat.Scanning the crowd, he recognized a lot of celebrities.Owen Cook had done his job, got the right group here.And Maggie would wow them with her work.He took his seat in the nick of time.The curtain parted, and the first model stepped out to wild applause.One after another, they paraded down the runway in Maggies designs.The show eclipsed anything she might have wished for.He caught a glimpse of her as she peeked through a crack in the curtains and knew she had to be over the moon.Every single piece was enthusiastically received.When Sophie glided down the aisle in her black, floor length gown, the crowd went crazy.Beside him, Ty beamed with pride.Then Annelise Montjoy Hardeman, the darling of the press, stepped onto the runway in a short two piece outfit.It was insane, and Brawleys chest swelled with pride right along with Cashs.Maggie had outdone herself.When the models lined up for their last walk down the runway, Brawley breathed a sigh of relief.Not a single glitch.The last disappeared, and Maggie stepped out.If she was nervous, if her stomach was doing some major cartwheels, it didnt show on her face.She sent the crowd a dazzling smile, and Brawley figured every male in the place instantly fell in love.How could they help it?The blinding smile in place, she looked out over the crowd as cameras flashed.How many times had she pinched herself?he wondered.He knew the exact moment she saw him.A few feet down the walk, she missed a step, her mouth opening slightly.He sat immobile beside her parents, Pops, Dottie, Ty, and Cash.Brawley grinned at her, giving her a thumbs up, and recognized the quick start of happiness in her eyes.She winked.Her father and grandfather both looked proud enough to blow a gasket.Her mom blew her a kiss, and she blew one back.One last wave to the audience, one last bow, and she disappeared behind the curtain.The applause died down and, while the crowd milled, her family made their way backstage.Thats when Brawley saw him.The man in the tabloid photo.He looked like a mussed bedor like hed just crawled out of one.It better not have been Maggies.The creep put his arms around her and gave her a very unprofessional, non brotherly kiss.A muscle in Brawleys jaw jumped.This wasnt the Maggie hed grown up with, the one hed played cops and robbers with.The one hed slept with.This Maggie, the one kissing the unmade bed, was a mature woman.Determined.Insightful.Shed see through this jerk who had his hands all over her.The same one shed had dinner withat least once.What did she see when she looked at him?Brawley wondered.Another jerk?One whod been too stupid to realize how deeply she loved him?One whod been careless with that love?Before he hurt her again, hed do well to sort out his feelings for this older, wiser Maggie.Curiosity?Nostalgia?Love?Sweat popped out on his forehead.Maybe tonight wasnt the right time for this soul searching.It could wait until tomorrow.Boy, Brawley.Once again Im amazed at how well you clean up.Maggie ran a hand over the collar of another of his impeccable dark suits.Irresistibly handsome in jeans and a T shirt, he was mouth wateringly devastating in formal dress.You look incredible, Mags.He took her hands.Youve lost weight.Its been a busy month.Today was a huge success.You think?Uncertainty still nagged at her.I know.She grinned, then looked down.What?No boots?Not today.Ive gone city.She laughed, but she missed her cowboy.Her cowboy?No.The cowboy.She missed the cowboy in him.She touched a hand to his face and realized she rarely saw him without at least a couple days stubble.Today, he was clean shaven.Gorgeous, but still dark and dangerous.A little territorial, though.She hadnt missed the scowls flying between him and Jarvis and hated that it gave her just the tiniest thrill of satisfaction.Could Brawley be jealous?Jarvis disappeared backstage to speak to one of the makeup artists.Whats up with him?Brawley did a head jerk in the direction the photographer had gone.Hes my photographer and a friend.Friend, my ass.He is attractive, isnt he?Wouldnt know, Brawley growled.Hes not my type.Hes not mine, either.Sure wouldnt have guessed that from the picture in one of those tabloids they carry in Sadlers.You saw that?Zandra had told her about the picture.Yeah.Why, Brawley Odell, I had no idea you read that kind of trash.I dont.Missy took forever to ring up my poker night groceries.Out of boredom, I picked one up, and there you were, all cozied up with your friend.A friend who wants to get you in bed.His words, soft, silky fire, burned through her.Thats nonsense, she bit back even as her mind flashed back to the kiss she and Jarvis had shared outside her apartment.His warning.Brawley shook his head.Afraid not.Ive been watching him watching you.He hasnt had you yet.Hes too hungry.But he wants you, darlin.Bad.Well, he cant have me.Brawley smiled.You hold on to that thought.He dug into his jacket pocket and came out with the little blue Tiffany bag.The package is kind of crushed, but that wont change whats inside.He handed it to her.Reaching into the bag, she came out with the jewelers box.Her eyes went wide.Brawley He held her gaze.Go ahead.Open it.But Her tongue flicked out, slicked across her lower lip.She looked at the box as if it would bite.Oh, for The first lick of temper flared in his eyes.Its not a ring if thats what has you looking like youre about to pass out.Its a gift to celebrate today, thats all.Something to add to the charm bracelet I gave you when you turned sixteenif you still have it.I do.Its one of the things I brought to New York with me.She brushed at a strand of hair that had fallen into her eyes.Opening the box, she smiled.Oh, Brawley.Its perfect.She lifted the charm, a tiny pair of silver scissors.I love it.Not stopping to think, she threw her arms around him.Thank you, she whispered.Brawley closed his eyes and held her tight.Just for a minute.This one moment when shed forgotten to be angry and hugged him the way she used to.When he opened his eyes, he caught Annies.She gave him a big thumbs up.He smiled.Maybe he did have somebody on his team after all.When Maggie stepped back, he kissed her cheek.Congratulations.Youre a huge success, Red.Im proud of you.He was.So damned proud and happy, even though he knew in his heart her success spelled the end for any hope he still held.They all went out to dinner.Jarvis, Zandra, and Owen joined her family and friends.Owen insisted the night was his treat.He raised his glass.To the first of many, many successful shows for Ms.Maggie Sullivan.Everyone clinked glasses and echoed the sentiment.Thank you, Owen, Maggie said.And to all of you.Every one of you had a part in this day.Tears threatened, and she blinked them away.She held up her own glass.To quote the Bard, My heart is ever at your service.She caught Brawleys eyes and looked away quickly.Okay, lets eat, Cash said.Im starved.Lunch was a lifetime ago.Amen to that, Ty agreed.Over caviar, champagne, and the best steaks Maggie had ever tasted, they shared stories of the day.With Jarvis on one side and Brawley on the other, she felt a little like the 38th parallel between North and South Korea.Between their jabs at each other and the fact her phone never stopped ringing, Maggie had a hard time following the conversation at the table.Her phone rang again.It was Doc Gibson.How did your show go, Maggie?It was beyond anything I could have hoped for.Let me put you on speakerphone.Everyone chatted for a few minutes.When are you coming home?he asked.I dont know.Ill probably be back in a month or so to check on things at the shop.You be sure to save some time for me.Maybe lunch at Sallys?Its a date.She laughed, and they said their good byes.No sooner had she hung up than the phone rang again.Hey, Mel, she answered.Hows it going, dollface?Great!Dont suppose theres any chance of snagging some photos and an exclusive interview to run in tomorrows edition is there?I stayed late, just in case.The fourth estate never sleeps, you know.She chuckled.So ask away, pal.Youve been granted that exclusive.Jarvis is here, but I doubt hell share any of his photos.Beside her, Jarvis shook his head.I cant.Im under contract.Thats what I thought, she mouthed.Whos Jarvis?Mel asked.Hes my photographer.Ive been working with him on the collection, and he covered the show.I have pictures.Brawley glared around her at Jarvis.Lots of them.Tell Mel Ill download several and send them to him when I get back to the hotel.And Ill bet theyre great, Maggie thought.Artistic.He had an eye for exactly the right moment, the right shot, the right angle.Did you hear that, Mel?I did.Tell him not to forget.He paused.I thought he said he wasnt going.Yes, thats what we all thought.She eyed Brawley who was now ignoring her.Turns out he had a convention in New York this week.Hmmm.Pretty convenient.Laughter laced his words.Yes, wasnt it?They talked for a couple more minutes and he asked some questions for his interview.Ill let you go, Maggie.I know youre busy.Congratulations.Maverick Junction is proud of you.Thanks, Mel.She pressed the off button and turned to Brawley.He told you not to forget those photos.I wont.He scooped up a forkful of baked potato.Eat.Your foods getting cold.Dinner ended, and Zandra and Owen caught cabs.Jarvis made noises about sharing a private celebration with Maggie, but she cried off, claiming exhaustion.The tension between him and Brawley had grown palpable, testosterone and animosity oozing from both.When Jarvis hailed a taxi, she stood at the curb, relief flooding her as it pulled away.Her mom and dad had an early flight and wanted to get to bed.Ty and Sophie had rented a car and intended to steal three days in the Poconos for the honeymoon they hadnt quite managed between kids and work.Annie and Cash planned to drive to Boston for a quick visit with her family before going back home.Dottie and Pops?She couldnt quite believe it, but they were flying southto Disney World.Theyd both wanted to visit there forever and were finally going to do it.Maggie was glad.As happy as shed been to see them all, it broke her heart to say good bye to everyone.Hugs, kisses, and tears made the rounds.Thank you, Daddy, for coming all this way for me.Its not every day our little girl makes history.Her dads arms, warm and reassuring, enveloped her.How could we not share it with you?She hugged him back.I love you.She stood on the sidewalk outside the restaurant waving as her friends and family climbed into cabs and headed to their hotels.And then it was just her and Brawley.The night echoed around them.Taxis, horns, and sirens.Neon signs.Jostling people.A full moon directly above the spire of the Empire State Building.Brawley Maggie They laughed.Go ahead.Ladies first.I really am glad you came today.Thank you for that and the lilacs and for my little scissors.She patted her purse where shed tucked the charm safely away.Youre welcome.For everything.He reached for her hand, and she took his, aware of the energy radiating off him.His warmth seeped through her.This man did things to her insides that no one else ever had.Heres the thing, Mags.Im wondering if you and I could hang up the gloves for a day.But Today was good.Confused, she said, Yes, it was.Id like to spend a day as unguarded friends.Friends who dont have to weigh everything they say before they say it for fear of offending, of stepping on toes.He tipped his head and studied her.Weve been doing that a long time, havent we?Yes, maam.And I generally end up having my head bitten off and handed to me on a silver platter.Have I really been that bad?Youve had your moments.She laughed.Yes, I guess I have.She laced their fingers.Im thinking I could skip my conference tomorrow.Her brow arched.Like you did today?He chuckled and raised her hand to his lips.She wondered if real women actually swooned.At this moment, she considered it a strong possibility.Yeah, like I did today.Ill skip my conference another day.Lets do New York, Maggie.Lets play tourist.The two of us.We can ride one of those double decker buses, take the ferry to Staten Island, climb the Statue of Liberty, and eat pizza in Times Square.Lets do it all.After a stunned heartbeat, she said, Id like that.I never did get my play day.Not even when Mom was here.Zandra and I already decided wed indulge ourselves.Take a day off to chill, then hit it hard again.Without warning, he kissed her, long and deep.Rattled, she fought for equilibrium.Um, will you, ah, pick me up?Yep.Bring foodand coffee.He nodded, then hailed a cab for her.When it pulled to the curb, he opened her door, helped her in, then walked off down the street, whistling.Maggie waved as they passed him.She had a date tomorrow.With her urban cowboy.Twenty Four  True to his word, Brawley showed up at her door the next morning with coffee and a bag of fresh bagels.Dressed in jeans, a crisp blue shirt with cuffs rolled up to show off his strong forearms, and his signature dark glasses, he made her awfully glad she was the one seeing the town with him today.He could have commanded a fortune as a male model.He held up the bag.You have a toaster, dont you?I sure do.She led him inside.He let out a slow whistle.This is nice, Red.Really nice.I love it.My first place.He moved around her apartment, taking in the layout and dcor.Stepping to the sofa table, he studied the photos shed arranged there.He picked up one of him and her with Tys boys.When was this?She felt foolish and wished shed put it away before he came.Sophie took it.The day Trouble got into, well, troublewith the rattler.That could have turned out badly.We got lucky.He set it down.This is your first home alone, isnt it?he said.Youve been with your folks or Pops.Pathetic, huh?No.Unselfish.I understand why you went to Lone Tree instead of moving out on your own.Youre a good person, Maggie Sullivan.Heat flared over her face.Dont paint any halos on me.Oh, no!He laughed.Id never do that.Youre far from angelic.She punched both him and the button on the toaster.They sat in her tiny kitchen and ate breakfast, talked about their agenda for the day.Brawley cleaned up while she fetched her purse and shoes.Shed decided on black capris and a black and white geometric top.If they intended to crawl all over the city, dark seemed her best option.Ready?he asked.Yes.Then lets get this show on the road.An hour later, hands raised overhead, the wind blowing her hair, Maggie enjoyed the sights from the top of a double decker sightseeing bus.She couldnt remember the last time shed felt so carefree.Beside her, Brawley grinned, whipped out a camera, and took a picture of her.She groaned.Lose that thing.No way.Im a tourist.She snorted.True to his word, Brawley bought tickets for the ferry to Liberty Island and climbed all three hundred fifty four steps with her.Bet youre glad you wore sneakers today, huh?He glanced down at her feet.Sure do love those legs in heels, though.So not practical for today.They stood side by side taking in the view from inside Lady Liberty.When his arm slid around her waist and he drew her close, she laid her head on his shoulder, breathing deeply.He smelled so good.So Brawley.I like the easy way you slide between mile high stilettos and cowboy boots, Red.It keeps things interesting.Im never sure which woman is going to show up.I hadnt thought about it.I have.They stood another moment, enjoying the closeness.His lips close to her ear, he asked, Ready to head down?She nodded.On the ferry, headed back to the mainland, Brawley leaned against the rail and watched as the colossal statue grew smaller.Three hundred and fifty copper pieces shipped in two hundred and fourteen crates.Now thats what Id call some assembly required.A parents Christmas Eve nightmare.And batteries not included.Maggie grinned.You know what surprised me most?That the copper surface is only two pennies thick.Thats pretty amazing.Yet there she stands, guarding our harbor.He laid a hand on his stomach.Im hungry.Time for lunch.They took a cab to Times Square to find Brawleys pizza.She fed him a piece of pepperoni from hers.When his lips closed over her fingers, she caught her breath.Brawley Maggie?Clearing her throat, she started to remind him they were friends today.Period.But the words stuck, wouldnt pop free.She shook her head.Forget what you were going to say?Something like that.He hand fed her a bite of his sausage pizza.Having fun?I am, yes.Im having a great time.She planted her elbows on the table and rested her chin in her hands.Is there anywhere youre not at home, Brawley?His forehead creased.Thats a strange question.Carelessly, she shrugged one shoulder.You always seem so at ease.So comfortable with who you are.He smiled.Im happiest when Im riding a horse in the Texas hills.Im probably most at home in the clinic working with my animals.But, yeah, Im okay with all this, too.I like cities and what they have to offer.I enjoyed my time in Dallas.You looked good yesterday.So did you.His voice deepened.What do you say we grab a couple tickets for one of the off Broadway shows?They did.They laughed, she cried, and when it was over, Brawley saw her home, then, after a very friendly kiss, he left to go back to his hotel.She stood in the center of the sidewalk and watched his taxi weave through the traffic.Today had been wonderful.Shed rediscovered the Brawley shed grown up with, an older, easier version of the boy shed fallen in love with.She missed him already, and wasnt that a kick in the pants?Heading inside, she told herself to get used to it.This was her new reality.It included more perks than she deserved, but it didnt include Brawley.Well, shed take a shower, change into her pajamas, and get a good nights sleep.Tomorrow would be busy.She hoped.Owen had texted her several times during the day, and sales appeared to be through the roof.Shed just turned on the shower when her phone pinged.She opened Brawleys text.My last night in NYC, Mags.Flying out in the morning.Miss me?She did.Her fingers flew over the keys.Dinner at 8.My place.Unless you have other plans.She hit send and waited.Nothing.No response.Disappointed, knowing it was for the best, she took a quick shower, then sat down at her computer.She scanned the orders flooding in.Owen was right.The collection was a hit.Bigger than shed ever imagined.Yet her heart was heavy.How pathetic!Her phone beeped.Missed your message earlier.Am I still welcome?You bet.She raced into the kitchen.What would she feed him?She opened one of the containers of leftovers from the other night and sniffed it.Probably not.A mad dash to the corner deli netted everything she needed.Brawley showed up right at eight.Hungry?she asked when he walked in.Yeah.But not for food.He leaned in, kissed her neck.Maggie, sweetheart, I need you.Dinner can wait.She moved into his arms, met his lips.They fell onto the sofa, a tangle of arms and legs.Panting, laughing, she pulled back.I have a bed.How far away is it?he breathed.By the time they made it to her room, Brawley had both their shirts unbuttoned.He picked her up and gently placed her on the bed, then knelt and very slowly removed her shoes.His hand ran over each foot, a finger gliding over the arch, making her moan.His lips followed, and she thought shed die.Oh, hed been good in high school.But since then?Hed undoubtedly earned a doctorate in the art of lovemaking.One side of his mouth kicked up in a wicked grin.Margaret Emmalee Sullivan, I want you to the point of aching.I want you in every way possible.He lowered himself to her, melding his body lengthwise to hers, pressing her into the bed.His hand slid between their bodies and peeled her top from her, his knuckles grazing her breasts.And then he kissed her.Kissed her till she was drowning in it.She met him and demanded more.Its been so long, Mags.He breathed the words into her ear.I know.He laced their fingers, stretching their arms overhead, exposing her body to him.His breathing ragged, he said, Now.Maggie nearly cried when he entered her, when they became one again after all the years.Then she simply quit thinking and welcomed Brawley home.Spent, they lay together amidst the rumpled bedding.I dont think I can move, he finally said.Me, either.My bones have melted.That good, huh?Dont start crowing.Wouldnt think of it.He patted her bare bottom and rested his chin on the top of her head.God, you smell good.Id like to return that compliment.No, you dont.Men arent supposed to smell good.Were supposed to smell manly.Like rawhide.Like Like youve been working out in the sun all day?Thats good, too, she snuggled into him.I have to ask.Did you make a stop at Arnolds before you left Maverick Junction?She felt the soundless laughter travel through his body.For condoms?She nodded.I havent bought them there in the last ten years or so.How many boys do you think have visited that gas station before date night?Maggie asked.More than you want to know.He nuzzled the side of her neck.I have another in my wallet.Want to take it for a ride?Oh, yes.Please.Maggie had never had any man focus on her the way Brawley did, as though her pleasure, not his, was the ultimate goal.Yet a tiny doubt niggled at the back of her mind.No matter how hard she pushed, it wouldnt go away.Brawley, whats going on here?Between us.What do you mean?She tried to slide away, to put a little distance between them, but he threw an arm around her waist and drew her back.The feel of him against her did crazy things to her, but she fought to stay focused.Tell me this isnt some kind of game for you.Some bet youve made with yourself.He stiffened beside her, but she continued.Its been a long time since we were together like this.A lot of years have passed.Why now?You wouldnt give me the time of day before, Maggie.If you recall, Ive tried.More than once.It was you who held back.She wanted to argue that, but honesty wouldnt let her.He had indeed held out the olive branch before, and shed taken her clippers to it.Still How many serious relationships have you had?she asked.Besides you?Besides me.None.Skeptical, she asked, How many women have you given a drawer in your house?A key.None.Really?She turned her head to study him, realized that put their lips too close together.She moved slightly to stare up at the ceiling.How about you?His breath tickled her ear.It hasnt fit.Ive lived with either my parents or Pops.No overnighters at my place.She shrugged.Ive had a couple flings.Youd know all about those.So were both virgins.Virgins?She almost choked on the word.After what we just did?I dont think Virgins when it comes to serious.To living with someone, yes.I was your serious, wasnt I?he asked.Reluctantly she nodded.My one and only.So what?We both win a blue ribbon?Ohh, a little prickly.No, Im justI dont want to get hurt again.Understood.After a minute, she said, You know, when you came into the shop screaming at me Shouting.What?Men dont scream.We shout.She rolled her eyes heavenward.Grant me patience.He chuckled.So, she started again.When you came into my boutique shouting at me, I was furious.You wouldnt talk to me.Wouldnt communicate.It had been way too long.Well, that sure woke me up.It gave my customers plenty to talk about, too.I am sorry about that, but I probably wouldnt do it any differently even if I could.I was pissed that you hadnt shared your big news with me.They lay together in the darkened apartment, listening to the night sounds.I really do have to go back tomorrow, Mags.Brawley brushed aside a strand of hair and kissed her neck.Doc Gibson and Phyllis are taking care of things at the clinic, and my mom and dad are babysitting Marvin.I still cannot believe you named that dog Marvin.Its a good name.If you say so.Actually, I named him after Lee Marvin.When she stared blankly at him, he said, You know.The actor.Now talk about a manly man.Marvin played Kid Shelleen, a legendary gunfighter in Cat Ballou, and Tim Strawn, the hired killer Kids supposed to off.Double role.The hero and the villain both.It won him the Academy Award for best actor.Cat Ballou?Yeah.1965.I love that movie.Youre weird, Brawley.She sighed.Im sorry you have to go, but I understand.And I know you have to stay.She nodded and stretched.So tell me again about this conference you flew here to attend.The one you skipped out on to come to my showingand play tourist.The streetlight outside her window slanted its muted glow across the bed, and she saw color wash over his face.There wasnt any conference was there?Yes, actually there was.Did you register?Pay to attend?Yes.Did you go to any of it?He shook his head.Why?You promise not to tell anybody?She sent him a quizzical look.He put a hand to his ear.I cant hear you.Okay, okay.I promise.The conference was on panda bears.She blinked.Excuse me?Voice gruff, he said, You heard me.Panda bears?It was the only one I could find in the city this week.But that makes no sense, Brawley.Sure it does.He tugged her close and nibbled at her neck.You told me I couldnt come.I didnt sayOhhh, Brawley.I cant think when you do that.She ran her fingers through his hair, drew him closer still.Good.I dont want you to think.Just feel.He kissed her forehead, the tip of her nose.Youre beautiful, Maggie.Youre not so hard on the eyes, either.She ran her tongue over his bottom lip.Be quiet, Maggie.Okay.And she let him pull her under, to a place where only the touch of his hands, his lips, the scent of him existed.She gave herself up to him, thought shed die for wanting more.The first time had been hard and fast, the second more leisurely.This time, Brawley more than took his time.He drove her crazy with his slow caresses and long, drawn out kisses.His arms wrapped around Maggie, Brawley pressed his face into her hair and breathed in her unique scent.He ran a hand along her waist, down her hip, her leg.The woman was smooth as silk, soft as dandelion fluff.What are you thinking about?she asked.You, he whispered.And how incredibly lucky I am to be here with you.He felt her smile in the dark.How about you?My thoughts are running along that same track.She turned in his arms, molded her body to his, and buried her face in his chest.She kissed the spot over his heart.Ive missed you.Oh, Mags.A finger beneath her chin, he lifted her face to his, took her mouth.Fire raged again, and he was lost.When they finally surfaced, voice ragged, he said, I might have a coronary here.He put a hand to his chest.You do things to me.Things I cant even begin to describe.She snuggled in with a sexy little purr.Whats going on with Ty and Sophie?Things seemed a little, I dont know, strained between them, she said.Sophie wants to have a baby.Maggie went quiet on him.He pulled back and rose on one elbow, tried to read her face in the moonlight that filtered through the partially opened blinds.Maggie?Hmmm?Whats wrong?Nothing, she said quickly.Absolutely nothing.Of course she wants a baby of her own.Thats what I told Ty.He has a problem with it?She sounded surprised.Hes scaredand you didnt hear that from me.Scared?Maggie frowned.Why on earth She stopped.Oh, my God, of course he is.Hes afraid hell lose her like he did Julia.Yep.Sophies not Julia.No, shes not.Julia had a heart problem long before her pregnancy.I reminded Ty of that, but I dont think logic figures into this.For him, its a deep down emotional trigger.Any man would worry about the woman he loved.But with Ty, hes lost his first love.Hes afraid to risk his second.Maggie stirred beside him, swiped the hair from her face.Would you worry about me?she asked.Darlin, Id worry myself sick.She went still.What?He saw her eyes close.Hey, dont worry.I dressed for the occasion tonight, remember?Every time.We didnt make a baby.Not tonight.Her words were so quiet he wasnt sure hed heard her correctly.Excuse me?She lay absolutely still.Not tonight.
