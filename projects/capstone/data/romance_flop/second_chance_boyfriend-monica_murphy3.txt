Too late to meet with you after.Reaching out, she pushes at my chest, her slender hands resting on my front, and I hiss in a breath as if shes burned me.But shit!It feels like she has.Having her hands on me again after so long, its as if shes branding me.Making her claim with just a touch.She has no idea Ive belonged to only her for months.Without thought I lean in, my lips going for hers, but she turns her head at the last second and I end up kissing her cheek instead.Shes quivering, little shuddering breaths escape from her parted lips, and I close my eyes, desperate to calm the pounding of my heart as I nuzzle the side of her face.I really fucked up, didnt I?I whisper against her skin.Fable nods, draws in a deep breath as her hands drop away from my chest.You did.Tell me what I can do to make it up to you.I need to know.I cant let her think this is over between us.She still keeps her face averted, as if shes afraid to look me in the eyes.Its too late.Theres nothing you can do.Its o over between us.I remove my hand from the wall to cup her cheek, forcing her to look at me.Those big, scared eyes meet mine and for a moment Im lost.Its as if were back in time and at my parents guesthouse when we were about to embark on something big.Something serious.I had this girl in the palm of my hand and she had me.But I was such a chickenshit, I let her slip right out of my grip, and now look at her.Shes different.Her entire life has changed in a matter of weeks.And I had nothing to do with it.Shes moved on, while Im still stuck.The realization is staggering.I need to get back to work, she whispers.You should go back to your friends.I stroke her face, let my fingers trace the delicate line of her jaw.She closes her eyes.I notice the subtle movement of her throat as she swallows and I dip my head, this time making that connection I so desperately want.My mouth on hers, breathing her breath, tasting her lips, the sweet, mysterious depths within.She parts her lips immediately and I take advantage, slipping my tongue inside, tangling it with hers.A groan escapes me and she breaks the kiss first, our eyes opening at the same time, and we stare at each other without saying a word, her gaze dropping to my mouth again.I know what she wants.I want it, too.We cant resist each other.This one moment is proof.I need to do something, say something to continue this connection.I need her.And she needs me.I know it.Fable.Everything okay?We both turn our heads to see some guy standing a few feet away, big and intimidating, dressed all in black, his gaze sharp as it lingers on me.He looks like he wants to kick my ass.Great.After his interruption, the feelings mutual.Im fine.Just getting back to work.She shoves at me and I step back, letting her escape.Just like that.Fable doesnt look at me as she heads into the restaurant.Doesnt say a word to me or the guy and were left outside alone, glaring at each other, sizing each other up.Hes older, at least in his late twenties, and big.But Im taller.And broader.I could take him if I had to.That Im thinking like this is totally ridiculous.Who the hell are you?he asks, his voice quiet but edged with steel.I could ask you the same question, I toss back.He crosses his arms in front of him.Im her boss.Shit!I dont want to screw up anything at her job.This place is nice, way nicer than La Salles, and I bet she likes working here a lot more.Bet she makes more money, too.Im her boyfriend.He lifts his brows, a little chuckle escaping him.Really?Funny, she didnt mention you when we were together last night.Im so fucking shocked by what the asshole says that by the time I find my voice, hes gone.Fable I hurry back to the private party room, thankful Drew doesnt follow me.Even more thankful Colin doesnt follow me either.I wish I could sneak off to the bathroom to gather my thoughts, take a deep breath, something, anything, but I need to get back and help Jen.Its not fair, leaving T in there helping out when she should be supervising the restaurant.But I cant stop shaking.Breathing deep, I can smell him.Drews familiar clean scent clings to my skin and my clothes.I press my lips together, run my tongue over them.God, I can still taste him.Hes all over me and I dont know if I can stand it.The words he said, how my body reacted when he touched me, when he kissed me I want him.But I dont.Hes put me through hell and back and with one glimpse of him and a few whispered words, Im lost.Drew Callahan is my absolute weakness.Like a drug I cant get enough of.Hes my addiction and if Im being honest with myself, Im not looking to kick that particular habit anytime soon.Slipping inside the room, I see Jen standing in the corner closest to the door by herself.T mustve left, and I immediately feel like crap.Are you okay?she asks me as I approach.Jens low spoken question pulls me out of my Drew addled head and I offer her a reassuring smile.Im fine.Just tired.The guys are leaving.She studies me, her dark gaze careful.I heard about what they said.Theyre assholes, Fable.Dont let them bother you.Great.So they were still talking about how much of a slut I am.In front of my new co worker and potential friend.Maybe what they said is true.I square my shoulders and stiffen my spine.Trying for defiant and probably failing miserably.I dont care.Jen shrugs.Who am I to judge?I think I could like this girl.Could possibly consider her a friend, and I dont remember the last time I had a close female friend.We watch as the guys stroll out of the room, the majority of them offering us leering stares as they pass.The birthday boy is the only one who shoots us a semi apologetic look when he approaches, then slaps a one hundred dollar bill into my palm and another one in Jens simultaneously.Well.That made the insufferable evening a little more worth it.Just barely.Were continuing the party elsewhere.This place has turned into a drag.Ty stops directly in front of me, blowing his beer breath in my face.I wrinkle my nose in disgust.Wanna come with us?Bring your friend?Well show you both a good time, I promise.Screw off, jackass, Jen mutters, startling Ty.And me.Grinning, I tilt my head toward her.You heard the lady.See ya later.He glares at us for a long, quiet moment, his nostrils flaring before he flees the room, leaving us completely alone.What a jerk!Jen says, shaking her head.I cant believe hes so Blatant?Rude?All that, wrapped up in disgusting slimeball.What a waste.What do you mean?I start cleaning up the room, as does Jen.Hes not bad looking.A complete waste of a handsome face.She shrugs.The bigger assholes are usually the really good looking ones, Ive noticed.She has a valid point.Colin strides into the room, his gaze alighting on me as if hes been searching for me for days.Whos the guy you were talking to?Im taken aback by his question, the tone of his voice.What does it matter?I ask warily.Jens watching us; I can see her out of the corner of my eye.I really dont want to be having this conversation with her as a witness.Jen, could you give us a few minutes of privacy?Why dont you help out in the bar for a bit?Colin suggests, his gaze never leaving mine.She leaves without a word, and were alone.The noise from the restaurant diminishes and I shift on my feet, waiting for the axe to fall.Hes going to fire me.And on the very day I finally felt comfortable enough to give notice at La Salles.I bet I could beg for my old job back if I had to.I dont like having boyfriends sniffing around my restaurant staff in a proprietary manner, Colin says.His words startle the crap out of me.Boyfriends?Who are you talking about?The guy I caught you with outside.He told me hes your boyfriend.My lips part but nothing comes out.Im still so disgusted by what Ty said to me and Jen, I thought at first Colin was talking about him.But he was referring to finding Drew and me together outside.Drews arms around me, holding me close, kissing me.Not anymore, I finally say because as far as Im concerned, were not together.We never really were.But Drew said he was my boyfriend?This baffles me.Well, maybe you should explain that to him.Last I saw, he was still hanging around outside.Almost like hes waiting for you.The disgust on Colins face is clear.He doesnt want to deal with my personal problems lingering around his business.Not that I can blame him.I feel like an absolute screw up.Im sorry.Do you mind if I go see if hes still around?I can tell him to leave.Such a weak excuse.I just want to catch a glimpse of him again.By all means, get rid of him.Colin waves a hand toward the door.I start to go but he stops me, grabbing hold of my arm before I exit the room.If this becomes a problem, you become a problem.You do realize this, right?I nod, embarrassment making me want to run.But I face him head on, my gaze meeting his.I want him to know Im not about to risk my job over a guy.Theyre so not worth it.I understand.Im sorry.It wont happen again.Better not.His voice gentles, as does his touch, and he slowly releases his hold on my arm.I like you, Fable.I dont want to have to lose you because of your personal problems.Ouch.His honesty hurts, but I need to face up to the fact that I caused some trouble tonight.The fight happened because of me.Yeah, the guys had been drunk, but the arguing all stemmed from me.My slutty and not so slutty past is catching up to me and messing with my future.I hurry down the narrow hall that leads to the back door and push it open, coming out into the alley to find myself alone.Drew is gone.Glancing toward the parking lot, I see him with the rest of the jerks.For whatever stupid reason, I feel betrayed.He doesnt really like those guys.Never felt as if he fit inhe admitted that to me during our one week together.So whats he doing?Why is he with them?I watch in disbelief as he climbs into the car of one of the other guys, leaving his truck in the parking lot.Hes actually going with them.Im stunned.Irritated.Without thought I stalk back into the restaurant, seeking out Colin.I find him in the front, at the hostess station, and I go to him, tapping him on the shoulder so he turns around to face me.The problems been taken care of, I say with more finality than I actually feel.Im lying to Colin since I didnt talk to Drew, but Im not too far off base.No way is Drew coming back here to bug me.I wont let him.You talked to him.He raises a skeptical brow.I nod.Sure did.Told him not to bother coming back.That we dont want any trouble.Colin is contemplating me.Looking at me like Im completely full of shit.Which I am.He comes back here, Im going to be mad.At you and him.I know.I swallow hard.I dont like trouble at my restaurant.I dont like my employees dating each other, and I dont like jealous boyfriends and girlfriends lingering around, waiting to catch their significant others in a bad position.Im sick of that crap.You need to walk the straight and narrow, Fable, if youre going to work here.I know I cant tell you what to do on your personal time, but your business time?My time?I expect you to adhere to my rules.What a drill sergeant.His words and his attitude surprise me.He usually seems so laid back.I get it.Im sorry.It wont happen again.Colin nods and without another word, leaves me where Im standing.I can almost guarantee its never going to happen again because Im so pissed at Drew, I dont want to see him ever again.He left with those guys.Hes off fucking around and doing whatever crazy, stupid thing a bunch of oversexed, drunken jocks do on a Saturday night.Probably going to drink and flirt and mess around just like all the rest of them.Tears sting my eyes and I blink them away.I dont own him.I rejected him outright only moments before.Gave him a free pass to do whatever the hell he wants.So why am I so upset?Why do I feel like he somehow still belongs to me?Dont give up just because things are hard.Fable Maguire  Drew They brought me to a strip club thats on the outskirts of town, the building nondescript and small, the sign flashy and bright in the otherwise dark, cold night.Gold Diggers is what the place is called.Ive heard of it before but have never been there.Usually Id protest, bail on them, whatever.But when Jace asked if I wanted to ride with him here, I readily agreed.Didnt help that I was still blown away by what Fables fucking boss said to me.Her boss.Shes messing around with her boss.I cant believe it.The devastation that still lingers within me is strong.Like bring me to my knees powerful.I dont know what to think.I cant think.It hurts too damn much.So I left.Running away from my problems as per my usual mode.Funny thing is, this time Ive surrounded myself with other people.Guys I know and would like to consider my friends.I wonder if my shrink would be proud of me for at least this part of my denial.Im definitely a little drunker than I was when we first arrived, and Im still angryat Ty for insulting Fable.At Fable for pushing me away.I cant win.Avoiding her led me straight to her.It was inevitable that wed see each other again.But how could I have prepared myself for the shock of seeing her there, looking so beautiful?It made me so angry, believing shes still mine when shes already moved on.Pain lances through me and I let it, soaking the near physical emotion the same way my body is soaking up the alcohol.I hate letting my emotions control me so completely.Im usually numb to this sort of thing.Enduring what I went through in my past made it easy for me to throw up barriers and pretend everything was fine or more like nothing mattered.She matters, though.Or at least, she did.So Im sulking like a baby as I watch half naked women gyrate on a stage, their bodies on blatant display, their expressions bored, looking like theyve done this sort of thing a million times and they hate it, which they probably do.The club is packed, were probably the youngest guys there, and the beer is flowing.Straight down my throat, as fast as I can drink it.Having fun?Logan nudges me, the leer on his face wobbly.Hes drunker than I am fitting, since hes the one were celebrating.May as well get shitfaced like him, right?Ive got nothing to lose and nothing but sorrows to drown.Woe is me.Ive turned into the worst sort of broken record.I shrug.The beers good.Logan laughs.The beer is shit.The women are fine.They all have great racks.He tips his head toward a dark skinned girl dancing not twenty feet away from where we sit.Tys arranging a lap dance for me with her.I scowl.Hearing Tys name irritates me.Weve sat on opposite ends of the group the entire time, no interaction between us whatsoever.Probably best, considering if he comes near me again, I might hit him.And keep on hitting him until hes bloody and broken.Only then would I feel an ounce of satisfaction.Though why I keep wanting to defend Fable when shes out fucking around with another guy while I mourn the loss of her, I dont know.Fuck.Im sure he could arrange a lap dance for you, too, Logan continues.Hell, no.I dont want one.I shake my head and down the rest of my beer in one swallow.I feel hot.My head is spinning.Im definitely losing control and for once, I dont really care.That you say you dont want one only makes me want to get you one even more.I turn to see Ty standing there, beer in hand, smirk in place.I want to slap that shitty look off his face but I remain calm.Nonchalant.Why would you want to waste your money on a lap dance for me?Get one for yourself.Ty laughs.I want to see you squirm, Callahan.I know this isnt your scene.Hell, Im surprised youre here with us.Im even more surprised at how you tried to kick my ass over a stupid girl.I say nothing.Im surprised, too, but Im not going to let on that I am.You know Fable?Been with her or something?Ty shakes his head.I took her out once, a long time ago.It was mostly forgettable.If he so much as goes into detail about their supposedly forgettable date, Ill bash his face in.I dont know her that well, I bite out, every word sharp because Im a complete liar.But you dont disrespect women, Ty.Its an asshole thing to do.Ive never said I was anything but an asshole.The smirk on Tys face slowly disappears.Thats why I already got you that lap dance, buddy.With a pretty little blonde who reminded me of our mutual friend.He flicks his head and I turn around.Hi.She smiles at me, all bright and fake, and Im momentarily taken aback.She does eerily resemble Fable at first glance, much like my fake classmate Fable, but then I realize shes nothing like the girl Im in love with.This fake Fable is taller and skinnier, with shorter hair and bad skin.Her nails are long and painted neon pink.She tosses her hair behind her shoulder and thrusts her chest out, her hard nipples poking against the thin fabric of her neon pink bikini top.Ty plants his hand in the middle of my back and shoves me toward her.Arent you going to greet your present?You need to respect women and all that other shit you talk about, right?Asshole.You dont have to do this, I tell her, ignoring Tys snicker.I glance around, looking for Logan, but hes long gone.Probably off getting his own dance.The girl frowns.He paid me to do it.Its my job.Just keep the money, I tell her, reaching out to grab her arm so I can take her somewhere else.Somewhere we can pretend this is happening instead of putting on a show for everyone.She shakes her head, touching my chest with her free hand.Dont you like me?I study her, my vision blurry.If I squint, she could almost pass for Fable.She strokes my forearm, her light touch sending a shiver through me.Come on, she murmurs, her voice low.Seductive.No way should I do this, but I let her lead me over to a chair and she pushes my chest so I have no choice but to sit.I fall into the chair heavily, my head spinning, and the music starts as the woman on the stage begins to move.Just like the woman in front of me.For a moment, I let my imagination run away from me.Instead of a stranger, its Fable in front of me.Dancing for me, so beautiful as she moves, her lips curved in a seductive smile, her eyes glowing as she watches me.I stare back, my mouth going dry, my skin tight and hot I hear Tys unmistakable laugh, snapping me back to reality.The girl smiles at me, her hands on my shoulders, her barely covered breasts in my face as she twists and turns to the beat of the music.Her hips roll and thrust toward me as she reaches behind her back, deftly undoing both straps on her bikini top so it falls from her chest and lands on the floor.She has small breasts and big nipples, nothing like Fables.Of course shes nothing like her.I need to stop comparing all women to her.Its a mistake.Hell, its a sickness.One I need to cure myself of and quickly, since she already has someone else.The realization makes me almost sick to my stomach.Put your tits in his face!Ty yells and she tosses her hair and laughs, thrusting her chest directly in my face as Ty commanded, her skin brushing against mine.I smell sweat, cheap perfume, and alcohol emanating from her pores and I wrinkle my nose.This girl is nothing like mine.Shes nothing like any sort of girl Id ever be interested in.Youre hot, the dancer whispers and I tilt my head back, our gazes locking.Want to hook up after I get off work?My shift ends in an hour.I slowly shake my head.I dont think so.That she solicits me so easily makes me think this isnt her first time doing this sort of thing.She pouts.I bet you have a girlfriend, right?All the quiet, good looking ones do.Yeah, I have a girlfriend.A fake one, one I lost claim to months ago.But its easier to agree than to explain myself.Her pout turns into a deep frown.Im sure your friend who bought you the dance is available, huh?Im sure most girls wouldnt tolerate his crap for long.The girl is perceptive.Shes danced for me for three minutes tops and has both of us all figured out.Hes definitely available.She grimaces.Of course he is.The song ends, as does my dance, and she steps away from me, a little smile curving her lips.I never noticed until now that her lipstick color matches the neon pink of her bikini and fingernails.She glows in the black lights, giving her a weird and unnatural effect.Youre quite the gentleman.She bends over and snatches her bikini top from the floor.Take that as a compliment.Thanks, I say weakly, immobile in my chair.My head is still spinning.I drank way too much and Im almost afraid to stand.I might collapse like an idiot.For the dance and the compliment.Flashing me a smile, she wiggles her fingers at me, then heads over to Ty.He immediately grabs her like shes his piece of property.His hands are sprawled across her back and butt as he hauls her close into him.She hasnt even put her top back on yet and hes got his hands all over her, his mouth at her ear.She shoves at his chest and Im tempted to go and tell her to get away from him, but then I hear her giggle and I know she likes it.Likes him.Disgusted with myself, I stand and glance around the room, waiting for the spinning to ease.Its so dark and there are so many guys in the place, I cant make out whos who.No way could I find my friends in this crowd.I need to get the hell out of here.I need to get home, but Im far from my apartment complex, which is clear on the other side of town.My truck is at the restaurant where Fable works.Im freaking stranded.Frowning, I pull my cell out of my pocket and study the dark screen.I could do it.I practically dare myself to type in the one word that might send her to me.Or that word might make her run away.It should.I dont deserve her help.Deciding to go for it before my balls shrivel up and retreat into my body forever, I tap out eleven letters, spelling a word that both makes me happy and haunts my thoughts.Fable My phone buzzes in my pocket just as Im getting ready to clock out.Its late, the restaurant was packed till the last possible minute, and my feet are killing me.I check my messages and audibly gasp at the one word that seems to fill the screen, daring me to ignore it.Marshmallow Anger surges within me.How dare he use that word?What the hell does he want?Does he need me to rescue him yet again?I cant believe his audacity.But then the worry kicks in, and the anger subsides.What if hes in trouble?Hes with those jerk assholes he doesnt really like and probably shouldnt trust.What if they did something to him and hes lying in a heap on the side of the road, bleeding to death?God, my drama filled brain is on overdrive tonight.Furious at my concern, I hurriedly type in a response to him and hit send before I can second guess myself.Where the hell are you?He answers within seconds.Gold Diggers.Ugh!Hes asking me to rescue him from a strip club?I want to kill him.Like Im driving all the way out there.I dont even have a car.Seconds later, he responds again.I left my truck at the restaurant.Frowning, I study the words he just sent me.I cant do this.I shouldnt.Rescuing him gives me hope, and I should feel hopeless when it comes to Drew.Hes not worth all the heartache and drama.Is he?No key though, I finally type, feeling sorta cheery.How can I drive his truck with no key?You need a ride?I glance up to find Colin standing in front of me, his handsome face filled with concern.My phone beeps and I read Drews message, a detailed description of the exact location where the spare key is hidden on his truck.Tempting me more and more to go rescue him, no matter how stupid I know the idea is.Fable?Yeah, um, thanks for the ride, but I dont need one.I smile, realizing I need Colin to leave before I do if I dont want him to see me drive off in Drews truck.Not that hed know it was Drews truck, but Colin is a smart guy.He can put two and two together real easy.Are you sure?He reaches out and touches me, his fingers drifting across my arm, and I dont react.I mightve yesterday.Hell, I mightve about four hours ago, before Drew walked back into my life so easily, but now theres nothing.Absolutely nothing.Nodding, I offer him a bigger smile.Really.I have a ride.But I appreciate the offer.All right.Jens catching a ride home with me, so well both see you tomorrow?My first Sunday working at the restaurant.My shift starts in the mid afternoon and Ill get off at a decent time, too, since Im only scheduled for four hours.Im sort of excited about it.Owen and I already have plans.Either breakfast, if I can get his lazy ass out of bed, or a late dinner after I get off work.Maybe even a movie if were feeling ambitious.I feel like treating my brother to something special.He deserves it.I havent been around much and neither has Mom.Hes drifting, and I need to reconnect with him.No fourteen year old should drift, especially my own brother.See you tomorrow, I say as I watch Colin leave with Jen by his side.I wonder if theyre a couple.And if they are, why he would flirt with me.Why would he flirt with anyone?I dont understand the dynamics there.I dont understand the dynamics between Drew and me either, so who am I to judge?I pull into the parking lot of Gold Diggers fifteen minutes later, driving around to the side of the building, where I find Drew leaning against the wall.His upper body is slouched forward, his hands nestled deep in his jeans pockets, and his head is bent.It looks like he didnt even hear the truck pull up.Rolling down the passenger side window, I whistle low and he glances up, his gaze meeting mine.Need a ride?I ask, trying my best to keep my voice even, but I hear the slight waver.Did he?I hope not.Pushing away from the building, he saunters over to the truck and leans in through the open window, his arms propped on the ledge.So you found the key.I told you I did.Id texted him when I left work that I was on my way.Did he already forget or what?Sniffing the air, I catch the distinct scent of beer.Hes been drinking.And hes always more of a handful when hes been drinking.Not necessarily in a bad way, though.Not like the guys my mom always ends up dating.Those types are mean and sometimes use their hands to get their point across.Thanks for coming to get me.He pushes away from the truck and pulls on the handle, opening the door so he can climb inside.Settling into the passenger seat, he rolls up the window, pulls the seat belt on and clicks it into place, then leans back against the seat, his eyes closing.I appreciate it.Thats it?Thats all I get?No oh my God, youre my hero, Fable or professions of undying love?Not that I expected the last one, but holy hell, we go from not talking to or seeing each other for over two months to all sorts of conflicting interaction with each other in the span of a few hours.I dont know if I can take this, especially when hes acting like our reunion is no big deal.Need directions to my place?he asks when I pull out of the parking lot.Um, I thought I could go straight to my house.I dont want to take him to his place.Then how would I get home?I cant drive.Im all sorts of fucked up.In more ways than one, I want to tell him, but I keep my lips shut.So what?If I take you home, whos going to take me home?Call your boyfriend.He shrugs, but the venom in his words is clear.My boyfriend?I stop at a red light and turn to look at him.His eyes are open and hes watching me, his expression wary.Who are you talking about?The guy who interrupted us earlier.Your fucking boss, Fable.Or should I say the boss youre fucking?Oh.My.God.Where the hell did he get that idea?I should pull over right now and dump you on the side of the road.Go for it.Ill call the cops and say you stole my truck.Who is this guy?I give him my best, meanest stare, the one that scares the crap out of Owen every time I use it on him.You wouldnt dare.He glares at me right back.Try me.The light turns green and I gun the engine, my foot pressing the gas pedal so hard we both lurch forward in our seat.The truck takes off quickly, the tires squealing against the asphalt, making me wince.Drew is muttering curses under his breath, but I dont care.I ignore him, let the power of the trucks engine propel me down the road, erasing my thoughts until all I feel is the speed.But I cant control my mind, no matter how much I want to.Its awhirl with questions.Why did he think Colin and I were together?Why would Drew text me to come get him if he thought that was the case?Why was he at the strip club?Did he have his hands all over a stripper?I swear I can smell cheap perfume lingering on his clothes.The idea that he was with another girl, had his hands on some stupid stripper even momentarily, fills me with so much rage, my foot presses on the gas pedal even harder.Are you trying to get us into a wreck?His quiet voice pierces my thoughts, reminding me Im driving like a reckless jackass, and I ease up on the gas, evening out to a more moderate speed.Sorry, I murmur, embarrassed that Im acting the fool.My usual mode of operation when Im in Drews presence.Were silent the rest of the drive, with the exception of Drew telling me where to turn to get to his apartment.The neighborhoods gets nicer and nicer the farther and farther I drive.Im filled with envy as I take in the trees that line the street, the perfectly manicured lawns with bright bursts of colorful flowers, even in the middle of winter.Landscapers maintain all of the lawns on this side of town and they are utter perfection.Unlike the grass and yards in my neighborhood, which are uneven and brown in spots.No pretty flowers in sight where I live.We mostly have overgrown shrubs at my apartment complex.They hide all the flaws well.Nice place, I say once I pull into the parking spot he directs me to.Its covered, of course.And the complex is gated, keeping the riffraff out.Like me.Im considered riffraff, Im sure.Do you need to call your boyfriend to pick you up?he asks, his voice low.Downright menacing.I shut off the engine and turn to him, hoping my expression is as incredulous as I feel.I dont have a boyfriend.He raises his brows.So the guy who basically told me to take a hike isnt your boyfriend.Hes not.Hes my boss.Thats it.I slowly shake my head, pissed that I even have to explain myself.Why would he say he was with you last night, then?Im gaping.I cant believe what Drew just said.What?Thats what he told me.He asked who I was and I told him I was your boyfriend.Then he laughed and said something like, where the hell was I since he was with you last night.Drews mouth tightens into a flat, thin line.Were you with him?God, I was.It sounds so bad, too.I dont want to admit the truth, but I cant lie to Drew.There shouldnt be any more lies between us.Honesty needs to be our only policy.Yes, I admit, my voice small.I dont want to tell him Colin took me to a salon and paid for my makeover, a makeover Drew doesnt even seem to notice.He looks away from me, blowing out a harsh breath.His jaw is tight, I see a slight tic in it, and I know hes beyond pissed.Just admit it, Fable.Youve moved on.I cant blame you.I fucked this all up by not responding to you.I asked for this.Asked for what?Im not with my boss, not in the way you think.Were definitely not together.He looks at me again.Youre not?No, I say, slowly shaking my head.Were not.Hes my boss.I wouldnt screw around with my boss.Drew says nothing, but his silence fills up the trucks cab just the same as an endless stream of words would.Listen, you left me, remember?Im finally getting on with my life, moving on from you, and then you go and text me that stupid, stupid code word.You have a lot of nerve, you know.I dont know why I bothered coming out here to rescue you.Accusing me of being with someone else like a complete jealous jerk.I need to call him out on his shit so I can get to the truth.I need the truth.Ive been in limbo waiting for him and hating him, loving him, wanting to kill him, wanting to save him, for way too long.Im done.He either needs to come clean with me and we can get to the bottom of this or well continue swimming in an endless circle that will both drive me crazy and exhilarate me, all at once.I didnt know what to think, he finally says.What he said put thoughts in my head and fucked around with everything.You have no right to accuse me of this crap.I take a deep breath.Drew may have jumped to conclusions, but Im starting to think Colin didnt help matters by implying that somethings going on between us.Which its so not.Who are you going to believe?Some guy you dont know or me?He lifts his lids, his gaze meeting mine.His eyes are bright, even in the dim light of the truck, and I wish I could lean into him.Touch him.Kiss him.You, he whispers.Im going to believe you.Do magic.Enter her heart without touching her.Unknown  Fable Im taken aback by Drews admission, and all I can do is sit here and stare at him.I dont know what to say, how to react, anything.I think Im still in shock that were sitting in his truck, together.Alone.As if the past two months havent happened and were right back where we started.But I know all of his secrets.Well, most of them.And theyre horrible.He knows a few of mine, not that I have many.I was an open book for him from the start.My few remaining secrets arent as life altering as his.My mom is a drunken, jobless loser.My dad has never made contact with me my entire life.Drew already knows those facts about me.Oh, and my brother is skipping class and smoking pot and theres not much I can do about it.Drew doesnt know much about Owen.Or about my own insecurities and fears, how they keep me trapped here in this going nowhere life.How I feel like I have to take care of my little brother all the time because our mom sure as hell isnt doing it.The only thing I can completely control is me and my reaction to my life.At this very moment, I can control only my reaction to Drew.So I sit here and wait.Wait for him to say something first, because Im not speaking until he does.Its his turn to make the next move.Despite the warning bells clanging in my head, I want him to make that first move.Fable, I He pauses and swallows hard.Im not sober enough to drive you home.Disappointment courses through me.There went the first move.Ill call a cab.Like I can afford it, but what the hell else am I supposed to do?No.He shakes his head.I want you to stay with me.Tonight.Everything inside me screams to run far, far away.Theres also a tiny part of me that says I should stay.Crash out on his couch and wake up the next morning refreshed after spending the night in the same house with the one I love.We wont do anything.Maybe well talk.Maybe Ill get him to confess why he asked me to rescue him with that beautiful, tragic note, then refused to answer my texts or voice mails.Yes, I still want an answer in regard to that particular fiasco.I shouldnt, I whisper.Please.He clears his throat.Nothing will happen.I promise.I close my eyes, my thoughts and my wants conflicted.Im at war with myself and I hate it.Maybe I want something to happen.Maybe I want to have outrageous, dirty, mind blowing sex with Drew Callahan.But his words and his gentlemanly ways might overrule him.The guy is downright chivalrous.I really dont want chivalry tonight.I want comfort.Passion.I crave what Drew can give me.Delicious hot kisses, unbelievable pleasure We can talk.He reaches out and settles his hand on my arm.His palm is warm, his fingers slightly rough as they stroke my skin, and instantly my body reacts.Im all tingly and my heart rate has kicked up.I think of how Colin touched me earlier and nothing happened.I think of how Drew merely looks at me and I immediately want to shed my clothes and bare my very soul to him.Talk about what?I need to tell you whatswhats going on.He squeezes my arm and I squeeze my eyes shut, overwhelmed with sensation.God, his touch feels so good.I need to apologize for the shitty way I treated you.An apology is a start in the positive direction.I might be fooling myself, but I want to hear what he has to say.I need an explanation.Okay.Id love to hear an apology from you.Are you going to make me say it now?For the first one, yes.I nod.Theres going to be more than one?I glance in his direction to see hes teasing me.And its sort of cute, the way hes looking at me, the smile on his face.Definitely, I say with another nod.I want the first one now.Before we leave the truck.He schools his expression, looking incredibly solemn and serious.Fable, Im sorry.He lifts my hand and brushes a kiss across my knuckles.His mouth on my skin leaves me weak kneed and Im not even standing.The playful way hes acting doesnt help matters, either.I need to remember hes drunk.Hes not in the right state of mind.Now, come inside with me.I wont try anything, I promise.He makes an X at the center of his chest with his index finger.Scouts honor.Were you really a scout?No.He smiles.But you can trust me.I know I can.I both want him to give me space so I can absorb everything thats happened tonight and want him all over me.Im confused.This is what he does to me every time were together.We get out of the truck and I follow him across the parking lot without protest.Let him guide me to his front door without a word, though I can feel his presence behind me.I inhale sharply when he sets his hand low on my back to steer me in the right direction.He doesnt remove his hand until we get to the front door.Its as if he needs that connection.I need it, too.When he unlocks the door, he indicates for me to walk in first and I enter his quiet, dark apartment.He flicks on a light, revealing a room devoid of anything beyond a couch, a matching chair, and a flat screen TV.There are no pictures, no knickknacks, no mess.Nothing beyond the basic essentials.The room lacks warmth.Its as though no one real lives here.It reminds me of the Drew I first met.That version felt nothing, acted like nothing affected him.Hed been an emotionless shell of a human being.I like to think that I changed him in a matter of days.That I taught him to feel.To open up and deal with his emotions, his wants, and his needs.That my influence taught him it might be okay to be human again.Turning to face him, I study his expression.His eyes are bleary, his hair is mussed, and his cheeks are pale.He looks tired and a little loopy.Yet again, I want to touch him.Touch his bristly cheek, trace his expressive mouth with my finger Do you want to talk?His question startles me.He doesnt look like he wants to talk.More like he probably wants to collapse in bed.Do you?There are things I should say to you, yeah.
