Hey, Im being serious, says Mary.You cant stay in a relationship with no benefits, it will drive you crazy.Mary hugs her friend.Barbara rolls her eyes.She sighs before moving to give Jill a soft hug.Stay strong, girl.If he doesnt give you a jump soon Ill find you somebody who will.Thanks, but no thanks.I see the company that you like to keep.We will work it out.Jill turns to Mary who doesnt move off with them.You coming, Mare?No, I guess I better go down to city hall and face the music.Wish me luck.They hug.Mary watches the two women stagger down the street.She shakes her head and goes the opposite direction.4: Admission      Robert strolls into Samson Oceanfront Park with his best friend.They walk from the park to Sunny Isles beach to lookout at the ocean.Three sailboats appear as small toy boats off in the distance.They pass by people going into the ocean for a swim and find a spot and sit down on the sand.It is 8 oclock in the morning, the sand beginning to heat.They remove their shirts and sit on the beach wearing only board shorts.Jerry looks at Robert.After all that money we made yesterday, man, why are you so sad?Im not sad, says Robert.Im just ...I dont know.Maybe Im just restless.You need a woman.Jerry laughs.Lets go to a strip club tonight.The women over at Tammys are tall, exotic, and beauty queens.Thats what you need, a good lap dance from a beautiful stripper.Robert laughs.He opens his hand to allow a fistful of sand to run through his fingers.No strippers, man.I need a good woman all right, one that will cook and clean and make love like a demon.He looks out at the sailboats.For once, I would like to take a woman out on a boat for a picnic or just go sailing down south.You know what I mean?Yeah, I got you.But this is Miami; the women here only want your money and connections.They will gladly trade sex to get them, but trying to make one of them your wife ...disaster.Believe me, Im an expert on the subject.Youre a little too jaded, my friend.A good woman can hide in a whores drawers; you just have to put in the time to find her.What I wouldnt give for a good woman.Jerrys heart races.The seriousness of his words shows on his face.Man, dont let anybody ever hear you say that.Theyll rob you blind.Im telling you, man, these women are no good for anything long term.Just because you  Yeah, I know!Jerry revisits his horror show.He married his college sweetheart, Jennifer Talbot, the day after graduation.They moved to New York City and he quickly rose as the newest rock star in the Stock Market predictions game.He was the number two stock picker in his firm and earned a $250,000 commission on his biggest stock transaction.All the time he spent on the job meant his new wife had nothing but time on her hands and money to burn.She started her downward spiral by inviting girlfriends on weekend excursions that quickly ate Jerrys bonuses.She then stepped up to strip clubs and wild parties in hotel rooms that led her to have affairs with dancers.Jenny upgraded to affairs with businessmen, including Jerrys boss and eventually to an affair with a powerful celebrity divorce attorney.Heartbroken, he moved back to Florida with his tail between his legs and moved in with Robert.Jerry lost his wife, his condo, 75% of his money, his job and his New York lifestyle.He vowed never again to fall in love, never again to succumb to a beautiful face.Robert and Jerry gaze out at the ocean in silence.Robert turns to watch an older couple in matching sweat suits travel the beach holding hands.He imagines himself at that age with a woman.He wonders who she will be and how will she look.Robert comes to the realization that looks dont matter as long as you have someone you can talk with.He is willing to accept a big girl if she has a nice personality and is willing to work at a solid relationship.Race and nationality dont matter, neither does age except she be able to bear children.Robert has no children.If he doesnt find a wife soon he will resort to surrogacy.Robert runs sand through his fingers and twists his feet into the sand making a hole.He looks at his friend and begins reflecting on their past.The two men grew up in Missouri and their fathers worked for a construction company that moved to Florida when they were eleven.At first they didnt like each other but being both attacked at school for not being Florida natives, they stuck together to have each others back.Robert recounted their college years regretting most of the years.He let some great women slip through his fingers as easily as the sand slipped through them now.Curiosity drove Robert to hire a detective to find these women and was heartbroken on the day the detective handed him a large yellow envelope.Robert opened the envelope to view the pictures.He spread them on his desk and noticed all the happy smiles on the faces of past lovers.They had married good men and often took trips with their children.He saw that one of the women, Cindy, was on a trip to Disney World with her husband and three girls.Another, Rebecca, wore a smile standing next to her husband and two boys on a cruise ship vacationing in the Bahamas.Robert imagined himself in the pictures, thinking he would be so happy to be a part of something that wonderful.He put the pictures back into the envelope and shoved it into a drawer and locked it away.He waited too late; his plan to get rich first and then have a family went sideways.Nothing was going according to his master plan.He went back in time thinking of another woman, Brenda, a woman who worked across from him on one of his first jobs.He broke into a huge grin at the thought of her.He could remember her face, her scent, the way she tilted her head the night she stopped by his workspace and said, They must trust you a lot to let you work by yourself unsupervised.She stunned him into silence.He only uttered excuse me trying to recover.She smiled not knowing the effect she had on him.I said they must trust you to let you work by yourself.Brenda repeated.She was a beautiful black woman with long hairmarried, like all the rest of the good looking women that worked there.Yes, I guess they do, he had said.That started a conversation that led to their speaking and waving as they passed each other.A friendship developed that led to a pivotal night when she asked a girlfriend to go over and give him a message for her.The girlfriend came over and said, You have a secret admirer.Who?he had asked.She pointed to a machine ran by two women.She wants to know if you want to hook up after work today.Flustered, he replied, Ill think about it.The confused girlfriend walked away.He was not sure which of the women was the secret admirer or if it was all a hoax.They loved playing practical jokes on people at this job.So he decided not to take the chance and pursue it out of fear and embarrassment if he responded to the wrong woman.Robert later learned that it was the young lady who had spoken to him often and that her husband had left her and she was available.He kicked himself for not talking to her and now it was too late, she had found a new man.A good woman does not stay single long.Robert thought of all the chances he missed.They will never come around again.They constantly played in his head like a bad movie.A movie he could not get away from no matter how hard he tried.He was a dismal failure.Man, what are you thinking about now?Jerry asks after studying Roberts face.Past mistakes, brother, I am just realizing how many there were.I need to hurry up and make a decision about my future.It doesnt matter what you do, bro, you cant control the other person and that is the real problem.I want a partner not a dog, Jerry.He is mans best friend for a reason, loyalty, bro.Lets go to the club.Robert climbs to his feet.Now youre talking my language, says Jerry.They hop aboard a bus that stops in front of the park and ride it to the strip club.They enter; each exchanges a $50 bill for singles.They enter the main room to sit five feet from a big chested brunette in the middle of her show.Jerry throws some singles at her and calls for a server.They sit, drink, and throw singles the rest of the day.5: First Look      Three days later:      On Monday morning, Mary is at the Belmont Hotel.Becoming good friends with the owners wife propelled her career in management.One of the hotels steadiest workers, she has never missed a day of work.When the old office manager retired she became assistant manager of the night shift.Mary now does conference scheduling and the hiring and firing for the day shift.She hired Jill as an assistant but later had to fire her because she would not do the work.Rather than have an unemployed roommate Mary gave her a job as a housekeeper.Jill is happy, in fact, thriving at her new job.Her other friend, Barbara, received a promotion from housekeeper service to hotel desk clerk.A 55 year old woman enters the hotel lobby.Her short brown hair is turning gray and her leathery skin is peeling from years of sunbathing.She doesnt see Mary so she waltzes to the front desk clerk.Good morning, I am looking for Mary Lake.Have you seen her on duty today?May I enquire about whom is asking please?asks Barbara.Forgive me, dear, she adds the last word with a disdainful sneer.I am, Debbie Cartwright, the city clerk.I have personal business to discuss with Miss Lake.Is she here today?Can you wait here a moment?Barbara asks.Yes.Barbara has another clerk watch the front desk while she hurries around the corner to the executive offices.She raps on the Office Managers door then ventures inside.Mary, there is a woman from the city clerks office outside.She says it is personal business she has to discuss with you.Mary sits behind her desk planning next weeks convention meeting.A silent sigh draws her frame high.Show her in please.Barbara brings the woman to Mary.Anything I can get either of you.No, Barbara that will be all.Please close the door behind you.Mary rises to greet the woman.I am sorry to come to your place of work but there has been a change in your work schedule.Like what?You will not be on cleanup detail.I have permission to have you assist me with donations and charity work for a party at the end of the week.It wont affect your work schedule; we will do our work around your schedule.Mrs.Cartwright, I work a 12 hour day.How many hours are you talking about?I know how many hours a day you work, dear.Dont forget that it is your fault I am here in the first place.If you would rather be in jail then say so.Mrs.Belmont is on our board and assures me that you can participate.You talked to my boss?Mary says through gritted teeth, seething.That is out of line, way out of line.Relax, dear, you have it wrong.I didnt betray your confidence.I told her that we were short on help for the party event and I mentioned your interest in helping.I asked if you had a work schedule that would allow you to participate.She said you can take all the time you need since it is a worthy cause.Thank you for your discreetness, dear.Mary mocks.What kind of party will I be helping with?Our annual Breast Cancer Extravaganza, we paper the town with fliers so women are aware of free clinics for breast exams.We will be going house to house asking for donations for our cause.We will prepare party bags for all our big donors and you will help out at the party on the last night.I see.Do you have an idea of how many hours this will entail?No, dear, the hours are not important.What is important however is that you be available the rest of this week.If you need a replacement to cover for you, I would suggest you take care of it immediately.All this week, I will need you at a moments notice.Ok.I will talk with Mrs.Belmont and make arrangements.I can start in the morning.No, dear, says Mrs.Cartwright with a thin smile, you will start right now or go to jail.I will meet you out front in five minutes.If you are late I will send the police for you.Have a nice day.She exits the room without waiting for a response from Mary.Mary sits behind her desk, shaking with rage.How dare this ingrate come into her office and order her around.How dare she have the nerve to ...?a knock interrupts her rant.Barbara bounces into the office.Who was she and what did she want?She looked like a snooty whore from the 50s.My community servicethat bitch is in charge of it.I have to go and work on some fucking cancer trash with her all week.Call Lester and ask him to cover for me.I have to get out there before she sics the cops on me.Mary grabs her purse and rushes to join the woman in her car.Mary and Mrs.Cartwright arrive at a large oceanfront house.Mrs.Cartwright draws up to her full height with a scowl that vanishes when Mary looks her way.Together, they walk the front path to discover a man on his hands and knees planting flowers around a tree.Mrs.Cartwright sashays up to the man.Excuse me, is the mistress of the house in?The man ignores her and continues digging a hole for the flowers.His back is to them as if he has no intention of responding to the woman.Excuse me, Mrs.Cartwright says louder as if the man is deaf, do you speak English?Annoyed at his lack of response to her earlier inquiry, she expels a loud stream of air in his direction.He was a dark, dirty man wearing farmers overalls, perhaps he was another of those damn illegals.Are you deaf?Is there someone in authority we can speak with, someone who understands ENGLISH for gods sake?Mary rolls her eyes.She deals with the wealthy and privileged every day at work and doesnt blame the man for not responding.Sir, could you stop and help me for a moment, please?Robert stops and looks up at the woman talking.He strains to see her because of the sun's glare.He then recognizes her from the club as the bottle wielding maniac.What is it?He puts a hand to his eyes to confirm her identity.My name is Mary Lake and this is Mrs.Cartwright.We are from the Sunny Isles Cancer Foundation and seeking a donation from the homeowner.Are you the owner of this beautiful home?With the sun behind her, her silhouette is that of an angel.Her thin dress is almost see thru.Robert scans the curvy angel.His eyes dart back to her face as if to hide their true intent.He studies the woman and after deep thought responds, nice to meet you, Mary.The owner is busy with other matters.Do you have something you can leave?Mrs.Cartwright interjects, they didnt respond to our mailer.I have a brochure and donation envelope for them.Could you see that they get it?She speaks as if talking down to a servant.Robert does not look her way; his gaze is steadfast on Mary: intriguingly, wonderful Mary.He wants to know the full story behind the chasing and throwing.His voice softens, what kind of cancer foundation do you work for?I am just helping Mrs.Cartwright cover the area; she can talk with you further about the organizations goals.Mary steps behind Mrs.Cartwright because Robert will not break his gaze from her.I have been with the foundation for over 5 years and I am on the board of directors, volunteers Mrs.Cartwright.We have been working to reduce breast cancer in this region by creating the nations most progressive research center.We are one third of the way finished with our building fund.All donations will be used to finish the construction; our completion date is two and a half years from today.Robert watches Mary the whole time Mrs.Cartwright explains their cause.He wants to assure Mary of his interest in her.Is it Miss Lake or Mrs.Lake?Mary takes a subtle step to hide further behind the old woman thanking the Lord for her expansive frame.Are you the homeowner?her voice is low and weak.Mary is ready to leave and if he isnt the owner she plans to bolt any minute.She thinks he is a handsome man but his stare makes her apprehensive.Mrs.Cartwright says to Robert, just a moment.She grabs Mary by her hand hauling her up the path.Now is the time you start earning your keep.For some reason he is interested in you.Here, take this.She forces the material in Marys hand.I dont have time for this.Ill be in the car.Get a donation or find the owners.She stomps back to the car slamming the door.Mary turns back toward the man and gathers her thoughts.She approaches him with the pamphlet.Could you please tell me the truth, are you the owner?Yes.Robert says, sensing her frustration.This is for you.She hands him the material and then turns to leave.Wait a minute, please.Robert opens the pamphlet.That old battle ax said breast cancer?Mary could not help but to smile; the more she tried forcing it from her face the more it returned with a vengeance.Her cheeks flared red so she gave up.She hated the woman and was happy to see she wasnt alone.Shes my boss.Yes, it is breast cancer.There is a party at the end of the week.The information is in the brochure on the last page I believe.Will you be there?Yes, but Ill be working that night, she adds, afraid the man might be trying to ask her out.How large of a donation are you looking for?It doesnt matter to me, I imagine the old battle ax will want something high end.Mary lowers her head to hide her smile.She lifts her eyes then lowers them just as quick.She is here to do a job not hold a long conversation with a stranger.My name is Robert Tyler and if you will be there, so will I.  I will read the information and decide how much to give.I hope to see you there.A smile wins the day despite her attack on it.Thank you for your help.Mary turns toward the car and freedom.Her steps quicken to the passengers side of the car not paying attention to anything except leaving the area.When she reaches the door a tapping erupts from the window.Mrs.Cartwright, sitting in the passengers seat, points to the drivers seat indicating she is not moving.Old battle ax, Mary utters under her breath, I am not your fucking chauffeur.Mary wears a tight smile as she puts on her seatbelt and starts the car.Well, who was he?Mrs.Cartwright demands.His name is Robert Tyler and he is the homeowner.She ignores the darkness blooming on the battle axs face.He said he will look over the material and decide how much to give.Mary careens down the street.We have three more stops; turn left at the next street.You can handle these people since you speak their language.She tosses the pamphlets in Marys lap content not to get out of the car the rest of the day.After making all her stops, Mary parks at city hall and catches the Green Line bus back to the hotel.She goes straight to her desk for her flask.She calls room service for more ice, taking a hefty draw from the flask.Jill knocks on Marys office door.She strolls into the room pushing a dining cart while donning a maids uniform.Hey, Mare, you are going to need more than some ice.I brought T bone steaks and fries.Jill parks the cart at Marys desk.She pulls out two dinner plates complete with red wine.The rich couple in 413 ordered two bottles of wine and only drank 1 and a quarter bottles.Didnt even touch their food.Their weakness is our good fortune.Lets toast to staying out of jail.She and Mary clink glasses.Ill drink to that, says Mary.They savor their first sip of the wine.A delicious grin spreads across Jills face.Now tell me everything that happened.Six: A Question      The next day, Tuesday, Mrs.Cartwright is back at the hotel looking for Mary.She bypasses the front desk invoking stares.Barbara gets on the phone, hey Mary, that hag is back to get you, girl.Barbara hangs up the phone and peers around the corner trying to catch a glimpse of the portly creature.Mary lifts her eyes from her computer when she hears a knock at her door.Come in, she replies.Mrs.Cartwright strolls forward, I have bad news that I needed to deliver in person.Please have a seat.Thank you, dear.I have been tallying up our donations and we are well short of our goal.We must get a specific amount of contributions before the next construction phase begins.Mr.Tyler is one our biggest donors and a friend of Mrs.Belmont.She wont return from sabbatical until the day of the party.We need Mr.Tylers donation today or tomorrow at the latest, along with several others.I will handle all the others and leave him to you.He is at home so get over there and work your magic.And what magic would that be, Mrs.Cartwright?I dont care, dear.He likes you, use that to your advantage and get our donation.I expect to hear good news from you.Mrs.Cartwright strolls out of the room like she owns the place.Mary sits thinking what she can possibly do.This is not her area of expertise.Another knock at the door interrupts her train of thought.Barbara sticks her head in the door.Is it safe?Come on in.What did the hag want this time?She wants me to go back to that creepy guys house and get a donation today for her stupid foundation.Mary opens her desk drawer and pulls out two small bottles of Jack Daniels.Here, help me come up with something to get this donation and get the hell out of there as quick as possible.They clink their mini bottles.After gulping down the tiny one shots they work on a strategy.Later, Mary rises to pace.Barbara tilts her head.Whats the hurry, I thought you had till Friday?She said something about needing the money before then to start their construction.That is not your problem or your job.That is her responsibility; she is just putting it off on you because no one is watching her.I bet you anything that if you fail, she will blame the whole thing on you and then you are through.Damn, I hate this bullshit.Mary swallows hard.As soon as you make a mistake these assholes have you over a barrel and they squeeze every drop of blood they can get.I ought to just stay here and forget it.No.You have to go.Exactly what did this guy do that was so creepy?He didnt look at Mrs.Cartwright the whole time we were there.He just kept staring at me like I was a piece of meat for him to devour.You know you exaggerate a lot?Was he at least good looking?I didnt notice, she says with all assurance, I kept trying to get him to stop staring at me.Ill go with you.Ready?Seriously?Of course, sweetie pie, lets go.Barbara drives them to Mr.Tylers house in her car.When they arrive, Mary knocks on the door.It opens and Robert says, Yes?Mr.Tyler, we have run into a problem that I would like to discuss with you, says Mary.Roberts face shines at the sight of Mary but sours at the sight of her redheaded friend.Come in.Barbara leans in and whispers as they walk into the house, you didnt say he was black and he is good looking.Mary whispers, quiet.They enter through the foyer to a large family room.This is a beautiful home, she says.Thank you, replies Robert.Would either of you care for something to drink?Yes, says Barbara.Mary gives her a hard look.No, thank you, this is not a social call.Please be seated and tell me what brings you out this way again.I am sorry to intrude on your privacy, but my boss, Mrs.Cartwright, came to me this morning saying they need donations by the end of the day.Some type of a funding snag that keeps the construction from getting underway on time.Have you had time to look over the pamphlet I gave you yesterday?Robert pretends to look in his pocket for the pamphlet.Excuse me a minute, I had it right here.I must have left it in the kitchen.Ill be right back.Robert excuses himself.He dials from the kitchens wall phone.After two rings a voice answers.Robert responds, get over here now.I need you fast.He hangs up the phone and gets a drink of water from the refrigerator.He grabs the pamphlet off the table and walks back into the room with the two women, waving the pamphlet.I found it.Good, says Mary.Did you have time to go over the material?No.I read the first half before being called away to attend to more pressing business.Could you tell me the highlights?Well, Mrs.Cartwright will be a better conversationalist on the foundation than I could ever be.Perhaps you will be able to talk with her at the party.I am only helping her canvass the neighborhood so we can reach everyone in the city.This is a worthy cause that affects many people in this area.Robert remains silent for a moment then asks, and these donations of yours, how much do you need to start construction?Mary has no idea what numbers are involved in the building of a research center.She reflects on the new construction upgrades to the west wing of the hotel.She decides to use those numbers.Before she could give her answer there was a knock at the door.Robert excuses himself to answer it.Mary turns to Barbara, lets get out of here.That crow should be here doing her own job.Robert comes back with a guest.Ladies, this is Jerry Carpenter a friend of mine.He is also a donor for the cancer foundation.Perhaps one of you will have some free time to discuss the cause with him.Jerry walks over to the seated women.Hello, ladies, its nice to meet you.The women stand.Barbara notices that Jerry looks like a cross between two famous actors in Hollywooda Brad Pitt Matt Damon combination.Jerry has a square jaw and looks like a rugged American hero.Barbara listens to the pitter patter of her screaming heart.Jerry is it?She shakes his hand, squeezing ever so lightly.Im Barbara and I would love to talk with you about the foundation.Maybe I could pin you down with a donation or something.She grins.Jerry places his other hand on top of hers and returns the squeeze, then follows with a light caress.Well, I always was a sucker for a redhead.Excuse my language, I didnt offend you did I?Barbara shakes her head but keeps her broad smile.Her cheeks redden to match her locks.Why dont we go outside and take a walk along the beach and you can tell me all about this foundation of yours?Yes, says Barbara relinquishing her grip, After you.Jerry turns toward the door.Barbara ogles his rippling muscles through his tight jeans as she follows with a big grin plastered to her face.She is in heaven, glad she came with Mary.Mary braces to keep from falling into the well of despair creeping up on her.That cheap skank!How can she leave me alone like this?Shell get an ear full when they get back to the office.Mary composes herself and faces Robert.Shall we sit and go over the pamphlet?Yes, please.Before Mary can explain, Robert poses a question.I believe in directness and total honesty.Be completely honest, do you hate me?Puzzlement spreads across Marys face.Why would he ask her a grade school question?No, sir, I dont hate you.Do I make you uncomfortable?You appear to be a little rigid.Well if you want me to be honest.I want you to be brutally honest, dont hold back.All right, people who stare at me can make me believe they are crazy or worse.What could be worse than crazy?They could be insane or perverted.Im sorry I was so rude to you yesterday.I couldnt help staring.You were so beautiful and it has been a long time since I talked with a beautiful woman.I am afraid Im out of practice.His words touched her, but she was no pusher over or a wanton fool like Barbara.Men always call women beautiful; it is a generic line that works only on the weak.
