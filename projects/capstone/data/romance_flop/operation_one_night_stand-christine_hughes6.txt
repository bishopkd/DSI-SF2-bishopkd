I think youre upset because your boyfriend liked me better.Im really sorry about that.She pouted her lips.I visualized punching her in the face.Oh!Thats right.You fucked my ex.I just ate half a burger.Want those leftovers, too?I noticed Brian watching the exchange.I also noticed Steven standing off to the side, looking on with interest.Youre funny, Caroline.Too bad you werent good enough for Steve.Steve?Who the fuck was Steve?He hated that.You know, when you are dead you dont know that you are dead.It is difficult only for others.Its the same with stupidity.Poor Caroline.Betsy had the audacity to laugh along with her friends.Instead of visualizing punching her in the face, I visualized ripping her hair out.I reached over and took Stevens drink out of his hand, probably a gin and tonicI was hoping for something with colorpoured it over Betsys head, and walked away.I didnt look back and instead of heading for the bathroom, I made my way to the bar.Caroline, youre going to scare my customers away.I need a drink.My hands were shaking.Brian placed his hands over mine to still the vibration.Who was that?He nodded toward Betsy and her supersluts.Oh her?Thats Betsy the cock juggling thunder cunt.His laugh boomed in my ear.Well, then.Maybe shes just the type of customer I dont want in my bar.Plus, any girl who can quote a Blade movie is okay in my book.He placed two shot glasses on the bar and filled each with Jack.Bottoms up.Another, I said as I slammed the glass down.He filled it up.Three shots later, I really had to pee.I have to go to the bathroom.There was a slur in my words that wasnt there ten minutes ago.You okay?I pulled my hand away as he tried to place his on it again.I was so pent up I wasnt sure that physical contact was a good idea.Yeah.Are you?My tone had more bite in it than intended.Im good.Brian stood and backed up.Ryans here.He nodded toward the door.I didnt know what I felt.Was I happy Ryan showed up?Was I annoyed?Was I frustrated about Brian?Steven?Betsy?Ryan walked over and kissed me on the cheek before shaking hands with Brian.Be right back.I have to pee.I left the two of them at the bar and felt both sets of eyes watching me as I walked away.FifteenI stared in the mirror, hands clutching either side of the sink to stop them from shaking.Why did I care so much?What the hell was it that left me feeling raw and exposed every single time I thought of Steven and Betsy?Leaning my head against the mirror, I stared down at the water flowing from the faucet and wondered why I couldnt be more like the flowing stream.It was never in one place for longer than a millisecond, new fresh water followed in constant movement.Until it was frozen.Ice didnt move much.Doomed to view the same scenery until, mercifully, it melted and moved away.Maybe thats what it was.Maybe I was frozen in time.Maybe I was melting little by little, moment by moment, until I was free.Maybe it would just take longer than two months and a one night stand.You okay?Melody walked into the small bathroom.Yeah.Im fine.I will be fine.I saw what happened.You want to talk about it?Not really.I pulled a few paper towels from the dispenser, wet them, and patted my face.Melody pulled a compact out of her purse and handed it to me.Okay.You dont have to.Opening the small metal tin, I used the pad to swipe the redness from my face.Who the hell does she think she is?Mel leaned back against the wall with her arms crossed over her chest.I continued swiping away the evidence of tears and dark circles.I mean, fuck her, right?Shes the one who fucked up.Not me.And where the fuck does she get off calling him Steve?He hates that.He always preferred to be called Steven.Reaching into her bag, Melody produced a small tube of cream blush and some mascara.I took the items and continued to fix my face.He fucking broke me.He fucking hid me away, and I allowed it.Mel stepped to the sink and handed me nude lip gloss.I painted my lips until they were too shiny.How the hell did I allow that?How the hell didnt I see?I blotted my lips with a square of toilet paper and turned to face my friend.How am I supposed to become the new me if I dont know how I became the old me?She pursed her lips, thinking of what to say.Mel could be crass and over the top but when it came down to it, she was thoughtful when it came to what really mattered.I think, she began, that maybe you didnt really know who you were then, either.I think you were shelteredI wasntLet me finish.I think that maybe you were more sheltered than you think you were.And thats not a bad thing.I can see that.But I dont think I should have to apologize for growing up in a great family.I shouldnt have to be ashamed of having parents and a brother who love me.My stomach dropped and I felt anger beginning to bubble up.Oh goodness no!Please dont misunderstand me.She reached out and placed her hand on my arm.I think that you began to see what was out there and maybe you pulled away from his shadow a bit.I dont think he liked that.And I think Betsy is more than willing to allow a sugar daddy to take care of her.You, on the other hand, whether you realized it or not, wanted more.You still want more.I turned back to face the mirror.Melody was right.Both she and Sarah have been right about all this mess.I hated that I needed the push but I was grateful for it.Every day I felt more independent, more in control of what I want.I think you flipped today because you hadnt had the opportunity to flip before this.Of course its still raw.You were together for five years.And he broke your heart.You have every right to react.Just dont let it consume you.React and move on.React and move on, I repeated.Yes.Now.You have a superhot guy waiting out there for you.A great night of fun and debauchery.Are you going to let trivial people like Betsy and Steven ruin that for you?No.Thats my girl.No, I said with more force.Absolutely not.I am starting over.I am taking control of my life.Fuck them.Exactly!Thank you.Oh sweetie, no thanks needed.I hugged Melody tighter than I thought possible.She was wrong.I didnt just have a brother.I had two sisters as well, and who cared if they werent blood?They were sisters to memore even, just the same.SixteenMelody left the bathroom before me, giving me an extra minute to make sure I was composed.Stepping out, I made my way to the bar first.Im sorry.For what?Brian pulled three beers, obviously busy with the nighttime crowd that had begun to trickle in.For my earlier display of idiocy.I shouldnt have done that and Im sorry.Brian stopped for a minute and placed his hands on the bar.You have nothing to be sorry about.I mean, it probably wouldnt be good for business if you made dumping perfectly good drinks, which I made by the way, on the heads of my customers.Everyone has something that sets them off.I get it.Thank you.I placed my hand on his and he looked down at it before pulling his away.Yeah, well.Like I said.Dont make it a habit.I have to go get these drinks out before theres a riot.He laughed easily and walked away to serve the customers.Looking around, I saw Betsy and Steven had decided to leave.I didnt feel remorse toward Betsy.I didnt feel anything toward either of them.I knew it would take time for it all to go away but the least I could do was take Mels advice.React and move on.I looked over at the table: my two friends and a group of guys we pretty much just met were sitting around, chatting, laughing, and having the good time I deserved.Smiling, I joined them.Sitting next to Ryan, I looked over to find him smiling at me.He leaned in to whisper, Everything okay?Perfect, I whispered back and kissed him on the cheek.I wasnt sure where this whatever was going with Ryan but I was more than happy to find out.So maybe he wasnt going to be my forever.I was content to have him as a right now.Besides, a little voice inside my head told me relationships were off limits until I was used to functioning without one.I leaned back and took everything in.It looked as though Melody and Dan were at it again.You sound reasonable.I think it might be time to up my medication.Melody rifled through her purse as the rest of the table laughed.Im just saying.When it comes to people in your life, you need to share certain things.For example, if Dont Stop Believin comes on and the person youre with doesnt join you in the sing along, you need to remove them from your life.Everyone knows that song.And if the person youre with isnt down you have to wonder if you need that kind of negativity in your life?Am I right?Melody laughed easily.Youre right.Hard to argue with that kind of rationality.Speaking of music.Drew stood up and walked over to the jukebox, popped in a five dollar bill, and started pressing buttons.I jumped up to join him.Whats your poison?Drew scanned the list of available songs.This one.I typed in the corresponding code.Awesome!I havent heard that one in years!Mel, Sarah, and I used to sing this all the time.College?Yeah.SoDrew turned to face me after he inputted all the song requestswhats the deal with Sarah?The deal?Yeah.He leaned closer.Is she, like, seeing anyone?Oh!I glanced over at Sarah, who was laughing at the conversation at the table.No, she isnt actually.Cool.Thanks.So, uh, whats up with you and Ryan?Why do you ask?I dont know.Its not really my place to say anything.What did they always say?Curiosity killed the cat?What isnt your place to say?Oh nothing.Its just odd that both Brian and Ryan talk about you so much.Didnt you just meet them?Yeah and?Well, look.You seem like a nice girl but Ryan and Brian are my friends.I just dont want them to get hurt if you cant make up your mind.I had to shake my head and clear it of everything just to make sense of what he was saying.Im not sure what you heard, but Brian and I dont have anything going on other than meeting him a couple weeks ago and a brief run in at the gym.As for Ryan and me, well, that isnt really your business.Drew held up his hands.Im sorry.I didnt mean to assume.I just thoughtNever assume.It just makes an ass out of you.And me, he replied.Thats what I said.Look, not that this is any of my business but Sarahs my friend and if you fuck with her, I will hunt you down and crush your balls with the heel of my stiletto.Mkay?Ha!Understood.I think you and I just might get along after all.He put up his hand and I slapped him a high five.Berk walked by with a tray of shots.I couldnt wait for the waitress anymore.I took it upon myself to get these.What is it?Sarah asked as she sniffed the drink.Its called an Erection.What?Dan held up the glass between his two fingers and inspected it.Like youve never had one!Melody piped up.Ive just never had one in my mouth, Dan replied.Dont knock it till you try it!Berk shouted over the din of the bar.He downed the shot and ran his tongue across his lips.Oh, Danny boy!You dont know what youre missing!Get the fuck out of here!Go find yourself a fuck buddy!Berk laughed and walked over to a group of guys standing by the bar.I leaned forward.Is he gay?You cant tell?Sarah asked.No, I mean, it didnt even cross my mind.Ha!Well, ladies, Berk is as handsome as they come but unfortunately for you, you arent his type.Drew raised his shot before pouring it into his mouth.Well, thats too bad, Melody purred.Looks like I wont be having any fun tonight.She looked at Dan with hooded eyes and he took the bait.Oh, darlin.We wouldnt want that now, would we?You know anyone whos interested in having some fun?Melody ran her fingers along his hand.I loved watching her in action.I dont think shes ever been turned down.They dont call me the kamikaze king for nothing.Kamikaze king?I had to ask.Ryan, Dan, and Drew laughed as Dan explained, Sixty nine is the kamikaze of sex.If Im goin down, shes comin with me.I was laughing so hard I couldnt breathe.Sarahs wine actually shot out of her nose.We did that a lot.Melody smiled as if shed won the lottery.We were drunk.After countless bottles of wine, numerous pitchers of beer, and shots with names like Stumble Fuck and Dirty Whores Bath Water, it was a wonder any of us could stand.And then it happened.The song Id plugged into the jukebox started playing.I watched with glee as my friends eyes widened and piercing screams of remembrance echoed against the walls.Melody was the first to jump up and start dancing.Sarah grabbed Drews beer and drained it.I love this song!I have no idea what hes saying!I Believe in a Thing Called Love by the Darkness played loudly throughout the bar.Patrons actually stopped and stared as the three of us jumped around and tried to keep up with the high pitched, fast paced lyrics of the song that reminded us of freshman year of college.I grabbed Ryans hands and pulled him out of his chair.Melody took the opportunity to bump and grind on Dan like it was her job.Sarah climbed on top of the table and crawled over to Drew while singing the song at the top of her lungs.Berk ran back to the group screaming, I love this song!He got in on the action by climbing on top of the table with Sarah.Brian stopped what he was doing and looked on from behind the bar with a smile on his face.By the time the song was half done, most of the bar was singing and dancing along.Ryan twirled me around until I was dizzy.It didnt take much; I was half in the bag to begin with.Drew ran over to the jukebox and added more money.Time to test Dans theory.As soon as our song ended, Dont Stop Believin pounded through the speakers.The entire bar let out a huge cheer and sang along.See?Was I right?Thats how you know Brians bar is the place to hang.You were right!I shouted.Ryan wrapped his arms around my waist and pulled me in closer.You wanna get out of here?I looked around at my friends.Sarah was singing along with Drew.Melody and Dan were lip locked as he pinned her up against the wall.Even Berk had found himself a hottie.I kissed Ryan quickly on the lips.Lets go.I reached to grab my coat and purse.Leave them.His voice was forceful and the hunger in his eyes was apparent.We raced through the bar, through a door at the back.He pulled his keys out of his pocket as we made our way through the stockroom space.Your place?He nodded as he pulled the door open and shoved me through.He pushed me up against the wall at the base of the stairs, his lips on my neck.I want you.I grabbed his face.I want you, too.Lets go.We raced up the stairs to his apartment above the bar.I figured my friends would be okay without me for a while.By the time we hit the top of the stairs, his shirt was off and my pants were unbuttoned.Clumsily I kicked my shoes off and pulled my shirt over my head.Ryan pulled his shoes off before reaching for me again.I slid my tongue down his jawline as his hands reached for and cupped my breasts, his thumbs tracing circles around my hard nipples.He pinched them between his fingers and I moaned.I fumbled the zipper and edged his jeans to the floor.I pushed him onto his leather couch before dropping to my knees.I pulled down his boxers and he breathed out.I hadnt realized we were both holding our breath.Never in my life had I been forward enough to take the lead.Never in my life had I felt more comfortable than I did in that moment.He moaned quietly as my tongue licked his tip.He slowly brought his hands to my hair and his fingers knotted themselves in my curls as I took him in my mouth, slowly at first.My hand stroked him as my mouth slid up and down his length.His moans grew louder as I increased the friction and scraped my teeth gently along his engorged cock.When I took him all, my hand moved to his balls and I massaged them lightly.Oh shit, Caroline.Ryans head fell back and he squeezed his eyes tight.His fingers tightened their grip on my hair and for a moment I was afraid hed rip it out by the roots.But the harder he pulled, the more I responded.As his eyes glazed over, I shifted to the balls of my feet.I knew he was almost ready and pushed him closer to the edge by squeezing my hand along him as I stroked.In a frenzy, I couldnt get enough of him and I took him in and out of my mouth, sucking hard.He tried to push my head away but I held on, taking him deeper as he exploded at the back of my throat.Swallowing every last drop, I felt good in knowing I satisfied him.I laid my head against his thighs as he caught his breath.Caroline, that washe lifted my head and looked me in the eyesamazing.Well, thanks.I aim to please.I giggled into the palm of his hand as I kissed it.Suddenly, he reached down, grabbing me by my waist and lifting me off the floor.Your turn, he breathed into my ear as he spun me around and threw me on the spot hed just vacated on the couch.Slowly easing my jeans down over my hips, he pulled them off and threw them over my head.Placing a hand on either side of my naked thighs, he kissed me deeply.As his tongue explored my mouth, his hands reached around and unhooked my bra.The ferocity of his kiss pushed me back into the couch cushions and I moaned into his mouth.He tugged at my thin silk panties until they tore.His fingers found me, already slick with want, and massaged the inside of my folds.When I felt the current rise in my belly, he pinched me and I called out in anticipation as he slid a finger inside.His tongue danced with mine and he slipped another finger inside me.His touch was like nothing Id ever experienced before.It was urgent and gentle.Ferocious and calm.A lesson in opposites.He had to know I would come quickly and he fingered me until I screamed and came.RyBefore I finished yelling his name, he brought his face to me.Pressing his tongue on me, he continued to explore me with his fingers.It was as if he knew every inch of me and was committing it to memory.As he buried his face in me, I pushed his head deeper into me.Every lick, every suck, threw me closer to the edge again.When his finger moved to my ass and teased the rim, I tried to prepare myself.It was no use.I screamed in pleasure as another orgasm rocked me to my core.He wouldnt let up.His tongue dove inside me as his finger entered again.He ate and licked and sucked until he was out of air.His mouth, his face, was covered in me.I pulled his head up and licked his mouth, tasting myself.I felt free.It was like nothing Id ever experienced before.Sliding my ass closer to the edge of the couch, I needed his fingers to fill me faster.I quickly shoved his head back down and tightened my legs around his shoulders.Within seconds, I came harder than the last time, if that was even possible.Slowly removing his finger from my ass, he lifted himself up and pressed his forehead to mine.That was He tried to catch his breath.Amazing?I tried to still my racing heart.Yeah.His head flopped on the couch beside me as his arm hung heavy across my lap.Unbelievable.Yeah.Where did you learn how to do that?He laughed as he looked up at me, his eyes still glazed over.Oh that?Just something I picked up along the way.I couldnt focus.Besides being drunk, I hadnt yet begun to descend from the orgasmic high Id just experienced.Well, I began, you should do that more often.Ditto.He slowly rocked back to his heels and reached for his shirt.You okay?I smiled.Im perfect.Pretty damn close if you ask me.You know, about what happened earlierI pulled my tunic over my headsorry you had to see that.What?He turned to face me as he pulled on his boxer briefs.It was like the advertisement live and in living color.I couldnt stop staring.Earth to Caroline.He smirked.Sorry.I just, uh, was reminded of something I saw earlier this week.What?Well, if you must knowI slid into my jeansI just so happened to see something on the side of a bus stop when I was in the city.He visibly blushed and looked away.Oh that.Yeah, that, I teased.Why didnt you tell me?When would I have had the opportunity?Not like there was much talking going on the night we first met.True.And besides, I try not to make it a point of telling everyone I meet.I mean, I get a hard enough time from the guys.Well, just to let you know, I defended your honor.I cocked an eyebrow.My honor?Confusion spread across his face.Yeah, Mel and Sarah werent convinced that it was all you in the picture, if you catch my drift.His face reddened even more.Oh, well.Yeah.Thats me.I know.I know you know.He pulled me closer and nibbled on my earlobes.Id always heard about people having a spot but Id never been able to find mine.I knew then that I could very likely have another orgasm if he continued to bite and suck on my earlobes.Im glad you know.Care, I think you and I are going to be great friends.The world screeched to a halt.I mean, I knew I didnt want a relationship.If I was being logical, I wasnt in any shape to have one.But come on!This was probably not the best time for him to point out what great friends well be.So I took it a step further.Friends, huh?With benefits, I take it?Yeah.He mustve seen something in my face.Care, you okay?Im sorry if I led you to believe something else would go on with us.I mean, I just moved to the city, I have this cool new job.Its just nice to be able to, you know, ground myself with someone like you.Someone like me?I wasnt sure if that was a backhanded compliment.Well, yeah.Youre cool.Youre pretty.He kissed my neck.Youre great in the sack.And, as opposed to many of the other people Ive met lately, youre normal.And I need a little normal once in a while.I chewed on a fingernail; something my grandmother always chastised me for.Perfect.Friends is perfect as long as you do thatI pointed to the couchmore often.Friends with benefits.You know what?I was more than okay with that and since it was out in the open, a wave of relaxation and acceptance washed over me.You got it.Lets go back downstairs before were missed.He grabbed my hand and we made our way back to the others.Friends with benefits.Never had one of those before.Always a first time, right?Ryan left to use the bathroom and I sat at the table with the others.They were still in celebration mode.The kind of celebration you get when you click with people youve never met before.It was perfect.Brian sat down next to me.Bout to call last call.You need anything?I checked my phone.I had no idea it was that late.Um, no thanks.Im good.Brian tapped his fingers on the table and bounced his knee until I placed my hand on it, signaling him to stop.Anxious much?So, you and RyanAre just friends.With benefits.It wasnt a question.I guess you could say that.Thats too bad.He threw his towel on the table and got up to make his rounds among those at the table.It was last call after all.SeventeenThe next morning I was thanking the weekend gods it was Saturday as I sat at the kitchen counter reading Michaels manuscript, drinking a cup of coffee.I had just finished writing a page full of notes on my computer when Sarah walked through the front door.Holy hell!You look like shit!I rushed over to help her with her coat.I pulled my face away.Jesus, you stink!I honestly dont think Im sober yet.I havent had a night like that in years.I might be too old to drink like that.She backed up against the door and leaned her head back.Kicking off her shoes, she toed on the slippers she kept by the door, shuffling over to the wall and clicking off the light switch.Her eyes were swollen, with dark circles from a long night of partying, and she reeked of a mixture of sweat, booze, and sex.You got laid!I jumped back and pointed at her accusingly.Please dont shout.I feel like I have a mini construction crew drilling for oil in my head.How was it?How was what?She covered her eyes with her hand and navigated slowly to the couch, where she proceeded to lay down and pull a throw pillow over her face.Getting laid?You talk as though you never have.Oh, shut up.Not my fault you drank until your body called for a time out.How the hell arent you hung over?Didnt you drink as much as I did?I was drunk, sure.But I sobered up.I remembered the exact time I sobered up.Friends.With benefits.Too bad.I walked to the kitchen and grabbed a sports drink from the fridge and a couple of aspirin from the cabinet.Here.Take these.Sarah peeked out from under the pillow before sitting up and dutifully taking the medicine.Thank you, she said as she handed the bottle back to me.Come on, lets get you to bed.I pulled her up and she crashed into me.I pulled my face away and crinkled my nose.But first, you need a shower.Did you at least have fun?Yeah.Drew is great.Drew the awesome screw!She giggled before burping up whatever greasy after hours diner food she must have consumed.And I think well brush your teeth, too.I turned on the water in the shower while Sarah sat naked on the toilet picking her toenails.Putting toothpaste on her toothbrush, I handed it to her and steered her into the shower, closing the curtain and taking her place on the lid of the toilet.Oh my God!The water feels so awesome!Thats right.Scrub, scrub, scrub.Brush, brush, brush.So, you and Ryan disappeared last night for a bit.Where did you go?Upstairs.He lives above the bar, Brians place.Oh, right.Brian was none too happy when he saw you two were gone.Why would he care?I held up my close up mirror and cringed at the blackhead forming next to my nose.You really are clueless sometimes.Brian really likes you.But, I mean, Ryans great, too.Maybe you guys will go somewhere with all this.I snorted.Not likely.Why do you say that?Hey, do we have any more of that lavender body wash?I reached under the cabinet to retrieve the extra bottle.Oh, no reason.I mean, other than Ryan told me wed be great friends.After, of course, I sucked his dick and he went down on me.Well be great friends with benefits.Friends with benefits, huh?Thats what he said.Thats bullshit.Why cant people call it what it is?I need another razor.This ones too dull.Again I ventured under the cabinet to grab a fresh razor.She handed me the dull one as I gave her the new one.I dropped the old one in the garbage.I began making faces at myself in the mirror over the vanity.Opening and closing my mouth so that I looked like a freak.Squinting, stretching my face back, checking for nose hairs.I think I am getting wrinkles.And what do you mean, call it what it is?I yelled to her as I peered closer into the reflection.Sure enough, when I moved my mouth a certain way, wrinkles appeared near my eyes.Opening my tube of eye cream, I found I was out.I definitely needed to make a trip to Sephora.You are not getting wrinkles!And I mean, look at it this way.You and I are friends, right?Yeah.Ugh.More wrinkles.This time encroaching on my forehead.Well, you do stuff for me and I do stuff for you, right?I mean stuff that benefits each of us.Yeah, so?Ohmygod!I raked through the hair at my temple.Was that a gray hair?Well, wouldnt that make us friends with benefits?I mean, you make dinner, I do the dishes.You vacuum, I dust.I come home with a wicked hangoverfeeling a little better by the wayand you take care of me.So, by definition, you and I are friends with benefits.Huh.Id never thought of it that way.I guess she was right.So, I think you should call what is going on between you and Ryan what it actually is.Not a gray hair.Blond highlight.Thank God.Which is?Friends who fuck.Friends who fuck?Yeah.Do you go bowling together?No.Do you do your taxes together?No.What do you do?You fuck.You are friends who fuck.She punctuated the last word by turning off the water and reaching toward the towel rack for a towel.Stepping out of the shower, she looked at me.Her eyes were more open than they had been when she first came home but they were still bloodshot.She looked tired but not gross.And she smelled better.Am I right?I guess you are.I plopped back down on the toilet and put the mirror away.Id done enough scrutinizing of my old lady wrinkles for one day.So I should call it what it is.But friends who fuck sounds soVile?Degrading?Pornographic?She giggled as she dried herself off and wrapped another towel around her head.For lack of better adjectives, yeah.Then call it something youre comfortable with.Friends who bang.Friends who do it.Friends who have sex.Whatever.But, from what you told me, there is no better verb for what you two do than fuck.Yeah.I handed her the deodorant.You arent wrong.Thanks.She smeared the clear gel under her arms.Well, then.Just own it.Know what it is.Embrace it.Youre not a little kid anymore.Youre a grown ass woman and if you want to have a relationship based on nothing more than meaningless sex, then do so.Im sure its loads better than Stevens fabled missionary position.Sarah pumped lotion into her hands and smoothed it over her arms and legs.I handed her the face lotion after she used the towel to remove the remnants of the body lotion from her hands.She was right.Steven and I rarely ever had sex that wasnt missionary.Him on top, me on the bottom.Him dominant, me submissive.I shuddered.Anything was better than that.No wonder Id gone through so many batteries in the past five years.SoI took the lotion she handed me and placed it back in the vanitywhat are you doing the rest of the day?What time is it?She stood towel drying her hair, the rest of her dripping onto the bath mat.Im not sure.Almost eleven?Walking out into the hallway, I tried to peek around the corner and catch the time on the clock in the kitchen.Doesnt really matter.Im going to bed.Not going out tonight.You?Sarah started toward her bedroom.Nope.So well order in Chinese and watch a movie?I can do that if you dont mind me reviewing a manuscript while we eat and watch.Fine with me.What are you doing now?Ill probably try to hit that yoga class that starts at noon.Then I need to run out and pick up some things.Need anything?Maybe a bottle of wine?White.Sweet.You got it.I threw my wallet into my gym bag, grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, and headed out the door.EighteenWith my gym bag slung over my shoulder, I pulled my scarf tighter around my neck.It was a pleasant hour of stretching and clear headed focus followed by a ridiculously long shower that worked out the rest of the tension that weighed me down.Knowing I needed a dress, according to Michael, for the dinner the following week, I left the gym and made the brisk walk to the department store.Pushing through the revolving doors, I was reminded of my need for a few items from the makeup counter.I busied myself with the saleswoman discussing the benefits of an eye cream that hid visible lines, something I hadnt yet had the opportunity to discover, but she swore that early prevention was the best policy.I was about to lay out the arm and leg it cost for a tube the size of my pinky, but instead decided on purchasing a new tube of mascara, a new tinted lip gloss, and facial cleanser.As I handed the girl my card I spotted Yolanda.I dropped to the floor in a squat.It wasnt that I didnt like her.I really did like her, when she wasnt in full on work mode.I just wasnt in the mind set to deal with her outside the office.She was judgmental enough about my work; I didnt need her beady eyes perusing my latest purchase.Looking up, I saw confusion spread across the saleswomans face as she turned to hand me my card and receipt.Psst.She looked down.What are you doing?My boss is over there.I pointed, feeling like a complete ass.Where?she said a little too loudly as she whipped her head around to look.Just hand me my stuff and Ill get out of here.You get a free gift with your purchase.What would you like?I dont care.Well, we have a free makeup bag with some samples.The bags come in a variety of patterns and colors.I rolled my eyes when I saw her lift herself onto the counter and look down to where I squatted.I dont care.You pick.Please.Just give me my stuff and let me get out of here.Caroline.The hair on the back of my neck stood on end and my shoulders involuntarily tensed.So much for yoga and my hot shower.Yolanda.I busied myself with my shoelace before standing up.In a hurry?Well, not really.Just had to pick up a few things.I turned to the saleswoman, who looked more confused than she had when I disappeared.Thank you.Ill take the pink bag.Are you sure?Yes.Yes.Thank you.I took my bag from her and stood in front of Yolanda.I dont know what it was about her, but I often felt as though I were about to be disciplined for something.Well, dear.Do you have something to wear for the dinner next week?Um, well.Thats one of the reasons Im here actually.Good.I will help you find something suitable to wear.Heaven knows what you youngsters think will pass for suitable dinner attire.I mean, look at what youre wearing now.She laughed but I wasnt sure how to take it.My stomach sank to the soles of my new running shoes as I looked down.I was wearing leggings and running shoes.My hair was in a messy, almost dry pony bun and I had no makeup on.She was wearing perfectly tailored pants, smart flats, and an ivory turtleneck sweater that peaked out from the collar of her navy peacoat.I wrung my hands together.I just came from the gym.You should always take pride in your appearance, Caroline.Even if you are running to the grocery store for milk, you should always present yourself as you want others to see you.Lets go.Third floor.With my head down, I followed Yolanda to the escalator.Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the saleswoman mouth, Im sorry.Yeah, youre sorry.Yolanda didnt look back at me the entire way to the third floor.She walked swiftly, weaving in and out of racks until she stopped in front of a section of cocktail dresses.I watched as she methodically began sifting through the dresses.Stopping for only a moment to scan me from head to toe, Yolanda tossed dress after dress in my direction.Just as I thought I couldnt hold any more, she turned on her heel, crooked her finger at me to follow, and headed toward the dressing rooms.She spoke quietly to a saleswoman; they both turned their heads to look at me before continuing with their hushed conversation.I stood there feeling like an awkward outsider.It seemed like hours before they included me in their little chat.Size two, thats just what I thought, Kelly.Thank you.Anything for you Ms.Page.Caroline, please step in here.She took the items from my arms and motioned for me to enter an open dressing room that was roughly half the size of my bedroom.Surrounded by mirrors, I saw my mouth drop open when Yolandas reflection entered the room with me and took a seat on a plush white chair in the corner of the fitting room.Dont look so surprised, my dear.Its nothing I havent seen before.Drop the unsightly gym bag.Dont you have anything less tattered?No matter.Try on this one first.She handed me a black beaded, sleeveless number that looked entirely too small.I shyly undressed, attempting to keep myself covered at all times.It was not an easy task and I thanked goodness for all the time I spent at the gym.At least my body wasntcouldnt besomething with which she could find fault.Keeping on my bra and giant cotton pantiesthank God they were cleanI slipped the slinky material over my head and felt the light material skim down the rest of my body.It fell a couple inches above my knees.Sleeveless and fitted at the top, I admired the soft A line of the skirt.I was slowly running my hands along the fabric when Yolanda cut in.No.Next.ButTrust me.Next.She stood, took a cream colored swatch of material off its hanger, and handed it to me as I gave her the black beaded dress.For an hour I played dress up with Yolanda Page.Every now and then, shed sniff maybe and place the dress on the designated maybe hook.More often than not, I was faced with a short no as I was handed another dress.I lost count of how many Id tried on, lost count of how often poor Kelly rushed in and out of the dressing room at Yolandas order.And then it happened.Over the top of the dressing room door, Kelly handed over a deep charcoal wool dress.I stepped into it and pulled it over my hips.Slipping my arms in, Yolanda zipped up the back for me.The off the shoulder dress had a four inch fold that lay nicely on my arms and a thick strip of fabric that rested above my breast.It was fitted and fell mid thigh.Yolanda gasped when I lazily turned to face her, waiting for yet another veto.This is it.This is the dress.I gave myself permission to look in the mirror, something I hadnt done for the last forty or so dresses.It seemed everything I liked, Yolanda didnt.I wasnt expecting much.Wow.I whispered, turning around to check out all of the dress.I was expecting the dark gray to wash out my pale skin and drown me in shadows, but something about the dress made me feel like I was in a spotlight.Kelly!Yolanda called.Weve found the dress.As we discussed.Busy admiring myself in the mirror, I barely felt Yolanda tug on the zipper.I stepped out of the dress, careful not to wrinkle it, when I caught sight of the price tag.It was more than I made in a single paycheck.Of course, I could always charge it on Dads card, but I made a point to be as self sufficient as I could.
