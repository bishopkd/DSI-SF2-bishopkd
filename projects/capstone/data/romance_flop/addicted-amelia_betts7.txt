I had erroneously assumed that hamburgers and chicken nuggets might bring me some sort of clarity.Instead, the tidal wave of loneliness that had woken me up that morning came crashing back onto the shores of my consciousness the minute I pounded my last French fry.With some effort, I managed to stand up and do some haphazard stretching, throwing my trash into one of the rusted metal drums that lined Oceansides seedier beachfront sidewalks.I could hear my phone ringing inside my car but made no rush to answer it.By the time I made it back, Isabella had left me a message, begging me to save her from death by boredom.I could hear on the recording that she sounded weak, tipsy, not all there, and just knew thatunlike meshe hadnt had enough to eat.* * * Every once in a while, Isabella got drunk in the afternoon.It didnt take much, a couple of glasses of champagne or a particularly stiff Bloody Mary from her favorite brunch spot, and all 105 pounds of her was stumbling onto the patio and shouting at her neighbors for having no style.When I found her that day, she was stretched out on the couch, her television set to a classical music station.You smell like fried chicken, she said with disdain as I sat down beside her.Thats an accurate assessment, I responded.What did you do to yourself?Why arent you working?Hey, I asked you first.I dont know.I saw a charity auction on television and felt left out.So I had a champagne to make myself feel better.She sat up and lowered the volume on the Chopin concerto that was blaring a little too loudly from the television speakers.And then I had another one.You want some?Just a little drop?Isabellas cheeks were sunken and pale.She clearly hadnt had a bite to eat all day, so I went directly to the kitchen to make her an omeletone of the few dishes she never turned down.When I opened the refrigerator, I contemplated the bottle of champagne and decided to pour myself a glass, figuring I might as well add drinking in the middle of the day to my current tally of vices.Whats wrong?Isabella called after me weakly as she lurched into the kitchen.Ive been left to die in the middle of nowhere.Whats your excuse?What are you talking about?Fluffy, youre not happy.Look at those lines between your eyes.I glanced at her from behind the refrigerator door as I replaced the half empty bottle of Mot & Chandon that shed stuck a spoon in, handle down.Why the spoon?I said, holding it up for her to see.Keeps it bubbly.Pour me a finger why dont you?she said with her usual air of authority before sauntering outside to the patio.* * * The sun had slipped behind a series of dense clouds by the time I made it outside, lending an extra grayness to an already gray day.I placed the omelet and a drop of champagne before Isabella and sat down with my second glass.Despite her prodding, I told her I didnt want to talk about myself and asked for a story instead.Happy or sad?she asked.I dont care, you pick.Fine.Isabella held up her hands and studied her nails for a moment before launching in.Oooookay.I pick happy!I smiled and took a swig of the champagne, whichsurprise, surprisewas helping my emotional hangover.Good, I said.Did I ever tell you about Dick Richards?The American soldier I fell in love with?No.I called him Dickie, Dickie Richards.Private First Class Dickie Richards!He was from North Carolina, USA, she drawled, doing her best impression of a bad Southern accent.Oh my goodness, he was the best looking man I had ever seen.I met him at a cafe in Vienna.He bought me an Aperol Spritz.He didnt even know what the drink was, but hed seen me having one before.He said to the waiter, Git her one of them orange thangs.How old were you?I asked.Piecing together Isabellas life and all the places she had lived was like working on one of those impossible thousand piece jigsaw puzzles.I was eighteen, just a baby!And he wasnt much older.He had dirty blond hair and big thick eyebrows and big blue eyes.And he had the softest skin.I fell for him like a cat falls for a dog.Is that a saying?I chuckled.I dont think so.It was like Lady and the Tramp, you know?He was a scoundrel.My parents wouldnt even have him in the house.They thought he might pee on the floor or something like that.But I was so sure he was the one for me, and we had the best sex!Anyway, one night, after a few months, we decided to run away together.He would quit the army and I would renounce my inheritance and we would start somewhere completely new.I called it our American Dream.She smiled wanly as she took the last tiny sip of her champagne.But then when it came time, I packed a bag and slipped out in the night.He was waiting outside with his duffel bag, all ready to go.We got all the way to the train station, and then he asked how much cash I had, and I said he needed to buy the ticket because I had none.I had taken nothing of value, on principle.That way, my parents would forever regret their decision But thats when I realized, good old Dickie hadnt imagined me poor, not really.I think he thought I would never really be cut off.He didnt understand the ways of the rich.His parents would have given him the shirts off their backs She trailed off, frowning at the sky.Come back, sun!I need you today.So what happened?I asked, worried that her story was taking a turn for the tragic.Isabella looked across the table at me and shrugged, nonchalant.We never got on the train.He said he couldnt leave his paycheck, that without it he couldnt take the risk of going with me to God knows wherewe hadnt even decided where we would go.Did you keep seeing each other?I asked, wanting her to say yes.I felt so embittered by my experience with Liam that I couldnt handle the thought of somebody elses heartbreak.But Isabella shook her head.I was so young and full of ideals when I met him.I thought love was what you saw in the movies.But then I realized how right my parents wereit was a business transaction, two people measuring up each others worth.Sometimes its money, sometimes beauty, sometimes youth.Whatever it is, everyone needs to feel like theyre getting something out of it.Its not spiritual; its materialistic.But the difference between me and Dickie was that I didnt care.I truly didnt.I wanted for us to be poor together, all the way up until that train station.Of course, after that, I knew better I guess thats not a happy story after all.She forced a smile that quickly faded.I was on the verge of tears.No, its not.Oh well, she said, and repeated her catchphrase: Every man who comes into your life is as an opportunity for adventure.Nothing more, nothing less.* * * The afternoon at Isabellas ended with me putting her to bed, with a Vanity Fair and a peanut butter smoothie on the nightstand.She had been nothing but cheery after telling me her sad tale, while I had gone in the opposite direction.Even though I wasnt willing to talk about it, she could tell I was heartsick and kept promising I would grow out of it soon enough.She seemed to think that a natural part of growing up was accepting the ugly truth about love, like she had after her botched elopement with Dickie Richards, but I didnt want to think that way.Regardless of my recent failure, I wanted to believe in love as a spiritual thingnot as a material transaction.After her story, though, I wasnt so sure.When I drove away, I felt exhausted and sad but ravenously hungry at the same time.I detoured to the nearest grocery store to stock up on every bad thing I could think of, certain that I deserved it after all I had been through.At checkout, the cashier asked if I was hosting a party.Nope, I said, its all for me.Ill probably polish it off by tomorrow.I was incapable of smiling and certainly incapable of the usual fibs about who the food was for or why Id bought only junk.A friend just had a breakup, I would normally have said.I dont know what she likes, so I got one of everything.Just like drive thru cashiers, grocery store clerks were always innocently drawing attention to a food binge, but I usually knew how to handle them.Sounds like a party to me!she respondedshe was a heavy set woman herself.I nodded, my cheeks red with humiliation as I glanced at the lanky teenage boy behind me in line.This time, when I got back to Juliens house, I didnt make any efforts to hide my contraband.Conveniently, Cecile was there to watch and judge as I shoved my bags and boxes of processed foods in the pantry and freezer, opting for a frozen pizza as my first meal.But after our unspoken truce that morning, she went easy on me.That looks like what I would buy if my dad let me get everything I want, she commented.Think of me as a cautionary tale, I joked, and shoved the oven closed a little too enthusiastically, causing the teakettle to rattle on top of the stove.After the requisite sixteen to twenty minutes, I retreated to the guesthouse alone and ate slice after slice of pizza in a half reclined state, my head propped on several pillows, my shorts unbuttoned to make room for my bloated belly.My thoughts bounced from Liam to Isabella and her sad story and finally to Julien, who was due home from the office any minute now.What would I say to him the next time I saw him?Could I hide out here for the rest of the night and erase my memory of the past twenty four hours by the time we reunite at breakfast tomorrow morning?Why did the thought of him coming on to me scare me so much?Could it be that somewhere, buried underneath my industrial sized crush on Liam, I had been harboring feelings for Julien too?Strangely enough, I had never imagined myself with someone older, despite my background; most girls like me had tried to replace their father with a boyfriend old enough to be one by the time they were out of high school.I wondered if it was possible that I had given off that vibe without even knowing itthe vibe of the girl with daddy issues.Or maybe, just maybe, Julien was the one I should be pining for, but I couldnt see how perfect he was for me through the Liam haze Figuring it out tonight was hopeless.I examined my last bite of pizza crust before stuffing it past my lips, already filled with regret.Thirteen Friday, July 2: Ocean View Baptist Church Overeaters Anonymous Meeting Topic of discussion: Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places Calories imbibed: 4,000 at least After forty eight hours of the most out of control food binging Id ever engaged inwhich involved, most shamefully, an entire box of frozen corn dogsI turned myself in to the Friday night meeting like a wanted criminal.In classic comic timing, the topic of discussion just so happened to be Looking for Love in All the Wrong Places.I had to laugh, even though I felt like throwing myself off a highway overpass.Marie, the meetings appointed speaker, was a tall, big boned woman who looked more athletic than overweight.She stood as she spoke, her hands laced together in front of her abdomen in a controlled manner.Her voice was raspy, her accent a pleasant Southern lilt.A lot of us seek disapproval instead of love from our significant others, she started.Its what some call a reverse codependency that keeps us stuck in our overeating patterns.As long as that other person is making us feel bad about the way we eat, we dont have to feel bad ourselves.Heck, we have a great excuse to keep doing it because that other person is being so cruel, right?But sometimes its more subtle.Sometimes we just fall in love with people who are emotionally unavailablemaybe they dont ridicule us, but they shut us down whenever we talk about things that are important, our feelings for instance.Bingo.Emotionally unavailable menthat was me.I hated feeling like a clich, but there it was.The problems Id been trying to stuff down with food the past couple of days could be summed up with those three words: emotionally unavailable men.The topic couldnt have been more relevant to my sad state of affairs.I leaned in to pay extra close attention as Marie went on to talk about her own experience.Her first husband, some human stain named Bogey, had tormented her by rigging their refrigerator with an alarm that went off whenever the door was opened.He also wouldnt allow her to serve her own food, insisting that he doled out healthier portions, and forced her to wear pants that didnt fit to remind her what size she had been when she married him.Luckily, her story had a happy ending, but her descriptions of a long dark period of secret eating and binging and purging after her divorce gave me chills.To call it a cautionary tale would be an understatement.When it came time for the free share, my hand shot up, acting independently of my conscious thoughts, and by some miracle, I was called upon.By another miracle, I actually spoke.Hi, Im Mischa, and Im an overeater.Hi, Mischa, the room responded.I sat up straighter, fueled by adrenaline just from saying my own name.Ive never shared before My voice immediately began to shake and I fought the urge to go silent.Ive been coming since I was fifteen, when I first decided I had a problem because I had stopped hanging out with certain friends just to eat more and not feel so bad about it.Pretty much all the skinny girls I knew, I had to stop being friends with.Just seeing them made me hate myself.And I was never that overweight, but its all relative, I guess.Ever since I can remember, Ive needed two sets of clothes for my weight fluctuations.Right now, Im so bloated I cant fit into any of my pants.Ive been eating pretty much nonstop for the past two days Some knowing hums greeted me as I glanced around the room.But today, I continued, I really want to give it up.For good.I didnt know I was going to say that just now, but I think I mean it.I laughed and felt comforted by the scattered laughs from others in the group.This last binge ended an hour ago, and it was pretty bad.More knowing hums all around.What started it was well, I got involved with a sex addict.I mean, I was fucking him I guess.Im sorry, excuse the harsh language.I just dont know how else to say it.I thought we were making love, but now that I know better, I think it was just fucking.The words that flowed out of my mouth felt somehow out of my control.It was as if someone had pushed me onstage at an amateur comedy night and I had unexpectedly taken to the microphone.We only got together twice, really, but in my pathetic excuse for a love life that is like an epic romance.And ever since he told me he cant be with me because of his sex addiction, Ive been driving myself crazy with thoughts about how Im inadequate how, if he really liked me, he would find a way to be different.Which is really backwards, and I know love doesnt work that way, and the fact that Im even calling it love shows how messed up I am.But I dont know.I shook my head and noticed my commiserators doing the same.The last time, it felt different.For me at least.So for a second I was the idiot thinking, Maybe this is good.But why would I think that?And then, this other thing happened with my boss, who I also live with.We sort of held hands the other night, but hes hardly spoken to me since.Hes way older, and he has a fourteen year old daughter who thinks I have a crush on him, even though I really dont.Although, now Ive been thinking about it and wondering if maybe I do.He has this aura about him and hes so sophisticated, I feel like if he were to choose me, that would mean I was special.But I dont know, I thought I just looked up to him How food is supposed to solve any of this I have no idea, but Ive been eating enough for a goddamn army.I paused for a breath.A couple of the women around me seemed to be in minor states of shock.I had forgotten this was technically a Baptist church, and some of the words I had been throwing around certainly did not qualify as reverent.What a jump I had made from nonparticipating wallflower.Im sorry for my language.But that felt really good.Thanks for listening.I sank back into the pew, exhausted from my mini catharsis.To my surprise, the next person who spoke thanked me and offered her own similar story of unrequited love, sans the salty language.The things she said struck a chord, and I found myself really listening and caring about another persons experiences in a way that I hadnt before.Despite all the hours Id spent in meetings just like this one, I had never fully grasped the sense of community and support OA had to offer.Before it had been a one sided experience in which I listened without participating, observed without exposing my own flaws.But today I felt like Id been split open, and some strange version of happy was starting to replace all my sad.When the meeting came to a close, we all said what we were grateful for, and I gave an answer that, again, surprised me as it came out of my mouth.Everything, I said.And even though it drew some suspicious looks, I really, really meant it.I was inexplicably thankful for every single great and terrible thing that had led me to this point.Maybe its why Id said I was thankful for my dad those weeks ago when Id been caught off guard by the first gratitude share.If it hadnt been for him, after all, I wouldnt be here.And if it hadnt been for Liam and Julien and Cecile, and my unclear future, and my problematic eating, and my extra fifty pounds, I wouldnt have reached my breaking point today.All of it was what made me me at this very moment, and if I didnt choose to like myself now, I may as well tie a trip wire to a doorknob and wait for the next prison guard to relieve me of my shift.Epiphanies are a wonderful thing.Like a recently awakened, slap happy coma survivor, I decided to think of everything I was legitimately grateful for: the sunshine, the beach, this meeting, OA, all the healthy foods Id ever eaten and all the ones I planned to eat in the futureincluding but not limited to the Mischa Jones Patented Juice Cleanse!my job, good old flaky Sasha Myers, Juliens guesthouse that I got to live in rent free, Juliens tortured and complicated daughter, Isabella (!!), Gracie (!!), and Liams tight pants (even if I never got to see them again), my childhood dog Jolene (named after the Dolly Parton song), my mother I could have gone on like that for hours, throwing my arms around everything in my life as if Id just unwrapped it on Christmas morning and discovered that it was exactly what I wanted.Walking out to the parking lot, I was stepping on softer ground, breathing better air.I felt like someone had saved me from a burning building and now it was time for me to pay it forward.I decided to call my mother right there from the parking lot and left a mushy voice mail about how much I loved her.After that I left another for Gracie, a long rambling speech about friendship and fate and how Id die without her, then repeated the sentiment in a message to Isabella.Hanging up, I decided to make some plans: First, I would throw away all the junk food I had left in Juliens pantry, burn it if possible; second, I would eat a healthy snack, maybe talk to Cecile if she was around, see if I was on her good side today; third, I would take a walk; fourth, do some sit ups; fifth, make a to do list for tomorrow and get to bed early I was whispering this laundry list to myself, walking faster than normal with an (inevitably) insane looking grin on my face, when a frantic male voice called out from behind.Milla!Hey!Hey there!Meena, Milla?Hello?Answering reluctantly to these approximations of my name, I turned around to find Bobby, Liams sponsor, speed walking toward me, pumping fists and all.He was downright winded by the time he reached me, as if he had just run a mile.I need your help, he said between gasps.Im looking for Liam.He didnt show tonight.Im sorry, I dont know where he is, I said, adding, Im turning over a new leaf!as if someone like Bobby cared.He looked at me quizzically.Have you tried the restaurant?I stated the obvious with a polite little shrug.They havent seen or heard from him in three days.Milla, this is important.Have you talked to him at all?Im actually Mischa, I clarified, not Milla.Bobby jerked his necked impatiently.Im sorry, Mee shah, can you remember the last time you saw or heard from him?I saw him Tuesday.And where was that?At his restaurant.He was working, I said, leaving it at that.Okay, listen.Weve gotta find him.Bobby continued to sound very desperate.One side of the chain that held his drugstore reading glasses had come undone and was dangling around his neck.Personally I didnt see how someone like Liam falling off the map for three days could warrant this much hysteriaa grown man with a sex addiction was liable to go missing sometimes, no?Bobby, he doesnt want to talk to me, I said.And frankly, I dont want to talk to him.Why dont you just wait till he comes down from his latest binge, or whatever you call it.Im sure hell be fine.The last time Liam missed a meeting, he was considering suicide, okay?Does that sound serious enough to you?Bobby jerked his head again and placed his hands on his hips, his spindly arms looking like they belonged to a skinny teenager.I froze upon hearing the word suicide, officially shocked out of my good mood.If Liam hadnt told me about his attempt to jump off a bridge at eighteen, I would have thought Bobby was exaggerating.Unfortunately, I knew he wasnt.Of course it does.Well, I dont know what your new leaf entails, but I would hope that helping friends in need is part of it, instead of just standing there bug eyed.Hearing this, I tried to make my eyes less big but couldnt.And then came the inevitable realization that it was my duty to help.If I was really turning over a new leaflike he said, like I had saidthen I had no other choice.Fine, I answered after another moment of mulling it over.What can I do?* * * Bobby didnt really explain where we were going.He just instructed me to follow his car, and I did so blindly, trusting that he hadnt been secretly plotting my death and using Liam as a way to get me alone on the edge of a cliff somewhere.He drove slowly through the main drag of Oceansideso slowly that I had to stop at two red lights because hed inched through the yellow like a slug.Fifteen minutes into the drive, I followed him up a hilly street that Id never seen before, lined with nice houses.At the top of the hill, we stopped outside a gated lot, the house obscured by lush palms all around the periphery.Bobby pulled to the curb, parked, and put on his hazard lights.As he walked to my car, his puny chest puffed out as far as it would go.I rolled down my window, bracing myself for whatever was next.So I need you to call up, just press the button on that box at the gate, he said, pointing authoritatively.Where are we?I must have been completely disoriented, or the obvious answer wouldnt have evaded me so easily.Liams house, Bobby answered like I was crazy.Youve never been here?I shook my head.I chose not to explain that Liams and my relationship had only involved sex in public places.Well, I think he will buzz you in, hopefully.Thats the plan anyway.Then Im gonna sneak my car in behind yours, and youll be free to go.Isnt that kind of misleading?Im not worried about misleading.Im worried about saving a life.Bobbys plan wasnt what I had been expectingalthough what I had been expecting was anybodys guess.I started to question his level of intensity and whether or not his claims about Liams mental state might be a little overblown.However, I had agreed to help, and if this is what helping entailed, I figured I should take a shot.All right, I said after a few seconds of hesitation.Make it sound like youre here for a rendezvous, okay?Make it suggestive.What?I took offense to Bobbys command, but he didnt seem to care.He gave me a thumbs up and ran back to his idling car.Despite my misgivings about the covert ops style mission Liams sponsor had concocted, I pulled forward, waiting to approach the gate until Bobby had maneuvered his car behind mine.At the bottom of the driveway, the call box was positioned just as it would be at a drive thru.In other words, I drove up to it expertly and rolled my window down out of sheer muscle memory.The ringing seemed to go on forever after Id pressed the red button that loomed below the speaker.I hung up once and redialed, as if that would make some sort of differencewhich it did, I found out, after four more rings.Liam answered without saying anything.I knew he was there because I could hear him clearing his throat.Liam?Its Mischa.To the best of my abilities, I tried to sound flirtatious, or at least hide the fact that I was still mending from the massive heartbreak hed caused.Whatre you doing here?Liam was slurring, but somehow his Australian accent helped instead of hindered.Are you okay?I went to the restaurant looking for you.For a bad liar, I sounded pretty convincing.Ya wanna come up?he asked.Sure.I tried not to sound overeager.I need to see you.Then tell that fucker to get off your tail, he snarled through the call box.I tensed in my seat.He knew.Trying my best to sound clueless, I asked what he was talking about.You know what Im talking about.Tell Bobby to leave me hell alone.He doesnt get it, got it?He doesnt get me.But if you wanna see me?Be my guest.Cant turn down a pretty face.But, Liam Im not talking to him.Thats the deal.Take it, leave it.Fine.Hold on.I took my finger off the red button.Somewhat reluctantly, I got out of my car and made my way back to Bobbys station wagon.I was afraid of him the way I had been afraid of my high school gym teacher, another stern nerd with an undercurrent of mania.Liam knows youre here.I think hes drunk.He says hell let me in if you leave.Bobby banged his steering wheel and let out an irritated exhale followed by a couple of deep breaths.This was a man in desperate need of anger management training.Your presence will do him no good.Im the one he needs to see, he said.Im sure youre right, but I dont know what to do.I looked back toward the house, wondering how I could possibly handle the situation if Liam was in fact on the brink of suicide.This was your idea, I reminded him.Fine, said Bobby, exhaling through flared nostrils.Listen Dammit Just tell me what you want me to do when I get up there.I was becoming impatient, worried my invite would be rescinded if I waited too long.You need to get him to call me.I shook my head.What if he refuses?I cant force him to do something he doesnt want to do.Someones gotta stay with him through the night, okay?And it looks like it has to be you.In his voice was resignation, defeat.I actually felt bad for him.Did this man have a life outside of Liam?Was there a Mrs.(or Mr. )Bobby to go home to?Are you married?I asked.I couldnt help myself.Bobby held up his left hand indignantly.Happily, he answered.Why?No reason.Listen, Ill try to get him to call you.As I started to back away from his car, Bobby reached out to grab my right hand like he was trying to yank me inside.Do not have sex with him!Do you understand?Are you kidding me?I said, ripping my hand away.Who do you think is the sex addict here?Bobby scowled and shifted his car into drive.Liam could do a lot better than you, you know.Ha.I couldnt believe the same person who had begged for my help was actually insulting me.Actually, I think its you he could do better than.Although I tried to hide it with anger, I felt Bobbys put down killing the good mood Id just been enjoying.Of course I knew Liam was out of my league, but to hear someone else say it brought me right back to high school, to all the times Id been teased for being too short and too curvy, for having big breasts, or for buying an extra slice of pizza at school lunch.I turned and marched back to my car, willing the newly enlightened Mischa to make a reappearance.I am here for Liams sake, I coached myself.This is not about me, or my insecurities, or Bobbys stupid insults.Good work.Liams voice piped in over the speaker box as Bobbys car disappeared over the hill.Thanks, I said, not quite sure what I was in for as the solid wood gate that stood before me disappeared into the stucco wall that lined the property.Fourteen I hadnt imagined Liam as a homeowner.In my mind, he lived in an apartmenton the nice side, but certainly not a penthouse or anything so lavish.Yet here he was, in a neighborhood so nice I had never even heard of it before.I advanced slowly up the windy driveway to his housea white, modern looking affair surrounded by lush green palms lit by spotlights.The place was intimidating to say the least, the kind of swanky retreat that would be profiled in an interior design magazine.Had he really made that much money being in a band?I had mistakenly assumed that Liams story was just like the ones I had seen on TV about musicians who had made money too young and lost it all on drugs or gambling or multiple divorces, or all of the above.But clearly he had done all right for himself.Before getting out of the car, I glanced in the rearview mirror and cursed my flat hair that desperately needed a trim.I adjusted my bra underneath my shirt, a little boost to the cleavage, and checked my teeth.Then I remembered the state that Liam was supposedly in and cursed myself for being vain.The truth was, I had jitters about what I was walking into and worried that I wouldnt be able to do or say the right thing to help him if he was in dire straits.I had spent the past few days trying my best to forget how much I cared about Liam, to write him off as an ill advised fling, but now I was being asked to care about him again and my feelings had come back all too easily.I desperately wanted to be the one who could help him and worried it might send me into a deep depression if I failed.Nervously, I made my way down a dimly lit stone path to the front door, which opened just as I walked up.Loud rock music blasted from somewhere, seemingly everywhere, probably through speakers set inside the walls or something fancy like that.Liam was already walking away from the door, his back to me as he patted his right hip to the music.Oh no.I am officially entering the void.I wandered inside and shut the heavy wooden door behind me.There was silenceno pleasantries exchanged, no faux polite greetingsas he led me past the dark wood staircase in the foyer and into the kitchen where a sea of liquor bottles littered the counter.For the first time that Id ever seen him outside work, Liam wasnt dressed like hed been styled for some edgy rocker photo shoot; instead, he was wearing loose, navy blue athletic pants and a faded, tight gray T shirt.Grabbing one of the bottles, an expensive looking Scotch, he unscrewed the cap with his teeth and took a swig before turning to face me.Liams face was a wreckas much as it could be at least.Dark circles loomed under his eyes.The stubble on his cheeks was patchy, as if he had started to shave but given up out of exhaustion.So what?Are you here to save me?Bobbys worried about me so he sent a little Trojan horse?Liam finally made eye contact with me.There was sadness in his glassy eyes.I shrugged, fighting the urge to run to him, throw my arms around him.He said youve been MIA for three days.And the last time that happened I got all sad, right?Did he tell you that?Yes.Drink?He held out his bottle of Scotch.No thanks.Im sorry, I formed that as a question.What I meant was: drink.He walked around to the side of the counter where I was standing and placed the bottle in my hands, manipulating my fingers so that they grasped its neck.Please, join me in my misery, Mischa.Before I could think to protest, I took a small swig.The Scotch burned my throat.Liam snapped his bottle back with a fake look of disgust.Lightweight, he teased.He shuffled over to the fridge, retrieved a bottle of water, and walked it over to me.Wait, he said, and fumbled for a glass in one of the cupboards.Only the finest for my finest guest.He twisted the cap off the bottle and poured the water.Youre scaring me, Liam, I said as I accepted the glass.Youre not acting like yourself.As if you know who myself is!As if Bobby knows who myself is!You know who I am?You see this house?Look He took my wrist in his free hand and led me clumsily out a sliding glass door to the backyard.On a flat stretch of lawn, there was a bizarre looking mountain of guitars and amplifiers, most of them bashed in and torn up.I saw an ax, a shovel, and a shiny aluminum baseball bat lying on the ground by the detritus.Whoa, I muttered.Yeah, whoa.Liam picked up the bat and began swinging away at a semi intact electric guitar.You should try it!Its very cathartic.What are you doing?Why are you destroying your instruments?My instruments?Ha ha.Ive got the only instrument you need right here, baby.He dropped the bat and walked deliberately toward me with his lips puckered, taking my face in his hands as if he were about to kiss me.Cmon, cant you just give me a smile?Liam, please.I grabbed his shoulders and held him at arms length.Talk to me.I know I dont know you that well, but Im the only person youve got right now.Tell me whats going on.Ignoring me, he leaned in, his mouth agape.I felt his breath, hot and sour smelling, against my lips.I hadnt realized it was possible that a kiss from Liam could ever be unappealing, but this time it was.No.I backed away, stumbling a little over my own feet and feeling my legs go weak.Deciding to sit before I fell, I allowed myself to crumple to the ground.I had no idea what I was doing; I was in over my head.Bobby was probably rightI wasnt the person Liam needed to see right now.But here I was.Liam went back to destroying his electric guitar with a bat, and it went on like that for several minutes.I sat and watched while he hacked away, neither of us speaking.I searched my brain for what to say but kept coming up empty.What would Bobby do?I thought to myself, only half kidding.And then it dawned on me: The minute he arrived, Bobby would have gone straight to pouring all of Liams alcohol down the drain, devoted twelve stepper that he was.I shook my head, ruling it out as an option.Being much smaller and weaker than the loose cannon who was presently bashing expensive musical equipment in front of me, I had no business agitating him any further.When Liam determined his latest victim was sufficiently wrecked, he dropped the bat and walked over to where I was sitting.I patted the ground beside me in the hope that he would sit, but he shook his head, hovering at my feet in a menacing stance, a demented twinkle in his eye.Wanna go to bed, little Mischa?Misch Misch?Mishmash?Thats not why Im here, I said, hiding my amusement at his silly riffing.Oh, screw that!Liams face twisted into a grimace.He kicked at an invisible object like a child who hadnt gotten his way.Yes, it is, he said.Youre just like all the others.Oh, really?Thanks a lot!I scrambled to my feet, briefly contemplating whether or not to storm out.What do you want me to say, Mischa?Youre a groupie.Youre a groupie and you dont even know it.Thats the saddest kind of groupie, dont ya think?I knew he was just lashing out, but I couldnt help taking it personally.Why dont you get off your high horse?Youre not a rock star anymore Liam scoffed, continuing on his tangent.Theres lots of different kinds of groupies, actually.Theres the party girls, who forget what band youre in after theyve sucked you off for a bump of coke.Theres the fucking gorgeous, delusional ones who think youre gonna want them as your girlfriend just because they let you put it in their backsides.Then theres the ones with their prized fake breasts, always wearing those tiny string bikini tops under their shirts, just begging you to ask them for a lap dance.And theres the ones who like to do it all together, groups of four or five girls who want you to do them all together.But you gotta watch out for those ones!Theres always some junkie in the mixeveryones having a good time except for the one quiet girl who ends up ODing in the bathroom at four a. m.  I get it, I interrupted, wanting to plug my ears at the mention of Liams sordid sexual history.Youve slept with a lot of people.Liam ran a hand through his hair, avoiding my irritated gaze.I need a drink.He stumbled back into the house and I followed, hating him but at the same time feeling sorry for how severely messed up he was.Part of me wondered how much that night at Sashas spa had played into this meltdown.Maybe it was a self centered thought, but it seemed plausible.I also wondered what the hell I could say to make any of it better.Inside, I slid the glass door closed behind me, and something small and hard nudged my lower back.Drink, I heard Liam say as he poked me with the open end of his Scotch bottle.Feeling emboldened, I took the bottle, reopened the sliding glass door, and hurled it at the mountain of destroyed guitars and amps.Ha!Now youve got it!he cried.Dont worry, doll, theres more where that came from.Seconds later he had located a half full bottle of tequila.What are you doing to yourself?I said.With one eye closed and the other trained on me suspiciously, he leaned back against the counter.His head wobbled as he slurred his words.Well!The drink is the only way to stop the sex, right?Gotta exchange one vice for the other, or elsehe made a blow up motion with his handsboom.Explosion.Life over.May as well die in a fiery car crashwhich the drink also helps facilitate.I pointed to the mountain of guitars outside.What about that?I bet those are worth a lot of money.Why would you destroy them like that?Because, princess, symbolism!The music is what made me badget it?Its why I had the groupies, and why I cared so much about fucking the groupies, and why the groupies took over my life and made me hate myself.Groupies didnt do anything to you.Just like food never made you fat, did it?Go to hell!I shouted, finally losing the shred of cool I had been holding on to.Liams words had run me through like a sword.Tears welled up in my eyes but I fought them back.Hey, dont be mad.You know I like a girl with a little extra.Youve got it in all the right places, baby.And now youre trying to throw it in my face.Liam raised his voice and advanced toward me.You remind me why I cant have sex anymore without hating myself!Yeah, well you remind me that I dont love myself enough to be with a normal person!You remind me why Ive wasted years pining over assholes!But you know what?I wanna get better, and I am going to get better.Oh, are you?Liam said.He was only inches from me now.I could see his chest heaving.Good luck with that.Thanks, I appreciate it.I rolled my eyes, feeling certain now that my presence was doing more harm than good.Accepting defeat, I grabbed my keys from the counter and started out of the room.Nobody changes, Mischa, Liam called after me.Youre screwed, and Im screwed.We may as well screw each other, no?I grunted loud enough for him to hear.I was angrier than Id ever been, even angrier than the first time Bradley had ignored me on campus after our breakup.Turning as I reached the hallway, I flipped Liam off with both middle fingers before charging out and straight out that stupid, heavy front door.I doubted hed follow, but when I got to my car, Liam was right behind me, panting for breath.Wait!Mischa!I was kidding.Dont leave.He sounded frantic, but I had lost all sympathy.Please, just stay out of my life, I said.Unlocking the car, I remembered the one thing I was supposed to accomplish.Oh, and call Bobby.Hes convinced youre going to kill yourself, but I know now youre too narcissistic for that.I tried to slide into the car through the narrow opening Id made with the door, but Liam stopped me, placing his hand proprietarily on my waist and whipping me around to face him.Up close, he smelled of pure alcohol.I didnt mean it, he slurred gently.Which part?A better person would have wrestled her way out of his grasp, but I still found his touch hard to resist.Im a fucking mess, Mischa.Liams face crumpled and he started to weep, at first silently, then in a sad, high pitch that made him sound almost childlike, like a helpless animal.There was nothing for me to do, it seemed, other than commiserate.I gave up feeling angry, reaching around him to pat his back.Hunched over me, Liam laid his forehead on my shoulder and continued to cry.The other times I had had Liam within my grasp, he had been powerful, voracious, predatory.Now he was vulnerable, even weak.Im sorry.Its gonna be okay, I said, even though I had no idea how anything was going to be okay.I didnt know Liam well enough to know whether he would succeed or fail in this life.In a way, he had been right about me being just another groupie.
