Its been a long time.Yes sir, Sean would say.Welcome home.Thank you, son.You about ready to start those fiddle lessons?Maybe.You about ready to explain that car in the lake?If the cabin and the house were the two most likely places for her dad to show up, she couldnt spend the night at Seans house.And what he didnt know couldnt hurt him.Laura knew shed be fine, home alone behind the new deadbolts, and she had more than enough reading material to last through her vigil.Sitting on the living room floor, surrounded by dozens of journals, she chose one at random and opened it to an entry from a January day: The crocuses will be up soon.In the middle of winter, her mom had longed for flowers.Theyd been a recurring theme in her life.Having recently browsed through the bulk of over thirty years worth of journaling, Laura saw other themes too.It was like working on a thousand piece jigsaw puzzle.She had gradually become familiar with colors and patterns.Shed started to see which pieces might fit together to make recognizable images.But she didnt have a puzzle box with the complete picture printed on it for reference.If it were a puzzle, shed start with the edge pieces that hemmed everything in.Then shed look for pieces that held distinctive elements, like lettering on a sign or unusual colors.But she couldnt distill the years of a familys life together into a single snapshot.If it could be an image at all, it would have to be a panoramic view that covered both space and time.A cross between a timeline and a map of her familys journey with their fellow travelers.It would include landscapes and weather too.She couldnt separate them; they existed in each other.Sunshine beating down on the streets of Prospect.Storms rolling through the mountains.A sprawling picture began to take shape in her mind.Railroad tracks curved across one corner, bringing a train into town through the bright green of the kudzu.In sharp detail in the foreground, blackberries gleamed in the brambles.Flowers bloomed everywhere in every color, under a sky of a million shades of blue and gray.On the far left, she saw young lovebirds as theyd been before their baby girl came along.A gentle musician turned combat scarred veteran.His flower child wife whod never dreamed of being married to a soldier.Farther along, thered be a carrot top mama with a carrot top baby on her hip.Farther still, thered be a red headed toddler playing with blocks on a sunny kitchen floor or falling asleep to her dads lullabies.Then came school days with Cassie and Seanand tow headed Tig dogging their steps.Darker colors came next.The veterans moods worsened, but even the darkest days included the bright threads of his wifes soothing words and the loyalty of his friends.Not just Gary and Ardelle, but the musicians whod drifted in and out of the house.Especially Doc, Noodle, and Gibby.She wished she could erase Gibby from the picture.Dale too, but he was part of it.His wife hid in the shadows, barely there.In her mind, Laura moved toward the right side of the panorama.High school.A bright red truck.Initials carved into an old picnic table.Seans blue eyes and wry smile.The childhood scars he hid under his shaggy hair.The argument shed overheard as a teenager would be there too, in dark, muddy paints slashed with a violent red and venomous green.Betrayal, jealousy, rage.Hamlin Lake haunted the background, its bright blue waters beautiful and dangerous.The mountains stood behind everything else, holding their secrets tightly.Jessamyn Gantt had held her secrets tightly too, all the way to the grave, but her husband might come back from the dead and reveal at least some of them.It was late, and Cassie wanted to go to bed.The three of them had been sitting together in the living room for a solid hour, and it was beginning to feel like an interrogation room.Her head hurt and her heart ached for her parents.Her mom seemed incapable of cooperating, and her dads patience had worn thin.Come on, Mom, Cassie said in her most soothing tone.Just admit it.Its not a big deal if you took a partially used bottle of cologne.Laura would have thrown it out anyway.Her mom sniffled.Stop fussing at me.I didnt do anything wrong.At least admit that you let yourself in sometimes when she wasnt home.Of course I went over there sometimes.I missed going over to feed Mikey.I liked walking into the house.Sometimes I could almost believe Jess was still alive.I could pretend shed walk in and start a pot of coffee and wed have a nice, long talk.Thats a little weird, Mom.Dont be rude, Cassandra Jane.Yes, I might have done more than Laura asked me to do, but stop accusing me of things.Ardie, Gary said softly.Ive smelled a new scent on you lately.Like the one Laura described to Cassie.The one thats missing.Stop it!Ardelle stood up, her chest heaving.Ill be scrapping.Leave me alone.She walked out of the room.Cassie rubbed her eyes and peered at her dad.He looked like a guy whod been on a bender.Bleary eyes, messy hair, his shirttails hanging out.It was so unlike him.Moving like an old man, he heaved himself out of his chair.Then he stood motionless.The mover and shaker didnt know what to do next.Mom needs help, Cassie said.She needs counseling.Of course she does.Ill ask Doc for some recommendations.He hung his head.Shell be so embarrassed.She shouldnt be.She shouldnt be embarrassed if she needs meds either.Well get through this.Together.All of us.I hope youre right.Cassie had never seen him so sorrowful.So lost.She crossed the room, kissed his cheek, and felt tears on his skin.Oh, Dad.Itll be okay.I hope so.Well just have to start looking for that perfume.Cologne.Whatever it is.Why is it so important to find it?If we find it, shell have to admit she took it.Shell have to admit shes been lyingabout all of it, probably.That might be the first step.Cassie didnt like his theory, but she didnt have anything better to offer.This is a huge house, and it could be anywhere.Then lets get busy.Still moving like an old man, he left her there.Shaken by the condition of her parents marriage, Cassie was suddenly terrified for her own.Late in Georgia was still a decent hour in California.She sank into the cushy chair again and pulled out her phone.Searching for cologne could wait until shed tried one more time to snag Drews undivided attention.Voice mail.She groaned.Waiting for the tone, she gave herself permission to be brutally honest.To say whatever came to her mind, no matter how bad it sounded.The tone came.Drew Cutler, I love you, she said, good and loud.But Im tired of sharing you with your mistress.Your business.And Im tired of being broke and far away from my family and your family, and I want to have your babies before Im too old and I want them to look just like you because I love you so much, but if you decide youd rather be married to your business instead, then you can have little business babies someday with your business mistress but Im not sharing you anymore.Do you understand?She slapped at the tears wetting her cheeks.If you love me, youll call me back this instant, and we wont stop talking until weve worked things out, and the stupid cologne hunt can just wait.Call me back now.Closing her phone, she started crying in earnest.He would think shed gone crazy.Maybe she had.In the middle of a horrible, ugly sob, she jumped out of her skin.That was Drews ringtone.Afraid to answer, afraid not to answer, she stared at the screen.Sean and Keith had parked their trucks at a construction site down the road and walked to the cabin.Now they were hiding high on the hill above it.Dales truck was gone before they got there, and if Elliott was near, he wasnt making himself obvious.Theyd caught no scent of wood smoke, no motion, no light except the stars and the moonlight and the occasional airplane cruising across the sky.Most of the long, uncomfortable night still stretched out before them.Hunkered down on a small tarp atop the springy leaves, Sean wondered how many snakes might be annoyed with the intruders and how many ticks and kudzu bugs might be impervious to bug spray.Best not to think about it.Before night fell, hed taken a good look around.The cabin, nestled in a shallow valley, was nearly covered with kudzu.One look at the fallen roof and vine choked floor had told him no sane person would try to live there.Therefore Elliott might.Sean checked his phone to make sure it was on.Laura probably wouldnt call, but he wanted to be available if she needed him.He leaned back on his folded jacket, watching the lights of a jet bound south for Atlanta.Even up in the mountains, miles into the wilderness, a man wouldnt be able to escape civilization completely.Every few minutes, another plane flew over.He thought of a September morning when four planes screamed down from a blue sky and changed America forever.He wasnt a military man, but the video clip that had moved him the most had shown a mob of people racing down the sidewalks of DC.Hed thought they were running away, but then the camera had panned out, showing the truth.Those people were running toward the Pentagon.Bent on rescuing friends and strangers, theyd run straight into death and destruction.Elliott, if hed been there and in his right mind, would have been in the thick of it too.But he probably hadnt been in his right mind for years.Probably wouldnt be, ever again, unless God worked a major miracle.A miracle on a par with restoring lost limbs.Sean had never seen even a minor miracle.Not one.And he lived in the Bible Belt.The lights of another plane drifted into view, reminding him of those few, eerie days when no planes flew.The sky had been empty.Nothing came between the earth and heaven.Nothing came between humanity and the eyes of God.The brothers stayed silent, watching lights glide across the black sky, watching the changeless darkness in the direction of the cabin.Sean fought to keep his eyes open.The tarp rustled as Keith shifted his weight.I still say its past time to get a little help from law enforcement, he whispered.Sean drew a slow breath.Maybe.But the sheriff thinks the rumors are bogus, and he doesnt understand some of the underlying issues.Id rather leave him out of it.Okay, but we should at least track down all the sightings and plot them on a map.Who saw him, and when and where.It might help narrow it down.We might not have time for a scientific approach.A faint, metallic ping charged the air.Sean froze, electrified.Keith caught his breath and held it.They sat in complete stillness, listening, but it didnt happen again.The sound, so brief and unexpected, could have been a small noise nearby or a loud noise made faint by distance.The hair rose in prickles on the back of Seans neck like it did when he was hunting and a deer was nearby.Couldve been Dale, Keith said, barely audible.But Sean thought of the missing wind chimes.When he cocked his head, listening, he thought he heard a soft, faraway laugh.Although it was nearly three in the morning, Laura hadnt even been tempted to nod off.The journals scattered across the floor would have kept her thinking even if she hadnt been watching for her dads return.If she didnt connect with him soon, she might miss her chance forever.And there had to be at least one person who would give Elliott Gantt a chance to prove he was harmless.She had to welcome him home with open arms.Shed spent hours browsing her mothers writing.Most of it was shallow, self absorbed nonsense, but the earliest journals had been different.Theyd bubbled with life and love.Now Laura wasnt even sure where to find them.Shed made a mess of Ardelles chronological orderon purpose, maybe.Laura stood up and walked among the stacks and spills of the slender volumes.She found half a dozen of the cheap, spiral bound notebooks from the early years.Taking them back to the couch, she curled up with the quilt.She started with the one that opened with Jess Gantt as a young, pregnant wife.E.  worries about Agent O. , shed written.Such a pessimist.I keep telling him the baby will be absolutely perfect.Tears sprang to Lauras eyes.Shed never given much thought to it, but it made sense that he would have been exposed to Agent Orange.Of course he would have worried about birth defects, not to mention health issues for himself.She opened three more notebooks, checking their dates, before she found the one that covered her birth.There was nothing for the day she was born, but on the next day her mother had written: No time to journal yesterday.Laura Lillian made her appearance at 4:48 p. m.  My baby girl is perfect.E.  said she looks just like me, and he added with a grin: Thank God!I am SO thankful.Laura shook her head.Early in their marriage, her parents must have been happy.They must have been in love.A faint meow brought Laura back to the present.Two frail old souls were out there tonight: her dad and Mikey, whod slipped between her feet hours before when she went out to get the mail.The cat had made himself scarce, but now he was yowling at the door.Pathetic old thing.He wanted his independence, but he was too elderly, too frail to live in a world filled with fast cars and mean dogs and coyotes.In warm sweats, Laura left the quilt on the couch and walked into the kitchen, dimly lit by reflections from the outdoor security lights.She breathed faster, remembering the bearded man whod watched her from the window.She still wasnt absolutely certain it had been her father.But it would only take a few seconds to let Mikey in and lock the door again.The chances of someone being out there at that particular moment were minuscule.She would be fine.The cat meowed again.In the distance, a dog barked.Hang on a second, Mikey.Aware that the glaring lights might make her visible too, she felt for the switch and shut them off.The instantaneous blackness provided a new sense of concealment.She unlocked the door and opened it a few inches, just wide enough to admit a skinny cat.Mikey hurtled between her feet like a small, furry rocket.Through the crack, she saw a dark figure approaching from the far corner of the porch.She screamed, slammed the door and slapped the deadbolt home, her fingers like ice.Footsteps whispered unevenly but swiftly across the planks and down the steps.She leaned on the door, holding her breath.Listening.Her pulse hammered in her ears.Dad, she called with her mouth to the door.Dad, is that you?A tree branch creaked.Daddy?There was no sound but the wind and the fierce pounding of her pulse.She could almost believe shed imagined seeing someone, but she knew she hadnt imagined the footsteps.Limping footsteps.Dale didnt limp.Her dad had never limped before, but maybe he did now.Maybe he cut down wind chimes and prowled church camps and visited porches in the middle of the night.Maybe he didnt want a reunion with her.What did he want, then?God, help me, she said softly.I dont know what to do.Chilled all over, she pushed a chair under the doorknob then retreated to the den, where she opened her phone.Trying to decide whether to call 911 or Sean, she hesitated.If he knew someone had been on her porch, he would make the 911 call himself.The sheriff and his deputies would show up with their cars and searchlights, with guns and dogs.They would go after her dad like theyd go after a common criminal.Laura shut her phone.She wasnt calling anybody.He deserved a chance.And if the man on the porch wasnt her dadshe still had his guns, and she knew how to use them.Cassie glared at the bedside clock.Five?Seriously, she was awake at five?Eastern?Shed stayed up half the night talking to Drewwonderful, adorable Drewbut then shed tossed and turned for hours, trying to imagine their unsettled future.Might as well get up and keep looking for that blasted Jean Nat, but she was starting to doubt Lauras crazy accusations.Wrapped in a warm robe shed snagged from her moms closet earlier in the week, Cassie padded slowly down the hallway toward the bathroom and tried to decide which room to search next.She didnt want to make a lot of noise while her parents were sleeping.Then she noticed a light under the door to the scrapping room.Her mom wouldnt be up so earlywould she?Slowly, Cassie turned the doorknob.Slowly, she opened the door.In her favorite flannel pajamas, her mother was sound asleep in her comfy swivel chair in front of the cabinet where she kept her supplies.Her mouth was open, and she was snoring ever so faintly.Cassie tiptoed across the room to the worktable.A half finished scrapbook lay open to pages devoted to photos of Trevor.They were artistically arranged, embellished with stickers and shiny confetti, and captioned neatly.HalloweenTrevor as Captian Jack, one of the captions read.The misspelled word was glaringly obvious.Cassie looked back at her mother and was struck by the odd placement of her chair, smack dab in front of the cabinet.As if she were guarding it.Pondering her options, Cassie realized she couldnt open either of the cabinet doors without nudging her moms legs aside and waking her up.But thered be no better way to startle her into an unrehearsed reaction.Cassie approached, quickly but quietly.She bent over and opened the right hand door until it bumped against her mothers leg.Oops, Cassie said cheerfully.Sorry.Scuse me.Mmm?Scootch over a little, please.Still half asleep, Ardelle obeyed.She even scooted her chair a little, making things easier.But when Cassie opened the door fully, Ardelle came fully awake.Get out of my cabinet!Too late.Cassie reached for the tiny bottle of Jean Nat.Oh, Mom.What else have you got?Sean ached with fatigue as he and his brother trudged back to the construction site, just past dawn.What a waste of time.Theyd sat on the cold ground all night but hadnt seen or heard anything except that faint, metallic ping.And birds and bugs.Andmaybesomeone laughing at them.Long before dawn, birds had started calling.Mosquitoes woke up, hungry.A big, hazy peach of a sun came up.Hoping for a sign of life, theyd stayed a few more minutes.No dice.Keith, facing a day of work on no sleep, drove away first.The taillights of his truck disappeared around the curve as Sean was still climbing into his own truck.A quarter mile down Porter Road, he spotted Granny Colfax walking the other way.There wasnt much traffic yet, just a few people headed out to start their ordinary days.He couldnt remember the last time hed had one of those.He swung into Lauras driveway and rubbed his eyes.What was her car doing there?She was supposed to be at his house.But a few lights were on inside, and everything looked normal.Maybe she woke early and came home to feed the cat.He climbed out and headed up the steps.The door swung open.She stood in the doorway, wearing her moms black and white bandanna.Good morning, she said.Good morning.He stopped two feet away from her, noticing the circles under her eyes.Sleep okay?Um, no.A faint blush stole across her cheeks.I was up all night.Mostly.You didnt stay at my house, did you?She shook her head.Why not?This is the second time you said youd stay somewhere else and then reneged on it.I wanted to be here in case my dad came back.And maybe he did.At three in the morning.Her eyes flickered to his left.I opened the door, and somebody was on the porch.She pointed.Right there.Whoever it was, he ran right past me.No wonder theyd had no luck by the cabin.Elliott had been at the house?On the porch?You opened the door in the middle of the night?I was letting Mikey back in, all right?And then my dador whoever it wascame from the corner of the porch.I screamed and slammed the door.He ran off the porch, limping.I yelled through the door because I thought it might be Dad.Her lips trembled.But he didnt come back.Did you get a good look at him?No, it was too dark Dark?He looked up at the porch ceiling, where the high intensity bulbs should have been blazing until full light.What happened to the security lights?I turned them off so if anyone was out there, they couldnt see me.He shook his head, but he couldnt chide her.Hed done the same thingbut not at three in the morning.She jerked in a short, sharp breath, her bravado dissolving.I sl slammed the door so fast.INo!Mikey!The cat had darted outside again, past both of them.Now he was hightailing it toward the road.For an old cat, Mikey sure could move.Laura ran down the steps, doing the Here kitty kitty kitty routine that usually brought the cat on the double.Not this time.Mikey was gone in seconds, disappearing into the tall roadside weeds.We shouldnt have been standing there with the door open, she said, stomping up the steps.Hed better not get hit.Sean couldnt remember the last time hed seen her so edgy.He couldnt blame her, but he wasnt in the mood to worry about a cat.He held the door open for her and followed her into the warmth of the house.What time did this happen?About three.Three.Thats right.You told me.Several hours after he and Keith had heard the noise near the cabin.So that could have been Elliott too.Or Dale.Or a stranger.The man on the porch might have been a stranger too.Or even Ardelle.Was it possible?Nothing had gone missing since hed changed the locks, but that didnt mean she wouldnt try to get in.She didnt live within walking distance anymore, though.It was already nearly full light.Afraid they were running out of time somehow, Sean paced the room, trying to think.Trying to focus.If it was your dad, why didnt he answer when you called out?I dont know, Sean.Same possibilities weve talked about over and over again.Maybe he was more afraid of me than I was of him.Sean shook his head, still trying to put everything together, and remembered the theory that had occurred to him in the middle of the night.If Laura was right about Gibby and Jess, it could explain not only Elliotts disappearance but also his reappearance.Maybe hed wanted revenge on Gibby but hadnt wanted to hurt Jess by acting on the impulse while she was alive.But if Elliott had somehow learned that shed passed away, he might have resurfacedjust when Gibby would be in town.Far away, a faint clang reminded Sean that the weekend was on its way.The PA system would start the canned music soon.Tonight the live bands would play.Main Street would be blocked off and swarming with tourists and locals.Downtown would smell like funnel cakes and cotton candy and beer.It seemed like some faraway planet, some silly world he used to live in.Lauras hand on his arm jolted him.Whats wrong, Sean?He tried to smile.Just about everything.Reaching with his other hand to pat hers, he noticed a yellowing bruise at her elbow.What happened there?Its nothing, really.Just a bruise.Her strange evasiveness piqued his curiosity.How did it happen?Iwell.You know, sometimes bruises just happen and you hardly remember how, later.But this one completely encircled her arm in a pattern all too familiar.The truth, Laura.Her shoulders rose and fell with a deep breath, and she met his eyes.Remember the day I gave you the songbooks?The day I ran into Dale in your driveway?He thought I was rude, so he grabbed my arm as I was walking away.Thats all.Thats all?Sean took her arm gently and examined the bruise.Hes not getting away with this.Its no big deal, she said, but there were tears in her eyes.Why didnt you tell me?I was afraid you would overreact.She gave him an impish smile.So prove me wrong, okay?Dont overreact.Our definitions of that word probably arent the same.I know, but let it go.Please.A little ol bruise wont matter if this is the day my dad comes back.She dabbed the corners of her eyes with her fingertips.Maybe hell sleep under his own roof tonight.She was pale.Exhausted.Shivering, probably not from cold but from nerves.Sean pulled her into his arms and leaned his head against hers, feeling her damp hair on his cheek and smelling her shampoo.Whatever happens, well go through it together.Closing his eyes, he flashed back to a hot August day.Laura, Cassie, and Tigger, their hands piled together with his, making a promise.Well always be there for each other.Remember?Laura nodded but didnt speak.When I say always, I mean always.The rest of our lives.She stiffened.She seemed to stop breathing.He held his breath too, waiting.She had to know he was talking about marriage.She looked up, her eyes shining with tears.Im afraid.Afraid of what?She lowered her gaze to his chin.When she finally spoke, he could hardly hear her.Your father.Dont call him that.Refusing to acknowledge that Dale is your father doesnt change facts.And even though I know youre nothing like him, I stillI worry.He must hate me like he hates my dad.Dont worry about it.Dale hates everybody.He hates my dad in particular.For rescuing you.Laura, weve been close since we were kids.I thought youd always been able to get past how vile Dale is.But nowwe dont have to stay here.If you want me to move to Denveror anywhere elseI will.She finally looked up, her eyes dark with sorrow.What if my dads back in Prospect?What then?Then well figure something out.Together.A long shriek of squealing tires twisted in the air.Mikey, Laura said with a catch in her voice.Mikeys been hit.Or missed.Sean looked out the window.Ill go see.Not just about the cat but about any signs that your visitor might have left behind.Ill go with you.No.Please.We still arent sure who were dealing with.Stay inside, doors locked.I dont care if the cat learns to speak English and comes back and says pretty please, dont open the door to anybody but me.He stole a quick kiss and left her standing there.He ran to the road and looked in both directions but didnt see a cat carcass anywhere.Hed be elected gravedigger if the cat had finally bought the farm.He was already Lauras locksmith, bodyguard, and detective.Who had time to run a business?Or talk a woman into marrying him?From the window, Laura watched Sean cross the road, his hair rippling in the wind.He slowed on the grassy shoulder and climbed the steps to the churchyard.At the top, he checked the view in all directions.He descended the steps and started down the road, walking fast.Somewhere on the north side of town, a slow moving freight blew its mournful whistle.The train would roll through Prospect, past the streets that were blocked off for the weekend.Past the kudzu jungle that had overtaken the berry patch.The train would pick up speed and keep going, leaving the town far behind.Wherever her dad was, he heard the whistle too.He was out there, somewhere.Listening.Ardelles yellow convertible swung into view and came to a stop behind Seans truck.Cassie was at the wheel.Forcing her face into some semblance of serenity, Laura opened the front door.Cassie hurried up the steps, holding a small cardboard box.One of those old, bronzy green garden markers stuck out of it.Her face was pale; her hair unbrushed.No makeup, no jewelry, and her eyes were puffy.She might have just rolled out of bed, or maybe shed been crying for hours.You okay?Laura asked.I spent half the night having the most wonderful knock down drag out argument with Drew, she said with a funny little smile.Ill explain later.Come on in.Whats in the box?Youre not going to believe it, she said, coming inside.Mom cant keep denying that she took anything.Shed stashed all kinds of stuff in her scrapbook cupboard.Stepping carefully through dozens of journals on the floor, Cassie made her way to the couch and sat down, still holding the box.You ready for some craziness?I hope so.Laura sat beside her.Cassie held up the bottle of Jean Nat.Its a scent Laura wouldnt wear anyway, she said in a spot on impression of Ardelles voice.Then theres this.She held up a tube of peachy pink lipstick.That looks exactly like a lipstick that used to be on my moms bathroom counter.Why am I not surprised?Cassie reached into the box again.She had these photos of your moms flower bedsmy mom says thats okay, theyre duplicates and shes sure you wouldnt mindand a copy of your moms obituary, but thats not something she swiped.Its been sitting around our kitchen for weeks.And theres one of those garden markers.Lets leave it in the box.I dont want to get dirt on your couch.Bewildered, Laura shook her head.Is there more?Oh yeah, and it gets weirder.She had the chain your dad used to wear.Cassie reached into the box again and handed Laura the chain with the silver cross and the dog tag still dangling from it.What?Id put them away in a drawer!Why would she snoop like that?And take something thats not hers?A memento of my dad, of all things.She didnt even try to explain that one.Or these.Cassie fanned out three Red Cross blood donor cards on the couch.Red and white plastic, like credit cards.Laura spread them out further to read the names.What on earth?She had my moms card, your dads, and mine?She took it out of my wallet?When?How?I dont know.Cassie shook her head.Im sorry.I dont get it.Me either.If I wasnt home, I would have had my wallet with me.And if I was home Laura stopped.When I was here for the funeral, she came over to help with housework.She was here for a couple of hoursso she could have taken my card and Moms, right under my nose.But why?Thats what Dad was trying to get out of her when I left.Hell call me if he can make sense of it.Laura took a closer look at the Red Cross cards and her dads dog tag, and her brain seemed to shut down.Maybe she was in denial, but she couldnt accept the most logical explanation.It didnt jibe with what she already knew.Or thought she knew.Why Garys donor card?This is all wrong.Cassieremember in high schoolthose boxes?What are they called?Punnett squares?Cassie frowned.Dont ask me.I didnt do well in geometry.Not geometry.Genetics.Biology with Preston.Oh, I wish Id told you everything a long time agobut this doesnt fit anyway.Laura, what are you talking about?Im pretty sure my mom had an affair.With Gibby.Cassies mouth fell open.Gibby?With wide eyes, she stared at the Red Cross cards.What are you saying?What does that have to do with I dont know.My brains on strike.Lauras voice cracked.I need to borrow someone elses.Who understands genetics?Preston.Of course.Preston.Laura picked up her phone and called him.Afraid shed lose her nerve, she jumped into it the moment hed said hello.Mr.Preston, this is Laura Gantt.I have a quick science question for you.About blood types.If the mom is AB and the father is A, can they possibly have a baby with Type O?That scenario isnt bloody likely.Preston laughed at his pun, then launched into a rambling explanation that included alleles, genotypes, and phenotypes.Laura, focused intently on the dog tag marked with her dads blood type, wasnt in the mood to grasp every last detail, but the gist of the matter was clear.Unless either the US Army or the American Red Cross had made a serious clerical error, she wasnt Elliott Gantts biological daughter.Thank you, Laura said.That helps.Ive got to run.Bye for now.She managed to get through it without letting her voice break.What did he say?Cassie asked.Im pretty sure they had their affair when I was a teenager, so it doesnt make sense that ImIm the wrong blood type.What?Laura, I dont understand.Im the wrong blood type to be my dads biological child.The weight of the statement pressed heavy on her shoulders.Cassies eyes widened, then narrowed.No way.Based onyou mean Her voice trailed off.Wait a minute.Lets think this through.It could meaneither youre wrong about the timing of the affair, or your mom had more than one affair.Shoot, I cant imagine her having even one.But where did you get your idea about the timing?I heard my folks arguing about it the summer after we graduated from high school.So you thought it had just happened?Yes.But maybe thats only when the truth came out.Laura nodded slowly.Maybe.Cassie stood.I need coffee.Theres no coffee.No grinder.Theres tea.As Cassie walked into the kitchen, muttering to herself, Laura reached for the last item, the garden marker from one of her mothers flower beds.Hemerocallis Honey Redhead.Hemerocallis.The botanical name for daylilies.Laura took a sharp breath.She lifted her hand to her hair.My honey redhead, my redhead honey.Poor little carrot top baby, you look more like your mama than your daddy.Somewhere in the back of her mind, she was aware of a vehicle roaring into the driveway.A door slamming.Whoa, Cassie called from the kitchen.My dads here, and he looks upset.Real upset, like he might be crying.Laura, this is scary.He never cries.Yes he does, Laura said under her breath.Shed seen Gary with tears in his eyes.The day theyd dropped off the tuna casserole.Shed thought he was worried about Ardelles agitation, but hed been talking about daylilies.Jess Gantts ordinary daylilies.Theyd had the power to make him cry?He bought me a daylily plant.Hes so sweet.He, shed written.Not E.  How quickly things can blossom overnight A month or two later, in a new journal, shed added the gloomy line that made Sean say she must have been in a bad mood.Something about the brightest blossoms turning to rot.Laura had just read that entry but couldnt quite remember it.Burying her face in her hands, she tried to recall the other sentence that included the word rot, followed by three more words that had been scribbled over.A three letter word, a four letter word, and me.Recalling their shape and sizeand beginning to understand the contextLaura knew what her mother had writtenand why.It wasnt merely that shed been in a bad mood.Shed been in the depths of despair.Shed written about it in a sort of code except for the last three words.A beautiful plant can spring from the rot, from the dirt.God help me.An affair had blossomed quickly but went sour just as quickly?And then shed learned she was pregnant.Gary stepped inside, shutting the door with a clatter.His usually neat hair was a mess, and he was breathing hard.Laura.Wheres Sean?Across the road, looking for my dad.He just might find him.The latest is that somebody saw him trotting alongside the road a few miles from here.Heading this way.Laura shot to her feet.Maybe her dad was the man whod been on her porchbut that made it even more urgent to discuss the rest of it with Gary.She had to know.Gary She couldnt believe she was about to say this.Theres something you and I need to clear up, right now.Ignoring Cassies bewildered whispers behind her, Laura picked up the garden marker.Did you give my mother an old fashioned daylily called Honey Redhead?The one that has bloomed in her yard for thirty years or so?Gary swallowed, his eyes shifting from side to side.Yes.Yes, I did.Did you know about the carrot top baby, the honey redhead who looked more like her mama than her daddy?No, youve never read my moms journalsbut I think Ardelle has.With watery eyes, he stared at the sad little prizes on the couch.I didnt know.Not until now.SheArdellejust told me what all these things mean.She knew about Jess and me.Cassie gasped.Dad!His chest rose and fell in a big breath.You have to understand.His voice broke.Iwith Jessit just happened.It didnt last long.He wiped tears away.I never dreamedJess never said a word about a baby.He met Lauras eyes.I always thought you were Elliotts.She was bewildered to the point of numbness, but she had no reason to doubt him.I believe you.He stared at her as if hed never seen her before, and she stared back.Flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone, fruit of his sinand her mothers.That sandy blond hair, the same color as her dads.Blue eyes.A similar build.Gary Bright and Elliott Gantt had sometimes been mistaken for brothers.Gary started talking fast.It wasnt long after he got out of the service.She fell apart when she was telling me about his new moods.His black moods.I gave her a hug, a friendly, brotherly hug, andthats how it started.I never told Ardelle.I thought it would be better that way, but she knew.Or at least she suspected.All this time.It has been terrible for her.No kidding!Cassies sass began to come back as she got in his face.Admitting its true is the first step.Thats what you just told Mom about a bottle of cologne.You hypocrite!I didntdidnt mean to be a hypocrite, he said.I only meant to leave it in the past.Ive been faithful to your mother ever since.Cassie, Im so sorry.So sorry.Cassie started talking right over his endless apologies.Laura, hardly listening, tried to process these strange new truths, but she could hardly breathe.Couldnt think.And Gibby?He hardly seemed to matter now.Im sorry, Gary said again.Not as sorry as you should be, Cassie said.How can you claim you didnt know?Look at Laura!I see it now.Sure, she has her moms eyes, but she looks like you too.Dad, Im so ashamed of you.Gary nodded, hanging his head, then turned to Laura.Your dad knew?I dont know.I heard him confronting my mom, years ago, but I thought he meantsomeone else.Her own voice seemed to come from a great distance.Garys face turned pale.What will he do to me if he comes back?I deserve it, butoh God.He nearly strangled me once for making a stupid wisecrack.What will he do if he knows about me and your mother?Andand you?The baby.Shaky and cold, Laura studied the cross and the dog tag on the silver chain.Emblems of Elliott Gantts faith, his service to his country, and his blood type, but she hadnt a drop of Gantt blood in her.Had he found out suddenly, a month before her eighteenth birthday?And staged his own drowning?She stood.I cant take any more of this.I cant sit here and hash things out while my dad Tripping on that word, she met Cassies glistening eyes.Looks like were half sisters.Cassie rushed her, enfolding her in a fierce hug.Theres nothing halfway about it.Were sisters.Weve always been sisters.Elliott was a brother to me.Gary let out a gut wrenching sob.I didnt just betray my wife.I betrayed my brother.With the silvery chain still dangling from her fingers, Laura hugged Cassie back, but she was frozen inside.Frozen and numb and very much afraid of what might happen next.Feeling alone and naked without his gun, Sean had walked down the road a quarter mile in each direction.Hed found no clue about what those shrieking brakes had meant.No cat, no man, no vehicle.Now, standing by Jesss grave, he heard the whine of a motorcycles engine.No, two.Two high powered bikes flashed into view, chasing the curves.Their riders crouched low in their bright leathers and whipped past, stirring the roadside weeds.The moment crystallized like a snapshot: the two bikerslife, noise, color, speedflying past the mild mannered sign in the churchs parking lot: COME WORSHIP WITH US.PASTOR HORACE REESE.THIS IS THE DAY.The day for what?They should have quoted the rest of the verse.The sound of the bikes faded into the distance as Sean studied Jesss grave.He felt cheated.No clues here.No footprints, no gray hair snagged on a branch.None of the convenient evidence that always popped up in TV shows.The azaleas had fallen over again.This time, nobody had righted them.Please, God, he whispered.If its somebodys day to diemake it the cat.But even if he found Mikey alive, how could he corral a tough old critter that wanted to remain free?Or if he found Elliottwhat then?The prospect of seeing him again gave Sean a rush of that desperate old need for a father.If Elliott came back, though, hed be the needy one.Sean thought he heard someone speak, somewhere behind the church.He held still and listened.Nothing but a cardinals shrill, repetitive whistle now, but he wanted to make sure.He leaned around the corner of the church and surveyed the expanse of kudzu covered trees and bushes.It went on for acres, interrupted by an occasional stand of pines that hadnt yet been conquered.He walked farther into the wild vines.He was dwarfed by the green towers that had once been living trees.They made a weird, alien landscape where a man could hide, silent as a deer, and wait.Downtown, bluegrass blared from the PA system, reminding him of Elliott and his upstart, part time, ragtag band.Every year, theyd earned standing ovations.They were that good.Bile rose in Seans throat.His mentor, a talented man whod crafted fine musical instruments and furniture, was living in the wild like an animal.Hed abandoned his family and friends, his business, his responsibilities.All because his wife might have cheated on him?Laura had paid the price too, although she wasnt to blame.Shed been paying the price for years.Fury boiled up inside Sean.Hed had enough of Elliotts game.Elliott!he yelled.Where are you?The dense vegetation swallowed his voice.It produced no movement, no sign of life, no sound except a jay squawking as it flew over.No planes marred the blue, blue sky overhead.Nothing came between him and the eyes of God, who knew exactly where Elliott Gantt was.No, Sean would never have a father on earth, and if there was a Father in heaven, he wasnt talking.He opened his mouth to scream at the Almighty but heard familiar laughter and whirled around.Dale stood there, raising a clenched fist like a prizefighter whod just won the big one.Beside him, in the grip of his other hand, stood a stoop shouldered man with terror stricken eyes in a gaunt, bearded face.Elliott Gantt, in the flesh.Emaciated flesh.His filthy gray shirt reeked of wood smoke and sweat.He rolled the tattered hem of it between bony, contorted fingers that must have been pounded with a sledgehammer, the bones left to set any which way.His bedraggled beard ruffled in the wind, gray as his shirt but streaked with white.I nabbed him out by the old cabin, Dale said, grinning.I was takin him to town, but the old geezer jumped right out of the truck, just up the road.I had to slam on the brakes and chase him down.Lauras in trouble, Elliott said in a rusty voice.We have to hurry.Yeah, weve got to find her.Dale winked at Sean.Before its too late.Sean read the fear in Elliotts moist eyes and knew what Dale had done.Lauras fine, Sean said.I dont care what he told you, Elliott, but its a lie.Shes safe.Confusion played across Elliotts features.Shes in danger.With a crippled finger, he pointed across his sunken chest toward Dale.He told me so.Shut up, Dale mouthed silently to Sean.Dale lied, Sean said.He just wanted to lure you out.Lauras fine, Elliott.I talked to her a few minutes ago.Dale smiled, pretending innocence, and tugged Elliotts elbow.Lets go downtown, then.Wouldnt you like to be onstage one more time?Waving to the crowds?So Dale wanted to make a spectacle of Elliott.Even in the opening hours of the festival, thered be more people than hed seen in more than a decade.He would freak out.And hed get a free ride to a psych ward.Theres no need to go into town, Sean said.The old mans breath came in hard, fast rasps.I dont care about the town.Wherewheres Laura?He didnt look like he could harm anybody.He seemed to slide in and out of the present, his eyes clear one moment and foggy with confusion the next, but always glistening with tears.Sean hesitated, remembering that Laura had mentioned Alzheimers.Have you been trying to see her?Yes, but she was so afraid.It made me sad.I want to see her, but I dont want to scare her.He let out a dry sob from deep inside his bony chest.And Imso grubby.Come with me, then.Im grubby too.I need a haircut and a shave.Sean patted his own whiskered mug.Laura will want to clean us up, both of us.She wont run from me?No sir.If she knows its you, she wont run.She just wants to know youre okay.Elliotts lips moved, but he said nothing, like a child trying to work out an adult sized problem.Dale still gripped Elliotts elbow, and Sean took his other arm.Dale let Sean win the tug of war.Plan B, he said.Dont lose im, boy.He moved a few feet away and pulled his phone from his pocket.Hey, Sean said.Who are you calling and why?Its my turn to call the cops.I want this freak hauled in.Elliott hasnt committed a crime.It was a crime all right, what he did.Dale turned and walked toward the church.Come on.Sean steered Elliott away from Dale.Toward home.But theres something you need to know, if you dont know already.About Jess.The faded blue eyes sparkled brighter.I know, son.Shes gone.Its grievous to my heart, as death ought to be.Yes.Im sorry.They moved a few feet closer to home, Elliott moving as lightly as a cat.A weak and wobbly cat.How did you hear about Jess?Sean asked.Ruby Pearl kept me up on the news, especially these last weeks since I came down from the mountains.Ruby Pearl?Whos that?Elliott held a mangled fist upright, like a flag bearer holding an imaginary flagpole.Old girl with the fee faddle.Thethe rain thing.Granny Colfax?With an umbrella?Parasol?Thats it.Ruby Pearl Colfax.Shes a good one for keepin secrets.Brings me news and necessities out to the home place when I stay there.He smiled.Ruby Pearl was a killdeer to me.She lured folks away from my nest, a time or two.So, Granny Colfax had toted more than news and necessities.Shed carried a big secret, all this time.No wonder she walked the country roads, rain or shine.Elliott sighed.Now, son, you want to know why I left my family.I can see you do.Its hard to explain.You dont have to explain a thing.I was afraid.Id killed before, so I knew I could kill again.Sad for the old soldier, Sean shook his head.It was part of your job.Elliott coughed, his shoulders shaking.But I wanted Gary dead.Gary?Dont you mean When it was over, Jessamyn was carrying Garys baby.Seans mind reeled.Gary?Laura?The timing was all wrong.Are you sure?Im sure.Elliott drew a raspy breath.I didnt know for years.When I found out, well, I entertained murderous thoughts toward him.Like a friend ought not to do.You dont act like youd want to murder anybody.Elliott laughed softly and raised his ruined hands.I did that.Did it to myself.Why?So I wouldnt be able to hold a gun.I couldnt trust myself not to harm a friend orthe woman I loved.Seans skin crawled, first at the thought of Elliott firing at Jess, then at the thought of a man deliberately ruining his own flesh and then suffering alone in the wilderness.It wasnt normal.How could he even bait a fishhook with claws like that?Thered be no fiddle lessons now, that was certain.And I dropped my guns in the lake, Elliott said.Lest I should use them for evil.Then I took myself far away, just to be sure.But when I found out Jess was gone, I knew Laura would come.I had to see her.Im starting to understand, Sean said, looking ahead.One more curtain of kudzu to wade through, and theyd be back on the weedy grass within view of the house.What matters now is youre back, and Im glad.I thank you kindly, son.Sean looked behind them.Still on his cell phone, Dale lurked at the corner of the church building.
