Giles asked hurriedly.Now, what the bleedin ell was it?Stavros?Itll come to me, I know it will.Angie pursed her lips.Her lipstick bled up into her wrinkles in a fine illustration of capillary action.Well, it wasnt Davros, I know that.Sorry, love, it was a long time ago.And she was pissed off her head, Shardonne muttered.I got some pictures, though, Angie said brightly.Whered I put them pictures, Shards?Shardonne sneered and shrugged, her top falling off one shoulder to display a greying bra strap.Angie tottered on high heeled fluffy diamante slippers to a stack of magazines.Sifting through several trees worth of Take a Break and The Sun (the latter all folded to page three, so Giles was treated to a rapid succession of naked breasts of varying size from obviously fake to frankly ridiculous) she eventually unearthed a photo album bound in cracked PVC.Sitting next to Giles on the sofa, she opened it up.Here we are.Thats me She pointed to a rather pretty looking girl in a bikini.And that, love, is your old man.With a sinking feeling, Giles stared at proof positive that this wasnt all some nightmarish mistake.The young man in the picture looked exactly like him.Same curly dark hair, same broad shoulders, same hirsute chest that had been a source of acute embarrassment since Giles was fourteen.I do love a man with a decent chest on him.Angie grinned, and dug Giles in the ribs with that razor sharp elbow of hers.And see?I wasnt bad looking in my day, neither.I think youve hardly changed a bit, Giles said gallantly.Get on with you!Ooh, youre a one!Angie squealed, while Shards made throwing up noises, and Pete grunted Hrrn, hrrn, which Giles took to be his version of laughter.Now, you tell me all about them posh lot what adopted you.Giles sighed, and started to tell her about Mummy and Daddy.This was going to be a long visit.* * * *  Much, much later, having only escaped by promising to come back soon, Giles sat on the steps of his parentshis adoptive parentsconservatory.He had a large glass of single malt whisky in his hand and was staring into the pitch dark garden beyond.Oz sat next to him, chugging down his third bottle of Insanely Bad Elf.Hed been a bit quiet since Giles had got back.I always wondered, you know?Giles said, gesticulating with the Edinburgh crystal in the vague direction of the water feature.What sort of people my parents were.Were they romantic, idealistic?Or hard working, salt of the earth types?And now I know.He paused dramatically.Im the son of a chav.A stiletto wearing, chardonnay swilling, chain smoking, perma tanned chav.And a Greek waiter whose name she cant quite recall.He hung his head in despair.Oz nodded, patting him on the shoulder sympathetically, if a bit unsteadily.Cheer up.It could have been worse.Giles looked up, incredulous.How?Just how, precisely?Oz glared at him.Well, she could have been a raging snob like her son, for starters!Bloody hell, Giles, have you listened to yourself?This is your mother youre talking about!Have some respect!What, Im supposed to respect her for being careless about contraception?
