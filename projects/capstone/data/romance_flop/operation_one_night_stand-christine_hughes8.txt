There would be numerous media outlets attending and I was being trusted as the face of the publisher.No stress or anything.Staring in the mirror, my face freshly washed, I leaned in only to find a long scraggly gray hair protruding from my eyebrow.Mortified, I grabbed the tweezers from the drawer and plucked the rogue old lady hair from my face.Somewhat satisfied but still aghast at the fact that I was getting gray hair, even if it was only in my eyebrows, I pulled my hair into a ponytail and walked to the kitchen to refill my empty coffee mug.Sarah still wasnt home.Shed spent the night at Drews apartment.As a matter of fact, shed spent three nights at his place during the past week.I was happy that shed hit it off with someone so quickly.As a general rule, Sarah was ridiculously picky when it came to guys and usually liked the freedom the single life afforded her.But, according to our conversation the day before, none of us was getting any younger.The thought of turning thirty freaked her out and Drew came along just in time to ease the blow, or at least muddy the view of the big three oh.As for me?I still had a year and a half until I had to meet my next decade, a small victory for being the youngest in my tiny group of three.I didnt have too much time to mull over life changes.I had a date with a personal trainer before I plopped myself in the chair of my hairdresser, who had agreed to do something fun with my continuously out of control curls.It wasnt until three on the afternoon of the party slash dinner slash whatever it was that I found myself back in my apartment.Sarah was emptying grocery bags and dancing to the newest pop station.Bouncing around the kitchen singing about being happy, she was startled to see me standing across the counter with an amused grin on my face.Welcome back.Jesus, you scared me.Imagine how I felt.I havent seen you much over the past week.I wasnt sure if I was seeing a ghost.Ha ha.Funny, Care.Your hair looks great!She reached over and ran her fingers through the front.My hairdresser had trimmed my hair and spent two hours straightening it.Now, instead of falling to my shoulders, my hair reached down to the middle of my back.I had to admit, I loved it.But then again, what curly haired girl doesnt dream of straight hair?I resigned myself to the fact that once I showered, it would kink back up.At least for one night, I could feel like a princess.Sarah returned to emptying the grocery bags.What time are you leaving for that dinner thing?The car is picking me up at six.I told Yolanda to have the driver pick up Brian and Siobhan first, just to give me a bit of extra time to get ready.Speaking of Brian, have you talked to him?Sarah asked over her shoulder as she put a carton of almond milk in the fridge.I crinkled my nose a bit; almond milk was gross.Nope.I hung my coat on the hook.Havent talked to Ryan, either.Michael, of course, has been in constant contact.Isnt he away?Yep.Well, he was.He got in last night, I think.Hopping up on the stool, I grabbed a handful of grapes and popped them in my mouth.Didnt stop him from e mailing, texting, calling.You know, normal weirdo author stuff.I think hes OCD or something.He kept making sure the plans were on schedule.Will you be driving with him, too?No.Hell meet us there.He lives in the city, so I think it makes the most sense.Youll be back late?Not sure.I think so.Ill call you and let you know.You staying here tonight?Yeah.I miss my bed.Drews is nice but I dont get much sleep when Im there.Almost a week of fugglesnucking has worn me out.Fugglesnucking?Yeah, you know.When all the snuggling and fucking are over and youre back to snuggling and thinking of sneaking in another quickie.And then you do it instead of thinking about it.Leave it to Sarah to add another word to the dictionary.Sounds tiring.Sarah smiled.It is.I bet.Wiggling my eyebrows, I hopped off the stool and grabbed the makeup bag Id just purchased and filled.I gotta go rest up before I put on my face.Looking at the clock on the stove, Sarah replied, Yeah.Itll take you three hours to do that.I want to take my time.What if I mess up?You remember the last time I tried to do a smoky eye?Sarah made a face and shivered.Youre right.Better start now.I heard her giggle before turning up the music and I imagined her bouncing along to the newest boy band release.Shaking my head, I closed my bedroom door.Flopping on my unmade bed, I stared at the ceiling and finally took notice of the knots in my belly.I was excited to see Brian, to see him all dressed up.I was nervous about the fact that I was tapped to introduce Michael to the attendees.Reaching down, I shuffled my hand blindly through my purse, looking for the index cards that held the small introduction Yolanda had written for me.Finding them, I brought them to my face and read them over and over until I was sure I had the words memorized.The clock read 3:55 before I decided it was time to start getting ready.Grabbing my makeup bag, I made my way to the bathroom and got to work on my face.Thankfully, the girl at the makeup counter had understood my need for understated.On a regular day, my routine involved little more than pressed powder, mascara, and lip gloss.Of course, that wouldnt do for the event, so I purchased new blush, eye shadow, and lipstick.Considering I couldnt remember the last time I used such things, I was wary of painting my face with the items I already owned.It took three tries and quite a bit of makeup remover before I got my eyes right.Adding in a bit of blush and fluffing my hair a bit, I was pleased with the final results.In my room, I pulled out the body slimmer Yolanda had chosen.Off my body, it looked about five sizes too small.I stared at it lying on my bed while I fastened my strapless bra.The tags were still on the slimmer, and reading the directions, I saw I was supposed to step into it for better results.Not sure what that meant, I figured I might as well do as instructed.I had it pulled halfway up my thighs before yelling to Sarah for help.What are you doing?she asked as she walked into my room.I think its twisted.I think youre right.She laughed at my predicament.Shut up and just help me pull it up.Sarah and I grabbed and tugged for a few minutes, untwisting the thing before we were able to stretch it up to the bottom of my bra.I tried to take a deep breath but only managed to squeak out what little air was left in my lungs.It felt tighter than it had when I bought it.Stupid morning croissants.Jesus.People wear these things?Um, yeah.It smooths you out.Youve really never worn one before?Thats what Yolanda said.And no.Never.I turned side to side to look at myself in the full length mirror.It had to be a man who invented these things.Give it a little bit.Youll forget its on.Can I even eat in this?I splayed my hands across my stomach; I couldnt imagine stretching out the fabric any further.As it was, I thought I would split a seam.Yeah.A few peas and a sip of water.Sarah plopped onto my chair.Wheres the dress?I took it down from the back of my closet door and unzipped it from its plastic encasement.All this trouble for a dress.I smoothed my hands down the silky fabric of the undergarment.I feel like Im stuffed in a fucking sausage casing.Sarah grabbed the tag.For a dress that cost almost as much as your half of the rent!Put it on.She took the dress off the hanger and held it out.I stepped into the dress and slipped my arms in the small holes until it settled off my shoulders.Can you zip me?Sarah zipped the dress and I stood back and admired myself in the mirror.I was shocked to see that I didnt look like the young kid I was sure everyone took me as.I looked professional.Sexy.Wow.Yeah.Wow.Sarah stepped back.You know its going to be twenty degrees out tonight?So?So, your legs are bare.Huh?You need pantyhose.What the fuck.Now I have to do this all again?I dont think I have the strength to peel this slimmer thing off then put it back on.Hold on.Sarah ran out of my room and returned a few minutes later with a slim envelope of cardboard.Whats that?Thigh highs.Get the fuck out of here!I cant wear those!Im not a hooker!God, Care!Relax.No one will know youre wearing them, unless, of course, you want them to know.She pulled them out of the package and handed one to me.Pull them halfway up then Ill help you shift the dress and the slimmer so we can pull them up the rest of the way.Between the two of us, it took only another twenty minutes to fit the black thigh high stockings under the dress and slimmer.That was fun.No it wasnt.If your friends dont help you put on your pantyhose, you dont need them in your life, right?Ha!I guess.Thank you.I riffled through my closet looking for the box my shoes came in before remembering they were under my bed.What time is it?Five till six.Can you get the red clutch from the top shelf for me and fill it with my stuff?I shoved on my shoes, which lifted me a good four inches higher than normal, and walked to the hall closet to retrieve my red coat, black leather gloves, and black and white checked scarf.How do I look?Perfect.Here, put on some lipstick.I swept the color on my lips before placing the tube in the clutch Sarah handed me.I had just finished blotting when the doorbell rang.Sarah buzzed Brian up and I took one last look in the mirror.She opened the door and, I swear, time stood still.Brian was dressed in a black suit, gray shirt, and red tie.His wavy hair was slicked back but still looked as though I could run my fingers through it.The stubble on his face was trimmed but not gone.His eyes were hidden by aviator shades.You look, just wow, Caroline.His smile told me I definitely had his attention.Thank you.So do you.I cocked my head to the side.Whats with the sunglasses?Oh.A sheepish look was plastered across his face before he ducked his head and took them off.When he looked at me again, I gasped.What happened?I rushed across the space and investigated the yellowish bruise encircling his left eye.Well, Ryan and I kind of got into a fight.He punched me.What?I was mortified.What the hell could they possibly have fought over?Why?Dont worry about it.It isnt important.You ready?He offered me his arm and slipped his sunglasses back on.I looked back at Sarah, who had her teacher face on and mouthed, What the fuck?She shook her head as we walked out the door.Twenty TwoBrian opened the rear door of the black sedan and I slid in next to his sister, Siobhan.Brian sat up front with the driver.Love your coat!Siobhan looked like a kid in a candy store with unlimited funds.So, Yolanda e mailed me and said I could have ten minutes with Michael.Do you think that will be enough time?I think so.Let me see your questions.Siobhan handed over her notebook.You cant ask him this.I pointed to her question about the rumors of his playboy image.I pulled a pen from her bag that sat between us and crossed the question out.Thats all anyone wants to know!Hes one of the most eligible bachelors in the city.My editor will be pissed if I dont get some dirt.Pouting was not a good look for Siobhan.It made her look even younger than her twenty six years.And really?Michael was considered one of the citys most eligible bachelors?I didnt see it.Look, ask him the other questions and Ill see what I can do about getting you some dirt.Just dont go about it that way.Yolanda will have both our heads.The rest of the drive was spent in silence as Siobhan reworded her approach, Brian made quiet small talk with the driver, and I alternated between reviewing my note cards and looking out the window.Tiny snowflakes twinkled in the overhead lights.I smoothed out my hair and sighed.At least it would be straight for a little while.I secretly thanked Sarah for the thigh highs.She was right.It was cold outside and even if the thin nylon material gave only minimal comfort against the chilly air, it was better than nothing.The car slid in front of the restaurant.Brian opened my door to help me out as the driver held Siobhans hand as she clumsily stepped out of the car.Shoot!I heard her say as she crouched down in the street.The driver crouched next to her to gather the items that had fallen from her purse.Brian stepped to her side of the car to help out.Caroline.You look beautiful.Michael approached under the flash of a few cameras and grabbed my hands, kissing me on either cheek.Lets go in, shall we?My friends I trailed off as he steered me toward the entrance with his hand dangerously low on my back.They can meet us inside.I looked back as Brian helped his sister to the curb.The height of her heels made my feet hurt and I wondered how on earth shed stay upright for the remainder of the evening.Shoving my gloves into the pockets of my coat, I allowed Michael to slip it off and hand it, and my scarf, to the girl at the coat check closet.Wow, Caroline.You look amazing.Michael looked at me hungrily and slid his hands up and down my arms.Clean shaven and dressed impeccably in a suit that matched the color of my dress perfectly, his big brown eyes shone.It wasnt the cold air that rushed in through the open door that was giving me goose bumps.I had to remind my libido to take the night off.It wouldnt do to give Michael the slightest hint of how his presence affected me.Plus, it wouldnt do to give him the satisfaction.Id become good at tamping it down and regarding him as a nonsexual being.Brian, on the other hand, was an entirely different story.Brian and Siobhan walked in.Our eyes met briefly before I watched Brians gaze drop to my feet and slowly take me in.For a moment, I felt like I was the only woman in the room.I wasnt sure if it was the body slimmer, but I suddenly felt as if I were going to burst out of my skin.There wasnt a wall in the world that would ever erase the tension I felt when Brian was in the room.There was no way to look at him without imagining his hands all over my body.Shall we go in?Michaels hand dropped to my lower back as he whispered in my ear.I could feel my face flush and knew Brian could see it.Not what I wanted.I stepped away from Michaels touch and said, Sure.I have someone here that you need to meet.Yolanda cleared her to interview you.Michael sighed.You do know how I hate interviews.I do know, but I think, and Yolanda agrees, that it would be good for your image.Just a few minutes, a few questions, and youll be done.It would be good press.But howhe tucked a strand of hair behind my earam I supposed to maintain an air of mystery if I answer questions about myself?Ducking my head, I replied, Youll still be mysterious.Fine.Youre going to owe me.Big time.Fine.Whatever.Here she is.Brian and Siobhan walked over.Brian looked Michael up and down as Michael regarded Brian as nothing to be interested in.Siobhan, this is Michael Mortimer.Hes agreed to the interview.Nice to meet you, Mr.Mortimer.Siobhan held out her dainty hand.Michael suddenly became very interested in the interview.Please call me Michael.Siobhan, was it?He took her hand and brought it to his lips.Siobhan blushed and giggled.I rolled my eyes.Okay, so you two talk.Brian and I will go get a drink.Ill find you in ten minutes.I grabbed Brians coat and pulled him away.I wasnt sure if my eyeballs would fall out before his.At least, surely, one of us would lose them with all the rolling.At the bar, I ordered an amaretto and ginger for myself and a gin and tonic for Brian.Who the hell was that?Brian looked across the room at his sister and Michael.Siobhan was laughing loudly with her hand on Michaels chest.Michael had his hand on top of hers and was caressing it with his thumb.That, my friendI hopped up on the bar seat and swiveled around to check out the crowdis Michael Mortimer, best selling author of three novels with a fourth in the works.The fourth, soon to be a major motion picture, is the novel Yolanda is working on.Shes using this one to teach me.I looked down, following Brians gaze.I swear to God, Id never felt so sexy crossing my legs.He seems, uh, likeI smiled as I took a drink.Brian couldnt decide where to lay his eyeson my legs or on his sister.Like a, uhDouche bag?Yeah.Our eyes finally met once again.He is but hes harmless.He thinks hes Gods gift.I noticed hes very hands on.Very touchy feely.I usually can keep my distance and he can usually read my signal.Tonight, hes liking the freedom.I didnt like it.Brian took a deep drink.I got that.Just so were clear.Crystal.So, you wanna tell me why you have a black eye?Nope.His smile was brilliant but the message it gave off was clear.Leave it alone.I looked through the crowd and saw a few people who looked familiar.Michael and Siobhan, however, were nowhere to be seen.Wheres my sister?Brian placed his glass on the bar top and stepped forward.They probably went to the back room for the interview.Its a little noisy in here and they were probably being interrupted.Yeah, I guess so.Brian leaned into the bar, brushing up against me as he did, and flagged down the bartender.Do you need another?I could only nod in agreement because his hand was slowly sliding up and down my thigh.Suddenly I felt as though my head would pop off.I began to sweat.Are you all right?Brian grabbed my elbow as I began to slump off the chair.Youre white as a ghost.Cant.Breathe.I fanned myself with a napkin and plucked an ice cube from my drink and began to rub it all over my neck.Lets get you some air.The blast of cold air hit me like a ton of bricks as the droplets of sweat froze to my skin.I shivered and Brian took off his coat and wrapped it around my shoulders.Come on, lets walk.He and I walked halfway down the block but I still felt like I was being squeezed by a boa constrictor.Oh fuckety fuck.I think its the body slimmer.The fuckety what?The thing that goes under my dress to make me look skinny.But you are skinny.I dont have time to explain.I need to get out of this thing now.I tugged at my dress and looked around.Lets go back in and find you a restroom so you can take it off.I cant take it off by myself.I need help.What?Its too tight.You want me to help you take off your underwear?The smirk that crossed his lips made my stomach flip.Not my underwear.The thing thats over myOh, never mind.Fuck.Just come help me.Youre the boss.Brian chuckled as I trotted back to the restaurant.Looking around to make sure the coast was clear, I pulled Brian into the single bathroom with me and handed him back his coat.He hung it up on the door hook and clapped his hands together.So what do I need to do?Unzip me.Yes, maam.No, really, I need to get this fucking thing off me.You really have a dirty mouth.What?Oh, right.Sorry.I wasnt complaining.He unzipped my dress and slipped it off my shoulders.It fell to the ground.I stepped out of my dress and handed it to Brian and he hung it up over his coat.I stood in front of him wearing a sausage casing, thigh highs, and heels.I should have felt sexy but it was hard when it felt like my skin was about to peel off.Caroline, meet humiliation.I think you know each other.I rolled the slimmer down to my hips and breathed a sigh of relief as Brian watched in obvious amusement.Oh, great mother of shit.I can finally breathe.I took large, deep breaths.Brian pointed at me.So thats the thing that you were talking about.Yes.I huffed as if Id just run a mile.I need help getting it over my hips.This thing is supposed to make you look skinnier?Yeah.Stupid, right?Well yeah, especially when your waist is as big as my thigh.Brian stood in front of me as I brought my legs together.He tried to roll the material over my hips as I wiggled from side to side.Both of us tugged at the stretchy material.It snapped back and pinched my skin.Fuck me!Ouch!I didnt think we were there in our relationship yet.I mean I barely know you.Brian smirked but I was confused.What?You said fuck me.I was just statingSeriously?You make jokes now when I am obviously in terrible danger of being suffocated by an undergarment?Turn around.He spun me so my back was to him.My skin tingled as I felt his palms on my waist.He hooked his thumbs under the fold of the slimmer, stretched it out, and slid it down, effectively coming cheek to cheek with my ass.I watched in the mirror as my face turned cherry red.I held on to the sink as I stepped out of the garment and turned back to face him.He held up the material.This is what you were wearing?It had shrunk back to its original five times too small size.Kinky.I snatched it from him.Give me that.I looked around, trying to figure out where to put it since my clutch was entirely too small.He took it back from me and threw it in the garbage can.For a few beats we stood in the small bathroom staring at each other.I had never been so aware of my nakedness.I like those.He reached over and snapped the top of my thigh highs.Can I, um, have my dress?I dont think you need it.Brian!If you say so.I was just trying to help.He pulled the dress off the hook, knelt down in front of me, and motioned for me to step into it.Sliding the dress slowly up, his hands guided the material and caressed my skin.Tugging it up over my hips, his hands slid around to my rear and his fingers teased the top of my panties.I reached back for the sink as my legs threatened to give out.I tucked my arms into the dress and closed my eyes as I slowly turned around and pulled my hair to the side so he could zip up the back.He turned me back around; our bodies were centimeters apart.I watched as his tongue slid out of his mouth and he licked his lips.Did I tell you how good you look tonight?His voice was huskier than usual.He smelled like summer and it warmed me.I, well, I think so.My mouth suddenly felt as dry as the Sahara.Think so, huh?You look fucking unbelievable tonight.He bridged the small gap between us and rested his lips gently on mine.I breathed out as he reached around and cupped my ass in his hands.Caroline.I could feel his warm breath on my neck.I had no idea when I met you that Id end up thinking about you every day.I think about you all the time.I tucked my hands around his waist and pulled him in.He lifted me so I was sitting on top of the sink.My dress rode up to the top of my thighs as I wrapped my legs around him.Can I ask you something?Sure.It wasnt the least awkward position to be in when someone wants to ask a question.About RyanI dont want Ryan.I know the words tumbled out of my mouth but at that moment, I realized I truly meant them.No?I want you.And I did.His kiss was hesitant at first.Sweet and soft.Before long, my bottom lip was between his teeth and his hands were cupping my breasts.He moved down and placed kisses and small bites on my chest along the top of my dress.His body rubbed against me and I could feel my panties dampen.The kisses became furious with want and he pulled me off the sink and held me against the wall.I was on the tips of my toes when he hiked up my dress and hooked his thumbs under the elastic of my thong.Crouching down, he trailed kisses down my leg as he slowly pulled my panties off.Just when I thought I would orgasm from the anticipation he slowly stood in front of me, breathing heavily, smoothed my dress back down, and tucked my panties in his pocket.He kissed me quickly on the lips and said, If youre good, youll get these back later.He opened the door and walked out of the bathroom, leaving me to catch my breath and wonder what the fuck had just happened.I banged my head against the wall and closed my eyes in an attempt to regain my equilibrium.I smoothed down the front of my dress and counted backward from ten before stepping over to the mirror to reapply my lipstick and fluff my hair.The tingling between my legs graduated to full on throbbing and I was left to wonder if I was experiencing the lady version of blue balls.Sighing, I pulled down a few paper towels to mop up the moisture that had collected between my legs.I opened the door and slipped out of the bathroom.I saw Michael and Siobhan walking down the hall from the back of the restaurant.Finished with the interview?Siobhan turned scarlet and mumbled something about getting a drink before ducking away.Youre looking positively flushed.Michael twisted a lock of my hair through his fingers.Your zippers down.I frowned at him.Oh, well, yes.He made a show of slowly pulling it up.What did you do?I didnt do anything.Siobhan and I just chatted a bit.Shes very good with her mouth.At that moment I knew what I felt whenever he was near me and it wasnt sexual.It was slimy.I wasnt getting knots in my stomach because I was sexually attracted to him.I was getting knots in my stomach because I was trying not to vomit.Jesus Christ, Michael!What the hell is wrong with you?You know, common sense is so fucking rare it should be classified as a super power.Shaking my head, I pulled him toward the back room.What?He honestly did not think hed done anything wrong.Look.We have to sit down now and have dinner.Then I have to introduce you and you are supposed to read an excerpt from the novel.Do you think you can keep your dick in your pants long enough to get all that done?Well, that depends on what youre doing now.He winked and pulled me closer.Gross!Michael, get off me!I slapped him.The flash from a camera temporarily blinded me.Seriously?I yelled at the photographer.This is not over, Michael.Keep it in your fucking pants and keep your hands off Siobhan and me.Or I swearSwear what, Care?His voice sounded dangerous as he challenged me.I pulled my arm from his grip.Ill tell Yolanda.Well.Michael straightened his posture and fixed his tie.Theres no need to be hasty.Lets get on with this.He walked away, leaving me to question my sanity.What was that about?Brian approached with a drink in his hand.Nothing I cant handle.Thank you.I took the drink and downed it.I swear, I am not getting paid enough to babysit this guy.Brian and I walked over to the table and took our seats.I wanted to get there before Siobhan, but she was already seated next to Michael, something I didnt want.Considering I didnt want to make a scene, I took my place next to her.At least Id be able to keep her in check.Throughout dinner, Siobhan and Michael giggled and whispered to each other, much to the dismay, it seemed, of Brian.He was clearly not happy with the company his sister was interested in keeping.I attempted numerous times to get her attention, or at least Michaels, but to no avail.I was in the middle of torturing my cloth napkin when Brian put his hand on my knee.He looked at me and smiled.Its okay.What are they going to do in the middle of the restaurant?Youre right.I know youre right.When it was time for me to introduce Michael, Brian reached under the table, squeezed my hand, and said, Youve got this.The rest of the evening went well.I successfully managed not to stutter in front of a room full of people and Michael read eloquentlyI almost forgot what a dickhead he was.At the end of the night, I made my rounds with Michael, taking care to thank everyone for spending the evening at the event.I even managed to get the photographer to delete the photo he took of me slapping Michael.When I finally made my way to the front of the restaurant, I saw Brian standing there, holding my coat.Ready?Yes.I looked around.Wheres Siobhan?She made plans to stay with her friend Melissa.She already got a cab.So its just us?I slipped my arms in.Yep.That okay?Of course its okay.I need my panties back anyway.I pulled on my gloves as Brian wrapped my scarf around my neck.Not sure if youve been a good girl.No?Nope.Will I at least get them back before I get home?Home tomorrow.Tonight my place.Wouldnt that be awkward?Nope.Ryans out of town for the week.Los Angeles, I think.Standing on the sidewalk, we waited for the car to pull up.When it did, Brian pulled me close and kissed me hard and fast.I was left to catch my breath and my balance as he opened the door for me to get in.Reaching in the car, he pulled my seat belt across my chest and across my lap, securing me in.I watched as he walked around the car and slid in the other side, buckled his seat belt, and smiled.There was a deliberate space between us and after that kiss it was unwanted.I unbuckled my seat belt to slide closer but he just said, Nope, not yet, and refastened my belt.Twenty ThreeThe ride back to Brians place was quiet as I found myself, once again, looking out the window at the passing cars and falling snow.I thought about where everything was all going.Id finally gotten the true one night stand out of my system when the girls and I were in Jamaica.Sure it was fun, but it wasnt what I was looking for.As fun as Ryan was, he wasnt what I was looking for, either.I had enough friends and I didnt need another one that clouded my judgment.Id realized Brian was what I wanted.Thinking back, I was pretty sure I knew that the night I first met him.He was always the one I thought about over the past month, he was the one who tied my stomach in knots.Brian, I was sure, was the one who would give me what I wanted.Needed.What I needed.I was pulled out of my reverie when Brian opened the car door.I hadnt realized wed arrived at his apartment.It was barely midnight and the bar was still alive.I took his hand and his fingers closed around mine.The way they fit together made me smile.I lifted our hands up and brought them to my mouth and kissed his knuckles.His smile lit up his face.I need to talk to Patrick, make sure everything is okay before we go up.Five minutes?Right.I remembered his brother, Patrick, was watching the bar.No problem.You want me to wait in the bar for you?You dont have to.He handed me his keys.You can wait upstairs for me if you want.Sure.I can do that.With his hand still in mine, he steered me to the entrance.Before you go up, I want to introduce you to my brother.Stepping up to the bar, he flagged down a tall good looking guy with wavy red hair and a swath of freckles across his nose and cheeks.Pat!Patrick leaned over the bar and gave Brian a hug as I stood back.My hand felt odd since he let it go.Then Brian turned and reached for me.This is Caroline.Ah.The ever elusive Caroline.I was beginning to think my brother made you up.He held out his hand and I took it.Its very nice to meet you.Its lovely to meet you, too.I turned to Brian.Meet you upstairs.Ill be up in a few minutes.His smile was brilliant.I started to turn away but Brian hooked my arm and spun me to him, then planted a heavy kiss on my lips.I heard him chuckle as I walked away, attempting to keep my balance.Once upstairs, I kicked my shoes off at the door and draped my coat over the sofa.Checking out his overstuffed bookshelf, I pulled out a copy of Ray Bradburys Fahrenheit 451, my all time favorite book.I was standing against the window, flipping through it, when Brian walked through the door.Both of us froze as our eyes met.His tie was loosened and the top two buttons of his shirt were undone.With his hands in his pockets, he blew out a long breath.Hi.He undid his tie the rest of the way and tugged it from around his neck.Hi.I slid the book back on the shelf.You want a drink?He walked over to the liquor cabinet.Sure.I watched as he took ice cubes from the freezer and dropped them in two tumblers before taking a ginger ale from the fridge.I stood rooted to the floor, fascinated as I watched him make the drinks.My stomach flip flopped when I saw him take off his jacket and roll up his sleeves and turn on the stereo.I wanted to go to him but my legs had decided to stop working.Time slowed down as he turned to me, walked to the window, and handed me my drink.My fingers tingled when they met his.Are you cold?He asked, noticing the goose bumps that littered my arms.No.My voice was breathier than usual and I cleared my throat.Music filled the space.And filled me.He took my hand, interlocked his fingers between mine, and led me to the couch.Sitting on either side of the vast piece of furniture, I felt like I had in the car.There was too much space between us, but for some reason, my brain turned into that of a girl on the verge of her first time, and I could figure out no way to express myself.I hated that feeling.I was a woman, successful and somewhat experienced.Why couldnt I take charge?He leaned his head back on the sofa and closed his eyes.I wasnt sure what to say; I wasnt sure if I should make a move.My brain was blank of everything except him.Every dirty thought, every possible scenario of how the night would play out, raced through my head as I watched him relax.My stomach stirred again and heat began to rise from my toes.Suddenly, it clicked.I didnt need to wait for him to make the first move.I had the ability to take what I wanted.Placing my drink on the end table, I slowly stood and stepped over until I was standing in front of him.Lazily, his eyes opened and he watched as I took the drink from his hand.I took a long sip before placing it on the table.He followed my hands as I hiked up my dress a bit and dropped my knees to the sofa, on either side of him, until I was straddled across his lap.He massaged the tops of my thighs as I ran my fingers down his shirt, unfastening each button slowly.CareBefore he could finish his thought, I placed my lips on his, kissing him softly.The restraint was killing me.Every fiber of my body screamed for me to move faster, kiss harder.But the slow and steady pace felt good in my heart.His tongue explored my mouth as I ran my fingers through his hair.He slipped his hands behind me, cupping my rear and pulling me into him.His hips pushed upward and I could feel him swell against his pants.He unzipped the back of my dress and tucked his hands inside the fabric, against my skin.I gasped from his touch.His lips moved to my neck and I let my head fall back as he shifted on the couch and stood, carrying me to the door.With my back pressed against the door, he continued to kiss and nibble on every bit of my exposed skin.He slowly slid me down so my feet were barely planted on the floor.My dress pooled around my feet.From his pocket, he pulled out my panties and slipped them on me, carefully sliding them up my legs.Throwing my dress to the side he reached over and picked up my shoes.He knelt down and slipped them onto my feet.He quickly kissed me, biting my lower lip before stepping back and picking his drink up from the table and gulping the liquid down.His eyes were hungry and he was breathing heavily.His eyes fell slowly from my head to my feet before they met mine again.I stood, barely able to hold myself up against the door, wearing nothing but my bra, panties, thigh highs, and killer shoes.Back at the restaurant, I had felt a twinge of embarrassment, but in this moment, I felt sexier than I ever had in my life.I knew I looked good and his appreciative look boosted my confidence.Quickly he closed the distance between us and pinned me to the door.His mouth was not gentle.It was as hungry as I was.I shoved his shirt over his shoulders and he shook it off his arms, leaving it to fly across the room.My hands tugged his belt loose and before I could unbutton his pants, his hand cupped the swell between my legs.My gasp was louder than the last and he smiled as I pressed myself tighter against the door.His face inches from mine, he kept his gaze glued to my eyes and I watched as he watched me rise until I was about to fall over the edge.Heat rose from inside me and I opened my mouth to draw in more air but all I could do was moan.His fingers worked their way inside me as his other hand pulled my breast out from the fabric of my bra.As he rolled my nipple between his thumb and forefinger, my nerves sang.Come for me, Caroline.His fingers pushed in deeper as his thumb rubbed my clit.I closed my eyes, anticipating the rush, when I felt his hand gently but firmly press against my neck.Look at me when you come.With one hand working inside me furiously, he pinned me against the door with the other.Eyes locked, I could feel the end.From the pit of my stomach, vibrations racked through me until I yelled out.More.His eyes reflected the pleasure he gave me.And the promise that it was only the beginning.Another loud moan erupted from my throat and his mouth crashed on mine.He lifted me up and I wrapped my legs around him as he carried me to the back of the apartment.We tumbled onto his bed with his body pressed on top of mine.He gently pushed my hair from my face and kissed my nose.You are so beautiful, he whispered, before gently tugging my earlobe between his teeth.I could feel my cheeks flush and I smiled.I feel beautiful with you.You should always feel beautiful.His nose grazed mine.I cant get enough of you, Caroline.Goose bumps covered me.You can have as much as you want.He buried his head in my neck and hugged me tighter.We dont have to do this.We can hold off a bit.Do you want to hold off?No.I just dont want you to think this is all I want from you.He propped himself up on his elbows and looked me in the eye.I, of course, want this, but not just this.Does that make sense?I nodded.It does.It was you from the beginning.I kissed the corner of his mouth.From the second you walked in the bar, Caroline.I knew.His tongue ran along my lower lip.I want this, Brian.I want you.Every touch, every kiss, every breath, made me want him more.Thoughts of excitement, newness, and surprise stung my eyes.He lifted himself up, kneeling between my legs.Slowly, he pulled off my shoes, then each stocking.I lifted my hips as he tucked his fingers into my panties and tugged them off.Leaning over, he reached behind my back, unhooked my bra, slipped it off, and tossed it on the floor.I lay in the middle of his bed with my hair splayed wide and my arms resting above my head as he stood and stepped back, crossing his arms over his chest.I was exposed.On full display.And I loved every second of it.Every inch of you is perfect.He shoved his hands in his pockets.Perfection is perception, I countered.And perception is reality.He pulled off his unbuckled belt and placed it on his dresser.Slide down to the edge of the bed.I sat up, scooted to the edge of his bed, and reached for his pants when he stood in front of me.But he playfully gripped my wrists and guided me back down to the bed.He leaned over me, his hands still gripping my wrists.Tonight is all about you, Caroline.Your being here, being mine, is more than enough for me at the moment.So I want to make you feel good.ButHe placed his finger on my lips.No, no.Believe me.I will feel everything you feel.Let me do this for you.It was as if he knew what I wanted as he began his slow trip down the length of my body.He spent time at my neck, kissing and nibbling just above my collarbone.Mmm.Thats nice.I closed my eyes.His tongue circled one nipple, then the other.He took his time as his tongue moved slowly and deliberately and his teeth barely scraped the hardened nub as he pulled it into his mouth and sucked.He released me with a pop and gently blew on the moist skin.I shivered and pitched forward.Brian.I breathed out his name as I fell back to the mattress.Good girl, he murmured between tiny kisses along my rib cage.Your skin is so smooth.I could feel the clench between my thighs when his fingers dug into my hips and he pressed his teeth into my flesh.Warmth spread from my center and I could feel the swell between my legs.My thighs quivered in anticipation.You have goose bumps.He ran his hands along the tops of my thighs as if he were trying to warm me up.Your fault.Youre driving me crazy.I smiled and turned my head to look at him.He bit his bottom lip before saying, You think this is driving you crazy?His chuckle did me in and I knew I was in for it.Awfully confident.I drew up one leg and pressed it against the other, denying him access.His hands pulled gently and I shook my head.Caroline.Brian.I giggled before I relaxed my legs.He gently spread them as he knelt between them.He teased and gently kissed each inner thigh as my feeble attempt to steady myself crumbled.His lips kissed me everywhere.His breath was warm against me.His fingers explored and his tongue teased.I felt his fingers pinch and open me wide before he plunged his tongue inside me.Between his mouth and his fingers, I was brought to the edge over and over, though he didnt let me fall off completely.I fisted his gray down comforter as I twisted and writhed.Each time it became too much and I began to pull away, he dragged me back in until I was finally able to sit up and lean into him.More.My voice was hoarse.Please, Brian.More.I did all I could to push myself closer against him.Reaching over his back, I hooked my fingers in his belt loops and tugged his body closer.He responded with a growl as he pushed his hands under my legs and lifted them up, flopping me back down on the bed, but not before I raked my nails up his back.He muscled my legs as far apart as he could and continued to suck and lick me until a wave of tremors shook me until I felt dizzy.My entire body vibrated as I yelled, Oh my God, Brian!My thighs squeezed against his face and my toes curled and cramped.I was mid tremor when he grabbed my hand and lifted me to my feet.My legs felt like they were going to give out and I fell back to the bed.
