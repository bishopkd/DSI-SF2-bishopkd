Giless sneer turned abruptly into a grimace of pain.Ow!That hurt!It was bloody well meant to.That poor woman spent nine months carrying you in her womb, then endured hours of agony just so she could push your ungrateful self out into the world!If she could hear you now, I bet shed wish shed never botheredjust gone the easy route and flushed you down the toilet at six weeks gone!Giles shuddered.You dont mean that, do you?Oz waved his glass, and Giles ducked to avoid a nasty contusion.Well, yes.There she was, still in her teens, pregnant and alone.I bet nine girls out of ten would have been down the abortion clinic straight away.And for Gods sake, she welcomed you into her home!Killed the fatted calf, so to speak  Thatd be Darren, Giles muttered.and gave you a mothers blessing.A lot of women would have just slammed the door on you;  You never mentioned she might do that this morning!wouldve been embarrassed to see you standing there on the door step.A reminder of past mistakes and all that.All right, all right.Point taken.Giles looked gloomily at a moth that had landed in his whisky.It flapped pathetically a few times in the amber liquid then seemed to give up the fight.He fished it out and tried to blow on it gently with the vague idea of drying it out, but a slight misjudgement resulted in it flying from his fingers and disappearing in the darkness.Not, unfortunately, of its own volition.Giles raised his glass and drank a solemn toast to its passing.Then he gagged, realising he was drinking something the horrid little insect had very likely peed in.* * * *  After Oz had stomped off to the guest room, Giles spent a restless night.Was he really being classist?Ungrateful?He thought of Angie, and the way shed smiled at the sight of him.Had there been a suspicion of a tear in her over made up eye?Mummy, Giles said next morning, hovering by the Aga as his mother did something complicated with the pressure cooker, am I a snob?Hed made sure Oz was safely occupied with the PS3 and out of earshot.His mother turned, a picture of elegance as always.Hed spent many happy hours, as a child, trying on her wardrobe of frothy chiffon dresses and crisp linen jackets.And the shoes High ones, and low ones.Shoes of every style and hue, some of them custom dyed to match particular outfits.Delicate strappy sandals, and cheeky little peep toed courts Really, it was quite astonishing that itd taken him until he was seventeen to realise he was gay.The fact that his mother had given him tickets for a Kylie Minogue concert for his birthdayand suggested he invite a rather nice young boy who worked at her hairdressers to go along with himshould probably have given him a clue, too.Darling, youre our son and we love you unconditionally, she said, laying a kiss on the top of his head.Giles sighed into her Chanel scented bosom.Thats a yes, isnt it?Im afraid so, Giles.Weve known for some time, but I think your fathers still hoping its just a phase and youll grow out of it.You know, I always wondered why Daddy was so disappointed when it didnt work out between me and Ray from the salon, Giles said sadly.I suppose this is why he doesnt like Hugh?Darling, your father doesnt dislike Hugh, Mummy said, not quite looking him in the eye.He just feels he hasnt been an awfully good influence on you, thats all.Giles struggled to understand.But Hughs from one of the very best families.How can he possibly be a bad influence?Mummy sighed.Hugh is, well a little old fashioned in his attitudes.You know, she said brightly, pulling on the Cath Kidston oven gloves Giles had given her for Christmas, Ive never understood why you and Oz arent a couple.After all, you get on marvellously.Giles gave a nervous laugh.Me?And Oz?You know were just friends.
