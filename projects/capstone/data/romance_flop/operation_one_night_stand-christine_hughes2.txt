Operation One Night Stand needed Steven not to be there.Id just finished my last day of work with him.I was beginning my new life without him.The last thing I needed was him anywhere near me.Yeah.Stevens not here.Yet.The fact that Steven and I had broken up two months ago wasnt lost on me.Id barely escaped becoming a hermit.And yet, two months later, there I was with more confidence in my pinky than Id had during any of the five years wed dated.I was embracing my confidence and refusing to shirk away from my fears.It wasnt easy.I didnt expect it to be.I wondered, briefly, if Betsy the Intern would make an appearance.Of course, she was probably crying her eyes out on Stevens shoulder.But Im not angry.Not anymore.Im not even that sad.As mortified as she was when Steven publicly declared that she didnt matter, I was even more mortified that I would ever date someone who would do something as clich as fucking an intern.I dont have anything against internseveryone has to start somewherebut come on!What can I get you?Realizing I was still half sprawled on my back on top of the bar, I rolled my eyes upward.Bartender Brian looked down at me and smiled.Hi.He really had nice teeth.Hi.I started to get up.No, no.Dont get up on my account.He gently placed his hand on my shoulder, effectively keeping me where I was.So, need something to drink?he asked Melody.I noticed her noticing him.I frowned a bit at the thought of her thoughts infringing upon the perverted scenes that ran through my head but I had to remind myself, yet again, that Brian wasnt the target.Sure.What do you recommend?Melody leaned in and purred the question like she always did.I swear to God that girl was sex in heels.Body shots.Say what?I, again, attempted to sit up and once again, Bartender Brian placed his hand on my shoulder and Melody clapped.Let me demonstrate.I felt like my eyes were going to roll into the back of my head as I watched him pour a shot of tequila.With a shot in one hand and a saltshaker in the other, he leaned down and licked my neck.As he did, my eyes fluttered closed and I moaned.Yes.Moaned.I heard him chuckle quietly.I wanted nothing more than the bar to swallow me.Before I knew it he shook salt onto my neck and leaned back down.Instead of merely licking the salt off, he added lips and teeth and oh my God.I gasped so hard for air I swear I was drowning.Then he placed a lemon wedge on my lips.This shit doesnt happen to me.Ever.I didnt see him take the shot but I heard the shot glass hit the bar top.I held my breath and waited as he raked his fingers through my hair, then bit around the lemon wedge, scraping his teeth on my lips.He mustve bit the lemon because drops of juice and tequila fell onto my mouth.He used his lips and tongue to clean it up.That was fucking hot!Melody clapped her hands.Thanks.I not only serve the drinks, I use them as entertainment.With one hand in front of him and one behind, he bowed.Fucking bowed.I was a lick away from orgasm and hes accepting applause.Fuck.A little help here.I was not able to sit upright.Melody grabbed my hands and pulled me up.I whipped my head around.Bartender Brian was across the way chatting up a group of guys who were with my target, and a fresh drink was sitting in front of me.A few people sitting next to me at the bar clapped as I came to my senses.A loud chorus of cheers had me ducking my head to avoid the attention.What the hell was that?Sarah asked, laughing.What?Look at you making out with the bartender!Looks like someone jumped off the celibate carousel.I did not!I was not making out with the bartender.He was just, he was just I looked at Melody for an answer.Dont look at me.Bartender Boy is hot!I say you focus on him!I grabbed my purse and hopped off the barstool.No.I made a deal and I picked my target.Youll see.Im going to win this bet!Caroline!Turning around, Bartender Brian smiled as he slid another drink my way.Pink Panty Dropper.What!How did he know what color my underwear was?He laughed, pointed to the drink, and said, Pink Panty Dropper from Tall Blond and Dumb.Oh.Okay.Thanks.I was a little unsteady and I didnt think it had anything to do with the drinks.Determined not to let my focus wane, I downed the shot, slammed the glass on the table, and said, Pop My Cherry.Brian reacted just as I thought he would.The look on his face was priceless.Grabbing a hold of my lady balls, I leaned across the bar, took a page from his book, and whispered, Send him a drink.Pop My Cherry.Just as he had, I lingered a beat longer than I needed to, making sure to graze my lips against his cheek.Fuck it, I thought.If I am going to embrace my inner slut, I may as well bear hug her till she cant breathe.Yes, maam.Brian white knuckled his towel as he walked to the back of the bar and began mixing the drink.He snuck a glance at me, smirked, and shook his head.I needed to know my targets name.Bartender Brian!Yeah?He yelled over the noisy chatter of the bar.Find out his name!I already know his name.What is it?Not sure if I should tell you or not.He walked away, drink in hand, down to the other end of the bar.Hows Operation One Night Stand going?Sarah placed her empty glass on the bar and sat on the suddenly vacant stool next to me.Its going.Get his name yet?Brian wont tell me.Who the fuck is Brian?The bartender.Bartender Brian.Why dont you go ask his name yourself?Maybe Brian doesnt want you to know the guys name.Why would he care whose name I know?I took a sip of my cinnamon drink, remembering for a moment how Brian smelled when he drank it.Um.Hello?Sarah rapped her knuckles on my head.For such a pretty girl you are fucking dense.Brians into you.No, hes not.Hes a bartender.Its his job to flirt and whatever.He gets more tips that way.Tips, huh?Ill give you a tip.Ditch Ken doll over there and get nasty with Bartender Brian.He is quite a bit yummier.She licked her lips hungrily and growled, snapping her teeth together.Will you stop it?I smacked her arm.Im telling you.The bartender is the guy for you.Youre just saying that so Ill lose the bet.Ugh.Caroline.Listen to me.I am your friend.Fuck the bet.I am telling you.Bartender Brian is the way to go.You ladies talking about me?I nearly choked on my drink.How much had he heard?Hi.Im Sarah.Carolines roommate.Nice to meet you, Sarah.Brian wiped his hands on the towel tucked into the back of his pants before offering it to her and shaking her hand.What can I get you?He picked up her empty glass, sniffed it, and said, Amaretto and ginger.Hes good.Sarah wiggled her eyebrows at me.I kicked her.Im pretty good at most everything I do.Right, Caroline?His eyes sparkled dangerously.I was beginning to think Sarah was right.I wouldnt know.I havent seen most everything you do.We can fix that, you know.Say the word, he said as he overpoured Sarahs amaretto and splashed it with ginger ale.Can we now?So youre a handyman, too?I chuckled.That is, of course, unless youre still stuck on Tall Blond and Douchey over there.Still weighing my options.Sarah pinched my knee before she hopped down, drink in hand.I hadnt even noticed Id finished mine.When I placed the glass on the bar for a refill, a shot glass topped high with fluffy whipped cream was sitting in front of me.Blow Job.I guess you expect me to swallow?I asked suggestively.Well, that is the recommended ending for such a thing.Laughing, I was reaching for the shot when Brians hand covered mine.Nope.No hands.No hands?I really should have gone out drinking more in college.Ooh!Blow Job shots!Melody and Sarah appeared on either side of me, slapping their hands on the bar.Make it three and make it snappy, barkeep!I locked eyes with my target.He was staring at me like this shot was going to be the one that put the nail in the proverbial coffin.I make this work and I win the bet.He made his way through the crowd until he stood behind me.Sarah and Melody exchanged a look I couldnt interpret.My name is Ryan.He stuck out his hand over my shoulder and I shook it.Caroline, I said as I pointed to myself.Having a good time?Yeah.You?Yeah, sure.What do you say we get out of here?I looked at Sarah and she shook her head.Melody dropped her forehead to the surface of the bar.Brian stood in front of me with his arms crossed and an unreadable look on his face.Three shots were lined up in front of us.Fuck it.What do I do?Melody piped up, Put your hands behind your back like this.I mimicked her demonstration.Lean down, wrap your lips around the glass, and lift.Drink the shot.Swallow.Dont spit, Brian chimed in, his eyes locked on mine.Holding his stare I replied, I never do.Let me hold your hair, Ryan offered as he gathered my curls into a manageable mess.Ready, girls?Sarah asked.Closing my eyes, I leaned down, wrapped my lips around the cool shot glass, and threw my head back.The shot glass was pulled from my mouth before I could think about it and Ryans mouth crashed down on mine.By the time I came up for air, Bartender Brian had moved to the other end of the bar.I wasnt quite sure why I was so disappointed to see him go.Not like we were a thing.Regardless, a lump formed in my throat.I grabbed Sarahs drink and downed it like it was my last.Easy.You okay?Sarah whispered.Yeah, fine.Ill be at our place.Youre going to our place?Yeah.Safer there than his, considering I dont know him, right?You know, so many people go through life without having experienced a one night stand.You dont have to do this.Sarah.I havent had sex in two months.Two months!Do you have any idea what that does to a womans vagina?Um, no.But I know what it does for the battery business.Ha.Ha.Really funny.Im at the precipice of becoming an old maid!Look around!All the girls here are young.I am old.Old!Seriously, Caroline.Its not that big a deal.Youre just going through a dry spell.Dry spell?There are days I have to check and make sure my lady parts are still there.Dry spell my ass.Ladies, Im getting fucked tonight.My door will be closed.I will be screaming.Dont come in.Melody spit her drink on the guy standing next to her.Then she yelped.Of all the people in the world, she spit her drink on my ex.Steven.Nice to see you.It really wasnt.Uh, Care?You drunk or something?Not really, why?Actually, I kind of was but he didnt need to know that.He grabbed my arm and pulled me aside.Care, do you know this guy?He thumbed toward Ryan.Im sorry.I lost the memo.When the fuck did that become your business?I still care about you.Right.Thats pretty funny.You really seemed to care when you were fucking Betsy.That was a mistake.I am so sorry.I want to make it up to you.Ha!It wasnt a mistake until I found out!Look, can we talk somewhere else?I was hoping that, you know, since we dont work together anymore that maybeMaybe what?That wed have another go?That wed ever be something again?Fuck off Steven and take your dictating intern with you.Everything okay over here?Brians voice made me jump.I realized I had yelled loud enough to cause a scene and a number of people had stopped their chatter to hear the exchange between Steven and myself.Yeah, were good.Why dont you mind your own business?Steven responded to him with his usual air of snobbery.God, what did I ever see in this guy?Dont talk to him like that!I slapped away his grip on my arm.What, are you fucking this guy, too?Too?Too?You should talk, Steven!You make me sick, you lying fucking bastard.Fuck you.Knock it off, Care.Youre making a scene.I saw him scan the bar.Get the hell away from me.I wear heels bigger than your dick.Take it somewhere else.No one here cares.Thats enough!I think its time for you to leave.Brian miraculously appeared between Steven and me; Ryan stood next to him.I thought I might faint when he reached behind him and placed his hand on my stomach, effectively shielding me from Stevens jerk face rhetoric.Fine.Steven threw his hands up in the air.This isnt over, Caroline.You cant throw away five years on a pretty boy and a fucking bartender.He spat the word like it was beneath him.No, but you can throw it away on Betsy the Intern.Just go away.I dont want to see you ever again.Steven walked out with his entourage of assholes.I felt both defeated and liberated.Im a bit put out that Im not the pretty boy, said Brian.You okay?Im good.Thank you.No problem.Youre awfully feisty.Thats just the new me.You ready?Ryan put his hand around my shoulder.Huh?I was a bit disoriented by the previous display and more than slightly embarrassed.Oh, right.Sure.I grabbed my coat and handed it to Ryan.He obviously didnt know what to do with it, so I took it back and shrugged on my coat.You sure about this?Sarah looked at me with equal parts go get em and what the fuck are you thinking?Yeah.Its just sex, right?Not like Im looking for a relationship with Tall Blond and Dumb, right?I just dont want you to regret anything in the morning.Then Ill sleep till noon.I smiled.If youre sure.Call me if you need anything.Will do.I leaned onto the bar.Brian!Yo!He turned around, delivering a drink to a thirsty patron before making eye contact.His gaze was so penetrating, it felt like a thousand gymnasts were using my stomach as a trampoline.Thanks again for that.Sorry you had to get involved.Thats what I do.He rapped his knuckles on the bar.Take care of yourself, Caroline.Whats with the tone?Effectively dismissed, I watched as he pulled another beer and took an order from an overly flirtatious girl who looked like she was barely out of high school.Not my problem.Lets go, Ryan.FourI nearly dragged Ryan out of the bar.Snowflakes fell steadily, sticking to the already slick sidewalk.I realized my shoes, no matter how cute, were not going to make it through the night.Hey.Ryan stopped.I left my coat in the bar.Oh, right.Um, Ill wait.You sure?No.I want you to freeze to death in the snow.He looked at me and cocked his head.Im kidding.Go get it.He laughed and pulled me in tight.His thumb slid across my cheek and he lifted it up to show me a single drop of water.A snowflake fell from your eyelash to your cheek.I think its good luck.Do I blow on it?I kept eye contact as I leaned in.I closed my eyes and blew the tiny drop off his thumb.I raised my head, smiled, and said, Hurry.He grabbed my face and kissed me hard and I felt it in my panties.Be right back.He pulled away and jogged the half block back to the bar.I found a bare wall between apartment entrances and leaned against it, hoping the overhang would shield me from the weather a little bit.My feet were wet, my toes were cold, and I hadnt thought to bring gloves or a hat.I rolled my eyes at the thought.Sure, I was cold, but Hello, Caroline!Hopefully you are about the have amazing sex with a superhot guy.Smiling, I closed my eyes and imagined his lips on mine again.Only when I imagined the lips they werent Ryans.They belonged to Bartender Brian.And the thought of Brians lips on mine soaked my panties as much as the real kiss did with Ryan.Ryan.Brian.Someone was going to have to change his name.Rifling through my purse, I found my lipstick.My fingers were cold and when I pulled the cap off, it slipped from my grip and fell to the sidewalk.Fuck.I squatted down and looked around me; it couldnt have gotten far.I was sure it was hiding by my feet in the slushy snow.I didnt spend too much time looking.My fingers were bright red from feeling around the cold snow and my toes felt like frostbite was going to take over.Lose something?I looked up to see Ryan standing in front of me wearing weather appropriate outerwear.Yeah.I dropped the top to my lipstick.I held up the tube to show him.Its freezing out and youre worried about lipstick?He stepped closer.I dont think you need it.No?My back was pressed against the brick wall.No.But if you need them warmed up He slid his hand under my ear and threaded his fingers through my hair.And then he kissed me.His lips melted into mine and I moaned softly.Our mouths parted slightly and he gently pulled my bottom lip into his mouth.He sank his teeth in for a moment before pulling away.He rubbed his nose along mine.Warm?Fuck.The word tumbled out of my mouth and I slapped my hand against it.I meant, I mumbled through my hand, yes.He chuckled before offering to carry me home on his back.Hop on, he said as he squatted down in front of me.What?He looked at me over his shoulder.Your shoes are soaked, your lips are blue.There isnt a taxi in sight.You said you lived close, now hop on.I hiked my purse up on my shoulder, wrapped my arms around his neck, and hopped up as his arms hooked around my legs.So, where are we going?Huh?I was momentarily distracted by his stubbled jawline.Where do you live?Oh, right.Next building.I pointed and he headed for the stoop.I fumbled for my keys and dropped them, like I had the lid to my lipstick.We both knelt down at the same time and bonked heads.Ouch.I rubbed my head.Sorry.He rubbed his.Time stopped for a moment as we stared at each other.He held my keys and my hand reached up to his face.He leaned in and kissed me slowly as we stood.He stepped forward and backed me against the door as he fumbled with the keys.When he finally opened the door, he stepped over the threshold and lifted me up at the same time.My legs wrapped around his waist and my arms circled his neck.His hands held me up by my ass, his fingers gripping tight.The kiss was deep, rough, and needy.He stepped forward clumsily, knocking my back into the wall, and my fingernails dug into his coat.Stairs, I directed between kisses.Instead of climbing them he sat, with me straddling his lap.One hand splayed wide and pulled me into him while the other snaked under my hair and grabbed a fistful.He gently yanked back and ran his tongue along my exposed throat.He shifted his leg over so it was between my legs.He continued to pull me in and I rocked back and forth.The seam of my jeans hit me in just the right spot.Our kisses were sloppy and consuming; he wrapped both arms around my waist and I ground down onto his leg.Oh my God, I whispered.Dont stop, Caroline.He wrapped his arms tighter.I buried my face in his neck and thrust until I could feel my panties being soaked.I let out a breathy moan.Ryan.Holy shit!An orgasm racked me and I held on to him tight until the wave passed.After a few minutes he chuckled and asked, Are you okay?Im great.Just very, very thankful for the seam of these jeans.I leaned back with his arms still wrapped around me.You wear them well.He leaned in and kissed the corner of my mouth.Thank you.Id like you to take them off.I climbed off his lap and kicked off my shoes.I didnt mean here.He leaned back on the steps and smiled.Oh, so I shouldnt do this?I unbuttoned my jeans and cocked an eyebrow.He ran his finger along his lips.I didnt say that.I laughed, reached down, grabbed my shoes, and ran past him up the stairs.He jumped up and chased me.I had only half a flight on him.I was glad I was only going up to the third floor.I have the keys you know!he yelled up to me.I know!He and I hit the third floor landing at the same time and he followed me to my door.Tease.I need to open the door.The keys are in my pocket.I reached in and found something other than keys and mentally thanked the one night stand gods for gifting me with such a well endowed target.Those arent keys, he whispered when my hand gripped him through the pocket of his jeans.I know.He produced the keys and handed them to me.I turned to unlock the door and I could feel his excitement press up against me as he kissed my neck.It felt like unlocking the door took forever but when I finally did, he stumbled into the apartment behind me before he slammed the door closed and turned the lock.For a few seconds we stared at each other.The sexual tension was palpable, like tiny sparks of electricity flying through the room.One tiny word slipped from his mouth.Fuck.We collided in a tangle of hands and lips and tongues.Our coats dropped in a heap on the floor.The buttons on my shirt were too much for him and he ripped it open instead as I unbuckled his belt and whipped it out of his pants.I tossed it across the room and it hit a lamp, knocking it over to shatter on the floor.I. Did.Not.Care.Ryan, I mumbled before sinking my teeth into his lip.He responded by sliding his hand down the back of my jeans and squeezing my ass.He picked me up again and started down the hallway.Wrong room.My hand shot out to the doorjamb as he tried to enter Sarahs room.Across the hall.He turned around and used his foot to shove my bedroom door open.He dropped me on my bed and leaned down to unbutton my pants.He slid them over my hips hard enough to lift me off the bed.Panties off.He was already dropping his pants to the floor and stepping out of his boxer briefs.I froze.In my whole life Id never seen anything so girthy.Instinctively my hands flew to cover my lady bits.He reached down, pushed my hands aside, and dipped his fingers inside me.You okay?Better than.I placed my hand behind his head and pulled him into a kiss.We both crawled back on the bed until he was able to settle between my legs.I heard a wrapper open, then it was a few seconds before he positioned himself above me.Need took over and I thrust my hips toward him, feeling the tip of him hit me.Ryan pulled my right leg up and grabbed my ass as he pushed deep inside me.I cried out.Id never felt anything so completely.He filled me, stretched me, and I couldnt get enough.More, I demanded and quickened the pace.You want more?He smiled and pulled out before slamming back into me.Brian!I yelled, and he stopped for a minute and his eyes widened.It was a second before I realized Id said the wrong name.I tried to play it off.Oh, Ryan!Fuck me harder!I am pretty sure he caught the flub but he picked up the pace and banged me until I thought I would pass out.The bed rocked and the headboard hit the wall so hard I thought pictures would fall off the wall.God damn Caroline.You feel so fucking good.His voice was gruff and sexy.I shifted position and we rolled.I smacked my head on the nightstand.Ow, fuck!We both stopped our frenzied fuck fest to laugh.Sex injury?He chuckled.It fucking hurts, I said between tears of laughter and pain.Do you need ice?Fuck no, I didnt need ice.I needed sex.Im good.I rolled my hips.You sure?He thrust into me.Instead of answering I kissed him and he leaned back so I was sitting in his lap.He kicked out his legs and held me steady.Once I got my rhythm, he reached around and unhooked my bra.I slipped it off and he tossed it.Caroline.He grunted my name.Caroline.Slow down.Im going to come.Instead of slowing down, I held on and sped up, thrusting and rolling like a porn star.I was owning this motherfucking one night stand.Caroline.His hands grabbed my hips.Caroline.His fingers dug into my skin.Oh fuck!He grabbed me and pulled me in tight as he thrust up.The muscles in his shoulders and arms tightened.I could feel his legs tense under me.Fuck.He dropped his head to my shoulder and shuddered.He let go of me and fell back.I climbed off him and slid off the bed.Where are you going?He reached for me.To get a drink.Water.You want some?You have anything stronger?Yeah.Be right back.I padded to the living room and pulled a bottle of whiskey off the shelf.I grabbed two glasses and a bottle of water from the kitchen before heading back to the bedroom.Ryan was still lying on his back, his dick limp, though he had removed the condom.Truth be told, I was a little put out that the only orgasm I had came from a hundred dollar pair of jeans.Here.I handed him a glass before unscrewing the top of the bottle.I poured him two fingers before swigging straight from the bottle.I winced and coughed and chased the drink with half a bottle of water.You okay?he asked.You keep asking me that.I reached into my drawer and pulled out an oversize T shirt.What are you doing?Getting dressed.Why?Um I waved my arm toward his flaccid penis.Oh this?He sat up and downed the whiskey.This isnt done.This is a break.A break?Holy shit.Steven never took a break.He pumped, dumped, and passed out.I just thoughtThought what?He stood and crossed the room, took the bottle of whiskey from my hand, and took a large gulp.Part of me was jealous because he didnt choke on it.You thought we were done?No.No.No.Did I make you come?I shrugged.It felt good.Thats not what I asked.Did I make you come?No.No.I didnt.I intend to remedy that tonight.I intend to remedy that a few times.My mouth dropped open and my skin tingled.Goose bumps covered me and I could feel myself grow wet at his words.You are going to feel me here.He kissed my mouth.Here.He reached around and grabbed my ass.And here.He dropped to his knees and darted his tongue out, barely flicking my clit.My knees gave out and he caught me before I fell.He handed me the bottle of water and stood.Drink that water, Caroline.Youre going to need it.Ryan chuckled and walked out of the room toward the bathroom.I tilted my head and watched his bare ass until it left my sight.I shivered and chugged the rest of my water, anticipating what he had in store for me the rest of the night.FiveI shifted under the covers, slowly stretching my arms and pointing my toes until I thought theyd detach from my body.The soreness I was feeling lazily brought me back to a night of mind blowing sex.My shoulders still ached from when Ryan pinned me to the wall.My hamstrings screamed and I remembered spending quite a bit of time with my legs up in the air.My hair was a rats nest of tangles covering the lump that had formed from banging my head on the nightstand.Falling off the bed during sex was not as graceful as it looked in the movies.My ass felt like it had been stretched in a torture machine.And to top it off?My bedroom smelled like a brothel.Ahh.The musky smell of sex.Last night was definitely not for the faint of heart and had it not been for the ridiculous confrontation with Steven at the bar, I may not have actually gone through with it.I was no longer a virgin to stranger sex.I opened my eyes, thankful Id had the forethought to turn off the lights and keep the curtains closed.Rolling over, I reached for the glass of water I always kept by the bed.Looking up, I tilted my head slightly.What the hell is that?Attached to my slow moving ceiling fan was my pink bra.At least the hanging bra signified something other than the relationship I had with sweatpants, movie channels, and ice cream since Steven and I broke up.So, howd it go?Sarah startled me out of my reverie as she walked into my room carrying a huge mug of coffee and I pulled my blanket up to cover my boobs.Wouldnt you like to know?I rolled over, picked up my phone, and looked at the time.Five after twelve.Told you I wouldnt regret anything in the morning.That you did.She made herself comfortable on the edge of my bed and handed me a tank top she found on the floor.So, details?I closed my eyes, remembering what there was to remember about Operation One Night Stand.It was, uh, nice.Nice?Theres a broken lamp in the living room and the front door was left open.I thought we had been robbed.Until I found your torn shirt on the floor.She held up the tattered blouse with her index finger.I think theres more to it than nice.I smiled.It was more than nice.It was crazy.I leaned over my bed and picked up what was left of the new pink panties Id bought specifically for the night.Holy shit, Care!When you go all inHe went all in.I wiggled my eyebrows at her and squealed.Nice!I didnt know it could be like that!I had no idea there were so many different ways to bend.Honestly.Thank God for yoga.So you feel good?Yeah.Sore but, I smiled before I pulled my knees up and winced.My hand flew to my crotch.Ouch!I couldnt tell what hurt worse, my vagina or my ass.It didnt matter.I needed the pain to go away.Whats the matter?Sarah jumped up.Oh, fucking gross Care!Sarah leaned down and picked up off the floor what should have been the most embarrassing clue as to what actually went on last night.Seriously?She turned the item over to read the label.Lots OLube?My best friend was holding up a white tube of Lots OLube, complete with a bright green shamrock next to the name.Huh?Instinctively, my sphincter tried to shrink back to its normal size.So thats why my asshole feels like someone lit a match to it.Ha!You little whore!Her laugh echoed in the space.I squeezed my eyes tight in an attempt to control the throbbing.I think I may have overdone it.You think?My vagina hurts.I flopped to the fetal position, my hands cupping my very sore lady parts.Just your vagina?She cocked an eyebrow.No.Not just my vagina.That skin between the vagina and the asshole.I feel like it ripped.Your taint?Do girls have taints?I shook my head.Who cares?I feel like Ive been stretched to max capacity.That big, eh?Ill get you some ice.Be right back.I placed my coffee mug on the nightstand and flopped back onto my bed.Hugging my pillow to my chest, I closed my eyes.Every touch, tug, pull, kiss, and slap of the ass from the night before flooded my brain.My stomach fluttered at the thought of his mouth on me.Eating, tasting, sucking, licking, kissing.He was a sex god.And that made me a sex goddess.At least I felt like one last night.It was perfect, untilHere you go.Sarah tossed an ice pack at me and I not so discreetly wrapped it in the scraps of my tattered shirt and placed it on my crotch.Better?She shoved clothes off my chaise and leaned back.Yeah.Thanks.So, she began, now youve gotten that out of your system and you arent so anxious and all Caroline about it, tell me, was it worth it?Absolutely.It was amazing.And his dick was huge.I mean, like, cucumber big.And his abs, oh my God!His abs!Physically, a perfect specimen.But?Sarah knew me better than anyone.But I think I messed up.I dont think Ill be seeing him again.Messed up?How?I thought it was a one nighter?Who cares if you dont see him again?WellFess up, sister.What happened?Did you bite when you should have sucked?God no!Nothing like that!I sucked like a champ, if I do say so myself.Its just that, well I took a breath.Toward the end of all the crazy, uhFucking.Leave it to Sarah to have the right word.Yeah, that.I sorta, kinda called him by the wrong name.You didnt!Her eyes popped out of her head, reminiscent of old school cartoons.Oh, honey!Well, you were with Steve a long time.God knows why, but it happens.It wasnt Stevens name.Sarah sat up straight.Well, then whose name did you use?Brians.Brian who?Brian from last night.Bartender Brian, Brian?I nodded and took a long swallow of coffee.What?How?For once cool, calm, collected, say it like it is Sarah was at a loss for words.Why?I dont know!I mean, Ryan was on top of me, pumping like a machine, mind you, and all of a sudden my brain went to Brian.I mean, for a minute I didnt think he noticed.Brian sounds a lot like Ryan, right?Right, she said, obviously not following my excuse.Well, I said it, he looked at me funny, we finishedWait, you called out a different guys name and he still finished?Well, yeah.What else was he going to do?No sense in walking away from a sexcapade like that, right?Sure, sure.I regularly allow someone to get off after they call me Lucy or some shit.Go ahead.It wasnt like that.I was totally in the moment.Totally into it.You owe me fifty bucks by the way.I pointed at her.I just had one little slip.Ryan whispered in my ear something like I want you to have a screaming orgasm or something and poof!Brian was in my head.Wait, hold on.What the fuck does Brian have to do with a screaming orgasm?Other than the fact that hes outrageously hot.And sexy.Thats the name of the drink he whispered in my ear.I am pretty sure thats when he started flirting with me.Not for nothing, he wasnt the only one flirting.Just saying.I wasnt flirting!I was focused on the target!On Ryan!Yeah.So focused you called out Brians name.Shut up!I threw a pillow at her and she ducked.Go take a shower.We have to meet Mel for spin class then lunch.Spin class?My body went rigid.Yep.No pain no gain.Sarah let out a huge laugh, the kind that calls you an idiot without voicing the words out loud.
