You can close your eyes to the things you dont want to see, but you cant close your heart to the things you dont want to feel.Johnny Depp           Have you ever done something so incredibly stupid, the guilt and regret hang over you like the darkest, heaviest cloud?Blurring your judgment, consuming your soul until its the only thing you can see, hear, or think about?I have.Ive done a lot of things I regret, that fill me with guilt.But the absolute worst is the thing I did yesterday.I left the girl I love alone, naked in her bed.Like some sort of macho asshole who uses a girl for sex and then leaves her thats me.Ive turned into that guy.But Im not really that guy.I love the girl I left alone naked in her bed.I just dont deserve her.And I know it.Sometimes you have to stand alone, just to make sure you still can.Unknown  Fable Two months.I havent seen or heard from him in two freaking months.I mean, who does that to a person?Who spends the most intense week of his life with another human being and shares his most intimate thoughts, his craziest, darkest secrets, has sex with a person and were talking amazing, earth shattering sex leaves her a note that says I love you, and then bails?Ill tell you who.Drew Im going to kick him in the balls next time I see him Callahan.Ive moved on.Well, I tell myself that.But time doesnt stop just because my heart does, so I take care of my responsibilities.Ive stretched the three thousand dollars I earned for my one week of pretending to be the jerkwads girlfriend pretty well.I still have some money left in my savings account.I bought my brother, Owen, some cool Christmas gifts.I got my mom something for Christmas, too.She didnt buy either of us anything.Not one thing.Owen made me a shallow bowl he created in his ceramics class at school.He was so proud to give it to me.A little embarrassed, too, especially when I gushed over it.The kid wrapped it in bright Christmas paper and everything.I was blown away that he took the time to actually create something for me.I keep that bowl on my dresser and leave my earrings in it.At least someone gives a crap about me, you know?He didnt give Mom anything.Which shallow witch that I am pleased me to no end.January is supposedly a time of healing.New year, new goals, resolutions, whatever you want to call them, when a person should be hopeful with all that unchartered territory spread out before her.I tried my best to be positive when the new year came, but I cried.That clock struck twelve and I was all by myself, tears running down my face as I watched the ball drop on TV.Pitiful, lonely girl sobbing into her sweatshirt, missing the boy she loves.Most of the month is gone, and thats fine.But the realization hit me last night.Instead of dreading every single day that comes my way, I need to savor it.I need to figure out what Im going to do with my life and then actually do it.Id leave if I could, but I cant ditch Owen.Without me, I have no idea what would happen to him and I cant risk it.So I stay.I vow to make the best of this life I have.Im tired of living in misery.Im tired of feeling sorry for myself.Im tired of wanting to shake my mom and make her see that she has children she should give two shits about.Oh, and that she also needs to find a job.Sleeping all day and partying all night with Larry the Loser isnt the way to deal.And Im tired of mourning the loss of a beautiful, fucked up man who haunts my thoughts everywhere I go.Yeah, Im most sick of that.Pushing all mopey thoughts out of my head, I go to the booth where a customers waiting for me to take his order.He came in a few minutes ago, a blur of a tall man who moved quickly, dressed too nicely for a Thursday mid afternoon jaunt to La Salles.The bar is hopping at night, full of college kids drinking themselves into oblivion.But during the day?Mostly bum losers who have nowhere else to go and the occasional person coming in for lunch.The burgers are decent, so theyre a draw.What can I get you?I ask once I stop in front of the table, my head bent as I dig out my order pad.Your attention, maybe?His question spoken in a velvety deep voice makes me glance up from my notepad.Into the bluest eyes Ive ever seen.Bluer than Drews, if thats possible.Um, sorry.I offer him a tentative smile.He instantly makes me nervous.He is waaaay too good looking.Like beyond gorgeous, with dark blond hair that falls over his forehead and classic bone structure.Strong jaw, sharp cheekbones, straight nose he couldve walked right off a billboard.Are you ready to order?He smiles, revealing even white teeth, and I clamp my lips shut to prevent them from falling open.I didnt know men could be this attractive.I mean, Drew is gorgeousI can admit that even though Im furious at him.But this guyhe puts all other men to shame.His face is too damn perfect.Ill take a Pale Ale.He flicks his chin at the tattered menu lying on the table in front of him.Anything from the appetizer menu you can recommend?He must be joking.Beyond the burgers, I wouldnt recommend any food La Salles serves to this ideal male specimen.Heaven forbid it might taint him.What are you in the mood for?I ask, my voice weak.Lifting a brow, he picks up the menu and glances it over, his gaze meeting mine.Nachos?I shake my head.The beef is rarely cooked all the way.More like it comes out with a pink tinge.So gross.Potato skins?He winces.I wince back.So nineties, dont you think?How about the buffalo wings?If you want to set your mouth on permanent fire.Listen.I glance around, making sure no one as in my boss is nearby.If you want something to eat, I suggest the caf down the street.They have great sandwiches.He laughs and shakes his head.The rich, vibrant sound washes over me, warming my skin, followed quickly by a huge dose of wariness.I dont react like this to guys.The only other one who could earn this sort of reaction from me is Drew.And hes not around so why am I still so hung up on him?Maybe because youre still in love with him, like some sort of idiot?I shove the nagging little voice that pops up at the most inopportune times into the back of my brain.I like your honesty, the man says, his cool blue gaze raking over me.Ill just take the beer, then.Smart decision.I nod.Ill be right back.I head toward the back and slip behind the bar, grabbing a bottle of Pale Ale, glancing up to catch the guy staring at me.And he doesnt look away, either, which makes me feel uncomfortable.Hes not watching me like a pervert; hes just very observant.Its unnerving.A trickle of anger flickers through me.Do I wear an invisible sign around my neck?One that says Hey, Im Easy?Because Im not.Yeah, I made a few mistakes, looking for attention in the wrong places, but its not like I dress with my tits or ass hanging out.I dont put any sort of purposeful swing to my hips, nor do I thrust my chest out the way I see plenty of girls do.So why does every guy I encounter seem to blatantly check me out like Im a piece of meat?Deciding Ive had enough of his crap, I stride toward his table and set the beer in front of him with a loud clunk.Im about to walk away without saying a words crew the tip when he asks, So whats your name?I glance over my shoulder.Whats it matter to you?Oh, Im such a bitch!I could really piss this guy off and get myself fired.I dont know whats wrong with me.Im almost as bad as my mom.She sabotaged her job with her drinking and awful attitude.At least I only have the bad attitude.If I could kick my own ass, I would be doing so right now.He smiles and shrugs, as if my smart ass remark doesnt faze him.Im curious.Turning fully, I face him, studying him as intently as he studies me.The long fingers of his right hand are wrapped around the neck of the beer bottle, his other arm resting on the scarred and scratched table.His entire manner is relaxed, easy, and my defenses slowly lower.Its Fable, I admit, bracing for the reaction.Ive heard endless jokes and rude remarks about my name since I can remember.But he doesnt give me a hard time.His expression remains neutral.Nice to meet you, Fable.Im Colin.I nod, not knowing what else to say.He both puts me at ease and shakes me up, which leaves me confused.And he definitely doesnt fit in at this bar.Hes dressed too nice and has an air of authority about him that borders on entitlement, as if hes above it alland he probably is.He reeks of class and money.But hes not acting like an ass and he should, Ive been so rude to him.He brings the beer bottle to his lips, taking a drink, and I watch unabashedly.Hes handsome.Hes arrogant.And hes trouble.I dont want anything to do with him.So, Fable, he says once hes downed half his beer.Can I ask you a question?Shuffling my feet, I glance around the bar.No ones paying us any attention.I could probably stand here and talk to Colin the mysterious customer for fifteen minutes and no one would protest.Sure.Why is a woman like you working in a shit bar like this?Why is a guy like you ordering a beer in a shit bar like this?I retort, momentarily insulted.But then I realize hes complimenting me.And he referred to me as a woman.No one ever does that.I dont do that.He tips his beer at me, as if offering a toast.Touch.Would you be surprised if I said I came in here looking for you?Surprised?More like creeped out.I dont even know you.How could you be looking for me?I should rephrase that.I came here hoping I would find someone I could steal away.At my raised eyebrows, he laughs.I own a new restaurant in town.The District.Have you heard of it?I had.Some fancy place that caters to the rich college kids, the ones with an endless supply of money they can use to eat, drink, and party.So not my scene.Yeah.Have you been there?I slowly shake my head.No.Leaning back against the seat, he studies me, his lids heavy as he does a slow perusal ofme.Now hes totally checking me out and I can feel my cheeks burn with embarrassment.The guy is sort of a jackass.Ive always had a slight thing for jackasses.Come with me to the restaurant tonight.Ill show you around.His mouth curves into not quite a smile and Im tempted.But Ive also sworn off men, so I know this is a bad idea.Thanks, but Im not interested.Im not trying to ask you out on a date, Fable, he says, his voice low, his eyes glowing.I take a step back, glancing around.I need to get away from this guy.Fast.But then his words stop me in my tracks.Im trying to offer you a job.Drew Lets talk about Fable.I tense up but nod.I try my best to appear neutral, like our new topic of discussion doesnt bother me.What do you want to know?My shrink watches me, her careful gaze steady.It still bothers you to hear her name.It doesnt, I lie.I try my best to appear nonchalant, but my insides are churning.I both dread and savor hearing Fables name.I want to see her.I need to see her.Yet I cant make myself go to her.And shes clearly given up on me.I deserve her giving up.I gave up on her first, didnt I?More like you gave up on yourself.You dont have to lie to me, Drew.Its okay if its still difficult.Dr.Sheila Harris pauses, tapping her index finger against her chin.Have you considered trying to see her?I shake my head.I consider it every day, every minute of my life, but my considerations are useless.She hates me.You dont know that.I know Id hate me for what I did if I were her.I shut down and shut her out, like I always do.She begged me again and again not to do it.Promised that shed be there for me no matter what.Yet I left her.With only a stupid note that took me way too long to write, filled with a secret message that my smart, beautiful girl figured out right away.But shes not my girl.I cant lay claim to her.I ignored her.And now Ive lost her.So why did you shut her out?Youve never told me, you know.My psychologist loves to ask the tough questions, but thats her job.I still hate answering them.Its the only way I know how to cope, I admit.The truth slaps me in the face on a daily basis.I always run.Its so much easier.I sought Dr.Harris out myself.No one else pushed me to do it.After we came back from Carmel, after I ditched Fable and left her that bullshit note, I withdrew into myself worse than ever.I fucked up my game play.I fucked up my grades.Winter break came and I ran away.I literally ran away to some crazy cabin in the middle of the woods I rented from some nice old couple in Lake Tahoe.My plan?Hibernate like a bear.Turn off my phone, hole up by myself, and figure my shit out.I didnt anticipate how hard it would be, though, being alone with my thoughts.My memories, both the good and the bad, haunted me.I thought of the bombshell my stepmom, Adele, dropped on me.I thought about my dad and how much the truth if it really is the truth would affect him.I thought about my little sister, Vanessa, and how she died.How she might not be my little sister after all More than anything, I thought of Fable.How mad shed been when I showed up on her doorstep, yet she let me in anyway.The way I touched her, how she touched me, the way she always seemed to break down my barriers and see the real me.I let her in.I wanted to let her in.And then I left her.With a note that was rendered pointless because she tried her damnedest to rescue me and I wouldnt let her.She sent me exactly two texts.The second one surprised me, because I figured she was stubborn and thought shed give up after I didnt answer the first one.How could I answer it, though?She said all the right things.And I wouldve said all the wrong things.So its better to say nothing at all.She also left me one voice mail.I still have it.Sometimes, when Im feeling really fucked up, I play it.Listen to her soft, tearful voice, those unbelievable words she says to me.By the time the message is finished, my heart literally hurts.Its torture listening to it, yet I cant make myself delete that message, either.Just knowing its there, that for one last minute she actually cared, is better than deleting those words and her voice and pretending she doesnt exist.Im hoping to help you with that.Your coping mechanisms, Dr.Harris says, drawing me out of my thoughts.I know how much she means to you, Fable.And Im hoping that eventually, youll go to her and tell her youre sorry.What if Im not sorry?I toss the words out, but theyre meaningless.Im so sorry I cant begin to explain how much of a screw up I am.Then thats another issue well have to deal with, she says gently.It goes on like this for another fifteen minutes and then I finally make my escape, walking out into the cold, clear winter afternoon.The sun is warm on my skin despite the temperature and I start down the sidewalk, heading for where I parked my truck.Dr.Harriss office is downtown, in a nondescript building, and I hope like hell I dont see anyone I know.The college campus is only a few blocks away and students hang out at the little stores, cafs, and coffee shops that line the street.Its not like I have many friends, but hell.Everyone likes to think they know me.No one really does.With the exception of one person.Hey, Callahan, wait up!Pausing, I glance over my shoulder to see one of my teammates running toward me, a big grin on his goofy face.Jace Hendrix is a pain in the ass but generally a good guy.Hes never done me wrong, not that any of them ever really have.Hey.I offer him a wave and shove my hands into my jacket pockets, waiting until he stops just in front of me.Long time, no see, Jace says.You sort of disappeared after that last failure of a game.I wince.That last failure of a game had been all my fault.I was feeling sort of fucked up over that, I confess.Hell, I cant believe I just admitted to my failures, but Jace doesnt seem bothered.Yeah, you and everyone else, man.Listen, what are you doing this weekend?The way Jace brushes off my statement hell, the way he agrees with it blows me away.Whats going on?Its Logans birthday.Were doing it up right at the new restaurant that just opened a few blocks over.Have you heard of it?Jace looks excited, hes literally bouncing on his feet, and I wonder what the hell is up.Vaguely.I shrug.Like I care.The last thing I want is to be social.But then Dr.Harriss words ring through my head.How she wants me to reach out.And act like a real person.Partys going to be there.Got a private room and everything.I havent been there yet, but I hear all the waitresses are gorgeous, the drinks are great and loaded with alcohol, and Logans parents arranged for a private room.Rumor has it strippers mightve been hired out for this momentous event.Logans turning twenty one, so we want to get him all sorts of fucked up.Jace waggles his eyebrows.Sounds great, I lie.It sounds like torture.But I need to go.At the very least, make a quick appearance and then leave.I can report back to my shrink what I did.She can give me a gold star for making an effort.Youll go?Jace looks shocked, and I know why.I rarely do anything with the guys and especially the last few months, since Ive been like a ghost.Ill be there.I nod, unsure how Im going to work up the energy to make an appearance, but Ive got to do this.Yeah?Awesome!I cant wait to tell the guys.Weve missed you.Havent seen you for a while, and we all know those last few games were tough on you.They were tough on all of us.Jaces expression is solemn, and for a minute I wonder if hes playing my ass.But then I realize hes sincere.Funny how I took full responsibility for those losses when I bet every single one of these guys on my team probably did the same thing.Tell the guys I cant wait to see them.The words fall easily from my lips because theyre the truth.I need to stop wallowing in my own misery.I need to stop worrying about my past, worrying about my dad and my bitch of a stepmom and the little girl who died because I was too busy fighting with her mom and telling her to keep her goddamn hands to herself.Thats one of the biggest regrets I have, that I never fully explained to Fable what happened that day.I know she assumes I was off screwing around with Adele.I would think the same.But that was the day I told Adele never again.Whatever she was going to try, I wasnt interested.It was over.That was the day I became liberated.And also the day I became a prisoner of my own guilt.Forever.See ya around, Drew.Jace waves and turns, whistling as he walks away from me.I remain rooted to the spot, watching him leave until hes a speck of nothing in the distance, wishing like crazy I could be that carefree.That my biggest concerns were my grades, what girl I could get my hands on next, and how excited I was for the big party coming up in a few days.Maybe, just maybe, I could lose myself in the mundane for a bit.Pretend that nothing else matters but friends and school and parties.Doc says I cant move forward until I face the past.But what the fuck does she know?Shes all broken inside but no one will ever notice.Unknown  Fable So.Owen slurps on the giant thirty two ounce soda I bought him at the gas station, where we stopped to fill up my moms crap car on the way home.Can I eat for free at this joint youre working at?I shake my head.Its too classy.Kids arent really welcome.The understatement of the year.The restaurant is definitely not kid friendly.In fact, Im thinking its not really Fable friendly either, but Im willing to give it a chance.Colin claims I can make a ton of money in tips, though Im not sure if I believe him.My thoughts drift to Colin.He owns the restaurant because his rich daddy gave it to him to play with.That much I gleaned from him when he first brought me there.Hes nice.Hes attractive.Hes charming.Beyond chatting with him like hes my boss and Im his employee, Im avoiding him as much as possible.I took him up on his job offer, though it sounds almost too good to be true.Funny thing is, I havent quite given notice at La Salles yet.Holding on to that job until I know for sure the new job is going to work out is the only way to keep the money consistently flowing in.And as always, my inflow of money is the most important thing.Our mom isnt doing anything to ensure thats happening.Owen puffs up his chest, his expression indignant.Are you kidding me?Im not a kid.Im fucking fourteen!I slap his arm and he yelps.Language, I warn because, oh my God, he needs to watch that mouth of his.And since when did the legal adult age get bumped back four years?In his dreams.Seriously, Fabes, you cant even sneak me in?Owen shakes his head, his irritation clear.I hear the chicks who hang out there are bangin.I dont need to hear my little brother talking about bangin chicks and whatever else.Bad enough I found the baggy of weed in his jeans pocket when I did laundry a few days ago.I showed it to my mom and she shrugged, then demanded I hand the bag over.She proceeded to open it and took a deep sniff, proclaiming the weed high quality stuff.I know she took it with her over to Larrys house later and they probably got high as hell.I still cant believe it.How did I become so normal and stable when my mom is such a child?You had no choice.Wasnt that the damn truth?Listen, the dinners they serve are like fifty bucks a plate.Its for couples and stuff.And theres a bar.After ten, the place is completely shut down to those under twenty one, I explain.Its truly the most beautiful, elegant restaurant Ive ever seen, let alone worked at.Its organized and efficient; everything and everyone has a place.The staff isnt very friendly, though.More like snobby.Im sure they sneer at me behind my back, the white trash townie whos come to work among their elitist ranks.Whatever.All I care about is the tips.And the fact that Colin believes in me.Its been a long time since someone believed in me.I thought Drew did, but the longer hes absent from my life, the more it proves to me that was all fake.We just got a little too caught up in the fantasy.You cant even bring me any leftovers, huh?Owens question snaps me out of my thoughts and I glance at him, see the smirk on his face.Hes getting more and more good looking as time passes.I have no idea if he has a girlfriend or not, but I really hope he puts that sort of thing off for a least a little while longer.Relationships are nothing but trouble.Thats so gross.I roll my eyes.I used to bring him home burgers from La Salles.Which goes to show I completely spoiled him.Well, Mom sure as hell isnt going to feed me.Sorry, he blurts when he catches my evil eye over his profanity.And I feel like a jerk with how much I hang out at Wades house.His mom has to be getting sick of me.Guilt swamps me.I need this job.I need both of my jobs, and that means I cant be there for Owen.Making him dinners, keeping on top of his homework, forcing him to clean that dump of a room.The apartment has three bedrooms, a rarity but in demand in a college town, and the rent is getting more expensive.Considering my mom is never here and its usually just Owen and me, Im considering looking for another apartment.For just the two of us.This little tidbit will piss my mom off when I tell her.It doesnt matter that she spends the majority of her time with Larry.It doesnt matter that shes hardly ever here and doesnt have a job and cant afford the rent.Shell still be angry and take it personally, like Owen and I are forcing her out.I kind of am.I dont want her with us anymore.Shes not a good influence.Owens uncomfortable around her and so am I.  Im done.But for whatever reason, Im scared to confront her.I dont want to deal with a bunch of unnecessary drama.And thats what my mom is.Complete and total drama.My cell beeps, indicating I have a text, and I check it, see that its from my new boss.Unease slips down my spine as I read the message.What are you doing?I type in the good employee response.Getting ready for work.Hey, its the truth.Im in the neighborhood.Let me pick you up and take you there.I stare at his message for too long, ignoring Owen as he starts griping about what hes going to have to fix himself for dinner.What the hell could Colin want?Why would he be in my shit hole of a neighborhood?It makes no sense.Unless he purposely came looking for me I dont have to be at work for almost an hour, I reply.Ill pay you for the extra time.Come on.Sighing, I type in my answer: Give me five minutes.I gotta go, I tell Owen as I head for my bedroom.I havent changed into my work uniform, if you can call it that.All the waitresses have to wear the most outrageous dresses Ive ever seen.There are at least four different dresses and theyre sexy as all get out, with our boobs hanging out, or they fit us skintight.I get the sex appeal thing.We dont look slutty or anything, but if I bend over wrong, Im giving everyone a flash of my ass.Boy short undies are the name of the game for those dresses.Im grabbing my dress off the hanger when I catch Owen lurking in my doorway.Whats up?I ask him.He shrugs.What do you think of me getting a tattoo?My head spins for a moment.Oh my God, where does he come up with this stuff?First, youre only fourteen, so legally you cant get one.Second, youre only fourteen.What could you possibly want to have tattooed forever on your body?I dunno.He shrugs again.I thought it might be cool.I mean you just got one, so why cant I?Maybe because Im an adult and youre not?A few weeks before Christmas, when I still believed Drew and I had a chance, I got one.The stupidest tattoo you could ever imagine.I thought by doing it, by having a piece of him, no matter how small, permanently etched into my skin, I could somehow call him back to me.Didnt work.And now Im stuck with it.Thank God its small.I could probably have it filled in if I wanted to.Right now, I dont want to.So you put some guys initials on your body and its cool, but I cant get an artistic tat of a dragon on my back or whatever?So unfair.He shakes his head, his dirty blond hair getting in his eyes, and I want to smack him.And I also want to draw him into my arms and ask where did the sweet, simple kid of not even a year ago go?Because he sure as hell isnt around here anymore.Its different.I turn away from him and yank the dress off the hanger, clutching it in my hand.I need to change, so you need to go.Whos the guy, anyway?You never did tell me.Hes no one.The words are heavy as they fall from my lips.He was definitely someone.He was my everything for the briefest, most intense moment of my life.Hes not no one.He broke your heart.Venom fills Owens voice.I ever find out who he is, Ill kick his ass.I smile because I cant help it.His defense of me is awesome.Were a team, Owen and I.  Were all each others got.I slip outside of my apartment because I so dont want Colin knocking on my door and meeting Owen.Or worse, seeing the inside of our dingy apartment.Wherever Colin lives, I bet its amazing.If his house is half as gorgeous as his restaurant, then it has to be amazing.The second I step off the stairs, hes there in a sleek black Mercedes, the engine purring, the car so new it doesnt have plates yet.I take a step back when he opens the door and climbs out of the car, a blond god with a devastating smile and twinkling blue eyes.He rounds the car, opening the passenger side door for me with a flourish.Your carriage awaits.I hesitate.Is this a mistake, climbing into his car with him?Im not afraid of Colin, yet I am afraid of the situation I might be putting myself in.Hes a flirt, but I notice he flirts with pretty much everyone who works for him and the customers.He never crosses a line, though; hes always polite and knows when to step back if need be.But am I giving him mixed signals by allowing him to pick me up for work?He just happens to be near my apartment so he can swing by and get me?I dont believe it.Not for a second.Did you come here specifically to pick me up?I ask him the minute he climbs back into the car and slams the door.He turns to look at me, our faces awfully close.The car is nice but small and the setting is rather intimate.He smells like expensive cologne and leather, and I wonder for a quick minute if I could actually feel something for this guy.I realize just as quickly that I cant.My heart is still tied up in knots over someone else.Someone unreal.Youre pretty straightforward, arent you?Colin asks, his eyes gleaming in the dim interior.Its better than doling out a bunch of lies, right?I arch a brow.Laughing, he shakes his head as he puts the car into gear.Right.I really was in the neighborhood, Fable.And I remembered you lived around here, so thats why I texted you.I know you dont always have access to a car.Ive worked at his restaurant for three shifts and he already knows all this information about me.Is that a sign of a good boss or a creeper?I had my moms car today.He pulls out of the parking lot and onto the road, his hand draped casually over the steering wheel, his other arm resting on the center console.Theres an easiness to him.No, make that effortlessness.He makes everything appear as if he could get whatever he wants out of life and he deserves every bit of it, too.I envy him that.Its a confidence I could never hope for.Want me to take you back so you can drive it?Theres amusement lacing his deep voice.He must think Im a joke.No.I sigh.This is stupid.What are we doing?I wont have a ride home, though.Ill give you a ride.I dont bother answering him.I remain quiet, picking at my cuticles as he drives, both of us silent.My hands are dry, my cuticles bad, and I think of the other girls I work with who have perfect manicures and pedicures.I look like the still slightly ragged Cinderella whos finally been pulled out of the basement and set to work among the glittering, beautiful princesses.I might shine, but rub me a little bit and the tarnish comes through.I feelless than when Im at my new job.And I dont like that.Nasty habit, Colin says, breaking the thickening silence.You should go get your nails done.Okay, that irritates the crap out of me.His assumptions are rude.I cant afford it.Ill pay for it.Hell, no, I practically snarl.His offer irritates me more.Colin ignores me.And while youre at it, you should go see a hairstylist.Ill pay for that, too.Theres too much bleach in your hair and it looks damaged.The nerve!This guy is such an asshole.Why did I agree to work for him again?Oh yeah, the money.Greediness is going to get the best of me, I just know it.Its led to two really stupid decisions already.Who are you?The fashion police?No, but Im your boss, and at The District we have certain criteria that we need to maintain.So why did you hire me?You knew what you were getting.I saw your potential, he said softly.Do you, Fable?Do you see it?I couldnt answer him.Because the truth wasnt what he wanted to hear.No.Drew Im in class, though I dont want to be.I took a lighter load after my supreme screw up of the fall semester.Why risk temptation to fail or drop classes again?Ill have to make it up over the summer break by taking a few extra courses, but I dont care.Where else would I go?Not home, thats for damn sure.At least while Im on campus, I feel somewhat normal.I can forget about my dad and Adele and what she told me.I havent spoken to her since the one time I called her and made her tell me everything.Ive barely talked to my dad either.He knows somethings wrong with me but doesnt push.I know somethings wrong with him, too, and I dont push either.Whats the point?Do I really want to find out whats wrong?No.I move through the day like a robot, checking in and checking out.The longer Im alone, the more in my head I get.Remembering that I promised Jace I would go to Logans birthday party this Saturday fills me with a sort of panic.Yet I have to do this.Dr.Harris said I need to make like a real person again, and shes right.But it still scares the shit out of me.Im in my communications class, which is huge, and theres this girl who I sit close to every day.Shes petite, her hair is long and blond, and she reminds me so much of Fable, its almost painful.But Im a glutton for punishment.I like sitting by her.Pretending shes someone else, holding my breath when she turns her head in my direction, always ready to be surprised when I find out Fable really is sitting next to me.Dealing with the disappointment when the truth is revealed.She isnt who I want her to be.No one ever will be.The professor is droning on, but Im not listening.I take out a sheet of paper and start writing.A letter I will never give a certain someone.But I need to pour my feelings out for her or Im going to explode.Once my pen meets the paper, the words just flow, and I have no control over them.Maybe it was a mistake leaving you.And I dont know how to make it right.Regret fills me every single day.So much of it builds up I Hate myself for Missing you.Hurting you.And I want you to know I Long for you Love you Others may come and go in our lives but We belong together  I stare at my stupid little poem that the girl I love will never read.I draw little squiggly lines around it.A cursive F, just like I was taught to write in elementary school.The first initial of her name.Fable.A story.A myth.A fairy tale.Shes my story.I want to live and breathe and die for her, and she has no idea how much she consumes my thoughts.To the point I think of nothing else.Id rather sit in class and write her love poems with secret messages in them than pay attention to whats really going on in my life.What a fucking mess I am.For a girl As pretty as she deserves the Best.No more Lies.She is my Everything.But Im not brave enough to tell her.I stare at this new bit I wrote for her and disgust fills me.Im not good enough for her.I cant even tell Fable how I really feel about her to her face.Are you a writer?I glance up to find my pseudo Fable smiling at me, and I frown.Her face is all wrong.She has brown eyes.And shes not as pretty, though shes definitely attractive.I dont know how I thought she looked like Fable.What did you say?I ask.She nods toward the piece of paper filled with my scribbling.Youre not paying attention to the lecture.Are you writing a poem?It looks like one.Sliding my hand over the paper to hide the words from her seeking eyes, I study her face, willing her to look more like Fable.But it doesnt happen.This girl is nothing like her.And I hate her for it.Im taking notes.She smiles.Dont worry.I wont tell if youre not.But I am, I insist defensively because these words are for no one else.Theyre for me and a girl who will never see them.No need to freak out, she whispers.Her gaze narrows, as if she can see into me, through me, and Im tempted to run.Or get so defensive.I say nothing.How can I defend myself against that when she speaks the truth?Hey, arent you Drew Callahan?She cocks her head, her expression full of sudden interest.Mister Big Shot Quarterback?Her voice is full of sarcasm.I let down the entire school at the end of the season in one spectacular failure after another.I fell apart and everyone knows it.I can see the contempt in her gaze, feel it radiating from her body, and I know she thinks Im a joke.Grabbing my backpack at my feet, I shove the piece of paper into it, along with my book.I get out of my chair and haul the strap over my shoulder.He doesnt exist anymore, I mutter to her before I make my escape.Right in the middle of class.But I dont give a shit.I just keep on going.Until Im outside and breathing in the sharp cold air, the sun shining on me, people bumping past me as I push through the crowd.I hear someone call my name but I ignore it.All sorts of people seem to know me, but I dont know them.Thats my bullshit story, no matter how much I dont want it to be.I feel my phone vibrating in my jeans pocket and I grab it, see that its my dad.Normally Id let it go straight to voice mail, but for whatever masochistic reason Im in the mood to talk to him.So I answer.Drew.He sounds surprised.Whats up?My voice is deceptively casual.I shouldve been an actor.Im so good at faking my life its unbelievable.I was hoping I could come and see you.He clears his throat, and I can feel how uncomfortable he is even through the phone.There are somethings I need to talk to you about.My gut clenches and I feel like Im going to throw up.He sounds serious.Scary serious.Like what?Well, Id rather talk about it when I see you, butI may as well tell you now.He takes a deep breath and so do I.  Adele and I are getting a divorce.I feel like Ive been smacked upside the head and little birds are tweeting in a circle above me, straight out of a cartoon.Glancing around, I catch sight of a bench and I sit heavily on the edge of it, my backpack knocking against me, making me wince.What?Why?Id rather come there and tell you.Are you free this weekend?Sure.I remember Logans party.Well, I have something to do Saturday night, but I can cancel it.I dont want to interfere with your plans.My dad usually doesnt give a shit about my plans, so his protesting is unnerving.Hes not himself.Is he upset that hes getting a divorce?Does he view this as a good thing or a bad thing?Of course, I automatically blame Adele for everything.You wont be interfering, Dad.Trust me.Its just a stupid party.Dr.Harris is going to be pissed at me, but I dont care.I need to be here for my dad.Especially if hes finally going to end it with Adele.I shouldnt be happy.I should feel sorry for him.But this is the right move.Shes a sick bitch and I want her poison out of my life.Out of my dads life, too.Plus and this is completely selfish on my partI dont want our secret revealed.I dont even know if her secret is the truth.And thats what scares me the most.Whats real, whats not?Im not sure anymore.How about Ill come there Friday, stay the night with you, and go home Saturday?That way you can do what you need to do Saturday night, Dad suggests.You can stay the entire weekend if you want.I want him to.I miss him.We used to be close.Before I turned fifteen and my stepmom decided I looked far more interesting than my dad ever did.Youve grown up so much, Andrew.Youre so handsome, so big and strong Closing my eyes, I shove her flirtatious voice firmly out of my brain.Lets play it by ear, my dad says.Thats all I can ask for, so I agree.And when we hang up, I feel a little lighter.My heads not as cloudy and for once, Im hopeful.I clutch that feeling close to me for the rest of the day.If there ever comes a day when we cant be together, keep me in your heart, Ill stay there forever.Winnie the Pooh  Drew My dad shows up Friday around noon and we go to lunch, at one of the popular cafs downtown thats full of college students and people on their lunch break from the nearby businesses.Its small and busy, and the tables are tiny and round.Our knees bump against each other because were both tall, and it feels incredibly awkward.Im not saying much beyond small talk, because hes the one with the major news.Scratch that.I have major news, but Im never going to drop that particular bomb on him now.It might scar him for life.Ruin our relationship forever.Im not taking that chance.After the waitress brings us our lunch, he finally says something important.I filed divorce papers yesterday.Adele will be served sometime next week.I lift my head to meet his gaze and find him studying me pointedly.As if hes got everything all figured out.For a moment, Im afraid he does.But then he digs his fork into the salad he ordered along with his sandwich and eats.
