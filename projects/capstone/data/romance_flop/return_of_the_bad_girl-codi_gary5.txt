First of all, you build crotch rockets, Chase said, ignoring the bird Gabe flipped him.And second of all, you made a mistake, but you did your time.You paid for your mistake Yeah, I paid five years, while Honey continues to pay for my stupidity, Gabe said.Chase said nothing for a moment; then, finally, You did something when you werent thinking straight.You were a hot tempered idiot, but youre making up for it by taking care of your sister.You fought for her and have made sure she gets the best treatment, while putting your life on hold.Chase took a breath before adding, At some point, you got to forgive yourself.Otherwise, youre just going to end up bitter and alone, flogging yourself every night for the past.Gabe coughed, trying to cover the emotion choking him up.Chase almost sounded like he forgave him.I dont need to flog myself.I can find someone to do that for me.Like Kirsten Winters?Chase asked as he parked in front of Chloes Book Nook.How the hell do you know about her?Gabe asked.Its a small town.People talk.Im just glad its you and not me, because the last thing I need are the biddies of this town in my business again.Gabe shook his head.I will never get used to people knowing my business before Ive figured it out for myself.Eh, Ive learned to take it as a compliment.It means they think youre interesting.Well, hey, I am that, Gabe said, holding his hand out to Chase.Thanks again, man.Chase shook it.I really believe that youve changed for the better, Gabe.You dont have to worry about us, as long as you just keep doing what youre doing.Gabes eyes were stinging, and he tried to shake off the emotions raging inside.No one had ever forgiven him for that night.Not the people he grew up with or his mother, who had probably died hating him for making her life harder.But Chasewhom hed beaten, blamed, and cut all ties withwas forgiving him.Telling him that he knew Gabe was trying and that they were good to start over.Rubbing his hands over his face to wipe away any moisture, he said, Thanks, man.Chase slapped him on the back.What can I say?Ive matured.Gabe choked out a laugh.I appreciate that.It had to happen sometime, right?Amen.Gabe climbed out and, with a wave at Chase, headed around the back of the building.Jogging up the stairs to his apartment, he was almost to the top before he heard deep, booming barks and realized they were coming from inside.The door swung open and although he registered Caroline standing in the doorway, holding a tiny ball of fur in her hand, that wasnt the main focus of his oh, shit reaction.No, his eyes were trained on what could only be described as Beast from The Sandlot, stepping so close he could feel the dogs hot breath right in his crotch.Please dont bite my nuts off.Just as he was starting to sweat, another woman, with frizzy blonde hair, stepped up and called softly, Killer.The dog whipped around and went back inside, just as Gabe sagged against the railing, and Caroline laughed.Thats not funny.I thought that dog was gonna bite my junk.Yes, because thats exactly what he wants.Look, I dont like dogs, especially not giant ones that come charging outside Caroline, Im gonna take off.If you wanna meet us later, we usually get to Hanks around seven thirty, the blonde said as she stepped past them, the giant dog sniffing at him as they went down the stairs.Hey, thanks for keeping me company, Callie.Any time.And thanks for getting that interview set up.But before he could ask what kind of interview, Caroline was already back inside.He followed behind her, closing the door with a loud click before turning to find her sitting on the couch with a baby bottle in one hand and a squirming, slurping kitten in the other.So who was that woman, and why was her giant fucking dog in our apartment?he asked, hoping the our would irritate her.And by the narrowing of her eyes and the clenching of her jaw, he figured hed hit a bulls eye.I dont bother you about your guests, she said.My guests dont bring Cujo with them.Killer is an extremely well behaved dog and goes with Callie everywhere.Hes like a service animal.Service animals serve handicapped people.She didnt look like there was anything wrong with her.There isnt, she snapped.Then why does she need a service animal?he asked, coming around the couch to face her.Caroline was beautiful in pajamas, looking tousled and sleepy, but in a black tank top that showed a generous amount of cleavage and blue jeans hugging her thighs, she was hotter than the blazes of hell.It was all he could do not to push her back on those plush pillows and take that full frowning mouth with his.But seeing how she currently had her hands occupied, and he was pretty sure shed bite him if he tried, he refrained.For post traumatic stress.And before you ask what happened, I dont know, and I wouldnt talk to you about it if I did, cause its none of your fucking businessor mine.Gabe watched her extract the bottle from the sleepy kittens mouth and place him back into a cardboard box by the couch.Getting up, she tried to move around Gabe, but he stopped her with a hand on her arm.A hand she immediately tried to shake off.Let go, she snarled.Tightening his grip, he said, You might not like me, princess, but we are living together, so what you do and who you bring into this apartment is my business.Oh yeah?So I have to explain who my guests are, but you can take advantage of drunk girls in your room, and I cant say anything?First of all, he said, rage clipping his words, I didnt take advantage of anyone.I would never hurt a woman, and I definitely wouldnt take advantage of her.But Im also not going to leave some girl too drunk to take care of herself at a bar or her apartment and take the chance of her choking on her own vomit or something worse.So I let her stay here.And just because he resented her accusations, he added, And the reason why she slammed out of here all pissed off?When she woke up, hung over, and tried to start something with me ...sexually, I told her no thanks.He could tell she was struggling with whether to believe him or not, and it made him wonder how many men had hurt her.How many had taken advantage of her in some way to make her think the worst of him?I am not perfect, but I can promise you, I would never hurt a womanphysically or otherwise, he said, loosening his grip on her arm.But not everyone is like that, which is why its important to be careful who you bring home.You never answered me, though, she said.Why is it any of your business?Because if you bring the wrong guy home and he starts hurting you, Im the one who is going to handle him.She burst out laughing, shocking the hell out of him.You think youre going to have to rescue me?Caroline stepped into him, as if trying to back him up against the wall, but he stood his ground.Their bodies were almost touching as she looked up at him and whispered teasingly, I thought you werent a hero, Gabriel.Gabe knew she was baiting him, and it worked.White hot desire prickled his skin as he leaned into her body.Her smell wrapped around him like a blanket, lemony sweetness making his mouth water.Im not.Im a bad man who has done things that would make sweet little girls like you quake in their boots.Im not wearing boots.Im saying, if you know whats good for you, youll back up out of my face.Lets get one thing straight.You dont Hed given her a chance, but as hed said before, he wasnt a nice man.Wrapping his arm around her waist, he pulled her flush up against his body, and before she could finish her startled What the his head dipped down as he claimed her mouth in a hard kiss.Carolines whole body stiffened, and he felt her tiny fist shove at him, but he held fast, sweeping his tongue out to trail across her lips.Suddenly, he felt her hand splay out against his chest and her body soften, her mouth opening and her breath mingling with his.Gentling his hold on her, he slipped his tongue inside, the warmth of her mouth drawing him in further.She was everything he had imagined, soft breasts pressing into him as his hands trailed down to rest against the small of her back, just above her ass.He itched to cup her and bring her closer, but he didnt want to spook her.Deepening the kiss, he ran his hands up her back, a thrill shooting through him when her own hands slipped up to his shoulders.He caught her low moan in his mouth and lost all worry that she didnt want him.Despite his resolve to stay away from Caroline, he couldnt stop, not when the reality of having her in his arms was so much better than the fantasy.To his surprise, Caroline broke the kiss, her hands gripping his shoulders hard.Stop.What are you doing?Her voice was husky, and her eyes were still half closed, but the question was like a bucket of ice water.What was he doing?What were they doing?She had kissed him back and thoroughly enjoyed it too.Gabe took two steps back to give his raging cock some room.Just the brief press of her curves had given him a full on erection, and he cursed himself for being weak, but she just kept challenging him, pushing him.He thought hed outgrown his rash behavior years ago, but apparently, a leopard just couldnt change his spots.The taste of her lingered on his lips, and just he was about to lick them, she came fully out of her stupor.And slapped himhard enough to knock his head back.Dont you ever touch me again, she said.Rubbing his cheek and jaw, he tried to ease the sting.You kissed me back.And that makes it okay, how?She fled the living room before he could respond, her bedroom door slamming behind her.Okay, so he might have deserved the slap for kissing her, knowing she probably wouldnt appreciate it, but she had been daring him.Otherwise, she wouldnt have stepped into him like that, teasing him with that soft voice and those lips he couldnt stop thinking about.Man, did she have a hard hand.Walking over to the mirror on the dining room wall, Gabe studied the bright red imprint of her hand and rubbed at it.Most women didnt knock a guys jaw off for stealing a kiss, especially when they had seemed into it.This was fucking nuts.Hed lived with this woman less than a week, and all they did was fight.Granted, hed wanted to keep her at bay, but he never wanted to make her feel threatened.You were the one who told her you were a bad guy.How can she trust you if youre telling her one thing and doing another?The fact was, if they were going to survive their temporary situation, Gabe owed Caroline more than one apology.Whatever her issues, he had made the wrong move, and he needed to make it right.The story of his life.Thirteen The only stalking that should be done in Idaho is during hunting season.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE STIRRED HER Jack and Coke and tried to shake off her shitty day.At least one good thing had come from it; she had made a friend.Callie sat quietly next to her, smiling and nodding at whatever Mike Stevens was saying.Callie and she had talked for hours earlier, and when shed asked Caroline to come out with them, Caroline had been hesitant.But after Gabe had kissed her, shed been emotional and crazed and needed to get the hell out of there.When Callie had texted her, saying they were going to dinner too, she had said yes.Shed been worried about sneaking out without bumping into Gabe, but thankfully, he was gone when shed come out of her room.She wanted to put Gabe and his unwelcome kiss from her mind.Which was hard to do when his stupid face kept popping into her head, bringing a tingling sensation to her lips, which reminded her of how he had crossed a line and how, for a split second, shed wanted to let him.To let him take control and make her feel something, anything besides anger, pain, and being generally unwanted.But then she remembered they could barely stand each other and that she was no longer sixteen, trying to fill a void inside her.Shed had every intention of picking and choosing her partners carefully, weighing the benefits, taking in the risks ...And Gabe was just too big a gamble.Forget the fact that she knew very little about him, except that he was a wash of contradictions.Their first meeting, hed been arrogant and a major dick, but when hed offered to share the apartment, hed been almost charming.He hated accepting praise when he was kind and lashed out at her when she started to see the good in him.She just couldnt get a handle on who he was, and it scared her.But when hed kissed her, it had felt like she was floating for half a second and then, boom, her skin was burning like molten lava, hot and fast.Every stroke of his tongue had left her weak, tingly, and craving more of him.She had been ready to surrender completely until the voice in her head had started ranting.You arent in control.He is.The slap had been a reaction after the fact, but Gabe hadnt been wrong.She had kissed him back, had moaned and enjoyed him.Shed given him every indication that she liked what he was doing.What was wrong with her?She might be attracted to Gabe, but he wasnt the guy.He wasnt what she needed.He was like every other loser she had hooked up with over the years: selfish, only in it for a good time.That was her past.She was almost thirty one years old, and she needed to break the cycle.No more Mr.Right Now.She needed a mature, stable guy.Someone who would show the town of Rock Canyon that she had finally grown up.So, Caroline, Callie said you flip bars for a living?The question came from Travis Bowers, Gemmas country rock star husband, who was sitting across from her at the round table, nursing a beer.Travis was definitely the type of man her mother would have called a tall glass of water, with his curly brown hair and five oclock shadow making him look like a rugged roughneck, looking for trouble.I did, but Ive switched my focus to consulting.I want to set down roots somewhere instead of picking up and moving every couple of months to a new town, new city.I understand completely, Travis said, picking up Gemmas hand and bringing it to his lips for a kiss.Caroline almost rolled her eyes but caught herself.It wasnt their fault that she wasnt the type of woman to attract the hand holding, eyes for her only type of man.She never had been.She attracted weaklings who liked a woman to tell them what to do and usually had no imagination in the bedroom; the charmers who wanted to see if they could land her and then tell all their buddies about their exploits; and the assholes who liked strong women only as long as they could break them.Every one of them was definitely on her new DO NOT DO list.I heard Eric and Hank are fighting over your services, Mike said, reaching over to steal some of Gracies nachos while she was onstage singing the Judds Mama Hes Crazy.It was karaoke night at Hanks, and Caroline had wanted to stake out the little bar in action.She could see why this night was taking away business from Bucks.The karaoke alone was a great draw, but Hanks had a 1 2 3 promotion, too: one dollar longnecks, two dollar nachos, and three dollar margaritas.I said Id give them an assessment and upon retainer, Id draw up a recommended business plan.First come, first served, Caroline said, sitting back in her chair.Ive got to say, though, Hanks doesnt seem to be hurting on karaoke night.The only problem Hanks has is when Hank starts drinking, Gemma said, making a face.Caroline sat forward.He drinks in his own bar?More like gets shit faced in it, Mike said.I feel bad for the guy because hes on his own, but he can get downright unpleasant.Then hes a waste of my time, Caroline said with a sigh.How do you mean?Travis asked.Well, for starters, if he gets drunk in his own bar, he runs the risk of his employees and customers not only taking advantage of him but getting out of control.This drink, Caroline said, holding up her Jack and Coke, is too strong, which tells me the bartenders not measuring shots correctlywasting alcohol and eating into profits.They stared at her until, as a group, they each took a sip of their drinks, except Travis, who had the only longneck.A few of them nodded their heads in agreement.Caroline checked the time on her phone again, and Mike asked, You got somewhere to be?Before she could answer, Gracie finished her song, and their table broke into thunderous applause and obnoxious whoops of encouragement.Gracie sashayed back to the table, demonstrating a courtly bow as she said, Thank you.Thank you.She sat down next to Caroline and wrapped her thin arms around her shoulders before giving Caroline a smacking kiss on the cheek.And how are you enjoying Hanks?Her smile was slightly silly, and Caroline guessed she had started the party early, especially when she moved on before Caroline could answer.Did you know that this woman is an honest to God hero?She freaking crawled into a Dumpster to save a gaggle of kittens I dont think kittens come in gaggles, Mike said, earning a scowl from Gracie.Whatever.The point is that she is amazeballs, and if anyone messes with herGracie thumped her chest and almost fell off her chairthey are messing with me.Lucky you, Gemma said from across the table.Caroline wasnt sure how she felt about Gracies admiration but decided it was better than Gracies hating her guts.So are you one of those crazy animal lovers, then?Travis asked, yelping when Gemma pinched him.What?I didnt say anything about you.Actually, I like animals but have never had any desire to own one.I moved around too much.But now, the reason I keep checking the clock on my phone is because the kittens have to eat every two hours.Wait, you arent an animal lover, but youre keeping kittens that you found in the trash?Mike asked.How many are there?Two, and Im not keeping them.Im just fostering them until they can be put up for adoption, Caroline said, trying to picture handing over her babies to someone else.In just the few days shed had them, they had already started to gain weight, and the minute she picked them up, they started that clicking purr shed come to love.Last night, as shed watched The Big Bang Theory, shed let them cuddle against her chest.It was hard not to love the little squirts.Uh huh, and how does your roommate feel about that?Travis asked, a smirk on his face.When I showed him the apartment, he didnt exactly seem like the warm and fuzzy type.Traviss opinion irked her.It was true that Gabe wasnt Mr.Sunshine and Roses, but he had saved the gray kitten.He had his moments of actually being a human being.Too bad they were few and far between.Actually, he helped me save them.Its true.I was there, Gracie said.How?Callie asked.He stimulated the little grey ones heartbeat by rubbing him and even breathed into his nose and mouth.Huh.I guess people do have layers, Mike said, mimicking Shrek.How had the conversation turned toward the very man she was trying to forget?Standing up, she gave everyone an apologetic smile.Im sorry I have to go, I had a lot of fun, but Id better go feed them.Do you need me to walk you home?Mike asked with a flirtatious smile.This is the type of guy you should be thinking about, not infuriating Neanderthals who dont know how to treat a woman.Thats okay.Im right up the street, Caroline said.She patted Callies shoulder.Ill call you tomorrow.Okay, Callie said.Grabbing her coat and purse, Caroline headed for the door.The cold wind hit her face as she walked outside, and she struggled to get her coat on as she made her way back toward her apartment.The streetlamps were lit up nicely, though, and despite the two drinks shed had, she was nowhere near being drunk.As she rounded the alley corner, she thought maybe shed open that bottle of merlot in the cupboard and have a glass before bed.She just hoped luck was on her side and Gabe was asleep or out.She wasnt quite ready to face him yet.Suddenly, strong hands grabbed her from behind and slammed her into the brick building next to her.Her cheek hit the wall and pain exploded in her skull.What did you tell him, you stupid bitch?A dark voice hissed in her ear, and hot breath dampened her skin.Through the painful haze, she realized it was Kyle.Fear ripped through her as he pressed his body into hers, flattening her between him and the hard, cold surface.What And dont even think about fucking lying to me, he growled low.Ky ...Kyle ...I Whatever you said to him, youd better fix it.Im not going to have the life Ive built ruined by some slut who wants to clear her conscience, Kyle said, gripping her hair in his fist until she cried out in pain.What the fuck is going on out there?Gabes voice called from above.Caroline heard the heavy fall of his feet on the metal stairs and tried to cry out a warning, but her throat had closed and all that came out was a whimper.Remember what I said, Kyle warned before he let her go.She heard the clip of running, the sound becoming fainter in the distance.Tears seeped from the corner of her eyes, and she tried to breathe, to calm her quaking body, but she was scared.And angry, so angry.Her conscience?She hadnt done anything wrong.Did he actually think she felt guilty about what hed done to her?Dont you?You are constantly telling yourself that you should have known, should have seen through his charm?Isnt that a guilty conscience?Suddenly, hard hands grabbed her arms, and she turned, swinging, prepared for Kyle coming back, but Gabe caught her fists instead.Shhh, its okay.Youre okay.Unable to hold herself up any longer, she collapsed against him, hating the weakness.She could take care of herselfhad been doing so since she was a kidbut she couldnt seem to fight this one fear: the fear of being Kyles victim again.Without asking, Gabe gathered her up in his arms, holding her tightly against his chest as he strode toward the apartment.She tried to remember that he was a jerk, a man whom she shouldnt trust at all, but his hard body and comforting arms helped her shaking subside.He made her feel safe, and if he hadnt been upstairs, hadnt been listening ...Thank you, she whispered against his shoulder as he climbed the stairs.He didnt respond, just adjusted her in his arms to open the front door.The living room light hit her eyes and stung for half a second.Yowza, thats bright.Still he said nothing.Gently, he deposited her on the couch, and before she could miss his warmth, he had dimmed the lights.Stretching her mouth open, she winced when a lightning bolt of pain shot through her, and she touched the spot where her face had collided with the building.Well, thats gonna bruise.Who was he?Gabe asked, his voice almost too low to hear.He works for my father, she said.Your father hired someone to rough you up?he fairly shouted.No, no.This was something ...else, she said, unwilling to get more personal than that.Despite his timely intervention and rescue, he was still just her roommate.If she hadnt even told her own sisters about what Kyle had done, there was no way she was going to share her feelings with a man she hardly knew.Silence stretched in the small room, and she looked away from his intense, searching eyes to check on the kittens, sleeping peacefully in the box.Im surprised theyve slept this long.I figured theyd be up and crying by now.They were, which is why I was out here in the first place.The little bastards were pitching a fit, and I fed them so theyd shut up.Then I heard something outside and decided to see what in the hell was going on down there.He reached out to brush her hair back, and his fingertips grazed her forehead, leaving a trail of tingles in their wake.Im still trying to figure that out.Why do you care?I told you.Your crazy became my crazy the second I let you move in.You mean when you stole my apartment.A small smiled stretched his full lips and before she could stop herself, she said, You should do that more often.What?Boldly, she placed two fingers on his bottom lip.Smile.I smile, he said.Not that sarcastic grin you use or the one you think is charming, she said, dropping her hand from his mouth.I mean a real smile.He paused.I guess I dont have a lot to smile over.The conversation was fast becoming personal and intimate, two things that made Caroline squirm.I appreciate the help, really, and Im sorry that I sort of fell apart on you, but this really isnt your problem.Theres no roommate code, nothing in our little arrangement that says you have to step in and take on my issues.When your issues follow you home and assault you in the alley below our apartment, it becomes my business.She bent over and picked up the kittens box.Its going to be better for both of us if you stay out of it, okay?Besides, arent you the guy who said youre not a hero?Fourteen Whats the point of living in a small town if you cant get up in someone elses business every once in a while?Miss Know It All   GABE WALKED OUT of Honeys assisted living facility, carrying the painting she had made for his new place in his hands.Hed grabbed a protective bike bag to transport it home, once Sharla had given him the heads up.Honey had been in a good spot today, almost like her old self, asking him about his motorcycle and what girls he was interested in.It was a good day when she remembered nothing of the accident and still looked at him with hero worship in her eyes.He usually called before heading up for a visit, but he had needed to get out of the house this weekend.Since hed started asking questions of Caroline about the man whod assaulted her last week, she had been avoiding him like the plague.And hed made it easy for her.Not because he didnt want to see her, but because of the emotions her attack had stirred in him.Hed wanted to wrap her up and keep her close, to never let her out of his sight.Too bad he hadnt gotten a good look at the fucker.Whoever he was, Caroline was clearly scared of him.Holding her in his arms, he could still remember the way shed trembled.Caroline was a strong woman, and to see her so vulnerable made him want to tear someone apart.By the time he parked on the street two hours later, it was close to five thirty.He had planned to stop by Chases tattoo shop to go over the logo design for Moriartys Custom Bikes, but feeling grimy, he climbed off the bike and pulled out the painting.He would hang it and then get cleaned up.Gabe walked through the alleyway and took the stairs two at a time.The draw of a hot shower was so exciting, he pushed open the door too quickly and hit the wall behind with the knob.Crap, what are you doing?Caroline yelled as she came around the corner.I do not want to pay a massive bill at the end of this lease because you come through the door like the Incredible Hulk.Gabe didnt say a word; he simply stared at her as he set the painting down gently against the wall.She looked good all the timeshe had been a knockout in that black dress at Bucksbut tonight ...Tonight, she was like a damn siren in a pair of fuck me heels.Her long dark hair was swept back and to the side, her brown eyes surrounded by smudgy black eye shadow.Her lush lips looked wet, and it gave him all kinds of ideas of how theyd feel, kissing their way along his body and around a certain part of his anatomy that was suddenly standing at full attention.The dress she had on was royal purple with a light shimmer to it, the heart shaped neckline creating a deep V of cleavage that made his hands eager to squeeze and test the weight of her breasts.And then there were her shapely legs, sliding down into leopard print heels.Leave them on while you screw me heels.He wanted to throw her over his shoulder and carry her back to his room, where hed strip her out of everything but those shoes.Suddenly, it occurred to him she wasnt dressing for his benefit, and his jaw clenched.It was hard to deny the sudden urge to pound whoever shed had in mind when shed dolled herself up, and he knew it was unreasonable.He had no right to be jealous; she was a free agent who could go out with whomever.He didnt have to like it, though.Where the hell are you going, dressed like that?Well, if her pissed off look meant anything, that had been the wrong thing to say.I have a part in a Bond movie.Its forty degrees outside, he said, trying to gentle his tone and be the voice of reason.So?she said, eyeballing him like hed lost his damn mind.Ive got a jacket.Your tits are going to pop out of that dress if you bend over.Gabe, she said as she pulled her jacket off the back of the couch, when you can manage to put your dishes in the dishwasher without leaving food on them, I might take your advice.No, wait, why would I ever take your advice on fashion?Youre idea of style is a T shirt and jeans.He ignored her passive aggressive criticism.Damn, he liked the way she said his name.Hed like it even better in another, more sultry tone, but hed take what he could get.Wait ...When had he started wanting anything from Caroline?She was heading right for him, probably so she could escape out the front door, but he was having none of that.Stepping into her path, Gabe asked again, Well, you have to admit, your girls are popping up and saying howdy in the friendliest way Ive seen yet.Well, they arent saying howdy to you, she said, moving to his right.Grinning, he side stepped with her.Then who are they saying howdy to?Caroline let out an exasperated breath.Are you trying to irritate me?I didnt know I had to try.I thought you just woke up, and the annoyance was there.Oh, no, some mornings I wake up thinking, I mustve imagined it.He cant be that bad.And then I see you, and it all comes flooding back like a drunken night of idiocy.When she tapped his chest with a long, glittery purple nail, he resisted the urge to grab it and nibble the tip.Only its not my idiocy Im remembering.When she tried to out maneuver him again, he caught her around the waist and said, Speaking of idiots, whos your hot date?How do you know Im going on a date?Cause a woman doesnt dress like that unless shes trolling for a man or going out with one, Gabe said.You dont know him, she said, struggling against him.What kind of man asks a woman like you out and doesnt even bother to come to the door?Hes coming to the door.I just didnt want the first thing he sees to be you, she snapped.Why?Ill be nice to him, Gabe said.Would you let go?Hes going to be here any minute, and youre wrinkling my dress!Suddenly, there was a knock on the door, and Caroline pushed him away.Gabe leaned back against the couch and waited as she opened the door.Hey, Mike, she said to the guy on the porch.Wow, you look amazing, the unknown guy said.Gabes good humor fled.Heat curled in his stomach, easing out into his limbs until he wanted to punch someone, most of all the faceless guy in his doorway.That churning in your gut feels a lot like jealousy.Stepping up alongside Caroline, Gabe leaned his arm on the doorframe and gave the man on the porch his best dont fuck with me glare.Hey, Mike.Im Gabe.The guy was average height with brown eyes and short dark hair, and instead of being intimidated, he stuck his hand out with a smile.Ive heard a lot about you.You have?Gabe asked suspiciously, looking down at Caroline.Dont look at me.I avoid talking about you.Actually, Travis told me about you, that you make custom motorcycles.I was thinking Id come by your shop and see what you can come up with for me.The guy was lethal; Gabe would give him that.Hed charmed and disarmed him in five seconds flat.Taking Mikes still outstretched hand, he said, Im by appointment only until I get all the equipment moved in, but you can usually get me on my cell.The two of them exchanged numbers, and as he slipped his phone back into his pocket, Gabe caught Carolines irritable expression.What?Do you think my date and I can leave now?she asked.Sure, take him.Get him out of here, Gabe said, but as they started down the stairs, he saw Mikes hand move to the small of her back.Gabe knew what she felt like, right there at the curve of her back, and he didnt want any other mans hands on her, even if that man seemed like an okay guy.Then Gabe realized he was halfway down the stairs, ready to remove Mikes arm from the socket if he didnt stop touching her, and froze.Caroline turned a few steps down and looked up at him.She must have heard his footsteps or felt the vibration.Was there something else, Gabe?Damn, there was his name again, but this time it had been spoken softly.Their eyes met, and he wanted to close the distance and claim her.I just wanted to know if you need me to feed the vermin.The small smile she gave him unnerved him and made him feel like a kid, trying to please his teacher by asking for extra credit.Only if they cry.I just fed them half an hour ago.All right, then, he said, searching for something else to say.As they started climbing down again, he called out, Hey, Mike?Yeah?Mike said from the bottom, holding his hand out for Caroline.When she slipped hers into his, Gabe almost growled.Treat her with respect, he said.Of course, I If you dont, Ill chain you to the back of my bike and drag you behind me until your own mother wouldnt recognize you.Mikes jaw dropped, and Caroline scowled.I have a father, she said.I dont need you Have a good time, princess, he said, cutting off her rant.She flipped him the bird behind Mikes back before they walked out of sight, and he chuckled until he realized he was hanging out at home on a Saturday night.Alone.There was no way he could sit around the apartment all night, waiting for Caroline to come home.After his shower, hed hang up the painting and head out somewhere.Maybe hed check out Twin Falls nightlife.But as he stepped back inside, he heard a distinct scratching noise coming from Carolines room.Inside, he found the little gray tabby, Googlie, hanging over the side of his box.Caroline had named him Googlie for his big, googly eyes, and Gabe had to admit that the name fit.What are you doing, buddy?The kitten meowed in response, and Gabe padded over to pick up the fluff ball.Peeking over the edge of the box, he saw that Possum, the little cream colored kitten, was looking up at him, as if gauging the distance needed to jump.I guess your mom doesnt know what shes talking about, huh?Scooping up the second kitten, he held them both against his chest, their little purrs vibrating his hands.Stroking their fur with his thumbs, he carried them into the bathroom with him, let the kittens down on the floor, and turned on the shower.Googlie started to meow loudly, and he bent over to pick up the fuzz butt.Listen, dude, Im going to let you chill in here with me while I shower, and if youre cool, Ill let you watch some Dwayne Johnson with me.Sound good?Gabe felt the kittens purr and shook his head.Hed officially lost his mind if he was talking to a couple of cats.AM I PUTTING you to sleep over there?Caroline jerked as Mikes words penetrated her wandering thoughts.Im so sorry.I think the wine might be getting to me.What were you saying?Mike chuckled.Its all right.I dont really find motherboards all that interesting anyway.Was that really what he was talking about on a first date?Geez, no wonder you were thinking of something else.Or someone, to be exact.So, tell me more about you.Youre the one who has moved around and worked in exciting places.You must have stories, Mike said.Stories?Oh yeah, she had stories, but not the first date kind.She really didnt think a guy like Mike wanted to hear about the first year she spent away from home, how shed ended up stripping at some dive in Nevada just to get her car fixed.Or about the time shed been arrested for stealing a waitresss tip off the table because she had spent her last ten dollars on gas.Okay, well, I actually got started working in bars when I was nineteen.Id been on my own for a little over a year, and I took a job working as a waitress in this little sports bar.The owner, who was a wonderful man, liked my spunk, and by the time I was twenty one, I was head bartender.I kept advancing until he came to me one day and said, Look, I want to retire, and I think youve got a gift for this business.I know youve got a little something saved up.Do you want to make a deal?Caroline took a sip from her wineglass and smiled, And thats how I got my first bar.The waitress came over to clear their plates, and Caroline heard the faint sound of Lets Hear It for the Boy coming from her purse.She reached inside to grab it.When she glanced at the screen, it was a text from Val.OMG, I have no idea why, but apparently, Dad is investigating Kyle.Carolines heart started pounding as she remembered Kyles grip in her hair.You fix it ...Shit, she said aloud, immediately covering her mouth when she realized Mike and their waitress had heard her.Im sorry.Is everything okay?Mike asked as his handsome face knit with concern.He really is such a sweet guy.Its too bad theres just no spark.Yeah, my sister was just giving me an update on some family drama.No big deal.Are you sure?If you need me to drop you somewhere ...No, Im good.Shell fill me in later.But Carolines fingers itched to call or at least text Val to find out what she knew.She didnt know whether to be relieved or terrified that her father was looking into Kyles past.Kyle could still retaliate.Things could go bad fast.When Mike paid the check and offered to take her home so she could call her sister, she felt a little guilty that she was more excited than disappointed.But as nice as he was, his touch just didnt heat her up like Gabes did.Yes, shed been avoiding Gabe for a week, trying to puzzle through the roller coaster of emotions she was riding.On one hand, she knew what Gabe had told her, that he was no good and she couldnt count on him.Yet when shed needed him, hed been there.But every time you start to feel like theres something more to him, he shuts down.Besides, she didnt want to add serious complications to their living arrangement.God forbid they hook up and things turn awkward as shit.Why does it always have to be sex with you anyway?Why cant you just enjoy the fact that you dont want to bash his face in every five seconds?Which was true.Even his little stint into obnoxiousness this evening made her laugh more than want to kick him in his jewels.It was nice to finally not walk on eggshells around him, and hed even taken care of the kittens a few times.All in all, the roommate thing wasnt turning out as horrendous as shed thought.Well, except the dishes thing ...and a few times, shed found some of his dirty clothes suspiciously mixed in with hers.Shed taken the clothes and left them outside his door.Taped to his door, shed left a note that read, NOT YOUR MAID OR YOUR MOTHER.DO YOUR OWN LAUNDRY.Of course, the next day hed retaliated with his own note on the bathroom mirror.HEY CHEWBACCA, HOW ABOUT CLEANING THE DRAIN EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE?YOURE SHEDDING LIKE A SAINT BERNARD.A week ago, she probably would have gotten mad, but since the night of Kyles attack, something had shifted between them.He was so moody, but when shed needed him, hed been there, and she couldnt ignore the little voice that kept whispering in her head, Maybe hes different.Mike pulled over and parked in front of her building, and she realized she hadnt said a word to him the whole drive back.Shed been too busy thinking about Gabe.Thank you for tonight.It was lovely, she said once hed come around and opened her door.Youre welcome, he said.Ill walk you to your door.She wasnt going to say no, and when they reached the top of the stairs, he leaned over and gave her a chaste kiss on the cheek.Good night, Caroline.Night, she said, and as he climbed back down the stairs, she realized that he hadnt offered to call her or to try again another time.Maybe he sensed your lack of interest?Or maybe he realized he was actually not that into you.Unlocking the apartment door, she decided she was relieved.At least she wouldnt have to let him down easy now.She stepped inside and closed the door, clicking the lock into place.As she tiptoed behind the couch, she noticed Gabe stretched out, asleep, while The Scorpion King played low on the TV.In the dim light, she could see Googlie and Possums fuzzy bodies curled into Gabes neck.If she was one of those girls who melted and sighed at adorable sights, shed be goo.His face seemed darker, cast in the shadows and light from the TV, and more innocent in sleep.Well, except for the piercing and black ink on the side of his neck, but still, he was gorgeous to look at.Leaning over the couch, she touched his chest softly.Gabe.He startled awake, making her jump, he moved so fast.The kittens didnt seem too bothered by it, but Gabes dark eyes were wide as he looked around the room before finally focusing on her.Damn it; you scared me.Im sorry, she whispered.I tried to be gentle, but I was afraid if I left you there, youd end up with a kink in your neck.Gabe nodded before stretching his arms behind his head.Appreciate it.Carolines gaze hooked on those sinewy muscles coiling under his darkened skin, and suddenly she wanted to get away from him as fast as she could.Okay, well, Ill take the kittens for now, and you can go to sleep or finish your movie.Ill probably just turn in, he said, handing the protesting kittens off to her as he stood up.So, Mike didnt want to come in for another drink?Some men are gentleman, she said, cuddling the fuzzy bodies against her.Gabe stared at her hard, and when he spoke, his dark, husky words shot pure desire though her body.Princess, if I had come to pick you up and seen you in that dress, we wouldnt even have made it to the restaurant.Fifteen Has anyone noticed that the upcoming weather calls for two days of severe thunderstorms and right smack in the middle of that, a night of clear skies and a full moon?Crazy weather + a full moon = gossip palooza.So what will this wild weather bring us this time?Stay tuned.Miss Know It All   HOW THE HELL did Ellie find this out?I thought she was living with you, Caroline asked Valerie as the two of them sat in her apartment on Sunday morning.Caroline had wanted to get the scoop on their fatherand to keep from being alone with Gabe.After his parting comment, he had gone into his room, all dramatic and confusing, and it had just pissed her off.Two plus weeks of living together, and he was still a mystery of freaking epic proportions.Shes trying to find an apartment, maybe a roommate.But she went back to Dads house to pack up some of her stuff and heard Dad talking on the phone about dredging up any past criminal behavior that the Jenners might have buried on Kyle.Either way, it looks like Dad may finally be shedding some light on Kyles bastardly deeds.And she doesnt even know about what he did to you.So, will your hot and spicy roommate be gracing us with his presence?Val asked abruptly.What?No, I mean ...I dont know, Caroline said, jarred from her deep thoughts.Well, I doubt hes at church.He doesnt seem like the seeking redemption type.Honestly, I dont know what type he is, Caroline said grouchily.Vals face lit up.Im sensing a tone.What did he do now?Tell me everything.Nothing, hes just ...How could she explain that, with a single sentence, Gabe could send her into a lust filled state for which there was only one cure, and she was all too aware that he was just down the hall, able to take care of it?We wouldnt even have made it to the restaurant.Why did he have to say things like that?For hours afterward, she had tossed and turned, imagining all the things they would have done, ready to scream in frustration.If things had gone better with Mike, Gabe wouldnt have been able to creep into her mind and make her think all kinds of naughty thoughts.No, instead, the seed had been planted and firmly had taken root.Weeks of fantasizing and daydreaming about Gabes body, his kiss, and his touch had been tormenting her, and now that she had tasted a sample, well ...Now, Caroline wanted Gabe in a bad, down and dirty, not coming up for air for days kinda way.Just what?Val said.Come on, stop holding out on me.I know there is something going on with Mr.Tall, Dark, and Pierced.He has this almost dangerous edge about him Hes not dangerous, okay?Caroline hadnt meant to snap, but she didnt like her sister describing Gabe that way.He wasnt dangerous, no matter how many times hed told her he was bad news.Val looked like Caroline had just kicked her dog.Okay, I was only teasing.No, Im sorry.Hes just ...weird.Vals lips twitched like she was fighting a smile, and Caroline was happy her sisters good mood was restored.Weird is not the word I would use to describe him, but to each her own, Val said.It wasnt Carolines first choice either, but she really wasnt prepared to share her innermost thoughts and feelings on Gabe, especially when she wasnt even sure what her feelings were, beyond wanting to jump his bones.Where did you get that painting?Val asked, looking at something over Carolines shoulder.What paint Caroline paused as she studied the landscape canvas, taking in the beauty of the strokes.The mountains were a steely gray with white caps, sparsely covered by green trees.Clouds almost seemed to float over the light blue sky, and the green valley appeared lush and wild at the base of the mountain.Caroline stood up and walked over to the painting.In the corner were the initials HM.Who was HM?Well?Val prodded.Its not mine, Caroline said, admiring the close up details.Its Gabes.Huh, I wonder if he could get me one.Its gorgeous.Yeah, Caroline said.Curiouser and curiouser.So, do you want to come over to Justins for dinner tonight?Hmmm.It was on the tip of Carolines tongue to say no thanks, but Val added, You have hardly been around Justin, and I want you to like him.Come on.Everett is a fantastic cook and Whos Everett?Caroline walked back over to the couch and sat down, absently wondering whether or not Gabe would tell her who H.  M.  was if she asked.Justins older brother.Justins older brother, me, and you?Are you trying to set me up or something?Caroline asked, amused.Val actually laughed.
