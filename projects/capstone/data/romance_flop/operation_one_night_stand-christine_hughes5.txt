I decided then and there that I would learn as much from Yolanda Page as I could, no matter what it took.As soon as I stepped out of the bathroom I ran into Michael.Hi.God, he was close.Hi.He smelled like coconut.Hi.I already said that.Listen, I hope you didnt get the wrong impression about me back there.He rubbed his thumb across his lower lip.I wanted to reach up and bite it.Wow.He was really close.I pressed my back against the wall and shook my head to loosen the dirty thoughts swirling through.Good, because, well, Yolanda is an amazing editor and Mr.Little has been great to me.I wouldnt want them to get the wrong impression about ourhe trailed his long fingers down my armrelationship.That was confusing.I watched his mouth as he spoke with perfect pronunciation.His lips were full, giving way to beautiful white teeth.A small dimple formed at the corner of his mouth whenever he smiled.I knew he was saying more, talking more, but I couldnt concentrate.My knees wobbled and he caught me when I buckled.Stepping back, he looked at me and smirked.So, its a date?See you at the table.He retreated into the mens room and I was relegated to what felt like the walk of shame back to the table.A date?What did I miss?I really needed to rein in my sex brain when people were talking to me.Thankfully, Yolanda and Mr.Little were talking, so I was left to sit in silence.I wasnt sure what, if anything, I would say.Was I just sexually harassed?Was Michael Mortimer just full of himself?Did I really care?After five years of being the good girl, the quiet girl, the responsible girl, was I really too terribly concerned that not one but two very good looking men showed interest?Okay, three if you counted Jim from Kansas.And I did.Michael arrived back at the table just as the food arrived.He was right, he did not order an ordinary plate of French fries.They were the most addictive things Id ever tried.For the most part, I ignored his subtleand not so subtlecome ons.I think Yolanda, on the other hand, caught on to each.Other than that, lunch was pleasant and I was growing more and more excited about my role in the company.I mustve lucked out.Apparently, it was the goal of most to work with Yolanda in some capacity.And there I was, the new girl, and the opportunity fell right into my lap.I knew I had a lot to learn and I had no doubt shed show me the ropes, even if her demeanor flip flopped between warm and severe.But then again, work was work and I made a promise to myself not to let it overtake my life ever again.I just hoped that thought process would fly with Yolanda Page.Of course that remained to be seen.What was really weighing on my mind was getting the girls here and taking them to see Ryan on a billboard in his underwear.And that image beat any amount of flirting Michael Mortimer could toss my way.TwelveI met Sarah and Melody in front of my building at six.I needed to show them what I had seen.Words would never be able to do it justice and I needed them to have the same reaction I had.I needed to know I wasnt crazy.I have to show you something.There was no time for greetings.I grabbed both girls by the arms and herded them up the street.I walked quickly, keeping the conversation to a minimum.I didnt want to give it away.I needed them to see it like I had seen it.Its just up here.Care, really.You make us hike all the way into the city?We didnt have to go to Murphys, you know.We were just busting your balls.I dont have balls.Fewer words more walking.I was focused; I had a mission not unlike Operation One Night Stand.This was Operation Whatthefuck.Dont be so literal.Im just saying if youre too scared to run into RyanOr cant handle being around Bartender BrianIts just around this corner.It was all I could do not to break into a run.We turned the corner and there he was.Life size, in his underwear, on a bus shelter, in the middle of the city.The girls, behind me talking in hushed tones, didnt notice that I had stopped.They both ran into me.Care!What the hell?Sarah questioned in her this better be good voice as she knelt down to pick up her purse.I said nothing.Instead, I pointed.I turned to them and watched the realization form in their eyes, surprise contort their faces, and their mouths gape open.Operation Whatthefuck was a rousing success.Holy fuck!Melody squealed as she wobbled on her heels.No way!Sarah ran up to the poster, touching it as if she could somehow feel the hardness of his abs, the smooth lines of his skin, the girth of his dick.I could wash my panties on those abs!Right?So Im not crazy?Thats Ryan.Goddamn Caroline!You banged this guy?Its like when Satan decided to put the alphabet in math.Terrifying and curious at the same time.Melody stepped toward the poster, her jaw dropped in wonder.Yeah.Hes in his underwear, Sarah mentioned quietly.I know.On a bus shelter, she continued.No kidding!In the middle of the fucking city!Melody exclaimed.My thoughts exactly.Thank God were friends.When shit like this happens, Care, you do not keep calm and carry on.You call in sick and celebrate by getting a tattoo.Melody joined Sarah at the poster, inspecting every pixilated inch.Their eyes wide, they took a synchronized step back, cocking their heads to the side.They took him in.They took in their surroundings.The gravity of this turn of events was not lost on them.I fucked an underwear model.I fucked him until my vagina was bruised enough to need an ice pack the next morning.For a moment, I felt like a celebrity, even if it was only among my friends.Caroline, do you know what this means?Yeah, that Ryan is a model.No.Well, yeah but no.It means that not only is he an underwear model, but you Caroline, you, as opposed to every other woman that passes this advertisement, have seen whats under the briefs.The rest of us can only imagine, fantasize even, about whether or not that right thereMel placed her hand over his packageis stuffed.I broke out in a fit of laughter.The seriousness of her tone was priceless.I could have sworn she was going to point out some cosmic fatetype piece of wisdom.Instead, she waxed poetic about the importance of whether or not Ryans junk was Photoshopped.Cucumber big, Sarah whispered the words.Wait!Melody spun around and grabbed my arms.The proximity of her face to mine was a bit unnerving.Youre going out with him on Friday.Reality crashed down and I thought my heart would stop.Backing up with my hands raised in front of me in defense, I shook my head.I cant go out with him on Friday.I cant go out with him ever!Why not?Sarah stopped ogling the poster long enough to ask.Well, because look!Hes a fucking underwear model!What the hell would he want with me?Thats too much pressure.I bent down with my hands on my knees and forced myself to breathe.Id never had a panic attack before and I wondered briefly if I was about to experience one.Um, earth to Caroline.Didnt potato pants willingly go home with you the other night?Didnt he call you and ask you out again?Yeah, but he probably didnt mean it.I mean, I ran into him at the gym, he probably felt bad andStop it.Stop it right now.Knock that shit off.I dont get the problem.Melody truly sounded confused.I wasnt sure I would be able to explain my newly developed sense of reticence.Mel, dont try to figure me out.Youll honestly just exhaust yourself.Hell, I was exhausted trying to figure me out myself.Fuckety fuck, Care.Here we go.You know theres a thin line between silly and stupid.Stop fucking border hopping.Sarah jabbed her finger at me before stepping away.Listen, sweets, I want you to repeat after me.I am good enough.Mel, you dont get it.I didnt get it.Repeat after me.I am good enough.She stood in front of me and placed my face between her hands, staring at me in a way that made me uncomfortable.I shook my head.Jesus Christ, Caroline!You hit the fucking jackpot with this guy as far as physical specimens go.I cant speak to his intelligence, but fuck!Look at him!Who the hell cares!Let him share your bed for a while.Whats the harm?Melody threw her hands up in obvious frustration.I just dont understand what a guy like him would see in someone like me.Someone like?Melodys eyes bugged out of her head and I thought theyd roll onto the sidewalk.Unfuckingbelievable.Have you seen yourself?Sarah grabbed my shoulders and spun me around so I was looking at myself in the glass reflection of a small store window.I wasnt ugly.I knew that.I wasnt particularly tall.I wasnt a size zero.But I was in great shape.My hair was shiny, my teeth were white.My jeans hugged my ass; I never needed to wear a bra if I didnt want to.The sprinkle of freckles across my nose wasnt annoying.The freckles were fun.I had my mothers bone structure.I had my fathers eyes.I was pretty.I am good enough, I whispered so only I could hear.What the hell was I thinking?Where did that moment of self doubt come from?Was it a residual scar from dating Steven all those years?From working in a thankless, boring job?From never having the balls to follow my heart?Why would Ryan want me?No, no, no.I am good enough, I said with more force.What was that?Melody leaned in closer.I am good enough.It felt good to say the words.Thank God, Care.I thought I was gonna have to get you some syrup to go along with that twat waffle attitude.Twat waffle what?Twat waffle attitude.Basically when a woman acts like a douche.Nice.Care, you have to realize who you are, what you are, and all the good that goes along with it.Sarah grabbed my hand.We love you and it kills us when you dont see what we see.And, truth be told, you didnt see anything but Steven for five years.We sat by and watched as you disappeared.We know it will take time, but we can see the old Caroline coming back.I smiled.Youre right.I dont know what I was thinking.Well, Melody began, its not every day you see your most recent bang in his underwear, on a poster, on the side of a bus shelter, in the middle of the city.Both women were back to staring at Ryan, heads cocked to the side.No shit.I was still tingling from the discovery.I pulled out my broken phone.Looking forward to Friday.I shoved my phone in my purse and stared at the backs of my friends tilted heads.I swear it was like an epiphany proving, once again, that I needed those two women in my life.They were brought to me by some random divine intervention.Come on.I need a drink.Im starving.Youre always starving.How the hell are you still a size four?Melody grinned wickedly.Lots and lots of sex.I laughed.I think Im beginning to know a thing or two about that.ThirteenThe week sailed on.By Friday, Id learned more about the publishing industry and revising and editing manuscripts and contracts than I thought my brain could process.It was wonderful.Yolanda, though quite terse when she was engrossed in work, was a great mentor.Of course, her remarks would have weakened my knees a few months prior but I was able to see she was molding me.And I was determined to use the woman for everything she could teach me.I was happy to stay on her good side.Fortunately, it wasnt hard to figure out how to do that.Id learned quickly that a big ego needed stroking and positive reinforcement and if thats what it took to make Yolanda happy then thats just what Id do.Michael, on the other hand, was a bit harder to read.And I couldnt quite figure out why he was hanging around the office.One minute he was sullen and short, fitting the moody author stereotype and the next minute he was full of ego and self confidence.When he was the latter, he was sure to hit on me in what had become typical Michael Mortimer fashioncrude, crass, and direct.There was no beating around the bush with him.Hed taken an interest in me and he was sure to let me know when the mood suited him.Michael was a good looking guy, and had the brains to match the exterior package, but I still didnt know what was going on with Ryan.Not that I wanted a relationship.God!It was the last thing I needed.But if I was going to sleep around, I needed it to be with one person at a time.By late Friday afternoon, I was at my desk packing up my things for the weekend.Streaming my favorite radio station kept my mood light, and considering I had quite a bit of reading to do between then and the following Monday, I was in a great mood.Id hoped for an easy few days off but Yolanda wasnt having it.It was a good thing I enjoyed the work.And at least I had a date later that night.Sarah and Melody had slammed the door on my self doubt, effectively helping me to see excitement in new possibilities.I kicked off my shoes and started dancing to an upbeat song.Using my pencil, I began singing into it like a microphone.A small knock at the door interrupted me.Come in.Im already in.Michael.I was just, uh I dropped my pencil on my desk and willed myself to remain calm.Getting ready to leave?Yeah.I have a lot of stuff to go over this weekend.Just making sure I have everything.Did you think any more about what we talked about on Monday?Monday.Monday.Monday.I wracked my brain trying to remember if there was anything I missed.Noticing my struggle with the topic, Michael laughed easily.I asked if you could accompany me to a dinner next Saturday evening.I felt like a deer in the headlights.When the hell did he ask me that?Walking around my desk, Michael leaned in and whispered, I asked you when we were at the restaurant.Ill be out of town until then and I was hoping to get your answer before I left.My knees weakened and I remembered.Hed asked when we ran into each other by the bathrooms.And if I remembered correctly, Id agreed to think about it.Unfortunately I didnt remember until that moment, so I hadnt done much thinking.Um, well, where is it again?At some restaurant downtown.Im supposed to do a reading or something.You dont have to go.I mean, if you have plans.But I spoke with Yolanda and Oscar and they both agreed it would be good for you to represent the company.I dont have plans.I mean, if Yolanda and Mr.Little think I should goWell, then.Good.Its a date.Not a date.Im sorry?A smile played mischievously across his lips.Its not a date.I mean, I cant date you.Do you want to date me?He was unbelievably close.I swore he could hear my heart speed up.Thats not what I meant.I meant, well, Im pretty sure Yolanda wouldnt like it.And you care what Yolanda thinks?Of course I do.Plus, Im not really a fan of office romances.They dont generally end well for me.I visibly shivered as he ran his hand down my arm.Calm down, Caroline.Its just dinner, and a work related dinner at that.I swear Ill be on my best behavior.Ill text you the address.Better yet, Ill make sure a car picks you up.And wear a dress.He pressed his thumb against my bottom lip, grazed his teeth along his, and hesitated a moment before walking out, closing the door behind him.I fell into my chair.Id barricaded his advances all week and it suddenly hit me how exhausting it was.The moment I dropped the barrier, he turned my knees to gelatin.Id have to figure out how to avoid that from happening again.I didnt need pent up sexual frustration at the workplace.I had enough of that every time I thought about Brian.I mean Ryan.Whatever.You know what I mean.The train ride home was uneventful.I read some of the manuscript changes Michael had delivered to Yolanda earlier that day.I couldnt help but feel like there was something missing in Michaels writing.Something didnt quite click.It was fantastic writing and he deserved the accolades hed received but I just couldnt put my finger on what was wrong.I shoved papers back into my bag.Maybe I needed time away from it.Plus, every time I read the damn thing a new word that was obviously spelled correctly but looked so damn wrong popped out at me and I spent what seemed like an eternity staring at it, questioning its very existence.I hung my bag on my shoulder and got off at the next stop.Wrapping my scarf tighter around my face, I walked the two blocks back to my apartment.On the way, Ryan texted me.Running late.Murphys @ 9.Rain check on dinner.Sorry.That sucked.I was starving and I wasnt especially interested in returning to Murphys.Not that I didnt want to see Brian, but just that if I was going to be there with Ryan, I didnt want to be distracted by the butterflies that swarmed whenever I was around him.Sliding my key into the lock, I was met with Sarah and Melody, who were parked at the kitchen counter, full glasses of red between them.Hey!Pour me one.I placed my bag on the floor and threw my coat over the stained arm of the couch I called my friend.Dont you need to get ready for your date?Sarah grabbed a glass from the top cabinet and poured me some wine.Rain check on dinner.Im supposed to meet him at Murphys at nine.I took a long swallow.The alcohol warmed me to my toes.Thanks, I said, raising my glass.I needed this.So what are we doing for dinner?Melody asked, riffling through our stack of take out menus.I thought you had a date with Nick the Dick?I did but were playing it by ear.He isnt a dick, Care.I just had a moment.All women have crazy moments.Crazy?I think you were a step beyond crazy.Finishing off the bottle, Melody replied, Dont judge me.I was born to be awesome.Not perfect.And besides, you should talk.Werent you in a relationship with that couch for a few weeks?Ha ha.Shut up.Sometimes even I question my sanity.Occasionally it replies.And smacks me across the face.I threw a balled up napkin at her.Dude!You almost spilled.Dont commit a party foul just because your date got put on hold.So.I hopped up and opened the fridge.What are we going to do for dinner?Im starving.Why dont we just go to Murphys?They have great sandwiches and their French onion soup is to die for.I turned and closed the fridge.I guess we can do that.Why not?I have to meet Ryan there later anyway.Let me change my clothes.Be ready in five.Care, I want to borrow something to wear.I came straight here from work.Sure.Come on.Dont worry!Ill just sit here and keep the wine company, Sarah yelled through the apartment.Melody ran back to the kitchen, grabbed her glass, and met me back in my room.So how was work?I asked as I stripped off my shirt and walked to my closet.Oh, you know.Were all falling into financial ruin.The economy is going to collapse and only those with stockpiles of gold and bitcoins will make it through the apocalypse.You know, normal stuff.Sounds like fun.It will be.What do you want to wear?I dont know.Im hoping Nick will get off work early.What does he do again?I asked as I riffled through my closet, throwing everything that caught my eye on the bed.Hes in a band.I froze and had to mentally talk myself out of a sarcastic response.A band?I closed my eyes and hoped I didnt sound judgmental.Yeah.He plays guitar.Thats cool.I finally collected myself enough to face her.We should go see him sometime.Maybe.Melody held up a burgundy long sleeved, low cut cashmere sweater.Hows this?With your boobs?It will be perfect.I do have great boobs.My plastic surgeon is a genius.Look, I know Nick isnt anyones dream man but Ive had enough relationship lemons thrown at me that I now know when to grab the tequila and salt.She unbuttoned her shirt and threw it on my floor before pulling the sweater over her head.Stepping over to my full length mirror, she turned to the side and sucked in her nonexistent gut.Good?It looks great.I wish it covered my ass a bit more.Not everyone can have a tight butt like you.She walked over and slapped my ass.Good genes.Should I wear this?I held up an off the shoulder baby blue tunic sweater.It was fuzzy and soft.Kind of like jammies.Didnt we just talk about your ass?That will cover it up.Ryans already seen my ass.Besides, Ill keep on the jeans and I can flip it up if I think he forgot what it looks like.True.I like it.Care!You got a text message.Whos Michael?Sarah called through the door.Michael?Melody raised her eyebrows.I opened the door and grabbed the phone.Looking forward to next Saturday.Dont forgetwear a dress.You have great legs.Michael.Ill need at least another two or three drinks to explain about Michael.Lets go and I swear I will fill you two in at dinner.I want your perspective anyway.Why does he want you to wear a dress?Where are you going?Hes an author.Theres a dinner.Lets get out of here.I need to eat.That bad, huh?Sarah whispered.Um, yeah.That bad.FourteenAt six thirty on a Friday night, Murphys was packed for happy hour.Brian was busy behind the bar and when he turned and noticed the three of us walking in, he stopped mid martini shake and winked.Dinner or just drinks?he shouted over the din of people in work attire.Both!Sarah shouted back.I would have answered but I was momentarily awed.Who knew so many arm muscles flexed when shaking a martini shaker?Hold on!I have a table in the back for special guests.Special guests, huh?I bet hes sending us to the back so he can check out your ass.Not funny.Im meeting up with Ryan later.At least you remember his name.Thats not funny.Its a little funny.Dropping my shoulders, I acquiesced.Yeah, I guess youre right.We followed one of the waitresses to the back of the bar, and off to the corner was a huge table for ten.It was just secluded enough to avoid most of the asshattery that was par for the course in a bar on a Friday night but close enough to the pool table to still feel like part of the crowd.Drinks?Two bottles of Cab.No problem.Specials are on the board.The girls had their noses stuffed into their menus.I was starving but for some reason my attention was on the bar.There were two bartenders to keep up with the drink orders.Brian had his sleeves pushed up to his elbows and I noticed the bar towel tucked into his distressed jeans.I watched as he hopped up on a stool and reached for a bottle on the top shelf.Our waitress was standing off to the side talking to a customer with our two bottles and three glasses on a tray.Im having the French onion.Like I said, its so good.Melody leaned back and stretched her arms over her head.Chicken Caesar salad.Sarah folded her menu and pushed it off to the side of our table.I hadnt even looked at the menu.I picked it up quickly, but not before catching the two exchange a look.What?I dont know why you didnt just go for Brian to begin with, Sarah offered.He wasnt the target.I leaned back and crossed my arms over my chest.Maybe not.But he is hot.So?So?You havent stopped checking him out since we got here.Oh, please.Im just looking around for our waitress.Shes over there talking to some customer.Not sure what shes waiting for.Testy much?Im not testy.I think we still need to hear all about this Michael character.I second that!Melody raised her hand.The waitress came just in time to pour the first glass of wine.I suddenly felt like I needed the drink.I spent the next bottle and a half explaining Michael Mortimer.I described every come on, every subtle and not so subtle cue, and every reaction from Yolanda.By the time I was finished, I felt like Id told a life story, and the events were only from the past week!So, what do you guys think?You already agreed to go to the dinner thing with him?Sarah poured another glass as I nodded.And hes hot?Melody piped in.Well, yeah.But is that really the point?Yolanda and Mr.Little want me to go, anyway.Of course it is.Listen, Care.Melody leaned in.It was Serious Mel time.Take advantage of the opportunity.So what if this guys a weirdo?As long as hes a decent guy, what do you have to lose?Its not like youre promising him anything.Its a night out with a good looking guy.But hes a client!Sarah chimed in.That alone should keep her away.Caroline doesnt want to lose her job over this.Its like I told you, Mel.Your boss may be hot but, for one, hes your boss and, two, hes married.She ticked off her points on outstretched fingers.True.Both of you have valid points.I think, though, this dinner I agreed to would fall under work.Especially since my boss is sending me to represent the company.I mean, Michaels getting some literary award and if I accompany him to the event in the name of the house then I can chalk it up to work, right?Exactly.Be careful.My friends spoke at once.At the same time, a young guy stumbled in our direction and plopped down in the chair next to Sarah.Though he was dressed nicely, he reeked of alcohol.Hey, baby doll, he slurred, his eyes half closed, as he sidled up to Sarah.Way too drunk to have been drinking only during happy hour.Uh, hey.Sarah pushed his hand off her thigh.Melody leaned over and draped her arm around Sarahs shoulders.Whats up, buddy?Melody softly rubbed her nose along Sarahs cheek.Just hangin.Came over to see what you hot chicks are doing tonight.Her.Melody licked Sarahs ear.Sarah turned a lovely shade of crimson as she tried not to laugh.Oh, yeah.Im down with that.The guy leaned closer and his hand started kneading his crotch.Thankfully my stomach was empty or I would have vomited all over him.You might be but we arent.Im strictly into pussy.The way Melody overpronounced her p was actually kind of sexy.I emptied the bottle into my glass, sat back, and watched the show.The guys eyes widened as Melody caressed Sarahs breasts.Sarah was about to fall into a fit of laughter.Melody, on the other hand, looked as serious as a heart attack.Come on.Theres you, me, her.Its a no brainer.Wine actually came out of my nose.I busied myself cleaning off my face and tried not to break out into a hysterical fit of laughter.You know what else is a no brainer?Melody leaned in and ran her hands through his hair.What?Melody whispered in his ear loud enough for the rest of us to hear.You.Damn straight!He banged his fist on the table.I think he thought she was complimenting him.So, Melody continued as she licked Sarahs face, when the voices speak to you, do you poke them with cotton swabs?Huh?Horny butterface looked confused.There are some ladies over there whod probably be more into dick than we are.Melody nodded toward a gaggle of college girls.Why dont you go hit them up?Your cock wont get wet over here, baby doll.The guy looked over to where Melody directed him and plastered a huge smile on his face.Well, if you ladies change your minds, you know where to find me.He dropped his business card on the table and walked away.Hey!Melody called out to him.Yeah?Dont forget to be awesome, man!His face broke out into a lewd smile and, as he turned and walked away, the three of us broke into loud fits of laughter.What the fuck, Mel?Sarah snorted as she shoved her hand in her shirt, putting her boobs back into her bra, then grabbed a napkin to wipe off her face.What?As your best friend its my duty to always pretend to be your lesbian lover whenever you are getting hit on by an ugly asshole at a bar.Youre awfully convincing.Aw, Care.You jealous?Next time, its your turn.She wiggled her eyebrows and ran her tongue across her lips.Weirdo.The waitress came by with another two bottles and a martini glass with a pink drink, which she handed to me.Whats this?I lifted the glass, smelled it, and took a sip.Wet Pussy.I spit out the sip.What?The waitress looked bored.Yeah.Brian sent it over.Said you liked kinky drinks.So, you ready to order?Melody and Sarah peeked around the corner and waved to Brian, laughing hysterically.Well, uh, tell him I said thanks.Ill have the cheeseburger, medium rare.Fries?Huh?I was distracted by the view I had of Brians ass as he once again climbed the stool to reach the top shelf.Do you want French fries?Yeah, sure.Chicken Caesar salad.French onion soup.Ill be back with your orders.Enjoy your pussy.I am pretty sure that was sarcasm.It was Sarahs turn to spit out her drink.Oh my God, Care!Hes just being silly from the other weekend.I dont know.What time is it?I pushed to change the topic.Sarah looked at her phone.Seven fifteen.Why?Ryan wont be here until nine.So?So nothing.Just making conversation.I sipped my Wet Pussy.Sarah stared at me.So thats what our conversations are reduced to?Commentary of the comings and goings of who youre dating?No.Dont be an ass.Care, its Friday night.Relax.Party on, Sarah reasoned.I like to party, I mused.And by party, Mel interrupted, she means take naps.Shut up!I laughed.They were right.I needed to be less socially awkward.Thankfully, the waitress brought our food relatively quickly.I was starving.As I took a large bite of burger, Brian walked over, pulled out the chair next to me, and sat down.Whats up, ladies?Finally, the crowd is thinning out.I couldnt talk.I had too much food in my mouth.I couldnt even chew.I was sure a glob of ketchup, or mayonnaise, had made its home at the corner of my mouth.The juice of the tomato squirted onto the table.I averted my eyes, turned my head, stared wide eyed at Melody and Sarahanything to avoid the painfully embarrassing cavewoman display of my eating a cheeseburger in front of Brian.You okay, Care?Melody asked with a sweet smile on her face.I wanted to punch her.In the face.With a chair.Thats an awfully big bite.I didnt know that much could fit in there.Brian smiled at me.Good to know.My response was unintelligible and ended with a spray of hamburger meat on Brians shirt.I wanted to crawl under the table and die.No one likes a spitter, Care.Sarah pointed out.How lovely of her.I began to choke on my food.Brian smacked me on the back and laughed.Drink something.He poured a glass of wine from the bottle on the table and pushed it over to me before pulling out his towel and wiping his shirt.I shook my head, took a sip, and managed to melt the food small enough to fit down my throat.Thank you, I squeaked out.Anytime.So youre meeting Ryan later?he asked as he pilfered a fry from my plate.Yeah.How late are you working?Closing.Fridays are always busy.I can see that.Nice drink choice by the way.I nodded to my empty glass.You like that?I have plenty more where that came from, in case, you know, you need someone to help you pick up your target.He wiggled his eyebrows at me.It was official.I was going to die of embarrassment.So Brian.Thankfully Sarah realized I was sinking and rescued me.What do you do when you arent tending bar and passing along liquid sexual innuendo to our girl Caroline?You know, Im trying to give up sexual innuendos.But its hard.So hard.Thankfully my mouth was not full of cheesy meat when I laughed.If you leave the sexual innuendo door open, even the slightest bit, Ill come crashing through like the Kool Aid man, Melody quipped.Then remind me to always keep the door locked!Brian laughed.Youre pretty funny, Bartender Brian.Its a scientific fact that dirty talk and sexual innuendo are the strongest foundations of friendship.Melody was definitely on board.Anyone expert in dirty banter was tops in her mind.Then Im the best friend one could ever have.Having the ability to turn any thought into a sexual innuendo is a mark of the truly talented.Who knew, Sarah asked, the bartender was not only hot but fully entertaining?I just work here.I took it over when my dad died and left it to me.Its been mine about a year now.So youre Murphy.Yep.Brian Murphy, at your service.Look, the bars heating up again.Need anything, let me know.Ill stop back later.Oh, yeah, Ill be sending a few friends back here, too.Its my only reserved station.You ladies dont mind, do you?He looked at me when he asked.No.Not at all.The more the merrier.Melody looked happy.She was probably hoping a guy would come back here and rescue her from Nick the Dick the Guitar Playing Douche.As if on cue, three guys walked to the back table.Shouldnt you be working?A tall man with easy blue eyes and ruffled red hair high fived Brian.Ill send some pitchers over.Sit, the ladies dont mind.Another one of Brians friends, this one with dark eyes, stubble, and short dark hair, smiled.You must be Caroline.Im Dan, this is Drew, he said, pointing at the redhead, and this is Berk.Berk wore a cardigan, tight white T shirt, black jeans, and superthick black plastic frames.I liked him already.Nice to meet you.How do you know Im Caroline?I teased.Ryan and Brian talk so much about you, I feel like I could pick you out in a lineup.Stand up for a minute.I stood.Turn around.I turned around.Dan lifted my sweater a little bit.Yup.Its you.I stiffened and turned to face Brian.So youve been talking about me?Brian smiled.Well, I kept going on and on about your personality, then I realized how much of a bonus that ass was.Sarah snickered.We keep telling her she has a great ass but she doesnt believe us.Dan put his arm around my shoulders.Well, if you need reminding, just let me know.I feel its a public service I provide.And what kind of public service is that?Melodys eyes were shining.Maybe Dan would be the one to untie her from Nick.Well, pretty lady, Dan walked around the table and grabbed Melodys hand, I think its my duty, as a man, to point out the best features of all the beautiful women I meet.Gag me.Sarah and I rolled our eyes at each other but it seemed Melody was taking it all in.Thats quite a service you provide.And may I say, you fill out that sweater very nicely.I prayed that Melody wasnt falling for his lines.I cringed as she ran her fingers down into her cleavage and Dan stared like hed never seen tits before.Then she leaned in closer to him and said, You know, New Years is coming up.I think you should save your resolution till next year.You should try out being a douche for another twelve months.The entire table erupted in laughter.Dan was left with a smirk.Brian clapped him on the back and took off for the bar but not before whispering in my ear, See you later.Dan clutched his hand to his chest and fell into the seat next to Melody.Touch.Berk stole fries off my plate while discussing the latest in financial reports.Melody was interested in his thoughts considering she worked in that industry.I guessed Dan did as well, since he followed along.I had no idea what he was talking about.Sarah didnt look quite as bored as I was.She was deep in conversation with Drew the Ginger Haired Wonder.Something about him was very familiar, but I couldnt put my finger on it.By the time the second batch of wine and three pitchers were empty, it was a quarter to nine.Be right back.I grabbed my purse and headed for the restroom.Unfortunately for me, I bumped into Betsy the Whore and spilled her drink all down her what might pass for a dress if she were a middle schooler.I noticed she was with a group of her similarly dressed slut whore friends.Oh.Its you.I started to shrug past her but she put her hand on my arm.Im really sorry, Caroline.I dont really care, Betsy.I think you do.
