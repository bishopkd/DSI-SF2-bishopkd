A loud crash echoed through me and tore me from my restless sleep. My eyes fluttered open as I looked toward where the noise came from. A head popped out from behind a door and a smile appeared on the mans face. Sorry, he mouthed before walking over to the bed where I was laying. He was tall, maybe six feet, and bald but with brilliant blue eyes. He was shirtless and tattoos covered his arms and a majority of his chest. He was wearing rectangle glasses and black jeans that seemed to accent his body perfectly. I pulled the covers up to shield my naked body and gave a weak smile as he sat down on the bed next to me. Sorry for waking you up. He spoke in a soft voice, brushing the hair from my cheek as he spoke. I pulled my body into a sitting position and as I pressed my back against the wall I felt a shoot of pain in my back. I tried to hide the pain that rose in my throat but he must have seen my eyes wrinkle for he held his hand out. Let me see. He smiled and I sighed before leaning forward. Hows it look Doc? I smiled and put my hand gently into his. His fingers curled around mine and his other hand traced a circle on my back. The torn skin had been fine the night before but hurt slightly today. I just hoped it had stopped bleeding. It looks fine honestly. I can get you a cold pack if you want? He smiled and kissed my lips. I shook my head no for the pain was going away anyway. The large tattoo spread across my back was the largest piece I had gotten yet. It made my first tattoo look like an ant in the floor. It was a large pirate ship sailing across the ocean. Scrawled on the bow of the ship was Ohana, the hawaiian word for family. The night before I had gone into his shop for a tattoo. One thing led to another and here I am in his bed the next morning. I still couldnt believe what had happened. Only snippets filled my mind, his calloused hands holding mine, his lips sending shivers throughout my body and my hair pulled back into a messy bun. It had been four years since my husband had died and this was my first encounter that lasted more than a one night stand. I mean he was making me breakfast, that counts as more than a one night stand... right? He smiled once more, that handsome smile that you knew he had used on many women. Are you hungry? He got up and returned to the kitchen. Reluctantly I got up from the bed and only found his shirt so pulled it on. It landed mid thigh but at least it covered a majority of me. I rubbed my eyes and pulled my hair back before reaching the kitchen. Bathroom? I questioned and he pointed to the right where a small hallway was. Walking down the hallway were various pictures I could only imagine he had drawn. They were beautiful, elegant and colorful. By the time I reached the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror I practically fainted. I had eyeliner smeared all over my eyes, lipstick mushed around my mouth and my hair was everywhere. Seriously? I whispered and scoured the place for a brush. All I could find was a comb which made me giggle since he was bald, but hey it worked. Combing out my long brown hair was such a chore but eventually it was smooth and no knots occupied it anymore. I washed my face with the cool water from the sink and wished I knew where my purse was that had all my makeup in it. Figuring this was as good as it was going to get I walked back out to the kitchen to see him beaming with two plates heaping with food. The smell of breakfast filled the kitchen and I looked at the plates which were full of eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns. I took the plate from his hands and followed him to the dining room. The house was set up in a ranch style from what I could remember. When you walked in was a large open kitchen and living room. The living room had a centered sectional with a tv mounted on the wall. Various paintings filled the whole house, ones with woman, ones of random objects but mostly ones of colorful things that didnt quite make sense to me. As you walked towards the kitchen there was a small hallway that led to the bathroom on one side and a hallway that led to his bedroom on the other. The dining room was tucked next to the living room with a long wooden table set along the wall and a bar in the corner. The bedroom was huge, bigger than one I had even seen. It was as large as my living room for Christ's sake. A huge poster bed sat in the middle, a dresser sunk into the corner next to a walk in closet. I had lived in a trailer most of my life, a fancy trailer at that, but this was a lovely house. He could sense me looking around and a smirk appeared on his lips as he stopped me in the dining room and looked at me. Yes? I asked quietly as I put my plate down. Nothing. Just.. I am happy you stayed. When he spoke those words my heart sank a little. I knew how he felt, one night stands and they werent there in the morning had filled my life. Well you didnt kick me out so I figured I could stay. I smiled and took the seat he offered. God, he was such a nice guy, there must be something wrong with him. He had grabbed a tank top and threw it on before sitting next to me and eating his food. I picked up my fork and began to eat. Soon hunger absorbed me and I felt my stomach lurch as if I wasnt eating fast enough. He was a fast eater, finishing before me. His high cheek bones went up and down as he ate, his glasses resting on his small nose and his eyes peering over at me every now and then. I couldnt help feel my cheeks turn pink every time I caught his glance. I had a perfect life a while ago. I got married young, but I was so incredibly happy. I was with my husband for 10 years before he was killed by a drunk driver on the way to work. A car had passed through the strip in the middle of the highway and struck him head on. He was dead when the EMTs showed up. The day I got the news my world crashed. 10 years and it was over in a second. I was forced to sell the trailer and move into a smaller apartment. My dog was old at the time and she died a week later. My mother had died two years earlier from a brain aneurysm so all that was alive in my family was my father and my sister. Everything I ever loved was ripped from me in a second. Four years later and I was still working at a large retail store, Assistant Manager finally. He had always waited for the day I was offered that job. I havent been in a relationship or anything close to it since he passed. My life was full of one night stands and drinking myself to sleep. Something about this man felt different though. When I went into the tattoo parlor and he smiled at me, I felt something inside come alive again. I havent felt that in years. He held his hand out and we shook hands. He introduced himself as Rex. I still remember how it rolled off his tongue and I simply stood there and repeated his name before introducing myself, Anya. Did you sleep okay? He asked, crashing through my reminiscing. I looked over at him, the last bit of my breakfast halfway to my mouth. Yeah, did you? I smiled before finishing my breakfast and leaning back in my chair. He leaned forward and touched my hand with his before pulling me up from my chair and into his arms. I had an amazing night. That smile flashed again and I felt myself go a little weaker in his arms. Sometime within the past few minutes he had put on dance music and he now twirled me around his house. I did too. Do you usually have sex and breakfast or is that just me? I let out a small laugh as he twisted me around and back to his chest. Most of his tattoos were covered now but you could still see some through his shirt. Well not usually. Something about you is different. I frowned at that but his laugh rang out so it changed into a smile. Not a bad different, just different. A good thing dont worry. He now had one hand on my hip and the other in the middle of my back. Our bodies were so close, close like they had been the night before but we had clothes on now. His lips gently met mine and I felt myself melt into him. My arms wrapped around his neck as he pulled me tighter yet against him. I could feel his muscles flex as my body was pressed against his. Pulling away he brought his hand up to my jaw and stroked it in one slow sweeping motion. My skin prickled under his touch and I let out a soft sigh. So what is different? That you tattooed me first? Or do you bring all of your clients home? I raised an eyebrow and he gave me a look. A look as if someone had accused him of something he didnt do. I supposed that meant he didnt huh. Of course not. Usually I pick them up at bars. His laugh rang out again. It was a sweet, sultry laugh that kept you wanting more. So maybe that is what makes you different. His hands slid back around my waist and we were moving around the house again but this time in a more organized fashion. His lips were hot against mine and I could feel the need in them. I was lost in his touch and soon found myself pressed up against the wall. His hands exploring me and my hands exploring him. Our bodies were interlocked, needing each other badly in a way I hadnt felt in a long time. His body pressed against mine and I could feel him in every way, all the bad things seemed to melt away. He pulled away, taking his glasses off and looking at me with those bright eyes. They had turned into a stormy blue, with what looked like flecks of white in them. That was how his eyes had looked the night before, full of lust. It was only lust I kept telling myself. Just because he wanted to make me dinner and couldnt keep his hands off me didnt mean it was anything else. I touched his face, cupping it in my palms and could feel the cool sweat on his chin. He held my gaze for a long time before the noise of a phone interrupted us. It rang once, twice, before he let out a groan and pulled away. Dont move. He whispered in a hoarse voice and that flicker in his eyes stayed prominent. He tapped the remote at the music and it stopped mid song before answering the phone. Hello? Hey Freddy whats up? I fought the urge to move and sunk down into a nearby chair. My skin still felt hot from his touch, my cheeks burning up. He spoke into the phone, walking into the living room where I couldnt hear him. I noticed the flash from my purse and walked over to it. Lugging it up onto the chair I dug through it to grab my phone. 4 unread text messages, shit. I flipped through them, one from my sister, one from my friend at work and two from my boss. Texts from the boss are never good. The first one just asked if I filed some paperwork but the second asked if I could come in two hours earlier. That would put my punch in time at 10am and it was currently 9:30. I responded yes and began to search the house for my clothes. Come on, where did  I spoke to myself and remembered we lost our clothes in the living room. I raced out past him to the living room and found my shirt. Well that was a start. I grabbed it and ran back to the bathroom, finding my bra and underwear. Okay so where were my pants. Bedroom! I ran past him once more and he made a face at me. I threw my clothes on and walked out to grab my boots and he stood there with his hands on his hips. His eyes had receded to a gray color and he looked sad. I got called into work early. I spoke quietly and he ran his hand across the top of his head. I swear Im not leaving because I want to. If I dont go in my boss will kill me. I took a few steps towards where he was and touched his chest. I promise. I smiled and kissed him. At first he didnt acknowledge me but eventually after kissing him a few times he kissed back. What are you doing tonight? He whispered into my ear. My eyes closed involuntarily and I had to focus to think. Are you inviting me back? I asked hopeful. He laughed into my ear and kissed behind it. What if I was? His smooth voice whispered. I get out at eight. I practically cut him off as I leaned back a bit to look at him. His arms wrapped around me again and that smile lit up his face. I guess I will see you at eight? He followed me to the door and the sun was so bright compared to inside his house. It was dark and mysterious but outside it was almost blinding. He handed me my sunglasses and kissed me. When he pulled away I stayed still, missing him already. See you at eight then. I turned around and walked out to my car. It was sitting next to what I assumed was his car. Cadillac Escalade, the car I had wanted all my life. What the hell. As I got into my car I noticed he was standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame, one leg lazily crossed over the other and waving at me. Some one night stand. My car roared to life and I pulled out of the driveway looking at his house. I hadnt noticed it before but it was a charcoal color, a small chimney sticking out the left side and a garage attached to the other side. Wonder why he didnt use it? For the first time in four years, I felt something inside of me. I felt lust, curiosity and above all I felt needed. Somebody needed me and they didnt want to stop after just one night. They wanted to see me again. As I drove to work I was so happy, for one day I wasnt upset about the fact my husband had died, I was happy I could finally start moving on and finding someone else like he told me to do.           Work dragged on so slowly. Another manager couldnt make it today which is why they had wanted me in early. Thank god my best friend and co-manager Shauna was there today. She had been there through everything. She knew how my husband was about me finding someone after he died and how it was the same if I ever were to die. She couldnt believe I had finally found someone that lasted more than a one night. Rex? What an odd name. She giggled as we did our rounds. I mean you went from Brian to Rex. Plus he is a tattoo artist. That is pretty rad I think. You always make fun of the people I sleep with Shauna. I still felt a blush to my cheeks every time she said his name, I couldn't help it. We walked over to the fresh side of the store, meat department, dairy, bakery and deli. Every four hours or so we had to do a walk through to make sure the shelves were stocked and the coolers were keeping the correct temperature. I had barely had time to change into some black dress pants and a ruffle blue shirt before work. I had to pull my hair up into a bun for the lack of taking a shower. Our heels clicked as we walked towards deli. Shauna was wearing a blue dress with flowers at the bottom. She was super feminine compared to me. I preferred pants and she usually wore gaudy dresses and jewelry. So are you going to go back tonight? She asked, excitement in her voice. Do I really have a choice? I asked seriously. If I ever want to get into a relationship I have to try. Break down that wall. It seems way easier with him than anyone else. Do you think that is bad? I asked as I fixed some things in the deli case. No. I think its a great start Anya. Dont give up just yet. She winked at me and I smiled back at her. I wont give up. I owe it to Brian. We began walking again and managed our way over to the cash registers. The walkie sounded in my ear and I made a face. Go for Assistant Manager Anya. I spoke into it and a crackle erupted before I heard Can you come to the service desk? I will be there in a minute. I responded. We are being ushered to the service desk. Sarcasm dripped from voice as Shauna let out a laugh. We made our way over to the desk talking about Rex before I stopped dead in my tracks. Shauna. I whispered and pulled her back behind a candy display. Standing at the service desk was Rex. Shauna, Shauna. What? She asked urgently. Thats Rex. I whispered and she looked over at him. He was wearing black jeans and a band t-shirt. His tattoos seemed more colorful outside of his dark house, peeking out from the sleeves of his shirt. He was wearing his glasses and black sneakers with designs along the sides. Thats Rex! Shauna burst out and he looked towards us. I hid behind her and nodded. My face was pale white now. Well you dont need me sister. Go talk to him. I wonder what he wants. You are right though, he is pretty dreamy. She smirked and tapped my shoulder. I couldnt move. I felt frozen. Nobody has ever showed up at my work before. What? You arent helping. Tell him I am not here? She gave me a stern look and I knew I would have to talk to him even if she pushed me over there. I pinched my cheeks to get some color back and stood up straight. Are you coming with me? I asked and she nodded in an of course motion. We began walking over to the service desk and I let a deep breath out before seeing him. His eyes lit up as he saw me but he stayed where he was. Hey. I smiled and walked over, he pulled me into a hug and I felt myself relax a bit. What are you doing here? I kept a smile on my face but my eyes had a stern look to them. Well funny enough, you left something at my house and I figured I would return it for you. He handed me a gift card and smiled. Apparently it didnt fit right. He winked and my cheeks turned a bright pink. It was a new bra I had bought the day before, but he thought it made my breasts look small. It didnt stay on very long. I had changed before I went into his house and that was the first thing he said. I ran my hand through my hair and nodded nervously. Yeah.. This is my friend Shauna. I motioned to her but she had already disappeared, taking care of a customer over by register 3. Yeah. I whispered and could feel his eyes on me. I turned back at him and raised my eyebrows. What, I cant see your work? He smirked and went to touch my face but I looked away. Affection at work I never was okay with, even with Brian. I bet you have been here a thousand times, that is a horrible excuse. I smiled and dropped my guard a little lower. He had paid enough attention to remember where I worked, that was cute. Okay I admit it was a lame excuse. I had to get stuff for tonight and forgot to ask what kind of dinner you wanted. You never did give me your number so I figured why not stop by. Shit, I forgot to give him my number? What a lame one night stand that was on my part. Oh sorry. I smiled and held my hand out. Phone please. Anything is fine. I am not super picky about food. He reached in his back pocket and handed it to me. I briefly looked through his contacts and didnt see any Babygirls or Princess so I figured he wasnt seeing anyone on the side and it was safe enough to give him my number. I typed it in and looked up at him. Should I put Anya or something else as the contact name? Anya is perfect. He smiled and I typed it in quickly before handing it back to him. Shauna reached my side again and I looked at her. Nice to meet you Shauna. He held his hand out and she glanced at me for approval before shaking his hand. You too. She smiled and turned to me. I actually need you for a minute, sorry. I nodded and looked back at Rex. Be there in a second Shauna. I said as she walked away again. I have to go. I spoke quietly, avoiding his eyes. I have to.. yeah. Its fine. He laughed and kissed my cheek before I could pull away. Ill see you later. He looked at me and I matched his eyes with mine before he walked away. I took a deep breath, watching him walk and noticing he had an amazing ass. I smirked and shook my head before walking over to Shauna. Whats up? I asked and she smiled. No. What is that smile for? Oh my god Anya. He is really dreamy. You better not fuck this up. I rubbed my temples and shook my head. How did I know you were going to say that? I laughed and followed her as she began to walk. So what is up? Oh you are needed in electronics. Some crazy customer I guess and I really didnt want to take care of it so I said you would. What? Really? Come on. I gave her a glare and she just smiled back. We made our way to electronics but I kept feeling him around me even though he wasnt. I needed to get him out of my head.           My cell phone rang and 8:05 and I knew it was him. I smiled and picked it up. Hello? I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes, waiting for his voice. You havent left work yet have you? He asked intently. No why? I sat up in my chair and grabbed my purse before looking at the time. Five minutes late and he is freaking out? Can you pick up some milk? He laughed and I let out a sigh. I giggled and nodded. Yes. Anything else? God we sound like an old married couple already. I could feel him smile on the other end. Do you want 2% or what? Whatever you drink. That is all I need ol lady. I burst out laughing and made my way to the dairy department. I grabbed some milk and made my way to the checkout. So what did you make? I asked him and handed the cashier money. Walking outside the cool fall air hit me and I felt myself shiver. It was so warm and beautiful the day before, this cool air made it feel like it was winter already. Fall is the transition from spring to winter anyway. My hair blew out of my face as I made my way to the car and settled into the seat. Nothing special. He smiled on the receiver. I could hear his breath in the phone, steady and calm. But you can just come here if you want, unless you need to change. I am going to stop at my place and grab some clothes, then I will be over. The car turned over easily and I waited for his answer before pulling out of my parking space. Sounds like a plan. See you in a bit. Bye beautiful. My cheeks flared up and I whispered bye before hanging up. I text Shauna who had left two hours before me. He said bye beautiful. Pulling out of the parking lot I drove to my apartment and climbed the three flights of stairs and unlocked the door. My apartment was pretty plain, you walked into the kitchen, the living room to the right and the bathroom and bedroom in the back of it. It was all an open concept except for the bathroom and bedroom. I made my way over to the bedroom and picked up my wedding picture and kissed Brian. It had become habit ever since he had passed away. I opened my closet and dug through the clothing. I found a black strapless dress that was knee length and frowned. That totally says fuck me now. I threw it onto the bed and continued digging through the clothes. Eventually I found a black and white summer dress. I put it on and twirled around smiling. I went into the bathroom and fixed up my makeup before grabbing some heels and heading over to Rexs. I pulled into the driveway and it looked just as it had this morning. I had brought some extra clothes in case it was going to turn into a sleepover again. I turned the car off and made my way over to his door. I tapped it gently a couple times and waited. He answered the door in a kiss the cook apron and smiled. Come on in. I giggled and walked in, placing my purse and keys on the table by the door. Nice apron. He looked at his apron and then to me and shrugged. He was wearing the same clothes except the addition of the apron. I began to walk into the house and he held out his hand. What? Take your shoes off. Dont want you scratching up the floors. He flashed a smile and I did as I was told. I walked into the kitchen and it looked like a battlefield. My eyes went wide as pots and pans were stacked up in a corner, three skillets were going on the stove each with something different in them. The sink was on and the refrigerator was open. I put the milk in the fridge and turned the sink off. Grabbing a hand towel I threw it over my shoulder and grabbed the closest dirty pot. What are you doing? He whispered into my ear. He had come up behind me, his body pressed against mine. Helping? I said in a shaky voice. He pulled the pan from my hands and pushed me out to the dining room with protest. No helping. You sit. I am making you dinner. I got back up only to have his arms around me pushing me back to the table. You are so messy let me help! I laughed and he twirled me around each time I tried to make my way to the kitchen. No. Now sit! He pointed and I tried one last time but he wrangled me into the chair and kissed the back of my neck, leaving me breathless. Okay, I give up. I whispered. I closed my eyes and tried to think of what he was making. I could smell strong spices, rosemary and thyme. It smelled like beef but I wasnt positive. I hope he wasnt making spaghetti. That was the one thing I hated. I probably should have told him that though. A minute or so later I could hear him placing things on the table but I kept my eyes shut. I heard a cork pop and wine being poured into glasses. The strong smell of Sweet Red wine filled my nose and I could feel my lips curl up into a smile. Forks were placed next to the plates and eventually all noise stopped and he took my hand in his. You can open your eyes. I smiled to see his face. His eyes were a sky blue and he was smiling. Surprise. He sounded excited and I looked down at the food in front of me. He had made breaded chicken breast, fried asparagus and mashed potatoes. It smelled heavenly. It looks delicious! I giggled and leaned forward to kiss him. He kissed back quickly and picked up his glass. To a two night stand. I made a face at him but he only winked in response. Our glasses clinked and I took a sip. Sweet Red. He definitely knew me already. Only dessert wines for me. I looked down at the plate and swiped up some potatoes. They were light and creamy, unlike anything I had ever tasted before. I smiled over at him and watched him eat. Quite the cook. He looked up from his food and shrugged. My last.. thing was a cook. I guess I just got it from her. He hesitated before saying thing and I raised an eyebrow. Thing? I asked and blew off the steaming chicken before popping it into my mouth. Yeah. I was dating a girl from Australia. The corner of his mouth turned up a little. But that didnt last long. Long enough for you to be a pretty good cook though. I sympathized with him. He nodded and looked up at me. What about you? When was your last dating experience? I dreaded this question and took another swipe of potatoes. My husband actually was. He was killed by a drunk driver four years ago. I gave a half hearted smile but kept my eyes down on my plate. This is as much as a relationship as I have had since. Its been drinking by myself or one night stands. My voice had dropped an octave and I spoke in a hushed whisper. His fork clattered to the table and he was next to me, pulling me against him. I had no idea. I mean I knew you had a bad breakup but I thought it was a breakup, nothing like that. Im sorry I shouldnt have asked. His chest was warm as I was pressed against it and I nodded. Its not your fault. I havent talked about it in so long it seems like it never happened sometimes. I feel like I am just going to wake up and him and the dog will be laying there like it never happened. My eyes had begun to well up. He had pulled a chair over next to me and had his arm protectively around me. Its just so hard. One day everything is perfect and then a fucking drunk guy kills it. The tears rolled down my cheeks now. He tried to wipe them away but I turned away. I was ashamed that I had let my guard down enough to cry in front of him. He stayed still, I hoped it was because if he had tried to comfort me I probably would have pushed him away and left. Sorry. I whispered after composing myself. Im some lousy date huh. I gave a weak smile and he shook his head no. He wiped the rest of the tears from my face and kissed me gently. He kissed me full of comfort and pain. There was no longing this time, purely sympathy. Youre a perfect date. He whispered and I looked up at his stormy eyes. Dont worry about that. I nodded and turned back to my food. He bit his lip before returning back to his as well. I bit into the crisp asparagus and smiled. Asparagus is one of my favorite foods. I chewed it slowly and looked up at him. My dog used to steal them though. She was crazy. She loved green beans. He laughed and looked over at me. Green beans? Really? He asked surprised. I laughed as well, realizing how crazy this sounded. Really! She was such a silly little dog. Franny we called her. I looked up and he smiled a sincere smile. Have you ever had a dog? He shook his head no. Im not really an animal person. I suppose a dog would be nice though. I havent had any sort of animals in forever. Last time I had a cat I think, and her name was Betty. Some odd animal names huh? I smiled and took another bite of my chicken. After a bit of silence he started to talk. That girl from Australia? We were supposed to get married. But then she left me for her ex boyfriend. He said and I stopped eating. The hot chicken was burning my lips so I chewed it quickly and looked up at him. She was a bitch though. I thought that was the girl of my dreams. He pushed around his potatoes and looked up at me. Guess I was wrong about that. I frowned and looked up at him. She obviously wasnt worth it then. He smiled and nodded. I thought he said guess so but it was so quiet I could barely hear. I took another sip of my wine and leaned back in my chair. Are you going for a wine and dine type tonight? His face flashed back to life and he smiled. What if I was? You didnt seem to mind last night? My cheeks turned pink and I shrugged. We had finished our dinner by now and he got up to grab the plates. Let me help? You made me dinner. It is the least I can do. After a few minutes bickering over if he would let me help with dishes or not he finally caved. I kissed him and he held the kiss a lot longer than intended. We walked into the kitchen and the whole place had been cleaned up. Damn. You clean up nice. He snickered and brought the plates to the sink. All you have to clean is these plates I guess. Pity. He crossed his arms across his chest and I hit his shoulder playfully. I washed the dishes with his arms around my waist the whole time. He began kissing the back of my neck and pushed my hair to the side. I felt emotions rise up inside me and bit the inside of my lip. I closed my eyes and let out a slow breath. He slowly turned my body around and pressed his lips against mine. They were hot this time, unlike the last time we kissed. His large hands wrapped around my waist and twisted me up onto the counter. My legs quickly wrapped around his torso which pulled him closer still. He slid his fingers under the strap of my dress and slowly slid it down my arm and off. My skin prickled with sensation as he did so. A burning feeling was left where he touched. The top of my dress was around my waist, leaving me just in a satin bra that made my bust look bigger than last time. He looked down and raised an eyebrow at it before kissing me with more passion. I assumed that was a better bra. My hands roamed across his chest and under his shirt, pulling it up and off of him. It fell lightly to the ground and I caught his eyes looking at me. They were stormy, gray and blue clouding together. My body was full of shivers and want. I wanted him to touch me, to please me and to never stop. I could see his muscles beneath his sheer skin. I touched his chest, tracing the tattoos that surrounded it. There was a heart broken in two with vines coming from the center. A skull next to that with roses around the base. A word in elegant cursive much like my own, but it was in a different language so I couldnt figure out what it was. There were stars and tribal looking shapes covering the top left of his chest and onto his arm. A large ship was spread across his other arm. The waves seemed life like, wind in the sails of the ship and a cannon on the side. An elaborate masquerade mask spread the space in between the two other large tattoos on his chest. The mask had one eyeball colored black and the rest had a intricate design surrounding it. He had stopped kissing me and looked down at my fragile hands on his tattoos. What is your favorite? He asked me in a hoarse voice. I looked up at him and back at his tattoos. I traced my fingers around the snarls of colors. Vivid purples, dark stormy blues and neon greens filled the once pale chest. My brows knotted and then I stopped on the ship. That was my first tattoo. I just had it touched up which is why it is so colorful now. Why did you get it? I asked quietly. It was so elegant and detailed. From each small line in the mast to each sail made it look so lifelike. For my father. He was in the Navy. I smiled up and him and he leaned down slowly. Each tattoo has a meaning. He whispered against my lips before kissing me again. He pulled me up into his arms and we made our way to his bed once again. Everything was pent up within me. I couldnt wait for him to touch me. His touch was like drugs, making my body convulse against his. His body rocked against mine sending shivers up through my arms. My hair splayed out on the pillow as he kissed down my body. My underwear and bra fell onto the floor along with his pants. He felt my body relax under his as he slid into me. His breath was hot against my skin and I arched my back up against him. Our bodies twisted together, creating one. His hands were wrapped around me, holding me up against him as he rocked back and forth with precise motion. My mind let go, my body let go and I let go all at once. Succumbing to him. I scratched along his back and held him tightly. His lips never left mine unless I urged him to kiss my body. His skilled hands slid along my skin. My legs wrapped up around him. I couldnt hear anything but his breath against my lips. As he moved faster against me, my body reacted with his, matching its pace. We rocked faster, my body becoming delicate against his. Anything he touched sent a shock of pleasure coursing through me. I shook beneath him and him above me. We collapsed onto the bed, sweat on our backs and gasping for air. I closed my eyes and took his hand in mine, holding it tightly. Anya. He whispered into my ear. I pushed my body back against his and he wrapped his arms around me. Yes? I whispered. My eyes were closed. My body was still shaking, suddenly freezing. I reached for the covers and pulled them up around myself. Oh Anya. He let out a small laugh into my neck and I felt myself smiling too. It was amazing. He nuzzled into me and I felt myself slipping into sleep. Shauna was right, I better not fuck this up. I am loving it way too much. His arms were wrapped tightly around me and I felt safe. I felt safe and at home. Then the blackness of sleep overcame me.           Brian was running away from me. His black hair was blowing in the cold air. Brian! I screamed. He turned back for a second and then he was gone. I was in jeans and a sweater in the forest. It was black with white trees surrounding me. Brian! I yelled again, my voice cracking. I took off in a direction and found a river. The forest was making eerie noises. No, no no. Brian. Come back. I took off in another direction, pushing the trees from my view. Suddenly a cop was in front of me. Im sorry Mrs. Holt. Your husband has been killed by a drunk driver. No. This cant be. He cant be killed. I broke down in front of the cop, tears spilling from my eyes. Im sorry Mrs. Holt. Your husband has been killed by a drunk driver. He repeated. I fucking know! Go away! I screamed and ran past him. There were two cars, our black car smashed in and a red car. You asshole! I screamed through the tears and ran towards him. The cop stopped me from doing anything I regretted and I melted into his arms. He cant die. He is all I have. You dont understand. My head hurt from the pain, my heart had been ripped apart. No. No. My body fell into a hole. I just fell for what seemed like forever. Falling through space and time. Anya. A voice called from the blackness. Anya, its okay. It sounded familiar. It is not okay! I screamed at the imaginary voice. I have lost everything. Everything! Something touched my shoulder and I turned but I was still falling through the hole. Everything. I repeated before closing my eyes. Anya, honey, wake up. I bolted up and looked around. I was in Rexs house. Tears had streamed down my face. I was breathing heavily and his hand was on my shoulder. Anya? Are you okay? It was just a dream. I felt like my chest was being crushed. I couldnt stay here. Not next to him. Yeah, I need a shower. I spoke quickly and got up from the bed. I heard him call something behind me but didnt stop. The tears had begun to fall once more and eventually I made it to the bathroom. I felt my stomach lurch as last nights dinner made its way into the toilet. Disgusting. I climbed into the tub, curled into a ball and turned the hot water on in the shower. Water streaked my skin as my body erupted into a crying fit. A knock at the door made me turn my head. Please go away. I called to him. I saw the door sag as he leaned against it. He opened the door but I pulled the shower curtain around the tub so he couldnt see me. Please go away. I repeated and I heard the door close. I hadnt had a dream about Brian in three years. Why now? Why when I finally found someone that made me happy? I sat under the water for as long as I could, thinking. My skin began to turn pruny so I climbed out. The mirror showed what I figured it would. My eyes had lines around them and spots underneath from crying. I took a deep breath and wrapped a towel around myself. I couldnt help but smile at the black towels lining the only bright room in the house. I opened the door hesitantly and looked around for Rex but couldn't see him. I took a few steps from the bathroom and hugged the towel closer. I hope he didnt leave because of me. I noticed a note on the kitchen table and picked it up. His writing was scrawled on it. Went to the store, be back in a bit. xo. I smiled a little and nodded. I threw on my clothes and ran out to the car to grab my other clothes. Once I changed I sat on the couch to wait for him but after 15 minutes or so I decided to look around his house. I hiked on my boots and pulled my peacoat on for it was getting cold outside. I went outside and looked at the garage, pushing the door open. Inside was an old car, I couldnt say what year but it was old. It looked like he had been doing some work on it. There were parts strewn across the garage. I noticed different things like spark plugs and tire gauges. I wasnt that good at cars, I couldnt even change a flat tire if you asked me to. I walked further back and noticed a picture of him and a girl with blond hair. They looked so happy together. There was another picture of them kissing. I smiled and wondered if she was the Australian girl. Was he working on this with her? I heard a loud clang outside and walked out to the door to see his car pulling into the driveway. I waved and he smiled back at me. He climbed out of the car in the same sort of outfit as the night before. Sorry about that.. I said quietly, I felt so embarrassed. He just shook his head and smiled. He pulled me into his arms and kissed me, taking me off guard. Well hello there. I smiled and kissed him once more. He looked over at the car sitting in the garage. I figured I would look around. Are you working on that? He walked into the garage and ran his hand across the hood of the car. I was once upon a time. I lost track of time. I havent worked on her in oh what, years? I followed him inside and watched as he grabbed the pictures and pushed them into a drawer. You should work on it again. I would love to drive it. I crossed my arms across my chest and smiled at him. Im no good at cars but I love a man who knows cars. I giggled and he looked up at me. I could feel the tension that this car brought about with him. He must have worked on it with her. What kind of car is it? 1972 Chevy Nova. I was restoring it for my dad. He walked back over to where I was and looked up at me. His eyes were a pale gray. No need to work on it now. He took me outside and pulled down the garage door, shutting the car out of his mind. What are you doing today? He asked as he walked over and hugged me. I was shocked for a bit before hugging him back. I have work at twelve. Today is orientation. Managers favorite day. I made a face and his face lit up. What? I questioned. Nothing. I have to go to the shop today. He smiled and I couldnt help but laugh. Dont laugh. He took my hand and we walked into his house. I know you have to go soon but I want you to come back tonight. I havent even been in my apartment in days! I laughed and he wrapped his arms around me before twirling me around. Okay, we can go to your place then? He raised an eyebrow and I put my hand on his shoulder. I suppose that would work. I really need to go to work though. He made a whining noise but then leaned forward. I could feel his breath on my lips as he hesitated before kissing me. I smiled against the kiss and looked up into his stormy eyes. Do you want to come to my place tonight then? I get out at ten? That sounds like a plan. This was beginning to be his catch phrase and it certainly was catchy. Ill see you tonight beautiful. He smirked. I smiled and grabbed my stuff before going out to my car. On the way to my apartment I still couldnt believe how long it seemed we had been together. We had only been together a few days but it felt like months. My emotions were finally calming down and I could feel myself relaxing around him. I didnt feel the need to make up excuses to leave. He always wanted me to come back. I made my way to my apartment and looked at the state of it. There were clothes thrown everywhere from when I had gotten ready to go to his place. There were dishes in the dishwasher and a makeup explosion in the bathroom. I quickly ran around and tidied the place up before making my way to the bedroom and grabbing some clothes for work. I slipped the black dress pants on and a white blouse. The apartment finally looked alright and I ran out to my car. The engine sputtered before finally turning over. Thats odd, its never had to worry about that before. I shrugged and pulled the car out of the parking space and drove to work. The traffic was plain today, the sun was bright in the sky. A smile poured across my lips. The leaves were beginning to change color. There were bright yellows and dull oranges splitting the bright blue sky up. Leaves had already begun to fall and littered the highway. The sun was high in the sky but a cloud covered most of it up. I pulled into work right as the sun decided to free itself from the nuisance cloud. Of course work was bustling with activity, when was it not? I made my way through the crowds to the back room where the managers offices were. Shaunas bright face looked at me with wide eyes. What? Im only like five minutes late. I said in a quiet voice. Yeah but orientation has started. I had to cover for you! She pushed me into the orientation room and before I could stop there were five people staring at me. I ran my hand through my hair and waved. Hello all. I am Assistant Manager Anya to do your orientation. I gave a half hearted smile and took my seat around the circular table. Attendance first? I questioned myself and looked at the sheet. Kain? I looked up as a short, stout boy with dark brown hair and hazel eyes raised his hand. Nice to meet you. Cody? Cody was a tall redhead with green eyes, lanky almost though for his body seemed to tall for his proportions. I gave him a quick smile and moved on. Krystie? A brunette raised her hand and I smiled at her. She was what we referred to as Barbie Girls. They only worked so get money for clubbing and makeup, or so we thought. Barbara? Looking up I met eyes with an older woman, probably in her 50s. She had graying hair and was a little heavy set. Nice to meet you. Last is Kevin. I looked around and a man held up his hand. He looked to be the same age as me with salt and pepper hair mixed in with his black hair. I nodded a smile at him and opened the large binder that contained all of the necessary papers. Shall we get started then?           It had been eight months since I had started seeing Rex. More of my life was consumed by him but it was also a much happier time. He had visited me at work numerous times and I had been at his work so much that he had changed it around a bit. I also met his best friend Octavius. At first I kept calling him Oscar because that is what I thought Rex said, so they made fun of me. Hey, it happens right? Octavius was a broad man with many muscles. It was obvious he worked out every day. He had spindly brown hair that sat along his shoulders but he usually had it pulled back into a ponytail. He also had intricate tattoos like Rex, a majority of them were across his back though. There were a few other tattoo artists in Rexs tattoo parlor but they were in between areas so none of them were permanent. The parlor had been totally redone since I showed up, new couches, new paintings and even the check in desk had been totally redone. Other than Octavius he didnt seem to have many friends. I heard of one that Octavius was joking around about but nothing much. I had assumed it to be the girl from the pictures in the garage.Our lives pretty much continued like normal, we occupied his place more than we did mine. He had offered to buy me a car when mine broke down but I couldnt take that kind of affection. Eventually the engine went in my little Volvo and I had to cave and let him buy me a car. He said Do you want the Escalade or another car? Of course I wanted the Cadillac but I couldnt say that. He ended up buying himself a truck and letting me use the Escalade so in the end I got what I wanted. Work had been going well, everyone from orientation had been working out. Krystie had been a pain like we thought she would have been. She constantly would bug Shauna and I about the other workers in her area. We had placed her in deli for she had previous training. Eventually I had to move her into bakery so she would shut up. I was sitting in the managers office with my eyes closed. It was a large office with various computers and chairs spread around in an oval. My purse was sitting up on the counter, the computer open to my current call outs. I had been so exhausted from everything Rex wanted to do. He wanted to go see movies, bring me out on special dates, go to the theme park, go to the mall and every other cliche date you could think of. I felt a tap on my shoulder and straightened my posture. It was just Shauna. God you scared me. I whispered. She took the seat next to me smiling. Late night with Rex ey? She raised an eyebrow and I made a face at her. Rex and I were officially dating and Shauna never let me forget it. Anyway I am having a problem with Krystie again. Will you talk to her? I groaned a little and rubbed my temples. She was definitely what I did not want to deal with right now but I nodded and pushed myself up from my chair. What is she doing now? I turned around to see if Shauna was following me and she was right by my side. Well the usual. Complaining about everything and I have just about had it with her. She doesnt listen to me or do what I say. So big manager, talk to her? I rolled my eyes a bit as we walked. Shauna had been there longer than me but lately I could tolerate less than her. If there was a problem I took care of it right away. She was a calmer, more composed manager than myself. We walked over to the bakery and I let out a sigh. Dont just jump in there but.. yeah. Shauna patted my shoulder and disappeared. Krystie was standing there, her hand on her hip. What now? Her voice held a hard tone to it. It stopped me in my tracks for a minute. Excuse me? Do you talk to all your managers like this? I finally had made my way over to her. She just brushed her hair from her face and back up into her hairnet. Krystie if you expect to work here you cant disrespect people like that. She held her hand up and I stopped. Sorry, just having a bad day okay? Her voice still had a razor blade edge to it. No. I pushed her hand down. You cant do that. Next time, youre done. You can leave. Nobody is keeping you here. That must have got her for she looked up at me in pure horror. Ever since she had started she had been a problem. Either she complained about the hair nets that were required to be worn in fresh areas. Then there were the gloves that didnt fit her perfect. She was just a ball of annoying everything. Now she had broken down, just for a minute, and looked like she would cry. Deal Krystie? She simply nodded and turned back to the cake she had been decorating. I began walking back towards the managers office when I heard my name on the walkie. Go for Assistant Manager Anya. Can you dial 180? I picked up the phone and punched in the numbers. All I got was a garbled response before I heard Shauna say that I needed to go to jewelry. Couldnt you have just said that into the walkie? I laughed and she hung up before I got a response. I made my way over to jewelery and there was Rex. It was like every time I saw him now my stomach had butterflies, my heart skipped a beat and an acoustic song filled my head. He had serenaded me numerous times since we had begun to date. Each time his voice got stronger yet more soothing. He had a voice of an angel, I swear. Hey you. I giggled as he walked over to me and kissed me. Since being with Rex the affection at work thing had subsided. He made me feel calm and so I just let it happen. His arm wrapped around me and laid in the small of my back. What are you doing? Well you are out in... He looked down at his watch. Ten minutes? So I figured I would pick you up. Oct wanted to go out for drinks tonight. Does that sound okay? Drinks with Octavius had become a natural thing. We would got out every now and then, usually he had a different girl every night. Yeah that is fine. Let me go grab my stuff okay? I took his hand and pulled him along with me. The way the store was set up, all of the fresh departments were on the left side and everything else was on the right. Home supplies, dishes, electronics, anything you can think of. In order to get to the managers offices you had to walk past all of the fresh areas. His hand stayed entwined with mine as we walked. So today we had this crazy lady getting a tattoo. She wanted it on her foot and I told her that is painful but she was like its fine. She couldnt even finish the tattoo and it was wicked small. He began laughing and I felt myself smile with him. If I felt that my job was crazy I would just listen to his horror stories and be glad I was in retail. And then this guy... He trailed off and came to a stop. We were standing outside of bakery. What babe? I questioned but he seemed to be in a daze. When I turned my head to look at what he was looking at it was Krystie! She waved her hand at him but he stayed still. I looked between the two of them, confused as ever. She must have been a past one night stand? Then Krystie pulled her hairnet off and had the nerve to come over to us. Rexy baby! I havent seen you in years! She wrapped her skinny arms around his neck and he hugged her tightly. Tighter than it should have been in my opinion. I took a couple steps back. Maybe they were just best friends and I had never met her before? Krystie. What are you doing here? He asked and she turned her head to look at me but kept her body against his when it hit me. The blond from the photographs in the garage! I didnt notice it before because she had turned brunette and her face had been turned in the picture. Oh shit. Was she trying to take what I worked so hard on? I couldnt confront her on property time so instead I turned on my heel and briskly walked away. Anya? I heard Rex call out but I just kept walking. I cant believe that she had been there the whole time and I didnt even recognize her! I turned around for a second to see Krysties arms around Rex again. He didnt seem to be too upset about it to me. I rushed into the managers office, thank god Shauna was there. I slammed the door shut and she bolted up, her eyes wide. Whats wrong? She ran over to me as I began to lose my composure. This cant be happening. Why does something always get ruined? I asked as I took a couple deep breaths. What Anya? She asked confused as I sunk into a chair. Krystie is Rexs ex. I spoke the words slowly and clearly. Shauna practically fell down, her seat caught her but barely. I never noticed it before. She just like attacked him. He didnt even look like he felt bad about it. Then my phone began to ring. I looked down at the number and it was Rex. Oh Anya. That bitch really? She smiled and I could tell she was holding in laughter. Shauna this is horrible! She then began to laugh and I felt myself smile. Sister, I think if he was with her he probably got sick of her just like we did. I let myself dwell on her statement for a minute. Makes sense. I smiled and looked over at her. You always make me feel better. She pulled me into a hug and for a second it felt alright. How would I know later I would be in his arms again? Can you sneak me out? I dont want him to see me and I bet he is still in bakery. She nodded and grabbed her coat, a smile still plastered to her face. We slowly made our way back out to the floor. I pulled my jacket around myself and threw my purse over my shoulder, keys in my hand and ready to hop into the car. I glanced over to bakery but didnt see the meddling pair anywhere. I still cant believe it. Shauna whispered and I pulled her to the right, noticing Rex standing where we were headed. Why her? I mean we thought she would be good when we hired her but then she was awful. Do you suppose she sucks in bed? A giggle escaped both our lips as we made another drastic turn. The isle was open so I could see if anyone was near. I noticed Krystie off to the right so Shauna and I practically ran past her. That was when I heard it. His beautiful voice calling me. Anya? Anya where are you going? I bit the inside of my lip. If I looked back I would stop. I glanced over at Shauna just as she mouthed go. Shauna had stopped. When I looked back I saw her talking to Rex. His face was plain and solemn looking. I knew this was my chance to run away. I booked it out through the front doors and into the Escalade. I looked over at the door before turning the key in the ignition and roaring onto the main road. Krystie? Of all people? What the hell. The highway seemed lonely tonight. No stars were shining brightly like they usually did. Even the music on the radio couldnt help my mood tonight. It felt like when my husband had died. The love shattered and this horrible sinking feeling filled that void. Eight months and he could just go back to her in a second. Oct said they had a bad falling out but it didnt look that bad to me. Breaking my thoughts was the sound of a siren. I pulled over to the side to watch two firetrucks zoom past me. Somebody died. I whispered as I always did when I saw fire trucks or ambulances. Once they flew past my sight I merged back onto the highway. There were only a couple of cars out tonight so I didnt feel the need to speed like I usually did when I was driving this beast. I pulled off on exit 5 towards my apartment. The streets were quiet and then suddenly bustling with activity. I slowed down and noticed a bunch of people in the streets. What the hell? I asked. I took a right and decided to go the back way to my apartment instead. This way was a lot better but as soon as I got close enough to see my apartment I realized why everyone was in the road. Engulfed by flames stood my apartment building, crumbling in front of me. My mouth gaped as I slammed on the brakes. The fire was licking the sky as it crawled across the small complex building. The building held a total of four apartments, stacked on top of each other. The top floor had already been completely demolished and my apartment was currently set on flames. No. I whispered and got out of the car. I started running towards the wreck but a police officer grabbed me. No! I screamed at him and he just tightened his grip. First the guy I thought I was falling for fucked me over, now my apartment is on fire. No. I whispered and my body crumbled onto the ground. Slowly the policeman let me go. I looked up at him realizing he was the man Kevin we had hired back at orientation. Kevin? I whispered in a hoarse voice. He knelt down next to me. Anya? Is this your place? Man Im so sorry. His face looked sincere. What happened? I whispered. My hair was blowing around in my face. This smoke was rising and wafting out in all directions and I could smell the sickening smell of my life burning. Electrical fire on the top floor. At least everyone got out. I looked up at him, my eyes hollow and my skin growing pale. Its okay. I didnt expect him to pull me into an embrace but that is exactly what he did. I wasnt sure if it was because I looked so homely or because he knew what I was going through. I pulled away and wiped the stray tears from my face. This sucks. I whispered and he nodded, standing up. He held his arm out to me and I took the hug. Thanks. You need to get yourself to a hotel. Ill let you know what happens okay? Your place is which one? The one currently on fire. I whispered. He glanced over to the massive red and orange blur of flames and nodded. It probably wont make it. He said in a hushed voice. The spray from the fire extinguishers were finally showing up against the massive burst of fire. I nodded and turned around, climbing back into the car. Thank you Kevin. I smiled and he nodded back at me. I never turned the car off when I had gotten out of it so it was still purring when I closed the door behind me. The fire had me transfixed. I grabbed my phone without looking at it and pushed the green call button after pushing a few different buttons. It rang a couple times and a breathless voice answered. Anya? Anya I am so sorry please dont get mad at me. It is a long story. I promise I will explain. Anya? His voice washed over me as I stared at the fire consuming my home. My apartment is on fire. I whispered and at first he didnt respond. The police say it wont make it. It started in the apartment above me and now it is slowly working its way down. My voice cracked on the last few words and his breath stopped on the receiver. Where are you? He asked into the phone. I could hear the clanking of keys and him rushing around the house. Anya? Are you at your place? Let me come get you. I have the car. I will be there in ten minutes. I spoke in a calm manner, the fire still sucking my focus from me. Bye. With that I hung up the phone and took a deep breath. I let it out slowly and turned the car around and headed towards Rexs place. I need a drink. I whispered to myself. The ride there was the quickest drive I had encountered in a while. When I pulled in the house was dark, only one or two lights were on. The first person I saw was surprisingly not Rex. Octavius car was parked next to Rexs. Oct was sitting on a chair outside the place, cigarette in hand and smoke escaping his lips. I turned the lights off and switched the engine off. I just sat there in the car, unable to move as the slow realization sunk into my bones. I have no home. No stuff. Nothing. The dark mass of Octavius rose and went inside. I felt my head fall slowly onto the wheel of the car. I closed my eyes and just let myself relax a little from the stress welling up inside of me. The door opened and the car chimed. Anya. Rex whispered and touched my shoulder lightly. I leaned back in the chair and turned my face to him. Oh my Anya. He touched my face. I had ash in my hair and a smear on my cheek. I didnt notice this of course until he told me. Come on. I followed him inside wondering where Oct had gone. Where did Oct go? I whispered looking up at Rex. He just smiled and shook his head. No need to worry about that. He brought me to the bathroom and turned the shower on. I could feel the steam from the hot water pouring into the bathroom. He touched my cheek gently and kissed my lips. I stayed lifeless and turned my head away. He still hadnt explained but I really didnt want to know now. Krystie was ruining everything. Good thing I had tomorrow off. He had plenty of time to explain. He touched the bottom of my shirt and slowly lifted it off of me. I looked down at it, black scarring the once white shirt. I stood up and he undid my pants in a caring motion, unlike any kind of way he had before. They fell off and he turned me around and urged me towards the shower. Ill be outside okay? I will make some tea. Do you want raspberry? His voice was calm, no anger consumed it like it did my own. I closed my eyes and nodded. I heard him step out of the room as I opened my eyes. I removed my bra and underwear and stepped into the burning shower. I curled up and sat down in the tub. The water poured over me and I felt my body relax. I looked down at the black that was filling the water. The ash that had singed my hair was working itself loose. I let out a sigh and let the water fall down my body. Each droplet released a small sense of stress. I closed my eyes and saw the fire, engulfing what I had made my home. They would most likely rebuild it but I dont know if I could live there again, knowing it could go down that easily. An electrical fire? What an odd way to take down a whole building. I heard Octavius voice outside, deep and masculine. Rex replied but I couldnt hear them. Their voices garbled from the water streaming down my face. I smoothed my hair down and heard the tea kettle go off. I turned the shower off and looked down at the dirt that had once been on my body. I had stayed away from the fire, far enough that I could have barely felt the heat from it and still I was covered in evidence. I grabbed a towel and noticed clothes on the toilet. I grabbed them and smiled. It was a grungy t-shirt that obviously belonged to him and a pair of my jeans I had left over long ago. I pulled the clothes on and threw my hair up onto my head before taking a couple of steps over to the door. I put my ear against it and listened to the two of them talk. Well I mean what do you think she would do? She is working with Anya. That is ridiculous I mean she is taking this way too far. You guys broke up big whoop. Just because she is in the Tainted doesnt mean that she can just do that. Octavius spoke to Rex. The Tainted? What was that? I pressed my ear closer to the door to listen to Rexs soft voice. I know. I would be pissed if I was Anya too. But I mean thats Krystie for you. That is how she always acts. Maybe Anya just doesnt know that yet? He sighed heavily and they both became quiet for a second. She must be done. The water is off. Shit. I totally forgot about that. I pushed the door open and looked up at the two of them. Octavius smiled at me and Rex just looked like he was upset. I ran my hand through my hair and leaned against the door frame. The tea ready? My voice was hoarse, I couldnt figure out why. Oct brought me a cup and winked at Rex before leaving the room. I held the warmth in my fingers feeling it spread through me. The shock of getting out of the bathroom always left my skin cool. Rex took a few steps towards me and tipped my head up to look at him. Im sorry. He whispered before leaning close to me. He didnt touch my lips but closed his eyes and rested his forehead against mine. I had no clue she was working there. I didnt want to hug her, god she is like the plague. She always shows up when I dont want her to. His eyes opened and he looked at me. They were a dark gray, the blue wasnt even visible within them. I nodded and bit my lip. Its okay. She is in the past though right? She isnt just going to show up and demand you back? His face lit up when I said that. I felt a smile creep across my lips as his pressed his against mine. In the past. You are the present. Nothing else. He whispered into my ear as he pushed a stray hair away from my face. Promise? I whispered and felt myself falling into him. He always had a way of making me calm, it washed over me and I was helpless. Promise. He was stern this time, meaning it. Carving it in stone and giving the stone to me. I nodded and wrapped my arms around his back. My face fell into his chest and rested there. His chest rose and fell silently as his arms wrapped around me. What am I going to do about my place? My voice cracked and I held him tighter against me. I have lost everything. I dont even have clothes anymore. Dont worry about that. You can stay here. I shot him a look. Only until you find a place. He smiled and smoothed my hair down. My trust had still been broken a bit from the Krystie thing. I wasnt so willing to just move in either but I didnt have a choice. We can go shopping tomorrow okay? You have it off right? I can have Oct do my tattoos. I dont want to cause a scene. I bet Shauna can bring me. I looked up at him, his eyes a fiery blue again. He leaned down and I let him kiss me. His kiss was full of warmth and love. He slowly slid his hand around my neck and up into my hair. I didnt want to kiss him at first, still angry, but eventually I couldnt stop myself from kissing him back. He smiled through one kiss and pulled away. Now we cant make out cause Octavius is here somewhere but hold that thought. My cheeks flushed and I nodded. Are we still doing drinks? I questioned and looked down at my outfit. Not really bar worthy but it was all I had left. Rex shook his head no. Just a movie and dinner kind of night. Is that okay? I nodded and hugged him tightly. Thank you. I whispered. He kissed the top of my head. No thank you for coming back. My eyes closed and I felt at home again.           The sun played on the sheet and my eyelids, beckoning me to wake up. Rolling over with a groan I found myself smushed up against Rex. I pushed myself up in the bed and smiled down at him. He was asleep, his face at ease. He had fallen asleep with his glasses on. I took them off gently and frowned at the red lines they had left. Oct had left around midnight and I practically passed out once he left. Rex had said he would read until he fell asleep. Now in a sitting position I could see the book on the ground, sprawled out. I reached over Rex and grabbed it, constantly checking to see if I had woken him. He was a rough sleeper, let me tell you. The book was an old, brown leather bound book. The pages were stained and creased from dog earring the corners. I flipped through the pages and frowned at the writing scrawled across the pages. It was written in cursive rather than typed. I flipped to the middle and began reading.  Joan is on trial. I went to a man today to talk about seeing a God who might be able to save her. If I can just convince him maybe he will understand? The man said that I can meet him Saturday, it is Tuesday now so maybe if she can just hold on until then? I hope so. She is the only family I have left.  I felt a shiver go up my spine and realized it was Rexs hand. I closed the book and let it slip back onto the floor. His face lit up when he saw me laying across him. What are you doing? He smirked. Oh nothing. I pulled myself back and got up from the bed, making my way to the bathroom. I looked at myself in the mirror and frowned a little bit. I had wrinkles starting from being so upset last night. I pulled the skin taut until they disappeared but alas when I let go they reappeared. Sighing I left the bathroom to see him standing outside the door in his boxers. Hey hottie. I giggled and kissed him. God you are so beautiful. He whispered into my ear and I fought the urge to fight back. I had learned he did not like being told he was wrong so I pretty much had to let him compliment me all the time or he would get cranky. When is your first appointment today? I asked kissing under his chin. He wasnt that much taller than me but when we hugged he could put his head on top of mine. I swear either he grew or I shrunk. I thought we had been the same height when I first met him. I told you I will have Octavius take it today. He looked down at me but my jaw was set. And I told you, Shauna is taking me. You are a really good tattoo artist, I dont want anyone denied that when they had an appointment. He raised an eyebrow and shrugged. I suppose. He reached into his back pocket to retrieve his wallet and handed me a card. I looked down at it confused and he laughed. Do you not know what a credit card is, love? Yeah but I can buy my own clothes... His mouth pressed against mine and he slid the card into my hand. Dont even start that again. I smirked and remembered we had had a bicker about who would buy me new clothes. If you dont use my card I will be pissed and tattoo some ugly thing on you in your sleep! I gasped. Some threat! I giggled and took the card. I suppose you can pay. Whats my limit? A new wardrobe and whatever else you need. No limit. I stood shocked for a second. This man is letting me spend whatever I want on his credit card? Yep, I got that right. I suppose if I try to fight you will tell me you have amazing credit and havent used this card in years? My eyes met his. Pretty much. He smirked and I rolled my eyes at him. The only clothes I currently owned were a couple band t-shirts and a pair of jeans. Reluctantly I threw them on and made my way into the kitchen. He was sucking down some coffee, still in his boxers. I got a few hours until my appointment, relax. He responded to my glare. I have to go. Shauna is supposed to meet me at the mall. I smiled and kissed him. He pulled me close and didnt let go for what seemed like eternity. Do you need anything? I whispered against his chest which I now found to be the most comforting space ever. If you want you can buy me stuff, but you dont have to. He ran his finger down my jaw line and I felt a shiver ripple through my skin. This is a shopping day for you remember. I nodded and kissed him once more before making my way to the car. My purse was light from lack of makeup which I conveniently left at home and then my home burst into flames. Add that to my list of things to buy. I hopped into the car and waved at him as he receded back into the house. I looked down at my purse and let out a little laugh. I cant believe he gave me his credit card. I pulled out of the driveway and made my way to the mall. My brain still couldnt wrap around the fact that my place had burnt down. I decided to make a detour and drive by it. When I drove by it was all closed, caution tape thrown everywhere. I could see what was left of my apartment, the bathroom was the only intact area. The living room and kitchen were completely demolished. My breath caught in my throat as I looked at the damage. I was parked in front of the building now, I could see where everything had fallen from lack of support. There were beams and appliances scattered across the front of the building with the caution tape surrounding it. I let out a soft sigh and had to redirect myself back to driving. I eventually made it to the mall, my head still spinning at what had happened the night before. I noticed Shaunas car and smiled as I parked next to it. I grabbed my purse and looked over at her, she was sitting on the hood of her car. That isnt very lady like you know. Men could see up your skirts. She just laughed as we walked into the mall. So he gave me his credit card. She let out a shrill laugh and stopped me. Seriously? No limit? She raised her eyebrows and I shook my head no. Does he have a friend? Damn. We both laughed as we walked through the mall. We went into a clothing store and I made my way to the back where the dress clothes were. Oh, I got you this. She pulled a picture out of her purse and handed it to me. It was my wedding picture I had kept by my bed. I stroked Brians face and smiled up at her. Thanks. She just nodded knowing that I didnt want to talk about it. Well I mean there is always Oct. I smirked and grabbed a few pairs of pants and began looking at shirts. Octavius. She said in a deep voice. He sounds like a soldier though. He kind of is a whore though. I mean every time I see him he has some other bimbo.She made a face at me as I grabbed a black dress. We made our way to the fitting room and tried the clothes on. I mean that is good though? He trusts I am not going to spend a lot of money, or if I did spend a lot he doesnt mind paying it off? I looked out of the dressing room but didnt see Shauna. Shauna? A red and black lace lingerie set was thrown in my face. What is this? I exclaimed and took it. Well I mean you need to say thank you somehow. Why not this way? Her lips were twitched up into a smirk. I hesitantly looked at it. It did look nice. There was a lace bra, very thin, with puffy white feathers lining around the bust. The thong attached looked the same, each with a design of black ribbon. Come on. Do it for him. She snatched it back and threw it into the cart along with the other clothes we tried on. Letting out a deep sigh I caved. Okay. But that is it. I swallowed quietly and looked over at her. Did you see the apartment? It is horrid. She nodded as we walked through the store to the checkout. I cant believe that lady on the fourth floor did this! Well I mean it isnt her fault but it came from her apartment. Do you need to stay over? Shauna asked looking at me intently. No. Rex said I can stay there. She laughed a little and hit my shoulder. I am going to try okay? I have been there a lot anyway. Okay. You better not... Fuck it up. Thanks mother. I cut her off and smiled. We had reached the cash registers and our things had been rung through. I hesitated at the total price and gave Shauna a look. She nodded and I slid the card through it. Thank you Rex it chimed and asked for a signature. I signed his name effortlessly. Already forging his name, how great. Shauna smiled and we put our clothes into the cart. Where to now? I asked looking down the long hallway of the mall. We had made our way into the makeup store, the department store for bedding and such, three more clothing stores and a mens department store. What about this one? She held up a black button up shirt. I put my hand to my chin and shook my head no. He is super picky. We were trying to find an outfit for Rex. We were supposed to go out to dinner in a few days and I had a bunch of clothes so I wanted to get him an outfit. We had found some major cute black faded jeans, green converse and now we were debating on a shirt. I grabbed a sweater vest and held it up. I could tackle him into this one? Wouldnt he look cute? I looked down at the blue argyle sweater. He wasnt one for color but maybe he would let me put him in color. I threw it into our pile and smirked. My phone began to ring and I picked it up. Hello? There was a shuffling noise on the other end and then to my surprise Octavius voice filled the other end. Hey its Oct. I was wondering what you guys were doing tonight? I need to talk to the two of you. Nothing I can think of. He said he had a few appointments and that was all. When is his last one? A shuffling of papers filled the receiver once more and he made a clicking noise with his tongue. Two. Okay. Let him know I called alright? Yeah no problem. I hung up the phone and Shauna stared wide eyed at me. Yes that was Oct. His voice is so sexy! I cant believe you havent let me meet him yet! She exclaimed and I glanced at the time. We should go huh? Yeah, I have to tell Rex we have to go to Octavius place. Oh well. Want to help me bring this to the car? She nodded and we made our way to the car. The trunk popped open and I filled the whole trunk with bags. I cant believe I bought all this stuff. He is going to kill me. He said you had no limit. I doubt he will kill you. She smiled and hugged me. Ill see you tomorrow okay? I nodded and climbed into my car. By the time I made it home Rex had already beat me. His car sat in the driveway, steam still escaping from the hood. I only took a few bags in so he wouldnt be mad at how much I spent. I opened the door and threw the keys into the bowl. Babe? I called out and set the bags on the floor. Im home. He walked out of the bathroom and smiled at me. Hey. you. He was wearing camouflage cut offs and shirtless. I was beginning to love how he never wore his shirt. His tattoos always shone so brightly in the dim lit house. I noticed a new tattoo on his side, the skin still glistening and wet from just being done. He noticed me looking at it and held up his arm. Scrawled across his ribcage was To err is human. I like it. I smiled. He nodded and wrapped his arms around me and gave me a kiss. Yeah? I thought it was pretty good. He glanced down at the bags of clothes and then back up at me, pure horror on his face. Shit I bought too much! That isnt all you bought right? If that is all you got we are going back out right now. No I got more. I smiled and he raised an eyebrow. I promise! I squealed as he picked me up. Oh my god put me down Rex! Dont drop me! I clung to his body and squeezed my eyes shut. I swear if you drop me youre dead! A low guttural laugh escaped his lips as he walked around and plopped me on the bed. I opened my eyes as his lips swooped in and pressed themselves against mine. Our bodies connected and slowly I let myself fall back onto the bed. In between kisses he was talking to me I realized. With a low noise from me he repeated them. Did you have fun? I nodded in between kisses. Oct needs us over asap apparently. He called me while shopping, it must be dramatic. I smiled and he nodded. His large hands slid their way around my waist and hoisted me up against him. The breath left my body as our bodies touched. I shifted my hands down along his tattoos, tracing them like I so often did. I accidentally touched his new one and I felt him stiffen alongside me. Sorry. I whispered but before I could speak again his mouth was on mine. I felt myself surrendering to him, completely letting go. One hand slid down my leg and up my inner thigh. My body was suddenly filled with shivers. I could feel the hair on my arms stand on end from the sensation. His kisses were growing deeper, more concentrated. His tongue was playing alongside mine and slowly working its way down to my neck. His teeth drifted along my skin to my collar bone. The phone began to ring. I let out a small gasp as his teeth bit down on my skin. I went to reach for the phone but he grabbed my wrists and held them above my head. He looked up at me, his eyes stormy but vivid. I stopped trying to get free and closed my eyes. My hair fell down around my shoulders and his lips returned to my neck. Small noises escaped from me, I had no control but I didnt want control either. We danced around each other in a way I hadnt experienced before. He would touch here and I would feel it there. He would whisper one thing and I would hear something else. It was intoxicating, breathtaking. I let out a whimper as he filled me, made me whole again. I always felt tears well up in my eyes and the breath caught in the back of my throat from the feeling of being wanted and loved. I had realized this was love, not lust. Lust fades out and love doesnt. It had been eight steamy months filled with so much passion that it made up for the four years of lacking that. Here I was, wrapped around a man I had been searching for forever. A man to fill that void that filled me. He spoke into my ear, his voice rough but my body ached for it. Everything about him I wanted, needed. He let out a low groan and I felt it coming soon, this moment in time I wish I could just pause and live in it forever. The feeling of him within me, of his arms around me, his lips against mine and the emotions rising within me. I came first, moaning loudly as I buried my face into his chest. I scratched down his back and felt him follow soon after. Our bodies hefted together, sweat stained our backs and foreheads. I felt at peace, relaxed and above all completely happy. He rolled himself off me and pulled me close against him. I laid my head on his chest. I love you. I whispered but then realized was it too early to say that? I had been so caught up in being happy it had just escaped me! I love you too. He said after a seconds hesitation and I looked up at him to make sure he meant it. His eyes were a violent blue and he kissed my forehead. I love you Anya. He repeated and I felt my body fall into a state of sleep, blissful sleep.           Octavius had a huge house, more like a mansion. It was set back from the road with a iron wrought fence. The massive structure lifted off the ground to reveal four floors. There was a large red door with various studs lined across it. There were four steeples stretching up the sides of the house with a huge stained glass window at the top in an oval shape. It was just a bunch of splashes of color, nothing distinct. It looked like one of those eerie mansions from a horror movie to be honest. The siding was cracked and some pieces needed to be redone. Surrounding the windows were what had once been window boxes but only two remained. Each steeple had a large circular window on it and three windows in between all spread out. If that makes you worried dont keep reading. The inside was worse. Rex took my hand and we walked up to the large red doors. They looked like they were made of felt. Oct opened the door and hugged Rex. He was wearing a white shirt with blue paint splattered all over and jeans that matched. Repainting? Rex asked but was only responded by Octavius deep laugh. His voice in general was deep and masculine but his laugh was even deeper. Dont even let me say hi to the lady, just comment on my attire? What kind of behavior is that Rex? I was pulled into a hug. I reluctantly hugged Octavius back. He gave me a look and then looked over at Rex and whispered something to him. What? I crossed my arms across my chest. I had changed into a long black dress with one strap that went behind my neck and across my chest. This is what he told me to wear! I exclaimed hoping I wasnt wearing the wrong thing. Octavius just laughed and motioned us into the house. Did I wear the wrong thing? I asked looking at Rex. He was wearing the outfit I had bought him earlier. No it is perfect. Oct just isnt used to seeing women dressed up. He leaned in close and whispered into my ear. He is used to seeing them naked. I couldn't help but stifle a laugh. Rex wrapped his arm around me as I gaped at the house. When you first walked in there was a magnificent staircase winding up towards the second floor. The railings were carved and there was a bright red runner that went up each side of the staircase. Massive paintings filled the walls like in Rexs house. The largest painting was one of a soldier. He had black hair about shoulder length and what looked like the beginning of a beard. His body was extremely buff, his arm looked like it had a large gash in the side of it along with a tattoo spiraling down it. Next to it was another large painting, but this one was of some sort of whale. Both paintings were mesmerizing but eventually Rex pulled me away. We followed a long hallway that opened up to a ballroom. I looked over at Rex with an eyebrow raised. The ballroom was a huge open area with three chandeliers hanging around the ceiling. The ballroom looked like what I would imagine a palaces ballroom would be. The floor had an interesting design on it. The middle had a large mask much like the one Rex had on his chest. That looks like yours. I spoke quietly and looked up at Rex. Its a long story. Dont worry. We walked through the middle of the ballroom. The lights dazzled above us. I felt like a kid in a candy store, this place was beautiful. There were multiple hallways branching off of the ballroom. We took one that had a carving of a mask over it. The other ones had random objects, a circle with a star on the inside, a fish, a ring and a fire. I squeezed Rexs hand tighter as we ascended towards some stairs. It was a spiral staircase, the ones that usually make me feel dizzy. We went up the stairs which opened up to another large room. There was a Persian rug splayed on the floor, two couches back to back and a row of chairs. There were five people sitting around in a circle. I recognized Krystie immediately. She had cut her hair shorter and dyed it black but I knew it was her. They all shouted hellos and Rex and I sat down next to Octavius at what I assumed was the head of the table. There was a small man sitting across and to the right of me. His face was oval with hazel eyes. He had black hair that reached just above his shoulders. He was wearing a baggy white shirt and tight black pants. He had a small nose and almond shaped eyes. Next to him was Krystie. Next to Krystie was a girl dressed heavily in goth clothes. She had black baggy trip pants, a black wife beater and a shirt on top of that that was made of fishnets. She had straight black hair and choppy bangs. Her eyeliner elongated her eyes, making them look catlike with brilliant blue eyeshadow. Next to her was another girl, small in stature but taller than the goth girl. She had plain brown hair longer than mine. Her skin was pale but her eyes were a magnificent sea foam green color. Last in the group was a tall man with olive skin. He had high cheekbones and a chiseled jawline. His brown hair just barely graced his eyes and he had a goatee. I looked over at Rex for some explanation but he simply smiled and looked over at Octavius. Hello and how are all of you doing? Octavius began. Most of them nodded and I looked around the room again. I could feel their stares on me and I shrunk back in my chair. Please welcome Anya. The goth girl waved but everyone else stayed still. Hi. I whispered and looked around the room. Krystie looked unimpressed with me as she crossed her arms and leaned back in her chair. Well Anya, this is the clan. That is Haku, Krystie, Cleo, Violet and Enrique slash Gabriel. I raised an eyebrow at Enrique but he shook his head. You will see eventually senorita. He winked and spoke with a thick Spanish accent. I nodded and smiled a friendly smile at him. This is The Tainted and we are immortal. Rex said calmly next to me. It took me by surprise and I laughed out loud. I bet you are. He looked at me with a stern look and I stopped speaking. We all have our stories and I have been with you long enough now that I want you to know about my real life. He turned towards me and took my hands in his. I am immortal. I can not die. I looked around nervously, everything inside me was bustling with questions. Okay so he was immortal? So you are telling me I am going to grow old and die and you will stay this age? It was the only question I could fathom together to ask. I saw Krystie out of the corner of my eye laugh. That is if he stays with you. Octavius shot her a death look and she silenced. Okay... How does one become immortal? My voice squeaked at the end. It was too much to handle so I was taking it one step at a time. Why did he want to do this is front of everybody? Couldnt he have told me at home? I was so frustrated and upset with him and holding it in. It was the goth girl who spoke next. Im Cleo. Come with me. She held her hand out and I looked hopelessly at Rex. He nodded and smiled. I took her hand and we walked down to another room split off from the group room. It is hard to think of, I know. It will be okay though. Rex has never brought any of his girlfriends here before so he must really like you. She seemed extremely bubbly despite her goth demeanor. So I dont understand. Immortal? There is no such thing. You die and life moves on. I spoke quietly. The group had begun talking up a storm, no doubt deciding a better name. The Tainted? What did that even mean? Well it is a long story and we each have our own. Do you want to hear mine? She smiled and her eyes seemed to sparkle. There was a bench in the far corner and I walked over to it, sitting down and letting my brain process this information. I nodded to her and she began. Well my mother was Cleopatra. That is why my name is Cleo. She giggled and I gave her the strangest look. Cleopatra? She died forever ago, no way this girl could be her daughter. Anyway, so she was married quite a bit, and this one time she fell in the wrong hands and got pregnant. A lot of people wanted her dead though so she had to keep it hidden that she was pregnant. Once she had me there was a priest who found out and cursed me. Her voice had risen with excitement. She was happy she was cursed? What the heck. I was cursed to live the life of immortality, to see my mother fail. To see empires rise and fall. You must understand we all stop growing at a different age. I am the youngest in the group and Octavius is the oldest. She was the youngest looks wise. She barely looked 17. That is my story. I am sure everyone will tell you theirs in time. Be careful of Krystie though. I looked over at the group through the open door and noticed she had taken the seat I had been in. What is her beef? I looked back at Cleo and she was laughing. They used to be something. When Krystie first came to Tainted they thought the other was amazing. Then he realized she wasnt. She is just an arrogant brat who thinks she can get whatever she wants. She leaned in closer and whispered to me. She really hates that you took him. She then burst out laughing. I nodded quietly, still processing everything. So he is going to watch me die isnt he? I said in a shaky voice. Well there is two things he can do. If you do love him you can become immortal but you will be his. If you were to not love him you would die no matter what age you are. Or he can become mortal, leave this group and live his life starting at the age he is. What age is he? Really old. He looks 32 though. That is what he tells everyone. We lose count of our real age after a century or so. I nodded quietly and contemplated bombarding her with questions. Cleopatra. I spoke breathlessly. Yeah. She was one hell of a woman. She smiled a kind smile and looked at me. Dont worry I will keep you safe from Krystie. You always have to watch Violet. They are buddies. Their mothers are alike. What do you mean? Well I promised them I wouldnt tell you. She held up her hand in a scouts honor pose. Promise you wont tell them? I put my hand up without thinking and nodded. Well Krysties mom is Hera. Do you know who she was? She was Zeus wife. She was known for going and sleeping with mortals though. She whispered the last part. Violets mom is Eris. The goddess of discord. See how they are almost related? I nodded and looked back at the group. What is Octavius? Is he a soldier? Yep. His story is pretty messed up. His mother went to Ares, the God of War, to ask for the return of her husband who was in the army. Ares said that he would only help if she would devote herself to him. So she did and she ended up pregnant. Lets just say she didnt last long with the Gods and didnt see her husband again. I slowly turned my head over at her with a sad expression on my face. That is a horrible story. I whispered. Cleo crossed her legs and leaned back in the bench. I told you. She let out a long sigh. Do you want to know the rest of the stories? She asked eagerly and I nodded. Okay well. Her voice seemed light, bouncing around the room. Hakus story is kind of confusing. There are these things called Kappas. They are huge lizard like creatures. They are trouble makers but must be polite if you are polite to them first. So pretty much there was this woman who was Hakus mother and she saw a Kappa. She was a priestess so she knew what to do. She bowed and Kappas have these bowl looking things on their heads. If they bow and the water escapes they are stuck there! If someone puts water in it they have to practically be your slave though. She laughed and I nodded silently, fixated by these stories. So she filled it and yeah. They have a cute story. I looked back at the group talking with each other. I caught Rexs look and smiled at him. He gave a quick smile and continued with the group. Whos next? I felt myself saying even before I thought it. So Haku, Krystie, Violet, Octavius have been done so that leaves Enrique. He has a pretty long story as well. He had an older brother Gabriel, well half brother if you want to be specific. Gabriel was immortal, born from the God Mextli who controlled war and storms. Gabriel is the only person ever in time to die while immortal. Nobody knows how he did it, not even him. Wait. You just said he died so how would he be able to talk or think? I questioned. She raised her hand in approval. That is where it gets weird. When he died his soul connected with his brothers. Every now and then he will pop out and talk. It is kind of weird. You will be able to tell who is who though. Enrique is a total player and prick but Gabriel is wicked sweet. Her cheeks turned pink and her face lit up. She must have had a crush on him. Must be a pain he is stuck in Enrique huh? I asked and she shook her head. Thats all of them. She whispered. I cant tell you Rexs story. He will tell you in his own time. It took him forever to tell us even. How did you guys form a group? What does The Tainted even mean? I questioned and ran my hand through my hair. So many questions were filtering up through my mouth. We have an annual ball. It is tonight actually. She giggled. That is probably why he brought you. We seem to have an unnatural ability to find other Immortals. Unnatural? Being immortal was unnatural. We call ourselves the Tainted because our blood is tainted. Our blood has been mixed with Gods and mortals. We were going to go for an artistic name like Painted Gods, but Krystie didnt like it which meant Violet didnt like it. So we decided on the Tainted. We dont quite understand the limits of our immortality but it has something to do with our blood. If you become immortal it will run through your veins too. How do you become immortal? I looked over at her. Her face still shone with brilliance at all of the questions. At least someone would tell me. Rex had kept it hidden almost 9 months! There is a ceremony. You get a tattoo along with him. It binds you two together. I nodded and looked at the group. Each one had a visible masquerade mask. Is it the mask one? I looked at her. She was wearing too many long clothes to see hers. She nodded and pulled her leg up to reveal a mask on her ankle. It was painted black with a white eye in the shape of a heart. It was only half of a mask with a stick attached. Each person has a different one. I remembered Rexs on his chest. My mind was still spinning with questions, each one weighing differently in my brain. I stayed quiet for a moment still processing everything. Eventually I spoke in a quiet hushed voice. What happens if I wanted kids? The look across her face came off as confused. Many people I assumed didnt worry about that I guessed. They will live life normally. The only way for them to be immortal is a long process involving talking to the elders. She looked over at me, her eyes wide. Are you pregnant? You cant go through the immortal summoning if you are. No, goodness no. I smiled a reassuring smile. To be honest I had no clue. When was I supposed to have my period? That was the least of my problems as of yet. I looked over at the room and everyone was getting up and walking away. I stood up as Octavius and Rex walked into where we were. Thanks for taking care of her Cleo. He smiled and she nodded. No probs. I smiled at her as she left with Octavius. Rex took my arm and led me back to the bench. I know it is a lot to take in. Please dont be mad at me for not telling you. His voice was sincere, taking my mind off track for a minute. I dont expect Hey Im immortal on a first date.. I bit the inside of my lip. If that counts as a date. I mentioned. He laughed and took my hand in his. So I suppose she told you how this works? I looked up at him. His face looked so even and calm. I couldnt even spot a wrinkle if I stared. Oh maybe a little one off of his eye but people called those smile lines now. I couldnt take my face away from his and I nodded. Are you asking me to become immortal or are you going to join my side? I raised an eyebrow at him. He moved closer on the bench and brushed his hand through my hair. I dont know yet. Would you pick one if I asked? I bit the inside of my lip again and looked up at him. His stormy blue eyes were so bright they looked like they should be in the sky with puffy clouds surrounding them. I think I would. I dont know which one yet though. I held my breath and looked up to see satisfaction on his face. Would you though? His lips met mine and I knew in that minute he would. He would give up immortality to be with me. Either that or he would share an immortal life with me. I felt a tear slide down my cheek and his finger caught it before it fell off. No crying. This is supposed to be happy. He whispered as his hand wrapped itself around mine. I know. I said feeling childish. I am happy. Good. Remember I told you that you were different? He stroked my cheek and I nodded. I think its because I never felt this kind of love before. He leaned forward and kissed my lips ever so gently. I love you. I love you too. I smiled and noticed someone standing in the doorway. What lovebirds! Senorita why you no want me? It was Enrique. I smiled and looked at Rex for support. You want everyone Enrique! Enrique made a noise and left. Rex laughed and pulled me up into his arms. So there is this thing I need to tell you. He rubbed the back of his head. That there is a party of some sort and that is why you made me dress up without even telling me? I hit his shoulder playfully. Yeah pretty much. But you look amazing. He looked down my body and I felt modest. I crossed my arms and arched an eyebrow. You do. You must wear this though. He held up a black lace masquerade mask with butterfly wings on each side. I let out a small gasp as he took it out from behind his back. It is part of the tradition. Everyone must wear a mask. He pulled a mask down over his eyes. It was a white porcelain looking mask with black marks on it just like on his tattoo. Yours matches your tattoo. He nodded and his eyes seemed to sparkle through the holes in the mask. Everyone's match. You dont have one so I made one up for you. I touched the fragile wings, their colors electric against the black lace. Do you like it? He whispered closer to my ear than before he had managed to wrap his arms around me he pulled me close against him. He smiled and kissed me gently as I looked around at the other members. They had all dressed up as well and were wearing masks. Cleo was wearing a long black dress that had a very long train on it. Her mask looked identical to her tattoo mask. Her makeup was still heavy but her hair was down in small ringlets around her shoulders. Haku was wearing what I assumed to be a traditional Japanese outfit. He was wearing a white shirt with a long sleeved shirt over it but it was unbuttoned. There was a skirt looking piece also. It started white at the top and leaked into black at the bottom. His mask was bright blue with yellow outlining the eyes. There were Japanese symbols around the mask, none of which I knew well enough to know what they meant. His hair had been swept back and looked shiny but not a bad shiny. Krystie and Violet almost looked the same. Krystie had a bright red dress with a plunging neckline. The back was low also and formed a V shape. The red dress looked as if it was satin and hugged her body tightly. Every move she made the dress followed. Violet was wearing a dress that was deep blue with the same back but lace covered where her back would normally be showing. Krysties hair was piled on top of her head and her mask was bright red like her dress. There was an elegant design on one side yet the other side was plain. Violets hair was half up and the rest fell freely around her shoulders. Her mask was only half a mask, only covering one eye. It was splattered with colors, like someone had splatter painted it. Enrique had disappeared for a while but now returned with a plain white mask. It had a black border around it but that was all. He looked like a pirate to be honest. He had a ruffle white shirt on with tight black pants and black boots. He was also wearing a large hat with a feather sticking out of the side that looked like a Captains hat. I shrugged and looked up at Rex. He let out a low laugh and pulled me to the others. Octavius walked out of a distant room in a black tux. His mask matched Rexs but on the opposite side. My dont we all look lovely? Now remember the rules. Shall we go? His calm voice washed over me and I felt myself relax a bit. I still couldnt wrap my head around the fact that I was the only mortal in the room until I saw Shauna walk out and stand next to Octavius. My jaw practically hit the floor. Say what? She waved at me and smiled up at Oct. She was wearing a long pale blue dress with a long slit up the leg and only one shoulder strap. Her high heels clicked on the hardwood floor as she walked over to me. Dont even start. If you can sleep around so can I. She giggled and hugged me. I dont sleep around anymore. Octavius? Come on Shauna. I told you he is a player. I embraced her back and let out a soft sigh. Maybe that is what I want tonight. She whispered and squeezed my shoulders. Have fun. She walked back over to Oct and he took her arm in his. Dont worry about her. Rexs voice caught me off guard and I gave him a quizzical look. She will be fine. He pulled me alongside him as the group went down the stairs. About halfway down the stairs I could hear the pounding of music and the smell of alcohol mixed with food. My stomach gurgled and I realized I hadnt eaten much. As we walked down the stairs I held onto Rexs arm tightly for fear of falling in these damn heels. I wasnt one for high heels and of course that is what he made me wear. When I looked up the ballroom had been totally redone while we were upstairs. There were people swarmed on the floor and different colored lights streaming across the walls along with speakers. There was a large table filled with drinks and every type of food you could think of. Everyone was dressed up in formal wear and masks. Some people had elegant masks with various feathers protruding from them. Others had simple black masks. There were what felt like millions of people. The ballroom was filled with voices chattering and the deep bass from the music. I held onto Rex tighter as the group dispersed into the crowd. Just stay with me. I will keep you safe. He whispered into my ear. I nodded and wondered what kind of party this was exactly. This is a party for every clan of Immortals within the world. The Tainted is only one of many. He whispered and explained the differences in masks. Masks that were over the top with feathers or paintings meant that they were elders or they were the leaders of the group. Octavius passed and I realized his mask was much more intricate than I had noticed before which stated he was the leader. The plain black masks, or white, indicated they were the newest members in each clan. Enrique was the newest in The Tainted so his was white. As they grow with the clan they can add things to their mask and once they had been there for a while. I nodded as he whispered all of this in my ear. I didnt notice we had been dancing this whole time. His arms were around me, his breath hot on my neck. So what does my mask mean? I whispered looking at him. A smirk just appeared on his lips and he didnt talk for a while. We simply danced around the room. He twirled me around him, I was surprised I didnt step on his feet numerous times. He pulled me in close and I could feel his hands the bare skin of my back. It means you are mine. He finally spoke. It means that you havent chosen what life you will live but you are with me. Something about him saying that I was his made my heart skip a beat. It made butterflies in my stomach and I couldnt stop smiling. Maybe that was a rude thing to say, no one person is anybodys, but I am pretty sure it made me blush. His lips were on mine before I could respond and it felt like the world had stopped. The lights seemed to slow down. The bass from the music had melted into my heart and was actually my heartbeat. His hands soon found their way around me tighter, one up in my hair and the other resting in the small of my back. I felt a tap on my shoulder and reality crashed back into my face. I opened my eyes and looked to see who had tapped me. There stood Shauna, face bright red and eyes puffy. Shit. I need to talk to you now. She whispered and I gave a helpless look to Rex before being pulled away. He took a few steps towards me but Octavius stood in his way. I was pulled through the crowd and out a side door to a small garden. The garden was eerily quiet with hundreds of flowers sprouting up from the beds. There were two benches sitting alone among the tangle of flowers. She pulled me to one and looked up at me. This is wrong. We cant do this. Do what? I asked appalled to even think she was talking about anything important. Marry them. Or have them be mortals. That is ridiculous. Cant we just be people? Live in a normal life? What are you talking about? I cut her off. Marry who? What? Explain Shauna. Now. She tilted her head to the side, thinking. He didnt tell you. She bit the inside of her lip and cast a glance down at the ground. Tell me what? I urged and moved closer to her on the bench. Shauna what is wrong? You can tell me. Octavius wants me to be his. She said looking up at me. Her eyes were welled with tears and her cheeks had gone from a pink to a red. He wants me to marry him. I was shocked. Since when was she with Octavius! Whats wrong with that honey? That is fantastic. I smiled and pulled her into a hug. Im scared. He told me about what has to be done to be married. You dont have to marry him. Tell him you arent sure. I coaxed, hoping I was making her feel a little better. I rubbed her back and felt her sobs beneath my hand. Why was she so upset? Had she been told about this before me? A slow anger was swelling up inside of me. I had been dating Rex a lot longer than she had been with him. I let out a soft sigh and looked over at her. Her crying had stopped and her breathing more normal. You okay honey? I whispered and brushed her hair from her face. She nodded and looked over at me. Yeah. What about you? I was kind of taken aback by her question. I looked down at the ground and then but the inside of my lip. How long have you guys been dating? I whispered. We met just after you guys. He had come in for something and asked me where you were. Then it kind of just hit off. I didnt want to let you know because I thought it would be awkward. She paused for a minute. I guess this is more awkward huh? I let out a soft laugh and shook my head. If you are happy that is all I care about. I smoothed the wrinkles from sitting out of my dress and hugged her. No worries okay? She nodded and hugged me back. I could tell she was feeling better already but I didnt want to ask. Are you mad at me? She asked and I burst out laughing. Shauna when was the last time I ever got mad at you? I pushed her shoulder gently and she smiled. I noticed Octavius standing in the doorway. I think you should go talk to Oct. She looked up and her cheeks blushed when they met gazes. She got up and they walked off to a different part of the garden. God she was with Octavius? I still couldnt wrap my mind around it. That was the least of my worries, I still couldnt believe that Rex was immortal! What did that even mean? We had been dating for what seemed like forever and I had been living at his house now. I stopped looking for apartments when he would say everything wrong with each apartment. A smile spread across my face as I thought about him. I needed to focus. Immortal. The Tainted. Marriage. Things kept running through my mind. What if I had become immortal with him? I would live forever. I would have to stay his forever too. Would I be able to live forever? What if he became mortal with me? Would he even want to stay with me? So many questions evaded my mind. Would he even be mortal with me? Would he stay with me? At first I only thought about if our relationship would work. Now I had to worry about becoming immortal or mortal. We had talked about marriage a while ago. He asked what I thought about remarrying but I said I wasnt sure. I wonder if that was a real question or if he was wondering if he should stay with me. I played with the mask in my hands. I had taken it off when Shauna had brought me outside. I played with the feathers and frowned a little as I turned it around in my fingertips. The back of it had a small mark on it. I traced it and smiled as I realized it was Rexs mark. This was the mark he put on his drawings. It was practically his trademark. I felt the wind blow around me and a shiver rippled through my skin. I looked up an and older woman was standing in front of me. I slid my mask on quickly and looked back up at her. She was wearing a long red dress that was plain but hugged her body. Her mask was elegant with huge feathers tapering off of it. Her mask was many different colors but the middle of her mask was bright yellow. Im sorry. I whispered and stood up but her hand was on my shoulder. Sit down. She whispered and smiled. I reluctantly sat down next to her. She was an older woman, possibly in her 50s. She had short brown hair which was straightened and barely hit her shoulders. There were small lines extending from her smile and her eyes were a bright blue like Rexs. I havent met you before. You are with Rex, no? I nodded to the woman and gave her a quick smile. Do forgive me. I am Marjorie. I am the leader of the The Painted. I nodded and realized that meant she was a leader of another group. I straightened my posture a little bit and she laughed. The Painted? I questioned quietly and looked over at her. We are from England. She smiled and I realized she did have a prominent English accent. I guess I didnt realized that immortals could be everywhere. Painted. The Painted? Is there a reason of the name? I raised an eyebrow but it was covered by my mask. A smooth laugh escaped her throat. Lots of reasons but no need for that now. So you and Rex. Will you marry? My mind stopped and I looked over at her with a question in my eye. What did she just ask me? Well darling, he has been on the market for a while and needs a mate. You seem like someone who would make an amazing mate for him. My cheeks blushed and her laugh rang out again. Dont worry hon. It is a good thing. Just dont give up on him okay? Funny that is what my friend says. I whispered and she nodded. Just keep what I said in mind. I went to look at her but she was gone. How did she disappear? These immortals and their crazy ways. I readjusted my mask and made my way back into the house. The music roared through my head and wrapped around my body as I entered the building. The lights flashed in front of me and the crowd appeared. I made my way through the many masked party people until I saw Rex. He was surrounded by the group that had been upstairs earlier. Octavius had been dancing with Shauna, Enrique had been with Cleo and Rex was standing in between them. When he saw me his eyes lit up and he walked over to me. Hey baby. He whispered while he pulled me close against him. Where did you go? I rested my head against his chest as we rocked back and forth to the music. Shauna needed me. I am all yours now though. I smiled up at him as he kissed my forehead. I like the sound of that. All mine. He wrapped his arms around me tighter before resting them on my hips as we rocked back and forth. No matter what had happened earlier this is what I wanted. I wanted to be in his arms, forever and always. Forever.           The party swirled past me. Music filled the air and I felt my body relax next to Rex. The night was cold when we went out to take a breather from the music. It seemed like an endless night from the drinking to the eating to the dancing. My hair had turned into a mess, my makeup was running underneath my mask and Rex had sweat dripping down his naked head. He ran his hands through my hair and I could feel the alcohol buzzing throughout my body. My head was cloudy and I kept finding myself giggling at the stupidest things. The bass from the techno roared through my body and sent shivers through my arms. I felt him pull me against him and his lips were on mine. They were hot and full of love. I am not sure if we made it back home or in some random room in Octavius place. His hands roamed all over my body. His lips never left mine with a hot, passionate feel. When I felt his hands on my bare skin my body spun to life. I could feel the need within me and the love shooting out of me. I put my head back as his lips sent shivers down my neck. His lips left small kiss marks down my neck to my collarbone which he nibbled for a little bit as soft noises escaped me. My dress was soon on the floor and I fumbled around to pull his shirt off. His skin glistened from the sweat he had worked up. I forced myself to stop smiling as his lips found their way back to mine. Our bodies touched and I realized I had somehow managed to take off the rest of his clothes. When our bodies touched a spark filled my stomach. My head became a tangled mess of emotions as he touched me. His hands slid their way around my back and pulled me close to him. A moan rose from my throat as I felt his body snake its way down. His tongue glided down the left side of my body. His teeth bit at my hip as they rocked up towards him. I was in such a state of ecstasy. My legs opened voluntarily and his head went to the right place. I held the sheets until my knuckles were white. Rex. I groaned as he slowed down. When he felt my body shaking from the feel of him he began licking again. My back arched and I could feel my heartbeat in my throat. I couldnt feel my hands anymore and released the sheets as he made his way back up to my mouth after a few minutes. I eagerly began kissing him again, our tongues swirling around each other. I could feel he needed me and let him in. His breath was on my mouth, smelling sweetly of flowers and citrus. I scratched down his back as he filled me. The sensation was so pleasing I couldnt bear to hold in a moan. He echoed mine and soon I was sent into a different world. One where no one was ever sad and everyone was in love. It sounded silly but sometimes when it is so amazing you just feel like you have been transported somewhere else. His hands pushed mine above my head. Our fingers interlaced and soon it was over. Our bodies lay in a crumpled, overly satisfied mess. Our breathing was ragged and I couldnt feel anything. Anya. He let out a low moan in my ear and I felt myself smiling. I love you. I love you too. I whispered and wriggled my way closer to him. My head lay on his chest and he had his arms wrapped around me. He rubbed his nose against mine and kissed my forehead. I closed my eyes and just listened to our breathing for a minute before his voice broke in. I love you Anya. He kissed my ear. A lot. He whispered. A smile appeared on my face and I let out a soft laugh. Well I know that. But you dont know how much I love you. I have never thought about giving up immortality for anyone before. I havent even thought about being immortal with anyone. Nobody means what you mean to me. He stroked my cheek and I could feel the blush beneath his touch. I nodded and looked up at his stormy eyes. What is your story? My voice cracked a little as his I began to trace his tattoos again. Why did you join the Tainted? His eyes stayed a stormy color as he kissed my forehead. It is a long story. I nodded and smiled up at him, begging for the truth. He chuckled and nodded. Fine. He readjusted how he was sitting and I scooted closer to him, my eyes wide. My mother is the sister of Joan of Arc. You know who that is right? You people realize I went to school right? I took history. I grumbled and a smile broke out on his face. Okay, love. Anyway, if I wouldnt get interrupted all the time. She went to the Gods for help because Joan was on trial. She figured if she asked someone and told them about all the amazing things Joan did maybe she could get her out of the trial. Unfortunately it didnt work out that way. I was conceived and she trained me at a very young age to stay my own ground and taught me how to fight. There was a small group of children I went to school with and Octavius was in it. At first we hated each other, we would fight all the time. One day I hit him with a rock on the shoulder. It began to bleed but then healed up. We had no clue what it meant and when we asked our mothers they said dont worry about it. We figured out that the same thing happened to me. Eventually our mothers let us know what had happened. We werent normal children, we had a special power. Since we were the only two who had immortality we stuck together, vowing we would stay friends no matter what happened. We didnt hold back from living though. We ended up fighting in a war, I dont remember which one, I have been in too many. If we got shot it took longer for the wound to heal but eventually it would. We wanted to know what this unknown power was and that was when we met the other Immortals. There are quite a few different clans among the world but none in this area so we created our own. Over centuries we slowly formed our group, Haku, Violet, Krystie, Cleo and Enrique. I was so mesmerized by his story I didnt realize that sleep was slowly overtaking me. Why the Tainted? Who made that up? I asked sleepily and I soon felt the comfort of his fingers stroking my hair. Shh. Go to sleep baby. But I have so many questions! I want to know so many things. I whispered. You will have time tomorrow. I promise. I would give up my life for you. I spoke and nuzzled into his shoulder. I would give up immortality for you sweetie. I love you. The blackness overtook me and I knew this would turn into a nightmare. I saw Brian standing on a field. There was tall bright green grass surrounding him. I called out to him and he turned to look at me. His chubby face smiled at me. His hair was blowing in the wind. I reached my arms out to grab him but his face turned into a mad face. He began yelling at me. I couldnt make out the words but something was wrong.  I fell off a cliff, my body diving into the cool air. It turned me upside down and around. I stopped just inches before colliding my body into the cement beneath me. A maze filled the once clear air. I ran my hand through the stone walls as I began to walk. Noises began to fill the void behind the sky turned a dark color. Rain began splattering in all directions and I began to run. Turning right and left as I hurried through the maze. Each time I reached a dead end I would scream out a curse. Help me. I pleaded as I made my way back to the beginning. This only caused me to become more lost. I sat down in utter exhaustion and saw the woman from the party earlier. Having a hard time? I nodded and hung my head. This maze was ridiculous. Take my hand. She held her hand out and I looked up at her. Do it. She commanded and I did as told. I took her hand and closed my eyes. When I opened them again there was Rex. You need to marry him. She whispered and I looked over at him. He was in skinny jeans and a tank top. His tattoos were brilliant against his tan skin. You need to make him happy. Once he is happy, you will be happy as well. How do you know? What will happen with Shauna and Oct? You ask too many questions. Be simple. See what is in front of you. You have something unique. Dont lose it. Once you get something amazing and claim it, nothing can ever take it. I nodded to looked up at her. Her eyes were smiling even though her face wasnt. It is okay to be scared. I was at first too. It is not that hard. She began disappearing and I opened my mouth but stopped myself from speaking. I stood there looking at Rex. He was smiling but not at me. Krystie tore through the image and hugged him. If you dont see what is in front of you it will be gone. Her voice filtered through my mind. Krystie broke in pieces in front of him as I set my jaw and decided I was his. I was his. Simple. A smile spread across my face and I realized I had made the decision. I would become immortal and join the Tainted as one of their own. I would be immortal. Rex turned into a cloud of smoke and blackness overtook me once more. I awoke to a large red room. There was a chandelier hanging from the ceiling with various paintings spread across the walls. I curled into Rex and pulled the covers over us. I was freezing. I rubbed my eyes and looked at him. He looked restless, peaceful, while he slept. You had the dream didnt you. He whispered and opened his eyes. They were bright blue and I tilted my head at him. You did. Marjorie told you what to do didnt she? He kissed me and I couldnt help kissing him back, a smile beaming on my face. She is the oldest of the immortals. She has a connection with each of us nobody else does. You did have the dream right? The last question his voice quivered as he was scared I didnt. If it was her telling me what to do, then yes I did. He let out a whoop and pulled me close against him. Anya I want you to be mine. I want you to marry me. His voice rose an octave with pure excitement and I couldnt contain my own excitement. I want to Rex. Yes! I want to be yours. Our lips met with a spark. I felt the happiest I have ever felt in my whole life. Something inside of me had begun to grow when we had met and now was blooming full and bright. The whole fireworks sensation everyone talks about? This was fireworks forever, standing right underneath them and the sparks touching my cheeks. It was pure excitement, love and everything a human being needs to live wrapped into one. He put a finger to my lip and told me to stay put. I wrapped the sheets around me and he disappeared into another room. I pouted for a minute but soon he returned. He held out a small blue box. For those women out there, yes it was a Tiffanys box! What is this? Well it is like any other marriage. He opened the box and held it out. Will you marry me? There in front of me was a large heart shaped diamond. Smaller diamonds went down the side of the platinum ring. It was the prettiest ring I had ever seen and must have cost a fortune. I sat breathless for a minute and nodded. I looked up at him and a few tears fell down my cheeks. He brushed them away and slipped the ring onto my finger. I love you. He kissed me and ran his fingers through my hair. I played with the ring for a minute before giggling. I love you so much Rex. I hugged him and couldnt take the smile off my face. Oh man, wait till the ladies see this at work. Wait, Shauna was debating getting married. I pulled away and gave him a wry look. What? He asked helplessly and tried to hug me again. Are you asking me because Octavius asked Shauna? I pulled the covers tighter around me but stopped as I saw the pure shock on his face. What? Oh good. I giggled and hugged him tightly. They are too? That is crazy! I could feel the humour in his voice but couldnt stop myself from being excited. I kissed him and we fell back into the tangle of sheets once more. He slid one hand up into my hair, tangling his fingers within it. He wrapped his other hand around my waist and slid me close to him as he began kissing me. We should probably not do that wherever we are. I murmured between kisses. We did it last night. Why is tonight any different? He smirked. I dont even know where we are! He pulled the sheet away from me and I raised an eyebrow. We are safe. Relax. You are engaged, you shouldnt worry about where we do it. His eyes twinkled and I let myself relax under his weight. We better be safe. Or I am blaming you. I wouldnt let you get hurt darling. I smiled and his lips pressed themselves against mine once more. I was getting married. Who would believe that? After my husband dying and living four years with depression, my apartment burning up and my car shitting the bed I could still find happiness.           We had managed our way home after celebrating our engagement. Right as I walked through the door of my new home my phone rang. Hello? I answered after I realized it was Shauna. We are getting married! Me too. I giggled and I could hear her laugh on the other end. Seriously? This is ridiculous! I nodded and looked over at Rex. We should have our bachelorette parties together. I smirked over at Rex as she laughed on the other end. Gotta go. But lets plan on that. Bye. Her voice was chirpy, happier than it had been in a while. I still couldnt believe my best friend was getting married, let alone me. Shauna? Rexs voice asked as I nodded and put my phone away. Do you swear you didnt plan this? I asked as I wrapped my arms around his neck. Scouts honor my lady. He laughed and kissed me. I want to show you something. I raised an eyebrow and tilted my head to the side. He took my hand in his and pulled me to his bedroom. Oh that kind of something! He laughed and shook his head. No I am serious! He lightly placed me on the bed and left the room. Close your eyes. I let out a sigh and closed my eyes. I peeked through my fingers as he walked into the room. He was holding a large painting but it was backwards so I couldnt see it. Okay. Look. I opened my eyes as he turned it around. It was a painting of me. I was standing in my dress from the night before with my mask on. I was leaning against a wall, one leg up and the split perfectly falling where you couldnt see anything. He captured my eyes perfectly, my mask looked delicate and you could see the curves in my dress. I stared at it for a while before he coughed. It is beautiful. I smiled and he sat on the bed next to me. When did you make it? I looked up at him and kissed his cheek. Last night after you fell asleep. He stroked my hair. We can put it in the new house if you want. What? New house? I raised an eyebrow and leaned back a bit. Yes. We need a new house. This is only big enough for me. Does he forget he lives in a huge house? I didnt know what to say. Um.. Okay. What is wrong with this house? Cant you just let me buy us a house? Do you want one as big as Octavius? Or smaller? As big as Octs! That was a mansion. I will have to look at the houses first. I stuttered and he touched my belly. Well how many bedrooms should I look for? I pushed his hand away playfully. I dont know. Ask me tomorrow. I laughed and leaned back on the bed. Did he just ask if I wanted children along with a house? Oh goodness. This is a lot to handle. He kissed my neck and I let myself relax a little. Well would you consider having children? I never thought of it before honestly. I whispered and closed my eyes. The air seemed stuffy and he slowly leaned over me, placing the painting to the side. His body slid across mine and when I opened my eyes he was on top of me. He leaned down and kissed me gently. Well I would love kids. He whispered in my ear and kissed down my shoulder to my ring. I grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back to my lips. Kids never were anything Brian and I talked about. I didnt want them because we were too young, and then I didnt want one because I was too consumed by work. Maybe I could finally have a child now. Maybe I finally could be the mother I always subliminally wanted to me. I didnt even hear the door open as his lips were on mine. I heard a deep voice break through the bliss I was in. Rex we need you now. He turned towards them and stood up. There were two large men in black tuxes and aviators. One was tall with a bulky stance and short black hair. The other was shorter and wider with medium length brown hair. Rex let out a low growl and stood in front of me. I pulled the covers around myself and felt fear rising up in my throat. Go away. I told you it is over. I am through with her. The taller one nodded and took a step towards him. We cant do that. Tell her yourself. The mans voice was so deep. He looked from me back to Rex. He looked like he was from the FBI or something, just bursting into our apartment. Before I could piece together what they were there for Rex responded. I have! His hands turned into fists. I had never seen him this angry before. I looked at each man and slowly stood up next to Rex and took his hand. My eyes showed my fear but I tried to make it diminish. Thats her? The brown haired one snorted and stuck his sausage finger at me. I scowled at him and they began to walk around the room. I pressed myself closer to Rex and he protectively wrapped his arm around me. What is going on? I asked, my voice was shaking. Nothing, just keep quiet. He hissed back at me, never taking his eyes off of the two brutes. The brown haired one picked up the painting of me and let out a low laugh before tossing it onto the bed. Thank god it didnt break, I swear I could have killed him. The black haired one touched his ear and began talking into a small piece of electronic. He nodded and waved at the other man to leave. She will be by tonight, if you arent here there will be trouble. He smirked and tapped his sunglasses at me. Nice day lady. Once they left the house Rex tore away from me and began running around gathering things up. I stood completely still. What the fuck were they talking about? She? Who! A few minutes passed as my head wrapped around all the possibilities. The worst case scenario was that it was a woman from his past who he broke up with. Now she wants him back. He touched my shoulder. Anya? My eyes were slightly glazed over in thought. He shook me and repeated my name. What the fuck was that Rex! I yelled at him and pulled away. I thought you said you didnt have any shit like that! My voice was raised, the first time I had ever yelled at him. You said you would tell me everything. You said no secrets. You promised me Rex. I sounded defeated and exhausted even though emotions were welling up inside of me. I know baby. I promise I will explain but it is not safe here for you. Why! Who is this woman? He didnt look at me, only at the ground. He spoke softly and reached for my hand but I denied it from him. My mother. He whispered. What the? I groaned and walked into the kitchen, plopping down in a chair and putting my head in my hands. She wasnt immortal? She was a human and his father was a God. How is she living? That doesnt make any sense. He followed me and took my hand in his despite my restraint. Honey, it is a really long story. Just please listen to me. We cant stay here. His voice dropped. If we do she will kill you. I looked up at him, shocked at this sick joke he was playing. As I looked into his eyes I realized he wasnt playing around, he was completely serious. Okay. I whispered. I grabbed one of the bags as he thrust it at me. I slid on clothes quickly. I took my purse and followed him to the Escalade. We threw the bags into the back and I climbed in. Where will we go? I looked over at him. He turned the car on and sped out of the driveway. He turned the music and I figured he was pretty pissed. The hard rock music blared as we made our way to the highway. I took out my phone and texted Octavius. Okay long story short, Rex is pissed. He is taking me somewhere. Any clue where? About three seconds later my phone began to ring. He took the phone from my hand and threw it in the back. Hey! I reached back to grab it but he caught my arm. No texting. She will find us. He spoke quietly but stern. His face was straightforward on the road, he never had looked over at me when he spoke. His nose was flaring and his jaw was set. I nodded and bit the inside of my lip as I watched the passing trees. We had gone out of the city and into a countryside. There were only a few houses every couple of miles. I leaned back in my chair and pushed my hair from my face. I was terrified, so many more questions running through my mind. I had finally gotten over the immortality aspect and now a psycho mother? No way this was a normal family. Maybe I should have asked before I had gotten caught up in all of this. I closed my eyes and felt his hand on my knee. He always did this when he drove, it comforted me and I think it secretly made him relax. I kept my eyes closed as the questions blew through my mind. I picked the ones most important and repeated them in my head so when we stopped I could ask. My phone went off again but I didnt bother trying to get it. His thumb stroked the side of my knee and I turned towards him. He wrapped his arm around me and I sunk against his shoulder. I love you. I whispered. I just wish I knew where we were going. He nodded but his eyes never left the road. You will see. Please dont stress. We drove for two hours, with me falling in and out of sleep. It was a long boring ride with many highways. When I looked up I noticed we were in a higher class neighborhood. Each house had its own fancy driveway, carved pathway to the door, lights surrounding each lot and the houses were enormous. These houses were bigger than Octavius. I pressed my face against the window and watched the houses slowly crawl by. I noticed a large Victorian house, painted gray and black. A colonial house with blue shutters and tan siding passed along next followed by one made up with a majority of windows, inviting one into their home easily. We pulled along a long road and finally he turned into a driveway. A large gate with something scribbled across the top of it filled my view. He pushed three buttons on the pager and the gates rolled away. Here we are. His voice sounded confident among everything that had just happened. As the car rolled up the driveway a large house appeared among the land. The driveway was at least half a mile long. Lanterns followed the road and it had been recently landscaped. The house itself was twice as big as Octavius. It was a castle that now filled my eyes and I let out a soft gasp. Rising from the ground was a huge rock castle, spires stretching up from the roof. The tips were blue and the castle was a pale gray color. A large door stood in the way of walking into the place. Windows etched with intricate designs were everywhere and I thought I spotted gargoyles on the very top. The car had come to a stop and I realized my mouth was open, gaping at this large castle. And you have been making me live in that puny house! Was the first thing out of my mouth. He simply laughed and pulled me close. His fingers wound in my hair. Im sorry to make you rush out. This is the other home. I told you I had one for children. I smirked and kissed him. So lets get inside and I can tell you the whole mother issue. We made our way into the large house and I couldnt help but feeling like I was in a Disney castle. A large U shaped staircase filled my view as we entered the castle. Chandeliers danced across the ceiling, playing light across the ruby red carpet snaking its way up the stairs. The staircase had black carvings amongst the tan railing. My lips parted in a half awe and Rexs laugh cut through my amazement. What? I asked still slightly grumpy about the whole situation. He smiled and walked away from me. The top of the stairs branched into three rooms and downstairs there were at least seven. He took the first door to the left. I tentatively followed him and noticed we were now in the kitchen. Each room seemed to amaze me more. Brand new appliances were scattered around the kitchen, bright silver among the sky blue walls. He put a black bag on the table and took some things from it. I saw him put a bottle of wine, some bottles of water, a loaf of bread, some sandwich meat and a salad in the fridge. I gingerly slid into one of the bar stools that hugged the table. After he finished he stood, with hand on hip, and looked at me. A smile lit up his face as he looked down at me. Dont give me that look. I crossed my arms across my chest and leaned back against the chair. I let out a soft sigh as he walked over and began rubbing my shoulders. So the mother thing? I asked and he stopped for a minute and then continued without answering my question. I frowned and leaned forward but he pulled me back against him. Dont be like this. He cooed in my ear. Then explain. I responded with a stern voice. I am sick of learning about this shit after the fact. I was fine with the immortal thing, I thought you were going to tell me everything. The sound of defeat filled my voice. Baby, lets eat dinner. Let me show you the house and lets relax. We are safe here. The castle held a very safe feeling against me. There was a west wing and an east wing. The main section of the house had the kitchen, living room, dining room and an office. Each wing mirrored each other with three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a master set of each.  The night had proceeded as he told it me it would. We had a spaghetti dinner and a bottle of wine. The only thing that didnt go according to plan was when those two big oafs caught me and took me from Rex. He had said we were safe so I had wandered the house and when I stepped into a bedroom on the west wing was when they grabbed me. I could barely see them but I knew it was them, who else could it have been? They put a bag over my head and tied my hands behind my back. All I could remember was them hitting my head and I fell into blackness. Where was my Rex? Why wasnt he saving me? I awoke in a bedroom much like the ones in the castle, which was so named Winthrop Manor. There was a hideous floral print stretched across the walls and even the bed set matched. I pulled myself into a sitting position as quickly as I could, not sure where I was. I looked down at a white shirt and jeans I was now wearing. My hair was free around my shoulders and I pulled it back into a ponytail. I touched my forehead and a searing pain ripped through my head. I noticed there was a small door to the back of the room and figured it was a bathroom. I made my way over and looked into the mirror. There was a large gash that went across half my forehead. It had been stitched though, which had me confused. If someone was keeping me hostage why would they fix up my wound? I heard a knock on the door and looked for something to defend myself with. I stepped out of the bathroom slowly and bit the inside of my lip. Someone was sitting on the bed now. She was draped in black lace, a hat sat atop of her head. I moved my bare feet on the floor quietly but her voice stopped me. Dont even bother. They are outside and can kill you at any moment. I felt my stomach lurch as her voice filled the room. It had a buttery aspect to it but it was laced with a razor blade side. I stood there motionless and looked down at myself. I noticed there was a large cut on my foot and my leg had started to seep blood through the jeans. They will heal. They are just flesh wounds. Her voice rang out again. In one large sweeping motion she now stood in front of me. She was a tall woman, almost six feet I would say, with long black hair that hugged her shoulders. Her face was cold and heartless although. Her eyes were black as night, her pale skin just made them brighter. Her lips were thin pink lines, the only thing with color on her whole face. Her eyelashes were thin along with her eyebrows. Small lines trailed their way from her eyes and lips, suggesting she was aging. She gave me a once over and smiled, her teeth showing only slightly. I felt something in the pit of my stomach and stood up straighter. Well we must get you ready. Ready for what? I asked and she shot me a look. Do not spoke unless you are spoken to. She shot me a look of distaste and let out a couple slow breaths as she regained her composure. We must get you ready to meet people okay? She tried to hold her voice but it wavered at the end. With that she left the room and a small woman walked in. She was wearing a large dress, it looked like one you would wear in the older times, fit with corset and all. She smiled and grabbed a box from a closet I hadnt noticed before. Her hair was piled up on top of her head in many curls. Her hair was blonde, her skin tan and she was skinny as a rail. She opened the box and pulled out a sky blue dress. I had stayed in my spot but now walked over to her. Why am I getting dressed up? I asked her. Her chocolate brown eyes melted as if she was confused someone was talking to her. She shook her head and laid the dress out on the bed. To meet him. I raised an eyebrow at her, trying to keep my eye from the gorgeous dress. Her husband. What? I looked back at her, completely blindsided by this. Yep. Please be careful what you say, he is a God and he has powers still. I groaned and sat down in a chair. Could this get any more fucking confusing? Please miss, we need to get you dressed. I nodded and looked back at the dress. There was a white area that covered my bust and just went a little off my shoulders. Then the dress plunged into the blue, small areas bunched up to make one look slimmer. At the end was another layer of white, popping out from beneath the dress. I pulled away as she tried to help me from my clothes. I got it. I whispered and pulled the jeans and shirt off. I looked down at my body, a yellow bruise lined my left ribs, the two marks on my legs had stopped bleeding but looked horrible. I didnt even noticed the girl leave the room but when she returned she began to bandage the cuts. What is your name? I whispered as she fixed my cuts. Wincing every now and then I looked down at her. Gloria. I came to work here a long time ago. Sorry. She apologized for the pain and I couldnt believe it. She was so nice, how could she stand that bitch who we had met earlier. That bitch is totally Rexs mom! Do you know why I am here? I asked as she put bandages on and I started to pull the dress on. It was large but it did have a princess feel to it. She nodded but didnt speak until I had the dress completed. She wants to know if you are right for her son. She smoothed the dress out and I looked down at myself. I dont know what I felt. I didnt feel beautiful like I did when we had the masquerade ball. I just felt silly. Gloria led me to the vanity and sat me down. She pulled the hair tie from my hair and began brushing it. She is picky, rude and always thinks of herself. Dont talk too much. She spoke with a calm manner. Are you like a maid? I asked quietly, almost instantly regretting it as I felt her shudder against my hair. It is a little more complicated than that I am afraid. She pulled my hair up into an elegant spiral much like her own. My hair was naturally curling around the bun and she simply pinned it in place. She now sat in front of me and did my makeup, concealing the mark on my face completely. I was quite astonished. A soft rap came at the door and she smiled at me. It is time. I stood up and slipped on the shoes she gave me.  --**--  Rex had been writing a long, boring email to his mother about how he would not talk to her when he heard Anyas scream ring out. He dashed away from the computer with pure shock on his face. How did she find them here? Anya? He called out and noticed a flicker of something. He rushed down the hall and one of her shoes had fallen off. Anya! He called again. He took up, running much faster than he ever had before. His heart was pounding in his chest, all he could hear were her groans of protest as they carried her away. He noticed a window opened as they pulled her out. The two big oafs from before. No! He called and ran after them. He jumped through the window and took off on the wet grass towards their car. They were faster however and skidded from the parking lot. No Anya! He spoke breathlessly and put his hands on his knees. No. After a few minutes he had sunk into the grass, still repeating her name. He let out a loud scream, filling the quiet air. In his pocket his phone vibrated and he took it out, looking at the name before throwing it into the grass. He covered his face and rolled onto his stomach. He stopped for a second and got up, climbing his way over to the phone and picked it up. Octavius? Are you there? His rough voice filled the phone. Rex! Where ya been buddy? I need you. Right now. Please. His voice cracked and he sat up. They took her. They took Anya. What are you talking about? Oct asked concerned on the other end. Ill send you the address. Just come now. With that he hung up the phone and texted him the address. He fell back down into the grass and closed his eyes. To see his mother again would be gut wrenching. The last time he had seen her was to show her Krystie. That whole situation didnt work out quite right and now all she wanted was him to get back with her. She didnt understand why he couldnt be with someone who was already immortal. The thing about being with someone who is already immortal is there is no way to show you really love them. He would give up his immortality for Anya, he couldnt do that for Krystie. To be with an immortal was just being immortal. He sighed and could see his breath in the cool night sky. Sir. A soft voice broke his thoughts and at first his body went rigid and then it relaxed. It was the butler, he always showed up randomly. There has been a situation. Your lady friend has been taken and your mother wants you there at 10 am. I hear you have called Octavius. Shall we crack open the lair? Rex could see his face light up without looking up at him. He stood up and hugged the butler even though he just stood still. Lets do this.  --**--  I walked through the house with Gloria by my side. I looked at the paintings that I assumed were done by Rex. They matched his brush strokes perfectly and the amount of color. I missed him terribly. Gloria pulled me to the right of the hallway as a group of oafs as I now called them, walked by. She shook her head and I nodded. They must be her guards or something. We made our way to a large temple looking area. There were large pillars that lined up in a row with a carpet going down the middle. Torches were lit also even though it was daylight out. We stopped for a second and Gloria bowed down. I looked around confused, but did what she did. We then made our way down the long hallway. It was open, outside, so I could feel the breeze. It was cool against this hot dress and I could feel my hair slipping already. I held my hands in front of me for Gloria said not to touch it. If it falls it falls. As we walked I could see what looked like a throne room opening up in front of us. There sat two people, the woman from earlier and a man, with guards on either side. The guards were wearing all black, their heads down and swords at their hip. No way I was getting out of this one easily. As we approached the thrones we bowed and waited for one to speak. Eventually the woman spoke and we stood back up. The man had long black hair that looked identical to the womans. He was wearing what looked like traditional armor but he had a long black cape made from some sort of animal. His face was virtually free of wrinkles but you could tell he was older. His skin was olive and his eyes a dark gray color. So you must be Anya. His voice slid across the room and I looked up at him. He readjusted himself in his seat and cleared his throat. Do you understand why you are here? I shrugged and he stood up. He walked towards me and I could feel my heart jump into my throat. Rex had a calm manner to him but this man had that feeling that makes your hair stand on end. I stood still as he walked around me. Well it seems our little Rex likes you for some odd reason. Why is it odd? Because I am not already immortal? I spat back. I didnt regret it, what would he do to me? He just smiled and stood in front of me. Well dont get all mouthy. He leaned forward and I could smell his musky scent or pine needles and cinnamon. I know you are probably amazing for Rex. The thing is is he is a mommys boy and she doesnt like many people. I felt his hand on my waist and my body stiffened. Dont get so nervous. We arent here to hurt you. Just to.. He paused and dropped his hands. See if you are worth it. He looked over at the woman and nodded. Lets go. He took my arm in his and we walked away from her. I looked back at Gloria but she was talking to the woman now, whom I still didnt know her name. He took me out to the outside where an elegant garden enfolded in front of us. There were different colors everywhere, swirling around together. A large line of trees surrounded the area, towering over the bushes and flowers. I could see a weeping willow in one corner, tiger lillies encircling it. Daisies, daffodils, peonies and roses all bursted from the ground at full bloom. I was never one for flowers but this beautiful garden had me enticed. If I could sit out here and watch the animals react to it, it would be a marvelous day in my book. I relaxed a bit next to him. He was muscular, I could tell just from his arm that was holding mine. He walked slowly next to me, quietly at first. Please excuse May. She can get crazy. I looked up at him, not even realizing he was talking at first. May? I asked quietly. Yes. My wife. I nodded. That was her name! She is very protective; ever since Rex was young she was like that. I think it was because of me. I nodded and bit the inside of my lip. Was he the God? He smiled and nodded. Yes I am. I looked up at him and opened my mouth. I saw the look on your face. We had made our way to a series of benches and there was a water fountain in between them. He led me to a seat and I sat down as the breeze blew my hair and a chunk fell down. I smiled up at him as he pulled the hair back up with the rest and pinned it up. I was slowly feeling better about being around him, not as relaxed as I was with Rex though. I felt my cheeks blush slightly as I thought about Rex again. I missed him incredibly. So has he proposed yet? He asked and I realized I was playing with the ring on my finger. I nodded and held out my hand. The diamond shone with the sunlight as I turned my hand to the side. He smiled and leaned back against the cool stone bench. I figured he would. You are quite different from his usual women. How so? I asked quietly. He smiled and looked at the water fountain. You will soon see. He spoke quietly.  --**--  Rex and the butler Oscar had made their way to the basement in the castle. Oscar punched in some numbers on the keypad and a large door opened up like a garage door would. Inside was dark but soon the lights flickered on as they walked into the room. Mounted on the walls were various guns from small to large AK 47s. They were all filled with stun shots, nothing kill worthy. Oscar walked straight through the hall and opened up a cabinet on the far left side. Rex frowned and walked over towards Oscar. I never thought we would have to use this stuff before. Oscar looked over at him and smiled a half hearted smile. I know sir. Oscar chimed in and held out a black outfit for him. Rex took it and changed into it. He now wore a black vest, black tight pants with a white shirt. Across his back was a large strap for a gun. He leaned down and slid a knife into a holster on his ankle. Octavius voice rang out in the background. Rex whats up? What happened? He rushed over and looked at Oscar. No. Not that. Octavius nodded and put his hand on Rexs shoulder. Its okay. We can do this. He grabbed a gun and slid it into his belt. She better not have more guards than she did last time. Rexs mother was obsessed with power. Somehow she had managed to keep Rexs father with her once Rex had grown up. This caused millions of issues with him and his mother. May had raised him to think about himself and not others. He was told his father was a bad person and that he had left them. This of course was a lie and he soon figured it out when his father came back. She had made it so Rex had to talk to her after years of not talking with her. She had actually held him captive for a while, trying to make him understand and Octavius had to break him out, so this wasnt the first time they had to use force with her. Rex strapped the gun to the inside of his leg. The last time he had injured many guards and he trained every day, the way she had taught him. Since he was young, Octavius had fought by his side. They knew what to do to complement each others moves. How to keep their backs together and they had learned how to fight as one. Rex looked in the mirror and let out a deep sigh. His black clothes made him look thinner yet more defined. All of his tattoos were covered up. The small glasses he had been wearing were replaced with sunglasses. These also doubled as night vision glasses. It will be alright. Im sure she hasnt done anything. I just hope Anyas temper hasnt gotten the better of her. Octavius rough voice interrupted the still air. Rex looked towards him and nodded. I hope she hasnt met Roya. Octavius made a grunt noise and headed towards the car. Anya, I hope you are safe. Rex thought before they disappeared into a black SUV.  --**--  I sat on the bench next to the older man and let out a soft sigh. Excuse me sir, but Im not sure what to call you. I know Mays name but what do I call you? He let out an unsettling laugh and picked up my hand in his. He pet the back of my hand for a moment before answering. His skin felt soft against mine, much like Rexs. No imperfections were obvious, it felt more like the skin of a small child. My name is Roya. That is what you can call me. He gave a friendly smile and I could feel myself slowly relax around him. The longer I was with him, the more I felt like I was with Rex. The breeze hit us with a chilly aspect it didnt hold earlier. I debated asking to go inside but he seemed content, that and I didnt really want to deal with her. So have you heard of our last encounter with Rex? He questioned randomly. I didnt expect him to tell me about his personal life. I shook my head no and he settled into the cold, hard bench. Well Rex grew up not knowing who I was. I was a horrible person when he was born, so dont hold it against me. I nodded and turned towards him as he told me the story. He had grown up thinking I was a terrible person, which is why he hates me. Then when I returned after figuring out I needed to step up and be a father, it was too late. His mother had filled him with hatred. He left us after I returned and said that if I wanted to be with his mother, he would not stay. I later married his mother and she joined me in immortality. That is the only reason she is alive today. Unfortunately I showed up when she was older, which is why she looks older than me. We had invited him to celebrate our marriage and he refused. He let out a soft sigh. We ended up getting in contact with his butler and offered him a job here, hoping that it would make him come visit us. He came in and stormed the place. He kind of went a little psycho. Ever since then he hasnt talked to us. I understand, dont get me wrong, but he should get over it. I fucked up, but its been years. I looked up at him, amazed at Rex being so angry. I sat silent for a minute, fitting the pieces of the puzzle together. You brought me here to fix the tension between you by forcing him to come here? I stated matter-of-factly. Royas eyes flickered and he smiled. You are quite smart. You should do well in this family. I played with the ring on my finger and smiled. I havent had a family in a long time. I whispered, looking down at the ground. He gave me a quizzical look but I didnt want to just jump my life story on him. Go on. I am not one to judge. I smiled as the air seemed to warm up and I felt more secure. I gave him the basics, my mothers death and my husbands death. His eyebrows scrunched together and then let go. You have seen too much death. He spoke quietly, everything sinking in I though. I felt myself fidgeting and played with the loose curls that had fallen. He stood up swiftly, almost in alarm. Dinner is ready. he chirped. We can continue talking after dinner. I nodded and he took my arm in his one more time. He was very proper, like Rex. Or was Rex like him? We walked through the soft grass and I now noticed the sun was setting. I didnt think we had been talking that long! We made our way down the side of the building to a huge umbrella with a patio set under it. The umbrella had to be at least 20 ft wide. The table was set for three, Roya, May and I. The plates were black with gold etching around the lip. There was mashed potatoes, pork roast, gravy, carrots, green beans and water on the table. Each plate had been preset with food. A bottle of wine was held out in front of me as I took my seat between May and Roya. I nodded and a glass was poured for me. Roya sat at the head of the table with May on the opposite side. I gingerly bit into my food after Roya had and settled into my seat.           Rex pulled the SUV up the driveway and cut the lights. The huge palace stood in front of him and he felt a shiver slide down his back. Octavius was already out of the car and making his way up the driveway. Rex flew up past him and crouched behind a bush. The lights were on the right half of the building. Octavius had already headed towards a window and cracked it open. A red light flashed for a second in front of them. Rex pushed Octavius aside and hopped over the light, almost hitting it. Octavius jumped in after. The walls were plastered with paintings and it gave Rex a sinking feeling. What were they doing to Anya? Was she hurt? He felt his heart drop a little as they walked. Guards were talking down the hall and Rex put his arm out to stop Octavius. The guards were laughing but soon they left. A room sat alone but light poured out from under the door. Octavius took the handle and looked up at Rex, giving him a nod before pushing the door open. Light flooded the hallway and they ran into the room and shut the door behind them. The room was plain, a bed sat nestled in a corner with a dresser next to it. The overhead lamp was on which was providing the light. Rex held the gun out and went through the room, looking for Anya. Anya? He whispered, his voice hoarse. Octavius spread out and checked the bedroom but she was nowhere in sight. Rex shot Octavius a look and they decided to head deeper into the palace. Rex opened the door, waited a minute and then continued down the hallway. He knew there were many rooms in this palace. This palace that haunted him in his dreams. This is where he grew up, where he was told of the horrible things his father had done. This was where he trained, where Octavius had met with him numerous times for advice. Three guards stood in front of them as they stopped in their tracks. Octavius held out his gun, ready to shoot when he heard the cock of a gun behind him. Well, well well. What do we have here. A stern voice rose from behind Octavius. He put his hand down and Rex turned back to look at the man. It was one of the guards, his face all perked up that he had caught the runaways. Well Roya has been looking for you Rex. He walked around Rex and pointed in the direction towards the lighted area. Nice to see you too Raymond. Rex slurred out and began walking. Raymond was the head security guard. Raymond and Rex had met numerous times whether it be to remind Rex of his mothers affection or to remind him that he needs to visit her. Raymond patted Rex on the back as they made their way towards Royas room. Roya has missed you. May hasnt heard from you in a long time. She is mad about that. You got a girl though right? She is here! She is having so much fun with Roya. Rex stopped walking and Raymond shoved him. Dont get all heroic. She is fine. Roya likes her. Rex grunted but continued walking.  They turned down a well lit hallway and Rex knew that Royas room was coming up. They stopped. Octavius was behind Rex with the three guards where they waited until Raymond knocked on the door. It opened but nobody was behind it. Raymond ushered Rex inside and closed the door behind him. Rex looked around confused. A large bed sat in the middle of the room with a red and black bed set. Two rooms branched off of the room and there was a shadow on the left room. Roya? Rex spoke softly, waiting for him to answer. He crossed his arms across the front of his chest and waited. I heard Rexs voice and stopped. Rex? I let out a soft scream and ran past the room I was currently in. I could hear him, that was him right? Rex? I called out again. I was still in the large dress the edges were growing dirty because I had worn it all day. I rushed past the china cabinet, the dresser and the bed. Rex! I called out again. He heard my scream and watched through the doorframe. Anya? I ran through the bedroom to see an empty room. Anya? I heard his voice again and followed it. I made my way over to a wall and tapped on it. I heard a tap back and pressed myself against the wall. Rex is that you? Get me out of here. I whispered and tapped again. I heard his soft voice and smiled. Ill get you baby, dont worry. I heard the door open to my room and groaned. Rex, somebody is at my room. I whispered before making my way over. Hello? I called and stopped. Oh Roya, hi. I put my hands behind my back as he made his way into the room. He was in his robes for the night, his face ageless like always. I was just checking on you. I heard Rex had gotten in. We should see if we can find him. I felt my cheeks flare up for a second. Where is he? I asked suddenly, surprised by my own impatience. I need him Roya. I need him now. Roya nodded and turned to leave the room. He will be in in five minutes. Do not forget why I brought you here. He said in a rather calm manner. He smiled and then left. I collapsed on the bed, emotions running through me. How could Rex have let me get kidnapped? Why was I the one who had to fix this relationship? How was I going to fix it? I heard the door open once more and bit my lip. Anya? I heard his voice and sat straight up. His face popped out and I ran over to him. Anya! He whispered and held me tightly. I hugged him tighter than I ever had before. Tears fell down my face and his hands went around me. One went up behind my head and held me against his chest while the other worked itself around my back. Rex, I was so scared. Rex I didnt know what was going to happen. I balled and never let go of him. I know. I know baby, I am so sorry. We fell over onto the bed and I buried myself against him further. Dont leave me ever again. Ever! I screamed at him. His body shook underneath mine and I knew he was crying. I had never seen him cry before. I love you. I whispered and pulled his head up so I could see him. His eyes were bloodshot and I cupped his face in mine. I love you too. Nothing like this will ever happen again. He gently put his lips against mine, still shaking from crying. I kissed back, emotions still churning in my stomach. I felt betrayed yet loved, angry yet happy, upset yet emotionless. I couldnt believe he put me through all of this. He did come back for me though. That had to outweigh everything. He rescued me. He really was my knight. We must have stayed like that for a while, holding each other so tightly. I think I fell asleep a couple of times in the process. When I woke up from my recent lapse into unconsciousness, it was dark outside. I rolled over and hugged Rex. He smiled and brushed my hair from my face and kissed my forehead. Did I fall asleep for long? I whispered. He laughed and pulled me close. He propped himself up against the bed he had somehow managed to fall asleep on. I think we both fell asleep, love. He whispered and kissed my cheek. I propped myself up on my elbow and let out a soft sigh. He gave me a concerned look and I smiled back at him. Do you know why they took me yet? He went to hug me but I stopped him. We need to work this out. I whispered and he gave me a sigh of defeat. So Roya thinks you hate him and I understand if you do but we need to fix this. He will keep taking me if we dont fix it okay? He really wants to be friends with you and doesnt think you should treat him like this. What is wrong with him? He seems nice. Rex let out a low grumble and leaned back away from me. You wouldnt understand. Bullshit. Try me. I answered and crossed my arms across my chest. He left my mom for what? So he could live out his Godly ways? He doesnt care about her. He doesnt care about me. Some father he was he didnt even come when I needed him. Rex he is here now and he is trying to fix what happened. He knows you are mad at him but he wants to fix it. He wouldnt come back if he didnt care. He didnt care that she was older, he still stayed with her. How much more doubt do you need? He knows he hasnt been there for you but he is now. Rex looked away from my gaze and sighed. I cant. Its hard for me to just accept him back in my life. Well he isnt expecting you to do it right now, he just wants you to try. I spoke quietly and took his hand in mine. I looked at his tattoo he had said was for his father. Didnt you say that tattoo was for him? His mouth turned up and into a smile. I did. Before he left, well actually the first time he came back. I wanted to impress him with my tattoo shop and said I would get a tattoo for him. He seemed thrilled so I got it because he said he used to be in the Navy. When I returned from work that day he was nowhere to be found and my mother said he had left. That shattered me. I actually thought he was going to stay and he didnt. I cant let him back into my life, I cant have a father who is going to leave all the time. I just cant do it Anya. I frowned but knew what he meant. My own family situations had been horrible. My father was always good to me but my mother near the end couldnt even remember who I was. There is nothing worse than the person who raised you not even knowing your name. I looked back up into his stormy eyes and let out a soft sigh. We need to fix this. I said under my breath. He nodded and closed his eyes as our foreheads touched. I looked down at my fingers entwined with his. I played with the ring nervously waiting for his response. I heard a small knock on the door and looked over at Rex. He stood up but I stopped him and walked to the door myself. Outside stood a frenzied Roya. Has anything come from your talking? He asked in a hushed whisper. I turned my head back to Rex. His head was in his hands and he was breathing slowly. I nodded and smiled at Roya, opening the door. I think you should talk to him while I talk to May. I said in a stern voice. He cocked his head ever so slightly and whispered something to his guards. I looked back at Rex, who was in the same position, and hoped I was doing the right thing. I bit the inside of my lip and leaned to the side as Roya slowly made his way into the room. I turned back to see Roya pat Rex on the shoulder. Rex turned his head up with a confused expression before glancing at me. I nodded and slipped out of the door. I heard raised voices the second I did and let out a slow sigh. You boys showing me to May? I asked the guards and they nodded. We began walking down the long corridor and I smiled to myself. I had never stuck up for anything I believed in but back there I did and it was about to get even better. I was going to tell May what was on my mind. Throughout my whole relationship with Rex I have learned a few important facts. Life is life, dont waste it. I wasted so long holding out because I was upset about my husband that I wouldnt let myself relax around anybody. Maybe it was good though, or else I would have been taken when Rex came around. Number two: always be ready for surprises. Immortal? Now I am like yeah so? If you would come up to me and say you had a two headed baby I would probably believe you. Okay I probably wouldnt but the fact is that I am ready for anything. Throw it at me, I am not afraid anymore. The last thing is let family into your life. You will be so much happier. Since being with Rex I have been talking to my family more than even and finding myself happier than ever. I was even ready to bring Roya into my family. May on the other hand I would need to have a word with. We walked through the quiet halls and stopped in front of a set of black doors. I let out a sigh and the guard to my left motioned towards the door. Here we go, I sighed. I pushed the doors open, set my jaw and walked in. It was set up like a library, bookcases crowding the walls Tables were scattered in no apparent pattern among the space between the bookcases. May was huddled in one plush chair with a book spread out in front of her. She glanced up as the doors opened and twitched one side of her lips up into a snarl. Nice to see you too May. I spoke softly, twisting the chair in my grip and sitting on it backwards. She leaned back in her chair and pushed her hair behind her ear. And what do you want? She crossed her hands slowly. I want to know why you are such a bitch and why Roya even deserves you? She didnt like my answer for her eyebrows rose and her hand clenched into a fist. I leaned forward in my seat and whispered. You want to fight? Before I could move her fist connected with my jaw. It sent me reeling off of the chair onto the floor. I couldn't even fathom what she had just done. I got up and she was next to me. Fighting is so unlike you Anya. She snarled and I saw the fire in her eyes. I crouched and held my fists in front of me. Why? Oh wait, I am supposed to be just like Krystie right? She is the perfect child and you set them up a long time ago am I right? I ducked and slapped her hand away from my face as she lunged towards me. Yes! Why do you think Roya left? He left to make it happen. He left to make sure his son would become the next in line. You think Roya really wants someone like Octavius in lead? I let my guard down and gave her a puzzling look. A hideous laugh escaped from her throat. That is what it is all about! If two immortals become a pair then they will rule their section together. Roya always was leader but didnt have Rex soon enough so he left to figure out what would make him the leader. I was short of breath but moved to the table, leaning against it. Rex doesnt want that! He wants a normal life. He likes that Octavius is leader. That is all this is about? You dont even care what your son wants? I could feel the anger growing inside of me as hers was too. She leaned forward and I swung at her, connecting with her shoulder. I was going for her face but was proud I got her in the first place. If you didnt show up it would all work as planned! She screamed and ran towards me. I twirled around the table and glared at her. He would be with her and become rightful leader. Your head is major twisted sister. I hissed. I had never felt this much anger before. I felt blood trickle down from where her ring had cut my jaw. I wiped the blood away and felt her body rush against mine. She held me in a grip so strong I couldnt break free. I coughed and hurled her onto the table so I could get away. Frantically I looked around for a way to get out or help myself defeat her. She wheezed a bit before getting back up, all I could find were books so I threw one at her. Books? She chuckled. You cant change the future. Once I am done with you the plan will carry out. Done with me? What you plan on killing me? My heart began beating faster. If that was the case I needed to get my ass in gear. I threw another book at her, this time striking her in the forehead. A cackle rose from her as she fell back onto the ground. I felt a small twinge of guilt as I saw her fall but when she got back up and threw a chair at my head it immediately went away. Youre a horrible mother! I threw another few books at her, she had gotten her own books by now.. You dont deserve to have him as a son! And you dont deserve him in anyway, let alone a child with him! She screamed back between books. A child? You must be crazy I am not pregnant! Plus I cant be since I will be going through with the ceremony little miss Krystie was supposed to go through with! By now I had blocked her out to a high pitched whine. If anyone were to walk in it was a mess. Books were now strewn across the entire library along with a few stray chairs. I was screaming along with her though, dont give me the credit of being the bigger person in this situation. We both had gotten each other in the face a few times. She had a large gash across her forehead but I swear it was healing as we fought. I had several small cuts along my jaw and a bruise starting on my left eyebrow. Just go away and leave this family alone! She screamed before running straight at me. We both fell down in a tangle of purely outraged females. Hair pulling and scratching was what consumed us currently until she stopped. Thought so. Too weak to finish the job. I spoke with an edge that could cut through anything and pushed her away from me. I stood up, smearing the blood along my cheek and looked at the door which was now flung open and a wide mouth Roya and Rex stood there. May was still cowered on the ground and I just slunk down into a chair. Guess your talk went better than ours. I spoke, breaking the rising tension in the room. I think I am ready to go honey. I spat out the word honey as I walked past May. Rex and Roya stood in front of me still shell shocked at the fact we had fought so violently. I glanced back at the mess and smiled. Rex turned with me and we walked away from that place. Octavius was sitting outside in the car. He got up and ran out to us. What happened to you Anya? She kicked ass. Rex smirked and squeezed me tighter against him. Octavius smiled and we all got into the car. Definitely a night I would remember.           I woke up in the middle of the night, beads of sweat rolling off my forehead. God it was hot. I slid my hand down across my belly and smiled. What had once been flat now rose up into a curve. I hobbled my way up from the bed and walked towards the bathroom. I opened the widow and the cool evening air washed over me. I turned sideways in the mirror and put my hand on the bump once more. Hello little one. I whispered. I cant wait to meet you. For an instant I thought I felt a kick, but then remembered it was too early for that. I was barely just showing and there wasnt a way the baby would be kicking already. I decided to get something to eat and made my way towards the kitchen. I still couldnt believe I had a little baby inside of me. It was crazy. I opened the cabinets and found some crackers and munched on them happily. I wasnt quite ready to go to bed so I flopped down on the couch and flipped the tv on. It was 2 in the morning so all that was on was infomercials and paid programming. Or were those the same thing? I finally gave up and pushed a dvd in. Leaning back on the couch I settled in for a majority of the movie. Lord of the Rings usually put me to sleep simply based on the length. I made it through the first one and popped in the second before feeling sleep tug at my eyes. Rolling onto the couch I found myself falling into darkness finally.  --**--  Anya? Wake up honey. I yelped and jumped up at his voice. A laugh erupted from his chest and I threw my pillow at him. You jerk! He leaned over and kissed my cheek. I winced and he pulled away. You never did tell me what happened. He whispered as he stroked my cuts with his thumb. For the most part they were healing alright. When I had gotten home I had found three more cuts and realized I didnt just bruise my eyebrow, there was a gash right through it. I closed my eyes and felt him leave the bed. Frowning I pulled myself up and looked down, eager to see my growing belly. I pushed the covers away but nothing was there. My stomach sat there, flatter than ever. I felt my heart sink. It felt so real. I whispered and ran my hand over my stomach. I thought... Thought what? Rex interrupted me and handed me a cool face cloth for my cuts. Thought that you got skinnier? I swear you get smaller every day. He leaned down and kissed my stomach but I just stayed still. Whats wrong Anya? He asked and looked up at me. I shook my head and felt my cheeks burn. Nothing, just a stupid dream. He took the cloth from my hands and gently stroked the cut. Ow. I bit the inside of my lip and he said sorry profusely. After a long silence he pulled me into his arms. I have been around long enough to know when somebody had a bad dream. He whispered into my ear. So what is it? I clutched him closer but didnt speak. Instead I closed my eyes and let out a slow sigh. I thought he had fallen asleep for the lack of movement. Baby dream? I pulled away from him and frowned. Wh.. what? I stuttered and tried to keep my face straight. Why would I have a dream about that? He cupped my head in his hands and kissed me. It had felt forever since I had kissed him. He smelled of honey and vanilla. Roya and I stood outside longer than you knew. I heard what she said. I curled into him, not wanting him to know how upset I was that I wasnt pregnant. She says stuff like that. Dont take it to heart okay? He kissed down my jaw line and stopped at my ear. We can keep trying you know. I could hear his lips turn into a smirk as he said it. Rex. I couldnt stop myself from giggling. He pulled me close against him and kissed me once more, this time letting his hands push the covers away to reveal my body. I felt a low growl in his throat and gave him a look. You make me feel like an animal. I just want you so bad. He smirked and kissed me again, burying me within the kiss. His body soon was over me, pulling me up against it. My head was swirling between the small aches and pains from the previous day and the pleasure rippling through it today. His fingertips traced their way down my waist and underneath the hem of my pants. I kept his mouth against mine as he slid my pants away as if they were a burden. My fingers traced across his naked back and his chest. His chest muscles were hard today, unlike many other days. You working out mister? I half moaned. I heard a husky laugh in my ear as he began kissing down my body. I grabbed the pillow underneath me and watch him slide along my body. He stopped at my hip and nipped at it before making his way lower. I closed my eyes and let everything that had happened in the past few days float away. Everything he had put me through floated away from my body, taking the stress, pain and anger with it. It didnt matter anymore because here I was, with him. I felt his lips on mine as he parted my legs. His fingers teased me and a whimper came from within. I looked into his eyes, begging him but they just shone a more brilliant blue. He slipped a finger inside of me and my body arched against him. His husky voice filled my head and he kept speaking my name. I was in such a state of bliss when he stopped I whined. He smiled and filled the hole he had left. Filled that empty void that I was scared he would leave in my life forever. I grabbed him and held him close against him. His tattoos seemed to sparkle. Maybe it was the light, or I was seeing things but he seemed electric tonight. His face was buried into my neck, stubble on his chin caressed my collarbone. His body tensed with mine, lost in each others grip. I leaned back on the bed, my arms above my head and his hands connected with mine. He held me down, holding back the amazing sensation I would soon feel. His lips were hot against mine once more and my whole world erupted. Colors and stars flashed by and the whole time he held me. Held me close vowing he would never let me go again. He collapsed beside me and kissed my hand. I tried to catch my breath but couldnt. I let out a steady sigh and Rex pulled me beside him. I could feel his pulsing heart against my own. I smiled and looked up at him. Do you think it worked that time? He smirked and kissed my collarbone. I pulled the sheets around my naked body, goosebumps encasing my skin. What? I dont get to see your body? He pouted and I glared at him. I love seeing your body. Soon you will have a bump. He smiled and slid his hand across my stomach. I hope so. I whispered. He nuzzled up against me. Soon baby, soon. I closed my eyes and relaxed beside him. Suddenly I jolted upright and dug around on the floor for my phone. Whats wrong? He pushed himself up into a sitting position. I finally reached my phone and flipped it open. Just as I thought. Well you see, I coughed I only took two weeks off and that little stunt of your mothers in capturing me was after the two weeks. I got up and began pulling on clothes. Oh shit you have work dont you. He laughed. Shut up! It is not funny. I twirled my hair around and up into a bun. Shauna was working so I knew she wouldnt mind if I was late. Oh Rex you are in so much trouble. I threw on the rest of my clothes and by the time I got back Rex was still sitting in the bed, sheet draped over him and a sketchpad in his hand. What are you drawing? I whispered and he shook his head. Go to work sweetie. Remember we are meeting with Octavius and Cleo tonight. I kissed him and ran out to the car. I flipped open my phone and dialed Shauna. The phone rang twice before she answered. Hello? A groggy voice answered. God is it that boring at work? Anya get your ass here. I can only cover you so much. Shauna warned. Im coming and I have some crazy news for you. Cant wait. She perked up. Better be here in ten minutes or you are done. See you soon. I clicked the phone closed and started the SUV. I pulled out of the driveway, speeding off to work. I clicked the radio and blasted it on the highway. How on Earth would I explain everything that happened? Oh yeah well you see Rexs mother is a raging bitch who wants him with Krystie so they can rule the clan together. Nope. The clouds floated across the bright blue sky and a smile pulled at my lips. Work was slow for some reason. It was a thursday, not our busiest days, but the parking lot lacked the normal slew of cars. I parked and grabbed my things before walking inside. Shaunas beaming face was the first thing to meet me but then it turned into a frown. Good god honey, what happened? Oh shit, I forgot coverup. I let out a small laugh. Can I borrow any? She wrapped her arm around mine and pulled me to the offices. Tell me everything.  --**--  After a few interruptions and upset customers, I had finally told the whole story to Shauna. She stood there for a minute, thinking I was kidding. Seriously? She scoffed. I could see in her eyes she didnt truly believe me. If you dont believe me ask Octavius. He was there. I crossed my arms and raised an eyebrow at her. Oh I believe you. Oct wouldnt tell me anything when he got home, just said you got yourself into something. I got myself into something? Excuse me? Rex got me into this. I am still pissed about it. Shauna laughed and leaned back in her chair. I hear on the way home you passed out and Oct and Rex had a chat about what happened though. He didnt tell me but did say that he probably wouldnt be talking with his mother for a while. He was on good terms with his father though. Thank god something good came from this. I laughed and closed my eyes. The walkie blipped in my ear and I groaned. You know I figured everything would stop after I figured everything out. Apparently Krystie wants to talk to me. Shauna laughed and got up. I want to hear this. I grabbed my clipboard and made my way over to bakery with Shauna in tow. There was a line at deli so Shauna said she would go help out. I groaned at having to face Krystie alone. I walked over to the counter and smiled, her beady little eyes looked over at me. Whats up Krystie? She looked up from her cake and smiled. She brushed her hands on her apron and tucked her hair back into her hairnet. Well I heard what happened and just wanted to clear the air is all. She had the same smile as May and I felt a twinge of anger flare up. Okay. So clear it. I gripped the clipboard in my hands to relax myself from freaking out at her. She looked back at her cake and began decorating it once more. It is clear. She spoke and focused on her cake. I made a face but Shauna was next to me and I shrugged. Come on. I need some coffee. I smiled and walked with Shauna. She isnt that good at saying sorry. Shauna just laughed and grabbed two coffees from the little cafe that was tucked in the right hand side of the store. It was great to grab something to eat from there and step outside of the store even if only for a split second. Have you heard anything about the ceremony yet? Her question took me by surprise. Oh man, we were both getting married werent we? I shook my head. So much had happened I didnt even realize the ceremony was coming up. Oct has been talking about it. He is so excited. Rex is his best friend. He cant believe we are getting married the same day. I smiled over at her and nodded. Well the real reason we were getting married the same day was because it only came around once a year, but I wont tell her that. Four months. I whispered. Are you coming out with us tonight? I asked trying to change the subject. We settled into our seats back in the office and I gave her a hopeful look. Yeah. We are going with Cleo right? Oct says she needs to find someone. I think he just wants to go to a bar and wants an excuse. I smiled and laughed at her response. Sounds like Oct. Cleo is wicked nice though. She talked to me first about everything. She told me before Rex about the immortality thing. Shauna nodded and smiled. At least the whole clan wont be there. Will they? I shrugged. It seemed the clan just popped up when they wanted to. Shauna and I called them a clan because we didnt know what to call them. It always made Rex angry but they did kind of work like a wolf pack. I suppose a pack is different than a clan though. They had the alpha, Octavius, and everyone listened to him. There were sup alphas like Rex also. My phone lit up and I smiled. Time to go home. Shauna looked up at the clock. Damn the time went by fast. She laughed and we walked to our cars. I looked at a manager walking through towards the office. He was a stout man with a bowl haircut. I gave Shauna a look. They hired him when you were on vacation. I looked at him once more before continuing towards the car. Lots of thing happened I see. Ill see you at the bar? She hugged me. Dont die okay? I laughed and climbed up into the car. I turned the engine over and turned around to back up but something was in the back seat. I let out a yelp but realized it was Rex. What the fuck Rex? His hearty laughter boomed from the backseat as he got into the front. He kissed my forehead and put his hand on my thigh. So what is this special occasion? I asked as I pulled out of the driveway and got onto the highway. Well Cleo got the time wrong and is at the bar so I figured I would come pick you up. He raised an eyebrow before pulling me close and kissing me. When I mean pick you up I mean sneaking into the car after Octavius dropped me off. He smiled that prize winning smile. Babe! I am trying to drive. He laughed and put his hand back on my thigh after I pushed it off. I suppose you brought me clothes then? I dont want to go in this. I motioned to my work clothes. How long have you been with me, woman? You should know by now the answer to that question. His voice whispered into my ear. Woman? I laughed and pulled into the bar. You better treat me nice. I glanced around the crowded bars parking lot and let out a sigh. A box appeared in front of me as Rex got out of the car. In peeked in the box and bit the inside of my lip as I saw the sparkling sequins. What is this? I asked as he opened my door. He smirked and grabbed my hand, pulling me towards the bar without answering my question. The bar was bustling with people, strobe lights danced around the walls and the bass pulsed in a steady rhythm. I made my way to the bathroom and felt a sigh of relief to see Cleo and Shauna there. Not ready yet? What is wrong with you? Cleo flashed me a smile. She was sitting up on the counter, her legs crossed over each other. She had skinny black jeans with rips among them, a blank tank top with a fishnet shirt over it. I pulled open the box and looked up at Shauna. Something sexy I presume? She rose an eyebrow at me. She herself had curled her hair, sending tendrils down her back. Her shirt was cut right before her belly button and she wore a short skirt with leggings. I pulled out the sequin tube top and skinny jeans and frowned. I am going to stick out like a sore thumb. Cleo threw her head back and laughed. I pulled the clothes on and fixed my hair. Okay lets go. As soon as the door opened I could feel the strong bass taking over my body. The music roared through my head. At first a twinge of pain filled my head but soon ebbed. I found my way to Rex and Octavius who were sitting smugly at the counter. You are looking better Anya. Oct nodded his head towards me. I felt a laugh escape my lips as I slid into the seat next to Rex. Well its not everyday that I get into bitch fights. I am normally a calm person. I smirked and ordered a cosmo. Rex laughed in my ear and Cleo motioned us towards a table. We clung together in a group and made our way towards where Cleo was. The music had seemed to get quieter as we made our way to the back of the club. Rex pulled me close against him and Shauna sat in Octs lap. Cleo sprawled out on her chair and smiled. So we need to talk about the ceremony? I heard Cleos voice raise over the music. I leaned forward onto the table. She seemed so intensely interested in this specific topic. We had a few months, I dont understand what she was freaking about. There seems to be a few problems is all. She shrugged at the look I gave her. What kind of problems? Octavius thick voice cut through the rising music. His arm wrapped tighter around Shauna. She just let her head lay in the crook of his neck. Cleo laughed a slightly shrill laugh and bit the inside of her lip before speaking. I hadnt noticed until now that she had gotten the left side of her lip pierced. A small metal stud clung just below the outline of her lip. Well Rex, you should know the answer to this one. I heard a groan erupt from his chest and slowly turned my head back towards him. Im assuming it is May then? Cleo nodded in approval and I felt myself groan alongside him. What now? Her laugh echoed through the bar once more and she adjusted herself in her seat. Apparently there is this old rule that if an arranged marriage had been approved, it is set before anyone else. In other words Rex has to get married to Krystie since it has already been foretold. She emphasized the word has and I felt the blood drain from my face. My hand found its way to my drink and I chugged the whole thing. Spouting out coughs at the end Rex patted my back. That is not going to happen. My stern voice met Cleos. I didnt make the rules! She frowned and got up from the table. She made her way towards the dance floor, finding someone and beginning to dance. I stood shocked at the whole aspect. Apparently she stayed just long enough to tell us the bad news. Shaunas voice came from behind me. She took the now empty seat next to me and hushed her voice. You going to be okay? Be okay? I screamed. Do you realize how much shit you have put me through Rex? I turned towards him. Babe, dont worry. Im marrying you not her. I felt frustration creeping over me. It was slowly consuming my body. I just got over his psycho parents and now this happens? Some crazy rule that he has to marry Krystie! I was so done with this bullshit. My body seemed to shut down, one part at a time, enabling me to move. Rex had me pulled into his chest in a second. I could smell the deep smell of the forest and tried to relax. I pushed him away, swearing a few words and made my way to the outside. I didnt know what to do. I couldnt do anything. I soon found myself running, heels thrown behind me at the bar. I heard him yelling my name but kept running. The wind blew past my hair, tangling it from its previous state. My feet began to hurt from the gravel but I pushed on.  --**--  Haku made his way through the bar and sat down in a corner booth. His baggy black pants and open button white shirt seemed to sparkle under the lights. He watched as Cleo made her way to the dance floor. He stood up, about to ask her for a dance but saw Enrique walk over to her. He let out a grumble and sat back down. Enrique had tight black dress pants and a dark blue dress shirt. He walked over to Cleo and tapped her on the shoulder. When she turned around her eyes lit up. May I have this dance senorita? He smirked and she took his hand. His hands rested gently on her hips as they swung to the music. She raised an eyebrow at his behavior. What? I cant dance with you? She shrugged and stepped closer, their stomachs touching. You are just... I didnt think you liked me like that. She looked up at him. Excuse me? He laughed. I am just dancing with you. How does that mean I like you? She looked taken aback and looked down at the ground. She felt a shock go through him and looked up. He stroked her cheek gently. Dont listen to him. He whispered in a less spanish accent. Gabriel? She gasped and smiled. Did you make him dance with me so you could dance with me? A small smile tugged at her lips. He rested his head against her forehead and smirked. So what if I did? He let out a deep sigh, the music relaxing him. He pulled her closer and her head buried into his chest. She always loved when it was Gabriel and not that prick Enrique. He held her close against him and smiled. She lost herself in the moment, in the music, in everything. I wish you didnt die. She whispered. He stopped dancing and pulled away a little bit. He looked into her big eyes. Me either. He whispered back. He leaned forward, his lips almost touching hers but then he stopped. Something didnt feel right, something wrenched his gut. Maybe it was the fact that this never could come to be. Maybe it was the fact that he didnt want to lead her on. He wasnt sure but he knew that he had to stop. Im sorry. He pulled away and walked off of the dance floor and out of the building. Haku watched the drama and looked over at Cleo. Her face had turned from a light pink of happiness to a deep shade of red from embarrassment. She walked off of the dance floor and stopped in front of Haku. Haku? She whispered, a tear strolling down her cheek. He stood up and pulled her into a hug. At first she stayed rigid, scared of being in his arms, but then she relaxed and wrapped her arms around him. He hugged her tight and whispered encouraging words in her ear. She looked up at him, her eyes welled with tears and her mouth gaped, not sure what to say. Lets go outside. He smiled and took her hand in his. He pulled her away from the noisy bar and sat down outside on a picnic bench. You okay? He wiped a lonely tear and smiled up at her. She nodded. Just girly stuff. She let out a scoff. I shouldnt have been so stupid is all. Haku shook his head no and cupped her face. Dont act like that. You didnt do anything wrong okay? He is just... He is... yeah. He smiled a friendly smile. She moved closer on the bench as he wrapped his arm around her. Thank you. She whispered. He went to kiss the top of her head but she looked up at him just when he did. They lips caught but she didnt pull away. Their lips together sent a lightning effect through her body. At first she was startled by the sudden kiss, squeezing her hand tight against his but she then slowly released it. He pulled away gently and looked at her, worried he had done something wrong. She smiled up at him his smile soon followed. Was that bad? He whispered. She looked at him with a smirk on her face. Leaning forward she pressed her lips against his, ultimately answering his question. He pulled her tight against him, winding his fingers through her hair. He stroked her cheek with his other hand. When he pulled away he looked into her eyes. The once plain eyes swirled with specks of silver. His own eyes seemed to be bursting at the iris. She smiled up at him. Now how come I havent done that sooner? He whispered. A giggle escaped her lips in response.  --**--  I found myself at a small park, hidden away from the road. I slunk down onto the bench and caught my breath. Every time I exhaled a stream of white came from my mouth and nose. I hadnt realized how cold it had gotten. I let my head fall into my hands and tears flowed down my cheeks. The wind whipped through my hair as my tears stained the dirt beneath. Whenever something bad would happen I would run, whether it be from the problem or literally run. Somehow it always seemed to clear my mind just enough that I could fix the problem. I felt something touch my shoulder and my body tensed up. It will be okay. A familiar female voice washed over me. I felt a calm settle into my bones as I turned my red face towards her. How can you say that? My voice quavered when I spoke to her. She settled herself down onto the bench next to me. A soft smile filled the older womans face. Her hair was down tumbling along her back, and she wore jeans and a loose shirt. I know I look a lot different than last time. She laughed. I usually dont make house calls. Well I suppose you could say this is a forest call. I smiled briefly and leaned back against the bench. I know you are worried about what is going to happen but you need to relax. I scoffed. Relax! How am I supposed to relax? Krystie is going to marry Rex. I cant even fathom who made up that. Marge adjusted herself on the bench and looked towards the trees, blowing in the distance. I made it up. She spoke after a moment of silence. Have I told you my story yet? I glanced over to her and shook my head. A smile pulled at her lips. I am the oldest, you know that much. I am the original Immortal. I was created so long ago you probably didnt even know people were alive back then. I was created by the Gods to be a sort of liaison between the mortals and the immortals. I had the original strain of tainted blood as they called it. I kept the immortals in check and made sure they wouldnt give away themselves. The mortals needed to know nothing about what was going on and I was the one to make sure that is how it stayed.I looked over at her and let out a small sigh. If you dont want to hear it... No, sorry. Please continue. She let out a cough and she crossed her arms as she began talking. Well since I was created and not born I didnt hold many human emotions. I soon began becoming attached to the humans for the fact that I so longed for their emotions. Eventually I found one mortal who seemed to figure out the difference between me and the mortals. He and I had become romantically involved, which was another rule I broke. Once the immortals found out I was denied the chance to see him anymore. They told me that if he wasnt taken care of that he would be killed. This broke my heart and I broke away from them, telling him that he had to find a safe place and forget everything I had told him. She stopped talking for a moment and I thought I saw a tear roll down her cheek. The last thing I remember he was holding me, telling me everything would be fine. Then a sword sliced down his cheek. I told him to run, to never be near me again. They brought me back to the Gods and wiped emotions from my system once more. That was when I brought up the idea of arranged marriages, totally forgetting what had happened before. I had no remembrance of what had happened, what love felt like and what a lover was. It took me a long time to remember my old life as I call it. If the Gods knew I knew about it I wouldnt still be here. Ever since then I had decided to embrace what the Gods wanted and just keep other stuff on the down low. Did you have an arranged marriage? My voice had miraculously come back to life as I listened to her story. That is the one good thing about my position. I had the right to say who would be matched with who. I practically picked my marriage. That was the only good thing that came through it. I married Jack. You probably havent seen him though. He doesnt come out much. He likes to stay at the house. She laughed a little, looking over at me to hold my gaze. I have a say in who gets married to who. If you love him, you will be fine. I felt my eyebrows turn into a questionable look and she smiled once more. I told you it would be fine. You couldnt just tell me that? I exclaimed. No. It is more believable with the story. Nobody knows my story either so dont go spreading it around. She brushed the hair from my face in a motherly way. I rubbed my eyes and looked up at the large moon in the sky. Why would Krystie and Rex be a good couple? I asked hesitantly. To make a new pack. To make, you know, babies for a new pack. She ran her hand through her hair as the wind picked up once again. I heard the crackling of footsteps on the leaves but she put her hand on my arm. No need to worry. It is just Jack. A tall man with a cloak appeared next to us. I looked up and smiled at him. The moon caught the side of his face where a long scar slid down his cheek. I cocked my head to the side a bit and Marge winked at me. I suppose it is time for me to go. Just remember what I said okay? Jack took her hand and pulled her up. I nodded up at her and smiled. Before I could say anything they were gone and I was sitting on the bench in the night alone.         The taxi pulled up to the house and I hopped out. Thanks. I handed the driver money. When I turned around Rex was in front of me. I heard the taxi drive away as Rex pulled me against him. Dont ever do that again. His husky voice filled my ears. I smelt his fresh scent and wrapped my arms around him. I fought back the urge to cry as he pulled me against him harder. He picked me up and carried me inside. I slid my arms around his neck and buried my face into his neck. He held me so tight against him I thought I wouldnt be able to breathe. He eventually sat down on the couch, caressing my face. I was so worried sweetie. I was fine. I whispered as tears finally fell. He wiped them away with his thumb. You dont look fine. He ran his hands through my hair and his lips were on mine hot and needy. My body melted in his touch and I curled into him more. Please dont do that again. I thought you were in trouble. He whispered. I stroked his worried face as he kissed my forehead. I was talking to Marge. He nodded as if it was a normal thing. She found me and calmed me down. She does that. He whispered, still stroking my hair. I smiled and hugged him. Im sorry, I was just really upset. I was too. You missed it. He let out a low chuckle. I threw a couple tables over at the bar. Baby! I giggled and hit him on the shoulder. What! I cant be protective? He smiled a cheeky grin and kissed me once more. We will get through this. I know. I got up from his grasp and made my way to the fridge. I opened it and grabbed a beer, drinking it quickly. Didnt think of you to be a beer type. Rex laughed behind me. He held out his hand for a beer of his own and I handed it to him. So what? A smirk played on my lips. It is just a different side of you is all. He placed his hand on my hip and pulled me closer. His lips were on mine again. I missed you so much. He murmured between kisses. I giggled and let him lay the kisses on me. I missed you too baby. I looked up at his piercing blue eyes and smiled. I didnt mean to worry you. He pulled his glasses off and placed them and his beer on the table behind us. He tried to pull me into his arms but I ran away. What! Come back. His laugh rang out through the house as I ran to the bedroom. I jumped onto the bed and pulled the covers over my face. I heard the door open and bit my lip. Rex jumped on top of me and my body shook with laughter as he tickled me. Rex, stop! I squealed. He pulled the covers off and kissed my forehead. I hate it when you tickle me! He buried his prickly chin into my neck. Giggles escaped my lips again as I rolled him over and wrapped my hands around him. His hand slid down my side and rested on my hip. Any luck on the baby making yet? He raised an eyebrow. I smiled but shrugged. Not that I know of. His face looked so sincere, his eyes a burning blue. He had small lines escaping from around his eyes. I frowned and rubbed them. I thought you dont show signs of aging. I smirked. Well I am not supposed to. It is probably because I was so worried about you. That cheeky grin surfaced once more. Youre silly. His lips were on mine and my body molded against his. His hand traveled up and tangled itself in my hair. His other hand rested on the small of my back. So what did Marge say? Anything useful? His calm voice broke the silence. I could still feel his hot breath on my lips. I felt goosebumps rise on my arms Just stuff. She told me about her life. His face softened and he laid his head back on his pillow. You know that means she likes you. She never talks to anyone she doesnt like. I leaned back against my own pillow and snuggled into the bed. When was the first time she talked to you? He brushed the hair from my face and smiled at me. He let out a sigh and scrunched his eyebrows together. I think it was when I met Oct. When we were ready to begin our own group. We met her and she didnt take too kindly to Octavius at first. Something about the fact at how horrible his attitude is. He smiled and pulled my hand up to his lips. Eventually they got over it. She is very quiet though and when she says something interesting, it usually means something important. I pulled the covers up around us and smiled up at him. She told me about how she found love. It was quite interesting. You met Jack then. That is a true love story. Then he isnt immortal right? I scooted closer and whispered. He is the one who she was in love with and they said that they couldnt be together. He is now. I ran my hand over Rexs head. What? Did he marry in? How though! The Gods knew! Rex laughed and kissed me gently, cupping my face before I could ask anymore questions. I dont know and if I did I probably couldnt tell you. I whined and felt myself yawn. Guess it is time for bed. He pulled me close against him. I draped my arm across his stomach and rested my head on his chest. I love you Rex. I love you too Anya.           The morning sun shone on my face. I groaned and pulled the covers around me as I twisted my body in the bed. Rex was gone, I remember he said he had said he had a few appointments today. I got up from the bed and ran my hand through my messy hair. I made my way to the kitchen and skidded to a stop. I stood there in panties and a wife beater, my hair in a mess and makeup rubbed across my face. What the fuck are you doing here? Krystie turned around and leaned against the cabinets. She was wearing a black sequin dress with heels. Her pink lips crooked up into a smile. Well hello to you too princess. I came to get you. Today is the day we have to do shopping for the ceremony. Her voice dripped with honey. Ugh. Cant Cleo take me? I grabbed a cup and poured coffee into it. I dunked some cream in it and took a gulp. Sorry. We both have to go shopping. Who knows who will marry Rex. They still havent given a final remember? She raised a perfectly arched eyebrow and I downed the rest of my coffee. Whatever. I sent a cold look her way. Go wait in the car. I will meet you there. I waved my hand at her and stepped into the bathroom. I locked the door and opened my phone. I punched in Rexs number and sent him a nasty text message. I stepped into the hot shower. My phone chirped to life but I ignored it. Cant believe he let that dumb bitch in. Or did she have a key? Anger rose higher inside of me and I took a couple deep breaths. After I washed my hair and my body I stepped out and glanced at the text message. Whats wrong babe? I grumbled and sent a reply back. Your arranged marriage was here in the kitchen when I woke up. I twisted my hair and threw it up into a bun. I pulled on a black summer dress and stepped out of the kitchen. I grabbed my keys and purse and made my way outside. She was sitting in her brand new car. I scoffed and climbed into my own car. She turned her car on and pulled out of the driveway. My phone chirped and I grumbled at it. What?! Why would she be there? I shook my head. Apparently we have to go shopping. I closed the phone and took off from the driveway. We arrived at the bridal shop and I felt my stomach grow deeper. I got out and slung my purse over my shoulder. I had never bought designer dresses let alone a wedding dress. When I got marrie the first time I was measured and somebody bought my dress as a present. We stepped into the bridal shop to find a very happy woman announce our arrival. This was hectic. There were dresses everywhere. Krystie! So nice to see you! The plump woman embraced her. She was wearing black slacks and a bright purple shirt. This must be Anya. She wrapped her stubby arms around me and I froze. So nice to meet you darling. She slurred out the darling and I smiled weakly. Off to some dresses then! She pulled us towards a long row of dresses. It was an explosion of white in front of my eyes. Some had straps, some were strapless; some were puffy, some were sleek. I didnt even know what to do with myself. I was thrown into a dressing room. A dress found itself around me and I was in front of the mirror. A dress with rows of ribbon twirling down it now consumed me. A halter top wrapped around my neck and I couldnt see my feet from the voluminous tulle. No. I want a silk dress, off the shoulder, with intricate beading. The woman, whom I still havent caught her name yet, put her hand on her hip and nodded. Get back in there. She threw four dresses over the side and told me to try them on. I grabbed the first one and shook my head. I leafed through them until I found one I liked. I slid into it and smiled. It was the perfect dress. The strap slid over my shoulder and it fit my body perfectly. The beading trailed down my side and off to my hip. From there it traveled to my left leg and down where it trimmed the bottom of the dress. I twirled it around a little bit and smiled. I changed back into my normal clothes and threw the dress at the woman. Ill take that to go please. She took the dress and looked at me confused. You tried on two? How do you even expect to pay for this? This is the third most expensive dress I have. Her voice turned into a shrill as she got upset. Her face reddened and I just smiled. I have a guy, and he has this thing called a credit card. I leaned in close to her. He has a lot of money. I whispered. So if you would, I would like it to go please. I smiled and she stood still for a moment before putting my dress into a box. I looked over at Krystie who had been trying on many dresses. She was currently in a dress with poof everywhere I couldnt even tell where she was. Have fun dandelion. I waved and snatched the dress under my hand. I threw the dress into the back of my car and walked across the street to a coffee shop. The city was different than my little country town. The smell of fast food burned into my nostrils. The air felt muggy and the sky had smog. I settled down into a chair after I grabbed a coffee and a donut. Everyone else in the room can see it, everyone else but you, baby you light up my world like nobody else, the way you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed. I dug through my purse as I heard my ringtone chime in the quiet coffee shop. Hello? I answered before looking at who it was. Hey, its Cleo. Can we talk? I took a sip of my coffee and nodded to myself. It totally needed more sugar. Yeah I am at Coffee Works on 5th ave. Sweet Ill be there in like 15 minutes. Thanks. No problem. See you then. I closed the phone and placed it on the table. Outside the bustling people had slowed down. Only a few people walked among the streets. The street was nice when there wasnt anyone on it. It was like a small city in and of itself. Next to the bridal shop was a grocery store surrounded by a few more small shops. Mainly it was antique shops and mom and pop restaurants but it was definitely cute. I wouldnt mind being in a place like this but I needed land. I needed to wake up in the morning to the smell of the dew clinging to the trees. I needed to see birds flying around my backyard. I needed a space to go when I just needed to feel like I was a thousand miles away from the world but really was five steps away from the house. That is what I needed, not a city. I grabbed some more sugar and poured it into my coffee. You know that is so bad for you. I heard Cleos crisp voice behind me. I shrugged at her comment. Well I like sugar, what can I say. I sipped the coffee and made a happy noise. Much better. So what is up? She sat down across the booth from me and drank her iced tea. Well we need to talk about the ceremony. We need to talk about what is going to happen. My stomach lurched slightly. I knew this would eventually come up. I brushed the hair behind my ear and glanced up at her. The sun hit her skin just right that she didnt look pale for once. She didnt have as much eyeliner on as usual and was wearing gray as opposed to black. Well what is going to happen is going to sound pretty confusing but it will make sense when we get there okay? Two nights before you and Krystie will be taken away and put into your own house. You must not kill each other in those two days okay? She laughed and I gave a weakened smile. You will stay at this house while everything gets ready. In this time Marge will be talking to the other elders about who should be with Rex. Obviously it will be you, but they want Krystie to have a fair trial. On the last day they will tell you who will continue on with the wedding. From there on you will be able to meet with the women of the pack. We will be the ones getting you ready. Rex will have the men of the group. After that is when we start the ceremony. It wont be like a normal wedding but it will make sense as we go. They will walk you through it. Have you guys decided what will be your binding tattoo? I bit the inside of my lip and shook my head. No we havent. Damn, I knew I was missing something. Make sure you have it ready. Oct needs to know what to tattoo. She smiled and leaned back in her chair. You nervous? As nervous as I am ever going to be. Yep. I frowned at my empty coffee cup and leaned back in my chair as well. She placed a hand on my shoulder. You will be fine. Dont even bother getting nervous. She fidgeted with her cup and I looked over at her. Cleo are you okay? She shook her head no and looked up at me. Well its about Gabriel, or rather Enrique. She let out a soft sigh and frowned. Gabriel came out last night and asked me out to dinner. By the time we were going to dinner he turned back into Enrique. He was about to kiss me. Her cheeks turned pink as she said this. Oh sorry honey. I frowned. There isnt any way for Gabriel to get his own body? I whispered. What even happened do you know? She ran her hand through her curly hair and pulled it back into a bun. Yeah. I know a lot more than anyone gives me credit for. The thing is, something else happened also. I raised an eyebrow at her. I need some more iced tea though. Refill? I nodded and handed her my cup. She walked to the desk and got two more. I felt so bad for her, she fell for the one person nobody could have. She sat back down and handed me my coffee. After Enrique and Gabriel figured out the immortality they got into a huge fight. Their mother ended up dying and Gabriel was a mommys boy. He couldnt take it. Between that, his father not talking to him and his brother mad at him it was too much. Nobody knows how he did it and I dont think anyone ever will. She became quiet for a minute, just watching the people outside. We had gone on a date before he died. I really liked him but I never knew what he thought. I guess he likes me though right? He did ask me on a date. She smiled up at me but I could see the pain in her eyes. I hope you are doing okay. She nodded. Well thats the thing. She took a long sip of her drink. I thought I was falling for Gabriel, but I also had a date with Haku. I saw her cheeks blush when she spoke his name. Shut up! I giggled. Tell me about it! Nothing really happened. She had a beaming smile plastered on her face by now. He did kiss me though. I think I would rather be with him, give him a chance. I nodded a silent agreement. Thanks for being a good friend Anya. You probably realize I dont fit in with the other girls in the pack. It sucks. Dont worry I am always here. I saw Krystie leaving the bridal shop finally. Oh god it took her forever to pick. Cleo laughed at Krystie as she stuffed the bags into her car. Did you get yours already? Can I see it? Her face lit up when I told her she could. We crossed the road and I opened the trunk to show her. Oh my god it is beautiful Anya. Thanks. I just hope I will be the one wearing it. I played with the soft fabric. I told you not to worry. I have to go though. She pulled me into a hug. I hugged her back and nodded. I have to go too. I have to get to Rexs shop. She squealed and waved goodbye as she hailed a taxi. I made my way back to the car and sat for a moment. I let out a sigh as I looked at the clock. Soon I would be married and soon I would start a new life. Why was I feeling so nervous about it then? What was I scared of? Too many questions filtered their way into my head. I needed to relax. There was no way that they would pick Krystie over me. Right? Through anxiety I made my way home, about halfway there the traffic slowed. I pulled to a stop and grumbled. Ahead of me lay hundreds of cars at a standstill. Luckily next to me was Stone Ave so I pulled the car onto it and sped down it. The trees were hanging low as a rainstorm was beginning to hit. The rain started sprinkling against the windshield only for a minute and then burst into a full pour. Shit. I whispered and slowed the car down. The air had become electric with fresh water streaming from the sky. I pulled the car to a stop at a light and ticked my fingers on the steering wheel impatiently. The light flashed green and I headed straight across the four-way. In a split second my whole world became white. Muffled voices swam in and out of my head in such a blur. My eyelids felt so heavy that I couldnt open them. My body was numb and the voices grew louder.  What the hell happened?  I dont...  ...would that work?  I cant believe you.  It isnt my fault. Please dont do this.  Anya? Anya can you hear me? Rexs voice cut through the garbled voices. My eyelids opened despite my body urging me to stop. A terrible throbbing was slowly filling my numb body. I was wet, from head to toe. Rain was still falling, it felt so heavy when it touched me. Anya, dont move baby. What happened? My voice was hoarse and I felt something trickling down my forehead. I tried to move my arm but it seemed to be bound down. Rex stroked the top of my forehead and looked around for something. I heard Octavius voice but couldnt understand what he was saying. A females voice filled my head as I saw someone push Rex out of the way. I reached for him but my arms were still bound. I blacked out once more. Everything was silent, everything seemed calm. I felt I was in a dream but nothing seemed to appear. When the blackness ebbed and pain overtook me I woke from my sleep. A strong sanitizing smell filled my nostrils and it was very bright. My arms had been freed and I put one over my head to cover the lights. Once my eyes had adjusted I looked up. Square ceiling tiles masked above me. I looked around and found myself in a hospital bed. I looked down and gasped at my body. My right leg was wrapped up, my left arm was in a brace and when I touched my forehead I inhaled as pain throbbed from underneath a bandage. What a great day. I whispered. I tried to push myself up into a seated position but my arm hurt too bad. There were many machines around the hospital bed. I had three IVs in my right arm and monitors on my chest. I heard a rustle and glanced over to the right of the be. There, crumpled in a chair, lay Rex. His glasses were still on, creases spiraled across his face from stress. I leaned back in the bed and tried to remember what happened. I closed my eyes and saw myself in the car once more. It was raining out, the sky was so black I couldnt see anything. I came to a stop at the light, when it turned green I pulled forward. Pain rocketed through my body once more as I couldnt remember what happened next. I felt someones hand on my shoulder and pulled back a little alarmed. Anya. Rex whispered. I opened my eyes and turned towards him. Rex what happened? He stroked my wrist and pulled his glasses off. You dont remember? I shook my head no and rolled over on the pillow to look at him better. He let out a sigh and sat on the bed next to me. You got into an accident. He motioned to my body and I bit the inside of my lip. You were pulling out and some drunk guy hit you. They say it was a miracle you survived. I felt a sickening feeling fill my stomach. A drunk driver? Miracle I survived? How did I survive? I whispered. Rex ran his hand over his head and looked up at me. His eyes were a mossy green color, one I had never seen before. Usually they were stormy blue or a brilliant blue. I pulled his hand up to my chest and held it in my own. How Rex? I whispered once more. You didnt survive Anya. What? Rexs face distorted in front of me. His forehead grew shorter, his eyes turning to a coffee color. A scream tore from my throat as his body shifted in front of me. Soon Brian was sitting in front of me. I stood shocked as a wicked laughter rose from his throat. No. I whispered. No. My voice rose and my arms were bound once more. I struggled to free myself. A syringe was pulled from a drawer and inserted into my IV. No. Dont do this Brian. A wicked smile appeared on his face and a burning sensation took over my body. The pain started in my toes and made its way up my body. A slow burning pain before I was stuck in darkness once more. No. I whispered. My eyes fluttered open and I was in the hospital room once more. I pulled myself up into a sitting position automatically. I saw Rex to the side and surveyed the room. Anya? Are you okay? He reached out to touch me but I withdrew from him. Anya its okay. He smiled reassuringly. I nodded and realized I had been suckered into a dream. I let out a soft sigh and smiled back at him. What happened? I rubbed the back of my head and touched my face where the bandage was. I winced silently and looked back at Rex. You were in a car accident. I nodded and took his hand in my own. You were driving and a car plowed into you. It was a miracle you survived. I looked down, knowing he would say that. I leaned back in the bed and looked over at him. I touched his face gently. Did you stay here the whole time? I whispered, my voice breaking. He leaned over and kissed my lips gently. I am right here baby. He whispered and stroked my forehead. So you sprained your ankle and chipped a bone in your wrist so you had to have surgery to take it out. He leaned in closer to me, the bed squeaking as he did so. You ruined the escalade pretty bad too. He had a wicked smile on his face when he said it. I smiled and leaned back against the pillow. Oops. I told you I didnt want your car anyway. Well I guess you get a new car. I hear a knock on the door and turned over to see a nurse standing there. Good to see you are up. How are you feeling? I nodded and she came over to the bed. May I take a look at your wrist? Rex released it and I handed it towards her. She unwrapped it, dried blood was fastened to the wrapping. A pain overwhelmed my arm as she unwrapped it. I looked down at my wrist. It was swollen, stitches played their way along my wrist in a zigzag pattern. She touched it a few different times and I bit the inside of my lip as she did so. Eventually she wrapped it back up. It looks okay. You should be able to go home tomorrow. If you get hungry you can either call me and I can bring you food or if you feel like walking we can go down to the cafe. Just push the nurse button okay? Thank you. I stretched my fingers and frowned at Rex. So you are getting me another car? I raised an eyebrow. He cupped my face in his and pressed his lips against mine. I could feel the hesitancy in his kiss. He was afraid he would hurt me. I pressed my lips back against his. I could feel his lip tremble against mine. Whats wrong? I whispered. He kept my head in his hands and looked into my eyes. His were a bluish green. I was worried. There is too many things happening lately. I dont want anything to ever hurt you. I nodded and kissed his forehead. I cleared my throat. What happened to the person who hit me? Rex looked away from my gaze. He didnt make it. Oh. I fiddled with my fingers before pulling Rex over to me and hugging him. I think I would like something to eat. I smiled up at him as my belly rumbled. He stood up and held his hands out towards me. I moved my legs over and looked up to Rex. Crutches? I got you. Dont worry. He smiled and weaved his arms at me. I gingerly moved my legs until they were dangling from the bed. I leaned my weight onto one leg and held onto Rex. A smirk caught my lips as I felt his muscles tighten when he grabbed me. You been working out without me? I let out a low giggle and wrapped my arm around his neck. Slowly but surely I made my way out of the room and we made our way to the cafe. About halfway there I got yelled at for not using a wheelchair and against my better judgement they forced me into one. Rex. I groaned as he insisted on pushing me. I covered my face, my cheeks turning a pink color. The cafe was at the other end of the hospital. It opened up to a large area with circular tables and an assortment of food. There were huge bay windows and a porch outside. Can we sit on the porch? I whispered and he wheeled me over to the porch. What do you want to eat? He kissed the top of my head. Anything is fine. He smiled and took off towards the food. I looked outside at the busy traffic. The sun was just as bright as in my room. The parking lot was lurking just outside and I saw a tow truck. I leaned forward as I saw it pull the Escalade up onto it. The front end was smashed it, the right side was so smushed in you couldnt tell which part used to me what. Darling! Are you okay? I heard a voice behind me and stayed still. Arms flailed around my shoulders and I saw Shaunas hair. Yeah I am fine. I smiled and her and Octavius sat down across from me. Octavius looked out the window and watched as the tow truck drove away. He let out a loud whistle and smiled at me. Rex is going to be pissed. He muttered. I nodded. I did a good job huh? Rex returned with a triumphant noise. He set down a sandwich, a soda and pudding in front of me. Rex plopped down next to Octavius and handed him a soda. So you are okay right? I mean you did something crazy. Shauna asked quietly. She grabbed Octavius drink and took some. Rex smiled at the two of them and ripped open his sandwich. I smiled up at the group and bit into my own sandwich. I am fine Shauna. I chewed my sandwich and looked over at Oct. He leaned over towards Rex and whispered something into his ear. I kicked Rex with my good leg and he smiled at me. What? I asked. Oct was just wondering if you knew how long you were out. You were in a coma for three days. Thats all. He smiled and patted my knee. Three days? I hope I didnt miss much. I gave him a weak smile and took a few more bites of my sandwich. I moved my arm and winced at the pain. Rex shot me a concerned look but I just smiled back. I looked around the table. I was supposed to be married soon and here I was sitting in a hospital. Why was more drama happening lately? All I wanted was a normal wedding and a normal life. I suppose that doesnt happen when you are marrying somebody like Rex. I let out a sigh and glanced outside. The sun was high in the sky, beckoning me towards it. I wished I could just leave this place and sit out on the beach. I looked over to Rex and knew he would do anything for me. Rex can I talk to you for a minute? My voice caught and Oct and Shauna gave each other glances. We will be back in a bit sweetie. Shauna patted my shoulder and they made their way towards the cafe. Rex pulled his chair closer to me and took my hand in his. What is wrong? His eyes were sparkling and I smiled at him. Nothing. I just want you to do me a favor. Can you bring me to the ocean? He scoffed and scrunched his eyebrows together. What? Anya you cant leave the hospital. You are still on IVs. You arent allowed to leave. I pushed away from the table but the wheelchair pushed back further than I thought it would. I squealed and Rex caught me before I rammed into a table. See Anya. He laughed and pulled me towards him. Please Rex. I pleaded. I just need some alone time. It will make me feel better. He sighed, exhausted and looked around the cafe. Give me a second okay? I will get Shauna and Oct to bring you back to your room. Thank you. I smiled and looked behind me and waved at Shauna. You okay? She asked. Yeah I am fine. Can you push me back to my room? She laughed and nodded. As we went down the hallway I noticed the rooms were mostly empty. I was the only son of a gun who had gotten hurt the past few days. When I got back to the room I rummaged around in a bag that had been sitting in Rexs chair. Shauna I dont have any clothes? Oh I brought you some. She pulled out a pair of jeans and a t-shirt. Thanks. She helped me out of the horrendous hospital dress and into normal clothes. I leaned back in the bed, it was exhausting just to change clothes, how would I last at the beach? A knock interrupted my sulking and Rex stood in the doorway. He looked more awake now than he had earlier. His lines had seemed to disappear on his face and he looked like he had shaved. Ready to go beautiful? He smiled and I looked down at myself. I still looked horrendous. At least they let me go I suppose and took the IVs out. Good thing Shauna got me capris they stopped just above the wrap on my leg. My head still hurt but they gave me some pain meds to help with the pain and the bandage was gone. A small gash still was on my head but was less noticeable than the bandage. Somehow Rex got me into the car and I had to move around a few different times to find a comfortable place. I had to lean the chair all the way back and turn my foot to the right. The beach was an hour and a half away and we rode most of it in silence. The trees passed us and eventually it cleared out to houses and soon the ocean came into view. The swelling waves crashed on the rocks and I could smell the salty seaweed waft into the car. I turned towards Rex. He was concentrating on driving. We were in the Nova, he had fixed it up finally. His face had become more chiseled, or maybe it was because I hadnt seen him in days. It seemed his jaw was more pronounced. I touched his face and he smiled. I thought you fell asleep. He whispered. I laughed and looked back out at the ocean. I could feel more relaxed as we got closer. The ocean or ocean noises always seemed to be the one thing that could calm me down through anything. He passed the usual parking. Where are you going? That is where you park Rex. He flashed a smile and I looked around confused. We were making our way towards the big, rich houses. Do you have another house? I whispered. He smirked and just stepped on the gas. The sky was growing darker and I felt tired from all of the driving. It had been two hours by now and we still hadnt stopped. I frowned as the houses went away and the ocean disappeared. I turned to ask Rex but he just shook his head. I closed my eyes and saw the ocean, warm and welcoming. The salty smell caught my nose and my hair flew around from the wind after I opened the window. I stepped into the water and could feel a sense of relief as it washed over my bad leg. I opened my eyes and I was back in the car. I groaned and looked over at Rex. I dont mean to be a pain but are we almost there? He turned the car into a driveway and I did a silent praise. The house was small, unlike his other ones that I knew about. It seemed more like a cabin than anything. I looked over at him confused. There were trees surrounding the house, no ocean near it whatsoever. But...? Rex smiled once more and helped me out of the car. Just wait. We made our way into the house and I wasnt expecting the plain decor inside. There was a black leather couch pushed up to one side, a small kitchen and a bedroom in the back. I smiled up at him but stayed by the door. Come on. We have to go out back. I hobbled my way over to him and he opened the door. The trees made a pathway towards the ocean, a small beach looming behind them. My mouth opened slightly and I looked up at him. But the ocean disappeared so long ago? He smirked and picked me up wedding style. I clenched against him tightly with my good arm. He walked us down to the path. At the end it opened up to a quiet, private beach. There were lawn chairs and a picnic table. He set me down on a chair and I smiled. The sun had just about set, a small burst of sun still shining across the horizon. I hope this is okay. I know it is a lot further. The nurse said you needed to relax a few days. I figured that this would be a good place. He kissed me gently and pulled his chair up next to me. Are you thirsty? I nodded and he handed me a bottle of water. I cant even drink wine! What the hell. I grumbled. His laugh rang out across the quiet beach. Nope sorry. Only water and juice for you. I pouted but took the water. It was quite peaceful here, much more quiet than the beach would be. The waves crashed by my feet, sending water droplets up my legs. I took a sip of the water as Rex sat down beside me. So we need to talk about some things. He gazed off towards the ocean when he spoke. The whole thing about Krystie. I thought that I groaned in my head but apparently I did it out loud. I know you hate her but we should talk about it. Fine. Well you need to just listen please? I looked at him, meeting his gaze and nodded before looking back at the water. When I first met her I didnt know they had secret plans about keeping us together. You cant hold that against me okay? You can hold it against her though, she knew the whole time. They said if they had told me that I wouldnt go through with it, which I obviously didnt. They had wanted me to be the leader but they knew I didnt want to be that. Octavius is the better leader than me any day. I still dont understand why they would want me to be the leader. It must be some hidden agenda? He stopped talking for a minute and rubbed his face. I took his hand and kissed it. Im sorry I brought you into this Anya. You know it wasnt my intention right? I just wanted us to be happy and then when I asked you to marry me I didnt think a bunch of drama would surface. I wish I could take it back. No. I love this. I love the life we are living. I dont want to change it. Well I wish Krystie would leave but that is all. I smiled and looked up at him. Okay. He kissed my forehead. Well I cant promise to get rid of Krystie but I will try alright? Sounds like a plan. A smiled back at him. My smile faded when I realized he hadnt said what he thought would become of this marriage. Do you think she will give up fighting for you? He scoffed. I doubt that. She sets her mind on something and that is all she tries to get. You dont have anything to worry about though. Marge said she would take care of it and she usually does. Dont be scared of that, be happy that she isnt going to get what she wants okay? He smiled at me but I could still feel a sinking feeling inside. What if she won and I didnt? It wasnt a fight, so there wasnt winning and losing, but that is what it felt like. I tried to release the anxiety filling inside of me but it seemed so hard. The wind whipped up from the ocean, sending my hair in all directions. Rex pushed the hair behind my head and kissed my cheek. You will be fine okay? No stressing. I nodded and stayed in the chair. It was nice to relax after so many days filled with drama. I closed my eyes and let the calming sensation overwhelm me. I could feel every knot in my body slowly ease away and my leg and arm felt at ease. I could feel the ocean working its magic. You seem a little less tense. Rexs voice softly rose over the oceans waves. I feel a lot better. I whispered back. The ocean always calms me down for some reason. I didnt grow up by it or anything so I dont understand why it helps but it does. I know the feeling. He pulled his chair closer and wrapped his arm around me. We sat like that for what seemed like forever. It was perfect. I didnt want anything to change. This was what I wanted every day. I wanted his arms around me and a happy feeling engulfing me. I wanted this to be our life. What Krystie didnt know is that I dont give up on what I fight for either. I will fight until there is no fight left in me. The air turned colder and I felt goosebumps raise up on my arms. Do you want a blanket? He asked. I am actually starving. I smiled and looked over at him. Well dinner it is then. He held my hand up and I lifted myself from the chair. I hobbled my way back to the cabin. Once inside I sat on the couch, looking around at the house. Did you buy this? Is it from family? I looked at the pictures There was one of him holding up a fish, he must have been only 7. It traveled down the family. Nobody wanted it but I said I would take it. He began cutting up something and preparing dinner. I like it. I propped my leg up on the couch and flipped the tv on. What is for dinner? Food, duh. I smirked at his smart aleck remark. I flipped through the channels until I found Supernatural. The smell of garlic and salt grew in the air. . Smells good hon. I watched the images flicker on the screen. The show pulled me in as it usually did and I found myself transfixed. This particular episode was to save Dean, one of the main characters, from going to hell. It was really emotional and I found myself gripping the edge of the sofa. A plate of steaming veggies and chicken appeared in front of me. This looks amazing. He plopped on the couch next to me and smiled. I hope so. He popped a chicken into his mouth and I did the same. A burst of flavor found its way to my taste buds when I bit into it. I made a soft noise when I ate the veggies. God why are you such a good cook? He smirked and shrugged. I didnt think I was that good. I have been around for awhile too. I took another few bites and was surprised to see a bottle of wine on the table. He popped it and poured two glasses. I thought I wasnt supposed to have wine? I asked confused as he handed it to me. Well I like to break rules. I took the glass from him and took a sip of it. I let out a low sigh at the delicious food and wine. If this was the life I would be in, I would do amazing. I hadnt worried about work in a while and no stress had come just yet. We finished our dinner, Rex getting awfully into the show I had been watching. When I finally got his attention he held his hands out to me. Bedtime. I whined but he picked me up anyway. We made our way to the bedroom and he laid me down on the bed, propping up my leg with a pillow. He got into bed next to me and kissed my forehead. Now you need to go to sleep or you wont heal. But  His lips were pressed against mine before I could fight him. His lips were smooth on mine, begging in a way. I wrapped one arm around his neck and tried to move my bad arm but he pressed it down so I couldnt move it. His lips continued against mine, a hot mess of emotion overtook me. His hand slid up my neck and cupped my face. Anya. He whispered. I murmured against his kisses and his arms picked me up and against him. He slid my legs open with his knee and positioned himself on top of me. He hit my leg and I cried out. Oh baby Im so sorry. He pulled back immediately and looked up at my face, his eyes full of sympathy. Are you okay? His voice urged. Im fine. Come back. I pulled him back against me, despite his efforts his lips were on mine once more. I could feel the hunger within his body as he positioned himself once more, cupping my face with one hand and sliding his other down my waist. A moan escaped my lips as I felt him press his body against mine. I could feel all of his muscles, his legs moving to get closer to me. He kissed down my neck and bit at my collarbone. I arched my back and tried to hide the pain that was in my arm. Anya, are you okay? He whispered into my ear. I nodded and bit the bottom of his lip. He slid my clothes away from me and slid his hands all across my bare skin. I could feel the ripples of my skin reacting to his hands. My leg had begun throbbing so I kept moving it further and further away. It was now dangling from the bed and Rex stopped. Beads of sweat filled his forehead. This was a bad idea, Im sorry Anya. He whispered. He pulled away and laid on the bed next to me. I let out a whimper and looked at him. Really Rex? I groaned. I wanted this just as much as you did. My leg just feels better over here okay? I whispered. He stayed where he was and I pulled him close. Rex? Please. He simply closed his eyes and laid his arms on his stomach. Rex? Seriously you are just going to lay here? I grumbled and moved myself into a sitting position. Rex stayed still so I got up and waddled my way towards the couch. I plopped down and flipped the tv on. Babe? I heard Rex call but turned the tv up higher. He had managed to make his way in front of the tv and crouched down in front of me. His eyes locked with mine. Im sorry. Im just a little stressed. I set my jaw. He leaned forward and kissed my forehead. Baby, I really am sorry. He whispered. I let out a sigh and nodded. Okay. No being a jerk okay? I smiled and kissed him once more. My body was still filled with electric from earlier. Im really sorry. I am kind of torn up about all this stress too. He whispered before kissing me harder. Dont leave me like that. I grumbled and hugged him. He smiled and scooped me up once more, taking me back to the bed. Promise? I raised my eyebrow at him. He slapped my butt playfully and began kissing me once more. I smirked and pulled him close against me, his chest ragged against me. Our mouths played with each other, tongues swirling around. His rough hands made their way across my body. I felt the electricity consume my body once more. Every time his fingers slid across my hips I felt a shock of pleasure ripple through me. The world seemed to turn gray as I was consumed by pleasure. Rexs hoarse voice rose in my ear before I was plunged into eternal happiness. I felt my body relax and mold into Rexs body. He let out a sigh and kissed the back of my neck. I love you baby. He whispered. I pulled his arms around me and smiled. I love you more. He pushed the hair away from by his face and kissed my shoulder. Im sorry again Anya. He said in a hushed voice. I nodded and pulled him closer.            I woke in the morning to the cool breeze of the ocean. I dressed, grabbed some band aids and made my way to sit out on the beach. Rex was sprawled out on the bed snoring so I knew he wouldnt be up for a couple more hours. The seagulls cried out in the morning but the ocean was calm. I looked down at my leg and arm and sighed. Gingerly I took off the bandage covering up my stitches on my arm. I counted them, seven altogether. I touched the skin, a strange sensation was built up but no pain. It felt odd but nothing out of the ordinary. New skin was already healing over the old and soon would be fine. I put the band aids on the exposed skin and put my leg up. It was feeling a lot better, not so much swelling anymore just the occasional pain in my bone. I closed my eyes and smiled at last night. I just wanted to stay like this forever, nothing changing ever. Rex, my noble husband who worked hard at his job and me a stay at home lady. I wanted children soon. I rubbed my hand over my stomach and bit my lip. When would be time? Would I even make a good mother? I sure hoped so. The wedding was a month or so away and there was still a nervous pang in my stomach. What if? If she was picked I would lose everything. There was no way I could lose anything again. The wind picked up and my hair went spiraling around my face. The image crossed my mind of me without Rex and I felt a single tear slide down my cheek. I couldnt lose my love again. There was no way. I sunk my feet into the warm sand and erased the image from my mind. Rex would be mine and I would fight to the end to be with him. Isnt that what Marge said? Dont give up? I set my jaw and decided there was no way I would be giving up on him. I made my way back into the house and fell onto the bed. Rex jumped up, alarmed and stared wide eyed at me. Are you okay? I giggled and kissed him. Of course. Why do you ask? He stayed still and raised an eyebrow at me. Are you drunk? I made a face and he pulled me against him. Okay. You just are never up this early. I was just thinking. I whispered and kissed his forehead. My chest laid against his and our breathing was in rhythm. I felt so at peace once more. I smiled up at him and his eyes were a stormy color again. How did you sleep? He asked quietly. Fine. This bed is more comfortable than ours. What about you? He laughed and pulled the covers off before getting up. Fine I suppose. He stretched his arms above his head. His bare back was facing me, his tattoos so bright against his pale skin. I traced them with my fingertips. Something about it made them so fascinating. Hey, do you have any idea what our ceremony tattoo is going to be? He pushed himself off the bed and looked back at me. I havent thought of it honestly. He shrugged and held his hands out to me. I grabbed his and he twirled me up and into his arms. You? Nope. I giggled. We should probably get on that huh? I kissed his lips and could feel his grip tighten around me. My body felt an electric pulse go through it, similar to the one before. I looked up at his eyes with a widened expression. We shall decide over lunch? I nodded and felt my body sigh in disappointment as he let go of me. I stretched as well and headed towards the kitchen. The fridge was stocked full of everything you could think of. I rummaged around until I found the coffee. I pulled it out and popped the top off. French vanilla spilled from the can and took over the salty sea smell. I smiled and filled the coffee maker and pushed start. The radio had been on all night and I turned it up louder as a good song came on. I began dancing around the kitchen in my undies and tank top. Dashing from side to side I grabbed some eggs, toast, orange juice and sausage and began cooking. The eggs sizzled as I cracked them and put them into the frying pan. I turned the music up even more and threw the sausages into a different pan. The toast popped up just as I put my hand out for them. I swear, it was like in a movie, they literally popped out of the toaster. Two plates were placed on the counter as I began setting them. I slid across the floor and into Rex. He stood there with a towel wrapped around his lower half, water droplets still sliding down his body. You best be getting out of here mister. Breakfast is not ready yet. He scooped me up and kissed me roughly. Fine. He grumbled after I pushed him away. I returned to my cooking and popped the yolks in the frying pan. A creamy yellow spread and began sizzling alongside the egg whites. Maple from the sausages filled the air. I slid the steaming food onto the plate and set the table before going back to the bedroom. I grabbed a sundress and threw it on. Rex walked out of the bathroom with a white t-shirt and plaid shorts on. We can eat now. I smiled. He grabbed his notebook and a pencil. We sat down and I was impressed at the quick breakfast I had made. I slit the sausage in half and popped it into my mouth. Are you going to figure out a design while we eat or after? I asked when I noticed he was drawing something. He murmured something but I couldnt understand because he had egg in his mouth. His adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed. Would you prefer I do it after? His eyes shone and he made an innocent face. I dont care either way. Another piece of sausage indulged my taste buds. So I was thinking maybe on the back of our legs? Or inside of the wrist? You dont seem to have too many tattoos there. Is it bad I kind of want it to stick out among your other tattoos? I asked the last bit quietly. An evil smirk pulled at his lips but he just shrugged. That is fine. He held out his wrists and grumbled. What about back of the leg? He looked up at me. He swiftly took a bite of the toast and smiled, crumbs falling onto the table. Sounds fine to me. What are you basing it on? He had already drawn a few different things on the paper. A couple looked like hearts, another looked like a rose and the last looked like rings. Im not sure yet. What do you think? It can either be the same or they fit together. His voice grew deeper as he talked. When his voice was deep I had to make myself think straight. It always scrambled my brain and made me want him more. Would a lock and a key be wicked cheesy? His voice didnt change, he just hunched more over his drawing. I took another bite of my food and let him do his work. The music was still pretty loud and I whispered the lyrics to myself. He pushed the drawing towards me a few minutes later and began eating. I looked down and smiled. What people refer to as a skeleton key lay next to an elegant lock. The key had roses surrounding the part where you hold, vines spiraling down the key itself and the end was shaped in a heart. I smiled and looked over to the lock. The lock was in the shape of a heart, victorian decorations surrounded it. The hole matched the keys perfectly. On the border of the lock was an A and a R. How is that? He asked when I didnt say anything. I looked up at him and smiled. Perfect. I finished the food on my plate when I noticed he was done. You sure? You will get stuck with the lock. It might hurt. He winked and I felt like hitting him. Will Octavius be able to do it? I raised an eyebrow. He grabbed my plate and threw them both into the sink. I think he will manage. He slid his chair next to me and pulled me into a kiss. You are major kissy lately. You feeling alright? I pulled away but not far enough that I couldnt feel his lips still on mine. Do you think I am not feeling alright? I just want you to know how much I love you. My cheeks flushed. After all this time he still could make me blush. I love you too. I whispered before succombing to his kisses once more. A knock at the door interrupted us. We exchanged odd glances. I thought nobody knew where we were. I whispered. Rex stood up and walked towards the door as the lonely knock sounded again. I couldnt see the doorway from where I was so I settled down into a kitchen chair. I heard a low mans voice and figured it was Octavius. The door closed a couple of minutes later and Rex was at my side once more. Who was that? I asked. He held up a bundle of envelopes and handed them to me. For you. Apparently you have a lot of mail to sift through. I looked at him confused. What? I pulled the letters close and opened the first one.  Dear Anya, I just wanted you to know that I think it is amazing what you are doing. I always knew you were a great daughter. Dont ever let anyone tell you anything different. Love Mom.  I looked up at Rex and raised an eyebrow. What the? He shrugged and walked away. At first rage filled up my throat but then I ripped open another letter. This one said the same thing. After emotions pouring through me and all of the letters ripped open, tears staining their pages, I let out a sigh. I looked up to see Rex had disappeared while I was reading the letters. Rex? I called out. I stood up from the table, the letters scattering to the floor. I called his name again as I wobbled through the house. I looked out the back door and felt the sea breeze wash over my face. A familiar figure was seated on one of the chairs down by the ocean. I made my way own and Marges face turned to meet mine. Sorry I keep popping up like this, that is just how it works. She smiled and I took the seat next to her. What is it about this time? I asked as I watched the waves crash and wash up onto the beach. Your mother. I turned towards her but her head was straight, looking towards the waves. I stayed quiet for a moment. At first I figure she was just kidding and then the slow realization filled the pit of my stomach. I felt my throat close up. I wasnt one to talk about my feelings, especially about my mother. You need to let go. She whispered. I gripped the chair and shook my head. I cant. It was my mother. The waves crashed closer to us, the tide was coming in. You must. You must be able to let go before you can be with Rex. Do you want to be immortal? Do you want to be with him? People who have lost loved ones often become angry if they become immortal. They go can I go back and make my mom immortal instead? It makes a lot of unnecessary drama. You need to accept the fact that people die. You will see quite a few deaths in your time. You need to be ready for it. I turned my attention back to the ocean and thought about my mother. She wasnt the same before she passed. She had become more irritable and just fought with everyone. Every time I went over something was wrong or somebody had done something she didnt like. Near the end it was hard to bear her but I did anyway, knowing full well if I didnt I would regret it. I see the wheels in your head turning. You had a problem with her, I know. She let out a sigh. I could smell the sweet vanilla in the air as it whipped around her hair. With the sunlight disappearing behind the ocean I could see she had an older face. There were wrinkles but they were stretched against her smooth skin. I hoped that when I became older I would look like her. I know. I just wished we had it better but I understand that I cant bring her back. I bit the inside of my cheek and blew a sigh out of my nose. I think I am okay with it. She turned her head towards me and frowned. We cant go through with this if you arent one hundred percent Anya. For your sake and for Rexs. Rex has come through with his problems of his parents, thanks to you. Now you must realize he is going to be there for you for your problems as well. I nodded and looked down at my hands. I didnt realize I had been twisting my ring around my finger. Marge? My voice came out more as a whisper than I meant for it to. What if I cant get over her? I dont want you to get over her, I just want you to know that you did everything you could and everything is not your fault. She patted my hand. I felt the pattering of rain and looked up at the gray sky. I stood up and held out my hands to help her up but she was already standing. I gave her a brief smile before walking back up to the cabin. When I reached the back door I turned around but Marge had disappeared. A small smile appeared on my face but I hopped inside before I got soaked by the rain that turned into a steady downpour. I glanced around the cabin but Rex still wasnt there. I turned the coffee pot on and changed into an oversized sweater and sweat pants. The crack of lightning sounded out of the window next to me. The coffee pot beeped and I grabbed a cup and poured the black liquid into it. Well dont you just look great. I heard Rexs velvet voice. I turned around, coffee in hand and looked over at him. Somehow he had walked through the rain but wasnt wet at all. He was wearing gray slacks and a white collar shirt. He made his way over to me and wrapped his arms around my waist. Hello there gorgeous. I smirked and kissed him. I am not gorgeous. I am in sweats for goodness sake. He slid his hand through my hair and kissed my forehead. Miss me? He whispered. I heard Marge came by. Did she talk to you? You told her to come didnt you? I hit his shoulder playfully. He gave me a look of astonishment before kissing me. His lips felt soft against mine, I felt like I havent kissed them in forever. His hand cupped my face as he pulled me closer towards him. You didnt answer me. I murmured against his lips. He smirked and kissed my forehead. So what if I did. How are you feeling? I shrugged and made my way towards the couch. You know it is only a month away right? What is? I opened the book I had brought and meant to read the whole time. I only read a few pages so far, nothing worth reading. Our wedding. I glanced over at him. Had it been that long already? Was it only a month away! What was I going to do? I had so much to plan still. I had so much to do and no time to do it. I cant wait. I whispered and smiled over at him as he plopped on the couch next to me.           One month flew by. I couldnt believe it. It seemed just yesterday that I was in that little cottage with Rex. I had been to the doctors against my better wishes, but they had told me that I was recovering fine. I could walk normally now and all of the bruises were gone. The past week I had taken off work to get ready for the ceremony. We still havent figured out who would marry Rex, which constantly made me upset. Today was the day we would know who would be marrying Rex tomorrow. I kept being reassured by everyone that it would be me, there was no way it would be Krystie. Something kept nagging inside of me though. I let out a sigh and looked into the mirror. I rubbed the fog from it and just stared at my reflection. My cheeks had more color than they had a year ago, my hair longer and colored with highlights. My eyebrows were a perfect arch, my eyes themselves a darker, creamier color. My skin had become a more olive color than before. Normally I was quite pale but the sun had done me some good. I had changed so much since I had been with Rex. Nothing could take him away from me now. I pulled the brush through my hair as I debated how to wear my hair. At noon Krystie and I were to meet with Marge to talk about what would happen. They had taken Rex away early this morning to talk with him. It felt so lonely in this house without him. I didnt know what to do with myself. Everytime I turned a corner my heart would flutter, hoping to see him. I was the right choice, not Krystie; I kept telling myself. A song played on the radio as I sunk into a chair. Weep not for roads untraveled, weep not for paths left alone. I took a sip of my coffee and sighed. I wish you were here Rex. I heard my phone ring and I grumbled at first but then thought it might be Rex. I snatched up my phone and answered. Honey? What are you doing? Shauna? I questioned. I flopped onto the couch and pulled a pillow over my head. Why are you calling me? I am on vacation. I just wanted to know if you needed a friend. I could hear her voice quaver at my angry tone. Oh, sorry. That would be really nice. She sighed in the phone and I moved back into the couch. She hung up and I stared up at the ceiling. I wasnt sure if I wanted to keep getting ready or just stay where I was. Depression was sinking into my bones. If Shauna was coming over that must mean that tomorrow was coming faster. I pushed myself off of the couch and walked into the bedroom. It looked like a tsunami had gone through it. I had clothes flown everywhere. I picked out my three favorite dresses. I pushed the rest of the clothes back into the closet and caught a glimpse of my wedding dress. I ran my fingers past the beading on the bodice. I longed for the feeling of the silk on my skin. My hair twirled up and the feeling of walking down the aisle to meet Rex at the altar. I looked down at the dresses on the bed. I had picked out a dark green strapless dress, a black halter top and a deep red dress. I threw the black dress back into the closet and bit the inside of my lip. Green or red, green or red. Rexs voice filled my head. The green brings out your eyes. I smiled and took the dress from the bed. Shauna knocked on the door once I was ready. My heels clacked on the floor and I opened the door. Octavius greeted me and walked into the house. I poked my head out and looked for Shauna. Where is Shauna? I put my hand on my hip. He had settle into Rexs recliner and closed his eyes. Oct had been with Shauna through quite a bit now. They were engaged, as we were, and set to marry with us. They had everything figured out, so I wasnt quite sure why he was now sitting at my house. I walked over to the couch and sat down, crossing one leg behind the other. Octavius? Can I help you? His eyes opened and he leaned forward towards me. Just making sure you are okay and I figured you would want an update. Plus I was told this morning I need to keep you safe, per Rex. My cheeks flushed a bit, of course Rex would do that. Well, update me. I crossed my arms and straightened my back. Rex knows who it will be but is forbidden to tell me. You know that right. So dont ask about that. He told me to keep you safe. He thinks Krystie might do something to even the competition. He isnt sure what but Shauna called to see if you had broke down yet. He smiled and pushed his hand through his growing hair. We both need to get ready though. I see you are pretty much ready. Do you want to grab a coffee while I get ready? I wasnt quite sure what to say. I nodded and grabbed my purse. Octavius stood up and opened the door to outside. Thank god he had brought his Suburban today instead of his convertible. I climbed in and glanced over at him. He had some gray hairs popping up in his hair, but not many. It was shoulder length now and pulled back past his shoulders. You okay? He said in a hushed voice before pulling from the driveway. I looked back at the house, this was the last time I would see it before being married. I smiled and looked back at the road. I just cant wait until this day is over.           The black car rolled up and stopped outside the red front door. I could see the doors open and black shoes step out. I opened the door and leaned against the frame. It is odd seeing you out here. The man looked up at me and shrugged. His face had lines streaking out from around his gray eyes. His hair was a mottled mess but he was wearing a black suit which made it less obvious. He crossed his arms and pulled his sunglasses from his face. What do you want now? His deep voice pulled from the back of his throat. I touched his face gently, stroking down the side of his cheek. You are always so angry when I call you. Dont act like that. I smiled and waved him into the house. He stood next to the couch and glanced around the room. I put a hand on my hip and looked over at him. Are you okay? The man looked over at me and smiled a little bit. I am fine. Can we go now? I snatched up my purse and huffed to the car. He climbed in next to me and started the engine. We pulled out from the familiar house and onto the highway. The sky was clouding above us and the trees had already turned to fall colors. The oranges and yellows were filling the sky. We turned down a shaded road off the highway and sped down the dusty street. The trees bent over the road, creating a tunnel effect. The sun was trying to burst through in little patches. The sun was a bright yellow and orange swatch. I looked back over at the driver. His black aviators colored his eyes. His hair had been smoothed sometime while we were on the highway. I felt a knot in my stomach beginning. Today was going to be a very long day. We pulled up to a large victorian mansion. There were three other cars already there. The driver dropped me off at the door. Glancing up I noticed that the door was very large, even for my old eyes, and had black moulding accenting the pale blue color. The door was opened for me and I was guided to a room towards the back where the other visitors were waiting. I hope I have not kept you too long. It seems my driver of the day had no clue where he was going. I smiled and could see the other three relax, two men and one woman. We are waiting for Marcie anyway. One of the men smiled a crooked smile at me. I nodded and took a seat at the large, rectangular, glass table. I looked between each person, I hadnt seen them in forever, literally. The one who had spoken earlier was Stephyn. He had been my best subject when I taught school. He had grown up nicely. He was slightly shorter than I, his hair as dark as night. He had gained some weight also, but he had recently gained a wife. Apparently she was feeding him well. My head turned to the woman next to him. She was skinny and extremely tall. Felicity had a way with meetings, she usually turned them to herself, but today she was dressed in less provocative clothes and seemed to be keeping her mouth shut. The last gentleman sat on the other side of Felicity. Henri had been another friend of mine. He had been there when my drama happened with the Immortals so many years ago. He was short and pudgy with gray streaks protruding from behind his ears. I settled into my seat and heard a knock on the door. The two guards gave me a look. Once I nodded they opened them. Marcie stood in the door, her hair frantic and her face red. Do forgive the lateness. She said in a calm manner in a thick british accent and fixed her hair with a quick swoop of her hand. She took the empty seat and I let out a slow breath. Well we all know why we are here. Tomorrow is the day for the wedding but we must decide whom will be marrying Rex. Marcie raised her hand as she placed her purse on the table. Marge, why do we have to pick? I mean I know we are the elders but it seems quite obvious to me. The arranged marriage was ditched a long time ago. It wasnt because of Anya so I dont see why we must put her through this. A little tug was at my heart. Marcie was such a sweet woman she never wanted anybody to go through anything they didnt want to. I think it was because she had such a hard life herself. I opened my mouth to speak but was cut off by Stephyn. Well just because it didnt work out doesnt mean we just throw it out the window. The arranged marriage was put in place to create another, stronger group of immortals. We cant just through the idea out. But there are other people who can create a strong group without Rex. Look at the rest of them. Haku would make a perfect person for Cleo or even Violet. Although I think Cleo likes Enrique. Marcie smirked and looked back at me. Can we stop before we start up a huge fight? I put my arms up as Felicity was about to speak. We need to stop and think about this. Do we stop him from his chance at true love or do we honor the existing arrangement? Now before we start talking again I need you to write down who you want him to be with currently. It may change after but I just want to know your first opinion. Can we do that? I looked around and they all seemed to shrug. Slowly they hunched over their paper and scribbled their answers. I took the papers and looked at the two names written in different writings. I let out a small sigh. We have a lot to talk about.  --**--  I sat down at the table in front of me. We were now at a small office building. Octavius sat down next to me and handed me a coffee from out of nowhere. I took it from him and sipped it, the strong spices of cinnamon and hot chocolate filled my mouth. Rex probably told him it was my favorite I smiled. So what are we doing? I whispered. It was a kind of place that you felt like you had to be quite in like a library. Oct stared ahead and leaned back in his chair, propping up his feet on the chair ahead of us. Waiting for Krystie and then waiting for Marge. My heart sank a little at the Krystie bit. I had to spend the day with her? At least Octavius would make it so we wouldnt kill each other. I took another sip of the hot chocolate, letting it wash away the unsettling feeling that was slowly overtaking me. What do you think will happen? I asked Oct. He was the closest friend to Rex. He would be the only one who would know anything about what was happening. He let out a long sigh and settled back into his chair. What do you think will happen? He asked as the door opened. I heard the clicking of heels and a plop of a purse on the table. I looked up and saw the one person in the world I didnt want to see. Krystie sat down on the edge of the table. She was wearing a knee length black dress. Her hair was curled and clung to her shoulders. What are you talking about? Her voice was so loud amongst the quiet room. Octavius glanced up at her and shook his head. Now dont start anything Krystie. This is supposed to be civil. We are just waiting until they come with the answer, deal? She nodded and opened up her laptop from which she had pulled from her rather large purse. I gave Oct a look and began to play with my phone.  --**--  The voices rose from the small office. I grumbled to myself and put my hand to my head. Stephyn and Marcie were complaining to each other. Felicity and Henri were practically yelling at each other. I stomped my foot down. Enough of this. This is not getting us anywhere. They all stopped and looked up at me. It is true. Henris low voice cut through the sudden silence. He pushed his hand through his hair and let out a soft sigh. We need to take this seriously. This is for somebodies future. We need to think about which would make a better choice. If we are going to have Rex as the new leader than we need to judge based on that. Although if we decide somebody else should be the leader of this new pack we need to decide that first. I agree. We need to first decide whether Rex should be the leader of a new pack or no. Why should he or shouldnt he? So go around the room and we will talk about it? I looked around the room and everyone seemed to nod in agreement. So Stephyn, what about you? What do you think? He adjusted himself in his seat and put his hand to his lips. I dont think Rex wants it but I think he would be a good leader. Maybe we should pay our attention more to Octavius? He already has a group. We are trying to start a new group. Henri chimed in. True. I dont think we should put full responsibility on him. I am not sure who to put it on although. He spoke in a calm voice, looking over towards Henri. What about Cleo? I asked the group. She has been around for quite some time. Why must it always be a male who is the leader? I think she would make a perfect leader. She does get some very good aspects from her mother. Do we want to start training somebody new though? Felicity asked. Her voice wove through the crowd like velvet. It wouldnt be the first time we trained somebody new. Marcie added. We would have to find her a mate though. You cant just appoint somebody it without a mate. That is what the whole ceremony is about. She might already have a mate. I smiled. It seems she has been getting awfully close with Haku, which isnt such a bad thing. Haku? I didnt see that one coming. Felicity smirked. She had a way with drama, it always seemed to excite her. That would be utterly perfect. Stephyns voice rose from his seat. We all looked over at him wide eyed. Well it would make perfect sense. Haku is the quiet type, likes to be alone. If they were together then Cleo could run it as a leader and he could be the husband who sits calmly and lets her decide. His voice became raspy from his excitement. But why would we choose her? I mean she is eccentric and sometimes a bit cocky. Henri spoke up. I woman who is cocky is not always a bad thing. Felicity smiled. Maybe we should vote again? I personally am in more favor of Haku and Cleo running a new pack then making Rex marry somebody he doesnt love. I raised an eyebrow at her. Oh yes, Marge, I do believe in love. Just because I do not choose to live that way doesnt mean other people shouldnt. So new vote then. Raise your hand if you would like Cleo and Haku to run a new pack. I glanced around the room and smiled. Well that wasnt too hard. The door to the room burst open. I stood from my chair and before I could speak Rexs voice flooded the room. You must let me marry Anya. I do not want more than to be with her. I would rather be alone than be with Krystie and you must see that. He slammed his hands down on the table. I would give up everything to her. I would give up immortality if I meant every twitch I made wouldnt be watched. I want it to be me and her, not all of this bullshit. Just us. Felicity let out a cackle and all of us soon were giggling. I put my hand on Rexs shoulder. You could have just asked if we had an answer. He turned to me, his face red and a few beads of sweat running down his forehead. He pulled me aside from the group which had taken up to talking about normal life now. There is a problem. He hushed his voice. I made a face at him but he held up his hand in protest. We cant go through the ceremony. Well, how come? I whispered, turning him and I from the group. He looked up at me, his eyes aflame with blue and black colors. Shes pregnant.  --**--  The time seemed to be crawling by. I had found a small library next to the office and grabbed a book entitled In The Stone Circle. It looked decent so I had started reading it. Only a few pages in I found myself bored, as I always was with books. I blew out a sigh through my nostrils and leaned back in my chair to count the ceiling tiles. What are you huffing about? I heard the nails on chalkboard voice call from her laptop. I glanced over at her and then back up at the ceiling. So you are going to ignore me too? You know I am surprised you arent at work. Yeah, shouldnt you be at work? I am pretty sure I denied you today off. What did you do call out? I smirked at my comment and she found herself without a comeback. Octavius let out a soft snore and shook in his seat, waking up. God this is so boring. He stood up and stretched, his shoulders and knuckles cracking in unison. Shauna doesnt freak when you crack your knuckles? I raised my eyebrows over at him. He shook his head no and sat back down. She always screams at me. Maybe it is because ladies arent supposed to do gross things like that. Krystie chimed in. I opened my mouth to respond but Octavius was awake now, I should probably keep quiet. I felt my stomach rumble and looked over at Oct. I am starving. He nodded and made a soft grunting noise. Pizza will be here soon. I groaned and put my head down on the table. Today couldnt go any slower and it was just getting worse. I was starving, I wanted a nap and couldnt get either. I turned my attention back towards the book and started to read again. Tapping my foot against the table leg I heard the doorbell to the office ring. Octavius pushed himself up from his chair and opened the door. The second he did I could smell the warm melting cheese and garlic on the hot fresh pizza. My stomach did a flip as he paid and put it down in front of us. I took a piece and began eating even though it was very hot still. I could feel the oozing cheese and tomato sauce as I bit into the pizza. I leaned back in my chair, a little happier than before. Krystie took a piece and placed it on a paper plate that Oct had provided. My phone chirped and I looked down at it. There was a text from Shauna. I smiled and opened it. I hope everything is going well. I texted back and looked over at Octavius. What is Shauna doing? I dont know why? He finished his first piece of pizza and grabbed another one. She is texting me. I smile and he checked his phone. He let out a low grumble and flipped open his phone, walking out of the office. Hello? I heard his gruff voice. He closed the door behind him and I let out a sigh. It was just Krystie and I now. She better not start anything. So you finally ready to figure out what is happening? I bet that is a call from Rex now. I bit my tongue so she wouldnt respond. Well? Not talking to me today I see? That works out better for me anyway. Then I can just talk. I like the sound of my voice better anyway. I scoffed and looked back at my phone. I really wish today would just fly by but it wasnt. Octavius opened the door and waved to me. I got up from the chair and walked out to the porch. I looked up at Octavius with a worried expression. What is wrong? He scratched his beard and looked over at the door to make sure Krystie wasnt going to follow us. He put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me into a slow walk. You need to know a couple things about what is going to happen. I nodded and walked in step with him. It had started to lightly rain outside, the sky turning a mix of blue and gray just like Rexs eyes. Somebody is going to be upset at the end of this, you need to be ready just in case that is you okay? I honestly dont know what is going to happen but I have a feeling they will pick you. Just be ready okay? He hugged me and then withdrew his arm from around my shoulders. I know you are upset about being with Krystie all day. Thats why we are walking. He smiled down at me and motioned to a bench we were standing by. We had made our way towards a small park, three benches stood in a row near each other. I sat down and looked up at the clouds, they were swirling around each other. Octavius sat next to me, the bench sagging beneath our weight. We sat there, quiet, for quite some time. I watched as the clouds moved across the sky, the rain getting heavier and then falling lighter once more. The trees buckled under the heavy wind that was picking up. I already know in my heart he is mine. I whispered, keeping my eyes on the trees swaying ahead of us. Their leaves were falling down onto the bare ground. I know that, so I will be fine. I smiled and leaned back in against the bench. I pulled my jacket closer around me and let out a sigh. I know, that is all that needs to happen. Octavius turned towards me, putting his finger against my cheek and turning my head towards him. You know he loves you more than anything. I nodded and looked up into his eyes. They looked like a storm like Rexs but different colors. His were darker colors and they swirled together in a different fashion. He smiled and took his hand away from mine. You know I will be here for everything too. He said in a hushed voice. No matter what happens, I will be here to help. Thank you Oct. A crack of thunder burst through the clouds above us. A small yelp escaped my lips as it almost hit a tree near us. Maybe we should get back. Octavius pulled an umbrella from his pocket and opened it. Are you crazy? If it is lightning it could hit us! He laughed and put the umbrella away. I pulled the hood of my jacket up over my head and hunched my shoulders so I wouldnt get wet. It seemed like such a long walk back compared to the walk to the benches in the first place. Things kept filtering through my mind. What would happen? I hated not knowing the unknown. I suppose every person did though. What if he did choose Krystie? What would I do? I wasnt sure of anything. My stomach rumbled again even though we just ate. I wrapped my arms around myself and walked a bit faster. My head had begun to pound, my stomach twisting in agony. I ran towards the house but couldnt make it. I double over, pressing my palm against the house and saw the remnants of my pizza staring at me. The look of it made me sick once more, my stomach writhing in pain. A cold sweat filled my forehead and I felt like I was about to cry. I heard Octs voice behind me as he ran up. Anya? Are you okay? He put his hand on my back and rubbed it gently. I coughed a few more times and closed my eyes. God. I whispered. I pushed myself away from the house and touched my forehead. I dont know what came over me. I just felt sick. Oct took my elbow and ushered me to a chair outside the building we were staying in. I slumped down and took a few deep breaths. My stomach was still doing flips but at least I didnt feel sick anymore. I wonder if it was because I was nervous, or what?  --**--  I looked at Rex, my eyes wide. She is what? Pregnant. A wide smile filled his face. We are pregnant. I smiled and pulled him into a hug. Congratulations! I stopped, my arms still around him. She doesnt know does she? He shook his head no and I smiled still. Well that is two bouts of good news today. He cocked his head to the right. I leaned forward and whispered. You dont have to marry Krystie. I knew I could count on you Marge. He pulled me into a hug once more. I smiled and hugged him close. Deep down I knew something like this would happen but I didnt know if I could believe it. I took him by the shoulders and pulled him to the meeting room. All heads turned toward us as we walked in. So I have good news, well more good news. I waved my arms in Rexs direction. Rex and Anya are pregnant. The faces staring at me smiled and I saw Marcie begin clapping. The whole room began to join in a ruckus. Rex laughed as Stephyn pulled him into a hug. I smiled and sat down in my chair. But Rex, how do you know? He withdrew from the crowd a little bit and pulled up a chair. Each person resumed their seat, looking over at Rex. He ran his hand over his bald head, his eyes sparkling. Well she has been acting a little bit off. She kept getting morning sickness but blaming it on something else. She also... He sighed a content sigh. She has that glow to her you know? She just looks even more beautiful each day. Something about her skin looks different, a good different though. He beamed looking at all of us. Marcie spoke up. Does she know? His smile kind of faded, his lips going flatter. He shook his head. I couldnt bear to tell her until I figured out what happened. He looked up at me. What is the verdict? You are safe to marry whomever you choose. I smiled and he shot up from her seat. I guess I should go tell her! Thank you everyone. And with that he was gone. The rest of us looking around, still a little dazed at what had just happened. Well I do thank each and everyone of you. Usually our meetings arent this ecstatic. Everyone seemed to get up and leave at the same time. I stayed back, pushing papers around until they all fit into my purse. I heard a knock on the door frame and looked up. Jack stood there, his scar barely showing in the dusk light outside. He smiled and walked over to me. Busy day? He whispered, his gruff voice so nice to hear after the high pitched whining I had heard all day. I nodded and he kissed my forehead. But you did the right thing and that is all that mattered. I was so worried Jack. I wasnt sure I could persuade them to let him marry who he wanted. It was hard at first but someone brought up putting someone else in charge. That thought never occurred to me and it actually worked out great. I smiled up at him. Rex and Anya are pregnant. He raised an eyebrow and I thought I saw a flicker of silver through his dark green eyes. Then you did the great thing. He smiled and pulled me close, holding me against him. They remind me of us. I whispered against his chest. He nodded. That is why you were perfect for this job.  --**--  Rex had hopped into his car, his smile still plastered on his face. He couldnt believe anything. He had to hold everything together. He pulled out his phone before pulling the car onto the highway. He could feel his heartbeat in his throat. He turned the air conditioner up to high to help him stop his nervous sweat. He put the phone to his ear and heard it ring three times. Hello? Came a sweet voice. Cleo and Haku had had their lips pressed together before she answered the phone. He almost didnt let her but when they had seen who it was he finally broke down. Amazing news. You sitting down? His voice was full of happiness. She smiled and put the phone on speakerphone so Haku could hear it as well. She was sitting in his lap on the couch at her apartment. She looked over at him before looking back at the phone. I am assuming you and Anya are getting married? She squealed a little bit. His laughter cut through her voice. Actually no but there is better news. We are pregnant and you and Haku are to run the new group instead of me! She went to speak but her throat caught. Her and Haku? The elders didnt even ask them. She knew she would be fine with it because she was a strong leader but Haku, what did he think? She turned her head to look at him and he was already looking over at her. His smile was huge, his bright white teeth seemed to glitter and his eyes were wide. Us? A team? He whispered before pulling her close and kissing her. She wasnt quite sure how she was feeling but he made her stomach relax and a warm sensation filled her. That is amazing Rex! Congrats. Let me know how Anya takes everything okay? He said goodbye and she closed the phone. She looked back over at Haku. Do you think you can manage to run a pack with me Haku? I mean in all honesty. Dont lie to me. He brushed her hair from her face and ran his fingertips down her jawline. She felt goosebumps rise on her arms. I wouldnt want to make a pack with anyone else. He whispered. She smiled and hugged him tightly against her. This was the best day ever. Rex still had a smile plastered on his face as he pulled into the place where Octavius, Krystie and I were staying. I noticed his car and stood up. Octavius stood up and looked at the car. Stay here okay? I nodded but stayed standing up, wrapping my arms around my waist. The Nova purred as he pulled it into the driveway and turned it off. He had finally fixed it up. He had painted it blue and it matched his eyes perfectly. Octavius and Rex exchanged hugs and I could tell he was happy about something, I just wasnt sure what. I felt butterflies in my stomach, assuming he had been told we would marry. I felt a small twinge of doubt but didnt let it get to me. My stomach was still doing flips from when I had gotten sick earlier. Octavius moved to the side and Rex made his way towards me with long strides. I stepped down the steps and raced towards him. The wind swirled around me, blowing my hair back from my face. We met halfway, he had broken into a run also. I felt his warm lips on mine, one arm around my waist and his hand up in my hair. The doubt in my stomach washed away and was placed by a comforting feeling. I suppose this means we are getting married? I whispered as he stopped kissing me. He wrapped his arms around my waist and just held me, without answering my question. His face was still, no expression crossed it like it usually did. Rex? He leaned forward, his lips touching my earlobe. No, we are not getting married. I tried to pull away but his arms wrapped tighter around me. No? No! She won? Why was he kissing me like this? Why would he do this to me? One last kiss? I struggled a little more and stopped as he held me so tight I almost couldnt breathe. Stop doing that, you might hurt the baby. I pulled away slowly and this time he let me. I looked up into his eyes, my mouth open. The... baby? I choke out. Finally he smiled and I saw his deep blue eyes, a calm blue with no clouds covering anywhere. Im... we are... I slumped against him. Pregnant? I was pregnant. We are pregnant. He whispered and pulled me close. I could smell the musty smell of the outdoors on his clothes. I didnt know what to say, a minute ago I was worried he wouldnt marry me. I was worried that he had picked her over me but in reality it was because I was pregnant. We would start a family together. I felt a tear trickle down my cheek as I buried my face into his chest. Did you know? He asked in a calm manner. He tilted my head up with his finger and kissed me gently. I shook my head no. How did you know? I whispered. Just something about you. You changed. Not a bad change either. He smiled and I still couldnt get over it. Here I was, with the man I loved, and I was pregnant. Nothing could top this. I looked over at where Octavius had been, but he was no longer there. Do you need to tell Krystie? I whispered, feeling a slight pity for the girl. That is what Oct is here for. Dont worry. It is just you and me now. I felt his lips against mine. My body reacted to his, hugging him tightly. I could feel everything in his kiss, love, passion and being strong at the same time. Since I met Rex it had been a hectic time, but it was all worth it in the end. Here I was, happy as could be, with no cares in the world. I was pregnant. The wind whipped around us once more and I knew then that good always will come out of bad, sometimes you just need to experience rock bottom in order to pull yourself up and start again. I was so glad I took the chance and met so many great people while being with him. While being with my husband to be. While being with my babys father. Nothing could change who I was and what I had overcome. He pulled away slightly and looked into my eyes. I love you Anya. I love you too, Rex. I whispered and closed my eyes.
