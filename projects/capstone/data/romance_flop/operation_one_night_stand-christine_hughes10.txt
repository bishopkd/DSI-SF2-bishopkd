Theres something in there you arent telling me.The waitress brought over a basket of bread and though carbs were my nemesis, I tore off a piece, slathered it with butter, and popped it in my mouth.Ryan watched my every move.It was a bit unsettling.Well, there was someone else there.Who?I forget her name.Michelle or Maria.It isnt important.Wait.What?Look, you and I, I figured, were having fun.I was having fun with another girl, too.Brian wasnt happy.Said I wasnt treating you right.It was my turn to lean back and contemplate him.So I wasnt the only person you were fucking?Well, no.But it wasnt like that.Why, was I the only person you were fucking?The waitress refilled my iced tea.I ignored the question and whispered, Then what was it like?I know what was happening the first night we hooked up.It was a one night stand, a fling.Then I saw you the next day.It was weird.How was I supposed to know Id run into you again?So, you what?Felt sorry for me?Oh hell fucking no.You called me and asked me out again.You didnt have to do that.You could have left it at awkward.No harm, no foul.No.I know.Its just when I saw you, I thought maybe it could be a regular thing, you know?He was fiddling with his fork but kept eye contact throughout the conversation.This guy was unbelievable.I just dont really know how to do regular.I needed to take a breath.Why was I getting so worked up?I knew it was a one night thing.I knew it wasnt going anywhere.I knew we were just friends.I knew all of it.So why was I insulted?Because, as much as I hated to admit it, I was a girl who couldnt separate feelings from sex.It sucked, but there it was.I hadnt thought that I felt something, even if it was a fake something that stemmed from bruised lady bits, but I guess I couldnt disconnect the two things.It wasnt his fault.So, you wanted to continue to be friends.That doesnt explain why you punched Brian in the face.If you didnt want anything more, why not step aside?Well, thats the thing.The waitress dropped off our lunches.Even as he thanked her, with me sitting in front of him, he couldnt help but check her out and throw out that shit eating grin that had me eating out of his, well, Id rather not say.I snapped my fingers in his face.Hey.Ryan.Easy boy.Explain all this to me and Ill get her number for you.Right.So, like I was saying, the thing is I didnt think I wanted more.Until Brian said he did.Then I thought to myself, if he can like you that way, then why cant I?I seriously doubt youre a relationship kind of guy.I bit into my sandwich.Im not, or I wasnt.I havent been since my college girlfriend broke my heart.Since then, its been all one night stands and friends with benefits.I got where he was coming from.He was lonely.That wasnt going to change overnight.But Ryan, maybe you want a girlfriend.The fact that youve checked out our waitress a dozen times already shows me that you dont want me as a girlfriend.Im not who you are looking for, just like you arent what I was looking for.I guess.But we had fun together.We had fun, twice.And both times, there wasnt much talking.The tension that crept in at the beginning of the conversation dissipated and it suddenly felt like I was talking to an actual friend.Youre right.Maybe Im just feeling too old to keep banging every hot chick I see.Glad to know Im a hot chick, but a little concerned that Im in the every category.You know what I mean.I did know what he meant and I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders.Sometimes one night stands were meant to remain just thatjust one night.Anyway, since the morning I punched Brian, Ive been in California or staying with friends.Ive had a lot of time to think and Brian was right.And knowing him as well as I do, I know he doesnt fall for just anyone.I think the two of you will be great together.So you two worked it out?Not really.I kind of moved all my shit out when he wasnt around.Thats a douche bag move.Well, you know what they say, everyone has an asshole friend and if you dont, then youre the asshole.The thing is, none of my friends are assholes so you do the math.I dont think youre an asshole.I just think you need to square things away with Brian.I can tell it bothers him and if youre telling me the truth, then it bothers you, too.Yeah, youre right.Ill go over there after I leave here.I cant be a dick to him of all people.His eyes lit up.Hey, maybe you guys can help me find the right girl!Being single is way better than being in the wrong relationship.Trust me.Youll find her when the time is right.Until then, have fun.Nothing wrong with fun.How can someone so tiny be so smart?Youre like my Yoda.First of all, because one has nothing to do with the other.Besides, Im not tiny, Im concentrated awesome, and second of all, green isnt my color.Ryan, you and I can be friends.Like real friends.Without all thatMind blowing sex?He laughed easily.Yes, mind blowing sex.I checked the time on my phone.Ive got to go.Melody and I are going to get manicures.I stood and put on my jacket.Just promise me youll square it away with Brian?Yeah, I will.Promise.He rolled his eyes when I gave him a questioning look.Good.So, you going to the bar tonight?Wont that be weird?Why?Were friends right?Youll fix things with Brian, right?Nothing weird about that.But I can picture you naked whenever I want, he joked.I hit him with my gloves.Well, dont.Or if you do, dont tell me or Brian about it.Deal.Thanks, Caroline.Anytime.I gave him a hug.Hey, before you go, can you, uhGet the waitresss number for you?Sure thing.Before I left I whispered to our waitress and sent her over to Ryan.It was the least I could do.Twenty SevenMelody was late to the manicurist appointment and, in true Melody fashion, her entrance was dramatic.Sweeping in with her long trench coat, wild hair, designer sunglasses, and handbag, it was hard not to center attention on her.So sorry I am late!I had a late morning fuck date.She wore bed head like no one else.She hung her coat on the chair and dropped her purse, oblivious to the fact that three blue haired ladies gasped at her words and were whispering in one anothers ears about her lack of couth while frowning in her direction.No problem.I just got here myself.So who was it?Who was what?Your late morning fuck date.Who were you with?Oh you dont know him.We, uh, work together.She brushed me off.I nodded in silence.I loved Melody but sometimes I couldnt keep up with her revolving door of bed buddies.So, what color are you doing?This pale pink.I handed her the bottle.Oh cute.So you.I think Im going red this time.She pointed to a color and said, in perfect Mandarin, what she wanted.Sometimes I forgot how freakishly educated she was.Just goes to show, easy and educated do go hand in hand.So, have you and Sarah ironed shit out yet?Not yet.I thought back to the advice Id given Ryan earlier.Maybe it was time to take a teaspoon, or a gallon, of my own medicine, suck it up, and have the conversation Ive been dreading.I dont know what to say.I dont know why she freaked out.Then youre an idiot.Im not an idiot.Dont you think if I were wrong, I would know it?Of course youre an idiot.And so is she.At least I wasnt the only one.So, oh exalted one, please tell me why I am an idiot.Sarah doesnt want to lose you.She already feels like she was losing you after you and Steven broke up.You were a zombie, Care.And she kind of did.You were all wrapped up in losing him and forgot to live for a while.Plus, you started to not hang out with us while you were with him.That last year we hardly saw you.Thats not true!I cringed, knowing she was right.Oh, please.We saw you, what?Every couple months?Whenever you could get away?I took spin class every Sunday with you guys!Whatever.She rolled her eyes.Look, she wants you to be happy more than anything and she doesnt want you making shitty decisions.She thought having lunch with Ryan was a shitty decision that would fuck up what youve started with Brian.And if that fucked up, youd be back to eating pints and crying over Nicholas Sparks movies.I shook my head.Tell me Im wrong.Youre wrong.Now tell me and mean it.I couldnt.She was right.Goddamn, she was smart.Fine.Ill talk to her.Thats all I want you to do.Look, if Im going to be stuck in between two people it wouldnt be you two.Dont get me wrong, I love you guys, but you dont have cocks.What?Cocks.I need to be in the middle of a cock sandwich, not a girly emotional standoff.And thats all Im going to say on the matter.Unless you dont talk to her, then I am going to bitch smack both of you.You have a dirty mouth.I laughed.The reason I swear so much is fuck you.Just listen to me.I give great advice.I just never follow it.Hence the late morning fuck buddy.Who was it, Mel?She looked around before she leaned in and whispered, My boss.What?I yelled.Simmer down.Its no big deal.His wife was out of town and he texted me early this morning.Its not going anywhere.Just a stupid lapse in judgment.Ill say.I shook my head.Only Melody would get herself into that kind of situation.Dont tell Sarah.Shell get all judgy and I dont need that.Besides, Im meeting Danny at the bar tonight.You going?Yeah, Ill be there.Wait.Danny called?When did this happen?Last night.He apologized for not getting in touch with me.Not sure how he got my number but anyway, were meeting up tonight.No big deal.You always did have a thing for tall, dark, and handsome.And blond and ginger and, and, and.Besides, I bought a fabulous pair of fuck me heels and I intend on putting them to good use.Youre right.I blew on my nails.I was suddenly antsy to get home and have the heart to heart with Sarah.We chatted for the next hour about nothing and everything.She was right.I had been off the grid.I silently vowed not to make that mistake again.Okay, Im off.Gotta buy a new pair of panties.The word still made me cringe a week later.Have fun.Im off to chat with Sarah.Wish me luck.Good luck.She grabbed my boob.What?Everyone knows good luck is imminent when someone grabs your boob.Who knows that?Um, everyone?See you tonight, bitch face.Love you!Yeah, yeah.Dont trip on your heels.She blew me a kiss as she sashayed out the door.There was no other word to describe it.She didnt walk.I took my time walking home, mentally going over what I wanted to say to Sarah.It wouldnt be fun but I knew Melody was right.I knew Sarah better than I knew myself and nothing she said or did was malicious.I should have known better than to think so.When I entered the apartment, Sarah was nowhere in sight.I beelined for the kitchen to make a pot of coffee.I was pulling down the sweetener when I heard a thump.My skin tingled.There was no one in the apartment but me.Like a maniac, I twirled around the kitchen looking for a weapon.I thought about a knife, but knives meant stabbing and stabbing meant blood and I just wasnt ready to stain my new kicks.Converse need to be broken in gently and blood would screw up the process.So I settled on a wooden spoon.Tiptoeing with my back against the wall, I stealthily moved from the kitchen to the entrance to the hall.Another thump echoed louder.Ice slid through my veins.I psyched myself up before I peeked around the corner.Counting to three, I flipped on the light.Nothing.All the doors were closed to the rooms and the bathroom.I longed for my cell phone but it was over by the door inside my purse.It may as well have been in the middle of the ocean.No way was I going to cross the room and expose myself to whatever terror was residing in my apartment.Another thump.Carefully, I opened the closet door and threw the spoon in there while I grabbed the long golf umbrella Steven left at the apartment years ago.I promised myself if the umbrella saved my life, I would be nicer to Steven the next time I saw him.My brain looped the word if over and over.I was scared shitless as I heard a louder noise come from Sarahs room.Blessing myself with the sign of the cross, I placed my hand on the doorknob.Mentally counting backward from ten, I prepared to attack.I turned the knob slowly until I heard a click, then I shoved it open, umbrella stretched out in front of me.Aha!I hit the man in the head and he dropped to the floor.Caroline!What the hell?Sarah was handcuffed to her bed, stretched out in all her naked glory.She kept twitching.I covered my eyes and turned away.Oh my God!I am so sorry!What did you do?I thought there was an intruder!I didnt know!The naked man on the floor began to stir and I jumped back.Who is that?Its Drew, you ass!Hey, Care, Drew said.Hey, Drew.Sorry about that.Do you need an ice pack?Um, a little help over here!I peeked between my fingers.Sarah was still twitching.Whats wrong with you?Why are you twitching?I dropped the umbrella and stepped toward her.Dont come closer.She moaned.Are you sick?I was becoming concerned.Her mouth kept opening and closing, her body looked like it was spasming, and something was wrong with her voice.Are you having a stroke?Shes not having a stroke.Drew stood up, reached for his shirt, and held it in front of himself.Then whats wrong with her, I really shouldI stopped midsentence and reexamined the scene.Drew was naked.Sarah was handcuffed to the bed.She was vibrating.She was moaning.Motherfucker!Youre using a vibrator!I collapsed to the floor, laughing so hard I thought my sides would split.And I was enjoying it until you barged in here!I watched her eyelids flutter and her toes point.Um, Care?Drew looked at me and then motioned to Sarah.Oh, right.You dont want me here.I shouldnt be here.Im just um, going to go and, you know, find a noose to hang myself with.I closed the door behind me and leaned against it, laughing really hard.I can hear you!Sarah yelled out before she yelled Drews name in her big finish.I hopped back to the kitchen to get my coffee.Twenty minutes later, Drew hightailed it out of the apartment as I sat on the couch reading a manuscript.Sarah strolled into the space moments later covered in her fluffy pink robe.I snickered.I can hear you, you know.Im sorry.It was just, so not you.I mean, I expect to walk in on Melody in that situation, not you.Well, then, you dont know me very well.She huffed as she poured herself a cup of coffee.I put the papers down on the coffee table and turned toward her.Youre right.I dont know you as well as I should and thats on me.I patted the cushion next to me.Come sit.For the next hour we talked about everything.From Steven to the breakup to the one night stand.She told me her fears, her hopes, and what she wanted most in life.We reconnected in a way we hadnt since college.Wed graduated from coffee to wine when Sarah said, I was just sad when you disappeared.I felt like I lost my best friend.And when you came back, you were all weepy and shit.I mean, when you were with Steven you werent the Caroline I knew but that sobbing six week mess was not even in the vicinity of who I knew you were.I didnt know.I am so sorry.I deserve an oblivious asshole award or something.Nah.Sometimes I wish I was that wrapped up in someone.The kind of love thats the reason to look down at my phone and smile when he calls.Then promptly walk into a pole.Stupid love.Yes!Steven wasnt my stupid love.I think Brian is.I ducked my head, waiting to hear the lecture that never came.I think he is, too.Come on, lets get ready.Were meeting at the bar in an hour and a half and I really, really need to shower.Bring that vibrator in there with you.That thing needs a good cleaning.Ha!Glad I have someone to use it with.You should have seen your face when I clocked Drew with the umbrella.Priceless!Yeah, well.He has a nice ass, though.You saw?She smiled.I saw more than I care to ever see again, seriously.Im still trying to gather up enough brain bleach to get the visual of you handcuffed to the bed, spread out like jelly on toast, out of my mind.You loved it.I laughed and stopped at my door.So, were good?Were forever good.I watched her strut into the bathroom and close the door.I went into my room to pick out my outfit for the night and pack my overnight bag.Smiling, I ran and pulled my phone from my purse.Back in my room, I stripped off my shirt, snapped a pic, and sent it to Brian.Giggling at his open mouthed, surprised selfie, I went back to getting ready.Twenty EightWe didnt hit the bar until close to nine.Sarah and I stopped at the sushi place to stuff our faces.Apparently reminiscing and apologizing works up a massive appetite.Everything was falling into place.I couldnt have been happier.I bounced into the bar, walked right up to Brian, and planted a long slow kiss on his lips.When we pulled away from each other, the bar erupted in cheers.The old me would have been embarrassed but the new me took a bow.What was that for?Brian wrapped his arms around me.No reason.Well, I like no reason.And thanks.For kissing you?Thats hardly a chore.I gave him a quick peck on the nose.No.For talking to Ryan.He came over earlier and we had a little chat.Seems like youre a little Miss Fix It.Yeah, well, I had to fix it with Sarah today, too.Howd that go?He stepped away to pull a beer.The conversation went well.Ill tell you all about it later.The preconversation was a little spicy.Spicy?Yeah.Lets just say I know how many freckles are on Drews ass.I heard him yell, What?as I walked toward the back.I was giggling when I reached the table.Caroline!Berk and Danny exclaimed in unison.Thank God youre here.Thank God, huh?Nice to see you, too.I flopped down on the chair Berk kicked out for me, grabbed an empty glass from the table, and filled it with what was left of the beer in the pitcher.I popped a French fry in my mouth and leaned back.Yeah.Apparently you know how Drew got the lump on his head, Berk offered.I already told you Drew began.Hush now.Caroline will clear the matter up.Both Drew and Sarah stiffened and turned bright red.I looked between the two of them and smiled.I think he fell down.Is that right Drew?Yeah, thats what I said.Then how on earthBerk made an elaborate gesture with his handsdid Sarah get those red marks on her wrist?I looked over as Sarah dropped her hands to her lap.Rubber bands.She looked at me.Rubber bands?Danny asked.Yeah.You know, shes a teacher and she puts rubber bands on her wrists and they were too tight.Rubber bands that are too tight leave red marks.Everyone knows that.Both Berk and Danny looked at me skeptically.Melody stifled a laugh.She didnt know the story but her imagination was probably on target.That doesnt sound right.Were missing something here.Berk stood.Well, thats my story.Right.Im going to get more beer.Anyone want anything?Yeah!Tell Brian to send over some shots.Melody leaned against Danny with a smile on her face.Soshe looked between Sarah and medid you two square things away?We did, actually.We had a good talk.Learned new stuff about each other.We did.I saw a whole new side of Sarah today.One that I wont forget for a long time.Will you be requiring the brain bleach?Melodys eyes twinkled.I will, as a matter of fact.Oh shut up, Lots OLube.Sarah laughed.Lots OLube?Thats that nasty shit Ryan buys.Dannys eyes widened.You didnt!It was my turn to freeze.Whos talking about me?Ryan arrived at the table, beer in hand.He looked perplexed when the entire table erupted in laughter.Whats so funny?Nothin man.Welcome back.Danny grabbed Ryans hand and pulled him in for a hug.Berk walked over with a tray full of shots.What do we have here?I asked.And why are you always delivering the drinks?Arent there waitresses who work here, for tips?Do you see any waitresses?I come bearing a tray full of Tight Snatches.Please, drink at your own risk.Why does yours look different?Melody asked.Considering, even though you ladies are quite lovely, I dont prefer the snatch, tight or not, I decided to drink something that reflects my own personality.Which is?A Dr.Pecker.I thought it quaint considering my new flavor is a doctor anyway.Berk winked and downed the shot without waiting for the rest of us.Ill never get used to the fact that you like dick, man.Ryan said.Youll never get used to the fact that I like dick or that I dont like your dick?Berk leaned down and planted a juicy kiss on Ryans lips.Get off me!Ryan laughed as he wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his shirt.He spazzed out enough that Berk had to catch the chair from tipping over.What the hell man?I have a reputation to uphold.As do I.  I hope no one saw me kissing you.I wouldnt want anyone thinking I switched teams.Whats wrong with kissing me?Im a great kisser.I secretly agreed but kept my mouth shut.A little sloppy.Berk made a show of wiping his entire face with a napkin.Sloppy?You dont know what youre talking about.The lady doth protest too much, methinks, I offered.Watch who youre calling a lady, lady.Ryan snorted into his beer glass.Everyone grabbed a shot.Heres to none of us getting friend zoned tonight!Drew lifted the shot glass.Friend zoned?I asked.Yeah, when she doesnt change her mind when shes drunk, Drew explained.To not getting friend zoned!Brian appeared behind me and joined in the toast.No chance of that, I countered.I would hope not.Hey Drew, whats this I hear about freckles on your ass and why does Caroline know how many there are?I knew there was more to the story!Danny yelled, jumping out of his seat as his face broke into a huge grin.Sarah spit out her shot and Drew found something on the floor suddenly very interesting.You and IBrian pointed from his eyes to Drewwill chat about this later.He leaned down and whispered in my ear.You need anything?You?He looked around the bar.Give me five minutes and meet me upstairs.He twirled his towel and snapped it at me.No fair!Melody called out.You cant sneak off when none of us can do it here!Should I rent out my bedroom?A few hundred bucks an hour?I bet I could clean up.Why use a bed when you have a perfectly good bathroom to get freaky in?Thats your thing, right, Caroline?Danny shot back.My thing?I shook my head in confusion.Yeah.Melody told us about your bathroom escapade from last weekend.Danny flinched when Melody smacked him on the arm.I whipped my head around.You told him?I didnt know it was a secret.It was pretty funny!Do you know how long it took us to get her in that thing?Sarah asked.About as long as it took me to get it off her?Brian quipped.Its not funny!That thing was squeezing my insides out my ears.Its a little funny.Its a lot funny, Drew said.Hey.I pointed at him.You want me to tell everyone whats so funny?He held up his hands.Shutting up now.Thats what I thought.I cant believe you told them.I couldnt decide whether to laugh or crawl under the table.How about the next time I do something terrifyingly funny, you can tell everyone all about it?I made a face.Deal.Shake on it?Brian offered his hand.Nope.Kiss on it.He kissed me quickly.Like I said, five minutes.Be there.With bells on.How about that smile I left you with?Brian winked and went back to the bar.Aww.Thats cute.Melody pouted her lips.I want to be cute with someone.You can be cute with me, Danny said.Is that right?Melodys eyes shined.Sure.Why not?Well see.Anyway, I have to go to the little girls room.Be back.Melody made eye contact with Danny and tilted her head toward the bathroom.Um, I have to go, too.Danny jumped up and raced after her.So, Ryan.Did that waitress give you her number?There was a waitress?Drew took a moment from making out with Sarah to ask.Yeah.Well, I dont know.Were going out Wednesday night.Huh, maybe she can teach you not to be such an asshole.Drew laughed like hed told the funniest joke hed ever heard.Ryan playfully shot back.Hey, Im not an asshole.I just dont give a fuck a lot.It was my turn to shoot beer out of my nose.Sarah handed me a napkin.Ryan and Drew continued the conversation about the waitress; Sarah got up to go talk to one of the other teachers she worked with.I watched Brian make drinks and check his phone.He looked up, whispered to another bartender, threw down his towel, and stepped out from behind the bar.I watched him walk to the apartment door and disappear.I smiled, slid my chair back, and did my best not to sprint after him.The upstairs entrance to the apartment was open and as I stepped through, Brian appeared out of nowhere, pulled me aside, and slammed the door closed.Smiling, I maneuvered him back so he was up against the door.What are you doing?What?I tilted my head as I worked his belt buckle open.You dont have to.He breathed as I shoved his pants and boxer briefs over the round of his ass.You dont want me to?I didnt say that.Good.I gripped him in my fist as he continued to swell.I kissed him hard on the mouth, allowing our tongues to tangle for only a moment before I dropped to my knees and ran my lips over his length.He threaded his fingers in my hair and whispered my name when I spit on the tip and ran my hand up and down the shaft.I fit him in my mouth and his knees buckled.I wrapped my hands around him and gripped his ass, pulling myself in closer to him.He palmed the back of my head and kept rhythm with me as I worked to bring him to climax.He yelled out my name as he came, his fingers knotted in my hair.I continued to hold on to him until he stopped shaking.I leaned back and sat on the floor as he slid down the door until he was sitting in front of me.With his pants around his knees he brought his hands to his head and shook it hard like he was trying to focus.You okay?I giggled.His reaction was priceless.No.Dont touch me.Not yet.I need a minute.You dont want me to touch you?I ran my hand along his thigh.Caroline.He growled.What?I put his earlobe between my teeth and pulled gently.He closed his eyes.He didnt move, so I stood up and took off my shirt.He finally opened his eyes when it hit him in the face.Well, if you arent interestedI slipped out of my flats and walked toward his bedroomI guess Ill just have to take care of it myself.He shot up, pulled his pants back on, and chased me down the hallway as I screamed and ran toward the bedroom.He grabbed me right before I entered the room, lifted me up, threw me on the bed, and pressed himself on top of me.Youre killing me.He moaned.I told you I would take care of it myself.Laughing, I tried to wiggle out from under him.Oh no you dont!Oh yes I can!I know you can.A real woman can do it all by herself, I know that.But a real man wont let her.His lips met mine and we lost ourselves in each other.An hour later we lay in the bed, quiet but for the sounds of our breathing.We should get back.I broke the silence.No.Brian nuzzled his unshaven face into my neck.Everyone is probably waiting for us, wondering where we are.Let them.The longer were up here, the more studly I look.More studly?I raised my eyebrows.You know what I mean.More studly.Studlier.Whatever.He reached down and smacked my ass.Ouch!Come on.I rolled over and looked for my pants.Fine.Youre sleeping here tonight?I was planning on it.Good.You know, Christmas is coming up.I turned to him.His hair was disheveled and his eyes were sleepy and relaxed.Christmas?I had totally forgotten.Yeah.Its in like, ten days.Wow.He laughed and pulled on his pants while lying down.Anyway, I was thinking we could go get a tree tomorrow.I havent even started shopping yet.I cant believe it slipped my mind.I mean everything is already decorated.How did that slip past me?I dont know.What do you say?We can go shopping in the morning, then get a tree before we come back here.I thinkI crawled across the bed and kissed himthat sounds like a great idea.I was hoping youd say that.Maybe Ill call out sick on Monday.We can sleep in and decorate it.Sounds like an even better plan.He grabbed my ass and squeezed.I waited until he put on his shirt before we walked out to the living room.I pulled my sweater over my head and we went back downstairs hand in hand.Twenty NineI approached the table to see Melody with her hair spread out on the table and Sarah texting someone while she sipped a beer.Hey.Hey, Sarah replied.She returns!Melody lifted her head and slurred before dropping it back to the table.I cocked my head to the side and squinted before I leaned down and whispered to Sarah, Does she know her shirt is inside out?Thats nothing, there was a used condom stuck to her shoe.I crinkled my nose.Ew.Yeah.I looked around.Whered everyone else go?Danny, Drew, and Ryan are playing darts, and Berk is in the back corner making out with his doctor friend.Its a shame.Two perfectly hot guys completely unavailable to me.She shook her head in disbelief.I dug around in my purse and found my compact and lip gloss.Looks like Melodys cut off.I slicked on the gloss and puckered in the mirror before handing it to Sarah.Oh yeah.Were only staying a little longer, then Im bringing her back home with me.Id rather be able to walk her home than call her a taxi and hope she gets home.Blot?I handed her a napkin.Thanks.Mel!I yelled and kicked the table.She lifted her head and looked at me.What?Huh?Yeah?You okay?She gave me a loopy smile and a thumbs up, then dropped her head back down.Shes down.Sarah laughed.I nodded back at her and whispered to Sarah, Im not supposed to tell you, but she slept with her boss this morning.Which one?Sarahs voice was serious.The married one.Shit.Yeah.She cant be doing that.You tell her that!I pointed to Melodys sleeping head.Sarah shook her head.Always something with her.Smart as a whip but no common sense.Youre staying here, right?Yeah.Get this.Were picking out a Christmas tree tomorrow.Thats a big step.Sure youre ready?For real.Sarah scrunched up her face.Wait.Its Christmas already?Right?I thought I was the only one who wasnt paying attention.Feels like yesterday we were taking in the sun in Jamaica.God.I know.Lets go back.Cant.Its Christmas and we are required to celebrate in New Jersey.I cant believe I didnt realize how close it was.There is no excuse.Im a teacher.I look forward to this shit.I shrugged and said, Maybe were too old for Christmas.Bullshit.Were never too old for Christmas.What do you want anyway?A new pair of nude pumps?Mine are all scuffed.Consider it done.You?I poured a glass of beer for myself and topped hers off.A man.She took a drink, keeping her eye on Drew.I nodded toward him.What about Drew?Eh, I dont know.Its not serious.It sure as hell looked serious.I mean you dont just let anyone handcuff you to the bed.Maybe you do, I dont know.But I draw the line.Yeah.Not serious.Fun, yes.Serious, no.Why not?I dont know.Maybe hes not into me.Doubt that.Im happy for you, you know.I smiled at her.I know.Brian is a good guy.I think so.I looked over and caught his eye.The best feeling in the world is when a girl looks over and her guy is already staring.He winked and went back to pulling beers.I think, Sarah began, we should play darts.I think these guys need to get their asses handed to them.I got up and followed her.But I dont know how to play.How hard can it be?You throw the arrow thingy at the target and try to get a bulls eye.I dont know about you but the last time I tried to go after a target it didnt work out so well.Oh, it worked out.Just not the way you thought it would.I looked over at Brian again and said, Yeah, I guess youre right.The rest of the night was spent with Melody asleep on the back table and the rest of us laughing, dancing, singing, and shooting darts.Brians breaks were spent in the back with us.Even Berk pulled away from his man candy long enough to join us.We were a bunch of people, some who barely knew one another, starting relationships that would last longer than any of us could have anticipated.
