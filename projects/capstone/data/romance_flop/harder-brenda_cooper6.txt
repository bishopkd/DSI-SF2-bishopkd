Thats just fucking perfect.What I know from Carolines phone call is that Frankie launched herself over a desk in an apparently unprovoked attack, sat on some kid named Clint, and hit him repeatedly in the face until the teacher and an aide pulled her off.Frankies never done anything like that.Not once in her whole life.Caroline?I ask.Its better if she tells you.Frankies staring at her feet like someone nailed them to the floor.I pace back and forth behind the chairs.Every time I walk behind my sister, her shoulders draw tighter until theyre up by her ears.She looks like shes afraid Im going to hurt her, but Im the one who holds her when she wakes up from nightmares.Shes got no fucking reason to be scared of me, not one.Start talking, I bark.Frankie scoots her chair away from where Im standing, burying her face in Carolines armpit.West, Caroline says.What?Calm down.How?Its an honest fucking question.I wish shed tell me where the handbook is for this.Id memorize the whole thing if I thought it might help me out here.I squat down next to Frankie.Pitch my voice as low as I can, as calm as I can manage.In a few minutes, that counselors coming back in here.Hes going to ask me what happened, and Im supposed to tell him youre catatonic?You think thats going to go over well?I dont know what that means, she mumbles.It means youre practically in a coma.Im not catatonic.I just dont want to talk to you.Well, who do you want to talk to, huh?The social workers who show up at the apartment when they decide Im not fit to take care of my sister whos beating kids up at school?Unless I missed something, were on the same team, Franks.She doesnt say anything.My eyes rise to Carolines, and theres softness there.Faith in me that eases some of the sharpness off my temper.I put a hand on Frankies leg and try again.Try to keep my voice level, try to keep from sounding like my dad, from being like him.We have to stick together, I say.I cant help you if you wont talk to me.Whats going on right nowthis is actually dangerous.I could lose you.Frankies trembling.Youre scaring her, Caroline says.Im sorry, but this is a scary situation.Scarier than you understand, I think.Frankie starts to cry.My fists keep closing, clenching tight, my forearms pumped up with blood and violence that wont do any good here.Not in a school, not in Putnam.I cant fight my way out of this.Cant yell my way to a solution.You have any suggestions?I ask Caroline.She ducks her head and whispers a question to Frankie.Frankie whispers something back.They go on like that for a few seconds, and then Caroline says, She wants me to tell you for her.Would that be all right?Yes.Lets do it over there.She leads me to the opposite side of the closet room, as far from Frankie as we can get, and refuses to start talking until I sit.I straddle a chair, fold my arms across the back, wondering why shes going to so much trouble to get me ready for this.Then she tells me, and its worse than anything I could have guessed.I thought Frankie missed her friends back home, and that maybe she was embarrassed of her boobs, uncomfortable with her bodybut what Caroline tells me is theres a kid, this slimy little Clint fucker, whos been giving Frankie a hard time on the bus every morning and every afternoon.Hes been saying perverted shit about how she looks, her body, sexual stuff that no ten year old should be thinking about.On Halloween, the teacher moved the kids desks into a new arrangement with groups of four desks clumped together, and now Clints is right next to Frankies, so shes been hearing his shit all day long, day in and day out.She took it and took it until she couldnt take it anymore.Then she attacked.I run sweaty palms down my thighs.Im going to kill him, I say.Carolines hands are on my shoulders.Shes right behind me, talking soft.No, youre not.Frankies huddled into a ball on the seat of her chair.I cant breathe right.Its not Clint I want to kill.I did this to her.Me.The whole time she was a baby, I was afraid.If she slept longer than usual, I worried shed died in her sleep.I wouldnt be able to make myself look in on her because I was so sure it would come true.I worried she wasnt eating enough, wasnt eating right, wasnt growing the way she should be.I worried she wouldnt have anything to wear to school, and when she had a fever I worried that her brain would fry and it would make her stupid.I worried when I found out about all that recalled Tylenol that Id given her too much and she was going to get asthma or seizures or whatever.When I was in middle school, Frankie was a toddler.Mom would leave her at the neighbors, Mrs.Dieks, and I would come off the bus and straight to Mrs.Diekss place to pick her up.Most of the time Id find Frankie in nothing but a diaper, slapping her fat little palms on the coffee table, wreathed in smoke and babbling at the TV.Shes a terror, Mrs.Dieks would tell me, and I knew even when I was twelve years old that Frankie wasnt.She was normal.Curious.It was Mrs.Dieks who was too old to be watching her.I could tell from the way she looked at melike I might be carrying a diseasethat Mrs.Dieks didnt like me.I could guess from the bruises on the softest parts of Frankies thighs that Mrs.Dieks didnt like my sister, either.But there was nothing I could do about it but tell my mom, who blew it off.She falls down, my mom said.Im sure theyre from accidents.I remember being so upset, I threw up.Wiped my eyes, rinsed out my mouth from the bathroom tap, and swore it was the last time Id count on my mom for anything.Youre going to have to fix this, I told myself.Youre going to have to make it better for her.But what could I do?I was a kid, barely older than Frankie is now.I carried my sister home the second I got off the bus, changed her diaper, rubbed the diaper rash cream in as gently as I could.Once she was in school during the day, we both got off the bus at the same time.Mom was working.Frankie was mine to worry about.When I got my drivers license, I could drive her around.I had money of my own to buy some of what she neededclothes and food and treats.Even when I left her behind to come to Putnam, Frankie was my first priority, my principal worry, my sister, mine.But now she is mine, legally my responsibility, and Ive failed her.I brought her here where shes vulnerable.I left her alone too much.I knew something was going on, but I didnt want to hear it.Its my fault, I say.All of this is my fault.Youre wrong, Caroline replies.You dont understand.I do understand, and youre wrong.But we can talk about that later.Right now, you need to focus on constructive solutions to this problem.Whatll be constructive is if I bash that little fuckers face in.I dont mean it.I just havent got anything constructive to offer.It wont help if you get yourself arrested, she says.She braces an arm on the chair in front of me and leans close to my back to say, Everythings going to be fine, West.Trust me.I know this feels huge, but I was already talking to the counselor, and its really going to be okay.I grab her arm, wrap it across my chest, forcing her to drop into a seat behind me on the chair, pressed up against my back.When she puts her other arm around me, I cross mine to cover her hands and squeeze tight.Breathe, she says.I breathe in.Breathe out.Drop my head back until it rests against her neck, her shoulder.I focus on Caroline.How right she feels against me.I pitch my voice low and tell her, Its abuse.What hes been saying to Frankie.I know.That kind of shit messes you up.I cant fix it.I know.But West, well help her through it.I promise.I look at my sister, perched on the seat of a blue plastic chair with her knees squeezed in tight to her chest, and I try to make myself believe it.From where I stand, leaning against the exterior of the school building, Frankies face is visible in profile.Shes got her head bent, her hair pushed behind her ear and scattered over her shoulder.I told her to brush it this morning, but it looks like she forgot.Shes sitting in my truck, and Im pressing the back of my head against unyielding brick, letting the rough surface bite into the underside of my fingers.All I can see is Frankie.The fine little girl lines of her face.Her thin shoulders and scraggly hair and black sweatshirt.Ten years old, alone in a cold car.Caroline pushes my shoulder, a gentle shove.West.Im talking to you.I heard you.I didnt, though.Im not quite inside myself.Im set apart, noticing the pressure of the brick teeth on my palm, observing my sister, listening to a recording of everything the counselor said without feeling any of it.Frankie needs enrichment.They havent got her test scores back, but shes doing work above grade level in every subject.Shes unhappy.Shes in his office three or four times a week.Shes walking out of her classroom to sit in the chair by his door or across from his desk, and thats okay.Shes allowed to do that.He cleared it with her teacher.He gave my sister a safe space to go to when she needs it.Hed like to see her make more friends.Hed like to see her talking more at school, would love to give her more opportunities across the board, and he wants to know if Ive thought about music or art lessons, because sometimes they help kids who are dealing with grief.I guess that means she told him about Dad.What else does she tell him when she goes to sit in the safe space he made for her?What does she tell Caroline on their long afternoons together?Obviously a fuck of a lot more than she tells me.Caroline faces me.West.Im going to quit at the factory, I say.You dont have to.I can pick her up every day.I dont have any classes that late.I need to be around.She reaches out with a fingertip and hooks my sleeve.I watch her rub the cloth between her thumb and her finger like she wants to touch me but she cant get close enough to do it.You should go, I say.Never have I felt less like I deserved her loyalty.She takes my hand.I let her.Last year, I say.What about last year?I was pretending.Which part?The part where I had a life outside of taking care of Frankie.But you did have a life here.It wasnt imaginary.Look what came from that, though.You didnt cause it.You didnt make your mom get back with your dad, you didnt kill him, you didnt make it so Frankie had to see it.She told you she saw it?The knowledge sweeps through me, leaving me cold.Of course she did.My mother lied.My sister witnessed a murder.She told Caroline, but she didnt tell me.Im sorry, Caroline says.I wasnt sure if I should say anything, or when, or how to tell you I knew, I interrupt.Because I did.I didnt want to know, but I knew.I think of Dr.Tomlinson then.Of terrible secrets that are never secrets.Not really.Im supposed to keep her safe, I say.Youre doing a good job.Shes a wonderful kid.Shes fucked up.West, everybodys fucked up.I dont want Frankie to be like me.Carolines eyes glisten.Her throat works.I pull her hand until her elbows against my side and I can put my other arm around her.We stand there like that.Past the parking lot, I can see the playground.Theyve got one of those spiral slides off by itself, and this huge play structure that has a climbing wall part, four different slides that branch off in different directions, a rope bridge, all kinds of shit.Theres dried leaves gathered in the corners and against the fencered and green and gold.So much color at this school.I never had a counselor like him, I say.Jeff?Twenty four years old.And that picture of his wife and his baby.What about them?You heard.He wants to see her settled in better.He wants her to reach her full potential for achievement and happiness.Maybe thats a thing people say in Carolines world.She wouldve gone to a school like this, with school counselors and teachers and principals who wanted things for her.She has a father who wants the world for her.Its such a foreign country to me.Nobody ever talked to me about potential and achievement and happiness but Dr.T, and what I did to get what he was offering canceled out any part of me that might have deserved it.She strokes my arm.Its good, right?Its all good.I pull Caroline closer, position her in front of me, take her weight when she sags against me.We watch my sister.She bends down and disappears, probably fishing around in her school bag.Takes something out of it, drops her head again.Shes writing.If Jeff was her dad, hed know what she was writing, I say.Probably not.She wouldnt have nightmares.Shed have daydreams.Horses and unicorns, princes and castles, all that shit girls her age draw in their notebooksthats what Frankie would have.Caroline turns in my arms and puts her cold hands against my cheeks.That is such a mountain of crap.Its the truth.Even if it were trueeven if shed had a different life up to now, some sheltered life with unicorns and rainbowssooner or later shed grow up, and shed get hurt.Theres no way around it.You didnt see her when she was a baby.There was nothing to her.She strokes her hands down my neck.You know who I wish I couldve seen?You.I wish Id seen you when she was born.How old were you, ten?I nod.I want a time machine, Caroline says, so I can see you when you were eleven or twelve and she took her first steps.I want to see when she was learning to talk, and when you taught her to read.She taught herself to spell first, I say.Went right from the alphabet song to phonics to spelling everything out loud, and then once she could spell she picked up Fox in Socks and read it to me.Didnt miss a single word.I bet you were proud of her.I was.I always have been.Caroline flattens her hands against my chest and leans back to look me in the eye.She doesnt need another father, she says.Shes got you.Im just her brother.No, youre not.Im her guardian.Jesus, youre stubborn.Caroline steps away, turns to face the car, and points at Frankie.Look at her, she says.Look at that girl and tell me you dont know every single thing about her.She didnt tell me about Clint.Shes ten, Caroline says.Thats old enough for secrets.But I met your mom, and I saw where you grew up.Ive talked to your sister.Ive seen her with you.Youre her father, whether you like it or not.Youve been her father since the day your mom brought her home from the hospital.Look at her.I look.I look for what feels like an hour.I cant tell Caroline shes wrong.I dont know what Frankies writing about, but I know the way she nibbles on her lip when shes got a pen in her hand.She gnaws the skin off that lip, and when its cold and dry out it cracks sometimes and bleeds, and Ive got to get after her to put Carmex on it so itll heal.Id give my life for her without hesitating.Anytime.Any day.Under any circumstances.Thats how it is, and Carolines right that it doesnt matter what some piece of paper says.Me and my sister belong to each other deeper than words on paper, deeper than I can find the words to say out loud.Shes my kid.I guess that means Im her father.What a fucking terrifying thought.I dont know what to do for her, I say.So you learn.I dont know how to start.Quit being such a baby.Read a parenting book.Read twenty, if it makes you feel better.Its not just parenting, though, its this stuff.I gesture at the playground.Enrichment.Art classes.It never crossed my mind to worry about that.Thats what Jeffs for.No, thats my point.Im saying, were living here like we lived in Silt.Were surviving, because thats all I know how to do.Jeff hears about Clint and the bus and the sick shit that kid said to my sister, and he doesnt think about punching someone.He tells me, Yeah, thats terrible, but were gonna handle it.What Im worried about is how we can make your sisters life richer.Richer!What the fucking fuck?Shes frowning at me.Richer, I say again, dropping the word like a hammer.Fuller.More beautiful.Thats not surviving, its something else.Its thriving.I dont know how to do that.Caroline butts her head into my chest, hard.Then she does it again.Whatd I say?West.She slams her head into me a third time.Rolls her forehead back and forth.You drive me crazy.What?You dont know how to do it for your sister because you dont know how to do it for yourself, okay?But if youd just fucking listen to me sometimes, and if youd just let me in, you might start to figure it out.Im as shocked as if shed smacked mestill reeling from her wordswhen she lifts her face to mine, rises to her toes, and kisses me.Really kisses me, with tongue and teeth, her hands on my head, body pressing into mine.I dont even think about resisting.I take her ass in both hands and pull her tight against me, kiss her back, one kiss after another, soft and then hard, a deep stroke of my tongue, scared and confused and glad shes here, because I know what richer and fuller and more beautiful mean, but only when Im with Caroline.She breaks away and kisses my chin, my jaw, my cheek, and my temple.Youre going to figure it out, she whispers.Trust me on this one.I cant trust myself, but I can trust her.Ill try.She hugs me tight, tucks her head against my neck, and says, You fucking better.I look down at the top of her head, and then I look at my sister again in the car, miles away, thinking whatever it is shes thinking about.In between us is Caroline.Her house is a couple blocks from campus, a big old cedar shingled place thats impressive from a distance but looks shabby close up.I park in the alley in the back.Krishna lets me into the kitchen.It smells like onions and garlicwarm cooking scents.Bridget and Caroline are at a little table tucked into the corner of the room.Wheres Frankie?Caroline asks.I left her with Laurie and Rikki.Is she okay?Yeah, she just got a better offer.Theyre doing some kind of art film double feature with popcorn and Junior Mints.She seemed excited, so I said go for it.I want to is what Frankie actually told me.I couldnt say no to that, especially not when it meant a night off for me and a chance to see if I can remember what its like to have friends.Im holding a case of beer and a foot long sausage.I stopped at the Kum and Go on the way here.Happy birthday, I say to Krishna.Legal at last.Must be a thrill.Oh, it is.I almost creamed myself when I woke up this morning and realized I could finally drink with the big kids.Ill bet.Thats some present, he says.You mustve killed yourself trying to figure out what to get me.I was gonna get you 101 Unsolved Math Problems, but they were all out at the gas station.Its a poorly stocked mart, thats for sure.Figured youd rather have beer and a giant sausage than a copy of Hustler.Krishna flicks his eyes at Bridget.You can put the beer in the fridge, he says absently.Open one for me, though.You got it.We picked up two kegs for the party later.Two?Youre not screwing around.You only turn twenty one once.I set the sausage down, twist off two caps, hand him one.Grab a chair, he tells me.Im making minestrone.Youre wearing a fucking apron.I know.Trying to look like you, killer.You were always rocking the apron at the bakery last year.Nostalgia and disappointment, pleasure and pain.So many times he came by the bakery just to hang out for an hour before he went home to crash.So many shifts I spent with Caroline sitting on the floor doing her Latin homework, talking through some idea for a paper or highlighting up her textbook.Gone now.I havent even walked by the bakery.I didnt ask for my job back because I got myself fucking arrested out of the bakery, and I cant look the owner, Bob, in the eye.I burned all these bridges behind me when I left Putnam, thinking I was going home when there wasnt any home for me to go to.Just work and worry and people fucking things up while I tried to be someone they could count on.And to be that guy, I betrayed what I had with every single person in this kitchen.I take the chair next to Caroline.Shes wearing jeans and a T shirt, just a plain white T shirt with a pocket on it.Her hairs down, against her back, still damp from the shower.Her feet, in thick gray socks, are hooked over the rungs of her chair.She looks amazing to me, even with that tilt to her head and that wrinkle between her eyebrows that means shes trying to figure me out.Check the garlic bread, Bridget says to Krishna.The broilers tricky, and it can burn if youre not paying attention.I think its been in there long enough Krish talks right over her the way they always do.I set a timer.timer is a good idea, but its not smart to rely on it completely, because sometimes the broiler is so hot that Its fine.The timers going, so Im not checking it.Its burning, though, I can Its not burning.Krish, I can smell it burning.You have to By the time hes found a hot pad, theres smoke coming from under the broiler, and the whole kitchen smells like singed bread.Krishna is swearing, throwing doors open, while Bridget flaps around making a lot of noise.Caroline and I take it all in, unfazed, and I dont know, its nice.Its nice sitting next to Caroline, looking at her thighs in her dark blue jeans, her elbow on the table, listening to Bridget and Krish bitch at each other.He puts the bread in a basket, a fucking basket, and sets it in front of me like Im the king of France.Its still going to be a while on the soup.I guess I was supposed to start it sooner and the bread later.You know you were, Bridget says.I sent you that text when you were in class to remind you, and I said I could pick up the Parmesan so you didnt have to waste your time, but you think you know everything but really thats you, right?And then Krishna smiles at her in this way that completely betrays him.Ive seen him look at her before, but never this obvious.I glance at Caroline, wondering if she sees it, too.She lifts an eyebrow.What?I glance from Bridget to Krishna and back to Bridget.Mouth the word, Fucking.She nods.No shit?She makes a circle with her left hand, thrusts into it with the index finger of her right, smiling at me with her eyes.No shit what?Krishna wants to know.Nothing, we say in unison, and for a second its just like it always was between us.Easy.I pick up a piece of garlic bread and shove it into my mouth.Im fucking ravenous.Ten more minutes, I tell myself.I have class tomorrow.Ive got work in the afternoon, Frankie to talk to, my whole life to sort out.Ten more minutes, and then Ill go.Dinner did something to me, though.The bread was frozen and burned, the soup so salty it about sucked all the moisture out of my body, and for dessert a cheesecake that Bridget made Krishna from scratch.It was good.The food and the company, the way I could close my eyes and almost pretend I was an ordinary college guy eating dinner with his friends, drinking a few beers, joking around about big sausages and whos gonna do the dishes, talking about nothing.Ten more minutes.Ten more.Instead, I take my cup back to the keg and draw another beer.I have just enough to drink to push my guard down, and the music keeps it thereclub music, dance music, loud throbbing anthems, and dark catchy songs that make people want to huddle in corners and talk real close together and put their hands on each other.The house fills with people.I know a lot of thempeople Ive sold to, drank with, handed paper bags of muffins at three in the morning.Old lab partners, group project partners, girls whose names I know because Krishna hooked up with them, girls whose names I know because theyve tried to hook up with me.I let it infect me.Noise and heat, girls and sweat.The house gets loud, the music gets louder, everybodys got a red plastic cup and something to say.Every time someone raises a hand and shouts West!over the crowdevery time someone presses another cup into my handI let myself take it.Im drinking and talking, laughing with some dude whose name I cant remember, leaning a palm against the wall, dipping down so I can hear this chick named Sierra who seems to know me though Id swear Ive never talked to her before.Ive got a view down her shirt but her tits are just tits and mostly what Im doing, even when Im not doing it, is watching Caroline.I like the way she looks.The way she laughs.I like the way she moves when shes weaving through bodies with her drink held high, the way she jokes around with Krishna and Bridget and her other housemates, the way that even though shes not all that tall she looks like the tallest girl in the room because she holds herself so straight.She holds herself like she matters, laughs like she cares, smiles like shes somebody.Regal.Carolines regal.Always has been.Always will be, and nothing I do or say to her is going to change that, because she wasnt lying when she said she wouldnt cut off her hair for me.She knows who she is deep inside herself.I can break her heart, but I cant break her pride.I cant break her.Shes not ever going to let that happen.Fuck, I want her.All the time, like a virus, a disease I caught, except the other way aroundlike a cure I caught a year ago, and its inside me, winding through my veins, pumping through my heart.Its easy to take it.Its easy to drink more than Im supposed to, easy to go to her when I see her resting on the arm of the couch.Its easy to walk up behind her and sweep her hair back over her shoulder and lower my head.I hold her shoulders, bracket her between my palms, tell her keep still with my hands, and I open my mouth there, right at the edge of her jawline.Its the first place I ever put my lips on her, and I know shell remember.I act like shes still mine, because Ive never stopped being hers.Not for a second.I step in closer, bending down, pressing against her as I wrap my arms around her front, feel her breathe, feel like Im home here, now, with her.You having fun?My mouth is so close to her ear I can whisper.I can tell her anything, sneak explicit words beneath the musictell her every single dirty act I want to carry out on her body, and no one but Caroline will hear.Yeah.I feel her breathing, her back rising and falling against my chest, her heat and her excitement.We should go somewhere, I say.Have some more fun.Im not sure thats a good idea.But shes got her hands on top of mine, and shes pulling my arms tighter around her.Shes got her ass against my crotch, and shes pushing back into where Im getting hard, making me harder.This, we always knew how to do.My hands are at her ribs, crossed around her.I slide them up until theyre just under her breasts.Not quite indecent, but I feel the hitch in her breathing.I know shes getting wet for me, just thinking what I could do with one sweep of my thumbs.This feels like a good idea.She twists around, heat in her eyes, color in her cheeks.How much did you drink?Four beers.Youre not wasted.Buzzed is all.What about you?Two beers, and I switched to water a while ago.We study each other.Around us theres movement, shouting and laughter, posturing excitement, but it might as well just be me and Caroline, because I could give a fuck about everything else in the room.Shes sober, and Im close enough.We both know what were doing.If this happens, its because were deciding to let it happen, right now, unimpairedexcept Im never unimpaired around her.Ive been drunk on her since the day we met.Come upstairs with me, she says.You sure?Im not sure about anything.She wets her lips, the tip of her tongue flicking out, mesmerizing me.But yeah, she says.Come upstairs.I let go of her so she can stand up.I grab her hips because I cant help it.I need to grip her.I need to hold her and bite her, lick her and take her, everything I can get from her tonight, all of it, Im going to store it up, hoard it away.She covers my hand with hers.Interlaces our fingers together.She pulls me toward the stairs, up the risers, down the hall to her room.The framed Putnam Womens Rugby jersey on the wall above Carolines bed vibrates with the thump of the bass.I stand in the middle of the rug, not sure where she wants me.Im in the calm space at the center of a tornado.If I move too far in any direction, itll fling me out, fling me away from her.When she takes a step toward me, I grab her at the waist and pull her in.I get her right up against me, get my hands in all that hair, and I kiss her as if Id never stopped.As if we can start right up again, right now, and pretend everything in the middle never happened.She tastes like she always did.Hot and eager, wet and sinuous.Amazing.Amazing is all I can think as Im filling my hands with Caroline, breathing her in, licking over her lip and giving her my tongue, taking every eager pant like it belongs to me.I strum my thumbs over her nipples, the beat of the music inside me, the vibrating bass in my balls, driving intrusive seeking urgency in my dick, in my hands on her ass, my knee between her legs pushing her back to the bed, knocking her down.Im going too fast, too eager, but shes keeping up with me, lifting her hips into my hard cock with her legs spread, biting the tendon in my neck and sucking at me like she needs it this way, too.Fast and hard and important.God, it feels as important as breathing, the way the pressure builds when youre holding your breath underwater, your eyes closed, that urgency for air pounding away at you until you cant take it anymore, you just have to.I have to.We have to.She gets her hands under my shirt and rakes her nails down my back.Grabs my ass so hard I feel the bite of her nails on my taint.I keep kissing her.Its not a seduction, its an invasion, an attack, clashing swords, clanging shields, both of us desperate to get at each other, get inside the other, get there.Take this off, she demands, and I sit up and whip off my shirt, grab hers by two fistfuls of cotton from the bottom and pull and pull until its gone.Her bra is white and lacy.Her bra is sailing across the room to hit the locked door with a soft tap, and Im sucking half of her breast into my mouth and flicking my tongue over the tip while I massage the other and shes gasping my name.West.Jesus.Dont you think Im not interested in thinking.I kiss the words off of her mouth, push them aside, reach down and jerk at the laces of my boots and somehow miraculously manage to get them untied on one side while I start kissing her again.The other side gets knotted up.Whatever.Im not fucking stopping over boots.She had slip on shoes that shes already slipped off, so I go up on my knees and work at her button and zipper, shoving her jeans and panties down before she can say anything, because Im afraid shell see reason and make me stop.I get my hand between her thighs, my fingers in where shes slick and hot and soft, swollen, and Im a safecracker working at Carolines pussy.I know everything she likes, know it like I know how to spell my own name, so I spell my name all over her cunt, working two fingers inside her, my thumb pressing on her clit, not too much, just the way she likes.Her cheeks are blazing pink, her eyes closed, forehead wrinkled up like shes going to cry, and she says my name on a sob, West.Dont stop me, Im pleading, and she says, No, no, which is exactly what Ive been afraid of, although part of me recognizes the sanity of it.I mean, this is stupid.I know its stupid.This could ruin everything, ruin it worse than its already ruined, and until tonight I didnt know there was anywhere we could end up that was worse than where we already were, but there is.Theres this.This one thing I havent fucked up yet.My hand stills.My head drops to her neck, and she slaps my shoulder so hard.No, West, I meant dont stop.Dont, dont.Shes fucking herself onto my fingers, lifting and pushing at me, slapping the flat of my shoulder like Im a balky horse and she wants me to get a move on.Please.I never could say no to her.You have condoms?I ask.In my desk.Can you hold on while I get one?I dont want you to die on me.Now shes laughing, patting my shoulder where its got to be red, she hit me so hard.Hurry.Im already up and moving, yanking at the boot laces Ive managed to tangle up so bad, but theres no hope for them so I just pull the fucking thing until it comes off, nearly dislocating my ankle in the process.I take off my socks, and I can feel the music in my bare feet.The condoms where she said, where I keep mine in my own desk at the apartment, and it strikes me in the chest like it means something, but I dont stop to think about what that might be.I sit down on the edge of the bed, condom in hand, looking at her spread out on top of the covers like every fantasy I ever had.I jerk myself a few times because it hurts and I cant not.She sits up, replaces my hand with hers, pulls on me fast and tight so that I lose whatever I had left of a brain and turn into an animal.Lie down, I tell her, and its an order, my voice so low, so violent I barely recognize it.She doesnt object.She seems to know what it means, which is just that I want her so bad I cant talk or think or do anything but roll that condom on fast, get my hands under her ass, push inside her and yank her onto me at the same time, graceless and fast, hard enough to shut her mouth with a snap of teeth.Get your arms up, I tell her.Hold on.She scoots back, and I keep moving after her, moving my knees up as shes coming to a half reclined position so she can find a grip on the top of the headboard behind her.Then shes got a hold and Ive got her, my arms braced and gripping oak, her legs around me and squeezing into my hips, her pussy clenching, her tits bouncing with every thrust.Ive got her moaning under me, got the smell of her, the sounds of her, like nothing else.Like no other woman Ive known, nothing Ive had, no one like Caroline.Ive got her, but I cant stop chasing after her.We fuck fast and rough, and I dont know if its what she needs, but I cant do it any other way.If I slow down, stop to savor it, stop to thinkI cant.Theres no way but this way.Theres no one in the world but me and her, her pink nipples, her pussy, her lips and her eyes and her hair, the creaking bed and her bucking hips.Im fixated on her white knuckles lined up next to mine, clenching and releasing in rhythm.Thats where Im looking when she tightens up, and Im surprised by the sound she makes, the way it breaks over her face.Thats all it takes to push me overCaroline coming, the most erotic sight I know.Fluttering hot pleasure rushes through me everywhere, wrings me out, wrecks me for anything but her warm, soft body and my forehead against her temple, my mouth on her cheek, on her shoulder, resting on her neck.Then were breathing.Our hearts are racing, bodies cooling, the music pounding into the floorboards but its urgency pointless now, because were here.Finally.Here is where we were goingnaked and touching each other everywhere, soft, vulnerable, together.Im smiling into her neck, thinking this is the best monumentally stupid thing Ive ever done while drunk, when I hear another noise out of Caroline that doesnt sound like laughter.Sounds like crying.I dont move.Not until I feel her hands at my shoulders, pushing me.Shoving me away.Get off, okay?Her eyes are swimming.She shoves me again.Please, get off, I cant I will, I swear, baby, hold up, I say, because Ive got to grab the condom or well have a mess on our hands.When Ive got it secured, I pull out, sit up.She turns her back to me.I can see every bump in her spine.I wrap the condom in a tissue and throw it into the trash can by her desk, then sit back down next to her and put my hand on her shoulder.Caroline?She shudders.Dont.Talk to me, though.I cant.I dontjust give me some space, okay?Its not okay, because I dont know what that means.A few feet, a few minutes?A few miles?A few months?She was there for me at the school with Frankie.She stuck by me after what I did in Silt, stuck close to me since I came back to Putnam even though Ive been standoffish and inconsistent and probably fucking infuriating.She was with me just nowwasnt she with me?Christ.I stand up and dress, jeans and socks and shirt.I kneel over my knotted shoelace and spend an eternity unknotting it while Caroline cries.Something crashes downstairs.The sound of crashing and sobbing sends me tripping into dark channels of recrimination.Youve got nothing to give her, no business being here, no right to touch her, no skills to fix this.Youre worthless, youre toxic, youre poison.I sit down on the bed.Her crying is as empty as the sound the shovel made when I sank the blade into the dirt and piled up soil and rocks to dump on my old mans corpse.The only thing Id done in months that felt easy, because I knew that he was gone, and I knew I could put him in the ground and be done with him.There was my past, there, six feet deep.I was going to cover it with so much dirt that it could never claw its way out of that hole.He can never touch me again.Thats what I thought.Thats what I paid for when I paid for the funeral.But hes in me.He looked like me, talked like me, probably fucked like me, because I can remember being five years old and hearing my parents fucking and my mom crying after.You dont ever forget something like that.And no matter how deep I buried him, theres no way for me to pretend not to know that my father was the kind of man whod do what I did to Caroline after the funeral.I sure as fuck didnt enjoy it, but I did it.I closed my eyes and closed a fist way down deep inside myself and bludgeoned my way through it, telling myself I had to because it was the only way.Telling myself I didnt have a decision to make.Caroline was right when she read me the riot act in Silt.Everything she said, she was absolutely right.Everything shes said to me since.Im afraid.Im so fucking afraid of making any kind of choice, because ever since Frankie was born Ive told myself that thinking of me, of what I want, what I need, is a luxury I dont get to claim.Its all about Frankie.My life is for Frankie.If I live for her, I dont have to think about me.Ive been making excuses for inexcusable behavior, acting like the Fates snipped my threads so short that I just have to take whatever life shoves down my throat.I just have to breathe through my nose and swallow it and survive so Frankie will never know what thats like.But thats not living, is it?Survival isnt life.Survival is what you do when you dont get to choose.Im not going to wake up in the morning in my bed over the garage and pretend to be some kind of a role model for Frankie, some kind of a parent to her, after I left Caroline naked and crying in her bed.I survived that man.I wont turn into him.What Ive got to figure out is how to defy him.How to live a life thats rich in everything he never had, fulfilling and beautiful like he couldnt imagine, because he drove all the beauty away from himself.And it could be that itll always be harder for me than it would for some normal guy, because I started out the way I did.Im smart, but theres all this stuff I dont know.I dont know how to be a father to a kid whos safe.I dont know how to be a student just to be a studenthow to explore, how to waste paper, how to play.I dont know how to tell Caroline Im sorry and make her hear how much I mean it, and I dont know how to put what I did behind me and look toward the future.But I told her Id try, and I will.Maybe if I try ten times harder than anybody else, thatll be good enough to get the job done.I lie down beside Caroline and put my hand on her shoulder again, stroking up and down her arm.I close my eyes, fit my body to hers, and keep touching her, smoothing her, soothing and waiting.Whatever she needs.Whatever it takes.Im not walking away again.The night of the party.The music.The noise.Half an inch of foam on top of my beer, floating in its red plastic Solo cup.Half of me wanting to leave, go for a drive, go for a run, get away from what was coming for me.What was coming for me being West, of course.West leaning against a wall, sipping his cup and observing.West bending toward some girl, his head cocked, his lips curving into a smile, listening with half his attention even as his eyes roamed the room to find me.His gaze like a hand, heavy, stroking.The intention in that look.Hot enough to brand me if I stood still and let it sink in, which I did.I wanted him to look.I wanted him.The night of the party.The night before the party.The night after the party.Every night, I wanted to get my hands on him, get my mouth on him, sink my teeth into him, tangle our bodies up, crush our lives together, smash into him and keep doing it.Keep doing it.Keep doing it because it felt amazing, because I wanted it, because I didnt know how to stop.Wed found each other last year, edged closer together, closer and closer until we were so close that I couldnt imagine my life without him in it.We got inside of each other, dug in deep and held on, and when we collided on my bed that night, his body hot on top of minewhen I got his skin under my handsmy fingers remembered how to grip him.My body remembered how to take him in, twine around him, pull at his pistoning hips.But I cried when it was over because it hurts to surrender to that kind of violent need.It hurts to see yourself, your defenses down all around you, your wits scattered.Everything Id done since he came back to Putnam was in pursuit of that moment.That joy in my body, our two bodies together.God.That moment hurt.There was my truth, broken into pieces small enough to read: Hed hurt me.I hurt.Hed made me angry.I was angry.Hed driven me away, and I still felt the distance, even with his cock pushing hard inside me, his face in my neck, his tongue in my mouth.It wasnt the same.We werent.Maybe we could never be the same.Id told West there are no beginnings, middles, and ends.Think about it, I told him, because I wanted him to listen to me.I said to him that life is complicated, people are complicated, because thats what I believed.Thats what I had to believe.But saying that to Westeven if its truedidnt change the fact that hed written an ending over top of us.Written it with his mouth on another womans body.He pushed inside me, crashed into me, loved me and kissed me and fucked me until I came hard enough to see stars, only it turns out that seeing the stars when youre alone in the wilderness doesnt mean youll know how to follow them to safety.He was my north star once.That night of the party, I cried because the skies had changed.There were stars scattered across the black night, bright and gorgeous as jewels, but I couldnt read them.What I didnt understand right awaywhat I figured out that winter, trusting my instincts, trusting myself until I could believe it down deep insidewas I didnt need to know the way.The wilderness is life.Theres no way out of it.Thats not important.The important thing is that from that night, West was with me.West was with me all the time.When I come back to awareness of myself, the quality of the sound from downstairs has changed.Its not so raucous now, the music slow moving and trippy, voices conversing, laughing rather than shouting.The party is winding down.I cried myself to sleep, or into some kind of stupor.Wests got one arm over me.Its goodnot too heavy, not too much.Different, though.Hes so much bigger than he was in the spring.I can feel the weight of the difference against my breasts, snugged into my ribcage.From where I lie, I can see out the window to the sky.Hes awake.I can tell by the way he feels against my back.I turn over, lifting the arm thats between our bodies and letting my wrist drop against my forehead as though it might be some use in shielding me from the sight of his face so close.It isnt any use.Theres the scar through his eyebrow, the no color color of his eyes, his hair too short, his ears too small, his mouth so wide, and everything about him just exactly as it should be.I guess he could say, That was fun, but Ive got to get going.I guess its possible he could act like a douche, like Krishna might act, smiling and chattering while he backs toward the door and makes an exit.But there isnt any part of me that expects him to.Can we talk?he asks.Thats West.My West.I reach up on an impulse and slide my hands over his neck.Lift my shoulders off the bed, cool air leaking through the window on my naked shoulder blades as I set my mouth against his.I do it because hes here.Because I can.His palm finds my waist under the blanket he must have put over me.It rests there on my skin as he holds still and lets me kiss him.When I pull away, he says, Can I do that, too?I sink down, nodding, and then its him kissing me, cushioned in the softness of my pillow, his hands against my head making a hushed space where I can hear my heart and feel his lips.I think of all the words for kisses.Hot.Possessive.Questing.Fiery.This kiss isnt any of those.Its not any of the other things weve been to each other, eitherfun or funny or angry or supportive or dangerous.Its a kiss that says, Here you are.Here I am.Here we are.Kissing West that wayit makes me feel so much better.When he stops to breathe, I let out a long breath and tell him, Okay.Okay?Okay, we can talk.I was hoping that was what you meant, he says.And not, you know, Okay, you can go now.Thats not really my style.You didnt seem to want me here a little while ago.I clubbed you over the head and dragged you up here by one ear.Is that how you remember it?More or less, I admit.But theres this.He touches the corner of my eyelid.My lashes dried in clumps, and my cheeks still feel hot.That.Yeah.I didnt anticipate that.Me, neither.He lowers down and kisses me again, softly.We probably shouldve talked first, fucked each others brains out after.Then we might not have fucked each others brains out at all.Right.Were quiet for a minute, just looking at each other.Thinking about what we did, whether we should have.What it is were supposed to say now that weve come through months of separation and arrived here in my bed.West sits up, propping his back against my headboard.Im going to promise you something, he says.You dont have to promise me back.I dont think it has to work like that.I just want to tell youIm not gonna keep anything from you.Im done pretending that my business isnt your business.I want to be straight with you, Caro, because Im hoping He looks down at me, caution in the lines around his mouth.But his eyes arent cautious or angrynot the way theyve been so much of the time since I landed in Silt.Theyre just West.All of him, right there in his face.Im hoping what we did tonight means something to you, the way it does to me, he says.Even if you think it was a mistake, which, you know, it probably was a mistake, but if it was, I made it because I want you back in my life so bad.I didnt know there was anything inside me left closed to him, but hearing West say he wants me back just throws a door open inside me, and Im crying again.He scoots back down to the bed to wipe at my tears with his hand.Caro.No, its fine.Im fine.Dont baby me.I kind of want to baby you.Then baby me, but not because you think Im pathetic.I dont think youre pathetic.I think youre awesome.Im the one whos I cover his mouth with my hand.He lifts an eyebrow.I take my hand away.Isnt it time?he says.Dont you think its time for me to tell you how sorry I am?What a sorry ass piece of shit I am, and a coward, and stupid, and I cover his mouth again.Dont.He goes quiet, watching me for clues.Like I have a clue.I reach out blindly for the blanket, pull it up to swipe at my tears, exposing one leg to the cold.Everything feels so close to the surface.Scratch us anywhere and see what comes out.Wests confession.My anger.Wests reasons.My heartache.Wests abject apology.My regrets.I dont want to hear any of it.
