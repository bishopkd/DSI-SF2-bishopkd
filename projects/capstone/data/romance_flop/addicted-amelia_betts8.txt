I had viewed him as an exotic object of desire, untouchable except in moments of reckless abandon.Of course, he had presented himself that way, at first.But even after he had revealed his weaknesses to me, I hadnt really tried seeing him as anything other than the dark and dangerous sex addict who was using and abusing me.His hands eventually found their way to my waistline, his lips gently kissing the nape of my neck.I stopped him, knowing I had to.I wanna be your friend, okay?Not your groupie.I wanna help you.I pushed him away, but he came back at me with greater intensity.This is how you help me.He ran his hands up my abdomen and planted them on my breasts.Stop it!I wrestled myself away from him a second time and forced my way inside the car.He placed a hand on the frame so that I couldnt shut the door.Liam, Im gonna close it, I warned.Youll break my hand.Seriously, move away from the car.I will break your hand.No, you wont, you sweet girl.Ugh!Youre making me so mad right now!I stomped my feet and pounded the dashboard, reverting to my own form of childishness.I looked back up at him and noticed his face wet with tears.He smiled a weak smile that betrayed the opposite of happiness.Dont you see?You wrecked me the other night.I dont know what Im doing anymore.Liam shook his head, swaying a little in his stance.I slumped forward, letting my head rest momentarily on the steering wheel, thinking, Thank God.It meant something to him too.It was validationmaybe not in the form I would have preferred but reassuring nonetheless.In a way, I felt like we were back on the same page again, like we had been the other night at Sashas spa before he had told me it was over.Liam had that magical ability to draw me back in just when I was ready to give up on him.Fine, I said.Lets get you to bed.Thats more like it, he laughed.You know what I mean.I smirked.Dont get any ideas   Oh, Ive got some ideas, Liam said, and they dont involve bed.* * * I had never watched a gourmet chef cook this up close before.It was a thing of beautyhim whipping up a simple frittata with tomato, asparagus, and goat cheese, even if he was half drunk and stumbling between the cutting board and his skillet.Liam chopped like he had been the top of his class at culinary school, and he did this thing with fresh tarragon and chervil like he was weighing little heaps of the herbs in his palm.It was probably for show, but it made him look like a food wizard.While the frittata finished cooking in the oven, Liam arranged beautiful place settings on his formal dining room table, then lumbered into the backyard to cut some fresh flowers for a centerpiece.It was the most adorable drunken display of hospitality I had ever witnessed.Dear Lordhe took my hand when we finally sat down to eat, our steaming slices of frittata giving off tantalizing eat me now aromasthank you for sending Mischa, goddess of love, to take care of me on this dark night of the soul I laughed through my nose the way kids do in church.And may you keep her warm and safe from my inevitable advancesLiam glanced over at me with a mischievous smileforever and ever, amen.Amen, I echoed, and dug in.Oh my God, I said, tasting the eggy, cheesy perfection.Good?Liam asked, his mouth half full.Beyond, I replied.At the same ravenous pace, we ate our way through firsts and seconds and thirds in a comfortable silence that reminded me of the times Gracie and I had gone for greasy diner food after nights of drinking.Every once in a while, I studied Liams face when he wasnt paying attention, noticing how his mood had magically changed from dark to light.It had happened, actually, the minute hed started cooking, and I realized what he had told me the other night must be truethat he forgot his problems at work, that cooking really was his salvation.It was something to aspire to, I thought, to find the thing that would make me forget my problems.After wed finished, I walked him upstairs to his massive bedroom and helped him into his bed, which sat low to the ground on a minimalist frame.Knowing how drunk he was, I had no fear that Liams sex addiction was much of a threat at this point, so being in his bedroom felt like no big deal other than that it was intimidatingly grand like the rest of the house.On the wall behind his bed, there was a giant, modernist painting, and several other pieces of seemingly expensive art hung on the opposite wall.Its hot in here, he said, throwing off the sheet that I had placed on top of him.Come here.I took Liams hands and tugged until he sat up.Put your arms over your head, I instructed, then pulled off his T shirt.Glancing behind me, I saw the bathroom door ajar and went to deposit the sweaty shirt in his laundry basket.Behind another door beside the massive glassed in shower, I found the linens and grabbed a washcloth that I ran under cool water.Returning to Liams bed, I placed the compress on his forehead.Oh my God, he groaned.Thats the best thing Ive ever felt.How are you so friggin rich?I asked, giving voice to the thing I had been thinking ever since Id arrived.Even though it was a rude question, I felt like Liam could use a little frivolous conversation.My dad had money.He patted the small sliver of bed between him and the edge of the mattress.I shook my head, choosing to lie on the other side of him, on top of the covers.Liam glanced at me sideways with a pained look in his eyes.But I wanna lay with you, like in the biblical sense, he whined.How about this?I reached out for his hand, and he let me take it.Turn on your side, I instructed, and used my free hand to adjust the washcloth as Liam turned to face me.So, your dad had money.Does that mean he died?Yeah.Recently?Two years ago.Im sorry, I said.Stop telling me youre sorry He squeezed my hand a couple of times.I know you care, he said, then took a deep breath.I waited for him to say something else, but the minute he had hit the bed, I could tell it was going to be a matter of seconds before he passed out.His eyelids started to flutter, and he tried to make a joke but I could barely hear it.Youre gonna be okay, I said.I knew he was probably sleeping already, but I uttered the words anyway, because in that moment I wanted to believe themfor him and for me.Maybe it was leftover from my revelations at that nights OA meeting, but I sensed that change was on the horizon.I couldnt put my finger on why or how, but it was the closest thing to a psychic intuition Id ever experienced.Were both gonna be okay, I whispered moments later as I let go of his limp hand and kissed his forehead, hot from the alcohol.I stayed on the bed a little while longer to make sure he was fully asleep.I wanted to stay all night, cozy up to him and lay my head on his warm bare chest, let the sound of his breathing coax me to sleep.It took all the self discipline in the world not to burrow under the sheets and do exactly that.At the end of the day, I knew it wouldnt be right; in the morning, wed be facing the same problems wed come up against before: Liam was an addict and I was his drug.I cared for him too much now to ignore that.Even though it ripped me apart, I slowly rose from the bed and went down to the kitchen where I found a bottle of aspirin and filled a large glass with ice water, then tiptoed back upstairs to place the items on his nightstand.I fought the urge to leave a note.Mostly I just wanted to kiss him once more, somehow sensing this was a final goodbye.He was even more beautiful asleep.I could see the way he would be when he was mended, peaceful, no longer tortured by his compulsions, and longed for the parallel universe where Liam and I could be together.Outside it was foggy and dark; not even the stars or the moon could offer me company as I parted ways with Liam, seemingly for good.I drove up to the gate and it opened automatically from the inside, giving me no last minute excuse to stay.If someone had asked me three days ago whether or not my heartache could have gotten any worse, I would have told them no.And I would have been wrong.* * * I didnt realize how exhausted I was until the minute I crawled into bed at two a. m.  But before I let myself fall asleep, I tried to get back to that ecstatic peace of mind I had had in the parking lot, just before Bobby had accosted me, by taking deep breaths and naming all the things I was thankful for again.Just when I got to Gracie, I heard my phone ring and was shocked to see her name on the screen.Whats up?Is everything okay?I said as I picked up.Yeah, yeah, yeah, Im fine.I just cant sleep.Phew.Also, are your ears burning?I literally was just saying your name in my head.Ha ha, why?Are you obsessed with me now too?Basically.I laughed.You sound good for someone whos up at two a. m.  Oh you know, just livin the life.I miss you!I miss you too.We gotta hang sometime.What are you doing tomorrow?I dont know, I think Im free.Ha ha.Wouldnt that be great, if I could just come over and hang?Maybe you should visit.But I just left!I dont know if I can handle the instant nostalgia thing.So how are you?I turned on my side and propped myself up.Im actually good, all things considered.I mean, I had to talk Liam off the ledge tonight Really, what was that about?Oh, where to start?I took a deep breath and searched my mind for the relevant details.You know what?I said, after a substantial pause.Its not important.What about you?Gracie sighed.Meh.Same here, I guess.Havent seen the guy.Its probably a good thing Its all much ado about nothing, right?I smiled, allowing my eyes to close.Right on, sistah.* * * The rest of the weekend went by quietly.On Saturday, I took Cecile to a matinee showing of the R rated movie shed been dying to see, but said no when she begged me to get her nose pierced afterward.On Sunday, still artfully avoiding me, Julien took Cecile to his mothers house to celebrate the Fourth of July, and I went to Isabellas, where I made virgin daiquiris and she and I watched the neighborhood associations fireworks show from the perch of her golf cart.When it came time for the grand finale, I squeezed my eyes shut and made a wish that I would be accepted into Reids graduate program, even though it seemed more and more like a long shot as time had ticked by.What are you doing, Fluffy?said Isabella, poking furiously at my side.Open your eyesyoure going to miss it!The next day was Monday, and back to work.By that time, Julien and I had eased back into talking as if our late night run in had never happened and I was grateful for the awkwardness to subside.It seemed clear now that in my heightened emotional state after seeing Liam, I had misinterpreted the hand holding with Julien, which was in actuality nothing more than a fluke, not even significant enough to warrant a conversation.It was a great relief, and I was happy to return to our easy mentor mentee dynamic.I even mustered the courage to ask him to put a good word in with the graduate studies dean, and he eagerly agreed, throwing out a quote from a Maya Angelou poem about new beginnings, which I was miraculously able to counter quote.That night, Cecile reminded me of a promise Id made to cook her dinner, and I obliged.It helped that Julien was out for the night.It also helped that she had stopped bullying me ever since my meltdown the other morning.The only nasty comment came at the end of dinner when she requested fruit for dessert but suggested I skip it.I mean, youre gonna need to lose at least twenty pounds if you want Droolian Poundwell to look twice, dont ya think?Youre funny, I said, convincingly unfazed.We never negotiated dessert.Im gonna go shower.With that, I walked to the back door, swaying my fluffy hips back and forth so that she could tease me if she felt so inclined.She didnt.I silently congratulated myself, having finally come up with a strategy for Cecile that semi worked.I had left the air conditioning off in the guesthouse all day.Thus, my small but powerful window unit was still trying to catch up to the sweltering heat after the lukewarm shower I had taken to cool off.It was the kind of heat that dried you instantly once you stepped out of the shower, rendering towels completely unnecessary.Usually I swaddled myself before I even emerged, to negate the risk of catching my naked reflection in the mirror.But this night I found myself staring down my mirror image in the buff, and for once, I didnt want to recoil in horror.My body hadnt changed, despite being on the wagon all weekend, yet I found myself looking in a different way.Of course, the flaws were all still therethe fat and stretch marks, the big oval birthmark on the right side of my rib cage that I had always hated, the red creases where my belly foldsbut the voice inside my head, which sounded a lot like Cecile on one of her snarky days, was strangely absent.It probably helped that I had taken my mind off Liam and how I might win his love and had gotten back to worrying about my own life and what to do with it.I put my hands on my hips and allowed myself to stare, really stare.This was my body today, and nothing was going to change that.There were some good things about it too.I liked my breasts, and my feminine, rounded shoulders, my peachy skin tone.I liked my hands, one of the few places my weight never showed.I liked my smile, my eyebrows, my ears.Most important, I liked that I was still standing in front of the mirror and hadnt run away in shame.Fifteen For the rest of the week, I ate healthily and stuck to three meals a day without snacks.My skin looked better, and my mood improved dramatically.The stack of acceptance letters from grad schools that I had been ignoring finally made its way to the top of my priority list as I sorted through it, discarding the envelopes from schools whose registration deadlines I had already missed and poring over the remaining three as if they contained secret messages that would help me choose.And as hard as it was for me to imagine moving so far away, I finally decided on a plan Ba small program at a big state school in New Mexico.The decision was based on the academics alone, but it also helped that classes didnt start until January and I could still wait to respond, just in case Reid decided to accept me at the last minute.By Friday, I had dropped five pounds with what seemed like hardly any effort.I decided to celebrate by wearing a pair of plaid shorts that had long ago stopped fitting and surprising Cecile at her swim meet.Hey!Cecile ran up to me at the side of the pool where the spectators were gathered, dripping wet after placing second in a relay race.Cecile!You did great!I held my hand up for a high five that she reluctantly obliged.Thanks, she said, still catching her breath.Did you see this?I held up the crude sign I had drawn with a Sharpie sketch of a big, blue shark and Ceciles name in gold.Not surprisingly, she rolled her eyes.Yes, she groaned.I figured it would embarrass you.Thanks a lot.Anytime!I held out my hand for another high fivethis one she denied.Hey, Im gonna go out with the team after, and Staceys parents are giving me a ride.At the mention of her name, Ceciles friend Stacey ran up behind her and nodded at me from over Ceciles shoulder.Stacey was a hyper seeming girl who was very tall for her age, a good four inches taller than me.Does your dad know?I asked.Julien hadnt been able to make it to the swim meet that night.Just before I had left his office, he had mumbled something about a work dinner.Cecile shook her head while Stacey nodded at the same time, sending them both into fits of laughter.I smiled at the two, remembering that frantic rush of middle school camaraderiehere today, gone tomorrow friendships that bloomed and withered as quickly as actual flowersand told them to have a good time.Its not really my place to say yes, but Ill take the heat if your dad gets mad, I said, choosing to play good cop.Thanks a mil!Stacey piped in, and the two were off and running.* * * I had walked to the pool.On the way home I took the long route, following a street that looped around the periphery of Juliens neighborhood.It was almost summer solstice, and the sun was barely setting at eight p. m.  I could see the fireflies flitting about peoples yards and could smell the dinners being cooked on outdoor grills; the whole effect made me long for a trip home.This was the first summer I hadnt spent in Iowa, and I missed it.The summers had a certain balmy charm there, and whenever my mother had days off, she and I would fish, or sunbathe at her boyfriends neighborhood pool, or just sit around on her tiny porch and play cards.Wherever I ended up this year, Id have to find a way to make it home next summer if only for a short trip.I made a mental note, tacking it onto my list of a gazillion to dos.When I got back to the guesthouse, I passed out unexpectedly, facedown on the bed.My sleep patterns had become erratic now that my sugar and caffeine intake had gone down drastically, and these oddly timed naps were becoming a too frequent occurrence.The next time I opened my eyes, it was three in the morning and I was starving for the dinner I never ate.Knowing I wouldnt be able to fall back asleep without something in my stomach, I got up and snuck into Juliens kitchen as quietly as possible.The light from the refrigerator guided my way as I threw together a salad with some roasted chicken Id bought at the grocery store.It was simple, yet delicious and left me with no desire for dessert or any other sort of junk.Who was this stranger I had become?After that, I felt like another walk, so I crept back out of the kitchen and left the house through the side gate.It was cool and breezy outside, and the sound of the wind rustling through the magnolia trees was soothing, albeit a little eerie at this hour.I wandered for nearly half an hour, taking streets Id never gone down before, discovering cul de sacs littered with abandoned toys and strange, New Englandstyle gingerbread houses that looked terribly out of place among the scattered palm trees.I tried to put my mind on future plans, but thoughts of Liam kept popping into my head.I wondered if he was okay after the other night or if hed woken up even more depressed, as I inevitably did on the rare occasion that I drank too much.I wished I could call and check in on him, to hear his voice and gauge whether he was in need of more emergency intervention.Unlike the way Id felt after our night at the spa, I had no resentment toward Liam after seeing him at his lowest.I just knew that I cared about him deeply and wanted him to be okay.At the same time, I knew the best thing for him was for me to stay away.He was never going to get better with me aroundthe harshest pill Id ever had to swallow.And where did that leave me?If I was so intent on moving forward, I also had to realize that thinking about Liam wasnt going to help me either.But how could I stop?So much had happened over the past few weeks, I felt like Id had a years worth of experiences condensed into that short amount of time, and I was still trying to process all of it.Strange how a life can creep along at a snails pace, like mine had all senior year, and suddenly kick into high gear like a bullet train racing through time.I was glad to be up at this hour, to have space to think about everything without distractions.I used to take late night walks like this back in Iowa.For some reason, it had never scared me to be out alone; in fact, it had a calming effect.I embraced the way the world felt empty, like everyone had cleared out just so I could enjoy some peace and quiet.But wild animals were not something to be messed withthis much I knewand as I neared the end of a particularly dark dead end street around the corner from Juliens, I got spooked by a stray dog that looked hungry and wild eyed, its dirty white hair matted into dreadlocks.Switching into flight mode, I did an about face and walked in the opposite direction, careful not to provoke the animal by breaking into a run.When I rounded the corner onto Juliens street, stepping quickly and quietly with fists pumping the way Bobby had pursued me in the church parking lot, I glanced over my shoulder for the dog but it wasnt there.Then, just as one threat was gone, another materialized as I turned my gaze back toward home and saw a figure running at me in the distance.I stopped in my tracks and looked again for the dog, hoping that it might morph into my sidekick and team up with me to scare this new menace away, but the animal was nowhere to be found.Meanwhile, I noticed the runner had stopped, too, right around Juliens driveway.Squinting as hard as I could, I registered the green reflective stripes on the persons shoes and realized the shadowy figure was Julien as he made his way to the front door.Julien!I called out from several feet away just before he walked inside.Mischa?Is that you?He moved off the front steps, tentatively making his way toward me as I headed up the driveway.What are you doing?Relieved that it was him, I beamed as we came face to face in the driveway.Taking a walk.I couldnt sleep, I said.Oh, wow.Me too.Huh.Did you get my text?Cecile went out with Stacey after the meet.Yeah, did I not text you back?Shoot.I meant to say it was fine.Thats okay.How was your dinner?He raised his eyebrows.Umm fine.It was fine.Fine, fine, fine.Julien and I might have moved on from our awkwardness, but a bit of it obviously still remained.It didnt help that we were standing alone together in the middle of the night.Funny running into you, I said.Its rare to see someone at this hour, but we seem to have a knack for that.I shifted in place, hoping that my comment hadnt come across as flirtation.Yeah, I guess we do.He rubbed at his forehead like he was annoyed or had a headache.I noticed his chest heaving underneath his shirt and wondered if it was leftover from his run or if there was something else quickening his breath.Julien seemed to notice me looking at his chest and tilted his head, as if he was assessing what to do next.The same confusion Id felt that night hed touched my hand came over me, but this time I felt drawn to him.He was standing close enough for me to smell his sweat, clean like hed taken a shower just before his run.You look different, he finally said.I lost a few pounds, I said, both flattered and embarrassed.I dont think its that.You look happier.I am, I think.I laced my hands in front of my chest, rocking back onto my heels.The other night, I had been so quick to leave the minute things had gotten weird between us.Now I wanted to stay put and see what came next.Maybe I just needed the attention, but it didnt feel as superficial as that.Is it because of that guy?Julien asked.The one from the restaurant?I shook my head, taken aback.Was that a hint of jealousy in his voice?No.Were not really seeing each other anymore, I said, preemptively arching my back as Julien inched closer to me, and my chest spontaneously began to heave in time with his.With almost no space left between us, I could see his big brown eyes above me, just visible in the moonlight.Ive been thinking about the other night, he confessed.I leaned in, closing the gap between our bodies.I had no idea what I was doingacting on instinct, apparently.It felt reassuring to be this close to someone again, as if I had feared it would never happen after Liam.I closed my eyes and sensed Juliens large, powerful hands gently landing on my shoulders, lightly massaging them.Under his touch, I felt dainty and small.I hadnt thought much about the comparison, but he was a few inches taller than Liam, his build a little more muscular and wide.I let my forehead fall against his chest.It was nice, holding your hand, talking to you.Youre easy to talk to, Mischa.Juliens hips pressed into my stomach.I turned my head to the side and heard his heart pounding.His chest was warm and a little damp from sweat.What are we doing?I thought as I breathed in the smell of his deodorant, a lovely scent like cut grass.Every breath, every slight movement from either of us, was emotionally charged as we stood there, our bodies refusing to part.The moment felt clandestine.My fingers found Juliens, hanging at his sides, and we joined hands.I tilted my head back to look at him just as he leaned down to kiss me.The minute our lips collided, a well of passion seemed to pour out from both of us.Juliens tongue was warm and electric as it touched mine, causing my entire body to melt.I want you, he whispered as he crouched down to kiss my neck and my collarbone.Im sorry.Dont be sorry, I whispered back, unlacing my fingers from Juliens and running them up the front of his body.Grasping his shoulders, I stood on tiptoe to kiss the base of his neck, then closed my eyes and hung my head back, dying for him to kiss me again.I finally understood what it was about an older man that Gracie found so appealing.I felt young and innocent in Juliens arms, eager to be taught.But seconds went by as I anticipated another kiss, and nothing happened.When I opened my eyes again, I saw the same low angle view of the stars Id had the night Liam and I had made love on the street and felt Juliens hands slip away from my waist.Good night, Mischa, he said, awkward and abrupt.Wait!No!My voice trembled from the electric current that was still coursing through my body as I stood there on the driveway, suddenly abandoned.Julien only made it a few steps toward the house before approaching me again, this time to push a few strands of hair away from my face as he gave me a long, sweet peck on the cheek and told me Good night for the second time.Okay, was all I could think to say as he drew back again.Ill see you tomorrow, he said, his eyes darting back to the house.I nodded, trying to make sense of what had just happened as Julien drifted away in slow motion.Before he strayed too far, his big brown eyes met mine once more.After that, he turned around and disappeared inside, back to his house and daughter, back to his widowers bed.* * * When I awoke the next morning, it was to the sound of birds singing outside, something I hadnt noticed once since I had been staying here.Instinctively, I turned to look out at Juliens bedroom window but saw no trace of him there.The kiss last night had been wildly confusing, our goodbye premature.Yet it also seemed like the precursor to something potentially great.Part of me wondered if Julien was the answer, after all my tribulations with Liam, like everything I had gone through had been a trial run for my first real, adult relationship with a stable, reliable, older man.An unexpected knock on the door shook me out of it.Feeling certain it must be Julien, I rushed out of bed to answer in my tank top and boxer shorts.Hiiiiiiiii, Gracie greeted mea zombie behind large sunglassesas I opened the door.I couldnt believe my eyes.It was the closest thing to a mirage I had ever encountered.I know I didnt call, she said, her low voice dry and gravelly like she hadnt slept.What?!This is amazing.What are you doing here?I exclaimed.I hadnt known how much I had missed my friend until the moment she showed up on my doorstep.I embraced her excitedly, but her side of the hug was weak, like the life had been drained out of her.Oh no.Whats wrong?Can you smell the despair?She lowered her sunglasses to reveal the puffy eyes behind them.Come in.I ushered her inside, where she dropped her stuffed to the gills carry on bag and hobbled to the bed.I think your host family thinks Im a nutjob, she said.Did Cecile say something rude?Shes very fourteen.No, Droolian looked at me like I had two heads when he opened the door.I couldnt help but smile at the thought of Julien doing anything.Well, Ive never had a friend over.And didnt you tell him you were going to D. C. ?He probably thought you were a mirage, just like I did.I plopped down beside Gracie, and she immediately fell back onto the mattress, bringing her hands to her face in anguish.So, that guys a real asshole I found out.One of the great assholes, in fact.The junior senator?I said.Yes.Richard.She sounded utterly heartbroken upon saying his name.Richard Jackson Wellington Stipe the fourth.Stipe?Yes, like Michael Stipe of the ancient rock band R. E. M.  He claims no relation, but who else has that name?I mean, thats some name hes got on him, with the fourth and everything.I was listening to bad airplane radio on the way herebecause my phone is broken, because everything in my life is brokenand there was some song about how all that matters is being born with a good name.And Im telling you, this guy is like the walking example of that theory.Hes had everything handed to him.How I didnt suspect he would be an asshole is unfathomable.I looked back at Gracie, who was staring into the middle distance like shed just received electroshock treatment.Do you want something to eat?I asked.She shook her head fervently.I was secretly dying for an excuse to go into the kitchen, to feel out what Julien was thinking after last night.Ill get us waters!I said.And maybe aspirin?Do you want aspirin?Gracie had been massaging her temples like a madwoman.Yes.For Gods sake, get me twenty, she groaned.I smiled and popped up from the bed, my heart speeding up as I changed out of my pajamas in the bathroom and threw on a little sundress that showed just enough cleavage to make me second guess it.I brushed my teeth in record time and threw my hair back in a ponytail and waved at Gracie as I sped out the door.Knock, knock, I called out as I opened the back door to the kitchen.When no one answered, I wandered inside and found it emptyno Cecile, no Julien, no dishes in the sink to suggest that they had been there at all that morning.I thought it odd, particularly because Cecile usually left her cereal bowl for someone else to clean, but today there was no trace of them.I filled a couple of glasses with water from the refrigerator dispenser and poked my head into the hallway.Hello?I called upstairs, to no response.They must have gone out for breakfast, I decided, a little let down.In the guest bathroom, I grabbed a couple of aspirin from the medicine cabinet before making my way back to my pale, exhausted friend.Tell me everything, I said, delivering the water and pills, which she gulped down immediately.With a big sigh, Gracie deposited her glass on the nightstand and fell back on the bed.I did the same so that we were lying face to face.Okay, so you know how I told you we had sex in a public bathroom and it wasnt great?Yeah?So after that things were obviously weird.He was texting me kind of impersonal, jokey things and I wasnt responding because I didnt know what to say and I didnt want to be all chummy.Good for you, I said in solidarity, reminded of my similar resolve with Liam.It was always easy for me to relate to Graces stories about guys.I had a long history of going after the bad ones just like she did, so I felt her pain as if it were my own.The only difference between us had always been that Gracie consummated her affairs and I didnt.Until this summer, that is.And then, she continued, about a week after, we ran into each other at a fund raiser.You guys go to a lot of fund raisers.Thats all D. C.  is.Fund raisers.Sounds good to me, I said.Its great for free appetizers and booze, Im not gonna lie.Anyway, so he makes this big deal about me ignoring him, and I was like I havent been ignoring you.Ive just been incredibly overworked.And he was like, Oh, well you should come to the lake with me this weekend, and I was like, Wha?But I did it!I went to his familys lake house in Virginia and the first night we got there, it was like this glorious sex fest, like nothing Ive ever experienced before.Getting fired up by her own story, Gracie propped up on one elbow.Mischa, Im not kidding you, we did it eight times in one night.Thats impossible!I poked her side, teasing.Im not lying.Every available surface: kitchen, bathroom, two bedrooms, living room in front of the fire.Wait, why did you have a fire going in July?In Virginia?Oh shut up, it was romantic.Im just saying.Hot!Like hot hot.Exactly.So anyway, cut to his parents and brother arriving unexpectedly the next day.And its super awkward, because he thought they were going to New York, so obviously unannounced change of plans, boom, suddenly its a family affair.And this is not your typical family scene.He has a super old, rich dad, and way younger stepmother.And the half brothers like fifteen years younger than him, still in college.So anyway, weve got about seven generations represented.What did you do?Well first of all, Richard introduced me as his work friend.Which was pretty offensive to me after the sex wed had.Honestly, I would have been flattered if he had just said friend, but somehow work friend sounded like he was making a point drawing a line, so to speak.Well, it was an awkward run in.I mean, people say things off the top of their heads.No, it gets worse.So we all sort of do our own things that day.I read a book and laid out on the dock.The men went fishing.Richards mother did God knows what in the house all day.Im pretty sure shes a pill popper.But everybody came together for dinner that night, and it was surprisingly fine.A little awkward, but fine.However, I was drinking a lot because I felt uncomfortable and thats what I do.Right.I immediately pictured drunk Gracie with her red, red cheeks and felt a sense of dread about what was coming next.So later, after the parents go to bed, its just me and Richard and the half brother, Bryan, whos twenty one maybe but looks twelvehes like a skinny, mop headed, bizarro Justin Bieberand Richard suggests we go in the hot tub on the deck.And I kind of rolled my eyes, but Im like, Fine.What I really want is to have sex in front of the fireplace again, but I figured there was no way for that to happen with his parents around, even if moms is catatonic after nine p. m.  But then we go into the hot tub, and were passing around a bottle of champagne, and Bryan starts talking about how he cant get laid at his school because all the girls are fucking older guys these days.And then oh my God, Mischa Gracies voice filled with dread.She flopped onto her back and stared at the ceiling.Richard suggests that Bryan sleep with me!No.No, no, no.My stomach sank.Oh, Gracie, I said, reaching out and touching the side of her arm, not sure what else to say.Bringing her hands to her face again, she started to cry.He highly recommended me.He said I was a very good lay, and they both just laughed like it was the funniest thing ever.What did you say?She shook her head, wiping at her tears and turning back toward me as she regained her composure.I said nothing.I stormed out of the fucking hot tub, and I got dressed and got my stuff and called a cab to the nearest train station.And then I waited for five insanely long hours to get a train home.Did he try to apologize?Thats the worst part.He didnt follow me inside, so he didnt even know Id left the house.Then he was texting me all these stupid fake apologies, telling me he was just kidding and all that.Did you respond?No!Good.I held my hand up for a high five and she slapped it with gusto.What a jerk.I cant believe it.I know, right?I felt so bad for her and wanted to do something to cheer her up.I searched my brain, trying to come up with inexpensive alternatives since Id already spent last weeks paycheck on expensive organic groceries.And then it dawned on me.Heyguess what?Im taking you to the spa!Her eyes widened with excitement, but at the same time, she shook her head.No.You cant afford it.No, really, its free!Listen!When I left back in the fall, Sasha gave me a couples massage as a parting gift.She probably knew I would never use it because Im perpetually single.Gracie beamed.Why didnt you tell me about this before?Because I thought it might be a little weird, getting a couples massage with a friend.Oh forget weird, were doing it!Gracie flipped onto her back and sat up, suddenly alert.Something Id known about my friend ever since I had started the receptionist job at Sashas spa was that she loved a good massage.In fact, she had regularly booked appointments under my name so she could get the employee discount.You know what, Mischa?Youre all right.She winked at me from her perch on the bed.That guy doesnt know what hes missing, she said, referring to Liam.For a split second, as I picked up the phone to call the spa, I thought about telling Gracie what had happened between me and Julien, but it didnt seem right.She once had a major crush on him, after all, and she was now nursing a broken heart.Even though I desperately wanted to talk about it with someone, Id have to wait to spill the news to Isabella.Sixteen So whats the deal with your perma grin?Gracies voice wobbled along with the movements of the large Russian woman who was kneading her back with hot stones.My what?I turned to look at her quizzically before returning my face to the towel covered hole below it.Your perma grinthe shit eating Joker smile that spreads across your face whenever youre not pretending to feel sorry for me.Gracie!Im not pretending.I feel very sorry for you!Of course you do, now spill the beans.Gracie made a clicking noise with her tongue, urging me to obey.I didnt know what to say.I hadnt realized how much I had been smiling.Id have to tone it down and think of another reason for my good mood, other than Droolian Poundwell told me he wanted me last night.Hey, Gracie, I said, lets have our couples massage in peace, okay?If we dont talk through the entire thing, then whats the point?Its free!Thats whats the point.Here, hold my hand.Lets embrace the moment here.Are you kidding?Nope.She was clearly amused with herself as she reached over from her massage table five feet away.Humoring her, I looked over and took her hand as my masseuse pressed my head not so gently back into its towel hole.After wed been rubbed down, we sat in the steam room together in delirious silence.I had stayed up late, going over and over the kiss with Julien in my head, and who knows when Gracies last full night of sleep had been, so we were both on the verge of collapse.Still, my head wasnt devoid of thoughts.As we wandered into our separate shower stalls to rinse off, I found it impossible not to think of Liamthe girls shower room being practically identical to the mens.However, now that I had kissed Julien, the memory was less painful than wistfulI could look back on it fondly and not beat myself up for falling under Liams spell.A good thing, as more flashbacks awaited me on the sundeck, where Gracie and I tottered in our bathrobes after the showers.Luckily, I wasnt so overwhelmed by them that I couldnt nap on one of the deck chairs.In fact, we both felt quite refreshed after an hour of drifting up there, our hair naturally air dried, our rumbling stomachs telling us it was time for lunch.Downstairs, at the checkout counter, we saw Sasha, who hadnt been around when we checked in.Mischa, darling!You look fabulous.What have you done?My old bossa mess of blond frizzy hair and too much bronzerplaced her hands on her hips, rocked them side to side, and shook her shoulders in some sort of congratulatory hula dance.She was wearing a sequined beach cover up that looked cheap but probably cost five hundred dollars.I smiled, flattered.If she only knew that Id broken into this place for a sex romp, she might not be singing my praises.Gracie piped in to answer Sasha.I dont know what it is, but shes high on something.Well!Lets hope its not coke!Or if it is, tell me where youre getting the good stuff.She winked at me, then Gracie, closing one eye and then the other.* * * Wow, that is one crazy broad, Gracie said as we walked outside with the gift bags Sasha had personally prepared for us.Sweet, but crazy.I know.Hey, you want some tacos?Funny you should ask.I want my weights worth in tacos.Ravenously hungry, Gracie and I practically sprinted to my sweltering car, where we both burned our fingertips trying to buckle our seat belts.Where are we going?Taco Hell?she asked.No.Im gonna take you to this food truck run by these two Mexican women.Their tacos are out of this world.Julien showed it to me.Oooooh, Julien, Gracie cooed.I smiled but didnt take the bait.However, minutes later, tacos in hand and sitting on the bench by the beach where Julien and I had sat before, Gracie pressed the issue once again.Listen, youve been holding back on telling me whatever good news you have and thats very sweet.But seriously, I wanna know.It will be life affirming to hear about my friend having something fabulous happen to her for once.Guys are not all debauched rich assholes from Rhode Island with four names and sociopathic tendencies.I need to remember that So, is something happening with you and Julien because Im seriously getting a vibe.All right, all right, I said, another perma grin creasing my cheeks.We kissed.Omigod!Gracie shot off the bench and walked in a quick circle before sitting back down.What?When?Where?How?It was last night Omigod!Gracies squeals made the taco ladies crane their heads out of the truck, perhaps concerned shed found a palmetto bug in her carnitas.It wasI shook my head, searching for words to describe the experiencesurprising.I hadnt even thought of him that way.I know that must sound implausible to you Right, because hes a god.I laughed.I know you think that, but until last night, I had viewed him as untouchable.I never imagined he would go for someone like me anyway.And then we ran into each other in the driveway in the middle of the night, and it was different.
