I am starting a consulting company targeting bars, honky tonks, and nightclubs.Maybe I could come in and talk a little bit about my experience and what I do.Do you mind if I give you my card?Before Callie could open her mouth to say anything, Caroline added, And I could probably swing a sit down interview with Jax Dillon.Jax Dillon?Hes Caroline had the DJs attention now.Yeah, Jax is predicted to become bigger than Tim McGraw and not just for his hard partying ways and crowd pleasing hits.I met Jax six years ago.He played in the bar I was renovating before he got picked up by Big Machine.Jax is a great guy, down to earth.We became friends, both of us from small towns, and he is the nicest guy youll ever meet, Caroline said with a secret smile.We keep in touch.The two women exchanged a look, Callie probably assuming Caroline had slept with Jax, but the truth was, despite the smooth talkin Texans attempts to charm his way into her pants, shed said no.As much as shed liked Jax, she just hadnt felt that zing she usually did when the chemistry was rocking.Like what I feel with the bad boy sharing my living space?She wanted to slap the stupid voice in her head for even suggesting that.Thinking a man is hot and feeling a zing were two different things.If you can swing it, youve got yourself a deal, but I would have given you air time regardless.Callies words sank in, and Caroline blushed, something she rarely did.The words were spoken so softly, they were almost a reprimand, as if Callie was trying to say that Caroline didnt need to bribe anyone or use her feminine wiles to get what she wanted.But she was wrong.Everyone wanted something.I appreciate that, Caroline said, handing over the card shed fished out of her purse.Gemma piped up.Oh, you should head over to Bucks tonight.Travis is doing a show, and itll be packed.You can network and give Eric Henderson your pitch.Caroline smiled.Eric worked for her family when he was a teenager, doing yard work and such.She didnt think shed have any problem convincing him that he needed her services.Still grateful for the tip, Caroline warmed a little more toward Gemma.Thanks.Also, Hanks is a few doors down and pretty quiet this time of day.You should stop off there too, Callie suggested.Ill do that.Thanks for the help, ladies.Im also looking for a cute place to get some inexpensive paintings and knick knacks.Gemmas face lit up.Oh, I love Canyon Classics down the street.They have some great stuff, but if its not what youre looking for, you could take the ten minute trip to Buhl.There are several little shops I love there.Caroline wasnt sure if she wanted to drive anywhere, but she thanked them just the same.As she walked out the door, she almost plowed right into a couple.Im so sorry, I didnt see She stopped talking once she recognized the icy blue eyes glaring at her with blatant dislike.Ah, shit.This is gonna be bad.Shelbys face was twisted up into a scowl so dark, Caroline was tempted to warn her that it might freeze that way.Didnt anyone tell you that bitches arent allowed off leash?Shelby said, gripping the arm of her companion tightly.Caroline wondered if Shelby was imagining her neck as she squeezed.Probably.Caroline followed the arm up to a pair of wide shoulders, and the irony almost made her laugh.Marcus Boatman, the whole stupid, meat headed reason for their falling out, was staring down at her with an expression Caroline didnt like at all.It was a mix of astonishment and lust.Do not engage.Do Not Engage.DO NOT ENGAGE.First Im a skank, and now Im a bitch?Caroline said.Really, Shelby, if youre going to toss around insults, you should at least stick to ones you cant be lumped into.What the hell do you mean?Lets see.Since youve sunk into immature name calling ...whats that old saying?Im rubber, youre glue, whatever you say bounces off me and sticks to you?Shelbys lips thinned as Marcus stepped in.Come on, Shelby, cant you just let it go?Let it go?Shelby squealed, dropping his arm like he was diseased.The only reason she ever slept with you was because I wanted you, and she wanted to hurt me.How can you just let that go?Marcus turned away from Shelby, his face beet red as he asked, So, how long have you been in town?Three weeks, she said.Ive been lying low.That shouldnt be much of a challenge, considering how low you can get, Shelby said with a sneer.Shelbys innuendo was not lost on Caroline, and despite her personal vow to rise above and make amends, she just couldnt do it.Still pouting, Shell?Didnt anyone tell you that sulking is one of the least attractive qualities in a woman?Caroline said.Shelby stepped forward, as if she was going to hit her.Considering that the last time Shelby had started a fight with her, Caroline had kicked her ass, she had to give her former bestie props for being scrappy.Or stupid.I didnt come back to cause trouble or fight, Caroline said calmly, though she knew her stance belied her soothing words.If the bitch threw a single fist, she was going to drop her to the pavement.Hard.Yes, what Caroline had done to Shelby had sucked, and she regretted the petty mistake, but the fact that Shelby hadnt gotten over it by now spoke volumes about her own issues.Poor Shelby.Still chasing after the perfect guy and the perfect life.The two of them had met in pre K and, while they had both gotten good grades and stayed out of trouble over the years, Caroline had been the extrovert, and by the time shed started her freshman year, shed begun turning heads.Shelby had been pretty but shy, tagging along behind Caroline to parties and such but always hanging back.It wasnt Shelbys fault that she had been sheltered.Shed grown up as an only child, with perfect parents who had spoiled her and promised her she would have everything her heart desired if she just worked hard.She had been raised to be a little self centered, but Caroline had loved her anyway.Until Kyle had taken everything from herincluding her virginityand she had needed her best friend.Deeply depressed, she had called Shelby to confide in her.The minute she picked up, Shelby went on and on about something amazing Marcus had done, how hot he was, and if he would only notice her.For almost an hour, Caroline couldnt get a word in, until finally shed exploded, I was raped!Shelby went dead quiet on the other end of the phone for a moment.What?Taking a deep breath, Caroline repeated, I was raped.By Kyle Jenner.The senators son?Shelby said.Yes.Tell me what happened, Shelby said, and as Caroline told her everything she could remember, Shelbys silence was deafening.When she finally finished, Caroline asked, What should I do?I was going to tell my dad, but he stayed behind to talk to the senator and isnt home yet.You cant tell your dad, Shelby said quickly, surprising Caroline.Why not?Because ...I mean, what are you going to say?You were flirting with Kyle before it happened, right?Shelby said.Yeah, but ...but that doesnt give him the right to ...and he must have slipped me something, because I dont remember most of it So, how do you know you didnt say yes?Shelby asked.Caroline lost it.Because I wouldnt have!But if you press charges, everyone is going to know what happened, Shelby said, fueling Carolines hurt when she added, I just dont think I could do that.It would be so embarrassing.I didnt do anything wrong, Caroline said, nearly sobbing.Okay, but what if he didnt realize he was doing anything wrong, and then you accuse him Shelby, he laughed at me!He threatened me and my sisters!Does that sound like an innocent man to you?Carolines throat began to close, raw emotions choking her as a vortex swirled inside.Uncertainty, guilt, anger, helplessness, embarrassment ...she had been fighting them all day, and now, she could add another one to the list.Shame.I thought you would be on my side, Caroline said softly.I am.I just want you to be sure that you know what youre doing before you potentially ruin your reputation.Caroline scoffed.Why, Shelby?Because Little Miss Perfect cant hang out with a girl who cries rape?The silence on the line made Carolines hand shake with rage, and she screamed, Fuck you, Shelby!You are a selfish, arrogant snob who cant pull her head out of Marcus Boatmans ass long enough to realize that hes not interested.After that night, Caroline started avoiding Shelby, who had become one of those perky, giggling simpletons theyd once made fun of together.She avoided everyone, in fact.But the more Caroline isolated herself, the more she resented Shelbys perfect life with her two healthy, caring parents.It even seemed like Marcus had started to notice Shelby more.One day before Christmas break of their sophomore year, Caroline had seen Marcus lean over and give Shelby a sweet kiss after walking her to class.The whole scene was so sweet, so innocent.Two people sharing something good and pure and right.Witnessing that, something had snapped inside Caroline.Everything shed been told about love and guys and the best years of her life had been bullshit.She had no one to turn to, and she was utterly alone.Until New Years Eve.Caroline had gone to a party that one of the football players was having.Shed started drinking shots of whatever was handy and when she was totally shit faced, shed bumped into Marcus, who had offered to get her some water, to take care of her.But it hadnt taken much to flirt Marcus Boatman out of his tighty whities and into one of the empty bedrooms.It had been mean and spiteful.Caroline hadnt been drunk enough to ignore the fact that there would be serious consequences to her actions, but at the time, she hadnt cared.All shed wanted was to hurt Shelby the way she was hurting.Shelby had everything, and Caroline had nothing.The next morning, when she woke up next to Marcus, the self loathing sank in.She hadnt even liked him, but she had screwed him to get at Shelby.To try to make herself feel better by hurting someone else.After that, her reputation preceded her.She flirted with whomever she wanted and didnt give a fuck what anyone thought.Looking back, she could hardly remember all the fun shed had, but maybe that was for the best.Shed traded self loathing, frustration, and anger for a void of emotionless hook ups and numb oblivion.That was a long time ago.Move forward.I need to get going.Im looking at stuff for my new apartment.Oh, where are you living?Marcus asked, ignoring Shelbys glare.Up there, she said, pointing above Chloes Book Nook.Marcuss clear blue eyes looked into hers earnestly.Maybe we can get together and catch up.Well see, Caroline said, avoiding Shelbys murderous gaze.Nice seeing you.She passed Marcus and could hear Shelby behind her, hissing angrily.Why would you say that?As she headed down the street to Hanks Bar, she wondered for the hundredth time if she had made a massive mistake in coming back here.There were so many people she had hurt and betrayed in one way or another.She had taken her pain and anger out on everyone else and made a lot of enemies.You are a different person now.Leave the past in the past.That had been her plan, but the whole turn the other cheek thing might be too much for her.Edward Willis hadnt raised his daughters to back down from a fight.Eight Ive been told, To assume is to make an ass out of you and me, to which I reply, I dont have to assume.I know youre an ass.Miss Know It All   GABE WASNT SURPRISED that Caroline was parked in the lone parking spot when he got home; hed been counting on it.It gave him the perfect opening to discuss a few roommate conditions.However, when he walked into the apartment and found it fully furnished and decorated, he stopped dead in his tracks.The living room had a gray sectional against one wall, separating the carpeted area from the tile of the dining room.Across from it was a cherry wood entertainment center, with his flat screen smack in the middle of it.He had brought his belongings over from his storage unit yesterday, but now, there was no sign that he even lived here.The walls held several gray paintings with splashes of red and yellow.Finally, a modern silver clock was hung above the end table.The dining room was complete with a dark wood table and six chairs surrounding it.A gray table runner with black and red birds printed on it ran up the middle, the look finished by a black ceramic bowl filled with red apples.From there, the decorations spread into the kitchen.The words womans touch flashed through his mind, and he clenched his fists.This was supposed to be their apartment, at least for now, and it looked like Martha Stewart had waved her magic wand and sprinkled the place with dcor dust.There wasnt one item, besides his TV, that said a man lived here.Gabe marched down the hall, fully intent on giving Caroline hell for not consulting him, until he heard the shower going.Dont do it.Against his better judgment, he pushed the bathroom door open, his fury boiling over at the flower covered shower curtain and the shaggy pink rug in front of the tub.What the hell is this shit?His angry shout got the result he was looking for.Caroline grabbed the curtain and pulled it back just enough so that she could look at him with outrage.Get out of here, asshole!Im not going anywhere until you explain where you get off putting your shit everywhere without asking.You are fucking insane!This is my apartment, was my apartment first, and its not like you had anything but a TV, your bed, and a funky old chair.That doesnt mean you can come in here and froufrou up the place without talking to me first.Like I said, it was my apartment first, and since this is only temporary, you wont have to go out and buy anything until you find somewhere else to live.He should have tried counting to ten or taking a walk, but the way she stood there, hiding behind the curtain, with only her smug little face visible ...well, he lost his temper.You.Out, Gabe said, pointing his finger at her.He heard her loud sigh as she ducked back behind the curtain and shut the water off.Tough shit if she was annoyed.They were going to have it outnow.He wasnt going to be her whipping boy, taking whatever she dished out.If she wanted to stay, she was going to have to learn to share.The pink towel that had been hanging over the shower bar disappeared, and Gabe couldnt stop his brain from imagining all the lush curves she was probably drying with it.Little droplets of water clinging to her nipples ...What was it about this infuriating woman that reduced him to a twelve year old at the pool?If certain parts of his body realized what a pain in the ass she was, he wouldnt be having issues with the hard on currently pressing against the front of his jeans.When the curtain pushed back again, it revealed Caroline wrapped in the pink towel, her legs smooth and tan as she stepped out of the tub.Her dark hair hung around her shoulders, drops of water falling from the ends as she stood on the rug.The pink, frilly chick rug.Before he could say anything, she stepped up to him and pushed against his chest with one hand.You cannot kick me out, and if you dont hightail it out of this bathroom, Ill show you how fast I can castrate a man with just some dental floss and a Bic razor.Dont threaten me, princess, Gabe said, catching her hand against his chest.Oh, its not a threat.Believe me, she said, her voice hushed and raw.Barge in on me uninvited, and youll be peeing out of a straw.He had to give her credit.He was at least twice her height and weight, but she stood toe to toe with him without even a tremble.Maybe you should lock the door next time.I tried, but the lock is busted.I thought youd hear the shower and show some respect.Damn, she was trying to school him.And the worst of it was, he could picture her all respectable with a suit and glasses, that dark mass of hair in a tight bun as she slapped a ruler against her hand ...When had he started having bad teacher fantasies?Still, despite her point, he had his own to make.And you should have asked before turning the place into a fucking tearoom.This place is so female centric, I feel like Im living in a sorority.If I bring a woman back here, shes going to think Im married.Caroline tossed her hair back with a snort.Like any woman with taste would marry you.Well, that hurt a bit.You can think anything you want, princess, but Ive never had a problem with women.But the minute they see this place, theyll head for the door.Oh, you never know.Some women are into married men.The implication brought his anger back up to simmering.He had made a lot of bad decisions, but he would never get involved with a woman who would chase a married man.Well, Im not into those women.She seemed to be considering him seriously for the first time, with her head tilted to the side and her gaze thoughtful.Sighing finally, she asked, What do you suggest then?A video game chair and naked women posters all over the walls, held up by thumbtacks?The suggestion was exactly what most of his friends had had in their apartments when hed gotten out of prison, but he wasnt a horny twenty three year old anymore.Okay, he wasnt twenty three, but apparently he was still horny as hell.His gaze drifted down to the top of the towel, which gave him a tiny glimpse of the valley between her breasts.She was so damn sexy, and he had been an idiot to think he could resist her when she was going to be right here, under his nose.Within reach.Unable to resist, he reached up and brushed a strand of wet hair off her shoulder, trailing his fingers over the coolness of her skin.Im way classier than that.The posters would be framed.CAROLINE WOULD HAVE jerked back if his gesture hadnt been so fast.Before she could do much more than catch her breath, his hand was gone.No, she wasnt going to smile at his joke.He wasnt charming or funny.He was rude and condescending and Youre right.I should have asked your opinion, since we both have to live here.Wait ...What?Did you just apologize to him?His dark, pierced eyebrow lifted, as if he couldnt believe it either.Somehow, I didnt expect that from you.You dont know me, so quit acting like you do, she snapped.He crossed his arms and had the audacity to look casual.I dont have to know you personally.I can read people pretty well.Oh, really?she asked, mimicking his stance.Please, tell me exactly what you think you know.He moved closer, and her heart quickened as she smelled his cologne; light and male, it didnt overwhelm like some.Her nipples hardened against the roughness of the towel, and she hated that he could do this without touching her.He was wrong for her.Trouble.She could read people too, and this guy probably had bad news tattooed on his ass.Id say you have issues with authority and men in general.You like to be in control, and you do not like to be told when youre wrong.You have never been in a relationship that lasted longer than a few months, and not one of those guys ever knew you, not really, he said, his tone dropping to a harsh whisper.How close am I, princess?Too close for comfort; that was for damn sure.She squeezed past him, her body brushing against his as she scoffed, Whatever.But before she made it to the door, he reached out and took her arm gently.Are you saying Im wrong?His hand was hot against her chilled skin, and she imagined the rest of him was just as heated.The image of them pressed together, his hands leaving trails of fire across her skin, reminded her it had been a while since shed pulled out her battery operated buddy for a little alone time.She was going to have to schedule that in some time soon.For now, she needed to get away from Gabes dark, penetrating eyes before she forgot herself and took him for a test drive ...an idea that spelled all kinds of bad.Im saying that you probably shouldnt start offering psychic readings, she said, pulling her arm out of his grip and stalking to her room.As she closed the door, she heard him laugh, and it made her stomach flip over.The last thing she wanted or needed was to feel anything for the man she was sharing a two bedroom apartment with.Which meant avoiding situations that put them in close proximity and nearly buck naked.First thing Monday morning, she needed to fix the lock on the bathroom door.Grabbing underwear and a bra from her new oak dresser, she shimmied into them swiftly before wrapping her hair up in the towel.Her phone started blaring the Britney Spears song Boys, and she picked it up off her bed.Ellies smiling face flashed across the screen.Sliding her thumb across the talk icon, she said, All right, what kind of trouble did you get in now?You know, I resent that, especially when Im calling to help you, Ellie said, sounding insulted.Why do you and Val always assume the worst of me?Caroline grinned.Val and she were closer, that was for sure, but Ellie was wild and funny, easy to be around.Val almost tried to mother them both, even though Caroline was older.Well, you know us Willis girls, Caroline said, grabbing a simple black dress from her closet.Even when were trying to be good, we seem to find trouble.Dont I know it!Did you see Miss Know It Alls blog this morning?She said if I was a super villain, Id be the Enthraller, because I can control the male population with a flip of my hair.I swear, that woman either hates me or loves me, but Im not quite sure which yet.I didnt see it but sounds about right.Very funny, but its not important.Two things.I was calling to see if you wanted to go to Bucks with me tonight.I want to go to Travis Bowerss performance, but all my friends are busy, and Val is going with Justin and his friends.Aw, nothing like being last choice, Caroline teased, not taking it personally.Ellie and she had been getting to know each other again as adults, but they still had their awkward moments.Come on, dont give me shit.Just say youll go.I cant go to Bucks alone or guys will think Im available.And you arent?Caroline asked.She hadnt realized her little sister had a boyfriend.No.Okay, are you going to tell me about him?Nothing to tell yet, Ellie said casually.Were hanging out ...testing the waters.Oh well.If Ellie wasnt ready to share, then Caroline wasnt going to push her.Fine, Ill go with you.Awesome.Can we take separate cars, though?I might have to cut out early.Even though she wouldnt push, it didnt stop her curiosity from almost getting the best of her.Fine.Ill meet you there around six thirty.I want to do a little networking before it gets crazy.Great!And the other thing?Caroline prodded.Oh, right, I need you to handle the birthday cake for Vals birthday.Justin and I are planning a barbecue, but if I make the cake, shes gonna know whats up.Caroline groaned.Seriously?Cant I just order one from Halls?No, this is tradition!We always have homemade cakes for our birthdays!Ellie said, adding with a giggle, Remember that cake Val and I made for your sixteenth birthday?We tried to make it in the shape of a car.But it came out looking more like a shapeless blob.Yes, I remember, Caroline said, her heart squeezing.It was one of the last birthdays shed celebrated at home.See, and you loved it.Vals favorite is rainbow chip, in case you forgot.Ill see you tonight!Her sister hung up the phone before Caroline could protest again.The fact that Ellie hadnt wanted to share her boyfriends name bothered Caroline.Most women wanted to be seen with their significant others, not hide them away.Unless theres something wrong with himlike being married.Which was exactly why she avoided getting involved in other peoples business.Dealing with other peoples baggage was too much for her emotionally.Her own baggage could fill up an airplanes cargo hold.Besides, she had been so caught up in her work and becoming successful, it hadnt left a lot of time for relationships, except perhaps of the wham bam, thank you man variety.She heard the shower start up next to her room.Gabe was in there, lathering up all that hard muscle and delectable mocha colored skin.It would be so easy to walk in on him and offer a little roommate perk.You wanted a fresh start, to prove you arent the same girl making bad decisions.That means a successful business, playing nice with the rest of the townsfolk, and dating a respectable man, not the convenient bad boy you could never get serious with.Quickly, she headed for the closet to grab her shoes.She needed to get the hell out of there before she did something shed regret.Nine For some reason, Bucks Shot Bar is a breeding ground for drama and stupidity.Oh, waitmaybe because its a bar and theres alcohol.Oh, and the Coulter brothers.Not a night goes by that they arent there, getting into whatever trouble they can.And yet, charges never seem to stick ...Could they have a GET OUT OF DRUNK TANK FREE card?Police corruption in Rock Canyon ...Hmmm, suddenly I feel like Veronica Mars.Miss Know It All   WAIT, YOURE DITCHING me?Ellie said loudly.Caroline rolled her eyes.No, Im just going to talk to Eric about doing some consulting for Bucks.Ill be right back.But the whole point of us going together was so guys wouldnt think I was here trolling!Ellie, Ill be back before any guys notice youre alone, Caroline said, although her sisters sheer top with the hot pink bra and tight jeans didnt really give off the not interested vibe.As if reading her thoughts, Ellie crossed her arms over her stomach.Fine, but hurry up.Caroline pushed her way to the back of the bar where shed seen Eric Henderson, pulling down the light fabric of her simple black dress.Her dress was conservative enough to be business casual but had an understated sexiness that hugged her curves and said, Howdy, boys.Im available.She was surveying the crowd, checking out a few men over by the pool tables, when she saw Gabe leaning over to make a shot, his muscular arms taut as he sent his stick into the ball, spinning it across the green to sink in a corner pocket.He stood up with a pleased look, and she noticed a blonde jumping up and down next to him, squealing.Irritation shot through her as the blonde jumped on Gabe, throwing her arms around his wide shoulders.Gabe wrapped one arm around her waist and pulled her close, whispering something in her ear.The woman laughed, and Caroline finally got a good look at her.Kirsten Winters.Why was she even surprised?Gabe was hot, and the one thing Kirsten was drawn to was a good looking man.Caroline would never call another woman easyhaving heard the word connected with her name way too oftenbut she would say that Kirsten had enjoyed plenty of guys in high school.So why do you care if she enjoys Gabe?She didnt.Caroline was only irritated that Gabe seemed to be everywhere.In the apartment, here at Bucks ...It was too small of a town not to realize she was going to see way too much of him and his gorgeous black eyes.Suddenly, she crashed into a hard body and opened her mouth to apologize, but Marcus Boatman spoke first.We have to stop meeting like this.Yes, they certainly did.The last thing she wanted was to give Marcus any sort of encouragement, especially since he was obviously dating Shelby.She could deal with the animosity from her past deeds, but no way in hell was she going to hook up with Marcus again.He hadnt exactly been mind blowing in high school, and somehow she doubted hed improved with age.Hey, Marcus, sorry.Im on my way back to talk to Eric What for?Marcus interrupted.She caught the narrow eyed look he was giving her.It was none of his damn business, and she was just about to tell him so when she was pushed from behind.Stumbling forward on her heels, she would have gone down hard if Marcus hadnt caught her.Get your hands off her, Marcus!Shelby squawked over the blaring of the opening band.Caroline couldnt believe she was getting this twice in one day and that the bitch had the audacity to push her.Twisting around to face her assailant, she resisted the urge to shove her back.She was here on business, after all, and it wouldnt do to get thrown out of a bar she wanted to work with.You really should look into some anger management courses.Shelbys face turned purple, and she snapped, Stay the fuck away from my man.Okay, this was too Jerry Springer for her.A small crowd was already taking notice of them.Shelby, Im not interested in Marcus.I bumped into him; thats it.Shed tried to speak slowly and calmly, but that seemed to just irritate Shelby more.Caroline realized too late that the woman had already consumed a few too many drinks.Before she could get out of the line of fire, Shelby launched herself at Caroline, and all she could do was brace herself for the first blow.A blow that never came.Instead, Shelby screeched with outrage, and Caroline opened her eyes to find Gabe standing next to Shelby, his hand clasping her arm in a tight grip.Maybe you should get her out of here before she does something stupid.Gabes suggestion was directed at Marcus, who almost looked like he was going to argue, but in the end, he took Shelbys arm from Gabe, saying, Come on.Shelby hurled insults at Gabe and tried to pull away from Marcus, who finally dumped the drunken wildcat over his shoulder and pushed through the crowd.As the crowd that had gathered dispersed, Caroline was left facing Gabe, hating the fact that he had saved her from a disastrous situation.Thanks, but I could have handled it.I figured, but now you dont have to.His cool answer pissed her off.Did he think hed done her some huge favor?That she wouldnt have to deal with Marcus and Shelby again?Do you always jump into tense situations?Is that what gets you off?Saving the poor, defenseless, wronged woman?Caroline said, sneering.Dont worry about me, hero.I deserve everything they throw at me and more.If you dont believe me, just ask around.Im sure someone would love to give you all the sordid details.Regardless of what youve done in the past, she was out of line.I could tell you were trying to take the high road, and I know what thats like.You try not to fight back, cause you figure theyll back off if you dont play their game, but thats not always true.His observation hit home for Caroline, and a small part of her wanted to ask him about his story, about what he was trying to atone for, but that might give the impression that she cared.Which she didnt.At all.Well, again, thanks.At least now I can do what I came to do, she said, catching sight of Eric behind the bar.Yeah, whats that?Ive come to see a man about a bar, Caroline said, smiling at her own joke.Well, Ill let you get to it, Gabe said, leaning over to whisper close to her ear.Ill see you at home, princess.Caroline fought the shiver that the heat of his breath caused across her neck and down her back.As he went back to playing pool with Kirsten, she told herself that the irritation churning in her abdomen was because of Shelbys causing a scene and had nothing to do with the way the stacked blonde slid her hand possessively over Gabes bicep.Turning her back on them, she walked straight up to Eric and said, Well, hey there, handsome.Eric looked over his shoulder from filling the beer fridge, his forehead furrowed for a minute before he recognized her with a whoop.T R O U B L E!Caroline laughed as the big man came around the bar and wrapped her in a bear hug that lifted her up off the ground.It was good to know that not everyone in Rock Canyon thought she was scum.Being called trouble was the friendliest thing shed heard since arriving back in town.When Eric set her down, he gave her a smacking kiss on the mouth that startled her, considering he had never done anything like it before.Eric had worked on their yard every summer for years, and after her mom died, she had followed him around and helped out when she could.Shed always nursed a bit of a crush on Eric, but hed never treated her like anything other than a kid sister.As shed gotten older, he used to tease her about all the trouble she got into, but it was always playful.When he caught her surprised look, he leaned over and said loud enough to be heard over the music, Were being watched.Caroline pulled away, her eyebrow raised as he gave a subtle nod to the left.Caroline glanced toward the end of the bar and saw a pretty blonde with shoulder length hair glaring at them.Gemma and Callie, who were next to the woman, waved at Caroline.Waving back, Caroline tried to place the blonde.Are you using me to make her jealous or to make her leave you alone?Erics smile was wide and sheepish.Jealous.Caroline put her hand on his chest and batted her lashes.And what do I get out of this little scenario?He covered her hand with his and squeezed.Step into my office, and well discuss business.Caroline let Eric lead her toward the storeroom and close the door.Leaning against the shelves, she asked, So, who is she?Gracie McAllister.I think she was a year or two behind you.Cradle robber, Caroline teased.It doesnt matter.She wont give me the time of day.Really?Cause she was glaring at me so hard, Im surprised she didnt burn a hole through my skull.Yeah, its complicated, he said, crossing his arms.So, I hear youve got a business proposition for me.Who told you?Caroline asked.One of the bartenders at Hanks said you stopped by.I did.Well, lets hear your pitch.Lord knows Hanks is already kicking my ass on karaoke night.GABE KEPT GLANCING toward where Caroline had disappeared, wondering how long shed been dating the big bartender.When the guy had kissed her, Gabe had barely resisted the urge to snap his pool cue in half.Is this what gets you off?Her words had slammed him in the gut and brought to mind all kinds of images that would definitely do it for him.Most of them featured that little black dress on the floor of his bedroom and her sprawled across his bed.Hed start at the top of her head and work his way down, pausing at all the interesting spots until he reached the juncture between her legs.Hed pull her legs over his shoulders and dip his head down to kiss her p Its your shot, Gabe, Kirsten said sweetly, tossing her thick blonde curls over her shoulder and reminding him that he had no business lusting after Caroline.Kirsten, on the other hand, was exactly the type of woman he should be lusting aftercasual, sexy, and knew exactly what the score was.She was looking for a good time, just like he was.He was leaning over the table, lining up his shot, when Caroline came out of the storeroom, her hair tousled.She threw her head back and laughed at something the big guy said.Are you going to take your shot or what, man?one of the cowboys he was playing with asked impatiently.Gabe pulled back, aimed ...And blew his shot to hell.Shit, he said, ignoring the laughter from the other man.Gabe scowled at the two men.Hed been fine playing with Kirsten, taking it slow and just having fun, but when the cowboys had approached him with two hundred on the winner, he couldnt resist.He assumed the two of them were related; not only did they have the same coloring, but even their high pitched hyena laughs were almost identical.Better luck next time, the shorter one said, snickering as he lined up his own shot.Gabe wasnt happy about missing the shot, but he was too distracted by watching Caroline maneuver through the crowd to dwell on it.He couldnt miss the way men checked her out and a few even tried to engage her in conversation.The smile she gave them was polite, but she kept moving on.Was she here alone?Despite the fact that shed grown up here and that Rock Canyon was a small, tight knit community, he couldnt believe shed be stupid enough to go to a bar alone.Someone could spike her drink or attack her as she walked to her car.It was none of his business what she did or what stupid mistakes she made.Thats what he kept telling himself as his irritation rose.Im out, Gabe said suddenly, dropping his money onto the table.One of the men stepped into his path.Lets finish the game.Gabe looked into the smaller mans scowling face and said, You got my money, cowboy.Were square.Turning away, he heard the other man mutter something that sounded a lot like pussy.Gabe swung back around before he could rein in his temper.What was that?Come on, Walt, hes right, the other man said, wrapping his arm around Walts shoulders.Were square.Lets get another round and see if we cant talk to a couple of pretty girls.Walt followed his brother to the bar, giving Gabe a wide berth.Gabe watched them until a soft hand stroked his arm.Dont mind Wayne and Walt, Kirsten said, bending over the table to rerack the balls.If they arent starting something, I think theyll wither up and die.Before he could say anything, Travis Bowers took the stage, and the whole bar exploded into whistles, cheers, and applause.When the crowd calmed down, and Travis started his first song, Gabe spotted Caroline talking to another dark haired woman, who kept checking her phone.Wonder if thats the other sister she warned you away from.Remembering the way Carolines face had flushed when Valerie had called her out on her rudeness still left him smiling.He hadnt thought much of anything frazzled her, but apparently being called out on her misbehavior could.So, do you want to get out of here?Kirsten asked.Gabe looked down at the woman with the open invitation and was surprised that he didnt find her nearly as appealing as he had earlier.Maybe it was that she was too available and suddenly, he wasnt interested in the easy conquest.Whats the matter with you?This is exactly what you came out looking for.Someone to have fun with, ease a little tension.But that was before a vixen in a black dress had walked in and wrecked his night.Okay, so she hadnt really done anything on purpose.She hadnt even seen him before hed stepped up and grabbed that drunk womans arm, but he had noticed her the minute she walked in.While every other woman around wore hip hugger jeans and flashy tops, she looked classy as hell.And sexy.He couldnt forget sexy.It seemed like no matter how many times he told himself he wanted nothing to do with Caroline, he sought her out.I was actually going to stick around and grab another drink, he said, realizing that Kirsten was standing there waiting for his answer.She shrugged.Maybe another time.Pulling a pen out of her purse, she scrawled her number down on a bar napkin and handed to him.Call me.Gabe put the number in his pocket as she got lost in the crowd.He was a little surprised she hadnt tried harder to get him home.Shed seemed like the aggressive type.His gaze strayed again to Caroline as she talked to her sister.At least she wasnt there alone.Both women were drinking brightly colored cocktails, and he wondered if he should offer to drive them home.Shed probably tell him to fuck off, but at least then his conscience would be clear.If he checked in on her and she didnt take his help, it was on her.Gabe took a few steps toward them but paused when another man with sandy hair stopped to talk to Caroline.You should still go by and just offer to walk her out.It would be the gentlemanly thing to do.Then he caught the expression on Carolines face: pure joy and excitement as she reached up to hug the blond man.Obviously, the guy was someone she was happy to see.That was good.Someone she knew well and would look out for her.It took the responsibility off Gabes shoulders, and his momentary concern could be chalked up to just wanting to be a good roommate.And the fact that youre attracted to her and dont want anyone else to have her.That was crazy.He knew the score.No decent woman wanted an ex con, especially one with as much baggage as Gabe.Even with Carolines past reputation, he knew quality when he saw it.Besides, he had Honey and his dream shop.There just wasnt room for anything else.Pushing the opposite way through the crowd, he went in search of Kirsten, to see if her offer was still on the table.Ten Ive been told you reap what you sow ...Ominous sounding, isnt it?Miss Know It All   WILL YOU STOP checking your phone every five minutes?Caroline snapped.Since shed returned from talking to Eric, Ellie had looked at her phone at least a dozen times, even when shed tried to introduce Ellie to Gregg Phillips and his wife, Ryan.Gregg and Caroline had been boyfriend and girlfriend in eighth grade, and hed been her first kiss.Theyd drifted apart during their freshman year of high school, but Gregg was a good guy.She was glad he was happy now.What?I told you I have plans tonight, and I dont want to miss his call, Ellie said.Caroline itched to question her about this mystery man and why he couldnt just come out and meet them, but it wasnt her place.Ellie was a grown woman who could see whomever she wanted.Even if her sisters secretive behavior was making Carolines dirt bag radar go haywire.The only guys who liked secret relationships were already attached.Whether they were married or just dating another woman, it never boded well.Caroline had been the other woman before, mostly unknowingly, and the aftermath was always bad.Ellie, its past nine.I think if he was going to call, hed have done it by now, Caroline said as gently as she could over the music.Besides, if he calls you after midnight, hes just looking for a little play, and you deserve better than that.Please dont give me the spiel about how I need to respect myself, and men will respect me for it.I get enough of that crap from Val and the biddies of the Morality Squad.Caroline finished her drink and set it on the bar behind her.Putting her hands up as if surrendering, she said, Hey now, I have no right throwing stones or advice at anyone.And Im the last one to lecture you on moral code.I just wanted to caution you, as your older sister who has made plenty of mistakes involving men, that the good guysthe ones you want to marry and have kids withdont usually make booty calls.Who says I want to get married?Ellie said flippantly.I havent seen one instance where marriage did anyone any good in the long term.I mean, every week it seems like Miss Know It All is writing about some other couple breaking up or having an affair.Im just wondering, what is the damn point?Okay, hey, I dont want to fight, Caroline said.Im not fighting; Im expressing a valid opinion, Ellie said.Caroline understood now why Val constantly wanted to strangle Ellie.She just couldnt take advice with grace.Couldnt accept the fact that someone older and with more life experience might know what she was talking about.Val had been griping for weeks that Ellie continued to make the same mistakes over and over and never seemed to learn her lesson.But someday shed learn the hard way what rash decisions and bad choices could get you: a whole lot of heartache.Bad decisions, like moving in with a guy you hardly know?Caroline was still trying to wrap her head around that decision.Okay, yeah, things had been uncomfortable at Vals, and she hadnt been sleeping well, but she could have toughed it out.Shed slept in her car for months at a time; she could have handled a lumpy couch.But in a moment of weakness and frustration, she had said yes to living with a man she didnt know.Who was even now chatting up a woman, probably to bring her back to the apartment they shared.Just the thought that she might have traded her sisters sex noises for Gabes made her want to hit someone.Well, Ellie, aint you just as pretty as a picture, Wayne Coulter said as he sidled up to her.Fuck off, Wayne, Ellie said, checking her phone again.Now, thats not very nice, his brother, Walt, said, his gaze traveling slowly over Caroline.Caroline remembered the Coulter brothers, although they were even older than she was and had continued to hang out at high school parties after they graduated.Even at her worst, shed avoided them like the plague, trusting the instincts that told her they were bad news.Finally, Ellie said, putting the phone to her ear and heading toward the door.Was she going to take the call and leave, or would she be back?Caroline wasnt sure, but having the Coulter brothers full attention was enough to tell her it was time to go, either way.Gentlemen, Caroline said, starting to walk past them, only to be stopped by Waynes hand wrapped around her bicep.Whats your hurry?Caroline tried to shake off his arm, but he didnt let go.You have about two seconds to get your hands off me before I scream for Eric.Wayne dropped her arm.Now, come on, I was just trying to be friendly.Maybe you should try not being an asshole.I hear that works sometimes.Waynes face flushed.You bitches think the sun rises and sets on your ass.Acting like a man oughta lick the mud from your boots before he even speaks to ya.Not every man.Just you.Youre gonna regret talking to me like that.You just wait.Wayne, are you bothering this lady?a friendly voice said at her elbow.Cause if I remember correctly, Eric told you if he caught you bothering any more of his patrons, you were going to have to find another place to drink.Caroline turned to look up at her would be savior, unable to place him.Fuck you, Stevens, Wayne said before turning away from them and heading toward the door, with Walt close behind.
