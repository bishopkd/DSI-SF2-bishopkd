You are worried about sleeping with him, right?Mary half nods.Well then the problem is simple.Take the plunge.Everything else will work itself out after you do the deed and get it out of the way.Jills face heated as blood rushed to turn her face a cherry red.I dont believe you had the nerve to suggest such a crazy ass idea.Mary dont you dare listen to that nonsense.That is nothing but bullshit.Listen to me, Mare, you need to just slow down and take it easy and dont be so hard on yourself.That is all you need to do.You are just blowing things out of proportion and it is making you nuts.Mary, dont listen to her shit, you know what you need to do, said Barbara with an evil look to Jill.Now be honest.What is the main problem that you are having with the relationship?Mary knew the problem well, you are right, Barb.I keep thinking about the next step and where to go from there.Like I said, take the plunge and get it over with.Jill was not happy her best friend would take advice from a whore like Barbara and ignore sound advice from her.Mare, you have to be realistic.You dont just hop into bed with some guy because you are told that it will make things better.It wont, believe me.Take it slow and it will get better over time.Yeah, like you and Bert?Mary doesnt need that kind of advice because it will not lead to anything good.Sex is nothing but sex and if you get it out of the way you can see clearly as to what the next step should be.Thanks, Barb.Shes right, Jill.I should get sex out of the way and see if we can build something special from there.Im just too chicken to make a move and I have got to plow ahead and take a chance.Mary opened her desk drawer and reached for a mini bottle.Oh no, no, no, no, said Jill.If you are going to take the plunge you are going to do it sober and in charge.Jill looked at her best friend and wanted to do all she could do to help her.First things first, Mare.Do you have any condoms?I cant even remember when the last time I saw a condom was, let alone when I used one.Mary started laughing.Barbara and Jill laughed with her.Then Barbara took the lead and asked, How does the garden look these days, Mary?Do you shave or just let it grow wild down there?Barbara gave a nervous chuckle.Mary blushed.I guess I could use a trimming.She turned a light shade of red.Maybe a weed wacker.She laughed with her girls.Ill make you an appointment with Sara, she is fast and delicate.Jill winked at her friend to reassure her of her honesty.And Ill get you some appropriate drawers that will not only dazzle, but will make him stand up and take notice.God knows you dont have anything to do the trick.Added Barbara with a laugh.Well dont make me look like a hooker; I have enough problems already without having to worry about a sales price.Mary laughed nervously, wondering why she had agreed to this insane idea in the first place.Dont worry, Mare, you are in good hands and we will take care of you.Ill be back in a minute.Jill got up to leave.She stopped in her tracks, turning to Barbara.Dont let her drink a thing, not one drop.She looked at Mary and said, Promise?Yes, mother.I wont touch a drop.Goodbye.Go on, said Barbara to Jill.Well be fine.Jill left and Barbara turned to Mary.Are you sure?Im nervous as hell but I am absolutely sure this is the right thing to do.I just hope I can deliver.Barbara burst out with laughter.Honey bun, all you have to do is lay there and enjoy the ride.God, you are just as melodramatic as that one.She pointed her thumb at the door and laughed some more.I know I am not a school girl anymore.I get anxious when it is something I really want and I always mess it up.I am trying so hard to be perfect this time but I know me and I will do something wrong, I just know it.Mary, relax.You go to him and take off your clothes and lay back and let him do the work.Your job is to relax and go with the flow.Just feel good and relax, the rest will take care of itself.I know Im just being stupid.People are having sex at this very moment all over the planet and Im sitting here acting like its a planet creating experience.Its just good old fashioned sex.But only if you are doing it right, girl.Barbara shook her hips, forcing Mary to laugh.Take your time and dont rush it.He will be nervous, too.All right?Mary took Barbaras hand again.Thanks for being here for me.No problem.Try to get along better with Jill, too.No promises there, but I will try.Tell you what, Mary, I will let her insults roll off my back like a duck in water.But I swear to god, if that little Munchkin balls up her fist like she wants to hit me, I might just knock her back to the stone ages.They both laughed and eased Marys anxiety.Jill came back in while they were laughing and was disturbed by it but didnt say a word.Mare, I have you booked so lets get going.Jill had changed out of her housekeepers uniform and was dressed in jeans with a white tank top.Sorry you cant get away, Barb, duty calls.Jill smiled at Barbara and was doing a little jig inside.Well, I better get back to work, said Barbara to Mary.Have fun and relax and breathe.The pain is a bitch but you will be rewarded later.She smiled and got up to leave and walked to the door.She flashed a look to Jill before leaving but said not a word to her.Jill said nothing.Their truce was in effect but she would walk up to the line and spit across it when she felt like it.She turned back to Mary.Are you ready to go?Yeah, but let me file these papers then we can head out.Mary picked up some papers off her desk and walked over to the filing cabinet.That is that, lets go.Mary and Jill walked down Collins Avenue before turning to the right and walking another two blocks to the salon.Welcome to Saras Cut and Trim, do you ladies have an appointment?Yes, said Jill.My friend is here for the first time and she needs a wax and trim.She has delicate skin and needs someone with an experienced touch.No trainees for my girl.Dont worry, we only employ the best workers here.And you are?Mary.Well, hello, Mary.I am Ashley and I will be taking care of you myself.You have never had a wax before?No, I trim when necessary.Mary looked around the room, rubbing her hands together.Well, come in the back with me and we will get you comfortable.Ashley led them into a small room with a table and chair.The room had a large overhead light display similar to that of an operating room.Your friend can stay and have a seat in the chair if you like.We want you to do whatever makes you more comfortable.If you are not relaxed it will take twice as long and be twice as painful.Do you want her to stay?Um, yes, have a seat, Jill.You might as well witness my screaming firsthand.Jill took her seat next to the head of the table.Its not that bad, Mare.She leaned in to whisper.Shes just teasing.Go into that room and change into the gown that is there.You can keep on your bra but no panties.Come back when youre ready.Ashley pointed to the room.Mary returned in a green hospital gown.She hoisted herself on to the table, laid her head on the pillow, turned her head to the left, and smiled nervously at Jill.Jill stroked Marys cheek.Relax, she was teasing.I hope so.Ashley came back in holding a bowl of hot wax.Would you care for a drink before we get started?Mary shook her head.Lets just do it.Have a shot of whiskey, Mare.All right, give me a quick shot.Ashley poured Mary a drink.Mary drank down her drink and sighed.She lay back down on the table to brace herself.Put your feet in these stirrups, Mary.Mary put her feet into the contraption and Ashley spread them apart.She lifted Marys gown from her knees to her waist.Ashley then raised the stirrups higher and spread them further apart.Though her face flushed with embarrassment Mary did her best to relax.Relax, Mary, I will give the liquor a chance to do its job before I start.The wax will be warm to the touch but will not burn you.The first task I have to do is to grab a pair of scissors and trim you down some more.You have excellent skin and hair to work with, I like it.Thank you.Mary felt better for some reason.Ashley put on gloves and trimmed with the scissors before applying the wax.Is there a particular style that you would like to have?Excuse me?What style would you like?Bermuda triangle, landing strip, newborn baby?Mary turned a bewildered head to Jill.Mare, how do you want to look after the wax?Are you comfortable with all the hair removed or do you want to keep a little?Oh, god, um let me think.She turned back to Ashley and said, the last one, I guess.Great, relax and I will get you started.Ashley began applying the wax with precision.She watched Marys facial expression to see how well she was handling the experience.Mary grimaced and cried out a couple times but made it through the procedure well.We are done.Ashley let the stirrups down and pulled Marys gown down.Go into the bathroom and have a look.Mary climbed to her feet and marched to the bathroom.Its okay, I guess.She yelled through the door.Good, get dressed, you are all done, said Ashley.She began putting away the items she had been using when Mary came back out fully dressed.I feel a little weird.Oh, Mare, you will get used to it.Jill got up and they left the salon after paying.They slowly walked back and saw a waiter setting up tables outside a little coffee shop.Lets have a quick bite and talk.All right.Jill went to the counter and ordered for them.They were led outside and sat at a table for two.How do you really feel, Mare?Kind of weird and I am starting to itch a little.Do you think Im making a mistake?I think Barb is a slut who thinks with her clit.Jill blurted, then added, It doesnt matter what I think, do you think you are making a mistake?Mary thought for a while and was happy when the waiter brought them their order.She took a bite of her empanada and sipped her drink before replying.I like Robert maybe too much.When I like someone I mess it up and this time I want to do it differently.You remember John Slocum from Bennys?Yeah, I remember him.I had this stupid three month rule before sleeping with a man.I read in a magazine that if you made your man wait that he would be truer to you and the relationship would stand the test of time.I was so stupid that I bought into that garbage and kept putting him off for two and half months.I went to the Aventura alone and there he was in the theater in the back row getting a blow job from an alley hooker.He tells me that it is entirely my fault for making him wait three months.He said he wanted to respect me and my wishes but he had bottled up energy that had to be released somehow.Mary stopped talking and took another bite of her empanada and then took another sip of her drink.Well, anyway, Robert and Jerry were in a strip club while he was in New York on business and I think he is doing the same thing.Mare, that is no reason to sleep with him.If he loves you he will wait, you ought to know that by now.Dont do something you will regret later.Hell, look at Bert and me.I gave that fucker my goodies the first night and he has been ignoring me ever since.Make his ass wait awhile.Has he been putting pressure on you?No, he hasnt said a word about sex.He is probably wondering how to get away from a neurotic psycho like me.Stop it, Mare, you are as normal as I am.And I am the best thing that ever happened to Bert Asshole Harper.Mary chuckled at Jills lunacy.How are you and Bert doing these days?Well, Im at the house with him so thats saying something.Did you tell him about Jerry?Good god, no!Do I look like Im retarded to you?Jill started laughing.Dont you think you should tell him?Why did you do it in the first place?You are the one who told me marriage is forever.Jill took a bite of her empanada, it is.She sipped her drink and checked her wristwatch.I love being almost married, but its hard, Mare.I dont think Bert would cheat on me but I feel like Im being ignored constantly.I feel as if I dont matter and sometimes I cant reach him no matter how hard I try.One time we were arguing and he stopped and tried to leave out of the bedroom so I blocked the door.I made him force me out of the way and even then he didnt hit me or raise his voice.Sometimes I just do crazy things just to get a rise out of him.I feel like even if all we do is fight, at least he is recognizing me and that is better than nothing.She took another bite of her empanada and sighed.Are you really sure you want to be in a committed relationship, Mare?Its not all that exciting from where Im sitting.Sometimes Im envious of Barb and her sleep with whatever is moving attitude.Mary laughed.Stop it, you and Barb are birds of a feather and I see it even if you dont.And yes, I want a man to come home to at night.My fantasy is not to have someone to hold in bed, but someone to spoon with as I drift off to sleep or just to watch a movie with.You girls are nice but a man, a real man, is what Im shooting for.Mary finished her meal and reached for her purse that she had laid on the back of her chair.Dont bother, I already paid.Im still docking you for missing work.Mary smiled and gave her some money.You know Mrs.Belmont has spies everywhere.Jill put the money in her purse.Have you made plans for tonight?Mary shook her head.Yes, Ill call Robert and ask him to meet me upstairs in one of the rooms.When he shows up Ill just let nature take its course.No, Mare, that is not romantic at all.I saw something in the boutique that would look good on you and as long as you dont rip it, you can return it tomorrow.Let me get a room ready and I will text you and then you can invite him up.Take him to a movie and if things are going good then take him back to the hotel and do the deed.No muss no fuss.What do you think?All right, Ill try it your way.Come on, lets get back to work.They rose and left the coffee shop to finish out the workday.Mary waited until late in the day to call Robert and arrange their date.She picked up her office phone and dialed his home phone.The phone rang three times and then Mary put it back down, relieved that he wasnt at home.She cursed herself for chickening out and dialed again.The phone rang several times before it was picked up.Hello.She heard a man with a deep voice speaking and was so startled that she didnt recognize the voice.Robert?Its Mary.Yes, Mary, Im here.Hello, Bob, how are you?Im fine, Mary, how about you?I cant complain.Bob, I wanted to know if you were free this evening?Im not doing anything special.What do you have in mind?I was thinking about a movie.You know something that we could see and we didnt have to do a lot of talking so I wouldnt be tempted to put my big foot in my even bigger mouth.Robert chuckled.That would be great, Mary.Let me have the details.Great, let me phone over and I can see what is playing around 7 pm tonight at the Aventura?Sounds great, shall I meet you there?No, Ill still be here at work.Drop by around 6:30 and pick me up.Sounds great, I will see you then.Robert put down the phone and prepared for the evening.20: Mission Accomplished      Mary stood at the door looking out at the road and the people who passed by.She absently rubbed her hands together, starting to perspire.Her whole life has led up to this moment and whether or not she would screw it up would determine her fate.A nasty suspicion reared its ugly head in the back of her mind.Something was wrong, she felt it.She debated whether she should check the hospitals or phone his house to see if he had forgotten.She paced another minute, then moved away from the window, thinking she was just being crazy and if she only had a drink it would calm her nerves.She couldnt go back to her office and have a drink because that damn Jill had gone in and removed her stash of minis.Mary wondered what to do.She sighed then stood against a wall to compose her thoughts and be rational.She looked at the big clock on the wall above the front desk counter and saw that it was 6:20pm.She was early and there was no reason to worry.Mary began to regulate her breathing and assumed that she was just an idiot.Robert was not late or in an accident or at home and simply forgot about her.She moved away from the wall and walked back toward the double doors that led outside.She opened the door and walked around in the inner courtyard.Everything was fine and there was no need to worry.Earlier that day, Barbara had given her a brand new matching set of underwear that she had bought from Victorias Secret.Mary told her to leave the set of underwear in the hotel room and she would wear it if the movie went well.Mary wore a green Lurex sweater dress with ruffle hem and a deep V neck in the back, Jills gift from the boutique.The dress was a little too much for the movies but Jill thought it would make a good impression.It hugged Marys ass.Mary liked the fact that the V neck was in the back because her large breasts were still a problem area for her.She would always choose something to wear that would cover them up and mask their size, this dress did the trick.It had a high collar in front and was not tight at all.Mary looked at herself in the mirror before leaving the Culver Room and swore that her breasts had shrunken.She truly liked the way she looked though it was not her favorite color.Mary walked around the dimming courtyard trying to lose herself in the scenery.She had managed to calm down when she heard her name.Mary turned to see Robert standing there.She smiled, disappointedshe wanted to make a grand entrance.Mary braced herself, she would make this her entrance.She put her hands to her side and walked as slowly and seductively toward him as she could.She kept eye contact with him and watched as his eyes traveled the length of her body.His eyes drifted from her head to her feet and back up again.Mary felt a warm sensation as he took in her beauty.She tingled with delight as she approached him.Hello, Bob, said Mary as she reached his side.Wow, all I can say is ...wow!You look fantastic!Robert stood staring at her for a minute and Mary took delight in his stares.You men dont understand the work and pain it takes to be presentable.Paying homage is the price.You better recognize.Mary was horrified that those words slipped out.She wanted to just say a simple thank you.What Happened?She hoped he didnt think she was full of herself.When I stop recognizing beauty then kill me on the spot.Mary laughed with him.He offered his arm and they left.Barbara and Jill were at the hotel peeking around a corner.They were just as nervous as Mary.She was their child going off on her very first date.Proud parents watched Mary get into a taxi with Robert.They turned and high fived each other.After getting tickets, Robert saw a concession stand.Would you like some popcorn or a soda?Um, yes, please, some popcorn with extra butter and some Goobers.Theyre my favorite.What would you like to wash it down with?Um, how about a coke, make it a diet coke.Coming right up, would you like to have a seat over there or do you want to go ahead in to the movie and be seated?Mary glanced at chatting couples in the seated area.Ill take a seat and go in with you, that way I will be easy for you to find.Mary grinned and turned to leave.Mary sat and watched Robert, admiring how handsome and tall he was.She had always preferred that her date be taller.She figured Robert was roughly four inches taller.He looked handsome in his brown blazer.She wondered if he would tan if he stayed too long in the sun.She cursed herself for the stray thought.She sat her mind to one thoughthe was her Prince Charming and tonight he would get his prize.Robert strutted to Mary carrying a big tray.I think I bought out the store.He chuckled.My god, I think you did, too.She chuckled.They walked into the movie theater together and found seats in the back row.Mary didnt pay attention to the movie, she was too busy planning the after party in her head.As she watched the movie she would go over every detail of what would happen at the hotel.She wanted the evening to go perfect and kept replaying the nights events.She got up and whispered to him, I have to go to the bathroom, I will be right back.Robert grew up in a family of eight children, he would often sit quietly and listen to the conversations around him and comment when necessary.He was silent yet strong and knew that he could provide a woman with a lifetime companion that would support her.He would go to the ends of the earth and back again for his woman.The job now was to find such a woman and it was his wish that Mary be that woman.He never told her but she reminded him of his mother who was the strength of their family.She had her own demons to deal with but she was the glue that held the family together.Robert made a solemn vow that he would find a woman like his mother to begin his family.He had already planned on at least two children but was not concerned about what their names would be.Only that they would be strong and healthy.Robert sat and tried to watch the movie but he kept thinking of ways to start a conversation with Mary and had no idea what the movie was about.He desperately hoped that when Mary returned she would not ask him about the movie.He tried in her absence to try to figure the movie out just in case she would want to question him about it.All he could think about was how awkward he felt.Mary returned after a short absence.Im back, did I miss anything important?No, Mary, you didnt miss anything.These movies are generally predictable.Do you like it so far?Um, yes I do.Im a sucker for a happy ending.Mary ate some popcorn, not because she was hungry but because she had said something she wished she hadnt had said.Mary determined to eat and drink in silence and to keep her mouth filled at all times.She blushed at the thought then shoveled more popcorn into her mouth.Robert was hesitant to speak because he was afraid he would say the wrong thing and set Mary off so he too remained silent.They watched the rest of the movie in silence and smiled at each other when it was over.Robert helped Mary to her feet.I liked it, did you?Yes, I did.Are you glad you came tonight?Yes, Mary, I like spending time with you.Shall we go back to the hotel?Yes, we shall.Mary paid no attention in the cab ride back and couldnt recall if Robert asked her anything.His comment consumed her: he liked spending time with her.Why didnt he say he loved spending time with her?Was it a slip of the tongue or had things changed?She clearly remembered him saying he loved spending time with her earlier.Had something she said changed his opinion of her?Mary wrestled with these questions as they approached the hotel.After the cab stopped, Mary looked at Robert.Please come inside and have a drink with me.Robert walked Mary to the door of the Belmont Hotel and they went inside.Mary was sure of Robert and was sure tonight she would give herself to him.They went through the lobby area and down a hall to a small restaurant lounge in the hotel.They took a seat at a small table and Mary called the server for an order.Anything special you want?No, Mary, I am in your hands tonight, you decide.Mary waited for the server.Do you have any champagne?Yes, Madame, would you care for a bottle?No, just two glasses, please.Right away, Madame.The server left them to get their order.Do you know him?Robert asked Mary.Yes, he worked for me for a while as a maintenance worker.I believe it was two years ago.Why do you ask?Nothing really.This is a small area and I imagine everyone knows everyone.I was just curious.Oh, said Mary, unsure of what to say next.The server returned with their champagne and they made a toast and drank it down.Robert said, I am sure you have had a long day, perhaps I should say goodnight?Ill walk you out, is all that Mary could think to say.She and Robert walked toward the front of the hotel.Mary knew she couldnt let Robert leave, he must want this night as much as she does.She stopped dead in her tracks and turned to him.Bob, come with me.She turned around and led him to the elevator and pressed the button.She waited in silence as the elevator arrived and stepped on board when the doors opened.Mary pushed the fourth floor button and the doors closed again.She reached into her purse for her cell phone.Mary checked her messages and found one from Jill that contained only numbers: 442.Mary closed the phone and put it away.The doors opened again and Mary led Robert out.She searched for the room.Mary found it and saw an envelope attached to the doorknob.She opened the envelope and pulled out a keycard and opened the door.A vanilla scent wafted to her.Mary and Robert entered a room with a large king size bed surrounded by flaming candles on all sides.Mary saw rose petals on the bed and imagined that it was a special touch from Jill.They walked in and Robert shut the door behind him.Bob, I want you to stay with me tonight.Are you surprised?Robert beamed.Yes, Mary, you caught me by surprise.But, I love surprises like this.He smirked.Make yourself comfortable, Ill go and slip into something more comfortable myself.I hope you will approve?Mary smiled and walked toward the door to the bathroom.She turned the knob and went inside.Lying across the top of the dresser was a blue Nightie with matching panties and bra.She also saw a small box of condoms with a bow on top the kind you stick on Christmas presents.She picked up the condoms and giggled quietly, this must be the work of Barbara.She put them down and changed.Mary took a deep breath and emerged out of the bathroom, nervous but determined.Robert was already in the bed and drinking a glass of champagne left for them.Satisfaction etched into his broad face as he beheld a vision.Mary modeled her simple Ribbon trim light blue Nightie that was made see thru by candle light.She felt a tug of embarrassment.Barbaras taste was a little too radical for Mary but she knew her friend meant well.A small smile pierced her stoic demeanor and she turned.She sat on the edge of the bed and leaned down and kissed Robert as softly as she could.She then moved closer in bed to him and kissed him deeply.She rose and looked him in the eye.Im nervous as hell so forgive me if I seem a little weird.He looked amused and kissed her as his answer.Mary slid under the covers, shaking as if she were cold.She removed her Nightie, feeling naked and vulnerable.Still, determination fueled her.With a long held sigh, she pushed the sheet aside.She kissed him again and pressed her body close to him and felt his heat.She pressed her body even closer before moving to the side.Robert lay on top of Mary and continued to do nothing but ply her with kisses.When Mary was ready, she took off her bra and then her panties.She felt comfortable in the candle light, she was sure if the lights had been on she would have been too afraid to reveal her flaws.Robert lay on top of her, ready and eager.Mary reached down, feeling his thickness, guiding him inside her pleasure center.Strong pulsations moved the length of her body, she gasped, throwing her head back in grimace and pleasure.Mary quivered with excitement and as Robert began slowly stroking up and down Mary felt her body automatically moving without sensing it, her body falling in rhythm with his.She closed her eyes and placed her hands on his muscular backside and rode out wave after wave of pure ecstasy, driving him deeper and deeper into her.Mary held on for dear life as Robert took her on the thrill ride of a lifetime.This stallion was everything that Mary had thought he would be.She felt herself on the verge of orgasm, but was not ready for it to end.She tried to hold back, to delay, but it could not be stopped.She had gone too far.Mary moaned softly and held tightly to him as he brought her to climax.The world disappeared as she floated only to return to sanity and then float off again.When Robert finally reached orgasm Mary had lost count of the number of times she moaned with satisfaction.Robert collapsed on top of Mary.Mary stroked the back of his head and felt how hot and wet he had become from their encounter.His sweat dripped on to Mary and she took delight in the fact that she knew he was happy.He lay on top of her for another minute and then rolled to the side to lay next to her.They kissed some more then lay next to each other.Her only words, Hold me, tightly.Mary closed her eyes.She trembled.The night had gone perfect, a dream fulfilled.Suddenly, her heart sped up.Fear shot through her.Again she trembled.She calmed before he noticed.Mary made the mistake of thinking two steps ahead, like she always did.She berated herself for the thought.It may all fall apart tomorrow, and knowing her, she would find a way to wreck it.But tonight, she has her dream.She shut her eyes tighter to keep the dream alive for a little bit longer.With one more thing on her mind, she took a last look into his chocolate eyes then turned so they could spoon.She felt him push in from behind as he wrapped his huge arms around her.A smile of triumph graced her face.I have everything tonight.Why does there have to be a tomorrow?
