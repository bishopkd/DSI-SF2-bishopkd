My stomach growled and I realized I hadnt eaten anything since lunch yesterday.Sarah?Yeah?You think I fucked up my first one night stand?Far be it from me to judge.Seriously.Ive had more than my fair share of one time romps.Butshe stood and walked to my doorI have never gotten anyones name mixed up.She laughed as the door closed and I threw another pillow, which bounced off the wall.Pouting, I slumped back onto my bed.Part of me was thrilled to have finally popped my cherry, so to speak, on the one night stand thing.But another was disappointed that it hadnt been with Brian.Regardless of my feelings on the subject, I was a girl whod just been banged to within an inch of her life and had the ice pack on her crotch to prove it.SixAn hour later, Sarah and I met up with Mel in the lobby of the gym.I, of course, felt like Id just spent a week riding stallions when, in fact, it had been only one night.Neither the ice pack nor the cluster of pain pills I took alleviated the strange throbbing sensation between my legs.Every step felt like a cross between round five of a boxing match with my labia, a pool of fire, and the prelude to an insane orgasm.Either way, the sensation was a bit disturbing.Good morning, sunshine!Melody sang a bit too loud for my taste.It may be half past one in the afternoon but I was still in no shape to be in public.Take off your sunglasses.You look ridiculous.Its overcast outside and youre indoors.Sarah yanked my sunglasses off my face and I winced.What the fuck, Sarah!You are not the only person to ever drink too much.Own it.For one night, you were a drunken slut.No one can take that away from you!Let your freak flag fly, bitch!Melody waved her arm above her head and swung her hips in a way that made me dizzy.Leave me alone, I growled, snatching my sunglasses back from Sarah and shoving them as close to my face as I could.My vagina hurts.Ha!What?Melody shrieked a little too loudly.Pounded in the pussy, were we?Not just the pussy, Sarah mumbled.Yeah, shut it!I took a long swig of my water.The bottle was already half empty and I wasnt sure how Id make it through an hour of Warden Suzy, our spin instructor.Shut up!Thats hysterical!Melody was finding my pain entirely too funny.I am right here!You dont need to mock me.For your information, it was amazing.He wasHung like a horse.Sarah!I punched her in the arm.Oh, sorry.Radiated cucumber big.She held her hands a foot apart to demonstrate the metaphor.Ladies!Get your asses in here!This is spin class, not gossip hour!We all rolled our eyes.Sounded like Warden Suzy was in a mood.Get the fuck out of here!Melody whispered.I need all the deets.Youll spill at lunch!As long as I dont lose my appetite.Sarah laughed as we entered the room.Get on your bikes, ladies!We need to work the weekend off your asses!I can see some of you went a little overboard.I swear to God, the warden was looking at me when she said that.We will remove the aforementioned excess today.Now mount up.In unison, twenty two people in the room mounted their stationary bikes while I, the twenty third, stood and stared at it.Whats wrong with you?Sarah whispered, her gaze half focused on me, the other half on Warden Suzy.I dont think I can do this.Youve done this almost every Sunday for the past two years.Youre good.Get on before she notices and calls you out.Whenever Warden Suzy called someone out, they were forced to spin next to her, facing the class.Thankfully, it had never happened to me, but Id seen enough mortified faces to know I never wanted it to.But my crotch hurts.Man up.Fine, I whined as I settled the too tiny bike seat between my legs.I honestly felt like I was sitting on jagged rocks.I could barely even bring myself to wear underwear and the bike shorts I was wearing did absolutely nothing to alleviate the pain.I shifted left before leaning right.Sliding forward then nudging back, there really was no comfortable way to sit on a bike seat.Of course, after the night Id had, the odds at finding any comfort on any seat were stacked against me.Whether you are a man or a woman, spin class will bruise you in places you had no idea could be bruised.It is crotch torture.But once you see the transformation your body makes after a few classes, youll put up with the pain.And, to be fair, the pain really does lessen the more you ride.However, after last nights festivities, I felt like a newbie again.Biting my lip, I focused on the music and Warden Suzys shouts about slaying the cellulite monster and shrinking our fat asses to drown out the pain.A bead of sweat formed at the base of my neck and slipped haphazardly down my back, absorbing into the fabric of my sports bra.With each pump of my legs, my grunting became more and more pronounced.Sarah and Melody, on either side of me, started to giggle.I scowled and continued on.My sports bra was completely soaked with sweat no longer confined to rogue beads of perspiration and each new drip slid down to my ass crack.I shifted to find some semblance of comfort.Holy fucking hell!I yelled out, much to the astonishment of nearly everyone in the class.Warden Suzy thought, of course, that I was in beast mode.Thats right, Caroline!Ride through the pain!Ride, bitch, ride!Sarah slumped in her seat, her head on the handlebars, her body vibrating from laughter.Melody joined in the wardens chorus.Thats right, bitch!Ride it like you own it!Of course that did absolutely nothing to take the focus off me.Warden Suzy thought I was working the bike whereas Sarah, Melody, and I knew I was about to die from the aftermath of riding a giant cock all night.See ladies!Do it like Caroline!Pump!Pump!Warden Suzy was so into my grunts, she failed to see that I was in actual pain.Feel it, ladies!Feel it inside you and ride that bitch until you own it!It was too much for Melody; she actually fell off her bike.Thankfully, she was on the end and didnt hit another spinner.I dont think it would have mattered muchshe was on the floor in the fetal position laughing above the din of the music.Sarah had just stopped spinning completely, lost in the words of our revered and feared instructor.Fuck you, I muttered under my breath.Ride, Caroline!Pump!She snorted.All right, ladies!Melody get up!Time to take it harder!Honestly, when did spin class become so perverted?Then again, like Melody always said, having a dirty mind makes ordinary conversations more interesting.But this wasnt interesting.It was torture.Were going to do up downs.On the count of three.Oh, shit.One!Oh, shit.Two!Oh, shit.Three!Uuuup!Warden Suzy screamed until her voice broke.I forced my legs to hold me up and bit my lip.Down!I dropped to my seat.Oh my God.Id never felt such pain.Up!I pushed myself up.My panties were actually crawling up inside me.Down!That was it.I joined Melody on the floor, holding my crotch like it was going to fall off if I let go.Motherfucker!A few classmates whipped their heads around to stare.I need to get the fuck out of here, I whispered to Melody.Between fits of laughter she managed to agree.Me.Too.I swear I am going to pee myself.On my hands and knees I crawled to my bike, grabbed my towel and water bottle, and hightailed my ass out of the room with Melody and Sarah hot on my heels.Stumbling through the door I collided with something solid, causing Sarah and Melody to crash into me.What theHey there.My knees gave out and the person standing in front of me caught me before I could embarrass myself anymore.You okay?He looked concerned.Brian?What are you doing here?Suddenly I was acutely aware of the fact I hadnt showered and mustve smelled like a cross between sweat and sex.The hair thatd managed to slip out of my ponytail was plastered to my face and I was holding my crotch.He nodded toward the doors behind me.Warden Suzy too much for you today?His eyes flicked down to my hands.I was still reeling from the fact that Brian, the reason my one night stand wasnt perfect, was standing in front of me, his sweaty T shirt clinging to biceps that hadnt been visible through his shirt last night.Ah, well, yeah.You know.I couldnt make a coherent sentence if someone dangled a pair of Louboutins in my face.Hi!We met last night.Im Sarah; this is Melody.I remember, he answered, without taking his eyes off me.You sure youre okay?He reached out and touched my shoulder.Yeah.Im good.I crossed my arms over my chest in an attempt to appear casual.So I hear.That playful smirk danced across his mouth like it had the night before.Brian!Yo!You ready, bro?Every hair on my body stood on end.I knew that voice.Stiff as a board, I turned in the direction of the person I knew to be there.Ryan.They know each other?Caroline.Ryan.Damn, Sarah and Melody whispered in unison behind me, and I elbowed them in an attempt to shut them up.The words get out of here ran in a loop through my head over and over.What are you doing here?I mean, this is your gym, too?Ryan looked as uncomfortable as I felt.Yeah, I, uh, spin class.I gestured to the doors behind me.Sneaking a sideways glance at Brian, I saw that he had yet to take his eyes off me.He was covering his mouth with his hand.He thought this was funny?Yeah, well, uh.Nice to see you.We have to go.Plans.You know.Hi!I dont think we met.Im Melody.Shoving me out of the way, she stuck her hand out and Ryan took it while staring at me quizzically.Nice to meet you.Im Sarah.Carolines roommate.Sarah pushed herself in front of me.Ryans face turned an awfully funny shade of red.The tips of his ears looked like he spent too much time in the sun.Yeah, um.Sorry about the lamp.Brians eyebrows skyrocketed off his face as he stifled a laugh.No problem.People bang into things all the time.We can always buy new lamps.I nearly choked at the way Sarah said bang.I tried to silently convey how uncomfortable I was but she continued.So, you dont sound like youre from around here.Whered you blow in from?She couldnt hide her smile no matter how hard she tried.Like me, Ryan choked at her choice of words.Im from Texas.Im just staying with a friend until I can find my own place.How did I miss the accent?Never one to pass up a chance at homing in on a new recruit, Melody stretched her neck.Is your friend here?Brian coughed and held up his hand with a two finger salute.You?Youre his friend?Hes staying with you?I pointed back and forth between the two men as if doing so would somehow make the knowledge less embarrassing.Yeah.We went to college together.I needed the floor to open and swallow me whole.Well, isnt that great!I faked a smile so plastic even Barbie would be proud.We really, really have to go.Nice to meet you, er, uh, see you againRyan.Brian pointed to his friend with a look of mock seriousness on his face.Yeah, I know that.Bye, Ryan.Bye, Brian.Ryan waved halfheartedly.I think he was still trying to figure out what the hell just happened.Hey, Caroline!Brian called out.Yeah?I turned.Looks like you dont need those heels to be noticed from behind.My mouth gaped open until Sarah reached over and closed it for me.My girls on either side of me, I was ushered into the locker room to shower and get ready for lunch.SevenNone of us spoke until we were showered, dressed, and out the door.The girls, however, did laugh at me when I stealthily tiptoed my way from the locker room to the front door.I was on the lookout for Brian or Ryan.Just my dumb luck that the two of them knew each other.No, wait.Not just knew each other.Lived together.I mustve been something to look at because Melody started humming the Pink Panther theme song.Once we hit the street, I whirled around.You two couldnt help me out in there?YouI pointed at Sarahwith your bang and blow remarks!Do you have any idea how mortified I was?I absolutely know how mortified you were.Thats why it was so funny.Melody fell into a fit of giggles.Ride, Caroline!Ride!You arent helping.Aw, come on.We figured youd never run into them again.We were wrong.Chalk it up to an awkward encounter.Look, I love you like a back alley hooker loves crack but if you cant see the funny, you arent the Caroline I know.I sighed and plopped down on a bench, wincing in the process.The throbbing subsided but it still hurt to sit.Youre right.This shit really would only happen to you, Care, Melody said.I know, right?Like I have some idiot badge on my head.You dont have an idiot badge.I promise I would have taken a butt load of pictures of it and posted it all over social media if that were the case.Leave it to my girls to diffuse me.I really was lucky to have them in my corner.Lets eat.About time.Im starving.We walked the block to the caf.Ordering was easy.We chose the three greasiest plates on the menu.Nothing like clogging the arteries after a night of drinking and sex followed by a quick spin in the gym.So, that was weird, right?Melody pulled back the curtain to reveal the elephant in the room.What was weird?I tried to act like I had no idea what she was talking about while I shoved a huge bite of medium rare cheeseburger in my mouth.I couldnt talk if my mouth was full, right?You know what.Sarah glanced at me sideways as she picked apart her BLT.Ryan.Brian.Texas and the bartender?Friends.Roommates.Melody wasnt going to let it go.Its fine, right?I mean, so what?I brought Ryan back to my place last night, was fucked sidewaysAnd upside down, Sarah added.And upside down, thank you.And I screamed Brians name.Sarah got up to pat Melody on the back as she choked on a French fry.You what?she finally asked after shed taken a long sip of her diet soda.You didnt tell her?I glared at Sarah.Not my story to tell.She wiggled her eyebrows at me and I dropped my head to the table.Yes.Yes, I may have, inadvertently, kind of mentioned Brians name while I was having sex with Ryan.Well, Jesus Christ, doll.No wonder it was so awkward back at the gym.It was like a reverse rodeo.I dont know what that is.Like a reverse cowgirl?Yes.No.Look, its like the joke says, call a girl by the wrong name and hold on tight while she gets mad.She laughed and Sarah and I stared at her.No?You never heard that one.Must just be me.Look, its no big deal.Ill probably never see them againUm, I dont know about you but I like the gym and I like Murphys and unless you plan on never hanging out with us againLook, Brian flirted because its his job.Hes a bartender.Hes a flirt.And Ryan, well, maybe hell find a place far away and Ill never see him again.It was just one night.One one night stand.I finally got it out of my system.Melody reached across the table and pilfered a fry from my plate.You see, Care, thats where youre wrong.A one night stand is like this French fry here.She popped it in her mouth and grabbed another.You cant have just one.She giggled, slopped it in a pile of ketchup, and bit it in half.No.No, no, no.I shook my head.There will be no more one night stands.No more picking up random guys at a bar.No more breaking of lamps.No more Lots OLube?Lots OLube?Melodys eyes were wide.Shut up.No.As a matter of fact, maybe Ill just stop having sex altogether until I get my shit straight.Both girls leaned back in their seats and considered me.Really.Thank you ladies for pulling me out of my pity party.I am sure the ice cream makers of the world were despondent over the whole thing.I just really think I need to focus on me.I start a new job when we get back from Jamaica and I dont need to be distracted.But thats exactly why you need to be distracted.What happened the last time you focused on one area of your life?Steven took it over, thats what.And not for nothing, Im pretty sure that guy had more dick in his personality than in his pants.Sarah gave me the look.The one that said Go ahead, try to argue my point.I couldnt.She wasnt wrong about that.I pursed my lips.I agree with youleave the relationships alone for a while, but youre wrong if you think you cant have your cake and eat it, too.Have a little side of fun with your work.Im not saying go out and screw every guy in a ten mile radiusRight.Five miles should do it, Melody piped in.Exactly.Sarah continued, I dont want to see you in the state of mind you were in two months agohell, even two weeks ago.Look, you did nothing wrong.Youre twenty eight years old, youre pretty, and you have a great ass.Thank you.Suddenly I saw the burger I was eating nestling into my ass.My appetite waned.Youre welcome.So you slept with a stranger.Who hasnt?Best part?The target has an accent.Southern is so sexy.I think Texas is more southwest, I said, lost in thought.Do you think he has a cowboy hat?Melody piped in.Do all people from Texas own cowboy hats?Isnt that a bit of a stereotype?I mean, not all of us from Jersey perm our hair to within an inch of its life and shellac it with Aqua Net, I replied.I dont know.Thats an eighties thing, girl.Doesnt matter, though, Jersey girls just do it better.I wonder what he looks like shirtless with torn up jeans and a Stetson.Isnt Stetson a cologne?Its a hat, too.Melody winked.Whatever.Like I said, one night stand, who hasnt?Sarah reasoned.I certainly have.More than once.Its fun to get validation once in a while.I mean, maybe I have a few extra pounds on my hips.Im not the skinniest bitch on the block, but I give great head and that cancels out the few extra pounds on my ass.Then again, I am a size awesome.Melody took another bite of her grilled cheese.I am all for girl power, woman power, whatever.But any girl who tells you she doesnt like to feel pretty every now and then or need occasional validation from a member of the opposite sex is a liar, doesnt know how to give a good blow job, and probably hasnt ever had an orgasm.Nothing worse than an orgasmless liar.What are you saying?I couldnt follow Melodys train of thought.It wasnt the first time.Im saying we need orgasms and to say you dont is a lie.I can see how you were saying that.Sarah nodded.I guess so.I contemplated what they had said while keeping myself busy with my soda straw.You both have valid points.Just do me a favor and dont let me become a slut.Aw, sweetie.Who are we to judge?True.I sat lost in thought for a bit when my phone rang.I reached into my gym bag and dug it out.I didnt recognize the number.Who is it?Sarah asked.No idea.Local, though.Answer it.Right.Hello?Caroline?Yes?This is, uh, Ryan.Theres the accent.I am quite sure my eyes bugged out of my head.Who is it?Sarah whispered.Placing my hand over the phone I replied, Ryan.Melody made a crude gesture as she bobbed her head up and down, her fist in front of her mouth.I rolled my eyes.Caroline, you there?Oh, sorry.Yeah.How are you?I stared at my friends, who were trying to keep from laughing.Good.So, today was weird.Running into you at the gym, I mean.Yeah.Weird.So whats up?Dont be rude, Melody whispered.I mean, what are you doing?I made a face at her.Nothing.Look, I was wondering, if youre free, I mean, if you wanted to have dinner on Friday.Well be in Jamaica Friday.I have to say, I was disappointed.Well, then the following Friday?The following Friday?I looked at Sarah and Melody again.I wasnt sure what to do.Say yes!Melody squeaked a little too loudly.Did I interrupt you?Ryan sounded concerned.No, just a, uhI stood and walked away from the tabledog.Melody stuck her tongue out at me while Sarah gave me the finger and barked.Oh, so Friday after next?Yeah.Sure.Sounds great.I was fidgety, running my hands through my hair, effectively pulling most of it out of my ponytail holder.Excellent.So, Ill pick you up at eight?Yeah, sure.Sounds great.You know where I live.I was a queen wordsmith.All the great ones repeat themselves.Good thing I was starting my new assistant editor job in a week.That I do, Ryan replied with what I perceived to be a bit of innuendo.I didnt know what to do with that.So, okay.Ill see you next week.That you will.Have fun in Jamaica.Bye, Caroline.Bye.I hung up and walked back to the table only to find my two best friends whispering with their heads together.So I have a date with Ryan.I dont really know what to do with that.Melody clapped her hands.From what I hear, you know exactly what to do with that.I dropped my head to the table, slowly banging it a few times.Ryan.Sarah elongated his name.I popped my head up and looked at her.Thats what I said.Maybe it would be a good idea to practice saying his name.You know, in case you forget.Nice, Sarah.Im just saying.Everyone needs a smart ass sarcastic friend in their lives and Im so very happy to be of service to you in your time of need.Yeah, yeah.Youre always just saying.I pushed my plate away, silently repeating his name over and over in my head.Come on.Sarah stood and dropped money on the table.We have appointments.Manis and pedis.Girls, this time tomorrow well be baking on the soft, warm sands of Jamaica.EightWe arrived at the resort in Montego Bay just before noon and were on the beach, drinks in hand, an hour later.ThisMelody sipped her rum punchis what we needed.Fuck all that snow.Fuck all that dreary weather.We need sun.You arent kidding.Sarah rolled over onto her stomach after she handed me the suntan lotion.If I had to deal with one more administrator talking to me about leaving no child behind or whatever the fuck, I honestly think I was going to shoot myself.Common Core my asshole.I half listened to the two of them go on about the pleasures of a sun filled winter vacation.My head was stuck processing the events of the past weekend.Id finally taken the plunge.Id had sex with a stranger.Good sex.Excellent sex.Mind blowing, bucket list sex.Id lived through the awkward next day encounter.Ryan was the perfect target.Tall, built, hot as hell.And hed asked for a date the following week.I wasnt sure what to do with that.Wasnt a one night stand just that?One night?I was sure I was breaking some weird rule about the whole one night procedure.Who said, of course, that it had to be anything more?Maybe Id never have sex with him again.Maybe dinner means just dinner.Maybe dinner meant he felt as awkward as I did when we ran into each other at the gym yesterday.Maybe hell tell me he has crabs.Care?What?Even with sunglasses I needed to shield my eyes.Melodys metallic swimsuit reflected back at me with the strength of an eclipse.I was pretty sure Id go blind.You okay?What if he gave me crabs?I looked back at the ocean, picturing tiny little crabs marching toward me.Youre bald as a baby doll down there.So?Oh my God, Care.Its like teaching a newbie.Crabs are lice.Lice need hair.You have no hair.As in none.As in zilch.As inYou think too much.Melody finished Sarahs thought.Im just saying.I dont know him.I dont know where hes been!As in, Sarah continued, there is no hair down there for crabs to hang on to.I was reading online that the popularity of Brazilian waxing has led directly to the decline of pubic lice.So, its not crabs you should be worrying about.If it starts burning when you pee, orIf your vagina begins to shrivel up, then you should be worried.The two of them were unbelievable.I was having a real and seriously minor panic attack at the possibility of contracting a sexually transmitted disease and all they could do was joke.Its not funny.My vagina will not shrivel up.Just in case, I was going to have to check later.Well, not now, because you used it.For a while we were wondering if youd started collecting cobwebs down there.I was actually thinking of purchasing a feather duster for you.I figured you could get off while you cleaned.But, if youre really worried about shriveling or crabs, one of us could check for you.Sarah, did you bring a flashlight?Har, har.Cobwebs?Really, Melody?Real mature.I searched my bag for suntan lotion and remembered it was in my lap.Whatever.I dont think Im having sex with him again.You know what your problem is?Enlighten me, Sarah.You think too fucking much.Christ, the way you talk about it, youd think he popped your fucking cherry.This isnt forty year old virgin crap.Youve had sex before.True, but it was sovanilla.I rubbed lotion wherever I could reach.So youre used to vanilla.Melody shrugged her shoulders.Id be freaked out, too, if all I ever ate was vanilla then all of a sudden someone served up hot fudge, sprinkles, nuts, and cherries.Deal with it, doll.Ryan gave you the perfect sundae.He really did, didnt he?Lying back, I closed my eyes and thought about him.I thought about his hands, his big hands, which had held me pinned against the wall.I thought about his mouth, the mouth that touched every inch of my skin, his tongue that explored me inside and out.Thank God we had that extra room and thank God I brought my vibrator.It looked like I was going to have to make my own luck.This is good, right?What is good?Sarah asked.This.This whole me being on my own thing.Never really did this before.You are going to be great.Look, you have a wonderful set of parents, a brother who loves you.I think you were so dependent on the tight family unit you had that when you finally had the opportunity to spread your wings, you chose someone you thought would take care of you.Steven was that person.I dont think hes a bad guy, hes just not good for you.He is a bad guy, Melody added.MelNo, Im good.Youre right, this will be good.There you go!I looked at my empty glass.I dont know about you, but I need a refill.Be right back.I left my friends basking in the Caribbean sun as I made my way to the bar.I immediately regretted not slipping on my flip flops.I hopped through the sand like an idiot, then tripped over a backpack and face planted.My face full of sand, I rolled over on my back.Typical Caroline, I thought.With a belly full of rum punch, the world spun for a moment.Are you okay?Turning my head to the side, I looked for the source of the voice but the sun glare blocked my view.Did you hurt yourself?I dont think so.The owner of the voice helped me to a sitting position.I took off my sunglasses and was face to face with dimples.Green eyes and dimples.And floppy sun bleached hair.And bronze skin that rippled with athleticism.This wasnt a gym jock.This guy was lean.Let me help you up.The face of the voice came into view as it blocked the sun.He placed his hands under my arms and lifted me to my feet.He mustve thought I was insane.I couldnt stop staring at his dimples.I was enthralled by the fact that he didnt even have to smile to make them appear.I blamed the rum punch for what happened next.I lifted my hand and poked a finger in his face.Right into the left dimple.You okay?I quickly pulled my hand back and felt the rise of embarrassment heat me from my toes to the top of my head.Im sorry.I dont know what I was thinking.My stammering attempt at an apology left much to be desired.I had defiled his dimple.Id never prayed for quicksand but in that moment, it felt like a good idea.Thank you for helping me up.Ill be going now.Quickly turning away, I nearly tripped over the same backpack.Wait!Dimples called to me.Whats your name?Um, I really should be going.Sorry again!Somehow I was able to make my way to the cobblestone pathway without busting my ass again.I speed walked to the nearest bar and hopped up on a barstool.Thank God for all inclusive.What can I getcha?The bartender had the slightest hint of a Southern accent under his Jamaican accent that immediately led me to believe he wasnt a local.Two things.First, Pia Colada, heavy on the booze.Second, the real deal on where youre from.You can tell, huh?Mr.Not From Jamaica busied himself with pouring the drink ingredients into a blender.Theres a distinct twang underneath all that hey mon youre trying to pass off as real.I guess I need to do better.Im from Texas.I knew it!Dont spread that around.I have an image to protect.That image was over six feet tall and dark skinned.He ran his hands over his bald head and smiled as he handed me my drink, two slices of pineapple and a purple umbrella garnishing it.I wanted to take my straw and drink him up.Names Wes but everyone around here calls me Marley.Marley?Isnt that a bit overkill?I mean, you dont even have dreads.My last names Marley.Wes Marley?Yes.Wes Marley, no relation.And who are you, or should I just call you Nosey?Caroline.Im here from New Jersey with my two friends.Ahh.Escaping the winter blues?Wes asked as he cleaned a few glasses and ran a rag over the bar counter.Escaping all right.Not the winter blues, though.My straw sucked air as I finished the last of my drink.That was fast.I stared at my empty glass before pushing it back toward Wes.So what are you escaping, Caroline from New Jersey?He poured me another.Life.The old me.An ex fianc.Reality.You name it.Im on the run from it.Well, Ive got nothing to do.Tell me about it.I did a bad thing.Yep.Rum punch and Pia Colada and no food since six in the morning?If I wasnt hammered now, it wouldnt take long to get there.You?You look like a nice lady.I did!I crooked my pointer finger, signaling him to get closer, and whispered, I had a one night stand.The laugh that boomed out of him was sure to garner looks and interest from all the pretty people on the beach.Shhh.There is no need to laugh.I never did that before and now, I think Im having, what do you call it?Buyers remorse?Wes replied with a smirk.Yes!I snapped my fingers.Thank you.Buyers remorse.So what led you to this buyers remorse?Over the next three Pia Coladas I spilled my guts to Wes Marley, the no relation, not from Jamaica bartender.Id just finished my story when I heard my name.Care!Whereve you been?Melody and Sarah walked up to the bar.Holy crap!Did you two fall asleep?We took a little nap, why?Pretty sure youre sunburned.I poked Sarahs arm, the white fingerprint disappearing in seconds.No way.We used lotion.Besides, it doesnt hurt.The two of them hand printed their stomachs.Carolines right.You two are gonna be hurting in a few hours.I suggest you get some aspirin and go back to your room.Whos this guy?Mel gracefully sidled up to the bar.This is Wes Marley, no relation.Hes being my therapist.Let me get you two back to the room.Seriously.Sarah took off her sunglasses and Melody squealed.What?Your face.You have definite sunglass lines.Do I?Mel pulled off her ginormous, look at me sunglasses and Sarahs eyes bugged out.Holy shit, Mel!I dont feel so good.Melody wrapped her arms around her stomach.Hopefully you dont have sun poisoning, Wes offered.Sun poi?No, Care.I want to go lie down.On it.I hopped off the barstool and turned to Wes.Thanks for listening.Sorry if I was a downer.No problem, mon!He replied in his best Jamaican accent.Anytime.Seriously.Whats your room number?Ill send them an aloe lotion I made.It really helps out the white girls from the north.White girls!Well, I never!I playfully stomped my foot before leaving him the room number.I gingerly wrapped my arm around Melody, and Sarah followed as we walked back to our room.Within minutes of arriving, I had them each take cool showers and dress in the loosest sundresses they packed.I knew, from experience, that the pain would take a bit of time but once it hit, theyd be toast.Each downed a couple of aspirin and just as Wes promised, the lotion hed concocted arrived at the room via housekeeping.By the time Id rubbed them down with the lotion, they were asleep, my buzz had almost worn off, and my stomach was rumbling.I felt bad about leaving them but I figured there wasnt much I could do for them while they slept, so I placed a bottle of water near each of them, took a shower, and left to get something to eat.I could have ordered in but I really wanted to escape the confines of the room.I didnt travel all the way to Jamaica to coop myself up in a bedroom.Id done enough of that in the past weeks.Wearing a long green halter dress and flat strappy sandals, I felt like a million bucks.The salty air did wonders for my already curly hair and I had gotten just enough sun to kiss my skin with a faint tan.I walked through the small town like atmosphere of the resort and watched, with a little pang of jealousy, as couples walked holding hands, kissing, sharing glasses of wine.It was what Id always wanted.Someone to share the fun with, share romance with.Steven was always too busy for fun, too stuffy for romance.In the five years we were together, wed been on only one vacation.If thats what one would call it.We went to Vegas for a conference.Never hit the strip once.I shook off the thoughts that were darkening my mood.No, I was there to relax, to get away, and to have some fun.I decided to sit at the small caf that overlooked the beach.The menu was simple: sandwiches, light pastas, and wines.Perfect.I ordered shrimp over linguine with a white wine sauce and a bottle of Pinot Grigio.The breeze off the water was intoxicating.After dinner, I decided I was going to sit at the waters edge and relax.I wasnt necessarily stressed but my life was turning in a direction it wasnt a few months ago.This was my time to breathe.I was halfway into my meal, breaking a piece of bread, when someone asked, Is this seat taken?I looked up.Dimples.I was lucky I had another swallow of wine left in my glass because I was pretty sure I was going to choke on the large piece of bread that was stuck in my throat.Dimples patted me on the back to quell the cough that erupted when he arrived.We really need to stop meeting like this.Hi.I finally choked out.Hi.He motioned toward the empty seat and I nodded for him to sit.Im Jim.Caroline.Where you from, Caroline?I had to remind myself not to get lost in his dimples.New Jersey.New Jersey, huh?And he gave me that look.The look everyone who isnt from New Jersey gives those who are.And, no, I dont know anyone named Snooki.And Im not a mob wife or a member of the Soprano clan.
