Are you okay?Hes got both elbows propped on the table now, his hands clasped together, and I want those hands on me.His black long sleeve shirt clings to his arms, accentuating his bulging biceps, those broad shoulders, that wide chest.Ive explored every inch of his body the last few days and its still not enough.I cant believe hes really mine.And I cant believe Im his.Im not very hungry, I admit.His frown deepens.Youre the one who wanted to come here.I shrug, feeling silly, my gaze locked on his hands.They are so big.Long fingers, wide palms, a little rough, a little smooth.I love how they touch me, sometimes gentle, sometimes with force.I like it best when he wraps my hair around his fingers and tugs.Oh God, I really love it when he does that I want those hands on me.Now.I guess Im not as hungry as I thought.My stomach is fluttering with nerves.I dont want to eat.I want Drew.I feel sort of crazed with it.Like I need to have him as much as possible before he slips through my fingers and I lose him forever.But Im not going to lose him.Were in this together.I need to remember thatand believe it.Youre being weird.Worry fills his eyes.Are you mad?Did I do something?Just his breathingthat does it for me.Im not mad.Im, um I let my voice trail off, feeling like an idiot.Youre what?Im looking at your hands, I admit with a little sigh.Can I admit out loud that Im horny?That would sound ridiculous.Those dark brows shoot up practically to his hairline.Why?My cheeks are hot.I squirm in my seat again.Imremembering what they did to me earlier.The frown is gone, replaced with a wicked smile that sends my body temperature skyrocketing.He leans across the table, his voice so low it vibrates through me and settles between my legs.Maybe we should go back to my place so I can do that to you all over again.Oh my God, that sounds like the best idea ever.Maybe we should.The smile never leaves his face.In fact, it grows bigger.My quiet, hesitant Drew has morphed into some sort of cocky sex god.You dont want to order anything?I slowly shake my head.Cant we just get pizza again?Later?We had it last night, too.From somewhere different this time.You know, just to mix it up.Or maybe Chinese?I love Chinese.He laughs, the sound husky.You said you wanted to get out of the house for a while because you worried we were becoming addicted to each other.Is that what I said?I honestly cant remember.Whats wrong with being addicted to each other?Arent we still in this pretend mode where were normal people who like to have sex without hangups or issues?I wonder if Drew has ever had sex like this.Carefree and sonormal.Yep.He nods.Maybe I like being addicted to you, I admit softly.We havent said we loved each other yet.I cant work up the nerve.Maybe he cant either.Silly, considering how consumed with love I am for him.He is justamazing.Sweet.Attentive.Funny.Smart.Sexy.I understand him.He understands me.Were perfect for each other.Maybe were too perfect together.Too perfect doesnt really exist.This could all be a faade.Just like our week together over the Thanksgiving break.That week felt fake, though.Surreal.There were real, grounding moments, but for the most part, we were caught up in an act.Maybe were pretending right now, too, but Im trying to be as real as I can with him.Without the baggage and the heartache and the trouble hanging over us.For at least a little while.Itll all come crashing down upon us soon.Thats a reality I dont want to face quite yet.He reaches across the table for my hands and takes them in his.I really like being addicted to you.The smile I send his way is so big it hurts my cheeks.We are so in this addiction together.For once, I know Im not alone.Lets go home and play true confessions, I suggest because Im feeling silly.Nothing heavy, though.We can keep it light and easy.True confessions?Im intrigued.You should be, I say coyly.Its going to be a sexual true confessions.He stiffens the slightest bit and I squeeze his hands in my grip.We need to be open with each other and while the sexual connection we have is amazing, I know sometimes he holds himself back.I understand why.Sort of.Thats where were complete opposites.I was the type who gave it away just so I could feel something, anything, for a little while.Hed rather box himself up and feel absolutely nothing.Fable His voice trails off and his smile fades.I dont know if Im up to that yet.It wont be anything crazy, I promise.I lean over our linked hands and bring them to my mouth, pressing a lingering kiss to his knuckles.No pressure.Just fun.Just fun?He brushes his thumb over the top of my hand and my entire body reacts.Always fun, I whisper.Drew Im curious where Fable thinks shes taking this true confessions game she mentioned.Curious enough to agree to leave the restaurant without ordering, earning a strange look from the waitress when we do.Feeling a little nervous, too, since Im not the most comfortable when it comes to talking about sex.Fable is the first girl Ive ever really wanted.Ive been forever damaged by what happened with Adele.Ive had sex since then, but it was always quick.Meaningless.Never with the same girl twice.After a while, it became too complicated.So I avoided girls.It was easier that way.Our agreement to pretend to be normal has given me some freedom.Im able to let goat least temporarilyof some of the issues that constantly plague me and enjoy my time with Fable.We hardly leave my bed.Weve remained naked pretty much the entire time.Its also been pretty fucking incredible.Lets play strip true confessions, she suggests as we enter my apartment.The chipper sound of her voice makes me burst out laughing.Strip true confessions?I scratch my head as I shut and lock the door.She turns to face me, her bright smile stealing my breath.We confess, then we take off a piece of clothing.Didnt we already plan on taking off our clothes?Of course, but this makes it much more interesting.Grabbing my hand, Fable leads me back to my bedroom.She tugs me down with her so we both sit on the edge of the bed and she turns to face me, her expression solemn, those pretty green eyes beguiling.Now, Ill go first.We must confess something sexual that weve never done.Or something weve always wanted to do.And then we take off one piece of clothing when were finished.Are you game?I have no idea where shes going with this, but Im curious to hear what she has to say.Im game.Perfect.Okay.She blows out a harsh breath and drops her gaze.This is more nerve racking than I thought.If shes nervous, Im in huge trouble.Shes much more open sexually than I am.Though the more time I spend with her, the more Im coming around.Its just me, I remind her and when she glances up, I offer her a reassuring smile.Im not going to judge you.I know, she says softly.All right, Im going for it.Ive never been taken from behind before.I mock frown.Taken?She rolls her eyes.You knowIve never done it doggy style.God, that sounds gross, phrasing it like that.It sounds arousing as hell but I school my expression, going for serious.Im sure that could be arranged.Me taking you from behind, doggy style.Her cheeks color a pretty shade of pink and she shrugs out of her zip up sweatshirt, tossing it on the floor.Shes only wearing a white tank top with a black bra beneath it.Jesus, shes hot.Im sure it could.Okay, your turn.Uh There are a lot of things I could confess.Dont be shy.She smiles, all pure, sweet seduction.Come on.Out with it.Pick an easy one.Ive never slept all night with a girl.Until you.I yank my sweatshirt off and throw it on top of hers on the floor.Aw.She leans in and gives me a quick kiss.I love that Im your first, she murmurs against my lips before she moves away from me.Shes a lot of firsts for me.Its embarrassing to admit just how many.Ive never had sex outside.A wistful look crosses her face.I think that would be incredibly romantic.Under the stars, a cool breeze over hot skin.Maybe on the beach, by the ocean Sand getting in our asses, I add because I cant help itthats my first thought when I hear sex on the beach.Fable smacks me on the arm.Youre such a guy.Way to kill the romantic mood.You knew it would happen.I rub my arm, watching as she takes off one sock.Only one?An article of clothing a confession, right?She shrugs, looking smug.Ill remember this.But then again, do I want to confess that much?Ive never had phone sex.I take off a sock just like she did.Me either.She takes off her other sock and giggles.This is silly.It was your idea, I point out.Yeah, yeah.Fable nibbles her lower lip.This ones crazy.Im afraid youll freak out when I say it.No going back now.You have to tell me, I urge.Hell, its supposed to be my turn, but Im letting her skip right on by me.Fine, you asked for it.She takes a deep breath.Lately Ive been thinking about getting my nipples pierced.Im stunned.Are you serious?She nods and bends her head, letting her hair fall in front of her face.Is that crazy?Sort of.Shes full of surprises.I like it.Hell, I like her.A lot.Dont you think itll hurt?Yeah, but I can deal with a little pain.She keeps her head bent.Ive heard it feels good to have them tugged on duringyou know.Okay, my girl is trying to drive me crazy.Ive never thought of nipple rings as particularly sexy before, but the thought of me tugging on a tiny silver hoop with my lips and tongue and hearing her moan I get hard just thinking about it.Would you ever get your nipples pierced?she asks, lifting her head so her eyes meet mine.Uh, I doubt it, I croak, then clear my throat.Its just a thought.I doubt Ill go through with it either.She slowly lifts the hem of her tank and takes it off, revealing her toned stomach, her enticing black satin bra.I want to grab her and kiss her.Screw these true confessions.Your turn, she whispers.Studying her cleavage, I start to sweat.Ive, uhnever done the dirty talk thing before.Isnt that the same theory as phone sex?She frowns.Not really.Hmm.She taps her smirking lips with her index finger.So youre saying youd like it if I leaned over and whispered in your ear that I want to suck your cock?I swallow hard.Hell, Fable.Her smile grows.You would definitely like that, wouldnt you?She gets on her hands and knees and crawls toward me, nuzzling my cheek with her nose, her mouth close to my ear.Drew, she whispers.Do you know how wet I get just looking at you?I swallow hard, slipping my arm around her waist so I can bring her closer to me.Are you trying to kill me?Maybe.She laughs, the sound sexy as hell, and I tackle her, pinning her beneath me so she cant get away.I thrust my hips against hers and her eyes darken.Ooh, I can tell I am totally getting to you.All this true confession talk.A man can only take so much.Lifting up, I take off my shirt, pleased when I catch her drinking me in with her greedy gaze.She has no problem letting me know how much I turn her on and I love it.Im thinking I need to see just how wet you really are.A little sound of pleasure escapes her and she clamps her lips shut.Why dont you do some investigating and find out?Love is composed of a single soul inhabiting two bodies.Aristotle  Fable After playing our silly, sexy game of true confessions, we tease each other like crazy, taking off each others clothes between lingering kisses and possessive caresses meant to ignite.I love this playful side of Drew.Hes funny, hes sweet, and hes sexy as hell.When he said he wanted to see just how wet I really was, everything inside me went loose and hot.And when he proceeded to yank off my sweatpants and slip his fingers beneath my panties, I nearly came right then and there.Being with Drew, naked and open like thisIve never experienced anything like it.Ive never felt as close to another human being in my life as I feel to Drew Callahan at this very moment.Im pinned beneath him, trapped, but theres nowhere else Id rather be.His soft hair brushes against my chest as he makes his descent down my body, sending a scattering of gooseflesh across my skin.His hot mouth is everywhere, searching me, and I feel like Im floating on a cloud, completely lost, too caught up Look at me, baby.I open my eyes, startled by the endearment.He rarely calls me anything but my name.Watch me, he whispers.I do as he asks, breathless as he drops tender kisses in the valley between my breasts, across my belly, all the while his gaze never leaving mine.Reaching out, I thread my fingers through his hair, stroking his head, and he covers my breasts with his mouth, drawing one nipple between his lips with a slight tug.I close my eyes, too overwhelmed by the delicious sensation of his mouth so intimately on my flesh, and I hold him close.Spreading my legs, I accommodate his big body more fully as he presses against mine.This is exactly what Ive been wanting between us.No walls, no barriers.He finally seems as open to me as I am to him and I love it.I love him.He braces his upper body above me, his hands pressed into the mattress on either side of my head.I meet his gaze, my heart fluttering as if it could take flight, when I notice the expression on his face.Its as if hes at war with himself and what he should do next.Whats wrong?I ask, scared hes going to say or do something that will break this magical moment between us.I have a confession to make.He hangs his head, almost as if hes embarrassed.Ive never done this before.I frown.Um, I hate to break it to you, but weve definitely done this before.Together.More than once.Chuckling, he meets my gaze once more.I meanshit, I dont know how to say this.More true confessions, Drew?Reaching out, I touch his cheek, my fingers lingering on the stubble that lines his jaw.I like the way his bristly cheeks feel against my own when he kisses me.Its sorta hot.He is all sorts of hot.Dont be shy.Just say it.He leans in, his mouth at my ear, his breath warm against my cheek.Ive never gone down on a girl before, he whispers.Okay, now Im shocked.I rest my hand on his chest and push him away slightly so our eyes can meet once again.Seriously?Seriously.He nods.I notice his cheeks are ruddy and my heart squeezes.God, he is so stinking cute and hes all mine.Mine, mine, mine.Were pretending were perfectly normal and were not.Were both all sorts of messed up.But I dont care if hes troubled and has dealt with an endless amount of bullshit at the hands of a woman so disgusting I cant even think her name, let alone say it.I still want him.All the time.Desperately.I know hes damaged.I also know hes trying his best to work through the damage and become a whole person again.More than anything, I know he needs me.And I need him.I love him.And Drew loves me.Even though we havent said it to each other yet, I know deep in my heart its the truth.If you dont want to do it, you dont have to.Im giving him an excuse to back out because the last thing I want to do is pressure him.Hes dealt with enough pressure in his life.Our game of true confessions was hard for him.I knew it would be.But I think it helped us become closer.A sexy smile curves his lips and Im momentarily breathless at the sight of it.Oh, I want to, Fable.More than you can possibly imagine.Now its my turn to become embarrassed, and I feel my cheeks heat.So what are you waiting for?I justwanted to warn you.In case I somehow screw it up.He lowers himself so his body covers mine, his mouth against my neck.Hes kissing and nibbling me there, driving me crazy with the way he touches me, and I close my eyes, losing myself.Finding myself.With him.Hes somehow worried hes going to go about this all wrong, but he doesnt know that no matter what, he cant possibly screw this up.That everything he does, everything he says, how he touches me, is all so perfect, its scary.Hes all I ever want.All Ill ever need.Drew maps my body with his hands and mouth, his tongueGod, his tongue.He licks me everywhere, tasting me, savoring me, until Im writhing beneath him, my entire body on fire.He skims his fingers along the insides of my thighs so lightly I shiver.My entire body is shaking in anticipation as he kisses the sensitive flesh of my stomach, my hips, my thighs And when he finally, finally delivers that first tentative lick between my legs, I moan so loud Im almost embarrassed.But Im not.How can I be, when the man I love so much is overwhelming me with pleasurable sensation after pleasurable sensation?He searches me intimately with his tongue, slipping one long finger deep inside me, and another shivery moan escapes as I arch against him.Its too much.Its not enough.I both want to come and make it last and when he increases his pace, I know Im dangerously close to splintering completely apart.Tell me where, baby, he whispers against me as Im shuddering and gasping, my fingers clenched in his hair.Tell me how you like it.Higher, I choke out and he moves higher, his tongue flicking against my clit, his finger deep inside my body.Oh, shit, that is it.Its perfect, just perfect where hes touching me, licking me.Right.Fucking.There With a ragged whisper of his name falling from my lips, Im coming.The waves wash over me again and again, sweeping me under, banishing my thoughts so all I can do is feel.And then I feel him.Drew.Looming over me, his big hands gripping my hips as he positions me, and without warning, he slides deep inside my body.I gasp at first contact, going completely still as he fills me completely.He dips his head, his mouth crushing mine, and I can taste myself on his lips, his tongue.I dont care.God, it arouses me even more, and within an instant our bodies are a frenzy of movement as we rock against each other, into each other, taking us higher and higher until were both panting, sweating, heaving masses of tangled flesh.He presses his forehead to mine, his breath hot in my face, and I open my eyes to find him watching me.Fable.He swallows hard and closes his eyes, breathing so deep his bare chest brushes against mine.You feel so fucking good.Im completely undone.So is he.I feel like were both going to absolutely die if we dont come at this very instant.Together.Orgasm number one is already a distant memory.Orgasm number two is threatening to take over and I wind my legs around his waist, sending him deeper.His thrusts increase, become more urgent, and I move with him.Encouraging him with murmured words, stroking his back with my fingernails, resting my palms on his muscular backside so I can push him farther.Our bodies are smashed so close together, I feel like were a permanent part of each other.Ive heard those sorts of declarations before.Where two become one and you cant tell where one begins and the other ends, blah, blah, blah.I always thought it sounded like a bunch of romantic crap.But I feel that way right now with Drew.As if our bodies are entwined, bound so tight we could never, ever come apart.His heart is mine.And my heart is his.I breathe his name across his lips as I begin to tremble.This orgasm is different from the first one.It starts low in my belly, radiating through my muscles, my bloodstream, until my entire body is shaking.He keeps moving, keeps thrusting, hard, harder, driving my climax on until he strains above me, consumed by his own orgasm.Im captivated by the powerful display of his tense muscles and I run my hands across his shoulders, down his chest.His skin is hot, his flesh unyielding, and tears form at the corner of my eyes at the swell of emotion that threatens to take over me.The need to express my feelings for him is so overwhelming, Im afraid I might burst.I dont want to say it first.He may have written it in a note, but hes never, ever said those words out loud to me.I want him to say them.I need him to say the words first.Squeezing my eyes shut, I inhale deep, trying to calm my racing heart.Drew drops a lingering kiss to my forehead before he pulls away and climbs out of bed.I assume hes throwing away the condom I never even realized hed slipped on and I roll over on my side, hugging myself as I curl up into a ball.My emotions are a jumbled mess.What the hell just happened?Weve had plenty of sex the last few days, but this time I feel like I was hit by a semi truck.Hey.He rests his hand on my bare shoulder.Are you all right?Yeah.I keep my back to him as he slides into bed with me.He wraps an arm around my middle and hauls me in close, so my back is nestled to his front.Hes still breathing hard, too, and I snuggle deeper into the pillow, closing my eyes on a soft sigh when he starts raking his fingers through my hair.I really love it when he does that.And he knows it, too.Does it bother you?What, uh, happened to me?The question is so out of nowhere, I turn in his embrace so I can see his face, look into his eyes.What are you talking about?What you found out.When you were with me at my dads house.Does it bother you?Of course it bothers me, but not in the way you think.I touch his cheek, forcing him to meet my gaze.I hate what youve endured.I hate what she did to you and how it makes you feel guilty.More than anything, I hurt for you.Your pain is still so fresh and I wish I could somehow take it away.You do take it away.You make me feel like a real person.That its okay to be so free like this.Together.Sexually.He closes his eyes, breathing deep.You make me feel normal.Here I am being selfish and wishing he would just tell me he loves me, and hes still going through all of these turbulent emotions.Worrying that Ill think less of him because hes been abused.Yes, abused.He can call it an affair or whatever the hell else he says happened with Adele, but she molested him.I wish he could really see that.Drew.I brush my fingers through his too long hair.No matter what, were in this together.Im not going to run.Whatever we discover, whatever happens, Im going to stand by your side and support you.He opens his eyes.I have no more secrets with you.At least none that I know of.Ive bared my soul to you.Ive got nothing to hide.Neither do I, I confess softly.Yet here we still are.Together.Together.He smiles faintly.Can I tell you something?Its been bothering me that you dont know this.I have to get it off my chest.Wariness creeps over me and I try to shove it away.What is it?I know He huffs out a breath.The day Vanessa died, I know you think I was inside with Adelebut it wasnt like that.We were having an argument.Oh?I try my best to remain neutral but anger grows inside me, like a slow, simmering pot threatening to boil over at any minute.I was telling her she had to leave me alone.She tried her best to convince me to, uh, you know, but I refused.He closes his eyes again, pain etched all over his handsome face.I just didnt want you thinking less of me.That I was off fooling around with my stepmom while Vanessa drowned.It wasnt like that.Not at all.My heart hurts so much.His pain is like a living, breathing thing and I wish I could take it all away.Curling my arms around him, I crush my body to his, scooting up on the mattress so his head can rest on my chest.I press my lips to his forehead and kiss him, the tears flowing freely down my cheeks.Im sorry she did this to you.I hate her.He clings to me much like I cling to him, his face pressed against my bare breasts, and I swear I feel dampness on my skin.Like hes crying.Which only makes me cry more.I love you, he murmurs against me.I love you so much, Fable.My heart cracks in two, both at his pain and at his beautiful, much needed declaration.I love you, too.Ive never felt more complete.Drew I told her I loved her, I blurt out of nowhere.Dr.Harris nods, no emotion on her face whatsoever.As usual.What did Fable say?She said she loved me, too.I look at my hands, remembering earlier this morning.When I woke Fable up by kissing her softly all over her naked body, the rising sunlight casting her skin a golden hue.Our bodies came together lazily, our whispered I love yous fueling me completely.Our two days pretending the outside world didnt exist ended on a perfect note.Now were both back to reality.Do you believe her?Docs question surprises me.I think I do.Mmm hmm.Shit.Its hard to believe someone loves you for who you are when theyve seen all your faults and know all your secrets.But doesnt that make it even more believable?Fables seen everything.She knows everything.Yet she still wants to be with you?I guess so.I shrug and change the subject.Adele called me a few days ago.And what did she have to say?She accused me of poisoning my dads mind with reasons why he should divorce her.Is she right?No.I told him he had to make that choice for himself.Im not about to give him advice on how to handle her, I say vehemently.My emotions turn into chaos every time I think of the woman.Its exhausting.And are they still reconciling?I dont know.I havent talked to my dad since he told me he might change his mind about the divorce.I dont bother telling Dr.Harris how Fable and I ignored everyone else and pretended we were normal.Shed probably say we were just avoiding the inevitable and accuse me of trying to have an unhealthy relationship with unrealistic expectations.Yep, Ive been to more than my fair share of shrinks when I was younger, before the really bad shit started.I know the drill.Luckily enough, I really connect with this one.She gets me.She doesnt push and she doesnt judge.Its hard, isnt it, being in a relationship?With all of your extra baggage, do you think you can be there for Fable when she needs you?Ouch.One of those tough questions the doc is famous for.I want to believe I can be there for her.Shes strong.Sometimes I think shes stronger than me, emotionally.But doesnt she have her own set of problems?We all do, you know.And I remember you mentioning she doesnt have the best home life.I lean back against my chair, sprawl my legs out in front of me.Her mom is selfish and never around.She has a little brother whos fourteen and she worries about him a lot.I go on to tell Dr.Harris how Owen punched me when he realized I was the one who supposedly broke his sisters heart.Id forgotten to mention it the last time we saw each other, Id been so wrapped up in my fathers non divorce announcement.Im starting to see why the two of you are drawn to each other, Dr.Harris says.Glancing up, I catch her smiling at me and I frown.What do you mean by that?Your experiences are somewhat similar.You both come from a broken home, you both carry heavy responsibilities and unnecessary guilt.You have money and she doesnt, so theres one difference.You run from your problems and it seems that she confronts them, from what youve told me.Shes the strongest person I know.I wish I had even half of her strength.Dont you think she ever feels weak?Powerless?Ive never seen Fable anything less than mighty and strong.I dont know.Im sure she does.You need her, right?So dont you believe she needs you just as much?Her life cant be easy.She has responsibilities, a job, a brother to take care of, and a mother to take care of as well.Whom do you take care of, Drew?I swallow hard.Myself.Theres no one else I have to worry about.Im not good at taking care of other people.Look at what happened to Vanessa.She died on my watch.Do you work?Why is she asking me this?She already knows the answer.School is my job.And football.But youre taking a lighter load this semester.And the football season is over, Dr.Harris points out gently.Are you trying to make me feel guilty for not having as much responsibility as Fable does?It seems like shes purposely trying to make me angry.No, she says slowly.Im trying to make you see that shes probably going to need you.Do you think you have the capability to be there for her?I dont My voice trails off when I see the pointed look Dr.Harris is giving me.Yes.I can be there for her.I have to be.I love her.Thats what people who are in love do.They support each other.Youre right.Relationships arent easy, especially for people who still feel somewhatbroken.Are you saying you think Im broken?Im immediately on the defensive.Not at all.I said people who feel they are broken.Dont you feel that way still?Im quiet.Thats answer enough, Im sure.Just because you feel like youre broken doesnt mean she views you the same way.Fable sees all of your potential.All of your strengths, and she believes in you completely.Otherwise, she wouldnt be with you.Right?I hope so.Dr.Harris sets down the iPad that she uses to take notes and smiles at me.Just remember that your relationship with Fable is still in that fresh, euphoric honeymoon stage.Cherish her.Enjoy her.But never forget you need to be there for her through the good times and the bad.And Im saying this in a rather subjective way, Drew: I believe that girl is good for you.She can help you heal.I can hardly contain my smile.Are you saying Fable has your approval?Doc laughs.I shouldnt be talking to you like this, you know.Im losing sight of my objectivity.But from everything I hear you say about her, that would be a resounding yes.If I want her, I need to fight for her.Drew Callahan  Fable I cruise into the restaurant late in the afternoon humming under my breath, offering a hello to the bitchy chick who works the hostesss desk.Her jaw about drops to the floor and I smile blithely at her, thrilled that I threw her off her catty game.Nothing can get me down today.Im on a complete Drew high.Heading toward the back, I go to clock in and see Jens already hanging out in the small employee lounge area, sipping on a Starbucks Frap and watching me.Fancy you coming back to work, she drawls.I trade one shift with someone and its suddenly I dont want to work?So unfair.I stash my purse in one of the lockers provided to keep our stuff safe and twirl the lock, keeping my back to Jen for fear of any judgmental staring on her part.Colin wants to talk to you.He asked me to tell him when you got here, she says quietly.I turn to face her, fear turning my blood ice cold.Is he going to fire me?No.Jen doesnt offer any other sort of explanation.Whats going to happen, then?Hes going to ask if you take this job seriously.He sees a lot of potential in you, Fable.He wants you to eventually take it to the next level here.What the hell does that mean?Give me a break.Im a freaking waitress.Yeah, from what I can see so far, the tips are fabulous.Better than any other place Ive ever worked.But theres not a lot of room for growth at The District.Im not stupid.You know how T goes around helping him open restaurants and training the staff?Colin has huge plans.He wants to open up a bunch of Districts all over the state and eventually the west coast, turning it into a chain.And he needs more training staff.Ive been here only a couple of weeks, I point out incredulously.I told you, he thinks you have potential.Youve been with him longer.Why wouldnt he choose you for his new training person?Or any of the other girls who work here?I dontlike to travel.Hmmm, theres something shes hiding, I can tell.And the other girls, theyre just here to get dressed up and look pretty and pick up guys.They view this job as a way to get spending money and keep Mom and Dad happy while they nearly fail college.They dont have future aspirations for the food industry.Jen shakes her head.Well, I dont have future aspirations for the food industry either, I retort.Hell no do I want to work at a restaurant for the rest of my life.I hate this sort of thing.Im doing it because its all I know.Well, what are your future aspirations?Funny thing is, I havent a clue.I always talk about having hopes and dreams and wanting to get the hell away from this small town.But what do I really want to do?What do I want to be when I grow up?I havent a fucking clue.Is she hereoh.Colin stops short as he strides into the room, looking totally surprised to see me standing there.Fable.I was looking for you.I heard, I cant help but say, earning a death glare from Jen.Have a minute?Id like to talk to you.He smiles, his stance relaxed, all that easygoing dont worry charm buzzing all around him.He looks damn good in dark jeans and a white button down shirt he left untucked, the sleeves rolled up to reveal strong, tanned forearms.I may be in love with Drew, but I can appreciate a handsome man when I see one.Am I in trouble?I ask, making sure Jen wasnt lying.Not at all, he says quickly, his voice smooth.I raise a brow, letting him know I dont quite believe him.Shouldnt I be preparing the tables for the evening?Jen has it under control for now.Besides, I only need to take up a few minutes of your time.Then you can go polish glasses to your hearts content.He chuckles and presses his hand to my lower back when he approaches me, guiding me to his office, his hand never leaving me.I shrug away from his touch the second we walk into his office.He shuts the door behind us, rounding his desk and pointing a finger toward an empty chair.Have a seat.Sitting on the edge of the seat, I tap my heel against the bare wood floor.Were wearing the lace shirt/black shorts getup again and I know when Drew picks me up from work, hes probably going to attack me.Dirty girl that I am, I cant freaking wait.What happened with the shift change, Fable?Colin asks once he settles in behind his desk.I had something come up.I shrug.Something personal.He raises a single brow.Is everything all right?Oh, yeah.Everythings fine.I dont mind when my employees switch out their schedules as long as everyones covered and as long as people dont make a habit out of it.I do have some concerns, though.He rests his folded arms on top of the desk, his expression solemn.Are you happy here?Im taken aback by his question.Um, yeah.His eyes harden.Really?What are you digging at?I mean, Ive only been working here a few weeks.If youre not happy with me, then go ahead and fire me.I perch farther on the edge of my chair, ready to take flight if need be.You automatically assume the worst, dont you?This little meeting is getting ridiculous.Listen, say what you need to say and get it over with.Im not in the mood for a bunch of games tonight.Fine.Get over your pissy attitude and Ill tell you everything you need to hear.My jaw drops open.I cant believe he just called me pissy.But hes right.I am.Whats up?I ask weakly.I know youve only been here for a few weeks, but you impress me.A lot.You only need to be told once what to do and how to do it, and you have it under control.The customers like you.T thinks youre fantastic and I value her opinion above that of anyone else in this place.Colin leans across his desk, as if he really wants to get his message across.I want to give you more hours, but I wont do it if youre going to bail on your shifts all the time.I wont bail on my shifts, I say automatically.He smiles.So youll take the increase in hours.Absolutely.Im giving you a sixty day probation period.Once that passes and Im satisfied with the job youre doing, youll automatically receive a raise.My eyebrows shoot up.Really?Really.He nods.I plan on opening up a few more locations in the Sacramento area over the next twelve to eighteen months.I need people who are able to train my new employees the way T does.Is that something that interests you?Im like Jen.Travel is near to impossible for me, what with Owen in school and my mom never around.But I cant say no, can I?The restaurant biz definitely doesnt interest me long term but I need a steady, good paying job, especially if I really go through with it and get an apartment for just Owen and me.What Colins talking about sounds like my every current financial wish come true.Um, possibly?My vague answer doesnt please my boss at all.Hes frowning at me big time.Look, I have a little brother and our relationship with my mom iscomplicated.His bunched expression smooths out completely.Well discuss everything further once we get closer to the possibility of my needing you for training purposes.Truthfully, the plans for the restaurants are just thatstill in the planning stages.Sounds amazing, I say weakly, because it does.This guy is ambitious as hell and I cant help but admire him.It will be, trust me.The grin he flashes me is so bright it momentarily blinds me.Now get back out there and help Jen.We have three reservations tonight, all big parties.Groaning, I stand and hurry out of his office, my feet already aching, and I havent even really started working yet.Do you work tomorrow?I grab my purse out of the locker I stashed it in and shut the metal door with a loud clang.Im exhausted.Tonights shift was rough and I cant wait to go home and collapse into bed.No, thank God.Me either.Look.Jen glances around, as if shes afraid someones going to catch us talking.Weird, considering were all alone in the room.There have been some things going on in my life and Im dying to go out and blow off my steam, you know?So you want to go with me tomorrow night and grab some drinks?Maybe have a girls night out?My first response is to say no.I dont want to miss out on one night with Drew, which is ridiculous and needy, but damn it, he only just came back into my life.I want to spend every moment I have with him.Then I catch the look on Jens face, the worry and need in her gaze.Does she not have any other friends to ask?Or is she just like me, with really no friends at all?Sure, I say before I can talk myself out of it.Where do you want to go?
