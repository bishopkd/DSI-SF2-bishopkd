President Piasecki, he says to my breastbone.Thats got a nice ring to it.I close my eyes.Im twenty years old.I have a year and a half of college left.Im supposed to be drinking too much, partying too much, playing rugby, studying abroad and sleeping around and figuring out what I want to do with my life.Im not supposed to know, already, that I want to spend the rest of my life with him.But I do know that.I know a lot of things.President Leavitts got a nice ring to it, too, I say.His eyes come up, a question in them.Youre not talking about me.President Caroline Leavitt, I say slowly.I watch him get it.Understanding shows up on his mouth firstalways his mouthand creeps upward, over his cheekbones, into his eyes.A surprised happiness he couldnt hide from me if he tried.He doesnt try.He just grins and glides his hand down my stomach, right past the waistband of my pajama pants and into the wet heat of me, making me gasp.Youd make a hot first lady, I say, before he scatters whats left of my marbles.Bite your lip, baby.I do.As he works his fingers inside me, I bite it hard enough that in the morning itll be swollen, but thats fine.That little twinge of painthat taste of bloodonly heightens the pleasure.He makes me come with his hand, and then he moves inside me and makes love to me so slow, so quiet, for so long that I feel another orgasm begin to build.That dragging sweaty sweetness swelling between us.When its rising up, starting to sharpen, he draws me to my knees and pushes inside me from behind.He pulls my hair off my neck and whispers in my ear, Im going to fuck you like this in the Oval Office.Swear to God.West.Head in my hands, my ass in the air, Im trying not to laugh when he makes me come again, and this time he goes over the edge with me.I drop with my face into the pillow, heavy and exhausted, drowsy.Hes so hot and heavy and all over me, his sweaty, familiar weight, the scents of our bodies.Nothing can touch us.Ive never lost sight of my happiness.Not for one minute.West It snowed a ton that December.The first week of Putnams winter break was supposed to be Frankies last week of school, but it dumped so much on Putnam County that all the schools were closed.Caroline had planned to spend the few days before Christmas with her dad, but she ended up stuck at our place.The temperature hovered around thirty degrees.The garage roof creaked and groaned under the weight of the snow.We ate grilled cheese with tomato soup and watched Christmas movies.When we were starting to get restless, Laurie and Rikki loaned us a thousand piece puzzle of the earth made up of hundreds of tiny pictures, and we spread it out on the coffee table and worked on it together for most of the morning and the early afternoon of Christmas Eve.After a while, Caroline and Frankie wandered off.Frankie borrowed my art pencils and fussed with a drawing she wanted to give Mom for Christmas.Caroline sat on the couch researching media opportunities on her laptop, gearing up to become Iowas revenge porn poster girl once the holidays were over.I stayed with the puzzle, identifying one piece after another.Matching them to their neighbors by color, shape, content, and slotting them into place.Piece by piece, the satisfaction built until Id finished the whole thing.I looked at what Id made and realized Id spent the entire day absorbed in a metaphor.The puzzle was the futureformless, confusing.A thousand tiny decisions Id have to make.A thousand things to figure out without anything much to guide me but some idea of where I wanted to end up.That night, with snow blanketing the fields and the roof of Laurie and Rikkis housewith snow on the roads and over the stair rail and blown up into the corners of every windowwe made a huge bowl of popcorn and watched The Grinch Who Stole Christmas.I sat between Frankie and Caroline, my arms spread behind them on the couch, my feet up on the coffee table, lights winking on the little artificial Christmas tree that Frankie and I had picked up at Walmart.After my sister went to bed, Caroline helped me put the presents out, and we turned off the overhead lights and soaked up the glow of the tree, watching the snow fall.We didnt say anything.We didnt have to say anything.We were here.And as for what came nextit would be like the puzzle.Complicated, but I could take it one piece at a time.Even though I came from a fucked up family in a fucked up place, and even though Id been through a lot of fucked up shit that didnt teach me the right things to live a normal life, I had clear eyes, curiosity, and perseverance.I had Caroline with me.The future would slot into place one piece at a time.No, I know.Its lunchtime on Christmas Day.Caroline is pacing from the front door of the apartment to the back of the kitchen.Shes got her dad on a headset, her hands sunk into the back pockets of her jeans.Shes wearing a dark green sweater with a drapey neck that looks soft and open and inviting.She means it to be festive, and it is, but its so fucking sexy, too.Theres a shadow under her collarbone where Id love to put my mouth.Yeah, I know, she tells her dad.Sorry not to be there.I wanted to.If it clears up in an hour or two, Ill see if I can make it tonight.I must be frowning, because when she passes and catches sight of me, she lifts her eyebrows and her shoulders at once, like, What do you want me to tell him?Its Christmas.I 80s gonna be too slippery, I say.It might be, she tells her dad, who must have said the exact same thing I did.Ill keep an eye on the weather and She pauses.Then, Yeah.If you think thats the best way to handle it, all right.Handle what?Frankie asks.Shes sitting at the kitchen table, drawing in her new sketchbook with the pencils I gave her for Christmas.Dont eavesdrop, I tell her.Its bad manners.You are.True.She rolls her eyes.Hypocrite.Shes learning all these big words from the gifted and talented teacher.Shes been reading a ton, toothe teacher hooked her up with a librarian at the Putnam Public Library who saves out books just for her.Frankie is blowing through a book every day or two.She doesnt want to talk to me about them, but Jeff Gorham tells me its good for her.Enriching.Hes going to reschedule the family Christmas dinner, Caroline tells us both.Since theyre not sure when Ill be able to get there.Frankie gives me a pointed glance and sticks out her tongue.A moment later, Carolines saying, I need to talk to you about that, actually, as she walks down the hall toward the bedroom.She closes the door behind her.Whats she need to talk to him about?Frankie asks.None of your business, Little Miss Nosy.You dont even know, I bet.Im pretty sure I do, though.More sure when Carolines end of the conversation gets loud enough for me to register that shes angry, though I cant quite make out the words through the door.Then I can make them out just fine.For the fifth time, Im not asking you, Im telling you.Ive already made a decision, and Im not going to just wait and see how I feel in a few days.I already know how I feel.Thats why Im informing you of my feelings.Stay here, I say to Frankie.I find Caroline sprawled on the bed, hands and legs flung wide, scowling at the ceiling.No, she says.No!I dont accept that.I knew youd say it, and I hear where youre coming from, but I dont accept it.I sit down on the bed, prop my back against the headboard, and extend my legs over top of hers.She reaches out to find my hand.The conversation takes a nasty turn, and every time she raises her voice, she squeezes my hand tighter.Not listening to me.No, Dad, I hear you, but no.Damn it, Dad, its got nothing to do with him!She doesnt say anything too ugly to take back, but shes upset enough that her voice cracks, and I can tell shes not getting anywhere with her old man.Eventually, they start cooling down.Ive never heard anyone argue loud enough to be audible through a closed door and then, ten minutes later, work back around to, Merry Christmas, Daddy.I love you, too.Caroline hangs up and shifts onto her side.I lie beside her.She turns her face into the bedspread, letting her hair conceal her expression.Are you crying?I ask.She sniffles.No.Its okay if youre crying.Im not.Im gathering my strength to fight another day.Okay.Does you gathering your strength but not crying mean that now would be a bad time to give you your Christmas present?Slowly, she sits up.Her eyes arent red, but her throat and cheeks are flushed.I think if shes going to be president, well have to work on her poker face at some point.You already gave me a bunch of presents, she says.Those were from Frankie.Since you paid for them, they were from you.I love my scarf.She wore it earlier over her pajama T shirtorange and blue and red, with silvery threads shot through it.It looked good.Felt good, seeing her wear something Id bought her.I release her hand so I can get up and dig around on the top shelf of my closet.The jewelry store box is dense as a rock in my hand.The leather bracelet seems stiff and clumsy when I hold it out to her, a symbol Im not sure about.What if she doesnt want the reminder?Maybe I should have buried it in the backyard.But Caroline extends her wrist and lets me put it on her.My name pressed into leather, snugged around her skin.She traces the letters with one finger.Smiles at me.Its okay?I ask.Its good.She draws close and kisses me, and it feels good.Like Ive righted a wrong, restored something that was out of balance.When she eases away, I press the jewelry box into her hand.She takes it with eyes so huge, I wonder for a second what the fuck I did wrong.Then I figure it out and laugh.Its not a ring.But good to know its too soon for that.Its notI didnt mean Its fine, Caro.Open it.Inside are the heavy silver links I bought her.Pretty, she says, lifting the bracelet out.Whats this on it?The light catches the charm when she lifts it to the light.She answers her own question.Its a comb.West I thought Id give you both, I say.The comb, and the watch chain.Itsmaybe thats not a good present, but I thought And then her arms are around me, so I dont have to say the rest of it.West.Shes crying for real now.I didnt mean to make you cry.It just reminded me, is all.Ive thought so many times of her telling me not to write a story over us.Not to give myself a rolegood guy or bad guy, sheriff or villain, because lifes more complicated than that.That conversation was never about the story she read in English.It was about me.It was Caroline telling me I fucked up, but I could have another chance.When I went to the jewelry store, I was going to see about silver combs to give her.I thought she should have a keepsake of the moment she offered me what I most neededwhat I didnt even know I needed.But then I thought, No, I dont want her to have half.I want her to have everything.She kisses me.Its perfect.When I kiss her back, she drags me on top of her, the cool silver links dripping down my neck from where shes clutched her fingers around them.Youre perfect, she says.Im so fucking far from perfect.She kisses my lips, my cheeks, my closed eyes.Close enough for me.I roll to my side, and we lie there for a few minutes, legs intertwined, looking at each other.Close enough.Frankie.I tap her door again.Open up.Leave me alone!she shouts.Franks, honey, its Christmas.Youre crying.Im not leaving you alone.Im not crying!She throws something at the door that hits hard enough to make me take a step back.Carolines behind me, hands cupping her elbows.You want me to try?Twenty minutes.Twenty lousy minutes on the phone with my mom on fucking Christmas Day, and me in the next room the whole time monitoring the call, but it still ends up this waywith my sister flinging the phone down, busting out in sobs, and running from the room.Mom didnt even call until right before Frankies bedtime.I tried her earlier, hoping to get it over with, but she answers the phone when she feels like it, and Christmas is no exception.Usually, we get her when shes on her way somewhere in the car and she wants to fill ten minutes with pointless chatter.How are you guys doing?shell ask, but she doesnt want to know.Frankie has a harder time than I do with the calls.Some afternoons Ill come in from working with Laurie to find her shut in her room, her hand drawn STAY OUT sign taped to the door, and Ill look at Caroline and mouth, Mom called?Yeah, shell mouth in response.Then shell make cookies, or Ill download an episode of a show Frankie likes and use it to pry her out of her isolation.Tonight, Mom was more emotional than I felt like dealing with.I miss you guys, oh my gosh, she said when I was on the phone with her.Like fucking crazy.There was a looseness to her speech, the way it spilled out of her, that made me reluctant to turn the call over to Frankie, but I figured, it was Christmas.I couldnt really say no.I shouldve said no.I dont know what to do, I say.You could give her a minute to cool off.Shes not mad, though.Not really.Shes hurt, and I dont want to leave her be.I tap at the door again.Frankie.Open up, or Ill take the knob off the door and let myself in.You cant do that.I can, actually.Youre not my dad!Im your brother and the guy whos paying the rent around here, so open the door, Franks.Im serious.No.For fucks sake.West Caroline says.I turn around, put my back to the door, and slide down it.I dont know how to be her father, I say.Youre doing great.Ive been at it for weeks.Asking her questions.Being here, trying to let her know Im listening, talking to the fucking counselor, talking to the gifted and talented teacher, filling out the fucking paperwork, but Im not getting anywhere.Caroline slides down next to me.Touches my arm.You are.She wont even let me in the fucking room.Its just the holiday, Caroline says.Talking to your mom.Her feelings are running high, but shes going to come around.Shes pissed at me for taking that top away from her.It was the right thing to do.The top was from Mom, low cut and completely wrong for a ten year old.We sent Mom a photo book.It was Carolines idea.We picked out the best snapshots of Frankie and took some more of Iowa, the farm and the sculptures, me with Laurie, Caroline with Frankie, and put them together in an album.So shell see what shes missing, Frankie said.When I asked if she got it, Mom said, Its nice, then changed the subject.Shes back with Bo, fighting with my uncle Jack, on the outs with most of the Leavitts.She told me Leavitts have no loyalty.I guess she forgot Im a Leavitt.That her daughter is, too.I just dont want her in my life anymorefor my own sake and for Frankies.I dont want her carelessness, her gusts of passion, her brief forays into thoughtfulness that leave you feeling like shit when she forgets all about you.I want Frankie to have more.Through the door, I can hear the soft sound of her crying.I stand up.Tap the door again.Frankie, look.I need you to open this door.Im going to count to ten.Thats all you get.Ready?Ten Caroline interrupts, Are you sure you dont want me to try?Nine.West?Im sure.Eight.Seven.Can I do anything?Caroline asks.Yeah.Go get me the screwdriver out of the junk drawer in the kitchen.Six.Flathead or Phillips?Five.Phillips.She rises to her toes, presses her lips against mine, and says, I love you.Four.Love you, too, baby.Three.Frankie cracks the door open on two.Her eyes are red.What do you want?To borrow your new purse.Jesus, Franks, what do you think I want?To talk to you.Let me in.Gently, I push her shoulder so shell move aside, and then I walk into her room and close the door.Theres a neat pile on her desk of everything she got for Christmas today, stacked up and organized in a kind of display that shes put on for herself.Its such a kid thing to do, such a Frankie thing, it makes me feel too much at once.Proud I could give her that stuff so she could have a good Christmas, the kind of Christmas kids are supposed to have.Pissed at whatever my mom said to ruin it.But over all that, just this pure hit of love for my girl.I sit on the unmade bed.What?she says.I didnt say anything.Youre looking at me funny.I was just thinking how much I love you, I confess.Her eyes dart away, guilty.This is how it is with us now.I keep reaching for her, but I never seem to catch her.She doesnt want me to.Whatd Mom say?I ask.Nothing.It wasnt nothing.You talked for a long time.We just talked about Christmas and presents and stuff.Shes living with Bo again.I know.She told me.She asked did I want to come home.No.The word is out of me before I know whats happening.Im standing, towering over Frankie.No fucking way.She shrinks back.I have to calm down, I know I do, but what the fucking fuck?What kind of person would do thatjust ask Frankie does she want to come home, a casual question dropped into a Christmas phone call without checking with me first, without fucking asking whether I thought it would be a good idea?Who does she think she is?That I know the answer only makes me angrier.Shes Frankies mom.Im just a fraud.Tell me what she said, I demand.Every word.Frankie eyes me skittishly.She said I could come home if I wanted.She said she misses me, and you probably I probably what?Frankie shrugs at the floor.You have Caroline.And that means what, exactly?Another shrug.You dont want me anymore.Did I say that?Did I ever fucking say that?No, but you dont have to.You hate me!I dont hate you!Youre yelling at me.Youre mad, you get mad, you never used to but you do now, and I hate you!I want to go home.I miss Mom.I miss Dad.You dont fucking miss Dad.I do, too!He loves me!Loved you, I say.Hes dead.Its nasty.Such a nasty thing to say, but he was a bastard and she wants him more than me.Its the worst thing she could say, the starkest evidence of my failure.She wants to go back to Silt, and I would rather die than go with her.I would rather die than send her.Her face crumples.I hate you!And then shes facedown on the bed, crying again.Carolines in the open doorway, saying my name.Her hand lands on my arm.I come back into my body, the aching tension, the bitter taste in my throat.I hear myself.Everything I said.Im not a good parent.Not a good person.I cant become oneI dont know how.Because Carolines wrong.Its not about parenting books, patience, trying harder.Its about me.Im short tempered and angry and violent because I was born this way, born to it.Fucking cursed from the start.Both of us.Me and Franks.When I try to touch my sister, she smacks my hand away.Leave me alone.Theres nothing I can do.West, Caroline says again.Can you sit with her?I ask.Because at least I can give Frankie that much.Someone who knows how to love her.Someone who will say the right things when I cant.Because of the snowstorm and how everything happened with Christmas, Caroline decides not to stay over at her dads even for the few nights of break shed originally planned.What she really wants, she says, is to drive down for dinner with her family and come back the same night.She wants me and Frankie to come with her.I have a feeling shes scared to leave the two of us alone.She dragged us out the day after Christmas to shop sales and spend gift cards at the mall in Des Moines.Frankie hasnt said anything more about moving home to Silt.Im trying not to think about it.Im not even angry.I just feel hollow, knowing I cant give my sister what I want her to have.Not if she wont let me.Not if I dont know how.Caroline says Im overreacting.She says my moms trouble, but we already knew that.She says Im a good father, a good man, that everybodys got flaws.Caroline points out that I raised my voice, but I didnt attack my sister physically, didnt insult her verbally, didnt bad mouth my mother, didnt hit anyone or throw anything, didnt get drunk or high or shoot anybody.This is supposed to help, I guess.Counting all the ways I didnt fuck up.It doesnt help.It makes me grateful shes willing to talk to me at all when Im such a truculent pain in the ass, but it doesnt alter my conviction that I dont have what it takes to be a parent.But Caroline gets what Caroline wants, so off we all go two days after Christmas to the Piasecki homestead.Carolines from the kind of family with a dining room, and a dining room table, and a tablecloth thats old, with a lace strip down the middle and candles and dishes that match.I get through dinner by saying either please or thank you at the end of every sentence and otherwise keeping my mouth shut.Frankie does good.Shes completely baffled by the gravy boat, and she drops cranberry sauce on her lap, but shes ten, so nobody minds.Caroline braided her hair and picked out her clothes.Shes shiny and bright in the candlelight, pretty as a picture in a book.When Caroline sits beside her sisters and her dad, I can see her face reflected in theirsher eyes from her dad, nose and chin probably her mothers legacy.Janelle is the loudest, and kind of bossy.Alisons just home from a stint in the Peace Corps.Shes thin and quiet, overwhelmed looking.Carolines dad is like a band director at the top of the table, big gestures and big hands waving around, jowls and disapproving eyebrows that would be intimidating except that when he smiles at his girls, he looks like Santa Clausall soft belly and sparkling eyes.He smiles at Frankie that way, too, so I cant make myself dislike him no matter how many suspicious looks he sends my way.Ive met him exactly twice.The first time, I did the best I could to come across as a moronic horndog.The second time, I was in jail.If it takes him a decade to warm up to me, its no worse than I deserve.Caroline doesnt like it, though.Every time he gives me some tiny measure of shit, she gives it right back to him, and the conversational temperature rises degree by degree, until the both of them are a little hot.Everywhere I look, I see something to remind me what kind of childhood Caroline had.School pictures on the wall.Framed kid drawings.A bedraggled brown paper football looking thing in the center of the table that Caroline says is supposed to be a turkey Janelle made in kindergarten.I cant get worked up about her dads disapproval because Im too busy looking around this place, thinking, This is what safe looks like.Not the size of the house.Not the neighborhood or the leather sectional sofa or the turkey on the table, but the way these people are together, familiar and affectionate, tuned in to one another, telling Frankie funny stories from when the three girls were little whose punchlines dont depend on anybody getting hurt or humiliated.I cant send my sister back to Silt.I wont.Not if theres any chance she could have this instead.After dinner, everybodys got presents to exchange, which is awkward because Frankie and I didnt have enough warning to buy anything, but theyve got stuff for us.Nice stuffa pair of leather gloves with fur in them for me, a set of birthstone earrings and a cashmere scarf for Frankie.I cant sit still through it.I end up ducking out to use the bathroom, then pass by the kitchen, where all that dirty chinas stacked up by the sink just begging to be washed.Im about halfway through the dishes when Caroline comes in, picks up a towel, and gets to work drying.You okay?she asks.Yeah.Frankie being good?Shes great.She went out with Janelle to get butter so they can make Christmas shortbread.She wasnt begging, was she?It was Janelles idea.And you know its fine if shes not perfectly polite.Everybody understands.Carolines dad comes in.He stops short when he sees us by the sink.Coffee?Caroline asks.Yeah.Ill make it, she says.You can dry the dishes.To me, she notes, Its actually his job.Im usually the one who washes.I cant get the dishes dried well enough to meet his exacting specifications.So then its me and Mr.Piasecki, side by side at the sink, and Caroline bustling around the kitchen grinding beans and measuring.When are you going back?her dad asks her.Probably in a few hours.After the shortbread, if thats okay with West.Why wouldnt it be okay?I ask.If we stay that long, Frankie will be up past her bedtime.Its fine.Shell fall asleep in the car.You could stay over, her dad says.Weve got two rooms empty upstairs even with Alison here, and that air mattress we could put up in the finished part of the basement Three rooms, Dad?Caroline asks.Really?Youre going to go with that?She hops up on the countertop next to my left elbow, putting me right in the line of fire between the two of them.Her dad glances at me.Is this how it is, West?Im not sure what you mean.Shes living with you, taking care of your sister for you, and now you wont even let her visit overnight for Christmas unless I let you share a room?No, sir, I say.Thats not how it is.Thats sure what it sounds like.I clear my throat.Try to think of some way to say it thats tactful, but fuck it.Im not tactful.Carolines in charge.I just go by whatever she wants.He looks at me for a minute.Makes this hmph kind of noise.Thats the first intelligent thing Ive heard you say.Caroline reaches across me and punches him in the shoulder, hard.Hey, he says.But its mild, and hes looking at her with affection as he rubs his arm and asks, What about what I want?Youre not the one who has to sleep in the bed, she says.Im not talking about beds anymore.Fine, then lets talk about what youre really talking aboutyoure not the one who has to live with it, Dad.I am.So Im going to make the decisions, and you get to decide whether you support them or dont, but thats the extent of it.When youre making decisions with my money, going to school on my dime, its not the extent of it.I get a say.You owe me a real conversation, not just this garbage about I support it or not but thats all.Im already living with it.I didnt get a choice on that, but weve got a choice on this lawsuit.You dont have to live with it the way I do, Caroline says.Youre not getting deposed.Youre not taking calls from the state senate and telling them, Yeah, youre right, I could help you, but I wont, because Ive got this vendetta Im in the middle of, so no.We talked about this.We knew it was going to be hard, thats just the way these things go.Its normal to get discouraged at this point in the proceedings, but when you start something, you see it throughthats what I taught you.Im not quitting, Dad.What you do is you put your finger on what you want, and then you go after it.If you think you can just give up at the first sign of trouble Im not giving up!If I were her dad, Id back the fuck off, but I guess the two of them are too much alike, because he sounds just as pissed when he replies, What do you call it, then?Halfway to trial, and youre going to walk away?We could nail this kid, Caroline!We get a judgment against him, that gives us a lien on his future salary.Well make it so he cant take a step for the rest of his life without this breathing down his neck.Make him pay.Ive been washing the same plate for a solid minute.The water is running, steam rising off it, and you could cut the tension with a knife.Caroline cuts it with one question.What if I dont want him to pay?Her dad sets down the plate he was drying and leans his hip into the counter.I might as well be invisible, standing here between them.Why wouldnt you want that?Because there isnt any justice in it, she says.Its not a scale I can balance.He puts my naked body online, sends his dogs after me, makes my life scary Makes your life hell, her father says.and I decide, Hey, then Im going to do it back to him?Thats your solution?Thats not justice.Its vengeance, and its petty.You dont understand how the system works.I do understand, she says.You raised me to understand.And what Im telling you is, the system is broken on this.I dont need Nates money for the rest of his life, I need for what Nate did to me to not be allowed anymore.I want that law on the books.I want a bunch of changes to the laws so that assholes cant post photos without consent and websites cant hide behind the Copyright Act with impunity.I want peoples attitudes to change so I dont get called a slut just because I had sex with my boyfriend and he took some pictures.I want to help make sure nobody else goes through what I didthat Frankie and girls like Frankie wont ever have to endure thatand what were doing, throwing money into a pit with this civil suit, hiding behind Jane Doethats not going to change a thing.So dont talk to me about justice unless you really want to talk to me about justice, because there are nonprofits you could give the money were paying the lawyer that would use it to bring about a lot more justice than this lawsuit that you seem to think I need your permission to walk away from.When shes finished, the whole house is quiet.The whole world feels quiet, with Carolines words just echoing around.This is what it sounds like, I think, to know exactly what you want.This is what it sounds like to thrive.Ive heard her before like this.Every time, it wrecks me, because Im so fucking proud of her.Her dad doesnt say anything.I watch him, looking for some sign that hes got pride in her, too.What he does surprises me: he sits down at the kitchen table and thinks.You can tell hes thinking because he looks so much like Caroline, his forehead furrowed and his eyes gone far away.Coffee burbles and drips into the pot.Caroline picks up the dish towel and angrily dries whats left of the dishes in the sink.At a loss, I start washing again.We finish up.Caroline puts the dishes away.I lean back against the sink with my arms crossed, trying to understand what this even is.Where Im from, men are only good for two things.We learn how to fight, and we learn how to fuck.There isnt anything much else for usno jobs you can raise a family on, no other ways to live unless you go looking for them, and even then theres no guarantee youre going to find something better.I found Evan and Rita Tomlinson.They were enough to get me out of Silt, but not enough to teach me some better way of life.Ive never watched anybody do what Caroline and her dad are in the middle of doing.Theyre arguing, but shes safe.This house where she grew up looks like a temple to me, and its not the money, its that theres love all over the walls, and good food, and Christmas presents for people they barely know, and shortbread cookies for my sister.They can do all that and still argue with each other.They can argue without fucking up their love.They raised their voices, just like I did.Lost their tempers.But then her dad sat down at the table and shut the fuck up and thought about what Caroline said to him.Hes still considering it.And I think, hell, Carolines got to be right.Shes so fucking smart, and she brought me here and had this argument right in front of me, so she has to be showing me what she thinks I need to see.Showing me how to do this.Its not impossible.Its just something I have to learn.Im good at learning, even if Im complete shit at everything else.Out of the blue, Carolines dad asks me, What do you think?About what?Nate.Id like to see him get whats coming to him.But to be honest, short of the death penalty, Im not sure theres anything that could happen to him that Id think would be as bad as what he deserves.And I figure, even before the pictures, he already screwed up and lost Caroline, so hes got a lifetime of regretting that ahead of him.Carolines giving me an oh please kind of look.What?He does.He had you, and he lost you.Stupidest move of his life.Youll be in the White House someday, and hell be telling his sad drinking buddies at the lonely bar where he wastes his time, She was mine once, but I fucked it up.I glance at Carolines dad.Sorry.For what?He said fuck, Caroline explains.He blinks.Oh.That.He waves his hand.The White House?Color climbs her cheeks.West wasnt supposed to say.Why not?Because its I can just about hear the words that come next.Childish.Stupid.Impossible.Not for me.And right then, thats when I get it.I really finally get ithow we box ourselves in.How we take something thats hard and make it harder for no good reason.When I think about what kind of life I want my sister to havewho I want her to be like, what I want her to see, what I want to model for her so shell have a clue how to flourish, to thriveI cant think of any better model than the woman I love, lecturing her dad on what justice is.Caroline is going after what she wants.Ive got to be the same way.Both of us do.Its the only way to live that makes any sense.Go after deep and make it deeper.Accept that life is going to be hardthat everything worth having is worth fighting forbut dont fucking make it harder than it has to be.Dont put yourself in between the life youve got and the one you want.I walk straight to her, pull her close, and look down into those deep brown eyes of hers.I say, Caro, its not.Whatever it is youre thinking about saying, its not true.And even if it turns out to be true down the road, if you go after it but you cant get therelet it happen when it happens.Dont write the end over the beginning.The gap between her teeth peeks out when she smiles.Ive heard that before.A smart woman said it to me.She comes up on her toes and gives me a kisschaste but full of feeling.Her dad clears his throat.She stops kissing me, but she doesnt unwind her arms from around my neck, and I dont step away from the feel of her body pressed against mine.He can fucking get used to it.All right, kids, he says.He wipes his hands down his face.Ive seen him do that once before, when he came to talk to me at the jail in Putnam.Its what he looks like, Im guessing, when hes giving in to Carolines way of doing things.Well have to draw up an ironclad settlement agreement, he says.Make sure you get assigned copyright over all those pictures, nondisclosureI guess we can let go of admission of guilt.Hell sign if he doesnt have to admit he did it.Everybody already knows he did it, she says.Everybody who counts.Shes looking at me when she says it.I hear the front door open, Frankie chattering, footsteps heading our way.She sounds happy, and it occurs to me that I gave her that.I gave her this Christmas.This family.Caroline.As far as Im concerned, everybody who counts is right here, exactly where I want them.If I have to fight to keep my sister here, I will.Late that night, I wake up to the sound of Frankie screaming.Daddy!shes saying.Bo!And then, Dont!I peel back the covers and tuck Caroline in.I walk to my sisters room and stand in the open doorway.Frankie.Frankie.Franks, its okay.After half a minute, she stops thrashing.Then I can hear her sniffling and rummaging around for the box of tissues we keep on the floor by her bed.I grab her a tissue and sit by her waist.Hand it over.Rub my hand up and down her back.Youre okay, I tell her.Youre safe.Im here.She quiets.I run my fingers through her hair.Tell me what happened, I say.Its the first time Ive asked.Maybe I didnt really want to know.Maybe I was afraid of what Id hear.Frankie draws a deep breath.I was at a sleepover.At whose house?Keishas.Wheres Keisha live?Bandon.Howd you get home?Shes quiet.Dont lie to me.Shes so quiet.I miss my chattering girl who never shut up.My Frankie from before, who ran to me when I came in a door, who hassled me for piggyback rides and never got sick of sucking up as much of my time and attention as I could spare.I left that girl to come here, and I never got her back.What Ive got now is this new Frankie, who sasses me, hassles me, ignores me, but never tells me whats in her heart.I want my sister back, and the only way I can think to get to her is to wade through all this mess between us.This story she doesnt want to tell, these changes in her life shes afraid to talk to me about, the reality she doesnt want to face: that were not ever going back to Silt.Were refugees.Tell me what really happened.I was asleep, she says.Just like that.Dad was gone, hed been gone a couple days, and I guess Bo knew that because he never came around, but he came around that night.It woke me up when Mom answered the door.I heard them talking.She let him in.Frankie sits up suddenly.She crisscrosses her legs.Her knee overlaps my thigh.They werent doing anything, she says.They were just talking.But Dad came home, and he was on something, I think.On what?I dont know.He was almost always on something.Fuck.The word comes out of me, not a curse but a prayer.Months too late to do any good.Dont let him hurt her.Dont let anything hurt her.He was talking too fast, super angry, and they were all yelling.I think Dad hit Mom, because I heard her kind of yelp, and then Bo said something and they were fighting.I hid under the covers.They were crashing around untiluntil it was too quiet.And Mom said, Wyatt, dont.The hair on the back of my neck stands up at the way she delivers those words, straight out of her nightmare.Thats when I went out there.Im clutching my knees.I want to keep her from seeing whatever shes about to see, and even though I know distantly that its happened already, it doesnt seem to matter.Dont go out there, Franks.Youre gonna get hurt.Bo was on the floor, wiping blood off his mouth.Dad had She shudders and leans into me hard.I put my arm around her.When she speaks again, her voice is high, forced.Dad had a gun.He was pointing it at Mom, right at her head.I pull her onto my lap.She twines her arms around my neck and drops her head on my shoulder, so much like the baby she used to be that I can remember viscerally the heavy, damp weight of her.Holding her, jiggling her until she was drowsy, putting her down in the middle of moms bed for a nap, and then peeling carefully away, chilled from the loss of her body heat.Her lips slack and open to any of a thousand kinds of harm.Have you told anyone this?I ask.She nods.Aunt Stephanie.And Caroline.But I didnt tell them all of it.I hold her tight.Im glad you told Caroline.You can tell her anything you need to.But now I want you to tell me.After a minute, she begins again.Mom tried to send me back in.But Dad said, No, stay, you should see this, you should see what happens to She stops.Its okay.Tell me the parts that matter.I was so scared.I wanted to be brave, like you wouldve been if you were there, but I was so scared and I didnt know what to do.I told him to put the gun away.He pointed it at me.Dont talk back to me, Francine.Mom was crying, and Bo was moving, but I wasnt paying attention with the gun on me.I was looking at Dad.And then Dad She chokes on another sob.It was so loud, West.And red, bright bright red, everywhere, and I didnt understand what was happening until Bo started apologizing.I didnt even know Bo had a gun.He shot Dad.It was my fault, because if I hadnt come out Dad wouldnt have pointed his gun at me, and Bo wouldnt have killed him, and Mom Now shes crying.Its awful, fucking awful to hear it.My baby.My Frankie.The gun went off, and she went right to Dad.She crawled on top of him like she could put him back together with her hands.I dont Frankie.I cant listen anymore.Im rocking back and forth, pressing her head into my chest, willing her to shut up with everything Ive got, because theres knowing something bad happened and then theres knowing.Theres knowing your dad, high, pointed a gun to your sisters head and might have killed her.Theres knowing your mom didnt try to save her and didnt go to her afterward.Theres knowing that, and theres pain so huge from knowing it that the pain doesnt have anyplace to go.It just ricochets around inside you, howling.I did the wrong thing, she sobs.No.I shouldve called the police.I didnt think.I tried to think what you would say to do, but I couldnt, and you werent there, West.I wasnt there.I cant change it.I tried, I fucking tried to be there for her, but I couldnt.You did great, I say.You did everything perfect.Its stupid, unhelpful, but Jesus, whats helpful?I cant make it right.I rock her, wipe her face dry, murmur nonsense until she starts to calm.We sit in her dark room.The snows falling outside.In the hush, the quiet, I remember all the worst times.The time my dad hit my new kitten with his car, studied the limp body by my side, and booted it underneath the trailer next door.The time I stood up to him and he knocked me down with a lazy fist and kicked me in the stomach so hard, I shit blood for days.The night I got arrested out of the bakery after I found out my mom had taken him back.The day I left Caroline at the airport in Des Moines.The dead zone of time after the funeral when I tried to burn my life down around me so I wouldnt have to feel anything anymore, because Id had enough.I was fucking done.Frankies worst time is worse than any of mine, and I cant fix it.All I can do is this.Its not your fault.I whisper it into her hair, behind her ear.Her head is smooth and sleek under my hand, her body small, a curve against my stomach that reminds me of that kitten on my lap, soft and warm and innocent for those few hours I had it.You didnt do anything wrong.Its them, Franks.Its them.She presses her nose into my chest, clutching my shirt.I dont want to live at Bos.You dont have to.You can stay with me.Mom says you want to be alone with Caroline.I want you with me.Youre my girl.Okay?Shes quiet.I love you, Franks.Ive loved you all your life, and Im always gonna love you.And the fact that I love Caroline, too, doesnt take anything away from you.It just means I want her with me and you with me, both.Itll always be like that.You understand?I can feel her nod against my chest.Ive been thinking since Christmas that you wanted to go back to Silt and I was gonna have to talk you out of it.I dont want to fight Mom for you, but if she tries to make you go back, then Ill fucking fight for you, because its better here.Its not perfect, I know, but I think we can get it close if we work at it.If youre miserable, though, you have to tell me so I can try to fix it.You have to tell me everything.I cant read minds.Sometimes it seems like you can.Thats because we Leavitts are fucking sharp as tacks.She turns her head to rest her temple against my shoulder.Its different here, she says.What is?Everything.Bad different or good different?Some of both.Yeah.Her hair smells like fruit.Cherries.Its that way for me, too.You think you could ever get used to it?Probably.Were quiet for a minute.Her body is loose in my arms.
