They just grabbed me and tried to get me into the back of the van.She shuddered as she relived the moment when theyd grabbed her arms, when theyd begun to force her toward the vehicle.Lucas didnt say another word as they drove back to the apartment.As he drove he checked the rearview mirror constantly and she realized he was watching to see if theyd been followed.He didnt sign up for this, Jane thought.He didnt volunteer for whatever was going on in my life.But the idea of not having him next to her terrified her.When they reached the apartment he grabbed her by the arm and walked her inside the building, his gaze seeming to go in all directions at the same time.Why dont you go and take a shower and change clothes, he said.Then well head to that restaurant and see if anyone there can identify you.The idea of leaving the safety of the apartment terrified her, but she knew she couldnt just stay here and hope that her memories might magically return.Maybe being in the familiar surroundings of the restaurant would jog something loose.She brought the shopping bags into the bedroom where shed spent the night, then carried the clean clothes and the other items into the bathroom for a quick shower.As she stood beneath the hot spray of water she thought of the moments when the men had grabbed her.Shed been so stunned that shed been unable to think, and had reacted only by fighting back.Shed kicked and punched to get away, but theyd seemed determined to get her into the back of the van.Why?Who were those men?Dont let them find you!The words thundered in her brain and she leaned against the porcelain wall as wave after wave of fear swept through her.Were those men the them that her brain had screamed a warning about?What did they want with her?Who was she?The questions pounded her as the hot water pelted her skin.What kind of trouble was she in?When she was finished showering, she dressed in the new clothes, the maternity jeans feeling crisp and clean against her skin and the blue blouse fitting her perfectly.She found Lorettas blow dryer beneath the sink and dried her hair, then brushed her teeth and pronounced herself ready for what the rest of the day might bring.She found Lucas seated at the kitchen table, doodling on a piece of paper.He looked up as she entered, and for an instant she saw the flash of something dark, something hot in his eyes.She might not know her own name, but she knew desire when she saw it.It stunned her and at the same time sent a shock wave of excitement through her.There was no question that she was attracted to him, that his lean, dark good looks made her heart beat just a tiny bit faster.But shed attempted to shove away those crazy feelings.She was carrying somebodys baby, and for all she knew she was in a happy, committed relationship with another man.You look nice, he said.She wrapped her arms around her stomach.I look pregnant, she replied, as if somehow reminding herself and him of that fact.A corner of his mouth curled up in a smile.You can look pregnant and nice at the same time.Thank you, she said, aware of the flush that warmed her cheeks.She sat at the table across from him.What are you doing?Unfortunately I didnt get a good look at the two men who were trying to grab you, and I didnt get the license plate of the van, but I did notice a sign in the back window.A sign?What did it say?It didnt say anything.It was a symbol of some kind.I tried to draw it to see if maybe youd seen it before.He shoved a piece of paper to her.She stared down at what hed drawna triangle with what looked like the all seeing eye in the center.The sight of it shot a cold, stark terror through her.She gasped and pushed it back across the table to him.He leaned forward and covered her hand with his.Do you recognize it?What is it, Jane?What does it mean?I dont know.She felt ill, as if the cold November air had brought icy snow into her veins.All I know is that seeing it makes me feel sick.It makes me so afraid.She turned her hand over and twined her fingers with his, needing the warmth of his hand to banish some of the chill.What does it mean, Lucas?My God, what was going on in my life before I lost my memories?I dont know.But those men definitely had something in mind for you.The throb of that muscle was back in his jaw.Reluctantly Jane pulled her hand away from his.Her heart thudded anxiously as she looked at the man who had taken her in.Lucas, maybe you should just drop me off at a shelter or something.The words came reluctantly and with a thunderous pounding in her head.I dont know what kind of danger I might bring to you and Loretta.His eyes narrowed.Danger has never scared me.He leaned back in the chair.Theres no way anyone can tie you to me.Im not concerned about danger finding you here.And theres no way in hell Im going to drop you off anywhere until we know whats going on.I dont think those men intended to take you someplace for a nice hot cup of tea.A river of gratitude washed over her.It would have been so easy for him to abdicate all responsibility for her and toss her to the proverbial wolves.She cradled her stomach as the baby moved inside her.Junior is restless, she said.Maybe hes hungry.Lucas pushed back from the table and stood.Come on, lets check out that Italian restaurant.Maybe over bread sticks well learn your real name.They put their coats back on, then left Lorettas apartment.We need to stop by my place before leaving, he said.When they reached his door he unlocked it and gestured her inside.Ill be right back, he said, and disappeared down the hallway while Jane looked around the living room with interest.It somehow didnt surprise her that his living conditions were spartan and as impersonal as a motel room.Hed been completely at ease in Lorettas apartment.She had a feeling he spent most of his free time there.There was only one photo in the room and it sat on top of the television in a silver frame.She walked over and picked it up.It was a picture of him and Loretta sitting on a park bench.He looked to be around fifteen and she was nine or ten.She leaned into him, smiling up at him as if he were the greatest thing since sliced bread, but his smile looked slightly forced.She set the photo down as he returned to the living room.You and Loretta have always been close?Its always been her and me against the world, he replied.What about your parents?Are they still alive?No, theyre both dead.But even when they were alive, Loretta and I only had each other.She wanted to ask him more about the dark shadow that had danced over his eyes when hed mentioned his parents.But his terse tone and frown forbade her from asking anything else.They left his apartment and walked back out into the cold, wintry air.She got into his passenger seat and watched as he walked around the front of the car to the driver side.As he moved, his coat blew open to reveal that he now wore a holster with a gun.Janes mouth went dry.Shed known she was in trouble when those men had tried to grab her, but the sight of that gun suddenly shot it all home.He was expecting more trouble.Thats what the gun meant.She only hoped they both would survive whatever happened next.Pregnesia Chapter FourThe Caf Italian was a popular lunch place.They had a reasonably priced luncheon menu and promised fast service for those who only had an hour or so to eat before returning back to work.Lucas and Jane were greeted at the door by a smiling, robust man who looked as if hed been eating pasta and garlic bread for most of his life.Two?he asked as he grabbed a couple of menus.Lucas nodded and they were led to a table in the back, where Lucas sat facing the door so he could see who was coming and going.Jane took off her oversize jacket and sat across from him.Have you been working here long?Lucas asked the man as he handed them their menus.Just started a couple of weeks ago, he replied.Why?Do you recognize me?Jane asked.Lucas heard the desperation in her voice and wondered how she was managing to hold it all together.Certainly after the scene at the store she had every right to fall apart, but she hadnt and shed earned a grudging admiration from him.Should I recognize you?the man asked as he studied her face carefully.Are you somebody famous?No, nothing like that, she replied.I justIm having some memory problems and I remember being in here and hoped somebody would be able to tell me when.Sorry.Im pretty good with faces, but I dont remember seeing yours before, he replied.Ill ask the waitresses if any of them recognize you.Thanks, Id appreciate it, she replied.As he left their table, she looked at Lucas with a disheartening frown.I thought Id just walk in here and everything would come back to me.Do you remember anything?She leaned back in her chair and looked around.Lucas had known the blue blouse would match her eyes, but he hadnt thought about how it might make her skin look creamy and touchable.He hadnt considered that with the top buttons unfastened hed get a hint of cleavage each time she bent forward.I dont remember anything specific, but this place feels familiar.I know for sure that Ive been here before.I just dont know if it was a week ago, a year ago or five years ago.She puffed a sigh of obvious frustration.What if I never remember who I am or why those men tried to grab me?Its only been a day, Jane.Maybe youre trying too hard, he replied.She smiled.Having a couple of goons try to grab you in a parking lot tends to make you try hard.She sighed once again and opened her menu.The eggplant is delicious here.Her gaze shot to his in stunned surprise.How did I know that?Why can I remember eggplant when I cant remember my own name?She was getting more and more agitated with each minute that passed.Lucas frowned.I think maybe after we eat well go back to my place and just relax for the rest of the afternoon.Stop reaching for it and maybe it will come.Maybe youre right, she agreed as she closed her menu.With each minute Lucas spent with her, more questions whirled in his head.What did that symbol mean that hed seen on the back of the van?Why had Jane reacted so viscerally to it?And why had those men tried to grab her?What could they possibly want from her?It sure as hell hadnt been a robbery attempt.She wasnt even carrying a purse.If the cashier had taken one more minute in loading up his purchases, if hed stopped to look at something on his way out of the store, then they would probably have succeeded in getting her into the back of the van.The thought chilled him to the bone.His thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of the waitress to their table.Jane ordered the eggplant and he ordered lasagna.Then Jane asked the woman if shed seen her in the restaurant before.You look kind of familiar, she said.Im sure youve been in here before, but I dont know your name or anything.We knew this was probably a long shot, Lucas said as the waitress left with their orders.I know.I just hoped that wed at least get a first name.She tucked a strand of shiny hair behind her ear.So, talk to me about something else, Lucas.Tell me more about yourself.She smiled.The good thing about being with a woman who has amnesia is that the conversation gets to be all about you.He laughed, finding her more than a little bit enchanting.There isnt much to tell.Im thirty three years old, never been married, never intend to get married.I love my work, my sister and my partners and thats about it.Why dont you have any intention of marrying?she asked.Because Id probably be a crummy husband and an even crummier father.He was intimately familiar with bad relationships and bore the scars of horrible parenting.Thats what he knew.By staying single, by never becoming a husband or a father, he would never run the risk of repeating the mistakes his parents made.I dont think youd be crummy at either, she said.But she really knew nothing about him.Im just better off alone.He shrugged, slightly uncomfortable by the conversation.Im happy that way.I know it sounds crazy, especially given this little circumstance.She patted her tummy.But I feel like I was alone before all this.Her cheeks flushed a becoming pink.I dont know, maybe the man who got me pregnant decided he didnt want anything more to do with me or the baby.She picked up her water glass and took a sip, then continued.Its just a crazy feeling I have.Maybe you feel that way because of the circumstances, he replied.Maybe you have a loving husband somewhere waiting, worrying about you right now.She looked down at her hands.She had slender fingers with neatly clipped nails and wore no polish.Im not wearing a ring.Im not sure how to explain it, but I just know in my heart that Im not married.He didnt know what to think.Certainly just because she was pregnant he couldnt automatically assume that she was married.Maybe deep down inside he hoped she was.He hoped she had a loving man in her life who was worried sick about her, a man who loved her to distraction and couldnt wait for the birth of their baby.Although hed known her less than twenty four hours, he wanted that for her.And maybe he needed to believe that in order to erect a barrier between them.There was no question that he was attracted to her.More attracted than he could remember being to a woman in a very long time.As the waitress arrived to serve them, he tried not to think about that attraction.He told himself it was nothing more than the way she looked at him, as if he could fix her life, as if she trusted him to make things right.Loretta was the only other woman who had ever looked at him like that.He was as temporary in her life as her amnesia and he hoped that within another twenty four hours shed have her memories back and be out of his life.Lunch passed uneventfully.They chatted about the food and she asked him questions about his partners, Micah and Troy.He told her about how Micah had found love with Caylee when hed gone to a private island to retrieve an airplane.And Troy fell in love with a California paparazzi favorite, Brianna Waverly, while protecting her during a kidnapping.Brianna now ran an animal shelter not far from the Recovery Inc.office, and Lucas had a feeling it wouldnt be long before theyd begin planning a wedding.When we get back home Ill check in with Troy and Micah and see if they can hunt down some information about that symbol I saw in the van window, he said.Her face paled.Seeing it gave me a terrible feeling, she said, her voice higher than usual with obvious stress.Maybe if we can figure out what it means, then well have a clue to your identity.So you do believe me?You dont think Im faking?Those blue eyes of hers held his gaze intently.A man could drown in those blue depths, he thought.Maybe it was because she had no past, no baggage, that her eyes were so clear, so achingly blue.Yeah, I believe you.It was true.At some point after those men had tried to grab her at the store, hed realized she wasnt pretending.Hed seen the stark terror on her face coupled with utter confusion.Nobody was that good an actress.Im so glad, she replied.It was important to me that you believe me.Why?She looked at him in surprise.Because youre helping me.Because you and your sister have already gone above and beyond for me.I dont want you to think that Im the kind of woman to lie and take advantage of you.He might not think she was a woman who would take advantage of him, but he had a feeling she was definitely the kind of woman who could get him into trouble if he wasnt careful.BY THE TIME THEY GOT BACK to Lorettas apartment Jane was exhausted.Why dont you go lie down for a little while, Lucas suggested.You look beat.I am, she agreed.While youre resting Im going to call my partners and see what they can find out about that symbol.Im friendly with the chief of police, Wendall Kincaid.Ill give him a call and see if anyone has filed a missing persons report about a pregnant woman.She frowned.But you wont tell the police about me?He hesitated and she took a step closer to him.Lucas, I dont think Im a criminal and I have no rational reason for my fear, but the idea of going to the police makes me as afraid as the sight of that symbol did.I know eventually if I dont remember who I am well probably have to go to the police.But please, not yet?Dont worry, he assured her.Im not going to go against your wishes right now.I can ask Wendall some questions, and if he asks why I want to know, I can tell him that I have an issue Im not ready to tell him about right now.Hell respect that.But if this amnesia continues, then youre right, we might have no choice but to go to the police.Go on, get some rest.With a nod, she turned and walked down the hallway to the bedroom where shed slept the night before.She couldnt imagine actually going to sleep, not with the questions whirling around in her head.Once again she found herself wondering what might have happened to her if Lucas hadnt found her in the car.He was like a guardian angel come to her when she needed somebody.But was it normal to feel a rivulet of heat when a guardian angel looked at you?Was it normal to wonder what his mouth might feel like pressed against your own?Hormones, she thought as she stretched out on her back on the bed.Her hormones were definitely running amok and that was the only reason for her crazy physical attraction toward Lucas.She rubbed her stomach as she felt the baby moving inside her.Who was the father?What had happened that had sent her out into the cold in the middle of the night with a head wound?Maybe Lucas was right.Maybe she was trying too hard to remember, and her efforts were stifling the very memories she was trying so hard to retrieve.She closed her eyes and consciously willed away all thoughts of the moment when the two men had grabbed her arms and tried to get her into the back of the van.She drew in deep breaths and tried to empty her mind of all thought.SYMBOLS.They were everywhere.The triangle with the eye inside it.The all seeing eye.The all knowing mind.Her heart crashed inside her chest as she ran down a long, dark hallway, needing to escape from itfrom them.Footsteps sounded behind her and she pressed her back into an alcove, praying theyd move on, that she wouldnt be found.She breathed a sigh of relief as the sound of the footsteps faded away.Run!Her brain screamed the command.Get out!Once again she began to move silently down the hallway, hoping shed come to a door that would allow her to escape.She turned into another corridor and stopped, her blood cold as she saw him standing at the end.Even though the hall was too dark for her to see his features, she knew who he wasthe all knowing mind.SHE SCREAMED as hands gripped her by the shoulders and she opened her eyes to see Lucas.The dream fell away, but not the horror of it.She gasped as a sob escaped her lips.Hey, youre okay, he said as he sat on the edge of the bed.You were just having a bad dream.Cold.She was cold with terror and she didnt think twice about launching herself into his arms as another sob ripped out of her.He stiffened as she pressed against him and hid her face in his chest.Then he did exactly what she needed; he folded his arms around her and held her.In the warmth of the embrace, in the strength of his arms, any tears shed been able to shed vanished.A dream.It had just been a dream.Or had it?You okay?His voice was a rumble in her ear as she kept her head against his broad chest.Although she found his embrace amazingly welcome, she knew she couldnt stay in his arms forever.Reluctantly she sat up and moved away from him.You want to talk about it?he asked.She wrapped her arms around her shoulders, the cold wind of fear finding her once again.It was crazy.There were those symbols everywhere and I was in a dark hallway, trying to escape.Escape from what?Lucass dark eyes watched her intently.She frowned, trying to make sense of the images that shed dreamed.I dont know.It didnt make sense.I just knew that I had to get away and then I turned a corner and there was a man standing at the end of the hall and I knew I couldnt get away.A shudder worked through her.Was it a dream or was it a memory?Jane held his gaze.It would be easy to get lost in those black lashed dark eyes of his.At the moment shed like nothing more than to get lost in him, to escape the uncertainty of the unknown, to feel safe and secure in his arms.She shook herself.Im not sure.I dont know, she finally replied.But if it was a memory, then what could it mean?I mean, why would I feel as if I was a prisoner trying to escape something awful?Lucas ran a hand through his hair.I dont know.Maybe it was some kind of symbolism.Maybe what you were trying to escape was your amnesia.Maybe, she said grudgingly, although she wasnt sure what to believe.How long was I asleep?He looked at his wristwatch.About an hour or so.He got up from the edge of the bed.Look, Ive got some things to do.You should be fine here until Loretta gets home.She should be here by four.She didnt want him to leave.The idea of being alone terrified her, but she swallowed the fear and nodded.Please, take care of your business.Ill be fine.She offered him a smile that she hoped didnt look as forced as it felt.Ill check in with you later this evening.As he left the room, Jane felt an overwhelming need to tell him that she didnt want to be by herself, but she didnt.Shed intruded into his life in a very big way and the very least she could do was not be a clinging vine to a man who owed her nothing just because she was overwhelmed with fear.Fear.She slid her legs over the side of the bed and drew a deep breath.She had to get control of her fear.There were a million things she didnt know about herself, about her life, but she needed to focus on what she did know.She and the baby were healthy, and at the moment she was in a safe place.Maybe after another good nights sleep her memory would return.Maybe during dinner tonight shed have a sudden epiphany and all her memories would just come tumbling back.Instead of feeling sorry for herself or afraid, maybe she needed to get her mind on something else.With this thought in mind she headed for the kitchen.Maybe she could do something nice for Loretta and cook dinner.Looking in the refrigerator, she spied a pound of thawed hamburger meat.Maybe a meat loaf, she thought.Within minutes shed gathered all the ingredients she needed to make the dish and set to work.Funny, she had a feeling she made a great meat loaf, and adding the appropriate amount of bread crumbs and seasonings came to her without thought.Shed just popped it into the oven when she heard the sound of the front door open.Hello?Loretta called out.Im in the kitchen, Jane replied.As Loretta came into the room, Jane felt a touch of shyness.Shed hardly spoken to the woman the night before and hadnt seen her that morning.You look much better than you did last night, Loretta said with a warm smile that instantly put Jane at ease.Maybe on the outside, but unfortunately nothing has changed on the inside, Jane replied.Still dont remember anything?Loretta asked as she sat in one of the kitchen chairs and kicked off her blue clogs.Nothing.I hope you dont mind that Im still here.I took the liberty of making a meat loaf for dinner.Mind?If you cook for me every night I might just think about marrying you, Loretta exclaimed with a laugh.Jane relaxed and joined her at the table.I dont want to take advantage of your kindness.Im hoping maybe after another good nights sleep things will become clear.Dont worry about taking advantage.Whats important is that you give yourself some time to get your memory back.Wheres my brother?He said he needed to take care of some business and left about an hour ago.He said hed check back in sometime this evening.Hes been very kind to me.Loretta smiled.He can be a bit hard and crusty on the outside, but hes a good man.She frowned and looked as if she wanted to say something more, but instead she stood.
