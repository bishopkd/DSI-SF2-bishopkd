Thats ...gross.Cam wasnt sure what else to say about it.She laughed softly again.Yeah, it was pretty gross.So I took off my clothes and I threw this T shirt on and I walked out and thats when I saw Marcus.And he just stared at me, and then back into the room where the guy was passed out.And it looked bad.Of course it did.And he said, Ruiz is gonna dump your ass when he hears about this.She turned to him then, with a knee on the bed.Her hazel eyes were wide, searching his.And at the time, I was upset about my dad.And I was drunk.And I was eighteen fucking years old and my first thought was that that was how I could get you to stay in school.Id let you think I cheated on you.Cams breath caught in his throat.His chest felt tight, like he couldnt get enough air, and he fisted his shirt over his heart.No, Tate, you didnt.She started crying then, softly.I let Marcus run his mouth.And I didnt deny it.And then ...when I was sober, it was too late to stop the rumor mill.And Dad was getting sicker and I thought, This is for the best.She leaned closer as the tears tracked down her cheeks.This was the only way I could think to get you out of Paradise.Youre smart and amazing and you deserve all the good things in life.I didnt want you back here with me in a dead end job, taking care of my father.I didnt want that for you.And then anger rose up, swift and sudden.He grabbed her shoulders and shook her.How could you do that?How could you make that decision for both of us?She sobbed harder, collapsing against his chest as his hands slipped from her shoulders and his arms pressed her to him.That was so fucking stupid, Tatum.So fucking stupid.I know.The wetness from her tears seeped into his shirt.So fucking stupid.She leaned back then, and he gripped her biceps as she brushed the tears from her cheeks.I thought, or at least I convinced myself that what we had wasnt special, she said, those eyes boring into him, daring him to look away.He didnt know where this was going.Special?She bit her tongue between her teeth, then released it.We were so young, Cam.I thought ...I thought everyone loved like us.That strongly.That intensely.With everything they have.She looked away then, her eyes blinking rapidly and her lips trembling.He waited, unwilling to slice into this moment, because the truth hung in a precarious vapor between them.She faced him again, eyes wet but more composed.But now I know better.Boy, do I ever know better.If I had known what we had was so rare, I never would have let you go.And then that truth wrapped around them, securing them in a protective bubble, so all Cam could do was stamp this moment to make it real and true.He pressed his lips to hers, and she sighed and shuddered beneath his hands.He nudged up with his chin and she knew what that meant, opening her mouth so he could delve inside.That first taste of Tate was everything.Hot summers in the backseats of cars and licking drips of ice cream off her wrists and true, first real love.Shed been everything to him.And now that he tasted her again, he knew that had never changed.She allowed him to lick at her mouth and duel with her tongue.And she pressed into him, those full breasts rubbing against his damp shirt.He pulled her into his lap so her legs straddled his hips.She gripped his shoulders and rocked her body into him, her lips parted, her eyes now full of need.For him.CAMS EYES WERE big and dark, his full lips begging her to taste them again.She never thought shed be here in his lap.She never thought shed get to see Cam like this again.She gripped tighter with her knees.Please, Cam ...Please what?His voice was pure gravel.She moaned, because he was torturing her.She scooted closer, until she felt his arousal snugged up where she wanted it most.Tell me, Tate.Tell me what you want, and Ill give it to you.Make me come, she whispered.His answer was a hissed yes and her eyes closed under the weight of her desire for him.Thered been so many times, late at night, under the protection of darkness and her twisted sheets when shed imagined Cams fingers, while her own had been a poor substitute.But now ...now this was better than she remembered and better that shed dreamed of.Because this was an older, more mature Cam.A Cam with experience that she didnt want to think about.All she knew, as his hand slid into her underwear and cupped her, was that she was benefiting from this experience.Because she shamelessly rode his fingers as they slid through her wetness and inside her.She moaned as he whispered into her ear that he missed her, that she was beautiful.He pressed harder inside, searching for that spot hed always known, and she whimpered, bucking her hips.The heel of his palm pressed against her clit as he twisted his wrist.Why?he whispered against her neck, his lips burning into her skin.Why what?She dug her fingers into his shoulder and kept her rhythm, searching for it because she was so close ...Why would you throw this away?When everything about you and me is so right?She turned her head and kissed his jaw, the stubble rasping over her lips.Please, she begged, her voice hoarse.His hand stilled and he pulsed the heel of his hand once.Tell me this is right.Tell me were special, that well never have this with anyone else.Her voice broke on a sob.Were special.This is right.Its always been you, Cam.Its always been us.And then his fingers pressed and twisted, and she was flying.There was a deep voice murmuring to her and another high voice gasping in pleasure, but Tate heard everything in echo.Because her focus was on that feeling in her belly, the warmth that spread out to every limb until even the tips of her toes and fingers tingled.Cam talked to her through it, cupping the back of her head while her face was pressed into his neck so all she smelled was him, all she felt was his hands and his very presence surrounded her.When she came back into her body, she couldnt feel her legs and her eyelids drooped.Cams fingers were still inside her, and he drew them out slowly.She winced and shuddered as they slipped over her sensitive skin.If only she could just sleep, right here, in Cams lap.That was fucking beautiful, he said against her ear, his teeth catching an earlobe, and her eyes popped open.She smiled against his neck and reached down between them, feeling for what she hoped was still an alive and eager erection.Her grin widened when her hands closed around his hard shaft through his shorts.He hissed when she stroked him.Even though her legs were jelly, she managed to slide to the floor without falling on her ass.And she watched his face as she slowly undid the button and zip fly of his shorts.He leaned back, bracing his weight on his arms on the bed, his face flushed, his eyelids lowered, lashes brushing his cheeks when he blinked.And then she lowered the waistband of his boxers under his balls, so he was fully exposed in front of her.She touched the tip of his cock where it had leaked a little and then brought her finger to her mouth.Fuck, Tate.She gripped him and stroked up once, twisting at the top like she knew he liked it, muscle memory kicking in.Who knew a hand job was like riding a bike?Tate ...His voice was strained.She stuck out her tongue and licked once, right under the head.Then she leaned back on her heels with a wicked smile and stroked again.Tell me.Tell me this is right.His chest heaved.You tease.Paybacks a bitch.His eyes narrowed and his nostrils flared.He breathed once, twice.And then his face softened.He leaned onto one hand and reached out with the other.He ran his fingers over her cheekbone, through the ends of her hair, and then cupped her chin.Its always been you, Tate.Its always been us.The sincerity in his voice cracked her heart wide open, and she parted her lips to suck him in.He kept his hand on her chin, his thumb on the corner of her lips, where he glided in and out and of her mouth.His breath came out in gasps as she gripped the base and pumped with the same motion as her mouth.Her other hand reach down and rolled his balls, making him hiss out, Fuck, baby.When his legs began to tremble against her shoulders, she knew she had him and she kept up her rhythm.His hand slid down her neck to her shoulder and he squeezed with his fingers.Im gonna come.She glanced up, met his eyes, and then he threw back his head on a gasp and came.Itd been a long time since shed had a dick in her mouth, but apparently blow jobs were like riding a bike, too, because she easily swallowed all he had to give her.When she felt the last of his orgasm pulse, she let him slip out of her mouth and then she rested her head on his thigh.Hed collapsed onto the bed on his back, his chest rising and falling as he took in gulps of air.His hand ghosted over her hair, like he wanted her to know he was still here, in the moment.He was still with her.Then his fingers twisted in a lock of hair.Come up here.She rose to her feet with a groan and crawled on top of him.He shifted them so they were lying lengthwise on her bed, her head on his chest.His hand slipped under her shirt and his fingers played with the knobs in her spine.His other hand was behind his head, elbow cocked, which made his shirt rise.So she ran her fingers through the trail of hair leading down into the waistband of his boxers, which hed pulled up.Im sorry about what I said.About Marcus.She sighed.Its okay.Hes a source of a lot of regret for me.And that night at the bar ...God, we were dumb.His chuckle shook her head where it rested on his chest.So dumb.You were totally flirting with that Kara girl, though.Only because you were flirting with Marcus.She bit her lip.I wanted to be flirting with you.He laughed again.Well, so much for only being friends.She caressed his skin with her fingers.I like this better.The feel of his firm muscles beneath her head, the beat of his heart, his smell, was like slipping back into her skin.I want to be mad at you.His words were a contradiction to the soft kiss he placed on top of her head.Its okay, Im mad at me, too.She flattened her hand against his stomach, marveling at the changes in his body.From the boy shed once known to the man he was now.I said I want to be.Not that I am.Tate gathered her hands under her and lifted off the bed.Cam tugged to get her to stay lying down, but she smiled.Hold on.I have to do something.He turned on his side and propped his head on his hand as she sat cross legged on front of her TV.She looked back and saw he watched her with dark eyes.She pulled up Utope and went into their saved game.And then she arranged Avatar Cam and Avatar Tate in bed.She had them copulate with protection, which used to always make them laugh.She turned around and Cam watched her with a smile on her face.She smiled back.And then she pulled up the speech bubble and Tates avatar said, Im sorry.Tate paused until she felt Cam behind her.He grabbed the controller and sank down behind her, his legs on either side of her body, and leaned her back onto his chest.She melted into him.And smiled as he pulled up the speech bubble on his character.Im sorry I didnt fight for us.She grabbed the controller back.Tates avatar said, I love you.Cams avatar said, I love you, too.Always.And then a kiss was pressed into her temple.On the screen and in real life.I want to hate eighteen year old Tate, she said.But if she hadnt made that dumb decision, I wonder if wed be here today.If wed realize how important this is.What we have.Strong arms circled her.Eighteen year old Tate did something pretty dumb.But, as clich as it sounds, it happened for a reason, I guess.She ran her hands down his arm and linked their fingers.We still have a lot to figure out.I know, he said.But thats for another day.12      LATER THAT NIGHT, they sat cross legged on the bed, an almost empty pizza box between them.Shed thrown on a T shirt and a pair of underwear and he wore his boxer briefs.Tate checked her phone and growled under her breath when she saw Jamie hadnt returned her calls or texts.Shed called his friends (who didnt know where he was) and obtained his girlfriends number from them and called her (who didnt answer her phone).At this point, Tate was out of options other than getting in her car and tracking him down herself.Which Cam had agreed would be a waste of time.I cant tell you the last time I had Hawaiian pizza.Cam swallowed a bite.Really?Tate picked off a piece of bacon and dropped it in her mouth.Only one place at Bowler had it.Tried it freshman year and it sucked.Tate smiled.Guess thats one reason to stay in ParadiseGeorginas Hawaiian pizza.He reached over and grabbed her hand.Hey, thats not the only reason.His thumb rubbed circles on her wrist, and she shuddered at the touch.You werent saying that a couple of weeks ago.He shoved the pizza box to the side and tugged her toward him.She crawled into his lap and he wrapped his arms around her, kissing the top of her head.A gesture hed always done.She wasnt sure if he realized he used to do it, or that he was doing it again, but it all added up to her finally feeling like she was where she belonged.I might not have wanted to come home, but Im here now.And Im glad Im here.She ran her hands over his thighs, over a groove in the muscles of his quads.What about the fall?His chin rubbed along the top of her head.What about it?She turned around so she could see his face, because this was an important conversation.She didnt want him to get by with evasion.He spread his legs and she sat between them cross legged.You know what I mean.He let his head fall back and he stared up at her ceiling.A heavy weight settled in her gut.This was what shed been avoiding four years ago.This decision.Would Cam choose his future or her?He lowered his head to look at her, then bent his legs, resting his wrists on his knees, caging her in.I dont know yet.But its a good job, right?His lips scrunched to the side and after a pause, he said, Yes, it is.So you should take it.His brows lowered.You think Im going to start something up with you and then disappear?She flopped her arms out to the side, then gripped his ankles hear her hips.I dont know!Its not like we planned this.One minute, Jamie and I were fighting, then we were fighting, then your hand was down my pants.I think everyone would be much happier if all fights ended like that.Cam, she growled.He leaned forward and tangled a hand in her hair, curling his fingers around the back of her neck.Stop, youre overthinking everything.I dont have to take the job.I can find something else.Like reenlist in the guard or sign up for active duty.Oh God, no no no no.She knew his dreams, and they were never to be in the military full time.He planned to serve in the guard for four years, get his college paid for, and get out.Did he think she wouldnt remember?She shook her head slowly, then gained speed until her hair was flying around her face.I cant ...I cant handle that.You always said youd never get deployed.And you havent.But if you did, I couldnt handle that ...I just ...no.His fingers tightened.Tate  That was never what you wanted, she whispered.His shoulders lowered and his eyes softened.Plans change, Tatum.She searched for what to say, to make him understand.Shed suffered four years and for what?So he stayed home anyway?Signed up to the service of his country for another four years?I  And then whatever she had planned to say went out the window when she heard the ringtone for her brother.Jamie!she yelled, completely unnecessarily, launching herself out of Cams lap and scrambling across the bed to where her phone was chirping and vibrating on her nightstand.She picked up her phone, swiping her hand over the screen to answer.Jamie?There was no answer, just deep voices in the background.Tates stomach dipped.Jamie?More deep voices, then, in a broken voice that shattered her heart, she heard, Tate?She shot up to sitting position.Jamie?Whats going on?Where are you?Are you okay?She registered Cam moving behind her, pulling on his clothes, and gathering hers and laying them in her lap.Tate, Jamie said.I ...I need you to come pick me up.More deep voices, then ...a siren?Shuffling over the speaker.Jamie?Canmuffled voicepick me up?Jamie, of course I can pick you up, but where the hell are you?pital.What?She jerked onto her knees and pressed the phone harder onto her ear.Youre at the hospital?Cars probably totaled.Totaled?What?Why?Her voice sounded shrill in her ears.Can you stop yelling?Jamies voice gained strength.Then tell me whats going on!Tate hollered into the phone.The phone was no longer in her hand.Cam had it, and he was speaking into it in low tones while she stared at him, frozen.Then he was off the phone and helping her into her clothes, fixing her hair, kissing her forehead.He led her out to his truck and helped her in the passenger seat.As he started the car, she said, I should have called more friends or something.I should have tracked him down.Hes okay, Tate.But  Hes banged up a little and from what it sounded like, his cars a wreck.But hes alive and hes okay.She stopped talking then, until they got to the hospital.Cam dropped her off at the entrance to the emergency room and she rushed in.Jamie was already being seen, so she sat in a cold metal chair, jiggling her leg and chewing on a thumbnail.When Cam strolled in, he sat beside her and put his arm around her shoulders.Hes being seen already?Tate glanced around the sparsely populated waiting room.Yep.He patted her shoulder in reply.Did he say what was wrong?Why he had to be here?It was hard to hear him on the phone, but something about his wrist.She bent her head and rubbed her hands on her jeans.He needed that car and that job.Damn it.We needed that paycheck.He moved his hand to cup the side of her head and laid it on his shoulder.Well figure something out.There was that we again.Like they were a team.A family.And she was letting it happen, like it was no big thing to believe that Cam would be around forever.But it was hard.Because that big job in New York beckoned and how could he stay in this town with her?And she couldnt leave with him.Not when her dad was sick and Jamie was a mess.She was needed here.And the sooner she remembered that she was better off not relying on someone else, the better.But Cams fingers rubbed soothing circles on her scalp.And his shoulder warmed her cheek.And he smelled good.And maybe she could enjoy this now, while it lasted.As long as she kept in mind there was an expiration date.They sat in silence, Cams fingers doing their magic.And Tate wondered if she could fall asleep here.But then a throat cleared, and she raised her head.Jamie stood before them, his face dark, a cast on his left wrist.His clothes were wrinkled and his shoes untied.He looked like shit.But damn, was she glad to see him in one piece.She stood up and walked to him, throwing her arms around his stiff form.Im so glad youre okay.She felt fingers flutter over her hips, but his arms didnt return her embrace.And when she stepped back, Jamies eyes were over her head, his glare fixed on Cam.What are you doing here?I think you dont need to worry about that.I gave your sister a ride.She cant fucking drive herself now?Watch your mouth.Dont tell me what to do.Cams jaw clenched, and Tate figured this was when she needed to step in.Look, you two can argue all you want when we get home.Can we please leave the hospital?Jamie grunted and turned on his heel, walking out of the doors of the emergency room with a slight limp.Tate trotted to his side.Whats wrong with your leg?Just twisted my ankle a little.Its fine.She motioned to Jamie toward where Cams truck was parked in the visitor parking garage.She glanced over her shoulder at Cam, who was walking behind them, staring holes in the back of Jamies head.She turned again to face her brother.What happened?He shrugged jerkily.Took a corner too tight.Hit a tree.She gasped.Jesus.You hit a tree?It wasnt a big tree.I dont really care how big the tree was.Jamie fell silent and he asked the question she was dreading.Hows the car?Another shrug.The front is kinda in a V shape, what do you think?She narrowed her eyes.I dont think its funny.Im not laughing, he shot back.How did you wreck?Took a corner too fast, car slid.I overcorrected and the tree got in my way.Again, not funny.Again, not laughing.Tate stopped asking questions.The car ride was tense.Jamie sat in the cab of the truck behind Tate and Cam.Tate could feel the waves of frustration rolling off him and she turned the air conditioner up full blast.Shed planned to corner Jamie tomorrow, talk to him and find out what was going on.But then this thing had happened with Cam and this accident and all she wanted to do was crawl under her covers and stay there for days.But she couldnt.Because no matter what, Jamie needed her.And no matter how much of a teenage dickhead he was being, she loved him.She turned around in her seat.Your wrist hurt?He stared at her like she was an idiot, and held up his injured hand.Its in a cast.I know that, I  And there are these pills you can take to help with pain  If you cant carry on a civil conversation, Jamie, then dont fucking talk at all, Cam growled from the front seat.And that was the end of any sort of talking until they pulled into the driveway of their house.Tate was grateful that her father wasnt home to see this.She didnt want him to have to deal with Jamies mess.As soon as they walked into the house, Cam whirled on Jamie.He grabbed his chin and leaned in, checking his eyes.Are you drunk?Jamie jerked his head back to get out of Cams grip, but Cam held firm.No, Jamie said through clenched teeth.High?Jamie jerked back again and this time, Cam dropped his hand.No, Jamie spat at him.Cops already checked that shit after the accident, but thanks for implying Im a loser.Cam held out his palms and responded with a voice dripping with sarcasm.Oh, hey, Im sorry.Must have been some other brother of Tates sitting drunk in a yard recently.My bad.Jamie Tate started, but when his brothers head whipped to her, she snapped her jaw shut.Thanks for picking me up, but if you think Im going to stand here and get ganged up on by you two, then youre wrong.Neither of you have your shit together any more than I do.Why dont you can the angry teenager act?For fucks sake, Jamie, Cam said.Whats going on?said a voice, and all three of them turned their heads to see Tates father standing at the entrance of the hallway.Dad?Tate took a step toward him.What are you doing here?I thought you were spending the night?He waved his hand.Turns out they didnt need to keep me.I called Anne and she came to get me.Why did you call Anne?I could have  Frankly Im much more concerned about what I just overheard.He took several steps forward, his eyes shifting from Tate to Jamie.Because I heard something about drinking and an accident.And Id really like to know why this is the first Im hearing about any of it.Tates heart plummeted into her stomach.Maybe you should sit down, Dad.I can get your oxygen tank and  Tatum Frances Ellison.Her dads voice had deepened into a low growl.You and your brother take a seat on that couch over there, and I better start hearing some explanations.Tate slumped her shoulders and trudged to the couch, footsteps behind her.She flopped down in a corner of the couch and watched as her brother sat in the opposite corner, face sullen.Cam stood off to the side, arms crossed over his chest, eyes on her.Her dad followed, perching himself on the edge of his recliner.First, I want to know what Jamies been up to.Tate started at her hands in her lap.Why did she feel guilty for what Jamie had done?Last week, he was drinking at a party and got in trouble.The cops let him off with a warning and I had to pick him up.And tonight, we got in a fight and then he drove and wrecked his car.Silence.Tate looked up at her father through her lashes.His eyes were on Jamie, who stared straight ahead at the wall in front of him.Whats going on with you, Jamie?Nothing.Nothing?He shrugged.Just having a little fun.Wrecking your car is fun?Jamie started to lose some of the surliness in his expression, as his anger began to fade and embarrassment crept in.Well, that wasnt so fun.What did you and your sister fight about?Jamie clenched his jaw.Her father sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose.Tate could tell he was tired.It was late.Dad, why dont you  Why didnt you tell me his behavior was this bad?Those hazel eyes were locked on her now and she felt the heat of the stare.She flicked her eyes to Cam.His gaze was steady, but there was encouragement in his expression.She took a deep breath.I didnt want to worry you.You didnt want to worry me.I was worried the stress would be bad for your health and  I love you, baby.But the fact that my son almost got arrested for underage drinking is something I need to be aware of.Even if Im on my deathbed  Tate sucked in a breath.Please dont say that   he is still my son and what happens to him is my business.I know that but  Tatum.His voice softened.You cant keep doing this.You cant keep making decisions for other people, thinking its the best for them.You just cant.Tates eyes blurred.She was making this a habit, wasnt she?First keeping Cam in the dark, and now her father, because she thought it was best for them.I thought I was doing the right thing.She sniffed.I know that, he said quietly.But you get what Im saying to you?Tate looked up and smiled at Cam through her tears.He returned her smile, and she turned her head to her father.I get you.Tates fathers gaze shifted to Cam.Im getting the sense youre gonna be around more now?Cam swallowed.Your senses are accurate.Wait, what?Jamie sat up, his head turning to Cam and then back to Tate.You dont worry about them right now.Their father pointed at him.You and I are going to talk here in a minute.He held his arms out to Tate.Give your old man a hug and then leave us be.Tate jumped up and ran to her father, squeezing him until he grunted.I love you, Daddy.Love you, too, baby, he said, smoothing her hair.Now git so I can talk to your brother.Tate walked to Cam and grabbed his hand, eyeing Jamie over her shoulder.His eyes were on their clasped hands, his brows furrowed.She knew they still needed to talk, but right now, he was in for a father son chat.She led Cam down the hallway and into her bedroom, shutting the door behind them.She flopped onto the bed on her back, her legs off the edge.So, this was a day.The bed dipped as Cam sank down beside her.Sure was.She closed her eyes until she felt a hand on her arm, and then Cam linked his fingers with hers.She rolled her head to the side and opened her eyes.He was watching their hands as he rotated them.You think Jamie will be okay?she asked.His eyes rose to hers.Yeah, yeah I do.Why do you think so?Because he has a sister who watches out for him and a dad who loves him.And ...Cam licked his lips, and then brought their hands up.He kissed their thumbs.And now Im back.For how long?she whispered.His brows lowered.You see me going anywhere?No, but  He leaned closer and pressed a kiss to her lips, swiping his tongue along the seam until she opened for him.And then any lingering questions she had vanished as his arms came around her, cradling her head, thumb rubbing that sensitive spot behind her ear.And when he pulled back, all she could do was return his smile.Well figure it out, he said softly.For now, lets get used to each other again.All right?She bit her lip and nodded.Okay.And that earned her another kiss.13      CAM WATCHED TATE as she wiped down the counter of the diner.Her brows were furrowed, and every time the bell rang over the door, her eyes darted to see who it was.And every time it wasnt Jamie, her posture relaxed slightly until the next time the bell rang.Cam had let Jamie borrow his moms car so he could keep working, even though it wasnt easy for him to deliver pizzas with a cast.Itd been a couple of weeks since the accident.Cam took a gulp of his water and crushed an ice cube between his teeth.Hed thought meeting Jamie on neutral turf was a good idea, but now he wasnt so sure.Hell, he was tempted to set parameters for which weapons to bring.The bell rang and from Cams booth in the corner, he heard Tates intake of breath.He took another sip of water and waited.Jamies heavy footsteps came up behind him, and then the old booth creaked and leather squeaked as Jamie slid in across from him.Cam pointed to a cup in front of Jamie.Got you some water.Jamies eyes flicked down to it, then back to Cam.He didnt say anything.Youre welcome, Cam said.Jamies eyes narrowed.Cam sighed.He knew this wasnt going to be easy.But Tate and her dad had asked him to talk to Jamie.At one time, theyd been close.Jamie had looked at him with hero worship in his eyes and although it had made Cam a little uncomfortable, he hadnt wanted to disappoint the kid.But then shit hit the fan, and Cam had been too angry and selfish to check in with Jamie.He should have known that Tate and his breakup would be close to a divorce to Jamie.And with no mom and a sick dad, he must have been lost.The guilt pushed down on Cams shoulders, but he took a deep breath.He was back now.He could try to get the kid back on track.Cam clasped his hands on the table in front of him.Okay, so I owe you an apology.No movement from Jamie.In fact, it looked like he wasnt breathing.Cam continued.I should have checked in with you when Tate and I broke up.And thats on me.I can bet you felt pretty abandoned.And with your dad getting sick and ...well, Im sorry.He looked Jamie dead in the eye.Thats on me.You didnt do anything wrong.And Ill always regret not being there for you.Jamie didnt move.But he held Cams gaze, so Cam figured that was a good thing.At least the kid hadnt gotten up and walked away.Why?Jamies voice was almost a whisper when he finally spoke.Why what?Why didnt you keep in contact with me?Cam shook his head.I was so wrapped up in myself, man.I was so focused on being pissed at your sister.So I cut everything out of my life that reminded me of her.And that was wrong.So wrong.I didnt think about how that would impact you.I was a selfish kid at the time.I see that now.Jamies jaw worked, and his eyes shifted, like his brain had to shift a couple of gears.Then he finally dropped his eyes to the table in front of him.When Jamie spoke, he kept his eyes on the table.You were just ...gone.No word.Nothing.And Tate was always crying.And Dad was so sick.He just slept all the time.Jamie raised his eyes.I hated you.I kept thinking youd be back and youd take care of us.But you never came back.And then you finally show up now.And acted like you could boss me around and tell me what to do.And I hated you even more.Cam felt flayed alive.Like his skin was peeling off his bones and every nerve was raw, exposed.The fuck had he been doing in college?Fucking off, playing video games.Drinking and screwing girls.While Tates family was back here struggling.He couldnt even blame Tate for this.Hed dropped the ball with Jamie.I realize I cant make up for when I was gone.I wish I could.Jamies eyes flicked to Tate behind the diner counter.Cam followed his eyes as Tate stood there, face pale, wringing a towel in her hands.Its her fault, Jamie said.No its not.But  Jamie, she was eighteen.You dont need details but it didnt go down the way everyone thought it did.But she did make a bad decision.And were trying to get past it now.There was still wariness in his eyes.Hesitation.Mistrust.Jamie fiddled with the wrapper to his straw, his eyes on his fingers.How long you gonna be around this time?That was a million dollar question but Cam answered as honestly as he could.Tate and I are doing everything we can to make it last this time.Were in it for the long haul.He reached over and stilled Jamies fingers, and the younger mans eyes shot up to his.But Jamie, no matter what, I promise you, Ill keep in touch with you.Always.Our relationship is independent of my relationship with Tate.Jamie stared, and his Adams apple bobbed as he swallowed.Do you believe me?Cam asked quietly.Jamie bit his lip, then nodded jerkily.Cam let go of his fingers and leaned back in his seat.He let a grin stretch his lips, and when an answering grin passed over Jamies face, Cam let out a breath.He jerked his chin toward the counter.You think you could spare some time and have a chat with your sister?Jamie ducked his head and the blush staining his cheeks showed Cam he knew he had been an ass.Sure, but uh, can we talk sometime about joining up?Cam cocked his head with brows furrowed.Jamie fidgeted.Was thinking about the military.To help for school.And to ...get my head on straight, I guess.Cam nodded.Of course we can talk.Ill tell you everything I know.Jamie smiled.Thanks.Cam knew the next topic was going to be uncomfortable but he brought it up anyway.Hey, we also need to talk about what you said to your sister.Jamie ducked his head as his ears reddened.He was embarrassed.
