Cassie wanted to smack him.Hows everything, Kim?Great, thanks.She gave his arm a friendly little clout.I just heard about what youre doing.Its great.He gave her a blank look.Doing?The music lessons for low income kids.Oh.That.Its nothing.Kim shook her head.I know what music teachers can charge per hour.He studied the sidewalk.Its just something Ive wanted to do for a long time.Cassies eyes watered.Bless him.He was doing what Elliott had done for him, years ago.Laura couldnt let such a good guy slip through her fingers.Well, Id better run, Kim said.See yall later.They all said their good byes.Kim walked down the sidewalk, her shiny hair swinging, and Sean eyed the vehicles along the curb as if he were trying to remember where hed parked.Dont run off, Cassie said.Do you have time to go someplace where we can talk in private?Its about Lauras safety.Seans face clouded with gratifying concern, and he pointed toward the old caf.You bet I have time.Let me buy you a coffee, and lets talk.Except for the rickety wooden arch marking the entrance, the old church camp on the northern side of Hamlin Lake was a lovely place.Wild daylily plants filled the roadside ditches, their pale green buds nearly ready to burst into orange.A mix of pines and hardwoods on both sides of the road offered shade against the afternoon sun.The holy roller camp, half the town called it, but those Pentecostals were good people.Lauras grandparents on both sides had connections there.She and Presto Preston had parked their vehicles in the gravel parking lot, then walked back to the road together so he could show her the very spot where he thought hed seen her father.Except for having lost most of his hair, Preston hadnt changed much since Laura had taken biology from him in high school.Although she was a fellow teacher now, she knew she would never call him by his nickname or his first name.He was still Mr.Preston to her.Teaching history, eh?he said.You should come home and teach in Prospect.The pays probably about the same anywhere.She laughed.Youre right.Its not especially good anywhere.Now, tell me what you saw.And when.It was early Sunday morning, still dark but not too dark, he said, striding away from her.Ill show you where I was when I first spotted him.He crossed to the other side of the road, turned, and looked in both directions.Yeah, I was about here, and your dadhe pointed to a thick tree trunk to Lauras leftwas about there, passing in front of that big oak.Moving fast, like he always did.Could you see his face, though?Not clearly.With one finger, Preston pushed his wonky glasses higher on his nose.It was more the total package that convinced me.His height, his build.The way he moved.And the way he obviously didnt want to be seen.But he must have heard your vehicle, must have seen your headlights, so why didnt he get off the road in time?I was on foot too.Didnt Sean mention that?I was out for my morning walk, so I wasnt making any more noise than your dad was.But once he spotted me, he slipped into the underbrush and made himself scarce.Did you call out to him?Several times.I called his name and yelled Come back a couple of times, and I tried to follow him.But hed vanished.Preston gestured toward the camp property.There are lots of places to hide over there.He could have run from one building to another, from one stand of trees to another.But why would he hide out here, especially this time of year?There are too many people.Campers, staff, parents.Correct.I dont think he was hiding out here.Just passing through, maybe, before everybody was up and about.Like he was returning to the scene of the crime.Laura didnt answer.It wasnt a crime for a man to go on a long wilderness trek without notifying his wife and daughter first.It was perfectly legal even if it broke their hearts.You look skeptical, Preston said.Did Sean get to you?I know hes a skeptic, but that doesnt mean you have to be one too.I have mixed feelings.Im trying to see it from all angles.Good.You know I always want solid evidence, and we dont have any yet.Preston squinted toward the mountains.But the Nantahala Wilderness is the perfect refuge for a man who doesnt want to be found.He could live off the land for years too.When I was scoutmaster, twenty years ago, he did some demonstrations for my scout troop.He knew how to make his own fishhooks and rabbit snares.How to build a solid shelter from practically nothingand camouflage it.How to doctor himself with wild plants.Hed mastered every survival trick in the book.She tried to smile.I remember.Still, she felt sick as she pictured her dad in the wild with no medical care.He was in his midsixties, the same age Grandpa Gantt was when he started showing signs of mental deterioration.So, Preston continued, I wonder what happened.Did he drown or did he walk?If he walkedwhy did he walk?Thats the important question.She only nodded.Those were some of her questions too, but she didnt trust her voice not to crack from the utter confusion of her conflicted emotions.Together, they headed back to the parking lot.Preston reached his vehicle first.After a few minutes of small talk, he said good bye and drove away.Laura stood beside her own car, taking in the sights and smells and sounds.Church vans and buses crowded the lot, but there wasnt a soul in sight.Young campers were gathered in the chapel, singing with shrill, happy voices.The clatter of pots and pans came from the mess hall as the staff cleaned up after lunch.A leftover lunchtime aroma wafted through the air.Spaghetti, maybe, or sloppy joes.Those turkey sandwiches, the night her dad disappeared, must have come from that very building.The mess hall.Some of the camp staff had driven around to the southern side of the lake that night, bringing coffee and sandwiches for the dive team and everyone else whod gathered there.Not that anyone had felt like eating.The staffers had prayed with her momor theyd prayed for her, anyway.Looking dazed, she hadnt done much talking.If she suspected that they should be hunting for her husbands footprints instead of diving for his body, she didnt mention it.Laura never went back to Hamlin Lake after that night.It was time to face it, and it might be easier from this side.The northern shore.Half expecting a camp employee to stop her and ask if she had a visitors pass, Laura set off across the parking lot.She walked across a weedy lawn, then continued to the coarse sand of the shore and the weathered planks of a fishing dock.The water lapped softly against the dock, and the wind tugged her hair.Except for the spring flowers in the woods, everything probably looked much as it had on a hot summer day years before.In August, the kudzus purple blossoms would have been giving off their sweet, musky scent, and the leaves would have been wilting and aging in the summer heat.Today, though, the vines hadnt bloomed yet.Their leaves were fresh and young.Across the blue water lay the ramp where her dad had launched his boat one last time, and the shore where the sheriff had gathered his dive crew.Laura had hung back from the commotion that night.In shock, trying not to think too hard, she kept looking at the camps buildings on the other side of the lake, their windows spilling light across the dark water.She hadnt wanted to look at the lake itself.Every time she did, she imagined her dads lifeless body in it.Now she could imagine him alive and well.Not drowning, but swimming to shoreto this shore.He might have come out of the water on the rough, reddish sand and run lightly into the pines, abandoning everything.Not just his boat, truck, and trailer, but his business.His friends.His wife and daughter.Laura squeezed her eyes shut against the hurt that threatened to overwhelm her.She needed to focus, instead, on learning what had really happened when her dad took his boat out for the last time.The sun beat down on her head as she returned to her car.Its Colorado license plate reminded her she wasnt a resident of Georgia anymore.Little more than a month before, shed been busy winding down the school year in Denver.Shed had one living parent and one dead parent.Now, maybe, theyd traded places.The sun had barely set, but after hours of boxing up her mothers books, Laura was ready for the day to be over.Contacts out and teeth brushed, wearing warm pajamas and her moms white terry cloth robe, shed made a comfy nest for herself on the couch.She had ten or twelve journals, a quilt tucked around her feet, and a cat sleeping in her lap.She was enjoying Mikeys company although he wasnt entirely conscious of hers.Wanting to read for fun tonight, not for clues, shed chosen early journals that ranged from before her birth to her toddler years.She opened one at random.My honey redhead, my redhead honey.Poor little carrot top baby, you look more like your mama than your daddy.Laura browsed for a while, but her mothers obvious enjoyment of motherhood only stirred up grief and remorse.The mother daughter bond could have been so much stronger.No doubt theyd used up most of their emotional energy on her dads issues, but surely they could have talked more often and more openly.It might have helped them stay close even through the tough times.But theyd drifted apart just when they needed each other most.Laura closed her eyes, recalling the heated remark her mom had made while they were still awash in shock and grief.Stop living in a little girl fantasy and get off to college.Then and there, a wall had gone up between them.It had never become a real estrangement, fortunately.They loved each other.They talked on the phone often.Their conversations were often strained, though, with mysterious undercurrents flowing below the surface of their chitchat.Regret couldnt change a thing.Trying to steer herself out of a weepy mood, Laura focused on a droll description of one of her toddler tantrums.Apparently theyd been frequent and ferocious.She jumped when she became aware of a familiar rumble outside.Seans truck.Shoot, she whispered, slapping the journal closed and fluffing her hair in a hurry.Move, Mikey.The cat flexed one paw, dug a claw into the robe, and made himself a dead weight on her lap.The trucks door slammed.Move, tuna breath!She finally nudged Mikey away.He departed in a huff, but Seans feet were already pounding up the back steps.Laura, he called, knocking on the door.Its me.She sighed, resigned to being caught in her pajamas.Come on in.She heard the opening and closing of the door and then his footsteps crossing the kitchen.He loomed in the doorway to the living room, frowning.Why wasnt the door locked?Old habits are hard to break.Why didnt you call first?He smiled.Sorry.Old habits.He inclined his head toward the kitchen.It looks bare in there.Whered all the plants go?I gave em to Ardelle.Good idea.He noticed the journals.Hey, you found them.Yes, but theyre not terribly riveting so far.Its mostly stuff like this.Listen.Unwilling to give him a glimpse of herself as a bratty toddler, she chose an earlier volume and picked a page at random, near the end.How soon the brightest blossoms can fade and wilt and fall, and then they rot on the ground.She shook her head.Thats not typical, though.She must have been in a bad mood that day.But are they all like that?Philosophical rambling?No, its mostly trivia.Cheerful trivia.She wrote a million words about practically nothing.The garden and the weather and what she planned to buy herself for her birthday.Laura flipped back to the books first page and frowned at its opening sentence.How quickly things can blossom overnight It was followed by a line about splurging on freesia scented hand lotion.She shut the journal without reading the lines aloud.Actually, most of its superficial, she said.Shallow.Was my mom shallow?He didnt answer right away.I dont know if thats the right word.From the times we talked religion and politics, Id say she was a deep thinker.And you know she was a saint, the way she devoted herself to helping your dad deal with his moods.Still, she was sort ofself centered.The journals are all about her.Sean gave her a sidelong look.Isnt that what a diary is for?To vent about your own life?Anyway, Im not surprised.Every conversation somehow ended up being about her too.True.Well, at least thats one thing we can agree on.Two things.One, she had her faults.Two, we loved her.Laura laughed so she wouldnt cry.We cant even agree on how many things we agree on?Sean tilted his head and examined her.You okay?Yeah.Are you?Whats on your mind?She must have fooled him into believing she was okay, because he settled back against the couch cushions.I ran into Cassie this afternoon, he said.She told me about your prowler.Oh boy.This is why I cant tell her anything.Shes a blabbermouth.You told Cassie the blabbermouth but you didnt tell me?I knew you would overreact.Im not.Id just like to change your locks.Why?Because, as weve discussed before, half the county has a key.Thats an exaggeration and you know it.Mom only gave keys to people she trusted.Please, Laura.Let me change your locks.And then youll tell me I need bars on the windows and an alarm system and a loaded gun by my bed.And a watchdog.No, thank you.I appreciate your concern, but Im fine.I know why you think youre fine, he said.Youve talked yourself into believing your visitor was your dad.Just about.And why not?I met Preston at the church camp today so he could show me exactly where he thought he saw my dad, and his story is pretty darned believable.Lets discuss what I call prowler logic, Sean said.The familiar cynical smile lifted one corner of his mouth.If theres a prowler at your house and miles awayat the church camp on the lake, for instanceits probably not Elliott.Therefore you should be on your guard.You think its some random pervert, as Cassie put it?Thats a good possibility, anyway.What if its my dad, crossing town to get where hes going?Isnt that possible?Possible but not probable.Look, the whole towns on edge like it was years ago when Slattery was our prowler.Now, seems theres a new one around, and people are jumping to crazy conclusions.I can come up with a few other explanations too, including the fact that it just might be Dale.No matter who it is, Id sleep a lot better if you had new deadbolts on your doors.And if you used them.Oh, Sean.Youre such a worrywart.Only because you worry me.By the way, I drove past your grandparents old place today and noticed somebody has posted No Trespassing signs.She raised her right hand.That was me.Why?She sighed.Because I thought I saw Dales truck pulling in there.Im not absolutely sure because I didnt see his face.Whoever it was, he was trespassing.I didnt like it, so I put up the signs.Ill find out if it was Dale.Tension stretched over Seans features.No, let it go.Dont worry about it.Focus on your business.On whatever it is you need to do to get ready for the festival.Are you making any progress?Yes maam, so Ive earned the right to badger you about changing the locks.Maybe she could still make him drop the subject.What did you accomplish today?I picked up my new business cards, wrote up a brochure, and updated my fancy pants website.You have a website?Ive had one for years.You think I live in the Dark Ages?He dug out his wallet, pulled out a card, and handed it to her.Sean Halloran, Luthier.The printing blurred in front of her eyes before she could read the details.Shed never forgotten the dreams hed shyly shared with her when they were fourteen and hed just started music lessons with her dad.Do you still dream of playing Nashville?she asked.The half smile came back.No, Im a little more in touch with reality now.Ill never be that good.But your instruments are good enough to be onstage, in the hands of big name artists.Itll happen someday.You know what Id rather see?My instruments in childrens hands.Children cant afford your instruments.Therell be a few who can, he said.One way or another.Ill see to it.I bet you will.Youd be a good teacher.She tried to hand the card back.Keep it, he said so tersely that she wondered if he meant the card or the sentiment.When can I change your locks?When I say so.Sean muttered something.He got to his feet and walked toward the door, where he faced her again.Ill lock up on my way out.Is the other door locked?Yes.Good.He studied the journals piled around her, then met her eyes.Its hard to lose your mother.I remember.For me, it came in waves.Id think I was past it, and then it would hit me again, and Id be back where I started, crying like a baby.You were only ten.You practically were a baby.And believe me, Ive done my share of crying too.But never when Im around.Whats with that?Scared Ill give you a hug?She had to smile.Something like that.Yeah, something like that.One of these days.He winked and slipped out the door before she could answer.Not that shed had an answer handy.Laura took another look at his business card.Her dad would have been so proud of his protg.If only they could be reunited, the master and the apprentice.For just one day.Outside, the trucks engine started.The headlights came on, and Sean flashed themoff, on, off, on.Stop it, you brat, she said under her breath.When they were in high school, hed told her the flashing lights meant Good night.I love you.It had taken her a couple of weeks to work up her courage and flick the porch light in response.Then shed made a regular habit of it, but shed never said I love you out loud.Shed never written it either.They must have written a million notes to each other in high school.Theyd left notes under windshield wipers, in jackets, in schoolbooks.Hed closed each one with Love, Sean or I love you, but shed always been afraid to use that dangerous word.Back when Seans sister in law was almost a big sister to Laura, theyd had some heart to heart talks.As much as Annie had tried to play matchmaker, shed been honest about what she called the Dale problem.He was a horrible father in law, although hed never hated Annie and her family like he hated the Gantts.Maybe love could conquer hatred.Or maybe not.Laura was still afraid to put it to the test.Surrounded by the flowery scents of detergent and fabric softener, Cassie was folding the last of her laundry when she heard her mom calling from halfway across the house.Good morning, Cassie!I hear you rattling around, but where are you?See, I told you this place is way too big, Cassie bawled back.Laundry room.Back in L. A. , she had to round up a pile of quarters, lug everything down to the basement, and hope the washer and dryer were available.Here, doing the laundry was almost fun now that shed figured out the controls.Her moms expensive new appliances offered too many options.Cassie pulled her thrift store find out of the dryer and shook out the wrinkles.A soft blue, the beautiful, hand embroidered peasant shirt might pass for vintage.And vintage was cool.Her mom walked in, wearing a dark, shapeless sack of a bathrobe.She unwrapped one of those low calorie breakfast bars that always seemed to leave her starving.Look at you.So industrious so early in the morning.Its not early.I did your jeans load and some of my stuff.Thanks, sweetheart.What a pretty shirt.Did you make it?Cassie laughed.Me?Sew?Are you out of your mind?I used to sew, but I dont have the patience for it anymore.Thats why I started scrapping.Its my way of journaling, I guess.Everybody needs a good hobby.She took a bite of her breakfast bar.What are your plans for today, hon?Hanging out with you.Oh, good.You can help me plan the party.Im so glad Laura and Sean are coming.Cassie groaned.I still cant believe you actually invited them.Theyll find a way out of it.Why?They hate birthdays.Remember?Elliott drowned just before their birthdays.The same week.Close, anyway.So dont be surprised if Laura suddenly has other plans for Saturday.Besides that, she and Sean havent been a couple since high school.And anyway I doubt theyll care about a little boys party, Mom.Sure they will.Cassie refrained from rolling her eyes, but even she, the aunt, wasnt especially excited about Trevors fifth birthday party.It wasnt his fault.He was adorable.That was the problem, actually.Tiggers perfect little family was one hundred percent adorable, happy, and successful, and Tig could never shut up about any of it.Shed been a stay at home mom from the beginning too, without even cramping their budget.Sometimes it didnt seem fair.Seans such a nice young man, Ardelle added.Im glad your father made that call.Startled, Cassie started paying attention to her mom again.Call?What call?When he sicced the authorities on Dale.Huh?Ardelle gave her a look of big eyed innocence.Oh.Never mind.About to ask questions, Cassie began to suspect that was exactly what her mother hoped for.It seemed like a ploy to open up a subject that might have been better left alone, so Cassie stayed obstinately quiet.The silence wasnt broken until the cat sidled into the room, meowed piteously, and shook herself, releasing a long white hair to drift to the tiles.She meowed again.Arabella Antoinette, stop your begging, Ardelle said.I already fed you.I still cant believe you named her that.Our other cats never had middle names.Or pedigrees.She knows shes in real trouble when I use all three names.Like you and Tig always knew.Watch this.She leaned over.Arabella Antoinette Bright!Arabella laid back her ears and nipped out of the laundry room, her fluffy tail dragging the tiles.Cute, Cassie said.You have a real way with animals.Dont I?Ardelle peeled the wrapper of the breakfast bar down to the bottom and popped the last bite into her mouth.Ill include Sean and Laura in the head count for the party.Plan on having leftovers, then, Cassie said, wishing she could ship them to Drew.Theyll come.You wait and see.Ardelle dropped the wrapper into the wastebasket and yawned.I didnt sleep well.Did you hear the thunderstorm about four in the morning?I lay awake for hours, thinking of poor Jess out there in the graveyard.Obviously the weather didnt matter to Jess anymore, but Cassie reminded herself to be diplomatic.Has it been hard on you?she asked gently.Hard?To lose my very best friend in the world?Her mothers voice trembled.What do you think?Mom, I only Dont you roll your eyes like a bratty teenager, Cassandra Jane, and dont be so cold hearted.Wanting to argue that she tried to keep her heart at an acceptable temperature, Cassie made herself think of a softer response.Im sorry.You know I loved her too.I know you did.Ardelle started rubbing her thumb and forefinger together, making a whispery sound.It was one of her annoying new habits.Jess was such a sweet soul.I just wish she hadnt soured on church and all.She was starting to think she only believed in auras and angels and whatnot.I dont think she believed all that New Agey stuff.She just liked to push peoples buttons by talking about it.She believed it, all right.Once she told me she thought death might be some kind of recycling process and shed be back, somehow, watching over us like a guardian angel.Talk about recycling.It was the same little speech shed made the night before, almost word for word.Mom, have you ever thought about talking things over with your pastor?Or a counselor?Dont be ridiculous.I dont need counseling.When we face losses, we just have to accept them and move on.Like the adults we are.Her chin quivered, but she straightened her shoulders and walked out of the room.Cassie shook her head.Her mom acted normal most of the time, but like an orchestra with just one instrument out of tune, something wasnt quite right.At least she wasnt keeping the obituary on the kitchen table anymore.That was an improvement.Cassie pulled her threadbare pajamas out of the dryer and buried them under the other clothes in the laundry basket.Her dad knew she and Drew were barely scraping by, but they hadnt told her mom.She had enough troubles already.Bluegrass rang from Lauras house as Sean climbed out of the truck.He ran up the back steps, rapped on the door and waited in the warm twilight.She wasnt playing just any old bluegrass album.It was a CD Elliott and his band had made, back in the day when it was a big deal to produce a CD.Sean was only a kid then, and he wasnt accomplished enough to join in.How hed envied them: Elliott, Doc, and Noodle, with an occasional assist from Gibby if he was in town.Sean knocked again, to no avail, and finally tried the doorknob.Unlocked.Figures.He stuck his head into the familiar kitchen, and the music blasted him.Laura, he called.Its me.Still no answer, so he walked in, shutting the door behind him.The song had just hit the bridge where Elliott went nuts on the fiddle, leading the rest of them on a merry chase.Sean had planned to take fiddle lessons from Elliott sometime, but after hed drowned it didnt seem to matter anymore.Sean had never even looked for a different teacher.The music grew louder still as he followed it across the living room and down the hall.He stopped in the doorway to Jesss room.Laura sat cross legged on the bed, surrounded by piles of clothes.Shed draped one of her mothers worn flannel shirts around her shoulders.Laura, he called.Still deaf to his voice, she pulled the shirts sleeves around her front.As if a shirt could be a stand in for her moms hug.Laura let the sleeves fall.She folded a black and white bandanna into a triangle and tied it on her head.Unaware of her visitor, she studied her reflection in the mirror on the bureau.Her face reminded him of a picture of a saint in some old book.Solemn eyes, deep sadness, deeper calm.Like she had touched God, had survived with scars.It was like the Sunday school story about Jacob, whod wrestled with an angel or maybe with God Himself.The man was marked for life.Crippled.Yet the crippling would make him think of God with every step, so even the injury was a gift.Sean shook his head.He wasnt accustomed to thinking that way.Tired of feeling like a stalker, he tried again.Laura!he shouted over the music.Her head jerked up, her eyes wide.Sean!You scared me.Sorry.The door was unlocked.I yelled but you didnt answer.You could have yelled again, she said tartly, pulling the flannel shirt off her shoulders and dropping it on the bed.I did.Mind if I turn down the volume a little?Go ahead.He found the stereo on Jesss dresser behind a clutter of toiletries and turned it down.Music is best when its good and loud, but theres a limit.The louder the better, my dad always said.What brings you by?I wanted to make sure you were remembering to keep your doors locked.Laura rolled her eyes.Oh brother.Did I prove my point?Yes.Happy now?Not exactly.The lively number ended.After a brief silence, a beautiful little guitar solo moved the band into a melancholy ballad with Elliott singing the lead.Doc and Noodle provided the unobtrusive harmony.When water burns and granite turns as watry as the dew, When horses run upon the sun, then shall my love be true.Elliott had written the song, trying to re create the tone of an old Scottish ballad.Sean wasnt sure it worked on that level, but it captured the mood of heartbreak.When cockle shells turn siller bells, and barley grows at sea, When frost and snaw shall warm us a, then shall my love love me.Decrepit old Mikey, happy in his own selfish little universe, was curled up on a pillow against the dark red wood of the headboard.There used to be three cats.Mikey, Turbo, and Slinky had slept wherever they pleased.Sometimes there were two cats on a shelf, like bookends, or one cat snoozing on the mantel, squeezed between the knickknacks.Part of the dcor.Now they were down to Mikey, the oldest, ugliest one.His fur was the same gray brown as a possum, and he was about as useful as a possum.Sean looked around the room.Laura had folded a lot of clothes already and placed them in bags and boxes.A brown purse lay flat and empty at the foot of the bed, its contents dumped beside itan opened wallet, keys, papers, lipstick.A dozen other purses made a heap on the floor.She started folding one of her moms sweatshirts, a brown one with Appalachian Trail in green letters above a dogwood flower.Going through her clothes already?he asked, just as Elliott was singing then shall my love love me again.Well, we know she isnt coming back, Laura said in a matter of fact tone that didnt fool Sean for one minute.He sat on a corner of the bed while she folded the sweatshirt.She tucked it to her chest with her chin, exactly the way Jess did.The way Jess used to do.The cherry wood headboard shone red in the sunlight, a nice backdrop for Lauras hair.The headboard was one of Elliotts finest pieces, its focal point a distinctive knot design that he hadnt carved into anything else.A true love knot, hed called it.Its curves looped so gracefully around each other that they fooled the eye into thinking hed tied the knot from a length of rope, then magically turned it to silky wood.Lauras hair hung down, screening her face.Sean wanted to push her hair aside and give her a kiss with the old familiarity theyd lost.He wanted to tumble her down on the bed, right on the neat piles of clothes.Needing something else to think about, he reached for Jesss wallet, turning it sideways to study her drivers license through its transparent window.The picture had been taken before her red hair had started to fade into gray.The wallet held a Red Cross blood donor card too.I didnt know your mom was a blood donor, he said.Oh yeah.So was Dad.Gary and Ardelle are too.Their civic mindedness must have rubbed off on me, because Ive started giving blood a couple times a year.Good for you.I should too, but who would want blood from a Halloran?She didnt answer except to purse her lips slightly.He couldnt decide if she had Jesss mouth or Elliotts, but she definitely had her mothers calm strength.Too much of it, maybe.And dark shadows under her eyes.Sean closed the wallet.I hope youre getting some rest, he said.Stress can wear a body out.Im not stressed.Im just sorting throughstuff.And I mean that both literally and figuratively.Are you made of steel?Lauras mouththe side he could see, in profiletwisted upward.Stainless.She tucked her hair behind her ear, giving him a better view, and picked up a flowery shirt.Her long fingers folded it quickly and neatly.Once the festival craziness is over, I can help you tie up the loose ends, he said.I remember doing some of that for Dad before I left for college.Canceling a dentists appointment.Taking back his library books.They were overdue, but the librarian waived the fines.Youll need to cancel your moms credit cards too.Turn in her drivers license.Do her taxes.Decide whether or not youre selling her SUV.Ill sell it.Guess Id better start advertising.Slap some signs on it and drive it around town now and then too.Its not good for a vehicle to just sit.She nodded.Still fussing with that shirt, she laid it on the bed in a neat rectangle and plucked the shoulders square.Shed always been a bit of a perfectionist in an imperfect world.Finished with the shirt, she studied him for a long moment that was hushed and still.Even the stereo fell silent between songs.Can you humor me for a minute?she asked.Sure, he said as the band launched into another of Elliotts originals, a mournful tune hed called Blue Mountains.Okay, Laura said.Let me give you a tour of the closet.Excuse me?You need to see Dads side of the closet.She sat up straighter.I think Mom thought hed come back someday, because its still full of his clothes.Your mom was a pack rat.Come on, Sean.Just let me show you what Ive found.Laura, dont get caught up in these false hopes.Im afraid they wont pan out and youll be devastated.No longer calm and saintly, she glared at him.Thats not what youre afraid of.Youre afraid to face facts.He dropped the wallet on the bed and stood up.You dont seem to know the definition of the word fact.You need What I dont need is your advice.If you refuse to do something as simple as looking in the closet, you can just get lost, Halloran.Locking eyes with her, he made his decision.He cranked up the stereo again and walked out.He was halfway down the steps by the time the three man band started wailing about blue mountains and broken hearts under a lonesome moon.He climbed into his truck, slammed the door, and turned on the country rock station as loud as he could stand it.Laura would be afraid too, if she knew what he knew.A tour of the closet might have brought him to the brink of telling her.Driving too fast, Sean headed back to town.Past the Brights old house, past the library, past the old park.One quick glimpse of the picnic tables under the trees brought back the Fourth of July picnic when he and Laura were sixteen.The smoke from grilling meats.Little kids shrieking and waving American flags.Firecrackers whining and popping in the dusk.The acrid smell of gunpowder.Then, when Elliott was already edgy from the crowds and the noise, Gary had smarted off about some fool thing.Elliott had shoved him backward into a picnic table and nearly strangled himand then wept and apologized and helped him pick the potato salad off his shirt.He always apologized profusely and sincerely, but hed proved himself capable of hurting anybody, over anything.Or over nothing at all.And that was exactly why Sean didnt want to tell Laura what hed once seen at Bennetts lake.Five minutes after Seans truck barreled out of Lauras driveway, Ardelles car pulled in with its top down.Gary was at the wheel.His straight, sandy hair was windblown, but Ardelle had a big scarf tied firmly around her head.They charged up the steps, laughing about something.Wearing oven mitts, she carried a dish covered with aluminum foil.Gary was carrying a plastic bag that probably held food too.Go away, Laura said softly, watching through the screen door.Go find Sean and smack him for me.She pasted on a smile and opened the door.What a nice surprise.Come on in.Just long enough to unload these vittles, Ardelle said.Were on our way to Wednesday night prayer.I wish Cassie wouldve come, but theres some silly show she always watches on Wednesday nights.She paused for a breath.Its tuna casserole and lemon poppy seed muffins.Thank you so much.Still peeved with Sean, Laura was tempted to take it out on Ardelle by confronting her about the boxed up journals and her other intrusions.But if she really couldnt help herself, accusations would only be cruel.Ardelle placed the hot dish on an empty burner of the stove and tucked her oven mitts under one arm.Its a lot for one person.You can invite Sean over.Hed like that.Gary gave Laura an apologetic smile.Or you could, you know, freeze some for later.He set the bag of muffins on the counter.Good idea, Laura said, grateful that he understood.Ardelle moved the muffins to a different spot.Im sure enjoying those plants.And the goodies and the scrapping supplies.Next time you come over, Ill show you my latest scrapbook.That would be lovely.Wed better run.Come on, Gary.We dont want to be late for church.Laura followed them onto the porch.Across the road, vehicles were pulling into the church parking lot, and the buildings lights blazed in the twilight.Looks like a good turnout for a weeknight.Oh, we love the new preacher.Ardelle trotted down the steps.He preached a wonderful message for your mothers funeral, didnt he?Yes.Actually, Laura hardly remembered the message.She recalled the music, though, because shed chosen the hymns herself, wanting lyrics that would soothe her soul with peace.Heavns morning breaks, and earths vain shadows flee, In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me.Lauras vision went blurry and her throat ached.She hoped the Lord had still been abiding with a sinner whod wandered far afield.Gary leaned against the railing and gazed across the yard.Look how those daylilies have multiplied.The whole slope will be full of flowers in a week or two, but Jess wont be here to enjoy them.He shook his head.Sorry, Laura.That was insensitive.She moved to stand beside him.No.I think things like that all the time.A wave of grief hit her again, as Sean had predicted.Her mom should have been there, chatting with her visitors or walking to the end of the drive for her mail.She should have been there, pulling weeds or picking wildflowers.She should have been there.Yet Laura was grateful that shed had her mother for thirty years.Sean had had his mother for only ten.She blinked hard and made herself focus on the present.Gary was still talking.The new daylilies are fancy, with ruffled petals or double blooms, but your mom loved the old fashioned kind.That one is a golden oldie, you might call it, but its more orange than golden.Laura nodded, but they were just ordinary daylilies to her, no more special than the wild ones that grew in roadside ditches.At the bottom of the steps, Ardelle turned around, working her hands together in a fidgety motion.Come on, Gary.We cant be late.Its all right, Ardie, he said gently.The world will go on turning if were thirty seconds late for Wednesday night prayer.He moved away from the railing with tears in his eyes.Ardelles new agitation was so troubling.Lauras heart ached for both of them.Thanks so much for bringing supper, she said.It means a lot that youre thinking of me.Always.Im always thinking of you, Laura.Ardelle blew a kiss over her shoulder.Dont forget the birthday party!They climbed into the car.Gary revved the engine and made the short hop across the road to the church.He put the top up and they hurried inside, holding hands.Nearly in tears, Laura sat on the porch steps with her chin in her hands and stared at the churchyard across the road.Her mothers month old grave had been covered with gravel to match its neighbors.The big floral tributes were long gone, but a few late daffodils bloomed near the family plot.They were delicate and soft compared to the garish artificial flowers on some of the graves.Gram Flynn had always said believers graves were seeds sown for the Resurrection, when dead saints would pop out of the ground like tulips in the spring.Every year, Laura remembered Gram when her favorite tulips bloomed, their white petals splashed with streaks of pink and red.Gram had worshiped a wild and fearsome God who visited Holy Ghost revivals and tent meetings, who whispered to sinners on the mourners bench and carried them home like lost lambs.Shed have been heartbroken if shed known her daughter might one day drift away from the church and be accused of breaking her marriage vows.Youve been unfaithful.Dont deny it.Dont lie to me.Laura shook her head.It couldnt be true.Yet she couldnt forget the pain in her fathers voice, nor could she forget the way Gibby had smiled down at her mom in the snapshot shed tucked away in the cedar chest.Even if something had happened between them, it was twelve years in the past.Most likely, nothing had happened.Nothing at all.Going inside, she wrinkled her nose at the smell of the casserole.She wasnt a fan of tuna.Ardelle must have forgotten, but it was sweet of her to bring supper anyway.Laura lifted the foil from the dish.Here, kitty kitty kitty.Mikey, you want a special treat?Halfway to his brothers place, Sean spotted old Granny Colfax hustling through the weeds by the side of the road.Hed be smart to steer clear of the old biddy, but on the other hand, shed been around forever.Maybe shed even give him a scrap of information about Elliott.There he went again, half believing the man could be alive.He slowed, passing her, and pulled over on the shoulder to wait.It didnt take long.For an old woman, she was in good shape.He leaned across the cab and opened the passenger door.Granny Colfax, he called.Where are you headed?She stopped by the opened door and peered up at him.My ears are bad, but theres nothin wrong with my eyes.Youre a Halloran.Yep.The less said about that, the better.Well, your smile makes you favor your mama, God rest her soul, and thats a good thing.Your hair flops into your eyes and onto your collar, and thats a bad thing.You look like a hippie, young man.Now, what did you ask?Speak up so I can hear you.Where are you headed?he bellowed.To a friends house.Whereabouts?Ohnorth of town.We are north of town.Like I said.North.Farther north.Where are you bound, young fella?My brothers place.Climb in and tell me where to turn.Come on, its getting too dark for you to be out on the road.She gave him a shrewd, considering stare, then nodded.Dont mind if I do.These achy ol legs just aint what they used to be.She climbed in, settled a paper tote bag at her feet, and pulled the heavy door closed but ignored the seat belt.Sean checked the rearview mirror.While he waited for traffic to pass, he glanced down at Grannys paper bag.It was full of peaches.She must have bought them at the produce stand down the road.Dont you look funny at my old shoes, she said.Theyre ugly, but theyre broke in and comfortable.Like me.He hadnt even noticed her shoes.Sure enough, they were hideous.Shed cut off part of the tops, leaving her toes bare.They werent any prettier than the shoes.Yes maam.He checked his mirror again.Seen Jessamyns girl lately?she asked.He let out a short laugh.I have.Shes a sweet thing, in her way.I ran into her a few days ago, and she looked peaked, like she needed a hug.Back in the day, it was you she got her hugs from.Back in the day.Traffic had cleared, and he pulled the truck onto the road.That was high school.Things change.Some things do, some things dont, but you and the Gantt girl always seemed to belong together.He scowled at the road and didnt answer.Im just glad to see you turning into a decent man, bein as your daddy comes from a long line of scoundrels and liarsfilthy rich though they were.Thank you so much.Youre welcome, she said with a little laugh.Now, heres the mystery.How did that nice Wilkins girl wind up married to Dale Halloran?A baby on the way, maybe?I dont remember the particulars of your big brothers birth, but I know a lot of babies seem to come early in this town.Eight month babies at best, but most people pretend not to notice.Sean sighed.His mother would have been better off as a single mom, but then he never would have been conceived.Is that any of your business?No, but why are you so down at the mouth?You got yourself some troubles?I never had no babies of my own, but that dont mean I cant mother folks who need mothering.I dont need mothering.All right, all right.I got no call to offer advice.His phone rang.He pulled it from his pocket and checked caller ID.Mrs.Anderson, a customer with more money than manners.He hit ignore and put the phone on the seat beside him.Granny eyed it with suspicion.Folks are always talking, talking, talking on those silly things.All those calls, cluttering up the heavens.Turning the whole sky into the tower of Babel.I wonder if anybody ever really listens to each other anymore.You might have something there.The other day, when I ran into Ardelle Bright down to the grocery store, that poor woman talked my ear off like nobody ever listens to her.Shes the lonesomest woman.Sean frowned.Over coffee, Cassie had told him about her moms new issues.Shes a talker, all right.She comes from a hard place, but dont we all?Some of us wind up working for sins wages.Some of us find grace in the eyes of the Lord.Not wages, but a gift.She reached across the broad seat to poke his shoulder with a bony finger.Somebody had to pay for it, though.Thats the way of it.Somebody had to pay.Yes maam.He waited for more sermonizing, but she must have spoken her fill.The miles flew by, silent except for the trucks powerful engine.They passed the old Gantt cabin and then the road his brother lived on.A flock of starlings burst out of a tree and passed over them like a mob of miniature torpedoes with wings.Grannys old eyes followed them too.She didnt miss a thing.Funny things, birds.Fun to watch, as long as theyre flying free.She gave him a sly smile.That Granny Colfax, shes a strange old bird, aint she?I wouldnt say that.Sure you would.Everybody does.Im young on the inside, though.She peered out the window and rapped on it with her knuckles.Drop me at this next corner.Ill take you right to your friends door.No, no.Ill walk that last little bit.I do like my exercise.If thats what you want.Its what I want.Its how Ive lived this long.Exercise and right living.He pulled to the side of the road at the next corner.Ames Creek Road.Is this the right spot?It is.She reached for the door handle.Thank you for the lift.Hang on a second, Granny.Ive got a question.She squirmed toward the edge of the seat.Dont take too long, son.My friends waitin on me.Sean looked her right in the eye.She looked him right back.You have any opinions about Elliott Gantt?he asked.Course I do.A fine man, if not quite right in the head sometimes.I always loved to hear him play.Loved to sing along too.I mean, do you have any opinions about the rumors?That hes alive and well, walking around town at night?She laughed.Wandering around where he might get caught?No.Try the mountains.Needle in a haystack.Yes sir, and thatll keep you busy for a while.Even if the needles there, it doesnt mean anybodys gonna find it, he said.Aint that the truth.Now, I thank you for the ride.She grabbed the door handle.It didnt move.Sean leaned over and opened it for her.Be careful now, out there on the road.Dont you worry about me.She climbed out with her tote and gave him a smile as he reached over to close the door.Thank you, she hollered over the engines noise.Youre welcome.He made a U turn in the intersection, gathered speed, and headed back toward Keiths place.Granny Colfax wasnt the most aggravating woman in the worldthat honor belonged to Laurabut Granny ran a close second.Giving her a lift hadnt gleaned a bit of information.Sean parked in Keiths driveway and waved at the sweaty, smiling boys bouncing on the trampoline in the side yard of the split level house.Annie beckoned from the kitchen window.Sean walked into the bright, tidy house, greeted her, and went straight to the fridge for a longneck.He twisted the top off and raised the bottle high.Heres to all women everywhere.The good, the bad, and the impossible.Keith came around the corner, slung his arm around Annies shoulders, and gave Sean the once over.Which one is impossible?Laura?Sean returned the scrutiny.Keith was lucky.Except around the eyes, he resembled the Wilkins side of the family.His military bearing contrasted nicely with Annies happy go lucky personality too.They were good for each other.Yeah, Sean said.Laura.And Granny Colfax.Annie arched her eyebrows.Do tell.Im listening.He lifted the beer again.And heres to nosy women.Cheers.She snatched up a kitchen towel and snapped it at him.Youre lucky I love you like a brother, or Id knock that chip right off your shoulder.You would, wouldnt you?He sauntered out of the kitchen and onto the porch, the door banging shut behind him.He settled into a chair exactly like the ones on Lauras porch and his own.Half the population of Prospect owned at least one piece of Gantt furniture or a Gantt built guitar or banjo.He should have headed home.Instead, there he was, traipsing from Lauras house to Keiths and fuming about Elliott and that whole mess, whatever it was.Sometimes it seemed like an iceberg, with nine tenths of the menace submerged but waiting.A small plane droned across the sky like a bored insect.Its lights winked brighter as it neared the horizon where the sky had already darkened.Seans phone rang.Mrs.Anderson again.He turned off the phone and put it away, wanting to chuck it in the trash so nobody could track him down.Keith had the right idea.Hed never bought a cell phone.He refused to, no matter how much Annie nagged him to join her in modern times.Hed probably get along just fine with Granny Colfax.The door swung open.Keith came out with a Coke and sat in the other chair.He set the can on the wide wooden arm.When he popped the top, the hard surface amplified the sound, making Sean flinch.He hadnt been this jumpy in a long time.You might want to apologize to my wife, Keith said.
