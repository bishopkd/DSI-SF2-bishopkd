Rexs voice filled my head.The green brings out your eyes.I smiled and took the dress from the bed.Shauna knocked on the door once I was ready.My heels clacked on the floor and I opened the door.Octavius greeted me and walked into the house.I poked my head out and looked for Shauna.Where is Shauna?I put my hand on my hip.He had settle into Rexs recliner and closed his eyes.Oct had been with Shauna through quite a bit now.They were engaged, as we were, and set to marry with us.They had everything figured out, so I wasnt quite sure why he was now sitting at my house.I walked over to the couch and sat down, crossing one leg behind the other.Octavius?Can I help you?His eyes opened and he leaned forward towards me.Just making sure you are okay and I figured you would want an update.Plus I was told this morning I need to keep you safe, per Rex.My cheeks flushed a bit, of course Rex would do that.Well, update me.I crossed my arms and straightened my back.Rex knows who it will be but is forbidden to tell me.You know that right.So dont ask about that.He told me to keep you safe.He thinks Krystie might do something to even the competition.He isnt sure what but Shauna called to see if you had broke down yet.He smiled and pushed his hand through his growing hair.We both need to get ready though.I see you are pretty much ready.Do you want to grab a coffee while I get ready?I wasnt quite sure what to say.I nodded and grabbed my purse.Octavius stood up and opened the door to outside.Thank god he had brought his Suburban today instead of his convertible.I climbed in and glanced over at him.He had some gray hairs popping up in his hair, but not many.It was shoulder length now and pulled back past his shoulders.You okay?He said in a hushed voice before pulling from the driveway.I looked back at the house, this was the last time I would see it before being married.I smiled and looked back at the road.I just cant wait until this day is over.The black car rolled up and stopped outside the red front door.I could see the doors open and black shoes step out.I opened the door and leaned against the frame.It is odd seeing you out here.The man looked up at me and shrugged.His face had lines streaking out from around his gray eyes.His hair was a mottled mess but he was wearing a black suit which made it less obvious.He crossed his arms and pulled his sunglasses from his face.What do you want now?His deep voice pulled from the back of his throat.I touched his face gently, stroking down the side of his cheek.You are always so angry when I call you.Dont act like that.I smiled and waved him into the house.He stood next to the couch and glanced around the room.I put a hand on my hip and looked over at him.Are you okay?The man looked over at me and smiled a little bit.I am fine.Can we go now?I snatched up my purse and huffed to the car.He climbed in next to me and started the engine.We pulled out from the familiar house and onto the highway.The sky was clouding above us and the trees had already turned to fall colors.The oranges and yellows were filling the sky.We turned down a shaded road off the highway and sped down the dusty street.The trees bent over the road, creating a tunnel effect.The sun was trying to burst through in little patches.The sun was a bright yellow and orange swatch.I looked back over at the driver.His black aviators colored his eyes.His hair had been smoothed sometime while we were on the highway.I felt a knot in my stomach beginning.Today was going to be a very long day.We pulled up to a large victorian mansion.There were three other cars already there.The driver dropped me off at the door.Glancing up I noticed that the door was very large, even for my old eyes, and had black moulding accenting the pale blue color.The door was opened for me and I was guided to a room towards the back where the other visitors were waiting.I hope I have not kept you too long.It seems my driver of the day had no clue where he was going.I smiled and could see the other three relax, two men and one woman.We are waiting for Marcie anyway.One of the men smiled a crooked smile at me.I nodded and took a seat at the large, rectangular, glass table.I looked between each person, I hadnt seen them in forever, literally.The one who had spoken earlier was Stephyn.He had been my best subject when I taught school.He had grown up nicely.He was slightly shorter than I, his hair as dark as night.He had gained some weight also, but he had recently gained a wife.Apparently she was feeding him well.My head turned to the woman next to him.She was skinny and extremely tall.Felicity had a way with meetings, she usually turned them to herself, but today she was dressed in less provocative clothes and seemed to be keeping her mouth shut.The last gentleman sat on the other side of Felicity.Henri had been another friend of mine.He had been there when my drama happened with the Immortals so many years ago.He was short and pudgy with gray streaks protruding from behind his ears.I settled into my seat and heard a knock on the door.The two guards gave me a look.Once I nodded they opened them.Marcie stood in the door, her hair frantic and her face red.Do forgive the lateness.She said in a calm manner in a thick british accent and fixed her hair with a quick swoop of her hand.She took the empty seat and I let out a slow breath.Well we all know why we are here.Tomorrow is the day for the wedding but we must decide whom will be marrying Rex.Marcie raised her hand as she placed her purse on the table.Marge, why do we have to pick?I mean I know we are the elders but it seems quite obvious to me.The arranged marriage was ditched a long time ago.It wasnt because of Anya so I dont see why we must put her through this.A little tug was at my heart.Marcie was such a sweet woman she never wanted anybody to go through anything they didnt want to.I think it was because she had such a hard life herself.I opened my mouth to speak but was cut off by Stephyn.Well just because it didnt work out doesnt mean we just throw it out the window.The arranged marriage was put in place to create another, stronger group of immortals.We cant just through the idea out.But there are other people who can create a strong group without Rex.Look at the rest of them.Haku would make a perfect person for Cleo or even Violet.Although I think Cleo likes Enrique.Marcie smirked and looked back at me.Can we stop before we start up a huge fight?I put my arms up as Felicity was about to speak.We need to stop and think about this.Do we stop him from his chance at true love or do we honor the existing arrangement?Now before we start talking again I need you to write down who you want him to be with currently.It may change after but I just want to know your first opinion.Can we do that?I looked around and they all seemed to shrug.Slowly they hunched over their paper and scribbled their answers.I took the papers and looked at the two names written in different writings.I let out a small sigh.We have a lot to talk about.**    I sat down at the table in front of me.We were now at a small office building.Octavius sat down next to me and handed me a coffee from out of nowhere.I took it from him and sipped it, the strong spices of cinnamon and hot chocolate filled my mouth.Rex probably told him it was my favorite I smiled.So what are we doing?I whispered.It was a kind of place that you felt like you had to be quite in like a library.Oct stared ahead and leaned back in his chair, propping up his feet on the chair ahead of us.Waiting for Krystie and then waiting for Marge.My heart sank a little at the Krystie bit.I had to spend the day with her?At least Octavius would make it so we wouldnt kill each other.I took another sip of the hot chocolate, letting it wash away the unsettling feeling that was slowly overtaking me.What do you think will happen?I asked Oct.He was the closest friend to Rex.He would be the only one who would know anything about what was happening.He let out a long sigh and settled back into his chair.What do you think will happen?He asked as the door opened.I heard the clicking of heels and a plop of a purse on the table.I looked up and saw the one person in the world I didnt want to see.Krystie sat down on the edge of the table.She was wearing a knee length black dress.Her hair was curled and clung to her shoulders.What are you talking about?Her voice was so loud amongst the quiet room.Octavius glanced up at her and shook his head.Now dont start anything Krystie.This is supposed to be civil.We are just waiting until they come with the answer, deal?She nodded and opened up her laptop from which she had pulled from her rather large purse.I gave Oct a look and began to play with my phone.**    The voices rose from the small office.I grumbled to myself and put my hand to my head.Stephyn and Marcie were complaining to each other.Felicity and Henri were practically yelling at each other.I stomped my foot down.Enough of this.This is not getting us anywhere.They all stopped and looked up at me.It is true.Henris low voice cut through the sudden silence.He pushed his hand through his hair and let out a soft sigh.We need to take this seriously.This is for somebodies future.We need to think about which would make a better choice.If we are going to have Rex as the new leader than we need to judge based on that.Although if we decide somebody else should be the leader of this new pack we need to decide that first.I agree.We need to first decide whether Rex should be the leader of a new pack or no.Why should he or shouldnt he?So go around the room and we will talk about it?I looked around the room and everyone seemed to nod in agreement.So Stephyn, what about you?What do you think?He adjusted himself in his seat and put his hand to his lips.I dont think Rex wants it but I think he would be a good leader.Maybe we should pay our attention more to Octavius?He already has a group.We are trying to start a new group.Henri chimed in.True.I dont think we should put full responsibility on him.I am not sure who to put it on although.He spoke in a calm voice, looking over towards Henri.What about Cleo?I asked the group.She has been around for quite some time.Why must it always be a male who is the leader?I think she would make a perfect leader.She does get some very good aspects from her mother.Do we want to start training somebody new though?Felicity asked.Her voice wove through the crowd like velvet.It wouldnt be the first time we trained somebody new.Marcie added.We would have to find her a mate though.You cant just appoint somebody it without a mate.That is what the whole ceremony is about.She might already have a mate.I smiled.It seems she has been getting awfully close with Haku, which isnt such a bad thing.Haku?I didnt see that one coming.Felicity smirked.She had a way with drama, it always seemed to excite her.That would be utterly perfect.Stephyns voice rose from his seat.We all looked over at him wide eyed.Well it would make perfect sense.Haku is the quiet type, likes to be alone.If they were together then Cleo could run it as a leader and he could be the husband who sits calmly and lets her decide.His voice became raspy from his excitement.But why would we choose her?I mean she is eccentric and sometimes a bit cocky.Henri spoke up.I woman who is cocky is not always a bad thing.Felicity smiled.Maybe we should vote again?I personally am in more favor of Haku and Cleo running a new pack then making Rex marry somebody he doesnt love.I raised an eyebrow at her.Oh yes, Marge, I do believe in love.Just because I do not choose to live that way doesnt mean other people shouldnt.So new vote then.Raise your hand if you would like Cleo and Haku to run a new pack.I glanced around the room and smiled.Well that wasnt too hard.The door to the room burst open.I stood from my chair and before I could speak Rexs voice flooded the room.You must let me marry Anya.I do not want more than to be with her.I would rather be alone than be with Krystie and you must see that.He slammed his hands down on the table.I would give up everything to her.I would give up immortality if I meant every twitch I made wouldnt be watched.I want it to be me and her, not all of this bullshit.Just us.Felicity let out a cackle and all of us soon were giggling.I put my hand on Rexs shoulder.You could have just asked if we had an answer.He turned to me, his face red and a few beads of sweat running down his forehead.He pulled me aside from the group which had taken up to talking about normal life now.There is a problem.He hushed his voice.I made a face at him but he held up his hand in protest.We cant go through the ceremony.Well, how come?I whispered, turning him and I from the group.He looked up at me, his eyes aflame with blue and black colors.Shes pregnant.**    The time seemed to be crawling by.I had found a small library next to the office and grabbed a book entitled In The Stone Circle.It looked decent so I had started reading it.Only a few pages in I found myself bored, as I always was with books.I blew out a sigh through my nostrils and leaned back in my chair to count the ceiling tiles.What are you huffing about?I heard the nails on chalkboard voice call from her laptop.I glanced over at her and then back up at the ceiling.So you are going to ignore me too?You know I am surprised you arent at work.Yeah, shouldnt you be at work?I am pretty sure I denied you today off.What did you do call out?I smirked at my comment and she found herself without a comeback.Octavius let out a soft snore and shook in his seat, waking up.God this is so boring.He stood up and stretched, his shoulders and knuckles cracking in unison.Shauna doesnt freak when you crack your knuckles?I raised my eyebrows over at him.He shook his head no and sat back down.She always screams at me.Maybe it is because ladies arent supposed to do gross things like that.Krystie chimed in.I opened my mouth to respond but Octavius was awake now, I should probably keep quiet.I felt my stomach rumble and looked over at Oct.I am starving.He nodded and made a soft grunting noise.Pizza will be here soon.I groaned and put my head down on the table.Today couldnt go any slower and it was just getting worse.I was starving, I wanted a nap and couldnt get either.I turned my attention back towards the book and started to read again.Tapping my foot against the table leg I heard the doorbell to the office ring.Octavius pushed himself up from his chair and opened the door.The second he did I could smell the warm melting cheese and garlic on the hot fresh pizza.My stomach did a flip as he paid and put it down in front of us.I took a piece and began eating even though it was very hot still.I could feel the oozing cheese and tomato sauce as I bit into the pizza.I leaned back in my chair, a little happier than before.Krystie took a piece and placed it on a paper plate that Oct had provided.My phone chirped and I looked down at it.There was a text from Shauna.I smiled and opened it.I hope everything is going well.I texted back and looked over at Octavius.What is Shauna doing?I dont know why?He finished his first piece of pizza and grabbed another one.She is texting me.I smile and he checked his phone.He let out a low grumble and flipped open his phone, walking out of the office.Hello?I heard his gruff voice.He closed the door behind him and I let out a sigh.It was just Krystie and I now.She better not start anything.So you finally ready to figure out what is happening?I bet that is a call from Rex now.I bit my tongue so she wouldnt respond.Well?Not talking to me today I see?That works out better for me anyway.Then I can just talk.I like the sound of my voice better anyway.I scoffed and looked back at my phone.I really wish today would just fly by but it wasnt.Octavius opened the door and waved to me.I got up from the chair and walked out to the porch.I looked up at Octavius with a worried expression.What is wrong?He scratched his beard and looked over at the door to make sure Krystie wasnt going to follow us.He put his arm around my shoulder and pulled me into a slow walk.You need to know a couple things about what is going to happen.I nodded and walked in step with him.It had started to lightly rain outside, the sky turning a mix of blue and gray just like Rexs eyes.Somebody is going to be upset at the end of this, you need to be ready just in case that is you okay?I honestly dont know what is going to happen but I have a feeling they will pick you.Just be ready okay?He hugged me and then withdrew his arm from around my shoulders.I know you are upset about being with Krystie all day.Thats why we are walking.He smiled down at me and motioned to a bench we were standing by.We had made our way towards a small park, three benches stood in a row near each other.I sat down and looked up at the clouds, they were swirling around each other.Octavius sat next to me, the bench sagging beneath our weight.We sat there, quiet, for quite some time.I watched as the clouds moved across the sky, the rain getting heavier and then falling lighter once more.The trees buckled under the heavy wind that was picking up.I already know in my heart he is mine.I whispered, keeping my eyes on the trees swaying ahead of us.Their leaves were falling down onto the bare ground.I know that, so I will be fine.I smiled and leaned back in against the bench.I pulled my jacket closer around me and let out a sigh.I know, that is all that needs to happen.Octavius turned towards me, putting his finger against my cheek and turning my head towards him.You know he loves you more than anything.I nodded and looked up into his eyes.They looked like a storm like Rexs but different colors.His were darker colors and they swirled together in a different fashion.He smiled and took his hand away from mine.You know I will be here for everything too.He said in a hushed voice.No matter what happens, I will be here to help.Thank you Oct.A crack of thunder burst through the clouds above us.A small yelp escaped my lips as it almost hit a tree near us.Maybe we should get back.Octavius pulled an umbrella from his pocket and opened it.Are you crazy?If it is lightning it could hit us!He laughed and put the umbrella away.I pulled the hood of my jacket up over my head and hunched my shoulders so I wouldnt get wet.It seemed like such a long walk back compared to the walk to the benches in the first place.Things kept filtering through my mind.What would happen?I hated not knowing the unknown.I suppose every person did though.What if he did choose Krystie?What would I do?I wasnt sure of anything.My stomach rumbled again even though we just ate.I wrapped my arms around myself and walked a bit faster.My head had begun to pound, my stomach twisting in agony.I ran towards the house but couldnt make it.I double over, pressing my palm against the house and saw the remnants of my pizza staring at me.The look of it made me sick once more, my stomach writhing in pain.A cold sweat filled my forehead and I felt like I was about to cry.I heard Octs voice behind me as he ran up.Anya?Are you okay?He put his hand on my back and rubbed it gently.I coughed a few more times and closed my eyes.God.I whispered.I pushed myself away from the house and touched my forehead.I dont know what came over me.I just felt sick.Oct took my elbow and ushered me to a chair outside the building we were staying in.I slumped down and took a few deep breaths.My stomach was still doing flips but at least I didnt feel sick anymore.I wonder if it was because I was nervous, or what?**    I looked at Rex, my eyes wide.She is what?Pregnant.A wide smile filled his face.We are pregnant.I smiled and pulled him into a hug.Congratulations!I stopped, my arms still around him.She doesnt know does she?He shook his head no and I smiled still.Well that is two bouts of good news today.He cocked his head to the right.I leaned forward and whispered.You dont have to marry Krystie.I knew I could count on you Marge.He pulled me into a hug once more.I smiled and hugged him close.Deep down I knew something like this would happen but I didnt know if I could believe it.I took him by the shoulders and pulled him to the meeting room.All heads turned toward us as we walked in.So I have good news, well more good news.I waved my arms in Rexs direction.Rex and Anya are pregnant.The faces staring at me smiled and I saw Marcie begin clapping.The whole room began to join in a ruckus.Rex laughed as Stephyn pulled him into a hug.I smiled and sat down in my chair.But Rex, how do you know?He withdrew from the crowd a little bit and pulled up a chair.Each person resumed their seat, looking over at Rex.He ran his hand over his bald head, his eyes sparkling.Well she has been acting a little bit off.She kept getting morning sickness but blaming it on something else.She also...He sighed a content sigh.She has that glow to her you know?She just looks even more beautiful each day.Something about her skin looks different, a good different though.He beamed looking at all of us.Marcie spoke up.Does she know?His smile kind of faded, his lips going flatter.He shook his head.I couldnt bear to tell her until I figured out what happened.He looked up at me.What is the verdict?You are safe to marry whomever you choose.I smiled and he shot up from her seat.I guess I should go tell her!Thank you everyone.And with that he was gone.The rest of us looking around, still a little dazed at what had just happened.Well I do thank each and everyone of you.Usually our meetings arent this ecstatic.Everyone seemed to get up and leave at the same time.I stayed back, pushing papers around until they all fit into my purse.I heard a knock on the door frame and looked up.Jack stood there, his scar barely showing in the dusk light outside.He smiled and walked over to me.Busy day?He whispered, his gruff voice so nice to hear after the high pitched whining I had heard all day.I nodded and he kissed my forehead.But you did the right thing and that is all that mattered.I was so worried Jack.I wasnt sure I could persuade them to let him marry who he wanted.It was hard at first but someone brought up putting someone else in charge.That thought never occurred to me and it actually worked out great.I smiled up at him.Rex and Anya are pregnant.He raised an eyebrow and I thought I saw a flicker of silver through his dark green eyes.Then you did the great thing.He smiled and pulled me close, holding me against him.They remind me of us.I whispered against his chest.He nodded.That is why you were perfect for this job.**    Rex had hopped into his car, his smile still plastered on his face.He couldnt believe anything.He had to hold everything together.He pulled out his phone before pulling the car onto the highway.He could feel his heartbeat in his throat.He turned the air conditioner up to high to help him stop his nervous sweat.He put the phone to his ear and heard it ring three times.Hello?Came a sweet voice.Cleo and Haku had had their lips pressed together before she answered the phone.He almost didnt let her but when they had seen who it was he finally broke down.Amazing news.You sitting down?His voice was full of happiness.She smiled and put the phone on speakerphone so Haku could hear it as well.She was sitting in his lap on the couch at her apartment.She looked over at him before looking back at the phone.I am assuming you and Anya are getting married?She squealed a little bit.His laughter cut through her voice.Actually no but there is better news.We are pregnant and you and Haku are to run the new group instead of me!She went to speak but her throat caught.Her and Haku?The elders didnt even ask them.She knew she would be fine with it because she was a strong leader but Haku, what did he think?She turned her head to look at him and he was already looking over at her.His smile was huge, his bright white teeth seemed to glitter and his eyes were wide.Us?A team?He whispered before pulling her close and kissing her.She wasnt quite sure how she was feeling but he made her stomach relax and a warm sensation filled her.That is amazing Rex!Congrats.Let me know how Anya takes everything okay?He said goodbye and she closed the phone.She looked back over at Haku.Do you think you can manage to run a pack with me Haku?I mean in all honesty.Dont lie to me.He brushed her hair from her face and ran his fingertips down her jawline.She felt goosebumps rise on her arms.I wouldnt want to make a pack with anyone else.He whispered.She smiled and hugged him tightly against her.This was the best day ever.Rex still had a smile plastered on his face as he pulled into the place where Octavius, Krystie and I were staying.I noticed his car and stood up.Octavius stood up and looked at the car.Stay here okay?I nodded but stayed standing up, wrapping my arms around my waist.The Nova purred as he pulled it into the driveway and turned it off.He had finally fixed it up.He had painted it blue and it matched his eyes perfectly.Octavius and Rex exchanged hugs and I could tell he was happy about something, I just wasnt sure what.I felt butterflies in my stomach, assuming he had been told we would marry.I felt a small twinge of doubt but didnt let it get to me.My stomach was still doing flips from when I had gotten sick earlier.Octavius moved to the side and Rex made his way towards me with long strides.I stepped down the steps and raced towards him.The wind swirled around me, blowing my hair back from my face.We met halfway, he had broken into a run also.I felt his warm lips on mine, one arm around my waist and his hand up in my hair.The doubt in my stomach washed away and was placed by a comforting feeling.I suppose this means we are getting married?I whispered as he stopped kissing me.He wrapped his arms around my waist and just held me, without answering my question.His face was still, no expression crossed it like it usually did.Rex?He leaned forward, his lips touching my earlobe.No, we are not getting married.I tried to pull away but his arms wrapped tighter around me.No?No!She won?Why was he kissing me like this?Why would he do this to me?One last kiss?I struggled a little more and stopped as he held me so tight I almost couldnt breathe.Stop doing that, you might hurt the baby.I pulled away slowly and this time he let me.I looked up into his eyes, my mouth open.The...baby?I choke out.Finally he smiled and I saw his deep blue eyes, a calm blue with no clouds covering anywhere.Im...we are...I slumped against him.Pregnant?I was pregnant.We are pregnant.He whispered and pulled me close.I could smell the musty smell of the outdoors on his clothes.I didnt know what to say, a minute ago I was worried he wouldnt marry me.I was worried that he had picked her over me but in reality it was because I was pregnant.We would start a family together.I felt a tear trickle down my cheek as I buried my face into his chest.Did you know?He asked in a calm manner.He tilted my head up with his finger and kissed me gently.I shook my head no.How did you know?I whispered.Just something about you.You changed.Not a bad change either.He smiled and I still couldnt get over it.Here I was, with the man I loved, and I was pregnant.Nothing could top this.I looked over at where Octavius had been, but he was no longer there.Do you need to tell Krystie?I whispered, feeling a slight pity for the girl.That is what Oct is here for.Dont worry.It is just you and me now.I felt his lips against mine.My body reacted to his, hugging him tightly.I could feel everything in his kiss, love, passion and being strong at the same time.Since I met Rex it had been a hectic time, but it was all worth it in the end.Here I was, happy as could be, with no cares in the world.I was pregnant.The wind whipped around us once more and I knew then that good always will come out of bad, sometimes you just need to experience rock bottom in order to pull yourself up and start again.I was so glad I took the chance and met so many great people while being with him.While being with my husband to be.While being with my babys father.Nothing could change who I was and what I had overcome.He pulled away slightly and looked into my eyes.I love you Anya.I love you too, Rex.I whispered and closed my eyes.
