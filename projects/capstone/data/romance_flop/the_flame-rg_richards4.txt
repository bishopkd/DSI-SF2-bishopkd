He then goes over to the bar and puts ice cubes into a glass when he hears Marys voice and her message.Robert stops fixing his drink and rushes to the machine to play the message again.He turns the machine off after the message plays for the third time and stands there wondering what the message meant.Does she not want to see him?Why is she telling him to phone Mrs.Cartwright?He thought they made a connection, was he wrong?An image of a fierce protector chasing a man with a bottle plays in his head.Robert leaves his plate on the table and takes a bottle of Jack Daniels upstairs to bed.9: The Check      Wednesday morning:      Mary sits at her desk making the final changes for next weekends Doctors conference.She listens to a knock at the door.Come in Barb.Whats up?asks Barbara.Can you go by and check on Jill for me?Of course, I was going to your place on my lunch break.What time will you take lunch?A little after eleven oclock, I have to wait until Betty gets back, she left at ten.Take Jill some dessert.She told me she would order Chinese.Ok, anything else?No, I am going to wrap this up and then I will be out of the office.If I am not back by 1 oclock call Lester and have him come in early and cover for me.Okay.All right, Barbara closed the door behind her as she left.Twenty minutes later there was a knock on Marys door.Come in.Mrs.Cartwright stalked into Marys office.I thought we had an arrangement concerning donations.The pink face meant trouble.What do you mean?Mr.Tyler called me this morning saying that he received a message on his machine to call me.Why would he need to call me?I thought maybe he needed more information, I dont know the particulars of  Mrs.Cartwright shouts before Mary can get her lie out.Your job!Your only job is to get one damn donation and you want to shirk your duty.If I dont get that donation by the end of today, your probation officer will hear from me.Mrs.Cartwright whirls slamming the door with enough force to knock Marys favorite picture from the wall.Blood rushes from Marys face to leave her cold.She stares at the fallen picture, mortified, unable to stop shaking.Tears pool as she searches for a solution.She closes her eyes for breathing exercises to no avail.Mary reaches into her desk drawer to seek comfort from an old friend: Jack Daniels.She chugs one of the mini bottles from last night.Mary rises, grabs her purse, and rushes out the office with a head of steam.She will take care of the problem right now.Mary raps on Mr.Tylers door.His forehead wrinkles at the sight of her.Come in.What brings you back out here?Im sorry but we are having a mix up and I need to get everything cleared up.Please have a seat.Thank you.Mary waits for him to sit then begins.Mr.Tyler, I need to get your donation today to tally the totals and determine if we have reached our goal and can start construction.Of course, Miss Lake.How much do you need to begin construction?You see that is the problem, I am flying blind.I was told to get your donation and bring it to Mrs.Cartwright.She is the one who has the exact figures so I dont know the totals.I suppose the usual amount that you give will be sufficient.Robert lowers his head.He rises to walk behind the bar to fix a drink.Do you want anything?No, sir, but thank you for offering.Robert plants his drink on the coffee table when he returns.Are you a vegetarian, Miss Lake?Excuse me?Are you a vegetarian?No.Robert checks his wristwatch.Please come with me.He leads her out the living room and into the kitchen.Robert grabs a bundle off the kitchen table and walks outside to the patio where a grille smolders at the decks edge.Its lunchtime, Miss Lake, and I havent eaten all day.Im going to have a steak.I hope you will do me the honor of joining me for lunch.Mary needs her donation.Her fingers clench on both hands.She feels warmth and wetness prickling on her skin.Controlling her breathing becomes a battle.She hesitates in giving an answer.Finally, she nods.I dont mean to blindside you, Miss Lake, but I really want to talk to you.He points to the kitchen door, could you be a good sport and play along?I forgot the plates; could you please look inside the cabinet by the refrigerator and get them for me?Mary nods then rushes to the door.She slows to make it less obvious.A weight lifts from her chest as she enters the kitchen.She stops to feel her heart before going to the cabinets.Mary takes down two plates.She turns them over and just as she thinks: fine china.These could not possibly be the plates.She sets them aside to search again.All fine china.She grabs the two plates she initially found and turns toward the door.Mary views Robert at the grille from the kitchen window.He is tall, dark, and handsome.Mary takes a breath, time to search for the bad.She keeps telling herself that something is not right about this man and she has to find out what it is.Thinking he might be getting suspicious about her whereabouts Mary returns with the plates.Are these the plates you wanted?I looked for others and only found china.Yes those are all that I have.How do you like your steak, rare or well done?Well done, please.The ocean catches her attention.The house rests in the perfect spot.To get up every morning and hear the sound of the ocean or go for a swim must be heaven.Not good at small talk, Mary searches for something to say.Talking about the view would be too silly and obvious.How long have you lived here, Mr.Tyler?Please call me Robert.He fans a cloud of smoke while turning the steaks.Three years this December.A little old woman owned this house.She hated big developers, called them land rapists.He drops the lid on the grille and washes his hands with a towel.You see that pier down there?Robert points north to a pier off in the distance.She owned all the land from here to that pier.She signed over all the land to a foundation that can never sell the land to developers.Her one wish is for the land to remain the way it is with no hotels, condos, or apartment buildings.The only thing on the other side of the beach is a park in her honor.Then shes dead?Yes, she died shortly after setting her dream in motion.She had breast cancer and she is the one who started the Sunny Isles Breast Cancer Foundation.The foundation owns the land.I didnt know that.I didnt think so.Mrs.Cartwright is on the board and I know her but she doesnt know me.She is one of those throwbacks who think all minorities are lazy and look alike.She pretends not to recognize me or at least I hope thats the case.So her not wanting to talk with you is personal?Four years ago I volunteered in a nursing complex; I guess you would call it a long term care facility.I met Mrs.OConnor there.She is the previous owner of this house.I talked with her daily, not out of pity but simply because she was fascinating and led a dream life.We got to know each other and for a time she gained enough strength to move back into this house.A small group visited and kept her company.She thought if she continued to gain strength she could die in this house.So she transferred everything but this house to the foundation in a living trust.I did not know it but Mrs.Cartwright was talking to her constantly trying to get her to sell the house to her.She knew the old battle ax had no intention of living here; she just wanted to make a quick sell to developers.Mrs.OConnor, under her doctors care, got her last wish and died in her own home in her own bed.She left me the option to buy this house in her will.The contract stated that I could not sell to developers for 99 years, if I tried, the house would revert to the foundation.My mortgage payment is $25 per month, so I make a donation to the Cancer Foundation every year.She left me a letter saying how much she trusted me to do the right thing and protect her legacy.The letter also told me a few private items about some of her so called friends.She wanted to let them know that their pledges to her did not stop at her death.She loved the beach and the ocean and wanted them to remain unspoiled.She sounds like quite a lady.A grand lady.Robert opens the grille again to check on the steaks.Miss Lake do you mind going into the kitchen and getting the steak sauce and silverware off the table?He plates the steaks while Mary retrieves the needed items.Mary returns and places the silverware at two places on the small table.She places the steak sauce in the middle of the table next to the pole that holds the umbrella up in the center of the small table.Mary takes the seat facing the ocean.Robert brings over the T bones.Oh, I forgot my drink, would you care for anything?I have all kinds of juices and water if you dont want anything from the bar.Mary wrestles with her answer.Whatever you are having will be all right.Good, Ill be right back.Mary reflects on her day and what has happened up to now.Once again this man has surprised her and that is unusual.Her sixth sense has let her down, or has it?This is the troubling predicament for Mary, trust her senses and avoid this man like the plague or take a chance and possibly get burned.Mary slathers steak sauce absentmindedly.She cuts her steak and takes a bite.The shocking deliciousness curls her lips in a pleasant smile.Robert returns with their drinks.Here you are.Thank you.Robert glances at her cut steak.Heat spreads across Marys face.Im sorry.I started without you.It is delicious.No problem, Miss Lake, Im glad you like it.Mary wipes her mouth with her small napkin, if only it were large enough to wipe her red face.She returns it to her lap.She gulps with her head down.It is Mary, please call me Mary.I feel as if you are talking about my mother when you say Miss Lake.Her eyes make a careful slide upward to gauge his reaction.Im sorry Miss ...Mary.I dont want you to feel uncomfortable or stressed out.Is your mother still living?Mary takes a sip from her drink, Donna.She is still living.She and my father, Dell, have been married for forty yearshigh school sweethearts.Shes a homemaker in Jacksonville.She loves the beach too but never goes that much because of arthritis in her legs and arms.Thats a shame, is she in treatment?Robert takes another drink then cuts a piece of steak and begins eating.They will be on Medicare next year, until then they go sporadically to doctors.She has never had a job in her life and he was forced to retire but cant draw social security until next year.Regret fills her as soon as the words escaped her treacherous lips.She never tells her personal business to strangers and for some unknown reason she is blathering to this stranger.Mary takes another sip vowing not to reveal anything else.Finish your meal and get your donation and leave!Im sorry to hear of their troubles.Do you get a chance to visit often?No.Mary says then shuffles an extra large piece of steak in her mouth.Surely he will not ask her to talk with her mouth full.The party on Friday night, you said you were going?She chews, nods, then chews more.I hope to see you there.Most of the crowd that goes to those affairs is like Mrs.Cartwright.I would like to look out and see a friendly face.He smiles trying to induce her to smile back.Mary flashes a half smile.She needs to get the focus off her and back on him.She swallows.Mrs.OConnor, tell me more, please.Well, believe it or not, your boss, Mrs.Belmont, is her half sister.They didnt meet until Beverly was 35.Her fathers will acknowledged one half sister and a half brother who was in jail.He left the hotel to Mrs.Belmont and the land to Beverly.Both ladies were married when he died.He lived with Mrs.OConnor and her mother but always found a way to keep up with Mrs.Belmont in secret.The women became friends after five years of litigation that ended in a stalemate.Mrs.OConnor lost her husband during the litigation and never remarried.She remained devoted to Mother Earth until the day she died and believes that transforming the land is monstrous.God put its natural beauty here so all could enjoy it.Robert pauses to finish his drink.He wants to talk more with Mary but is getting the idea that she is too guarded and he has to be careful with her.Miss Lake, are you enjoying working at the hotel?Mary holds up her finger.She swallows hard then washes it down with her drink.She wipes her mouth with her napkin.Its Mary.My job changes daily so I cant fall into a routine.I love it.Robert wants to press more but dares not risk confrontation.Well, Mary, shall we go inside so I can write you a check?Mary smiles and nods.She eyes the last of her drink.Robert pulls her chair out for her.Thank you.Please have a seat, Mary.I will be right back.He journeys upstairs.Mary sits.Before too long her nerves start bothering her.She glances up the stairs then sprints to the bar.A shot will not do it; she up ends the bottle of whiskey.Satiated, she returns to her seat, wiping her mouth.Robert returns with a check after a few more minutes.Im sorry but as soon as I got upstairs my private line rang and I had to take the call.I didnt mean to keep you waiting.Its okay, Im fine.Well, here you are, Mary.He hands her an envelope with a check inside.Thank you, Mr.Tyler.I will get this to Mrs.Cartwright right away.Mary picks up her bag and puts the check inside.Good bye, Mr.Tyler.You have a good evening.Are we back to being formal, Miss Lake?He asked.I thought we were making progress.The hairs on the back of her neck prickle.A wave of heat rushes over her.Exactly what kind of progress did you want to make?she eyes him as her mouth separates from the rest of her body, declaring its freedom.It would fight for her, defend her.I am not a whore trading sex for donations if thats what you had in mind.Shame ripples across her chest, but it is too late, more words fight their way to the surface to defend and declare their freedom.Hell, you tell one bullshit story about some old bitch and you think I am going to spread my legs.Honey, it will take a lot more than a steak and story to get me.Im out of here.A head of steam propels her forward.As she moves, regret etches itself into her features.She cannot believe what happened.It was like hearing the words come from someone elses mouth but it was her saying those things.As she walks, she relives one of her screaming sessions with her mother.Mary what the fuck is wrong with your crazy ass.I swear to god you run hot and cold at a moments notice.One minute you are happy and smiling, the next you are cursing up a blue streak and getting violent.You keep this crazy shit up and I am going to have your stupid ass locked away with your crazy Aunt Ruthie Mae.Her mother would then storm off saying, I swear to god you must have a split personality.Something is really wrong with you girl!Mary turns her feet in the hot sand as she looks out at the road.She closes her eyes, squishing her face.Barbara has the car checking on Jill.She took a cab to Robert Tylers home.Mary reaches into her pocket hoping she has her phone, she is not about to go back inside that house.Fuck!No phone.Mary closes her eyes once more to gather her strength.She takes off walking up the path to the road away from the house.She wants to put as much distance between the house and her as possible.This is an isolated road so she will have to walk several blocks just to get back into traffic to be picked up.Marys heel breaks in the road and she gets so mad she wants to cry.Mary has no choice.She turns and walks back to the house and sits on the front porch.She replays her options, perhaps she missed something.Robert feels his chest tightening as Mary exits.He sits for a moment then heads for the bar.Sometimes a good drink helps the mind.He notices an empty bottle and it becomes clear.He reasons that Mary has trouble with alcohol.What is he going to do now?Mary is so beautiful with her long flowing hair.She is a jewel: a piece of coal ready for the pressure that will make it a diamond.Should he let her go?Should he take the chance?Robert knows the best thing for him to do is to find a new woman but he cant.His heart has betrayed him and fastened on Mary.He has to go after her.Robert goes to the window.He sees Mary sitting on his porch.His heart pounds in his chest, he hasnt lost yet.Robert rushes to the door.He stops, he cant mess this up.With a breath, he opens the door.He walks out on the porch and looks at Mary.Mary refuses to acknowledge his presence.Robert turns.He goes inside without a word.Mary closes her eyes.If only the floor could open and swallow her.There is no doubt in her mind that the fault is hers, but how to fix this?Everyone turns his or her back on her, why should this man be any different.Mary is about to give up hope and bawl her eyes out when she hears a noise.She looks to her left to see a car come from around the side of the house.The car stops in front of her.Robert gets out and comes around and without a word opens the passenger door.Mary climbs to her feet.She walks to the car, sits in the passengers seat, and folds her hands in her lap.She pinches her face, hardening it to hold back her tears.Robert drives her back to the hotel in silence.Mary gets out of the car and goes inside without a word.10: Confession      Wednesday evening:      That night Barbara and Mary journey to the Hunting Spot, a combination bar with small dance floor and restaurant.Jill joins them for a late dinner looking much better.They head for the all you can eat buffet.Jill says, The Chinese food I had earlier was awful, Im starving.Hey, Mare, what is that in front of you?Mary pokes at the food in the tray with her fork.It looks like crab meat to me, you want to try some of it?Nope, not me.No mystery meat tonight.Jill turns to Barbara in line behind her.Barb, you feeling lucky tonight?Not me, that kind of looks like burnt tofu.Barbara observes a woman refilling some trays.Excuse me, what is this?The woman looks.Imitation crab meat.I wouldnt try it if I were you; the girl that made it is the worst cook I have ever seen.Whoa, thanks for the heads up, says Barbara.I guess I will stick with the pot roast, no, on second thought Im going to have the fried chicken and get some fries to go with it.Barbara shovels food on her plate.Mary has no idea of what she wants.She cannot get the days events out of her head.Mary ventures to the soup counter for a bowl of clam chowder.She walks back to the table.She smiles at Barbara, this will do it for me.Jill is the last to sit.She has a plate full of meat.Jill twists in her seat, I couldnt make up mind so I got a sampler; polish sausage, baked chicken, short ribs, and pork chops.Anybody want any?The women shake their heads.Jill dives into her food.Barbara cannot decipher the look on Marys face.Mary, you need to talk about it.We can give you a different point of view.Stop stewing and talk.Leave her alone, she doesnt need to talk about anything, says Jill.I am the one who has psyche classes, not you, says Barbara.Mary, you have to talk it out or it will eat you up inside.You will end up bitter like this one over here.Barbara jabs her fork at Jill and sneers.Jill is not about to let that get by her.You flunked out of college if I remember correctly.Mary, dont listen to her, says Barbara.Misery loves company and she wants you just as sad and pathetic as she is right now.I can help; you can use a different perspective on this.Mary stops stirring her soup and puts her fork down.I made a fool of myself again.I went to Mr.Tylers house and we had lunch together on his back patio.That sounds good, what the hell is wrong with that?asks Barbara.Nothing.We were doing ok, he told me about how he got the house and something about Mrs.Cartwright that I didnt know.Mary sighs, picking up her fork.Come on, Mare, get to the problem and stop beating around the bush, says Jill.God damn it will you two give me a break?Shit!Just listen to what I am saying, all right?The problem started after we finished lunch, everything was fine until then.It was perfect.I found a man that I liked and I could talk to.The problem is not him it is me.I always fuck it up.Mary threw her fork in her soup and shoved it aside.I dont even know why I got this, I dont want it, I cant even remember the last time I had this stuff.Relax, Mare, it might not be that bad, says Jill.She grasps Mary by the hand to help calm her down.Tell us what went wrong.Mary takes a deep breath and exhales.When he went upstairs to get the check I got nervous.I have never met a man like him before, I dont know what it is about him but it makes me nervous.I want to talk to him but at the same time he just scares me.I dont know whether to stay or to run so I took a drink to try and calm my nerves.Mary hit herself on the forehead several times, stupid, stupid, stupid.How could I be so stupid?Mary stays silent for a minute then says, When he came back down he gave me the check in a sealed envelope.And for some reason I thought he did it because he didnt trust me and didnt want me to see what amount he wrote.Then he said something about ...I dont even remember what he said, something about the two of us making progress and then going backwards or something.Well anyway I took it the wrong way, like he was trying to proposition me for a bigger donation or something and I just went off.I told him I wasnt a whore and he could shove his donation up his ass.Well maybe not exactly that, I was confused but I was so mad I think I cussed him out and just stormed off.Mary shakes her head trying to un jumble her thoughts.As hard as she tries she just cannot recall the days events in their proper order.Oh, Mary.Barbara says with a long sigh.When you start drinking you do say some crazy shit.But it doesnt sound too bad, what happened next?I hauled ass out of there and forgot I took a cab.I tried to walk in the road but I was wearing three inch heels and broke one so I turned around and went back to the house and sat on the porch.Mare, you didnt go in?Jill asked, raising higher in her chair.No.Like a little child a sat there fuming.He must have seen me.He opened the door and looked at me, then went back inside without a word.Jill puffed up, that bastard, he didnt help you?Marys face broke into an unexpected smile.Just the opposite.I heard a car and saw him come around the side of the house.He stopped in front of me and opened the passengers door.I got in and he drove me back to the hotel.Thats good, Mary, whats so bad about that?Barbara patted her shoulder.He didnt say a word to me.Not when he opened the front door, not when he opened the passengers side door, and not when he drove me back to the hotel.I like him but I keep fucking it up.I know he thinks I am the craziest bitch on the face of the earth, and hes right.Marys face fell.All right, lets take an objective look at this, says Barbara.He drove you back, was he angry, did he look like he was mad?I dont know.I never looked at him.Mare, says Jill, you are crazy.How do you get yourself into these things?Just answer one question; do you want a relationship with this man?I do but I dont.Im confused about the whole situation.If you didnt like the man so much it wouldnt matter.Barbara says to Mary.You have poor interpersonal relationship skills, you always have.You chase away men that you like and screw around with guys that you could care less about.Hey, Miss Slut Number One, that is my best friend you are talking about!Jills face blooms cherry red.You are in no position to question anybodys relationship skills, you dont have any.What the fuck is your problem.Mary wants honesty so she can get some help.Stop trying to treat her like a baby.A glint mushrooms in Barbaras eyes.Even if she was a baby, she wouldnt suck from your tits.Barbara smirks and then gives Jill the finger.She knows Jill well and can go tit for tat with her any day of the week.Stop you two.If either of you can offer something helpful then do so, if not, lets just be quiet and eat.The women call a truce and everyone eats in silence.Later, when they finish eating, Barbara says, Lets go to the bar.Not me, you two go ahead, says Mary.Thats all right, Im not feeling it either.Barb you go ahead and get hammered, I might just join you later.Dont shut the bar down, all right, smirks Jill.Barbara climbs to her feet.Ill be with that cutie pie over there.See you later.Mary gives a wayward smile to Jill.She sighs and covers her face, talking through her hands.Jilly, I am so messed up I dont even know what is going on anymore.Mare, like a speeding bullet it has finally hit you, says Jill.What?Youve fallen, and I mean hard.No.I havent.Mare, you have fallen in l o v e.  Stop fighting against it and let it happen.You are crazy.That is impossible.This is real life, not a movie.I know nothing about the man and besides, we havent even ...you know.Had sex?Mare, you can fall in love without having slept with a man.Have you forgotten about love at first sight?It happens, Mare.Stop acting like you are immune to life.Try being happy for once.Barbs fat ass is right about one thing, all the years I have known you, you have never been in a long term relationship.Risk your heart and go for it.He sounds like a good guy.Hell, you could do a lot worse.Jill punches her in the arm and laughs.
