A loud crash echoed through me and tore me from my restless sleep.My eyes fluttered open as I looked toward where the noise came from.A head popped out from behind a door and a smile appeared on the mans face.Sorry, he mouthed before walking over to the bed where I was laying.He was tall, maybe six feet, and bald but with brilliant blue eyes.He was shirtless and tattoos covered his arms and a majority of his chest.He was wearing rectangle glasses and black jeans that seemed to accent his body perfectly.I pulled the covers up to shield my naked body and gave a weak smile as he sat down on the bed next to me.Sorry for waking you up.He spoke in a soft voice, brushing the hair from my cheek as he spoke.I pulled my body into a sitting position and as I pressed my back against the wall I felt a shoot of pain in my back.I tried to hide the pain that rose in my throat but he must have seen my eyes wrinkle for he held his hand out.Let me see.He smiled and I sighed before leaning forward.Hows it look Doc?I smiled and put my hand gently into his.His fingers curled around mine and his other hand traced a circle on my back.The torn skin had been fine the night before but hurt slightly today.I just hoped it had stopped bleeding.It looks fine honestly.I can get you a cold pack if you want?He smiled and kissed my lips.I shook my head no for the pain was going away anyway.The large tattoo spread across my back was the largest piece I had gotten yet.It made my first tattoo look like an ant in the floor.It was a large pirate ship sailing across the ocean.Scrawled on the bow of the ship was Ohana, the hawaiian word for family.The night before I had gone into his shop for a tattoo.One thing led to another and here I am in his bed the next morning.I still couldnt believe what had happened.Only snippets filled my mind, his calloused hands holding mine, his lips sending shivers throughout my body and my hair pulled back into a messy bun.It had been four years since my husband had died and this was my first encounter that lasted more than a one night stand.I mean he was making me breakfast, that counts as more than a one night stand...right?He smiled once more, that handsome smile that you knew he had used on many women.Are you hungry?He got up and returned to the kitchen.Reluctantly I got up from the bed and only found his shirt so pulled it on.It landed mid thigh but at least it covered a majority of me.I rubbed my eyes and pulled my hair back before reaching the kitchen.Bathroom?I questioned and he pointed to the right where a small hallway was.Walking down the hallway were various pictures I could only imagine he had drawn.They were beautiful, elegant and colorful.By the time I reached the bathroom and looked at myself in the mirror I practically fainted.I had eyeliner smeared all over my eyes, lipstick mushed around my mouth and my hair was everywhere.Seriously?I whispered and scoured the place for a brush.All I could find was a comb which made me giggle since he was bald, but hey it worked.Combing out my long brown hair was such a chore but eventually it was smooth and no knots occupied it anymore.I washed my face with the cool water from the sink and wished I knew where my purse was that had all my makeup in it.Figuring this was as good as it was going to get I walked back out to the kitchen to see him beaming with two plates heaping with food.The smell of breakfast filled the kitchen and I looked at the plates which were full of eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns.I took the plate from his hands and followed him to the dining room.The house was set up in a ranch style from what I could remember.When you walked in was a large open kitchen and living room.The living room had a centered sectional with a tv mounted on the wall.Various paintings filled the whole house, ones with woman, ones of random objects but mostly ones of colorful things that didnt quite make sense to me.As you walked towards the kitchen there was a small hallway that led to the bathroom on one side and a hallway that led to his bedroom on the other.The dining room was tucked next to the living room with a long wooden table set along the wall and a bar in the corner.The bedroom was huge, bigger than one I had even seen.It was as large as my living room for Christ's sake.A huge poster bed sat in the middle, a dresser sunk into the corner next to a walk in closet.I had lived in a trailer most of my life, a fancy trailer at that, but this was a lovely house.He could sense me looking around and a smirk appeared on his lips as he stopped me in the dining room and looked at me.Yes?I asked quietly as I put my plate down.Nothing.Just..I am happy you stayed.When he spoke those words my heart sank a little.I knew how he felt, one night stands and they werent there in the morning had filled my life.Well you didnt kick me out so I figured I could stay.I smiled and took the seat he offered.God, he was such a nice guy, there must be something wrong with him.He had grabbed a tank top and threw it on before sitting next to me and eating his food.I picked up my fork and began to eat.Soon hunger absorbed me and I felt my stomach lurch as if I wasnt eating fast enough.He was a fast eater, finishing before me.His high cheek bones went up and down as he ate, his glasses resting on his small nose and his eyes peering over at me every now and then.I couldnt help feel my cheeks turn pink every time I caught his glance.I had a perfect life a while ago.I got married young, but I was so incredibly happy.I was with my husband for 10 years before he was killed by a drunk driver on the way to work.A car had passed through the strip in the middle of the highway and struck him head on.He was dead when the EMTs showed up.The day I got the news my world crashed.10 years and it was over in a second.I was forced to sell the trailer and move into a smaller apartment.My dog was old at the time and she died a week later.My mother had died two years earlier from a brain aneurysm so all that was alive in my family was my father and my sister.Everything I ever loved was ripped from me in a second.Four years later and I was still working at a large retail store, Assistant Manager finally.He had always waited for the day I was offered that job.I havent been in a relationship or anything close to it since he passed.My life was full of one night stands and drinking myself to sleep.Something about this man felt different though.When I went into the tattoo parlor and he smiled at me, I felt something inside come alive again.I havent felt that in years.He held his hand out and we shook hands.He introduced himself as Rex.I still remember how it rolled off his tongue and I simply stood there and repeated his name before introducing myself, Anya.Did you sleep okay?He asked, crashing through my reminiscing.I looked over at him, the last bit of my breakfast halfway to my mouth.Yeah, did you?I smiled before finishing my breakfast and leaning back in my chair.He leaned forward and touched my hand with his before pulling me up from my chair and into his arms.I had an amazing night.That smile flashed again and I felt myself go a little weaker in his arms.Sometime within the past few minutes he had put on dance music and he now twirled me around his house.I did too.Do you usually have sex and breakfast or is that just me?I let out a small laugh as he twisted me around and back to his chest.Most of his tattoos were covered now but you could still see some through his shirt.Well not usually.Something about you is different.I frowned at that but his laugh rang out so it changed into a smile.Not a bad different, just different.A good thing dont worry.He now had one hand on my hip and the other in the middle of my back.Our bodies were so close, close like they had been the night before but we had clothes on now.His lips gently met mine and I felt myself melt into him.My arms wrapped around his neck as he pulled me tighter yet against him.I could feel his muscles flex as my body was pressed against his.Pulling away he brought his hand up to my jaw and stroked it in one slow sweeping motion.My skin prickled under his touch and I let out a soft sigh.So what is different?That you tattooed me first?Or do you bring all of your clients home?I raised an eyebrow and he gave me a look.A look as if someone had accused him of something he didnt do.I supposed that meant he didnt huh.Of course not.Usually I pick them up at bars.His laugh rang out again.It was a sweet, sultry laugh that kept you wanting more.So maybe that is what makes you different.His hands slid back around my waist and we were moving around the house again but this time in a more organized fashion.His lips were hot against mine and I could feel the need in them.I was lost in his touch and soon found myself pressed up against the wall.His hands exploring me and my hands exploring him.Our bodies were interlocked, needing each other badly in a way I hadnt felt in a long time.His body pressed against mine and I could feel him in every way, all the bad things seemed to melt away.He pulled away, taking his glasses off and looking at me with those bright eyes.They had turned into a stormy blue, with what looked like flecks of white in them.That was how his eyes had looked the night before, full of lust.It was only lust I kept telling myself.Just because he wanted to make me dinner and couldnt keep his hands off me didnt mean it was anything else.I touched his face, cupping it in my palms and could feel the cool sweat on his chin.He held my gaze for a long time before the noise of a phone interrupted us.It rang once, twice, before he let out a groan and pulled away.Dont move.He whispered in a hoarse voice and that flicker in his eyes stayed prominent.He tapped the remote at the music and it stopped mid song before answering the phone.Hello?Hey Freddy whats up?I fought the urge to move and sunk down into a nearby chair.My skin still felt hot from his touch, my cheeks burning up.He spoke into the phone, walking into the living room where I couldnt hear him.I noticed the flash from my purse and walked over to it.Lugging it up onto the chair I dug through it to grab my phone.4 unread text messages, shit.I flipped through them, one from my sister, one from my friend at work and two from my boss.Texts from the boss are never good.The first one just asked if I filed some paperwork but the second asked if I could come in two hours earlier.That would put my punch in time at 10am and it was currently 9:30.I responded yes and began to search the house for my clothes.Come on, where did  I spoke to myself and remembered we lost our clothes in the living room.I raced out past him to the living room and found my shirt.Well that was a start.I grabbed it and ran back to the bathroom, finding my bra and underwear.Okay so where were my pants.Bedroom!I ran past him once more and he made a face at me.I threw my clothes on and walked out to grab my boots and he stood there with his hands on his hips.His eyes had receded to a gray color and he looked sad.I got called into work early.I spoke quietly and he ran his hand across the top of his head.I swear Im not leaving because I want to.If I dont go in my boss will kill me.I took a few steps towards where he was and touched his chest.I promise.I smiled and kissed him.At first he didnt acknowledge me but eventually after kissing him a few times he kissed back.What are you doing tonight?He whispered into my ear.My eyes closed involuntarily and I had to focus to think.Are you inviting me back?I asked hopeful.He laughed into my ear and kissed behind it.What if I was?His smooth voice whispered.I get out at eight.I practically cut him off as I leaned back a bit to look at him.His arms wrapped around me again and that smile lit up his face.I guess I will see you at eight?He followed me to the door and the sun was so bright compared to inside his house.It was dark and mysterious but outside it was almost blinding.He handed me my sunglasses and kissed me.When he pulled away I stayed still, missing him already.See you at eight then.I turned around and walked out to my car.It was sitting next to what I assumed was his car.Cadillac Escalade, the car I had wanted all my life.What the hell.As I got into my car I noticed he was standing in the doorway, leaning against the frame, one leg lazily crossed over the other and waving at me.Some one night stand.My car roared to life and I pulled out of the driveway looking at his house.I hadnt noticed it before but it was a charcoal color, a small chimney sticking out the left side and a garage attached to the other side.Wonder why he didnt use it?For the first time in four years, I felt something inside of me.I felt lust, curiosity and above all I felt needed.Somebody needed me and they didnt want to stop after just one night.They wanted to see me again.As I drove to work I was so happy, for one day I wasnt upset about the fact my husband had died, I was happy I could finally start moving on and finding someone else like he told me to do.Work dragged on so slowly.Another manager couldnt make it today which is why they had wanted me in early.Thank god my best friend and co manager Shauna was there today.She had been there through everything.She knew how my husband was about me finding someone after he died and how it was the same if I ever were to die.She couldnt believe I had finally found someone that lasted more than a one night.Rex?What an odd name.She giggled as we did our rounds.I mean you went from Brian to Rex.Plus he is a tattoo artist.That is pretty rad I think.You always make fun of the people I sleep with Shauna.I still felt a blush to my cheeks every time she said his name, I couldn't help it.We walked over to the fresh side of the store, meat department, dairy, bakery and deli.Every four hours or so we had to do a walk through to make sure the shelves were stocked and the coolers were keeping the correct temperature.I had barely had time to change into some black dress pants and a ruffle blue shirt before work.I had to pull my hair up into a bun for the lack of taking a shower.Our heels clicked as we walked towards deli.Shauna was wearing a blue dress with flowers at the bottom.She was super feminine compared to me.I preferred pants and she usually wore gaudy dresses and jewelry.So are you going to go back tonight?She asked, excitement in her voice.Do I really have a choice?I asked seriously.If I ever want to get into a relationship I have to try.Break down that wall.It seems way easier with him than anyone else.Do you think that is bad?I asked as I fixed some things in the deli case.No.I think its a great start Anya.Dont give up just yet.She winked at me and I smiled back at her.I wont give up.I owe it to Brian.We began walking again and managed our way over to the cash registers.The walkie sounded in my ear and I made a face.Go for Assistant Manager Anya.I spoke into it and a crackle erupted before I heard Can you come to the service desk?I will be there in a minute.I responded.We are being ushered to the service desk.Sarcasm dripped from voice as Shauna let out a laugh.We made our way over to the desk talking about Rex before I stopped dead in my tracks.Shauna.I whispered and pulled her back behind a candy display.Standing at the service desk was Rex.Shauna, Shauna.What?She asked urgently.Thats Rex.I whispered and she looked over at him.He was wearing black jeans and a band t shirt.His tattoos seemed more colorful outside of his dark house, peeking out from the sleeves of his shirt.He was wearing his glasses and black sneakers with designs along the sides.Thats Rex!Shauna burst out and he looked towards us.I hid behind her and nodded.My face was pale white now.Well you dont need me sister.Go talk to him.I wonder what he wants.You are right though, he is pretty dreamy.She smirked and tapped my shoulder.I couldnt move.I felt frozen.Nobody has ever showed up at my work before.What?You arent helping.Tell him I am not here?She gave me a stern look and I knew I would have to talk to him even if she pushed me over there.I pinched my cheeks to get some color back and stood up straight.Are you coming with me?I asked and she nodded in an of course motion.We began walking over to the service desk and I let a deep breath out before seeing him.His eyes lit up as he saw me but he stayed where he was.Hey.I smiled and walked over, he pulled me into a hug and I felt myself relax a bit.What are you doing here?I kept a smile on my face but my eyes had a stern look to them.Well funny enough, you left something at my house and I figured I would return it for you.He handed me a gift card and smiled.Apparently it didnt fit right.He winked and my cheeks turned a bright pink.It was a new bra I had bought the day before, but he thought it made my breasts look small.It didnt stay on very long.I had changed before I went into his house and that was the first thing he said.I ran my hand through my hair and nodded nervously.Yeah..This is my friend Shauna.I motioned to her but she had already disappeared, taking care of a customer over by register 3.Yeah.I whispered and could feel his eyes on me.I turned back at him and raised my eyebrows.What, I cant see your work?He smirked and went to touch my face but I looked away.Affection at work I never was okay with, even with Brian.I bet you have been here a thousand times, that is a horrible excuse.I smiled and dropped my guard a little lower.He had paid enough attention to remember where I worked, that was cute.Okay I admit it was a lame excuse.I had to get stuff for tonight and forgot to ask what kind of dinner you wanted.You never did give me your number so I figured why not stop by.Shit, I forgot to give him my number?What a lame one night stand that was on my part.Oh sorry.I smiled and held my hand out.Phone please.Anything is fine.I am not super picky about food.He reached in his back pocket and handed it to me.I briefly looked through his contacts and didnt see any Babygirls or Princess so I figured he wasnt seeing anyone on the side and it was safe enough to give him my number.I typed it in and looked up at him.Should I put Anya or something else as the contact name?Anya is perfect.He smiled and I typed it in quickly before handing it back to him.Shauna reached my side again and I looked at her.Nice to meet you Shauna.He held his hand out and she glanced at me for approval before shaking his hand.You too.She smiled and turned to me.I actually need you for a minute, sorry.I nodded and looked back at Rex.Be there in a second Shauna.I said as she walked away again.I have to go.I spoke quietly, avoiding his eyes.I have to..yeah.Its fine.He laughed and kissed my cheek before I could pull away.Ill see you later.He looked at me and I matched his eyes with mine before he walked away.I took a deep breath, watching him walk and noticing he had an amazing ass.I smirked and shook my head before walking over to Shauna.Whats up?I asked and she smiled.No.What is that smile for?Oh my god Anya.He is really dreamy.You better not fuck this up.I rubbed my temples and shook my head.How did I know you were going to say that?I laughed and followed her as she began to walk.So what is up?Oh you are needed in electronics.Some crazy customer I guess and I really didnt want to take care of it so I said you would.What?Really?Come on.I gave her a glare and she just smiled back.We made our way to electronics but I kept feeling him around me even though he wasnt.I needed to get him out of my head.My cell phone rang and 8:05 and I knew it was him.I smiled and picked it up.Hello?I leaned back in my chair and closed my eyes, waiting for his voice.You havent left work yet have you?He asked intently.No why?I sat up in my chair and grabbed my purse before looking at the time.Five minutes late and he is freaking out?Can you pick up some milk?He laughed and I let out a sigh.I giggled and nodded.Yes.Anything else?God we sound like an old married couple already.I could feel him smile on the other end.Do you want 2% or what?Whatever you drink.That is all I need ol lady.I burst out laughing and made my way to the dairy department.I grabbed some milk and made my way to the checkout.So what did you make?I asked him and handed the cashier money.Walking outside the cool fall air hit me and I felt myself shiver.It was so warm and beautiful the day before, this cool air made it feel like it was winter already.Fall is the transition from spring to winter anyway.My hair blew out of my face as I made my way to the car and settled into the seat.Nothing special.He smiled on the receiver.I could hear his breath in the phone, steady and calm.But you can just come here if you want, unless you need to change.I am going to stop at my place and grab some clothes, then I will be over.The car turned over easily and I waited for his answer before pulling out of my parking space.Sounds like a plan.See you in a bit.Bye beautiful.My cheeks flared up and I whispered bye before hanging up.I text Shauna who had left two hours before me.He said bye beautiful.Pulling out of the parking lot I drove to my apartment and climbed the three flights of stairs and unlocked the door.My apartment was pretty plain, you walked into the kitchen, the living room to the right and the bathroom and bedroom in the back of it.It was all an open concept except for the bathroom and bedroom.I made my way over to the bedroom and picked up my wedding picture and kissed Brian.It had become habit ever since he had passed away.I opened my closet and dug through the clothing.I found a black strapless dress that was knee length and frowned.That totally says fuck me now.I threw it onto the bed and continued digging through the clothes.Eventually I found a black and white summer dress.I put it on and twirled around smiling.I went into the bathroom and fixed up my makeup before grabbing some heels and heading over to Rexs.I pulled into the driveway and it looked just as it had this morning.I had brought some extra clothes in case it was going to turn into a sleepover again.I turned the car off and made my way over to his door.I tapped it gently a couple times and waited.He answered the door in a kiss the cook apron and smiled.Come on in.I giggled and walked in, placing my purse and keys on the table by the door.Nice apron.He looked at his apron and then to me and shrugged.He was wearing the same clothes except the addition of the apron.I began to walk into the house and he held out his hand.What?Take your shoes off.Dont want you scratching up the floors.He flashed a smile and I did as I was told.I walked into the kitchen and it looked like a battlefield.My eyes went wide as pots and pans were stacked up in a corner, three skillets were going on the stove each with something different in them.The sink was on and the refrigerator was open.I put the milk in the fridge and turned the sink off.Grabbing a hand towel I threw it over my shoulder and grabbed the closest dirty pot.What are you doing?He whispered into my ear.He had come up behind me, his body pressed against mine.Helping?I said in a shaky voice.He pulled the pan from my hands and pushed me out to the dining room with protest.No helping.You sit.I am making you dinner.I got back up only to have his arms around me pushing me back to the table.You are so messy let me help!I laughed and he twirled me around each time I tried to make my way to the kitchen.No.Now sit!He pointed and I tried one last time but he wrangled me into the chair and kissed the back of my neck, leaving me breathless.Okay, I give up.I whispered.I closed my eyes and tried to think of what he was making.I could smell strong spices, rosemary and thyme.It smelled like beef but I wasnt positive.I hope he wasnt making spaghetti.That was the one thing I hated.I probably should have told him that though.A minute or so later I could hear him placing things on the table but I kept my eyes shut.I heard a cork pop and wine being poured into glasses.The strong smell of Sweet Red wine filled my nose and I could feel my lips curl up into a smile.Forks were placed next to the plates and eventually all noise stopped and he took my hand in his.You can open your eyes.I smiled to see his face.His eyes were a sky blue and he was smiling.Surprise.He sounded excited and I looked down at the food in front of me.He had made breaded chicken breast, fried asparagus and mashed potatoes.It smelled heavenly.It looks delicious!I giggled and leaned forward to kiss him.He kissed back quickly and picked up his glass.To a two night stand.I made a face at him but he only winked in response.Our glasses clinked and I took a sip.Sweet Red.He definitely knew me already.Only dessert wines for me.I looked down at the plate and swiped up some potatoes.They were light and creamy, unlike anything I had ever tasted before.I smiled over at him and watched him eat.Quite the cook.He looked up from his food and shrugged.My last..thing was a cook.I guess I just got it from her.He hesitated before saying thing and I raised an eyebrow.Thing?I asked and blew off the steaming chicken before popping it into my mouth.Yeah.I was dating a girl from Australia.The corner of his mouth turned up a little.But that didnt last long.Long enough for you to be a pretty good cook though.I sympathized with him.He nodded and looked up at me.What about you?When was your last dating experience?I dreaded this question and took another swipe of potatoes.My husband actually was.He was killed by a drunk driver four years ago.I gave a half hearted smile but kept my eyes down on my plate.This is as much as a relationship as I have had since.Its been drinking by myself or one night stands.My voice had dropped an octave and I spoke in a hushed whisper.His fork clattered to the table and he was next to me, pulling me against him.I had no idea.I mean I knew you had a bad breakup but I thought it was a breakup, nothing like that.Im sorry I shouldnt have asked.His chest was warm as I was pressed against it and I nodded.Its not your fault.I havent talked about it in so long it seems like it never happened sometimes.I feel like I am just going to wake up and him and the dog will be laying there like it never happened.My eyes had begun to well up.He had pulled a chair over next to me and had his arm protectively around me.Its just so hard.One day everything is perfect and then a fucking drunk guy kills it.The tears rolled down my cheeks now.He tried to wipe them away but I turned away.I was ashamed that I had let my guard down enough to cry in front of him.He stayed still, I hoped it was because if he had tried to comfort me I probably would have pushed him away and left.Sorry.I whispered after composing myself.Im some lousy date huh.I gave a weak smile and he shook his head no.He wiped the rest of the tears from my face and kissed me gently.He kissed me full of comfort and pain.There was no longing this time, purely sympathy.Youre a perfect date.He whispered and I looked up at his stormy eyes.Dont worry about that.I nodded and turned back to my food.He bit his lip before returning back to his as well.I bit into the crisp asparagus and smiled.Asparagus is one of my favorite foods.I chewed it slowly and looked up at him.My dog used to steal them though.She was crazy.She loved green beans.He laughed and looked over at me.Green beans?Really?He asked surprised.I laughed as well, realizing how crazy this sounded.Really!She was such a silly little dog.Franny we called her.I looked up and he smiled a sincere smile.Have you ever had a dog?He shook his head no.Im not really an animal person.I suppose a dog would be nice though.I havent had any sort of animals in forever.Last time I had a cat I think, and her name was Betty.Some odd animal names huh?I smiled and took another bite of my chicken.After a bit of silence he started to talk.That girl from Australia?We were supposed to get married.But then she left me for her ex boyfriend.He said and I stopped eating.The hot chicken was burning my lips so I chewed it quickly and looked up at him.She was a bitch though.I thought that was the girl of my dreams.He pushed around his potatoes and looked up at me.Guess I was wrong about that.I frowned and looked up at him.She obviously wasnt worth it then.He smiled and nodded.I thought he said guess so but it was so quiet I could barely hear.I took another sip of my wine and leaned back in my chair.Are you going for a wine and dine type tonight?His face flashed back to life and he smiled.What if I was?You didnt seem to mind last night?My cheeks turned pink and I shrugged.We had finished our dinner by now and he got up to grab the plates.Let me help?You made me dinner.It is the least I can do.After a few minutes bickering over if he would let me help with dishes or not he finally caved.I kissed him and he held the kiss a lot longer than intended.We walked into the kitchen and the whole place had been cleaned up.Damn.You clean up nice.He snickered and brought the plates to the sink.All you have to clean is these plates I guess.Pity.He crossed his arms across his chest and I hit his shoulder playfully.I washed the dishes with his arms around my waist the whole time.He began kissing the back of my neck and pushed my hair to the side.I felt emotions rise up inside me and bit the inside of my lip.I closed my eyes and let out a slow breath.He slowly turned my body around and pressed his lips against mine.They were hot this time, unlike the last time we kissed.His large hands wrapped around my waist and twisted me up onto the counter.My legs quickly wrapped around his torso which pulled him closer still.He slid his fingers under the strap of my dress and slowly slid it down my arm and off.My skin prickled with sensation as he did so.A burning feeling was left where he touched.The top of my dress was around my waist, leaving me just in a satin bra that made my bust look bigger than last time.He looked down and raised an eyebrow at it before kissing me with more passion.I assumed that was a better bra.My hands roamed across his chest and under his shirt, pulling it up and off of him.It fell lightly to the ground and I caught his eyes looking at me.They were stormy, gray and blue clouding together.My body was full of shivers and want.I wanted him to touch me, to please me and to never stop.I could see his muscles beneath his sheer skin.I touched his chest, tracing the tattoos that surrounded it.There was a heart broken in two with vines coming from the center.A skull next to that with roses around the base.A word in elegant cursive much like my own, but it was in a different language so I couldnt figure out what it was.There were stars and tribal looking shapes covering the top left of his chest and onto his arm.A large ship was spread across his other arm.The waves seemed life like, wind in the sails of the ship and a cannon on the side.An elaborate masquerade mask spread the space in between the two other large tattoos on his chest.The mask had one eyeball colored black and the rest had a intricate design surrounding it.
