She says stuff like that.Dont take it to heart okay?He kissed down my jaw line and stopped at my ear.We can keep trying you know.I could hear his lips turn into a smirk as he said it.Rex.I couldnt stop myself from giggling.He pulled me close against him and kissed me once more, this time letting his hands push the covers away to reveal my body.I felt a low growl in his throat and gave him a look.You make me feel like an animal.I just want you so bad.He smirked and kissed me again, burying me within the kiss.His body soon was over me, pulling me up against it.My head was swirling between the small aches and pains from the previous day and the pleasure rippling through it today.His fingertips traced their way down my waist and underneath the hem of my pants.I kept his mouth against mine as he slid my pants away as if they were a burden.My fingers traced across his naked back and his chest.His chest muscles were hard today, unlike many other days.You working out mister?I half moaned.I heard a husky laugh in my ear as he began kissing down my body.I grabbed the pillow underneath me and watch him slide along my body.He stopped at my hip and nipped at it before making his way lower.I closed my eyes and let everything that had happened in the past few days float away.Everything he had put me through floated away from my body, taking the stress, pain and anger with it.It didnt matter anymore because here I was, with him.I felt his lips on mine as he parted my legs.His fingers teased me and a whimper came from within.I looked into his eyes, begging him but they just shone a more brilliant blue.He slipped a finger inside of me and my body arched against him.His husky voice filled my head and he kept speaking my name.I was in such a state of bliss when he stopped I whined.He smiled and filled the hole he had left.Filled that empty void that I was scared he would leave in my life forever.I grabbed him and held him close against him.His tattoos seemed to sparkle.Maybe it was the light, or I was seeing things but he seemed electric tonight.His face was buried into my neck, stubble on his chin caressed my collarbone.His body tensed with mine, lost in each others grip.I leaned back on the bed, my arms above my head and his hands connected with mine.He held me down, holding back the amazing sensation I would soon feel.His lips were hot against mine once more and my whole world erupted.Colors and stars flashed by and the whole time he held me.Held me close vowing he would never let me go again.He collapsed beside me and kissed my hand.I tried to catch my breath but couldnt.I let out a steady sigh and Rex pulled me beside him.I could feel his pulsing heart against my own.I smiled and looked up at him.Do you think it worked that time?He smirked and kissed my collarbone.I pulled the sheets around my naked body, goosebumps encasing my skin.What?I dont get to see your body?He pouted and I glared at him.I love seeing your body.Soon you will have a bump.He smiled and slid his hand across my stomach.I hope so.I whispered.He nuzzled up against me.Soon baby, soon.I closed my eyes and relaxed beside him.Suddenly I jolted upright and dug around on the floor for my phone.Whats wrong?He pushed himself up into a sitting position.I finally reached my phone and flipped it open.Just as I thought.Well you see, I coughed I only took two weeks off and that little stunt of your mothers in capturing me was after the two weeks.I got up and began pulling on clothes.Oh shit you have work dont you.He laughed.Shut up!It is not funny.I twirled my hair around and up into a bun.Shauna was working so I knew she wouldnt mind if I was late.Oh Rex you are in so much trouble.I threw on the rest of my clothes and by the time I got back Rex was still sitting in the bed, sheet draped over him and a sketchpad in his hand.What are you drawing?I whispered and he shook his head.Go to work sweetie.Remember we are meeting with Octavius and Cleo tonight.I kissed him and ran out to the car.I flipped open my phone and dialed Shauna.The phone rang twice before she answered.Hello?A groggy voice answered.God is it that boring at work?Anya get your ass here.I can only cover you so much.Shauna warned.Im coming and I have some crazy news for you.Cant wait.She perked up.Better be here in ten minutes or you are done.See you soon.I clicked the phone closed and started the SUV.I pulled out of the driveway, speeding off to work.I clicked the radio and blasted it on the highway.How on Earth would I explain everything that happened?Oh yeah well you see Rexs mother is a raging bitch who wants him with Krystie so they can rule the clan together.Nope.The clouds floated across the bright blue sky and a smile pulled at my lips.Work was slow for some reason.It was a thursday, not our busiest days, but the parking lot lacked the normal slew of cars.I parked and grabbed my things before walking inside.Shaunas beaming face was the first thing to meet me but then it turned into a frown.Good god honey, what happened?Oh shit, I forgot coverup.I let out a small laugh.Can I borrow any?She wrapped her arm around mine and pulled me to the offices.Tell me everything.**    After a few interruptions and upset customers, I had finally told the whole story to Shauna.She stood there for a minute, thinking I was kidding.Seriously?She scoffed.I could see in her eyes she didnt truly believe me.If you dont believe me ask Octavius.He was there.I crossed my arms and raised an eyebrow at her.Oh I believe you.Oct wouldnt tell me anything when he got home, just said you got yourself into something.I got myself into something?Excuse me?Rex got me into this.I am still pissed about it.Shauna laughed and leaned back in her chair.I hear on the way home you passed out and Oct and Rex had a chat about what happened though.He didnt tell me but did say that he probably wouldnt be talking with his mother for a while.He was on good terms with his father though.Thank god something good came from this.I laughed and closed my eyes.The walkie blipped in my ear and I groaned.You know I figured everything would stop after I figured everything out.Apparently Krystie wants to talk to me.Shauna laughed and got up.I want to hear this.I grabbed my clipboard and made my way over to bakery with Shauna in tow.There was a line at deli so Shauna said she would go help out.I groaned at having to face Krystie alone.I walked over to the counter and smiled, her beady little eyes looked over at me.Whats up Krystie?She looked up from her cake and smiled.She brushed her hands on her apron and tucked her hair back into her hairnet.Well I heard what happened and just wanted to clear the air is all.She had the same smile as May and I felt a twinge of anger flare up.Okay.So clear it.I gripped the clipboard in my hands to relax myself from freaking out at her.She looked back at her cake and began decorating it once more.It is clear.She spoke and focused on her cake.I made a face but Shauna was next to me and I shrugged.Come on.I need some coffee.I smiled and walked with Shauna.She isnt that good at saying sorry.Shauna just laughed and grabbed two coffees from the little cafe that was tucked in the right hand side of the store.It was great to grab something to eat from there and step outside of the store even if only for a split second.Have you heard anything about the ceremony yet?Her question took me by surprise.Oh man, we were both getting married werent we?I shook my head.So much had happened I didnt even realize the ceremony was coming up.Oct has been talking about it.He is so excited.Rex is his best friend.He cant believe we are getting married the same day.I smiled over at her and nodded.Well the real reason we were getting married the same day was because it only came around once a year, but I wont tell her that.Four months.I whispered.Are you coming out with us tonight?I asked trying to change the subject.We settled into our seats back in the office and I gave her a hopeful look.Yeah.We are going with Cleo right?Oct says she needs to find someone.I think he just wants to go to a bar and wants an excuse.I smiled and laughed at her response.Sounds like Oct.Cleo is wicked nice though.She talked to me first about everything.She told me before Rex about the immortality thing.Shauna nodded and smiled.At least the whole clan wont be there.Will they?I shrugged.It seemed the clan just popped up when they wanted to.Shauna and I called them a clan because we didnt know what to call them.It always made Rex angry but they did kind of work like a wolf pack.I suppose a pack is different than a clan though.They had the alpha, Octavius, and everyone listened to him.There were sup alphas like Rex also.My phone lit up and I smiled.Time to go home.Shauna looked up at the clock.Damn the time went by fast.She laughed and we walked to our cars.I looked at a manager walking through towards the office.He was a stout man with a bowl haircut.I gave Shauna a look.They hired him when you were on vacation.I looked at him once more before continuing towards the car.Lots of thing happened I see.Ill see you at the bar?She hugged me.Dont die okay?I laughed and climbed up into the car.I turned the engine over and turned around to back up but something was in the back seat.I let out a yelp but realized it was Rex.What the fuck Rex?His hearty laughter boomed from the backseat as he got into the front.He kissed my forehead and put his hand on my thigh.So what is this special occasion?I asked as I pulled out of the driveway and got onto the highway.Well Cleo got the time wrong and is at the bar so I figured I would come pick you up.He raised an eyebrow before pulling me close and kissing me.When I mean pick you up I mean sneaking into the car after Octavius dropped me off.He smiled that prize winning smile.Babe!I am trying to drive.He laughed and put his hand back on my thigh after I pushed it off.I suppose you brought me clothes then?I dont want to go in this.I motioned to my work clothes.How long have you been with me, woman?You should know by now the answer to that question.His voice whispered into my ear.Woman?I laughed and pulled into the bar.You better treat me nice.I glanced around the crowded bars parking lot and let out a sigh.A box appeared in front of me as Rex got out of the car.In peeked in the box and bit the inside of my lip as I saw the sparkling sequins.What is this?I asked as he opened my door.He smirked and grabbed my hand, pulling me towards the bar without answering my question.The bar was bustling with people, strobe lights danced around the walls and the bass pulsed in a steady rhythm.I made my way to the bathroom and felt a sigh of relief to see Cleo and Shauna there.Not ready yet?What is wrong with you?Cleo flashed me a smile.She was sitting up on the counter, her legs crossed over each other.She had skinny black jeans with rips among them, a blank tank top with a fishnet shirt over it.I pulled open the box and looked up at Shauna.Something sexy I presume?She rose an eyebrow at me.She herself had curled her hair, sending tendrils down her back.Her shirt was cut right before her belly button and she wore a short skirt with leggings.I pulled out the sequin tube top and skinny jeans and frowned.I am going to stick out like a sore thumb.Cleo threw her head back and laughed.I pulled the clothes on and fixed my hair.Okay lets go.As soon as the door opened I could feel the strong bass taking over my body.The music roared through my head.At first a twinge of pain filled my head but soon ebbed.I found my way to Rex and Octavius who were sitting smugly at the counter.You are looking better Anya.Oct nodded his head towards me.I felt a laugh escape my lips as I slid into the seat next to Rex.Well its not everyday that I get into bitch fights.I am normally a calm person.I smirked and ordered a cosmo.Rex laughed in my ear and Cleo motioned us towards a table.We clung together in a group and made our way towards where Cleo was.The music had seemed to get quieter as we made our way to the back of the club.Rex pulled me close against him and Shauna sat in Octs lap.Cleo sprawled out on her chair and smiled.So we need to talk about the ceremony?I heard Cleos voice raise over the music.I leaned forward onto the table.She seemed so intensely interested in this specific topic.We had a few months, I dont understand what she was freaking about.There seems to be a few problems is all.She shrugged at the look I gave her.What kind of problems?Octavius thick voice cut through the rising music.His arm wrapped tighter around Shauna.She just let her head lay in the crook of his neck.Cleo laughed a slightly shrill laugh and bit the inside of her lip before speaking.I hadnt noticed until now that she had gotten the left side of her lip pierced.A small metal stud clung just below the outline of her lip.Well Rex, you should know the answer to this one.I heard a groan erupt from his chest and slowly turned my head back towards him.Im assuming it is May then?Cleo nodded in approval and I felt myself groan alongside him.What now?Her laugh echoed through the bar once more and she adjusted herself in her seat.Apparently there is this old rule that if an arranged marriage had been approved, it is set before anyone else.In other words Rex has to get married to Krystie since it has already been foretold.She emphasized the word has and I felt the blood drain from my face.My hand found its way to my drink and I chugged the whole thing.Spouting out coughs at the end Rex patted my back.That is not going to happen.My stern voice met Cleos.I didnt make the rules!She frowned and got up from the table.She made her way towards the dance floor, finding someone and beginning to dance.I stood shocked at the whole aspect.Apparently she stayed just long enough to tell us the bad news.Shaunas voice came from behind me.She took the now empty seat next to me and hushed her voice.You going to be okay?Be okay?I screamed.Do you realize how much shit you have put me through Rex?I turned towards him.Babe, dont worry.Im marrying you not her.I felt frustration creeping over me.It was slowly consuming my body.I just got over his psycho parents and now this happens?Some crazy rule that he has to marry Krystie!I was so done with this bullshit.My body seemed to shut down, one part at a time, enabling me to move.Rex had me pulled into his chest in a second.I could smell the deep smell of the forest and tried to relax.I pushed him away, swearing a few words and made my way to the outside.I didnt know what to do.I couldnt do anything.I soon found myself running, heels thrown behind me at the bar.I heard him yelling my name but kept running.The wind blew past my hair, tangling it from its previous state.My feet began to hurt from the gravel but I pushed on.**    Haku made his way through the bar and sat down in a corner booth.His baggy black pants and open button white shirt seemed to sparkle under the lights.He watched as Cleo made her way to the dance floor.He stood up, about to ask her for a dance but saw Enrique walk over to her.He let out a grumble and sat back down.Enrique had tight black dress pants and a dark blue dress shirt.He walked over to Cleo and tapped her on the shoulder.When she turned around her eyes lit up.May I have this dance senorita?He smirked and she took his hand.His hands rested gently on her hips as they swung to the music.She raised an eyebrow at his behavior.What?I cant dance with you?She shrugged and stepped closer, their stomachs touching.You are just...I didnt think you liked me like that.She looked up at him.Excuse me?He laughed.I am just dancing with you.How does that mean I like you?She looked taken aback and looked down at the ground.She felt a shock go through him and looked up.He stroked her cheek gently.Dont listen to him.He whispered in a less spanish accent.Gabriel?She gasped and smiled.Did you make him dance with me so you could dance with me?A small smile tugged at her lips.He rested his head against her forehead and smirked.So what if I did?He let out a deep sigh, the music relaxing him.He pulled her closer and her head buried into his chest.She always loved when it was Gabriel and not that prick Enrique.He held her close against him and smiled.She lost herself in the moment, in the music, in everything.I wish you didnt die.She whispered.He stopped dancing and pulled away a little bit.He looked into her big eyes.Me either.He whispered back.He leaned forward, his lips almost touching hers but then he stopped.Something didnt feel right, something wrenched his gut.Maybe it was the fact that this never could come to be.Maybe it was the fact that he didnt want to lead her on.He wasnt sure but he knew that he had to stop.Im sorry.He pulled away and walked off of the dance floor and out of the building.Haku watched the drama and looked over at Cleo.Her face had turned from a light pink of happiness to a deep shade of red from embarrassment.She walked off of the dance floor and stopped in front of Haku.Haku?She whispered, a tear strolling down her cheek.He stood up and pulled her into a hug.At first she stayed rigid, scared of being in his arms, but then she relaxed and wrapped her arms around him.He hugged her tight and whispered encouraging words in her ear.She looked up at him, her eyes welled with tears and her mouth gaped, not sure what to say.Lets go outside.He smiled and took her hand in his.He pulled her away from the noisy bar and sat down outside on a picnic bench.You okay?He wiped a lonely tear and smiled up at her.She nodded.Just girly stuff.She let out a scoff.I shouldnt have been so stupid is all.Haku shook his head no and cupped her face.Dont act like that.You didnt do anything wrong okay?He is just...He is...yeah.He smiled a friendly smile.She moved closer on the bench as he wrapped his arm around her.Thank you.She whispered.He went to kiss the top of her head but she looked up at him just when he did.They lips caught but she didnt pull away.Their lips together sent a lightning effect through her body.At first she was startled by the sudden kiss, squeezing her hand tight against his but she then slowly released it.He pulled away gently and looked at her, worried he had done something wrong.She smiled up at him his smile soon followed.Was that bad?He whispered.She looked at him with a smirk on her face.Leaning forward she pressed her lips against his, ultimately answering his question.He pulled her tight against him, winding his fingers through her hair.He stroked her cheek with his other hand.When he pulled away he looked into her eyes.The once plain eyes swirled with specks of silver.His own eyes seemed to be bursting at the iris.She smiled up at him.Now how come I havent done that sooner?He whispered.A giggle escaped her lips in response.**    I found myself at a small park, hidden away from the road.I slunk down onto the bench and caught my breath.Every time I exhaled a stream of white came from my mouth and nose.I hadnt realized how cold it had gotten.I let my head fall into my hands and tears flowed down my cheeks.The wind whipped through my hair as my tears stained the dirt beneath.Whenever something bad would happen I would run, whether it be from the problem or literally run.Somehow it always seemed to clear my mind just enough that I could fix the problem.I felt something touch my shoulder and my body tensed up.It will be okay.A familiar female voice washed over me.I felt a calm settle into my bones as I turned my red face towards her.How can you say that?My voice quavered when I spoke to her.She settled herself down onto the bench next to me.A soft smile filled the older womans face.Her hair was down tumbling along her back, and she wore jeans and a loose shirt.I know I look a lot different than last time.She laughed.I usually dont make house calls.Well I suppose you could say this is a forest call.I smiled briefly and leaned back against the bench.I know you are worried about what is going to happen but you need to relax.I scoffed.Relax!How am I supposed to relax?Krystie is going to marry Rex.I cant even fathom who made up that.Marge adjusted herself on the bench and looked towards the trees, blowing in the distance.I made it up.She spoke after a moment of silence.Have I told you my story yet?I glanced over to her and shook my head.A smile pulled at her lips.I am the oldest, you know that much.I am the original Immortal.I was created so long ago you probably didnt even know people were alive back then.I was created by the Gods to be a sort of liaison between the mortals and the immortals.I had the original strain of tainted blood as they called it.I kept the immortals in check and made sure they wouldnt give away themselves.The mortals needed to know nothing about what was going on and I was the one to make sure that is how it stayed.I looked over at her and let out a small sigh.If you dont want to hear it...No, sorry.Please continue.She let out a cough and she crossed her arms as she began talking.Well since I was created and not born I didnt hold many human emotions.I soon began becoming attached to the humans for the fact that I so longed for their emotions.Eventually I found one mortal who seemed to figure out the difference between me and the mortals.He and I had become romantically involved, which was another rule I broke.Once the immortals found out I was denied the chance to see him anymore.They told me that if he wasnt taken care of that he would be killed.This broke my heart and I broke away from them, telling him that he had to find a safe place and forget everything I had told him.She stopped talking for a moment and I thought I saw a tear roll down her cheek.The last thing I remember he was holding me, telling me everything would be fine.Then a sword sliced down his cheek.I told him to run, to never be near me again.They brought me back to the Gods and wiped emotions from my system once more.That was when I brought up the idea of arranged marriages, totally forgetting what had happened before.I had no remembrance of what had happened, what love felt like and what a lover was.It took me a long time to remember my old life as I call it.If the Gods knew I knew about it I wouldnt still be here.Ever since then I had decided to embrace what the Gods wanted and just keep other stuff on the down low.Did you have an arranged marriage?My voice had miraculously come back to life as I listened to her story.That is the one good thing about my position.I had the right to say who would be matched with who.I practically picked my marriage.That was the only good thing that came through it.I married Jack.You probably havent seen him though.He doesnt come out much.He likes to stay at the house.She laughed a little, looking over at me to hold my gaze.I have a say in who gets married to who.If you love him, you will be fine.I felt my eyebrows turn into a questionable look and she smiled once more.I told you it would be fine.You couldnt just tell me that?I exclaimed.No.It is more believable with the story.Nobody knows my story either so dont go spreading it around.She brushed the hair from my face in a motherly way.I rubbed my eyes and looked up at the large moon in the sky.Why would Krystie and Rex be a good couple?I asked hesitantly.To make a new pack.To make, you know, babies for a new pack.She ran her hand through her hair as the wind picked up once again.I heard the crackling of footsteps on the leaves but she put her hand on my arm.No need to worry.It is just Jack.A tall man with a cloak appeared next to us.I looked up and smiled at him.The moon caught the side of his face where a long scar slid down his cheek.I cocked my head to the side a bit and Marge winked at me.I suppose it is time for me to go.Just remember what I said okay?Jack took her hand and pulled her up.I nodded up at her and smiled.Before I could say anything they were gone and I was sitting on the bench in the night alone.The taxi pulled up to the house and I hopped out.Thanks.I handed the driver money.When I turned around Rex was in front of me.I heard the taxi drive away as Rex pulled me against him.Dont ever do that again.His husky voice filled my ears.I smelt his fresh scent and wrapped my arms around him.I fought back the urge to cry as he pulled me against him harder.He picked me up and carried me inside.I slid my arms around his neck and buried my face into his neck.He held me so tight against him I thought I wouldnt be able to breathe.He eventually sat down on the couch, caressing my face.I was so worried sweetie.I was fine.I whispered as tears finally fell.He wiped them away with his thumb.You dont look fine.He ran his hands through my hair and his lips were on mine hot and needy.My body melted in his touch and I curled into him more.Please dont do that again.I thought you were in trouble.He whispered.I stroked his worried face as he kissed my forehead.I was talking to Marge.He nodded as if it was a normal thing.She found me and calmed me down.She does that.He whispered, still stroking my hair.I smiled and hugged him.Im sorry, I was just really upset.I was too.You missed it.He let out a low chuckle.I threw a couple tables over at the bar.Baby!I giggled and hit him on the shoulder.What!I cant be protective?He smiled a cheeky grin and kissed me once more.We will get through this.I know.I got up from his grasp and made my way to the fridge.I opened it and grabbed a beer, drinking it quickly.Didnt think of you to be a beer type.Rex laughed behind me.He held out his hand for a beer of his own and I handed it to him.So what?A smirk played on my lips.It is just a different side of you is all.He placed his hand on my hip and pulled me closer.His lips were on mine again.I missed you so much.He murmured between kisses.I giggled and let him lay the kisses on me.I missed you too baby.I looked up at his piercing blue eyes and smiled.I didnt mean to worry you.He pulled his glasses off and placed them and his beer on the table behind us.He tried to pull me into his arms but I ran away.What!Come back.His laugh rang out through the house as I ran to the bedroom.I jumped onto the bed and pulled the covers over my face.I heard the door open and bit my lip.Rex jumped on top of me and my body shook with laughter as he tickled me.Rex, stop!I squealed.He pulled the covers off and kissed my forehead.I hate it when you tickle me!He buried his prickly chin into my neck.Giggles escaped my lips again as I rolled him over and wrapped my hands around him.His hand slid down my side and rested on my hip.Any luck on the baby making yet?He raised an eyebrow.I smiled but shrugged.Not that I know of.His face looked so sincere, his eyes a burning blue.He had small lines escaping from around his eyes.I frowned and rubbed them.I thought you dont show signs of aging.I smirked.Well I am not supposed to.It is probably because I was so worried about you.That cheeky grin surfaced once more.Youre silly.His lips were on mine and my body molded against his.His hand traveled up and tangled itself in my hair.His other hand rested on the small of my back.So what did Marge say?Anything useful?His calm voice broke the silence.I could still feel his hot breath on my lips.I felt goosebumps rise on my arms Just stuff.She told me about her life.His face softened and he laid his head back on his pillow.
