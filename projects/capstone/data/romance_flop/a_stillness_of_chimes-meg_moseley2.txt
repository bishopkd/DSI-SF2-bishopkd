But they did, and everything might have been even harder on him because he wasnt cut out to be a soldier.And your mom wasnt cut out to be a soldiers wife.Shed married a troubadour, a musician, not a GI.Of course this happened long before you were born, but she nearly flipped her lid when he was drafted.I can imagine.When I was little, she was still pretty vocal about her antiwar beliefs.She was even more vocal before you came along.As his moods got worse, though, she learned not to throw fuel on the fire.She went from being a pacifist to being a true peacemaker, always ready with a calming word.I respected her for that.Laura nodded, remembering her moms ability to read her husbands moods.So many times, seeing him begin to react to a trigger, shed stepped in with a soft word.He would always take a deep breath.Hed swallow.Sometimes hed close his eyes as if gathering strength to battle the blackness.If shed caught him in time, hed say, Dont worry about me.Ill be all right.Or hed give her the little wink that meant the same thing.Once, though, instead of soothing him, shed blasted him with her old antiwar rhetoric when he was already on the verge of a major episode.Shed said it with such venom that Laura, eavesdropping from around the corner, had recoiled.As she tried to shrug off the rest of the ugly memory, she had to face an equally ugly fear.Are there connections between PTSD and other problems?she asked.Alzheimers, for instance?Docs sad eyes answered her question even before he spoke.We have more questions than answers.Maybe combat PTSD increases the risk for late life dementia, or maybe PTSD is sometimes an early symptom of dementia.And if theres some family history of dementia?He frowned.Is there?Ive wondered if my Grandpa Gantt might have been in the early stages of it when he died.He seemed to beslipping.He wasnt very old, though.Sixtyish.A little younger than my dad would be now.Early onset, Doc murmured.Could be.But with your dad, we obviously dont have enough data to go on.We dont even seem to have a patient.But if by some chance he comes back, what do you think his prognosis might be?This isnt my area of expertise, so my opinion isnt worth much.Doc hesitated, fiddling with a paper clip.Lets hope for the best.Thats what people say when they expect the worst.Youve always been a perceptive young lady.Doc swiveled his chair, chose a thick book from a shelf behind him, and slid it across the desk.This book has an extensive section on PTSD and related issues.Take it home with you.It might help you get a handle on things.She took the book and stood.Thanks.Ill do that.Keep the faith, Laura.Anythings possible.And no matter how this turns out, you can be proud to be his daughter.Docs eyes were moist.Go home, put on one of those old CDs, and remember him at his best.Unable to reply at first, she clasped his hand in silence.Thank you, she managed after a moment.The rain had let up.Walking across Docs wet lawn to her car, she looked up at the mountains that formed a backdrop to the town.If her dad was up there somewhere, his fate might remain a mystery like the dead ends shed reached when she traced her genealogy.But in the long view of history, twelve years were nothing.Her dads disappearance was so recent that she might still find clues.She might even bring him home.Tears made the mountains a blue green blur.Please, God, she whispered.Please.Sitting on the couch while the day long storm ran its course and ushered the dusk into full night, Sean didnt turn on a light.He preferred to sit in the shadows while he brooded over recent events.The town was no stranger to strange doings.Back in the late eighteen twenties, Prospect had been home to miners with gold fever.North Georgias gold rush brought both craziness and prosperity.Less than a century later, Prohibition brought a different brand of insanity, and an earlier generation of Hallorans added to their already sizable fortune by selling bootleg booze to thirsty citizens, far and wide.The Halloran Building still stood on Main Street, a monument to their illegal profits and a constant humiliation to Dale, whod inherited the place and then lost it to foreclosure.Gary Bright, always quick to spot a bargain, had snatched it up.Tourism brought the money to Prospect now.Senior citizens loved the spring wildflowers and the fall colors.Bikers loved the twisty mountain roads.Families tubed the Chattahoochee River, and hordes of musicians and fans came for the three day bluegrass fest over Memorial Day weekend.Locals always griped about the outsiders clogging the roads but never missed a chance to make a buck.But if the moneygrubbers started selling Wheres Elliott?T shirts, Laura would be devastated.Shed loved her dad.Crackpot veteran or not, he was her father.When other kids had made fun of him, shed stuck up for him every time.Sean had helped her finish a few of those school yard scraps.Shed mellowed, though.Shed conquered the hair trigger temper shed had as a kid, maybe because she didnt want to be like her dad, but sometimes Sean missed the girl whod shown her raw emotions without filters.Without apologies.He checked his phone for the time.He should have been holed up in his workshop, but he just couldnt get motivated.He had a few new instruments lying around the house too, so he could break them in, but for once in his life, his fingers didnt itch to play.It all seemed so unimportant.A night creature rustled in last years fallen leaves by the side of the house.Probably one of those raccoons living in the big oak.One of the young ones was an albino.With pink eyes and a white ringed tail, it made an eerie sight, especially on moonlit nights.A ghost raccoon.The animal outside moved closer.And coughed.Sean sat up straight.That was no raccoon.Maybe it was Dale, wanting to wheedle more money out of him.But why so quiet and sneaky this time?Why on foot?Because the house was dark.He thought nobody was home.Thought hed play burglar, maybe.Sean waited, holding his breath.The skin on the back of his neck prickled.Feet padded up the back steps, and his senses snapped to full alert.The doorknob rattled.The hinges creaked.The kitchen light came on.A knock finally came, an afterthought, not on the door but on the wall.He smiled, knowing who his visitor was.Sean?You home?He rose to his feet.Hey, Laura.Come on in.When she walked into the room, her glasses were so wet he didnt know how she could see through them.In a shabby, rain sprinkled sweater, she looked like a lost little girl.Shed twisted her thick hair in a damp, red mess on top of her head.Reluctantly, he vetoed the idea of pulling her into his arms.Right now she needed a friend, not a pursuer.Out for a walk in the rain?he asked.Well, it had let up for a while, wasnt raining when I started.It turned loose again when I was passing Gary and Ardelles housetheir old house, I mean.I was about to run to the door when I remembered they havent lived there in a long time.I came here instead.She spun in a circle.Youve done a lot of work.It doesnt look like the same place.She was talking too fast, too brightly, in a scattered and disjointed way.It wasnt like her.Sit, he said, waving her toward the couch, hoping shed relax.And tell me again why youre walking around town in the rain.She didnt sit.I just needed time to think about thethe situation.Sure, I can understand that.You have a lot to process.This news about my dadIt changes everything.Her voice shook.Not news.Rumors.Somebody saw a man who looked a little like him, and that somebody told other people, and the story has grown out of proportion.Her eyes burned like sweet brown embers.But what if its really him?Have you thought about the implications?Implications, Sean repeated slowly, trying to imagine where she was headed with it.Well, I can imagine your dadif hes alivewould need medical care and counseling, at the very least.Thats part of it.Oh, Sean.If it wasnt an accidental drowning, if it was deliberate, it knocks my feet out from under me.I have to question everything.Sean studied her, trying to decipher her words, her expression.Hed been so focused on hard facts that he hadnt given enough thought to the questions that would spring up for anyone who chose to believe the rumors.If Laura was hurt and confused, he didnt want to make matters worse with careless words.Those are big ifs, though.A lame response but the best he could come up with.I know they are.She pushed up the ratty sleeve of her sweater to check a watch that wasnt there.Id better get going, she said in that too cheerful way.You just got here.She smiled at him.Im tired, Sean.I didnt get to bed until three in the morning, and then I couldnt sleep.Every time I closed my eyes, I saw the road in front of me.You know what I mean?His heart melted as he pictured her driving fourteen hundred miles of interstate highways alone, facing the sad task of tying up the loose ends of her mothers life.Ill give you a ride, then.Dont argue.Its still raining, and its dark out.Well.All right.Thanks.Laura wiped moisture off her cheeks.She turned and hurried into the kitchen, her shoes squeaking on the hardwood floor.Sean followed, wondering if shed wiped away tears or rain.Laura was intensely thankful for the ride home.It would have been a dark and spooky walk past the stretch of road where they used to pick blackberries.She looked behind her when Sean turned on a floodlight that transformed the drizzle to a thousand tiny falling diamonds.He strode toward her, the wind ruffling his hair and his shadow looming large as he pulled on a flannel barn jacket.He used his remote to start the door cranking upward on the little garage that stood apart from the house.Same old truck, he said with a smile.I noticed.But didnt you sell it to the Browns years ago?I did, but hes had to give up driving.I offered him a good price, and he took it.You have a brake light out.I noticed this morning.Yeah?Thanks for telling me.One more thing on my to do list.His garage smelled like motor oil, lumber, and paint.Laura walked past his lawn mower and a neat array of tools on pegboard.It felt wrong to go to the passenger side of the truck.Back in the day, shed climbed in through the drivers door.Theyd sat so close, shed had to crane her neck to look up at him.They climbed in simultaneously, shut their doors simultaneously.Sean turned the key.The engine roared to life, and the radio came on.No bluegrass purist, he had it tuned to raucous country rock.Putting his arm across the back of the wide seat, he looked over his shoulder and reversed the truck into the brightly lit driveway.You still listen to that stuff?she asked.He smiled.Sure.Especially when youre here to complain about it.He lowered the volume, started the wipers, and hit the remote again.The garage door rattled shut.The truck rumbled backward down the drive, escaping the reach of the floodlight and leaving them in darkness except for the dim glow from the dash.The gas guzzling engine sounded strong, and someone had installed a new windshield to replace the old one with its cobweb of cracks.The truck sounds good, Sean.Because it is good.Youve always been Mr.Fix it.Had to be, he said with a laugh.True.The Hallorans had rarely had the money to buy anything new, or if theyd had it, Dale had spent it on liquor.Sean had always been so steady, though.So strong.She wanted to scoot over and lean into his solid warmth, but she kept hugging the door.He kept both hands on the wheel.Now it was too dark to see him.Too dark for him to see her, and Laura was glad.He didnt need to know what a mess she was.Neither of them spoke as he drove out of his own neighborhood and past the Brights old house, its lights glowing behind overgrown shrubs.Then, in a flash, theyd passed the old berry patch.Sean barely slowed the truck to cross the tracks at the bend of the road where town met country.In the old days, she would have sat close to him, laughing as the truck rocked over the rails and jounced her against him.Now she clung to the edge of the seat and held herself upright.He pulled the truck around the corner, more or less ignoring the stop sign.The church steeple, softly lit from below, came into view above the trees.Sean swung into the circle drive and parked in front of the house.The truck idled, deep throated and smooth.Ill walk you to the door, Sean said.No need.Thanks, though.Got a key?In my pocket.She pulled on the door handle.Tugged harder.Nothing happened.Sticks sometimes, he said.Gotta fix that.He reached for the door, his flannel clad arm brushing against her, his face nearly touching hers.She closed her eyes and leaned hard against the headrest.Muttering a word best left unspoken, he manhandled the latch.The door clunked open, letting in a rush of chilly air, and the dome light burned brightly against her eyelids.His breath warmed her.That meant hed turned toward her.If she tipped her head forward the least bit, her lips would touch his.But she couldnt let it start.Its good to have you home where you belong, Red.The nickname from high school jolted her eyes open.He was so close that she couldnt focus.Couldnt think.Next thing she knew, hed be calling her honey again, and sweetheart, and finally darlin, and then hed start stealing kisses and telling her he loved her.But it could never work.He drew away by a hairs breadth.Ive missed you, Laura.His low voice went rough and ragged.Ive missed you too.She wanted to hug him, but then shed start crying and never stop.Good night.Thanks for the ride.She gently pushed him away, swung her legs out, and climbed down.Wait.He leaned toward her, the strong planes of his face emphasized by the glow of the dome light.There was something youd started to tell me.The implications, you called it.You said thats part of it, but whats the rest?I dont want to say it.You can tell me.It wont go any further.I know.I know youll keep it to yourself.She hesitated, afraid shed say too much but desperate for help in carrying the burden.You remember what it was like, Sean, the night they started the search.You remember how we walked back and forth on the shore, praying and crying.She couldnt go on, but she didnt need to.The grief in his eyes mirrored the grief in her heart.Of course I remember.She took a moment to regain control, then sped through the rest of it.Was my dad out there, watching?Was he in a hideaway on the other side of the lake, maybe?Spying on us?Hoping we believed hed really drowned?No, Sean said softly.Laura, he really did drown.She knew he hoped to console her, but the strange situation had put her beyond consolation.I dont know, Sean.On one hand, I hope hes alive.I would love to have him back.I want to see his face and hear his voice and bring him home.But if hes alive, why did he do it?Why did he make Mom think she was a widow?I hate to say something so terrible, but was it some kind of cruel joke?No, Sean said again.He had his issues, but he was never cruel.No?Id almost rather believe he drowned.The words tasted like poison on her tongue.If he drowned, I can keep believing he really loved us.He did.He loved you and your mom, both.I wish I could know that for sure.Shutting the door before Sean could argue, she turned for the house and ran.She didnt know what to believe.Stepping inside, she studied the kitchen clock.A sleek, modern model, it replaced the antique her dad had shattered with a well aimed cast iron trivet.The argument between her parents still rang in her head like discordant bells.Her mothers voice had been brittle and angry beneath a false calm.You have blood on your hands.She hadnt spoken such inflammatory antiwar rhetoric in years.Maybe hed hit her hot button, so shed hit his, forgetting to handle him with kid gloves.Dont try to hold that over my head, hed answered.Youve been unfaithful.Dont deny it.Dont lie to me.Laura, standing in the darkness just around the corner, had held her breath and waited for her mother to offer a sensible, soothing response to his irrational accusation.But hed hurled the trivet, smashing the heirloom clock into a hundred pieces of glass and wood.Laura had let out a squeak of terror that went unheard and tiptoed away.Shed never told anyone about her dads accusation.Not even Sean.She hadnt believed a word of it at the time.She still didnt, but her father must have.Hed disappeared a month later.Laura sat up, wide awake in the night.A pie tin was rolling down the road, clanging and clattering.No, it was only the wind chimes jangling in the backyard as the storm troubled the branch they hung from.Shed been dreaming about pies, coffeecake, and casseroles.About Ardelle and all the other hometown folks whod brought meals after the funeral, thinking good food and a hug could fix just about anything.But one wild thread of the dream included a blurry glimpse of her dad trotting down a woodland trail with his hound dog, Geezer, at his heels.She turned toward the neon green glow of the digital alarm clock, a fuzzy rectangle of light, and squinted.Ten minutes past three.Lowering her head to the pillow, she curled into a ball and tucked her flannel nightgown around her icy feet.Between snatches of sleep, shed spent the night plagued with vivid memories of her dad and his buddy, Gary Bright.With their blue eyes, narrow faces, and sandy blond hair, theyd always looked like brothers.Theyd been as close as brothers too, since their days together at Prospect Elementary.Gary was like family, still.If anybody could help her sort out the truth, Cassies dad could.He might be as skeptical as Sean, though.Something knocked softly in the night.Knuckles rapping on the back door?A silly notion, but she lifted her head from the pillow and listened, her skin prickling.Nothing but wind.Branches bumping each other.One storm had passed, and another one was moving in.That was all.She tugged the blanket more snugly around her neck.A soft thud met her earsand then a faint meow.That thud, at least, was only Mikey, probably jumping down from the table he knew was forbidden territory.The poor old kitty slept most of the day and roamed the house at night, wanting to escape to the great outdoors.He must have been going stir crazy all month, cooped up by himself except for Ardelles daily visits.With a vague thought of fixing a hot drink to settle her nerves, Laura threw back the covers and swung her feet to the cold hardwood floor.The furniture hadnt been rearranged in years.Every time she came home, she prided herself in finding her way through the house in the dark.She could even brew tea without turning on a light.By moonlight, Laura found her glasses and thick socks, then made her way into the living room to fetch the small quilt that lay folded across the back of the couch.Wrapping the quilt around her shoulders, she headed for the kitchen.She still didnt want to turn on a light.Just in case somebody was out there.Silly, maybe, but shed learned caution when she was a young girl and a prowler had roamed the town, tossing pebbles at window screens.Time to lock and load, her dad had said.Theyd all breathed easier when the Peeping Tom turned out to be Slattery.An oddball, but harmless.Still, Laura had felt safer once hed skipped town.Now was her dad a prowler?An oddball, but harmless.Thats what everybody would say.It hurt to think of people putting him in Slatterys categorysick, dirty, twistedwhen her dad had always been upright and honorable.The kitchen smelled like potting soil and flowers, earthy and flowery at the same time.Like shed always imagined Eden.Recalling what Sean had said about the lilies, she closed her eyes, going back to long ago Easters with her parents and both sets of grandparents.Her mom always put fresh flowers on the table, and she gave Laura the job of scattering candy coated Jordan almonds across the white tablecloth like pastel confetti.Every year, her dad began their feast by reading a few Bible verses aloud.Shed loved to inhale the heavenly aromasroasted lamb, scalloped potatoes, homemade rollswhile he read the amazing story.An angel.An empty tomb.The grave clothes, abandoned.Then the best part: He is not here; He has risen!It was the best twist ever, the happiest, craziest surprise ending.It always made her want to stand up and cheer, but shed only wiggled on her chair and tried mightily not to sneak any more of the candy coated almonds.After dinner, it was time to hunt for Easter eggs and candy.All the loot was hers because she was the only child, the only grandchild.While the grownups sat and talked, she listened quietly and enjoyed her haul.The day seemed to be wrapped up in a big, loud Alleluia because her dad kept singing under his breath: Christ the Lord is risen today, alleluia!Sons of men and angels say Laura opened her eyes and faced the present.Her whole family was gone.She was the only one left.Leaning against the counter while Mikey butted his scruffy head against her ankle, she looked out the window above the sink.It had no blinds to cover it, its only dressing a lacy white valance.A fast moving cloud drifted onto the half moon like a blanket that a child held up to his face to play peekaboo.Within moments, the cloud scudded past.Her dad might be somewhere out there, under that cold sky.Homeless by choice.With no blanket, no bed, no roof, hed be freezing.And crippled?Sean had said something about that.Crippled, freezingand maybe not quite right in the headbut alive.Lauras breath came faster at the thought.She shifted her gaze from the bare faced moon to the moon silvered road.Her heart crashed against her ribs.A spot of blackness in the night, a swift moving figure swept out of the yard, across the road, and up the hill to disappear in the shadows of the graveyard.She strained her eyes, but ithe?had vanished.Her dad?No, that was crazy.If it was her dad, and he wanted to see her, surely he would knock on the door and call her name.He wouldnt creep around in the night like a criminal.Laura dropped the quilt.Nearly tripping on the startled cat, she ran to the back door and checked to be sure it was locked.She wedged a chair under the doorknob, then felt her way through the darkness to the front door to do the same thing there.Making the rounds of the house, she locked the windows, even the small, high one in the bathroom, and drew the drapes and blinds tightly shut.Last, she opened the door on the colder air of her parents room.Moonlight shone on the massive, hand carved headboard that the young Elliott Gantt had made for his bride.Laura dealt with the bedroom window and returned to the kitchen, trying to decide what to do.She didnt want to sic the sheriffs department on her prowler, in case he was her dad, and she didnt want to call Sean the skeptic, especially at three in the morning.She only wanted to communicate with her long lost father.She crossed her arms, rubbed her hands up and down on her shoulders, and closed her eyes.Then, holding her hands still, she pretended her dads hands were gently resting on hers.She imagined him giving them a squeeze and asking her a teasing question.So, Laura girl, you think you deserve some answers?I sure do, she whispered.Where are you?What happened, really?In this very room, the night before his last fishing trip, shed told him, Good night, good luck, I love you.Hed kissed her forehead and said, Good night.I love you too.Always.Always.It wasnt something he usually tacked onto his I love you.Once his boat turned up empty, shed attached special significance to that word.Shed wondered if hed had a premonition of his death.Now it seemed possible that hed known he was saying good bye for the rest of his life.Energized by the idea that it was at least possible that he was her prowler, she turned on the kitchen light.She found a blank sheet of paper and a wide tipped marker so she could write a note in large letters, legible from a distance.Pacing the floor while Mikey watched from his refuge under the hutch, she pondered one message after another.Dad, I still love you, no matter what.I know why you stopped loving Mom, but did you stop loving me too?Or simply: Daddy, why?If she didnt know what to believe about him, she certainly didnt know what to write.And maybe he was long dead, and her prowler wasnt anybody shed want to welcome.Laura abandoned the blank paper on the table.Leaving the porch light on, she walked back through the shadowed rooms and climbed into bed.With the covers pulled up to her chin, she lay there, remembering so much shed never told anyone.Not even Sean.Especially not Sean.Hed loved her parents so much.Telling him what shed overheard would only break his heart.Shed done too much of that already.Cassie slogged into the gorgeous, unfamiliar kitchen and avoided looking at the clock.The sunshine pouring through the windows told her all she needed to know.Her mom never used to sleep late.It was still too early to call Drew.The three hour time difference made it hard to find time to talk, just when Cassie had so much to say.She should probably save most of it until she got home, though.Shed have to look him in the eye when she said it.In the dining room, her dad adjusted his tie, using the glass doors of a huge, brand new china cabinet as his mirror.Gary Bright, hotshot investor and the best dad in the world, had gained weight but only enough to make him look well fed and prosperous.A fat cat is a happy cat, he liked to say.But shed seldom seen him look so worried.He noticed her and gave her his typical goofy grin.Mornin, glory.Mornin, Dad.Youre still here?Yes, but Ive been working since the crack of dawn.Now Im off to an appointment in town.He tucked his crisp white shirt more snugly into his khakis.Moms still in bed?He nodded, and the worry returned to his eyes.Cassie spoke softly even though she knew her mom was on the opposite end of the sprawling house.Maybe youre worried about nothing.Maybe she just needs more sleep for some reason.And shes always been a neat freak.Shoot, she used to make me and Tig make our beds at five in the morning when we were leaving on vacation.Remember?He laughed.I sure do.Well, keep an eye on her and let me know.Oh, Tig called an hour ago.Theyll come over after Trevor gets out of school.Great.Cassie slumped into a chair at the table.She loved her kid sisters perfect family, but sometimes Tom, Tigger, and Trevor were just too cute, right down to their matchy matchy initials.With another baby on the way, they were already hunting through the T section of the baby names book.Baby Number Two was a girl, of course.Exactly what theyd prayed for.Her dad eyed her.Got up on the wrong side of the bed, Eeyore?Always.Cassie yawned.Does Tigger have to come over every single day Im in town?Yes.She has missed you since the day you ran off with Drew.We didnt run off.We thoughtfully spared you the expense of a fancy wedding so youd have more money to blow on Tigs.He chuckled.That was so kind of you.It was, wasnt it?By the way, Ive missed her too.Im not a cold hearted monster.No, he said in a dry tone.Youre a warm hearted monster.Thats me.She squinted across the room at the coffee maker.The newfangled type, it made one cup at a time.You feel like making me some coffee?Sure.Frowning again, he stuck a coffee pack into the machine and pulled a brand new mug out of the cupboard.Everything in the house was new.Even the table.Cassie missed the old, scratched one shed grown up with.She preferred their old house down in town too.This custom built ranch on a hill looked like a model home, decorated by strangers.Sterile.Soulless.Do you ever miss the old house?she asked.The one where I had to hack at the kudzu with a machete every year to keep it from swallowing the backyard?The one where you had to put your conversation on hold every time a train came by because you couldnt hear yourself think?Yeah, that one.No, I dont miss it.Not one bit.Cassie sighed.It was silly to prefer the old, cramped kitchen to this new marvel of granite countertops and the latest appliances.It was silly to prefer the old viewof basically nothingto a stunning expanse of smoky green mountains.And it was ridiculous to miss the old house, where passing trains rattled the windows.Where friends might knock on the door and walk right in.Shed been in town for three days, and except for Drews parents, not one soul had dropped by.Not her friends.Not her parents friends.If the UPS driver hadnt brought a package, nobody but family would have driven up and down that long driveway in days.Maybe her dads new prosperity had scared everybody away.He moved behind her and started massaging her shoulders.Its great to have you home, baby.Thanks for making the trip.Thanks for paying for it, but I still think youre exaggerating the problem.Cassie let her head droop forward.I still think Im not.He moved the massage upward.Your neck muscles are tight as a drum.See, you needed to get away.To play shrink for Mom?Its hardly relaxing.Im not asking you to play shrink.Im only asking you to pay attention.And see if you can get her to open up.But that doesnt mean you cant get out and visit your friends.Cassie perked up.Laura just got into town, right?Thats what I heard.Ill call her.She might need some help sorting through her moms things.No doubt.Jess lived in that house for thirty some years and never threw anything out.Yes, but at least her house looked like her.The dig went unnoticed.Or maybe not, because he stopped the massage abruptly and walked over to the window, hands in his pockets.He started whistling, so she couldnt have hurt his feelings too badly.Cassie sat up straight and idly picked up the month old newspaper that lay on the table, neatly folded to reveal the obituary.Her dad had mentioned it when hed called to ask her to fly home for a while.It worried him, the way her mom had left the paper there, day after day.Cassie had to admit that was a bit strange, but the suddenness of Jesss death must have made a hard blow even harder.Silently, Cassie read the obituary one more time.Jessamyn Flynn Gantt is survived by her daughter, Laura Gantt of Denver, and was preceded in death by her husband, Elliott Gantt; by her parents, Hollis and Laura Flynn; by a brother, Robert Flynn Some people would have argued that Elliott hadnt preceded Jess, but Cassie didnt want to believe it.Why didnt you call me when the rumors about Elliott first started?she asked her dad.He turned from the window.Same reason I didnt call Laura.Its all hogwash.Thats what I think too.Rumors are like tumors.Theyll spread in a hurry if you dont take care of them.He shook his head.Poor old Elliott.He hated himself for those black fits that made Jess and Laura so miserable.If hed lived longer, he might have done worse.God rest his soul.Yeah, it was hard on everybody.Especially Laura.He brought the coffee to the table.I just hope she wont hear the jokes.People say hell be Prospects new tourist attraction.You know, like some towns brag about sightings of Sasquatch or aliens?They say Elliotts our claim to fame.Thats horrible.People can be so cruel.He cant be alive, though.He must have had a heart attack or something while he was fishing.And if thats what happened, at least his last day on earth was a reasonably happy one.Id almost rather believe that than imagine my buddy hiding in the hills, half starved, while people stuff their faces at the diner and gossip about him.Me too.Still, Cassie wished she could believe Elliott was back, for Lauras sake.But he wasnt.Elliott and his little band had been a crowd favorite from the earliest years of the festival, their toes tapping as they played and sang.Hed often switch instruments between songs, going from fiddle to mandolin, or from mandolin to guitar.He could playand buildall those instruments.Laura had been so proud of him.So loyal in spite of his problems.So crushed when he drowned.Shed be crushed all over again if she let herself start believing the rumors.Cassie rested her head on the table, her eyelids as heavy as her heart, and wished she were home with Drew.With no worries but the bills.The bills came in faster than the money, though.At this rate theyd never be able to start a family.Not in California, anyway.Somebody should have warned her that marriage wouldnt be all moonlight and roses.Some days, as much as she loved Drew, marriage was the hardest job shed ever had.But Laura probably envied her just for being married.Lauras life hadnt turned out as planned either.When they were sixteen or so, shed thought she would go to UGA and come right back to Prospect to teach school.And marry Sean, of course.That was a given.That was the foundation of her other dreams and his too, until she went and broke his heart.But even if theyd married, they would have learned soon enough that the starry eyed phase couldnt last.Id better get out of here.Her dad was juggling two briefcases and a travel mug.Get the door for me, Cass?Say, one of my third floor apartments will be vacant in a few days.Ill give you the nickel tour before the new tenant moves in.Not especially interested in the apartments in the renovated Halloran Building, she took a careful slurp of hot coffee before she spoke.Ive seen them before.Years ago.Yeah, but I like to show em off whenever I can, he said with a grin.She opened the door for him and socked his shoulder.Youre worse than Trevor with a new toy.Okay, fine.Let me know when.Moments after hed walked out, her phone rang.She braced herself for a too cheery conversation with Tigger, whod be calling to announce her ETA, but caller ID showed Lauras number.Hey, girl, Cassie said.Can you believe were both in town at the same time?We have to get together.Absolutely.But Laura sounded rushed and abrupt.Im going out to the old cabin this afternoon.Will you come with me?I want company while I poke around.Sure.Tigs coming over, but she can visit with my mom until I get back.Poking around wont take all day, will it?It probably wont.Laura still didnt sound quite like herself.Wear jeans and boots, okay?There might be snakes.Ill pick you up in a little while.Cant wait to see you.Same here, Cassie said.Were in the new house now.Just outside of town, remember?I remember.See you soon, Cass.Cassie walked to the living room window that looked out on Prospect far below.Beyond the neat grid of downtown streets, beyond the new houses in the hills outside the city limits, lay the remains of the Gantt homestead.Laura hadnt mentioned the purpose of her trip to the old ruin, but Cassie knew.Sean locked up the workshop and led Gary across the back lawn, past budding azaleas and a few late daffodils that the previous owners must have planted.Ill tackle the yard work as soon as I can, Sean said.Seems like spring barely got here, but summers already knockin at the door.The yardll look great in no time, Gary said, slapping Seans shoulder.All those perennials and flowering bushes will appeal to gardeners.Azaleas, rhododendrons, hydrangeasyou have everything, dont you?I guess so.But if they werent in bloom, Sean couldnt tell one bush from another.Its a dandy little workshop too.Elliott would have been green with envy, boy.Boy.Dale always used the word with contempt.For Gary, it was just part of his genial, I love everybody attitude.Sean shot him a quick look, realizing hed spoken of Elliott the way a sane person wouldas if he was a dead man.Still think the rumors are bunk, Gary?Absolutely.Do you know if Lauras heard them yet?I told her, just yesterday.She didnt know what to think.Its a tough time for her.Gary shook his head.SoArdelles timing is lousy, but she wants to invite both of you to our grandsons birthday party.Trevor turns five next week, and shes throwing a party on Saturday night.Party hats and pin the tail on the donkey?That kind of party?No, thank God.Tiggers throwing a kids party on a different day.This is the one where the grandparents pick the menu and overindulge the kid in stuff he doesnt need.Cassies in town, and Im sure shed love to see both of you.Drew didnt come?No, just Cass.Shes laid off, actually, and sheshe wanted some time with the family.Gary looked away for a moment, frowning into the sun, then smiled at Sean.You know you want to come.Sure I do.You and Laura dont mind hanging out together?I dont, anyway.All right, then.You can expect an official invitation soon, probably via her.Great.But the sympathy on Garys face made Sean wonder if the whole world could see his heart on his sleeve.He supposed they all knew why he hated birthdays.Shrugging it off, he opened the back door and waved Gary into the kitchen.Sorry I didnt clean up the mess.I didnt know youd be available so soon.This isnt a mess.Its progress.Nodding with satisfaction, Gary looked around the half painted kitchen, cluttered with tools, masking tape, and cartons of tile to go on the floor later.He chuckled at the crayon scribbles on the wallsThe last owners really left their mark, didnt they?and cast a critical eye at the cupboard door that had sagged since Sean was a kid.Gotta fix that, Sean said.All in good time.You cant fix everything at once.Gary wandered into the living room, where light streamed in through bare windows.Heavy drapes had covered the windows sixteen years before, when social workers stopped by unannounced.When Dale moved to the state pen for a few years, hed probably been exposed to more sunshine than hed ever allowed in his own home.Sean ran his fingers over the smoothness of the newly painted wall.When he was eight or nine, his mom wanted to get rid of the ugly, outdated wallpaper.Shed pulled off only one narrow strip before Dale stopped her.It stayed that way for years, a jagged ribbon of off white in a room where everything else was dark: wallpaper, carpet, furniture, drapes.The house had its first breath of fresh air when the bank foreclosed on it and sold it to the Clawsons, who sold it to the family of wall scribblers.Sean bought it in February, with Gary acting as broker.They used the same bank that had foreclosed on Dales loan.Elliott had been a surrogate father, but Gary was like an uncle.Hed offered plenty of practical help through the years, including cash, but he never let Dale get wind of it.Gary had said he didnt want to be paid back.Pass it on to someone else, he always said.Pay it forward.Gary continued his walk through, checking out the bedrooms and the bathrooms too, and returned to the kitchen.Its a pretty little house, and its solid.Seems premature to sell, though.Except for the workshop, youve barely started the renovations.The workshop had to come first.Now you get to the rest of the house and youwhat?Decide it isnt worth the trouble?When I was a kid, I dreamed about kicking Dale out and making the house the way my mom wanted it.I thought it could somehowundo the damage.As if fixing up a house could fix the past.It doesnt work that way.Mad at himself for being motivated by emotions instead of common sense, he shook his head.I just want out.But youve set up the perfect little shop out back.Why let it go?Most places, the zoning rules wont even let you run a business from your home.I know.And youll get a far better price if you finish the renovations.I know.But you still want out in a hurry?Why?As Sean looked around the room, he realized hed hunched his shoulders and balled his hands into fists.His old defensive stance.He straightened his posture and flexed his fingers.No matter what I do to the place, I wont be able to get rid of Dales stench.I dont mean that literally, but you know what I mean.I do, but youre the king of the castle now.You make the rules.You create the atmosphere.But if you cant stand to keep the place, you could put just a little more work into it and turn a nice profit.Ill list it right now if you want me to, but Ive never known you to quit in the middle of a project.Ive never tackled a project as tough as this one, Sean said.I remember you tried to talk me out of buying it.I should have listened.Youve never steered me wrong.Oh, I doubt that.No, youve never let me down.I wouldnt have survived without you and Ardelle.Elliott and Jess.Keith.My grandma.Gary laughed out loud.Not to mention social services, a couple of churches, and probably the PTA.Sean laughed too, but he felt like a charity case.I cant argue with that.Whats this?Gary moved over to the couch where that pretty little F style mandolin lay, its carved top of Sitka spruce gleaming like gold against the rich blue lining of the case.He pulled it out, his big hands dwarfing the slender neck.How much for this little beauty?Brace yourself.Its my best piece yet.Gary plucked a string, the sound a tiny, unpracticed sample of the mandolins potential in the hands of a good picker.How much?Sean couldnt keep the smile off his lips.About three grand.Yowee.As gently as if it were a newborn babe, Gary tucked the mandolin back in its case.You sell many at that price?No, most of em are built and priced for casual musicians.This ones a custom job for a pro in Nashville.Hes picking it up later this week.Gibby Sprague?Not this time.This ones for a session musician.Gibby buys from me now and then, though.Will he be in town for the festival?He hasnt missed one yet.Think he knows Jess passed away?Laura must have told him.He and Elliott were pretty tight for a while.Gary ran a finger over the smooth wood of the mandolin.Elliott would have been proud of you.The apprentice has surpassed the master.Sean shook his head.Im just starting to learn what I need to learn.Youre too modest.Gary walked to the door.About the house, you want me to go ahead and run the comps so we can talk about price?No, I hate to waste your time with it.It wouldnt be a waste, but I hope youll finish overhauling the place first.Why dont you sleep on it and let me know.Will do.Thanks for doing the walk through.My pleasure.Gary stepped outside, scaring a mourning dove out of the bushes in a flurry of whistling wings.As Garys gleaming black Cadillac disappeared around the corner, Sean remained in the doorway, thinking.If he told Laura hed heard about the party, she would feel obligated to include him in the invitation.If he kept quiet, shed be free to decline the invitation or accept it.With or without mentioning it to him.Funny, how a kindergartners birthday party could be fraught with such significance.Back in the living room, he picked up the mandolin and tweaked the tuning to perfection.Elliott had taught him that, along with a million other things.A good man, Elliott Gantt.Hed had his moods, but hed loved his family and friends.Loved them with his whole heart.Sean had envied Jess and Laura, except when Elliotts temper got loose.But the man had never laid a hand on anybody but Dale, whod richly deserved it.And Gary, Sean corrected himself.Just once.Gary hadnt deserved it.Hed never been anything but a loyal and supportive friend to Elliott.Sean closed his eyes, turning his fingers loose on the sweet sounding strings.A little one man jam session.Before he knew it, he was playing one of the tunes Elliott taught him.Elliott had loved old songs and poems and stories.Hed often used archaic words just for the fun of it.After a while, the quaint speech had become his unconscious habit even in everyday conversation.As Sean started humming along, the lyrics came to him.Many a one for him makes moan, But none shall ken where he is gone.Oer his white bones, when they are bare, The wind shall blow forever mair.Sean couldnt help but wonder how many skeletons lay at the bottom of how many deep lakes across the county, across the state, across the country.He returned the mandolin to its case.All the music had just gone out of the morning.Laura and Cassie exited the convenience store, Laura with peach iced tea and Cassie with her old favorite, an orangesicle slushie.With her first sip, Laura recalled her hankering for a hot drink in the middle of the nightand the tall, lean figure sweeping across the yard in the moonlight.Thanks, Cassie said.Next time its on me.Youre welcome.Laura climbed behind the wheel and carefully fitted her plastic cup into the cup holder.Its great to see your face again.How long has it been since we were both home at the same time?Three or four years, probably.I dont remember.Its funny.Every time I come home, I remember why I was so desperate to leave.But I also remember how much I love the place.Me too.Laura backed the car out of its space, headed for the road, and glanced over at Cassie.Her hair was lighter than it used to be.Whether it was bottle bleached or bleached by the California sun, it would be a different shade and style in a few months.Cassie had always had fun with her hair.That nail polish is a pretty color, Laura said.Reminds me of Sunset Boulevard Red.The name didnt seem to jog Cassies memory.I dont know what the shades called, she said, examining her nails.I borrowed it from my moms bathroom.Like old times.Remember the day we left Tigger by the tracks and ran off to play with nail polish and makeup?Yeah, not ten minutes after we told your dad wed keep an eye on her.I guess he never snitched on us, because my folks didnt come crashing down on my head.My dad threw a fit, though.Not because we left Tighe never mentioned that partbut because I came home wearing nail polish.Parents never make sense.Cassie fiddled with the air conditioning.Do you mind if I crank up the air?Go ahead.I cant believe how hot and humid it is.Yesterday was so cold and rainy.Thats north Georgia for ya.Cassie turned the fan on, full blast, then took a slurp of her slushie.Once Laura was on the main road heading out of town, she stole another glance at Cassie.She looked as cheerful as could be expected for a girl who had once deserved to be called Eeyore.Maybe Sean was right and everything was fine between her and Drew, but it wouldnt hurt to ask.Cassie could handle frank questions.Everything okay out in California?Cassie let out a little snort.Yeah, except I got laid off.We love living there, but we can barely afford it even on two incomes.Im sorry about your job.That stinks.Something will turn up.Laura nodded, remembering Cassies old dream of being a stylist to the stars.Instead, shed bounced from one job to another because she had an uncanny talent for finding work with businesses that were about to go under.Hairstylistbut not to the stars.Waitress.Admin.Day care worker.Meanwhile, Drews techie start up company wasnt bringing in much money yet.He probably couldnt take any time off, while Cassie had all the time in the world.I hope youll have a nice visit with your folks, Laura said.Its not exactly a pleasure trip, Cassie said.My dad asked me to come.He says theres something wrong with my mom.Lauras heart plummeted as dire possibilities ran through her mind.Some debilitating disease like Parkinsons or MS.Cancer.Alzheimers.What do you mean?I wish I knew.Shes always been a neat freak, but Dads afraid shes going all OCD on us.Or maybe shes depressed.He cant get anything out of her.So Im here for a couple of weeks to help him figure out whats going on.Without letting Mom know thats why Im here.Cassie made a face.Its loads of fun.Im sorry, Cass.When did your dad start noticing a change?Around the time of your moms funeral.Makes sense.They were best friends.Only in Ardelles mind.Laura couldnt say it out loud, but her mom had never seen Ardelle as a bosom buddy.Their longstanding friendship had been lopsided.Do you see the same things that are worrying your dad?Cassie shrugged.So far, I dont see much of a problem except the uber neatness, but shes always been that way.You know, wiping down the counters all the time and making sure the corners of the napkins match up exactly when she folds them.Thats nothing new.On the other hand, shes allfidgety, and she has this new habit of repeating herself.Like she cant remember what she said already?No, she remembers.Its more like shell start talking about something and then she just cant leave it alone.Shell come back to it over and over, using the same words.Its likelike picking at a scab.I wonder if this is related, Laura said slowly.I noticed she went to extremes when she was watching the house for me.I only asked her to take care of the basics like the mail and the cat and the houseplants, but she vacuumed and dusted and straightened.All over the house.In rooms she didnt need to go into.But is that OCD behavior, or is it just a bored grandma with too much time on her hands?Cassie said, apparently asking herself as much as Laura.Anyway, Ill find a way to bring it up.Delicately.No, dont.Now that Im in town, it doesnt matter anyway.She wont need to pop in anymore.Youre right.Cassie squirmed around in her seat to face Laura.Okey doke.My tough subjects out of the way.Time for yours.Do you think your dad is at the cabin?Hearing it spoken aloud made Lauras heart lurch.I can always count on you to be blunt.She sighed.I dont know, but I have a few reasons to think there might be some truth to the rumors.Like what?For one thing, Ive started wondering why my mom hung on to my grandparents property and paid taxes on it all these years.She should have sold it.You think she kept it so your dad would have a place to go?Maybe.Or she thought shed get a better price if she waited.I dont know.Laura swung the car wide to give room to an old woman picking her way through the roadside weeds.Frail as a spider, the woman held a faded blue parasol upright above her head.Granny Colfax, Laura said, glad for the distraction.I cant believe shes still alive and kicking.Me either.Nobodys granny, everybodys granny, Ruby Pearl Colfax knew everybody and their business and didnt hesitate to express her opinions.Laura had always tried to give her a wide berth, but her parents had loved Granny, so it hadnt been easy to avoid her.Does she still live in that teeny tiny house on the west side?Cassie asked.Your guess is as good as mine.I havent been around much either.No idea what shes doing out here.Last in line at a red light down the road, Laura checked the mirror for the gray blue of the parasol, but the shoulder lay empty, edged with green brush and trees.Such an old woman to be walking alone in the boonies, although it wouldnt be the boonies for long.Prospect was sprawling in all directions, with new homes going up as fast as the builders could tuck them into hollows and scatter them across hilltops.Many of the For Sale signs bore Gary Brights picture and his corny slogan: The Bright team, prospecting for a bright future in Prospect, Georgia.Good old Gary.He was rolling in dough.Hed earned it.The light turned green, and half a dozen vehicles crawled forward with Lauras in the rear.When shed left for college, the road hadnt had any traffic lights.It wasnt even paved, and thered been more cows than houses.Just in time, she spotted the wrought iron post, minus its mailbox for years now.She braked sharply.Cassie shrieked and steadied both drinks as Laura swung the car into the driveway of the old Gantt home place.The tires crushed masses of kudzu that blanketed the gravel.Long stretches of vacant land on either side of the property separated the cabin from its nearest neighbors, and a newly plowed field lay across the road.Vines engulfed the tiny log home where her dad grew up.The roof sagged.The windows were black voids with no glass in them, curtained with big, heart shaped leaves.If the barn and the shed still stood behind the house, theyd been buried too.Wow, Cassie breathed.It just hit me.This is all yours now.Youre rich, girl.Well, not exactly rich, but you do own some property.Its just starting to sink in, Laura said, careful to keep her voice on an even keel.Shed inherited everything, of course.Her moms personal effects.Her SUV.Her bank accounts.Her house and this property that had belonged to Grandma and Grandpa Gantt.But the cluttered bungalow was desolate and empty without her mom there, and this tumble down cabin was a sad reminder that time had claimed her dad and his parents too.
