"After reciting the prayer, Joshua continued to kneel in silence for a couple of minutes.After the Minhah was over, Joshua extinguished the candles, but left the incense burning.He then stood up, took off the shawl and returned to the kitchen to retrieve the lunch that had been prepared for Ruth.Ruth was sitting up when Joshua brought the tray of food into the bedroom."Ah, Missy you're awake," Joshua said with a smile.He had called Ruth Missy from the first day they met."What have we got to eat today? "Ruth asked."Mashed potatoes and tomato soup," Joshua answered as he placed the tray across Ruth's lap.
