Mrs.Plumford, the sextons wife, had a terrible attack of her usual inexplicable illness, but had been cured by Dr.Brent, who gave her some type of wonderful medicine he had invented himself.She took it every day, calling it Dr.Brents Healthful Elixir.And someone had seen the admiral walking again.At this bit of information, everyone chuckled cynically and I was glad I had kept it a secret when Christa had seen the ghost.We talked until night had taken a firm grasp on the countryside and hoots of hunting owls sounded in the forest.Before I went to bed, I took one last check on my sleeping sisters.On the small oak nightstand was Christas old hand mirror, the same mirror with the warped glass that made your nose look like it was planted between your eyebrows.I lifted the glass to see my reflection in the flickering candlelightthere it was, distorted as ever.The stylish pale haired London sophisticate who had looked back at me from the expensive mirrors in Lorne House was unrecognizable now.The hazy, confused image in Christas glass would always be the real Miss Elizabeth Cordell.*** The next few days passed quickly enough as we unpacked our trunks, dusted the cottage, and made gallons of horsemint tea to refresh the ladies of Mudbury who came to welcome us home.On our second afternoon back at Barfrestly, we had so many inquisitive visitors that the cottage buzzed like a London drawing room.Christopher obligingly carried chairs out of the cottage so the ladies could sit on the lawn and take advantage of the fanning breeze and the shade of an elderly maple.Mrs.Goodbody and the twins recited my triumphs in the fashionable world (greatly exaggerated, of course) while I blushed, disclaimed, and answered dozens of good natured questions.I patiently endured Mrs.Plumfords habitual lecture on the impropriety of accepting such extravagant hospitality from Lord Dearborne, and let the innkeepers wife twit me on my modish hairstyle.It was just like old times.My friend Janes upcoming marriage to the wheelwrights son was discussed at great length toothe topics ranged from what to wear on the wedding day to what to wear on the wedding night.By the time the ladies had finished their frank conversation, Jane was as red as I had been earlier and we were glad to slip off together for a private exchange of confidences.It wasnt until late that evening that we had cleared up after our company and got down to some of the real work that needed doing.I donned an old work dress, picked up my hoe from the barn, and went to weed my overgrown vegetable patch.On the way down to the garden I passed several of Lord Dearbornes workmen guards; they were still around, unobtrusive but plentiful.I set to in the garden with such vigor that I accidentally beheaded a dense bush of basil.What a relief it was to work again after so much exhausting play.When I saw Christopher riding his frisky chestnut across the lawn toward me I waved the drooping basil leaves at him and shouted that I hoped whatever Cook was preparing for his supper could be seasoned with basil.Probably!Uncle Nicky had some friends from the War Office call on him today and theyll be here for dinner, so Cookll likely knock off half a dozen main dishes and a mass of removals.I rode over to the Macreadys this afternoonJeffrey sent his regards to you.Oh, and his sister, Cecilia, too.What a quiz that girl isyou should have seen her gown, she looked like a tube of sausage.How did your tea party go?Dandy.My sisters drew a picture of my London partying that makes the career of the famous Gunning sisters pale in comparison.Everybody thinks I am the queen of the bon ton.Well, you are on the pathway to becoming the princess of the bon ton at any rate, he said, smiling and saluting with his riding crop.I must be off now, well be seeing you.I want to hang about Uncle Nickys cronies and see what they are all up to today.I took the basil up to the kitchen to give to the cook.I nodded hello to Thomas, the groom, who was sitting on the counter, swinging his dusty feet, eating some fresh bread spread with red currant jelly he had begged from the cook.And how is Miss Elizabeth today?he said in his cheeky way.Miss Elizabeth is fine, thank you.How can she get some of what you are eating?Just have some of mine, he said, tearing off a piece and offering it to me.We munched in silence for a moment, then he said, The marquis be having company today.A fine carriage with some good horses from London.Thats right, he is, I said.Christopher says they be from His Lordships office.The War Office, I said, enjoying my bit of bread.To think that Id be working for a man in the War Office, who makes important decisions on the fate of the country.Me mother would be so proud of me, rest her soul.Your mother is not living?I asked him sympathetically.She passed on some time ago, he said, wiping a bit of jelly from his cheek.I wager youre happy to be back in your little cottage after that big strange house in London.Yes, I am, really.It isnt so luxurious of course, but it is home.Thats true enough, said Thomas.He let himself down from his perch and walked to the door.Im leaving now, Miss Elizabeth.Thank you for having dinner with me.It was a grand occasion.Thank you, I said.He let the door slam shut behind him.It suddenly occurred to me that I had never before had such a long conversation with Thomas.He seemed rather familiar, but perhaps that was his manner.He was polite enough to give me some of his bread.I wondered for a moment about the meaning of politeness.I had been brought up to view polite people as being of good character.My recent experience showed this wasnt always true.Lady Catherine had been charming to me the night of her ball and then told Lord Lesley some unsavory lies about me.And Lord Lesley, who had worse manners than Mohawk, had actually been kind to me, though in his own fashion.I thought more about this as I lay abed that night.People are not always what they seem.Unfortunately, this new insight into human nature was unaccompanied by any great insight into any of the problems that beset me.There were times when I felt a tremendous urge to run to Lord Dearborne and confide my reason for entering the London slums.Its not that he would approve, but at least some of those ugly suspicions would be banished from his mind.Ever since that evening he had either ignored me completely or talked to me with less warmth than a longshoreman would to a sailor who has just dropped a weighty trunk on his toe.I wanted him to like me again.No, thats not honest.I wanted him to do much more than like me.But I wasnt going to confide in himif he chose not to trust me, so be it.Such thoughts are hardly conducive to peaceful slumbers.If I had been back in London with a room to myself, I could have lit a candle and read for a while, but that was impossible now that I was sharing a room with my sisters again.They would probably wake up.There was nothing for it.I could not sleep and I could not read, and I have always hated to lay in bed staring at the ceiling.I must go for a midnight stroll.It suddenly occurred to me what had happened the last time I had gone on a midnight stroll.I had overheard a bit of rude speculation as to my desirability, I had seen a ghostly intruder, and a French cook had been murdered.I paused a moment in debate.I decided finally that this particular set of circumstances would not occur again, so I threw on a shawl and struck out for the open spaces.I hadnt been two steps out of the door when I saw something that made me cover my eyes and mutter, Go away, go away.History was repeating itself; there was a dusky figure flitting silently across the garden not twenty yards from where I stood.This was too much for me to bear.No one else in our household had to deal with such disturbances on a regular basis.I had followed the figure last time, and it had worked mischief when I lost track of it.I resolved to follow it more closely this time.Something was definitely there.When I uncovered my eyes, the ghost was there all right, so I observed it as carefully as possible under the circumstances.The admiral it was not.I remembered the way the admiral moved: his wide stance; his rolling stride, which slowed down as he got older but never lost its vigor completely.This ghost was being stealthy, running along close to the ground and occasionally lying down behind a bush or a tree.What did a ghost have to be afraid of?Other ghosts?I made the conclusion that I wasnt dealing with the supernatural.My experience in the slums had shown me that live people could be frightening enough.Now I was left with a whole new set of questions.If I screamed, the intruder would try to shut me up.I had no desire to be another casualty of my guardians occupation.Screaming could also, perhaps, frighten him away before he had a chance to play his cards; the whole household would be roused for nothing and the intruder would get clean away.I moved parallel to him across the lawn, staying behind him and stopping when he stopped.After a short time we had worked our way close to the mansion.I watched, my eyes trying to pierce the darkness, as he took a vessel of some kind from underneath his cloak and began sprinkling the hollyhocks with it.Why was he sprinkling the hollyhocks?Why in the name of Zeus would an intruder flit stealthily across a garden in the dead of night only to water some flowers?I crept closer to observe this strange procedure.My observation was assisted when the stranger struck a light.His face was covered.As the light burned, I realized that he wasnt watering the flowers; he was spreading the unknown liquid onto a large heap of brush which had been piled against the wall of the mansion, and hidden from view by the hollyhock bushes.His intentions suddenly became all too clear when he dropped the light on the brush pile and disappeared, leaving behind what quickly turned out to be a raging hot fire.In just a fraction of a moment, the fire was tall in the night sky and licking across the roofing.The intruder was an arsonist, and Barfrestly Mansion would be a fireball if I didnt do something immediately.I felt the uncomfortable pounding of my heart beneath lungs that couldnt quite fill themselves with enough air.Mercury gave wings to my heels and I flew, with panicked urgency.There was only one course of action for me, one man who spelled help and comfort in an emergency.I raced to him now.Thank God, Cook had forgotten to lock the kitchen door.I wrenched it open, my blood racing faster than my feet.How long would it take for the flames to reach the main bedrooms and those of the sleeping servants?The fire had started in the other wing; I couldnt even smell the smoke from here.I took the main stairway two steps at a time and pulled Lord Dearbornes door open with a jerk that ripped the skin from my knuckles.Then, even in my nervousness, I stopped and padded quietly into the room.The marquis lay asleep in his bed.The one lit candle beside him gutted, spreading a warmish glow through the gently tangled mane that now curled casually against the white pillowcases.No matter how blas you are, the sight of that undeniable male beauty could stop you dead in your tracks.If I hadnt been standing in an old building that was well on its way to burning to the ground, I am sure that I would have remained staring at him all night.I sternly called myself to order, thanked whoever might be listening in heaven that the marquis was covered at least to the waist with a sheet, and advanced to shake him gingerly by the shoulders.He woke to pull himself upright with such suddenness that I would have lost my balance and fallen if Lord Dearborne hadnt steadied me by gripping my forearms.What are you doing here?he snapped with amazing crispness for one who had so recently been asleep.Then he stopped and cursed under his breath and patted me gently on the shoulder.Its all right.I didnt mean to startle you like that.Im a light sleeper.Something is wrong, isnt it?Well, you cant tell me with your hand over your mouth.He carefully disengaged the clenched fist that I had unconsciously raised to my lips.What happened?The house is on fire, I said, not mincing words.Really!I saw him setting it, at least at first I thought he was only watering the flowers but then I thought, How strange, why would a ghost want to water the garden.But when he threw a light at the wall, I understood.Well, sweetheart, if you understand that makes one of us, replied Lord Dearborne, who had tossed back the sheet and pulled on a pair of buckskin breeches before I had the time to cover my eyes, blush, or utter a maidenly shriek.He put his hands very firmly on my shoulders, and looked straight at me.Elizabeth, calmly now, just yes or no.Has someone set this house on fire?I nodded.Am I the first person youve told?I nodded again.What part of the house is burning?I told him.He sat down on the edge of the bed and reached for his boots.The fire wont reach this part of the house for another half hour at least.How did you happen to observe the arsonist?Its just like the arrogant marquis to waste time pulling on his boots and engaging in a lot of recriminations with a house burning down around our ears.Because I was out in the garden trysting with my lover.Would you like me to summon your valet so he can assist you in the arrangement of your cravat?Have some of your own sarcasm back, Milord.Lord Dearborne paused, thoughtfully.Ah, good girl!I was wondering whether to demean myself by shouting through the hallway for him or if I should simply make do without.Sarcasm is wasted on Lord Dearborne.Please, N N Nicholas, this is no time for stupid jokes, I returned weakly.Lord Dearborne was gazing at me like one charmed.Youve never called me that before.What?I squeaked.N N Nicholas.My name sounds rather exotic falling from such lips.And this after treating me like a leper for days.Of all the moody, difficult the house is on fire!Dont you understand?Burning, flames, heat, smoke!Oh my God, I shall end up in Bedlam, if I dont get burned alive first, I said, a little desperately.Lord Dearborne finished pulling on his boot and, grabbing me firmly by the elbow, strode purposely through the door and down the corridor.I was amazed by the confidence that allowed the marquis to move so quickly through the dark hallways.When we reached the hallway before Christophers bedroom, I saw that it was bathed in light from a small ceiling chandelier.There was a man seated on a straight backed chair next to Christophers door.The man rose quickly as we approached.Lord Dearborne, now thankfully economical with his words, explained the situation, ordering the man to take Christopher and me out through the kitchen doorway and to keep us out of the way.The man, whom I recognized as one of Lord Dearbornes workmen, roused a yawning Christopher and dragged him out of bed, nightshirt and all, while the marquis hastened off through the corridor in the direction of the servants bedrooms.This time, descending the main staircase with Christopher and the bodyguard, I could smell the acrid smoke twisting ominously through the building.Once we reached the outside, I heard the urgent shouting of Joe Hawkins, the grooms, and other estate workers who shared the gatehouse.Apparently Thomas, the groom, had seen the flames and rang the stable bell as an alarm.I told my story, which was becoming rapidly more incoherent, to the excited audience.Pandemonium reigned supremeIve never seen so many grown men behave so much like hens when there was a badger in the barnyard.The marquis appeared and, after surveying the severity of the fire, ordered the men to remove goods from the house.Personal effects of the servants first!he was shouting.A pile of household goods grew rapidly in a space a distance from the mansion as the men handed out, in relays, small cedar chests, clothing, and china settings.Huge billowing clouds of yellow smoke were now pouring out of the upstairs windows where the marquis and Christopher had been soundly sleeping just a half hour previously.The fire broke through a large hole in the roof, sending a shower of cinders up into the sky, reflecting brilliantly in the faces of the semicircle of onlookers.Christopher was hopping about in his nightdress, assisting the men in their labors.Youll be in trouble if a good gust of wind comes up, my dear boy, shouted the marquis to him cheerily.You will be causing embarrassment to the ladies present.How could he be cheerful when his house was burning down?I received something of an answer to my question when Joe Hawkins and Christopher hauled out of the house a third soot blackened man who retched and gasped for air as they dragged him away.Thats good, boys, he shouted.Better to leave it alone now.Ive other houses.Its not worth anyone getting hurt.Let it burn.Keep watch on the outbuildings; we may as well save them.The heat of the fire was reaching out to us where we stood.Beads of perspiration were breaking out on Mrs.Goodbodys face.She mopped her brow and said: Wed best be watching from the cottage, girls.This is no place for us.The twins were sitting cross legged on the ground, mesmerized by the sight.I caught their attention, and we herded them away from the fire back toward the cottage.I was depressed about the library; I had spent many a peaceful hour in its musty embrace, and now it was a holocaust.And the admirals nautical instruments and his old maps.What a tragic loss.We had all spent many years in the benevolent shadow of the admiral and his ugly old house; I felt as though I were watching the funeral pyre of an old friend.A lump rose to my throat as I looked over my shoulder and seemed to see the sad, forlorn face of the old sea dog peering out through the flames that rose laughing toward the heavens.Good bye, good bye, I said to myself as we watched from the stoop of the cottage.A curricle was being whipped up the drive.It was Wadbury, Lord Lesleys butler, come to help.He stripped off his waistcoat and joined the men who were carrying buckets of water to pour on the roofs of the outbuildings.I am here on behalf of Lady Peterby, he was shouting.We saw the flames from Petersperch and she wished to offer our assistance.Is everyone safe?Perfectly safe, thank you.Come here a moment, there is something you can do for me, said the marquis.He motioned Wadbury closer and they stood talking, but we were too far away to hear what was being said.Presently the pair made their way toward us, and the marquis spoke in the commanding, peremptory tone that he used when preoccupied.I am sending you ladies to Petersperch to stay the night.This is no place for you here.And I imagine the Terrible Two will need their rest, he added in a warmer tone.They squealed in delight as he continued, I shall have the carriage sent round to pick you up.Lord Peterby is there and will see that you are comfortable, added stout Wadbury.And with that, they turned and went back to their labors.So the performance was over for us, I thought as I helped Mrs.Goodbody pack a bag.The carriage came round and we were helped into it by a tired but still bluff Joe Hawkins.We were having breakfast with Lady Peterby the next morning when we were interrupted by an exhausted, dirty Christopher.He bore a smoky old crate filled with the admirals old maps and nautical instruments!My eyes filled with tears of gratitude as Christopher said, his voice hollow and weary, We thought you might like to keep these.And the mansion, in what state is it?I whispered through my joyful tears.Burned to the ground, of course.Leveled.A total loss.Fourteen It was late that evening before Lord Dearborne arrived at Petersperch, disheveled and dirty.He had stayed to make sure the last ember was out.Privately, I observed that even after a sleepless night and strenuous day, he looked energetic enough to take a couple of dragons in hand to hand combat.Lady Peterby didnt think so, however.She immediately sent him up to a guest room to rest, promising him a tray with dinner and a footman with bathing water.Roger and Lady Peterbys butler, who had arrived looking dead on their feet with Lord Dearborne, were shepherded off by Mrs.Goodbody to receive much the same treatment.Lady Peterby had promptly and with endearing graciousness invited us all to stay, at least while Lord Dearborne dealt with the problems attendant to moving the uprooted household to another one of his many estates.He will probably send me to the remotest possible corner of England, I reflected gloomily.I wondered if he owned any property in Ireland.If so, there was probably a place marked out there for Elizabeth Cordell.The temporary thaw, if thaw it had been, in Lord Dearbornes manner toward me in those few moments in the burning mansion had not lasted out the day.His frosty hauteur had returned on his arrival at Petersperch and he didnt even acknowledge my presence in the room as he thanked Lady Peterby for her kindness to us and accepted her offer to house us for the time being.Belowstairs, as speculation ran rife as to which of his more comfortable houses Lord Dearborne would repair to, I wondered why Lord Dearborne had already spent so much time in Kent.Barfrestly Manor must be the least imposing of his properties.True, at first there had been business connected with his inheritance of Barfrestly that he might have wished to handle personally, but that could have been concluded within a few hours.The rest could have been just as well conducted by one of the marquiss capable lawyers.Certainly Lord Dearborne had shown no interest whatsoever in Barfrestly Estate for the first nine months that he had owned it.What had kept him here among gnarled apple trees, weedy gardens, and leaky old buildings?Not affection for a manor house that he had allowed to burn down without a qualm.For the present, Petersperch was a more appropriate setting for my elegant guardian than Barfrestly could ever be.The well kept lawns, trimmed hedges, and clear garden ponds filled with darting gold and silver carp had more in common with Lord Dearbornes life style than the tumbledown acres he had accidentally inherited from Admiral Barfreston.Conversely, Lord Peterby seemed a natural resident for the ramshackle estate that had been my home.I cant imagine anyone who would look more picturesque pacing through the shabby grounds in brooding solitude.The touch of Lady Peterby was very evident in Petersperch.I was granted the opportunity for a long, friendly coze with Lady Peterby that first afternoon at Petersperch and fell firmly, painlessly under the spell of her delicate charm.Whatever trace of Lady Peterby that exists in her turbulent, dissolute son had never been revealed to me.Still, she calls him my Lesley and talks of him in an indulgent manner, as though his libertine propensities were mere boyish mischief.Mothers seem to have a special blindness to the faults of their own offspring.Bravo for that, I suppose.Life at Petersperch settled into a breezy, pleasant pace.My sisters and I resumed our lessons with Mudburys scholarly vicar; this took up most of the mornings.On fine days we walked into town, always under some adult escort as decreed by our autocratic guardian.Our afternoons were spent in animated conversation with Lady Peterby, gathering flowers from the extensive formal gardens and visiting with any of the neighboring gentry who might happen to come calling.The squires family came; Jeffrey to renew his casual friendship with Christopher, Mrs.Macready and Cecilia to marvel over the phenomenon of Elizabeth Cordell, lately charity resident of Barfrestly Estate, as visitor and honored guest of Lady Peterby.I could have told them, though I didnt, that they were wasting their awe; old Elizabeth was still as much a charity resident as ever.In fact, and completely by accident, I was made more aware than ever of just how much of a charity resident I was.On the afternoon of our third day at Petersperch, one of Lord Dearbornes men of business came down from London to go over whatever it is that is necessary to go over when your house burns down.I had seen this lawyer before.He had visited the marquis several times at Barfrestly before our trip to Loin done (my sisters new name for the nations capital).At any rate, he was a small, fussy man with a beaky nose and tiny glaring eyes that seemed to look right through you and price your underclothes.I studiously avoided his company until that afternoon when I walked blithely into the yellow salon to have tea, secure in the conviction that Lady Peterby and my sisters would be awaiting me there.Unfortunately, they hadnt yet arrived and there sat Lord Dearbornes lawyer, looking for all the world like a crabby, underfed canary that someone had left under the cage cover too long.I would have beat a hasty retreat from the room if I could have without being grossly uncivil.As it was, I sidled nervously over to the waiting tea tray and asked if I could pour him some tea.He pulled down his murky spectacles to peer disapprovingly at me over the rims.Ahem.Miss Cordell, isnt it?One of the dependents of the Marquis of Lorne?Why not His Majesty, the Marquis of Lorne?But I returned politely, Yes, sir.Admiral Barfreston provided for us in his will.Nonsense.You were definitely not mentioned in the will.I realize that.What I meant was that Admiral Barfreston made a verbal request to one of his lawyers that my sisters and I should be supported out of his estate.Which I understand is legally binding on Lord Dearborne, as his heir.I felt an angry flush glaze my cheeks.The disapproving pout on the lawyers face intensified.Not at all.You have a most confused understanding of your position vis  vis the Marquis of Lorne.Not only is he under no obligation whatsoever to support your family, he is doing so strictly against my own recommendation.The idea of wasting money on a set of orphans to whom he is in no way related is ludicrous.There are many perfectly good orphan asylums and workhouses in this country and there is no need to carry charity to this ridiculous personal extreme.The color that had washed over my cheeks a moment ago faded into a chilly numbness.Do you mean Admiral Barfreston made no bequest to my sisters and me?Nothing.Admiral Barfreston made few communications with his solicitors in the years before his death.He had grown quite vague about his duties as a man of property.The estate business was in a shameful muddle when the Marquis of Lorne inherited.The condition of the land was so poor that it could not even be sold without a good deal of work, he spoke disparagingly.He returned his hard scrutiny to me.You are a singularly fortunate young lady.You should be grateful that His Lordship is such a generous young man.There are few of my clients who would have so kindly taken on an unnecessary responsibility such as yourself.Of course I should have known.I dont know habeas corpus from corpus crumbcake, but I should have recognized the line about Admiral Barfreston making a verbal provision for us as precisely the type of courteous pretense one maintains to spare the sensitive pride of a pensioner.Admiral Barfreston had indeed been vague in the last few years of his life.My sisters and I had disappeared behind the foggy visions of sea battles and typhoons.Anyone with any courage would have gone immediately to her room, packed her cases, and marched to the nearest workhouse, sisters in hand.Vive cowardice!I had been to a workhouse once on a mission of mercy with the vicar.The bleak, lifeless faces of the inmates had told a story more eloquent than any pamphleteers words.The public houses of good works were colonies for the living dead, the hopeless, the forsaken.Never would I condemn my happy little sisters to such a life.And I had recently learned the horrors of setting out unprotected, facing the night streets with all the human predators who prowled there.Probably what I should do was look for some kind of work.As a governess?A nursemaid?Probably what I would do was go on as before; pretending belief in the fabrication that Lord Dearborne was under an obligation to support me, that I wasnt just another battening freeloader.Knowing now how fully I was under obligation to Lord Dearborne should have made me all the more grateful to him.It should have, but it didnt.It is hard to feel anything fonder than the utmost pique for a man who persists in treating you (at his most mellow) like a poison ivy patch.Whatever anyone else thought of his coldness to me, they said nothing about it.Perhaps they all simply assumed that it was consonant with his usual arrogance, though I noticed Christopher regarding me sharply several times in the evening when the household sat together to dine on Lady Peterbys lace clothed teak table.Morbidly afraid of revealing my feelings for Lord Dearborne, I adopted a light, Lizzies atop the world attitude toward life, letting everyone see that there was nothing bothering me.I must have overplayed it because Mrs.Goodbody, Christopher, Christa, and Caro came around separately and in pairs to ask me what in the name of heaven had gotten into me.Life was becoming very confusing.I was keeping so many secrets from so many people that I had to think carefully each time I opened my mouth.Whenever I could, I escaped from painful adult reality to a world of make believe with the twins, with their fantastic imaginations and energetic games.On one beautifully alive morning we returned from our lessons to toss our books on a garden bench, tuck our skirts into the tops of our underslips to shorten them to knee length, and race around the formal gardens chasing Lady Peterbys arrogant yard fowl.Black swans, peacocks, and harlequin ducks scattered and barked viciously at our plebeian attack.When we did get close enough, we pulled out tail feathers until we had enough to make colorful plume crowns to decorate our hair, like the American Indians.Whooping and singing, we pretended to be brave warriors, hunters of wild beasts, and enemies of British settlers.We took turns capturing and bringing one another, struggling, to our imaginary village of hide huts.Being the fastest runner, I was the hardest to catch, but in relays Caro and Christa wore me down and dragged me, pleading for mercy between gasps of laughter, to a shallow lily pond where they declared solemnly that they were to drown me.One shove and I was sitting waist deep in water, feathers flopping in my face and faint with mirth.Now if I had gone into the house for luncheon directly after lessons, I would have known that Lord Lesley Peterby had arrived from London with a determined Lady Catherine in tow.However, since I had not gone into the house, it was a small shock to me when Lady Catherine, Lord Dearborne, Christopher, and Lord Lesley came walking around the curve of the brick wall surrounding the herb garden.I probably would have been embarrassed at being discovered in a lily pond, dripping with moss and leaves, were it not for the flabbergasted look that Lady Catherine gave me.Her face was such a study of round eyed disbelief that it set me off into peals again.Shaking helplessly, I staggered to my feet and tottered over to mischievously scatter a few droplets of water from my drenched skirts onto Lady Catherines immaculate gown.I vow, the chits drunk, gasped Lady Catherine.Indeed, I felt drunk.Or at least light headed from laughter.Oh, Lady Catherine, Lady Catherine, Im intoxicated with life.Have some!I chirped, waltzing merrily over to send another tiny shower her way.I flitted over to Christopher.Oops!Clumsy little me!I must have tripped on my hem.I pressed myself full length against Christophers tailored finery, leaving wet splotches on his white leather breeches and linen shirt.I looked up into his brown eyes for a responsive smile but saw that his appreciative gaze, instead of meeting mine, was preoccupied with another part of my person.A quick glance around revealed that the other gentlemen present were similarly engaged.Looking down, I saw that my waterlogged gown was clinging tightly to my figure.I reached out a muddy fist to chuck Sir Lesley under the chin.I dont know what youre staring at.Its nothing you havent seen before.Then on tiptoe, I plucked a limp, bedraggled peacock feather from my sodden curls and threaded it through Lord Dearbornes buttonhole.There, I said, patting his lapel.I think this belongs to you, it must have fallen out of your tail.I turned to my sisters.Come, girls, I said, holding out my arms to them.Assist me to my boudoir.I fear my attire is too fashionable for this particular company.I was laughing so hard I could not trust my legs to carry me; the twins came in handy as I took my leave.Halfway up the grand stone staircase, we met Mrs.Goodbody, who hustled me into my bedroom, clucking that I would catch my death in cold.After the twins and I had our lunch on gleaming silver trays in the old nursery (the same one where my mother had once taught the Peterby daughters), I took a long, luxurious afternoon nap and awoke feeling depressed as Hades.There, on the cherrywood tagre next to the empty limestone fireplace, was the box of old books, maps, and naval paraphernalia that had been so precious to Admiral Barfreston.I went over to paw through them, stopping to polish the tarnished brass instruments with loving care.The maps were interesting.Some were crazily outdated, a glimpse into another world, with hand drawn pictures of hideous dragons, griffins, and demons in the margins.I decided to take the box into Mudbury to show the vicar.He would appreciate the contents.I was tucking away an astrolabe, or some such thing, when a buxom parlor maid came in to inform me that dinner would be an hour early tonight, so Id best start making ready.She added that the Macreadys were to join us; dinner had been moved up to accommodate the squire, who stolidly kept country hours.In fact, before I had finished dressing, I could hear voices in the entrance hall and knew the company had arrived.I was in no mood to enter the parlor alone, after the way I had misbehaved that afternoon.Still, whenever I thought of how Lady Catherine had looked with her eyes jumping from their sockets, I would almost start to laugh again!I had been dreadful and not even ashamed at the way my dress clung to me.But when I am gripped by the giggles, there is nothing under our bold sun that can inhibit me.I finished my preparations and knocked on Lady Peterbys door to ask if I could accompany her down the stairs.How good of you, Elizabeth.I wish all the young people had your consideration.It is difficult for me to navigate, you know.I flushed and admitted, Im not really as considerate as you think, Lady Peterby.I came to walk downstairs with you because Im shy of entering the drawing room by myself.I received a laugh and a quick hug in reply.A moment, dear, said Lady Peterby, patting the seat of the brocade settee invitingly.I think that we must talk, just a little.Obediently, I sat down next to her.Lady Peterby regarded her fingertips reflectively and then turned to look approvingly at me.How lovely you are tonight.Well, if you still blush at a compliment from an old lady then the London beaux must be a great deal tamer than they were in my day!Ahem, in fact it is about the London beaux that I wanted to talk to you.Without doubt Anne is a sweet creature and the most well meaning girl, but she is really too young to have the charge of chaperoning you.Something has upset you.Lord, is my face as translucent as a window?I shook my head in hasty denial.No, no, my dear, do not deny it.I assure you that I have neither the right nor the intention of prying into things that you would not have me know.However, I shall tell you this.Whatever the world may say, I still retain some control over my tempestuous offspring.If he is the source of your distress, I beg you will confide in me because I would not for the world have you plagued by him.She paused to pat my hand and smile again.I see you are surprised.You think that Ive let my partiality blind me to Lesleys faults.He is a wild, unstable boy, I know, bad tempered, impetuous, and selfish.But beneath that rake hell, hedonistic crust is intelligence and a great deal of honesty.Adulthood comes more easily to some.You mean adultery comes more easily to some, I thought.But for all that I was able to assure her that her son was not the source of my distress.In truth, if it hadnt been for Lord Lesleys intervention that night in the slums, might I now be under even greater distress?Then it is Nicky.It was a simple statement and it was the simple truth.Youve fallen in love with him, havent you?I was afraid that might happen.It seems to be a natural consequence of putting any female in contact with him.The boy was always far too easy on the eyes for the comfort of everyone concerned, including himself.And combine that with a set of the most engaging manners, an old and respected title, and a vulgarly large fortune and you will see a far less steady boy than Nicky ruined before he can even appreciate what he has.For all that, though, theres a great deal of sweetness in Nicky, if only someone would encourage him to show it.But what can you expect when the women that he spends most of his leisure with are high born hussies like Lady Catherine?I gave a watery giggle.Probably, had not Lady Peterbys top lofty dresser come in at that moment to say Lord Peterby desired speech with his mama, I would have then unburdened myself thankfully before this kindly, sympathetic audience.I had barely time to straighten up before Lord Peterby strode into the room, favoring my sodden countenance with a brief, irritable glance, and said, Well, dont look with daggered eyes at me, Maman.I didnt make her cry!Nonsense.Shes not crying.There was a bit of dust in her eye.And you might do me the courtesy of knocking instead of sweeping into the room like a prizefighter lurching into the ring.Just because you will persist in hobnobbing with the horrid fellowship does not give you leave to imitate their manners in this house.You might remember that you were at least born a gentleman.And I want Lady Catherine out of this house by tomorrow afternoon.She is a disgrace to the good name she bears.I will not have you lodging your whores in my home.Whew!I took one scared peep at Lord Peterby and was surprised to see an ironic grin on his saturnine countenance.He bowed in full court style to his mama.As you wish, he replied cordially.Much as I relished hearing one of societys dangerous blades being chewed out by his mother, Im still glad it was she and not I who told him off.Its cornplants to cobwebs he would have blacked my eye.Dinner went as well as could be expected under the circumstances.I could see that Lady Peterby was trying to keep me out of as much undesirable company as possible, so I was seated between Christopher and Jeffrey Macready, who leaned over me to talk to each other of sport and horses.Anyone in Christophers set was a safe enough companion for me.Its not that they were so virtuous; but Christopher was so ready to sport canvas in my defense, and his friends had developed a healthy respect for his robust right.Unfortunately, I wasnt far enough away from Lady Catherine (to be honest, nothing under twenty miles would be far enough away) to avoid hearing her salacious flirtation with Lord Dearborne.The food turned to coal dust in my mouth.Everything Lady Peterby and Mrs.Goodbody said about her was right.She was a clever, scheming, manhunting coquette.And I wished fervently that I could be just like her.Whatever fault the good ladies Peterby and Goodbody might find with Lady Catherine, the marquis didnt seem to share their negative views.He listened to her suggestive chatter with casual amusement, a slow smile often decorating his sensuous lips.All of the men present seemed to be preoccupied in like fashion.She would lean over to talk or listen, gracefully managing to make some physical contact with her conversant, and let the neckline of her gown droop enough to allow the entire French army to march through on maneuvers.Her conversation may not have been the most edifying, but the males present were getting a good lesson in female anatomy.I found myself wondering if Lord Peterby would obey his wise mother and send Lady Catherine packing.At last the meal was over, and Lady Peterby gave the customary signal for the ladies to withdraw and leave the men to their talk.We withdrew into a sitting room, and Lady Catherine turned her charms on us; she seemed much easier to take without the men around, confining herself to items of London gossip instead of flaunting her beauty.Cecilia and I began to relax under her anecdotes.She really was an interesting and flattering companion on this basis, but her efforts to get on Lady Peterbys good side were fruitless.Her most ingenious tidbits of information roused nothing more from Lady Peterby than the smallest of civil exclamations.The lateness of the hour eventually forced our gathering to a close.Lady Catherines room was near my own and I found myself ascending the staircase with the still verbal beauty.We made our goodnights, and I had just finished changing into my nightgown when Lady Catherine knocked on my door.She said: Elizabeth, do you mind coming to my room for a moment?I want to show you something I recently bought in London.Perhaps your knowledge of classical civilization will help me.Although I was ready for bed, her invitation was polite and she seemed to desire my help.I was intrigued.I went with her into the room and she motioned me to the bed, and then turned to remove something from her portmanteau.She turned and showed me a cameo, and we held it up to the light to examine it.I bought this at Hepworths, she said.They told me it was Greek but I wanted your opinion.Could you tell me anything about it?Of course, I said.That is Eos, the goddess of dawn, pouring the morning from an ewer.I really dont know enough about it to tell you if it is authentic or not.Im not that much of a scholar, really.Now, dont be modest, she said.You certainly know more about it than I.  I had not the slightest idea what this cameo depicted.And neither did the dealer for that matter.I couldnt help feeling a little proud of myself at that moment.It probably showed on my face.Im so ignorant of classical civilization, she continued.Why dont you sit and have a glass of wine with me and tell me what you know.I was hesitant.I didnt like to drink spirits after my experience at that particular ball in London.Well just have a little, she said reassuringly, pouring some for us.To be polite I gave in, feeling that I would just swallow the minimum and then take my leave.To my surprise, the wine tasted not at all unpleasant, and in no time at all, I asked for another glass.It made me feel so relaxed.I had had a hard day of playing and partying, and it was rather pleasant to sit with Lady Catherine and talk about matters that interested me.She paid such rapt attention as I warmed to my subject; we were sitting with our legs crossed, chatting like schoolgirls.I noticed my tongue beginning to trip while I was making important points about Homer; my eyes were beginning to blur, and my eyelids to droop.I felt so good, but it was time for bed.Dear Elizabeth, I feel I have kept you so late.Let me help you to your room, Lady Catherine was saying.No, I can make it all right, I said.I was wrong.My legs would not hold me up.Ill help, she said.Its no trouble.I was being supported by Lady Catherines soft shoulder, making my way down the dark hallway.Now I was being put to bed, at long last.A fire was flickering swimmingly in the fireplace and Lady Catherine was tucking the cover under my chin in a cozy, maternal way.Have pleasant dreams, Elizabeth, she said.How could I have ever been so wrong about her, I was thinking.Shes really very nice.I was falling and floating into sleep.Fifteen I dont know what it was that brought my mind back to spinning consciousness.Perhaps it was the discomfort of my nightgown which had twisted itself around my body like swaddling bands.The silent room blurred in opaque firelight.Several weak, fretful attempts to free myself from the clinging silk left me panting with exhaustion.My limbs seemed unable to respond to my commands.Was I ill?I certainly felt ill.The fear that I was sick crept over me, the fear that I wouldnt be able to call for help.I would lay here dying, dying alone.Even the bedroom looked strange to me.I didnt remember the heavy mahogany dresser with racing forms tossed casually on it.Racing forms?I struggled to prop myself up on one elbow just as I heard the sound of voices in the hallway.I concentrated on gathering my energy, to make one great effort to call for help.As I did my eyes focused for one hazy instant on the bedstand and saw there the large signet ruby of Lesley Peterby.In one stricken flash I knew that I had been betrayed.I heard the door handle clunk and Lord Peterbys voice.and I promise you, Nicky, that it was His voice died as he saw me.His expression was filled with such surprise that I wondered if I had become in some way deformed.My hand rose limply to my face.He spun around to Lord Dearborne and gripped hard at his shoulders.His eyes looked straight and clearly into those of the marquis.His voice was hard: God as my witness, Nicky, I swear that shes not here by my design.Seeing her here is as much a shock to me as it is to you.Lord Dearbornes face seemed as if all emotion were torn from it.The eyes that met Peterbys were curiously blank.Dont you think I know that?You wouldnt have let me in here otherwise.His voice was soft but became light and dangerous as he turned his gaze to me.
