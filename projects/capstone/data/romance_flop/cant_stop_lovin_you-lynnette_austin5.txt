Ripped abs.Oh, Lordy, what this man hid under his black T shirts and this crisp, white dress shirt.His mouth roamed over her face, her neck.His fingers tunneled through her hair, and she cried out.Aware shed no doubt hate herself in the morning, Maggie threw caution to the wind and simply stopped thinking.His hands on her felt so good.The zipper to her dress slid down, and Brawley slipped it over her shoulders.It whispered over her body, his mouth following.He tossed it to the floor.The wisp of lace covering her breasts followed.He drew back, his eyes hot.A fingertip toyed with the emerald and silver ring piercing her navel.He sucked in his breath.Panties and stilettos.What a combination.Youre beautiful, Red.So beautiful.Tangled together on that wonderfully soft leather sofa, his fingers moved to the edge of her panties.His lips inches from her skin, he whispered, Are you on birth control?He might as well have dumped a bucket of cold water on her.An ache tore through her, and she stiffened as reason returned.Now?He thought to ask her that now?Too bad he hadnt kept that in mind years ago.But then, their hormones had raged so violently, had been so uncontrollable, neither of them really cared.No, Brawley, Im not.She pulled away, tried to sit.I dont make a habit of falling into bed with guys nor had I planned on it tonight.Let me up.What?She ran a hand through her hair and gave him a small push.It was like running into a concrete wall.This isnt right.Why?Becausebecauseargh.There are a thousand reasons.Realizing what had almost happened, what had happened, her heart kicked into racing mode.We never finished things properly.You had your say, but I never really had mine.I couldnt think straight that night, and I let you go without telling you how I felt.But this wont help.Hurt darkened his eyes.How do you know that, Maggie?Because Im leaving.Youre staying.Last time around, I stayed and you left.Theres no future for us.An arm over her breasts, she sat up and reached for her bra, draped over the back of the sofa.Brawley tugged at her arm, and she jerked it away.Quit.Youre gorgeous, Maggie.You were incredible at seventeen, at eighteen.NowI dont have the words.He rose on an elbow to kiss her.She turned her face away.I think its time to have that talk, Red.For both of us to share.Not now.Not tonight.It wont do any good, Brawley.We waited too long.A few words cant erase years of pain.No, I dont suppose they can, but we could make a start.She shook her head, slipping her bra straps up her arms.We already did that.Years ago.You and I made a start, a beginning.Then we ended.Your choice.Her voice trembled.Tonight was a huge mistake.How can you say that?Easy.I move my lips You dont want me?Is that it?He sat on the edge of the love seat.I did.I wanted you more than I wanted my next breath.But too much has happened, too much has changed.God forgive her.She was lying through her teeth.She wanted this more than shed ever wanted anything.Maybe she was making an even bigger mistake by not grabbing this night with Brawley.But the moment for that had passed.He was on his feet, stabbing his arms into his shirtsleeves, his jaw set, that sensual mouth compressed tightly.No doubt about it.He was good and pissed.Well, too bad.So was she, mostly at herself for letting things go so far, get so out of hand.She picked her dress up off the floor and shook it out.Scattered hairpins dusted the cowhide rug.Thered be no fixing her hair.Shed run her fingers through the tousled mass and hope no one noticed.I need to go, Brawley.I left my car at Dotties.My folks will be worried.No, they wont.When you ran in to grab your purse, I told your dad I was bringing you here.You what?She drew back.I told your dad I heard you, she hissed.God, she sounded like a fishwife.Rubbing her hands over her face, she said, I cant believe you did that.Why?He was looking for you.I didnt want them worrying.Hell know.So?So?Flabbergasted, she stared at him.So I dont want my dad knowing Im off making out with you.See, there you go with your snap judgments, Margaret Emmalee.How did I know you had that in mind?Her mouth dropped open.Guilt made her angrier still.Of all the arrogant Dont.He laid a finger over her lips.Dont say something youll regret.She brushed his hand aside.Take me back to Dotties.They finished dressing in silence.Feeling like dirt, she walked to his SUV while he locked up and set the security system.She couldnt blame Brawley for what had just happened.No.Shed been right there with him.What theyd shared on that couch tonight had been magic.So had dancing in his arms under the stars.But, then, reality struck.Magic didnt really exist, did it?Smoke and mirrors.Thats what the two of them had always been.Shed simply been too nave to realize it their first go around.Shed been wrong, though, thinking shed exaggerated the chemistry between them.No one affected her like he did.She doubted anyone ever would, mores the pity.Neither spoke on their way through the small town.When they reached Dotties, Brawley strolled around the front of the vehicle to open her door.Everything was quiet, the house and grounds dark.There you go, Cinderella.Home before your fancy dress turns into rags and your chauffeur into a rat.He removed his hat and bowed low.I wouldnt be too sure about that last part.Low blow, darlin.Sorry.Brawley, tonight was She raked fingers through her tangled hair.Youve done a beautiful job with the clinic, and I wish you well in your new venture.She dug out her keys and started toward her car.He snagged her arm.Wait a minute.Thats it?No.She jangled the keys in her hand.She had to do this and do it now before she lost her courage.The truth wouldnt set either of them free, would only complicate things and cause more hurt.A small piece of her brain screamed at the injusticeto both of thembut she ignored it.Drawing on an inner strength she hadnt known she possessed, she said, Thank you.I needed this.Tonight was like the period at the end of a sentence.The period at the end of a sentence?What the hell are you talking about?It was closure, Brawley.Youre wrong, Maggie.She shook her head.No, Im not.You and me She shrugged, swallowed the lump in her throat.Well, there is no you and me.How can you say that?We have years of history.Yes, we do.Heres the thing, Brawley.History is a damn cold bed partner.And in case youve forgotten, youre the one who made us history.Me?Id assumed wed be present and future.Maggie No.She closed her eyes.Pretend I didnt say that.But you did, and I cant unhear it.Sure you can.Youve unheard lots Ive said in the past.Brawley stuffed his hands in his pockets and sighed.Boy, you sure as hell hold a grudge.You could teach classes on it.Probably so.You chose your dream over me, Brawley.There was nothing I could do.No way I could change things.So maybe I needed tonight, but it wont happen again.She stumbled to her car.Fought to fit the key into the ignition.Blinking back tears, she threw the car in reverse.Brawley stood in the beams of her headlights, starkly silhouetted against the darkness.He was angry.Very angry.She wouldnt think about it.At the end of the street, she turned south and began the long drive to Lone Tree and a future that didnt include Brawley Odell.Time she charted a course without him.And she would.In New York City.How many times did you have to burn your fingers before you stepped away from the fire?The tear that dripped from her chin went ignored.Twelve  Maggie yawned.How could it be morning already?Shed barely slept.It had been strange coming home to an empty house last night, knowing her grandfather was on his honeymoon.Probably best she didnt dwell on that.She threw an arm across her forehead.Yesterday had been exhausting, both physically and emotionally.But at the same time, it had been wonderful, and her grandfather had a life companion again.Dottie would take good care of him and he of her.Last night, though, shed screwed up badly.Brawley, in his tailored suit, had about knocked her off her feet.A Texas cowboy from the tips of his boots to the crown of his Stetson, he cleaned up darn well.Closing her eyes, she could still feel his skilled hands running over her body, exciting her.Could still taste him, the thrill of those lips trailing over her face, her neck.Lower.Those deep blue eyes had caressed her.His thick, dark hair had driven her wild as shed run her fingers through it.All these years, as much as shed tried not to, shed dreamed of holding him, sharing kisses with him again.Well, now she hadseveral times this past week.Damn if he wasnt like sugar, though.One taste and she craved another and another and another.On an intellectual level, she understood she was being extremely unfair to him.Deep down she expected him to make amends for the past.But how could he fix something when he didnt understand how broken it truly wasand why?Shed come so close last night to telling him about the baby.What good would that do, though?Hed be racked with guilt.For what?He couldnt change what had happened.And at this point in her life?She had to put it behind her for good.Had to move past it.This was her time.Her chance to shoot for the stars.If that made her selfish, so be it.Shed protected Brawley from the truth all these yearsand would continue to.She tossed back the bed covers.She and Brawley had had their moment, and it was gone.Over.Last night could never, ever happen again.Would never happen again.That was the way it had to be.Once shed come to her senses last night and her brain began functioning again, shed realized shed miscalculated horribly.At least shed called a halt to it beforewell, before.Shed allow herself today to lick her wounds and wallow in self pity.One final day of mourning what could have been.When she went to bed tonight, shed be done with it.With the wedding over, she could concentrate on her upcoming move.Shed grab a shower, throw on her rattiest outfit, and fix herself a nice breakfast.Then shed roll up her sleeves and pack.Time to decide what would go with her and what shed store in the attic.Pops and Dottie would be gone for a few days.When they returned, they planned to spend a few nights at her house.Maggie assumed they wanted to give her space.And it would give them private time to settle into their marriage.What newlyweds needed a third thumb?They were bound to spend some time here after she left for New York.Stepping into the shower, Maggie sighed, then lathered her hair.How odd to think of another woman in Grandma Trudys house.But time brought changes.If Gramps could move on, so could she.She would.She had.Shed built a great little business.Women drove a hundred miles to visit her boutique.As she rinsed her hair, Maggie admitted the chances were good that Pops would sell this house.Women tended to nest deeper than men.Dottie would want to stay in Maverick Junction, and that was probably the smartest decision.Her place would be far easier to maintain than this big old house.The move would put Pops closer to her mom and dad, too, if he ever needed them.Her melancholy deepened.There would be no coming home ever again.Stepping from the shower, she pressed the power button for her stereo and sang along with Lady Antebellums newest song.Fortified by a couple scrambled eggs and a huge glass of orange juice, she tackled her room.Knee deep in boxes and old newspapers, she started when her phone rang.Blowing a strand of hair from her eyes, she checked the clock.Eleven thirty.Where had the morning gone?By the third ring, shed unearthed her phone, hoping it was Pops.It wasnt.It was Sophie.Hey, girlfriend, why dont you hop in the car and come over for lunch?Thanks, but Im good, Sophie.Come on.I know you.Youre moping around that empty house.Maggie laughed.I started out that way this morning and gave myself a few minutes of pity me.But I have so much to take care of, I couldnt wallow for long.What are you doing right now?Packing up my personal things and trying to decide what Ill leave here and what Ill ship to New York.You can do that tonight.I need you to come save me.From what?Tys out in the barn with a sick cow.Maggie could almost see the grimace twist Sophies lips.City to the core, she still struggled with ranch life.That leaves me here with the three little ones.I could use an adult to talk to.Oh, youre good, Sophie Rawlins.Her friend sighed.Sophie Rawlins.I still find it hard to believe Ty and I are really married.Youre happy.I am.Now get in the car and get over here.Give me about forty minutes.You dont even want to see me looking the way I do.Come on.You couldnt look bad if you tried.Maggie glanced at the large mirror against the far wall.She took in her wildly curling red hair, the dust on the tip of her nose, the raggedy sweatshirt and cut offs.Oh, believe me, I could scare small children right now.I seriously doubt it.After a second, Sophie said, That might not be a bad thing.Get over here and scare these three boys into cleaning their room.Hanging up, Maggie took in the chaos around her.Piles covered every surface.Clothes lay heaped on her bed.Knickknacks and keepsakes peeked out of half packed boxes.Yikes.Sophie was right, though.This mess would still be here when she got home.Unfortunately.Since no one else would see it, what difference did it make?Even though shed showered only a couple hours earlier, she took another quick one, swiped on some mascara, and fought her hair into submission.Digging through the mess, she uncovered a pair of denim shorts and a favorite casual, short sleeve linen shirt.She moved to her open window.Texas at her finest.The day was made for being outside.A break would do her good.Hands on her hips, Maggie took one last look at the disaster shed created, powered off her stereo, and walked out the door.Driving through Lone Tree, she stopped at Ollies.Packed with the after church group, it took her a good ten minutes to make it to the counter.Everyone wanted to talk about the wedding and ask if shed heard from Pops and Dottie.She slid onto a stool.Hey, sweetheart, Ollie said.Howre you doing today?Tired.Bet you are.That was some party yesterday.It was, wasnt it?Im glad you and Judy could make it.Me, too.That nephew of mine comes in handy once in a while.He did an okay job running the place yesterday.You need to use him more often.Give you and Judy some time for yourselves.Ollie nodded and wiped a hand on his apron.Ive been thinking about that.Weve been busy, and Ive been toying with the idea of hiring more help.Lots of folks coming into Lone Tree to visit the new fashion darlings shop.He winked.They get hungry and stop in here.Judy and I can barely keep up.Youve been good for the whole town, Maggie.I hope so.Oh, believe me, you have.Hands on his hips, he asked, What can I do for you today?Do you have an extra lemon meringue pie I can talk you out of?Maybe a dozen chocolate chips to go with it?For you?You bet.Give me a minute.He headed to the walk in cooler.Halfway there, one of the guys at the counter asked for a coffee refill.Keep your britches on, he growled.Cant you see Im busy?Maggie shook her head.Oh, yeah.Shed miss this.Armed with her goodies, she walked back to her car, a smile on her face.The grass was turning green, bluebonnets bobbed their heads along the side of the road, and the sun was shining.Maggie put all four windows down.So it would wreck her hair.Who cared?She turned up the country western station on her radio and let the weight slip from her shoulders as the breeze wafted over her.It wouldnt be long till theyd be sweltering in hundred and five degree temperatures.In the shade.No.She wouldnt be here.Shed be in the city.Back East.When her shoulders tightened, she consciously relaxed them.Today, shed spend some time with Sophie and her newly acquired sons.They could gossip their hearts out.They could talk about nothing.They could sit quietly in the sun and simply be.Maggie started down the lane to Ty and Sophies, then hit the brakes.Oh, those best laid plans.Brawleys black Tahoe sat in the drive.She couldnt face him today.Not after last night.Her armor wasnt in place.Should she turn around and go home?Eat herself into a lemon meringue stupor?Too late.Shed been spotted.Jesse hopped up and down in the front yard, and Jonah waved.She waved back, dread crawling up her throat.Josh ran into the house and, by the time shed stopped her car, reappeared with Sophie in tow.Maggie opened the car door and got out.Here you go, guys.She handed Jesse the bag of cookies.You cant eat any till after lunch, though.Okay, Jonah said.What are they?Jesse opened the bag and peered in.Josh stuck his head closer.I wanna see, too.Sophie, he wont let me see.Show him whats in there, Jesse.Sophie brushed a hand over her sleek blond hair.Why dont you take the bag inside and set it on the table?Kay.The three took off at a run, Jesse clutching the bag of goodies.I see you have company.Maggie tipped her head toward Brawleys vehicle.Ty didnt know what to do about that sick cow, so he decided to bring in the big guns.I didnt plan this, Sophie insisted.I had no idea hed called Brawley when I phoned you.Honest.Maggie said nothing.Sophie narrowed her eyes.Whats going on?Youre white as a sheet.Its a long story.And Ive got plenty of time.Maggie shrugged.What happened?Sophie prodded.I know you left with him last night, and Ive got to say I was shocked.Your dad said The boys came tearing out of the house, screaming like banshees.Can we play till lunch is ready?Stay close.When I call, I expect you all to come immediately and wash up.No whining.Kay, Jonah said.The other two agreed, and they were off, their now half grown pup Trouble at their heels.I lost my mind, Maggie said.Sophies eyes narrowed.What did you do?I came this close to sleeping with Brawley.Maggie held up her thumb and forefinger, only a millimeter between them.Her lips felt stiff.What?Sophie dropped onto one of the Adirondack chairs in the yard.Maggie joined her in another.Though she hadnt intended to, she found herself confessing last nights transgressions.We got carried away.One thing led to another, and, well, I almost caved.Whew.Yeah.Maybe I should have.Really?Maggie shook her head.No.But it was good?Sophie asked.Its always mind blowing with him.I can Sophie broke off when Jesse started screaming.Snake!Snake!He ran toward the barn, while the other two stood rooted to the ground.Sophie and Maggie both ran toward them.Ty and Brawley shot out of the barn.The boys were in tears and nearly hysterical.Stay back, Ty shouted.Boys, go to Sophie.But, Daddy, Jonah sobbed.Trouble got hurted.I know, son.Go to Sophie, he repeated.They did.Brawley dashed back into the barn and grabbed a shovel.He started across the field, while Ty called Trouble to him.Whats he doing?Sophie, eyes wide, clutched the boys to her, shushing them.You might want to take the boys into the house.Why?Brawley raised the shovel, brought it down once, twice.Maggie and Sophie winced, and the boys cried harder.Rattler, Brawley said, striding toward them.Did it bite any of you?He knelt in front of the boys.They shook their heads, tears streaming.It was gonna bite Jesse, Josh said.But Trouble growled and bit it.Then he cried cause the bad snake bit him back.Is he gonna die?Jonahs lip trembled.Maggie watched the overgrown pup, which had made his way to the boys and was now licking their hands.The boys wrapped their arms around him.Ty met Sophies eyes.Voice husky, he said, This big, overgrown idiot of a pup saved Jesses life.She nodded and swallowed.Is there anything we can do?Maggie looked at Brawley.Can you help him?Yeah, I can take care of this mangy pup.Hes gonna be fine.His voice was gruff.Sophie, Maggie, why dont you take the boys inside?Feed them lunch.Everythings gonna be fine, but this isnt something they need to see.Sophie nodded.Before they left, though, the boys surrounded Brawley, hugging his legs.Make him all better.I will.Brawley ruffled one head, then another.He knelt again to put himself on their level and hooked a finger under Troubles collar.You go inside with Sophie.By the time youve eaten lunch, Trouble will be fine.But I need to take care of him now.Its kind of like you guys going to the doctor.Is he gonna get a shot?Jonah asked.They hurt.I wont hurt him, Brawley promised.Josh wrapped his pudgy arms around Brawleys neck and kissed him.He returned the kiss, then gave him a man pat on the back.Sophie started toward the house with the boys in tow.Brawleys gaze met Maggies, then traveled down the length of her.He whistled.Not much of those jeans escaped, did they?Her mouth dropped open and, despite herself, she tugged at the fabric.He grinned.I like the shorts.You make them look real good.Now?Your heads going there now?He shrugged.Works for me.Youre hot as sin today, Red.He raised the back of his hand and swiped at his forehead.You turn even a cool spring day into a real scorcher.He scooped Trouble in his arms and headed to the barn.Maggie watched him go.Did the cowboy ever think of anything else?she wondered.She looked at the kids racing each other to the house, then back at Brawley with an armful of dog.Yeah, he did.Sophie must have been reading her mind because as Maggie reached her, she leaned toward her and whispered, Hes always here when we need him.Yes, he was, Maggie thought.Hed been there with Ty when Nathan had attacked Sophie and now when the rattler threatened the boys and Troubles lives.If only hed been there for herand their baby.As shed watched him with the boys, she realized what a great dad hed have made.What a great dad he might still makewith someone else.Thirteen  The clinic was a madhouse.Brawley rushed from exam room to exam room.He needed caffeine.No wonder Doc Gibson hadnt been able to keep up this pace.Phyllis, will you finish up the poodle in Room One?Ive cleaned the wound on his leg and bandaged it.His shots are updated, too.I need to see him in seven days.If you could set that up Got it.Mrs.Williams called.She wants to know if were boarding dogs.She and her husband are taking a three day cruise and need someone to watch their dachshund.Nope.Call her back.Give her Dawn Maries number.Shell take good care of Hannibal.After a couple days with her, he probably wont want to go home.Brawley rubbed the back of his neck.You think theres a chance of talking Bobby Sue into making a fresh pot of coffee?You can try.Miracles happen every day.He rolled his eyes.Little Davey Iverson and his mom are in Room Three, Phyllis said.He found a bird with a broken wing and wants to know if you can fix it.That Nate and Missys son?Yep.Hes in first grade this year.Guess hes playing hooky today to take care of the bird.Halfway out the door, Brawley stopped.Youre kidding.Theyve got a kid whos that old already?Times moving on, Doctor.You might want to think of having some little ones of your own.I saw you and Maggie dancing Saturday at Fletch and Dotties reception.It reminded me of the two of you during high school.Dont hold your breath.He opened the door and stepped out.Maggies And there she stood at the reception counter.The smile she sent him was more than a little shaky, actually touched on shy.He hadnt figured she had a timid bone in her body.The cobbler she held smelled heavenly, even over the smell of animal and disinfectant.For me?Yes.She took a deep breath.I wanted to thank you and thought a fresh peach cobbler might do the trick.Dont suppose you brought coffee?She shook her head.He strode across to her and took the offered dessert.I wont say no to this, butIm not quite sure what youre thanking me for.If its for Saturday night, let me just say the pleasure was almost mine.Intrigued, he watched the color bloom on her cheeks.Maggie Sullivan was an interesting mix of wanton sex appeal and unabashed innocence.Her brow shot up.If youre not careful, you might be wearing that.She nodded at the dish.You saved Troubles life yesterday.Those boys dote on that rascal of a pup.If he hadnt got between Jesse and that rattler, or if hed She blew out a breath, unable to finish the sentence.Tears filled her enormous green eyes.Hey.He set the cobbler on the counter.Nothing happened.Jesse didnt get snake bit, and the mutts good as new today.Because you were there.He shrugged.I drove out to Burnt Fork to check on him before I opened today.Early morning for you.Got that right.He ran a hand over his already stubble roughened chin.Trouble apparently felt good enough sometime during the night to eat one of Sophies new shoes.She might not be feeling as benevolent toward him this morning as you do.The only casualty was the snakewho was probably minding his own business till three rowdy boys and their overgrown pup intruded on his territory.Maggie grinned.Thank you all the same.He lowered his voice.I thought you hated me.I never said that.I hate what you did, not you.And dont you dare read anything into that.He threw back his head and laughed.Maggie Sullivan, youre impossible.Good bye, Doctor Odell.Im leaving now.Thanks for the dessert, Maggie.Youre welcome, she threw over her shoulder.Mags, wait.He reached out, took hold of her arm.Are you in a hurry?Not particularly.Ellas covering the store today.Great.He held up a finger, then stuck his head in the first exam room.Phyllis, no ones waiting right now.Can you hold the fort while I take ten?Ill handle Davey and his bird before I go.You bet.She eyed the cobbler he held again.Dont suppose this break has anything to do with the redhead who brought that in.He tossed her a careless smile and closed the door.Then he turned back to Maggie.Do you mind waiting a few minutes?Davey Iverson found an injured bird this morning.Go.Heal.Ill be right here.Thanks.He watched her walk to the waiting area, those incredible hips swaying and driving him insane.He sure wished she was wearing yesterdays short denims.There couldnt have been a half a yard of material in them.They showcased those legs of hers and made a man hungry.Made him want to slide a finger up the length of all that creamy, silky skin.The longing was even more intense now, after their close encounter.Hed thought if he could have another taste, hed be satiated.Instead it had been like a drop of water on the tongue of a man dying of dehydration.A single taste of what he couldnt have.Daveys bird turned out to be a male painted bunting.Wow, hes a real beauty, pal.He looks like somebody colored him.Yeah, you got that right.Hes hurt.Davey got close to the cage and pointed.Yes, he is.We can fix him, though.Sure glad you brought him to me.You did a good job.The boy grinned and puffed out his chest.It didnt take long.Brawley splinted the wing and talked to Davey and his mom about the care the bird would need till it could fly again.Brawley shook Daveys hand.Hell be good as new in no time.Nice job, buckaroo.Thanks.Davey lowered his eyes and studied the floor.Mom says I cant keep him.Your moms right.Hes a wild creature and needs to be free.Okay.I thought maybe next time we went to Austin we could stop at a pet store, Missy said.Give a canary or a finch a home.Really?A grin split the little boys freckled face.Really.Oh, boy.He skipped around the room.Okay, settle down.His mom handed him the cage.Here you go.You can carry this out to the car while I pay our bill.Brawley shook his head.No bill.No charge.This ones on the house.Are you sure?Positive.Davey walked out, proud as a peacock, with his wounded bird.Thanks again, Brawley.Were all glad youve come home.Brawley smiled at her and watched her walk away.Not everyone was all that happy hed returned.He leaned against the doorjamb and watched Maggie.She stopped Davey and oohed and ahhed over the bird, listening to his plans for one of his own.Her enthusiasm was genuine.She was good with kids.He wondered if shed ever have any.Right now, though, the two of them had a dateof sorts.He didnt have time to take her anywhere.Sallys would be too slow.Besides, it wouldnt be private enough.Not that theyd particularly need privacy.Still He considered his options.His office was out.It reeked of emotion after Saturday evening.Maybe they could take a short walk.Right now was when he missed the myriad of coffee shops hed grown used to in Dallas.Ducking into his office, he grabbed two sodas from his mini fridge.Cold caffeine.A quick glance showed no patients in the waiting area.Thank God.After that flurry this morning, they could use a breather.Maggie studied the photos hed hung along one wall.Are these yours?she asked.He nodded.Seriously?Seriously.Youve captured such emotion.She stopped in front of one with a young boy kissing a large Dalmatian, then at another of a very elderly lady, her wrinkled face not totally unlike that of the pug she cradled.I try.You succeed.Did you get some this good at Popss wedding?Oh, if she only knew.He thought guiltily of the ones hed taken of her.In one, shed been pouting and looked especially sexy.Not sure what had made him do it, hed printed that shot and then framed the damned thing.If she wandered into his bedroomhis breath caught just thinking about thatshed pitch one hell of a fit.I got some really nice ones, yeah.He held out a hand to her.Its a gorgeous day and not too hot yet.How about a short stroll?Looking down at her feet, he saw strappy little sandals.Dark green toenails peeked up at him.Those okay for walking?Absolutely.She bit her lip.Were not going to, um, rehash our, ah, last conversation, are we?Why, Maggie, you sound nervous.She frowned.Im not nervous.Of course not.Youre not afraid of anything, are you?You might be surprised.No.We dont have to talk about Saturday.He handed her a soda.Ahhh.She popped the top as she stepped into the sunshine.Exactly what I needed.Neither spoke for a couple minutes.You leave Wednesday?Yep.Which means I have today and tomorrow to wrap things up.Im not taking much with me.Two suitcases.Thats it.If it doesnt fit in one of them, it doesnt go.What are you doing with the rest of your things?Id intended to leave some of my stuff in my bedroom at Popss and stash a few boxes in the attic.But considering the recent changes, Ive rethought that plan.Ill pack most of it and cart it to my parents.You think your grandfather will sell his place?Eventually.Dotties going to want to stay in her home.Women get more attached to a place.It would be a good move for Pops, really.Ill worry a lot less with him here in Maverick Junction than alone at his place, miles from town.And hell be closer to my parents.You think youll like New York?Brawley glanced at her, watched as she tipped the can back for a drink.When she flicked a drop from her lips, he bit back a groan.I know I will.Her eyes sparkled.Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine this actually happening.Ive been to New York twice now.Mom went with me last time.The city is energy and excitement.Its twenty four seven.Its She spread her hands.All the things Maverick Junction isnt.Her smile faded.I love Maverick Junction and Texas.I love the people here.This has been my whole life.But I need more, Brawley.So did you.He nodded and stuffed a hand in his pocket.Guess so.Studying her, he said, We cant seem to get the timing right, can we?She didnt say anything.After a few seconds, he asked, What did your mom think of the city?Maggie sighed.She loved the shopping, the plays, the restaurants.She didnt like the mass of people, though.Didnt like that she couldnt get in her car and simply go.If you ask her, shell say everything is more complicated there.No stopping into the grocery store and hauling things to your car.You need bottled water?Youd better be willing to tote it back to your apartment.None of that bothered you?To be honest, I was so busy working, it didnt even register.We stayed in a hotel and took all our meals out.Mom, however, extrapolated the myriad necessities of life and decided she couldnt live in the city.Its different.Yes.Youd know that, wouldnt you?He glanced at her and decided the comment wasnt snarky.To an extent, he answered.Dallas isnt New York, though.Dallas/Fort Worth has less than seven million people.You take the New York, northern New Jersey, Long Island area?Almost nineteen million.Big difference.But you enjoyed Dallas.I did.Always something going on.They both stopped, looked down Maverick Junctions one main street.Other than Sadlers Store, which was just down the road, this street comprised the towns entire business district.The post office, a florist, Mels newspaper office, Sallys Place, and a couple other small stores.That was it.It was what it was, and Brawley didnt regret his move.I cant wait.Maggie grinned.I can see that.Since it doesnt sound like you hit the streets sightseeing, what did you do while you were in New York before?The first time, I met with my backer, Owen Cook.She reached, without thought, for his hand.He took it, linked their fingers.I was so nervous, Brawley, I thought Id pee my pants.He quirked a brow.That might have been a first.She giggled.Dont I know it.The restaurant he took me to She rolled her eyes.Incredible.I tried to talk Ollie into adding a couple of the items to his menu, but he refused.He didnt think theyd go over as well in Lone Tree.He was probably right, Brawley said.How about the second trip?Oh, boy, was that ever labor intensive.Poor Mom.I didnt get nearly as much time with her as either of us would have liked.I did all the prep work for my show.I chose fabrics, got the workers started on the patterns and production.My designs for my very first ever show are in place minus whatever last minute tweaking I decide to do.Youre happy with them?I am.She smiled smugly.I intend to knock em dead with my line.The pieces work.Ive run them up in my workroom, fussed with them some more.Bottom line?I love every single garment.She closed her eyes.Fingers crossed the buyers will, too.She opened her eyes, met his.I lay awake at night worrying, though.What if my shows a flop?What if no one buys my clothes?What if no one even comes to the showing?It wont happen, Mags.Oh, I wish I was that certain.That confident.Wait a minute.He pulled back to stare into her eyes.Arent you the same woman who only minutes ago said youd knock them dead?She put a hand to the side of her face.I know.See what I mean?Its awful.I flip flop back and forth, back and forth.One minute Im on top of the world.The next I wonder why I ever thought I could do this.You shouldnt worry, Mags.Ive seen your work.Annie walked into the Now and Then fund raiser in Dallas wearing that dress of yours, and everyone in the room grew envious.The men because Annie was on Cashs arm and not theirs.The women because the dress was on Annies back instead of theirs.Maggie grinned.Thank you for that.Hey, just telling it like it is.He hesitated.So your dreams coming true.Finally, yes.You gonna be happy being a big city career woman?Why wouldnt I be?No reason at all.I watched you with Tys boys yesterday and with Davey Iverson today.Youre good with kids.Youve never wanted any of your own?Maggie reeled from the unexpected punch.Hurt, so deep seated, so intense, tore through her.Now.Tell him now.But she looked into those soulful blue eyes, and she couldnt.He didnt need to know.It was in the long ago past and had nothing to do with now.With this sunny spring day.So she forced a smile.I dont know.Maybe at some point itll be time for babies.A career and a family dont have to be mutually exclusive.No, they dont.He traced a pattern over her arm, sending shivers along her spine.His innocent question had scraped the old wound raw.She couldnt stay, couldnt make small talk.As nice as this has been, Brawley, I need to get going.I have to drop off the first few boxes at my parents, then drive back to Lone Tree and finish packing.My guess is that by now theyre wanting you back at the clinic, too.Youre doing a booming business.I think a few of this mornings visits centered around checking out the changes I made more than making sure their dogs were taking the right vitamins.And a few dropped in to check out the new doctor.He snorted.Hey, its not every day a town like Maverick Junction welcomes a hot, new vet.Her cheeks burned, and she could have bitten off her tongue.So you think Im hot, huh?Did I say that?She went for a teasing tone.In a roundabout way?Yeah, you did.She shrugged.I suppose someone might think that.But not you.Fishing for a compliment, Doctor Odell?She walked to the trash receptacle outside Mels and dropped her soda can inside.Brawley stayed where he was, took an overhead shot with his.When it dropped in cleanly, his fist pumped the air.Two points!Men, Maggie muttered.What would you do without us?Dont even get me started.She sent him a small smile, softening her words.He walked her to her car.Drive carefully.Ill see you tomorrow night at Bubbas.Her head snapped up.What?Your dad invited me to your going away dinner.She said nothing.If you dont want me there, say the word.I wont show.No, she said quickly.Everybody else is going to be there.You should, too.You sure?Totally.See you there.Time to escape.Keep it friendly, but get out of Dodge.Her emotions skittered all over the place.Once that plane took off Wednesday morning, shed be fine.Absolutely fine.She would be.Fourteen  Maggie felt like a dog chasing its tail.She needed, more than anything, a couple forty eight hour days.At her mom and dads, she unloaded several boxes and a suitcase full of clothes she wouldnt need.At least not right away.She and her dad stacked them in her bedroom closet.Her mother met them at the bottom of the stairs.Can you stay for lunch, honey?Oh, Mom, I have so much to do.Its all ready.We promise we wont hold you up.Its just that, well, come Thursday, you wont be here.And you have to eat.Okay, Maggie thought.Reality had finally sunk in.Shed wondered when theyd get to this.Shed actually expected it much sooner.Sure.The three of them sat down to eat, and Maggie realized her mother had gone to a lot of trouble with this lunch.When she placed Maggies favorite macaroni and cheese casserole on the table, her mouth watered.So much for losing a few pounds before she boarded that eastbound plane.The conversation revolved around her upcoming move until her mom got too emotional.Then they switched and talked about a neighbors herd, the prediction for this summers weather, anything and everything except the elephant in the room.They skirted what was foremost on all of their minds.When she finally drove away, she left a teary eyed mom behind.This might be harder than shed imagined.But theyd all get used to the change.Eventually.And it wasnt like she couldnt fly back anytime she wanted.Shed really only be a few hours away.She drove back to Lone Tree and found Ella swamped.She helped with the rush of customers, then hid away in the back room to finish the months orders.Ella knocked on the door, then stuck her head in.Maggie?Yes?Her eyes felt crossed from filling out too many online forms.I have to go.I need to pick up the kids.What time is it?A little after five.Youre kidding.Nope.Been busy back here, havent you?Maggie scooped her hair off her neck.Oh, boy, and how.Go.She shooed Ella away.Get those kids.Kick your shoes off and relax.Ella laughed.Ill do that.Dont work too late.She paused.Do you want me to put the closed sign up?No, Ill get it in a few minutes.Ella waved and left.Maggie heard the outside door shut behind her and realized this would be her last night to close up alone.She finished the order shed been working on, keeping an ear open for any customers who might wander in.No one came, and she found herself grateful for that.Walking into the boutique part of the shop, she flipped the open sign to closed.She leaned against the door, her gaze moving over the space.Proud of what shed done and feeling more than a little nostalgic, she blew out the vanilla candles shed placed around the shop, powered off the stereo, and picked up her purse.Everything in place; everything under control.Except her damn emotions.Shed fought back tears so many times today she was beginning to feel like the Hoover Dam.If anybody caught sight of her right now, theyd guess shed been handed a life sentence without the possibility of parole instead of the break shed been fighting for years to get.She locked the door behind her.Ollie knocked on the window across the street and waved.She waved back and blew him a kiss.As she slid behind the wheel of her car, she met her own eyes in the rearview mirror.Nobody here but us girls, Maggie Emmalee.Why dont you admit its not only the leaving thats got you tied up in knots?Its that damn cowboy come home from Dallas eating at you, too.Brawley had picked a heck of a time to return.If he wasnt here, she swore shed be escaping Lone Tree all grins and gigglesor at least with fewer misgivings.But he had come back, stirring up emotions shed long held at bay.Feelings shed thought shed dealt with.Obviously not.Thered been a time when his name and hers were linked.Almost synonymous.Maggie and Brawley.Brawley and Maggie.And that was in the past.She stopped at the mailbox.Nothing important.She walked into the quiet house.No one there.This sucked.She switched on the stereo.When Josh Turner started to sing about dancing up the stairs with his baby, she turned it off and headed for the stairs herself.Only one cure for this.A long, indulgent bath.Maggie swiped a bubble from the end of her nose.A bath and a bottle of wine.Shed been certain the combination would smooth out the rough edges of her emotions.Would dull her hunger for Brawley.Wrong.She wanted him, and if she wasnt careful shed be calling him, begging him to come to her.Damn it!Stretching toward the vanity, she snagged her phone.Annie and Sophie both had lives.Husbands.Too bad!She tipped her wineglass and finished it.Before she could talk herself out of it, she texted them.Busy tonight?Need you.She tossed the phone onto the towel heaped on the floor and refilled her glass.Resting her head against the back of the tub, she reminded herself exactly how lucky she was.She told herself how many people would sell their souls to trade places with her.Brawley had screwed it all up by coming back to town.Damn him all to hell and back!The ringing of the phone startled her, and her wine sloshed over the glass rim.Hello?Well be there in ten minutes, Sophie said.Ten minutes?Maggies head felt fuzzy.Too much wine and not enough food.What?Is Cash flying you here in his plane?How can you get here that fast?Annie and I are already in Lone Tree.We just left Ollies.Ollies?Yep.Hope youre in the mood for pulled pork because we have enough to feed an army.Why?Because were hungry.No.I mean, why are you on your way?We thought wed help you pack.We intended to surprise you.Well, you did that.What do I hear?Water.Youre in the tub?Yep.Drinking wine?Maggie eyed the nearly empty bottle.Yep.All alone in that big old house.Yep.And feeling pretty maudlin.Throw on your pajamas, Maggie, and set the table.She hung up, feeling better already.Her friends had been on their way even before shed called.She grinned.Water spilled onto the floor as she stood.Oh, well, shed wipe it up later.Sophie was true to her word.Within ten minutes, the house no longer felt empty.It rang with the warmth of friendship and smelled of Ollies rich, tangy sauce.Lights blazed in the old farmhouse, and happy music played.Halfway through her meal, Maggie blurted, I cant believe I came so close to sleeping with him again.Sophie set her sandwich on her plate.Annie sloshed her water and turned startled eyes to Maggie, then Sophie.Brawley?Maggie nodded.Annie looked at Sophie.You knew?Sophie nodded.And you didnt tell me?Sophie shrugged.I told you this would happen.Sophie gave her a disgusted look.Nobody likes an I told you so.Annie turned to Maggie.I thought you two were long over.We are.Oh, honey.A tear slid down Maggies face.He left me.He was only nineteen.And I was only eighteen and pregnant.Horrified, Maggie clamped a hand over her mouth.Oh, my gosh.I didnt mean to say that.Nobody but my mom knows.You cant breathe a word to anyone.She registered the look of shock on her friends faces.He left you to have the baby alone?Enraged, Annie said, I hate him.What a piece of scum.
