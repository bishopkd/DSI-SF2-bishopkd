Hey, dont get testy!He laughed and held up his hands.Your accent just sounded like you were from New York.Maybe they sound the same, I dont know.I do not have an accent!And if I do, I sure as hell dont sound like Im from New York.I wanted to be mad, but barely leveled out at annoyed.His dimples were just too damn cute.Youre funny.Jim took a long sip of his drink.So what are you doing in Jamaica?Skiing, I replied flippantly.You?My brothers getting married Wednesday night.Im the best man.So, Jim the best man, where are you from?Originally?Kansas.But I go to school in Miami.Kansas?Like Dorothy and Toto Kansas?More like Clark Kent, but yeah.Im a senior at Miami now.College kid, eh?I teased.Definitely not a kid.And who are you to talk?Im twenty eight.My undergrad was a long time ago.I poured another glass of wine, finishing off the bottle.A wicked grin dashed across his face.An older woman, huh?Looks like I sat at the right table.Looks like you did, kiddo.But I really need to be getting back to my friends.See you around.I gathered my purse and left Jim from Kansas at the table.As I walked back to the room, I stopped at the small bar to thank Wes for the aloe.It was no problem.He flashed a grin at me as he mixed a pink cocktail for a cougar at the end of the bar.I know, but it was really nice of you.Maybe I could repay you.Buy you a drink?At an all inclusive?Right.I glanced down at my feet.Well, then, Ill see you around.Maybe I can listen to your relationship problems or something.Maybe, Caroline from New Jersey.I look forward to it.Wes winked at me and I headed back to the room with thoughts of hot bartenders, sexy dimples, and one night stands swirling around in my head.The next day was spent providing Sarah and Mel with lotion, aspirin, and more water than I thought any person could handle.Thankfully, the burns werent bad enough to blister, and it seemed as though Melody got the brunt of it.We left the room for the cover of tables with umbrellas and then some shopping at the two boutiques at the resort.I didnt venture out much on my own other than to procure a few items from the convenience store.By Wednesday, they were back in action, albeit covered up with newly purchased gauzy bathing suit covers, wide brimmed straw hats, and sunglasses to cover the awful raccoon eyes on their faces.Thankfully, I hadnt spent enough time in the sun to color much more than a soft base tan.What do you want to do tonight?Melody asked from a tree covered hammock.Dinner at the French place?Sarah offered.As long as I dont have to eat snails.Theres much more to French food than snails!I laughed as I sipped on the Dirty Banana Wes had made for me.Do we have to dress up?I think so.No big deal.We leave in two days and you two have spent the last two in bed with sunburn.Were getting dressed up.Bossy!Fine, Ill get dressed up.Can I at least wear my sunglasses?Yes, you can wear your sunglasses.Thank you.Can you get me one of those banana thingies youre drinking?Yup.Be right back.Keeping to the cobblestone path, I walked up to Wess bar and asked for three Dirty Bananas.Caroline from New Jersey!Jim waved me over from a table.He was sitting with three other guys.I grabbed the drinks, carefully balancing three between my hands, and walked over.Jim from Kansas.Fancy meeting you here.I didnt see you around yesterday.I was with my friends.I pointed with both hands to the area where the girls sat and nodded.They got really bad sunburn on Monday.That sucks.Whatre you doing later?Probably just relaxing.Dont you have that wedding tonight?Yeah.This is my brother Tom and his two friends Alex and Joe.Hi.If you and your friends arent busy, maybe we could all meet up after.Yeah, maybe.Well, good luck tonight.Congratulations.Nice to meet all of you.I started walking away when Jim jumped up.Let me get that for you.He took two of the drinks from my hands and walked over to the girls with me, handing each of them their drink.Well, Caroline, Ill see you around.Thank you.See you.Melody pulled her sunglasses down to the tip of her nose as she watched shirtless Jim walk away.Whoshe paused dramaticallywas that?Thats Jim from Kansas.He goes to the University of Miami and his brother is getting married tonight.Hes a baby!Sarah laughed.Hes hot!Melody declared.Hes a child!I countered.Who cares?Hes hot, seems to be available, and is totally into you.Whatever.The last thing on my mind was getting to know someone.I was not in the frame of mind to get to know anyone.I know exactly what youre thinking, Care.You dont want to get wrapped up in any nonsense.You feel like you have some sort of moral code that youd like to keep intact, even if you busted through it the other night.Sarah pushed a lock of hair out of my face.What you dont understand is that you dont have to deal with nonsense.You dont have to worry about breaking any rules.Do you know why?Because Im on vacation.Injecting boredom into my voice did nothing to quell her spirit.And what happens in Jamaica stays in Jamaica!Melody cheered.I thought it was what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas?I have it on good authority that the message is transferrable.Wherever you are, it applies.I looked over at Jim, laughing with his brother and friends.He caught me looking and waved.Isnt that a bit much?I mean sex with two guys in less than a week?Time stops when youre on vacation.Everything gets pulled into the black hole.And besides, there arent as many sluts as youd like to think.Most are just women with very welcoming vaginas, Melody said, obviously pleased with herself.Look, Melody and I cant score now.We look like lobster raccoons.We need you to take one for the team and bang the baby over there.Do it for all womankind, Care.Do it for us.He invited us to hang out after the wedding tonight.Us?Melody perked up.I thought you were a lobster raccoon?I laughed.Maybe one of his friends is into that kind of thing.Were they really trying to talk me into having sex with Jim just so they could live vicariously through me?Id lived vicariously through them enough for twelve lifetimes.Id listened to their stories, pined over the sexual freedom afforded to them by their mind set.I never thought I could be that girl.I never thought I could have random sex.But I can and I did.And it was kind of awesome.But didnt I already do just that?And was it really a one night stand if he and I were seeing each other again next week?Could Jim be the real and true one nighter Id been hoping for?No strings?No awkward running into each other at the gym?No ridiculously hot roommate to lust after?Ill do it.Youll what?I said Ill do it.I need to prep a bit though.We need lunch and I need drinks.Id avoided Jim the rest of the day, hoping for a bit of spontaneity.At sundown, the girls and I headed out for our fancy French dinner.We were dressed to kill.We watched the wedding from the terrace.It was beautiful.I saw Jim in the requisite island wedding attirekhaki shorts and a white button downstanding beside his brother.I watched as the bride and groom kissed and my belly dropped.I used to want marriage with Steven.I used to want children, a house in the suburbs, and a minivan.At that moment, on Thanksgiving eve, watching two people get married on the shores of Jamaica at sunset, I had no idea what I wanted anymore.Melody and Sarah kept sneaking not so subtle glances in my direction, probably wondering if I would go through with it.When I saw the bridal party begin walking off the beach, I summoned the lady balls Id grown last Saturday and chugged back a half glass of wine.I waited until I saw Jim semialone, eyeballed the girls, and made my way over to him.I not so accidentally brushed up against him.Oh, excuse me.Caroline!Jim?I pretended I didnt know what Id done.You lookwow.You look great.He took my hand before kissing me on the cheek.From the smell of it, he was half in the bag with me.So do you.So, your brother got married, huh?I looked around at the intimate gathering of what I assumed to be family and a few very close friends.Yeah.I dont want to intrude.Ill let you get back to them.I turned to walk away and he grabbed my wrist.I played coy, but inside my stomach was doing somersaults.You arent intruding.As a matter of fact, my brother and his wife are probably going back to their room.And everyone here is just going to continue drinking.Oh, wellAre your friends here?I can introduce them to my friends.I looked around and noticed the two girls were already laughing with the pair of young men Id met earlier.Looks like theyve introduced themselves.I made sure to make steady eye contact and slow blinked the way Melody taught me.It felt dumb and uncomfortable but it seemed to work.Looks like it, huh?Wanna go somewhere?Were on an island, there arent many places to go.We could just, I dont know, go for a walk and see where that takes us.Id like that.Let me just let my friends know.Ill grab you a drink.What would you like?Wine is good.White, please.I hurried over to Sarah and Melody, who were half watching with obvious interest.Were going for a walk.Dont wait up.Is there anything in my teeth?Sarah inspected.Nope.Youre good.I handed her my shoes and kissed each one on the head before hurrying back over to Jim.Thanks, I said as he handed me a plastic cup, full to the top, of wine.I looked at him and cocked my head.I figured plastic was better than walking around with glass.I can change it for you.I took a sip.Nope, this is fine.We stood in front of each other for minutes in silence.The longer the silence stretched, the more I drank.Just as the situation was about to get awkward, he downed his cup of liquid courage, grabbed a towel from a beach bag, and took my hand, sliding his fingers between mine and tilting his head toward the beach.Finding a semisecluded spot on the beach under a tree, we laid out the towel and flopped down.I stretched out my legs, flexing my feet.Jim scooched forward, took my right foot in his hand, and began massaging it.He dragged his fingers between my toes, pushed his thumbs into the arch of my foot, and kneaded the pad of my heel with his knuckles.I leaned back against the tree and closed my eyes.It was heaven.Until my eyes shot open when he put my toes in his mouth.I didnt know whether to cringe or moan in excitement.I couldnt pull it away.There was nothing I could do but shift uncomfortably, lean back, and close my eyes again.I felt his tongue slowly leave my toes and move along the top of my foot.Much better.That was something I could get used to.His mouth played along my shin as his hands massaged my calf.Definitely something I could get used to.His mouth reached my knee and the butterflies returned to my stomach.With every lick, the tingling between my legs grew.As his hands gently pushed up my dress and found their way to my inner thighs, I exhaled the breath Id been holding.I could feel the scruff on his chin delicately rub against me.Tangling my hands in his hair, I pushed his head farther into me.His breath was cool against my rising heat.His tongue was soft against my firm clit.He licked and sucked until I all but passed out.Quickly, he grabbed me by the hips and pulled me down underneath him.His mouth crashed on mine and the tongue that had explored my leg now explored my mouth.With one hand behind my head, he used the other to unbutton his pants.I reached down and pulled my dress up to my waist then gripped him, guided him where I wanted him to go.Shifting my panties over, he pushed deep into me and I cried out.He was insatiable.The rhythm was quick, our mouths moved, frenzied with want.He bit my lip and pulled as I sank my nails into his firm ass, pulling him farther into me.He pulled the straps of my dress down so my breasts were exposed.Hungrily he took a nipple in his mouth and sucked hard until I thought I would scream in pleasurable pain.I felt the familiar vibration rise inside me and I came harder than I ever had before.Gripping my hair, he thrust more forcefully until he emptied himself.Breathing heavily, we lay still for a long while.He nuzzled my neck and nibbled on my earlobe.I was still quivering from the aftershocks when he suggested we go to his room.The next morning, I tiptoed back into my room, hoping to make a quiet entrance.No such luck.Well, look whos rolling in.Did the walk of shame, did we?Sarah wiggled her eyebrows.Looks like shes the only one of us who got lucky last night.Shut it.Im starving.Lets get some breakfast.At the small caf, I saw Jim and his family having breakfast.We locked eyes over coffee, fruit, and a dozen people Id never met.He took a sip of his coffee, tilted his head toward the beach like he did the night before, excused himself from the table, and walked away.Ill be right back.Or not.Where are you going?Youre not going to finish eating?Sarah asked.Melody looked toward Jim and smiled.Just dont forget we leave tomorrow.NineOn Monday, I woke up before my alarm.I rolled out of bed, looked out my window, noticing a thin dusting of snow covering the sidewalk, and sighed.The sun of Jamaica suddenly seemed so long ago.Thankfully the throbbing between my legs had all but disappeared.First day jitters were on high alert.I fell asleep the night before alternating my thoughts between Jim, Ryan, Brian, and my new job.Maybe Sarah was right; there was more to life than singular focus.In time, I thought to myself.Id spent the better part of the past five years lost in what I thought was a perfect relationship.It wasnt until I took a step back, wallowed in vats of hot fudge sundaes, and shed tears over every chick flick and romantic comedy that my vision had cleared.Steven and I werent perfect.Far from it.But we projected perfection and that, in the end, is what kept us together.Our relationship made his family happy.Honestly?I think the breakup was a rebellion on both our parts.I was tired of dinner parties and galas and client meetings.Steven was tired of holding his daddys expectations on his shoulders.Of course, that still doesnt excuse him from shoving his dick in the nearest undergrad he could find and screwing her in the bed where I slept.I shuffled, still tired from tossing and turning all night, into the bathroom.The water, a few degrees below scalding, cleansed extraneous gunk from my thoughts.Jim.Ryan.Brian.Sex.Steven.Sore vaginas.Everything slowly slipped down the drain, at least for the time being.Train schedules and anxietybut good anxietytook over.Where would this job take me?Who would I meet?Will I love it?I shook my head.None of it mattered.Today, I thought, I am starting over.Care!Sarahs banging on the bathroom door slammed me back to reality.Dont use up all the hot water!Sorry!I called back before quickly rinsing out my conditioner and forgoing the armpit shave.It was winter, it wasnt like I was going sleeveless.I stepped out, wrapped a towel around myself, and opened the door.You know, ten minutes means youre clean, any more than that and youre jerking off, Sarah said as we did the enter exit dance.Girls dont jerk off!I yelled back as I walked to my room.Okay, technically they jill off.Your battery operated boyfriend proves that.Sarah giggled before closing the door.I stood staring at the clothes hanging in my closet.Pretty much everything I owned was business attire.I wasnt sure if the new job was as strict in their company dress code.I wasnt a lawyer at the law firm but I certainly dressed like one.An assistant editor job spoke, to me, of something more laid back, casual but not sloppy.Stylish, not stuffy.I threw shirts and dresses and pants and suits all over my room until I settled on a pair of very cool gray skinny jeans, a blousy white top, and a black blazer.I popped my thick black frames on my face after Id applied enough makeup to sufficiently erase the lack of sleep the weekend provided.In the kitchen, I found Sarah sitting at the table with dry toast and a huge cup of black coffee.I grabbed my mug from the dish drainer and filled up.After copious amounts of sugar and cream, I sat across from her, reaching for a piece of toast from her plate.Morning.Youre up early.Morning.I have to meet with the science department before school starts.I think theyre changing the curriculum.Again.She shrugged.The trials and tribulations of a high school science teacher.I loved the fact that we were so different.In college, my nose was stuck in the classics like Voltaire, Dickinson, and Shakespeare, while Sarah was memorizing the periodic table and dissecting pigs.She lifted her eyes from the notes she was looking over.The hot high school science teacher.You look cute.Thanks.I didnt want to look too stuffy.You think this is okay?I dont see why not.What are you going to be doing all day?Reading manuscripts and fixing them up to become best sellers?I figured all youd need is some comfy jammies and my grampas recliner.I am pretty sure there is more to it than that.Eventually.Right now, I think Im basically a secretary to the editor.Sarah looked down at my bare feet.What shoes are you wearing?I dont know.What do you think?Heels?Boots?Well, not that youre an internI cringed at the wordbut youll be working with some kids right out of college, right?Not sure.Well, sweetie, I think assistant is just a formality.You have loads of experience working PR at the law firm, writing briefs, all kinds of things.I think you need to walk in there with shoes that say Thats right, bitches.I will own this joint.I say heels.Ooh, maybe that cute patent leather pair you bought right before we left for Jamaica.I stared at her a beat.Im going to have to concur.I downed the last of my coffee and jumped up from the table.I heard Sarah mutter as I walked away, Thats right, bitches.TenThe train ride into the city was not uncomfortable, unless of course you count the stale smell of sweat, resignation, and exhaustion.Normally, Id people watch, but I was too preoccupied with new beginnings.I dug my e reader out of my bag, hoping to refresh myself with the manuscript Id been assigned.There was nothing I loved more than reading and I wasnt a genre snob.Give me a shampoo bottle and Id read it.Magazine?Cover to cover.Brand spankin new manuscript that the rest of the world had never seen?All day long.Lost in the authors impeccable world building, I barely registered the text message that chimed on my phone.Melody.Kick some publishing ass!Youll do great!I smiled.I honestly had the best friends in the world.My circle was small but I couldnt imagine my life without either Melody or Sarah.It was like the universe knew no one else could tolerate us.Before I could reply, a new message chimed through.Good luck on your first day.I smiled a bit but I had no idea who the message was from.Thank you.Who is this?I stared at my phone.It was two more stops before I received an answer.Someone who loves checking out your ass.Brian.I had no idea how he got my number.I could only assume Ryan gave it to him.I couldnt help but wonder why Ryan would give my number to his roommate.I didnt have much time to ruminate; my stop was next.I packed up my things, pulled on my gloves, and checked out my face in my mirror.I was pale but it was nothing a little lipstick and a text from Brian couldnt brighten up.I shuffled off the train, herded like cattle through tight corridors and powerless escalators.It felt like hours before I finally emerged from the massive building into the sun.I lined up with the rest of the worker bees for a taxi.I was really going to have to figure out the subway system but, at that moment, I didnt want to go back underground.It wasnt that far of a walk, but I hadnt thought much about sensible footwear when I got ready earlier.Plus, trudging through the slushy sidewalks was not my idea of a good time.I was grateful to hop somewhat quickly into a cab.It wasnt long before I was dropped off in front of the building.Taking it in, I nearly pinched myself.Finally, a dream job I wouldnt have to sell my soul for.Double checking my bag and fully confident Id make my mark with this job, I walked in through the heavy glass doors.Hi.Good morning.My name is Caroline Frost.Todays my first day.I am supposed to meet with Oscar Little.The receptionist picked up the phone and announced my arrival.Mr.Little is expecting you.Take the elevator to the twelfth floor.Hell meet you there.Thanks.Good luck.I smiled, thankful she wasnt a twenty year old intern.Id had enough of those in my life.The twelfth floor pinged my arrival as the doors slid open and the most beautiful man Id ever seen stood in front of the open doors talking with Mr.Little.Mr.Little reminded me of my grandfathertall, gray, and dressed in a well tailored suit.The other man wore Vans, a pair of distressed jeans that probably cost more than my entire outfit, an untucked white button down, and a peacoat.I couldnt tell his age, other than he was maybe my age or possibly a little older.With a mess of blond wavy hair, he looked as though he belonged on a beach somewhere instead of standing in an office building in the middle of the city.He reminded me, a bit, of Jim from Kansas.My lady parts woke up at the thought.I hesitated a moment before stepping into the reception area of the floor.Standing there, a little self conscious, I wondered how I should make my presence known, since both men seemed to be deep in conversation.So I did what anyone would do, I stepped closer and cringed as my phone went off.I shoved my hand in my bag to silence it but not before both men turned toward me.Mortified, I kept my face down until Mr.Little said my name.Caroline Frost?Straightening myself out, I tried to recover but only squeaked out a tiny yes.Certain my face was a million shades of red, I stuck out my hand.Hi, Mr.Little.Hello, dear.Glad to see you again.So happy youre joining us.Thishe gestured to the Adonis to my rightis Michael Mortimer.I shook his hand, lost for a moment in his piercing chocolate brown eyes, while wondering why his name sounded so familiar.Nice to meet you, Mr.Mortimer.His laugh was genuine.Please, call me Michael.So, howd you like my book?That was it!He wrote the manuscript Id been reading.I thought it was great, actually.I didnt know Id be meeting you today.I snuck a side glance at Mr.Little.Well, Mr.Little here knows I am completely hands on when it comes to my work.I couldnt let the opportunity to meet the person editing it pass me by since I was in town.I do have to say, I didnt think youd be so young.What was he talking about?He looked about the same age as me!Well, I guess that makes two of us, Mister, uh, Michael.I will do my best to take care of your book.Ive been in contact with Ms.Page, learning the ropes.Well, I am looking forward to working with you.Caroline, said Mr.Little, well have Holly show you around.Shell get you squared away with human resources.Why dont we meet back up at lunchtime, my office, and well go over your first project?Yolanda has been on a much needed vacation.But I am glad to hear youve been in touch since the interview.Sounds excellent.Im looking forward to it.Holly was a well put together woman who was, if I had to guess, in her early sixties.With auburn hair, flawless skin, and sharp brown eyes, she motioned for me to walk with her.Until we meet again, Ms.Frost.Id love to read your notes on my book.Michael nodded toward me and winked.I had the distinct impression that he was checking me out.So I added a little swing to my step.Ill have those to you soon.Leaving the two men, I felt both overwhelmed and at home.It was the first time since college that I felt as though I had some say over my direction.Holly walked next to me as we made our way down the hall.She opened a door at the end and motioned for me to enter.A large desk topped with a fabulous flat computer screen was the only item, besides a couple of chairs, in the room.Mostly empty bookshelves lined one of the walls.ThisHolly waved her armis your office.Office?I think there is some mistake.I stepped through the room to the window.Below, cars and taxis played chicken with pedestrians.Mr.Mortimer is an important client.He expects the best from the people that work with him.And since you were handpickedHandpicked?I just got the job!I only know what Im told, dear.You can place your things in here.Later you and I can go over what else youll need to make the space workable for you.For now, there are a few trade books on the shelves, copies of Mr.Mortimers first two novels and a few other things that were left here by the last assistant editor.But I dont understand.Hollys eyes warmed.Ive learned over the years, sweetie, that when something wonderful and unexpected happens, you should never question it.Now, you can leave your things here.Ill take you to human resources.The rest of the morning passed like a whirlwind.Books and files were brought into my office, I met and shook hands with everyone Id be working with.It was the most amazing place Id ever worked.And I hadnt even clocked in a full day!I had about a half hour before I had to meet Mr.Little in his office.I picked up the phone and dialed Melodys office.Melody Ashford.Mel, I swear to God I work in Bizarro World.Everyone here is so freaking happy, so nice.Well, thats unfortunate.I know, right?I honestly am not sure if any of these people speak sarcasm or snark.Imagine working in a place where people are nice.I feel bad for you.See!That comment right there!I know youre being sarcastic but the people here, I honestly think theyre too nice to see that.I could tell Melody thought I was off my rocker.I wasnt complaining, not in the least.I think I was more surprised than anything else.Oh!And I met Michael Mortimer today.And Michael Mortimer isThe guy who wrote the manuscript Ive been reading.And Mel, hes hot.Then put a bulls eye on his ass and make him a target!I cant do that.I work with him, or will be working with him.And besides, its not the point.I have an office, too!No cubicle?Nope.Are they hiring?I can check.Kidding.Look I have to run to a meeting with my boss to discuss the financials of the merger.Have fun and fill me in later.Drinks at Murphys?Murphys?Sure, yeah.I guess.See you then.We can discuss my date with Ryan on Friday.I almost forgot about that.Yes.We will discuss.Talk later, doll face.Later.I could feel my cheeks flush and butterflies rouse to life in my stomach.I wasnt sure I was ready to go back to Murphys.I would undoubtedly see Brian.Then again, what did it really matter?Making my way to Mr.Littles office, I took my time and absorbed everything around me.People were laughing, smiling, and having fun.A complete one eighty from my previous job.Working at the law firm, looking back, was like dealing with a different crisis every other minute.Always so serious, always so cold.Everyone there was looking for someone else to stand on while they climbed their way to the top.That was never my style and I should have seen it.Unfortunately I was so blinded by my relationship with Steven that I failed to see the job was slowly sucking the life out of me.I have no idea how anyone could live and thrive in that environment.Holly waved me into Mr.Littles office.He was on the phone but motioned for me to take a seat across from him.As soon as he clicked off, all his attention was on me.So, Caroline, its been only a few hours but hows your first day been so far?Its been great.Better than great, actually.Everyone is so nice and helpful.And I had no idea Id have my own office.Well, its a small office.We try to make everyone feel at home.We like to treat everyone so they feel like part of a family.The office is just a way of our saying thank you.You came highly recommended and anything I can do to make your transition easier, let me know.And of course youll be assisting Mortimers editor.As a matter of fact, shell be joining us for lunch.I cant wait to go over my notes with her.Why dont you go get your coat and well meet at the elevator?Mr.Mortimer will be joining us as well.We arent eating here?No.Since its your first day, I figured somewhere special was called for.Waiting at the elevator, I heard someone call my name.Yes?A slight woman who looked as though she was barely old enough to drive ran up to me.Hi, these arrived for you a few minutes ago.In the womans hands was a huge vase filled with a bouquet of wildflowers, my favorite.The first name that popped into my head was Brian.I shook off the stupid thought.Theyre beautiful, the woman commented.Well, thank you, umErica.Thank you, Erica.Ill just put these in my office.I can do that for you.Theres a card.Excitement radiated in her voice.It was obvious she was interested to know who sent them and probably wouldnt let me leave unless I opened the card in front of her.I pulled it out and read it.Beautiful flowers for a beautiful girl.Good luck on your first day.Call me.~Steven Anger and annoyance vibrated through me.So, whore they from?Your boyfriend?I wish my boyfriend would send me flowers.What?Oh, no one.Thanks.You can keep them if you want.I crumbled the card in my fist.Oh, I just couldnt.Someone put a lot of thought into these.No, really.Keep them.Im allergic.I felt bad lying to her, she seemed so nice.But the last thing I wanted was for my past to collide with my present and future.Caroline, are you ready?Mr.Little walked toward me.I stifled a giggle when I saw him pull on a wool Jets hat.Definitely not the look I was expecting from him.Absolutely.Lets go.Erica, the flowers are beautiful!Oh, Mr.Little, they arent Erica responded, looking at me.Arent they?Gorgeous.I winked at her as Mr.Little and I entered the elevator.The last thing I saw was her face break into a huge smile as the doors closed.ElevenOn our way to the small restaurant, Mr.Little walked as if he wasnt in a hurry, a departure from the hustle and bustle surrounding us.He made a point to comment on window decor, street vendors, and random people who caught his eye.He was certainly an interesting man.He spoke about the company, the clients, and, more fondly, about the people who worked for him.He liked to know what was going on in his company but liked to keep distance enough that people didnt feel as though they were being watched.A strategy that was foreign to me, coming from a work environment where movement, in and out the door, was constant and almost expected from those who worked there.We turned the corner and, as we were passing a bus stop, I halted in my tracks.My gloved hand flew to my mouth and I gasped loud enough to cause passersby to turn their heads as they moved on.On a poster, in the middle of the city, on the side of a bus stop shelter, in his underwear, advertising some mens brand of clothing I hadnt heard of, was Ryan.I was so thrown off I stumbled and dropped my phone, cracking the glass face.Id seen this man naked.Id done unspeakable, albeit memorable both mentally and physically, things with this man.And there he was.Full size on a poster, in the middle of the city, on the side of a bus stop shelter, in his underwear.The facts repeated over and over in my head like a scratched vinyl record.A pair of underwear that he obviously filled out in ways many others could not stretched across his groin.I caught myself staring, open mouthed, head tilted, with my eyes zeroing in on every muscle that, only a week ago, had stretched across my body.At hands that had touched me in ways Id never been touched.At the mouth thatI shook my head to dispel the direction my brain was taking.Caroline?Caroline?Are you okay?A muffled voice was calling my name.It was a moment before I rejoined the present.Mr.Little had a look of concern on his face.With the Jets hat inching up his head and his face reddened from the cold air, it should have been comical.But it wasnt.Caroline?Are you all right?Do you need to sit down?You look very pale.No, no.Thank you.Im okay.I just thought, I wasnt, um, sure if I turned off the coffeemaker this morning.Then I remembered it has an auto off function.I hoped my stuttering lie didnt alarm Mr.Little.Sneaking a sideways glance as I bent down and fumbled my phone back into my hands, I saw his face morph back to calm.I wanted, more than anything, to run home and dive under the covers and refuse to emerge until Ryan was a distant memory.But I couldnt.The butterflies in my stomach, the throbbing memory in my panties, and the perspiration sliding between my breasts told me there was no way Ryan would be forgotten so easily.The fact that I was standing in the middle of the sidewalk with my new boss staring at me kept me from bolting.Why couldnt I have picked up a nice, normal man?Why couldnt I have homed in on a target that was obscure, unknown, and didnt look so damned good inand outof his underwear?I decided to throw caution to the wind and planned out my first one night stand.My first true act of irresponsibility and I bring home a fucking underwear model.Go big or go home.Thankfully, Mr.Little was quietly whistling to himself the rest of the short walk to the restaurant.As he held the door for me, I thought I would normally be thankful for the warmth of the indoors but, truthfully, I was warm enough from my photographic run in with my very own, honest to goodness sex god.Michael Mortimer was sitting at a window table chatting on the phone.To his left was a thin black woman with her hair pulled severely back into the tightest bun Id ever seen.It gave me a headache just looking at it.Her attire commanded respect.Wearing a deep navy pants suit with matching heels and a pair of wire rimmed glasses perched on her nose, the woman studied the menu with intensity.Despite the severe outer shell, she emanated warmth and approachability.From just the one time wed met, she made me feel welcome and comfortable.It was because of her that I knew this was the job for me.Yolanda!Mr.Little called to the woman as the matre d took his coat.The woman stood and stepped toward him.Oscar, how lovely to see you.She kissed the air on either side of his cheeks.You rememberMr.Little motioned for me to step forwardCaroline Frost.Shell be your new editorial assistant.I held out my hand.Nice to see you again.I hope your vacation was restful.She smiled.It wasnt quite as restful as it should have been, but then again, when is it ever?Have you read the manuscript?Yes.I brought the notes with me if youd like to go over them.Dont be silly.Weshe motioned toward the tableare at lunch.We will go over them when we return to the office.She turned from me and resumed her position at the table studying the menu.The waiter held my chair out for me and I ended up sitting between Michael and Mr.Little, with Yolanda directly across from me.She snuck a glance at me over the menu.I smiled but her brow furrowed and she went back to the menu.Michael put down his phone and looked at Mr.Little.Sorry, Oscar.That was my agent.Something about foreign rights and some production company snooping around.Caroline, nice to see you could join us.Have any notes for me?Oh, lets not make this a working lunch.Yolanda didnt make eye contact.Youd think with the way she was scrutinizing the menu shed have the thing memorized already.Oh, Yolanda.Youre no fun.Id like to hear what Caroline thinks.I really liked it.I began, careful not to give too much information.Id rather not piss off the woman Id be spending the next however many months with editing a manuscript.You liked it?How pedestrian, darling.Are you sure you read it thoroughly?I did a double take.Where did the nice Yolanda go?Not everyone can be as hard nosed as you, my dear Ms.Page.If I didnt know any better, and I probably didnt, Id have thought Michael was flirting with her.I had the feeling he flirted with everyone.If she is going to work with me, Michael, shed better learn to be.Nothing like having someone talk about you as if you werent in the room.Mr.Little was looking at me with an expectant look on his face.What did I have to lose?Actually, Ms.PageFor goodness sake, call me Yolanda.She waved me off with her hand, bracelets clinking as she did.At least the smile reached her eyes.Okay.I did notice a small plot hole in the story.The protagonists wife could not have been a witness to the crime.She was out of the country.In addition, there are a few other issues Ive taken note of and you and I can discuss those after lunch.Back at the office.I added the last part to let her know she and I were on the same page.I would be working closely with the woman and I certainly didnt want to start things off on the wrong footing.I held my breath.Mr.Little was beaming at me and Michael was watching me with his chin resting on his hand.His long fingers stretched up the side of his cheek and for a moment I could focus on nothing but those fingers.They reminded me of Ryans.Well, Caroline.Yolanda placed her napkin in her lap.I look forward to speaking with you, at length, about the manuscript.For now, however, I think we need to order.I slowly blew out the breath I was holding.Yes.I am starving.Whatll it be?Michael picked up his menu for the first time since I arrived.I followed suit as the waiter arrived at our table.Yolanda ordered first.Ill have a cup of the vegetable soup with the grilled Brie and pear panini.Half sandwich, please.Make that two.I figured if she thought we had similar interests, even if it was just a lunch order, she might warm up to me.Mr.Little ordered the lobster bisque and steak sandwich.I was surprised to find Michael order nothing but a plate of French fries.French fries?What can I say?I love them.And they arent your regular plate of potatoes.These are smothered in cheddar, horseradish, and roast beef au jus.Of course, I have to run five miles a day in order to keep eating them.I took a sip of my water and Michael winked at me.I swallowed wrong and felt like I was coughing up a lung.I excused myself and choked the whole way to the bathroom.Slamming the stall door shut, I finally gained control of myself, pulled out my phone, and texted Sarah.Change of plans.Forget Murphys.Meet me in front of my office building.Tell Mel.She replied: K.  Fixing my lipstick in the mirror, I thought about all the changes in my life over the past few months.
