Im supposed to say something when West opens the truck door and looks at me with nothing in his expression like surprise.Looks at me with a blazing sort of pride, an arrogant tilt to his eyebrows that tells me he knew.He knew exactly what he was doing.I dont say anything.Not even when he calls me by name.Caroline, he saysmy whole name, which he hardly ever uses.I refuse to speak even when he takes me by the shoulder and shakes me, Fucking say something, and Mrs.Tomlinsons making soothing noises, West, West.Im sinking, and I dont have to talk to him.I dont have to do anything.He drives me to the airport in the morning.Up the mountain.Down the mountain.Wordless.Its not until I see a sign that says were twenty miles from Eugene that I start thinking how this is it.I mean, this is really it.When West left Putnam last year, I took him to the airport, and I didnt know if Id ever see him again.It was horrible, but not as horrible as this silent car ride, because what I didnt understand last year is that everything about that departure was outlined in hope.I didnt know if Id see West again, but I hoped I would.He didnt know if hed ever get back to Putnam, but I know he hoped, too.We hoped we could be friends.We hoped we could be more.And the slow death of hopethe suffocation of a futurethats hard to live through.Its no wonder he couldnt take it.Its no wonder he told me hed met someone, just to give himself a reason to stop calling.To give me a reason to stop waiting for the phone to ring.All of that was hard.Its not as hard as this.This is the wasteland after a volcanic eruptioneverything hot and black, covered in sulfur, the sky the color of ash.Theres nothing for hope to feed on in this car.He took it all.He killed it on purpose.I know what you did, I say into the silence.His hands tighten on the wheel.Say what you need to say, Caro.Youre hoping Ill yell.I bet it would be easier if you could remember me that way.You could think about how it ended, and then you wouldnt have to remember the rest of it.Hes quiet.Im not.Ive never been a quiet person, and everything thats happened to me in the last year has driven whatever quietness remained right out of me.I wish I had a microphone for this.A sound system and a crowd of a thousand.I wish everyone in the world could hear.I love you.Thats the first thing I have to say to West Leavitt, and I hear his surprise in the sharp sound of his inhale.I came here because I love you, and I helped you the best I could because I love you.I need you to know that there isnt anything I wouldnt have done to make this work between us.I didnt know it when I got here, but I sure as fuck know it now.If youd asked me to take time off school, move out here, help you get your sister on the right path, I wouldve done it.For you.If youd said to me you wanted to raise her, you and me together, take her from your mom and set up a house somewhere, Id have said sure, yeah, lets do it, even though its scary.For you Id do it.All Ive ever said to you is yes, and I was going to keep saying yes, because you were worth it.The way you made me feel.Your mind and your heart and you.Everything about being with you was worth it.His eyes are on the road, so I look at it, too, but theres nothing there.Look at me, I say.He wont.You look at me, I repeat.I deserve that much from you.The truck slows.He signals, then pulls onto the side.Cuts the engine.He turns toward me, and its harder.But its already so hard, theres no point in flinching away from it now.You have to leave Silt, I tell him.Take your sister, because God knows you wont leave her, but you cannot stay.Youll never be happy here.You dont know how.His eyes cut away from me.Out the window, toward the mountains.You told me once when I needed to hear it that I hadnt done anything wrong, so now Im going to tell you.You did do something wrong.That performance last night?It was a performance.Im not going to pretend it was anything you wanted, that you got carried away with lust or some bullshit, because that was fucking calculated.It was mean, and it was wrong.But I know what you did, West.I know why you did it.And the same way I needed to hear that I hadnt done anything wrong with Nate, that I wasnt wrong even when a hundred strange assholes on the Internet were talking in my head at me day in and day out His eyes cut to me.I never told you that?I ask.Yeah.Voices in my head, insomnia, misery.The whole thing.And you were the one who pulled me out of that.You were.You did it yourself.Everyone does everything themselves, West.By themselves, to themselves.Everyone.But sometimes they do it because they have a reason, and you were my reason.You told me I was fine, I wasnt broken, I wasnt wrong, and I believed you.You made a difference.I knot my hands in my lap.Not sure now that I should be saying any of this.Never sure, actually, that I could make any kind of difference for him the way he did for me.Im not the person you need to hear it from, I guess.Theres a plane low in the sky.Landing at the airport.I look at his face again.But I might be the only person whos going to tell you.Your dad sucked.Your familywell, nobody wants to hear anything bad about their family, but West, theyre never going to stop taking things from you.Not ever.Theres never going to be a day when you look around at your mom and your sister and your grandma and say, Okay, theyre fine.I can go live my life the way I want now.Its not going to happen, any more than Im ever going to get my sex pictures off the Internet.You cant wait for it to happen.What you have to do is find a way to get out from under it, knowing its never going away.You have to make your own life, because if you dont, you just wont get to have one at all, and thats the worst fucking thing I can imagine.He makes a sound in his throat.I dont know what it means.I dont know how he feels, but this is the only chance Ill get.Im going to lay it all down in front of him, because he taught me how to cut through the bullshit, and its one of the most important lessons Ive ever learned.You know, thats the thing that made me cry the hardest last night, even after what you did to me?Even with how mad I am, how fucking gross I feel every time I even look at your mouth or think about hearing what I heardthinking about how you made me hear itits even worse to think Im going to leave and youre going to drive back to Silt and die there.Die there every day.I swipe at my face.Mascara all over my hand.What a disaster.Its sick, you know that?I say.This heart of mine, limping along?I dont get it, he says.I dont get why youre being Because I love you.I dont want to, okay?I think there are some things that are so hard, you shouldnt have to do them, only no one can take them from you.There are feelings so sick, so obviously unhealthy, you shouldnt have to feel them.But there they are.I still love you, and Im not ever going to see you again, not ever.You did that to us.Not your dad or your family, just you.So I could hit you.I could rage at you right now, and call you every ugly name I know, and I know a lot.I could tell you how much Im hurting, or I could get out of the car, slam the door, hitchhike to the airport because fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, West, how could you do this to me?How?He wipes his palms up the back of his head.Drops his forehead onto the steering wheel and covers his face with his forearms.What I cant do is pretend I dont know what you did, I say.Or pretend I dont still care about you.I look one more time at him.All of him.His lowered head and his shoulders, his torso wrapped in a blue T shirt, those long legs sticking out of his shorts.Were so far from where we were when we met.Lost in the wilderness, and there isnt any way back.Dont waste your whole life, I tell him.Youre not going to get another one.Collapsed over the wheel, he turns the ignition.I can hear him breathing.Thick, deep breaths.Its five full minutes before hes got it under control.Im calm now.Emptied out.When he lifts his head, he flips open the glove compartment, careful not to touch my knee, and extracts his cigarettes.The lighter is out of reach.I pluck it out and give it to him.I find his bracelet in my purse and leave it in the glove box while he watches.It looks like a childs token.Give up the fucking cancer sticks, too, I say.When he exhales smoke out the window, I watch it disappear into the sky.I remind myself that this place were in nowevery green thing I seeall of this came after the fire and ash.Theres hope in the world.I just have to find it.West Fade to black.That was my plan.Some fucking plan.Caroline left the morning after my dads funeral.I spent the next four weeks in Silt, and the screen of my personal Wild West movie was supposed to darken from the edges to the middle until there was nothing left but a quarter size hole, a nickel, a dime, nothing.Shows over.Welcome to the rest of your life.Enjoy your time in this paradise of emotional numbness.Drink some beers.Fuck some chicks.Rock on.I was delusional.I can only guess, now, that my delusions were supposed to protect me, because its not like any part of my life had given me reason to believe awful shit gets less awful through repetition.Worrying youre not going to be able to buy groceriesworrying your baby sisters going to cough her lungs out from the croupworrying youre going to die alone and never again make love to the only woman you wantit always fucking sucks.It sucks and sucks and sucks and sucks, and it never stops sucking.Theres no end to it.No bottom.No black curtain that falls down and makes it so you dont have to feel it.Its like Caroline said.There are some things so terrible you shouldnt have to go through them, but you do have to.Theyre yours to feel, yours to put up with.Your life to live, whether you like it or not.I drove back to Silt and went to work.I fed juniper into a chipper and thought about the future for the first time in months.I thought about Caroline.What shed said.What Id done to her.I thought about how hard Id tried to keep her from seeing me here, seeing me struggle to keep it together.I knew she would, if she came to Silt.I figured I couldnt stand it if she did, and I was right.I couldnt stand it.Couldnt stand what she told me.Couldnt stand that she saw right through what I did to herthe shame I felt when she didnt cry or shout and I figured out Id been trying to trick her into changing her mind about me because I couldnt just tell her the truth.I loved her.Every day, every hour, every single fucking awful minute, I loved her.And even loving her, I hurt her, because I thought I had to.What else would have made her leave?A smart woman like Caroline, loyal, caringshe wouldve done anything for me, including stay.I guessed it, and then she told me, so, you know, gold star for me.Three cheers for West, figuring out what he has to do to drive the love of his life away.Eat Rita Tomlinson out against the side of Bos truckthats gonna get the job done.Thatll get it done every damn time.I disgusted myself.I hated myself.But Jesus, I loved Caroline.She was always braver than me.Better than me, smarter, able to see her way to the heart of things.She looked at me and saw a man worth rescuing, but Id already made up my mind not to be rescued.I put her as far away from me as possible, because I was going to have to stay in Silt, and I couldnt stand it but I had to stand it.I had to.This was my life.The script I got handed when I walked onto the set.Only, I looked at the script again after Caroline left, with my dads corpse cooling in the ground in a box I bought with weed money, and I figured out I was never the fucking sheriff.Nobody with any goodness in themany sense of justice or rightnesscould have done that to her.Id done it.So who did that make me?Ive got a list in my head: Shit That Has to Get Sorted.At the top of the list is living situation, so on Monday of the week after the funeral, I drive by my grandmas house after work to talk to my mom.Shes on the couch wrapped in the afghan shes adopted.The TVs on, but she doesnt look like shes watching it.She looks like shit, actually.Her hair is limp like she hasnt washed it, and I notice chipped polish on her toenails.I sit down next to her.Whats on?She hands me the remote.Garbage.You can pick if you want.I accept it.Flip through a few channels.Id asked my grandma to take Frankie out for a burger so I could hash some things out with my mom, but now that Im sitting here I sense disaster on the way.I can read Moms moods like the weather, and shes not at her most stable.Its not her mood that worries me, though.Its mine.Theres a dark cloud over my head.If I thought I could put this off another week or two, I would.Did your girlfriend move out to Bos?she asks.No.She went home.Thought she might be sticking around, the way she looks at you.The way Caroline looks at me I throw a wall up there.The way she touched me, the way she tried to comfort me, the way she took off her shoes and dug that grave with me I build the wall taller.My voice is dry when I ask, Whats there to stick around for?The pillow next to me on the couch has a deer on it.A naturalistic forest scene I remember thinking was real cool when I was a kid.Tacky.Thats how this place looks to me now.My whole life here, shabby and low class and tacky.Thats one part of going to a rich kid school in Middle America that I never knew to expect.You spend two years in classrooms with six inch wide heartwood pine molding stained deep, academic brown, and when you go back to where you came from it all looks a hundred times worse than you remembered.Your default settings have shifted.Hondas and Toyotas instead of American cars.Handcrafted instead of machine made.Local and organic and artisanal whatever the fuck, and you can mock it when youre there, but that doesnt keep Hamburger Helper from tasting like warm piss and chemicals the next time you try to eat it.I dont like you staying out there with him, my mom says.Bos all right.You dont know.You werent at the trailer that night.How could I have been?Youre never here.Even when youre home, youre thinking about how much youd rather be somewhere else.With Caroline.Mom trills Carolines name as though only snobs are named Caroline, and Im instantly pissed.I breathe deep, try to shake it off.Shes right that I shouldnt have left.I lost track of my place in the world, went to Putnam, let myself believe there might be more for me, and look what happened.If Id stayed here, Mom would probably still be with Bo.My dad never wouldve come around, couldnt have moved into the trailer because thats where Id have been living.None of this mess wouldve happened if Id stayed.Im here now, I say.But Carolines whispering in my head.Shes saying, Theyre never going to stop taking things from you, not ever.I shouldve told her I dont expect them to.Thats the part Caroline doesnt get, because she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth, and she grew up thinking she could be anybody she wants to, do anything she sets her mind to.The world belongs to Caroline, but it doesnt belong to me.Im from Silt.I was born to take care of my sister and watch out for my mom.I belong to this place and this family, and that means they take from me, and what Im here to do is give them what they need.I cant leave.I cant dream big dreams.I cant have college, or Caroline, or anything outside the borders of this place, because if I leave here I leave Frankie vulnerable to Moms careless mistakes and whatever narrow vision of the future she can form when she cant see past the mountains to guess at what might be possible for her.If I work hard, keep my head down, and take care of business, I can give Frankie the world.Thats the best I can hope for.I want to get a place in Coos, I tell my mom.Someplace big enough for the three of us.Coos?Franks can go to middle school there if we have an address in the district.Theyve got better teachers.Frankies not smart enough for it to matter.Yeah, she is.My mom sighs.Weve had this argument before.You have enough money for rent and a security deposit?Yeah, but if we want someplace nice youre going to have to be working, too.I quit the prison, she says.I cant work at the same place Bos at.This isnt true.She was fired.Bo told me he argued with the human resources people for an hour, trying to get them to keep her on.Hes been there fifteen years and thought he might have enough pull.In the end, though, Mom wasnt worth their waiting on her to come back.One more lie.One more disappointment.Shrug it off.You still have Dads car?I ask.Yeah, but I told Jack he could have it.Why the fuck would you do that?He always liked that car, and he wanted to have something of Wyatts.I cant keep driving Bos truck if Im not paying him rent money and youre treating him like you are.Wheres that leave us?One job and no fucking carhow are we supposed to get by?I dont know, West!I cant cope with all this with your dad gone!When could you cope with it?I snap.When?When could you ever cope?Dont take that tone with me!Ill take it if you deserve it!All youve done since he got shot is cry and feel sorry for yourself and then cause a fight you couldve stopped at the funeral.Its over, Mom.Weve got to move on, because theres shit to figure outwhere were going to live, how well get new school clothes for Frankie, a physical.Is she still on the state health plan?Your dad took her off it.Jesus fuck.So weve got to get her back on and sign up for the Oregon Trail card again.The funeral about cleaned me out, but Ive got enough money left for a cheap car.If you can get a job nights, Ill stay on days at the landscaper, and Ill find an apartment on the bus route so Franks can get to school.I think West.What?Shes rubbing her hands over her face.She looks pale, smells ripe.I cant do any of that.Why not?I cantI cant think.I cant sleep.I want Wyatt.Its hard for me to even see you, you look so much like him, and Just dont look.Dont think.Im not asking you to think.All Im asking you to do is help me get Frankie sorted, get this paperwork rolling.Ill put you on my accounts at the bank.Well do the lease in both our names, and that way West, she interrupts again, her voice a whisper.Fucking what?Shes crying again.Always crying.I remember how my dad used to complain.Youre always fucking crying, Michelle, and when youre not crying youre nagging me.Useless cunt.It should make me feel poisoned, that echo, but instead it makes me hate her.Ive spent half my life trying to be her helper, her partner, her boss.Its not a job Id wish on my worst enemy.I cant, she pleads, wiping her eyes on her sleeve.I just cant.What do you want me to do?Everything?While you sit here on Joans couch and cry?Joan will let me stay.Joans his mom, not yours.He didnt marry you.He didnt stand by you, he didnt treat you good, he didnt respect you or love you or even stop himself from kicking your ass whenever he felt like it.Why are you doing this?Why cling to this sick fucking memory when Frankie needs you?She blows her nose and lowers the tissue.Her mouth is hanging open a bit.She looks wrecked.My hands mash the pillow.I want to do violence to something, but its not her.Her body is the first soft thing I remember, her smile the one Id work for when I was a kid.Her radiance was the treat Id earn if I made the right jokes and read her mood correctly.Im a dick to keep pushing at her when I know shes not exaggeratingshe really cant do this.Frankie doesnt need me, she says.Shes got you.She says it so matter of fact, it sounds like the clang of a cell block gate swinging shut.Frankies got me.I had Caroline.Not anymore.I stand up.Pace back and forth in front of her.Jam my hands into my pockets, take them out, cross my arms, rake my fingers through the stubble of my hair.I know where this conversation is headed, and Im not ready for it.You want me to take care of her, I say.Until when?Until Im feeling up to it.Whens that gonna be?She shrugs and looks at her lap.Until I can work.Get a car, save some money up for a place.I bite back a laugh.Never.Thats when she means.Shes never going to feel up to it.I turn and look at her, wishing I could feel more tendernesssome of the friendship we used to have, if not actually love.I do love her.I just dont like her or respect her or trust her anymore.And I cant carry her.If shes giving me my sister to carry, Ill take that weight on, but I cant handle my mother, too.Not if she wont help me.Fine, I say.But if were gonna do that, well make it official.You give me power of attorney for Frankie.I need to be able to make decisions.Her eyes are huge.Im still her mother.Im not trying to steal her from you.Power of attorney isnt the same as custody.It just means youre giving me permission to do shit like enroll her in school, sign her up for health insurance, that kind of thing.How do you know?Ive looked it up.A dozen times since I was twelve.Will we need a lawyer?No, its pretty simple if both adults are willing.Both?You and me.Oh.A shadow crosses her face.Youre only twenty.I turned twenty one a couple weeks ago.I missed your birthday.Yeah.And for whatever reason, thats the thing that crumples up her face, sets her off crying for real.I sit down again, letting out a slow exhale and holding my arms open so shes got something to fall against.She sobs and tells me how much I look like him.Just like him, just like him.Its breaking her heart.Three weeks later, Dr.T shows up at my work right when Im climbing into the truck to get Frankie from school.Bo told me to keep it.Said he doesnt need it and implied he knows I do.Nothing quite like charity to make you feel like a worthless sack of shit.I pull the door closed and throw Dr.T a wave.The idea is to pretend hes here to check out the water features in the showroom or buy a new garden gnome.Hands on the wheel.Eyes on the rearview.Put the truck in gear.It doesnt work.His arms are waving in my peripheral vision.Hes jogging over, and then hes right beside my door making that gesture that means Roll down the window, so I have to.The window sinks away, and shame crawls over me.It leaves slimy trails up and down my arms, hollows my stomach, snatches at my breath.Its always like this with him.When I first met Dr.Tomlinson, back before I graduated high school, we were friends.Maybe Im fooling myself to remember it that way, but that was how it felt.Like we had things in common, stuff to talk about, ideas we would kick back and forth as we worked our way through eighteen holes in sync.Fucking simpatico.Then he introduced me to Rita.I cant look at him anymore.It takes a monumental effort just to meet his eyes.Every time, Im waiting for him to say it.You fucked my wife.I wasnt sure where else to catch you, he says.Your phones disconnected?I changed to a different carrier.Youre supposed to be able to keep your same number these days, even when you switch.Yeah, there was a mix up.Hes not dumb enough to believe this, but hes too polite to say.Do you have twenty minutes?Ive got to pick up my sister.My paycheck deposit showed up yesterday, and I promised Id take her to buy a few things for school.She grew out of all her leggings and stuff from last year.I was hoping to talk to you about that scholarship.This isnt the day, then.The you fucked my wife day.As the realization hits me, so does my disappointment.Ive been waiting for the other shoe to drop with Dr.T for six fucking years, and its getting so I want it to.I want to be accused by him, attacked by him, fucking blamed by this man for every wrong thing Ive done.Im a villain.I deserve venom.A kick in the ribs.Disgust.He claps a hand on my shoulder, and I flinch.I know youve had a hard year.I understand why you felt you had to leave Putnam, but it seems to me youve got an opportunity here to turn things around.The shame.Jesus, the shame, crawling all over me.Id do almost anything to get out of my body right now, get away.Part of why I left Silt in the first place was so Id never have to sit across a table from Dr.T, listening to him ramble on about my best interests while Rita slid her bare toes up my leg.Ive really got to go, I say.Ill ride along.He walks over to the passenger side and lets himself into the truck, just like thata reminder of how easy it used to be with him.Walking the course together, shooting the shit on his back deck with the view out over the green and the sun sinking down into the ocean.I liked him.I thought if I worked hard enough, put Silt far enough behind me, I could be Dr.Ttrousers and four hundred dollar shoes and a white shirt he doesnt have to worry about staining because his Mexican housemaid drops off his dry cleaning and picks it back up wrapped in plastic every Tuesday.I wonder if everybody elses dreams begin to look like dumb fucking nonsense after a dose of reality, or if its just mine.He buckles his seat belt.I back onto the highway.I talked to someone in the financial aid office about your case last week, he says.You shouldnt be doing that.I know you turned me down, but I keep hoping youll change your mind.You have so much potential.You remind me of the way I was at your age, and I cant stand to see you throw it away.I keep thinking theres got to be a way I can do this for you.Youve done more than enough already.And Im sorry about that tuition that got wasted spring semester.Im gonna see about paying that back to you.You dont have to pay it back.I want to.He turns in the seat, fixes me with that sharp gaze of his.West, Ive been trying to see this whole situation from your perspective.I know taking money was always hard for you.Ive said more than once that the way I see it, moneys a neutral thing, not good or bad.But if I can use what I have to help someone like you, thats not neutral, its overwhelmingly positive.I understand its hard for you to see it that way, okay?Thats the reason Ive hoped that this scholarship might be something you could accept.Because its not me, not my money.This is a Putnam scholarship.Theyre only going to give it to you because you deserve it.I dont deserve anything.All you have to do is fill out some paperwork, and the scholarship is yours.The college tells me they already have records showing youre a student of exceptional merit.Exceptional merit.Id laugh if the phrase didnt make my throat tighten.I licked your wifes cunt.Up against this truck.While Caroline watched.It could be good for your sister, too, he says.I heard shes living with you now.You could take her along.Give her a fresh start.I watch the white line on the highway, willing my mind to go blank.I cant think about what he said, because when I start thinking about shit like whether I could take Frankie and leave, just go, I pore over every angle of it.I work through every possible way it could go down, and then I shut them off, one after another.I dont have to reach for impossibilities because theyre all right there in front of methe impossibility of tearing Frankie away from everything she knows.The impossibility of juggling work and child care and classes all at the same time.The impossibility of taking one more favor from a man Ive screwed over in every conceivable way.I cant tell myself I deserve to, not when I can conjure up the smell of Rita Tomlinsons perfume and the blank white horror in Carolines expression.Wanting things makes me miserable.Wanting things makes me look at trees and guardrails when Im driving, makes me ponder whether I should buy a bottle of whiskey and take it out to Bos, drink it in the driveway until Im ready to unlock his gun cabinet, load up his .48, and put an end to this.I cant, I say.You can, Dr.T insists.No.I cant.I just fucking cant.After that, hes quiet.Too quiet.His hands are folded in his lap, his gaze on the middle distance.It takes him another mile to speak.I had another question I wanted to ask you.Shoot.Its about Rita.My arms are made of lead.My foots a block on the gas pedal.I noticed at the funeral, he says, and after the funeral when I tried to speak with herbut Im not being honest if I say its the first time I wondered.He pauses.Flashes me a quick, uncomfortable smile.Im concerned she might be somewhat obsessed, I guess.With you.Obsessed with me.Is that what you call it?She talks about you a lot.We talk about you, of course, in the usual way, but since youve been back in town, her interest seems liketoo much.He wipes his hand over his mouth.I know this is an awkward question, but has she behaved in any way thats inappropriate?That might cause concern?He wants me to reassure him.Hes scared, because hes figured something out, but he wont let himself see the real shape of it.He doesnt want to add one and one and get two, so hes looking at me to tell him, Hey, no worries, its three.Look.Ill show you the math.I flip the signal and turn the wheel.The truck bounces into the middle school parking lot.No, I say.Nothing to be concerned about.And then I manage a smile.It takes everything Ive got to make it look real, but I give it everything, because I dont want Dr.Tomlinson to know what his wife is like.Its bad enough that I do.Nothing at all.Scrutinizing my expression, he brightens.Oh.Okay.Good.Well, look, if youll do me a favor and let me know if theres anything I should be concerned about, Id appreciate it.Will do.I slow.Brake.Put the truck in Park.School kids are streaming from the building, running, laughing.I see my sister come out the door alone with her head down, hair hanging in her face.She doesnt look like a kid.Not when I see these other ones.Shes different from them, marked, like theres a line around her.New clothes will help.Maybe we can see about getting her hair cut.And just to go back to the scholarship for a minute, he says.Promise me youll at least think about it.The semesters already rolling, but the person I talked to said it wont be too late if you hustle out there.I open the door.Hop out of the truck.West.Sure.Ill think about it.I say it just to shut him up.When Frankie arrives, I make the introductions, load her into the back, drop him off at the lot, and keep going, toward the strip where Rosss is.Who was that guy?she asks.I used to caddy for him.Whats he want?He wants me to go back to Putnam.Shes quiet for a while, looking out the window.Carolines at Putnam.Mmm hmm.Where would I go if you did that?I told him no, Franks.But if you did.Youd go with me.Without Mom?Without Mom.Isnt that against the law?Like, since shes my mom?I could take you if she says its okay.Oh.Thats all shes got to say on the subject.Oh.She tries on jeans.I get angry and then angrier until Im incapable of producing any response to her fashion show that satisfies her.She gets pissed at me for not being excited, and I guess thats fair, because Im pissed at her for saying Oh.Im pissed at myself for wanting her to say something different.Want is a bottomless black hole, sucking at me.Tentacles of faith and hope and trust, wisdom, good judgment, principles, prideeverything I dont havepulling me down.I cant.I fucking cant.I pick up a bottle of whiskey on the way home.Ten minutes after Frankie goes to bed, I pour myself a glass.Hey, Joan.I grab the bag with my lunch out of the fridge.Whats up?Are you at work?No, Im on my way in.I pull the apartment door closed most of the way with my foot, dangle lunch from a few fingers so I can use the rest to snag the knob and operate the key in the lock.Youre going to be late.Im never late.I hear her exhale.Blowing smoke out on the porch.No, I dont guess you are.Stepping up into the truck, I glance at the glove box, but I leave the pack where it is.Im trying to cut back.Caroline wants me to quit.Again and again, I come back to Caroline.Come back to her accusations.Come back to the sight of her in her funeral dress and muddy feet, shoveling dirt.I come back to Carolines laugh, Carolines mouth, Carolines body naked against mine.I come in my hand in the shower, inside her, inside my own memories.Its almost a month since she left Silt, and I need to quit Caroline worse than I need to quit smoking.So listen, Joan says.Your uncle Jack is talking to a lawyer.He put my name down on the paperwork at the hospital, told them Id pay for breaking his nose.Some fucking nerve.Im gonna pay the bill.This isnt about what you did to his faceits about your dad.The ambulance chaser Jacks hooked up with thinks he can make a case against Bo.Emotional distress or whateverlike what whats her names family got against OJ.A civil trial, she means.Since the authorities arent pursuing a criminal case, my uncles going to take justice into his own hands.What kind of case has Jack got?Hes a deadbeat alcoholic dickbag.Whats he going to say, Dads death made him more of one?Watch your mouth.Thats my son youre talking about.Sorry.She sighs.These guys only make their money if they win, she says.The lawyer must think its worth his time.Im telling you because of Frankie.What about her?But I have a sinking feeling I know exactly what.Frankie wakes up thrashing in the sheets, shouting.Sometimes Daddy.Sometimes Bo.Always, Dont!I stand in the doorway of her room and say her name, Franks, Franks, Franks, until she stills because shes heard me, and thats usually when she starts to cry.I wish I knew if I was fucking her up.I sit in the living room after shes asleep and think about how if Frankie ends up depressed, ends up cutting herself, ends up dead, ends up pregnant at fourteenitll be because of me.Something I did or didnt do, some sign I missed that it was my job to see.They could make her testify if theres a trial, Joan says.No fucking way.Even Jack isnt that big of an asshole.Hes got to know Id kill him for even trying it.I think thats the idea.Hes got it in for you since the funeral.I can take care of myself.But if he gets at her She was at a fucking sleepover!Joan sucks at her cigarette so hard I can hear it.Exhales.Day before the funeral, Frankie talked to Stephanie.Jacks wife.Shit.Shit.Stephanies telling everybody Frankie was there at the trailer when Wyatt got shot.Frankie will get dragged into this thing if it happensits not going to do any good to pretend she wont.Shes right.Fucking Leavittstheres a reason I stayed away from them so long, and the reasons that its always like this.Drama after drama, fighting and feuding, arguing over money and sex and drugs and whatever the hell else they can think of.They feed on it.They love it.Jacks going to put Frankie right in the goddamn middle of it.Cant you talk him out of this suit?Bo hasnt got much money.Whatever went down in that trailer, I guarantee you Wyatt deserved it.When have I ever been able to talk a Leavitt man out of anything?I laugh.Dont mean to.I dont have any control over myself.I dont have control over anything.Six years ago, Frankie was too young to be hurt by this kind of Leavitt bullshit, but I wasnt.I cut ties to the Leavitts because they wouldnt take my side, wouldnt protect me and my sister from my father.They wont protect us from this, either.I have to.Thanks for the warning, I say.Let me know when you decide what to do.I disconnect and drop the phone on the seat next to me.The morning is cool, the sun bright over the mountains.The winds blowing through the cab of the truck, rattling the paper bag with my lunch in it.Im young and healthy, alive.Free of my father.I should feel good.I should be able to find a way to feel good about the giant fucking palm smacking into my back, shoving me toward Iowa.Take your sister and go.Thats what Dr.T is trying to get me to do.Thats what Caroline said to me, in no uncertain terms.But all I can think, looking at the green on the hills, at the black ribbon of asphalt, at the blue sky, is this is one more fucking thing in my life I dont get to decide about.I see Iowa in my minds eye.Summertime in Putnam.Green lawns and brick buildings, marigolds and window boxes, students everywhere.The hope spikes right into me, spikes my pulse, makes me breathe too shallow so I start to get dizzy and I have to pull over by the side of the road and slam my hand into the steering wheel and tell myself, No way, no way, no fucking way.I think, Take Frankie somewhere else.Mexico.Oklahoma.Anywhere would doanywhere thats far enough away from Jack and lawyers and courtrooms to keep her safe from all the traumatic assholery heading our way.We could live by a river in an adobe hut.I could learn to train horses.We could eat frijoles and tortillas and Id be inside that fucking Cormac McCarthy novel I read in my first year seminar, but it would be better than letting the hope back in.Before she left, Caroline told me, You have to find a way to get out from under it, knowing its never going away.You have to make your own life, because if you dont, you just wont get to have one at all, and thats the worst fucking thing I can imagine.She says that to me over and over.She says it in my head every day, and every day I say the same thing back to her.The way Ive livedthe life Ive hadI can imagine worse things than you can.Its not so bad to waste your life.Its not so hard.Whats harderwhats fucking impossibleis thinking youve got a future and then losing it.I dont think I can survive it a second time.In the glove box, I locate my last pack of cigarettes and light one up.I smoke it fast, sucking in deep carcinogenic lungfuls, trying to get used to the fact that it doesnt matter if I can stand to live in Putnam or not.I dont have a decision to make.Were going to Putnam, because theres a two hundred thousand dollar education waiting for me there.A bachelors degree that means something.Id be an idiot to turn it down when I can grab it and use it for Frankie.I burned my life in Putnam to the ground.I dont want to wade among the ashes and pitch a tent over top of whats left of it, but I will.I havent got a choice.Later, Ill call Dr.Tomlinson.Every year, winter takes me by surprise.Fall comes and shears the edge off summer, mellows out the temperatures for a few golden days of gorgeous perfection, and then when Im ready to live the rest of my life in those stolen moments, snap.It turns cold one night.Just like that.Growing up, Id deny what it meant.No, not yet.Its not time yet.Id ignore the signs.Id leave my jack o lantern on the front porch long after Halloween, celebrating a season that had passed until black spots showed on the flesh around the pumpkins mouth and it started to look ancient and wizened.Once the first frost did it in, my dad would make me take it out back and chuck it into the woods.So long, fall.But the autumn of my junior year at Putnam, I was ready for the days to get shorter and the temperatures to drop.I braced myself for the cold, preparing to carry on in a Putnam without West, a life without West.It would be cold for a while.Lonely.But Im an Iowa girl.I was used to the cold.I knew how to bundle up against it, muffle my breath behind a scarf, muffle my needs so I could endure the early nights and the long winter.My dad finished annoying the lawyer, and my complaint against Nate got filed in mid September.Sixty days to respond.Plaintiff identified as Jane Doe.The trial date was set for the end of next year.I braced myself for four seasons of waiting and strategizing, subpoenas and scrutiny, depositions and petitions to compel.I thought I had it under control.Then I got a text from a number I didnt know.It was West, telling me he was coming back to school.Another to say he was bringing Frankie.A third to let me know I shouldnt worry, because hed keep his distance.I think what I was supposed to do when I got those texts was freeze.Snap.Go cold, just like that.It would have been easier if I could have locked myself off.Safer to tend my rose garden of ice crystals, pretending to love the cold.But I was through with pretending.I got those texts, and I felt joypure and deep, as real as anything Id ever had with him.I felt vindicated, because this would be another chance.The future hed killed off, now brought back to life.And maybe our future was an ugly, shambling thing.Maybe it was half dead, scarred and foulbut it was ours, and I couldnt pretend I didnt want it.I couldnt even pretend not to be elated, burbling through the days after I got the news, wondering when and where Id see him again, how it would be, how it would feel.That sounds stupid.Naive.I know how it sounds.And I know, too, that a jack o lantern on the front porch is only a jack o lantern until midnight on October 31.One minute after midnight, it becomes a rotting pumpkin.My father used to explain it to me every November.But its the same pumpkin, right?Its the pumpkin you bought, carried home, planned over, cut carefully into.Its the pumpkin you gutted and scraped at, lit up, placed proudly on display.Its the same fucking pumpkin the day after Halloween that it was the day before, and the fall when West came back to Putnam, I was through with people trying to tell me how to feel and what to love.When there are pictures of your cunt on the Internet and strangers emailing to tell you they want to jizz in your facewhen thats happened to you and there is a way in which it will never stop happeningyou have to get really comfortable with the notion that the only person whos allowed to define how you feel about anything is you.I shared an off campus house with seven friends and friends of friends, including my best friend, Bridget, and Wests former roommate, Krishna.Bridget and Krishna nagged at me.What happened, what happened?You can talk to us.You should tell us.We need to know.Everyone wanted to talk to me about West that September.What happened in Silt.How I felt about it.What I was going to do when he came back to Iowa.Even my friend Quinn, who was studying in Florence that semester, pestered me over email.I heard you went out to see West.I need details.Everyone wanted to talk about it, but really they wanted to tell me how to feel.It ticked me off that there was so obviously a right and a wrong way to respond to what West had done, and that everyone seemed to think I was doing it wrongin denial, confused, lost, deflecting.Fuck that.I felt how I felt.I wanted what I wanted.Outside, the weather turned cold, then colder.I saw West everywhere, and I burned.Im driving back to campus when I spot him getting out of his truck at the Kum and Go.I check that the oncoming lane is clear, jerk the wheel to the left in a U turn, and pull up to the curb across the street.My hands tremble in my lap as I watch him walk into the store.Hes wearing short sleeves over long sleeves.His shoulders stretch the fabric.I drink him inthat back, that ass, those long legs in boots.I get wet just from looking.Greedy.Full of an anxious, amped up craving for contact.I want to talk to him, push into him, hit him, fuck him.Crash into him and find out what happens next.Something.Anything.The plate glass front of the shop is crowded with brightly colored posters and signs, but I can see the top of Wests head at the counter.I lean closer to the windshield.My throat is hot, my breasts full.
