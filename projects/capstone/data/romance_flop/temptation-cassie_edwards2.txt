Whats wrong with Terrance?Who?Oh.Natalia pulled her eyes from the mirror.Nothings wrong with him.Hes ok, I guess.Jenifer rolled her eyes and shook her head.Can I ask you something?Why did you even marry the guy if you werent ready?Natalia shrugged.He asked.Really?Thats it?No, I thought I was in love?He treated me like a queen?Justhe asked?Pretty much.Plus, my parents cut me off and he offered to take care of me.So who am I to break a wealthy mans heart?I dont know why I keep engaging in conversation with you.Jenifer shook her head as she usually did when she talked with Natalia and then walked off.It wasnt unusual for Natalia to hang around the office after hours and help the lawyers tie up loose ends.She enjoyed a little mischief in the office, but she did her job and did it well.She noticed it was past 8:00 and decided to call it a night.All of the paralegals had left for the day and only a few lawyers were still around.She popped her head inside to say good night.Hey, Natalia, Michael, one of the partners, called out.I just got a call and need to go and get a client out of jail.Can you stay here and help Bryan out with this brief and close up?This must be my lucky night.When a partner asked you to do something, they werent expecting an answer, but an action.Yeah, sure.I dont mind.Bryan didnt want to work with Natalia, especially when no one else was in the office.Of course, he couldnt tell the partners this.It would make him look weak.He often struggled not to stare, but the way she dressed made it difficult for him to concentrate.As annoying as she was at times, she looked good, really good.When she purposely leaned in towards him exposing her very well endowed bosom, or accidentally passed by him in tight spaces rubbing her body against his, it was impossible to ignore.So far hed been able to control his desires, but it was definitely becoming more and more difficult.Natalia looked up at Bryan who was trying to keep it strictly professional.He kept his eyes glued to the computer screen.She knew he was trying hard to ignore her.Will you get me the files for the MacArthur case?Are you talking to me?Natalia replied.Bryan looked around.There are only two of us here, so yes.He said sarcastically.Well, Natalia turned her chair to face him.She crossed her leg, allowing her already too short dress to ease up her thigh.I think its kind of rude to give orders to someone without either addressing them or at least looking up.She noticed his eyes resting on her thigh and subtly raised it up higher.Bryan quickly turned his head.I apologize, Ms.Philips.Now, could you please get the file I asked for?She went into the file room and retrieved the file.She walked over to where he sat, bending over close enough to give him a view of her cleavage.He glanced quickly and then looked away.Thank you, Ms.Philips.Ms.Philips?she asked smiling.Why so formal?Natalia is fine.She moved in closer.Her body only inches away from the side of his face.Do I make you nervous, Mr.Hunter?Bryan closed his eyes and let out a frustrated sigh.Look, Natalia.Im flattered, but Im really not interested.What I would like to do is finish this up so I can get home.Bryans tone didnt faze Natalia in the least.She could look at him and tell he was affected by her.Without another word, she turned and went back to her chair.She grabbed some Kleenex and pretended to wipe her eyes while sniffling.Bryans kept his eyes on her.She took it up a notch and pretended to blow her nose.Excuse me.She stood to leave.Natalia, wait.Bryan said.Natalias personality was too strong for his taste, but he didnt want to see her cry.Im sorry.I didnt mean to be so rude to you.I guess Im just a little tired.She turned to him.Im sorry if I came on too strong.Im not always very good at small talk.I have a hard time making friends and I really didnt know how to get your attention.Im sure youve heard what people say about me.But the truth is I want to be liked just like everyone else.Is that so much to ask?Bryan wasnt sure if she was running game on him or if she was really being sincere.After months of her flirting and accidentally rubbing up against him, the way she smelled, and the way she looked in that short, fitted red dress was probably clouding his judgement.At that point, he didnt care if she was for real or not.She was so appealing standing there looking sweet and vulnerable.He stood and walked closer to her.No, its not too much to ask.He put his hands on each side of her waist and pulled her close.She pressed her body against his, reached up wrapping her arms around his neck and connected her lips with his.After locking up the building and walking Natalia to her car, Bryan sat in his car angry at himself for going there with her.He couldnt see a future with her and he was never one to string a woman along.Why couldnt he make it through the night without being able to control himself?He decided he couldnt be alone with Natalia again.He said a prayer of repentance and drove home.4  Ashlee stood during worship with her eyes closed, her hands lifted as the praise team ministered in song.She allowed the words to minister to her spirit.She sang along to Tasha Cobbs song:  You provide the fire, Ill provide the sacrifice  You provide the spirit, and I will open up inside  Fill me up God, Fill me up God, Fill me up    Tears streamed down her face as she became lost in His presence.She didnt care who was around or how crazy she looked.She was happy to finally be free.Free from Jamal and free in Christ.Her neighbor Ms.Esther had become like a mother to her, guiding her walk with the Lord and helping her understand the Bible.Ashlee was growing spiritually.This was the happiest shed ever been.For the first time in a long time, she didnt feel ashamed of herself or her three year old son and six month old little girl.For the past three months, Bryan had found it difficult to really press into Gods presence.He couldnt let go of the guilt from the affair he had going on with Natalia.Each time they were together, he hated himself for giving in.She was so persistent and aggressive.He opened his eyes and looked around at all the others who seemed to be lost in worship.He figured he must have been the only sinner in the house that Sunday.Either that or theyve mastered the art of faking it.He looked to his left.His eyes beheld the most beautiful woman hed ever seen.He watched as she worshiped God with everything that was within her.For the first time in his adult life, he wasnt attracted to a womans body.It wasnt like he could see any of it anyway.He smiled as he watched her.She wore a blue jean skirt that stopped at her ankle and didnt even come close to touching her body.It looked like something that came from his mothers closet.The shirt she wore was long sleeved and buttoned to her neck.The only make up she wore was soft pink lip gloss.He knew he had a long way to go before he was delivered because the only thing he could think about in the middle of worship was kissing the gloss right off her lips.He had seen her with Mother Johnson, his moms best friend and was pretty sure she had children.He overheard Mother Johnson and his mother mention she had finally kicked her boyfriend out, so he knew she wasnt married.Bryan didnt particularly like the idea of a ready made family, but there was something so beautiful about the lady that stood only one aisle over from him.He had to get to know her.As soon as the pastor gave the benediction, Bryan hurried over to where Ashlee stood.Its Ashlee, right?Ashlee looked up and smiled.Yes, Im Ashlee.My name is  Bryan, right?She interrupted.He smiled.She knows who I am.Ive seen pictures at Mother Hunters house and she talks about you a lot.She explained.My mother, of course.At a loss for words, Bryan stood watching Ashlee.Ashlee looked down at herself and started to feel self conscious.She turned to leave.It was nice meeting you.Bryan saw she started to walk off.He walked up beside her.Can we get together for coffee sometime?Without looking his way, she replied, Thank you, but no.I dont drink coffee.Okay then.How about lunch?I work almost every day and I usually bring my lunch and eat at work.She replied honestly.Okay, thats cool.How about dinner?He knew he probably seemed eager, but he really didnt care.Ashlee finally stopped walking and turned to him.I really appreciate your kindness.But, because of my work schedule, I hardly get a chance to see my children.So when Im not working, we eat dinner together at home.Just the three of us.With that, she walked away leaving Bryan with a bruised ego and his interest piqued.5  Bryan thought of Ashlee for the rest of the day.He drove to work the next morning with her on his mind.He had never met a woman who turned him down without a thought.Women usually threw themselves at him.The only thing he had to do was flash a smile.If they didnt fall in love with his dimples, his hazel eyes usually did the trick.She didnt even care that he was a lawyer and most women loved that.Ashlee was like a breath of fresh air.After she made him promise not to show up or call her at work, hed finally convinced his mother to tell him where Ashlee worked.He called the florist that morning and set up a bouquet of roses to be delivered to her every day for the next two weeks.He smiled at the thought.His smile faded when he looked up and saw Natalia.He knew if he wanted a woman like Ashlee, and he did, he had to be completely changed.Hed broken it off with her last week, but she didnt take him seriously.He decided it was definitely over between them.Bryan looked up as he heard a tall, somewhat nerdy looking guy ask Mara, the receptionist, if Natalia Philips was in.He turned towards Kevin who had become a good friend of his.Hey, man.Do you know who that guy is?Hes asking for Natalia.Kevin looked up.No, Ive never seen him before.Mara buzzed Natalia.Natalia, your husband is here to see you.Bryans head snapped up.Husband?He looked up to see a panic stricken Natalia come around the corner to greet her husband.She didnt look very happy to see him.She ran in, grabbed his arm, and escorted him out as quickly as he had come inside.Bryan went back into his office.He couldnt believe she was married.It would be different if the affair causally happened, but Natalia purposely flirted with him every chance she had and didnt object or seem remorseful during their fling.He picked up the phone.Natalia, can I see you in my office please?
