Bryan shook his head.Why did I ever get involved with her?I should have listened to Kevin.He wondered if he should just tell Ashlee everything.It wasnt like he was ever with her while they were together and it wasnt like she didnt have a past.The difference was, she gave him the details of her past from the start.Bryan sat in his car for a while after he parked.He closed his eyes and reclined in his seat.He thought about having to see Natalia every day at work.Sure, he was no longer attracted to her but he couldnt just walk past her without thinking about Breah.If he told Ashlee, how would she handle knowing he had to work with the mother of his child every day?Would she be comfortable with that?It wasnt like he could quit his job.He was only going into his second year at the firm.Switching jobs so soon wouldnt look good.Besides, he loved his job.He hated the idea of starting his life with Ashlee with a lie.To assuage his guilt, he reasoned she had been through so much already and didnt need the drama.She deserved this time to be happy.Plus, he didnt want to risk losing her.He decided, for now, he would keep this new information to himself and worry about it another time.With that, he got out of his car and went inside.Good afternoon, he said to Trina, the receptionist on duty at Hillside.I would like to see Ashlee Allen if shes available please.Hey, Bryan.Bryan turned to see who greeted him.He didnt recognize her, but she wore scrubs and a nursing assistant badge.Monica extended her hand to him.He accepted.Im Monica, she said with a firm handshake.We havent met, but Im Ashlees best friend.Shes mentioned you quite a bit actually.Its nice to finally meet you.Is she available?She sure is, Monica replied.Come on.Ill show you where she is.How did you know who I was when weve never met?Bryan asked as they walked down the hall.The night you proposed, I was there when you picked her up.Why didnt you say hi?Monica smirked.Ashlee thought I was gone, but I was sitting in my car watching.Bryan laughed.She told me you were um  What, crazy?Just a little bit.She laughed.Bryan was used to being gawked at by women.However, he experienced an all new level of discomfort with the way some of the other CNAs watched him while he and Monica walked down the hall.Monica noticed his raised eyebrow and frowned.Ugh.Yall act like youve never seen a man before.She turned to Bryan, Dont pay them any attention.They dont have lives.Ashlees in there with Ms.Flora Mae.Shes the only one that can deal with her.That woman is as mean as a snake.She wont let anyone come near her except Ash.Shell wet herself and stay in it all night until Ashlee gets in the next morning.Ashlee loves her though.I think thats one of the reasons she works so many doubles, so she can look after Ms.Flora Mae.Let me go in and let her know youre here.She knocked on the door and stuck her head inside.Ashlee, you have a visitor.Ashlee looked over her shoulder towards Monica.Ok, Ill be out in a few.She turned back to Ms.Flora Mae.Okay.Are you ready to see it?Yeah, yeah.Just show me already.Ashlee turned the wheelchair towards the mirror.Ms.Flora Mae gave her a genuine smile.Before breakfast, Ashlee had helped Ms.Flora Mae wash her hair.Then, she pulled it up into a ponytail and rolled it.Shed taken out the rollers and added a yellow flower, Ms.Flora Maes favorite color, on the side.Thank you, hun.It looks fine.Now hurry up and give me a hug before somebody walks in here.Ashlee gladly obliged.She turned to see Monica and Bryan standing in the doorway.Who is that fine hunk o man?Bring him on in here so he can see how fine I look, Ms.Flora Mae smiled showing her gums.Ms.Flora Mae, this is Bryan Hunter.My fiance.They show makin em fine these days.She looked past Bryan to Monica.I guess youll have to do.Take me on down there, so I can eat some of that crap they call lunch.Ashlee looked around to make sure there was no one around.She pushed Bryan against the wall, wrapped her arms around his neck, and gave him a long passionate grown up kiss.When she finally stepped back, Bryan let out a breath.If I knew I would be greeted like this, I would have started coming here long before now.He took a long look at her and asked, How is it that you can spend your days taking care of people in this capacity and still look so good?She buried her face in his chest so he wouldnt see her blushing.Can you get away for lunch?Yeah, I have an hour.Let me clock out and tell Gail Im leaving the building.Where are we going?Ashlee asked while buckling her seat belt.Wherever you want.We can call ahead and have it ready to save time.Honestly, I just wanted to see you.I didnt plan on any place in particular.Ashlee grabbed Bryans hand and caressed the top with two fingers.I want to go to your place.Shed seen his town house, but always refused to go inside.It was a rule she had set in order to stay out of trouble.Bryan glanced at Ashlee with a lopsided smile and a raised eyebrow.Are you sure about that?You were always against it before.I know.But that was then, before we were engaged.Weve spent so much time with other people, I dont want to share you with anyone else.She turned her body towards him and leaned in so close he could feel her breath on his neck.She looked up and said in a low tone, You said whatever I want.Bryan cleared his throat.To be honest, I dont have much to eat at my house.Im fine with sandwiches or whatever.Im not that hungry anyway.Ashlees words sounded innocent enough.But the way shed said or whatever all low and seductive like, and the way she kept looking at him wreaked havoc on his senses.She was actually flirting with him, something hed never seen her do before.After the night on the yacht, Bryan couldnt trust himself to be alone with her.He was still trying to cool off from the kiss shed just planted on him.He scratched the top of his head and gave her a quick glance.I really dont think thats a good idea.Ashlee moved away from him and leaned on the door.She was disappointed.This was his first time seeing that look on her face and he never wanted to see it again.Okay, he said, we can go to my place, but let it be known I think its a bad idea.Bryan lived in a two bedroom townhouse.It wasnt luxury, but it was definitely a few steps up from the one bedroom duplex Ashlee lived in.She looked around and noticed there was no dcor.Everything was black from the furniture to the curtains.Even the area rug was black.She smiled.Bryan watched Ashlee as she observed his home.I know.Its not what you expected, is it?No, I love your place.Its spacious.It appears to be in a great neighborhood, and most importantly, its clean.Im glad you like it.They sat on the couch.Here, I got this for you.She took the phone from his hand and looked at it.No.She handed it back.I dont want you buying me stuff like this.Bryan had expected that reaction.Ashlee was determined to make it on her own.She had worked enough overtime and had been so frugal with her money over the last two years, she had a pretty good savings.If shed wanted a cell phone, she could have easily purchased one herself.She did not like handouts.Youre going to be my wife, sweetheart.This is what husbands do.Please take it.If not for you, do it for me.I want to be able to reach you whenever I need to and Ill feel better knowing youre okay when were not together.She took it from his hand.Fine, Ill take it.She studied it for a moment.Awww cool.It has a purple case on it.Thats my favorite color.She scooted closer to him.He wrapped his arm around her.She folded her legs up on the couch and relaxed in his embrace.She leaned further into him and heard his stomach rumble.She tried to stifle a laugh.Whats so funny?Your stomach.Its growling.I mean like seriously growling.I hope the food gets here soon.Bryan had called and ordered a pizza on the way over.She relaxed even more, resting her head in his lap.She turned to face him.What is it?When are we getting married?Ashlee asked barely above a whisper.When do you want to get married?She shrugged.We can go today and Ill be okay with it.Dont you want a wedding?Not really.As long as Mama Esther, your parents, Monica, and my sister Tracy are present, Im fine.You know I dont like to make a big deal out of stuff.I dont want a lot of people standing around looking at me.Okay.Maybe not today, but lets try and get something together within the next few weeks.How does that sound?Ashlee shrugged.Bryan laid his head back and closed his eyes.Ever since the night Bryan proposed, Ashlee has been fighting to keep impure thoughts of them together out of her mind.She knew it wasnt a good idea to come to his apartment with him.At the moment, she didnt want to fight it anymore.When they werent together, she missed him like crazy.Hes all she ever thought about.When he showed up unexpectedly at her job today, she was ecstatic.
