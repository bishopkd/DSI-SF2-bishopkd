Eighteen years ago Laura Gantt didnt believe in ghosts, but sometimes she wondered if living across from a graveyard had warped her.Part Irish, all southern, descended from moonshiners and holy rollers, shed always believed in things she couldnt see.Her dad said it was just the old whisperings in their blood.All morning, shed heard soft, sure warnings.Some kind of trouble was on its way.The whisperings hinted it would come for Sean.She and her friends, plus one tagalong kid sister, had been picking blackberries for an hour in the brambles that lined the railroad tracks.Trees choked with kudzu vines loomed above them like green monsters.A few feet away, Cassie Bright and her little sister worked side by side, their blond hair damp with sweat.Sean Halloran was bent over the brambles farther down the tracks.He looked lost in a T shirt his brother had outgrown.Sean straightened and squared his skinny shoulders.No slacking off, Gantt, he hollered.Lazy bum.Laura swatted a mosquito on her arm and tried to think of a smart comeback.She gave up and shrugged.Sean went back to work, laughing, but he couldnt fool her.She knew what he lived with.Sweat trickled down her neck.She was sick of the heat, the scratches, the bug bites.There were snakes too.She tried not to think about the snakes.Cassie stopped working to examine her fingers, stained purple with juice.Ugh.I hate blackberries.I hate snakes worse, Laura said, thinking of Seans father.The Halloran boys called him by his first name Daleto show their disrespect.Never to his face, though.They wouldnt dare.Cassie moved closer between long reaching canes that bristled with wicked little thorns.Guess what?she said quietly.The Cheevers heard the Peeping Tom last night.He was pitching pebbles at their windows.Why do you act like its good news?Its creepy.Yeah, but this town could use a little excitement.My dad says its Slattery.Laura shivered in spite of the heat.A sloppy, skinny man, Slattery lived in a run down duplex just down the road.Nobody knew his first name.How would your dad know who it is?she asked.He has a friend whos a deputy, remember?He tells us all kinds of stuff.Laura dropped a handful of ripe berries into her bucket.Your dads friend should spend less time talking and more time catching bad guys.Youre scared.Scared of a silly prowler.No, Im not.My daddy has his guns.Bet you wont be so brave when the Peeping Toms at your window.Heoh!Cassie shrieked and giggled.Mr.Gantt, you spooked me.Sneaking up like that.Laura hadnt noticed her father either, but there he was.A curlicue of wood shavings clung to his shirt, and the humidity made his sandy blond hair frizz where it escaped from under his baseball cap.He didnt seem to be in one of his moods, but she wasnt sure until he tipped his cap, his eyes twinkling.My apologies, Miss Cassie, he said.I didnt aim to scare anybody.Looks like youve got that department covered, though.He wrapped his arm around Lauras shoulders.Hey, sweetheart.Are you managing to comport yourself like a lady?Always.Laura leaned into his sun warmed shirt and that familiar smell of sawdust.You dont have to keep checking on us.Were not babies.Even when youre a grown woman, youll be my baby girl.No matter what.Out of nowhere, a heavy sadness settled on her.Whether it was about his troubles or Seans, it made her feel like a grown woman already.A grown woman who didnt mind being called her fathers baby girl.And youll always be my dad, she said.No matter what.He smiled and gave her ponytail a gentle tug.Then he nodded toward Cassies sister.Tiggers still a baby even if she doesnt think so, he said quietly.Yall keeping an eye on her?Laura and Cassie glanced at each other and swiveled their eyes back to him.Yes sir, they said in unison.He turned toward Sean.Young Mr.Halloran.Its good to see you, son.Its good to see you too, sir.Sean spoke with so much respect that she half expected him to salute his hero.Her father, Elliott Gantt.I understand your brother enlisted, her dad said.Yes sir.Sean came closer to his idol but not too close.Hes in boot camp.You must be proud.Yes sir, I am.I hope hell never have to go to war.If he does, though, hell make you prouder still.Yes sir.I know he will.Lauras dad stole a few berries from her pail.Yall behave, now.He studied Tigger, his expression softening.You too, Tig.Be good for your big sister.I will, she chirped.Youre always a good girl, arent you?Tigger nodded and gave him an angelic smile, drawing a laugh from him and a subdued grumble from Cassie.Ill get back to work, he said.That wood wont make itself into anything useful.Bye, Dad, Laura said.See you at supper.Yep.And well have cobbler again, I hope.You and your mama make the best blackberry cobbler in Georgia.He swiped a few more berries, their color nearly matching the neat lettering on his muscular armlife everlasting.A memento of his army days, it was his only tattoo.A bright yellow butterfly wove a wobbly path above his head as he waded through the brambles, finally disappearing in the tangle of green.He would come out on First Street, a block from his workshop in downtown Prospect.I wish he wouldnt keep checking on us, Laura said.I mean, come on.Were twelve.Yeah, maybe he needs to loosen up a little.As Sean approached, Cassie lowered her voice.Just be glad hes not like Seans dad.What a creep.Sean came closer, his pail bumping against the leg of his too short jeans.He scowled at Cassie.I heard that.She scowled back.Sorry, but its true.That doesnt mean yall have to go around yammering about it.You have to tell somebody, Laura said.He squinted at her.Tell somebody what?Dont play dumb.She lifted his floppy sleeve so Cassie could see the new bruise on his sun browned shoulder.He yanked the sleeve down, moving so quickly that berries spilled from his bucket.Mind your own business.You are my business, Laura said.Youre my friend.He walked off without answering, his head high and his shoulders stiff.Cassie wrinkled her nose.Whats wrong with him lately?Everythings worse since Keith enlisted.Lauras eyes watered.Now Seans got nobody to watch his back.His brother mustve been sick of looking after him.Like Im sick of looking after Tigger.Dont say that.Youre lucky to have a sister.Yeah, Im real lucky.Im always stuck watching her so she wont wander off.Sometimes I wish she would.Cassie!You know I dont mean it.Im just so tired of having her tag along.Tigger the Tagger.Cassie stared into the distance, her eyes rimmed with smudges of the mascara shed borrowed from her moms bathroom.Someday Ill get out of here.Out of Georgia.All the way to Hollywood, maybe.She brightened.Mom bought some new nail polish.Sunset Boulevard Red.Lets go paint our nails.My dad doesnt want me to paint my nails until Im older.Youre older than you were yesterday, so youre older.Come on.He wont even notice, and your mom wont care.Shes cool.Hey, maybe we can talk my mom into renting a movie.Cassie popped a berry into her mouth and walked away.Laura studied her purple fingertips.Berry stains were allowedand so was a tattoo, at least for her dadbut nail polish wasnt.It didnt make sense.She continued tugging ripe fruits from their stems, aware that Sean was slowly working his way back.At last he stopped beside her.He reached for a cane loaded with berries that hung like black jewels in the bright green leaves.Sorry I got mad.I just dont like it when you tell me what to do.I cant make you do what I say, but you sure cant keep me from saying what I think.He gave her a quick glance and went back to picking.Youre all right, Gantt.Sometimes.For a girl.Cassie popped up from behind a bush.Sean and Laura, sittin in a tree, she chanted.K I S S Knock it off, Sean said.Were just friends.Were all friends, Laura said.All three of us.She looked over her shoulder.Tigger was singing softly, paying no attention to the rest of them.Laura placed her bucket on a patch of relatively clear and level ground.Put down your berries for a minute.Sean and Cassie cooperated, but they looked hot and tired and skeptical.Whats this about?Sean asked.Ordering me around again?Yes.Listen up, yall.Hands together, right now.We have a promise to make.Three pairs of hands layered themselves together, stained and sticky with juice, marked with dirt and scratches and bug bites.The girls hands were pale and small compared to Seans bigger, darker hands.A bruise Laura hadnt noticed before circled his left wrist like a wide purple bracelet.Me too, Tigger said, bouncing toward them on her skinny legs.Her glittery pink hair clip was about to fall out of her silky hair.Cassie pushed her sister away.This isnt little girl stuff.Im not little!Im almost eight.Let her stay.Laura drew Tigs hands in with the bigger ones.Were just going to promise well always be there for each other.A glance at Sean made her heart hurt.Well look out for each other.Always.That wasnt half of what she wanted to say, but her throat had clogged up.The others only stared at her.Say it, she ordered in a whisper.Promise.I promise, Sean and Cassie said, and Tigger piped up with another Me too.Sean glared at each one in turn, his shaggy hair half veiling his fierce blue eyes and hiding most of the tiny scars on his forehead.But yall have to promise you wont do anything stupid either.He looked straight at Laura.Promise you wont go blabbing things that shouldnt be blabbed.I promise, Cassie said.No blabbing.No blabbing, Tigger parroted.Lauras hands were roasting.She felt as trapped as the times shed knelt at the altar until her legs ached, but she didnt dare move in the middle of a moment that might have been sacred.This wasnt church, though.It was pure foolishness, probably.Laura, Sean said.Promise.Maybe this was part of being there for him, part of being his friend: promising to do things his way.Because, after all, she didnt know what kind of trouble shed stir up for him if she told her folks about his bully of a father.She let out her breath.When she inhaled, her lungs seemed to fill with a deep sadness that seeped into every cell of her body.I promise.No blabbing.Sean nodded.His face relaxed a tad.A honeybee drowsed over his shoulder, breaking the spell.Laura flexed her fingers but couldnt free herself from the sticky, sweltering pile of hands.Tigger yanked loose, releasing the rest of them too.Sean, lookit, she said, picking up her pail.I got tons of berries.Thats a lot, he said.Good work, Tig.She scampered away, her pale hair catching the light.The sun always seemed to find her, even in the shade.Cassie held her juice stained hand to her heart.There.We made a solemn vow, signed in the blood of a thousand berries.Dropping the dramatic pose, she laughed and walked away.Sean poured his berries into Lauras pail, filling it to the brim.Give em to your mom.You dont want any?You think I bake pies and things?Nah.Im gonna go drown some worms behind the Bennetts place.Now?The fish wont be biting.Thatll still be better than hanging around with a bunch of girls.She gave his wiry shoulder a gentle shove.Get out of here, then.Get out of my way and I will.Stop by later, she said.I might be at Cassies house for a while, though.Dont start slapping on the makeup like she does.I like you the way you are.Laura blinked.And dont bat your eyelashes at me, he added.I wasnt Sure, you were.Sean gave her a quick grin and sauntered away.He would follow the tracks north for a while.Then he would cut to the left on the dirt road that led to the Bennetts little lake.He never had qualms about fishing on private property.But he hadnt brought a fishing line, and his house was in the other direction.He only wanted a place to hide out while his dad was home.Sean didnt have a mom to stick up for him.Or to bake cobblers with.He would be all right, though.He was smart and strong and good.He would run away if he had to, and then Dale Halloran wouldnt have anybody left to kick around but the dog.Man, its hot, Cassie said, slapping a mosquito on her neck.Lets go.Yeah, Im done too.Sean gave me his berries.Come on, Tigger, Cassie said.Time to bounce along home.Tigger pouted.I have to fill my bucket first.Oh, all right, but come straight home.Stay away from the tracks.You hear?Uh huh.Tanya Jean Bright, say Yes maam.Cassie sounded just like her mother.Yes maam.Tiggers quick fingers went back to finding berries.Take some of mine, Laura told her.Then your mom will have plenty and you can come home with us.No!I want to fill up my own bucket by my own self.Laura pulled Cassie aside.We cant leave her by herself.We just told my dad Shell be fine, Cassie said.We can look out the bedroom window and see her.Shoot, shell be home in five minutes.Even if she stays longer, shes smart about trains and stuff.Cmon, lets go paint our nails.My mom has tons of new makeup samples too.Laura imagined herself drinking something cold and sweet inside the Brights cool, dark house.Cassies dad was at work, and her mom never interfered with girls who wanted to primp and giggle.Mrs.Bright was like an aunt to Laura.The fun kind of aunt.She fell in behind Cassie.By the time theyd made their way up the bank to the shoulder of the road, Tigger had started singing again.Her tiny voice floated behind them, growing fainter as they walked away.Laura and Cassie were at the house in two minutes, their berries sitting on the coolness of the kitchen counter.Mrs.Bright was in her bedroom, fussing over a sewing project, but Cassie stuck her head in long enough to tell her they were back.Then she brought her moms nail polish and makeup samples to the kitchen table where the lighting was good.Wash up and gimme your hand, Cassie said.After a moments hesitation, Laura obeyed.She wondered if the fruit in the Garden of Eden was the same lovely, warm shade of coral red.Sunset Boulevard Red.Half an hour later, her nails felt weighted and conspicuous.Her skin felt coated, her pores choked with something called Sunlight Bisque Foundation.Her eyes stung from their first exposure to mascara and liner.Staring at herself in a hand mirror, she decided shed better scrub her face before her dad got a look at her.Hed say she was too young for makeup.Hed say she was just a little girl, not much older than Tigger Laura lowered the mirror.Cassie?Tig still isnt back.Oops.Wed better go get her.Cassie was halfway to the door already.Im in deep doo doo if my mom finds out.They stepped outside, careful not to make noise and alert her mother to their exit.Once theyd reached the shoulder of the road, they ran, their sneakers making the gravel fly.There she is.Cassie pointed but didnt slow down.They closed the gap quickly as Tigger trudged toward them.Her face was filthy, and shed either spilled most of her berries or eaten them.What took you so long?Cassie asked.Ignoring Cassie, Tigger fixed her tearful blue eyes on Laura.Your dad scolded me and told me to go home.And he told the creepy man to go What creepy man?With her free hand, Tigger pushed her hair out of her eyes, leaving a purple smear on her sweaty forehead.The weirdo.Cassie gave her a skeptical look.Slattery?Yeah, right.Dont tell fibs.I dont.Lauras daddy yelled at him andTigs fingers explored higher on her head, moving faster and faster.Wheres my new hair clip?It fell out!Dont start bawling.Ill buy you another one.Cassie started finger combing Tigs hair.Youre lucky we promised we wont blab.We wont tattle on you for staying by yourself at the berry patch.Right, Laura?Laura nodded, awed by Cassies slick shifting of the blame.As long as you dont tell Mom, youre not in trouble, Cassie said, wiping Tiggers wet cheeks.Hey, you want to try nail polish?Tiggers eyes widened.Yeah!Her cheerfulness restored, she scurried toward the house.Laura and Cassie followed at a slower pace.Close call, Cassie said in a low voice.Were still in trouble.My dad will tell your dad.Uh oh, youre right.Cassie made a face.Well, if my folks decide Im a bad baby sitter, maybe theyll stop making me baby sit.The three girls trooped up the steps to the back door and into the kitchen.Tigger climbed into a chair and spread out her grubby hands for her first ever fingernail polish.Grateful that Tig had come safely home, Laura leaned against the counter and stared out the window at the bright blue sky.A train whistle moaned in the hills.Sean must have heard it too, up at the Bennetts little lake where he hid out whenever he was afraid to go home.Shivery sadness filled her again, as lonesome as the whistle of the far off train.Eighteen years later The preacher was stretching out the altar call as long and thin as he could manage.If, as hed ordered, every eye was closed and every head was bowed, Laura could sneak out from her back row seat before she got trapped in small talk with the old ladies in the pew ahead of hers.Their stale perfumes smelled as dusty as the hymnals.She sneaked a peek at the red book in the wooden rack in front of her knees.A month ago, mid April, shed stood in the front row with a hymnal shaking in her hands as she tried to ignore the flower covered casket a few feet away.Two days later shed flown back to Denver, unable to come to grips with her loss.Instead, shed worried about the cat shut up alone in the empty house.For a month, poor old Mikey had no company but Ardelle Bright, whod offered to stop by every day to feed him.It wasnt ideal, but hed survived.The elderly women were busy murmuring to God and wouldnt even notice if she left.Laura dug behind her for her raincoat and pulled it on, then rose from the hard wooden pew and ducked into the aisle.Pausing beside the rain sprinkled window, she faced the graveyard.The finality of it hit her harder now than it had when Gary Bright had called with the bad news, his voice hushed and strange.Instantly, shed known someone had diedbut her mother?Impossible.Lauras eyes heated with tears.She turned away from the window and tiptoed toward the swinging door that opened on the tiny foyer.She pushed the door slowly so it wouldnt creak.And there stood Sean Halloran, looking cramped among the coat racks and the lost and found box and a jumble of umbrellas along the wall.His straight, shaggy hair looked windblown even in the motionless air.Although he was only hiding in the back, hed dignified his faded jeans with a white dress shirt and a necktie.His mouth still had the sarcastic little tilt that shed loved since third grade or so.She hadnt seen him since the graveyard service.Even then, at her own mothers funeral, hed made those old longings flutter inside her like angels wings.He was a charmer, after all, and the first boy shed ever kissed.She shut the door as quietly as shed opened it.What a nice surprise, she said, just above a whisper.Blame it on my weakness for older women.The old joke about their three day age difference made her smile but also brought a pang of regret.This old woman is still on Colorado time and tired from the drive, so be nice.Ill think about it, he answered just as softly.His smile brought out pleasant crows feet at the corners of his eyes.What time did you get in?About two in the morning.I called the house awhile ago and you didnt answer, so I figured you were here.Have you talked to anybody yet?No, I walked in late and sat in the last row.She waited for him to tease her about being late for church when she only had to cross the road.But Sean looked away, one hand fidgeting with his necktie.The preacher had worked his way up to a thunderous finish.The organist pounded out the first notes of a hymn.The service was officially over.Id like to walk you home, Sean said, not smiling anymore.We need to talk.About what?Youll find out.The door swung open.One of the elderly women exited in a cloying cloud of cheap scent.Recognition flashed in her eyes, and her red lipsticked mouth moved in a babble of sympathy that Laura had heard all too often back in April.Everybody started by saying they were so sorry and ended with something like It must have been her time or Ill be praying for you.Nobody ever said anything original or entirely honest.Because Jess Gantt had drifted into some unorthodox beliefs, half the town thought she was new fuel on the fires of hell, but they were afraid to say it.Are you back to stay, sugar?the woman asked at the end of her sermonette.No, Im here to sort out my moms things.And youre still teaching history inwhere is it?Colorado.Thats nice, being a teacher.Youll have your whole summer free.The womans claw like fingers clutched the sleeve of Lauras raincoat.Its a mercy the heart trouble took your mama quick before somethin terrible like cancer could take her slow.Your poor daddy too, gone so sudden.Who knows what the good Lord spared him, unless its like they say and Thank you, Mrs.Moore, Sean said, breaking the womans grip.May the good Lord spare you a slow death, too.He took Lauras hand and pulled her toward the exit.Soon, he added under his breath.She smiled a little inside.Hed always had a gift for soft spoken, thinly veiled jabs.Youre a blessing to have home, baby, the woman called.Ill be praying for you.Thanks, Laura said, but Prospect wasnt home anymore, and she couldnt bear one more person spouting the only things that were left to say when death blew holes in sweet beliefs about a God who answered prayer.It wasnt heart trouble anyway.It was a cerebral aneurysm, out of the blue.God hadnt given her mom any last minute chances.Seans hand released hers and settled on the small of her back.He ushered her outside, under the overhang and then down the steps and into the rain.He produced a black umbrella from somewhere and swung it over her.A gust of wind batted it off center, but he fought back and conquered.Lets get a move on, he said, glancing behind them.Whats the rush?Scared of little old ladies?Shed given him a perfect setup for another wisecrack, but he didnt answer.Unnerved by his strange urgency, she walked faster.On the hillside across the parking lot lay the graveyard where flowers had blanketed a white casket in April.If there was no life after death, her mother was only a dead body in a box.Her father was only bones that had rested at the bottom of Hamlin Lake for years now.End of story.No heaven, no hell.No Judgment Day.Gram and Poppa Flynn, buried a few feet from their daughters new grave, would have called that heresy.The wet wind slapped Lauras face like a rebuke.Running out of walkway, she stepped onto the grass and turned toward home with Sean by her side.Her heels sank into the saturated ground, its wetness seeping through the seams of the shoe leather.If her dad were alive, he would have told her to wear sensible shoes.Sunday mornings when she was a child, hed always buffed her patent leather shoes and polished his black wingtips.Then hed walked her across the road to Sunday school, holding her hand.Back then, shed thought her parents would be around forever.Maybe that was why shed dragged herself out of bed for church.Shed unconsciously hoped the familiar setting would let her pretend for a while that her parents were with her.That they hadnt vanished into the sweet by and by, wherever it was.She picked up her pace.Just walk.Dont think.Just walk.Dont think.The mindless words beat in tandem with her footsteps and wrapped her in a stillness that nearly could have passed for peace.Deep inside, though, she was raw.The shock that had acted as anesthesia had worn off.Sean slid his hand to her shoulder, slowed her down, reined her in.Get back under the umbrella.You know I dont like umbrellas.I dont like you catching pneumonia.I was going to bring my truck over But the house is closer than the parking lot.I know.Im fine, Sean.She didnt want to be moved by his blunt kindness.And she certainly didnt want to be moved by his touch, but she was grateful for the warmth of his hand.She was cold.Colder than shed ever felt in Colorados snowy winters.Even in the mountains, Georgia shouldnt have been so cold in the middle of May.But maybe the chill came from the inside.They reached the grassy bank above the road and stopped where crumbling cement steps led down to the pavement.A chain of vehicles threaded through the sharp curve, held back by a slow moving dump truck with a blue tarp billowing over its load.The truck lumbered past, splashing the bank with muddy rainwater, then disappeared around the bend with its impatient entourage of smaller vehicles.Laura glanced behind her.Umbrellas sprouted like flowers in the parking lot as people ran for their vehicles beside the little brick church.She was glad shed escaped the small talk, but whatever Sean had to say might prove harder to handle.She looked up at him against the black backdrop of his umbrella.Lines of weariness had joined the laugh lines around his eyes.She hardly knew this grown up Sean, this somber stranger.Seeing him in a necktie took her all the way back to her dads memorial service.That was the first time shed ever seen Sean wear a tie.It was the first time shed seen him cry, too.Raised hard by a hard man, hed usually managed to hide his sorrows behind his blue eyed devilment.With one finger, he pushed a strand of hair off her cheek.You need some sleep.She shook her head.I have too much to do.I cant sleep.Me either.His gaze darted beyond her and sharpened, wary and watchful.But there was nothing to watch in that direction.Nothing but a stand of pine trees that the kudzu would swallow before summers end.A chill hit her.The ghosts she didnt believe in were breathing down her neck again.The latest rumor had Sean seeing things.Hearing things.The snap of a branch in the woods, a flash of brown in the green.It must have been a deer, foraging.But Laura hadnt heard anything yet.He could break it to her gently.She pulled away and shivered, her red hair frizzy from the damp.He tightened his arm around her shoulders.Lets get you home, he said.Her big tomboy feet in fancy shoes started moving down the steps, avoiding the rough spots.Her black raincoat flapped in the wind.Like all the tongues that were flapping.God help her if she heard the old biddies tall tales with no warning.Sean eased her to the left to avoid a long, green drape of kudzu at the roadside.Hanging from a sycamore and swinging in the wind, the vines were trying to grab a nearby dogwood and start devouring it, too.Years ago, Lauras father had shown Sean how a dogwood leaf broken in two would still have thin, stretchy filaments connecting the halves.Like strands of memory and fact that held past and present together, Elliott had said.They would hold for a while, but not forever.Hed been a bit of a philosopher, Lauras dad, but he hadnt always made sense.The mans lean figure drifted into Seans imagination, slipped across the road in the rain, and vanished among the trees.He missed the man and his music and his stories.Wanted him backalivebut wishful thinking couldnt raise the dead.A fresh gust of rain pecked at the umbrella.Sean hurried Laura across the pavement, onto the circle drive, and up to the little brown bungalow that sat on a small peninsula of land created by the sharp curve of the road.They clomped up the steps to the wraparound porch where the wooden swing had hung until Elliott busted it up.A couple of his Adirondack chairs sat there now, but nobody ever used them.Rain danced a jig on the tin roof of the porch as they walked around to the back door.Laura dug through her handbag, giving Sean a closeup view of those long fingers.The delicate bones of her wrists.He didnt like this business of keeping his distance.Respecting her wishes.Being the ex boyfriend instead of the love of her life.Hed had enough of it.She drew a shaky breath that made him want to tuck her into a comfy chair with a hot toddy and a quilt.Please dont tell me Ive locked myself out, she said, still digging.Sorry, I cant find the key.He reached into his pocket.Ive got it.She looked up.Her skin was pale, with shadows under the deep set, dark brown eyes that were so much like her mothers.You still have a key?Sure I do.Half the county has a key.Laura nearly smiled.My mom was funny about that, wasnt she?She was.Jess had been in the habit of locking herself out, so shed had extra keys made and handed them out to her friends like candy.Her personal lockout assistance service.Sean unlocked the door, pushed it open.Leaving the umbrella dripping on the weathered planks of the porch, he followed Laura in.The kitchen smelled like a florists shop, the counters and table still crowded with potted plants from the funeral.You have enough plants to stock a nursery, he said.Tell me about it.Laura slung her raincoat over the back of a chair and bent to slip off her shoes.Ill let you keep the key, in case I lock myself out again.Just like her mom.Good idea.Hiding a smile, he nodded toward a massive, foil covered dish almost hidden by the greenery on the counter.At least you wont starve.Ill bet Ardelle left that.She did.Its enough coffeecake to feed the whole neighborhood.Why dont you take some home?Thanks, maybe I will.Lord knows Im not much of a cook myself.Laura smoothed the skirt of her dress although it clearly didnt need smoothing.Hows everything going for you?Its crazy right now, getting ready for the festival.Once thats over, Ill get back to rehabbing the house.Funny, she said, leaning against the counter.Were both back in the houses where we grew upat least for a while.That reminds me.I heard Cassies in town too.A smile lit Lauras face.She is?Id love to see her.I guess Drew came too?Nope.Seems to be a solo trip.Cass didnt tell me shed be in town.Not that were as close as we used to be, but we do stay in touch.I hope everythings all right.Everythings fine, most likely.Anything new with Dale?He stops by a lot more often than Id like.Every time I hear that rattletrap truck pull into the drive, I look for an excuse to say I was just leaving.How are Keith and Annie?Theyre doing well, he said, remembering the message from his sister in law.Annie said to tell you hey.She would love to see you if you want to stop by.Laura nodded but didnt commit herself to it.The scent of the lilies on the counter reminded him of a long ago Easter morning when Laura, wearing a new dress, stood hand in hand with her dad to sing I Know That My Redeemer Lives.Elliott was perfectly on key while Laura wasnt even close.She frowned.Whats that funny little smile for?He angled his head toward the lilies.They make me think of Easter and your dads favorite songs.She studied the flowers for a moment, then met his eyes but said nothing.He loosened his tie, tugged it off, and wound it around his hand like a bandage.You must be freezing.You want to change into dry clothes before we get into this?Because what I have to say, Lauraitll take some time.She lowered her gaze to the necktie wrapped around his hand.Okay.Ill be right back.She turned and walked into the living room.Mikey, stretched out on the couch, batted a languid paw at the hem of her dress swinging against her muscular calves, but he missed.Ignoring the cat, she headed down the hall.Except for the plants all over, Jesss kitchen looked the same as it always had when Sean had stopped by for a cup of coffee and a chat.A little neater than it used to be, maybe.Her favorite mug, the pale blue one with rainbows and angels on it, hung from the mug rack beside the coffee maker.It was odd to see her possessions all around, outliving their owner.Elliotts too, years after hed drowned.Dulcimers, mandolins, and guitars still lay around the house as if hed set them down just days before.The storm attacked the windows with fresh energy, the rain gusting sideways in belts and waves.Leaves bent backward, showing pale undersides.No birds calling.Only rain, wind, and the faint tinkling of Jesss miniature wind chimes in the backyard.The storm had draped gray swags of mist over everything, but once the weather cleared, Laura would have a good view of the family plot in the cemetery across the road.But Jesss grave was still too new to have a headstone, and Elliott had no grave.Only a bronze plaque that bore his name, a line about having served his country, and the dates of his birth and death.Sean shook his head.That was a rough summer.A strange summer.He and Laura had turned eighteen that August, but their birthdays had been lost in the turmoil and ruined by his own naivet.Trying to shut out the memories, he turned around, only to face another reminder of the past.Hed sat at the Gantts kitchen table many a time after Elliott rescued him.That wasnt too strong a word, either.Nobody else would have waded into Dales fists to save a scrawny kid from another beating.Elliott took him home that day, patched him up, and turned him over to Jess for a decent meal while Laura looked on with wide eyes.Then Social Services got involved, and everything was topsy turvy until Dale landed behind bars somewhere and Seans grandma moved to town and took him in.He closed his eyes.How old had he been?Fourteen?And hungry for a father figure.Elliott had never been exactly stable, though.Or even quite sane.If the stories were truethe new stories that were spreading like a virus and the nightmares Sean had spun in his own head.But they couldnt be true.God, he whispered.A one word prayer.He figured the Lord already knew the rest of it.Laura stopped in the doorway to the kitchen.Sean, seated at the table, seemed not to notice her.While shed been changing into jeans, hed cleared a space by moving some of the plants to the floor and the wide windowsills.Drumming his fingers on the golden oak, he stared into space and frowned.Like he used to frown over her tangled geometry proofs.Once, on the porch swing, shed complained about all those aggravating angles and lines and curves in the textbook.Hed said the whole world was angles and lines and curves.Then he picked up a fallen sweet gum leaf to illustrate his point, brushed the leaf across her cheek, and kissed her for the first time.Contacts out, glasses on, she felt like that gawky, nearsighted teenager again.Sean, though, had lost everything awkward or gangly from his teenage years.He carried himself with understated confidence.With authority.He wore his thirty years well.He looked up, eyes as blue as the sky but troubled as a storm.His fingers stilled.Feel better?Warmer, anyway.I can make you some coffee.Theres always a bag of good Costa Rican stuff in the cupboard.She smiled at his familiarity with her mothers kitchen.No, thanks, but you go ahead if you want some.He shook his head, and his hair fell into his eyes.If he didnt get a haircut soon, he would look like a wild man.He ran a finger back and forth on the table.The furniture your dad made, and his mandolins and dulcimers and all, he said, circling a knot in the wood grain.They make me remember him like it was yesterday.He did beautiful work.She sat across from him.So do you.I learned from the best.But his pleasant words didnt match his worried expression.Whats going on, Sean?Whats bothering you?Sean, whod never been afraid to speak his mind, hesitated.There have been some crazy rumors floating around.I dont believe them, but I dont want you to hear them without warning.Rumors about what?He reached across the table and covered her hands with his.A woodworkers hands, like her dads, they bore a few small scars.The quiet ticking of the clock on the wall filled the long stillness before he spoke.Have you ever heard of a man walking away from his life?Just leaving?Everybody wants to walk away sometimes.How many times did we hear Cassie say that?And she finally did, with Drew.I dont mean moving away like they didlike you did.What I mean isvanishing.On purpose.Sure, it happens.His grip tightened.Half the town is saying we might know somebody who did just that.Who?Do you remember Eric Rudolph?The bomber.The white supremacist.When Laura was a teenager, the papers had been full of him and his crimes, but she failed to see a connection between him and the sleepy little town of Prospect.She nodded though.I remember reading about him.He hid out for years.Not far from here, in North Carolina.In the same kind of terrain.The mountains are like a big food locker for a man who knows how to hunt and fish and forage.He stopped, his gaze holding hers, then went on, slowly.Some folks are saying a man can stash what hell need to survive, Sean said.Food.Clothing.Tools.Hunting and fishing gear.He makes his plans.He sets up a secret camp or two, somewhere in the wild.He gets everything ready.And then one day, a hot summer daywell, some folks say a man could fake his own drowning.The words sank like heavy stones thrown into deep, dark water.The room swirled.The mingled smells of potting soil and lilies weighed on her.Choked her.Sean receded into a black distance.Laura, do you understand what Im saying?His features swam back toward her through a dark fog.Yes.She hadnt noticed pulling her hands away, but they were in her lap, twisting around and around, shaky and cold.Her head buzzed with her old theories, the wild ones her mother had scoffed at.This was different though.It was all wrong.Im sorry, Sean said.I had to tell you before you heard it with no warning.I dont know how to say it except straight out.A few people say theyve seen him alive.Not just traces of where a mans beenthough they claim theyve seen those toobut actuallyhim.Your dad.Elliott Gantt.Older, thinner, crippled up.With long hair and a beard.It couldnt be true.Nearly twelve years had gone by since her father had vanished in the deep waters of Hamlin Lake.Eleven years, nine months, and fifteen days.Shed worked it out on the long drive from Denver.I cantthatseven if its true, even ifNo, after almost twelve years?He couldnt still be alive.Exceptthe thought rolled in her heart like thunderhe fought in Vietnam.He was trained to survive.To live off the land.Do you think theres any chance it could be true?Sean shook his head.I dont, Laura.I really dont.Its absurd.But this morning I heard another rumor and decided Id better tell you before somebody else did.Whats the new rumor?The frown lines furrowed deeper into his forehead.Remember Preston from high school?She nodded.Their biology teacher, Presto Preston had a penchant for bad puns and worse neckties, but hed been a stickler for empirical evidence.He was so rational and logical that everybody said formaldehyde ran in his veins.I saw him this morning at the Shell station, Sean said.He claimed to have seen your dad crossing the road by the old church camp on the lake, just before dawn.Preston said Wait.This morning?Preston saw him?Only hours ago?Claimed to, anyway.He said hed know your dad anywhere, the way he moved like a cat.Light on his feet.But lots of people move that way.And it wouldnt make sense for him to hide out at the camp.Thered be too many people around.How long have thesesightings been going on?The stories started a few weeks ago, after youd been home for the funeral.Why didnt you call me?I didnt want to bother you with a load of foolishness.People see things all the time.Me, Ive seen Elvis.Up in Gatlinburg.She tried to laugh, but it rang hollow.So have I.  Im glad youre sensible, Laura.I was afraid youd start scouring the mountains for him.Thatd be crazy.But so was henearly.What if its all true?Ive believed crazier things.Just after it happened, I shared some wild theories with my mom.I thought maybe he nearly drowned but someone rescued him and took him off somewhere.If he was injured or had amnesia, he wouldnt have been able to reach us.What did she say to that?Laura stared at the table and relived her mothers brusque dismissal.She said I needed to stop living in a little girl fantasy and get off to college.That week, in the strange new silence that had fallen upon their house, shed decided to go to school in Colorado, not Georgia.Shed been accepted at both schools.The last minute scramble to change her arrangements had allowed her to escape everything.Until now.The rumors cant be true, Sean said gently.Ive talked to the sheriff, and he says theyre bogus.Nobody has a shred of hard evidence.Some people are taking it seriously, though.Doing their own investigations.The way he said some people made her skin crawl.Youre talking about Dale, arent you?After a moments silence, Sean nodded.Yeah.Hes got a bee in his bonnet.Whats he doing?Sean shrugged, as if he were trying to make light of it.I dont know exactly what hes up to, but the other day he said the best way to catch a prowler is to go on the prowl yourself.Of course Seans father would want to find her dad, if he really was out there.Just for the sick pleasure of hauling him in, displaying him like a trophy of war.Lauras throat was so dry she couldnt speak.Couldnt swallow.She lowered her head to the table and closed her eyes.The tears wouldnt come, but a horde of unwelcome thoughts did.She shoved them to the back of her mind so she couldnt hear them screaming at her.Chair legs scraped the floor.Sean walked around the table, stood behind her, and kneaded her shoulders while rain ticked at the windows and the bones of the house creaked.The oak table was cool and hard beneath her cheek.Her dad had built the table with his own handsthe hands that used to smooth her bangs from her forehead so he could plant a kiss there.And where were those hands now?Not at the bottom of the lake, after all?She straightened, her chest an aching lump of lead.I dont know what to do.Dont do anything.Theres no need.Wobbly and feeling detached from reality, Laura pushed her chair back, making Sean release her shoulders.She rose and faced him.His fingers cool as water, he brushed her hair out of her eyes as tenderly as her father used to do.What a way to come home.Buried your mama a month ago, and now folks would have you believe youre about to resurrect your daddy.But its not true, Laura.It cant be true.If it was true A sob tried to surface.She stifled it, tucking her chin down and pressing her lips together.Sean pulled her toward him, her bowed head barely touching his chest and keeping a space between them.A space between their hearts.You want me to stay awhile?he asked.No.She shook her forehead against his warmth, her glasses bumping against him.His shirt was damp with rain.She pulled away and plucked at his rain speckled collar.Thanks, but Ill be fine.Go home, get into some dry clothes yourself.I need some time alone.To process everything.Are you sure?Im sure.She made herself smile.His frown eased away.He returned the smile, giving her a glimpse of the younger, softer Sean whod carved their initials into an old picnic table under the pavilion across the road.Remember, its a womans prerogative to change her mind about absolutely anything.The twinkle in his eyes told her exactly what he was talking about.Aching for the freedom to change her mind, to change their lives, she could only look away and hope he would understand someday.Call me anytime, day or night.He bent toward her as if he wanted to brush her temple with his lips, but then he only gave her shoulder an awkward pat and walked toward the door.Thanks for telling me whats going on, she said, following at a safe distance.Dont take any of it too seriously, now.You hear me?I hear you.All right, then.Ill see you soon.Sean made his long legged way off the porch and down the steps, then across the road and up the bank to the church parking lot and a red pickup.She brought a hand to the hollow of her throat.It was the same 69 Ford hed bought in high school with the wages her dad had paid him.She and Sean had shared a thousand kisses in that truck.But hed sold it.When had he bought it back?When she was in town for the funeral, hed been driving a newer model.One that didnt barrage her with memories of high school and her dads drowning.A drowning that hadnt happened?She didnt want to grasp what it might mean.She leaned in the open doorway, inhaling the wet air, her ears filled with the pounding of the rain on the tin roof.She didnt let herself look at the graveyard on the hill.Sean climbed in, starting the engine even before hed slammed the door.Headlights knifed across the gray afternoon, and the truck crunched away over wet gravel.One of his brake lights was out.Hed forgotten to take his umbrella.Hed forgotten to take some of the coffeecake too.Maybe, like her, hed been thrown off balance, rattled by this strange new world where her father might yet live.She pulled the neck of her sweater higher.Closing her eyes, she listened to the storm pelting the world with rain and remembered a wet day in April when her mothers mortal remains had awaited burial under a green canopy.Green, the color of life.She closed the door and paced, her thoughts shifting like a dark kaleidoscope.Her fatherthinner than ever.Lonely, growing old, maybe half crazybut alive?Who in town believed it?She imagined folks going home from church to eat Sunday dinner and spin yarns about a Vietnam vet flipping out and hiding in the mountains.Yarns that might be true.He had always loved Hamlin Lake.It had the best fishing in the county.It was a beautiful spot, too.Bright blue water ringed by tall pines.A convenient boat ramp.And a blacktop parking lot where hed left his truck and trailer the day his little boat drifted to shore at sunset, empty.Laura dug her phone out of her purse.She scrolled through her contacts, overshot Marsh, B. , and landed on Mom.Blinking back tears, Laura stared at the familiar number.She couldnt imagine deleting it.Hardly able to read the screen, she selected Doc Marshs number.He might have some answers.Seated at a massive antique desk in his home office, Doc Marsh resembled a younger, thinner Colonel Sanders in jeans and a flannel shirt.Once the banjo picker of her dads little band, he hadnt changed much in the twelve years since Laura had left home for college.He smiled, his brown eyes magnified behind thick lenses.Its wonderful to see you, Laura.Im glad to see you too.Especially in your home, where I know there wont be any medical procedures.He chuckled.Likewise.The phone rang in the kitchen.His wife answered it and laughed.Muffled by a closed door, her cheerful, normal voice made Laura want to cry for some old, ordinary life that shed never actually had.I hope youll stay in town long enough to enjoy the bluegrass festival, Doc said.Its not often that I drag out my banjo and play with anybody these days, but I never miss the festival.I must have a months worth of work at my moms house, so Ill be there.He put his elbows on the desk and rested his goateed chin in his hands.So will Sean.Hes quite the up and coming luthier.Yes, he is.Yall havent been an item for quite some time, have you?Not since we were eighteen.Im sorry it didnt work out.Hes a fine young man.He is, but put yourself in my shoes.Can you imagine Dale as your childrens grandfather?Doc shuddered as if shed made him drink one of those nasty liquid antibiotics hed prescribed for her when she was small.Id rather not imagine.He cleared his throat.Have you stayed in touch with Gary and Ardelles girls?With Cassie at least, and she always tells me Tiggers news.Did you know Tig and her husband are expecting their second baby?My, my.And she still goes by that nickname?Yes, but only the family still calls Cassie Eeyore.Sometimes she still deserves it.Doc laughed heartily, then sobered.You didnt come here for chitchat about your childhood friends, did you?No.Laura was suddenly afraid to ask the big questions.Rain dripped outside, but its steady rhythm did nothing to soothe her.Out with it, Doc said gently.Okay.Have you heard the rumors?About your daddy?She nodded with a sad smile, remembering a college roommate whod told her an educated adult shouldnt refer to her father as her daddy.The roommate had never had a southern friend before.Doc took off his black framed glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his fingertips.Everybodys heard the rumors.Do you believe them?I dont know.Do you know if my mother believed them?He put his glasses on again.I thought this whole thing didnt start until after shed passed away.But how do we know the sightings didnt start earlier?If she knew, she might have talked it over with someone.She might have written Laura frowned.She hadnt noticed her moms journals anywhere.Making a mental note to look for them later, she went on.But Id really like to hear your thoughts about my dad.His problems.Doc nodded soberly.I thought the world of him.Some Vietnam vets get together, ride their Harleys, swap war stories, but he kept to himself.At least he never took to drinking like some folks do.PTSD plus alcohol can be a lethal combination.Youd call it PTSD, then?Im no shrink.Im just a small town family physician.But as long as you dont quote meyes, Id guess his struggles stemmed from combat related PTSD.Of course he steadfastly refused to be anybodys patient, ever, so he never had an official diagnosis.In my opinion, though, he suffered mental injuries that should have been treated as seriously and as respectfully as a shrapnel wound.Mental injuries that shouldnt have had a stigma attached to them.
