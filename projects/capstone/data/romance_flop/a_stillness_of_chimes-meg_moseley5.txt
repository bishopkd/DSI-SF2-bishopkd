Sean walked to the door and stuck his head in.Annie, he called.Im sorry I was rude.A muffled but cheerful answer came from somewhere inside.Presumably her acceptance of his apology.He returned to his chair.He wasnt feeling sociable, but he wasnt in the mood to be alone either.It was a comfort to have a brother a couple of feet away.An older brother who had his head screwed on straight.Windy tonight, Sean said, trying for a casual tone.Another storms coming.You didnt come over to talk about the weather.Nah.I came for a free beer.Thanks.Youre welcome.Now talk.But I tell Annie everything, so keep that in mind before you start.Who says Im talking?Sean propped his feet up on the railing and tried to enjoy the tart refreshment of the beer sliding down his throat.Keith sighed and settled more comfortably in his chair.Whats on your mind?Laura?Laura.Jess.Elliott.Everything.I dont want to believe those stupid rumors, but Im starting to wonder.Me too.Sean looked across the long lawn, across the road, and up to the smoky green foothills and the distant blue mountains, the colors softening as afternoon became evening.The Smokies held endless places for a man to hide, except wealthy newcomers from the cities kept crowding into the backwoods.Hundreds of new homes perched high in the mountains now, so far away as to be invisible until the sun touched the windows and turned them to fire.Every new outpost of civilization made the wilderness that much smaller.Elliott was tough as nails, Keith said.If anybody could survive, he could.Especially if he had help from a friend or two.And he had a lot of friends.Do you think it was the war that made him come unglued?Keith gave him a sharp look.How would I know?And watch what you say.Not every combat veteran is a keg of dynamite looking for a match.I know.They were silent for a while, Keith tapping his fingers on the arm of his chair and Sean nursing his beer.Nursing his thoughts.He didnt much like them.Elliott was trained to survive.Trained to kill too, and he possessed a violent temper.Whats bothering you, little brother?Sean shook his head.That childhood memory was crystallizing, getting clearer, like the moon seen through a good telescope.It was far away and always would be, but it was clear, its details distinct.The sun shining on glass and chrome and brown metal.And the water.That deep, dark water.Maybe hed imagined it, like Keiths boys imagined ghosts and haunted houses.Then they talked themselves into believing their own fantasies.No, Sean whispered.I saw it.Keith pointed at Seans beer bottle.How many of those did you polish off before you came over?Zero.And I didnt drink when I was twelve.I know what I saw.Im listening.On the verge of retreating, Sean asked himself if he really wanted to keep the secret any longer.Hed worried over it for more than half his life.Hed tried to make sense of it but he couldnt.Maybe there was no sense.Keith might be able to help him see that, help him leave it behind.Or he too might imagine the worst.Sean put the beer down.He wanted to start the story with virtually no alcohol in his system.Proof that he was in his right mind.Completely sober, anyway.Okay.First, all joking aside.Give me your word that you wont tell Annie.I love her, man; shes great, but this needs to stay between you and me.Keith hesitated.Just this once, I wont tell her.All right, then.When you went into the service, I started spending a lot of time in the woods, just roaming around.Staying away from Dale because you werent around to watch my back.I wouldnt have enlisted if Id No, you had your life to live.You didnt have to stay and baby sit your kid brother.Thats not what we need to talk about, anyway.This is what I saw.Listen up, because I wont want to repeat myself.Go ahead.Keith leaned forward, making his chair creak.I saw something very strange, once.At the lake.Hamlin Lake has seen its share of strange things.This wasnt at Hamlin.Im talking about the little lake on old man Bennetts property.Remember him?The grumpy old dude who made a fortune selling all those lake lots?Thats him.Sean closed his eyes.I was up there, in the brush above his lake.All of a sudden, there was this little brown car, blasting its way out of the woods on one of those skinny dirt tracks that led to the lake.It was heading straight for the water.He stopped, listening to the crickets and the peepers and the wind flexing its muscles in the trees.Keith stayed quiet.It slowed down some.The door popped open, and Elliott jumped out in the nick of time.The car flew out over the water and smacked into itmade this huge splash and a noise like a gun going off, almostand then it rocked, back and forth, back and forth, sort of settling.And Elliotthed rolled a couple of times and stood uphe just watched it sink.Sean stopped.You still with me?Yeah.Go on.It didnt take long to sink, but the lake kept rippling for a long time.Elliott stayed there.Absolutely still.Watching and waiting.Like he wanted to make sure the car was reallydrowned.Sean swallowed, remembering how hed worried that the car would come boiling back out of the water, raised from the dead, because Elliott had seemed to expect just that.Is that all you saw?Elliott hollered something.I couldnt make it out, though.Then he fell on his knees in the grass and cried.Rocked back and forth on his knees and cried like a baby.Weird.No kidding.A grown man, deliberately drowning a car and then crying his heart out.Like hed changed his mind or something.What did he do then?He walked back the way hed driven in.A noise behind Sean made him jump.The kitchen window was open.Annie wouldnt eavesdrop, would she?Keith didnt react though, so Sean decided he was imagining things.When was this?Keith asked.I dont remember exactly.You know how it is when youre a kid.You dont look at the calendar.You dont keep track of the comings and goings of adults, either.So Im not clear on the timing.But it was on Bennetts land?Whereabouts?I dont remember.Sean picked up the beer again.Even if I had a clue, I wouldnt recognize the spot now.Its been sold, subdivided, filled up with those fancy houses.No way could I show you where it happened.I was just wondering if we could find the car.It wouldnt be easy.They say that little lake is deep.Even deeper than Hamlin.But why would you want to find it?Why didnt you call the cops?Bennett had run me off a couple of times already.I was no good Dale Hallorans kid.Why would I call the cops and admit Id been trespassing?So Dale could pick me up at the station and beat the living daylights out of me?Keith didnt respond.Why would you want to find the car?Sean repeated, dreading the answer.To see if there was anythingor anybodyin it.Exactly.There it was again.Plain as day to Keith too.The brothers sat in silence for a long time.The beer wasnt going to Seans head.He felt clear, almost too clear, as if sharing the memory had ripped a veil from his mind.The new view was stark.Disturbing.Might be nothing, Keith said at last.Might be nothing at all.I hope youre right.Sean polished off the beer and got to his feet.Id better head home.Thanks for listening.Hold on.You havent told Laura about this?No.Why not?Well, first, because I havent told anybody about it until right now.I didnt want to face it myself.But the thing is, if Elliotts dead anyway, why make Laura live the rest of her life believing he killed somebody?What if he comes back?Then well have a whole new set of problems.Think about telling her, though, Sean.Think hard.You might even try praying.I have.Ive prayed about it for years.Ive looked for an explanation that doesnt involve crime or insanity.Havent found it yet.Im not sure you ever will.Dangerously close to losing it, Sean stood up.Youre probably right.Thanks for listening.Making his body language loose and relaxed, he strolled down the steps and climbed into his truck where he wouldnt have to pretend he wasnt crying.Nearly midnight.The wind chimes tinkled against a backdrop of coyotes yipping in the hills.Laura needed sleep, but she knew she would only lie awake and listen while a headache throbbed behind her eyelids.The kitchen table looked naked now, bereft of the plants.One legged Katie the doll lay there, literally naked while she waited for her dress to dry.Most of the stains had come out of the fabric, but the grime on her face was there to stay, the result of countless hours of outdoor play with Cassie.Laura picked up the doll and wondered if she could create a new leg out of fabric and stuffing.Someday, maybe, if she hung on to the doll.Restless, she put it down and moved into the den.There was a gap where the cedar chest had stood for years.She missed it already.The past was slipping away in fragments.Even if Seans descendants kept the chest long after he was gone, they could never know everything it represented.Property, possessions, even memories would be gone someday.A family could record its history somehow, in journals or scrapbooks or even online, but nothing was safe forever.Websites and computers could crash, and even the most interesting family records could succumb to mildew or fire.Or some great grandchild might throw precious old papers and photos in the trash, saying, You cant hang on to everything.In the long run, you couldnt hang on to anything.The pianos rack still held one of her fathers songbooks.Laura trailed her finger across the cover, a faded blue.Hed loved to sing the old ballads with Sean, their unschooled voices a perfect blend.Sometimes Sean had given her a subtle wink to accompany the corniest lines about true love.She found one of the earliest journals and curled up in the double rocking chair her dad had built of sturdy oak and upholstered in a tapestry like fabric.Wide enough to seat two, it had been a favorite spot for her and Sean when they were teenagers.But she had to stop thinking about him.She checked the date of the journals first entry and realized it coincided with the approximate time of her conception.We stopped at the perennial farm in Dville again, her mother had written.He bought me a daylily plant.Hes so sweet.Laura smiled sadly at the idea of the young lovebirds buying perennials in the late fall.The daylilies must have been in bloom by the following August when she was born.Out there in the night, the daylilies still swelled with color and life.Her mother had loved them, not because they were anything special, but because theyd been a gift from her husband.Shed never stopped loving the lilies.Shed never stopped loving her husband either.Still, Laura couldnt forget the body language in the snapshot shed taken of her parents and Gibby in front of the dogwood.If someone had taken scissors to the picture, cutting her dad out of it, her mom and Gibby would have looked like a happy couple.Just the two of them.The wronged husband might have cut himself out of the picture, so to speak, even if hed only imagined that hed been wronged.I hope thats all it was, she said softly.Mikey seemed to think she was talking to him.He jumped up beside her, blinked, and curled up in a ball against her thigh.Laura scratched the top of his head.Do you remember my mom?Do you remember how much she loved you?She loved me and my dad too.I know she did.A young cat twelve years ago, Mikey might have been snoozing on a kitchen chair when her folks launched into an ugly confrontation.While Laura fled to Cassies house, Mikey might have dived under the hutch and heard the rest of it.If only cats could talk.The nickel tour of the Halloran Building started with the elevator ride to the third floor.Even the slow moving elevator was posh, lined with dark, rich woods.Cassie leaned against the brass railing and smiled at her dad.Very nice, she said.Nicer than I remembered.Most people will never see the third floor.Ground floor?Ordinary.Second floor?Very, very nice.Third floor?He grinned.Opulence, baby.Where do you find tenants who can afford opulence?Oh, theyre around.People whove moved here from other parts, mostly.Ive already had a few nibbles on the vacancy.Is it true that Seans great greats built the place on their profits from bootleg liquor?Its partly true, he said.They had money before Prohibition.They were the bigwigs of Prospect.Civic leaders and all that.But they didnt mind sliding over to the wrong side of the law now and then to make a buck.However they made their money, its sad that Dale lost it all.Keith and Sean never got a cent.Dont worry about the Halloran boys.Theyve done all right, both of them.The sluggish elevator came to a gentle halt.The door opened on a spacious corridor with plush carpeting and more of that luxurious wood.He led her to the first door on the right, unlocked it, and flung it open with a flourish.As if shed never seen it before.It was worth seeing again, though.An ornate ceiling soared high above her head.Simple but elegant woodwork trimmed the tall windows, and a massive fireplace stood empty, its mantel sleek and graceful.Its as awesome as I remember, she said, stepping inside.Check out the view, honey.She walked to the window.The town lay before her, surprisingly large.Beyond it, the mountains rolled off to a smoky horizon.What a beautiful little town.Think you and Drew might consider moving home someday?The cost of living is so much lower here.Why keep chasing that California dream if you cant quite afford it?Cassie kept quiet.She hadnt known the California dream would cost her the dream of starting a family.Now Drew was completely committed to living there.Hed invested his heart and soul, not to mention his savings, in his business.And she was the loyal and supportive wife who would stand by him as the years ticked away.She put on a cheerful face.Theres nothing wrong with chasing dreams, she said.Like you chased your dream of being a land baron.He laughed.Land baron?Thats a stretch.I dont think so.She moved away from the window and leaned against the wall, her hands behind her back, and pictured herself living there with Drew.Enjoying the fireplace, the compact kitchen, and the gorgeous views.Her dad would give them a bargain rate.She knew he would.And it would be good to be near both sets of parents againespecially if she and Drew started a family.Her mom was having problems too.That was a separate issue, but it also pointed toward the wisdom of moving home.Have you made any progress with Mom?she asked.About counseling?Nope.She wont even discuss it.Same here.I dont want to make her mad, so I keep backing off.But that doesnt accomplish anything.I dont see that shes getting worse, though.Ive had some good talks with her about other things.I have too, a few times.Cassie frowned, remembering a conversation that had puzzled her.Can I ask you a question?Sure.He came closer, cracking his knuckles the way her mom always begged him not to.Mom said something about a call you made to sic the authorities on Dale, but then she said Never mind and clammed up.What was that all about?Oh boy.She knows I dont want her talking about that.If I tell you, promise youll keep your lips zipped?Of course.What happened?Remember the day Elliott stepped in to stop Dale from beating Sean?Elliott did the hard part.The brave part.I only made a phone call.Your mom insisted on it.She dialed the number and put the phone in my hand and stood there listening until Id said everything there was to say.Theres no such thing as a truly anonymous tip in a small town, but the authorities certainly understood it was especially important in this case.Dale already felt a bit unfriendly toward us.She met her fathers eyes.Is that how you wound up owning this building?By turning Dale in?He shook his head emphatically.No, it was just a windfall.You know the meaning of the word?Its like when the wind blows an apple out of the tree.Right into your hand.And you didnt give the branch a good shake?Not intentionally.Cassie studied her dad.Making the call had nothing to do with wanting to buy Dales building?He put his hand over his heart.On my honor as a Boy Scout, I only wanted Dale behind bars for beating Sean.So did your mom.We didnt know Dale had borrowed money against the property, and it wasnt my fault that he ended up in prison and couldnt make the payments.He lifted his shoulders in a nonchalant shrug.When the building came up at auction later, I put in the winning bid, but it was strictly business.Understand?Cassie nodded.Risky business too, he said.I had to sink a ton of money into the old dump.It paid off, though.It paid off.She nodded again.Most of his investments had paid off.A map on his office wall was studded with colored pins marking his properties.Rental homes, vacant land, commercial buildings.The Bright empire, ever expanding.It must stick in Dales craw every time he drives by, he said with a chuckle.Right downtown, for everybody to see.His name is on the building, but my names on the rent checks.I hope you never gloat about it in front of him, Cassie said.I avoid him at all costs.Ive got no use for him, and hes got no use for me.And thats that.He looked out the window again and smiled.This viewand the view from the housethey almost make me forget the years I struggled to put food on the table.Did you really?I didnt know it was that bad.By the time you were old enough to notice, we were fine.Wed never been in danger of starving, but there were plenty of times when I couldnt quite cover the bills.I had to juggle them.Id pay the light bill one month, the gas bill the next month.That gives me hope that Drew and I will survive too.Look at you now, the sole owner of the high rent, first class Halloran Building.Sweet revenge.Revenge?For what?What did Dale Halloran ever do to us?Not to us.To Sean.Dale treated him like a punching bag.Id love to return the favor someday.Ah, that ferocious loyalty.Its been there since yall were in kindergarten.You three were an unlikely crew, you know.I guess you still are.Theres Laura, the daughter of the whacked out Vietnam vet Dad, thats not nice.But its true.Then theres Sean, a nice guy whose father is the meanest, drunkest drunk in town.And theres Cassie Bright Cutler, the beautiful daughter of the real estate agent who was too dumb to give up.Im the daughter of the best dad in the world.Im proud of you.Youre pretty darned smart for a small town guy.Nah.Im a slow learner.Thank God, your mom puts up with me.Cassie didnt like turning into a big blob of sentimental mush, but sometimes she couldnt help it.She doesnt just put up with you, Dad.She adores you.You think so?he asked with a wistful smile.Its mutual.He crossed the room to the other window, the one that looked out on Fourth Street.Hands in his pockets, he started whistling.The fourth note in, Cassie knew the tune.Michelle by Lennon and McCartney.After whistling a line or two, he switched to humming, then started singing it from the beginning.The same way he always had, slightly off key and substituting Ardelle for Michelle.Ardelle, ma belle In the good ol days, hed always made the family laugh by deliberately mangling the French lyrics.Now he sounded so sad that Cassie almost thought he was crying.Nah.Her dad never cried.Laura had always liked Seans street, a neighborhood of small homes built in the thirties.The windows of his house were dark, but maybe he was out back in the workshop.She parked directly across the street, then lugged the heavy tote bag across the pavement and entered the yard.She climbed the steps to the porch and rang the doorbell.As shed expected, there was no answer.She walked down the narrow driveway that led to the detached garage and the workshop.The windows of the workshop were dark too.The sign over the door swung in a light wind.SEAN MICHAEL HALLORAN, LUTHIER.Her eyes watered.Her dad would have been so proud of him.Turning toward the house, she heard the knocking and grinding of a noisy vehicle, so close that it must have been pulling into the driveway.Dales rattletrap truck?Clutching the tote to her chest, she stepped behind prickly evergreen shrubs at the corner of the house and peered through their thin branches.A battered black pickup truck crawled into view.The engine lagged into silence.A bearded and broad shouldered man climbed out.Dale.Wearing a threadbare plaid shirt, dirty jeans, and greasy looking boots, he walked around the front of the truck and headed toward the front door.He might do exactly what shed done.He might try the back door too, or the workshop.And there shed be, trying to hide in the bushes.Elliott Gantts daughter, a coward?Yes.A lily livered coward.Dale frightened her on a level she didnt care to analyze.She peeked around the bushes.Dale hadnt pulled far into the driveway.The trucks nose was even with the front of the house.Until he left the porch, the house would shield her from view.If she could sneak past his truck to the sidewalk while he waited at the front door, it would only be a short dash to her car.That was cowardly too, but she didnt want to be trapped in the backyard.Now or never.She stepped out from the bushes.Moving as quietly as possible, she hurried down the driveway.She was still yards from the truck when Dale walked around the plantings at the front of the house and onto the driveway.He didnt see her, though.He turned, facing the house, and squinted up at it as if he were inspecting the condition of the roof.Keeping an eye on him, she kept moving.She hardly dared to breathe.When she was a seven year old tomboy playing army with Sean and the other neighborhood kids, none of them would have marched straight past the enemy like this, out in the open.They would have dropped to the ground and crawled through any cover they could find, regardless of mud or thorns.But there was no cover here, and she was the girl whose father had humiliated Dale by putting an end to the last beating hed ever given Sean.Dale turned, his gaze lighting on her before shed reached the truck.His eyes were bright blue like Seans but cold.A smile spread across his bearded face, and he started across the drive to block her path.Hello there, Miss Gantt.Hello.She halted ten or twelve feet from him, leaving some room to maneuver.You here to see Sean too?Yes, but hes not home.Too late, she wished she hadnt said it.He came closer.Chasin my son again, are you?Of course not.I see.Youre too good for my boy now?Too good for everybody?The smile curled into a sneer.Her fear turned hot but so did her indignation.Whatever, Dale.By the way, dont trespass on Gantt property again.He feigned surprise, his eyebrows raised.I wouldnt do that.Really?On Monday, I saw you pulling into the driveway of my grandparents place.You calling me a liar?She moved forward, hoping to put the truck between them, but Dales hand snaked out and gripped her elbow with shocking strength.A wave of pain rolled up and down her arm.The heavy tote bag slid from her shoulder.The strap caught on his hand and dangled, its weight adding to the pain.Let go!He loomed over her, a beer smell suddenly strong.Answer me when I talk to you, girl.Are you calling me a liar?Glaring into his eyes, she tried to shake him off.His fingers cut harder into her flesh.Like theyd cut into Seans when he was a scrawny, defenseless boy.Does it make you feel big and strong to pick on somebody smaller?she asked.Im just puttin you in your place.Somebodys gotta do it.Take your hand off me, or Ill scream like youve never heard anybody scream before, and youll be on your way to jail for assault and who knows what else.Dont forget trespassing.Big shot property owners like you have to protect their precious real estate from the likes of me.He gave her elbow a sudden twist and let go.Pain scorched toward her shoulder.Afraid she would drop the tote bag and its precious contents, she held onto it with her other hand and ran without a backward glance.She didnt care if she looked like a coward.She reached the sanctuary of her car, dived in, and hit the locks.Her arm ached and her hands shook, but she found her key, started the engine, and drove away.At the corner stop sign, she looked in the rearview mirror.The truck still stood in the driveway, but she didnt see Dale or anyone else.Either the neighbors hadnt noticed the confrontation, or they hadnt wanted to get involvedlike they didnt get involved when hed been beating Sean.Theyd left it up to Elliott Gantt.She reached over and slid her hand into the tote bag, needing to touch something her dad had touched.Something he had loved.If Sean wanted the songbooks, he would have to come get them.She wouldnt go back to his house unless she was certain Dale wouldnt show up, and she couldnt be certain until he was behind bars againor dead.When Sean ran up her back steps hours later, Laura was grateful for the unexpected cold front that gave her an excuse to wear long sleeves.If he saw the bruises at her elbow, he would go ballistic.Shed already decided to offer a censored version of events, though, so he wouldnt be able to say she was keeping something from him.It would be a very censored version.Careful of her sore shoulder, she opened the door on a gust of cold air.Come on in, Sean.He remained in the doorway, hands in his pockets and eyes guarded.Im not sure I believe the message you left on my phone.She frowned, trying to remember what shed said.Stop by when you have time.Theres something I want to give you.What do you mean?After the way you kicked me out yesterday I didnt kick you out.No?Get lost, Halloran didnt sound like an invitation to stay.Im sorry, Sean.You just make me so mad sometimes.Its mutual, sometimes.He smiled.She smiled too, and the tension dissolved.About that, anyway.Dont just stand there, she said.Come on in before Mikey runs out.He stepped inside, still smiling.Crowding her a little.His flirtatious pursuit bore no resemblance to Dales rough violation of her personal space, but it was unsettling in its own way.She led Sean to the kitchen table where shed dumped the tote bag before she collapsed on the couch in tears.These are for you.She put the bag in his hands.He looked into it and shook his head.You cant give me these.Theyre heirlooms.You know I cant carry a tune.What would I do with a bunch of old songbooks and sheet music?Dont worry.I kept a couple to remind me of Daddy.Thank you, Sean said softly.Ill take good care of them.Dont be afraid to use them, okay?Enjoy them.Wear them out.He nodded, returning the bag to the table, and then he closed the distance between them and hugged her.Blindsided, she could only hug him back.Carefully.She would not cry.The Advil would kick in soon, and her shoulder would stop hurting, and she would not cry.Sean had experienced far worse hurts.Remembering that, she let her hands absorb his warmth through his shirt.She wanted to make up for the brutality hed endured as a boy.She wanted him to feel healed.Restored.Loved.Enough of that.If she stayed in his arms any longer, hed try to take it from hugging to kissing, and shed be tempted to cooperate.She pulled away and worked up a smile.I stopped by your house with the songbooks, but you werent home.And Dale was there so I didnt hang around.Worry filled his eyes.Did you talk to him?Briefly.Now, can you humor me about something, please?That all depends.Its a small request, Sean.Just let me show you whats in the closet in my moms room.He balked, eyebrows lowered.She tugged his arm.He didnt budge, so she took off without him.Waiting for him to catch up, she surveyed the bedroom.When it came time to deal with the toiletries that crowded the top of the bureau, shed probably throw everything out.The Jean Nat, thoughher mom had worn that scent almost every day of her life.Shed said she started wearing it as a teenager and never grew tired of it.Laura picked up the tiny bottle and unscrewed the cap.The light, lemony scent engulfed her, not with specific memories, but with the very air of her mothers presence.The fragrance was like the ghost of a ghost.Hearing Seans slow, reluctant footsteps approaching, Laura capped the bottle, took firm control of her emotions, and turned around.He stood just outside the room, regarding her with the stubborn expression she knew so well.Ive found some pretty obvious clues, she said.About your dad, you mean?If he left any clues, the sheriff and his cohorts should have found them years ago.They werent looking for clues.They never dreamed it was anything but an accidental drowning.Sean, look.Laura opened the door to the small, deep closet and pulled the string dangling from a single bare bulb.Shed almost emptied her mothers side of the closet, but the rod and shelves on the right still sagged with the weight of her fathers clothes.Years of dust covered the shoulders and collars of his shirts.Sean propped himself up in the bedroom doorway, his expression skeptical.Clothes in a closet.Some clue.Which shoes did my dad always wear when he went fishing?His deck shoes.Laura pointed at the neat but dusty lineup of mens shoes under the hanging clothes.Theyre gone.Of course theyre gone, Sean said softly.Theyre at the bottom of Hamlin Lake.The pity in his eyes made her want to scream.But his hunting boots are gone too.When did he ever wear heavy hunting boots for a day of fishing?Your mom might have given them away.She might have, and she might have given away his best hunting and camo gear.The things a man would need for a long camp out.Theyre gone.How do you know?I know where he always kept everything.She made her way to the rear of the closet.Come on, Sean, get in here.He followed her in, grumbling, but he didnt take advantage of the tight quarters.Vaguely disappointed, then cross with herself for wanting him closer, she focused on the real issues.Small puffs of dust rose from her fathers hanging clothes when she ran a hand across them.For twelve years, shed never given a thought to his comfort and safety.Shed assumed he had gone on to his eternal rest.Now, though, she worried that he didnt even have a roof over his head.One warm shirt or jacket might make a world of difference on a cold night.She glanced back at Sean.His church clothes are still here, and some of his work clothes.But his camo gear is gone.Sean eyed the old wooden shelf above the closet rod.It held only neat piles of folded shirts and jeans.This house has more than one closet.And bureaus.Have you checked them all?Yes.Let me show you whats in his drawers.Sean stepped aside, letting her exit the closet before him.As she passed him, the faint scent of sawdust reminded her of her dads workshop.Of him and Sean bending over a project together, working together like father and son.Steeling herself against grief for Seans losses as well as her own, she crossed the room and opened the top drawer of her dads bureau.Hed built it himself.The drawers glided as smooth as silk, as strong as the oak tree theyd come from.Socks, she said.Underwear.Whats so significant about socks and skivvies?Think about whats missing.His wool socks.The ones he liked for hunting trips.She shut the top drawer and opened the second one.This is where he kept his long johns.I know because I always helped Mom put the laundry away.He gave the contents of the drawer a cursory look.I see some long johns.Whats your point?Theres nothing left but some of the everyday kind.Where are his special long johns?The expensive ones he got by mail order?He wouldnt have worn them for a fishing trip in August.That doesnt prove a thing.Laura, please.Be sensible.Dont live in a fantasy about having your dad back.Now you sound like my mother.She slammed the drawer shut.Its not a little girl fantasy.Its a theory.She pointed to the tall gun safe in the corner, topped with a stack of books.Lets open that thing.He folded his arms across his chest.Ill bet you dont remember the combination.Bet youre wrong.Now that shed practiced the combination a few times, she was fast.She had it open again in seconds.She swung the heavy steel door open and stepped back.Voila.The old BB guns and the .22s we used for target practiceremember those?and the antique revolver he never trusted.But what about his good deer rifle?Ammo?Knives?Bows and arrows?Whered they go?Your mom must have sold them.If she had, she would have given you first pick of everything.You know she would have.You were like a son to my folks.Maybe she just moved them somewhere.Like the garage.I checked the garage.And the attic, cobwebs and all.Oh.Everything thats missing is something he would have needed in the wild.Weapons.Ammo.Basic tools.His mess kit.His flint.The best down sleeping bag.He wasnt planning a morning at the lake.You and your mom would have noticed him taking everything out of the house.Not if he took a little bit at a time.At the crack of dawn, before we were up.You know thats when he liked to set out.Remember what you told me on Sunday?A man could stash everything hed need to survive.Clothes and food.Tools and hunting and fishing gear.I was only quoting what some other people have been saying.Maybe theyre saying it because its true.He looked at the nearly empty gun safe as if wishful thinking could make the missing weapons reappear.Youre jumping to conclusions.She moved closer, begging him with her eyes.At least admit that he might be alive.Not that its certain, not that its even probable, but that its at least possible.Sean sank onto the edge of the bed with his hands on his knees, the same tense posture she remembered from the times theyd sat with Cassie on the bench outside the principals office.I dont know, Laura.Whats your problem?Why do you only want to argue with me?I only want to help you face reality.If youre not ready, Id better head home.He stood up and walked out.She chased him down the hall and into the kitchen, where she passed him and planted herself in front of the door.Tell me whats wrong, Sean.Tell me what youre keeping from me.What makes you think Im keeping something from you?The way youre acting.Baloney.He retreated two steps.She followed, as close as a ballroom dancer.Somethings going on that you dont want me to know about.Will you at least admit that much?He was silent, not quite meeting her eyes.Thank you, she said.For what?For admitting that somethings wrong.By not saying anything.Sorry.Is that all youve got to say about it?Yep.He grabbed the songbooks, sidestepped her, and made for the door.She followed him onto the porch, into the cold evening air.He ran down the steps and climbed into his truck.With the door open, he looked up at her.No smile now.Did your folks ever own a little brown car?he asked.Brown?Not that I remember.Why?Just wondering.Good night.He shut the door.There you go again.She raised her voice, hoping he could hear her through the trucks window.Acting weird.The roar of the engine was his only answer.The truck jolted down the driveway and onto the road, where the taillights swerved and disappeared around the sharp curve with only a fleeting flare of the one operative brake light.She hurried inside, bolting the door behind her, and tried to dismiss Seans aggravating attitude from her mind.She had more important matters to deal with.Rubbing her arms to warm up, she recalled what her dad had always said about mountain weather.Just like a woman, it was beautiful but fickle, going from cold to hot and back again.A fifty degree night wasnt bad if you had a warm bed to sleep in, but a fifty degree night without decent shelter would be miserably cold, especially for a man whose clothes must have worn thin by now.Laura returned to the closet, hatching a plan.Cassie had started seeing her parents with new eyes.Sure, they were middle aged fuddy duddies who could stand to lose a few pounds, but they were good people.They cared about other people.Theyd once stuck their noses into Dale Hallorans business for Seans sake, even though there might have been serious repercussions.And if her mom showed a few signs of obsessive compulsive behaviorso what?Cassie was starting to think it wasnt a big deal.If a woman wanted to spend half her afternoon making a ridiculously organized grocery list, arranged aisle by aisle like a map of the store and color coded for different kinds of coupons, that was her privilege.Cassie propped her elbows on the granite counter and studied her moms neatly written menu.Steaks?For a little boys birthday party?Nothings too good for my grandson, her dad bellowed from his home office.No fair, she yelled back.You never bought steak for my birthdays when I was little.We couldnt afford steaks back then, Cass.Did it wound your tender little psyche?Yes sir, it did.You need to make it up to me.Buy me a new car or something.He laughed.Dont hold your breath.Her mom looked up.Seated at the table, she was searching through a shoe box full of couponsas if she still needed to pinch pennies.The steaks will be for the adults, she said.Trevor will want a hot dog.He always does.Does Laura eat red meat?Or is she like Jess?Cassie sat beside her.Except for tuna and sushi, Laura will eat just about anything.Like me.You?Youve always been a fussy eater.She smirked, thinking of Drews running joke that they should write a cookbook with a thousand and one ways to cook beans.Not anymore.I just hope she and Sean will come.Hes such a dear.Ardie, sweetheart?came a wistful voice from the office.Yes, Gary?Will you pick up some good salsa from the deli, please?Yes, darling, and Ill buy the really good tortilla chips.Thank you, my love.Ugh, Im getting a sweetness headache, Cassie said.Her mom ignored her.She added salsa and chips to her list, in exactly the right spots: Deli and Aisle 12.Wow, Mom.I just walk into the store and start throwing stuff in the cart.You could save money if you planned more carefully.Maybe theres a happy medium?Ardelle didnt answer.Tigger breezed into the kitchen, her silky blond hair swinging.She proudly wore a maternity top although she was barely showing.Trevor tagged along behind her, explaining why he needed a magnifying glass for his birthday.And so I can see my insect collection better, he said.Tigger smiled.Oh, you and those bugs.Theyre insects, Mom.Only some of them are bugs.Cassie wondered if anybody made a white lab coat to fit a kindergartner.Trevor had given off the mad scientist vibe since he was three or four and had to start wearing glasses.Hed started reading at four.Hed probably enter Harvard at fourteen on a full scholarship.Naturally, Tigger wouldnt just have a smart kid.Shed have a Boy Genius.Ardelle stood up, having finished organizing her coupons and shopping list, and cupped one hand over Tigs belly.Look at you, starting to show.You get to do that because youre my mom, Tig said with a tolerant smile.When complete strangers try it, I threaten them with karate chops.Sure you do.Ardelle turned to Cassie.I remember being pregnant with you and patting Jesss tummy and telling her she could borrow my maternity clothes once you were born.And she did.Thats wrong, Trevor said, his eyes cheerful and big behind thick lenses.A baby doesnt grow in a mommys tummy.Tummies are for food.The baby grows in the mommys loom.Womb, Tig corrected gently, keeping a straight face.Cassie grinned, glad Trevor still didnt know everything.Ardelle seemed to have missed the funny exchange.Her mind was probably on those cents off coupons.Tig and Trev, in case youre not here when I get home, give me my kisses now, she ordered.They came forward obediently, bestowing and receiving kisses, and Ardelle left through the garage to do her shopping.Wed better go too, Tig said.Trev, go get your backpack and say good bye to Grandpa.She met Cassies eyes and frowned.Whats wrong?You look unusually, um, sweet.Im thinking you lead a charmed life, right down to having a great husband and an adorable and brilliant child.Tiggers flawless face lit up with happiness.I do lead a charmed life, dont I?She rubbed her fingers lightly over her belly, like a prenatal love pat to go with those expensive prenatal vitamins shed taken for months before they tried for Baby Number Two.Tigger the Tagger.Wary of karate chops, Cassie steered clear of the pregnant tummy and mussed her sisters shiny hair instead.Like old times.Even though it irritates me to pieces, Im really and truly glad youre happy.And Im glad you are.But leave my hair alone, Eeyore.Yes maam.Walking past the table to see Tig and Trevor out the door, Cassie stopped short.After all that work, her mom had left her list and coupons on the table.Green, green, green everywhere.Kudzu would conquer the world someday, at least where the winters werent cold enough to kill it.Treading carefully through the vines, watching for snakes, Laura slogged toward the cabin, glad that her shoulder had improved overnight.The big black trash bag shed slung over her back made her feel like Santa Claus, but there was no chimney left for Santa.Except for a corner in the rear, the roof had caved in.The No Trespassing sign shed nailed to the wall looked gaudy against the rough gray wood.It didnt belong there.But neither did Dale.The signs probably wouldnt discourage him anyway, but at least shed put him on notice that she knew hed been there.With her dads old work gloves tucked securely under her arm, she made her way around to the back.She couldnt imagine anyone using the cabin as a refuge, with its roof collapsed and its plank floor rotting into the dirt, but she couldnt think of a more likely home base for her dad.Even if he never spent a night there, he might find the loot and haul it away to wherever hed been staying.If it brought him any comfort at all, it was worth the trouble.The back door hung at a crazy angle, its top hinge rusted away.She gave the weathered wood a cautious push and peered into the green gloom inside.Nothing but kudzu.She placed the black bag in the corner that still had a roof.Triple bagged, the clothes and supplies should be safe against the weather for a while.She hadnt wanted to give him a heavy load to haul, so shed brought just one of each article of clothing she thought hed need.No duplicates except socks and underwear.Shed packed lip balm too.Toothpaste and a toothbrush.Soap.A can opener and some canned goods.Since leaving the house, shed already thought of a dozen more items.From the back pocket of her jeans, she pulled out a tiny notepad and a pen.For hours, shed contemplated what to write.Shed finally decided.Dad, please let me know youre okay.I love you.She signed her name and clipped the pen to the notepad.Studying those old suede gloves, a peculiar shade of green, she wondered if he would recognize them.He might even recall that when she was little, shed loved to put them on when they were still warm from his hands.She tucked the notepad and pen inside one of the gloves and left them on top of the trash bag.She had more bags in the car, to drop off at the homeless shelter, but this bag was meant for one particular homeless veteran.He might never find it, though.She might have donated the clothing and supplies to some unknown trespasseror to Dale.She left through the broken doorway and waded through the kudzu.Back to her car, back to normal life.Except it could never be normal until she learned what had happened to her father.Laura headed up the back steps with the mail in her hand but stopped short.Mikey was sound asleep in a puddle of sun on the porch.Shed left him inside, sleeping on the couch, and she remembered locking the door.Walking past the cat, she tried the door.Unlocked.The driveway showed no obvious signs that another vehicle had come and gone while she was out, but that didnt prove anything.The ground was too dry to show tire tracks.Or footprints.Maybe someone had come on foot, in broad daylight.Her heart pounding, she opened the door partway and stuck her head in.Whos there?Dad?Silence.Of course.Shed given her word that she would call 911 if she saw another prowler.But she hadnt actually seen one.The sleeping cat was easy to capture.Holding him firmly, she took him inside, shut the door with her hip, and deposited him on the kitchen floor.Whats going on, Mikey?Who was here?I wish you could talk.He wobbled sleepily over to his food dish and started eating.Laura sucked in a breath.Shed fed the cat early, and hed wolfed it all down.Hed emptied his dish within minutes.Ardelle, Laura said.Ardelle had let herself in.Shed given Mikey a second breakfast and let him escape.Trying to squelch her irritation, Laura looked around the kitchen.The mug shed left beside the coffee maker was in the sink, and the bag of oranges shed left on the counter was missing.Ardelle always liked to refrigerate her fruit.Laura opened the fridge.The oranges were in the produce drawer.The tuna casserole sat on the second shelf.If Ardelle had lifted the foil, she would have known it was still untouched except for the spoonful the cat had enjoyed.Maybe that would hurt her feelings, but she had no right to snoop in the fridge or anywhere else.Laura walked into the den.It smelled like lemon Pledge.Some of her dads instruments had been moved, ever so slightly.Nothing was out of place in any of the bedrooms, but the carpet was freshly vacuumed.The bathrooms surfaces gleamed.She returned to the kitchen, shaking her head.Half the county had a key, but only Ardelle would have the nerve to walk in and act like she lived there.It was too much.The cleaning, the straightening, the journals packed away in a closet.Apparently the cabin wasnt the only place that needed No Trespassing signs.There was no harm done, though, and she probably just couldnt help herself.Laura filled her lungs, held her breath as long as she could, and exhaled slowly, trying to blow the anger right out of her system.She had to let it go.But then she noticed the calendar that hung beside the fridge.Shed deliberately left it open to April, the last month that held neat notes about dentist appointments and garden club meetings.Now it was open to the blank squares of May.A month ago, shed begun to grieve the loss of her mother.The future held a thousand smaller losses.No more notes on the calendar.No more coming home for Christmas and filling each others stockings with little treasures.No more swapping goofy birthday cards.Her mom had always loved the funny ones.Bonus points for finding her a funny one with a cat on it.Mikey sidled over to the door and yowled.I should, she said.I should let you out, you ugly old possum cat.I should feed you to the coyotes.But she remembered him as an orphaned, half starved kitten, taking milk from a medicine dropper held in her dads big, scarred hands.I didnt mean it, Mikey.She scooped him up and held him close.He must have been rolling in her mothers herb garden because his fur smelled like rosemary.Laura closed her eyes and rested her chin on the cats head.If shed had more time with her mother, they might have mended their relationship.Or they might have gone on as before, never daring to talk about the mysteries that drove a wedge between them.On Saturday morning, Laura pushed a shopping cart through Krogers produce section and stopped beside the white peaches.The first of the season.Her dad had loved peaches.The abundance of food brought tears to her eyes.She wanted to walk him up and down the aisles and buy him anything he wanted.Anything at all, even if it wasnt good for him.She wouldnt lecture him about pesticides or processed foods or cholesterol.All this food was so easy.Ready to eat.She couldnt imagine twelve years of foraging for greens and berries.Shooting a rabbit or a squirrel and cooking it over an open fire.Retiring to some rough shelter for the night, all alone.Seans sister in law pushed her cart around the corner, jolting Laura back to the present.In T shirt and faded jeans, her short hair tousled and her face bare of makeup, Annie Halloran still resembled a happy teenager more than a married mother of three.Completely focused on her shopping list, she didnt look up.After Laura went off to college, she and Annie hadnt stayed in touch.Annie had come to the funeral, though.Shed given Laura a long, silent hug that had meant more than a hundred trite condolences.She looked up and smiled.Hey, Laura.Hi, Annie.You dont have the boys with you today?No, theyre home with Keith.
