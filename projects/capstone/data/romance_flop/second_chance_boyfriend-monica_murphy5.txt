Luckily enough, its only T whos working with us tonight and shes too professional to be catty.But Colin considers you on probation, so one wrong move and he might fire you.I wont make any wrong moves, I reassure her.No way can I afford to.I need this job.Good.Jen smiles and pats me on the arm.I need to go check on my table.I watch her leave, wondering if she harbors some sort of secret crush on Colin.If she does, I cant really blame her.I may have feelings for Drew and think hes the most gorgeous man on the planet, but theres no denying how attractive Colin is.Hes charming, too.I can see why girls might fall all over themselves just for a chance to get with him.For a brief, shining moment, I almost wanted to get with him myself.He has a powerful allure thats hard to deny.But Im too wrapped up in Drew to want any other guy.For once, I feel relatively secure over my feelings and relationship with Drew, too.Relatively being the key word, since I dont quite know what to call whats happening between us.I need a definition.Tonight, were going to talk, Drew and I.  Im going to get to the bottom of this and figure out whats happening between us.If he so much as tries to bolt the minute I confront him with this, I just might kick his ass.The last thirty minutes go by quickly and Im thankful Drew doesnt come into the restaurant to pick me up, as shallow and silly as that sounds.But Colin is lingering around the hostess desk, his gaze questioning when I tell him good night as I head toward the door.Im prepared when he asks if I need a ride home, and I offer him a breezy no thanks as I push open the door and head out in the dark, briskly cold night.I spot Drews truck in the lot and I hurry to it, excitement coursing through me when I see him open the drivers side door and climb out.Hes wearing jeans and a hooded sweatshirt and he looks amazing.Hi, he says when I approach, offering me a crooked smile.Nice coat.Its the same stupid puffy coat I wore the night he asked me to be his pretend girlfriend.The one I hate with a mad passion, but its the warmest coat I own and its an extra cold night.I decided to forget being vain and went with the warmth factor when I slipped it on before I left for work.Thanks.I hate it, I say with a laugh, making him laugh, too.Its so puffy.It makes me look like a little round ball.It definitely doesnt make you look like a ball, he says, his gaze doing a slow perusal of me.Actually, you look like you have nothing on underneath it, which I know cant be the case.Unless Im dreaming and you happen to reveal that you really are naked under there.I shiver.Not only from the cold, but from his words, and from the heat in his gaze.Keep dreaming.Im afraid Im going to have to disappoint you.Damn.Chuckling, he grabs my hand and draws me toward him, giving me a quick, warm kiss.You ready to go?I nod slowly.I could so get used to this, my boyfriend coming to pick me up from work, offering me sweet kisses and sexy words.Then we can go back to his place and get naked together.Yeah, that sounds like a dream come true.I climb into the truck and we head to his apartment, though he does ask me if Id rather go home so I can be with Owen.I find the offer sweet but reassure him Owen is at his friends house for the night.Theyre working on a project together thats due tomorrow, and Wades mom promised me she would supervise.I really love that lady.Shes so good to Owen and to me, too.I think she knows our mom sucks and is rarely around, so she tries her best to help us out.I gave her a Christmas gift to show my appreciation, and she practically cried when I handed it to her.Are you hungry?Drew glances at me out of the corner of his eye, saving his concentration for the road.Im starving.I could eat, I guess, I say with a shrug.I dont care about eating.I could live on the high I get just being in Drews presence.Its exhilarating, having him so close, knowing hes all mine.Do you want to go somewhere?Or we could order something in.He looks at me when he hits a stoplight, his gaze smoldering.Um, like I want to draw this out any longer?Lets order something in, I suggest.Maybe pizza?Pizza it is.He reaches for me, linking our hands together.Theres some stuff I want to talk to you about.Worry gnaws at my gut and I know its written all over my face.He squeezes my hand reassuringly when I dont answer.Nothing bad about us.Its about my dad.Andyou know.I had to have an emergency meeting with my shrink earlier.I didnt know shrinks offered emergency meetings.It must be bad, what he wants to tell me.Mine is extra cool.Youd like her.She likes you, he says, releasing his grip on my hand.I miss his touch, as lame as that sounds.She does?Oh, yeah.Ive told her a lot about you.Shes glad youre back in my life.He doesnt seem too upset, which is promising.Im glad he has someone to talk to about his personal stuff objectively.If he mentioned that bitch of a stepmothers name to me, Id just want to go and kick her ass.I really, really hate her.We talk about mindless stuff the rest of the drive to his apartment.I tell him how dead the restaurant was, how long Ive worked there, how Ive made a friend.I also tell him about my breakfast with Owen and how bad he felt about punching Drew.Okay, the last part is a lie.My brother is still thrilled he clocked Drew in the jaw, but I cant tell him that.How rude is this kid, getting all hopped up over the fact that he punched my new boyfriend in the face for making my life miserable?I secretly sort of love how quickly my brother defended me, though.Its sweet.And it shows that I have reached him.No matter how frustrated I get or how often I think hes not listening to me, he is listening.He loves me and wants to make sure Im okay.Just as much as I love him and always want to make sure hes okay, too.Well, Im probably the more protective of the two of us, but Im the older one.The responsible one.I have to watch out for him.Youre a good sister, Drew says as he pulls into the parking lot of his complex.I hope your brother appreciates everything you do for him.I think he does.How about your mom?Im immediately defensive.What about her?He parks the truck and shuts off the engine.Does she appreciate everything you do?Half the time, I dont think she realizes we even exist.My voice is bitter but I cant help it.I think of her and Im filled with instant bitterness.Its like instant coffee, only worse.Shes never around.She lost her job before Thanksgiving and now shes always hanging out with her loser boyfriend instead of taking care of Owen or, you know, working.She hasnt found another job?He sounds incredulous.Its not that easy when you dont have a large skill set.So whos paying the rent at your place?Youre looking at her.I jab my thumb at my chest.And all the bills?The groceries and whatever else needs to be paid for?That would be me.He slowly shakes his head, the respect in his gaze clear.Why are you so fucking amazing?His words send a rush of warmth through me but I bat the sensation down.Im just doing what I need to do.Dont make me out as some sort of hero.Anyone your age would bail.Seriously.I dont think so, I start, but he cuts me off.I do.Youre only twenty, Fable.And you carry the weight of the world on your shoulders.You take care of your brother and you pay all the bills.Youre always working and trying your best to keep your head above water.He shakes his head slowly.I admire you so much.Youre so strong, no matter what life throws at you.I dont have a choice, I say with a shrug.I do what I have to do to get by.I could take lessons from you, you know that?He leans over the center console and cups my cheek, pulling me in for a lingering kiss.We always have a choice.And you choose to stay.Dont ever downplay that.Most people would run like hell from all that responsibility.I would.I gaze into his eyes, see all the admiration and passion and something else in their beautiful blue depths.You underestimate yourself, Drew.As usual.Fine.Ive always run away in the past.But you, Fable.You make me want to stay.Drew The minute she walks into my apartment, Fable unzips the puffy coat she hates and tosses it on the chair that sits closest to the door.Revealing a short black dress that fits her so tight, I swear I almost swallow my tongue when I first see her in it.Her body is amazing.Her legs, even though shes short, look endless, and Im tempted to slowly peel the dress off her body and do every wicked thing Ive imagined doing to her since I left her with her brother this morning.Instead, I ask her what toppings she prefers on her pizza and call in the order.After I hang up, she tells me she wants to get out of the dress and wear something more comfortable, so I offer up a T shirt of mine.She follows me back to my bedroom, her sweet scent surrounding me as she stands by my side, and we go through my dresser drawers together.When I pull the shirt out for her, I watch in disbelief as she casually yanks the dress off over her head, letting it fall to the floor.Standing in front of me in only a black lace bra and black panties that look more like shorts but are still somehow incredibly sexy, she holds her hand out and wiggles her fingers at me, indicating she wants the shirt.I hand it over, my mouth too dry to speak, and she tugs the T shirt over her head.Its old, a pale blue with a Hawaiian design on the front.I picked it up when I went on one of those shitty family vacations to the big island, and I rarely wear it since it reminds me of a time and a personId rather forget.But I love seeing the shirt on Fable.How it swallows her up the hem hits her at about mid thigh.I know exactly what she has going on under that too big T shirt, which makes it even sexier.Shes damn hot.I want her.But Im waiting, trying my best to be patient.We need to talk like two responsible adults about to embark on a serious relationship.And we need to eat, because Ive barely eaten all day and Im starving.The pizza arrives less than thirty minutes later and we eat our dinner sitting cross legged on the floor in front of my coffee table, laughing as we watch a dumb comedy movie on TV.Its a distraction we both need after the serious conversation we had in my truck.I hadnt meant to take it there, it just sort of happened not that I regret it.I hope she believed me when I told her I think shes amazing.I really do admire the way she handles herself in the face of adversity.Shes so fucking strong, and Ive felt mostly weak my entire life.Feeling sorry for myself and running from my problems has gotten me nowhere.Being with Fable, even for just that short week, changed me forever.Made me realize I can be strong.I might relapse and fall back into old habits, but being with her again is the reminder I need to keep going.Keep being strong.We polish off the pizza and the movie ends, since we came into it more than halfway through.We both realize the only thing left to do is talk and shes quiet, chipping off the bright red polish that covers her short nails.Her hair hangs in front of her face and I study it, realizing the shade is different.Your hair is darker, I say out of nowhere.She glances up at me with a small smile.You finally noticed.When did you change it?A few days ago.She focuses her attention on me instead of her chipped up nails.Promise you wont get mad?Okay, thats weird.Promise.My boss asked that I change it.He said my old color made me look cheap.Anger fills me.He sounds like an asshole.My impression of him lessens with every thing I learn about the guy.Hes really not, because you know what?He was right.Im a natural blonde, but I started highlighting my hair in high school.I kept on bleaching it and damaged the hell out of it, too.So Colin took me to a salon, had them cut off a few inches and darken the color.Now Im like a new version of myself.I liked the old version, too, I say stiffly.You dont wear as much makeup, either.I gave that up after I came back from Carmel.I was just hiding behind the eyeliner, you know.She shakes her head.Do you like the new me?I like everything about you, I say.The old you, the new you.All of you.She smiles and scoots closer to me.You say the sweetest things.I mean every word.I know.She braces her hand on the edge of the coffee table and gets on her knees, coming in so close she brushes her knees against my thigh.I love that about you.You never, ever hold back what you want to say when it comes to me.Turning my head, I meet her gaze.She used the word love so casually and it makes me wonder.Makes me remember what Dr.Harris said.How Fable should be worth the risk if I really am in love with her.And I know without a doubt Im in love with her.I cant deny it.Tell me what happened today, she whispers, her pretty green eyes sparkling in the dim light the lamp is throwing on us.With your dad.I sigh, wishing we didnt have to go there.Yet knowing its necessary to keep our relationship honest.My dad came here a few days ago to visit me.She looks taken aback.Really?Yeah.He announced that he was divorcing Adele.Her eyes narrow at the mention of Adeles name and I love that.Her immediate defense of me against the woman who irrevocably damaged me is mind blowing.That should be a good thing.It is.I blow out a harsh breath.Then he called me this afternoon and said he was reconsidering his decision.Why?He says when he went home, they sort of reconciled.I dont go into detail the way my dad did.I figure Fable doesnt want to know all of that other bullshit I wish I could forget.Can I be honest?she asks.Please do.I need her opinion.Your dad is an idiot if he goes back to her.I laugh softly.Trust me, I already know this.Why would he even consider it?She wrinkles her nose and its so cute, I lean in and kiss her there.Because shes a master manipulator and she has my dads number.Which must be sex and lots of promises that will most definitely be broken.So your dad got your hopes up in thinking shell forever be out of your life and then ruined it all by saying hes getting back together with her.Fable leans back on her haunches, resting her clenched hands in her lap.She looks ready to punch someone.And you panicked and called your psychologist for an emergency session on a Sunday afternoon.She sounds like a miracle shrink if you ask me.Sort of like my miracle girlfriend, though I dont say that.Howd I get so lucky to have not just one but two supportive women in my life?You nailed it.Im so sorry, Drew.Reaching out, she touches my cheek, her fingers gently stroking my skin.Did it help, talking everything over with her?Yeah.I close my eyes because her fingers on my face feel so damn good and I want to savor her touch just a little longer.I sense her moving closer, feel the brush of her lips against mine, as light as a feather, and I remain perfectly still, afraid to move for fear of breaking the spell thats suddenly come over us.Would it help talking to me?She kisses me again, her lips capturing my bottom one only, giving it a little tug before she releases it.Damn, that felt incredible!Last night and this morning with her had been amazing, but I rushed it in my need to be inside her.She deserves more than that.She deserves to be kissed for hours.It always helps, talking to you.I reach out before she can pull away; though my eyes are still closed, I know exactly where she is.I curl my hand around her nape and haul her in, our lips perfectly aligned, her breath hot and sweet against my mouth.Maybe we should talk more later, though.Im sort of all talked out.She braces her hands on my chest, her fingers gripping the fabric of my shirt.If youre trying to avoid a serious conversation by using sex as a distraction, I might have to protest.I crack my eyes open to find her smiling at me.Really?Slowly she shakes her hand, sneaking her fingers beneath the hem of my T shirt so she can stroke my stomach.Not really, she murmurs before she leans in and captures my lips with hers once more.We should talk.I know we should.Theres still so much to tell her.But I can hardly think when shes in front of me, touching me, kissing me.I want to drown in her.So I do.Just for a little while.I touch my tongue to hers and she parts her lips easily, letting me in.My grip tightens in her hair, pulling a little so her head arches back, her pretty neck on display.She moans and I break the kiss, running my mouth down the length of her throat, licking and nibbling the fragrant flesh.She whispers my name and the sound sends a zing straight to my dick.Ive waited for this all day.Thought about doing this all damn day to her, with her.Im a man obsessed.Maybe Her breath hitches when I bite her earlobe.Maybe we should talk a little more before we do this.Do what?I lift my head so I can study her beautiful face.Her cheeks are pink, her lips swollen, her eyes glazed.Im teasing her and she knows it.A little smile tickles the corner of her lips.You know what.She tunnels her hands up beneath my T shirt, her fingernails grazing my skin, and I shiver.Youre being a bad boy, Drew.I didnt think you had it in you.You bring it out of me.I pull her toward me and she falls into my lap, wrapping her legs around my hips.I think this is our favorite position.I know its my favorite position tonight, what with her wearing only those panties and my shirt.I can feel her heat even through my jeans, and I groan when she rocks against me.Hmm, what else can I bring out?Shes tugging at my shirt and I hold my arms up, letting her tug it off me.Her gaze runs greedily over my chest as she licks her lips and I stifle the groan that wants to escape.Shes trying to kill me.I know it.Ive missed you.Her words surprise me and by the look in her eyes, I think she surprised herself.Being with you.Seeing you.Touching you.Its hard for me to wrap my brain around the fact that were sitting here together and its not a dream.Its definitely not a dream.I touch her face.Gently trace her lips.Shes trembling; I can feel the subtle tremors vibrate beneath my fingers and I bring her lips to mine, connecting them, connecting us, for a long, quiet moment.No tongues, no passionate, out of control kissing.Just our mouths touching; were inhaling each others breaths as we absorb each other.I need this connection.I think she needs it, too.Maybe we need each other too much.But I cant worry about that now.Not when I have the woman I love in my arms, wrapped all around me.The best proof of love is trust.Dr.Joyce Brothers  Fable I enter my apartment humming.I never hum.But Im so freaking happy I feel like I could break out in song at any given moment.Considering I sing like crap, I think its safer to hum a song I heard on the radio when Drew drove me home.I can feel the smile on my lips and I brush my fingers over them, as if I can wipe it away.Doesnt work.Touching them reminds me of the way he kissed me before I climbed out of his truck.The way he looked at me when he asked if he could see me tonight.I have the day off work, but he has to go to school.Hed been ready to ditch class for me so we could spend the day together.I forced him to go, though.Such a stern, bossy girlfriend I am.The apartment is dark, all the curtains and blinds closed despite it being a gorgeous day outside, and I walk by every window, yanking open curtains, cracking open blinds.The kitchen sink is full of dirty dishes and I blame Owen, making a mental note to have him wash them all when he gets home from school.When I start down the hall, I notice my bedroom door is open.An eerie sensation settles over me, making me uneasy.I never leave my door open.Its always firmly closed.If I could lock it, I would.Its not that I dont trust Owen or Mom.Its all those jerks my mom brings over, though lately its just one jerk.And my brothers friends arent real prizes either.I remember the boys I knew in junior high.Hell, the girls, too.I was just as bad.We all stole like crazy, lifting makeup and candy from the local supermarket.Freaking stupid.Imagine my surprise when I stop in my doorway to find its my mom in my room, going through the jumble of stuff that litters the top of my dresser.Resting my hands on my hips, I clear my throat and she gasps, whirling on me with her hand pressed against her chest.Fable!When did you get home?She fans her hand in front of her face like shes some Southern belle about to faint from the wretched heat.You scared the life out of me.Good.I flick my chin in her direction.What are you doing in here?She sneers at me, the Southern belle act evaporating like smoke.No, Hi, Mom, how are you?Since when did you get so rude?About the same time you started neglecting us completely.I enter my room, already weary from the fight.My high has come crashing down and Im left facing the reality that is my shitty relationship with my no good mother.Why are you going through my stuff?I lost something.She tilts her nose in the air, a sure sign shes lying.A ring of mine has gone missing.Like Id steal her crappy jewelry.What are you trying to say?Did you take it?Why would I take your old ass jewelry?Shes probably pawned or sold everything off anyway.She has nothing of any value anymore.I dont have anything either, but I never really did.I do have a stash of tip money in my room, though.Hidden in a sweater pocket deep in my closet.Christ, youre a brat, Mom mutters, shaking her head as she starts for the door.Cant even have a decent conversation with me.You just cant barge into my room and go through my things, I call after her.She needs to know her boundaries.More than anything, she needs to know shes not welcome in here.I can, too.She turns on me, her expression indignant, her green eyes, so much like mine though a little faded and a lot jaded, blaze fire as she glares at me.This is my apartment.The lease is in my name.I own all of this stuff.I bought everything in here for you.If I want to go through it, I have every right.Give me a break.The furniture is hand me downs from relatives and friends.All the stuff in here, the clothes and the cheap jewelry and everything you see?I wave my fingers around.I bought it with money I earned.And your name may be on the lease, but Im the one who pays all the bills every month.So dont act like a righteous bitch who can take everything from me just because youre my mom.Im an adult.You dont own me.I release a shuddering breath, surprised at my outburst.I cant believe what I just said to her.Ive been holding that in for months.Hell, for years.And now Im so angry, Im literally shaking.Wheres Drews miracle shrink when I need her?How dare you talk to me like that!Mom whispers, her voice rough, her jaw tight.You are the most ungrateful child ever.Fine, if youre such a high and mighty princess who can support yourself without me, then go find your own damn place to live.Ive been thinking you should be the one to leave instead.You cant afford this place on your own and you know it.You dont even have a job.At least I pay the rent and take care of Owen.I hate her.I didnt realize the depths of my hatred for her until now but this conversation, everything shes saying, how shes acting, it all seals the deal.Shes awful.A spiteful woman who couldnt give a crap about me or Owen.All she cares about is herself.You cant kick me out of my own house.She straightens her shoulders and pushes her bleached blond hair away from her face.My mom looks tired.Old.Small and mean.Her eyes are hazy and I wonder if shes drunk.Or high.She disgusts me.I can hardly stand looking at her.YetI also feel sorry for her.Shes my mom.Only forty two years old and look at her, with her crappy life and her crappy boyfriend, going nowhere fast.Ive been scared for years Ill end up exactly like her.But Im nothing like her.I have ambitions and dreams.Im just putting them on hold until Owen is old enough to take care of himself.Go back to Larrys, Mom.Go stay there and leave Owen and me alone, okay?Do you need money?Is that why youre digging around my room?Ill give you money.Justlet us be.I go to the kitchen where I left my purse on the counter and dig through it, finding my wallet and pulling out a wad of dollar bills from last nights tip money.Is this what you were looking for?I ask her when she follows me into the kitchen, holding the cash out toward her.She snatches the money from my fingers and stuffs it into the front pocket of her jeans.I wont refuse it.Great.Doesnt even bother with a thank you.Shes a real prize.Maybe I should stick around until Owen comes home.Mom leans against the kitchen counter, trying her best for nonchalance.I know shes really trying to get a rise out of me.Again.I need to spend more time with my baby boy.I refrain from rolling my eyes, but just barely.Hes going to his friends house after school.What do you mean?I mean, hes working on a class project with his friend after school.He wont be home for hours.Im totally lying.They worked on the project last night.But I dont want her lurking around here waiting for Owen and freaking him out.Hes uncomfortable around her.Pretty sad when a kid doesnt like being around his mother because shes so removed from his day to day life.Great.So Im not around, youre not aroundwhat kind of trouble is he getting into if were all too busy for him?Stupid kid, she mutters, shaking her head.That does it.How dare she criticize Owen?Hes a child.What do you expect him to do if no one is around to supervise him?Well, where are you?she accuses.Im working!The words explode from my chest.Where the hell are you?Oh, I know, youre out drinking and doing drugs with your asshole boyfriend.Maybe youre sleeping in all day when you should be out hunting for a job?When you should be, you know, staying at home so you can be here for your son?Dont blame me for your inadequacies as a mother.Its not my fault you have better things to do.Im riled up all over again.No one else does this to me.No one.Im usually the calm in a storm.Ill rush to someones defense in a heartbeat, but I dont get worked up easily.Im also loyal to a fault.My loyalty to my mom disappeared years ago.I cant count on her.No one can.She always acts like the victim and blames everyone else for her mistakes.She cant own up to the fact that she sucks as a mother and shes lazy.So I dont mind reminding her of both.I wont tolerate your disrespect.I am your mother, she stresses.Then act like one.My voice is calm.Like scary calm.I cross my arms in front of my chest, practically daring her to step into the role shes supposed to embrace every day of her life.Knowing full well she wont.I dont need this sort of abuse.She grabs her purse from where she left it on the coffee table and slings it over her arm, heading toward the door without looking at me once.You can go to hell, Fable.She slams the door behind her and I fall apart.Justcompletely fall apart like a crying, out of control baby.I curl up on the couch and press my hands to my face, my tears soaking my palms.My entire body is shaking, Im so angry, so frustrated, so Ugh.There are too many emotions coursing through me to try to sort them all out.Ive gone from the most extreme high to the most extreme low in a matter of minutes, and my mind and my heart cant take it any longer.Despite my anger, it feels good to cry.Its a release from all the built up resentment and tumultuous emotions that have been swirling within me.I dont know how long Ive been sitting here, crying until my chest aches and my eyes sting, when I finally throw back my head, exhausted, and stare up at the ceiling.My mom hates me and I hate her.I have to reconcile that fact and come to terms with it.I need to protect Owen from her, too.I should probably get serious about finding another apartment, because I wouldnt put it past Mom to pull some stunt and somehow screw us out of living here.Theres a lot to do, but what else is new?I take care of everything and everyone.It doesnt even occur to me that I could ask for help from Drew until this very moment.One text message, one simple word, and hed drop everything and come running to my rescue.Wouldnt he?How I hate that I doubt him even a little bit.Drew Im in the midst of planning a special night for Fable when I get the call from the one person I dread talking to more than any other.Im so caught up in searching for the right place to take Fable to dinner tonight, I dont bother checking whos on the other end when I pick up my cell and answer with a distracted hello.Andrew.Fuck me sideways.The sound of Adeles voice sends icy shivers down my spine.I cant believe you answered.It was a mistake, trust me.I pull the phone away from my ear, ready to end the call, but I can hear her frantically saying my name, begging me not to hang up.Like an idiot, I bring the phone back to my ear, silently waiting for her explanation.What the hell could she have to say to me?Why am I giving her a chance to explain anything?Am I doing it for my dad?Because I sure as hell have no reason to talk to her ever again.Not after that bomb she dropped on me the day Fable and I left Carmel.Vanessas not your sister, Andrew.Shes your daughter.I close my eyes against the memory.How downright excited Adele had sounded when she made that outrageous declaration.Ive talked about Vanessa with Dr.Harris.She knows the circumstances that surround Vanessas death, my guilt over leaving her alone.How its my fault shes dead.How my affair with my stepmom might have resulted in her birth.My sister, my daughterHell, I still dont know what to believe.Theres also that underlying fear that Adele will confess all to my dad and hell hate me for what Ive done.The threat of divorce makes people do crazy things to keep their marriage together.It also makes people do outrageous things to break up their marriage for good.Adele is a loose cannon.Im scared to death shell reveal all my secrets and Ill look like the worlds worst son.The very last thing I want to do is disappoint my dad.Too late for that.Ive disappointed him countless times and most of the stuff Ive done, he doesnt even know about.Your father wants to leave me, she finally says.I crack open my eyes, stare blearily at the blurred laptop screen in front of me.I thought you two already kissed and made up.I know he went to see you this weekend.The question I have is, why?Its not like you two are close anymore.What did you promise to tell him?Did you talk about me?What did you say?She sounds panickedand completely self absorbed.Typical.We hardly talked about you at all, not beyond him explaining briefly that the two of you were having trouble and hes ready to file for divorce.I cant believe Im explaining myself to her but as sick as it sounds, were in this secret together.Both of us have plenty to lose if its revealed.Youre lying.Youre trying to convince him to leave me and I wont allow it, Andrew.Youre just as guilty in this situation between us as I am.I refuse to take the fall for it.Her voice is low, full of ice cold venom.His reasoning for leaving you has nothing to do withus.I choke the last word out.There was never any us with me and Adele.More like her dragging me under and me helpless to fight it.It has to do with you screwing around with some golf pro.She sucks in a harsh breath.Guilty.Is that what he told you?I shouldnt be having this conversation with you.Damn it, why am I still talking to this bitch?Im hanging up now.Dont bother calling me again.Before she can get another word out, I end the call, throwing the phone across the room so it hits the wall and bounces on the carpet with a satisfying thud.But Im still not satisfied.Im mad.At myself for answering the damn call and listening to what she had to say.At Adele for contacting me when I explicitly told her I refused to talk to her ever again.I broke my own rule, though, didnt I?So how can I blame her when Im just as guilty?My phone dings from where it sits on the floor and I go pick it up, dreading to see if its a text from Adele.But its not.Are you out of class yet?Despite my anger, I smile and answer Fable.Yeah.Whats up?Can you come get me?Im typing my answer when another text from her comes through.I understand if youre busy.I justneed to see you.Worry crashes through me and I tell her to give me ten minutes.Shes waiting for me at the foot of the stairwell that leads to her front door and I pull up beside her.She climbs into the truck and slams the door, staring straight ahead as if she can hardly look at me, and Im quietly freaking out.Are you okay?I slip the truck into park, my nerves doing somersaults in my stomach.Shes not acting right.A sigh escapes her and she slowly shakes her head.I got into a fight with my mom.Just now?A few hours ago.She hangs her head, staring at her lap.I said terrible things to her.Whats worse is I dont regret it.Hours ago?Fable, why didnt you call me sooner?She shrugs.I didnt want to bother you.Holy shit.Does she not get it?Id go to the ends of the earth for her after everything shes done for me.For how selfless she is, how she always, always comes to my rescue Reaching out, I settle my hand on her shoulder and give it a gentle squeeze.I cant help you if you dont let me in.Fable releases a shuddering breath and finally looks at me.Her skin is pale, her expression emotionless.Im used to doing things on my own, you know?Ive never had anyone on my side.Not really.Not Owen?He doesnt count since hes just a kid.Well, he definitely came rushing to your defense when he punched me yesterday, I point out.A little smile appears and she rolls her eyes.He was sorta amazing when he did that, huh?My jaw still hurts.I run my hand over the spot where his fist connected with my face.Im sorry.She doesnt sound sorry at all and I let it go.If she were my sister and some jackass had broken her heart, I wouldve done the same thing.Fable.Her gaze jerks to mine once more.I want to be there for you.Always.I know I havent proven myself to you yet but I will.I swear.I want to make a promise to you.She clears her throat, looking nervous.What sort of promise?Reaching across the center console, I grab her hand and lace our fingers together.No matter what, from this day forward, Im here for you.You need me and Ill come running.Her lips part as if shes going to say something, but then she presses them together with a wince.I want to believe you, I do.But Im afraid youll leave me again.And I dont know if I could take that.I squeeze her hand tight.What can I do to prove to you I wont leave?Tell me.Ill do it.Youll do anything?Anything.I nod furiously, my heart aching.If she rejects me, Ill lose it.But Ive also asked for it.Shes fragile right now.Me walking back into her life, the fight with her mom, her worry over her brotherShe takes on so much.Theres only so much a person can handle before she reaches her breaking point.She releases a harsh breath.I want to pretend we have a normal, fun relationship.No worries, no stress.I want to forget about my mom, how Im going to pay the bills, where Im going to find a new place to live Wait a minute.I cut her off.Youre looking for a new place to live?Ive thought about it, she admits.The rents a lot here since its a three bedroom and my moms never there.She uses our place for storage more than anything.I want to find a cheaper place for just Owen and me.My mind is spinning with ideas, all of them involving Fable and her brother moving in with me.Shed laugh in my face at the suggestion.Weve been back togetherif you could call it thatwhat?A couple of days?No way would she move in with me.But I dont want to worry about any of that right now, she says firmly as she pulls her hand from mine.She waves it in the air, as if dismissing all of her problems with a flick of her fingers.Im sick of worrying and being stressed out over money, what Owens doing, if hes getting good grades, if hes lying to me.Worrying about my mom and what shes doing and why she hates us so much.She doesnt hate She hates us, Fable repeats, interrupting me.She hates me especially.Were a burden to her.If she could make us disappear, she probably would.Damn.We always focus on my problems, but shes just as much of a mess as me.Her mom sounds like a world class bitch.Forget about her.I am.She smiles, but it doesnt quite reach her eyes.Let me pretend for just a little while were normal.That we dont have issues and secrets and problems, that our lives are easy and were just two people who are falling for each other.Ive already completely fallen for her.I thought she felt the same way.If thats what you want, Ill give it to you.Ill give you whatever you want.The smile grows, lights up her eyes.Theres my girl.Thank you, she whispers.Unable to take it anymore, I touch her.Thread my fingers through her hair so I can cup the side of her head and bring her lips to mine.Why are you thanking me?Thank you for getting me.And for wanting to make me happy.She closes her eyes when I kiss her and I study her face, her thick eyelashes, her tiny nose.Were probably avoiding the inevitable, but Im tired of dealing with the heavy stuff.Im jealous of people without problems.Everyone has problems, I point out.She opens her eyes.As heavy as mine?As heavy as yours?Point taken.Ill never forget the things you said to me.Not because they mattered, but because they made me feel like I did.Unknown  Fable Drew made good on his promise.From the moment we agreed wed pretend for a little while that were just two normal people in a new relationship, thats exactly how hes treated me.No mention of my mom, his dad, Adele, our problems, our past.Nothing.Weve spent the last twenty four hours together doing nothing but talking.And kissing.Lots and lots of dreamy, long, and delicious kissing.Which of course leads to touching, and then that leads to sex.Lots and lots of sex.We havent left his apartment since he came to pick me up.I called to check on Owen and made sure he was okay.Again, he was at Wades.He asked if I was with Drew and I told him yes.He proceeded to both cheer me on and warn me.Owen loves the idea of me being with a football player.He hates the idea of me being with a guy who broke my heart.Hes conflictedwe all feel that way, I think.But I pushed the conflict aside and focused on the positive.Drew with me.Over me.Inside me.Whispering hot words in my ear when he pulls me in close.How he touches me so reverently, the way he holds me when we sleep.Not that theres been much sleep going on I was able to trade out my shift today so I could spend one more full day with Drew, but tomorrow, reality waits.He has to go to class.I have to spend time with Owen before I go to work.Drew has to meet with his shrink.Sometimes, I really hate reality.Being with him constantly like this, I cant concentrate.Since hes walked so completely back into my life, Ive been in a constant state of arousal I cant control.I have never been soneedy.I look at him and hes all I can think about.Funny how I believed for a fleeting moment that I was interested in Colin.The way I feel for Drew cant compare to any glimmer of attraction Id had for Colin.Were at a restaurant now, Drew and I.  He ran out of food in his apartment and we were starving, so we finally made our escape.Plus, I thought it might be good to be out in public like real people versus naked and rolling around in his bed all day and night.Staring at him from across the table, I realize pretty quickly that being out in public like real people is totally overrated.What do you want to order?His head is bent, his dark hair tumbling over his forehead as he peruses the menu.I wonder when he last got a haircut.I like it long.Its easier for me to run my fingers through and grip when I kiss him.I dont know.I sound breathless, I feel breathless, but he doesnt notice.He props his elbow on the table, absently scratches his temple with his index finger, and I remember exactly what that index finger did to me earlier.How he circled my nipples with that finger, how he slipped it between my legs, drenched it with my wetness, and then brought it up to his mouth, licking it, tasting me, his gaze never leaving mine Im squirming in my seat like some sort of horny freak.And the man is clueless.I thought you said you were hungry.He glances up, his gaze catching mine.What are you in the mood for?You, I want to tell him, but jeez.I had him not even an hour ago.Whats wrong with me?I go without Drew for a couple of months and now I act like I need him every minute of every day.I dont know.I open the menu to check out my options.Ive never eaten at this restaurant.Its close to Drews apartment and Im rarely in this part of town.Whats good here?Fable.His deep, quiet voice makes me glance up and I find him watching me, his dark brows drawn, a little frown curving his mouth.
