One thing about Molly, she didnt play coy.Would she take Phil back now?Or more to the point, would she let him manipulate her into believing he wanted her back?Would she let him use her again, savage her feelings again?Probably.Molly and her ex looked pretty damn cozy from where Quinn sat.He executed a two point turn to nose onto the road, then stuck his head out the window.Hey, Phil.Give my best to Ben, will ya?Phils eye twitched.Ben who?Ben who?Ben Curran, you big kidder.Your cousin.First cousin on your mothers side, am I right?The guy who replaced me.Inexperienced and more than a little incompetent, from what I hear.And then, as if he hadnt put a fine enough point on it, he added, Hes the reason you fired me.You remember Ben.Phil looked like he didnt want to.Molly appeared more resigned than distraught.If shed shed one tear, if shed silently pleaded with that expressive face of hersif she looked like she gave a damn!he might have stayed and fought for her.He might have insisted she get in the car and leave with him.But she didnt.Quinn gunned the accelerator and reached for his road map.Eight   MOLLY WATCHED THE butter yellow Mercedes disappear around a curve in the road.Hell be back.He just needs some time alone.Hell come back to me.She realized all her concentration had been centered on Quinn when she suddenly noticed things she hadnt before.Such as a pressure on her shoulder that turned out to be Phils arm.She promptly stepped away from him.Did you really threaten to blacklist Quinn?It was no threat, Molly.First thing tomorrow morning Im working the phone.She sighed.Well, you have to do what you have to do, I guess.Its your way to respond with aggression, and I understand that.I admire your understanding nature, Molly, I really do.Thats the difference between me and Quinn.Oh, there are so many differences between you and Quinn!I didnt realize that before, but now I do.Well, better late than never.Although I suppose I shouldnt be surprised that you were attracted to someone who reminded you of me.After everything we shared.He edged closer and she smoothly sidled away from him.You know, speaking of working the phone, she said, Ive been kind of burning up the long distance wires myself lately.Dont worry, I used my credit card.They wont show up on your bill.Oh, that wasnt necessary.Phil smiled magnanimously.Well, I dont want to take advantage, you know?As he started to reach for her, Molly turned and gingerly made her way barefoot through the poison ivy studded minefield of a yard to the ancient rusted swing set.She perched on a cracked plastic swing and began to lazily rock herself.The sun caught something bright on the ground.Are those your keys?she asked.Uh, yes.If you wouldnt mind tossing them to me.Theyre, like, right in a patch of poison ivy, she said.I do mind.Then just leave the damn things.She pitied the families with young children who reserved this house for their vacation only to discover that the decks were dangerously rotted, the swing set was falling apart, and you couldnt toss a Frisbee around without risking a bout of poison ivy.Shed spoken to Phil about it so many times.Hed always yessed her to death with false promises of fixing the place up.Talk about penny wise, pound foolish!He stood some distance away in the dirt at the edge of the yard, eyeing it as if it were a moat stocked with giant squid.So.Mind if I ask who youve been chatting with long distance?Anyone who might be hiring a copy editor.Ah.Any nibbles?As a matter of fact, yes, she said.You know Randall Harkin?Randy Harkin.Sure.Editor in chief of Advertising Today.She beamed.Gosh, you know just about everyone in the industry, dont you?He puffed up.I didnt get where I am by burying my head in the sand.You can say that again!Randy thinks your whole professional career is, like, so fascinating.He does?You two talked about me?Did we talk about you!She chuckled.We hardly talked about anything else!Phils eyes lit with excitement.I havent been profiled in Ad Today in years.Maybe Ill give Randy a call  Save your quarter.Its a done deal.And Im not talking any measly one column profile either but a whole dang feature article!I convinced him you were newsworthy.She buffed her nails on her T shirt.What do you think of them apples?Phil stared at her in slack jawed gratitude and even took a step toward her before leaping back out of the moat.You did that?For me?She gave him her most angelic smile.Hey.Its the least I could do after all youve done for me.So whos writing the article?She preened.Youre looking at her.You?He hired me!What?he said.Over the phone?No no.We met.Turned out he was coming up to Nantucket the weekend before last, so I asked if I could meet with him there.Quinn drove me to Hyannis Port and I took the ferry across.Randy is such a nice guy, Phil.Did you know hes some kind of champion deep sea fisherman?We took his yacht out and he caught this humongous  Wait.Back up.Youre writing the article about me?Its already written.Randy hired me as associate editor, but Im free to pitch articles, too.Oh, and guess what I found out when I called around.Just about everyone pays way more than you do!How about that?They could learn a thing or two from you about trimming costs, huh?His mouth worked soundlessly for a few moments.Dont you want to know whats in the article?she asked.Come on, I know youre dying to ask me.Well.Uh, I imagine it chronicles my long history in the business, my award winning  Molly waved away such prosaic details.Thats the public Phil Owen, the Phil Owen everyone already knows.I thought the readers would be interested in the real you.The man behind the marble desk and the designer suits.An insiders perspective.You know.Phil stared at her for long moments.His eyes widened.What have you done?The last minute, one sided prenuptial agreement.The blatant nepotism.Some of your more, shall we say, innovative business practices.Theyre all in there.Plus a whole bunch of revealing quotes.I did phone interviews with a lot of people youve dealt with over the years and they were all real enthusiastic about sharing anecdotes.And best of all?Check it outyouve got the cover!Randy, like, flipped over this article!Phils eyes bulged.His color spiked alarmingly.Molly was thankful for the poison ivy separating them.He muttered, He put you up to this.Who, Quinn?Nope.He knows about the job but not the article.I have my own reasons for keeping it to myself.Though I did get my inspiration from a comment he once made about an open letter.Phil pulled himself up.Pointed a finger at her.You are going to kill that article, Molly.Okay.He blinked.What?Theres still time to pull it.If youre sure thats what you want.He sagged in relieffor about a second before his eyes got that squinty, suspicious look.All right, how much?She slapped her thigh.Now, see, Im not surprised you assume this is about money.Youve always had your eye on the bottom line.I ask you, is it any wonder youre at the top of the food chain?Cut the crap, Molly.What do I have to do to kill that tell all piece?Its not what you have to do, its what you have to not do.Namely, not sabotage Quinns career.Which I know deep in your heart you really dont want to do.She saw him thinking about it, saw him looking at her as though shed evolved from her original spineless state into some kind of unfamiliar vertebrate life form in the space of one short month.What can I tell you?Ive never been in love before.Phil crossed his arms.Theres no article.No job at Ad Today.Youre bluffing.Laughter burst from her.Bluffing?Me?I cant bluff!Just ask your brother.Phil took a deep breath.Very well.I wont make those phone calls.I wont interfere with Quinns career in any way.You have my word.And that means so much to me, your giving your word like that.But you know, sometimes people forget what they gave their word on, and I know youve been the victim of that kind of memory loss in the past, so Im going to keep that article on file.And update it on a regular basis.Just in case.In truth, Molly had no desire to destroy Phils reputation.Shed assumedhopedthe piece would remain unpublished even as shed pitched it to Randy.Its sole function was as an insurance policy in the event Phil did indeed threaten Quinns career.It had served its purpose.You know, now that I think of it, she said, there is something you have to do.One eyebrow rose questioningly.Fix this place up, she said.I mean really fix it up, inside and out.And hire a weekly gardening service to make sure anything growing around here is safe to walk on and play in.Just think.You get this place shipshape, you can charge much more than your usual six seventy five per apartment per week.Howd you know He cut himself off.I put in a call to the local realtor you use.Sylvie was so surprised to learn how much youd charged me.She wants to have a little chat with you, I think.Nice lady, Sylvie.Did you know her aunt Thea was Elviss manicurist?I assume thats the next item of extortion.Phil sounded drained.A refund of your rent.Gosh, thanks!It honestly hadnt occurred to me, but since youre offering, why not?She wagged her finger at him.Admit it.You feel better already knowing youre making things right.No.Was it bluster or was he really that cold?I hope you do someday, Phil.I believe theres more to you than you let people see.More...I dont know, more humanity.He looked at her with something akin to awe.You really do believe that, dont you?After everything.Ive had a few glimpses of the real you over the years.She smiled sadly.You cant convince me it was all an act.He shook his head in wonder, and she saw a little of that humanity peek through.I really screwed things up with that prenup, didnt I?Its just as well.It wasnt meant to be.No.I suppose not.He studied the yard around the swing set.Ill get a lawn service out here ASAP.As for the rest of it...He looked at the dilapidated house.Ill start calling around.Im going to Kenya on safari next week.Ill try to get all the repair work lined up before I go.Phil didnt glance her way again as he strode toward his BMW.Youve read the lease.Ill expect you out of here by noon on the thirty first.Nine   MOLLY FINGERED THE tiny scrimshaw charm hanging on a short gold chain just below the hollow of her throat.She imagined she could feel the delicate image of a swan etched into the surface.Thank you for showing me the swan, Quinn had said that night on her deck.Thank you for showing me what it feels like to be in love, she thought.Even if it couldnt last.Even if he didnt return her love.It was July 31, nearly 1:00 a. m.  Molly had packed what she could.Last minute items such as her bedding and toiletries would have to wait.She had to be out of the house by noon.Her friend Claire, whose boyfriend lived in Boston, had given Molly a lift to the Cape on one of her trips to visit him.
