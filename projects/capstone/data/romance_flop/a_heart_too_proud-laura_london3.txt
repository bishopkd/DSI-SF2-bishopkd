Twice, said Christopher, regretfully.Only twice.But then Jeffrey didnt hit it at all.But I did hit the bulls eye in entertainment terms, Princess.Squire Macready is having a ball this weekend and your humble servant here is going to escort you.Banbury tales wont mend torn sails, I remarked tartly if obscurely.The Macreadys would never invite me into their sacred portals.Why, the squire wont even let us in to see his thoroughbredsprobably thinks well contaminate them with our vulgar peasant ways.Christopher grinned and pulled from his pocket a card of invitation, addressed to me.The envelope was perhaps a little shopworn from such a close acquaintance with the inside of Christophers pocket, but the contents, in an elegant gilt scrawl, confirmed Christophers words.I was bereft of speech.I cant understand it, I said, studying the invitation with awe.The Macreadys social ambitions were the byword of the village, and I could readily understand what a social triumph it would be for them to have Lord Dearborne and Christopher on the guest list.I could well imagine that the marquis would become Dear Lord Dearborne to Mrs.Macready and that for months to come she would regale her friends with the story of his visit to her house.But why had she felt impelled to include me in the invitation?I sighed and decided impelled was probably the right word.Christopher looked like a mischievous kitten climbing a curtain.I wondered if this was part of his plan to show me that I was not nobody.I folded the invitation, stuffed it resolutely inside my tight sleeve for safekeeping, and looked up at Christopher.Theres no purpose to discussing it further because it will come to nothing anyway.There are a million reasons why I cant go to this ball, I pronounced dampeningly.Fiddle said Christopher.Name two.I have nothing to wear and I dont know how to dance.Paltry details.Ill teach you how to dance.Tolerable dancer, mself, not wishing to boast, boasted Christopher.And are you a tolerable dressmaker, too?I can barely sew a hem.Forget making a new ball dress.Well, you can forget making a new ball dress, Christa retorted.Lord Dearborne came back from London last night and what do you think he brought with him?Trouble!I said shortly, my encounter with the marquis fresh in my mind.I saw Christas eyes widen and hastily turned the subject before she could seek elaboration on my remark.I hope that hes brought a new cook.Poor Mrs.Goodbody trembles at the thought of cooking for Lord Dearborne.Well, he did bring a new cook, but thats not all.Our new clothes are here; Robert carried the trunks over to the cottage this morning and Mrs.Goodbody hardly knows where its all to go.Its beautiful stuff, too.Mrs.Goodbody says you can tell its made in the finest shopand there are good dresses made of real silk!Think of it, Lizzieyou and real silk.Christa paused for a moment, apparently overcome by the power of her vision of me in real silk.I suppose that these revelations should have made me feel more grateful to Lord Dearborne.But I remembered his curt tones and the fingers that could be so gentle one minute and hurtful the next.Did he think that because he gave me dresses he had the right to insult me?Startled sheep still rankled.The less I saw or heard of Lord Dearborne, the better for my peace of mind.Right, sweet, youve given two reasons for not going to the ball.You said there were a million reasons.What are the other nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety eight?said Christopher.How did you say all that without one stumble, Kit?Hidden talent.No need to worry bout how to go on at the ball.Ill stick close to you and play the mentor.Dont be obstinate.I was hoping that youd talk me into it.I was laughing now.All right, mentor, I have complete faith in your ability to prepare me for any situation that might arise at a ball.Such touching navet, Christopher said, chucking me under the chin with his fist.Msister would be horrified if she knew Id taken it pon myself to ready a young girl for her come out in society.Christopher was true to his word.That week, the lessons I received from him would have done credit to the strictest duenna.In fact, it did cross my mind that there was quite an astonishing scope to his knowledge of feminine behavior.Once, as he was teaching me the stops in a quadrille, he told me: Lords sake, Lizabeth, dont bend over so far.Your gown will gape so at the bodice that people will see clear to your waist.Christopher Warrington!I said, shocked to receive this sophisticated tip.Where did you ever?I mean, how do you?You know, something like that would never have occurred to me.Dont know how I know, must have heard about it somewhere.His eyes twinkled.And course I know that it would never occur to you.Thats why I told you, mdear.A greener girl Ive never met in my life.By Friday night, Christopher was so pleased with the progress of my dancing lessons that he pronounced me graceful enough to please the severest critic.Of all the bouncers!Just after I trod on your toe, too, during the last country dance we practiced.And you know that half the time I forget the steps and wind up curtseying to the wrong side.Dash it all, Elizabeth, youre so lovely that there aint a fellow alive whod notice if you dance the whole set standing on his instep.He grinned.Oh, dont color up so.A girl must allow one compliment per dancing master, at least.As for the trunks of clothes that came from London, I can only say that they contained a wardrobe of which the most stylish young London lady would be proud and, yes, my silly Christa was able to gaze at the spectacle of me in real silk.To me, the cheerful donner of many a hand it down and make it over, this was heaven.I wont describe all the dresses that arrived, though; what could be more tedious than a catalogue of someone elses wardrobe?I thought of seeking out the marquis to thank him for the outlay of what had obviously been a very generous sum of money; but somehow, I couldnt.What if he tried to touch me again?Perhaps I should have slapped his face, that morning in the library.Christa, an avid novel reader, had once assured me that was the proper treatment for overly familiar gentlemen.Wryly, I remembered the strength in Lord Dearbornes grasp, the bright hostility of his gaze.Had I slapped him, I dont doubt that he would have retaliated in a very unpleasant manner.I decided against thanking himMrs.Goodbody had already done it once and he would probably just treat me to the rough side of his tongue anyway.The night of the ball arrived too soon.I was to have more attendants to prepare for that night than Queen Caroline needed on the day of her wedding.Actually, it was only the twins, Mrs.Goodbody, and Jane Coleman, but Janey and Mrs.Goodbody were so solicitous and attentive, and the twins were so wild and underfoot, it seemed as though I were getting ready in a marketplace.Four times Janey tried to put my hair up before she was satisfied with the effect.The first three tries looked as though I had a recent narrow escape from a pack of head huntersnot that they would have wanted a head looking like that.Yet with all the trouble of getting ready, I was set to go a full ten minutes before Christopher was to call for me.The assembled multitude had chosen a gown for me from the London arrivals which they deemed appropriate for a country ball: a willowy creation of coral pink sarcenet with tiny puff sleeves and a narrow buoyant skirt trimmed in a double pleating of winter white ribbon.Caros contribution was a pair of white rosebuds from the garden to ornament the low bodice.She forgot to excise the thorns from the sprig and I was nearly maimed for life.I wondered if this was what they meant by the hazards of fashionable life.Too agitated to await his arrival, I ran up to the manor to show Christopher my finery.Roger, Lord Dearbornes valet, met me at the door and, after paying kindly tribute to my new gown, informed me that Master Christopher could be found in the library.I tripped excitedly down the hall and pirouetted through the door.Christopher was standing by the window; his mouth dropped open when I entered.I saw it.I was silly with excitement.Oh, Kit, I had so much fun getting ready.You should have seen the first way Janey did my hair with the topknot askew and hanging over my right shoulder.Isnt this gown a dream?And look at this, real satin gloves.But do you think this bodice shows too much of my bosom?I recall that you said when women bend over that they Christopher was laughing and at this last he raised delightedly scandalized eyebrows and clapped one hand over my active mouth.I can see one area Ive definitely neglected.Thats one thing you cant talk about in public and I hereby declare this public.Now make your curtsey to Uncle Nicky; no young lady on her social debut should omit her courtesies to a marquis.No, sweetheart, hes right behind you.Wont she make the ladies go green, Uncle Nicky?Uncle Nicky?Christopher had pulled me around to face Lord Dearborne before I knew what was happening.The marquis was regarding me through eyes as critically slitted as Kits were openly admiring.I wondered if he disapproved of Christophers taking me to the ball; perhaps he thought I should have stayed put in my cottage like a good little milkmaid.Both Christopher and the marquis were dressed in fine evening clothes, worn with the natural confidence of the wealthy and well bred.Christopher looked almost as much an Adonis as the marquis.I felt like a dandelion in a daffodil garden.No need to take your lip between your teeth like that, infant, I wont eat you, Lord Dearborne drawled, coming forward to take my hand.Lord, yes, Elizabeth.You look as if Id suddenly grown a pair of horns and a tail, Christopher said.Im sorry, Kit, its just that I never thought that you were good looking before.Now what have I said to make you go into whoops?Christopher Warrington, if you dont stop laughing at me this minute, Ill stab you with one of the thorns from my rosebuds.Ive learned to be wary of young ladies with thorns in their rosebuds, said Christopher, with a wink at Lord Dearborne.Im a wretch to tease you, Elizabeth, but you see its no secret to me that youve never paid attention to the way I look, one way or the other.And now, to my chagrin, you do notice and disapprove.He made a mock sad face and held out his arm to me.Well, then, since youre not disposed to admire me, I might at least have the honor of escorting you to the coach.Theres no quicker way of putting Uncle Nicky in a temper than to keep his horses waiting.Thus I left for my first ball.The setting sun played through the curtains of the carriage, glazing the cranberry velvet of the interior with a deep red fire.I was sitting next to Christopher and the marquis sat across from us.I felt the sun hit the side of my face and it was a touch too bright, so I turned a little from it.The velvet, as velvet will, made a change of color when rubbed the wrong way.To pass the time, I tried writing my nickname in the pile.L I Z shone in the sun.When I raised my eyes I saw the marquis looking at me.I turned to Christopher and said hurriedly: I expect there will be many people there tonight Ive never met before.Does meeting new people make you nervous, mdear?No o.  Well, perhaps it does sometimes.It depends on how they act toward me.Janey said that Mrs.Macready hired extra help from the village because she was having houseguests.Did Jeffrey tell you who they were?Godfrey Woodman, for one.Hes a friend of Jeffreys.Fancies himself a poet.Lady Doran stays there as well.Did you know that she is some sort of cousin to the squires wife, Uncle Nicky?I believe they have mutually discovered a family tie, agreed Lord Dearborne drily, relaxing against the coachs seat.Ive seen Lady Catherine once before, Kit, I said.She came to Barfrestly in this very carriage.Of course I didnt know that she was Lord Dearbornes betrothed until later.And this carriage.I never thought that I would ride in anything like it or wear such lovely clothes or go to a real ball.Its just as though I were a real lady.Christopher frowned.Back up a little, Elizabeth.Figuratively, I mean.What did you just say?Um, about being like a lady?You are a lady, sweetness.Before that.I said I never thought Id ride in a carriage like this.Before that, pursued Christopher patiently.Did you have too much wine at dinner, Kit?I was talking about Lady Catherine.I said I hadnt known that she is Lord Dearbornes fiance.Right, approved Christopher.Wherever did you get a foolish idea like that?Shes no more Uncle Nickys fiance than she is mine.Mrs.Blakslee said, when Lady Doran and Lord Dearborne stayed at the inn that she I stopped.Lord Dearborne was regarding me with a fascinated air and Christophers hand flew to his brow.Perceiving that I had erred grievously, I tried lamely to correct my mistake.I mean, since she was staying at the same inn as Lord Dearborne I thought that meant they were engaged to be My voice trailed off into unhappy silence.I think that I remarked earlier that I am the worlds worst sinner.Some people gossip like magpies in the morning and never fare the worse for it, and I hear one snippet of scandal and blurt it out in the presence of one of the parties concerned.First Mrs.Plumford and now Mrs.Blakslee.The Marquis of Lorne tipped his bicorne to the back of his head with the tip of his cane.The village goodwives should take care who is listening before they let loose with their on dits.Kit, I salute your courage in endeavoring to shepherd this lamb through the weedy pastures of society.Careful her bleat doesnt bring the wolves down on you.Christopher grinned at his guardian.My lamb will melt the heart of the hungriest predator.Perhaps she will, returned the marquis, lightly.He reached out his hand to give one of my springy ringlets a good humored tweak.Keep a guard on your artless tongue tonight, my pet.Discretion is a valued accomplishment.The smile that accompanied his words was so attractive that I began to understand the reasons behind Lady Catherines midnight ramblings at the inn.The rest of the ride was spent with Christopher regaling me with anecdotes about the many elegant horses that were, he assured me, stabled at Lord Dearbornes principal estate in Sussex.Upon learning that I had never so much as sat on a horse, he promised that he and Uncle Nicky would procure suitable animals and teach my sisters and me to ride.Gratified though I was, I dismissed his promise from my mind, thinking that it was mere civility.How much I underrated Christopher.Walking through the squires ridiculously overdecorated hallway, I clutched Christophers arm a trifle tightly.The squire and Mrs.Macready came forward to greet the marquis and Christopher with the same gobbling enthusiasm a pair of tom turkeys might bestow on a fresh scattering of grain.I was perfectly satisfied, not to say relieved, with the degree of tepid courtesy in the Macreadys welcome for me.I had never quite convinced myself that Christopher hadnt forged my invitation.Jeffrey Macready broke away from a chattering crowd of well scrubbed, tony young people and bore Kit and me off to join them.I was introduced to so many people at once that I didnt absorb their identities, though some of the names were familiar as local land owning gentry.I was gratified with their friendly acceptance of me, but wondered if it was just good manners or if Christophers introduction of me was entre enough.After a few minutes of conversation, the musicians picked up their instruments and the dancing began.The room whirled around in the soft yellow candle glow as about thirty couples performed.Jeffrey claimed my hand after Christopher and, later, in the most gallant fashion, several of Jeffreys friends asked me to dance.The music made time pass alarmingly fast; I was afraid the sparkling melodies would be over before I had time to savor them fully.Dancing, listening, exchanging smiles with my partners, I wished it would all last forever.Once Christopher passed me in a movement of the dance and gave me a wink and nod.I saw, far on the other side of the ballroom, Lady Doran and the marquis dancing together.They made a stunning couple.Lady Catherine was wearing a gown of clinging silver silk which sent dazzling, mobile reflections from the candles.And the marquiswell, you never really notice what hes wearingits the general effect, like a thoroughbred at the racetrack.A young man named Godfrey was about to ask me for another dance when Christopher appeared, more or less requisitioning my company.He said I looked flushed, what I needed was a glass of lemonade and a breather.He led me to a divan by the wall, sitting me next to Jeffreys younger sister, Cecilia, and then disappeared in search of the refreshment.Miss Macready, Christopher tells me that you are cousins with Lady Doran, I said politely.Cecilia giggled and rolled her eyes expressively.Oh, yes, indeed, my dear Miss Cordell, she replied, fluttering her pudgy hands as she spoke.Why, Lady Doran never cared two pins about us or our relationship until Lord Dearborne inherited the old admirals estate.Poor Mama had been trying to get Lady Catherines attention for years; for all that shes as fast as she can be, she moves in the highest circles.Dear me, shes been the talk of the town ever since she was widowed two years ago, though so careful never to make an open scandal, until now.Mama says shes as indiscreet as a Covent Garden strumpet over Lord Dearborne.Thats why shes come to stay with us.Cecilia gave another one of her warbling giggles.You see, Miss Cordell, she admires our geographical position.Now how was I supposed to respond to that?Kit, where are you?The last thing I wanted to hear was more gossip about Lady Catherine.And so I told Cecilia, who nodded in good natured assent.As an alternative, she suggested we gossip about Lord Dearborne.Snapping her ivory fan and blinking her sparse eyelashes like a chicken in a windstorm, she warmed to her theme.Oh, and hes the most sought after rake in London.Why all the women hes had!Last summer was the most ravishing opera singerthe toast of the demimonde.I saw her once in Hyde Park dashing along in her lovely white carriage with lovely white horses and liverymen all dressed in white.I wondered if the liverymen had been lovely, too.They called her the Snow Queen.She was supposed to be irresistible to men, but even she melted away under the heat of the marquiss boredom, you might say.Hee hee, Snow Queen, melt away, you get it?I forced a smile.Anyway, Lord Dearborne up and gave the fair Snow Queen her marching orders in the most peremptory way, they say.She was simply wretched and wouldnt sing for weeks.The Prince Regent himself went to beg her to return to the stage.Hes too fatally attractive.Lord Dearborne, I mean, not the Prince Regent.She shrieked so loudly in appreciation of her own humor that I wondered with horrid fascination if she would expire on the spot.When she had recovered herself sufficiently to talk again, she leaned over to me conspiratorially.Now, my dear Miss Cordell, you know that I wouldnt dream of repeating confidences shared between friends.You live so near to Lord Dearborne.Tell me, has he ever tried?She left the sentence delicately unfinished, but I felt the color flame into my cheeks.To my fervent though unexpressed gratitude, our tte  tte was interrupted by the fatally attractive one himself.Lord Dearborne strolled leisurely up to us, oblivious to the many covert glances that followed him across the room.Your pardon, ladies.He spoke with such obvious ennui that it must have forever dispelled any notion in Cecilias head that he had ever tried with me.Miss Cordell, may I drag you away from your companion?Lady Peterby begs that I bring you at once for an introduction.Thankfully, a summons from Lady Peterby was the local equivalent to a royal command.I made good my escape on Lord Dearbornes arm.However formidable Lady Peterby might be, it was tarts to table scraps better than being grilled about Lord Dearborne by Cecilia.Lady Peterby, as it turned out, was all friendliness and warmth.As I reached her side, she extended a pair of exquisitely gloved hands to draw me to the settee beside her.The merest trace of a French accent filled her voice with fascinating lilts.Ah, my poor child, forgive me for having sent for you in such a fashion, but I saw that unsuspecting young Warrington left you with that horrid Macready chit.Then when I saw your cheeks brighten like holly berries I was sure that girl was treating you to some of her dreadful store of anecdotes.Naturally the color is most becoming to you, but I thought you might prefer to hear no more.No, no, my dear child, there is no need to thank me.Pray dismiss the whole incident from your mind.Cecilia is a notorious rattle pate with less sense than a molting hen.Now tell me how you go on?You must know that I was very fond of your dear mother.Perhaps you know that she once did us the honor of staying with us?The truth was that Mama had been too proud to take the hospitality that Lady Peterby had offered and stayed at Petersperch under the condition that she tutor the Peterby daughters in their French.My mother and Lady Peterby had lived in the same province in France before the Revolution, though Lady Peterby had left France to marry Lord Lesleys father long before the Terror was more than a gleam in M.  Dantons eye.My mother had often told me of the many kindnesses shown her by the gracious Lady Peterby when she had arrived in England, friendless and without means.Indeed, I discovered that Lady Peterby had the most tactfully unobtrusive sympathy and found it frighteningly easy to confide in her.And so now you find yourself in the guardianship of Nicholas Dearborne, yes?Ah, he is a good boy at heart, with good intentions, although he does not always live up to them.Ive known Nicholas since he was a little one.His father was a cousin to my husbandthough a distant one.If he doesnt behave well toward you then you must come and tell me and I will beat him for you with my cane!Lady Peterby shook her silver tipped walking stick so threateningly in the air that I gave a peal of laughter.She was crippled, poor lady, from a hunting accident years ago, and though she couldnt get around very well by herself, you would hardly notice the handicap, so charmingly did she bear it.Ah, now there is a laugh that will turn heads, said Lady Peterby.So like your lively mama, I can see.Oh, I suppose you must dance with this Godfrey Woodman, here.He is planting himself beside the chair to gain a dance with you and will obviously not be got rid of until he has it.The rest of the evening passed in a delightful haze.I left with a very favorable opinion of balls; everyone had been kind and friendly (except the squire and Mrs.Macready who treated me as tactfully as a pair of nesting swans who have discovered a cuckoo in the nest).I wondered again how Christopher had managed to secure an invitation for me and taxed him with it in the carriage on the way home.Cmon, Kit, tell.Mrs.Macready would never have invited me of her own free will.How did you talk her into it?Threaten to whip Jeffrey in another bout of fisticuffs?No, all I did was to have Jeffrey tell his mother that I couldnt accept an invitation in which you werent included.That brought her around quick enough, I promise you.She thinks that I might pay court to Cecilia.You wouldnt!I exclaimed involuntarily.Lord, no.Have you got windmills in your head?Pay court to that simpering, twittering half wit?He looked so indignant that I hastily begged pardon.And you know, Kit, I had the best time, so Im glad that you got me invited, I said placatingly.Now Ill always be able to say that Ive been to a real ball.Its not every cottage dweller who is privileged to attend a ball at the squires place and hobnob with no less a personage than Lady Peterby herself!She said the kindest things to me.My head was quite turned by it.Christopher only sniffed.Like to know why she shouldnt say kind things to you.As for the Macreadys, its they should be privileged to have you at their ball.You come from a damn sight better family than they do, scuse my language.It makes my blood boil that a bunch of provincial nobodies like the Macreadys think they can play the patricians over you.What a disgusting thing to say.Boiling bloodugh!I wrinkled my nose.How do you think I did on the dance floor?Looked like an angel, my erstwhile dancing master commented simply.How did you manage to keep Godfrey Woodmans rapt attention for so long?The fellow hung on your every wordwhich is amazing considering the time hes spent perfecting his poetic sulk.Its the first time Ive ever seen him show any interest in any female other than ahem.What allurements did you offer to keep him at your side?None.That is, I dont consider a discussion of the symbolism of Clyti to be an allurement.Not precisely, at least.Lord Dearborne raised one elegant eyebrow.What an odd education youve had.One usually doesnt find young girl with a grounding in the classics.Their mamas are content to rear them to paint in runny watercolors, speak unintelligible French, and pluck on poorly tuned harps.Christopher gave me a tolerant grin.Thats what comes of receiving an education under the tutelage of a harebrained old scholar like Mudburys vicar.Elizabeth is so well grounded in the classics that the poor girl is almost more pagan than she is Christian.I believe she prays to Zeus when no one is listening.Just because the poor vicar forgot to remove his nightcap before services Sunday morning is no reason to say hes harebrained.It might have happened to anyone.I bristled in defense of my beloved mentor.I daresay, said Christopher skeptically.But what about last evening when Mrs.Goodbody asked you to read from that book of sermons?Are you going to deny that you said the Lord Jove instead of the Lord Jehovah?No, Im not.But I daresay that no one else would have noticed it if you hadnt commenced to snicker.And you say Im un Christian!So, who is Clytisome overaroused wood nymph, I suppose?asked Christopher.Yes, I replied, though thats a horridly unchivalrous way of putting it.Clyti fell in love with Apollo, the lord of the sun.She would spend the day lying on the grass watching the sun blaze across the sky.Finally, in mercy, she became a sunflower and eternally tilts her face to the suns path.What a familiar story, said Christopher.Think of all the Clytis left gazing at you, Uncle Nicky.How many gardens have you filled with weepy sunflowers?None, said Lord Dearborne.He had been silently gazing out at the moonlit landscape.Love is a farce, Kit.Youll find it only in bad novels and good poetry.All those weepy sunflowers want is my title and income.When is the last time you looked in a mirror, Milord?Six The next morning I was awakened by a persistent patting on my shoulder.Elizabeth, Lizzie, Christa stage whispered.She slipped under the covers with me.Ive got something of the greatest importance to tell you!Shed slopped tea on my new shawl, I thought sleepily.Its all right, Christa, go ahead and tell.I wont be angry.Its not an angry thing.Its a make fun of thing.Thats why I didnt tell you last night when you came home from the ball.I didnt want anyone else to hear about it.You must promise not to tell anyone about it, or theyll all laugh at me.No one ever believes anything I say.So swear an oath not to tell.All right, urn Certain true, black and blue, lay me down and cut me in two.Now tell.I saw a ghost last night.See, youre smilingI can see that youre trying to hide it but its definitely a smile.I beg your pardon, pet.Where did you see your ghost and what did he look like?It was just before you returned from the ball last night.I took Cleo out for her walk and saw it slipping away through the orchard.Do you remember the old topcoat that Admiral Barfreston used to wear, the one with three shoulder capes?He wore it again last night.I shivered in spite of myself.Christa, Admiral Barfreston is dead.We went to his funeral and saw them lower his coffin in the ground with our own eyes.Sometimes at night, in the poor light, you can think that you see all kinds of things.Its your imagination at work.Once when I was out at night I thought I saw a man standing against the house, but when I came closer to it, I saw that it was only an old ladder.That was the night of Henris death, wasnt it?I remember you telling about it at the inquest.Well, listen to this: suppose that Henri didnt fall from the roof after all.Suppose that Admiral Barfrestons ghost returned to the house and murdered Henri because he thought he was a French spy!Of all the lurid Christa, have you been reading those dreadful Minerva novels?First of all, why a spy?Mr.Blakslee says the countryside is just crawling with French spies.You know we are only ten miles from the Channel here.The spies come in at hidden coves with the smugglers.Well, Henri didnt come to Barfrestly with any smugglers.He came in a perfectly respectable coach from London with the marquiss other servants.I know that, Lizzie, but how is the admiral supposed to know that when hes been dead all this time?I wished that Christa would stop referring to the admiral as if he were not really dead.It was enough to give one an attack of gooseflesh.I could see that I would be unable to convince her that her imagination had produced the specter, so I switched tactics, distracting her with a reference to our planned trip to Dyle.Run along now and get ready for our trip today.At this rate it will be midday before we get away.My pessimistic remark proved to be unfounded because when we pulled away in the carriage, the dew had barely dried on the tall grasses around our cottage.The twins, Mrs.Goodbody, and I make an annual excursion to Dyle.Mrs.Goodbodys brother in law sails as a fisherman from the port there.Christopher had expressed a desire to accompany us this year, and he was kind enough to procure the use of Lord Dearbornes carriage for the ten mile ride.It proved to be a definite improvement over former years, when we relied on the bumpy public stagecoach.As we neared Dyle and the seacoast, the tame farmland gave way to low shingled marshesa gala dappled swirl of sheer blue greens, russets, and pewter.The air grew sly with the scents of salts and fish.My sisters and I listened for the high calls of the shy bittern and marsh hen, two birds which rarely come so far inland as Barfrestly.The weather, for once, was perfect.Mrs.Goodbodys brother in law lived with his large, busy family in a snug whitewashed cottage that poked sturdily up from its nest of trimmed evergreen bushes.Their family had lived there for generationsas long as Lord Dearbornes arrogant ancestors have dominated their thousands of acres, I reflected.I tried to imagine Lord Dearborne in hobnail boots and woolen trousers.I was forced to the unsatisfactory conclusion that he would still look exactly like a marquis.Christopher, on the other hand, had no airs, no cultivated arrogance to keep him separated from the human race.Kit had something far better than good mannershe was naturally friendly.I watched with appreciation at the way he smiled himself into the good graces of Mrs.Goodbodys sister and ended up with the largest slice of the potato pie that was served for luncheon.We ate outside to the low rumble of crashing waves; the salt smell was fresh and invigorating as it came in on the breeze.Time passed quickly as Mrs.Goodbodys brother in law kept us enthralled with tales of the sea, with its invisible tides and hidden coves where mermaids and monsters lurked.After we had lunched, we walked down to the harbor to view the ceremony which served as an excuse for our yearly pilgrimage, the blessing of the fishing boats and nets.This was an important day for fisher folk.We joined the large crowd at seaside, so large that it stretched up the brow of the hill by the harbor.The gathering was a colorful sight as I turned to look behind me.It is the custom at the ceremony to arrive loaded down with garlands of flowers which are tossed into the water at a certain point as a way of blessing the catch.Dr.Smithfield, the old vicar, had told me that the ceremony dated from the pre Christian era when the offerings were made to a Roman fertility goddess, and had only been embellished with Christian trappings with the arrival of Christian missionaries.I wondered what the assembled multitude would think if they knew they were participating in a pagan ritual.The members of the town council, along with the mayor, were standing on a makeshift platform by the quay.The mayor looked important and solemn in his official robes with his chain of office around his wrinkled neck.The gathering hushed as the parson mounted the platform and made his blessing upon the boat and nets.His voice carried over the crowd, rolling and sonorous like the waves that were washing to the beach, as he recited the ancient prayer.Good Lord lead us Good Lord speed us From all perils protect us From the darkness us protect.Finest nights to land our fish Sound and big to fill our wish God keep our nets from snag and break For every man a goodly take Lord grant us.At the finish of the traditional prayer it seemed to be raining gardens as the flowers were tossed in the brine.All about me the people were saying, Lord bless me as they rid themselves of their fragrant blossoms.After the beautiful open air ceremony, through the crowd were passed baskets full of tiny squares of stale gingerbread, along with flasks of gin from which everyone took a swig.When the flask reached our gathering, Christopher looked at it doubtfully.Dont worry, said Caro.The gin is strong enough to kill any bad humors which might be hanging about the flask.Christopher drank and passed it to me.I permitted myself one cautious sip.Christopher laughed when I pulled a face.The ceremony was over.It was Mrs.Goodbodys intention to return to the cottage with her brother in law and his family to enjoy a leisurely coze, sharing confidences in the intimate way one does with members of ones family.This left Christopher, my sisters, and me with some time to savor the attractions of Dyle.As the sea was too chilly for wading that early in the year, we decided to take Christopher on a tour of the town itself.Dyle is built up a hillside on a series of terraces that rise from the smooth stretch of beach.The narrow high street cuts through the town and ends on top of the hill in front of the parish church.We took the exhausting trek up High Street to a vantage point below the church, and turned to enjoy the view.The ocean was dark blue under the sun, contrasting nicely with the ochre thatch of the rooftops.It was as if we were standing on the edge of a great bowl.I was certain I could make out the outline of the French coast if only I peered hard enough.Lizzie, why are you making that awful squint?asked Christa.She is trying to see France, returned Caro, whose intent, furrowed brow indicated she was undertaking the same project.The wind is very strong up here, isnt it, Christopher, I shouted.He was standing on a large rock, pointing at something and shouting back.Over there to the south, he was saying.What are all those grayish rectangular buildings there?I scrambled up the rock after him and looked where he was pointing, shielding my eyes from the sun.Those are army barracks, I said.Theres a lot of invasion scares on the coast here.Look behind us; you can see the Martello towers, and down below, that dark line of water coming out from behind that bluff.That is the Napoleonic Defensive Waterway.The army built it.Think that canals going to keep Napoleon out?said Christopher, grinning.Do you really think we are going to be invaded?I asked him.It seemed so strange to contemplate.No, hes too busy dealing with the blockades and Continental armies to invade this mans island, said Christopher with assurance.No need to hurry with your French, Lizbeth.Well, thats comforting.You know everyone who lives near the coast worries about being ravished in their beds by foreign soldiers.Julius Caesar landed his galleys here; so did William the Conqueror.There is always a lot of drama connected with these coastal towns.Just twenty five years ago, William Pitt sent soldiers here to burn all the fishing boats because some of them were built with false bottoms to hide contraband goods.Mrs.Goodbodys brother in law is bitter about it to this day.But as we both know, that didnt stop the smugglers, Christopher declared.Hells bells, no, flashed Christa.The twins had clambered up to join us.The excisemen still fight it out with the smugglers.Isnt that right, Lizzie?And Ill bet plenty of spies sneak over here, too.Im going to tell Mrs.Goodbody you cursed, Caro shot at her twin.She is going to wash out your mouth with soap.They chased each other across the hillside.I looked at Christopher, suddenly remembering his father may have been shot by spies.If he was disturbed it didnt show.Cmon, Christopher, I want to show you the church, I said.We climbed the narrow path up to an even higher level and threaded our way along a row of pollard limes.Far out to the left, in dour isolation, stood the Time Bell Tower, an important landmark.Its huge clock is used to determine the sailing times for ships in the harbor.On a clear day, they say it can be seen for miles out to sea.I dutifully pointed it out to Christopher, who expressed a desire to see it closer.Maybe there is a way to climb up inside and look out to sea?said Christopher hopefully.Oh no, its much too dangerous.Two years ago there was a terrible accident there.A couple of village boys climbed out on the ledge underneath the clock to see a heron that was nesting.They lost their footing in a gust of wind and fell to the bottom and were killed.Now its kept locked all the time.We reached the medieval church, pulled open the heavy oaken door, and stepped inside.The interior of the ancient church is colored a deep, ashen gray, the smoky light that filters in through the high clerestory windows falling lifelessly upon the stone walls.The place is almost crushingly claustrophobic.The roof is supported by pillars of pewter colored marble which adds to the air of dead elegance.I showed Christopher a crack in the side wall which was caused by an earthquake in the last century.Theres an old catacomb underneath the church, I volunteered in a whisper.Below the chancel.It contains old skulls and shinbones that were saved when the graveyard was dug up at some point in medieval times.Can we go look at it?said Christopher.I wasnt expecting him to say that, but I supposed I should accommodate a guest.We began the trek down the center aisle to the chancel.It seemed a very long way.The twins were tiptoeing.When we reached the door that led below, we pulled it open and were at once hit with a wave of chill, dampish air.We each took one of the smelly fish oil lamps that stood on a nearby table, ready for those who made the pilgrimage into the basement crypt.I felt the need to put on a brave front so I led the way down the mossy steps to the earth lined passageway below.As we came out of the stair hall our lamplight filled a cavernous chamber that was lined from floor to ceiling with skulls and long bones.There must be thousands of skulls here, came Christophers voice in my ear.Two thousand.At least thats what they said last time they were counted.Theyve started keeping count of them since Gypsy women started coming here to steal the bones for boiling down to make an infusion against rheumatism.Christa stood with her arms wrapped around her, rubbing her shoulders to keep out the cold.They say the smugglers use this place as a hideout.There are millions of tunnels leading through the ground here, she told Christopher.I suddenly got the most pronounced sensation of being watched.The light slanted crazily off the eyeless sockets of the skulls, giving them an unearthly wavering glitter.Christa, in the name of Zeus, would you stop carping about spies?I said with unaccustomed snappishness.I turned around and led the way back up the slippery stairs to the dry stale air of the church.It wasnt until we were halfway down the aisle that I realized dismally that my sash was undone and my reticule gone.It must have come untied when I brushed against the wall near the foot of the stairs.And I had my reticule tied to it.
