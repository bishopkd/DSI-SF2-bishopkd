Get closer?She wrinkled her nose.I dont know.Im having a good hair day and that mist from the water will frizz it right up.Alec took a deep breath.Kat, please walk with me to the fountain.She opened her mouth, looking like she was going to protest again, but then she stopped and cocked her head, studying her boyfriends face.Um, okay.Great, Alec muttered under his breath and grabbed her hands as they rose from the table.She shot him a big smile, but that didnt seem to relax him any.Their table was relatively close to the fountain already, so Kat and Alec had to walk only about ten feet to the edge.Tate watched their backs and thought what an attractive couple they made, with Kats looks and Alecs style.And then Alec turned to Kat, licking his lips.When he gripped both her hands in his, they were trembling.And Tate knew what was next.She clapped her hand over her mouth and said through her fingers, Oh my God.What?Cam asked.And Tate pointed at Kat and Alec.She was staring at him as he dropped to one knee in front of the fountain.Lea whipped out her cell phone and began to snap pictures.Danica watched, a huge smile on her previously controlled face.Meu corao, my heart, Alec said.I love you.I love your laugh and your wit and your heart.And I want that in my life every day.For the rest of my days.Will you marry me?He pulled a ring out of his pocket and held it up to Kat.Tates eyes watered even though shed just met these people.Kat was crying.And Tate noticed the girl even cried beautifully.Kat nodded and let Alec slip the ring on her finger and then she wrapped her arms around his shoulders and kissed him.The crowd on the patio began to clap.And Cam whistled while Max hollered.When they came back to the table, Alec no longer looked nervous.He looked like he just won the lottery.Kat dropped into her seat, eyes on her ring.The round diamond sat on a yellow gold band.Its so beautiful.Alec leaned over.The gold is actually from my fathers ring.My mom let me have it and the jeweler melted it down for you.Kat looked up at him with wide eyes and started crying harder.Alec wrapped her in his arms while she sobbed on his shoulder.Tate looked at Cam questioningly.His father died when he was a kid.Tate nodded and smiled knowingly at Alec over Kats head.He returned the smile.Max cleared his throat.So, uh, I dont wanna be a dick or anything  So that means youre gonna be a dick, Cam growled.but you kinda stole my thunder, man, Max said with narrowed eyes.Kat leaned back and wiped her eyes while Alec stared at his friend.What?Max waved his hand.Rockefeller Center.Hello, this is my romantic gesture.Alec rolled his eyes.You own fucking Rockefeller Center now?Just saying, this is kind of my thing.This is where I thought Id get engaged.Lea smacked Max on the head.Will you shut up?Let them have their moment.She leaned in closer to her boyfriend.And what do you mean this is where you thought youd get engaged?Who says Ill say yes?Max threw back his head and laughed.Oh, doll, dont even act like youd turn me down.I might, Lea said, her eyes all fire.Maxs hardened with determination.You challenging me?Because I will plan the best engagement in the history of engagements.Yeah?What if I said I want to get engaged while listening to the London Philharmonic Orchestra and drinking South African wine?Done.Leas chin tilted up.On top of an elephant.Ill bring the whole fucking circus, doll.Alec reached over and waved a hand between them.Shit, you two.Give it a rest.Max leaned back but mouthed, This isnt over to Lea.She smirked back.Tate decided she needed Lea to be her best friend.Alec smiled at Cam.You gonna get the marriage fever now.Cam laughed.I think were just gonna live in sin for a little bit.Max turned to Danica.What about you?Going to make an honest woman out of somebody when you move out to California?Tate raised her eyebrows at woman.Danica eyed Max over her glasses.I dont think marriage is my thing.Alec shoved her shoulder gently.Even if you dont decide to get married, youll find someone that you want to spend the rest of your life with.Danica shrugged, and her gaze wandered to the fountain.Maybe.After chatting for another hour or so, and getting interrupted by strangers wishing Kat and Alec good luck, they all parted ways.Tate was sad to see Cams friends go and told him so as they began the walk to the train station.Can we all get together again?Cam smiled.Sure, and hey, we have a wedding to attend now.Tate frowned.I need a dress.Cam bumped her with his hip.I think you got some time.They bought Tates train ticket at the terminal and then took a seat at the station so they were ready when their train departed.Cam rolled his head on the back of his seat to face her and laced his fingers with hers.When I propose, its not going to be in Rockefeller Center.Tate laughed.Thats quite all right.He stared at their hands and rubbed his thumb in circles on her skin.You know I wanna marry you though, right?With the house and dog and rain forest with the poison dart frogs?He pressed a kiss to her lips.Wouldnt want it any other way.23   In Utope:      CAM STOOD OUTSIDE their house with his hands on his hips.Months ago, they had razed the deadly rain forest in the backyard, donating the poison dart frogs to the zoo.Now, their backyard was fenced while a live Pinkie Pie grazed.He waved to the pony, and she grinned back.It was weird that a horse could grin.And itd been one heck of a hack on the game to do it.He walked inside the house, his anxiety meter bordering on red.Everything had to be perfect.He had all their bags packed by the door.He called for Tate and she ran down the stairs with an extra backpack on her shoulder.He rolled his eyes and ushered her out of the house.They hopped in their yellow Jeep with the top down and cruised to a secluded spot to set up camp.They made smores over a fire and told ghost stories.And then, as Tates figure was silhouetted against the back of the fire, Cam got down on one knee and held up a huge diamond ring.Hed had to hack the fuck out of the game for this, too.Tates hands flew to her cheeks, and then she flapped her arms as little pixel tears streamed down her face.Yes, she screamed.She tackled him, and then their bodies blurred out because their clothes were no longer on.That was on the next hack list.CAM COCKED HIS head, listening for the footsteps.And there they were, flying up from the basement of the house he and Tate shared.Hed told her to open up the game console down in the basement, while he used the one upstairs in their bedroom.It might not be the most epic proposal.It might not be Rockefeller Center, but it was he and Tate.The door flew open and Tate stood there, her hair wild and wet around her head from her recent shower.Are you fucking serious right now?He pulled a box out from under his pillow on the bed.As a fucking heart attack.And then she tackled him in real life, and nothing was blurred when their clothes came off.And in the end, Tate wore nothing but a diamond ring and a smile and Cam thought it was the best shed ever looked.The End      Dont miss any of Megan Ericksons Bowler University series!Read on for a look at where it all began with  Make It Count  and  Make It Right      Make It Count  Kat Caruso wishes her brain had a return policy, or at least a complaint hotline.The defective organ is constantly distracted, terrible at statistics, and absolutely flooded with inappropriate thoughts about her boyfriends gorgeous best friend, Alec ...who just so happens to be her brand new math tutor.Who knew nerds could be so hot?Kat usually goes through tutors like she does boyfriendsboth always seem to bail when they realize how hopeless she is.Its safer for her heart to keep everyone at arms length.But Alec is always stepping just a little too close.Alec Stone should not be fantasizing about Kat.Shes adorable, unbelievably witty, and completely off limits.Hed never stab his best friend in the back ...But when secrets are revealed, the lines of loyalty are blurred.To make it count, Alec must learn messy human emotions cant be solved like a trigonometry function.And Kat has to trust that Alec may be the first guy to want her for who she is, and not in spite of it.KAT CHEWED ON her pen and studied her tutors bent head.Ashleys shiny black hair was pulled back into a ponytail, held in place by a ...scrunchie.Seriously?Was that really a sparkly teal scrunchie?Kat bit down harder on her pen in concentration.Did they even sell those anymore?The last time shed seen one, shed been six and wrapped it around her side ponytail, pretending to be Kelly Kapowski while watching Saved by the Bell reruns.Ashley droned on about something, and Kat yawned.She looked down at her notes but some of the words blurred, increasing her headache, so she gazed around the library.Through the windows, the late January wind rattled the bare trees.Kat?Did you hear me?Ashleys voice needled into her ear.Kat snapped her head back.Um ...yeah?Ashley slumped her shoulders with a sigh.Look, Im going to be honest here.I like you, okay?But I dont think youre getting anything out of these sessions.I think my time would be better spent with someone else.Kat opened her mouth but then snapped her jaw shut.It wasnt like she hadnt heard it before.Her inability to stay focused had annoyed plenty of tutors.Not to mention just about everyone else in her life.She jutted out her chin with as much confidence as she could muster.Shed find another tutor.I think thats a good idea, Ashley.Id planned to say the same thing.The lie came easily.Im doing better in statistics anyway, so I dont need the help anymore.Ashley raised an eyebrow while gathering her papers.Okay, well, it was ...nice to meet you.She winced, as if it was painful to say, then waved meekly and left.Kat groaned softly.She was in the second semester of her sophomore year at Bowler University and already on academic probation.If she failed another course, she would be kicked out.This semesters bane of her existencestatistics.She hated her brain.Absolutely hated the way it could never make sense of words and numbers on the page in front of her.How it wandered and couldnt focus on one thing for very long.How it was to blame for the dumb blonde jokes that had followed her like an unfunny comedian her whole life.She wasnt even blonde.Not really.She held up a wavy curl and picked at the ends.It was more like a light brown.Caramel.Or whiskey.With blonde highlights.Were those split ends?She needed a haircut, stat.And a root touch up because her highlights were growing out.And maybe an eyebrow wax.There was that place over on Lexington that took walk ins ...Her cell phone vibrated on the table, announcing an incoming text message from her boyfriend.She swiped her thumb across the screen, automatically launching the text to speech app shed downloaded after repeatedly reading her text messages incorrectly.Shed thought downloading it was genius at the time, until a clearly audible Your ass looks hot today text read in a sexy male Australian accent scandalized an unfortunate seventy year old at the drugstore.Luckily, this message was tame.Come over tonight.She muttered to herself, And thats an order, Private.Would it kill him to type please?It was only an extra six letters.Max Payton didnt know she had a tutor.He didnt know much about her at all, really.But he was hotreally hotand fun and as a junior, lived in a house off campus with his own room.And he liked to bake.Seriously, the man baked her chocolate chip cookies.They were really good, too.When she asked him about the secret ingredient, hed laughed and said flour.She was pretty sure he was making fun of her.But shed learned at an early age to pretend mocking was just teasing.She gathered her books and stuffed them into her plaid Burberry messenger bag, then headed toward the front doors, smoothie from the library snack shop in hand.Head bent, fiddling with the clasp of her bag, she stumbled into a wall of human on the pavement outside.Oh, Im sorry Her voice dropped out when she realized the solid flesh belonged to Alec, Maxs best friend.Shed only met him once or twice before hed moved in with Max this semester and every time, he cocked his eyebrow with a half frown like he knew something she didnt.Which he actually did, since he had brainy superpowers.Smarter than a speeding Einstein.Able to leap over C minus students like her in a single bound.She didnt trust people that smart.And she didnt trust a guy who didnt ogle her ass or leer at her boobs like every other member of the straight male species on the planet.She once asked Max if Alec was gay, and Max had laughed so hard, she feared hed pop a blood vessel in his forehead.Then he assured her his friend was in fact, very straight.Shed believe it when she saw it.Right now, that raised eyebrow frown pinned her where she stood.His pale green eyes behind thick black frames roamed over her shoulder to the library and then back to her.With his pin stripe button down, dark jeans with Converse shoes and hair styled in a short, messy pompadour, he looked like a nerdy Elvis.His frown morphed into a smile when he spotted the smoothie in her hand, and she definitely didnt notice his full lips.You know, you dont have to venture into the forbidden zone just to get a smoothie.Oooh.The jerk.She glanced around surreptitiously, then leaned in and spoke in a low voice.Just play it cool.Dont let it slip someone like me snuck in the library.She gripped his forearm and whispered.Password today is rosebud.His face blanked and he looked at her like hed never seen her before.Kat debated whether or not that was an improvement over his other look.But then those intelligent eyes narrowed and a smirk curled his lips.I know.We nerds get an e mail every morning.See?He always needed the last word.She propped a hand on her hip and leaned in.Well, sounds like you have a mole.Might want to look into that.He opened his mouth but she cut him off.Just looking out for you guys.Anyway, see ya around!Before he could shoot back a snarky comeback, Kat skirted around him and bounded down the stairs.She chalked that up as Kat 1, Alec 0.She pulled out her phone and texted Max.Come get me.At campus entrance in 10.Kat stuffed her hands in the pockets of her fabulousbought for a total stealred peacoat, and took the long walk to the head of campus.The air was cold, that damp chill typical for Maryland.She glared sullenly at the bare trees on campus, wishing for spring, when theyd bloom again.Shed visited the campus in the spring of her junior year of high school with her parents, and everything about the university and nearby town of Bowler felt right.During her first year as a student, shed built friendships and kept a decent reputation.This second year was proving to be a huge pain.Kat arrived at the large stones marking the entrance of the campus, BOWLER carved into them and painted red.She began to worry about the condition of her frozen toes until Max pulled up to the sidewalk in his old truck.Babe, get in.She didnt need the invitation as she wrenched open the rusted door and hopped inside, smiling at him.The first time she saw Max, he was standing on a table in the middle of a raging house party in October, fist at his mouth as he belted the chorus to Dont Stop Believin.He was gorgeous in that confident, cocky way.And he looked like he belonged on the cover of a romance novel, wearing nothing but unlaced football pants and artistically placed eye black, the right amount of sweat running down the middle of his tanned pecs.Their gazes had met and when he winked those big brown eyes at her, flashing a wide easy smile, she was a goner.And one of the things she liked most about him was he didnt ask her too many questions about herself.So she didnt pry into his life.She wasnt going to marry the guy.But she liked his kisses and his cookies.Your roommates around?She buckled her seat belt.Uh, I think Cam went home for the weekend.Alec is around, I guess.He squeezed her thigh.You know, hell be busy studying like always.Should be quiet if you want to spend the night.She sighed and wondered if Max was fed up with her evasion of sex.It wasnt that she didnt like sex.She loved it, actually.And while she was attracted to Max, something was holding her back.Maybe, she said.Max sighed, and she absorbed the sting of his disappointment.Kat gingerly placed her feet on crumpled fast food bags.Something oozed out of a damp corner and she hoped it was ketchup.The color suggested otherwise.I thought we agreed you were going to clean out your car.She eyed the suspicious substance and wished she had one of those hazardous waste trash cans from a doctors office.Max snickered and nodded toward the bags.Im saving that for later.Kat wrinkled her nose and he laughed harder.Organization was key to her life.She could control thather bedroom tidy and her calendar neatly filled out with color coded highlighter.Of course, it was a stark contrast to the riot of chaos that was her mind.But fake it til you make it, right?Max parked along the sidewalk outside of his townhome off campus and as they crossed the street, Kat tried to grab his hand.He evaded it like always and wrapped a beefy arm around her neck.She huffed under her breath.For once, she wished he didnt act too cool to hold her hand.Maxs place was on the end of a row of four townhomes.The high ceilings made the already large living room feel even bigger.The kitchen was a decent size but outdated, with old appliances, a crumbling tile floor and a ceiling fan light you had to tug just so if you wanted to see your hand in front of your face.The staircase leading to the bedrooms upstairs was ornate, with a thick, solid railing Max often straddled and slid down with a whoop.There was one bathroom on the second floor, which for a guys place was relatively clean.When they walked inside the front door, Max headed right to the kitchen while Kat settled on the couch in the living room, running her hands over the ugly, fuchsia flowered fabric.Max and his roommate Cam had found it by a Dumpster before they moved in.Kat was still unsure if sitting on it would give her a rash.Minutes later, Max plopped down beside her with a can of beer and promptly turned on the TV to a hockey game.Kat yawned.Hockey was boring to watch.The guys didnt wear tight clothes and lot of them were missing teeth.Playoff hockey was even worse because the players didnt shave and had scraggly neck beards.Gross.When shed had enough of trying to find the tiny puck on the screen, she said, Im going to make a sandwich.You want one?Yeah, I think we have some peanut butter and jelly.As she walked into the kitchen, he called to her back, Hey, I made some cookies for my brothers earlier today, bring us in a couple, yeah?Kat gave a thumbs up over her shoulder.Max worked at his dads auto mechanics shop almost every weekend along with his older brothers.And they always demanded Maxs treats.In the kitchen, she searched through the thin plywood cabinets until she found the peanut butter, then pulled the jelly and the bread out of the puke green colored refrigerator.The front door opened and closed and low voices carried in from the living room.She shifted to the edge of the counter to grab a towel and ran smack into someone.Ouch!She whirled around to face her opponent and met Alecs eyes.She frowned at him, rubbing her shoulder.Seriously?Twice in one day?He rolled his eyes and held his hands up.Yep, Im following you around so I can get poked in the ribs by your bony elbows.Her mouth dropped open.Bony?!You think my elbows are bony?She bent her arm and eyed the joint.I think my elbows are quite attractive, thank you very much.He looked at her as if she were one of those bugs you tolerate only because it eats worse bugs.Then his lips twitched into a grin and he leaned down, his lips near her elbow like it was a microphone.Im sorry, Kats Elbow.Youre the sexiest elbow on campus, he said in a deep, sexy voice.Wait, what?When did she start attributing Alec with anything sexy?With him stooped for his elbow apology, their eyes met.His green irises studied her, making her feel naked.Not clothes naked but brain naked.Like he pried off the top off her head to look inside.She didnt want anyone to peek inside the top of her head.Her brain was probably all weird colored and deformed.It looked better covered by her skull, scalp and in need of a dye job hair.She steeled herself against the rush of heat flooding her face, because it was really wrong to be a creeper about her boyfriends best friend.Didnt mean she couldnt look at his nice eyes.And big hands.And good profile with one of those Roman or Greek noses or whatever they were called.And thick dark hair she wanted to run her hands through, grip and pull.Just to see if it turned him on.Oh sugar snacks, now she was having dirty thoughts about her boyfriends nerdy roommate.Clearly, her brain was deformed.She huffed in annoyance and backed away from him to resume her task, spreading four slices of bread on the counter and digging in the tub of peanut butter.A hand crept into view and grabbed a banana off the counter while she slathered peanut butter on two slices of bread and reached for the jelly.A throat cleared behind her.If you put peanut butter on both sides of the bread, then the jelly doesnt make it soggy.He apparently didnt even think she was capable of making a flipping peanut butter and jelly sandwich.She stuck a peanut butter covered finger in her mouth turned to face him.When his eyes tracked her finger and lingered on her lips, she felt as if she won this small battle of the sexes.Kat 2, Alec 0.She smirked.Im so glad youre around to show me the error of my sandwich making ways.What would I do without you, Alec?He took a bite of banana, chewed and swallowed.I guess youd have a soggy sandwich.She rolled her eyes and turned back to her task.He finished his banana and threw the peel in the trash.Do you want me to make you one, too?she asked.He paused with his hand on the door.Sure.Thanks.When he walked out of the kitchen, she pulled two more slices of bread and spread peanut butter on all the slices before squeezing on the jelly.She carried the finished sandwiches and cookies out to the guys, then sat down beside Max.The hockey game was still on and even though she didnt give two flips about it, she pretended to care since Max did.That was pretty much Good Girlfriend 101.She took a bite of her sandwich and squinted at the TV.So, what quarter is this?What teams are playing?Babe, this is hockey.There are no quarters.There are periods andWhat the fuck, ref!That was tripping!anyway, I think you ask me that question every game.Either remember or stop asking.His focus returned to the game.That should have been a damn penalty, he muttered.Well then.Apparently she had to retake Good Girlfriend 101.She thought about telling him she didnt remember because she really only half listened to his answer.She cared about hockey about as much as she cared about what an absolute risk was in statistics.But it wasnt worth it, and she was hungry.Kat focused on her sandwich because the double peanut butter trick was pretty dang good ...Alec cleared this throat and she looked up.Kat, there are three twenty minute periods in hockey.This is the first period.The Ducks are playing the Redhawks.Ducks are green jerseys; Redhawks are black.Ducks are winning.His tone was light and almost cautious.Like he thought she was going to take off his head.It was one of the few times he had spoken to her and his attentionthose intelligent eyes fixed on hercaused a rush of heat to flare in her face.Thanks, Alec, she mumbled, eyes down on her sandwich to hide the color in her cheeks.But she raised her head when her spine prickled, and they locked gazes for a moment.Kat was very aware of the air growing hot and heavy around her.Alecs lips twitched slightly, and her eyes were drawn to their fullness.Max murmured at the TV, drawing her attention before a bow chicka bow wow soundtrack could play in her head.She was so screwed.Alec rose stiffly.He grabbed his book bag off the couch and said, I have some studying to do.Ill be in my room.Later.Max waved him off, his attention unwavering from the game.Alec walked up the stairs, and Kat willed herself not to watch him.But her willpower was only so strong.At the top of the stairs, he turned around and immediately met her eyes.Shoot!She quickly whirled her head around and stared blindly at the TV.Games getting good, huh, babe?Max grabbed the rest of her abandoned sandwich.Yep, she muttered.Great game.Make It Right  Max Payton would like nothing more than to forget his junior year of college ...and yet, being a senior isnt looking much better.After graduation hell still be under his overbearing fathers thumb, helping run the family business as hes always been expected to do.When Max volunteers to help teach a self defense class after a rash of assaults and thefts on campus, one of the other instructors is the pixie faced girl he hasnt been able to stop thinking about since last year.His dad taught him that size and strength always win a fight.But while Max is lying on the mat at Lea Travers feet after a skilled blow to his carotid artery, he begins to revise that thought.Lea Travers avoids guys like Maxcocky jocks who assume shes a fragile doll because of her short stature and disability from a childhood car accident.She likes to be in control, and Max challenges her at every turn.But during the moments he lets his guard down, she sees a soul as broken inside as she is outside.Trusting him is a whole other problem ...When the assaults hit close to home, both Max and Lea have to change their assumptions about strength and weakness before they can get the future they wanttogether.MAX DRAINED HIS cup of beer and closed his eyes to let the sounds of the party sink into his skin and down into his bones.This usually workedthe alcohol in his veins, the music, the friends.The girls.He fed off others energy, always had.His favorite thing to do to unwind was to head out to a bar or party and just let loose.So when his roommate Cam found him cursing and pacing his room like an animal after a particularly delightful phone call with his fatherMax curled his lip in a sneer just thinking about ithed encouraged Max to go out.Thats what his friends did.They knew him better than he knew himself sometimes.But for once, Max hadnt wanted to.Hed wanted to go to the gym and sweat out all the anger, but Cam was persistent.So Max relented.He knew now he shouldnt have.Because the beer tasted skunked and the music hurt his head and even the girls werent interesting.The redhead beside him right now was still talking.Hed asked her one question about her major, and she was still rambling on about it five minutes later.Hed said maybe two sentences to this girl, both questions about herself, but she was clearly still into him, pressing her chest against his folded arms.The lace of her bra peaked out the top of her neckline, and he could feel the textured fabric through her thin shirt when it brushed against his knuckles.He hadnt even been in the mood to lay on the charm.He knew how to stand, how to smile with his eyes.Smize, one of his brothers ex girlfriends had called it with a giggle.Whatever it was.He knew how to do it.And knew how to get the girl.Too bad he didnt want her.Fuck this shit.He set his empty beer cup on a window ledge.Um, Kelly, he said, cutting in when she finally took a breath.He remembered her name, because he always remembered names.Kelly blinked and peered up at him through her lashes, lips parted.She was hot.Big rack.A year ago, she would have been his type.Hell, most girls were his type.But lately, theyd reminded him of how much hed almost fucked up his life.Except that one girl ...He shook his head, and leaned down to speak into her ear.He heard a stuttered inhale and resisting rolling his eyes.I gotta head out.I forgot I need to get home.Early morning.He leaned back and shot her a smile.Or smize.Whatever.Confusion crossed her face, but he was over this scene.Sorry, he said with a shrug and turned away before she could respond.Max searched the sea of bodies for Cam.The guy was over in the corner with a girl, flashing his dimples while she looked up at him with pure infatuation.Max rolled his eyes and hollered, Ruiz!Cam turned his head and Max gave him the sign he was heading out.Cam waved in acknowledgment and turned back to his girl of the night.Max made his way through the crowd, feeling a couple of touches on his arms or shoulders, some Hey Max s, but he kept walking because he wasnt in the mood and enough people already thought he was an asshole.He wished Alec, his best friend, was around, but hed decided to stay home with his girlfriend, Kat, tonight.Kat, who used to be Maxs girlfriend.Before he fucked it up.Life was complicated.Once he stepped outside, he pulled up the collar of his jacket against the early October air and walked briskly back to the townhouse he shared with Alec and Cam.The phone call with his dad still rankled, the words poking him with their sharp edges.Hed mentioned changing his major, had barely even spoken the words when his dad proclaimed Paytons stick together!and Max was expected to complete his business degree and then work at his dads mechanic shop, helping with the books and business side of things.Max didnt want to, but the obligation to work with his dad and two brothers weighed heavily on his shoulders.Plus, his dad said he wouldnt hesitate to withdraw his tuition help, and Max couldnt afford to cover it, despite his two jobs.The bastard.The lights of the convenience store near his house caught his eye and he changed direction, suddenly hungry for those super greasy pizzas they made in the back and kept in a warmer on the counter.He was still a little drunk but hopefully the cheese, dough and sauce would mop up the rest of the awful beer sitting like acid in his stomach.He crossed the parking lot and then stopped beside the front doors, fumbling inside his pockets.His phone fell out and he cursed as it clattered on the sidewalk.He shoved it back in his coat pocket and then dug his wallet out of his back jeans pocket.He blinked at it blearily and tried to count his bills.He kept losing count of his ones and had to start over.Fucking beer.The bell on the convenience store door tinkled and he heard a voicethat damn musical voice that hit him in the gut every time he heard it.And he couldnt figure out why.He looked up from his wallet and there she was, Lea Travers, talking to some tall blond guy, his arm around her slender shoulders.Max must have made a sound or movement because Lea turned her head, her long, dark straight hair swirling around her shoulders.In the glow of the streetlights, her eyes were even bigger, rounder and darker than normal, staring at him from under her thick fringe of bangs.She wore low heeled knee high boots and tight jeans and a thigh length pink jacket that cinched at the waist.Her full lips were parted and her cheeks flushed, probably from the warmth of the convenience store she just left.For a moment, he enjoyed the way she looked at him, a little bit of curious hope.Hed met her last year, because she was friends with Kat.There was something about Lea, this power or strength that lurked below the surface of her small, fragile frame.He wanted to grab that strength, roll around in it like a cat in catnip.Max looked to the guy who stood next to her, a proprietary arm around her shoulderswhich Max glared atand a pizza box in the other hand.The guy was tall and blond and had big blue eyes and looked like he just came from Wimbledon, where he had front row seats because he was the heir to his dads pharmaceutical business.He was the kind of kid whose dad drove some fancy BMW or Mercedes into the shop and then looked down on Max and his brothers, with their grease stained clothes and fingernails.He looked vaguely familiar but Max couldnt place him, and the guys perfect hair and collared polo made him want to hurl.So she had a boyfriend.And Max was done, absolutely positively fucking done with girls who were attached.Hed almost lost his best friend over the last time hed let himself get involved with one.So, like always, he fell back on what he knew.He curled his upper lip into a smirk, opened his mouth, and let out the asshole.Hey there, doll.Leas eyes narrowed and her lips pressed into a thin line.Well, itd been nice while it lasted.His fault.Her lips parted one time to sigh.Hi, Max.He didnt want it to be this way between them.He wanted to saunter up next to her, wrap an arm around her neck and look down into those dark eyes while they filled with lust ...Shit.Fucking drunken daydreams.None of that was happening because somehow, around Lea, he turned into a six year old boy, teasing the girl he wanted the most.And no matter how hard he tried, he couldnt curb the asshole.He jerked a thumb at the convenience door.Might want to find a new boyfriend, there, Travers.Clearly Polo Boy can afford to take you to a nicer place.The words were coming, coming up like vomit, and with them came a heavy helping of self loathing.He couldnt stop them.Although, if a convenience store pizza is all it takes to get a date with you, even I can afford that.Polo Boy opened his mouth but Lea tapped his chest with the back of her hand, so he clamped his jaws shut.Maxs mouth just had a mind of his own now.Oh, he replies to hand signals, too?Got em trained.Max, why are you always such an asshole?The worst part about it was that Lea wasnt angry, her voice wasnt biting, it was dripping with disappointment and that was worse.He wanted her to be angry and stomp in a huff.He wanted a reaction.He didnt want pity.He spread his arms wide.Thats who I am, doll.It was a lie, but hed perfected being an asshole to an art.Just like the charmer role.It was easier than trying to figure out who he really was or wanted to be.Her eyes narrowed more, and then Polo Boy spoke up.Look  Lea cut him off.Its fine, Nick.Lets go.They walked away, Polo Boys arm around her shoulders, Leas limp from a childhood car accident more pronounced in the cold weather.Max gritted his teeth.For once keeping his mouth shut from calling after them to ask what would buy him second base.He looked at his wallet again in his hands and shoved it back into his pocket.He wasnt hungry for pizza anymore.LEA STARED AT her boots as she walked and curled her hands into fists in the pockets of her jacket.Nick was silent beside her, lost in his own thoughts.She hadnt known Max long, and what she knew of him wasnt so great.Hed dated Kat and hadnt been a very good boyfriend.And everything about Max, from his swagger to his snug T shirts to his cocky smirk, screamed confident asshole.Which meant he wasnt for her.But tonight, for a brief moment, those big, expressive brown eyes had showed a glimmer of hope before he blinked.Then the alcohol haze clouded over them, and that little sliver of another Max disappeared with one curl of his lips.She wondered if he realized how much those eyes gave him away when he wasnt careful.She wondered if anyone ever tried to look deeper.She wondered if he wanted anyone to.Nick squeezed her shoulder.You all right?She chewed her cheek.Yeah, just thinking.You know I went to high school with him, right?Lea looked up at her cousin and saw his blond stubble catching the rays of the streetlights.What?Who?Nick gestured behind them.Max Payton.He went to Tory High School.She frowned.But  Im three years younger.I mean, I doubt he has any idea who I am.I only know him because, well, everyone knew Max when he was a senior.Popular guy.Why didnt you say anything just now?Nick shrugged.Whats the point?So he can say, I dont remember you?I was just a freshman.Doubt he ever saw me.He picked at his shirt.And he was glaring holes in my polo shirt like it personally offended him.He was just drunk.I dont know, maybe he hates horses.Lea laughed.I dont think thats it.But can you imagine him on a horse?Max is a big dude.Poor horse.Lea elbowed Nick in the ribs.Stop.Hed probably try to bench press the horse.Lea elbowed him harder.Nick, stop!Nick chuckled and squeezed her shoulder again before dropping his arm.So, thats kind of funny he thought we were dating.Lea wrinkled her nose.Ew.Nick scrunched his lips to the side.I mean, were not actually related by blood, so ...he waggled his eyebrows.Seriously, ew.And you have a girlfriend.Threesome?Nick.He bumped her with his hip and laughed as they climbed the stairs to his place.When they opened the door, Nicks girlfriend, Trish, bounded up from the couch.Finally!What took you guys so long?Im starving.She grabbed the box from Nick and immediately began to dish out slices onto paper plates.Lea took her plate and sat on the beanbag chair, tucking her legs under her.Trish sat across from her and when Nick sat down, he gave Trish a soft kiss on the forehead.Theyd started dating sophomore year in high school, and the affection between them melted Leas heart every time.So, Lea and I are together now, Nick started, and my name is Polo, and I am a crappy boyfriend who takes her on convenience store dates.Trish froze with her pizza halfway to her mouth.What are you talking about?We ran into Max Payton and ...Nick turned to Lea.Wait, how do you know him?He used to date my friend Kat, who is now dating his friend Alec.Nick blinked.Lea picked off a slice of pepperoni and dropped it into her mouth.Its kind of a long story.Alec Stone goes here too?Nick asked.Oh yeah, I guess you know him, too.He and Max went to high school together.Small world, Trish said.Nick shrugged.A lot of kids from surrounding high schools apply here.He looked at Lea.And can we talk about how he was flirting with you?Lea snapped her head back.In what world was that flirting?He was an asshole.Wait, what happened?Trish asked.Nick held up a hand.Okay, I admit it was a poor attempt.But he didnt like my arm around her shoulder, Ill tell you that, Nick muttered.Lea rolled her eyes.I dont think Max has a problem picking up girls, so if he wanted to be effective, he would have been.Nick picked at the cheese on his pizza.I dont know, maybe he didnt want to be.Im really confused right now, Trish said.Lea shifted on the beanbag chair.Me too.Nick looked up.Im not saying its mature, but sometimes, when a guy wants a girl but knows he doesnt have a shot?Well, hes kind of a dick.Lea narrowed her eyes.Max has no interest in me.Nick cocked his head.Seriously!Lea threw up her hands.There is no way.Why?Because ...She pressed her lips together.Nicks previous girlfriend was Kat.Beautiful, effervescent, nothing seriousuntil she met AlecKat.Lea was ...well, cynical and a little grumpy sometimes and wouldnt stand by while Max acted the asshole.She waved her hands.I think Im done with this conversation.Nicks opened his mouth, but Trish knocked his knee with hers, so he rolled his eyes and took another bite of pizza.But as they talked about classes and Nick imitated his professors deep tenor, all Lea could think about was that hopeful glint shed seen in Maxs eyes for that brief moment.No matter how much she tried to deny it to herself, she wanted to see it again.
