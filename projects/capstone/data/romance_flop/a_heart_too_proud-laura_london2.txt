To avoid waking the twins I tiptoed over the threshold, but I heard Christa whisper, Is that you, Lizzie?Yes it is, pet.Go to sleep now.Lizzie, Cleo was scratching at the door so I let her out.But when I called her she ran off toward the big house.Dont worry then, Christa, I will bring her back.Go to sleep now.I retraced my steps back toward the house, calling softly for Cleo.I decided to look toward the side of the house, where Cleo liked to dig for field mice in the weeds.But when I arrived there was no sign of the errant puppy.Suddenly there was a scrape and a rattle and something dropped in front of me, seemingly from out of the sky.When I bent down to pick it up, it turned out to be a piece of shingling from the roof.Ladders dont knock off shingles, and Cleo cant climb walls, I thought to myself nervously.I looked up toward the roof.No doubt about it, there was a man, or the form of a man, standing on the roof.He, or it, was facing away from me and was moving laterally, silently, across the edge of the roof.I resolved to follow it at a safe distance.It would do no good to call for help until I was sure I had seen what I thought I had.I began walking, keeping the form in view some paces ahead of me, until it disappeared at the corner of the house.Had it flown off into the air like some wild ghost?Or if it was a man, had he only crossed to the other side of the roof?I walked on a little farther until I too had reached the corner of the house.Cleo was digging underneath the lilacs there.I was very glad to see her.Cleo, I said, help me find the scary ghost.My voice sounded unnatural and brave in the night.Cleo looked up and then continued with her worrying.I bent closer to remove the object from her teeth, then held the thing curiously.In stunned horror I realized that what I held was a human hand!In the instant that this knowledge hit my consciousness another hand came to lie lightly on my shoulder and the scream that poured from my throat was a lusty one indeed.Theres no need to shriek, you foolish child.Im not going to hurt you.Not five minutes ago I had thought that if I never saw the Marquis of Lorne again it would be much too soon for me.Now I almost wept with gratitude.A hand, I gasped rather incoherently.He stretched out an impatient arm to help me to my feet and I tried again.Theres a hand under the lilac bush.He went then and looked where I had pointed.I heard him curse softly under his breath as he pulled me roughly to my feet.With one sinewy arm about my shoulders he half dragged me across the grass to the kitchen door with Cleo running at my heels.He called Mrs.Goodbody sharply and thrust me into her arms as she came running.*** The next morning I woke puffy eyed and headachy.The events of the evening before had kept me away from my cot far beyond the usual hour.And being the discoverer of a dead man does not induce the most restful of slumbers, I assure you.The hand under the lilac bush had been connected to the body of a man with a broken neck.Henri, the French cook, had whipped his last souffl.Mrs.Goodbody had taken one glance at my wan face at breakfast and sent me back to bed for the balance of the morning.When I woke the second time I felt better and didnt wince when I heard a determined rap on the cottage door.I pulled down my quilt and rose.Yes?I called.Its Christopher, came a masculine voice.Your sisters are eager to picnic and Mrs.Goodbody said that I should come and wake you.Oh, thank you, I returned, though I felt shy.After what I had heard last night outside the window, I was embarrassed to face Christopher.At least he didnt know that I had eavesdropped.It was some consolation.Yet it didnt seem proper to go off merrymaking the day after someone had died right here on our very grounds, and I said as much to Christopher as I tied the frayed ribbons of my second best bonnet under my chin.Dont be a goose, replied Christopher, sounding muffled but sensible through the door.Henri was related to no one hereI daresay you hadnt even met him.What happened is a shame but we can scarcely mourn a man none of us knew.Uncle Nicky will do whats proper for Henris remains, you can be sure of that.I doubted that very much.Last night the Marquis of Lorne had shown little inclination to trouble himself with the business.When the squire, who is justice of the peace, arrived to examine the particulars of the matter last night, the marquis had suggested with freezing boredom that surely the matter could be handled as expeditiously as possible.Squire Macready, as cringing a sycophant as any you will find, had hastily agreed.He had no sooner listened to my sketch of the nights events (my eavesdropping carefully omitted) than he had pompously pronounced it obvious that Henri had been attempting to gain entry to Lord Dearbornes bedroom for the purposes of robbery when he had fallen to his death.It was clear to me that his opinion owed more to his desire to accommodate Lord Dearborne than to his own convictions.Lizbeth, are you going to dream away the whole day?Come on, yelled my sister Caro peremptorily.I grabbed up a worn coverlet to sit upon and stepped out, squinting in the bright sunlight.The twins were standing, impatiently shifting about, with an oversized picnic hamper between them.Christopher stood nearby, his stylishly cropped brown hair tousled by the breeze.He gave me a smile that was at once so boyish and warm that my reserve melted away and I cheerfully took his proffered arm.Good morning, everyone, I said.Tis afternoon, slug a bed, teased Caro.So it is, I said.The sun streamed down from Olympian heights as we walked lazily to the back meadow, the twins merrily scattering a small herd of lambs.A meadowlark piped from somewhere in the woods to the west and the pungent odor of clover mixed with trampled sheep dung.We passed next to a low forest of brush and a bramble bush reached out to grab a bite from my gown.The thorns had just put out leaves to disguise their small sabers.One must tread warily past them.Finally we reached the shade of our favorite elder tree.Its branches leaned over a twinkling stream bordered with reeds.Spreading out the coverlet on a comfortable cushion of moss, we sat down and I gave the twins and Christopher an account of my nocturnal adventures.Afterward Christopher whistled, but respectfully gave his considered opinion that I should let be.Well, of course Ill let be.Theres nothing I can do.But here is a man dead and all Lord Dearborne can think is how hes being kept from his bed.It was callous, Christopher, and I dont think the full story has come out.And what was a cook doing on the roof?returned Christopher with a knowing air.Making soup from starlight?But Christopher, thats the point.Im not sure that it was Henri on the roof.I could barely make out that it was a man, much less the mans face.When I tried to explain that to the squire he looked at me like I was a chair with its springs popping out.I tell you, hell never properly investigate because Lord Dearborne does not want the matter pursued.The squire dissolved into a slithering jelly in front of Lord Dearborne, I finished in disgust.If Uncle Nicky doesnt want the thing looked into then theres an end to it.He never does anything without a good reason, I promise you.How do you think that he got to be one of the most important men in the War Office?Influence!I said firmly.Youre far off there.Mfather always said that Uncle Nicky was one of the brightest young men in government.Said he had a knack for organization combined with a quick eye for detail.Thats the kind of men they want running the country.Damn, girl, your countrys in a state of siege.Do you think theyd want a bunch of titled nodcocks minding the store?Quick eye for the ladies, too, shot in Caro, who had been busy untangling her fishing line.The innkeepers wife said it was musical bedrooms when he stayed there with Lady Doran.Christopher raised his eyebrows meaningfully at me, but as I rarely discipline the twins I remained silent.The innkeepers wife ought to be ashamed of herself repeating fudge like that around a little poppet like you, growled Christopher.Ill wager that she didnt know she was repeating it around Caro, I said, casting a shrewd eye over my unrepentant sister.Besides, if people dont want to get talked about then they ought not to do things that people will want to talk about.Of all the prim What do you expect a man to do, live like a monk?asked Christopher indignantly.I was coyly silent for a moment and then replied as prissily as I possibly could, Happily, I know nothing of men or the way they live.Surely that you would have the indelicacy to raise such a subject to me shows that you have no regard for my sensibilities.In short, sir, I find you shocking!I quickly buried my head in my hands to hide my laughterthe sight of his mortified face had been too much for me.Elizabeth!I beg your so sorry pray do not be upset.Why you imp, I believe youre laughing.He pried my fingers away from my mouth.You are laughing.Christopher smiled down on me dazedly, like one charmed.He sat down next to me, and then, becoming aware that he was still holding my fingers, released them hurriedly.You oughtnt to look like that, makes a fellow feel like hes been hit over the head with a two by four.Nor blush like that either, has the same effect.Caro finished untangling her fishing line and walked over to the stream to drop it in.Is there to be an inquest, Lizzie?Yes.Next week at the Tenterly courthouse.And the squire says that I will have to testify.Christa looked at me with awe.Wont you be afraid to speak in front of all the people?Im more likely to grow puffed up with my own importance, from all the attention, like poor Niobe, who suffered a most painful fate.My sisters deserted their fishing rods to come and sit across from Christopher and me.Tell us about Niobe, Lizzie, cmon, do      Four The twins and I spent most of the next week getting to know Christopher, who seemed as pleased in our company as we were with his.By the second day we were calling him Kit, and by the third we had exchanged stories of how we had lost our parents.Christophers mother had died in a runaway carriage when he was seven.The loss of his father was still rawChristopher told us bleakly that he had been shot by housebreakers only six months ago.In spite of his loss, Christopher was as open and unaffected as Lord Dearborne was cold and withdrawn.Not that I saw much of the marquis; he stayed only a few days before returning to London to more sophisticated amusements and, so Christopher averred, his government responsibilities.To Christopher, Lord Dearborne was all things.Kit plainly worshipped the man, to no degree less than did Squire Macready.It was Uncle Nicky this and Uncle Nicky that with Kit.I thought glumly that there was at least one bone I would have picked with Uncle Nicky if I had the chance: The marquis had sent workmen from London to undertake long needed repairs to the estate.They were rough city bred types who seemed to be everywhere, turning up at unexpected places.They were near the gatehouse when we took Christopher to see the new litter of kittens.One man came to hammer in the stables when I was feeding the old cob a carrot, and the same man went into Tenterly with us on the day of the inquest, saying that he needed to purchase some more building materials.In short, I got an uncanny feeling of being spied on.I should have been glad to have the men there making those repairs to the neglected buildings of Barfrestlybut I wasnt.I felt tiny fingers of resentment prodding at me.Before Lord Dearbornes arrival we had done very well, thank you.There had been no pesky workmen, no corpses in the bushes, and no coldly mocking blue eyes to disturb my dreams.I decided that, perhaps, my unaccustomed tension was due to the upcoming inquest over Henris death.I had been assured and reassured by everyone from Mrs.Goodbody to the squire that there was nothing to fear, that I would merely have to tell my story of the events immediately leading to the discovery of Henris body and then answer a few simple questions.Still, Caro had read me well in guessing that I was shy at speaking before so many people.There is something unnerving about being the center of attention at a legal proceeding.Fortified with an egg and bacon breakfast and a new Sunday bonnet, I set off for Tenterly in Lord Dearbornes elegant carriage, Christopher and Caro on either side of me and Mrs.Goodbody and Christa across from us.Riding in this magnificent equipage had gone a fair way toward reconciling me to the trip.What lady could fail to be pleased by a ride in a carriage out of a fairy tale?My sisters leaned perilously out the window to shout greetings to passersby and to laugh at their expressions of awe at seeing those Cordell gals riding in such splendor.I had laughed that morning as Mrs.Goodbody had packed a bottle of smelling salts in her reticule, possibly on the conviction that the inquest would leave me with a fit of the vapors.If the truth be told, however, there was a moment in the inquest when I was afraid that I might really end up requiring the services of that ominous little brown bottle.As I sat on the stand giving my testimony, having sworn on a Bible to tell the truth, my narrative reached the point where I had seen the shadow and walked to investigate under the library window.The squire interjected, and did you hear anything just then?I of course took him literally for a moment and, blushing to the roots of my hair, I thought he wished me to recount the humiliating conversation between the marquis and Christopher concerning myself.I would rather have eaten all the ribbons on my new Sunday bonnet.But I had sworn on the Bible to tell the whole truth, so it was either relate the conversation or go to hell!Thinking that never again would I be able to hold my head up in Tenterly, I closed my eyes and started to speak.Mercifully, the squires voice interrupted me to clarify that he only wondered if I had heard any footsteps or noises on the roof at that point.Saved by the donkeys bray!There were several others that gave evidence after me, including Roger and the coroner, though no new evidence came forth.After only eight minutes of deliberation the jury returned with a verdict of death by misadventure, just as the squire had predicted.Henri had been French and as we were at war with France, people were only too ready to believe anything bad of a Frenchman.I have no patience with that type of national prejudice, but what could I do?I knew nothing that would exonerate the poor chef from the posthumous charge of attempted robbery.I had never even met the man.I was glad to leave the musty courtroom behind and step into the fresh breezes that blew upon Tenterlys High Street.Here, surrounded by half timbered houses, pubs, and small shops, one can see the tall spire of the church tower.It dwarfs everything around it into insignificance, which is not such an unpleasant feeling sometimes.Christopher, the twins, Mrs.Goodbody, and I went to the White Lion for tea.We sat down and got cozy after Mrs.Goodbody had quieted the twins, and began talking over the events of the day.My mind was wavering in and out of the conversation, when I heard Caro speak, in her forthright way, to Christopher.Why, Kit, she said.Whatever are you looking at?Christopher was indeed staring intently out the window, even rising into a half crouch, suddenly oblivious to what was taking place around him.We were all growing very much alarmed, and I turned to look out the window myself, thinking I was missing some momentous occurrence.Perhaps the Prince Regent himself was passing by the inn with his entire entourage and I was missing it.But no, it was only Dr.Brent, standing and talking to one of the workmen from the estate, out in the road.Who is that man?said Christopher.That straight backed, distinguished fellow standing in the road?He looks familiar to me.Why, thats only Dr.Brent, I told him.Hes not half so distinguished as he looks.Who is Dr.Brent?he said, still staring out the window.Only the new assistant to Dr.Lindham in the area, said Caro disparagingly.Christopher appeared to relax.Just then Dr.Brent turned, observed us all gawking at him through the window, gave us a huge smile and wave, and walked into the inn to stand beside our table.He was indeed a forward gentleman.Elizabeth, Mrs.Goodbody, and the dear little girls, he said, his eyes twinkling.And this must be the new guest at Barfrestly I have heard abouta sturdy young man to hold the walls up while the marquis is away.Christopher extended his hand.Christopher Warrington is the name, Dr.Brent.Pleased to meet you.Whatever had made Christopher feel ill at ease had vanished when Dr.Brent presented himself, and they soon fell into an easy banter.I was surprised at how well they hit it off until it occurred to me that what I was seeing was the well mannered interplay of two determinedly charming people, and that all they did have in common was their late residence in London.Dr.Brent had taken his medicals there and Christopher had lived there with his family.I supposed this was London manners in action.I was surprised at the skill with which Christopher handled sociable small talk and it brought home to me that, though I was an aristocrat by birth as he was, our differences in upbringing were pronounced.He had been raised to his station, where I had been raised to be a simple country girl, polite in my way, but perhaps a little too direct and obvious.I felt like an openmouthed bumpkin as I followed the banter between Christopher and Dr.Brent.I heard you had some excitement at your house lately?said Dr.Brent.His face was solemn but his eyes were twinkling in a way I did not really find amusing considering the ordeal I had been through.Miss Elizabeth looks rather petite to be confronting housebreakers, trespassers, and things that go bump in the night.That last remark brought my chin up.Though his face was solemn I could detect a real note of mockery in his eyes.I dont think the entire story of the cooks death came out in the inquest, I said defiantly.It seemed to me that his eyes narrowed slightly, but perhaps he was only squinting at a sunbeam deflected from outside.I could detect no change in his easy manner.He leaned his hands on the table, bent forward, and looked intently into my face.Tell me, Miss Elizabeth, what is the real story of what happened that night?Im not sure, I retreated.It just seems to me that people were too easy with their judgments because the cook was French.His smile widened perceptibly.I stifled an unladylike desire to grind my teeth.I had already felt behind in the conversation, and now my ego was really bruised at being made sport of like a foolish child.I longed to recoup my stock in this entire enterprise.I just dont consider the case closed, thats all, I declared ringingly, with much more bravado than I was actually feeling.So you are setting yourself up in competition with the Bow Street Runners, Miss Elizabeth?said Dr.Brent, smirking.It did nothing for my temper that I could think of no very clever comeback to this snide remark.Why was the man so obnoxious?We teased in my family, yes, but only for fun, not to humiliate.Caros hand stole underneath the table and softly patted mine.Christopher, reading my frustration and distress, changed the subject, and kept the conversation away from me until the coach arrived to take us back to Barfrestly.As we rumbled down the road in the big carriage, Caro patted my hand again and spoke.Never mind that horrid Mr.Medicine Menace, Lizzie.He was just trying to show off, making fun of you like that.Mrs.Goodbody clucked mildly.Im sure he meant no harm, dears.Gentlemen, she proclaimed importantly, will have their jokes.Well, I retorted, if thats an example of their jokes, than the less I see of gentlemen, the better!*** I hummed as I poured water into the old porcelain washbasin the next morning.My good mood sprouted like spring flowers after a May rainfall.I realized that I had put the inquest and all that went with it behind me.God bless the Fates for restoring me to my accustomed serenity.I think that because I feel pain so deeply when it strikes me, some merciful natural balance prevents me from feeling it for too long.That day, Caro, Christa, and I were to begin work on our annual theatrical production.Every year since my twelfth birthday, I had written and directed a play as a parish fund raising activity.It was presented on the same day as the church bazaar, and I must admit that it is usually one of the bazaars most popular attractions.Though our modest productions could never play Drury Lane, to the people of our parish who hardly ever see a show of any kind, they are a source of much enjoyment.The whole parish eagerly inundates us with ideas and suggestions that are often as humorous as they are impractical.This production was to be the most ambitious since three summers ago when we had put on The Plagues Visited Upon Egypt and the Subsequent Exodus of the Hebrew People to the Promised Land.We had decided to pull out all the stops with a play so grandiose that it would, we hoped, leave our audience in a state of rapt amazement.We planned to enact The Battle of Hastings Culminating the Norman Invasion of England in the Year of Our Lord 1066.Unfortunately, the only thing in scarcity for our productions were those few souls fearless enough to risk forgetting their lines and embarrassing themselves before the village.So far we only had a scant half dozen ferocious Norman invaders.I was stuck with the role of King Harold.No one else wanted to be the loser.Jane Coleman was to be the lachrymose Queen Edith.She showed a regrettable tendency to giggle when the news of her husbands death was brought to her by the wounded messenger (Christa).The role of William the Conqueror was yet unfilled because every potential applicant had declared that the part had too many long speeches to memorize.I was beginning to think that I would have to cut out some of my most cherished declamations.I had taken particular care in writing Williams part, for I have always felt rather sorry for him.The only way that I can account for this strange partiality is that he is an unpopular figure in British history and I have what Caro says is a maudlin tendency to sympathize with the underdog.I brought the problem up to Christopher as we walked down the lane together.So here I am, having to choose which precious lines will go.I feel like a poor mother who has to decide which of her children will go to work in the city, I told him in melancholy accents.Why cut any lines?Right at your doorstep is an actor willing to do lengthy speeches all day if only to please you, little Elizabeth, Christopher said solemnly, with teasing eyes.If you mean Mrs.Goodbody, I can assure you that nothing would induce her Why I believe you mean yourself!You must be jesting!I was amazed.Hazy as my notions of the proper behavior for young bluebloods were, I knew that nothing could be more shocking than for one to appear in a public theatrical.So I told Christopher, who laughed so hard that he almost fell into a ditch.What a peagoose you are, sweetheart, he said.If its proper for you then it can hardly be too scandalous for me.I replied huffily that I had only been trying to protect his reputation, but saw that this only threatened to set him off again.Well, its true for all that, Christopher.I dont have a reputation to lose.As far as society is concerned I am nobody.If your guardian heard that you were going to act in public he would think it an unbecoming prank and yank you out by the ear.I had expected a grin to answer this sally, but to my surprise he grew quiet.After a minute he said, very gently: Elizabeth, dont go saying youre a nobody because it aint true.He paused reflectively and his face brightened.Damn if I dont set out to prove it to you, too.Considerably intrigued, I teased him to tell just how he meant to set about this mysterious task, when we were interrupted by mischievous Cleo who had flushed a partridge from the underbrush beside the lane.There was a great deal of commotion as the twins tried to retrieve the triumphant puppy before she damaged Mother Partridges hidden nest.We were on our way to the village to pick up a large piece of lumber that the blacksmith was donating to the production.It was destined to become the historical vessel that carried the invading Norman army to the English shore.The village is more accurately called a hamlet.It nestles in a valleys dip about half an hours brisk walk from Barfrestly Estate and rejoices in the name of Mudbury.You may laugh, but it is surely no worse than being called Broughton Poggs, Bumpstead, or Sparrowpit, which also number among Englands more than thirteen thousand villages.Mudbury is a hamlet of such great charm that I think it picturesque, and I have lived close by it all my life!A tidy row of whitewashed cottages cuddles cozily about the little church with its Gothic stone cross.Separated from the buildings by a trim yew hedge, there slopes a wide piece of common land, now bright with marsh marigolds.As the lane turned abruptly into the village, we were hailed by my friend Jane Coleman, hanging out a washing on a clothesline behind their cottage.After introducing Christopher to Jane, the twins took him across the village square and then disappeared behind a stone built barn where the blacksmith carried out his trade.Jane and I sat together on the overturned clothesbasket to chat in the sun while they were arranging the transportation of our lumber.Fine brown curls frame Janes sweet freckled face, which reflects its owners quiet strengths and the graceful humor that she applies to everything she does, from frying bacon to being my friend.Jane had gone into the cottage for another basket of wash when, to my exasperation, I saw Cleo come tearing around the side of the barn in hot pursuit of an angry young duckling.So intent was I upon catching the miscreant spaniel that I didnt hear the drumming of hoofbeats until the horse was almost upon me.The large bay stallion had been running hard.A dash of foam from its slavering mouth landed on my sleeve as it reared to stop only inches from where I was standing.It was close enough to blot out the sun.Thank God English boys learn to ride almost before they learn to walk or this country girl would have been but a memory.I was conscious of a snarling, adolescent male voice.What in hell do you mean running under my horses hooves, you paper skulled twit?You could have been trampled!The boy dismounted and angrily shook his riding crop in my face.At that moment, Christopher rounded the corner of the barn, took in the scene, and ran up and punched the other boy in the face without a by your leave.Good for you, Kit, I thought as the reckless young rider landed in the dirt.But he was up in a flash and they were into it deep, all arms flailing like windmills, a donnybrook in the middle of the dusty road.Before too long, there was a gaggle of spectators, with the twins carrying on a running commentary, and the old village men gazing on speculatively, laying bets as to the outcome.The young riders anger had changed to fear under Christophers well trained onslaught; he was definitely getting the worst of it but refused to yield before such a crowd.Boys are funny and I shall never understand them.I was beginning to get upset.I saw Lord Peterby riding up the road on his mincing thoroughbred and I hailed him to stop and put an end to this scene of what looked to me to be incredible violence.Its really too bad that Dearborne isnt here to see this, he said.He taught the boy much of what he knows.However I love a mill though, I suppose it isnt proper for them to carry on so in the village square.Lord Peterby swung himself down easily from the saddle, entrusting his reins to the blacksmith.He walked up to the milling pair, and, placing a firm hand on each wilted collar, pulled them apart.Take a damper, you two, or Ill have you fighting in the pigsty.They turned and looked at him; Lord Peterby was apparently known to both combatants, even though they themselves had never met.He was insulting Elizabeth, Lord Lesley, said Christopher hotly.He was raising his crop at her and he called her disrespectful names.Insulting her?She ran in front of me and shied my horse!said the unknown rider, pointing at me with a bloody finger.Ah, chercher la femme, said Lord Peterby, casting his eyes heavenward.Whoever is to blame, the matter does not warrant dueling pistols at dawn, would you say, Master Jeffrey?Sir Christopher of the Roundhouse Right?The boys shook hands, apologies were made all around, and Lord Peterby made us known to Christophers erstwhile opponent, who turned out to be Jeffrey Macready, the squires oldest boy.To my amusement, the two really began to hit it off, making plans to go and have target practice the next morning.Fisticuffs one moment and friends the next!Lord Peterby remounted, advising Jeffrey to do the same if he wanted to get home in time to clean himself up before luncheon or his father would know hed been brawling.He added that he would have accompanied us home if he were not on the way to an appointment.As he spoke he ran his eyes over me in the fashion that puts one forcibly in mind of the Wolfs first view of Little Red Riding Cape.I was grateful that he had urgent business elsewhere.My goodness, Kit, said Caro on the way home, as we four struggled with the lumber.If we knew you were so ferocious we would have taken great care before this not to tease you so much.Ferocious indeed.By the time we had reached the house, Christopher had a horrible shiner, which closed his left eye and quite discolored his entire face.With his black eye and torn clothes he looked not like a member of the aristocracy, but a blind beggar who should be sitting by the roadside soliciting contributions.Poor Kit, I said with heartfelt sympathy.That must be very painful.It do sting a bit.He winced.If you want to go and get cleaned up, I shall bring you a piece of meat for poultice to keep down the swelling.That sounds good, said Christopher, walking in the direction of his room.I followed him after a bit, knocking on the door of his room with meat in hand.Its Elizabeth.Yes, come on in.His jacket was draped over the bedpost.He was standing by the washbasin cleaning his face; there was a rent in the sleeve of his shirt.If you are to be my knight errant, at least let me mend your armor for you.He shrugged himself out of the shirt and handed it negligently to me.It was then I saw the jagged red scar on the left side of his chest, just below his collarbone.Christopher, how on earth I looked up at his face, and reached out and touched the wound.He hesitated.Its just an old wound.Its not old, its recent.Tell me how this happened.Who did this to you?He looked uncomfortable, and said, Ill tell you then, but you cant repeat it to anyone.Im listening.I was with my father when he was shot and, as you can see, I caught one of the bullets myself.The men came while we were asleep; the memory is very hazy to me even though it happened just months ago.My father died that night, and they tell me I nearly died myself.I already told you my father worked in the War Office with Uncle Nicky.It seems they were after something other than mere plunder because none of our valuables were taken.Our library was left in a shambles; Fathers books were ripped apart violently, the bindings all slashed and destroyed, the pages strewn about the room.Arent you afraid theyll try and kill you again?I asked, my voice tight with horror.I dont know why they would.I certainly dont remember anyones identity.I suppose the shock must have wiped it out of my mind because I dont recall anyone wearing a mask, either.And I dont know a thing about what the men might have been after.But Uncle Nicky is having me guarded; that is why I am here and that is why he suddenly hired that crew of rough looking laborers.Among them are my bodyguards.Five The next day was a rainy, gusty Kentish day, and I lay in bed past time to get up, listening to the drops thud against the ground outside.It would turn the countryside an even deeper green, and the grasses would sparkle like a thousand jeweled ladies.Or a thousand polished daggers.I shuddered.It was an ugly story that Christopher had told me yesterday, but it hadnt frightened me so much as it had filled me with a wild righteous fury.I wanted to see the killers brought to justice.That such men had only to pull a trigger to cause so much grief and misery!A tiny breeze set the curtains aflutter as Christa came into the room.She had seen Christopher set out for target practice with Jeffreyrain or no rainand his eye looked much better.I wondered if Kit had been followed by one of the workmen bodyguards.Today we would begin work on the Norman man o war for our theatrical.We had planned to set up in the barn and paint, saw, and hammer madly away.Caro pointed out that we had better hurry our project alongif it rained any more we might need it to sail away to safety from the deluge, like Noah.The twins and I decided to meet later in the barn.First I had to finish some research in the library at Barfrestly Manor.I try to make my productions as historically accurate as possible, unless it suited my fancy to do otherwise.The admirals main library was always a treasure trove of information, full of old maps, charts, books, and treatises.Where else could I have learned that a muslin band soaked in liquefied cats dung makes an excellent depilatory (give me the hair any day) or that King Jamie had a marvelously odd fondness for young boys?I pulled a tattered wool shawl over my head and dashed through the garden, letting myself into the manor by a side door.Once inside, I dried my wet pattens on my hem.Better to dampen my skirt than one of the admirals old carpets.I stepped into the library, leaving the door ajar behind me, and then walked over to the window.The soft, moist breeze swept in from the outside and ran around the corners of the room like a sprightly child.I always felt at home here; this is where I spent much of my time on days like this.This had been my special room.The admiral had allowed me the run of the place because he knew I liked to read, and I tried to show my gratitude by keeping the books in good condition and airing the room.The admiral didnt use the room much himself as he had a small study stocked with his favorite books, which were of a highly technical military and nautical nature.I paused a moment in reverie about the old admiral.He was always described as eccentric, but I thought of him as interesting.He liked to relive his battles, and whatever you wished to converse with him about, he would always manage to lead the talk, in ways subtle or direct, to his experiences with the fleet.His last big commission had been with His Majestys fleet in the war with the American colonies, and we were always hearing about the damned Yankee Doodles.He was nearly stone deaf, probably from the din of battle, and used a speaking tube which never seemed to work very well.In his last years, therefore, he was lost at sea, tossed on the roaring storm of his own memories, never to come back to port.On a stormy winter night, when the wind would rattle the shutters and howl from the Channel, he would climb up the ivy on the side of the manor as ably as if he had once again been a twenty year old midshipman sporting in the rigging, and he would step out onto the roof.I used to see him there when I was a child, stalking back and forth with his garrick topcoat on, his hawklike face splitting the gale, shouting orders and obscenities to the imaginary topmen breaking sail in the black clouds above his head.I admired him for that, but it always caused a great commotion among the servants for fear that he would try to walk the plank and end up on the ground below with a broken neck.Like poor Henri.I put down the book I had been reading and shuddered.Like poor Henri.I had seen someone walking on the roof, and Henri had been found dead immediately afterward.I felt a sudden urge to complete my reading in our cottage in the company of Mrs.Goodbody.As I rose to my feet I heard the sound of firm footsteps in the hallway.The library door was thrust open, and Lord Nicholas Dearborne, the Marquis of Lorne, strode into the room and grabbed me by the wrist.What are you doing in here?he demanded.I hadnt even known he had returned from London.As before, his physical attractiveness hit me like a blow beneath the ribs, leaving me feeling slightly giddy.My attempt to free my wrist from his fingers caused them unconsciously to tighten their hold so that I felt shackled by iron.Do you always gape like a startled sheep whenever anyone asks you a question?he snapped, cutting the carpet from under my dignity.I think youve broken my wrist, I managed to gasp, stupidly.He released me.Staring resentfully at the marquis, I rubbed the mistreated joint.Sir, I began, attempting to restand my poise on its tottering foothold, Admiral Barfreston allowed me free access to the library and I didnt think to ask your permission before I used it again; that is, now that it is yours.I didnt even know that you had returned to Barfrestly.My voice was quite steady.If you dont wish me to use the library, you have only to say soIm aware that my sisters and I are at the mercy of your generosity, thus making your wishes of paramount concern to me.This hadnt been delivered with quite the degree of crushing scorn that I had intended, crushing scorn not being something at which I particularly shine.To my humiliation, I felt a blush rise to my cheeksthe curse of fair skin.The marquis frowned and ran a careless hand through his shining hair.You are not at the mercy of my generosity, as you so quaintly phrase it.By supporting you, I am merely fulfilling my obligations to Admiral Barfreston.Far from mollified, I tried to match the coolness of his tone as I answered, Thats what Mrs.Goodbody told us, but that is not everyones opinion.There are some people who feel that it is improper for me to receive support from someone whom I have no claim on.I saw Lord Dearbornes lip curl sardonically.Like Mrs.Plumford, I added, wanting to be specific.And who is Mrs.Plumford?asked the marquis.He crossed his arms and leaned a shoulder casually against one of the tidy bookcases.Shes Mr.Plumfords wife.The marquiss smile deepened.I could tell that he thought he was dealing with an idiot.Mr.Plumford is the parish sexton.Perhaps Mrs.Plumford is uninformed on the finer points of British law concerning inheritance.When one inherits an estate, he inherits the responsibilities and liabilities as well as the income of the estate, Lord Dearborne said suavely.In supporting you I am merely carrying out the wishes of Admiral Barfreston, in accordance with the law.I believed him.Whatever Mrs.Plumford might know about the finer points of British inheritance law, to me they were an uninteresting enigma.What the marquis said was so, must be so.Do you mind very much having me for a responsibility?I asked, looking up at the marquis.The hard temper lines around his mouth relaxed as he reached out his hand and with one long finger lightly traced the curve of my cheek.The color seemed to darken in his eyes as he regarded me thoughtfully.Very gently, his exploring fingers traveled down to stroke the sensitive skin at the back of my neck; it felt as though it melted at his touch.In fact, time itself took on a curious liquid quality.Sometimes a responsibility can also be a pleasure, he said languidly.His hand lifted and cupped one light lock of hair that had been curling against my breast.I looked down to where his hand played, and felt a strange tightening in my throat as he caressed and stroked and swirled the lock of hair, where it lay.My head began to buzz and hum; exotic sensations seemed to be washing into my body.It was as if the room had turned into a voluminous honeycomb and we were being drowned in honey.Do you mind very much being my responsibility?His words penetrated slowly and softly through the thick haze that had engulfed my consciousness, as though the pound pounding of the surf on a seashore had formed itself into a language which only I could understand.Lord Dearborne was the sea, the earth, and the spring honey, and I would be drowned and washed away whether I responded or not.There was no one to save me.I Im not sure.Dear God.Why must I stammer and speak in monosyllables?What was happening to me?I lifted my head to his, causing a tear to drop unbidden down my cheek.I blinked back further tears, hoping against hope to find the answer in his eyes.There was no answer there, only an immense azure sadness.I searched his face briefly, and abandoned the quest as the search became its own justification, as my eyes came to rest finally, inevitably, on his lips.He had asked me a question.I lifted a hand, experimentally, and placed it near his mouth, a thrill paralyzing my wrist as I felt his soft breath.His arms were around me now, and he was pulling me fully against him.I dont know you I bit my lip, unable to complete my thought.We could remedy that, couldnt we, he said.His lips were very close to mine.Suddenly, unbidden, Christophers words came back to me, just as they had been spoken in this room.I was the violet eyed filly.I disentangled myself from him, pushing weakly against his chest.Im afraid, I whispered.He raised his eyebrows slightly, slipping his fingers to steady my chin.Are you afraid?he said, looking at me strangely.You ought to be, little flower.Beauty is a dangerous gift for an innocent like you.Today is your lucky day, foolish one.Lord Dearborne picked up the book I had been holding on his entrance to the room and handed it to me.His voice was curt and impatient as he said, You may come into the library whenever you wish but run along just now.I ran.Neglecting to collect my shawl, I slipped quietly out the back door.The rain touched my shoulders like a cats paws and I shivered involuntarily, though it was not cold.The rain was pouring out of the sky, sending fine mists curling from the leaves of the trees.Foolish one.But not so foolish that I didnt understand the implications of Lord Dearbornes actions.And not so innocent that I couldnt recognize lovemaking when I was its object.Unfortunately, I was not so clever as to meet these very improper advances with the treatment they deserved.I should have screamed, fainted, and cried.I should have called for Mrs.Goodbody.I should have done anything but stand there while the marquis touched me in a fashion I was convinced would be repugnant to any gently bred lady of sensibility.I reflected gloomily on my lack of femininity.Why had I become so confused and passive when Lord Dearborne touched me?Because he was a practiced rake, I told myself severely, resolving to avoid him as much as possible in the future.I made my way toward the old barn where a light burned through the slats.The twins were there, working on the boat.Christopher was there also, sitting on a mound of hay, Joe Hawkinss ancient fowling piece next to him.Lizzie, wherever have you been?chorused the twins.Weve been looking everywhere for you.We thought you had gotten washed away in the flood.I believe she has been washed away, said Christopher.Come and get dry, Lizbeth, you look like a wet rag.I sat next to him on the hay.Taking off his coat, he flung it over my shoulders and patted my wet hair with a piece of toweling.A drop of water ran down my nose, pausing a moment before leaping off into the dry dust on the barn floor.I sneezed.How was your target practice?I wondered.Did you hit the target?
