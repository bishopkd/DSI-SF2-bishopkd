Weve both had too much to drink.I didnt agree with him, but I nodded anyway.Protesting seemed futile at this point, not to mention that Im not the type of girl that begs guys to sleep with her.Good night then, I said, backing away reluctantly.Sweet dreams, Charley.Nick came close again, this time to kiss me on the cheek.He flashed me one last killer smile and then disappeared down the hall.An hour later I was snuggled deep beneath the covers of my temporary bed, trying in vain to fall asleep.The last few hours had dredged up a lot of feelings I hadnt allowed to the surface in a long time  fear about what happened that day ten years ago, grief over losing Tim and guilt for being the one that survived.But what kept me awake long after I had pushed those other feelings away had nothing to do with my past and had everything to do with Nick Cooper.My last serious relationship ended two years ago, and had lasted just short of five months.Both of us had known it wasnt going to last forever and we had been more than okay with that.I had dated a few men off and on since then, none of them seriously and none of them for longer than a few dates.One thing they all had in common was that I had never opened up to any of them about my past.I had known Nick for less than a week and had let him see the darkest, most hidden parts of me.Even more concerning, I didnt regret it.I liked talking to Nick, liked being around him, and I really liked kissing him.Needless to say, I was a little disconcerted when I woke the next morning and found myself alone in the house.I did a quick check of every room but Nick was nowhere to be found.His car was still parked in front of the house so he probably hadnt gone very far.After a long, hot shower, I made myself at home and got the coffee pot brewing.I was just pouring my first cup when the back door flew open and Nick appeared, sweaty and smiling.Youre up!As are you.I tried not to stare as he lifted the bottom of his shirt to wipe sweat from his face.An undeniably fit torso taunted my wandering eyes.Morning run?No better way to start the day.He dropped his shirt back into place.I beg to differ.I lifted my coffee and took a long sip.Cant argue with that.Let me just take a quick shower and then Ill join you.The naughty Charley inside me almost said, How about I join you instead?But good Charley kept her in check and Nick left the room alone.I grew restless waiting for Nick so I took my coffee outside and strolled down to the beach.The water lapped gently against the rugged shoreline.The steady motion and gentle sound was soothing, a piece of calm in my otherwise chaotic life.I was so taken away by the moment that I didnt realize Nick had joined me until I felt his arm brush against mine.I thought I might find you out here.His hand found mine and he gave it a soft squeeze.In khakis and a baby blue sweater that clung to the contours of his body, damp hair blowing in the breeze, Nick looked like he had stepped out of a romance novel.Is this how you spend all your weekends?Relaxing in secluded beach houses?Not as many as I would like.Nick took the mug I was still holding and finished the last of the coffee.Lets go into town and get some breakfast.We have a long day ahead of us.We didnt have to discuss where we would eat breakfast because the town only had one small diner, located on Main Street, naturally.Nick was clearly a regular there and we were seated at his usual table in the corner.None of the other patrons seemed very impressed by the presence of the most popular senator in America eating breakfast in their local diner.After a gluttonous amount of food and several cups of coffee, we took a lazy stroll through town.Nick told me about his familys trips to the area when he was a boy.His dad would drive their old station wagon down the coast and they would stop at all the small towns along the way.One time, he actually left me at a gas station about a mile from here.Nick laughed at the memory.On purpose?It didnt sound very funny to me.No, not on purpose.He had four young kids to wrangle and he didnt realize I hadnt gotten back in the car after we stopped for a bathroom break.My older brother, Shawn, knew I was still inside but he thought it would be funny to leave me there.Nick laughed again.He always was a bit of a sociopath.What did you do when you realized they were gone?I was ten years old  too old to start crying and too young to start panicking.So I just sat on the curb and waited for them to come back.I waited for over an hour.Your dad must have been so worried when he found out you were missing.Ive only ever seen him that upset one other time in my life.Nicks smile was gone and for the first time it occurred to me that he might be carrying a past as dark as my own.When?The word came out as barely a whisper but in that moment it might as well have been a gun shot.The day he told us that our mom was dead.Nick glanced at me and he could see the question in my eyes.He answered it without me saying a word.Suicide.I was seven at the time, so I didnt really understand what that meant.It wasnt until I was older that I realized she had chosen to leave us.And then a few years after that I understood that she had been sick in a different kind of way and her death hadnt really been a choice at all.When I looked at him, I could see that confused little boy, struggling to understand what had happened to his mother.I wanted to wrap my arms around him, wanted to take away that pain.But life doesnt come with an eraser.Instead of hugging Nick I said, Life really sucks sometimes.Sometimes it does.He paused and looked at me with an intense and indecipherable expression.But other times its pretty amazing.Is it?Nick sounded so certain, so optimistic, I wanted nothing more than to believe him.Yes.He hooked a finger through one of my belt loops and pulled me toward him.And Im going to spend the rest of the weekend proving it to you.That sounds promising.I smiled as I leaned into his warm body.You should know Im going to need a lot of convincing.Nicks arms went around me and he leaned in close enough that our noses were almost touching.Challenge accepted, Charlotte Tanner.Aware that we were still in public, both of us exercised a modicum of restraint as our lips met and our bodies pressed together.After our PG 13 moment, Nick led us across town to the beach.It was too cold for anyone to be in the water but the shore was speckled with the occasion couple having a picnic or group of friends tossing a football.We found a relatively quiet place and sat in the sand, watching the water and the people around us.Nick did most of the talking, turning into a little boy before my eyes as he talked about his interests  travel, baseball and nerdy science fiction books.I spent a lot of time teasing him about the last one.We couldnt all be the popular kids in school, Nick replied after one of my more brutal jabs.Pretty girls like you spent your days ignoring me so I spent a lot of time with my nose in a book.I happened to like nerds back then, I said, elbowing him lightly in the ribs.I still do obviously.Obviously?He mocked hurt.Once a nerd always a nerd.Well I think weve talked enough about me.Nick dusted sand from his hands.Your turn.I was not a nerd.Thats all you really need to know.I smiled sweetly and hoped that would be enough for him.I had done my share of storytelling last night and wasnt in the mood to relive that experience.Nick wasnt going to give up that easily.Okay so if you werent a nerd, what were you?Cheerleader?Jock?Musician?I dont believe in labels.You dont have to believe in them to belong to one of them, Nick quipped lightly.Im going to take your reluctance to talk about it to mean that you were actually an even bigger nerd than me.Take it whatever way you want.The annoyance in my voice was hard to ignore but that didnt stop him.Mathlete?Nick.Let it go, okay?I dont want to play this game anymore.I attempted to stand up but Nick was quick to grab my arm and hold me in place.Charley, dont get upset.Im just trying to learn more about you.Nick kept his grip on me until he felt me relax back into the sand.We can change the topic of conversation.Books?Reality television?Bad dates?He was being so sweet and earnest that even my heart of ice began to melt.Class president, I said in defeat.
