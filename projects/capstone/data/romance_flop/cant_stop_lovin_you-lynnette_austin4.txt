The heat and the storm passed.She waited for her heartbeat to slow and reminded herself again why this was dangerous.Every minute spent with Brawley was like playing with fire.The only result of that?You got burned.They declined dessert.Maggies got a long drive back to Lone Tree, Mom.Karolyn insisted on wrapping a plate of leftovers for her.Brawleys parents stood together in the front yard, the porch light behind them, waving good bye.The temperature had dropped off, and Maggie hugged herself as she hurried to the SUV.Neither of them spoke on the way home.Brawley navigated effortlessly through the dark, and she closed her eyes.As wonderful as tonight had been, it had stirred up some powerful memories.A Chris Young song spilled out of the vehicles sound system, and Maggie hummed along with it.On the outskirts of town, she remembered she needed to stop by Dotties.She wanted to use the buttons from her first wedding gown on this new one.A piece of her past carrying her into her future.Before you drop me at my car, would you mind terribly stopping by Dotties?Its getting late, and No problem.Ill only be two seconds.Fine.A few minutes later, he pulled into the drive.Maggie hopped out and ran to the door.Brawley got out, too, and sat on the stairs to wait.Dottie came to the door, a quizzical expression on her face.Hey, Maggie.Brawley.Did you two come together?Weve been running errands, Maggie said quickly.Here was the trouble with small towns.Your business became everyones business.I thought Id pick up the buttons while I was in town.Let me grab them.Dottie stepped inside, and Maggie heard a drawer open and close.Here you go.She handed Maggie a baggie.Thanks, Dottie.This is a great idea.She nodded toward the living room where light flickered from the TV and a battle cry rang out.Everybody got in okay today?Yep.Theyre all in the living room watching an old Star Wars movie Wes left behind.She grinned.Sure is nice having them all here.Enjoy them.Maggie hugged her tightly.Night.Night.Night, Brawley.Night, Dottie, Brawley called out.Maggie started to the SUV, but he crooked a finger at her.Come upstairs with me.No.Geez, dont get all prickly.Thought you might want to see the apartment now that my furniture is moved in.Maybe another day.Arent you the least bit curious?Damn him.She was.He knew her too well.Knew which bells to ring.Just a quick peek, then I have to go.He hustled up the stairs, and she followed more slowly.By the time she reached the landing, he had the door unlocked and the kitchen light on.She stepped inside.Wow.She wouldnt have recognized it.Annie had turned the place into a very eclectic Tiffany blue jewel box.Very feminine, fun, and colorful.Brawley had gone sleek and modern.White leather and dark fabrics.Masculine and sophisticated against the gray walls.She turned to tell him she loved it and found him all but plastered to her.Her hand came up to rest on his chest.Back up, Brawley.Give me space.Cant we talk?Not now.Not tonight.When?Talking wont change anything.She stopped.Whats this?Crossing the room, she picked up a battered copy of Where the Red Fern Grows.Opening it to the title page, she read the message her sixteen year old self had written.To love, deep and true.Yours forever, Maggie  I couldnt throw it away, Brawley said.Do you keep trophies from all your girls?Thats both unfair and out of line.Anger rang in his voice.You didnt answer the question.His jaw tightened.No, Maggie, I dont.Just one.He pulled her to him and backed her into the wall.Before she could utter a sound, he was kissing her.He took her breath away.Her legs went rubbery, but he held her in place.Oh, God.When he finally lifted his head, he said, I wont apologize for that.Good.Then I wont apologize for this.She wrapped a hand around his neck and drew him close for anotherand another.Breaking contact, she found herself more shaken than shed imagined possible.Stay tonight, Maggie.I cant.What are you doing?You run hot and cold.She pressed fingers to her forehead.I know!And I will apologize for that.Im trying like hell to avoid you, but you wont let me.This physical thing between usit just takes over.Makes me forget what I want, what I dont.But its chemistry, Brawley, pure and simple.Its more than that and you know it, he growled.Maybe.Maybe?Oh, he was pissed.Time to call it a night.Do you want to drive me to my car, or should I ask Dottie for a ride?Ill take you.He grabbed his keys from the counter and jerked the door open with so much force she was amazed it didnt come off the hinges.The silence took on a hard edge as they drove through Maverick Junction.When he pulled up to her car, she hopped out before he could move around to get her door.Without a word, she slid into her Chrysler and started the engine.Brawley idled in his black SUV as she drove off.His headlights shone in her rearview mirror, almost daring her to outrun them.Shed come so close to giving into him, to herself.What had she been thinking?Ten  Saturday morning dawned bright and clear.Down the hall, Maggie heard the shower start.Good.Pops was awake.She hoped hed slept well last night.Today was his wedding day.Slipping out of bed, she padded to the window.She fingered the drape aside, raised her eyes to the sky, and imagined Grandma Trudy on one of the clouds in the sea of blue.Grandma, I hope this is okay with you, she whispered.Pops still loves you, and he always will.We all will.But hes lonely.Dottie will take care of him for you.A single tear plopped onto her hand.Sniffling, she swiped at her eyes.Enough.The only tears allowed today were happy ones.They had a wedding to celebrate.She rested her forehead against the glass pane.White pickets fenced in the yard below, and a rabbit nibbled at tender new shoots of grass along the driveway.A weathered picnic table huddled in the shade of an oak.As a child shed played for hours in this yard.Pops and Grandma taught her to ride her bike without training wheels on the paved drive.She and her parents had picnicked at that table many Sundays after church.Her grandmothers potato salad couldnt be matched.Today marked a beginningand an end.A realist, she understood nothing would ever be quite the same.Come tonight, Dottie would be part of the family, the Sullivans and the Willises joined.Maggie tried to imagine how Pops must be feeling, what he was thinking this morning.Hed loved his Trudy with all his heart.But he also loved Dottie Willis, and this afternoon, in her lovely garden, surrounded by friends and family, he would take her as his bride.Was he looking forward or back?Maggie guessed a little of both.He couldnt help comparing this day to a long ago day when, as a young man with his entire life in front of him, hed taken another woman to wife.She turned from the window to the picture on her dresser of a very young Trudy and Fletcher Sullivan.Her father sat on Grandmas lap.Maggie missed her grandmother.Missed her gentle touch, her often acidic remarks.Her down to earth practicality.Most of all, she missed her unconditional love.Okay.She blinked rapidly.Hadnt she promised not to cry?Grabbing her robe, she tossed it on.Running fingers through her disheveled hair, she hurried down the hall and knocked at the bathroom door.Pops?Yeah?Want some coffee?Love some, honey.Its a big day, Grandpa.Yes, it is.He cleared his throat.Been thinking about your grandma.Me, too.Im not making a mistake, am I?No.The medicine chest door opened.Id like to think Trudys happy for me.She swallowed the lump in her throat.Im sure she is, Pops.She wouldnt want you to spend the rest of your life alone.When he didnt respond, she said, Ill start that coffee and put together some breakfast.I picked up a nice ham steak at Sadlers.Youll need the protein today.And then some, he mumbled.Coffee.Priority number one.Once she had it brewing, she started the ham and eggs, then opened a jar of Rosies jam for their English muffins.Rosie and her husband Hank would be at the wedding this afternoon.Hank had worked for Cashs grandpa and had been foreman at the Whispering Pines Ranch for years.Inside the house, though, nobody questioned Rosies authority.Together, the older couple practically ran Cashs ranch.Because Hank was getting on in years, Cash had decided to hire a new hand, and thats when he met Annie.That had been an interesting series of events.Although Cupids arrow had wobbled a bit, it had finally hit home, and Cash and his Annie had tied the knot.And today, her grandfather was tying that knot.Deciding the day called for more than English muffins, Maggie mixed up some pancake batter.Upstairs, Popss electric razor buzzed.She poured batter on the old cast iron griddle and watched the edges bubble.Her mind bounced to Brawley and last nights disastrous dinner with him and his parents.That wasnt fair.The dinner itself hadnt been disastrous.In fact, shed enjoyed her time with Karolyn and Trace.But afterward.Geez, talk about an avalanche.One kiss, and shed lost her mind.Almost.Fortunately shed come to her senses in time.Best to put itand himout of her mind.And shed done thatsort of.So why was she thinking about it now?Disgusted, she flipped the pancake.This last week had sped by.Between training Ella, stocking the shop, and taking care of the thousand details for Pops and Dotties wedding, there hadnt been enough hours in the days.And packing for New York?She hadnt even started.From all accounts, Brawley, too, had his hands full, scrambling to deal with the contractors, plumbers, and Sheetrockers hed hired to finish the renovation job at the clinic.And in between hanging doors and laying floors, hed made emergency trips to care for sick horses and cows.Maggie refused to admit shed held out the teeniest hope one of those calls would have him close enough to Lone Tree that hed stop in.Whatever else he might be, Maggie had no doubt he was one hell of a vet.He cared too much to be less.Her grandfather came up behind her and laid his hands on her shoulders.How do I look, Maggie, honey?She turned and took his gnarled hands in hers.Oh, Pops, Ive never seen a more handsome groom in my life.Then she squinted at him.Youre not wearing those old jeans, though, are you?He chuckled.No, sirree.My tux is safely zipped in my garment bag.Ill change at your folks place.Okay.You have a shirt?Yep.Shoes and socks?Ive got everything I need, including my cuff links.And before you ask, my suitcase for this coming week is already at Dotties.His voice grew gruff.The woman insisted I take dress clothes along.Dont know why we need to fuss.She wants her new husband to look dapper when he takes her out on the town.Popss ears turned red.You gonna stand there yapping or you gonna feed me?She kissed his cheek.Sit.Ill wait on you this morning.Her grandfather might have been nervous, but it didnt interfere with his appetite.When he reached for a third pancake, she said, There will be food at the reception.I know that.Heard you gals talking about the menu enough, didnt I?Cant a fellow be hungry?Yes, a fellow can.She tucked into her own pancake, savoring the pure maple syrup and wondering why she didnt make them more often.Breakfast finished, the dishwasher loaded, and the car packed, they headed to Maverick Junction.Forty minutes later they arrived at her parents.One step closer, Pops.Yep.When her phone chirped, she checked the message.Brawley.Looking 4ward 2 wedding.C U soon, beautiful.What the heck?Not if I C U 1st, she texted back.She hit send, leaned her head against the seat, and closed her eyes.What was she?Ten?Why did she let him get to her?They were too old for games.Everything okay?Pops asked.She plastered a smile on her face.Sure is.You ready?As Ill ever be.Theyd hadnt even stepped inside the door before all hell broke loose.Maggie, Im so glad youre here.Her mother met her with a quick cheek kiss.The caterer had trouble with his van.I called Ty, and hes making a run in his to pick up Emerson and the food.So its under control.Maggie switched the dress bag she carried to her right hand and handed Pops the garment bag with his tux.Why dont you take this upstairs?You might want to start getting ready.Her mother remained in the doorway.Mom, youre going to have to move so we can get inside.You cant stay.What do you mean I cant stay?Maggie shifted her weight to her other foot.I have to get dressed.They need you at Dotties.Why?Seems our unflappable bride is having a meltdown over her shoes.Her shoes?Both Maggie and Pops echoed the words.Rita nodded and waved a hand at Maggie.Go.Reassure her.Do whatever you can.Take your dress with you and get ready there.But her son and daughter are with her.Wes is the one who phoned.Maggie threw her grandfather a pained look.Pops, you sure you want to go through with this?Not too late to back out.Margaret Emmalee, bite your tongue, her mother shot back.Now go.Fix this.She trained her gaze on Pops.And you.Go upstairs and make yourself even more handsome.Maggie gave her grandfather a big hug.See you at the wedding!He grunted.When Maggie arrived, she found Dottie sitting on her bed, surrounded by shoes.It turned out shed bought a second and then a third pair and couldnt decide which to wear.On any other day, it would have been a trifling matter.But this was not just any day.This was her wedding day, and the problem had grown to gargantuan proportions in her mind.Youll look beautiful regardless of which shoes you wear.More tears welled in Dotties eyes.Oh, Dottie.Maggie sat beside her and wrapped her arms around her soon to be step grandma.She glanced up in time to catch Dotties son and daughter deserting ship.The rats.She picked up one shoe, then another.Theyre all beautiful.Yes, they are.Dottie sniffled.If you dont wear them today, you can take them on your honeymoon.Surprise Pops with them.Dottie smiled tremulously.I can.Maggie walked over to Dotties dress and held up the shoes one at a time.Any of them stand out?I love them all.Maggie smiled.Then you cant make a bad choice, can you?Dottie shook her head.Heres my thought.Try on each pair, walk into the kitchen and back, and youll know which is right.Walk to the kitchen?Maggie nodded.Okay.I dont see how that will help, but She slid on a pair and left the room.When she came back, she changed to the second pair, then the third.Stepping back inside the bedroom, she pointed at the second pair.Those.The most comfortable?Dottie grinned.Yes.And Im going to be on my feet a lot today.She hugged Maggie.Youre a smart woman.Maggie grinned.Yes, I am.She let out a relieved breath.Peace reigned once again.And now, Im going to slip into the bathroom and change.When she stepped out, Dottie said, The caterers here.He and Ty have everything unloaded.Then alls well.Standing at the kitchen door, Maggie found herself amazed.The backyard and gardens had been transformed into a fairyland of twinkling lights, tables, and flowers.A pole tent placed on one side would hold the luncheon spread.An arch draped in fresh flowers waited at the far end for the bride and groom.Bitsy, from Heaven Scents, flitted from table to table, fussing with the centerpieces.Car doors opened and closed, and the seats began filling.Relief spilled through her when she heard her mothers voice, followed by Pops.Dottie, Fletch is here.As much as I hate sending you to your room, thats what Im doing.He cant see you before the wedding.We want to cut him off at the knees when you walk down that aisle to him.Youre right, dear.With a small giggle, Dottie scooted off, her daughter and granddaughter hurrying behind her.When her grandfather walked in, Maggie sighed.Oh, Pops, youre gorgeous.Men arent gorgeous, he grumbled.Sure they are.I like your tie.Pink.He fingered the silk.Youd better get used to it if youre going to be living with Dottie.Maggies father turned to her.Wheres Wes?In the living room.Think Ill join him.Over his shoulder, he said, Dont waste your breath arguing with her, Dad.Shes stubborn as the day is long.I am not.You are.Fletch disappeared around the corner behind his son.Wherere the others?Rita asked.Lacey and her daughter are with Dottie.Both her husband and Wess wife are outside with the boys.Rita nodded, then she and Maggie followed the men into the living room.Maggie stopped in the doorway.Her grandfather walked the length of the room, then back.He made another trip.Pops, if you dont quit pacing, youll have to buy Dottie a new carpet.Youre right.Cant seem to sit still.When the men started to talk baseball, she decided it was time to escape to the kitchen.The back door opened, and a flash exploded.She scowled at Brawley who stood, expensive camera in hand.You really are doing the photos?Yeah.You any good?Sugar, Im good at everything I do.He shot her a sexy smile.She rolled her eyes.Id think Dottie would want a professional for a day as important as this.I am a professional.She rolled her eyes.A professional vet.I meant a professional photographer.Im that, too.Right.And Im Miss America.Maggie, Maggie.Always the cynic.Much as I hate to stick up for this scoundrel, her grandfather said, sneaking up behind her, the boy does good work.Ought to take a peek at his website some time.You have a website?I have unplumbed depths, Maggie, Brawley teased.Like an iceberg, only the tip of my many talents is visible to the casual observer.Oh, spare me.Think I will.I want to catch a mix of casual and posed shots of the bride primping for her wedding.He took off down the hall.Maggie marveled at the way the expensive suit pants hugged his derrire.Whoever his tailor was, the man knew his job.The fit was impeccable, the material expensive.Beside her, Pops tugged at the neck of his shirt, then his tie.These are too tight.No, theyre not.They fit you perfectly, her mother said.Its nerves.Youd think Id never done this before, Pops groused.You havent, Maggie said.Not with Dottie.Youre starting a whole new of your life.Hmmph.Annie, radiant in a one shouldered red dress, stuck her head in the back door.Its time, Mr.Sullivan.We need you and your son up front with Father Tom.Fletch wiped the palms of his hands over his tux trousers and blew out a tornado force breath.Still think we should have eloped.Taken a quick trip to Vegas.Annie grimaced.Cashs grandpa tried that with Vivi.Considering the way it turned outNot sure Id go there.Fletch threw back his head and let out a loud laugh.No, guess not.My Dotties got more class in her little finger than that money grabbing woman has in her whole body.His smile faded.Sorry Leo got involved with her.Vivi hurt a lot of good people, including you, Annie.Its water under the bridge.Pops patted Annies cheek.And youre one hell of a woman.Cash is a lucky man.He glanced sideways at Maggie.Too bad somebody else doesnt follow your lead and find herself a decent, hardworking husband.Maggie stuck out her tongue.His lips tilted in a smile.Young people these days have no respect for their elders.One hand on the door, he looked toward his son.Lets get this show on the road.Sean joined him, and a camera flashed as they walked out the door.It had barely closed when Brawley sidled near.Smile for the camera.Im not the one you should be taking pictures of.You dont think your grandfather will want a photo of you looking like this?He gestured toward her.Maggie, honey, you look good enough to eat.She raised a brow, and he laughed.Youre blushing, sweetheart.Im not your sweetheart.You could be.She decided to ignore that.Come on, Mags.Smile for the camera.Thinking about her grandfather and Dottie, their newly found love, she smiled.Click.Click.Click.She frowned.Enough.He shot her a lopsided grin, and she about swallowed her tongue.Too damn bad the man was such a jerk because he sure was easy on the eyes, and he cleaned up so well.No doubt hed often traded his worn, torn jeans for suits in Dallas, but it wasnt a sight she saw often.Again, she gave silent kudos to his tailor.The cut was flawless.His fancy, go to church cowboy boots shone like a mirror and went perfectly with the suit.With him.He held out a hand.You really do look incredible.She willed her heart to behave and dipped her chin.Thank you.That one of your designs?Yes.The pastel, flower printed material had been a dream to work with.She ran a hand down the form fitting silk skirt.Shed paired it with a sweetheart neckline and set it off with her new hot pink stilettosin honor of Dottie and her penchant for the color.He whistled low.If this is what youre gonna hit them with in the Big Apple, youll have everybody sitting up, begging for more.From your lips to Gods ears.He toyed with the cocktail ring on her finger.Thought Id walk you to your seat.Im guessing you have some real mixed emotions rolling around in that brain of yours today.Oh, Brawley.Her eyes misted.Dont you start crying on me now.He thumbed away the single tear that spilled over.Im no good with that.She tipped her head.You know, I think I have to disagree.The night Nathan showed up, you were great with Sophie.I was there.I did what needed to be done.No.You did more, far more.He shrugged, obviously uncomfortable.Interesting.That night had affected her deeply.After Brawleyd gone home, hed called her, bit out what had happened.Later, when Sophie had filled her in on the details, the ice around Maggies heart had cracked, gone into full glacial meltdown.Later, shed worked hard to shore it up again.There were times like today, though, when thin fissures reappeared.Give me a second to check Dottie one last time.Okay, but make it quick.I need to be in place when she walks out.Will do.While youre doing that, Ill hustle outside and take some shots of Fletch and Sean waiting for the bride.Ill be back by the time you are.Deal.She scurried down the hallway and tapped lightly on the bedroom door.Lacey opened it a crack, then swung it wide when she saw Maggie.Stepping aside, she swept a hand toward her mother.Isnt she gorgeous?Oh, Dottie.Maggie crossed the room and gathered the wonderful woman in her arms.Then she stepped back to study her.Laceys right.You look marvelous.A wonderful young lady I know designed this especially for me.Dottie ran a hand over the soft pink beaded jacket, the flowing skirt.That young lady might have a future in the business, Maggie parried.What do you think?Not a doubt in my mind.And these buttons are perfect.She fingered the dyed pink buttons on the jackets cuff and sobered.I love your grandfather, Margaret Emmalee.I hope I can make him happy.I wouldnt worry about that for a single second.He loves you right back.I fought with myself about leaving for New York because I didnt want Pops to be alone.And now he wont be.Hell have you.And Ill have him.Yes.Maggies chest tightened with emotion, and she took Dotties hands in her own.Now.Its time the bride takes her walk down the aisle.Fletch and Dad are waiting with Father Tomfor you.Oh, my.Dottie laid a hand over her stomach.If I had any more butterflies, I wouldnt need feetor shoes.Theyd float me right down that aisle.Maggie grinned.That would make a great scene in a Disney movie, wouldnt it?And speaking of fairy tales.Your garden is fairy tale beautiful.I know.The soon to be bride let out a happy sigh.Ive been peeking out the window.Everything is perfect.Its like a dream.She put a hand to her mouth.Lots of people showed up, didnt they?Lacey came up from behind and slipped a hand into her mothers.Did you think for even a second they wouldnt, Mom?I dont know what I thought, except that Id never be doing this again.Life sometimes surprises us.Maggie thought of the man who stood in the kitchen waiting for her.Some surprises were good ones.Others?Well, you dealt with what you were given.She handed Dottie the bouquet of pink lilies, white hydrangeas, lily of the valley, and soft pink roses tied with a simple antique white satin bow.Dottie buried her nose in them.Bitsy outdid herself.Heavenly, arent they?So is the hat, Lacey said.A beaded, pink pillbox perched atop Dotties blue gray curls.A birdcage veil finished the look beautifully.Youre absolutely ravishing.Youll knock Fletch right out of that new pair of boots.Mother and daughter embraced.You ready?Maggie asked.Dottie nodded.Ill let them know.She walked to the kitchen and found Brawley snitching olives from one of the trays.Get out of there.Just taste testing.Olives?You never know.He held out his hand.Come on, sugar.Let me escort the most gorgeous gal in Texas to her seat for her grandpas big day.She smiled.It felt right.For today.When she put her hand in his, electricity sizzled between them.She nearly tripped.You okay?His breath tickled her neck as he leaned down.Absolutely.Outside, she nodded at the DJ, then took a seat on the far side of her mother.Brawley plunked down in the empty chair beside Maggie.I can only stay a minute.Then I have to play shutter bug.The chairs were close, and the heat from his thigh practically branded her through the thin silk of her dress.Not willing to go there, she directed her attention to her grandfather and her dad.Both men looked incredibly handsome, the white of their shirts deepening their tanned faces.Her dads hair still had as much pepper as salt, but Popss hair was pure white.His mustache, trimmed neatly, gave him a dignified air.Sullivan men were lookers.Strains of A Time for Us, the theme from Romeo and Juliet, drifted over the garden.Brawley jumped up and positioned himself with his camera as everyone turned.Dottie stepped into the sunlight on her sons arm, her smile nearly blinding.When Maggie glanced toward her grandfather, the expression on his weathered face made the breath catch in her throat.To love and be loved like that.What a gift.And these extraordinary people had found this not once, but twice.A tiny voice inside Maggie cried out for someone for herself, someone like the man whod been sitting beside her seconds ago.She ignored it.Refused to think about it today.When Wes and Dottie reached the preacher, Wes gave his mom a quick kiss and man hugged Fletch.Then he joined his family in the front row.The ceremony, brief and touching, had more than one woman dabbing at tears.Before them stood two people eager to commit to one another.After Father Tom pronounced them man and wife, Fletch kissed his new bride soundly.A blushing Dottie grinned and wiped a smudge of lipstick from her new husbands mouth.Together, they strolled down the rose strewn path to the Beatles In My Life, the song both a fond remembrance of those who had been such a part of their lives and were now gone, and a nod to the future and their new love.Brawley, taking a break from shooting pictures, leaned against the rough bark of one of Dotties magnificent shade trees.The girls may have had less than a week to pull this wedding together, but theyd done one heck of a job.Hed been to some pretty elaborate weddings but couldnt remember ever seeing a happier bride and groom.When Dottie had walked across the yard to where Fletch waited for her, Brawley swore shed nearly floated.And wasnt he waxing poetic?If so, it was Maggies fault.The woman was a vision.Her dress made him think of peppermint ice cream.She made him hungry.An arm slipped through his.Rita Sullivan.He sniffed the air.You smell great.Thank you.I have to say, Brawley, youre looking awfully handsome today, all spiffed up.Nice suit.What happened to your tie?He grinned and pulled the rolled up silk from his pocket.A man can only wear one of these for so long before he starts to get itchy.Guess so.Her gaze roamed the garden.Not many ties in this group.Nope.I couldnt help noticing you watching my Maggie.He cringed.Had he been that obvious?You still love my little girl, Brawley Odell?Responses to that flew in and out of his head.He rubbed his jaw but could come up with no good answer.Kind of like a woman asking if her outfit made her butt look big.Damned if you do, damned if you dont.So he settled on the truth.Yes, maam, I do.Always have.And Im afraid I always will.You planning on doing something about it?He hesitated again, then shook his head.I cant, Rita.I cant hold her back.Shes following her dream, and thats the way it has to be.When Rita opened her mouth to argue, he said, I think weve all recognized right from the start Maggie was something special.She has a gift, and shes been given a chance to fly with it.I couldnt stand in the way of thatbefore or now.Her brow furrowed in question.So where do Pops and Dottie plan to spend their honeymoon?Arent you the clever one?She patted his cheek.Dont think for one minute I dont know what youre doing, but Ill let you get away with it this time.Austin.Theyre going to Austin for a few days.Thankful shed allowed him to change the subject, he chatted with her another few minutes before someone called her away to see about cutting the cake.Time for him to cut his losses.But damned if he could.Eleven  Maggie sat on the front porch steps, staring up into the night sky, enjoying a moment of peace and quiet.The day had been longand oh, so special.She slid off her shoes and wiggled her toes.Ohhh, that felt good.Pops and Dottie had driven away in a flurry of birdseed.A full moon shone, forming lace patterns across the lawn as it filtered through the large trees in front.Voices drifted from the back of the house where a few guests lingered.Soft music floated on the night air and mixed with the scent of flowers, both from Dotties gardens and the impressive centerpieces Bitsy had created.All was well with the world.Footsteps sounded on the walk, and she turned to see Brawley coming toward her.Mind if I share your stoop?Maggies heart stuttered.The man was movie star handsome.Rugged.Moonlight glinted off his thick, dark hair.Her fingers itched to bury themselves in it, and she had to fight to keep both hands in her lap.He stood, waiting for permission to sit.Always the gentleman.No.Not true.He hadnt been a gentleman when hed dumped her all those years ago.Not at all.Sit.She swept the skirt of her dress beneath her.Their shoulders bumped as he dropped onto the step.Tired?he asked.Exhausted.It went well, Red.Everything was top notch.She smiled.It was, wasnt it?When he reached for her hand, she drew it back.Without a word, he tucked his own into his jacket pocket.Can we ever be friends again, Maggie?I dont know.I thought we took a step in the right direction last night.Brawley, I enjoyed dinner with your family.But one good night doesnt outweigh the past.I understand that.And what happened after dinner We kissed, he said.She swallowed.Yes, we kissed.That shouldnt have happened.Im gonna beg to disagree on that.Whatever.Thats your prerogative.The thing is, its not possible to wipe the slate clean.To pick up and go on as if the past never happened.Why?She met his eyes.You have to ask?Yeah, I do.Okay.Truth?Im not sure I can trust you.He flinched.Im sorry.Me, too.He looked skyward, his eyes moving as he studied the stars.It would take a miracle to make up for everything Ive done wrong.I understand that.I made a stupid decision, then compounded it by not admitting it.My only defense is that I was nineteen and foolish.If he only knew.For about five seconds, an overwhelming urge to tell him everything battled inside Maggie.She pushed it back.The time for that had long passed.Brawley, youve been doing what you want.Ive been missing you.She couldnt squelch the laugh that forced its way out.You think thats funny?He sounded offended, actually looked hurt.Come on, Brawley.I saw the pictures of you at that fund raiser with Annie and Cashand Ms.Dallas Cowboy Cheerleader, who was spilling out of her dress and all but crawling down your throat.Rachel?No, she wasnt.Yes, she was.Annie had pictures of you two dancing.And Rachel was only one of many.The flicker in his eyes warned her shed said too much.He leaned back, resting on one elbow.You been following my social life, Mags?Exasperated, she sighed.Hardly.Im just saying that, to be honest, you really didnt look like you were suffering all that much.One evening.A public one.She snorted.What?You want me to wear a hair shirt and shave my head?No.Before she could stop herself, her fingers ran through his thick, dark hair.I love your hair.He grabbed her hand, brought her arm to his lips, and kissed the inside of her wrist.She was really, really glad she was sitting down, not at all certain her legs would have supported her right then.Shed been watching him, thinking about him these last few days.She hated what hed done to her.The way hed done it.Shed convinced herself she hated him.But despite that, she wanted him, and that really pissed her off.This week, that want had grown to gargantuan proportions.She could barely think, couldnt sleep.Maybe she should give in to those needs one more time.Maybe shed built him up in her mind, fantasized what theyd had.Reality couldnt possibly come close, and once she proved that to herself, she could shut the door on that part of her past.On Brawley.Then, again, giving in might prove fatal.When he reached to tuck a strand of hair behind her ear, she caught his hand in hers.What are you doing?he asked.I want to see what a country boy turned city slickers hand looks like.City slicker?He started to pull his hand away, but she grabbed it back.Whats this?A scratch.Scratch my eye.Brawley, this is a nasty cut.It happened while we were tearing down a wall at the clinic.One of the triplets took a good whack, and my hand was where it shouldnt have been.I tore it on a nail snatching it away.You ought to see a doctor.Maggie, I am a doctor.An animal doctor.Doesnt matter.A cuts a cut.Im fine.Without thinking, she carried his hand to her lips.Kissed it.Then she dropped it like it was on fire.Sorry.I didnt mean to do that.Oh, yeah?He jerked her to him.Well, sugar, I do mean this.Hed have kissed her socks off if shed been wearing any.She worked a hand between them.Youre dangerous to me, Brawley.My Kryptonite.Ive changed.Her lips curved downward.I have, he insisted.Again, Im remembering that bosomy brunette on your arm in Dallas.Ive never claimed to be a saint.He ran the toe of his boot over the stair.She laughed.She simply couldnt help it.He scowled at her, and she sobered.I cant be around you, Brawley.Why?Because you make me want more.Too much more.She stood.Im joining the others.Uh uh.No way.You cant tell me something like that, then walk away.She shrugged.Lets declare a cease fire for this weekend, Maggie.I dont want to spoil whats left of the wedding.The bride and groom are gone.He lifted his brows.Fine.A temporary truce.Absolutely.He dared to grin.The music changed from a fast song to Michael Bubls The Way You Look Tonight.Brawley stood and took Maggies hand in his.Dance with me here in the moonlight.I dont think Good.Dont think.Just dance with me.She let him lead her into the grass.Im barefoot.Dont you dare step on my toes.Have I ever?No.She sighed when he pulled her into his arms.She laid her head on his chest and listened to the slow, steady beat of his heart.The music, the moonlight, the soft night air wrapped around them.For this short moment in time, shed let herself enjoy.One dance led to another.His head dipped, but she turned, and his lips grazed her cheek.Everythings under control here, he whispered into her ear.Can you leave?Brawley Its okay.Im not stealing you away to ravage you.Darn.His head whipped around so fast, she thought hed surely need a chiropractor.What?He stared into her face.Her tongue shot out to lick suddenly dry lips.Leaving with him had bad idea written all over it.I was kidding, Brawley.Joking around.Oh.Okay.You sure?Because if you want to ravage or be ravaged Im positive.If you change your mind Her chest tightened, but she gave him a small poke in the arm.I wont.Gee, dont try to let me down easy or anything.He held out his hands, palm up.Seriously, though, I want to show you my office, the clinic.Weve finished all but the last few details.A crews coming in tomorrow to take care of those.On a Sunday?Yep.Overtime pay.So youll be able to open Monday?Right on schedule.Im glad.Me, too.Heres the thing.He caught her hand in his before she could pull it away again.His thumb circled over the back of it, and she closed her eyes.Youre going to be leaving, Red, starting a new business of your own.You, above all, understand how much this means to me.Still, she hesitated.Come on.Take a ride with me and look at the place, for Petes sake.No monkey business.He paused, tilted his head.Unless, of course, you change your mind and insist.That beautiful, unrestrained laugh he loved bubbled up and out of her, spilled through those lips.How could he stand to watch her walk away?How would he bear being here without Maggie?Again he wondered if coming home had been a mistake.Maverick Junction without Maggie Sullivan would not be the same place.But then, hed left her, hadnt he, all those years ago?Hed expected her to go to design school, though, so it was different, wasnt it?Hed thought theyd end up together again.Let me get my purse.When she disappeared inside, he prayed she wouldnt change her mind.Sean Sullivan chose that exact moment to walk around the front of the house.You seen my daughter?Oh, boy.She went in the house for her purse.Why?Were gonna take a ride.Seans hands curled at his side.You think thats a good idea?I want to show her what weve done at the clinic.Uh huh.He seemed to be fighting with himself.Rita tells me I need to mind my own business.That the two of you will either work things out or you wont.That Maggies a big girl now.Brawley waited.Sean shook a finger at him.I dont care how old she is.Shes my little girl.Always has been, always will be.You hurt her before.Dont do it again.Im keeping my eye on you.With that, he headed back to the festivities.Brawley leaned against the porch railing, chewing on Seans words.Hed been warned.In no time flat Maggie sailed out the door, purse slung over her shoulder.Brawley, hand on her back, walked her to his Tahoe and held the door for her.He didnt have a clue why shed decided to go with him.Curiosity?Nostalgia?Whatever.He didnt care.All that mattered was Maggie sitting beside him in his vehicle for the first time in way too long.As he drove down Main Street, one hand on the wheel, the other arm propped on his open window, he hoped someone, anyone, saw them.Hed won the lottery.He and Maggie together again on a Saturday night.Every store along the street was locked tight, windows dark.The good people of Maverick Junction not still at the wedding were home, doing whatever they did on Saturday nights to unwind from a long weeks work and activities.As he turned onto the side street that led to the clinic, he reminded himself hed be a fool to assume her agreeing to come with him meant shed had even the slightest change of heart.Most likely, it signified absolutely nothing.On the other hand, there was the slightest chance it meant she hadnt totally closed the door on him.She had agreed to a truce, after all.One thing he did know.He was alone with Maggie.The SUVs interior smelled of her.Feminine and sensual.Sexy.Maggie, Maggie, you make it hard on a fellow.The second Brawley pulled into the parking lot, Maggie saw the new sign, an oval of dark wood, the carved name painted white.DR.BRAWLEY ODELLS ANIMAL CLINIC.A surge of pride swelled in her.Its what Ive always wanted.You surprise me.She undid her seat belt.I honestly thought you liked the big city.I did.For a while.But this He swept his arm to encompass the building, the grounds.Why didnt you come back sooner?I didnt want to get in Doc Gibsons way.Didnt want to compete with him.He had a good practice and made a good living.Im not sure theres room for two vets in town.So the timings right.Yeah.His gaze burned into her.Except youre leaving.She hopped out rather than answer.Youve given the old building a fresh coat of paint.Inside and out.He unlocked the front door and ushered her ahead of him, then flicked on the overheads.Maggie stood for a minute, taking it in.Youve made more than a couple changes.Wow.She ran the toe of her shoe over the flooring.That ghastly green linoleum is gone.Yeah, one of the first things I ripped out.Had to have been the ugliest ever made.Sure hope Doc got it cheap.She grinned.And new countertops.You moved the reception over a bit.Itll keep Bobby Sue out of the direct path of the door.Before, anytime somebody came in or left, she got blasted either by the heat or the cold.Good for you for caring.When the helps happy He shrugged.The biggest changes are in the back.As she started down the hallway, Maggie let out a happy squeal.You arched the opening into the office.He nodded.Oh, and look at these.Like a lover, she ran a hand over the massive double doors, curved to match the arch.Theyre spectacular.Had them made in Dallas.Once I decided to go ahead with the move, the renovations, I knew I wanted to change the office doorway.He opened them and hit the wall switch.An impressive antler chandelier lit the room.Maggie stilled, her hand going to her mouth.Oh, my gosh, Brawley.How did you manage to do all this?Ty and Cash busted their butts beside me this week.I owe them.I used to help out here.Maggie shook her head.Doc Gibsons office was a cluttered, dark little hole.What a change.If Im gonna be spending a lot of time here, I might as well be comfortable.She walked across the room to run a hand over the impressive oak desk.This is the one you refinished?Yep.Wow again.She gave a half laugh.I dont know what to say.Bending down, she traced the lone star carved into the front, noticed another had been etched near the top of a floor to ceiling bookcase.Did you do that, too?No.My dad did.A cowhide rug covered the deep wood floor in front of his desk.Hed placed a leather chair by it and moved a love seat in the corner.Comfortable and welcoming.Everything in the room was Texas themed, from the lamps to the coat tree.The walls, painted in textured browns and coppers, had the look of leather.Youre staying, she whispered.I am.Youll be happy here, Brawley.Ill miss you.Youve lived without me for a long time.But I always knew youd be here.That I could get my Maggie fix whenever I needed it with a couple hours drive.Brawley I know.He held up a hand.Not fair.I wont ask you to stay.I know better than that.This is something you have to do.It is.Once youre in New York, though, if you dont like it, Ill be here.Thats not going to happen.Red, if theres one thing Ive learned, its never say never.Fine.Her heart hammered in her chest.She moved to the leather love seat, her hand stroking it.This is yummy.So are you.The thought tumbled out before he could stop it.She turned, so close he could feel her breath on his face.He hadnt meant for it to happen.He hadnt brought her here to make a move.But damn if he could keep his hands, his mouth, off her.Hed watched her all day, that gorgeous red hair done up in a tumbled mass, curls escaping and trailing down her neck.Hed itched to pull out whatever pins held it and spill the fiery strands around her.Wanted to run his hands through it, feel the silky softness.More, he wanted to unzip that swath of silk and let it slide to the floor.Wanted to touch the creamy white skin beneath.Needed to taste her.Her lips, the back of her knees, her stomach.Needed to know if she still wore the little silver ring through her belly button.Needed almost more than his next breath to hear her quiet little sighs, her cries of delight as they made love.His gaze drifted to her red, red lips when her tongue peeked out between them.Maggie Brawley?Yeah?He raised his eyes back to hers.They always reminded him of a Texas meadow right after a spring rainstorm.What man could resist?Sure as hell not him.He caved.Pulled her to him.Felt her heat.The first kiss was tentative.After that initial foray, though, he lost sight of his good intentions, of right and wrong.Soft.So very soft.His hand moved to the back of her neck, drawing her closer still.Inching into that silken mass of hair, he removed the pins one at a time, sighed when the strands spilled loose over his fingers, his hand, his arm.His mouth left hers, traced a path along her chin, over her cheek.He buried his face in her hair and breathed deeply.God, she smelled good.Maggie gave him those little sighs, those moans hed been craving.His lips trailed back to hers.When they parted, he slid his tongue inside to dance with hers.He backed her up till she was against the sofa.Sliding a hand beneath her knees, he scooped her up and laid her on the soft leather, then followed her down.His hands ran the length of her, his fingers trailing beneath the hem of her dress.He felt her cool hands on his heated flesh.Somehow she had his shirt out of his pants and half unbuttoned.Her head lowered, and she trailed a line of kisses across his bare chest.She stopped at the small scar just above his navel, flicked her tongue over it.Brawley sucked in his breath.Maggie had been the one to mark him there with a stick when theyd been eight year old pirates fighting it out with pretend swords.He put a finger beneath her chin and raised her head to taste her lips again.She had matured, ripened.Was everything the eighteen year old Maggie had been and more.Much more.Oh, Mags, he whispered into her ear.Youre killing me.She answered with a long, deep kiss.He groaned.I want you so badly it hurts.Shut up and kiss me, cowboy.Somewhere in the back of her mind, even as those words slipped out, Maggies conscience started throwing a tantrum.Wrong, it screamed.This is wrong.She didnt care.It had been so long.Too long.Brawley had changed, his body now that of a man rather than a teenager.He had muscles on top of muscles.
