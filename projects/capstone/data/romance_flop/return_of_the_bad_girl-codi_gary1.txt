Ladies, lock up your men!Caroline Willis is back in town.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE WILLIS SNORTED as she read the entry in the Rock Canyon Press.Shed seen her name on the cover and paused to pick up a paper before heading into Halls Market.When shed turned to page three, there had been a picture of her leaving her sister Valeries house.Twelve years ago, gossip was spread on Sundays after church, at the local salon, and on any bar stool in town.Now every juicy tidbit was being printed in the local paper by an anonymous big mouth.Miss Know It All was the town gossip columnist turned blogger.No one knew her identity, although there had been much speculation bandied about by Carolines sisters.Valerie was certain it was Gracie McAllister, while Ellie thought it was Mrs.Andrews, the towns biggest bitch and gossip.Caroline had no idea.And yet, over the last few weeks, whoever it was seemed to have taken a particular interest in her.Still, it wasnt like Miss Know It All could make her return any worse.Caroline had decided over a month ago that she wanted to come home to be with her sisters.As for her father, well ...she had hoped that at least he would be willing to put the past behind them and start over.It wasnt like theyd ever been a picture perfect family, at least not behind closed doors, but despite all their bad blood, he was still her dad.Working things out with him probably wouldnt have been so urgent if he hadnt had a heart attack two weeks ago.Valerie had called Caroline to tell her the morning it happened.As Caroline had raced home, shed imagined her fathers relief at seeing her doing so well after twelve years away with no contact.Man, had she been living in a fucking fantasy land.If her fathers refusal to even see her hadnt proven how shed over estimated times ability to heal all wounds, she definitely wasnt prepared to face the citizens of Rock Canyon, Idaho.Lord knew shed burned more bridges before she was eighteen than most people lit up in their lifetimes.Shed only bumped into a few people since being back, but when shed tried to be friendly, shed been met with chilly nods as they hurried away.Walking into Halls Market offered a perfect example of how her return was definitely not met with cheers and parades.The first thing she noticed was the stares.Hope Weathers was putting out boxes of cookies in the bakery department and just about dropped one as Caroline passed.Marci Andrews, Betty Harwood, and Willa FullertonRock Canyons version of the morality police (they were just like the Fashion Police on E but meaner)were standing in line at checkout stand one, a wall of open disapproval as they whispered back and forth with the blonde clerk, whose scowl was so ugly that Caroline almost paused.She didnt even recognize the girl, but she was sure giving Caroline the business.Even Danny Cordova, who was stocking an end cap, stopped what he was doing, his eyes bugging out of his head as she gave him a tiny wave.Although maybe he was staring at her for another reason.She smiled at the thought that straight laced Danny might be checking her out, especially considering how shy hed been in high school.Shed never seen him even look sideways at a girl and had actually assumed he played for the other team.Caroline was tempted to stop, spin around, and yell Boo!, but then they would say she was crazy.Lord knew shed called herself the same thing for the last fourteen days.Crazy for coming back, crazy for expecting her father to have grown and softened in his old age.Who knew that when hed told her to never come back twelve years ago, hed meant it?Oh my God, Caroline Willis?Is that you?Caroline stopped in her tracks.Six feet in front of herand holding a bundle of celery so tightly that Caroline imagined it would snap in half any secondstood her former best friend, Shelby Donovan.She definitely couldnt blame her for being tense, though.They hadnt exactly ended on the best of terms.What with Caroline having stolen Shelbys boyfriend and all.On second thought, maybe today hadnt been a good day to venture out of her sisters house and brave the world.Judging by Shelbys red faced, lemon sucking expression, Caroline had every reason to hide, but she wouldnt back down from Shelbys anger now.Shed embrace it and attempt to make amends.Its what shed told Valerie she would try to do.Take the high road.Turn the other cheek.What brings your skanky ass back here?Sparks of temper prickled Carolines skin.Sucking in a calming breath, she forced a smile.That is so classy, Shelby.Congratulations, by the way; it looks like your boobs finally came in.Or was that a little surgical gift from Mom and Dad?Okay, so maybe the high road was overreaching.Shelbys cheeks flushed an unhealthy shade of violet, probably because despite the obvious surgical enhancements, she had gained about thirty pounds.Shelby had always moaned and groaned about her lack of curves in high school, voicing her jealousy over Carolines hourglass frame, but it looked like she had finally gotten her wish.Only where Carolines body had always been toned, Shelby looked a bit ...lumpy.Well, Marcus doesnt seem to think theres anything wrong with me, Shelby said, smirking.Ah, Marcus Boatman.Shelbys dream man was the same guy who hadnt hesitated dumping her like a hot potato the minute hed thought Caroline was interested.I find it interesting that youre still holding a grudge against me, when your supposed boyfriend, Caroline said, making air quotes, cheated on you.How come you forgave him?Because men are weak.Besides, he has more than made up for his one transgression, where as you violated the rules of friendship and sisterhood.Caroline had to bite her cheek to keep from laughing.Okay, first of all, you were never my sister in any way.And you, of all people, know that I was not in a good place.Where were you when I needed you?Caroline shook her head.Face it, Shelby.We both failed each other in a big way, and I apologized a long time ago for my part in it, but dont you think its time to just let it go?Obviously not, if the flush of her former friends face was any indication.You havent changed at all!Shelby said.You act like youre Gods gift Is there a problem here, ladies?Caroline looked over her shoulder to find Mr.Hall glancing between them sternly.Yeah, there is.You let this tra Actually, Mr.Hall, I was just picking up a few things to take over to my dad and bumped into Shelby, Caroline broke in, shooting Shelby a warning look.Obviously, age had not matured the spoiled, entitled little snot, but if she thought Caroline was going to stand there and be bad mouthed to her face, she was wrong.Caroline could only be pushed so far.It seems we still have some things to work out, but unfortunately, I am in a hurry.Shelby huffed and tossed the celery back onto the pile.We have nothing to work out, and you can be sure Ill be doing my shopping elsewhere from now on.Caroline wanted to tell her exactly how ridiculous she sounded, but before she could, Shelby stomped around the two of them toward the exit.When they were alone, Mr.Hall ran a hand through his silver hair, clearly uncomfortable.Hows your dad doing?Caroline smiled.Shed always liked the kindly grocer.As far as I know, hes ornery as ever.Well see if he lets me through the door.Yes, he can be stubborn, Mr.Hall said, his eyes shifting away.His whole demeanor screamed that he had something to say and was struggling with it.Caroline tried to put him at ease.It will all work out, Im sure.I am sorry about the way Shelby spoke to you, and Im sure she didnt mean what she said about shopping elsewhere.Although, Mr.Hall, it shouldnt surprise you if she does stop coming here ...the spiteful little bitch.Yes, well ...I understand youre moving back here.He paused a second, as if waiting for her to confirm his statement, so she nodded.You know I dont listen to gossip, but I cant afford to lose my regular customers.Do you understand what Im saying?So much for thinking at least one person might give her the benefit of the doubt.Sure.Youre saying if I offend the respectable people of Rock Canyon, you wont let me through the door, she said, no longer smiling and hanging on to her temper by the skin of her teeth.And thats called discrimination.I thought you were better than that, sir.Without waiting for him to stop blustering, she walked back toward the front of the store and down to the candy aisle, trying to hold on to her dignity.It shouldnt surprise her that Mr.Hall would warn her off; she was a fly in the ointment for quite a few good citizens, and he had a business to run.Still, did he have to make her feel like some kind of second class citizen?It wasnt like her money was worth less.As she stopped in front of the candy display, she realized shed been squeezing her hands into fists so hard that her nails had dug into her palms.She opened them to find purplish red crescent moons indented into the flesh and winced.Since she began running her own businesses years ago, shed tried different tricks to control her temper.Sometimes they worked and sometimes they didnt, but at least she hadnt popped anyone in the face today.That was progress.Caroline pulled a gold and yellow bag off the shelf, ignoring her sore flesh.Her father loved these disgusting butterscotch candies, and she was hoping a bag of them might ease his hostility.He definitely hadnt been as receptive of her last visit to the hospital a few weeks ago.At first, shed laughed off her fathers refusal to see her as a sign that he must be feeling better, but when hed denied her a second time, irritation had settled into the pit of her stomach and simmered.Why couldnt he just set aside some of that stubborn Willis pride and put the past where it belonged?After three days, shed barged into his hospital room and faced off with Edward Willis for the first time in twelve years.After a few minutes of telling him exactly what she thought of his rejection, the nurse had shoved her out the door.But not before shed had the satisfaction of watching her fathers face turn purple with rage after shed said, Youre the one who missed out, Dad.I survived without you.In fact, I thrived in spite of you.Edward Willis never liked to be wrong, especially when there was proof.Of course, if hed known anything about those first two rough years after being kicked out, he probably would have glowed with satisfaction.Within just the first few weeks, Caroline had had less than fifty bucks to her name and had been sleeping in her car outside of Las Vegas, eating a lot of dollar tacos.And then shed run out of money.But when she went around to local businesses, none of them would hire a high school dropout who was living in her car.None except Diamond of the Desert Gentlemans Club.Caroline had hated stripping more than she could express, but she couldnt deny that it paid well.Within a year, shed saved enough to move on, and when one of her favorite patrons, a kind, lonely man named Carl Jackson who owned a bar nearby, asked if shed be interested in a bartending position, shed agreedwith the stipulation that thered be no dancing, stripping, or teasing involved.Caroline ended up working for Carl longer than shed thought she would.Along with getting her GED and taking college classes online, she found her calling in drawing people to Carls bar, the Whiskey and Wine Saloon, using fun theme nights.Soon she was managing the bar and eventually, two years and one bachelors degree in business later, Carl offered to sell it to her.Three days after her twenty sixth birthday, she was able to sell the bar for a profit and leave Nevada in her rearview mirror.After that, shed taken on five more failing bars around the country, leaving every one of them in a better place than when she started and making enough for the next project in the process.But the work was exhausting and after a while, it started being more labor than love.When her father had his heart attack, shed already planned to stop flipping.But once she decided to move back to Rock Canyon, it had been Carl whod suggested she start a consulting business for bars that were struggling.Now, she already had a few consultation jobs lined up in Chicago and New York, but she wanted to get settled before she did any traveling.All in all, she had high hopes for her future and her business.With little thanks to Edward Willis.So no, Caroline hadnt been putting on a brave face when shed thrown her success in her fathers face.She had survived without his help.Without his money.She had worked hard, done whatever it took, and even graduated from college.His lack of approval or forgiveness hadnt broken her, and no way would the opinions of a few idiots tear her down now.Pulled back to the task at hand, Caroline walked up to the checkout stand and saw that the three biddies were still there, standing at the front of Halls, watching her.Good morning, ladies, Caroline said, oozing sweetness.So lovely to see you again.Mrs.Andrews sniffed and headed toward the exit with her cart, the other two hurrying after.Innocently, Caroline handed the blonde clerk her candy and debit card.Was it something I said?Two The past will always catch up to you, no matter how fast you run.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE STOOD AT the end of the walkway leading to her childhood home.The April breeze blew her hair into her eyes, obstructing her vision as she stared up at the two story ranch house.It hadnt changed much besides a fresh coat of paint, but the perfectly landscaped fortress still seemed like a strange place instead of the warm, welcoming hearth that coming home was supposed to be.Reaching up to tie her hair back in a loose ponytail, she rotated her shoulders and cracked her neck, trying to ease the tension.You can do this.You just have to face him, to show him that youre here and you arent going anywhere, no matter what a bastard he may be.Caroline headed up the path and the steps, the hard candy in one sweaty hand.She shouldnt be this nervous, especially since shed already faced his anger in the hospital.But there, theyd been in a less personal setting, neutral turf.Now, she was stepping into the lions den, where a thousand memories, both good and bad, would be waiting to add to her already emotional state.It was funny.Shed spent three years hating him before she left and another two blaming him for everything that went wrong once he was out of her life.Yet he was still her dad.Though the times hed been there for her were few and far between, those were the memories that stuck out to her.Like the time hed coached her for the state spelling bee, which she had lost.But for a week there, having his complete attention had been all she cared about.Yeah, he definitely hadnt been the dad of her dreams, but she was almost thirty one.She didnt need him to be a dad now.But she would at least like to have some kind of relationship with him.If only so she didnt add any more regrets to her list.Once she stood on the stoop, she knocked twice and waited, expecting their housekeeper, Teresa, to open the front door.Only when the door opened, it wasnt Teresa.Carolines heart stopped cold before resuming at an unhealthy tempo, beating against her chest painfully.Icy blue eyes stared back at her from a too handsome face, a cupids bow mouth splitting into a leer that knocked the wind out of her.Kyle Jenner.Valerie had warned Caroline that he worked for their father now and was basically his right hand man.It didnt surprise her that Kyle and her father were attached at the hip, considering how far up Senator Jenners ass her dads head had been.But shed never thought Kyle would be in their home, especially since her father was still recovering.Well, hello, beautiful.His tone, arrogant and too familiar, sent her stomach twisting.Bile rose up and burned the back of her throat.She was being strangled by her fear, and there was nothing she could do.Every self defense and martial arts class she had taken hadnt cured her of the paralyzing fear this one man could create.Shed faced down three hundred pound drunks and an angry husband with a two barrel looking for his wayward wife, yet Kyles sly smile still made her want to piss her pants.She resisted the urge to close her eyes in an effort to block out the memories clawing to the surface.Who knew someone so beautiful could be so rotten?Cat got your tongue, sweet Caroline?Dont struggle, sweet Caroline.Fifteen years had passed since that night, and his words, his tone, still made her skin crawl with disgust.Her father had asked her to attend a dinner party at Senator Jenners home in Boise, where they were going to spend the night.It wasnt the first time shed met the senators son, Kyle, but his attention on her was definitely new.Hed spent the whole night courting her, fetching her drinks and sweets, and dancing with her out on the porch.Shed felt like a princess.Until shed been woozy and excused herself to go lie down upstairs.Kyle had offered to help her, but shed said she would be fine.Before she blacked out, she remembered feeling weightless and dreamy but somehow different from the sensation of being drunk.Besides, she hadnt been drinking alcohol that night.Later, she woke up in pain.Kyle was on top of her.Inside her.He was raping her, and she was too dizzy, too weak, to do much but whimper and cry.Please ...stop ...He hadnt stopped, though; hed laughed.Hed insulted her and mocked her until he finished with her.A virgin is just a whore in training.When shed woken up the next morning, her memories had blurred together.Her head had pounded painfully, and when shed tried to sit up, the room still spun.As she started to climb out of the bed, shed cried out sharply at the shock of soreness between her legs.Caroline had pulled back the blankets and realized her dress was torn, her underwear gone.When she stood up, she winced, trying to fight past the fog and the hurt to remember what had happened, and then she saw it.Blood on the sheets.Nausea had rolled up her throat until she was doubled over on the floor, vomiting up everything shed eaten the night before.A flash of Kyles laughter intensified the pain in her head, and shed curled up on her side, sobbing.When her father had come knocking at her door to let her know theyd be leaving in an hour, shed been so shaky and confused, she hadnt been able to say more than okay.Once she heard his footsteps retreating, shed changed out of her destroyed dress and stuffed it into her backpack.She had tried to scrub the vomit out of the carpet with one of the bathroom towels, but it only seemed to make things worse.Once shed dressed, she headed for the stairs, but before she could take one step, someone had grabbed her arm and pushed her up against the wall.Where are you going in such a hurry?Caroline closed her eyes against the evil sneer of Kyles voice and whispered, Let me go.Not until we have a little talk about what happened last night, he said, pulling her into the hall closet, despite her struggles against his grip.What happened last night?You raped me!Kyle closed the door behind them with a chuckle, and Caroline backed away from him, her heart hammering as she remembered that laugh, mocking her when she was begging him to stop.Now, if you have any thoughts of walking downstairs and telling your father I raped you, Im going to advise that you reconsider.Caroline would have laughed if her throat hadnt been closing with apprehension.Being stuck in such close quarters with Kyle had scared the hell out of her, and his dark tone hadnt helped.Had he always been so much taller than her?Its the truth Kyles forearm was suddenly there, pressing into her throat as he shoved her back against the closet wall.The truth?The truth is your dad has his head stuck so far up my fathers ass, if you say anything, hell tell you to shut the fuck up, Kyle hissed, increasing the pressure on her throat until she couldnt speak.Im going to save him the trouble.He brought his face close to hers, his disgusting breath hitting her nose.Shed reached up to his arm, digging her nails into the fabric of his shirt to get him away from her neck, but he just cursed at her.If you tell anyone about last night, it will be your word against mine, he said, releasing her neck only to grab her hands and pin them above her head against the wall.But on the off chance that I am arrested, you can bet your ass Ill make bail.And when I do, Ill be coming not just for you, but your little sisters too.Vals ...what?Thirteen?His lips ran across her cheek until they reached her ear, and nausea roiled again in her already empty stomach.It wont take much effort to get them alone, and when I do, well, they wont be as lucky as you.What do you mean?I wont bother to drug them.Caroline shook with fear and anger, picturing Val fighting Kyle, screaming for help.And Ellie ...You wouldnt hurt Ellie, Caroline said harshly.Shes only six.So?Disbelief and terror clawed their way through her until she was heaving.Kyle released her as she doubled over, but his hand fisted in her hair before he left.Remember what I said, sweet Caroline.I mean every single word.Caroline had looked up into that icy blue gaze and known he wasnt bluffing.His father would probably swing bail, and whos to say hed be prosecuted anyway?With the Jennerses connections, Caroline herself could be the one to disappear.Or he could do exactly what he threatened ...Only, what were the chances they would survive the encounter?Kyle would be an idiot to leave behind three witnesses.In the end, hed gotten exactly what he wanted; Caroline was scared out of her mind for her sisters and had kept her mouth shut for more than a decade.Even after Kyle had hurt another girl.Right after Valerie had started at Boise State, she had told Caroline that Kyle had raped her roommate at a party.The girl hadnt pressed charges either, and Val figured Kyles father had paid off the victim and her family.Caroline had been surprised the girls parents wouldnt want the man who had hurt their daughter to pay.If it had been her child, she would have gutted him.Regardless, the thought that Kyle had gone on to victimize more women made her stomach churn, even now.But because you never told anyone what he did to you, he was free to do it again.She had been a kid, barely fifteen, and scared shitless when it had happened.The possibility of reliving the whole thing for the world and nobody believing her had kept her silent.That Kyle might get off anyway and come after her family was enough to give her nightmares for years.Sometimes shed wished she was Jennifer Connelly in Labyrinth, able to say, You have no power over me.But life was never like the movies.The bad guy didnt always lose, the losers didnt always win, and the guy and girl didnt always ride off into the sunset.And despite all the drunkards and bullies shed encountered over the years, Kyles eyes could still render her catatonic.Just as they were now.Im ...Im here to see my dad, she finally managed to choke out.He leaned against the door jam and tsked.Hes resting, actually.Just fell asleep half an hour ago.Then why are you still here?She was proud; there was hardly a tremor in her voice.Im just answering his phone and helping him.Weve become quite close, you know, with Valerie causing him so much trouble and Ellie moving out ...well, hes been under a tremendous amount of stress.The veiled attempt to place the blame on Val and Ellie for Edwards heart attack wasnt lost on Caroline, but she had no witty comeback, no biting retort.Instead, she said, Just tell him I stopped by and give him these.She held out the bag of candy, and Kyle took it, but before she could pull away, his fingers wrapped around her wrist and brought her close enough to whisper, Wouldnt you like to stay and keep me company, sweet Caroline?She jerked away from him and snapped, Touch me again, and Ill gut you.As she walked away, he called, Oh, how I missed that fire.For a second there, I thought youd lost it.As she climbed into her car, she caught sight of him kissing two of his fingers and waving them at her.She wished for half a second shed gone with a lifted 4x4 truck instead of her little Corolla, just so she could climb over the rocky, landscaped yard between them and plow into him.If she took the house down too, so be it.It would be worth it to never see his smug, disgusting face again.Peeling out, she sped down the road, oblivious to speed limit signs.She wanted to put as much distance between her and the bastard as possible.She had planned to spend at least half an hour or more with her father, but that was shot to hell.It was only ten in the morning, and she wasnt due to pick up the keys to her new apartment until eleven thirty.Maybe Gemma Bowers wouldnt mind if she stopped by early.Caroline had decided several days earlierright after the third night in a row of her sister Ellie coming home at three in the morning, giggling and bumping into thingsthat she needed to find a place of her own.When Val had offered to let Caroline stay at her place, shed failed to mention that Ellie was already taking the spare room and the only place available was the living room couch.The first week had been fine, with them taking turns at the hospital, but by the time her father was released, it became business as usual at Casa de Val, which essentially meant sexy noises from Vals room and Ellies midnight stumbling.So shed jumped onto Vals computer and found Gemma Bowerss ad on Craigslist for a two bedroom, one bath apartment with private parking.Shed called Gemma that morning and set up the showing.The place was perfect, and theyd shaken hands on the spot.Gemma had agreed to have a one year lease drawn up to be signed that morning.Val hadnt been happy about the news, acting like Caroline was abandoning her again, but Caroline had been living on her own for too long.Plus, all of the what have you been up to since you left home talks were grating on her.She was used to having space to breathe, and that was exactly what Gemma Bowerss two bedroom apartment was going to give her.Space and an excuse to get away from all the probing questions.And, of course, seeing Kyle had sent her into a twister of rage and turmoil all its own.Even the shaking in her hands hadnt subsided.She needed a place to chill out, to feel safe.A place to decorate however she wanted and to relax in when she got home, where she wouldnt have to listen to Vals disturbing sex noises or deal with Ellie tripping in at all hours, waking her up.Caroline needed all that and a comfortable bed.Valerie definitely hadnt bought her couch for guests to sleep on, that was for damn sure.Exiting off of Main Street, Caroline turned down a narrow alley behind the row of shops.The older stone and brick buildings of Rock Canyon looked dingier from the back, but her new parking spot was behind Gemmas bookstoreChloes Book Nookand right next to the stairs that led to her new place.Caroline wasnt worried about the stairs, since everything she owned currently fit in her trunk and on her backseat.She usually rented furnished apartments to keep from having to sell stuff when she moved on, but once she had everything unloaded here, she planned on making a few shopping trips to Twin Falls to pick up new furniture and dcor.She had been saving up for so long, it was about time she splurged.Caroline saw the parking spot, but as she began to pull in, she almost plowed into the back of a midnight blue motorcycle already parked there.What the hell?Glaring at the crotch rocket, she thrust her gear shift into park and turned off her car, not giving a tinkers damn if someone else tried to come through the alley.She couldnt wait to kick this asshole out of her parking spot.She jumped out and passed the bike slowly, reading the license plate with disgust.BBYBLUE.What a sissy name for a street bike.It was probably some jerk who was afraid of his poor baby getting scratched out on the street.But that was no excuse for taking her spot.Trying to cool her already hot temper, she hummed the lyrics to her favorite Fleetwood Mac song as she came up to the bookstores back entrance and knocked.First, she would pick up her keys, and then she would call a tow truck to remove the motorcycle.Gemma Bowers opened the door, her dark hair pulled back from her face, drawing attention to the paleness of her skin.Gemma was curvy in a natural way and soft looking, with a sweet face.Her hazel eyes were wide behind her glasses, and Caroline could see how shed won the heart of country rock star Travis Bowers who was, from what Caroline remembered, a total hottie.And although Caroline hadnt known her in high school, when shed come to see the apartment the other day, Gemma had been very nice.Hey, Gemma, Im sorry to show up so early, but my morning plans fell through.Is it okay if I sign the lease now?Caroline asked, wondering now at the womans deer in the headlights look.By the way, do you know who I can call to get a tow?Theres some douche wad in my parking spot.Gemma opened her mouth as if to speak, but a deep voice out of sight beat her to it.Its my parking spot.Caroline poked her head past Gemma to see who it belonged to.The man behind the voice was a panty dropper for sure.He was leaning against the counter of the shops break room, but Caroline had a feeling he was as tall as he was muscly.Wide shoulders and rippling arms were hugged by the light cotton of a tight, army green T shirt, and she couldnt miss the bumps and ridges of his pecs and absproof that this guy worked out hard, in all the right places.Caroline tried to say something, but her mouth was too dry, her tongue glued to the roof of her mouth.She hadnt even gotten to his face yet.How long had it been since a man had tongue tied her with his body alone?Too long, apparently.Her gaze finally met his obsidian eyescomplete with ebony lashes framing them thickly, unfairly.His coffee and cream skin was smooth except for the hint of scruff around his chin and a two inch strip of dark hair running down the middle of his head, like a short, tamed Mohawk.She could see the tip of a tattoo on the side of his neck, just above his T shirt, but it was his smile that finally brought her back to reality.It was stretched widewith an edge that told her he knew exactly what he was doing to her, that it happened to him all the timeand his arrogance was like a bucket of ice water.This man was dangerous, cocky ...and he had stolen her parking spot.Worse, hed called it his spot, and here she was, basically going into heat.She wasnt this girl, the one who panted after whatever hot guy crooked his finger at her.Gearing up for battle, she placed a hand on her cocked hip.As pretty as you may be, I am going to have to call bullshit on that one.Gemma leased the upstairs apartment to me and the parking spot along with it.Tall, dark, and douchey stood up, forcing her to tilt her chin skyward and curse her lack of heels.She normally wore them everywhere, but since today was moving day, she had worn comfy shoes for running up and down stairs.Which put her about four inches shorter than normal; at five foot three and a quarter, she was on the shrimpy side when dealing with average men.This guy was definitely above average, probably six foot two in his bare feet.What really pissed her off, though, was the way he was leaning over her now, as if he was trying to intimidate her with his bad boy aura.Please, I eat assholes like you for breakfast.He took a few steps closer, that smug smile never slipping.Well, Travis, Gemmas husband, rented the apartmentand parking spotto me as well.So, looks like we have a bit of an issue here.That threw Caroline, and she swung her focus to Gemma, who looked like she was ready to wring her hands and cry.Please, tell me hes kidding.I wish he was, but apparently, Mr.MoriartyGabemet with my husband yesterday.I didnt even know about this until last night.And you couldnt have given me a heads up?Caroline snapped.I tried to call your cell phone, but it kept going to voicemail.Damn it.Thats because her sisters monster of a dog had taken a shine to stealing her things.Her socks, her phone, her underwear.By the time shed realized it was gone this morning, it was dead, and there was no way to coerce information out of a dog.Crossing her arms over her chest, Caroline glared at the man who was trying to steal her apartment.So, what happens now?Now you take your sweet little ass out of here and find another place to live, Gabe said.Caroline had the sudden urge to flip him off or kick him in the balls.Maybe both.Bite me.If you can wait until I get my bed moved in, Id love to take you up on that.His voice had taken on a dark, husky tone, and she told herself it was so not going to work on hereven as goosebumps prickled her flesh.The thought of those white teeth nipping along her skin made undeniable heat pool between her legs, but she had learned a long time ago that talk was cheap.Despite a short wave of curiosity, there was no way this guy was ever going to get in her pants.Or her apartment.Tempting, but Im not interested.Thats not what your girls are saying.Following his gaze down, she saw her nipples were hard and pushing against the sheer bra beneath her T shirt.Her eyes snapped back up to his, and she sneered, So, I can add inappropriate perv to the long list of nicknames youve already earned in our short acquaintance.Just stating the obvious, princess, he drawled.Before he could open his mouth further, Caroline turned to Gemma.How are you going to fix this?I Theres nothing to fix.I was here first, and Im taking the apartment.Caroline clenched her fists and counted silently to calm herself.Places to rent were hard to come by in Rock Canyon, and she didnt know how much longer she could stand listening to Val and her boyfriend getting it on while she slept on the couch.Focusing her attention on Gemma again, she asked, Has he signed the lease yet?No, I Good.Then you can just hand me the lease you drew up for me, and Ill sign it now, Caroline said, giving Gabe a shrug.Sorry, but I saw the apartment first.Like I said, princess, Gabe said, moving closer until he was nose to nose with her.Unconsciously, her eyes moved to those damn kissable lips.Get your sweet ass out of here Im very sorry about the confusion, Gemma broke in loudly, and when both of them swung their attention her way, Caroline saw her swallow hard.I think I need to talk to Travis before I make any decisions.Caroline gritted her teeth and wanted to scream in frustration, but Gabes dark eyes were watching her again.It was on the tip of her tongue to rip into Gemma about having to ask her husbands permission, but she refrained for the sake of pissing off her potential landlady.Besides, if she threw a bitch fit, it might make hot shot look like a better choice of tenant, and she couldnt let him win.Especially when he was so damn sure of himself.Taking in a deep breath, Caroline said, Fine.Ill call you with another number to reach me in about ten minutes.With one last hostile glare at Gabe, Caroline stormed out of the shop.His apartment?Not gonna fucking happen.Three Attention all the single ladies: Fresh meat has arrived!Oh, and get this, he has a motorcycle.Mmm ...I smell a bad boy.Miss Know It All   GABE MORIARTY WALKED out of Chloes Book Nook, yanking on his gloves.He had been this close to signing the paperwork to the Bowerses apartment until that little wildcat had stormed in, making demands.Now he had to wait until Gemma talked it over with Travis and they decided what to do.Gabe could tell that Gemma had been distraught, and he hadnt wanted to add to her stress by voicing his displeasure, but damn it, he was there first.That uppity witch could go take her attitude somewhere else to live.Speaking of Miss Temper, there was no sign of her.She was probably off to speak to her lawyer or maybe off looking for that tow truck.He snorted.As if anyone was going to touch his bike but him.It was too bad too, cause despite her putting a monkey wrench in his plans, she was fucking hot.With her long dark hair pulled back from her face, her brown eyes had drawn him in, and although hed tried to play cool, hed felt his heart beat faster with every sassy word out of her mouth.You mean that lush mouth?The one that was probably good at a number of things?Straddling his bike, Gabe shrugged into his jacket before grabbing his helmet off the back and slammed it down onto his head, cursing.It didnt matter how hot she was, she was the pain in the ass reason he wasnt getting his apartment, and that pissed him the hell off.Gabe had a plan, and he hated when things didnt go smoothly.Hed driven into town the day before yesterday, planning on surprising Chase Trepasso, an old friend of his, only to find out that Chase was out of town until today.Hed wanted to be settled, already set with a place to live before he dropped in on Chase, just in case the welcome wasnt as warm as hed hoped.It had been sixteen years since hed seen his former best friend, and that last time had been a blur of disbelief, confusion, and rage.Now, he was stuck staying at the Rock Canyon Inn, and when he walked into Chases tattoo shop, there was a chance that Chase would tell him to get the hell out of town.He wasnt going anywhere, thougheven if the Bowerses gave into that prickly princesss temper tantrum.One of the things hed been working onduring the five years hed spent in that tiny Nevada state prison cellwas a list of all the mistakes hed made to get there.And the way hed treated Chase was on it.It had taken him about a year to stop blaming Chase for his own mistake, mostly because he hadnt been ready to admit what an idiot hed been.His prison psychologist had helped him come to that conclusion, and actually, it had been his idea to form the list in the first place.The list had started with the obviousmaking sure Honey was taken care ofand from there, it had grown.Gabe had been checking things off for years, but it seemed like for every wrong he made right, another two wrongs popped up.It had started as a way to help him assuage his guilt but had grown into much more.It quickly became the right thing to do.Hed always known right from wrong, but the lines had blurred for a while there.Hed been trying to walk the line for the last nine years, though, and being in Rock Canyon was just a part of that.It was a central location for what he was trying to build for himself and for his future.Being rural Idaho, halfway between two sets of mountains, with beautiful areas to explore, it was also perfect for a man trying to get a custom motorcycle shop off the ground.And it was only two hours from one of the best assisted living facilities in the country.I wanna see the mountains, Gabey.When hed quit his job in Colorado and uprooted his sister, Honey, and her nurse, Sharla, from the facility where theyd been living for five years, neither had been happy with him.But hed been tired of Denver and tired of working for someone else.So, when hed started researching areas with the best facilities, Sun Valley, Idaho, had come up on his radar.It was surrounded by the Sawtooth Mountains and fulfilled Honeys only request.Backing up his bike, he pulled out and down the alleyway until he hit a side street, making his way back to the main stretch where Chases tattoo parlor sat.It was too early for Chase to be open, but Gabe couldnt stand the idea of lying around the hotel another day either.Instead, revving up the bike, he headed out of town and took a left toward the highway.It was a two hour drive to Sun Valley.Of course, hed have to take a little detour through the McDonalds drive through for a large fries and vanilla shake, or Honey would pitch a fit.But in the big scheme of things, it was a little thing to do for his sister; he had a lot to make up for.Like the fact that he had cost his sister the chance at a normal life.Gabe passed over Highway 84, and the cold wind bit through the leather of his jacket, causing goosebumps to prickle across his skin.He normally wore a hoodie under his jacket for long rides, but hed been too pissed off by the events at Gemmas bookshop to bother going back to the hotel to grab one.He had thought everything was settled; hell, he had been damn excited to move into the little two bedroom apartment.It would be quiet and private, with plenty of space for just him.In Denver, hed been living in a cramped little studio apartment with his TV, bed, and an old recliner hed bought at a garage sale years back.Right now, everything was locked up in a storage unit in Twin Falls.Hed had plans to move everything today, but that was shot to shit.By the time he pulled into the centers parking lot two hours later, his skin was numb, but the cold had helped him think a little more clearly.Maybe Rock Canyon wasnt the right town.This could be a sign that he was on the wrong track and should start looking around at other locations.Grabbing the shakes and bag of fries hed picked up, he walked into the building, calculating all the costs he was looking at for setting up shop in Rock Canyon.Since arriving, hed noticed that places for rent were few and far between, and spaces large enough for his custom built motorcycle shop were even scarcer still.Hed driven by what looked like an old firehouse on the edge of town with a SPACE FOR RENT sign out front, but when hed called, the price had been a little steeper than hed banked on.Especially if he ended up staying at the hotel for an extended length of time.Maybe in another town, hed have better luck.Gabe had been saving for his dream shop for nine years, but the money hed saved was meant to go toward the equipment he needed.He didnt want to have to take out large business loans and have some small town bank manager delving into his past.His past was his own, and he didnt want it spread across town.Especially when it detailed that hed spent five years in prison for an accident hed caused while riding drunk.An accident involving his sixteen year old sister, who had been on the back of his bike at the time.As he came through the front door, the woman at the check in desk, Gillian, waved at him happily.Hello, Mr.Moriarty!Hey, Gillian, he said, signing the visitor log.Is she in her room?Yep, just got back from the pool.Thanks, Gabe said, heading for the stairs that would take him to the second floor and Honeys room.The nice thing about the facility was that it had all the medical staff of a hospital but with studio and one  and two bedroom apartments.Residents could eat in the main dining hall or have their meals in their rooms.It allowed the more independent, functioning occupants the freedom they wanted, along with structured plans for others like Honey.Slipping the other shake between his arm and his body, he knocked on Honeys door.Sharla Baker, Honeys nurse for the last six years, opened the door, her dark eyes widening.Well, bless my soul, Gabriel, we didnt expect you until the weekend.Hey, Sharla.Gabe gave her a hug.The facility offered a fantastic nursing staff, but Sharla had an almost maternal bond with Honey, and she knew his sisters moods.There were times when he wondered what theyd do if she retired, but for now, he loved the gentle, compassionate woman for everything shed done for themabove and beyond what she was paid for.She was family.And although she shared Honeys care with other nurses at night and on her days off, none of them could replace her.I had some time today, so I figured Id come for a visit, he said, walking past her into the room.He caught sight of Honey, sitting by the window, painting.Suddenly all his anger, frustration, and worry drained away as he watched his beautiful sister focus so intently on the canvas.Her hair was cut short, a riot of corkscrew curls that stopped at the back of her neck.She was wearing a simple white dress with light pink flowers that made her caramel skin appear darker.Hey, baby girl, he said softly, knowing that startling Honey when she was consumed by an activity could bring on an episode.She didnt turn around, but Sharla patted his arm before she went to stand next to Honey.Honey, your brother is here.Honey turned slowly, as if coming out of a trance, and Sharla repeated herself.Shifting toward the door, Honeys pretty face broke into a bright, joyful smile.Gabey!Honey struggled to her feet with her hand on the back of the chair, and Sharla put an arm around her waist to steady her.Gabe set the food down on the round table in Honeys little kitchen just before Honey launched herself against his chest.Gathering her close, Gabes stomach twisted as he rocked her back and forth.How you doing, baby girl?I painted the mountains!Come and seeoof!She had tried to pull away excitedly and would have fallen if he hadnt kept a hold of her.Easy.Im not going anywhere.Honeys lower lip started to quiver and her eyes filled up with tears as she rubbed her hip.Gabe hadnt meant to hurt her feelings, but she easily forgot her limitations, and the last thing he wanted was to see her hurt again.Because of him, shed already had her leg pieced back together, using screws and pins that had left one leg shorter than the other.Walking too much was painful, and fast movements could sometimes throw her off balance.Hey, come on now, where is this picture?You know I want to see it.Maybe Ill hang it up in my new place.Honeys face immediately split into an excited smile, the sheen in her eyes disappearing.It was one of the side effects of her brain injury that he would never get used tohow rapidly her moods could shift.One minute shed be laughing and teasing him, and the next shed be screaming and throwing things.It had scared the shit out of him the first time hes seen it, and even now it unnerved him.With his arm still around her waist, she led him over to her easel.Despite her issues with impulse control, Honey hadnt lost any of her artistic talent.She had captured the snowcapped mountains and the cloudy spring sky.It might not have been as cleanly detailed as her work before the accident, but it was still beautiful.It had actually been Honeys love of art that had brought her and Chase together when they were teenagers.They had been too afraid to tell Gabe that they were seeing each other, worried about how he would react to his best friend dating his baby sister.It turned out that they had been right to be concerned.Gabe had taken it hard and had overreacted.He could blame the alcohol hed consumed, but it wasnt just that.When hed caught them, hed been fighting his own issues, which had only fueled the violent pummeling hed given Chase before ordering Honey onto the back of his bike.Looking back, Gabe had a feeling that even if hed caught them kissing when he was stone cold sober, hed have probably flown off the handle anyway.Only he might not have overcorrected on that curve and sent his bike careening off the road.He definitely wouldnt have spent five years in prison, and his sister would have had a real future.Gabe?He realized that Honey had been repeating his name.Sorry, I was just so caught up in your painting.You did good.Honey beamed at him.Her dark eyes and long lashes reminded him of when she was six, and shed wanted a piece of his Halloween candy because shed already demolished hers.Hed given in, unable to resist her puppy dog eyes or the way shed thrown her arms around him, squeezed him tight, and whispered, Youre the best brother ever.If only that were still true.Hed been trying every day to make it up to her.Hed gotten out of prison and spent the last nine years fighting for her, doing everything he could to make her life better.This place was definitely better than the state hospital his mother had left her in.He still wanted to rip his mother apart for putting Honey in that place, despite the fact that shed been dead for almost seven years now.While he was awaiting trial, his mother had sued the hospital for missing a brain bleed on Honeys scans.Shed been awarded millionsplenty of money to give Honey the best carebut instead, his compulsive gambler of a mother had locked Honey up in a place where he wouldnt put his worst enemy.By the time hed gotten out of prison, his mother had blown through nearly everything.When his mother was shot outside of a gaming hall in one of the rougher areas of the city, Gabe couldnt muster too much sadness for her.In the end, shed been a selfish bitch.He could forgive her for a lot, but the way shed turned her back on Honey had been enough for him.Hed claimed her body, used the money in her account to pay for cremation, and then sold everything she owned to pay for Honeys care.If that made him a hard son of a bitch, then so be it.But hed needed to be that way.To survive prison.To be able to protect Honey.Hell, just to deal with life and the uphill battle he was fighting, he had to learn to harden up.Do I get to see your place?Honeys question jarred him, and he hesitated.If it were up to him, Honey would live with him, but Sharla and Honeys former doctor had convinced him that Honey needed structure to avoid the confusion that might lead to violent outbursts.Too much stimuli and change could upset her, and after witnessing Honeys episodes firsthand, he had agreed with them.Soon.Hey, I brought you something, Gabe said, helping her sit down at the little table.Her face lit up when she saw the bag and drink cup.She dove into the bag and pulled out the fries, shoving several into her mouth with a groan.I love French fries.I know, he said, watching her take off the lid of her shake and dip her fries into the ice cream, just like when they were kids.So, tell us about your new apartment, Sharla said, sitting down at the table.The other shake and fries are for you, Gabe said as he sat down next to Honey.That was sweet of you, but Im trying to watch my figure, she said, her eyes twinkling.These days, I cant eat just anything like you young people can.It didnt stop her from sneaking a few fries, though, before repeating, So, your new place ...I havent even moved in yet.It turns out that while the husband had agreed to rent it to me, the wife had promised it to a woman, and when we both showed up to sign the lease, they decided to talk about it first.Gabe was talking more to Sharla than Honey, who was too busy eating to pay attention.Thats terrible, Sharla said.Yeah, and I get the feeling the other potential tenant will make some major waves if the decision goes my way.She just seems like the real uptight, self involved diva type, you know?They should go with the first person to claim it.I agree, Gabe replied, appreciating Sharlas loyalty.But I also dont want to start sh He caught himself at Sharlas warning look.Stuff in a new place and cause problems.Im trying to turn over a new leaf.Psh, just because youre trying not to make waves doesnt mean you let other people push you under the water.He laughed, shaking his head.Im not.But whether they pick me or not, its out of my hands.You should share, Honey said, her words garbled by a mix of fries and milkshake.Gabe stared at his sister, fighting a smile.You think I should share my apartment with a strange woman?Is she strange?Honey asked.No, shes not strange.Shes hot and sexy and trouble on two legs.I just mean that I dont know her.If you lived with her, then you would get to know her, wouldnt you?That gave him pause.It was a two bedroom apartment.If he shared the rent, it would help with the unforeseen expenses he hadnt counted on.Women liked things neat and tidy, didnt they?They could split the housework, and hed hardly be there anyway, what with getting the shop off the ground.All in all, it wasnt a half bad suggestion.He leaned over and kissed the top of her head.Thanks, baby girl.Wanna watch a movie?she asked, jumping up from the table so fast, she almost took out his chin.Sure.Following his sister to the day bed, he sat against the headboard and wasnt surprised that she picked Homeward Bound.It was a favorite of hers.As she climbed up next to him, she leaned her head on his shoulder.Youre the best brother ever.His chest tightened.Not yet, but Im working on it.GABE RODE BACK into Rock Canyon at just after six in the evening and took the main stretch so he could stop by Chases tattoo shop.He parked his bike around the corner on Oak Avenue and realized, as he took his gloves off, that his palms were sweating, and he couldnt seem to slow his heart rate.It was no surprise that he was nervous.The last time hed seen Chase, hed been screaming at him from a hospital bed the morning after the accident, blaming him for everything and telling him to get out.Chase had even visited him once while he was in prison, but hed refused to see him.Gabe had tried to find him when he got out, to make amends, but no one knew where hed ended up.It wasnt until Gabe had taken a trip to Reno and stopped in at a little diner off the highway where Chases mom had worked that hed been able to track him down.Chases stepdad had told him that Chase had moved to a small town in Idaho and was living a really good life there, writing comic books while running his tattoo shop.Gabe had been curious about Rock Canyon and why Chase would have chosen to settle there instead of LA or New York.Chase had always talked about moving somewhere big and booming, where artists were appreciated, whatever that meant.Despite their rocky past, Gabe had kept up with Chases comic book career.Hed even bought a ticket to a comic book convention in Denver, once hed learned that Chase would be signing books there.But in the end, he hadnt made it past the parking lot.Chase was the only person who had been there the night of the accident and who had stuck around for the aftermath.Hed seen Gabe at his worst, and for Gabe, that was the reason facing Chase was so terrifying.Honey could remember bits and pieces sometimes, but for the most part, she was blissfully ignorant and had forgiven Gabe easily.It wouldnt be that simple with Chase.Gabe stepped inside the brightly lit parlor.Chase was standing with his back to him, hanging up some artwork on the wall.Hang on; Ill be right with you, Chase said.No problem.Chase straightened the picture, turned, and paused for a moment, staring at Gabe.The silence and tension became stifling, overwhelming Gabe.He shoved his clammy hands in his pockets to dry them.Bet Im the last person you expected to see here.Not the last but close, Chase said dryly.Yeah, Gabe said, searching for something else to add but coming up empty.
