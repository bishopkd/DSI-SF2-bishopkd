But instead of heading home, he drove to the Sandbox, a bar and grill he frequented on a regular basis.It was dark and smoky and the perfect place for a man to sit and drink a beer without being bothered by anyone.Even though Lucas had been coming here for years, he knew nothing about the bartender except that his name was Joe and he poured a perfect Scotch and soda.Joe nodded to him as he took a stool at the bar and in the blink of an eye Lucas had his drink in front of him.He curled his fingers around the cold glass as he thought once again of kissing Jane.He didnt know her real name, but he liked her sense of humor.He liked the fact that despite everything that had happened to her she hadnt melted down into a hysterical mess.She represented everything he didnt want in his life, a woman who would want a husband, a woman beginning a family.Kissing her had been a major mistake.Even if she were single and as alone as she thought she might be, he had absolutely nothing to offer her.Her mouth had been tempting before hed tasted it, but with that single taste, his desire had winged out of control.Hed wanted to back her up against the wall and explore her mouth further.Hed wanted to cup her full breasts in his hands and feel their warmth, then take her hips and press them against his.He clenched the cold drink glass tighter.She was vulnerable at the moment, and hed be all kinds of a bastard to take advantage of that vulnerability.Still, the thought of kissing her again filled him with an anticipation he hadnt felt for a very long time, and that bothered him.She bothered him in a way no woman ever had.He finished his drink, then nursed a second one until just after seven, reluctant to share the evening meal with Loretta and Jane.Instead he filled up on nuts and pretzels, and wound up making small talk with a salesman from New Jersey who was in town for a convention.Darkness had fallen when he finally left the Sandbox and headed back to his apartment.After sitting in the smoky confines of the bar, he wanted to shower before checking in with Jane and Loretta.The minute he opened his apartment door he sensed something amiss.He froze in the doorway and looked around the living room, every muscle in his body on alert.Lucas was an orderly man.Troy and Micah often teased him about having more than his share of obsessive compulsive disorder when it came to his living space.He pulled his gun as he saw that the magazines in the middle of the coffee table had been moved a fraction of an inch to the right and the papers at his desk werent quite in the same position theyd been in before hed left.Even the picture of him and Loretta wasnt in the exact same place that it had been before hed left that morning.Close, but no cigar.Somebody had been in here.He gripped the gun more tightly and moved stealthily across the living room floor.A glance into the kitchen showed nobody there.Then he headed down the hallway toward his bedroom.His closet door was open just an inch.He knew hed closed it completely after hed gotten his clothes out that morning.He had an obsession about open doors and cabinets, and always made sure they were closed after he used them.Somebody had been in here and it was obvious they hadnt wanted him to know about their presence.Theyd been good.Somebody less observant would never have known anyone had been inside the place.But he knew, and the thought sent a cold chill through him.It took him only minutes to know that there was nobody inside the place now.But somebody had been there.The words went around and around in his head.He stood in the center of the living room, his thoughts racing to make sense of it.Why would anyone want to snoop around his apartment?Nothing appeared to be missing so it hadnt been a burglary.Jane.Her name thundered in his head.Had this been about Jane?Perhaps it was somebody looking for her or evidence of where she might be?He hadnt gotten a license plate number from the van the day before at the store, but had somebody gotten his?And had that somebody used that information to find out who he was and where he lived in hopes that Jane would be here?Time to move, he thought.He stared at the photo of himself and his sister.It wouldnt take a lot of digging for them to learn about Loretta.A question here or there to one of the people in the apartment complex and they would know that Lucas and Loretta were siblings.It wouldnt take a rocket scientist to suspect that Lucas might have stashed Jane with his sister.What was going on?Who was Jane and why did these people want her?What in the hell was going on?He returned to the bedroom, where he packed a duffel bag, then left the apartment.A glance around the hallway showed nobody around and he hurried to Lorettas and let himself in using his key.He dropped his duffel just inside the front door and headed for the kitchen where he could hear the sound of Jane and Lorettas laughter.The two women were seated at the table.The dinner dishes had been cleaned up, but they each had a piece of cake in front of them.Jane had a glass of milk and Loretta had coffee.Both of them looked relaxed and happy.Lucas!Jane said as he walked into the room.Her eyes shone with a bright warmth that stirred something inside him.I was wondering if you were going to show up this evening.Have you eaten?Loretta asked.He nodded.Loretta, were you in my place today?No, why?She looked at him curiously.Jane, you need to pack a bag.Ive got to move you out of here.The warmth in her eyes fled and was replaced with fear.Why?What do you mean?Whats happened?Loretta asked as she stood from the table.Somebody was in my apartment today.I think they were snooping around to find Jane.Janes eyes widened at his words.But surely nobody knows shes here, Loretta said.Maybe not yet, but eventually theyll figure it out.They probably saw the picture I have of the two of us together.If they figure out who you are, eventually theyll check to see if shes here.Jane got up from the table.Ill go get my things.Her voice was slightly shaky.Wait, Jane.Loretta placed an arm around Janes shoulders.Ill get you an overnight bag.Together the two women left the kitchen.Lucas returned to the living room to wait for Jane, his mind still filled with possibilities and suppositions.Right now the only thing he could do was act defensively, try to minimize risk without knowing exactly from what direction the danger might come.He picked up his own bag as Jane and Loretta returned to the living room.Jane had on her coat and clutched a small black bag.Where are you taking me?she asked.There was a wealth of dread in her voice.A safe place, he replied.The safe house?Loretta asked and he nodded.Jane looked at him curiously.Ill explain on the way, he told her, then looked at his sister.Ill call you.Am I in danger?Loretta asked.Lucas frowned.I dont think so.Its apparent whoever was in my apartment wasnt looking for a confrontation of any kind.They got in and out while I was away.Jane grabbed Lorettas hand.I hope I havent brought danger to your doorstep.Im so sorry about all of this.Dont worry, Loretta assured her.Hasnt Lucas told you Im tough?Just make sure theres no sign that she was ever here in the apartment, Lucas said as he opened the door and peered down the hallway.Seeing nobody around, he motioned Jane out the door.Neither of them said a word as they headed for the door that would lead outside into the cold, dark, early November night.When they reached the door, Lucas told her to wait, then stepped out and looked around.Unfortunately the darkness made it difficult for him to see if anyone was hiding in the shadows, cloaked by the night.He drew his gun, unwilling to be surprised without the protection of his weapon.He stepped back inside the door and grabbed Janes arm.Stay right next to me.Were going directly to my car.He felt the tremble of her body as he pulled her close against his side.He felt bad that she was scared, but better scared and on guard than oblivious and vulnerable.He didnt breathe again until they were both safely in his car.As he started the engine once again he scanned the area, looking for any threat that might come out of the darkness.Nothing.He saw nobody lurking about, nobody sitting in a nearby vehicle.But that didnt mean they werent there.Pulling out of the parking lot, he kept his gaze focused on the rearview mirror, looking for any other car that might follow.Even though he saw none, he didnt feel safe, wouldnt feel safe until they reached the house and he was certain that nobody had followed them there.A tense silence filled the car as he drove, constantly watching the rear and side view mirrors.He was grateful for her silence as he needed all his concentration on the road.He drove down neighborhood streets, turning first left, then right at random in an effort to identify whether they had a tail or not.For thirty minutes he drove first one direction, then another and finally felt comfortable that nobody was following them.His tense muscles began to relax and the adrenaline that had pumped through him from the moment hed walked in his front door ebbed slightly.The safe house is a ranch house out in the country, he finally said, breaking the silence that had filled the car.Its owned by a dummy corporation that cant be traced back to Recovery Inc.The only people who know where it is are my partners and their girlfriends, Loretta and Wendall Kincaid, the chief of police.Youll be safe there until we can figure all this out.The only way were going to get anywhere is if I get my memories back, and that doesnt seem to be happening, she said, her frustration obvious.Im sorry, Lucas.Im so sorry about all of this.Theres no need for you to apologize, he assured her.This wont be the first time Recovery Inc.has helped somebody in trouble.He frowned and tightened his hands around the steering wheel.Twice in recent months the safe house had been used, first by Micah, who had hidden out there with Caylee while they fought false murder charges brought against them both.Then the ranch house had been used by Troy to keep his girlfriend, Brianna, safe when a stalker had been after her.Both men had found love while in the safe house, but there was no way Lucas would fall victim to the same thing.He glanced over at Jane, who had her fingers splayed across her belly, as if to protect the life within.She belonged somewhere, to somebody.And even if she didnt, he told himself he wasnt interested in any kind of a relationship with her and the baby she carried.It didnt matter that hed liked kissing her, that he definitely wouldnt mind kissing her againand more.Even though he didnt know her real name, he had a feeling that Jane was a forever kind of woman, that shed want the picket fence and a husband by her side.Shed want family barbecues and a brother or sister for the baby she carried.She definitely didnt strike him as the type who would be ready for an affair with no strings attached and no promises of forever.He reached up and rubbed the back of his neck, where he could feel the ridge of an old scar.An ancient wave of anger welled up inside him as he dropped his hand back to the steering wheel.A vision of his father entered his mind.Lucas couldnt remember a time when Roger Washingtons face wasnt twisted and red with rage.He couldnt remember a kind touch, a loving glance.All of Lucass memories of his father were filled with pain, both physical and mental.That was his legacy.And that was what Lucas would never take a chance of passing on.He couldnt be a bad husband if he never married.And he couldnt be a brutal father if he never had children.The safe house had brought love to his two partners, but there was no way in hell Lucas would allow himself to fall victim to the same emotion.JANE STARED OUT THE WINDOW at the dark landscape.Theyd left the city behind and were traveling on roads with no streetlights.The houses were discernible only by the faint spill of light from windows, and they were getting farther and farther apart.Two days ago, if Lucas had driven her out here in the middle of nowhere she would have been terrified.But in the two days shed spent with him shed come to trust him implicitly.The idea that shed brought danger to the young woman who had opened her home and her heart to her broke Janes heart.Shed die if anything happened to Loretta because of her.Who were these people?And why, oh, why couldnt she remember anything?She desperately needed her memory.She needed her identity to make sense of everything that had happened.She sat up straighter in her seat as he turned down a narrow gravel road.Eventually they came to a clearing where she could see the dark outline of a house with tall trees on either side.Where would this all end?she thought with despair.What if the people who had tried to grab her at the store somehow found her here?Then where would she go?Stop worrying, he said as if he could read her thoughts.She cast him a nervous smile.I cant help it.He pulled up in front of the house, killed the engine and turned to look at her, his eyes dark and glittering in the faint illumination from the dashboard.Youll be safe here.And who knows, maybe in the next couple of days your memories will come back.I hope so, she said fervently.She changed positions in the seat, her back aching with a dull throb.That night when you found me in the car and I realized I had some sort of amnesia, I was sure that once I got a good nights sleep Id wake up and everything would be all right.But Ive had two good nights of sleep now and still nothing.Its only been a couple of days, he said.He pulled the keys from the ignition and turned off the lights.Come on, lets get settled inside.As they got out of the car, the unusually cold wind seemed to blow right through her, chilling her to the bones.But she knew it wasnt the wind that made her cold; rather it was fear of the unknown.She felt somewhat better when they were in the house and Lucas had turned on the lights.The living room was pleasant, although decorated as impersonally as a motel room.The kitchen is in here, he said.Ill head out first thing in the morning and get some groceries.The kitchen was large and airy and decorated with bright yellow accents.From the kitchen he led her down a hallway.You can stay in here, he said as he stopped at the first doorway.The bathroom is across the hall.Ill stay in the bedroom in the back.He set her overnight bag on the double bed.Dont look so scared.Youre going to be just fine.The warmth of his deep voice helped ease some of the tension that had tightened her muscles since the moment hed walked into Lorettas kitchen and told her to pack a bag.She shrugged off her coat and tossed it on the chair just inside the bedroom door.I just wish I knew what was going on, she said softly.She sat on the edge of the bed and rubbed her lower back with one hand.One thing you dont have to worry about is support from me, he said.If I wasnt in until the end before, I am now.His eyes narrowed.They made a big mistake when they came into my apartment and invaded my privacy.He frowned.Are you all right?She nodded.Just a little backache.Its no big deal.Its not labor pains, is it?She nearly laughed out loud at the horrified look on his face.The tough exnavy SEAL with a gun on his shoulder looked scared to death at the idea of a babys birth.No, it isnt labor, she assured him.Just a backache.It will probably be gone by morning.Then Ill just say good night, he said.If you need anything Im just down the hall.He disappeared from the doorway.She wanted to call him back.She wanted him to stay with her throughout the long, lonely night, hold her in his arms to keep away any nightmares that might try to rear their ugly heads.Instead she got up from the bed and closed the door, then pulled her nightgown from the bag.It was after nine and she was tired.She took her nightgown and toothbrush into the bathroom across the hall and changed, then brushed her teeth and stared at her reflection in the mirror.Who are you?she asked the woman who stared back at her.With a tired sigh she turned away from the mirror.Even though she was exhausted, she feared the night to come.Even more fearful was the idea that shed sleep soundly and wake up the next morning with nothing changed, no memories returning.Lucas had told her he was in until the end, but she knew if too much time went by he would start encouraging her to go to the police.And although she didnt understand it, that idea horrified her.Did she have a husband who was a cop?An abusive man shed run to escape?Or was she wanted by the law and running from a prison sentence?There were so many questions without an answer in sight.As she left the bathroom she heard the faint sound of Lucass voice coming from the back bedroom and assumed he was on the phone with somebody.Perhaps telling his partners of this latest development, she thought.She turned off the light and got into the unfamiliar bed.Lying on her back, she watched the shadows of tree limbs dancing in the moonlight on the ceiling and tried to empty her mind of the million questions that played there.She must have fallen asleep because the next time she opened her eyes, the sun was shining through the window and the scent of frying bacon and fresh coffee hung in the air.She kept her eyes closed, for a moment fantasizing that it was her husband in the kitchen preparing a morning meal for his beloved pregnant wife.And after breakfast, hed rub her aching back with loving hands as he whispered how much he loved her.Squeezing her eyes more tightly closed, she tried to summon an image of the man, but all that came to her mind was a vision of Lucas.Her mouth burned as she remembered the taste of his lips, the fire they had ignited in her, a flame of desire.Shed only known him for a couple of days and yet she was more than a little bit crazy about him.Was it possible she didnt want to go to the authorities because she knew that would be the end of their time together?It was a shameful thought and it pulled her out of bed and across the hall for a showera cold shower to cool thoughts of Lucas and his sinfully soft lips.Once she was dressed, she felt better prepared to face whatever the day might bring and the man who was precariously close to owning her heart.Ah, I thought I heard you up and about.Lucas greeted her as she walked into the kitchen.She stopped short and for a moment forgot how to breathe.He stood at the stove, clad only in a pair of jogging pants that rode low on his lean hips.His black hair was boyishly tousled, but there was nothing boyish about his broad muscled chest or the stubble of dark whiskers across his jaw.He looked hot and she felt his heat warming every part of her body.You hungry?he asked.You have no idea, she muttered more to herself than to him.I have to admit Im not the best of cooks, but I figured I could rustle up some bacon and eggs.Sit and Ill get you a glass of juice, he instructed.She slid into a chair at the table and tried to look at anything but him.You must have gotten up and out early.Theres a twenty four hour grocery store not far from here.I got up at dawn and got enough supplies in for a couple of days.How do you like your eggs?Id recommend scrambled.She smiled.Scrambled is fine.He turned toward the refrigerator and she saw the scars on his back.They were faint, but discernible, and crisscrossed the expanse of his back.Lucas, what happened to you?He whirled around to face her.Your back.What happened to your back?she asked.A myriad of emotions played across his features before they finally settled on calm acceptance.He turned back to grab a carton of eggs from the fridge.My father happened to me, he replied after a long hesitation.She stared at him for a long moment as his words sank in.He beat you?Her heart ached for him as she realized that must have been what hed meant when hed told her it had always been him and Loretta against the world.Just about every day of my life until I turned eighteen and joined the navy.He cracked several eggs into a bowl and offered her a tight smile.He was a miserable bastard who for whatever reason decided early in my life that I was the source of his misery.Did he drink?Was he drunk when he beat you?She couldnt imagine a parent doing that to a child unless he was out of his mind on drugs or alcohol.And even then it was unimaginable.No.He was always stone cold sober whenever he beat me.What about Loretta?Did he beat her, too?Never touched her.He poured the egg mixture into an awaiting skillet.Maybe he instinctively knew that if he did, Id kill him.He said the words matter of factly and Jane wondered what kind of scars had been left behind that couldnt be seen with the naked eye.Loretta was only about five years old the first time she crept into my room after Id gotten a beating.He pushed the button on the toaster.She had a wet washcloth and placed it over my forehead, then held my hand until I finally went to sleep.He smiled again, this smile with more warmth.Even then she was taking care of the sick and wounded.After each and every beating I got, it was Loretta who came into my room to bring me water or rub salve on my back.What about your mother?Where was she when all this was happening?Jane asked.She was sitting in her chair, or making dinner or watching television.She was emotionally disengaged.She neither encouraged him nor stopped him.Did your father beat her?she asked.Not that I remember.She didnt seem particularly afraid of him.She just didnt seem to love Loretta and me enough to fight for us.For a long time after I was grown I wasnt sure who I hated more, him or her.He picked up a spoon and stirred the eggs and smiled at her once again.Dont look so stricken, Jane.I survived and Im probably stronger for it.The toast popped up, and as he buttered it, Janes heart opened wider to him.There were other ways to gain strength than to survive a horrendous childhood, she thought.I cant imagine being hit by my parents, she finally said.My mother always said she could tell when I was fibbing because Id tug on the end of my hair, but I was always punished with a time out or grounding, never hit.She looked at him in surprise.I remembered that.She frowned and concentrated on the faint memory that stirred inside her head.My mothers name was Bernice, but everyone called her Bernie.And what was her last name?He stared at her intently.She reached for it, trying desperately to put a last name to the womans face that filled her mind, but it was no good.The vision fell away and no matter how hard she tried she couldnt summon it again.She shook her head.No, its gone.She sighed in frustration.Its okay, he assured her as he ladled the food on plates.Its a good sign that you had even a single memory.Maybe that means theyll all start coming back.He placed her plate in front of her.And its good information to know, about the hair tugging, he teased.She laughed and picked up her fork.I cant imagine ever lying to you.Youre the only one I trust completely right now.Im the only one you know right now, he returned as he joined her at the table.True, but I have a feeling if there were a dozen people in my life, youd still be the one I trusted most.In fact, Im thinking when my little boy is born, Ill name him Luke, after you.Any teasing light that had warmed his eyes vanished.Dont, Jane.Dont what?she asked.Dont make me into some kind of a hero.His eyes grew hard and a knot pulsed in his jaw.Im just the man who is stuck with you until we can figure out where you really belong.She stared at him for a long moment.She might have lost all her memories, but she still remembered what it felt like to be hurt.Pregnesia Chapter SevenIm heading in to the office to meet with Troy and Micah, Lucas said three days later as Jane sat at the kitchen table, drinking a glass of orange juice.I should be back by dinnertime.He needed to check in with his partners and stop by his sisters place, but more than anything he needed to escape from Jane and the tension that had built to intolerable proportions in the last three days of isolation.She nodded.Ill have something ready for dinner.It had quickly become habit that she cooked dinner and they both did the cleanup afterward.The domestic nature of their time in the house was definitely starting to get under his skin.Thanks, he replied.Lock up behind me.Ill see you later.He grabbed his coat and pulled it on, then walked out the front door and into the unusually cold, gray day.There was a taste of snow in the air.The weathermen on the news the night before had talked about the possibility of an early snowstorm.Just what he neededto be snowed in with the woman who was slowly driving him out of his mind.
