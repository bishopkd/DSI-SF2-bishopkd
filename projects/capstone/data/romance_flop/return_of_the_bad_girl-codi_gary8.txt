He owns the tattoo shop down the street, he said, reaching up to trail his thumb across the skin of her neck.He saw her lips twitch like she was fighting a smile.Of course your best friend is a tattoo artist.Reaching out to cup the back of her neck, he growled, Whats that supposed to mean?What are you trying to say, woman?Nothing, she said, giggling.Are you trying to say that us bad boy types stick together, huh?he said, poking her ribs with his other hand until she was screaming.No!Im sorry!Stop!Gabe brought her closer as her laughter subsided.If Im going to help you make this cake, I better go with you to the store.Since you lack my mad culinary skills, I cant rely on you to get everything I need.Caroline tried to hit him playfully, but he caught her hand.Dipping her, he kissed her hard and fast until she was clinging to him.When he had her right where he wanted her, he lifted her back to her feet and smacked her ass.Come on, sous chef!Times a wasting.DESPITE GABES CAVEMAN LIKE teasing, Caroline was glad hed offered to come with her.It had only taken a few minutes to get to the store, and when they walked inside, Gabe ripped off the bottom of the list theyd made and handed it to her.You go grab this, while I get everything else.She glanced down at the scrap of paper.Birthday card.Very funny, she said, smacking his arm before she grabbed a cart.Give me that cart, and go pick out the card.You can meet me in the cake aisle when youre done, he said, leaning down like he was going to kiss her.Just before their lips touched, he turned his face away and propelled the cart forward, placing both feet up on the lower bar.Jerk, she called after him, ignoring the stares from several shoppers as she headed toward the card aisle.Caroline saw the clerk at checkout stand one and was tempted to stick her tongue out at her.Every time she came in, the clerk pretended not to see Caroline standing in line unless other people started lining up behind her.She vaguely remembered the woman from high school but had no idea what shed done to her.Stopping in front of the wall of cards, she started picking them up one at a time, reading the front and inside.After several duds, she found one with an old woman and a funny innuendo about gravity on the inside and picked up the envelope that went with it.When she spun around, she ran smack into Marcus Boatman.Yikes, sorry, I didnt know anyone was there.Its okay, beautiful, Marcus said, shoving his hands into his jean pockets.What are you up to?Caroline didnt like him calling her that but let it go for now.Just getting some stuff together for my sisters birthday.Yeah?Ellie or Valerie?Valerie.Thats cool, he said, cracking his knuckles, something he used to do to intimidate people or when he was nervous.So, I guess you cant go out to dinner or anything later, huh?Seriously?He is not asking you out!Um, considering your girlfriend assaulted me for bumping into you, I really dont think a date is a good idea, she said, grabbing a hundred dollar gift card to iTunes too.Oh, Shelby and I arent seeing each other anymore.What she did at Bucks was out of line, and Im really sorry about the whole thing.Great.Thats nice of you to say, Marcus, but Im really not interested.He seemed surprised.Are you seeing someone?Yes, I mean, maybe, she said, still unsure what to call her thing with Gabe.Besides, you and I just arent compatible.How do you know that?he asked, stepping into her path when she tried to leave.Youve never given me a chance.Frustrated, she snapped, Marcus, Im just not interested, okay?He was angryshe could tell by the clench of his jawbut what was she supposed to say?Shed tried to be nice, and he hadnt taken no for an answer.You know what?I always thought the women of this town were just being bitches about you, but I think I was wrong, he said, sneering at her.You really are a teasing slut who likes attention.What the fuck are you talking about?Are you high?I have never given you any encouragement.If anything, Ive avoided you since I got back to town.But somehow, I just keep bumping into you.Please, explain to me how Ive led you on and teased you?His mouth opened but no sound came out.People were gathering at the end of the aisle, but she ignored them as she continued.Get this through your thick skull.I.  Dont.Want.You.Never have.The only reason I ever hooked up with you in high school was because I was drunk, and I wanted to get back at Shelby.Since then, I havent thought about you once.Gabe appeared behind the crowd, his face a mask of concern.Smiling at him, she gave a little wave.The crowd turned around to look at him, but he ignored them, his gaze shifting between her and Marcus.Youve got this.Staring into Marcuss beet red face, Caroline spoke softer.You can call me a slut if it will make you feel better about yourself, but I never teased you.That was something you created in your own mind.If I was you, Id crawl back to Shelby on my hands and knees and beg her forgiveness.I dont even like her, but there arent very many women who will put up with a stupid man like you.Marcus rushed past her, but she didnt even turn around.She just walked up to the edge of the crowd and said, Excuse me.The group parted, and even Mr.Hall stood back silently as she made her way to Gabe.She could feel the hard stares of the people around her, but she wasnt going to turn the other cheek.Not anymore.She wasnt going to just sit back and take their abuse.If they wanted to talk to her about the past and move on, that was one thing.But she wasnt the same girl, and she wasnt going to keep asking for their forgiveness.You okay?Gabe asked, taking the card from her hands.He held his arm out to her, and she snuggled into his side.Yep, Im good, she said and took the cart.I have to say, Im usually the one who people want to start shit with, Gabe said.Welcome to my life, Caroline whispered.Did you get everything?I did.What do you say we get the fuck out of here and bake that cake?A few horrified gasps let Caroline know that even though most of their audience had wandered away, there was still an eavesdropper or two who didnt appreciate the F bomb.She saw that the rude clerk and Mrs.Andrews were standing in front of the nearest checkout stand.Pushing the cart toward them, Caroline smiled.Were ready.Well, Im going on break, the clerk said, flipping off her light.Becky, turn that light back on and check out Ms.Willis, Mr.Hall said from behind them.Becky ...Becky ...Images of a punk rock girl screaming at her in high school flashed through Carolines brain.She couldnt remember what shed done to piss off Becky, but obviously, it had been worth holding a grudge.Mrs.Andrews walked behind the checkout stand and addressed the blonde bag girl.Jenny, dont forget to bring home milk.Sure, Mom.Mrs.Andrews lowered her voice but not before Caroline heard, And do not talk to them.Becky snickered, and Caroline looked right at her.Do I know you or something?Beckys mouth dropped open, as if shocked.You dont remember me?she cried.Should I?You hooked up with my boyfriend, Charlie!Caroline turned to Gabe and said, I dont remember a Charlie.Thats too bad, Gabe said.Charlie sounds like a swell guy.Caroline smothered a laugh as she dug for her wallet.She found a couple of twenties and handed them to Becky, who counted her change in short, jerky motions.When she slammed the drawer shut and slapped the change down on the counter, Caroline shook her head.I dont remember hooking up with your boyfriend, but if I did, Im sorry.I was kind of a mess.Beckys lip quivered like she was going to cry, the only sign that shed heard Caroline.Youre Valeries sister, right?Caroline?the blonde bag girl asked as Caroline and Gabe picked up their groceries.You couldnt tell by the villagers with the pitchforks?Caroline asked.Jenny laughed, and held out her hand.Im Jenny Andrews.Val used to be friends with my older sister.Caroline remembered her older sister, but their mother was even harder to forget.It was tough to find a more judgmental, self righteous bitch than Mrs.Marci Andrews.Oh, yeah, I remember, Caroline said.Is it true youve been all over the world?Well, Ive lived lots of places, but Ive never been anywhere overseas except London, Caroline said, giving Gabe a one minute sign with her finger before he continued toward the door.Oh, wow, what was it like?Jenny asked, taking their empty cart back toward the front.Why dont I give you my number, and you can call me about it sometime?Caroline said, searching her purse for a pen.I normally wouldnt mind hanging out, but its Vals birthday, and I have to bake a cake.Oh, Im so sorry.My mom always says I talk too much and that ladies should be of few words.Do not listen to your mother, Caroline said firmly.You are unique and fun.Dont change for anyone.In case you havent figured it out yet, adults dont know everything.Jenny giggled.No, they sure dont.Twenty One A man who can cook is worth his weight in gold.Or at least in chocolate.Miss Know It All   THEY MADE IT home from the grocery store, and Gabe sent her off to feed the kittens while he got situated.When she returned fifteen minutes later, Gabe was standing by the sink, washing his hands, and she saw that he had not only cleaned up her mess but the kitchen as well.Have I mentioned how much I hate doing dishes?she asked as she kissed his back.So thank you.Before he could answer, she grabbed a doughnut out of the box theyd picked up and jumped onto the counter.What do you think youre doing?he asked.She paused midbite and chewed slowly before answering.Im savoring this delicious chocolate doughnut while I watch you make my sisters cake?Taking an apple fritter from the box, he bit into it and shook his head.No.This is not rocket science, and you are going to learn how to make a box cake if it takes us a hundred tries.Grumbling, she finished her breakfast and jumped down to wash her hands.The minute they were dry, a mixing bowl and a carton of eggs were shoved in her hands.Hup two, lets get this cake made.Despite her protests that shed just ruin it, Gabes gruff instructions and teasing did make the process fun.While she was beating the eggs, oil, and water into the powder with the mixer, he came up behind her.Before she knew what he was about, hed wrapped his arms around her and covered her hands with his.First of all, youre spraying batter all over the walls because the speed is too high, he said, adjusting the mixer, and if you do this kind of circular motion, it helps.With his hands covering hers, he helped her guide the mixer in a circle, going around the base of the bowl and back into the middle.She realized that as their arms were moving, so were their bodies, and with every circle, he was rubbing against her.Caroline didnt even bother hiding her grin as she felt his hard on through the back of her yoga pants.Ah, that really does help.See?You got this, he said, his lips grazing her neck.He released her hands and splayed his across her stomach.When he grasped her right breast, kneading the flesh through her T shirt, she bit back a moan and forgot to keep the mixer in the batter.Whoa, he said, laughing.Maybe you cant multitask.She noticed the spots of batter on the counter and the front of her shirt, and groaned.Does it at least look smooth?Mmm hmmm, he said as his other hand slipped inside her yoga pants.For a moment, Caroline wondered what he would think about her lack of panties.Then she grabbed his wrist and yanked his hand out.You are supposed to be helping.I am helping.No, youre playing with me, she said, unlocking the beaters from the base and turning in his arms with a beater in each hand.Wanna lick the batter?Depends, he said, running a finger along the metal and spreading the batter across her exposed chest.You are such aGabe bent down and dragged his tongue across her skin, the bar of his tongue ring sliding smoothly along the top of her breasts, causing her nipples to tighten and her stomach to bottom outperv.Im making baking interesting, he said, pulling her scoop neck T shirt down, along with the cup of her bra, and dribbling batter over her nipple.You know, consuming raw eggs can cause salmonella poisoning, she said, even as her eyes closed at his first flick on her hard peak.When his whole mouth closed over her areola and sucked, she dropped both beaters on the counter and held onto the back of his head.Releasing her breast and pulling her bra and shirt back in place, he came back up, grinning.I like to live dangerously.GABE RINSED OFF the beaters and put the mixer back in the cupboard as Caroline bent over to slide the cake in the oven.I hope this one cooks right.I told you; you just had the rack too high, he said, drying his hands.He was just about to take her for that shower he had been fantasizing about, when Googlie and Possum came running into the kitchen, meowing loudly.I think someone is hungry again, Caroline said, pulling formula, canned food, and bottles from the cupboard.I think theyre a couple of cock blocking fuzz butts, Gabe grumbled.When Caroline laughed, his chest tightened and his stomach turned in knots.In the last twenty four hours, he had teased and played and laughed more than he had since he was a kid.Since before the accident.And it was all because of this woman.Since you met Caroline, youve been spouting internal poetry.Remember, she said this wasnt anything more than convenient.But as she passed by him to feed the kittens, she kissed his cheek.And actually patted the front of his jeans.Be patient, big boy.Ill get to you in a minute.He knew she was teasing him, but damn, he hoped she wasnt kidding.Caroline bent over but before he could fully admire the view, she stood back up with two frantic kittens.Here, take one.He grabbed Possum and one of the bottles, wincing as the sharp claw dug at his hand.Chill out, buddy, its coming.Gabe followed Caroline over to the couch and sat next to her.She let Googlie knead her chest as he sucked down his bottle.When do these things stop nursing?Gabe asked as he rubbed Possums tiny ears.Zoe said that the mother usually weans them at six to eight weeks.Im supposed to start them on gruel this week.I think they need another bath, Gabe said, wrinkling his nose.Ill give them one before I leave, Caroline said.What time is your party?Five, she said.Then, almost as an afterthought, she asked, Would you wanna come with me?He almost dropped the bottle, he was so surprised.Family functions arent exactly my strong suit.Understood.I just thought that since you helped me with the cake, you might want to reap some of the benefits.Wouldnt your family be upset if you brought me at the last minute?No, theres going to be a bunch of people there, she said, pulling the empty bottle out of Googlies mouth.Gabe watched her stand up, thinking about what the invitation meant.No woman had ever invited him home to meet her family.Realizing that Possum was sucking nothing but air, he pulled the bottle away.Sorry, bud, I was thinking.After taking the kitten into Carolines room and setting him in the litter box, he stood there for a minute.Hed decided last night that Caroline was what he wanted.Was this her way of showing him shed changed her mind about this being convenient for her?When he was done washing his hands in the bathroom, he walked out into the kitchen and found Caroline washing bottles in the sink.Slipping his arms around her waist, he asked, So, is this party casual, or do I have to wear a tie?Its casual, she said, drying her hands before placing them over his.Hmm, so I should wear my T shirt that says, I am the party?Please tell me youre joking, she said, turning in his arms.Fine.Ill pull out my shirt that looks like a tux.Okay, maybe Ive changed my mind, she said, frowning up at him.I rescind your party invite.Shit, Im just trying to class the place up, he said.Right, Caroline said, wrapping her arms around his waist.So, does that mean youll go with me?Yeah, I guess.Its like you said; I helped make the cake, he said, leaning down to kiss her softly.I should enjoy all the benefits.Hmm, so what do I have to bake to get you to take me to the airport on Thursday?she asked against his lips.You cant bake.Okay, what can you teach me to bake, so youll drive me to the airport?I dont know.That sounds like a lot of work, with very little re Her mouth dipped to take his nipple, T shirt and all, into her mouth, stopping whatever he was going to say.Her hand slipped down and between them, cupping him through his pants, and he groaned, Yeah, sure, I can drive you.Good, she said, pulling away and wrinkling her nose.Now, how about you just go shower, so I dont show up with Stinky McGee?You gonna join me?he asked, stepping away to pull his T shirt over his head.I already showered, she said.Sniffing her playfully, he said, I think you missed a spot.When she smacked out at him, he grabbed her arm, dipped his shoulder to hoist her up, and carried her like a sack of potatoes.She laughed as she screamed, Gabe, no!It takes forever to dry my hair!I never said anything about your hair.I said you missed a spot.Im sure there are other places besides your head that need washing.CAROLINE LED GABE up the walkway to the front door of Valeries house.Val had bought the little house on a few acres last year, when shed moved from Boise, and although other houses were close enough to see, there was still space between them for privacy.Lots of cars, Caroline said when they reached the top of the porch.Yeah, looks like the party is in full swing, Gabe said, holding the cake in his hands.Caroline rang the doorbell before she said, I apologize in advance.For what?he asked.The door swung open, and Valerie squealed.Gabe, Im so glad you could make it.That, Caroline said as Valerie came out and gave her a hug.Come on in, you guys, Val said, leading them into the house.Weve got the fire pit going out back, and Justins at the barbeque, although I saw his hot dogs, so Id go with a hamburger.Who is this?Ellie said from the couch.Umm ...Caroline said, unsure how to introduce him.Im Gabe.Oh, youre Gabe, Ellie said, getting up from the couch and walking over to them slowly.Caroline noticed her sisters wrist was wrapped with a nude nylon bandage and anger burned through her.What happened to your wrist?Oh, I just sprained it trying to change my tire.Yeah?Well, that sucks, Caroline said, blown away that her super confident and sexy sister would let someone abuse her.Why not?You did the same thing, letting Kyle get away with what he did.If anyone wants a dog, I believe theyre ready, a male voice called from the back of the house.Gabe touched her arm and said, Im going to grab some food.How many hot dogs do you want?One, thanks, Caroline said, waiting until Gabe had walked away before she grabbed Ellies good wrist.Come with me.Ellie started to protest, but Caroline ignored her until they reached Vals room.She pulled her sister inside and shut and locked the door.Turning to face Ellie, she said, This has to stop.I told you And Im telling you, I know what it looks like when my sister is getting knocked around, Caroline said, thinking of a bartender shed employed.The womans husband was a mean son of a bitch and had beaten her so badly, hed put her in the hospital.You need to tell someone what hes doing to you, Ellie.Ellie laughed, though there was no humor in it.Who are you to tell me what I need to do?Ellie sounded so hostile that Caroline hesitated, and for a minute, she wasnt sure what to say.I just dont like seeing you hurt, thats all.You dont know anything, so why dont you just mind your own fucking business?Ellie snapped, heading for the door.Caroline blocked her way.I know you deserve better than black eyes and bruised wrists.You deserve a man who wouldnt hurt you for the world.Oh, cause its so easy for you to give me advice.Cause youve never made any mistakes or messed up, right?Of course I have, which is why Why, what?You think you can give me advice cause youve been there?Ellie countered.You dont know anything about what Im going through, so dont start butting in on my business and telling me what I should do, Caroline.Ellie pulled Caroline out of the way and left the room.Several seconds later, the front door slammed.Way to ruin the party, Caroline.Everything Ellie said was true.Caroline didnt have any right casting stones.Hey, whats going on?Val asked, peeking her head in.Nothing, Caroline said, clearing her throat.I suggested that maybe Ellie needed to see a doctor about all this clumsiness, and I guess I overstepped.She has been crazy accident prone, Val said, coming fully into the room and shutting the door.I invited Daddy.What did he say?Caroline asked, surprised.He couldnt come to the phone, but I gave all the details to Teresa, Val said sadly.I was just hoping he might make an effort, you know?I know, honey, Caroline said, wrapping her arms around her sister.Caroline couldve told Val that theyd spent too many years as kids, waiting for their dad to make an effort, but considering how well her most recent sisterly advice had gone over, she stayed quiet.Speaking of Daddy, have you heard anything else on why hes digging stuff up on Kyle?Caroline asked casually.Nothing new, but I imagine Senator Jenner is very thorough at hiding things.Why are you asking?Im just curious.Dads adored Kyle since we were kids.Thats because theyre both assholes, and like follows like.Dad is nothing like Kyle, Caroline snapped.Trust me; they are both cruel, unfeeling bastards.You dont know I do know, Caroline said, avoiding Vals gaze.Val paused, studying Carolines face, and then she turned white.Son of a bitch!Val headed for the bedroom door, and Caroline knew exactly what she was doing.No!Caroline landed on top of Val, pinning her against the door.Get off me!Im going to kill that motherfucker and roast his dick on my barbeque!Someone started pounding on the other side of the door, and Caroline stumbled back as it was pushed open.Is everything okay?Justin asked.Gabe stood just over his shoulder.Val pushed past them, with Caroline hot on her heels.Val?Justin called.Caroline?Gabe echoed.Val was halfway down the walkway outside when Caroline caught her arm and swung her around.Will you just stop?Are you fucking kidding me?I cant believe you didnt kill him after it happened, Valerie cried, sucking in air.When did it happen?Did you tell Dad?Caroline saw Justin and Gabe in the doorway and pleaded, Can we not do this here?Answer me!Caroline grabbed her arm hard and snapped, You listen to me.This is my business, and you will not embarrass me.Why would you be ashamed of anything?Val asked.You didnt do anything.There are reasons why I didnt tell you or anyone else about this.But did you tell Daddy?Is that why he really made you leave?Val asked insistently.No.I only told him recently.Oh my God, Val said softly.Youre the reason hes digging shit up on Kyle.Caroline took a deep, shaky breath.Please, Val, just stay out of it, okay?I dont want you involved.But Caroline shook her head.I promise I will tell you everything, every reason why I never said anything, but now is not the time.Val said nothing for several long minutes, and then: When I told you what he did to my roommate, why didnt you tell me then?Tears stung Carolines eyes.I was afraid youd blame me for what happened to her.Because I never told.Caroline looked away from her sister, ashamed by her admission, but when Val wrapped her arms around her, she froze.I dont blame you.Vals softly spoken words made Caroline sag against her, sobbing.Shh, it will be all right.I can take her, Gabe said, next to them, but Caroline looked away from him.She didnt want him to see her like this.Val squeezed her again and shook her head.Shes my sister.I know, Gabe said, before adding, I promise Ill take care of her.Val released Caroline, and Gabe scooped her up in his arms, carrying her toward the car.Caroline looked up in time to see Justin come down the walk and hold out his arms to Val.She went into his embrace, wrapping her arm around his waist and looking up at him with so much love.Caroline was happy for her, glad she had come out of their dysfunctional childhood whole and made the best of it.Hell, Val had made the best of it and then done better.She was happy.Happiness had been elusive to Caroline for most of her life.When they reached the car, Caroline whispered, Did you hear?Gabe let her slide down his body as he took her keys from her.Did you hear?she asked, louder, angrier.I had already guessed, Gabe said, opening her door.What?But ...how?She felt his rough palm brush her hair back, but Caroline couldnt look him in the eye.It was just a feeling I had.I didnt want to ask you about it, in case I was wrong.And now?Do you want to ask me something?she said, climbing into the front seat.Still outside the car, he squatted down next to her and took her chin in his hands, forcing her to finally meet his gaze.Whether you tell me or not is up to you, he said, stroking her cheek.It wont change the way I think of you.Raw emotion choked her.How ...how do you see me?He leaned forward, brushing her lips with his.I see a woman who was hurt and lashed out at others because of it.She bit her lip as he continued.And then that woman overcame her pain, grew from all that anger, and turned her life around.And I see a woman who, because of everything shes been through, can look at the people around her and find the good that she thought was lost a long time ago.With a sob, she wrapped her arms around his shoulders and kissed him, cradling the back of his head.He returned the kiss for a minute or two before he pulled away and squeezed her hand.To be continued.Twenty Two Being loved is not the greatest gift.The greatest gift someone can give is acceptance.Miss Know It All   CAROLINE HAD NOT been blissfully happy in her entire lifeexcept for brief times during her childhoodbut lying in bed now with Gabe was pretty damn close.Theyd come home from her sisters and fallen into bed, taking their time with each other until theyd been too sated to move.Now, in the afterglow, Carolines mind drifted to all the things she hadnt shared with Gabe.It didnt seem fair that he had told her about his mother and sister, about his accident, and yet she had shared nothing about herself.Had she closed herself off from true intimacy?Was she cutting Gabe short because she really didnt think they were right for each other or because vulnerability scared the shit out of her?Clearing her throat, she took a chance.My dad didnt really have much time for me or either of my sisters when we were growing up.Not until Mom died just after my fifteenth birthday.Gabes hand stroked over her back.Im sorry.Its okay, it was just ...Caroline swallowed hard, trying to ease the emotional ball welling up in her throat.Sudden.I mean, one minute we were chasing each other around the backyard and the next, she was on the ground.The memory still played out in her mind, clear as day, and she could remember the panic that engulfed her as she yelled for help.Kneeling down next to her mothers body, she had grabbed her shoulders to shake her, pleading with her.Ellie was screaming, and Val was ...She just stood there like a statue.I had to call nine one one and take care of my sisters until they got our dad.Its funny, Caroline said, sniffling, the police officer who notified my dad only told him there had been an accident, so he didnt leave the office right away; he didnt think it was an emergency.Gabes arms tightened around her, and he murmured into her hair, and she couldnt deny how much she craved that.The understanding and the comfort.Snuggling into his chest, she continued.The doctors said shed had a heart murmur, but that it wasnt life threatening.Laughing bitterly, she whispered, I guess they were wrong about that, huh?They make mistakes; theyre human, Gabe said, rubbing her back.Believe me, I cursed doctors for the longest time after what happened to Honey, but it didnt do me any good to blame other people.Instead, you continue to blame yourself, Caroline said, looking up from his chest to meet his gaze.Gabes eyes shifted away, and she lifted her hand to touch his cheek.Stop it.He heaved a huge sigh and said, Were not talking about me right now.The gentle reminder made her wonder if he thought she was trying to avoid talking about Kyle.Hes probably right, but once you tell him, you cant take it back.Its ...hard to talk about.Before a few weeks ago, Id only ever told one person, and that didnt go quite how I expected, Caroline said, sliding her hand back down until it lay on his chest.I just dont want you to look at me differently.Gabe shook his head and rolled to his side, kissing her gently.Crazy girl, I think you are one hell of a woman to have overcome the cards you got dealt.A lot of people would have made worse mistakes to deal with their pain.Gabes words warmed her, and she kissed him again, just a short press of her lips, but it meant so much for him to try to put her at ease.Thank you.He pulled her close again and kissed her hair.What happened after your mom died?You can do this.Youve come this far.Well, I was a wreck for months, and then my father started asking me to attend political functions with him.Political?Gabe asked.She tilted her head back and said, My father was the mayor of Rock Canyon before he started aiming for higher offices in the state.Look at that.You really are a princess, he said teasingly.She slapped his abs, and he groaned.Be nice.Im always nice, he said, threading his fingers through hers.But actually, I already knew that about you.You did?she asked, surprised.How?Hanging with Chase and Eric.I asked why Eric called you Trouble, Gabe said.Oh, really?You didnt beat it out of him?Caroline said, feeling like her emotions were all over the place.One minute she was crying and the next she was smiling.I didnt have to.Gabe traced his thumb across her palm.But I did warn him if he kissed you again, I was going to beat the shit out of him.Caroline choked.You did not tell Eric Henderson you were going to beat the shit out of him.No, but just so you know, if he does kiss you, hes dead meat.Okay, first of all, you dont own me or my lips, buster, she said, pushing away from his chest, and second, dead meat?Really?Gabe tried to kiss her but only got cheek when she turned her head.His warm breath grazed her ear as he whispered, Hey, I know I dont own you, but that doesnt mean I want you kissing anyone but me.Carolines heart skipped and then beat out a hearty tempo.So, were kissing exclusively?Well, if Jessica Alba shows up ...Caroline squeezed his hand hard, and he kissed her cheek.Yeah, were exclusive.Silence stretched between them, and her mind raced at the implications.Was he freaking out, putting everything out there and admitting they werent going to be seeing anyone but each other?She could admit; it was freaking her out.But just a smidge, really.We keep getting off topic, Gabe said.What?Oh ...On top of the intimacy associated with exclusivity, he wanted to hear about the most painful parts of her past.This is what people do in relationships.They share things.But things were getting heavy, fast.And now she wasnt sure ...Look, theres no pressure.You dont have to tell me.No, Caroline said abruptly.Sorry, Im just ...Im ready, okay?Just give me a minute.Gabe lay there quietly while Caroline collected herself and finally continued.There was this senator my dad was good friends with, and we spent a lot of time with his family.He had a son a year or so older than me, and when he started paying attention to me, I didnt mind.I was flattered, she said softly, ashamed that she had been so taken in by Kyles deadly charm.So about six months after my moms death, I go to this dinner party with my dad.They were usually pretty boring, and I never liked most of the girls who attended, but Kyle took me to a private game room.Closing her eyes, she held Gabes hand tighter as she spoke.I wasnt supposed to leave the party, but it felt good to be a little bad, you know?I was excited, because out of everyone, hed picked me to hang out with.He brought down this cherry flavored punch that was a little syrupy, but I didnt want to complain.Honestly, though, whenever I smell or taste that artificial cherry flavoring now, I get sick.Gabe didnt say anything; the only move he made was to kiss the top of her head, which was good.Any more interruptions, and she mightve lost her nerve.After a while, though, I just started feeling out of it, and when I tried to get to my room, Kyle took me the rest of the way, she said, choking on the words as she finished.I kept drifting in and out of it, but I remember him on top of me, laughing when I begged him to stop.I should have killed the son of a bitch, Gabe growled.As much as I would have loved to see that, it wouldnt have helped, and you would have gone to prison.Still, the fucker needs to pay, he said, and the quiet that followed was lengthy.Caroline had a feeling he was wondering why shed never done something about Kyle.You want to know why I never told anyone.Gabe said nothing, and it was answer enough.Sighing, she sat up with her back to him, pulling her knees into her chest.Fear, mostly.I was scared as hell of what Kyle might do to me or my sisters.He threatened to ...God, even saying the words out loud were terrifying.The night after it happened, he threatened to do the same thing to my sisters.That if I pressed charges, hed get out on bail, and they wouldnt be as lucky as me, because hed make sure they were awake for everything.How old were your sisters?Gabe asked, his voice guttural.Val was thirteen, Caroline said, wiping at her watery eyes.Ellie was only six, though.Jesus, Caroline, the man is sick as fuck, Gabe said, and she felt the bed shift as he sat up.Yeah, I know, but it wasnt just Kyles threats that kept me quiet.I was selfishly afraid that no one would believe me, that my father wouldnt believe me.I mean, I told my best friend and she didnt seem to believe me.Listen, no matter what anyone said to you, what that bastard did was not your fault, Gabe said, his hand on her shoulder.You have to believe that.You dont think I told myself that, over and over?I just felt like I couldnt take the chance.I couldnt let Kyle take everything from me, she said, laying her cheek on her kneecap.But it turns out I did that to myself anyway by letting my emotions eat at me.She felt Gabe move before his lips pressed against her bare shoulder.We all do it.I did it to my best friend, Chase.He had this full ride academic scholarship to Berkeley, and I was so jealous, I couldnt even see straight.He was going to get out of town, and I was staying behind.Id tried not to let it affect me, but when I caught him kissing my sister, suddenly it wasnt just me he was deserting, he said, wrapping his arms around her.We all do stupid shit as kidshell, even as adults.The key is whether or not you can forgive yourself and move on.Turning to face him, she asked, Have you forgiven yourself yet?Gabes expression clouded, and she almost took it back, until he said, Im working on it.Caroline snuggled into him and whispered, I dont know how to move on from this.I think you already took the first step by talking about it, he said, trailing kisses across her skin.The rest will just take time.Is that what helped you?Time?she asked, enjoying his ministrations.That, he said, dipping his head to kiss along her jaw, and I realized there was something I wanted, but because of self loathing, I didnt feel like I deserved it.Your shop, she said as her hands smoothed up his arms and over his shoulders.No, he whispered just below her ear.You.Caroline jerked in surprise at his words, unsure how to take them.Relax.I just mean that Ive never risked getting close to a woman because I didnt think I deserved to be happy, he said, his hand skimming down her arm.But with you, I think maybe my karma is starting to turn for the better.Laughing nervously, she said, I dont think anyone has ever considered me a karmic gift before.Just think of what youd be called if you could actually cook, he said, kissing her before she could respond.But it was a futile effort.The minute he broke the kiss, she muttered, Youre gonna pay for that.As he pulled her down, he said, Bring it on.THE NEXT MORNING, Gabe was up early and at the firehouse, fighting a brick wall.Despite Carolines help moving the tables around, hed gotten in the rest of his equipment and now needed to set that up before he officially opened for business.Not to mention all the cleaning he had to do.The place had been sitting so long, there were bionic cobwebs in every window and dust bunnies the size of wolverines.He hadnt realized exactly how big the place was until hed started getting rid of the junk that had been left behind.Plus, there were several posters of bikes hed designed that werent going to hang themselves, and hed had a feeling brick walls were gonna be a bitch to mess with.Hed been right.Why had he left the comfort of Carolines arms for this?Gabe?Chases voice called from the front of the firehouse.Yeah, hold on, Gabe said, gritting his teeth as he tried to get the stick and hang hooks to work on the brick.Damn it.Um, hey, man, I brought some help.Gabe looked up and saw Chase standing in the doorway with a group of guys behind him.Justin Silverton, Travis Bowers, Eric Henderson, Mike Stevens, and a couple others Gabe had seen but didnt know stood holding on to a couple of ice chests, grinning.Gabe climbed down awkwardly and said, Hey, thanks for coming guys, but Youre feeling so overwhelmed with gratitude, you dont know what to say?Eric asked.No, I was just going to say that you dont have to help me out with this, Gabe said.We know that, but Chase said you were giving a discount to anyone who helped you set up shop, Mike said, grinning.Gabe glared at Chase, who shook his head.He came up with that on his own.I said it was a party, and they had to bring their own beer.Look, I left my baby crazy wife to come help you out, but if you arent going to use me, then I got somewhere to be, Travis said.Dude, youre oversharing again, Mike said, grimacing.I dont mind hearing more about Bowerss wife.Shes hot Finish that sentence, and Ill use this saw on you, Travis said to one of the younger guys, nodding toward the steel blade in the corner.Gabe looked around at the group of guys he hardly knew and was at a loss.Chase came up alongside him and patted his shoulder.Just give us something to do, Gabe.Were here for you.As Gabe started handing out assignments, he was surprised by how fast the time flew.It had been a while since hed worked with a bunch of guys, but that had been in a mechanics shop, where he was just another grunt.Here, he was the boss, and the rush of pride he felt when they finished the setup was overwhelming.Thank you, guys, Gabe said, holding out his hand to each of them.You fucking rock.Nice, Mike said, rubbing his hands together.Now about my discount ...What the hell, right?They had sweated their asses off for him.Discounts all around, gentleman, Gabe said, grabbing an order pad and tossing Chase his sketch book.Moriartys Custom Bikes is open for business.CAROLINE WALKED INTO Hanks Bar and shook her head at the waste.If Hank had been serious about increasing business and actually running a business, she wouldnt feel like she was about to step on someone elses dream.But she couldnt put in her time and effort when the owner was just going to run the place into the ground anyway.Waiting, as the bartender ran to grab Hank, Caroline studied a few of the pictures behind the bar.
