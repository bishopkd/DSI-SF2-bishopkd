This reminded me of the fallout with my cousin.Then there was her savior, a mysterious man named Garret who rescued her from various predicaments.I wondered why I was so attracted to Jordan.At first, I was mesmerized by his beauty and eyes that spoke of eternity.Then there was his miraculous ability to be available whenever I was lonely.There were intimate moments and even more intimate visions, with that undeniable connection I had with him.Finally there was last night, where I had experienced romantic love for the first time, in all its brilliant glory and exhilaration.But were Jordan and my feelings for him genuine?Or were they just as imaginary as this work of fiction that lay beside me?I checked the clock on the desk and saw it was already 7:30 a. m.  Ironically, I wasn't even sleepy.I wouldn't borrow Nathaniel's car, so this meant a long walk down the hill into town.I first showered and changed my clothes before commencing on my journey.After ten minutes or so, a car stopped and someone gestured at me through the window.I couldn't make out who it was, so I approached the vehicle and they rolled their window down."Adriana, how the hell are you?"A man poked his head out.I shouldn't have been surprised that anyone who thought they recognized me would actually be looking for my sister.She was the one that spent her last ten years here, not me.What surprised me though, was how uninformed this elderly gentleman was to not have known about my sister's passing."Are you going into town?"he asked.I nodded my head and decided to keep quiet about my sister.He opened the door for me and accelerated the vehicle down the road."So which way are you headed today?"He turned to look at me."I wanted to stop by the Maryvale Congregational Church. "His face looked surprised at this and then he laughed."I think you already missed the service.It began thirty minutes ago. ""No problem, I wanted to look up an old friend in the churchyard. "I regretted saying this after I witnessed the effect it had on him.I could not have piqued his curiosity more."Well, I know most of the relics buried there.Who is it you're looking for?"I wondered if I should mention his name.There might be a chance he would recognize it, as long as it wasn't too current like my sister."His name is Jordan.Jordan Harmon. "The old man stroked the stubble on his chin thoughtfully."No, I don't recollect of anyone by the name of Harmon buried there.I did know a Charles Harmon; he was a good customer that frequented my store.Hes about my age, though Im fairly certain hes not dead. "I contemplated this new information and wondered if Charles Harmon could be Jordan's father or grandfather."Do you still keep in contact with him?"I queried.He shook his head dolefully."No, we lost touch after my business folded.That was nearly two decades ago.I try to keep up with the obituaries to see whose still among us.And Ive never came across his name yet. "I didn't want to give up on this possible lead so I continued to question him."Did Charles have any children that you know of?"He stopped for a red light and was gazed out the window in recollection."Let me see.I do remember one son coming into my store but I don't remember his name. "I pondered this a moment and made a decision to press on."Could you describe what he looked like?""That was so long ago, Adriana.The boy was about ten years old, I believe.And if memory serves me correct, he had the same unruly black hair and striking blue eyes of his father.Bingo and bulls eye, I thought.Of course wavy black hair and striking blue eyes were not uncommon, but Jordan was about my age.Two decades ago, I would have been seven.When I was on the shore building sandcastles with my cousin, Jordan could have been living somewhere close by in the same town.I tried to think of any outstanding traits that would identify him further, but I realized it was a long time ago, and was satisfied to have this piece of the puzzle.The old man pulled the car up beside the church on Ellstrom Lane and got out to open the door for me."I appreciate the lift" I thanked him."Anything for you, Adriana. "he winked.The Congregational Church was a historic landmark.An ancient stone building with a churchyard that tourist often photographed.The tombstones and crypt were surrounded by a low cobblestone fence.I opened the small gate and surveyed the grounds.Most of the graves were old, there weren't many recent markers.I wended my way up and down the different rows of the dead, reading the names on the headstones.Some of the last names were the same, so apparently they were descendants of the next generation.As I grew nearer to the church itself, I could hear the service in progress.I stepped quietly around the graves without finding success.There was no one named Harmon that I could find.As I neared the far side of the churchyard, I noticed a caretaker's cottage.Perhaps there might be someone there who had an inventory of all the names that were put to rest.The door to the cottage was partly open, so I stuck my head in and looked around."Can I help you?"A voice behind me inquired.A stout middle aged man with glasses, stood behind me outside the cottage."Hi there, I was trying to locate a particular grave.Could you help me?"The man cleared his throat and motioned for me to follow him inside."Have a seat, and I'll be right with you. "He disappeared behind a partition and then appeared again with a large book.I figured that would be the roster with all the names."Who were you trying to locate, my dear?""I was looking for Jordan Harmon. "The man became flustered and nearly dropped his book.Instead, he set the book on a table and came over and sat beside me."I'm afraid he's not buried just yet. "I didn't understand what he meant."Not buried yet?"I echoed.The man shook his head."No, not yet    You see, his funeral is tomorrow. "Then looking over the top of his spectacles he said, "Are you alright, Miss?"The blood had completely drained from my face, and I must have appeared as one of the dead myself."I'm sorry, what did you say again?""The funeral is being held on Monday morning.Theres a small service for his family and friends.Did you know Mr.Harmon?"I vacantly inclined my head."Could you tell me when he died?"I inquired."It was just last week.Didn't you read the newspaper?""No, I don't read the obituaries. "I mumbled.He shook his head."No, it wasn't in the obituary column; it was on the front page. ""Oh...Could you tell me what time the service is tomorrow?"He thought for a moment."There's a viewing tomorrow morning at 11:30, followed by the burial. "My mind had gone completely blank."Thank you," I said getting up, and with a small wave of my hand, I left the cottage.The man said that Jordan had died a week ago.Was it possible that someone was masquerading as him on the beach?Well, there was one way to find out.The local library would have a copy of last weeks newspaper.There should be a photo with the story there.I crossed the avenue and made my way towards Main Street.When I got to the library I saw that it was closed.Of course, it was Sunday; I would need to come back tomorrow.I walked in a daze down the street to hail a cab.I needed to get home and crawl into bed.My lack of sleep had finally caught up with me, and I could barely keep my eyes open.By the time I reached Hathaway Hall, it was already early afternoon.I fell asleep the moment I made contact with my pillow.I began to dream about a garden for the dead.There was an open meadow where the long lost departed came back to remember.I needed to find Adriana and protect her from Sebastian.When I arrived at the garden, I saw the dead moving about like sleepwalkers among the flowers.I kept searching their faces for my sister, and then I saw Jordan.His sapphire eyes met mine and they seemed aware that I knew he was dead.His hand reached out for me."Come with me, Laura" he beckoned.Despite some trepidation, I clasped his hand and followed him.We moved past the garden into a realm surrounded by mist and fog.There was what appeared to be a light in the distance.
