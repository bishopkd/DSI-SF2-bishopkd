He started the car and as he waited for the engine to warm up, he stared at the house and thought of the woman inside.Shed been unusually quiet, and he knew shed been hurt by his words at breakfast that first morning.But hed needed to ground her in reality.Shed looked at him as if he were the man he wished to be instead of the man he feared he was, and that had scared him.Theyd spent the three days playing cards and Monopoly to pass the time.She was good at poker, but lacked the killer instinct to win at the board game.Shed teased him about closing cabinet doors and meticulously arranging things in an orderly fashion, and he hadnt taken offense.In truth, he found the teasing charming.They were no closer to finding out who might be after her, but more memories had resurfaced.Shed remembered a high school dance and a trip to the Kansas City Zoo.Shed also remembered her fathers funeral and then burying her mother two years later.They were bits and pieces of a life returning in brief glimpses that had yet to reveal the information they most neededher name.Still, he knew now that it was probably just a matter of days before her memory completely returned and then shed be out of his life for good.What he didnt understand was why the idea of never seeing her again bothered him more than a little bit.Each evening as theyd sat in the living room watching television, his attention had been focused on her.He loved the way she lifted her hair off her neck when she got too warm, how she unconsciously rubbed her tummy as if caressing the baby inside her.The sound of her laughter filled him with a particular kind of joy hed never felt before, and the worry that flirted darkly in her amazing eyes made him want to move heaven and earth to take it away.He put the car into gear and pulled away from the house.Definitely time for some distance.How on earth had she managed to get so deep inside him in such a short space of time?Unlike his sister, hed never had a particularly soft spot for strays or the vulnerable, and yet something about Jane touched him in a way nobody ever had.He tightened his hands around the steering wheel.He needed to get a grip.He glanced over to the small brown bag on the passenger seat.Inside was a drinking glass that Jane had used the night before.Hed sneaked the glass into the bag and brought it out to the car last night after shed gone to bed.He had a friend at the crime lab who could print it and run her through the AFIS.If she had a criminal record or had ever been fingerprinted for anything, the Automated Fingerprint Identification System would find her.Hed considered doing this before, but had dismissed the idea, hoping the situation would resolve itself.He hadnt told her what he was going to do, knew that it would only add additional stress to an already stressful situation.There was no question that he was intrigued by her adamant refusal to go to the police.At least by checking her fingerprints, within the next twenty four to forty eight hours hed know if she had a record.And if she did, then theyd know her name.Before dropping the glass off with his buddy, before checking in with his partners, he wanted to see Loretta.By the time he pulled into the apartment complex, the gray sky had begun to spit snow.Today was Lorettas day off, and despite the fact that it was nearly ten oclock when he knocked on her door, she greeted him still clad in her pajamas and with a coffee mug in hand.She ushered him into the kitchen, where he poured himself a cup and sat at the table across from her.I heard the weatherman mention snow today and decided it was a good day to stay in my pajamas, she said.Hows it going?How is Jane?Okay.Shes started getting some memories back, although nothing about who she is or what happened to her.Shes remembered fairly inconsequential things.But thats a good sign, Loretta exclaimed.Thats what I told her.Thats what I keep telling myself, that its just a matter of time before she remembers everything.I kind of miss having her around.Loretta took a sip of her coffee and then continued.She was good company.She has a great sense of humor.I like her.Yeah, well, it wont be long before shes back where she belongs.Maybe she shouldnt go back where she belongs, Loretta said.I mean, she ran away for a reason.Lucas frowned with a touch of irritation.He didnt want to think about that.He had to hang on to the idea that someplace out there Jane had a safe place to go and people who cared about her.Im just ready for this all to be over.I need to get back to my life.Loretta crooked one of her dark eyebrows upward and smiled ruefully.What life?Ha, ha, very funny, Lucas replied drily.Im not trying to be funny.You have my life and you have your partners lives, but you dont have much of one of your own.Its a little early in the morning for a Dr.Phil moment, he replied.Have you seen anyone suspicious lurking around the apartment building over the past couple of days?No, and I wasnt finished talking about you, she replied.Seriously, Lucas, at least it was nice to see you interacting with Jane.You like her.I know you do.I could tell by the way you looked at her.I know she probably has a life to get back to, but its all made me think about how much I wish youd find some nice woman to be a part of your life.I dont need anyone in my life, he replied.Besides, youre one to talk.When was the last time you had a date?Actually, I have one this Friday night.She smiled smugly.Lucas leaned back in his chair and narrowed his eyes.With who?Hes a really nice guy who works as a lab tech at the hospital.Weve been spending our breaks together for the last month or so, and he finally asked me out.Whats his name?Lucas asked.She shook her head.Oh no, you dont.You are not going to check him out through whatever nefarious means you might have.Ill tell you his name on the day of the wedding.Lucas stared at her in stunned surprise.Its that serious?She laughed.Not yet.But I am serious about you staying out of it.She leaned forward and covered one of his hands with her own.I love you, Lucas, but you have to give me a little breathing room to find my own way when it comes to romance.He knew she was right.Just be careful.Make sure you go someplace where there are other people.He bit his tongue before a full blown lecture could escape.And have a good time.She smiled gratefully.Thank you.I plan on it.Ive got to get out of here, he said with a check of his watch.Ive got some errands to run before I get back to Jane.He stood, drained his coffee cup and carried it to the sink.Call me Friday night when you get home, okay?It might be late.She got up from the table to walk him to the door.Thats all right.Ill sleep better knowing youre home safe and sound.She walked with him to the front door.Youll let me know what happens with Jane?As soon as I know anything, he replied.Good.Id like to keep in contact with her.Shes a terrific woman, memory or no memory.Minutes later as Lucas drove to the lab, he felt a new depression settle across his shoulders.His partners were both building new lives with women that they loved, and it was obvious Loretta was excited about her date on Friday night.Things were changing.Everyone seemed to be moving on with their lives while Lucas was being left behind.He shoved the ridiculous thought from his mind as he pulled into the parking lot of a small caf across from the Kansas City Crime Lab.The lab itself was housed in a low, long brick building, but hed arranged to meet his friend at the Cornerstone Caf, which was usually filled with people from the lab grabbing a bite to eat.He spied Justin James seated at a booth in the back the minute he walked through the door.Loretta described Justin as the hottest science nerd on the face of the planet.Lucas didnt know about hot, but he knew the man ate, slept and breathed forensic science.Justin raised a hand as he saw Lucas approach.With his other hand he picked up a cinnamon roll the size of New Jersey and took a bite.Sugar and science, Lucas said as he slid into the booth opposite the blond haired man.Its nice to see some things never change.Justin shrugged.As far as Im concerned, change is vastly overrated.Now, to what do I owe the honor of this meeting?Lucas set the paper bag on the table.This is a drinking glass.You should be able to lift a decent set of prints from it.Id like you to run it through the AFIS and see if anything pops up.And whats in it for me?Justin raised one of his blond eyebrows.Two dozen glazed from the bakery of your choice, Lucas replied.Done.It will take about twenty four hours.Ill call you with any results.I appreciate it, Lucas said.Gonna tell me what this is all about?Nope.Lucas signaled the waitress for a cup of coffee.And Id prefer this to stay between you and me.I figured that without you saying, Justin said.Hows work at the lab?The one thing good about working in a crime lab is I never worry about job security.As long as there are bad people in the world, my job is relatively safe.The two men visited briefly about work, sports and the weather; then Justin stood to get back to work and Lucas left, as well.He checked in with Troy and Micah at the office, then decided to head back to the safe house and Jane.The snow was coming down in earnest and he turned on his wiper blades against the fat, wet flakes that obscured his vision and began to cover the street and grass.Hed only gotten a block or so from the office building when he noticed a dark sedan two car lengths behind him.He turned down a residential street and watched his mirror.The sedan followed, and just behind it another black sports car.Lucas turned again and watched as the sedan fell back and the sports car got behind him, tag teaming him in an attempt to hide the fact that they were following him.A surge of adrenaline filled him as he increased his speed and fishtailed around another corner to make sure that his assessment of the situation was correct.The two cars followed.He stomped on the brakes and stared into the rearview mirror at the front license of the car that nearly rear ended him.JMV 237.JMV 237.JMV 237.He repeated it several times until he was sure he had it memorized; then he stepped on the gas and tightened his grip on the wheel as he set about losing the tails.They were good.But he was better.He rocked through the streets like a NASCAR driver, taking turns too fast for the road conditions and breaking the speed limits in his effort to evade them.It took thirty minutes to finally ditch them.Still he drove aimlessly for another thirty minutes, constantly checking his mirror to make sure hed lost them for good.When he was confident that he wasnt being followed any longer, he headed to the house and Jane as he wondered again who the hell she was and why people were after her.HER BACK HAD BOTHERED HER throughout the day.Jane was seated on the sofa with a pillow from the bedroom behind her for support when Lucas came inside.Instantly she could tell that something had happened.She straightened.I didnt hear you pull up out front, she said.I didnt.I pulled around to the back and parked in the garage.He sat on the chair across from her, energy rolling off him in waves.Ive got Troy and Micah dropping off a rental car later this evening.What happened?As he told her about being followed from the Recovery Inc.office, a new frustration coupled with a familiar fear edged through her.Who are these people and what do they want with me?she cried in desperation.I dont know, but Im hoping well have the name of one of them before the night is over.I got a license number of one of the cars that was following me and I put in a call to Wendall Kincaid.The chief of police?she asked.As always, the idea of the police knowing anything about her made a nervous flutter in her stomach.Dont worry.I told him the driver of the car rear ended me and I need his name to file an accident report.Lucas raked a hand through his hair and leaned back in the chair.He looked exhausted, and a wave of guilt swept through Jane.Maybe we should go to the police, she said, and heard the slight tremor in her voice.This is getting so complicated and Im sure youre sick to death of me.He smiled, but she could tell it was slightly forced.Im not sick of you.I am sick of not knowing whats going on.I could maybe understand some crazy nut being after youa stalker boyfriend or husbandbut this isnt just a single individual.Its a whole group of people.Maybe I really am a spy, she said.Thats one of the things Loretta and I came up with.Of course we also thought I might be an undercover rock star or a high class madame.A whisper of a smile curved his lips and she saw him starting to relax.I guess its better to be a high class madame than a low class one.She leaned back against the pillow once again.I have discovered one important fact about myself today.Whats that?I dont like soap operas.When you feel like youre living one, the last thing you want to do is watch one.Your back still hurting?he asked as she adjusted her position against the pillow.She nodded.Its just a dull ache.I think carrying around this baby weight is pulling on my spine.But its fine.Im fine.I made a pot of stew for dinner, but its still simmering and wont be ready for another hour or so.Thats all right.Im not hungry.If you dont mind, Im going back to the bedroom to make some phone calls.Im expecting a fax soon and the machine is back there.He got up from the chair and she watched him disappear down the hallway.As always when he left, he seemed to take some of the energy from the room, from her.She rubbed her stomach as she thought of the new events that had taken place.The license plate number hed managed to get was the first real clue theyd had that might yield answers, and she was surprised to realize she was conflicted about it.On the one hand she wanted her life back, whatever that life might be.She hated the idea that she was taking advantage of Lucas and keeping him from his own life, but on the other hand she didnt want to tell him goodbye.Was she reluctant to let go of him because she had nothing else to hang on to?Perhaps if she were completely truthful with herself shed accept that that was part of it.But what was more difficult to accept was the fact that she didnt want to leave him because she was falling in love with him.It was crazy.It was positively insane.She was carrying somebodys baby.She didnt even know her own name, but she knew what was in her heart and if felt like love.She didnt believe that Lucas felt as if he was stuck with her, as hed said at breakfast the first morning in the house.She wasnt sure what he felt about her.But if that kiss theyd shared and the odd moments when she felt his gaze lingering on her were any indication, he definitely felt something toward her that wasnt just a reluctant responsibility.Twice she got up from the sofa and went into the kitchen to stir the stew, then stood at the window and watched the snow.It had finally tapered off to flurries, leaving behind less than an inch on the ground.Shed returned to the living room and was back on the sofa some time later when Lucas came back into the living room and handed her a sheet of paper with a drivers license copied on it.Recognize him?he asked as he sat next to her on the sofa.She took the sheet of paper from him and stared at it.Charles Blankenship.He was fifty eight years old, weighed two hundred pounds and was five feet eleven.He had a severe, square jaw and brown eyes, his salt and pepper hair was cut military short and he wasnt smiling for the camera.She frowned thoughtfully.He looks vaguely familiar, but I dont know from where.She handed him back the sheet of paper.Who is he?One of the cars that followed me was registered to him.I think first thing in the morning Im going to pay Mr.Charlie Blankenship a visit.I want to come with you.Im not sure thats a good idea, he replied with a frown.Its the only idea weve got, she protested.His picture looks familiar.Maybe seeing him in person will finally jiggle my memory.Besides, Im not worried about my safety as long as Im with you.Its my life, Lucas.Please let me be a part of things.He stared at her for a long moment, and in the depths of his dark brown eyes she saw the same emotion that shed seen moments before hed kissed her.It was a yearning that made her breath catch in her throat and dried her mouth with sweet anticipation.He leaned forward, as if drawn to her by an invisible thread, and she parted her lips, wanting him to kiss her again, needing to feel his warm, soft mouth against hers.Abruptly he stood.You think that stew is ready now?His voice was deeper than usual.She released her breath and nodded.The moment was broken, but it gave her a crazy new hope, the hope that somehow when this was all finished they might be together.They had just finished eating when Troy and Micah arrived with the rental car.Jane made a pot of coffee as the three men sat at the table and Lucas caught them up on his chase that afternoon.He showed them the faxed copy of Charles Blankenships drivers license, but neither of them had any idea who the man was or why hed be following Lucas.It has to be Jane, Lucas said.Theyre looking for her.She turned around from the sink as she felt the weight of three pairs of eyes on her.I wish I could explain it.I wish I knew what was going on.Our plan is to talk to Charles Blankenship in the morning and ask him why he was following me, Lucas said as Jane joined them at the table.Micah looked at her.And you still dont want to go to the cops?She hesitated before replying.No, she didnt want to go to the police, but she also knew if thats what Lucas wanted her to do, then thats what she would do.Not yet, Lucas replied for her.She smiled at him gratefully.At least he wasnt so sick of her that he was willing to throw her to the dogs.Not yet.For whatever reason, Jane feels as if shed be putting herself at risk by going to the cops and were hoping before that becomes our only option her memory will return.Micah nodded and tapped the picture of Charles Blankenship with the tip of a finger.Want me to see what I can dig up on this guy before morning?That would be great, Lucas replied.Youre better than anyone I know at digging up facts about people.Micah grinned at the compliment, then looked at Troy.Wed better get out of here so I can get to work.The four of them rose from the table and walked to the front door.Micah, Troy, thank you for all your help, Jane said.Im sure Lucas knows how lucky he is to have friends like you that he can depend on.A niggling depression weighed her down as she told the men goodbye and went back to sit on the sofa as Lucas walked out with them.Shed been missing almost six days and still nobody seemed to be looking for her.Why wasnt somebody worried about her?Why didnt anyone care that she was missing?Was she so unimportant in this life that she could disappear for daysfor a weekforever and nobody cared?Pregnesia Chapter EightThe house was quiet.Jane had gone to bed an hour earlier and Lucas sat at the kitchen table, worrying about everything hed learned during the course of the evening.Justin had called to tell him that there had been no hit on Janes fingerprints, so that had been a bust.And Lucas had almost kissed her again.He frowned and stared out the window.Hed wanted to kiss her again so badly it had ached in his chest and burned in his blood.Thank God he hadnt followed through on the impulse.Nothing good could come from him kissing her again.Still, even now the scent of her remained in his head, the citrus clean fragrance of her shampoo coupled with a faint, floral, feminine scent that drove him half mad.He hadnt just wanted to kiss her, hed wanted to touch her skin, rub her belly and feel the kick of her son against his palm.The son she said she was going to name after him.If he looked deep within himself, he had to recognize that hed been touched by her words, and yet horrified at the same time.He didnt want a kid named after him and he definitely didnt want a woman looking at him with such trust, with something that looked like love.His cell phone vibrated in his shirt pocket and he pulled it out, grateful for the disruption of his thoughts.Ready for a little bit of information?Micah asked.Whatever youve got.Lucas leaned back in his chair.Charles Blankenship is an insurance salesman.No criminal record, nothing to indicate hes anything but a good, upstanding citizen.Hes married and has two grown children, one grandchild.No financial issues, the usual credit card debt and a car loan, but nothing out of the ordinary.Lucas bit back a sigh of frustration.I was hoping for something different, something that might explain his interest in Jane.The only thing I discovered that I think youll find interesting is that hes on the board of directors of the Church of Enlightenment.A bolt of adrenaline flashed through Lucas, sitting him up straighter in his chair.What?The board consists of eight men and two women.Charles is one of them.I dont know what it means, Lucas, but Im going to do a little more digging into this church.Yeah, thanks.Id appreciate it, Lucas replied thoughtfully.I dont get it, Micah.Why would a church want Jane?I dont know, buddy.We cant be sure it has anything to do with the church.The worst thing you can do is jump to conclusions without solid evidence.Right now, the fact that this Charles was chasing you and that Jane has an aversion to his churchs logo could be nothing more than coincidence.And you really believe that?Lucas asked drily.Not for one minute, Micah replied.Lucas could hear the grin in his buddys voice.Long after the two men hung up, Lucas remained at the table, trying to fit together pieces of the puzzle of Jane.Was it just a coincidence that the logo the church used inspired an irrational fear in Jane and that the man who had been tailing Lucas was a member of the board of that church?Why would a church be after Jane?It was the question that kept niggling at his brain.None of it made sense.Maybe Charles would be forthcoming in the morning when Lucas had a little visit with him.Yeah, right, and maybe tomorrow it would be warm enough to swim.He got up from the table and checked the back door to make sure it was securely locked, then turned out the lights and walked through the dark living room.He checked the front door and headed down the hallway, but hed only taken a couple of steps when he heard the sound of crying coming from Janes room.Just walk on by, he told himself.She had plenty of reasons to be sad at the moment, but there was nothing he could do to solve her problems, nothing he could say to ease her fears.Just walk on by.Steeling himself, he passed her bedroom.The door was just barely cracked open and the soft sound of her weeping seemed to thunder in his head.It sounded so achingly pitiful.He got as far as his bedroom door, then stopped.There was no way he could just go to bed with the sound of her crying in his head.With a reluctant sigh he turned back around, knowing it was foolish, but unable to stop.He paused just outside her door and then knocked softly.Jane?Are you all right?He pushed the door open far enough that he could peek into the room, but the room was too dark for him to see her.No.Im not all right.He heard the rustle of the sheets; then the bedside lamp turned on and there she was, clad in a pale pink nightgown with her hair all tousled around her head and her eyes shiny with tears.She sat up and the sheet fell to her waist, exposing her delicate collarbones above the neckline and the thrust of her breasts against the thin material.He remained in the doorway, afraid to breathe, afraid to move.She looked so achingly lovely despite her tears.Whats wrong?he asked, then grimaced.Stupid question, right?She gave him a watery smile, but it held for only a moment before tears began to trek down her cheeks once again.Im being a baby, she said.Ive just been lying here wondering why nobody misses me, why I havent been reported missing.People are after me and I dont know why and my back hurts so much and I dont have anyone to rub it for me.Im going to have this baby all alone and I might never know who I am.He tried to maintain a barrier around his heart.He didnt want to feel her pain, didnt want to get pulled into her despair, but it was impossible not to.Before he realized what he was doing he found himself standing next to the bed where the sweet scent of her eddied in the air.I cant tell you why nobody has missed you, Jane.I cant tell you why you have people after you.But you wont have that baby alone.Ill make sure of that.Someplace in the back of his mind he knew he was making a promise he didnt intend to keep, but at the moment all he wanted to do was stop her tears, bring that beautiful smile back to her face.And if you need somebody to rub your back, then all you need to do is ask, he heard himself saying.Her lips trembled slightly as she looked up at him.Would you?Just for a minute or two?Id appreciate it so much.She scooted over and turned on her side, her back to him and her long, blond hair a spill of shiny strands against the pillow.He tentatively sat on the side of the bed, his brain screaming that he was making a huge mistake, but his body didnt appear to be listening.She pulled down the sheet, exposing the length of her, the long nightgown the only barrier between them.He could see the curve of her waist, the flare of her hips and her rounded buttocks as his heartbeat sounded in his ears.He reached out and laid his palm against her lower back and she released a sigh of sheer pleasure.
