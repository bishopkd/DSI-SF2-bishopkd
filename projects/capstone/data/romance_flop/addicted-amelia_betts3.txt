You just graduated college.Live a little.Here, have a puff.She held out her little white tube as if it promised emotional maturity in addition to smoke free nicotine.I took the e cig to oblige her.Isabella was obviously proud of herself for adopting this cutting edge vice, and who was I to shatter her illusion of coolness?Nicotine had never really done it for me; when I had dabbled with smoking as a teenager, I had found it supremely less interesting than eating lots of food and determined my money would never have to be wasted on such an expensive trifle.After a quick drag, I handed it back.I dont know.Does he make you feel comfortable?When youre with him?Strangely enough, yes.I mean other than the butterflies.To this, Isabella pretended to face plant on the patio table, hovering her nose inches from its dusty surface.Young lady, have I taught you nothing?What?Isabella groaned as she straightened back up.This is not an opportunity you pass up, my dear.But Im not like you.I smiled, hoping I didnt sound too judgmental.I dont just jump at opportunities.Im too afraid of the consequences.Isabella responded with a bitter laugh.Youll learn.What is that supposed to mean?She shrugged and turned her head, eyeing one of her female neighbors as she passed on a golf cart.Ugh, tell me I dont look that old.* * * That night, I tossed and turned, unable to sleep with Isabellas words still ringing through my head.What did she mean, Youll learn?How was she so convinced that I was letting something important pass me by?Usually I took her life advice with a grain of salt.She came from such a different world than me that most of her axioms (Never wear red lipstick before five oclock, or Flatware sets should be six pieces, not five) did not apply.But her attitude about Liam had been markedly assured.Despite eighty five years of life experience, she wasnt warning me to steer clear of him, even though I had painted him as a potential train wreck.I had even told her the part about the Craigslist prostitute, to which she didnt bat an eye.Not that I had always considered her a mentor per se, but I listened to her input at least as much as I listened to my own mothers, who represented the exact opposite of the spectrum, always encouraging me to protect my heart above all else.Between the two of them, I had probably developed quite the Madonna/whore complex without even knowing it.The problem this time was that I had only confided in Isabella, so she was the only voice in my heador devil on my shoulder, depending on how I looked at it * * * Friday, second week after graduation: Ocean View Baptist Church Overeaters Anonymous Meeting Topic of discussion: Lost Causes Calories imbibed: approximately 1 billion My second week at Juliens had been more of the samebouts of intense work and distraction followed by persistent daydreams of Liam.Actually, for the better part of the week, I had been working by myself in the library, making copious amounts of photocopies at a finicky Xerox machine and tempering the boredom with even more copious amounts of vending machine snacks.By Friday, I was feeling pretty isolated, not to mention bloated, and decided I needed to have at least the illusion of a social life.So after work, I wiped the Snickers smudges from the corner of my mouth and changed my clothes, determined to find the OA meeting Id been looking for the night I had crashed the sex addicts group at Ocean View Baptist.This time, I will get my details right, I promised myself on the way there.The last thing I needed was another dose of sex addict confessionals, not to mention the sight of Liams golden boy face mocking me for denying his sexual prowess.Once I got thereto Chapel B, not Athe meeting itself went by slowly, and I felt myself itching to leave several times.My secret binging had been almost nonstop for the past week, while most of the people in the room were reporting great success with sticking to their meal plans and avoiding trigger foods, accepting a higher power, and taking it one day at a time.I could usually find inspiration in these intrepid twelve steppers, but not tonight.Moving into Juliens was supposed to mark a new start for me, health wise, yet I had bungled it in a matter of days.This particular group, I discovered, liked to end their proceedings with a gratitude share, in which everyone in the room names something for which they are thankful.My opposition to public speakingespecially on bad dayswas such that even this made me anxious, and by the time it was my turn, a couple of tears had already welled up in the corners of my eyes.What is wrong with me?I thought, glancing around nervously and kicking the pew in front of me as, one by one, the women seated in my row named the reasons they were grateful that day (things like serenity, a week without chocolate, or my personal favorite, the ever clich my cat).My eyes searched for the moderator and I raised my hand halfway, wanting to opt out of the gratitude share the way I had opted out of high school gym with a doctors note so I wouldnt have to change in the girls locker room.But when it came time for me to speak, the moderator hadnt seen my hand, and I was too cowardly to dissent.Hi, my name is Mischa, I said in a shaky voice.Hi, Mischa, the sympathetic crowd responded.I guess today Im thankful for I glanced around at the waiting faces, annoyed with myself for not preparing an answer.Do not say pizza.Or ice cream.Especially not ice cream.Each second that passed made me feel like more and more of an ingrate.Which is perhaps why I answered the way I did.My father, I said.Wait, wha?I almost shook my head in time with the words as they came out of my mouth, having no idea what I thought I was talking about.When asked to name one thing I was thankful for, I came up with the derelict parent who had opted out of my life fourteen years ago, the one my mother and I now laughingly referred to as the charismatic cult leader.Was this opposite day?Why couldnt I have thanked my mother, who had toiled and sacrificed and been there for me through thick and thin?For some reason, she was not who my subconscious came up with in the heat of the moment.Instead, I named my father, who had ghosted on me when I was eight years old.Okeydokey, Mischa.I guess youve finally lost it.Regardless of my answer being haphazard and basically wrong, I was met with smiles of encouragement during the gratitude share.A big haired, blue eyed woman named Dawn, who smelled heavily of rose perfume, came up to me after the meeting to thank me for mentioning my dad and lament how much fathers tended to get a bad rap in these meetings.Of course I had no words to respond.I couldnt explain why Id said it or burst her bubble with the truth that my father was a deadbeat just like everyone elses here.As Dawn started talking about her third step and how much difficulty she was having turning her life over to God, the room started to close in on me a little bit.I knew nothing about the Twelve Steps, beyond having them memorized.I had never worked themhad never even considered it, really.Hey, Dawn?I grasped her padded shoulder lightly, not wanting to abandon her but unable to stay in that room for one more second.Im sorry.Ive gotta get to a bathroom.Im about to burst.She nodded sweetly as I gave a perfunctory wave goodbye and snuck out the door, fully aware that I was acting like a coward.Befriending a person like Dawn could have been the best thing for me at a time like this, but I was in no mood for reform.That was the thing about me and OAwe had a complicated relationship.The churchs vast parking lot was the same one where Id first spoken to Liam, and pathetically enough, I had parked in the exact same spot.I had done it subconsciously, out of the desire to run into him again no doubt, while telling myself I was going to avoid him at all costs.In keeping with the latter, I made a direct beeline to my car, eyes on the black asphalt that smelled like it had been freshly paved.I allowed myself only one glance in the direction of Chapel A as I cut through the lot and saw a small group of men gathered on the sidewalk, smoking cigarettes and talking.I noticed the uniform posture they all seemed to have, with their backs arched and butts jutted out in a slightly vulgar way, the exact opposite of the slouched over OAers, who were always trying to make themselves smaller by rounding out their shoulders and drawing their arms in tight.On the first glance, I didnt see Liam, but as I got closer, I looked once more and made out his silhouettehe was wearing the same black jeans as before with a fitted, black leather motorcycle jacket.His back was turned, allowing me to take in his lean, perfect figure.A full body longing to run to him, tell him how much Id thought about him over the past two weeks, overcame me, but I did the opposite and veered away like a coward.When I had almost reached my car, I heard footsteps but shook off the hope that it could be him.I was better off if it wasnt, right?Well, well, well.What have we here?the person belonging to the footsteps called after me, his accent unmistakable.Were you just gonna walk past me and not say anything?My heart pounded wildly at the sound of his voice.I turned to him with a guilty smile that gave me away.Hi.I didnt see you.I was just at a meeting, I said.The right one, this time.Oh yeah?You sure youre not a crazy Baptist?I hear they guard the crucifixion here, like in twenty four hour shifts.I laughed, remembering that on top of being beautiful and successful, he was also naturally funny.Yeah, no.In my four years of living here, I havent found Jesus.Probably never gonna happen.I bit my lip self consciously, trying not to smile, but Liams own smile made it hard.A quick flashback to me running away from his restaurant made me shudder and I shook my head, hoping to physically remove the thought from my brain.What?he asked.Nothing.Umm I searched for something to say, unsuccessfully, as footsteps scuffled up behind me.I turned to find an older man in reading glasses whom Id seen patting Liams shoulder at the meeting the week before.Hey there, he said.Im Bobby.He touched his chest to identify himself, sounding chipper but stern.Hi, Im Mischa.I reached my hand out, but Bobby ignored it.Something told me it wasnt the reading glasses fault.He established himself at Liams side and gripped his shoulder, Bobbys proprietary palm making a subtle squeaking noise against the leather jacket.Im Liams sponsor.How do you two know each other?We dont really, I said, getting the feeling that I was in trouble for some unknown trespass.It was like the high school hall monitor had asked to see my bathroom pass, and the answer was I most certainly didnt have one.Perhaps this was fate stepping infate in the form of a punishing older man with bad style.When Liam didnt immediately come to my defense, I announced that I should be going.It was nice to see you!I said, my eyes on Liam.And nice to meet you, Bobby, I added, my real smile quickly warping into a fake one.Bobby responded with a smirk, then ushered Liam, who looked a little dumbstruck, back to the smokers circle.I turned to my car, my cheeks burning with embarrassment.If there were a wall handy, I would have knocked my head against it.Liams sponsor, that glorified hall monitor of a man, had clocked me from who knows how far away and decided I was some random slut threatening to end his sponsees latest streak of sobriety, and now Liam was probably convinced of the same thing.Nachos and ice cream will fix this, I promised myself as I turned on the car.Nachos and ice cream.Six In the many hours of television Id watched growing up in Eagle Grove, I had been exposed to multiple viewings of a local commercial for the Fort Dodge Fast N Furious Family Fun Center.It was the kind of establishment that had laser tag and go karts and batting cages and arcade games, and also the kind of place that had filmed one commercial back in 1987 and saw fit to use it for the rest of eternity.In said commercial, there was a young boy who flitted from one activity to another, shouting at the top of his lungs, I CANT BELIEVE THIS IS MY LIFE!After the first few times I had seen it, I had been certain that something horrible was bound to befall this boythat nothing was ever that good, and if you cant believe your life, then youre most likely on the precipice of some terrible tragedy.Although I hadnt really thought about it until now, Id been buzzing the last couple of weeks from the promise of Liam, in that I cant believe this is my life!kind of way, when really, I should have suspected that it was too good to be true.Even as a television addicted child, fully steeped in the imaginary worlds of my favorite shows and movies, I had innately known that life is not all go karts and batting cages.The streets were quiet as I drove home from the meeting at the Baptist church.To ensure I would spend the least amount of time possible in the Maxwells kitchen, hoping not to get caught by body snarking Cecile or, worse, Julien, I planned my nacho making in advance, envisioning where all of the ingredients were and in what order I would add them before nuking them in the microwave.The gallon of strawberry ice cream I had shoved behind Juliens frozen peas and berries was already half eaten, so I would be able to finish that without having to return it to the freezer.Sadly, these kinds of thoughts were the nitpicking obsessions that had taken up the better part of my brain for as long as I could remember: what I would eat next, where I would get it, how I would make it, when and how to dispose of the evidence.Only when I was a few blocks from Juliens did I stop building nachos in my mind long enough to notice a speeding car coming up behind me.It followed as I turned onto the dimly lit residential street that I now called home, and when I pulled over and parked by the curb, it stopped directly behind me, headlights flickering in a bright flash before turning off.My heart began to race.I fumbled for my cell phone and swiped at the screen.When the emergency call button illuminated, I let my thumb hover over it.Then, in a matter of seconds, I recognized Liams black leather jacket in my side mirror as he emerged from his car.I gasped.He had somehow broken away from the watchful eye of Bobby, and more unbelievable than that, cared enough to pursue me after our conversation had been quashed.After all the missed opportunities, it felt like an actual miracle to see his reflection coming toward me.Of course a disapproving voice popped into my head, arguing that it was no miracle at all, that he was a sex addict and this is what addicts do, but that was no longer enough to deter me.My desire for him was unstoppable, unlike anything Id ever felt before.I got out of the car to intercept him, not wanting him to glimpse the crumpled fast food bags that littered my passenger seat, and asked incredulously, What are you doing here?even though the answer was obvious.Without a word, Liam kept walking toward me, and I nervously looked down and tugged at my shirt hem, simultaneously scared and excited because I knew this was itthis time I wasnt going to run.The minute he was within arms reach, Liam was backing me against my car, planting his hands on the hood to trap me in.It was like a plane crash, the way it happened all of a sudden, as if our bodies were set to collide and our minds had nothing to do with it.Without warning, I felt his mouth on mine, his tongue moving past my lips.Excited prickles nipped along the surface of my skin as I kissed him back, grabbing at the back of his neck like I was hungry for him.His mouth tasted faintly, deliciously, of whisky, and the day old scruff on his chin tickled my face.He started to lift me up against the car, but I struggled to keep my feet on the ground.Maybe we should go somewhere, I said halfheartedly.But when he backed away, I reached out and drew him in again.Tell me you want me, he said, his pelvis grinding into mine.I could feel his half formed erection against my hip bone, reminding me of the time the sailing instructor had pressed himself against me at the bar.I want you, I said, hardly able to believe that the Liam of my daydreams was now here, in the flesh.I pulled him in for another kiss, relishing the taste of him, our tongues teasing into each others mouths.Finally, I became conscious of the fact that we were right in front of my bosss house.Not here, I said, glancing at Juliens car in the driveway.Liam kissed my neck ravenously, and I responded by planting my hands against his hips to hold him back.Then where?he said.Uh I looked over, surveying the scene at Juliens house.There was a gate around the side that would take us to the guesthouse, but I didnt want to risk being seen or heard.I searched my brain for alternatives while Liam reached his hand inside the waistband of my jean shorts and over my underwear.I wanna fuck you so hard.Wait, fuck?Already?For a split second, I had forgotten the reality of who Liam was.Things were moving fast, but I didnt want him to stop either.You want me, dont you?I got your lacy panties all wet.He spoke at half volume into my ear as he began to move his hand against my sex, lifting my entire body up as he brought his hand forward, then inching me back down.I let myself give in, forgetting where I was.My head dropped back and I gazed at the stars as I felt his hands, cool against my skin.His touch was perfect, like he knew my body through and through.I had dreamed about this, awake, asleep, semiconscious, but the real life version was better than anything I could have imagined.Liam was obviously an expertcapable, determined, in controlbut he was also soft, intuitive, familiar.Not here, I said again, even more halfheartedly.Shhh Liam had found my clitoris and was circling it with his index and middle fingers.He expertly danced around it, hovering above it, only hitting the spot every few strokes.I wanted to make noise, moan with delight, but I was too afraid of anyone overhearing.The only thing I could think to do was bite down on my right hand to muffle the inevitable noises that would escape.This is how it feels when someone knows what they want and how to get it, I thought.He kept the circling up with his right hand while the other found my right nipple through my shirt, plucking at it lightly.I stayed, head tilted back, as Liams hand slipped inside my shirt and bra and grasped at my breasts.I was so focused on his touch, his every move, that I had to remind myself to breathe as one of his fingers navigated the wetness between my legs and pushed inside me.I felt a little spike of pain and drew in a sharp breath.Then there was another finger inside me, his hand still moving back and forth, back and forth.Nothing is ever quite like we expect, but in this moment I felt as if I were watching the movie version of my lifereal and unreal at the same time.Liam and I were in perfect sync.Our bodies moved like one and every time we looked into each others eyes, it was clear how much we both wanted this.Nothing about it felt strange or dangerous, the way it had the other night at the restaurant when I had felt so wary of him.And it wasnt just physical, whatever was happening here.His longing was written across his face, and Im certain he could see mine.I had been thinking about him nonstop, and he had been thinking about me too.We were two lost souls finding a momentary refuge in each other, breathing a sigh of relief as our bodies came together.He kissed up and down my neck and my cheeks, then zeroed in on my mouth again.We parted our lips at the same time, and when our tongues met, I shivered.Added to the sensation of Liams mouth and fingers penetrating me in perfect unison was the warmth of his legs as mine squeezed against them.The thrill of it all made me come faster than I ever had in my life.You feel that?he asked as I gulped a swallow of air and whimpered.Yes.I nodded, my eyes fluttering open.The muscles in your pussy are fucking insane, he said, pulling his fingers out of me as I pulsed and contracted around them, my body not ready to let him go.Can we get in your car now?I asked, a hint of begging in my voice.I had turned a corner.All I could think of now was Liam inside me.I wanted him right away, not to mention later that night, the next morning, and every day for the rest of my lifethe thoughts of an addict.He didnt have to be asked twice.The headlights of his car flashed as he pushed a button on his keychain and we hurried inside.The leather interior smelled new.I found the scent arousing as I smoothed my hands against the seat.Drive around the corner, I instructed.Liam blindly followed orders as I studied him from the side, trying to memorize the chiseled jawline and slightly imperfect nose that looked as though it may have been broken once or twice.In the time that I had noticed his car in my rearview mirror, my infatuation had intensified by a thousand, and I knew I couldnt fight it.I was wired for obsession, and Liam, in this moment, was the perfect object of desire.As he shifted in his seat, I wanted to dive out of mine and plant myself on top of him, recklessly straddle him like some girl in a music video.I had an undeniable need bubbling up inside me to have him right then and there, in my mouth, between my legs, on top of me, behind me, wherever I could get him.Not since freshman year, in my skinny phase, had I felt so sexy and turned on.Despite a nagging awareness that he was light years out of my league, the incongruity of his hotness with my relative frumpiness was almost liberating.No one would have placed us together in a lineup, but whatever it was, it was working.He pulled over on another neighborhood street and parked in a dim spot between the streetlights.Instant panic set in the minute I considered the reality of our surroundingsthat this was where Liam and I were going to have sex.The idea didnt exactly sit well in my prudish brain.Hey, Ive got a better idea, I said, remembering the one secret getaway I had in this town.Do you know where Oceanside Plaza is?Liam looked at me with an eyebrow inadvertently raised as he turned the car off.Thats ten minutes away.I want you now.His green eyes had turned dark, serious.I glanced around, unsure where or how we planned to do it in his tiny car, and heard his seat belt unclick.Silently, Liam got out and walked around to my door, swinging it open wide.Although I was apprehensive about what was coming nextwould we do it in the grass?Against one of the bulky stucco housed mailboxes?I trusted him enough to take his hand and follow him around to the back of the car, where he pinned me against the sloped trunk.I had never had sex in public.Nowhere near itnever even outside of the bedroom.If someone had asked me two hours ago whether Id even be capable of such an act, I would have said absolutely not.But I was operating outside of reason at this point and falsely comforted by the fact that none of this felt quite real.My hands found their way to his belt buckle, but they werent doing the job fast enough.Liam shoved them out of the way and ripped the jeans down his legs.Underneath, he had on black boxer briefs that bulged with a massive hard on.My jaw practically hit the floor at the sight of it.I shouldnt have been surprised, but I was.Unabashed, I stared as he pulled down his boxers to reveal the biggest male organ I had ever encountered, both long and wide but also smooth and perfectly shaped.Of course, I didnt have much to compare it to, given it was only the second one Id ever seen in person, but I sensed that by general standards it must be in the top one percentile.Which was confirmed when he removed a magnum condom from his jacket and tore at the package with his teeth.I imagined myself detailing this to Gracie, trying to think which little tidbits would make it into the retelling.She probably wouldnt believe me no matter how realistic the account.It was around then that I felt my knees start to buckle and my vision blur.Too bad we werent in Victorian England, with smelling salts at the ready.If you miss this, I will kill you!I thought, coaching myself to remain conscious and counting backward from ten.Liam undid my jean shorts and let them drop to the ground, along with my lacy panties that were steeped in my wetness.Sliding his hands back up my sides, he kissed me hard, then grabbed underneath my butt and lifted me against the car.I wrapped my legs around his waist as he rocked his hips to and fro, teasing me with the tip of his erection.The sensation revived me as a new wave of yearning took over.I wanted him so badly I could taste it, but when he finally started to thrust inside me, I tensed up, scared it wouldnt fit.Liam seemed to be thinking the same thing.Are you a virgin?I shook my head no.But this isnt something you do a lot, is it?I shrugged.Why?Because I want to know that you want this.I do.I want it, I said, clenching his shoulders for emphasis.All right.Just tell me if its too much.I dont want to hurt you.You wont, I promised, even though I knew Liam was quite capable of hurting me in more ways than one.Please, I want to feel you.Good, he said, then growled playfully, ramming into me with a force I wasnt prepared for.I yelped in pain but quickly felt the warmth of him spread throughout my body.Stay there a second, I pleaded, reeling from the fullness of his cock piercing through me like a fleshy sword.I groaned as quietly as possible as he began to move in and out, at first slowly and then faster and with more force.Youre so tight.Like a wet little glove, he said, his breathing heavy with effort.I could feel the little hairs on my neck rising and falling in time with his exhales.Seconds passed that seemed like minutes and vice versa.I lost all sense of time with Liam inside methere were no worries about the future or the past, just this moment.Again, I gazed at the stars, then down at his beautiful face, which was twisted into a grimace but still undeniably handsome.My body ached with desire.Even as he plunged my depths, I wanted him farther in.If he could overtake me entirely, it wouldnt be enough.I wondered if anyone had ever wanted someone as much as I wanted him right now.Or if it was at all possible that Liam wanted me just as badly, whichunbelievable though it wasit seemed like he did.For those few, ecstatic moments, we were forces of nature, dipping into each other like two desert worn nomads diving into a pool of pristine water.Im gonna come, he said into my ear, his voice gruff and insistent.No, please.Not yet, I begged.Desperate for more, I clenched the muscles inside me around his pulsing erection.But Liam didnt slow down.He pushed again and again and smashed his face into my neck.I felt speared, owned, like I had no control but I wanted it that way.I could have died right then and there.Every inch of me was tingly and numb at the same time.Buzzing.Liam panted against the base of my neck and groaned.He kept moving, but slower and slower.I felt him release, but he didnt stop.Neither of us wanted it to end.Mischa, he said, as if reminding me of the name I had forgotten.No!Too soon!I panicked, feeling him shudder, then gently pull out.My quick, shallow breaths reverberated against his leather jacket.I wanted to rewind the movie to five minutes ago and pause it forever.I had the same sad helplessness that overcame me whenever I reached the bottom of a bag of potato chips, but multiplied.For a moment, we stood there motionless and expectant, as if someone was about to arrive and tell us what came next.Liam knelt down to face me, looking into my eyes as if they held the answer.I smiled and searched his face in return.Then, as if hed just remembered he had somewhere to be, he yanked the condom off, tossed it into a storm drain, and put his pants back on in a hurry.My self consciousness returning in full force, I did the same, tugging my jean shorts back over the tops of my thighs.Buttoning them took an embarrassing amount of effort.You want a ride back?I heard him ask, his eyes averted as he headed for the drivers side of the car.Sure, I answered, frowning at the notion he would even ask.I glanced around at the surrounding houses, down the sidewalk toward the dark end of the street, to make sure no one but myself was witnessing this pathetic aftermath, and got back into the car.We drove the short distance to Juliens without talking.I was utterly confused that things could turn so quickly after what we had just shared and clung to the hope that maybe I was just missing something, that things were actually okay.From the side, I studied Liams face but saw nothing of the determination or resolve that had been there earlier.Instead, there was shame and emptiness, and then I got it.Just like I loved a slice of pizza before it went into my mouth and hated it once it was down my throat, Liam felt that way about me now that I had been consumed.I had been to enough meetings to get it, even if I didnt want to.The shame he felt came over me too.I wanted to curl up into a ball, make myself invisible, the way Id toss out an empty pizza box so I didnt have to look at it anymore.This was not a feeling I wanted to experience in the presence of another person.It was a loneliness that demanded aloneness.As he turned the corner onto Juliens street, I glanced one last time at the stars through his sunroof and noticed the harsh, impersonal scent of leather that pervaded the car.* * * By Sunday afternoon, the reality had settled in that Liam was not coming back for a do over.He wasnt knocking down Juliens front door demanding to see me or following my car in traffic, even though I kept checking for him in the rearview mirror.He hadnt magically procured my phone number.He had probably forgotten my name, for all I knew.It was exactly what I had feared when he had so unceremoniously dropped me off at Juliens house on Friday night: The most amazing, unforgettable, mind blowing night of my life was, for Liam, just another empty one night stand.I hadnt slept at all the night it happened and didnt fare much better on Saturday.So when the time came for my weekly trip to Isabellas, I seriously thought about canceling.Then I remembered how skinny she had looked the last time I saw her, and the half pound of grass fed butter I had purchased last week for the express purpose of sneaking it into her food, and made haste to her condo.What is wrong with you?she asked for the fifth time as I overpeeled a carrot, barely holding back tears.Youre infusing my food with sadness!I will die if I eat this!she exclaimed.Im sorry.Im fine, really.I must have PMS, I said.Isabella winced at the crack in my voice.Dont try that with me.Im too old.What happened?I looked across the counter into her large brown eyes, which appeared haggard under her penciled in eyebrows.Instead of saying anything, I just shook my head until she walked over and removed the peeler from my hand.Lets take a ride, shall we?In her retirement communityissued golf cart, Isabella drove me to the eighth hole of the golf course, otherwise known as her thinking perch, just down the street from her house.It was early afternoon, hot and muggy and bright enough that nobody was outside.As the cart came to a stop at the edge of the green, we were surrounded by nothing but silence and an endless stretch of crisp, pristinely mowed grass.Did somebody die?she asked, sounding grave.No.I sounded as if I wished someone had.Then what, darling?You have my undivided attention.I sighed, knowing she would get it out of me sooner or later.I slept with someone.Well thats cause for celebration, is it not?It was a one night stand.Even better!I shook my head.I feel horrible.That will pass, she said.Are you in love?I shook my head again.Thats the pathetic part.I mean, I hardly know him.I shifted in my seat to face her.Its Liam.I told you about him.The sex addict.Isabella coughed out a laugh.Ha!Theres no such thing.I think its pretty real.He goes to meetings for it.Well, if theres meetings for it, I guess that makes me a sex addict too.Except Ive been in severe withdrawal for the past ten years.And look!I havent died!She got out of the cart and crossed her arms, walking onto the golf course in her prim white ballet flats.I followed her out, wishing I had a hat as the sun beat down from directly above.This is the Australian, no?she asked, raising a bony hand to block the sun from her eyes.I nodded in response.So how was it, Fluffy?She had co opted my mothers nickname for me ever since I had told her about it.She tended to use it whenever she noticed I was down, which seemed counterintuitive, but I dont think Isabella had ever fully grasped that it was a reference to my weight.It was good, I lamented.You dont do that very often, do you?she said.I shook my head, wanting to cry for the millionth time that weekend as I stared into the distance, cursing my weakness.I thought of grief stricken Julien and how he managed to drag himself out of bed every morning and put on a brave face for the day, raising a teenage daughter, writing a book.In comparison, my problems were trifling.What was I even so sad about?I hardly knew Liam, yet he had gotten under my skin more than anyone I had ever met.I wanted to know him and desperately wanted him to know me.Half of me believed we were kindred spirits.The other half thought that must be a sham if he could walk away so easily.Well, Ill let you in on a little secret, Isabella said, and sauntered up to me, playfully grabbing my elbow.You got the best of him!Thats all hes good for.I sighed, inconsolable.I know you think like that, but I dont.This isnt opinion Im giving you.Its fact.Theres only a few people on this earthonly a few men, I should saywho will ever really care about you and whom you will care about.And even then, it probably wont last.But this one?He doesnt sound like hes on the short list.So you got the best of him.See?I nodded, mostly to appease her.As much as I wanted to think like Isabella, or Gracie for that matter, there was no changing the fact that my heart was highly breakable, prone to unrealistic flights of fancy.Still, I continued to take in her words, even after Id coached her through every last bite of her dinner, stowed away the rest of the red beans and rice and chicken touffe I had made in Pyrex dishes, and driven home.Just before bed, after eating a grotesque combination of snacks in what must have equated, calorie wise, to an eight course dinner, I repeated her assessment of the situation like a mantraI got the best of him I got the best of himthen collapsed from exhaustion into a (mercifully) dreamless sleep.In the morning, for a few blissful hours, I felt magically recovered.With Ceciles blessing, I brought my juicer in from the trunk of my car and made a large batch of Rise and Revitalize juicesomething I was in the process of perfecting for my cleansewith organic produce I had rushed out to buy first thing.Although she turned up her nose at the ingredients (dandelion greens, beets, ginger, and bee pollen among other things), Cecile drank the concoction without gagging.Is this gonna make me skinny?she asked after gulping down all eight ounces of it and examining the greenish red sediment left behind in her glass.I hesitated before answering such a loaded question.Well, not in and of itself, but once I have my whole cleanse perfected, yes.Weight loss will definitely be one of the benefits.So what else do you have to do?For the cleanse, I mean?Cecile was now hovering over the juice pitcher and sniffing the drink as if she was still forming her opinion on whether or not it sucked.Oh no.This is dangerous territory, I thought.I wanted to say that a teenage girl shouldnt be cleansing at all, but I didnt want to make her feel bad for being curious.Its just a mixture of juices and healthy foods.I havent finished working it out yet, I said.In truth, like most other cleanses, it was an agonizing, ten day, liquid only affair, the goal of which was to rejuvenate your insides and outsides and do the work of three months dieting in a fraction of that time.The difference between mine and the other ones out there, I hoped, would be the illusion of fullness.I wasnt quite there yet Cecile lowered her voice and leaned across the counter in my direction.I wanna lose fifteen pounds.Can you help me?No, no, no, no, no.You need to wait until youre done growing to worry about that, I said matter of factly, taking it upon myself to act as an authority.On the one hand, I knew exactly how she felt, having wanted the exact same thing at her age, but I could guess the right and wrong ways to answer.Eat healthy, stop when youre almost full, and get involved in physical activities that make you happy.Do you play sports?I swim.I used to play tennis with my mom too.Do you play?No, I wish I did.Thats okay.I wouldnt want to play with you anyway.She looked me up and down.Youre probably too slow.With that, she picked up her bejeweled iPhone and shuffled out of the room.I winced in a delayed reaction to Ceciles comment, which was an obvious dig at my weight.I had forgotten how mean teenage girls could be.The tiniest part of me wanted Liam to magically appear so that I could drag him into the house, point him out, and say, See this?Look who I slept with the other night!A god among men, thats who!So keep the body snarking to yourself!But my affiliation with that god among men was not one that currently filled me with pride, and his approval of my body, as I now understood, was no more than a transient, passable attraction to a willing and available subject.The fact was, I cared whether or not Cecile liked me, accepted me, thought of me as attractive, because I needed her and Julien more than ever now.With every passing day, they felt more and more like family, and Id always wanted a sister or a brother, even if that meant enduring her adolescent mood swings.Alone in the kitchen, I cleaned up the mess from my juicer and thoughts of Liam popped into my head like pernicious little fruit flies.I reacted by swatting at the air, as if something so simple could make them go away.Seven Julien and I had driven to campus separately because he had a meeting or somewhere else to be that afternoonI couldnt remember.When I got back to my car in the parking lot by the lit building, there was a note tucked under one of my windshield wipers that read: I need to see you.Meet me at Trio @ midnight.Ill leave the back door openL.My initial reaction was to crumple the paper in my hand and search the parking lot for a trash can.Then, on second thought, I uncrumpled it and read it over again, studying the precise block letters.It surprised me that Liam had nice penmanship.It surprised me, too, that he knew where to find me, not to mention that he had recognized my car and written me a note in the first place.He should have forgotten about me by now.Realistically, a girl like myself was a dime a dozen in his world.But somehow this had happened.Out of sheer curiosity, I had no choice but to follow Liams trail of breadcrumbs back to the fancy restaurant he owned across town.When I got there hours later, the back door was ajar as promised.I made my way quickly across the darkened parking lot, noting that there were two other cars there, not one.When I entered the kitchen, only half the ceiling lights were on, and I almost tripped over a mop handle that had tipped over from its resting place on the wall, but I caught myself just in time.Putting the mop back upright, I heard a faint sound, like a tiny squeal, and moved into the dining room, taking smaller and smaller steps as I heard another, more intense squeal.As I got closer to the sound, I determined that it was coming from a woman.For some reason, at first I worried that Liam was hurting her, but then I came to my senses and realized they were having sex.Someone else had gotten to him first.How was this possible?Had he left fifteen notes exactly like mine lying on other car windshields around town?Probably, I figured.Liam, of all people, must be aware that successful booty calling was a numbers game.Apparently, I had become jaded overnight.Liams office was down a short corridor, past the bathrooms.The door had a large glass pane that offered a view inside, only somewhat obstructed by wooden blinds hanging on the opposite side of the door.Like the hero in an action movie, I slid my back against the wall and craned my neck to peek through the glass pane.In a strange twist, I felt curious without being angry or upset.More than anything, I just wanted to see.Oh shit!Fuck me!the woman cried, her bare buttocks buoyed up against the edge of his desk as Liam propped his hands on her shoulders.Shoving aside a laptop and stacks of paperwork, Liam, who was fully dressed except for the pants dangling around his ankles, repositioned the girl so that she was lying on her back.I could see her muscular legs and arms reaching up for him, begging him to take her.This was not the lithe model type Id pictured him with.She was more like a stocky personal trainer with small, pert breasts that sat atop her sternum like pectoral muscles that had been slightly inflated.Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, fuck me, she demanded as Liams massive cock came into my view before disappearing inside her.She was tan, her muscled body slick with perspiration.I watched in awe as she groped him, then touched her own breasts as he thrust inside her, gritting his jaw.I couldnt believe what I was seeing.Id never been witness to real live sex beforeI had hardly even watched pornography.The sights and sounds of it were titillating.My self awareness melted away as I plastered myself against the glass door, nose practically smashing against the glass as I drank in the scene.Pulling out, he slid his hands up the back of her legs, pushing them up so they rested against the length of his body as he went at it again.Dont stop, I thought, then, Holy shit!I am a voyeur.How did I not know this?I inched forward for an even better view.I didnt want to get caught, but at the same time, I couldnt stop watching.Is this why hed invited me here?Had he assumed I wouldnt be able to resist the sight of him doing what hed done to me to someone else?Did he instinctively know that Id be turned on?I could see his erection now that her legs were pinned back.It was moving in and out of her in time with her own thrusts, like they were two parts of a well oiled machine.The force of him pushed her farther and farther over the edge of the desk so that her head was hanging back now.Lost in the peep show, I let out a little sigh, which prompted Liam to whip his head around and catch a glimpse of me through the blinds.Panicked, I hurried back toward the kitchen.Hey!he called to me as he emerged from his office.I froze in place, feeling terrified and culpable, as if I had done something really wrong.I had almost forgotten it was Liam who had asked me here in the first place.Liam held his unbuttoned pants at his waist as he sidled up to me, his eyes squinted.My heart was pounding as he leaned in and gently kissed my cheek.Hi.Im sorry you had to see that, he said, his lips trailing down to my neck.I liked it, I said, just as surprised as he was to hear the words come out of my mouth.Oh yeah?He looked me in the eye, a little flicker of excitement in his own.I nodded and Liam did the same, biting his grinning lips as he grabbed my hips and led me into the darkened dining room, back to the table where hed first tried to seduce me.There was nothing to do but let it happen.He was like the undertow and I was the reckless beachgoer who had swum out into the surf zone.As he stripped off my shirt and jeans and laid me out on the table in nothing but my white cotton panties and mismatched black lace bra, the other girl, completely naked, appeared behind him.This is Hadara, he said.I looked at the girl, who greeted me by tickling the inside of my knee that was bent over the edge of the table.Nice panties, she said.Id like to take them off of you.I wasnt sure where this was going, or if I was really prepared for it, but I did nothing to protest.She was so muscular, almost manly in her physique, and she possessed a forceful, sexual energy that, much like Liams, seemed undeniable.Liam moved to the side of the table and stroked my hair as Hadara spread my legs using the length of her forearms.Hovering over me, she pulled my bra down and pushed up my breasts as she sucked at each nipple, biting at the tips of them gently with her teeth, then licking up to my neck.I turned to Liam, beckoning him with my eyes.He reassured me with a smile.Even though I was in over my head, his presence lulled me into a kind of trance.He leaned in and kissed my forehead, whispering into my ear that I was beautiful, that hed been dreaming of watching me.Meanwhile, Hadaras hand slipped inside my underwear, her fingers expertly maneuvering between my legs.Have you ever been with a girl?she asked.What?I exclaimed, suddenly confused by her presence, as if I had imagined her this whole time.I said have you ever been with a GIRL?Her voice became incredibly loud, as if she were yelling into my ear.I heard a knocking sound, faint at first, then louder and louder.Somebody should get the door, I muttered.Theres somebody outside.Liam looked at me like I was crazy.What door?Somebodys knocking!I said, louder this time.But there is no door.Look around you.He spread his arms wide, and I saw that the room was a pitch black void.* * * The knocking was insistent.I woke up in a sweat.Unlike the morning after Liam and I had had sex, I now had to convince myself that nothing had happened, although I was in a similar state of disbelief.The dream had been so vivid, so real.The woman even had a name, Hadaradid she exist?I wanted to call him and ask, to fact check my own subconscious as if I were writing a term paper about superfoods and needed to make a footnote.Becoming aware of the actual knocking at my door, I realized this was why I woke up.Someone was really knocking.It was probably Julien.Yikes.Mischa?Sounding insistent, he called to me from outside as I scrambled out of bed.Despite my efforts not to, I was squinting at him like a mole when I opened the door in my ratty boxers and T shirt.Julien, of course, was looking put together in dark jeans and a pale blue button down.Listen, Im going ahead into the office.You wanna meet me there?Oh no, I overslept.I rubbed my eyes, barely awake.Im so sorry.Its fine, really.Ill just see you when you get there, okay?Okay.I waved goodbye as Julien hurried off, then shuffled back to the bed and checked my phoneit was nine oclock already.My alarm should have gone off at seven thirty, but I had no recollection of waking up.
