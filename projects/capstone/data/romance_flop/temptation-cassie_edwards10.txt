In the garage dry humping some chic that looked like a plastic version of Ashlee.You better be glad Ashlee stopped me from getting out cause I was ready to start cuttin.Bryan felt lightheaded.His knees buckled.He sat down in one of the waiting room chairs.He put his head inside of his hands and rubbed them down his face.He let out an exasperated sigh.Monica, I know what that looked like.But, youve got it wrong.I swear that woman is obsessed with me.We had a thing a long time ago, but I ended it before Ashlee and I started dating.Monica stared at him with her lips slightly poked out.She gave him a side eye.Typical tale.Did you see her?She was dressed like Ashlee, wore her hair like her.She even had on the same perfume Ashlee wore the night I proposed.Shes CRA ZY.Right after the thing in the parking garage, she came running into the building like a lunatic screaming and throwing stuff around in my office.When nobody could calm her, we had her arrested.I can get access to the cameras in the garage if you dont believe me.He could see Monica finally start to soften.Please.Just tell me how to reach her.Shes gone.Bryans heart sunk.Gone where?Monica leaned onto the front desk and sighed.I havent talked to her much, but she said something about moving to Richmond with her sister Tracy.Do you have her number?Monica hesitated.Please.I just want my Ash back.I cant think straight without her.Monica frowned and shook her head.This is just sad.She turned and scribbled something on a sticky pad and tore it off.Heres the number.Dont tell her you got it from me.Just please, stop beggin.Desperation does not look good on you.21  Ashlee stood in the sun on the balcony of Tracys two bedroom apartment for over twenty minutes enjoying the cool breeze.From where she stood, she could see a nice view of the city.She thought about the last three and a half years of her life.Shed had a baby at seventeen, on her own at eighteen, and two children before her twentieth birthday.She worked a job she didnt completely hate because she loved being around the people, but the constant pulling and lifting of people twice her size was causing major back and neck pain.The thought of her children growing up without a father and with a mother who had to work double shifts at least twice a week just to pay the bills caused a great amount of guilt.She had made those decisions.Now, her children would suffer because of it.She was grateful for what she had, because shed heard of cases worse than hers.She was blessed to have a loving church family, especially Mama Esther.Without her, she didnt think she would have been able to survive this long.She would probably still be trying to hang on to Jamal, begging him to do right.The thought made her shiver.Hey, sissy.Tracy said as she joined Ashlee on the balcony.I brought you some chocolate peppermint tea.Ashlee turned.Her sister held a tray with two cups of tea and some tea cakes.She gave a forced smile.She loved her older sister.Only four years apart, they were always very close.Growing up, whenever Ashlee needed anything, she came running.When Ashlee became pregnant, Tracy was going into her first year of graduate school.Shed promised her that when she finished, she could come and stay with her and shed kept good on that promise.When she finished, she looked for three bedroom apartments so Ashlee and the kids could come and stay, but Ashlee declined the offer.Even now, Ashlee wasnt planning to stay in Richmond.She just needed a break.She was too embarrassed to show up at work or at church without the ring on that everybody had noticed.She would definitely be finding a new church home.She took a month off from work.Since she never really took off for anything, she had a lot of vacation time saved and this seemed like a good time to use it.Ashlee removed the throw that lay on top of the small round table.Tracy sat the cups down.They each took a seat in one of the pink wicker chairs.Ashlee closed her eyes as she inhaled the smell of chocolate and peppermint.Tracy knew whenever Ashlee felt sad this combination always soothed her.Their grandmother used to make it for her, Tracy, and Aja whenever they spent weekends with her.Before shed died, she taught Tracy how to make it.The smell of it brought back fond memories.Ashlee took a sip and set it down.Why did I have to go and screw up my life?Ashlee lamented.She met Tracys gaze.I had the same opportunities you had and I blew it.Tracy gave her her undivided attention.For the past two weeks, Ashlee had been quiet.She cooked, cleaned, took the kids for walks, but she had yet to tell Tracy why she was really there.Tracy remained quiet.Im as smart as you are.I made good grades in school.Did you know I had a full ride to California Institute of the Arts?Tracy nodded.Youve had a difficult life.I never liked how mom treated you.If I could have, I wouldve taken you with me to George Mason.They always tried to make you be like me, not realizing you were perfect the way you were.Your gifts and talents were different from mine, but Mom refused to appreciate how special you are.I hated Mom and Dad for putting you out like that.But for what its worth, Im extremely proud of the woman youve become.And what have I become?Ashlee asked with a look of disgust.A single mother of two that works as a nursing assistant.Ashlee blew out a breath.What is there to be proud of?Youve done a lot that has caused me to be proud of you, Tracy said.Youve made a life for yourself on your own.Youve enrolled in online pre nursing classes, and you are an amazing mom.Tracy gave that a little time to sink in.She continued.You seemed so happy for the past year.Are you sure theres not anything else going on thats causing you to feel down about yourself?Ashlee picked up her cup of tea and took a long slow sip.She wasnt sure how much to tell her sister because she still felt embarrassed for allowing herself to believe somebody like Bryan could really love her.She shouldve listened to the warning bells sounding off in her head.He was such a smooth talker.Hed really convinced her she was the only one for him.She told herself not to get her hopes up and what did she do?She got hurt.She figured she might as well tell her since she and her children had taken over her house.At least, she should know why.Bryan and I broke up.What happened?I saw him and some super model looking woman kissing in the parking garage of his job.She started to get mad all over again.It was in broad daylight too, like they didnt care who saw them.He was leaned all against the car and she had him back almost in a choke hold.I dont even see how he was able to breathe.That was Ashlees first time saying that aloud.So what did he say when you asked him about it?He didnt say anything because I havent talked to him.Tracy raised an eyebrow.Has he tried to contact you?He doesnt know where I am.Ashlee rolled her eyes.And I plan to keep it that way.Ive seen a lot of problems in relationships, Tracy said.And most are because of not communicating.Things arent always as they seem.At least talk to him and see what he has to say.Ashlee closed her eyes and laid her head back.I cant.I dont think straight when were together.I tend to believe everything he says.I cant trust my own judgement when it comes to him.She opened her eyes and looked at her sister.Im done.We shouldnt have ever been together in the first place.I knew better.What do you mean you knew better?Ashlee wrapped herself up in her blanket and hugged it tight.Were just too different.She whispered, Why did I ever think a handsome successful lawyer who could have anyone he wanted would be completely satisfied with someone like me?Tracy moved the table that separated their chairs.She moved her chair so she was seated directly beside her sister.She took Ashlees hands in hers and looked into her eyes.Ashlee Shante Allen, dont ever let me hear you talk about yourself that way.You are fearfully and wonderfully made in the image of God.You were created on purpose and God does not make mistakes.Mama, Daddy, Jamalthey are all missing out on the strong, intelligent, beautiful woman Im looking at right now.I wasnt there so I cant say much about Bryans actions, but if he treated you as badly as you are saying, then its his loss too.You are the prize, honey, not him.Tracy wiped the tears that trickled down her sisters face with the end of the blanket and stood.Now, come here.Ive got something you need to see.If Ashlee was upset enough to leave her job, pack up herself and her children, and move to an entirely different city without letting him know, she must have been pretty shaken up over what she saw.Bryan would never forgive himself for allowing his bad decisions to affect her like this.He knew without a doubt when he spoke with her again, he couldnt tell her about Breah.He would likely lose her forever.As soon as hed left the nursing home, he called the number Monica had given him and spoke with Tracy.Tracy told him she didnt know what was going on between them because Ashlee had not told her yet.When hed explained to Tracy he and Natalia were a thing that happened before he met Ashlee, Tracy advised him to get some sort of proof of his innocence before he approached her, because based on the current state Ashlee was in, she wouldnt listen to him without it.Thankfully, Bryan was able to convince Alex, one of the security guys from his firm, to get him a copy of the tape showing what actually happened.He was already on his way to Richmond when his phone alerted him that he had an email.He took the next gas exit and sat in the parking lot and watched it.The video showed him swiftly walking towards his car with Natalia chasing him.He watched as he tried to open his car door, her slamming it, and pushing him against the car.He noted a car speeding off, which he assumed was Monica and Ashlee.Moments later, the clip showed him going inside of the building and then Natalia being taken out of the building in handcuffs kicking and screaming.He sent the video attachment to Tracys email and asked her to show it to Ashlee.He informed her he would be there in about thirty minutes.Tracy responded back to his email that she would, but only after shed watched it first because she didnt plan to cause her sister anymore pain.If she found it acceptable, then shed send him a text letting him know it was safe to come inside.Ashlee sat back on the couch, after watching the video on Tracys computer and closed her eyes.She felt horrible for not trusting Bryan.How could she have ever doubted him?He had been nothing short of amazing to her.Shed gone for more than two weeks without speaking to him.First, shed disappeared and stopped talking to him for three days because she was embarrassed by her own actions.Now, shed skipped town without even letting him explain.After all of that, he still went out of his way to find her.She figured Monica must have given him Tracys number because nobody else had it or even knew where she was.She realized then she must be someone pretty special to him and to God for putting him in her life.She looked at Tracy who sat in a nearby recliner watching her.So, Tracy said, what were you saying about someone like Bryan not being able to love someone like you?Looks like love to me.Im going to step outside and call Bryan.Before she left Hampton, shed planned to return the phone to him, but changed her mind right before shed left, because she didnt want to face him.Instead, she turned it off and tossed it in her bag.She ran into the back room to get it.When she turned it on, it started dinging non stop.When it finally stopped, there were fourteen text messages, all but two from Bryan, and twenty seven missed calls.Three were from Monica.One was from Mama Esther, and the rest were from Bryan.Shed call the others back, but first she had to get her man.Ashlee quickly walked out onto the balcony and leaned against the rail.She didnt bother to close the door.She was so caught up in anticipation of hearing Bryans voice on the other end, she didnt notice when he stepped out onto the balcony.She gasped when she felt herself being spun around and pulled into a pair of familiar arms.She stared into eyes shed missed for far too long.She opened her mouth to speak.He cut her off by placing his lips onto hers.The kiss said everything.He didnt want an explanation or an apology.Everything he wanted was right there his arms.
