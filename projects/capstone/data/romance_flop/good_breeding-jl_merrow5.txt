I only met him last year, and Hugh and I were already together.So obviously, theres never been any question that we might, well He trailed off, because clearly there was no need to emphasize just how much Giles hadnt noticed how broad Ozs shoulders were, or the way his eyes crinkled up when he smiled.And Giles certainly hadnt ever sneaked a peek at his roommate doing sit ups in his shorts first thing in the morning Anyway, hes never shown even the slightest sign of being interested in me that way, he finished, unable to keep a soupon of disappointment out of his voice.Mummy gave him a hug, and bent down to kiss him on the forehead.Im sure you know best, darling.Now, why dont you run along and play with your friend while I sort out lunch?Giles trudged dutifully into the living room.Oz was playing Little Big Planet, and his sackboy avatar seemed to have acquired a new costume, very much along Zorba the Greek lines.Et tu, Oz?Giles muttered, flopping onto the sofa.Uh?Oz said, fingers flying on the console.He didnt look up from his game.Giles crossed his legs, then uncrossed them.He picked up the Radio Times and stared, unseeing, at the cover before throwing it down again on the coffee table.The cushions seemed extraordinarily uncomfortable today.He leant forward.I He stopped, and cleared his throat.I thought I might go back and see her again, he said diffidently.My mother, I mean.You could come too, if you like, he added.Oz hit the pause button, and turned to face him.Sure about that?Yes.I want to show Angie Im not embarrassed to have my friends meet her.Somehow, Giles had managed to twist himself into an extremely awkward position, but his limbs felt far too tense to try and relax.All right, then.Oz handed him the second console, and Giles took it, his breathing coming a little more easily.Better leave it a few days, though, hadnt we?After all, its been a lot for her to take in, too.But yeah, Ill look forward to meeting your mum.Giles smiled.Suddenly he felt around ten stone lighter.* * * *  Angie beamed when she saw them the following week.Wayne, love!I wasnt expecting to see you again so soon!She turned to her daughter, who was sitting on the floor, fag in hand, filling out a sex survey in a magazine.Didnt I say, Shards, that he wouldnt be round here again in a hurry, now hes found out what a bunch of bleedin chavs we are?Giles felt a nasty twinge of guilt.Of course I came round again!he protested.Youre my mother!Ohand this is Oz.Hes a very good friend of mine.For some reason, Giles blushed as he said it.He flicked a glance at Oz, whose amused expression only made Giless face grow hotter.Angie gave him a hug.Oh, its all right, love.You can call him your boyfriend, nobody minds here.The sack of potatoes in the armchair gave a grunt, which Giles suspected was Pete speak for snog him at your peril.The ape, thank God, was absent.Perhaps itd been carted back to the zoo, Giles thought hopefully, then gave himself a mental slap on the wrist.Really, Oz is just a friend, Giles insisted.We share a house, thats all.Oh, get on with you!A good looking bloke like that?Well, if you dont want him, Ill ave him!Angie cackled.You ear that, Pete?
