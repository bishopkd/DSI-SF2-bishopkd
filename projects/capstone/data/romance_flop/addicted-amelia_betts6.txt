Okay, fine, I said.Out of nowhere, my heart had been sucked into a vat of quicksand.In the past two minutes alone, my emotions had vacillated between happy and scared and defeated so quickly I should have had whiplash.Everything felt so loaded between us now that we had opened up to each other.Yet the conversation had been so natural and fun, I had imagined us staying here on the rooftop until the sun came up, watching it rise together like a couple of wayward kids at summer camp.Now I was nearly convinced he hated me.As Liam stood dripping by a deck chair, I realized there was nothing to dry him off.Oh, we forgot to get towels!I said.Ill go down and grab one.Thats fine.Ill just follow you.Liams voice was hard to read.He left a watery trail as he shuffled behind me into the elevator and stood there, holding his clothes in a bundle at his waist.You know I dreamt about you too, he said with a straight face as we arrived at the second floor, the doors opening before I could respond.Were we having a threesome?I asked, desperate to steer things back toward flirting.No.Just the two of us.I dont think Id like to have a threesome with you.Why not?Because Im a good girl?I rolled my eyes for him to see.Because I wouldnt want to share you, he said.Eleven Inside the mens shower room, I flipped on the lights.Instantly, I was reminded how gorgeous Sashas spa was throughout.She had modeled it, room by room, after some spa at an insanely expensive Greek resort where shed spent her second honeymoon.This room included two massive eight headed showers, a dry sauna, a steam room, and a large marble bench in the middle.The lighting was warm and bright, like a sunny afternoon without the sunlight.All right, you can take a shower if you want.Well just have to steal the towel you use so no one notices.I was pretending to be very lax about the whole thing, but inside I felt the inevitable worry I had whenever I broke any rules.When Gracie had asked to use the showers, I had told her no way.I started to leave Liam there, with plans to raid the second floor mini fridge and try to forget the last few awkward moments of conversation on the roof, but before I knew it, he was grabbing my wrist to stop me.Wait, he said in a pleading tone, dropping his clothes so that his naked body, tanned and taut, stood before me, completely exposed.No, Liam.Were keeping each other out of trouble, remember?But this isnt trouble.This is different, he whispered, plunging his hand into the hair that dangled at the nape of my neck, sending tingles up and down my spine as he moved in to kiss me.I wanted to believe him, that this was different.In the moment, I actually did.Maybe it was his kiss that convinced me.His lips were extra soft after the swim.As was his skin, and the way he touched me.It was like hed shed an outer layer of toughness in the pool and become this vulnerable person, or maybe it just seemed that way because he was naked and I wasnt.All I knew was that, somehow, he had taken me in his arms and slipped his tongue inside my mouth until all my good intentions had evaporated and I was kissing him back like my life depended on it.My hands slinked up his arms and rested on his bare shoulders as he began rocking against me, grasping my butt, then inching his fingers around to my front and down the neckline of my dress.I raised my hands, allowing him to pull the dress over my head slowly.I was wearing a cotton pushup bra with yellow and white stripes that Liam instantly focused on.He moved his hands over my breasts, then underneath the shoulder straps.I like this.You could have worn it in the pool.He smiled and tugged down on the straps, pushing my boobs together as he sank his face into my cleavage.Your tits are fucking divine, he said, kissing up the top of my chest and my neck.Come here.He took me by the waist and walked me backward until the backs of my knees hit the marble bench in the center of the room.I sat down and Liam picked up my legs and laid them out.He held up an index finger as he walked over to the corner of the room to grab a white folded towel from the stack, then returned and placed it at the other end of the bench.He nodded a silent command, and I lay back, resting my head on the towel.Nothing could have prepared me for this.I had believed Liam when he said he needed a friend and had accepted that his attraction to me had been a one time thingin his mind, I was over, used up.Barely five minutes ago, I was wondering if he would ever want to speak to me again after tonight.He sat beside me on the bench for a moment, dragging his right hand up and down the middle of my torso.I like you, you know that?You make me wish I was different.His voice was hushed, soothing.You are different, I thought as I lay there, waiting to see what he would do next, every bit of exposed skin prickly with anticipation.If he didnt believe it about himself already, I wanted to somehow show him that he was different.Liam lowered his knees to the floor and began kissing my belly, nipping at my belly button with his tongue.He moved his mouth down to the waistband of my panties and tugged at it with his teeth, growling mischievously.Pausing for a second, he glanced up at me.I saw up your dress when you were sitting at the hot tub.No, you didnt.I laughed, my belly tingling as Liam rested his chin on it.Yes, I did.I couldnt stop thinking about getting in it.My stomach contracted as I laughed even harder.I felt giddy as the object of Liams rapt attention.He went back to work, dragging my sheer yellow underwear over my hips and down my legs, and tossing them behind him.Thank you for wearing those, but they wont be needed, he said, his eyes on mine as he moved around to the far end of the bench.From there, he grasped my ankles and pulled me toward him, burrowing his face in between my legs.I could feel the heat of his breath on my skin as he kissed the area just above my clitoris, making me gush with wetness.He moved down, licking and nibbling at my inner thighs, the tease of his tongue driving me crazy with anticipation.I started whimpering, tensing my entire body.Does this feel good?He slid his hands from the inside of my knees up to the tops of my thighs, parting my legs even wider.Yes, I whispered.He ran the tip of his finger up and down my sex.God, youre wet.Jesus Christ.Lick me, please, I said, surprising myself.With Bradley, I had drawn the line at cunnilingus, the very thought of which had made me shudder with embarrassment.I had been so self conscious that I couldnt even have sex with the lights on.Yet here I was with Liamby far the most attractive man Id ever laid eyes onin a lit room, dying for him to lick me, kiss me, consume every inch of my body.He had disarmed the little voice inside my head that made me hate my fluff and second guess the way I talked, walked, dressed, smelled.His attraction was so genuinely animalistic that the only thing for me to do was give in to it.And give in I did.The euphoria that overcame me in the next few minutes is hard to describe.It was like the happy buzz from every thrilling moment of my life had returned, this time condensed and coursing through my veins as if Id shot up.The slick, sweet warmth of Liams tongue poking inside me, then carrying my wetness back up to my clitoris, circling around and around, then back down, was the most maddeningly beautiful thing Id ever felt.I held out as long as I could, savoring the electrical charge that had lit up my entire body like a light.The passage of time had become completely irrelevantit could have been minutes or seconds that went by before I finally lost control.All I knew was that he was humming when I finally gasped for breath and felt the most incredible orgasm pulse through my body.I screamed in ecstasy, and Liam stayed, his face still buried between my legs, until Id experienced every last thrilling twitch.I glanced down at him just as he looked up.Your pussy tastes like cotton candy, he said.Mmmm cotton candy, I repeated.My mind drifted to food, but only for a brief second before I snapped myself back into the present.Liam crawled on top of me, kissing up my body and neck.I reached for his shoulders, hoisting him up so that I could kiss his lips and wrap my legs around his waist.His erection felt massive against my waist.I had to reach down and take it in both my hands to really believe it.Youre very big right now.Thats how much I want you, little Mischa.I grinned.Little Mischa.No one had ever called me that before, not by a long shot, and I liked it.Liam propped himself on his hands and looked past me at one of the showers.Hey.Lets get clean.Still dazed from the orgasm, I allowed him to lead me by the hand to one of the showers, a large, marbled affair with eight different showerheads.I would have let him lead me anywhere.As the water came on and pulsed hot over our bodies, I took the opportunity to put my hands on his chest and drag them down his chiseled abs.He was like a statue that had come to life, every inch of him defined, deliberate.He took my head in his hands and tilted it back under a water stream to wet my hair, and I did the same to his.We were something different now, something purer.Liam had let me behind the curtain, telling me about his mother and his own battles with depression, and I had let him in too.It hardly made sense, but when I looked at him, I felt like I was seeing a completely different person than the one who had followed me home the other night.Overwhelmed by the need to feel him inside me again, I dropped to my knees and took him in my mouth, his warm, wet skin tasting pleasant, salty.Water poured over my head and streamed down my body as I took more and more of him in, allowing the tip of his erection to penetrate the back of my throat as I moved my head back and forth.Liam rested his palm gently on the top of my head, slinking his fingers through my wet hair.Every once in a while, he encouraged me with a little groan, or thats it, or keep going, as I sucked in time with the movement of his hips.I had only done this a few times.Usually I would have been self conscious about my lack of experience, if not stifled by the fear that I was doing it wrong.But none of that even crossed my mind.We were both lost in the moment, enjoying ourselves with absolute abandon.When he warned me that he was going to come, I didnt want it to end.I kept him inside my mouth and swallowed greedily.Another first.Sore from kneeling on the marble tile, I stood up slowly and greeted a wobbly Liam with a smile.His face was ruddy.We were both happily spent.That was all right, he said with a wink.I poked at him playfully, and he kissed my forehead.I closed my eyes, silently wishing this would never end, as he began to lather me up with soap.We spent another five minutes in the heavenly water stream, steam enveloping us in our own little clouded atmosphere as we giggled and washed each other.The whole thing had been so out of left field, I had no time to wonder what was happening or what any of it meant.I was simply caught up in the excitement of Liam, who was acting like a fantasy version of himself I hadnt even dared to daydream aboutvulnerable, patient, adoring.Once we had dressed and made our way to the elevator, reality started to knock on the door of my consciousness, threatening to burst my bubble, but I wasnt ready for it yet.You know, Ive never done it in an elevator, I said, glancing around mischievously as the doors closed and we began our descent.Really?Liam smirked.Yeah, really.I leaned back against the railing and hiked my dress up to the waist, daring him to make a move.Liam, who was standing across from me, came over, but instead of taking me in his arms like I wanted him to, he leaned against the railing beside me and let out a long sigh.Mischa, we cant.Oh.Humiliated, I let my skirt drop back down and straightened up, turning to face the doors.Heyhe caressed my shoulder from behindits not that I dont want to.I shook my head as the elevator arrived at the ground floor and we made our way out in silence.In seconds, I had gone from seductress to reject.I felt like running and hiding, but there was no escaping the situationLiam needed a ride back.In the parking lot, I led him to the Dumpster where we threw the towels wed taken from the spa into the trash.I noticed his face had gone blank and felt a bitterness seeping into me as I remembered the scene after the first time wed had sex when Liam had driven me back to Juliens without uttering a word.You know, my friend Gracie has this term for that blank look certain guys get after sex.I broke the silence as we made our way back to my car.She calls it serial killer face.Youve got it now.I pointed at him, trying to sound like I was making a joke even though my heart was in the process of shattering.Thats not true.Im not some stupid frat boy who cant look a girl in the eye after Ive fucked her.I stopped walking.Then look me in the eye!I turned to face him and noticed the cloud of shame and guilt that seemed to envelop him.Liam kicked at the ground, his hands finding the pockets of his chefs coat.He glanced at me only briefly.I dont know what to say, Mischa.You know its complicated with me.It wasnt different, was it?I asked, my voice trembling.Different from what?You said back there that thisyou and mewas different!I dont know why I believed you.Its what I wanted to hear, I guess.I should have known better than to think somebody like you Somebody like me what?Was a good guy?Was worth more than a quick fuck?He finally held eye contact with me for more than a second, and I could see his guilt turning to anger.No.That someone like you would actually want someone like me.I sounded pitiful but it couldnt be helped.The best I could do was hold in my tears.I do want you.But Im fucked up.Liam groaned.Well so am I.  I thought thats what we liked about each other.I threw my hands up as Liam kicked at the ground again.The more pitiful I became, the more angry he seemed to get.Its not the same.I wish I was like you.I wish my only vice was food, or booze, or drugs.But no, I have to turn myself offshut down like a robotso that I dont keep trying to fuck you all night, or somebody else.If I didnt control it, Id be on the prowl constantly.I wouldnt stop.Do you know how hard that is?He finally looked at me, his eyes squinted in exasperation.I shook my head, no longer able to fight back the tears that traveled down my cheeks.No.I couldnt possibly understand.Im just a sweet chubby girl from Iowa, right?Mischa, thats not fair.I know, but none of this is fair.I cant be mad at you, but I am, I cried.You shouldnt have had sex with me, but you did.We were gonna keep each other out of trouble, but we didnt.Obviously this cant happen again, I said, finally voicing the thing I knew I should voice but without really meaning it.What I wanted was for him to argue the other side, to beg to be my friend or something more.But by the time Liam came up with a response, I had already opened my car door and stolen into the drivers seat, knowing he wasnt going to say anything that I wanted to hear.He couldnt.Youre right.He shook his head, getting into the passenger seat.Im sorry.Liam turned to me, studying the side of my face.Now I was the one who wouldnt look at him.Im sorry too, I answered, not sure to which of us I was apologizing as I started the car.Obviously this cant happen again.Liams voice was warm but the message was impossibly cold as he repeated my words back to me verbatim.Fine, I said as icily as possible, realizing that this was a breakup, even though wed never even been together.It felt just as painful as the only other breakup Id ever gone through when Bradley had called me over to his dorm room early one morning after avoiding me for two weeks.In a way this was worse, because at least with Bradley I had seen it coming.The ride back with Liam was as silent and somber as a funeral procession.We didnt even look at each other when we muttered our goodbyes and he slipped out of the car.Driving away, I let more of my pent up tears fall and by the time Id reached the street, they had begun to obstruct my view.I wiped at my wet cheeks furiously as I contemplated the heartbreak Id stupidly invited into my life by involving myself with this man.You should have known better, I heard my know it all inner voice saying.It was true.I had known his story from day one: sex addict, dangerous, impulsive, in a losing battle with his recovery.That Id decided to even fantasize about someone like Liam actually made me the crazy one, not him.The only person who could possibly sympathize with me now was Gracie, even if she was still mad at me from our conversation that morning.I set my phone to speaker and dialed her, and to my relief, she answered on the third ring.Gracie?What are you doing?She sounded groggy.Shit, did I wake you up?No its just two in the morning and I have work tomorrow.Why would I be sleeping?Im sorry.My voice shook.I didnt realize how late it was.You sound like a mess, Mischa.Whats going on?There was a rustle of sheets on the other line.She coughed to clear her throat.Its Liam As I said his name, a fresh wave of tears hit me and I had to gasp for breath.You mean the sex addict rock star slash restaurateur?Slash asshole, yes.Oh no.Whatd he do?I inhaled deeply in an effort to calm down.We had sex again, but he doesnt want anything to do with me.But it was the best sex of my life.Not saying much.Im sure Bradley wasnt exactly a master.Gracie, please dont do that right now.Im sorry.Its okay, its just What do I do?Sweetie, I dont know what to tell you.Im in the same boat.She sighed into the receiver.Really?My composure came back slightly as I shifted my focus onto Gracies problems and off of my own.With that guy?Richard?Yeah.We had sex finally.In a public bathroom.At a club.Ill put it this wayit was not what I had envisioned.Oh no.He had serial killer face.Like during the act.Oh shit.Liam had it tonight.I mean, not during, but close enough.God!What was I thinking?Just try not to beat yourself up, okay?What are you gonna do?I dont know.The thing is, I think Im falling for this guy.Im just hoping it was a bad first time and something will change.You never know, I said.I mean, unless he tells you he cant have sex like a normal person because hes addicted to it.Yeah, right.In this town thats more likely than not.But seriously, you sound terrible, my dear.Do I need to put you on Taco Bell watch?Too late, Ive been eating Mexican pizzas on the daily.That and everything else.I heard Gracie laugh on the other end and managed a smile.Well, we should focus on the good stuff, she said.Tell me about the best sex of your life!I thought about everything that had happened that night, but it was already tainted in my memory.I dont think I can talk about it.Fair enough.Gracie was either groaning or yawning, it was a toss up.Youre sleepy, I said.Yeah, you know, two in the morning and all.I pulled onto Juliens street and turned my headlights off as I drove up to his curb.Im sorry I woke you up, friend.I just needed to hear your voice.I hope you can get back to sleep.Yep.I love you for picking up the phone and Im sorry about earlier, I said tentatively.Me too.Her quick response made me tear up for a whole new reason.I love you, Gracie.Love you back, you crazy person, she said.We hung up just as I put the car into park and fumbled for the key to Juliens side gate that I kept in the small pocket of my purse.It was a strangely large, heavily rusted iron key that I refused to keep on my key ring, but I couldnt find it in its usual place.Then I remembered that Id removed it to go for a walk earlier that day and must not have put it back.Shit!This meant I would have to go into Juliens house and sneak through the first floor without waking anybody up, which was a long shot given my proclivity for stumbling in the dark.Id worried that this could happen at some point, and now it was happening exactly when I least wanted to be seen, my face and eyes puffy from crying, my sanity hanging on by a thread.Left with no other choice, I unlocked the front door and pulled it toward me gently, hoping to stifle the slight creaking noise it made.Inside the foyer, I noticed a blue flickering light coming from the living room.I figured Cecile had fallen asleep in front of the TV and headed down the hall to turn it off.As I got closer, I detected voices speaking a foreign language and thought it odd that this was her programming of choice.Just outside the living room, I accidentally kicked a doorstop and inadvertently announced my presence to the TV watcherwho happened to be Julien, not Cecilesitting on the couch wide awake.His back to me, he turned around and looked up.Sorry to interrupt.I left my key to the gate, I said in a half whisper.Thats okay.He sat up and paused the television.Everything okay?I had to think for a second before I could find the words to answer.Part of me wanted to keep up the pity party Id started with Gracie, but then I remembered what Julien had said about Liam just that morning and felt too sheepish to reveal anything about my heartbreak.Plus, he was my boss, not my confidant.Yeah, Im fine, I said, the timbre of my voice sounding decidedly not fine.Julien propped his arm on the back of the couch and rested his head on his hand.Cecile couldnt sleep.She woke me up to watch TV.Now Im the one who cant sleep.I got sucked into this Spanish movie about a prison guard whos planning an elaborate suicide.Wanna watch?Its actually good.I glanced at the TV, unsure how to answer.On the one hand, I was emotionally spent and should probably be facedown on a pillow right now.But on the other, Juliens presence was always comforting, and the idea of being alone with my thoughts right now definitely wasnt.Sure, why not?I said with an exhausted sigh.I made my way around the couch and plopped down beside him.As he leaned forward to unpause the movie, I registered that he was wearing a T shirt and athletic shorts.I hadnt seen him so dressed down since the day Id moved in.You want me to fill you in?he whispered as the subtitles hit the screen.No thanks.I sank back into the soft pillow behind me, remembering how Id coped with the Bradley breakup by watching endless hours of reality shows on the TV Gracie had smuggled into her dorm room.Just the blue glow of the screen had already coaxed me into a semi catatonic state.The film was dark and sad, not the kind of thing I gravitated toward on a bad day, but it was sufficiently distracting.About ten minutes in, I let my eyes close, allowing the inscrutable Spanish dialogue to mix with the steady sound of Juliens inhales and exhales to create a soothing chorus that nearly lulled me to sleep.Hey, wake up, hes about to do it!Julien poked my shoulder, and I opened my eyes wide.I wasnt falling asleep, I said with a guilty smile.On screen, the lonely prison guard was rigging a rifle to a trip wire that connected to a doorknob.Hes Christian.He thinks if someone else opens the door and triggers the gunshot, he wont go to hell.Oh.So hes just gonna sit there until someone opens the door?Yeah, hes in his office.Another guard comes to relieve him at the end of his shift.I glanced at Julien sideways, amused at how riveted he was.Do you think hes gonna die?His eyes widened.Well find out.The prison guard did die, but it wasnt from the gunshot.He was wounded when his colleague opened the door and tripped the rifle, but not fatally, and when he woke up alive in the hospital, he had a new lease on life.On the other hand, the guard who had caused the gunshot was so traumatized he went back to drinking after years of sobriety, and he eventually killed them both by running his car over a cliff.I didnt see that coming, Julien said as he clicked off the television.Really?I would think nothing surprises you.I mean you analyze stories for a living.I figured the alcoholic would die, not the both of them.But that would be the Hollywood version.Foreign filmmakers dont care as much about narrative symmetry, especially the Europeans.Hmm, thats interesting, I said, impressed as always by Juliens authoritative certainty.He sounded this way whenever he was giving an opinion on one thing or another, and just by participating in conversation with him, I felt smarter.To be accepted by my former professor as a sounding board, someone to converse with about movies or books, his book especially, was like being promoted to a position I hadnt quite earned yet.I remember you talking about narrative symmetry in class, I said, wishing I had more to add but too dazed from my night with Liam to think any more clearly.Julien seemed to be on his own train of thought.Remember the paper you wrote on Morrison?he asked.I nodded, even though I had already forgotten the bulk of my class work from that last blur of a semester.You quoted the line from Beloved, about working hard to forget everything.To forget the painful things.Oh yeah, I said.That was a great line Obviously Sethe is not a good example of that philosophy as a coping mechanism, but sometimes I wonder if thats what its all about.Like the guy in the movie, he wasnt a candidate for depression.He was just a guy who couldnt forget the terrible things he had seen and done.Somebody else could have lived that life and been just fine.Again I nodded.Julien seemed to be broaching the topic of grief, maybe even his own grief, but I was at a loss for words.A brief flash of Liam kicking at the ground outside my car reminded me why.I put that quote on my syllabus one year, and my wife made the comment that I was good at that good at forgetting.Too good, she said.He shook his head.She used this shooting I had witnessed as an example.A drive by.My whole fourth grade class had seen it out the window of a school bus on a field trip.Two guys, standing on a corner, a couple of teenagersdealers, probablygot shot in broad daylight while we were stopped at a light.Everybody on my side of the bus was looking.Thats horrible, I said, noticing how Juliens face had become drawn as he recalled the painful memory.It was horrible.Tragic.But it didnt take me long to get over it.Other kids couldnt stop thinking about it and talking about it for weeks.I swear they had PTSD.But me?I just read my books, wrote my stories.I was doing all right.That first year after Renays death, I was so afraid of having the same reaction, I went in the opposite direction.I thought about it too much.I wasnt conscious of it until I read the quote in your paper.I think I was supposed to read that quote again.He had been staring off into space, but now Julien turned and looked into my eyes.His expression was an odd mixture of pain and relief.He reached out and placed his hand over mine on the seat between us.I thought I should tell you that.Im glad, I said, uncertain how to react.I looked down at my hand under Juliens, confused by the gesture.It would have been one thing for him to place his hand on mine in the daylight, at his office, in another context than this.Here we were in the dark late at night, with just enough light coming through the windows for me to see a yearning in Juliens eyes.Before this, I had interpreted whatever intimacy there was between us as pedagogical, almost familial.This was different, though.My reflexes finally kicked in and I drew my hand back, standing up from the couch like I was spring loaded.Im so tired.Id better get some sleep.Of course.Julien stood too.Neither of us moved for a moment.He looked sheepishly at the ground.Mischa, Im sorry.I What?No I stopped him with a chaste pat on the arm.Please, you have nothing to be sorry about, I said, and shook my head, smiling uncomfortably as I made my way around the couch.I suddenly felt bad for making Julien feel like hed done something wrong.He couldnt have meant anything by touching my hand, could he?Ill see you in the morning, I said.Ill have to go into the office early, he blurted, awkwardly pointing to his bare wrist as if there were a watch there.You can come as late as you want.In fact, why dont you just take the day off?One of us should get a good nights sleep, right?His voice had switched back into authoritative mode, as if he were trying to erase the fact that wed just watched a late night movie together and followed it up by talking about his personal life.Okay?I sounded surprised as Julien disappeared upstairs, taking two steps at a time.I stayed in the darkened foyer for a few more seconds wondering what exactly had just happened, then decided it was probably in my best interest to forget all about it.Twelve I awoke after what couldnt have been more than two hours of sleep.The only evidence I had slept at all was a wet spot on my pillow where I had drooled.A more levelheaded person would have taken a sleeping aid, but I had chosen to suffer through the night, thinking back over the past eight hours to all the magical and awful things that had transpired between me and Liam, and then the strangeness that had followed with Julien.Fact: even after he had told me on no uncertain terms that we were done, I felt myself falling for Liam.As much as I knew I should focus on the bad and get over him, I couldnt shake the vivid memories of his tenderness when we had made love, how hed held my hand when I had told him about my father and stared into my eyes like he really knew me.Id never felt that close to a man before, not even Bradley.Especially not Bradley.Also, fact: Julien Maxwell had reached out for me in the dark, and I still couldnt make sense of it.In the light of day, it seemed clearer that he had been feeling something more than platonic, but how?Wouldnt I have seen signs leading up to last night?Had he just reached out for me as a source of comfort and I had misinterpreted the whole thing?In terms of Liam, I decided in the vague clarity I had gained after my two hours of sleep that I had to face the writing on the wall.I couldnt keep giving in to moments of weakness and chasing after him.Actions speak louder than words, as Gracie would say, and Liams actions had told me that I was only desirable in brief spurts; that just as easily as he drew me in, he could cut me loose without warning.I had ignored his ambivalence and obsessed over him to the point of ridiculousness, and it was time to stop.What I really needed was to focus on other thingsmy future, for one.What was to become of me after August was still a giant question mark, and all I had done in the face of that uncertainty was to eat, eat, eat, and obsess, obsess, obsess.But what was I going to do?I hadnt even been bumped off the waiting list for the graduate program at Reid and hadnt spent any time considering the handful of programs where I had been accepted.A tiny part of me had been hoping Julien might stick his neck out and put in a good word for me with the dean of graduate studies, but had the awkwardness of last night ruined any chance of that?If I were going to be proactive and find out, I would march into his office and confront the situation, but that option was off the table since Julien had basically forbidden me from coming in by giving me the day off.What do I do?What do I do?What do I do?I said as I dragged myself out of bed, feeling heavy with defeat.All I wanted to do was eat, preferably tucked away in a dark corner somewhere where no one would find me for days.Id never been such a mess.Baby steps, I heard a voice of reason speak up in the back of my head.One thing at a time.The first thing I needed was a shower.After that, I would change into the nicest sundress that still fit my body, put on some tinted sunscreen that made me look half alive, and with my head held high, make my way into Juliens kitchen for some breakfast.He would be at work by now anyway, so the only potential interaction would be with my number one teenage frenemy, Cecile.Though simple, the plan took me a while to executethe first two dresses I tried were part of my wishful thinking collectionbut when I finally managed to clothe myself and headed into the kitchen, I looked more put together than I had all summer.A cool blast of air conditioning greeted me upon entering, and I was relieved to find myself alone.With a deep exhale, I said, Thank you, and dragged my juicer down from its perch on top of the refrigerator.Youre welcome, Ceciles voice chimed in as she shuffled into the kitchen in her swim team suit and a towel.Hearing this, my stomach dropped.You want some juice?I offered, opting for plan A: play it cool, act like the Droolian Poundwell incident never happened, try and reestablish a rapport.Sure.She took the bait, ambling over to the counter and placing her hands primly on the edge of it.I grabbed a bundle of yellow green kale that Id let sit a little too long in the fridge and held it up for her to scrutinize.As long as you dont mind me using this.Cecile shrugged, and I proceeded to shove the kale into the feed chute of my juicer, not bothering to rinse it.Her silence seemed like a good omen, and I tried to tell myself that her teenage attention span had probably already moved on from Gracies silly text.So, hows your crush on my dad coming along?she said, quashing my wishful thinking.If only I could tell her it was quite possibly the other way around after last nights developments.Of course, she would never believe me.I turned to look at Cecile, hoping to convey impenetrability.Cecile, I told you it was my friend who had the crush.I dont believe you, she said.And because I dont believe you, Im going to ask you to do some things for me.Oh, cmon, Cecile.Life doesnt work like one of your Disney sitcoms.A text from my friend isnt grounds for blackmail.I threw an apple on the cutting board and attacked it with the biggest knife I could find.Wanna bet?Cecile lifted her phone from the counter and unlocked the screen.Just dialing my dad at his office.Ill let him know what I saw on your phone.Stop!I turned around, knife midair.Im serious.What are you gonna do?She cocked her head to the side.Kill me?What do you want, Cecile?I felt myself tearing up.It was a result of my exhaustion and heartbreak over Liam, but Ceciles taunting was the spilled milk that pushed me over the edge.I cant fight with you right now, okay?Im tired, and Im sad, and I dont know what Im doing with my life, and the last thing I want is to argue with you over some stupid text message you werent supposed to see Staring at me like I had two heads, Cecile put down her phone.I just want to be your friend, Cecile.I mean that.I saw her face soften and was inspired to keep going.I cant imagine how hard it is, losing your mom, but I do know what its like to grow up without a dad.I know what its like to be angry and to want to take it out on somebody, but I also know that thats not worth it.And youre better than that.I detected a little tremble in Ceciles chin and determined that something I said had gotten to her.She remained uncharacteristically silent as I turned back to the cutting board, tossed the two apple halves in the juicer, and finished off our drinks.* * * It turned out the tough love approach was the way to go with Cecile.Over juice, she told me that since her mom had died, she sometimes found herself being mean to people for no reason and had a hard time stopping once shed started.I gave her my best attempt at sisterly advice about thinking before speaking and counting to ten when a wave of anger came on.It was clich stuff I guess, but Cecile seemed to absorb it thoughtfully.We even hugged before she went off to swim practice, and my heart lifted just a tiny bit.Then, an ironically timed text from my mother popped up on my phone: Any news about grad school?Without answering, I shoved the phone into my purse and headed for the door, remembering that I hadnt checked in with my subletter for any mail delivered to my old apartment in the past few weeks.The day before graduation, I had provided the post office with my new address, but nothing had shown up to Juliens house yet and I was anxious about it.Especially now that I was waking up from the Liam induced fever dream that had taken over the first part of my summer.The old apartment building was just as I had left itslightly depressing, a little run down, and mostly populated with old people despite its proximity to a college campus.When she came to the door, the subletter, Anjuli, looked entirely out of place in this setting.She was glamorous and 5'9" with the exotic features of someone with a diverse ethnic background.When we had e mailed, I had envisioned something very differenta petite, similarly fluffy girl, perhaps with an Indian accent.Instead, she sounded vaguely British and looked like a runway model.I was completely and utterly intimidated before shed even introduced herself.Im Mischa.I held out my hand and managed a pursed smile.I hated when I reacted this way to beautiful girls, but after the last twenty four hours, I was battling a pretty bad case of self pity.Also, I wanted to kick myself for changing out of the sundress Id put on earlier and into my too tight jean shorts that seemed to be shrinking even smaller under Anjulis gaze.You know?I think Ive only gotten junk mail for you; otherwise I would have e mailed you about it.But I did keep it all in a pile.Please, come in.I followed her inside and noticed immediately the cleanliness and order, not to mention the smell of fresh laundry, or a fancy candle that was made to smell like fresh laundry.I had never kept the place this niceanother strike against my already battered self esteem.In the kitchen, she handed me the mail and I flipped through it, seeing nothing of importance.Shit!I said under my breath.Are you waiting on something?Im waiting to hear from the grad school.The one here?Yeah.They waitlisted me, I explained.Anjuli placed her hands on her hips, her thin arms showcasing themselves in a perfect V.  So youre thinking of staying even longer?Wow.I dont even know if Im gonna make it through summer term.Why not?I asked, slightly defensive.I dont know, Oceansides kind of a weird place, dont you think?Weird how?I had never considered it as anything other than a classic college townalbeit on the beach.I dont know, maybe the summer is different, but the people here just seem bored, or boring.Where are you from?New York.Thats your problem, then.Im from a small town in Iowa, so absolutely nothing is boring to me.She let out a low laugh that made me smile despite myself.Youre probably right.I havent given it much of a chance, she said.Eager to leave this superior version of my apartment and its new, superior tenant, I told Anjuli I had somewhere to be, which was a complete and utter lie.As I walked out the door, she called after me.Hey, you should try going to the Admissions office on campus.They can tell you if the letter was mailed!Yeah, thats a good idea.Thanks!I shouted back with absolutely no intention of taking her advice.I had already filled my weeks quota of face to face rejectionsI couldnt risk another.As I drove away, I found the car practically steering itself onto the exact route it had gone so many times before: a quick right, one left, and another right directly into the drive thru of everybodys favorite, golden arched fast food haven.I will have two cheeseburgers, a ten piece chicken nugget, large fry, and medium sweet tea, I barked into the speaker box.And a straight razor.Okay, two cheeseburgers and a number four.Whatever it is, yes.As some sort of twisted defense mechanism, I had always refused to learn the names or numbers of super value meals wherever I went.It helped me deny the frequency with which I ate the things.Over the years, certain drive thru cashiers had even tried to bond with me, giving me frequent flyertype bonuses like extra sauce, or a larger drink, but I did my best to discourage them.I had a strong need to feel anonymous in these transactions, as if I could be anybody.In a way, it was the same fucked up logic that allowed me to believe that shared plates and appetizers didnt really count toward my calories for the day, because there was no telling how much Id eaten versus the other persondenial at its finest.Once my food had been paid for, bagged, and handed over in a sufficiently impersonal exchange, I decided to drive to the beach.Not just the beach, but the same spot where Julien had taken me for midday drinks and tacos on my first day of work.I knew I wouldnt run into him there, after observing his workaholic habit of eating lunch at his desk every day, so I felt safe going there with my bag full of trans fats.Maybe I thought that sitting in one of Juliens favorite spots would help me process what had just happened between us.Or maybe I lacked imagination when it came to favorite beach spots.Certain habits are peculiar to overeaters, and ritualistic choices about where to eat is one of them, so the odds were I had some strange subconscious impulse driving me there.But the minute I started to mull over whether or not Julien Maxwell could possibly have feelings for me, I felt myself shutting down, like there was no more room in my brain for new complications.Liam had maxed me out.Just pretend it never happened, I heard the voice of reason say.It sounded like a good enough plan for the moment Another overeater habit to which I was highly prone was the strange combining of foods.Most people dont wash down cheese puffs with a peanut butter smoothie or shove red licorice sticks into their tacos.I was currently fitting chicken nuggets inside my cheeseburgers, more of a classic taste combination, but still unusual.At least I was eating slowly and had waited to touch the stuff before I arrived at the beach.Hardly ever did I let my fries get cold, but there they were, tepid by the time I had gotten to the bottom of the container.The meal was over within five minutes, at which point I fought the urge to crumple into a ball and weep.
