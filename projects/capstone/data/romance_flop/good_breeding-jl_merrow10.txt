So youre still speaking to me, now you know Im a chav?If youre still speaking to me, Giles said.He rested his head in his hands.Im an idiot.A selfish, snobbish idiot.Whos been wasting his time with another selfish, snobbish idiot.And all this time you and I have been friendssharing a house, evenand I didnt even bother to find out the first thing about you.Oz was suddenly looking much more cheerful.He raised an eyebrow.Yeah?You reckon?Whats my favourite food?Chinese, from the place down the road, Giles said immediately.You like the sweet n sour pork balls and the deep fried crispy beef, but you think theyre unhealthy so half the time you order chicken chow mein and monks vegetables instead.Favourite film?My Best Friends Wedding, obviously.TV show?Being Human, or anything else with Aidan Turner in it, because you fancy him like mad.Especially when he hasnt shaved recently.Giles blinked.You know, at this rate, we could go on Mr and Mrs.Oz laughed.Exactly!Thats just what Im talking aboutwhere you come from is only one part of you.Its who you really are thats important.Thats something that wanker Hugh will never understand.You deserve more than to be some posh tossers trophy boyfriend.What?Giles stared.Me?A trophy?But Im just  Just what?Giles sighed.Short.Stupid.Snobbish.And hairier than an entire flange of gorillas.Oz laughed again, and Giles gave him a hurt look.You forgot to mention one thing.What?Youre also a bit of a berk sometimes.Okay, youre not the tallest bloke around, but youre gorgeous, and if you hadnt been brainwashed by that prick Hugh youd know it.Giles found he was blinking rapidly.You think Im gorgeous?Really?Course I do.And youre funnyall right, not always intentionallyand you really care about people, despite having spent the last couple of years in extremely bad company.I do?Giles hadnt meant to say that out loud.Yes.You do.Oz hesitated, then stretched his hand across the table to cover Giless.Some of us were sort of hoping you might care about us in particular.They were?I mean, you were?Still tussling with the third/second person problem, Giless brain finally caught up to the import of what Oz had said.You mean  Yeah.Look, I know youre on the rebound from Hugh, and Im not quite who you thought I was, but maybe, in a couple of months, if youre ready  Oz broke off abruptly as Giles launched himself across the table to silence his friend with a clumsy yet enthusiastic kiss.Im ready, he said fervently.Sure?Because  Feeling, in the circumstances, that actions spoke louder than words, Giles locked their lips together once more, and enthusiastically set about showing Oz just how very ready he was.So what if they were a couple of chavs by birth?Giles knew good breeding when he saw it.Or at least, he would do, just as soon as their hangovers wore off.
