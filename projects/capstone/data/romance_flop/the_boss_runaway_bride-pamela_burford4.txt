He probably found her appealingly spineless.Which wasnt a fair assessment of Molly.Quinn didnt think of her as spineless so much as serene.There was something to be said for not letting things get to you.He wondered how shed react in a crisis.And what did his analysis say about Phil?Or rather, about his opinion of Phil?Hed be kidding himself if he said he actually liked the guy, and Quinn wasnt one to kid himself.But he didnt have to be pals with a man to respect him in business, to admire him even.The bottom line was, something told Quinn that his former boss would appreciate a woman like Molly.More perplexing was what shed seen in Phil.Quinn wanted to ask her but didnt dare.How could he demand that his housemate respect his privacy if he didnt respect hers?She asked, Did my chicken cutlets survive?Afraid not.The package split open.You lost the coleslaw, too.The hot dogs are okay, though.And the potato chip bag is flat but intact.Diet chipsyou can eat just as many, but you wont get fat because they are now very, very tiny.She watched him open one last packet to clean her knee, but again she averted her eyes just before he got down to business.He found that endearing somehow.Im not up to barbecuing tonight anyway, she said.I think Ill just open a can of tuna.Carefully Quinn dabbed the blood from her knee, chagrined at the internal battle he was waging.A battle between good common sense and...what?He didnt think he wanted to know.In the end the what won out.Well, if you dont mind lobster, youre welcome to eat down here, he said, his eyes still on his task.With me.She stared at him for long, agonizing moments.Quinn, I know you dont want  Just say yes, damn it!He felt his face heat.Its not like Im some damn hermit.Her lips twitched.To her credit she refrained from saying something like Well, yeah, Quinn, it is like youre some damn hermit.Instead she said, Real lobster?The fake ones are hell on the nutcrackers.I havent had lobster in so long!Those chicken cutlets were my big splurge for the week.You cant leave the Cape without eating a lobster, Molly.Theres some law on the books about it if Im not mistaken.He retrieved gauze pads, antibiotic ointment, and a roll of adhesive tape from the first aid kit, uncomfortable with the sudden realization that if Molly didnt say yes, he wouldnt bother getting a lobster just for himself.What did I tell you?she said, with a knowing look.Its happening already.Youre beginning to get it.Get what?You mean the whole beach bumming, sunset watching, bike riding, lobster sucking Cape Cod thing?Exactly.He peeled the paper wrapper from a gauze pad, squirted ointment on it, and gently placed it on the scraped up side of her chin.Hold that for me.She did and he taped it in position.You know, youre pretty cocky for someone angling for a free crustacean.With corn on the cob.Now she wants corn on the cob!He unwrapped another piece of gauze.And steamers.A whole bucketful.You like clams?No, but something tells me I wont want to miss a chance to watch you eat them.Lobster!Molly squealed gleefully and bounced on the bed, derailing his attempt to bandage her elbow.She gave his thigh a brisk pat.And after, we watch the sunset.The whole sunset.Four   I TELL YOU, I dont see any damn swan.Quinn frowned up at the moonless heavens.Youre trying too hard.Use your imagination.I dont have one.Molly leaned on the second floor deck railing next to Quinn, close enough to detect his warmth even through the sweatshirt shed thrown over her tank top.A long sleeved T shirt was his only concession to the brisk evening breeze that carried the scents of the bay and the field of tall grasses that stretched between the house and the beach.They stood at the front end of the deck.The weathered boards were rough on the bare soles of Mollys feet.Theyd turned off all the lights indoors, the better to see the stars.Overhead the night sky unfurled in all its majesty and mystery.She said, Dont try to focus on the image, just let it kind of gel, you know?Oh, that helps.She smiled at his sarcastic tone.Okay, you see the Milky Way, right?Sure.He swept his left arm in a long arc, tracing the paler swath of indigo.Well, right in the middle of the Milky Way, right up there she pointed is Deneb, a blue supergiant, the brightest star in the constellation Cygnus.Latin for swan.Okay, Ive got Deneb.Follow it straight down to the next star.And then out to both sides for the wings.And straight down for the body.While he stared up at the sky, she stared at him, his profile strangely elegant and compelling by starlight.She wondered if he had the remotest inkling of his own raw physical appeal, and decided he probably didnt.Shed been unprepared for the divergent feelings that had assailed her earlier when hed carried her into his bedroom, nestled against his broad bare chest.Thered been the liberating, almost childlike sensation of surrendering yourself into the hands of another, knowing youll be cared for, protectedand at the same time, the ever present, almost exhausting awareness of him.Of smooth, sinewy, sun gilded flesh.Of a deep, well modulated voice custom made for that surprising dry sense of humor.And the eyes...those dangerous eyes you couldnt look into for long because they were like rare cognac or the finest sweet liqueur, enticing you to overindulge even as you feel your little brain cells popping one by one.Molly took a deep, slow breath and forced her gaze back to the constellation.Dont even think it, she cautioned herself.Hes not interested.And even if he were, the last thing she needed was another stuffy ad executive with a hidden agenda.Okay, that wasnt fair.She didnt really know Quinn, after all.Didnt know about his agenda, hidden or otherwise, except that he was clearly a hard driven workaholic, cast from the same mold as Phil Owen.Perhaps this was some sort of fatal attraction she was doomed to repeat over and over.Carefree copy editor meets anal retentive ad man.Sparks fly.Hearts break.Give me a hint, Quinn groused.Whats this swan doing?He rubbed the back of his neck.Doing?Oh.Its flying.She turned and spread her arms in demonstration.Its a swan in flight.Squinting up at the dome of stars, he started to shake his head, and froze.He blinked.I see it.I think I see it!He spread his arms, too, and Molly thought how absurd the two of them must look, if anyone could see them, standing on the deck readying for takeoff.She placed a friendly hand on Quinns back and felt the landscape of muscles shift under her palm as he lowered his arms.And you say you dont have an imagination, she chided.Oh, sometimes I do.His silky little smile steered her own overactive imagination into treacherous waters.She dropped her hand.Whats your sign?What, my zodiac sign?Dont tell me youre into all that.I like to keep an open mind, she said, but thats not why I asked.Maybe we can find your constellation.Its Cancer.Cancer.The Crab.Hey, your birthdays around now!When is it?Did it pass yet?He grinned.Not telling, huh?Well, I always enjoy a challenge.She looked up.Unfortunately, we cant see the Crab in the summer.Have to wait until the fall and winter.Im Taurus.We cant see the Bull tonight either.He cocked his head.The Bull, huh?She leaned back against the railing, not meeting his eyes.I know what youre thinking.It fits.The way I bulled my way uninvited into your, you know, personal space and all.After a moment he said quietly, I dont think of it that way.Why had she brought this up?Youre sweet to say so, Quinn, but its all right.I know my personality can be a bit...overwhelming.He braced his palm on the railing right next to her.Now, see, I wouldnt have put it like that.I wouldve said friendly.Openhearted.A lopsided smile sprang to her lips despite her chagrin.Openhearted.I like that one.Was it her imagination or did he edge closer?His scrumptious masculine scent invaded her nostrils, making her a little dizzy.Outgoing yet serene, he continued.Unflappable.Imperturbable.You can stop now.Insouciant.What?He laughed, the sound rich and warm and wonderfully spontaneous, and she realized it was the first time shed heard him laugh.She was more than a little pleased to be the cause of it, even if he was having fun at her expense.She said, Ive never been accused of insouciance before, and punched his chest in mock annoyance.He seized her wrist, surprising her with his speed and the leashed power she sensed beneath his gentle grip.His smile spread, his teeth gleaming in the dark, and now he was right there, standing over her, his breath stirring her hair, and she couldnt breathe, couldnt think because his nearness was crowding every blessed thought out of her head.You know, that was fun, he murmured, watching you eat those steamers.I, um...She cleared her throat.I know I was a little messy.Now, see, I wouldve said provocative.His thumb traced circles on the inside of her wrist, and she shivered.A nervous chuckle escaped her.You say tomato, I say tomahto.Slowly he brought her wrist up and pressed his lips to it, to the tender, tingling skin hed just stroked.The stunning sensation rocketed along every nerve in her body.Molly gripped the railing hard with her other hand.He said, Thank you for letting me watch you eat steamers.Thank you for making me watch the sunset.Thank you for showing me the swan.Her voice was a ragged whisper.Thank you for fixing my boo boos and buying me a two pound lobster.His black hair blended into the shadows, making his star dusted face appear to float above her.My pleasure, he said, and as she watched, his smile gradually faded.She sensed his natural reserve reasserting itself.Hes remembering, she thought.Remembering who I am and what I did.Remembering how it felt to sit in a church pew waiting for a wedding that wasnt meant to be.He dropped her hand and stepped away.Molly couldnt bear to hear him say it, so she said it herself.Its getting late.I guess its time to say good night.*  SHES BAKING, Quinn thought, closing the front door behind him and unlocking his part of the house.As always, the door at the top of the stairs stood wide open and the ambrosial scent of something hot and sweet curled down the stairwell and tweaked his salivary glands.It was close to nine, nearly dark, and hed just returned from an excursion into town to pick up a couple of magazines and a quart of butter pecan ice cream.Hed had little interaction with Molly during the five days since hed fed her lobster and discovered a swan in the heavens, but neither had he gone to great lengths to avoid her as he had those first few days.Nevertheless, while his initial standoffishness had softened somewhat, a barrier stood between them, as insurmountable as the Berlin Wall before German unification  This ladys past history spoke for itself.No amount of sugarcoating was going to put a palatable spin on what shed done to Phil.The man under whose roof Quinn now dwelled.The man who boasted tremendous influence in Quinns chosen profession.Quinn had accepted Phils offer of the house in part as a goodwill gesture, ever mindful of the folly of burning ones bridges.One never knew when someone from ones past might be in a position to help, or hinder, ones career.In Quinns weaker moments, when he allowed himself to envision a sexy summer romp with his ex bosss tantalizing ex fiance, images of a long vine and bamboo footbridge leaped to mind, awash in flames, breaking up in great blazing chunks and dropping into the fathomless depths of a mist shrouded gorge far, far below.One thing hed say for Molly, shed given his long dormant imagination a good kick in the butt.He knew she sensed his continued aloofness.He saw it in the way she waited for him to initiate a conversation, and how quick she was to end one, as if careful not to overstay her welcome.A few days earlier hed been relieved when shed respected his desire to be left alone.Now all he felt was a sharp jab of shame.Quinn had made his opinion of Molly excruciatingly clear.Hed condemned her actionsand by extension, her characterto her face.His lingering reticence had to be painfully eloquent in her eyes.Its not just that, he wanted to tell her.Its my career, its that bamboo footbridge Ive spent eight long years building.I cant jeopardize all that by...By what?By being civil to her?There was a world of difference between treating someone like a pariah and asking her to have your baby.Maybe he ought to try for a middle ground.Maybe he should have done that from the beginning.Quinn made a beeline for the kitchen, tossing the magazines on the coffee table without breaking stride.He set the sack from the ice cream shop on the counter and jumped at the sound of a knock at his door.It could only be one person.She stood in his doorway wearing an incandescent smile and a short India print sundress with skinny little shoulder straps.The scrapes from her bicycle accident had scabbed over nicely but still looked like something out of a horror film.It took him a moment to register what she held in her hands.Happy birthday!she shouted.It walloped him like a two by four and all he could do was stand there staring stupidly at the chocolate birthday cake.Melting wax dripped down lit candles shaped like the numbers 3 and 0.After a few moments Mollys smile began to falter.Quinn swallowed hard.He tried to force this remarkable event into some compartment of his brain that would recognize it.Categorize it.It refused to fit.Um, can I come in?she asked.I just wanted to, you know, drop this off.You made me a cake.Was that his voice, so flat?Why did you do this?Quinn watched dismay chase the last vestiges of her smile, jerking him out of his stupor at last.I mean His voice cracked.Molly.
