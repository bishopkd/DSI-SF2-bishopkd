Sipping the freshly brewed coffee both warmed my body and replenished my energy.The aroma of the cafe bakery drifted outside while the sounds of Main Street came alive with the daily routine of the quaint village.The bakery inspired me with an idea.I would surprise Cassandra later by baking a batch of chocolate chip cookies.The town hall down the street rang nine o' clock.I left the cafe and walked down the Main Street to the library.There was a sense of dread in the pit of my stomach at what I would find there.Inside the library, I first returned my novel and then went to the archives to look for the newspaper.It was a local press called The Vale.It took me some time to locate the correct edition.And it was just as the man in the churchyard predicted.A large story splashed across the front page.It was November 11th, the day after my sister's death.The only photograph pictured in the article was of the cliffs overlooking the bay.The headline was The Edge of Eternity.I sat down and began to read."Late in the afternoon of November 10th, a man and woman fell to their death on the shores of Eternity Bay.There were no witnesses to the incident.However, local gossip presumes their leap to be a suicide pact between Adriana Hathaway and Jordan Harmon. "My heart performed its own leap!So they had died together last week.If only there was a photo to confirm his identity.I glanced at my watch; it was now 9:30.The viewing at the Maryvale Congregational Church would be in just two hours.I continued reading the article, and there was mention of Leah Hathaway and Jordan's father, Charles Harmon.I would probably see the father at the church later, and any other family and friends of the deceased.This was utterly insane like a dream, or perhaps a nightmare.Was it possible to meet a man who was in love with my sister?Not to mention, a man who had already been dead for one week.I shivered at the thought and what it could possibly mean.Then I remembered the first time I saw him on the beach.He had said to me, 'I've been waiting for you!'Waiting for whom?He must have thought I was Adriana.Just like the man in the car yesterday, he must have initially mistaken me for my twin.That would also account for how he knew about my sea shell collection back home.Adriana must have confided to Jordan about me.I shook my head in amazement.This had to be the same man who loved my sister.Otherwise how else could he have come by that information?Well, in a very short time, I would come face to face with the dead man himself.And then I would know the truth  I placed the newspaper back on the shelf and left the library and took a different route to the church, a path that would prolong the passage of time.A couple of shops were open so I walked in and looked around.I tried on some dresses and checked out my reflection in the mirror.One particular black outfit seemed appropriate, so I purchased it and put it on over my clothes before leaving.Now I would definitely blend in at the funeral.My watch confirmed it was already after eleven, so I headed in the direction of Ellstrom Lane.There was a school for the blind on the corner, with a tailor shop next door, and directly across the street was the church.Prickles of goose bumps broke out on my arms as I attempted to stroll casually through the churchyard gate.There were mourners attired in black, gathering at the front door of the vestibule.I carefully maneuvered around a couple who were signing the guest book inside.There was a group at the front of the church paying their respects.My heart sank and my legs were weak, as I urged myself forward towards the casket.It was a rich dark mahogany, laced with satin.As the people went back to their seats, I glimpsed his face.A face so familiar, it took my breath away.It was Jordan!The same man I had met on the beach and spoken with the past few days, the man who had loved my twin.Created in the image of my sister, could I have brought him back?Was his love for her so eternal, that it could resurrect him from the dead?Feeling weak and faint, I reached for the handle on the side of the casket for support.He was beautiful in the sweet repose of death, even after such a tragic fall.How I longed to see his eyes once more, those eyes that loved me.His wavy hair had been tamed by the hands of a mortician.He appeared to be asleep, with his hands folded casually, hands that once held me.Tears began to blur my vision.Gently, I placed my hand on his and wept.But as I touched him, a strong vision appeared in my mind.I saw Jordan standing on the cliff with Sebastian and my sister.Sebastian was arguing with Jordan because he was secretly seeing his wife.During the fight, Jordan tripped and fell over the edge.Adriana reached out to catch him but also fell from the cliff.That explained what really happened.It was an accident, not a murder, not a suicide pact.My previous vision revealed that Sebastian had learned the truth from my sister's journal.That must have led to the confrontation on the cliff.Organ music began to play, so I departed from my beloved to take a seat.Voices whispered from the front row.Sounding agitated, a man asked,  "Well, where is his brother, Trent?We postponed the funeral so he could be here. "The other man shook his head."I haven't been able to reach my son. "The latter voice must have been Jordan's father, Charles Harmon.He apparently was addressing the other man about the absence of another son.At this point, the man from the caretaker's cottage came to the front and addressed the congregation."I have been asked by the father of the deceased to read a portion of a poem by Lewis Carroll titled "Dreamland".He looked down at the podium and began reading.When midnight mists are creeping,  And all the land is sleeping,  Around me tread the mighty dead,  And slowly pass away.The blaze of noonday splendor,  The twilight soft and tender,  May charm the eye: yet they shall die,  Shall die and pass away.I see the shadows falling,  The forms of old recalling;  Around me tread the mighty dead,  And slowly pass away.The man looked up, then cleared his throat and asked for the ushers to come forward.They closed the casket and he was silently borne away to the churchyard.I followed discreetly at a distance and watched the pastor pray an appropriate psalm.Unlike most funerals I had seen or read about, the sun burned with a brilliant irony.It was indeed a "blaze of noonday" as the poem predicted; a crisp autumn afternoon.After the ceremony concluded, I hailed a cab and returned to Hathaway Hall.I prepared a batch of chocolate chip cookies in the kitchen.And while they baked I spent time reading with Cassandra.She was quite surprised when I brought her the plate of fresh pastries.As she surrendered herself to the desert, I quietly excused myself, withdrawing to my bedroom.Outside the window, the sun had begun to set on the horizon.Would Jordan be there again tonight?The past week had seemed like the dreamland from that poem...Around me tread the mighty dead.Phantoms that only appeared when the world was fast asleep and cloaked by midnight shadows.I thought about the two visions I had experienced when I touched him.The first one revealed us locked in an embrace on the cliffs, and the other making love upon the shore.And for the first time, I began to realize that they were not visions of the future, but of the past.I had seen Jordan with my sister in those visions.It troubled me that I did not have a future with him, but neither did Adriana.When I had asked him if we were lovers, he had answered, "There's a part of you and I that are joined forever. "He also told me, a part of our souls met long before my arrival.I thought about the connection that I shared with my twin and how inseparable ours souls were.I experienced many of her intimate thoughts and feelings.So in some spiritual way, I was already joined to Jordan through Adrianas communion with him.That explained the connection we shared.He had quoted the proverb, "When one shuts one eye, one does not hear everything. "Together, Adriana and I were like a pair of eyes.When she died, it was like one eye being shut, and whatever I saw or heard, she could no longer perceive.I remembered his words, "When I look at you now, I can see yesterday again. "Being a mirror reflection of Adriana, I had resurrected his love for her.But did Jordan want me to continue on where her own life had ended?The thought sent a chill up my spine.But did he really see me for who I was, or was it only because I reminded him of my twin?Perhaps he never really loved me at all.The thought filled me with loss and despair.I had deluded myself into thinking he cared for me.It was only her, always Adriana that he loved.I should have realized that the moment I read my sister's journal.I wiped the tears from my eyes and lay upon my bed.I was filled with a horrible feeling of emptiness.I had honestly believed that he had loved me.But like the sun fading in the west, the light of his love dimmed and my world grew dark with shadows.I turned towards the window and watched as the sun slowly extinguished itself into the sea.It was a twilight world of dead lovers and broken dreams.I waited there expectantly.Would he come?Could he come?But only the night came.Except for a few stray stars, the heavens were the shade of midnight.I paced as my mind spun questions into theories, and theories into more questions.I returned to the window and looked out into the night, to a lonely stretch of beach in the moonlight.But there was nobody there, nobody waiting for me, no one at all.Tears filled my eyes again, and a cry escaped my lips.Just when I thought the loneliness would never end, I felt his arms around me.I looked down and saw his hands clasp together holding me.Then a voice behind me whispered in my ear,  Laura, please don't cry.
