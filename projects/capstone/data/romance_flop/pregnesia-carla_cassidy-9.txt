Wendall answered on the second ring.Wendall, its Lucas.I need your help.Whats up?Can you meet me in fifteen minutes in front of the Church of Enlightenment?Wendall must have heard the thrum of urgency in Lucass voice, for he didnt ask any questions.Ill be there.And Wendall, could you bring a couple of officers with you?There was a momentary pause.Are you in danger?No, but I think somebody else is, Lucas replied.On my way.Lucas dropped his cell phone on the seat next to him and backed away from the security gate.Instead he pulled to park in front of the church, his heart pounding with a nauseating intensity.Why was she here?It didnt make sense.He glanced at his watch.He felt as if each minute that passed was an hour as he waited for reinforcements to arrive.What he wanted was to talk to Julie, to assure himself that she was okay.Hed like to storm the fence, either ram his car through it or climb over it.But he knew that if he was arrested for destruction of personal property or trespassing, he wouldnt be any help at all to Julie.If she needs help, he reminded himself.He supposed it was possible the Montgomerys had brought her here to visit a friend, or to worship before taking her home.He tried to convince himself that those scenarios were possible, but he remained unconvinced.Once again he checked his watch.God, could the minutes move any slower?With nervous energy screaming through him, he unfastened his coat and placed a hand on the butt of his gun.Hed kill for her.The thought shocked him.As a navy SEAL hed killed before, but that had been war, cases of kill or be killed.It wasnt something hed enjoyed, nor had he ever expected to do it again in civilian life.But for Julie and her unborn son, hed do whatever it took to protect her, even if it meant killing again.He breathed a sigh of relief as a patrol car pulled in beside him and Wendall got out.Wendall Kincaid was good looking, dark haired and the youngest and most popular chief of police in Kansas Citys history.Although he frowned on some of Recovery Inc.s methods, hed become a friend to all three of the men.What have we got?he asked.As Lucas began to fill him in on what was going on, he saw a frown etched deeper and deeper into Wendalls forehead.What do you want from me, Lucas?Wendall asked when Lucas was finished explaining everything.Julie is a consenting adult and she went willingly with these relatives of hers.There isnt much I can do about that.But they told me they were taking her home, he protested.Wendall shrugged.So they had a change of plans.No crime has occurred here.Lucas grabbed Wendall by the shoulder.Maybe not yet, but Im telling you this isnt right.Julie would never have willingly come here.Just check it out.Make them bring her out here to talk to me.If she tells me this is where she wants to be, then Ill walk away and not bother her, not bother you again.Wendall frowned once again.Lets go check it out, he said.Lucas dropped his hand from Wendalls shoulder and breathed a sigh of relief.Thanks, man.I wont forget this.Minutes later Lucas, Wendall and Officer Ben Branigan approached the locked gate.It was Wendall who found a buzzer that Lucas hadnt noticed before.He rang it and a moment later a mans voice replied.This is private property, please state your business.This is Chief of Police Wendall Kincaid.Id like to speak with Robert Montgomery, Wendall said in a voice that rang with his authority.Lucass chest was filled with such a cold, hard knot that he found breathing difficult.He told himself to relax, but it wasnt happening, wouldnt happen until he knew with a gut certainty that Julie was okay.The resulting silence seemed to last a lifetime, but finally Roberts deep, familiar voice boomed out of the hidden speaker.What can I do for you?I want to talk to Julie, Lucas shouted over Wendalls shoulder.Im afraid, Mr.Washington, that Julie doesnt wish to speak with you, Robert replied smoothly.I really must insist that we see Julie, Wendall said.Once again his words were met with a long silence.Lucas could feel his heartbeat not only in his chest, but banging at his temples.Was it possible that she didnt want to see him?That hed hurt her by sending her off where she was supposed to belong, even though hurting her was the last thing hed wanted to happen?Theres nothing wrong with Julie except that shes stressed and wants some peace and quiet.I see you have an officer with you, Robert said.Ill allow him to come in and speak with Julie.Perhaps he can convince her to come out and talk to you, but I wont force her to do anything she doesnt want to do.Wendall looked at Lucas, who in turn looked at Officer Branigan.He shrugged.Ill go in and talk to her, he said.I dont have a problem with it.Okay, Wendall said into the speaker.Officer Branigan will come in and speak with Julie.Minutes later a tall, burly man approached the gate from the inside.He offered them a friendly smile, as if it was business as usual to have the chief of police standing at the gate.Officer Branigan?You can come on in.He opened the gate and allowed the cop inside, then closed and locked the gate once again.Branigan turned and offered Wendall and Lucas a thumbs up signal.Lucas tried to tell himself that surely if anything was wrong the people inside wouldnt want an armed cop in their midst.Lucas looked at Wendall, Dont you think its damned suspicious that they wouldnt let us in?Maybe, Wendall agreed.But I have no jurisdiction to just barge in.At least they allowed an officer in to speak with him.Still, Lucas couldnt get rid of the feeling that Julie was in some kind of terrible danger and needed his help.JULIE SAT ON THE EDGE of the bed in an attractive bedroom with an adjoining bath.Under other circumstances she might have appreciated the fine mahogany furniture and the beautiful tapestries that hung on the walls.But as beautiful as the bedroom was, it was nothing more than her prison.And it had been her prison for a month before Lucas had found her shivering in the back of that car.She remembered everything now, her marriage to David, his unexpected death and the fact that her brother and sister in law were monsters.Robert was the prophet, the father figure behind the curtain who preached in anonymity on Sundays to a congregation who desperately wanted to believe in something different than what traditional religion offered.More than anything, she remembered that they wanted her baby.She wrapped her arms around her belly and looked around the room for the hundredth time since being locked inside.The room was located on the third floor.Although there were two windows, there was no way she could chance jumping.She would probably kill herself.But more importantly she could hurt her baby.There was nothing to use as a weapon, no way for her to fight the people who held her captive.She squeezed her eyes closed tightly against the tears that threatened to fall.She refused to cry and she refused to think about Lucas, knowing if she did she would start crying and never stop.Her husband, David, was dead.That much had been true.Hed been the victim of a mugger who had stabbed him to death.And Robert and Martha had taken her into their home days after the funeral.Over the next couple of months, things had been going okay.Robert and Martha had embraced her and her unborn child with love and supportor so shed thought.David had told her when theyd married that Robert couldnt have children of his own, that a childhood illness had left him sterile.Both Martha and Robert had seemed to have made peace with the fact that they would never have children.It had been at the beginning of her seventh month of pregnancy that everything had changed.Shed started talking to Martha about the possibility of moving to a new town.Maybe in another state after the baby was born.She wanted a fresh start.Shed been brought here and held prisoner.Robert had told her his plan for her and her child.She jumped to her feet as the door opened and Robert walked in, along with a uniformed police officer.The sight of the officer should have produced a sense of relief in her, but instead it stirred a new fear.Shed seen him before.Here, in her prison.He was a member of Roberts wicked board, a man seeking wealth and power and definitely not on the side of law and order.We have a little problem, Robert said.It seems your boyfriend has brought the chief of police to check on your welfare.Lucas was here?Oh, thank God, hed come for her.Her heart swelled with hope.Just let me go, Robert.I wont say anything to anyone.I wont press any charges against you.Just let me go and youll never hear from me again.Robert smiled at her indulgently.Ive worked too hard, too long to do that, Julie.The child you carry will be mine.He will herald in a new world for the Church of Enlightenment.He will be the new Prophet and offer hope to all.Why dont you tell the truth, Robert?she said angrily.This isnt about the church and hope.Its about money and power.Roberts smile grew.There is that, he agreed.Its amazing how much money people will cough up if they think it means their salvation.For the new prophet theyll give up their property, their retirement funds.Well build our own little community here with people working for the church and well all get wealthy.Right, Ben?The police officer nodded.Cant get wealthy working for the man, he replied.Youll burn in hell, Julie exclaimed.Perhaps, Robert agreed easily.But what a life Im planning before I die.The best of everything for the new prophets father on earth.His smile fell and his blue eyes grew icy.But before any of this can happen we have the little problem of your Romeo and his friend at our gates.I have a feeling they arent going away until they see that shes okay in person, Ben said.She needs to tell them everything is all right.And Im not about to do that, Julie replied fervently.Lucas, her heart cried.Please save me from this nightmare.I think you will, Robert countered confidently.I think youre going to go down to the gate and tell them that you have all your memories back and this is where you want to be.And why would I do that?she demanded.Robert reached into his pocket and pulled out a photo and held it out to her.Reluctantly she took it from him and gasped in alarm.It was a picture of Loretta, taken as she was entering the hospital where she worked.We can get her anywhere, anytime we want.Same with your boyfriend.Neither of them will know who to fear.Theyll never see us coming.If you dont cooperate with us, Loretta Washington is a dead woman.And after we kill her, well get Lucas.We would have taken you sooner from Lorettas apartment, but as we made our plans, you disappeared.Besides, its much better this way.We dont need any police problems.A dull roar resounded in Julies head.She believed him.She believed every word he said.They would find Loretta and they would kill her, and eventually theyd get to Lucas, too.She held both Lorettas and Lucass lives in her hands and there was no way she could sacrifice them for herself.They had both been so kind to her, a stranger in need and she wouldnt reward their kindness by placing them at risk.All right, she finally said, then grimaced.Ill do whatever you tell me to do, just leave them alone.Robert took the picture of Loretta from her and tucked it back in his shirt pocket.I thought youd see things my way.He grabbed her by the arm, making her skin crawl with his touch.Just keep in mind, if you screw up, youre putting a bullet in their heads.Make this problem go away, Julie.As he led her out of the room, Julies heartbeat was a dull throb in her chest.There would be no magical rescue for her.She was going to have her baby here and she had no doubt that Robert would see to it that she didnt survive the birth.As they walked down the long hallway that led to the stairs, she remembered the hall from her nightmares.Shed run this way on the night shed escaped.As she slowly walked between Robert and Ben, she remembered that night.Shed been told of Roberts plot for her baby, and when Gemma Walker, the old woman who brought her meals, had come in to serve her dinner that night, shed shoved past her.Gemma had hit her on the head with the serving tray, resulting in the wound on her forehead, but Julie had managed to slip by her.That night shed gotten out of the house, and through some amazing good luck had found the security gate unlocked.She wouldnt get a chance for escape again.They reached the front door of the house, but before they walked outside Robert provided a coat for her and himself.It didnt matter to her whether she wore a coat out into the cold afternoon or not.No cotton or nylon fabric could warm the icy core inside her.As they left the house and walked across the long expanse of concrete toward the security gate, Robert squeezed her arm.Its in everyones best interest for you to look happy.She gave an imperceptible nod.He didnt have to tell her what needed to be done, she knew.Still, the minute she saw Lucas at the gate, it took every ounce of her self control to keep herself from crying out for him, to keep from launching herself over the gate and into his arms.Instead, as Robert released his hold on her arm she summoned all the inner strength she could find to get through the next few minutes.Julie.Lucass voice was filled with raw concern as he took a step toward her.The tall, dark haired man standing beside him held him back.Julie, Im Chief of Police Wendall Kincaid, he said.Lucas here seems to think youre in some sort of trouble.Her heart was a sick thud in her chest as she pasted on a bright smile.In trouble?She looked at Lucas.No, Im not in trouble.In fact, everything is better than its been in days.Lucas, Ive got my memories back.It was amazing.The minute we pulled through the gates here, they all came tumbling back to me.Lucass eyes were filled with doubt as he stared at her intently.And you want to be here?Im safe here, Lucas, she replied, relieved that her voice didnt tremble, didnt waver, but sounded strong and normal.Martha and Robert brought me here to keep me safe from the men who are after me because of Davids debts.Really, Mr.Washington, youre looking for drama where there is none, Robert said smoothly.Lucas, I really appreciate everything you did for me, Julie said.But Im fine now.She hoped the smile that curved her lips didnt look as plastic as it felt.Wendall looked at Lucas, who still stared at her with an intensity that made her heart ache.And this is where you want to be?Lucas asked.Absolutely, she replied; then she reached a hand up and deliberately tugged on the end of her hair.Are we done here?Robert asked with a touch of impatience.Its cold and Julie is weary.He placed an arm around her shoulder and she fought the shiver of revulsion that tried to take hold of her at his touch.I guess were done, Lucas said flatly.Sorry to bother you all.Julie, I hope things go well for you.He turned and headed back to his car, followed by Wendall and Ben.You did very well, my dear, Robert said as he guided her back toward the house.Julie barely heard him as she felt the last of her hope flutter away.Shed tried to tell Lucas that she was lying by the tug of her hair, but obviously he hadnt gotten it.She glanced backward just before she went back into the house and saw Lucass car driving away.It was over, done, and she was helpless to fight Robert and his minions.She hadnt been able to save herself, but at least shed saved Lucas and his sister.Still, as Robert led her back up the stairs to her room, she began to weep for Lucas, for her baby and for herself.Pregnesia Chapter TwelveShed lied.When she had said she was fine and where she wanted to be, shed been lying.Shed definitely pulled on the ends of her hair when shed said those words.My mother said she could always tell when I was fibbing because Id tug on the end of my hair.Julies words reverberated around and around in his head.Shed been trying to signal him, to let him know that she was in trouble.Lucas hadnt even gone half a block from the church when he pulled out his cell phone and punched in a number.Meet me at my place in fifteen minutes, he said to Micah.Whats going on?Ill tell you when you get there.And call Troy.I want him there, too.Lucas hung up, tossed the phone on the seat next to him and stepped on the gas pedal, eager to get to his apartment and plan a course of action.He knew there was no point in talking to Wendall.Julie was a consenting adult.Shed told them all that she wanted to be in the compound behind the church.Without any more evidence to the contrary, Wendalls hands would be tied.Besides, going through legal channels for help could take days, and even then hed have to convince Wendall that a pull on the hair had been a signal instead of a simple gesture.But Lucas wasnt bound by law.Hed seen all the evidence he needed to see in the simple tug of her hair.Rage balled up in his chest as he thought of Julie afraid and alone with people who meant her and her unborn baby harm.He still didnt understand what they wanted with her, why they would take her to the compound and hold her there against her will, but he didnt need a reason to go in and get her out.He also didnt know if shed lied about having her memories back or not.But it didnt matter.Nothing mattered except getting her out of that place and away from those people.Guilt ripped through him.Hed handed her over to them.Hed sent her back into danger.It was almost two in the afternoon by the time he reached his apartment.Micah and Troy were already in the parking lot awaiting his arrival.They didnt speak until they were in the apartment and then Lucas told them what had transpired at the church compound.I dont know whats going on there.I dont know why theyre holding her, but we have to get her out, he said.I know shes in danger.He thumped his chest with his fist.I feel it here.He was grateful that neither of his friends tried to dissuade him from his belief.In any case it would have been a waste of time.With or without them, Lucas intended to get Julie out.What do you have in mind?Micah asked as he leaned forward in his chair at the kitchen table.His eyes glittered with the call to war.There was nothing Micah and Troy enjoyed more than action.A covert operation, Lucas replied.We go in under the cover of night and we dont come out unless we have her with us.Micah sat back and frowned thoughtfully.What do you know about the house where shes being held?Not much.Its a three story mansion.I dont know how many people are inside.I dont know if shes being held under armed guard.Im not sure what wed be walking into.Troy smiled.Wouldnt be the first time, he replied.Ill see if I can get a copy of permits and maybe a floor plan of the place this afternoon, Micah said.And Ill do a little reconnaissance work and see if I can tell how many people might be inside and whether theyre armed or not, Troy added.Lucas nodded, gratitude swelling in his chest.Why dont we coordinate back here at seven tonight and make final plans?Troy and Micah left immediately, and Lucas paced the confines of his kitchen, his thoughts filled with Julie.It was only now that he recognized the depths of his feelings for her.He loved her.Hed never allowed himself to fall in love with any woman, but somehow Julie had gotten under his defenses, touched places in his heart that had never been touched before.He had no illusions.There was no happily ever after for them.His loving Julie didnt magically absolve him of the issues that would forever keep him a solitary man.But he wanted her safe.He wanted her healthy.And eventually he hoped shed be happy.He knew in his gut that none of those things were going to happen as long as she was in that house.He had to get her out and then he could walk away from her with no regrets.The late afternoon and early evening hours crept by with agonizing slowness.Lucas got on his computer and tried to find out everything he could about the Church of Enlightenment, seeking answers to questions he didnt even know how to pose.He did a Google search of the names of the few people he knew from the churchCharles Blankenship, Robert Montgomery, Martha Montgomery and of course, Julie.Charles Blankenship had a Web site devoted to his family with nothing inflammatory or unusual about it.He could find nothing on Robert and Martha except a special interest article in a local newspaper about Roberts gift shop.He found the article about Davids murder.It had occurred as the man had left an ATM.The case was never solved.His obituary mentioned that he was survived by his older brother, Robert, and his wife, Julie, but Lucas already knew that.All in all, the computer time was a bust and once again Lucas took to pacing the kitchen, his head whirling with crazy thoughts and emotions hed never felt before.By the time seven oclock arrived, Lucas was like a cat on a hot tin roof, filled with a nervous energy that begged to be directed into action.He changed his clothes, opting for a pair of black jeans and a long sleeved black turtleneck that would allow him to blend into the night.When Troy and Micah arrived they were dressed similarly, and they didnt come empty handed.They brought stun guns, rope and grappling hooks for rappelling.More importantly, they brought their stealth and clandestine methods and expertise as exnavy SEALs at getting in and out without detection.For the next four hours they plotted and planned.Micah had somehow gotten hold of a floor plan of the house, and they speculated in what room Julie might be held.Troy had counted eight men going in and out of the house who he thought might be armed.But why would a church owned establishment need armed guards?By midnight they were all champing at the bit, ready to take on an entire army to save one beautiful pregnant woman.It was decided that they would park their cars a mile away near the fields that served as a backyard to the home.There they would scale a tall chain link fence.They would spread out and each find a way into the house.There was no need to plan the specifics, each would do whatever necessary to gain entrance.The goal was to get in and out without encountering anyone, but if they did, they each knew how to take out a threat without making a sound.They would go in at twelve thirty and hopefully rendezvous back at the safe house with Julie in hand by one thirty.I just want to tell you both how much I appreciate this, Lucas said as they left his apartment.None of them had spoken of the fact that before the night was over there was a possibility they could be in jailor dead.Troy clapped Lucas on the back.In until the end, he said.It was what theyd said when theyd served side by side, and in that moment Lucas realized how rich his life was in having these two men as friends.They left Lucass apartment complex, each in his own vehicle, and within minutes were in position about a mile away from the compound.None of them spoke as they ran toward their objective.They scaled the fence that thankfully wasnt electrified.The minute they split apart and Troy and Micah disappeared into the darkness of the night, Lucass thoughts were solely on Julie.Was she still okay?Had they harmed her since he and Wendall had appeared at the gate to check on her welfare?So many hours had passed since then.It was possible they were already too late.He couldnt dwell on that.The idea that she might be hurtor worsewould destroy him.He moved like a shadow in the cold night, his feet skipping over the frozen earth without making a sound.Troy would head to the left side of the house, Micah to the right and Lucas would take the rear.Somehow they would get inside.It was what they were trained to do.With every step he took he saw her again and again, tugging on that golden strand of hair, her lips curved into a pleasant smile as shed lied to him and told him she was where she wanted to be.Be safe, Julie.His heart thundered the words, and it was in those moments as he ran toward the house, as his heart beat the frantic rhythm of fear, that he was struck again by the depth of his love for her.She was the woman hed want in his life if he were the man he wanted to be instead of the man he feared he was.Hopefully he could rescue her, get her to safety and then love her enough to let her go.The moon cooperated with the mission, hiding its light behind a thick layer of clouds, and as Lucas approached the dark, quiet house, his heartbeat slowed and his anxiety level dropped.He called it mission mode, when all thoughts left his head and he was filled with a cold calm.All emotion fell away, replaced by the steely determination of a soldier.There wasnt a single light on anywhere in the house that could be seen, and yet even with the hidden moon overhead there was a faint illumination.Where are you, Julie?They all had agreed that she was probably being held on the second or third floor.He reached the side of the house and looked up, but there was no clue as to which of the dozens of windows she might be behind.A faint crunch of icy grass came from the side of the house.Lucas flattened himself with his back against the building just as the dark outline of a tall, thin man came into view.A guard, Lucas quickly surmised.He walked at a leisurely pace, letting Lucas know he had no clue that their security had been breached.Still, Lucas knew his safest course of action was to take the man out.
