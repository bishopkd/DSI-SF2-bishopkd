My daughter nods her acquiescence.Shes getting restless and cranky.My heart goes out to her.Normal mothers would be taking their daughters swimming or street dancing or putting them through stage school so that they can become the next X Factor fodder.My child has to hang round a market stall in the freezing cold getting told off.When can we go home?she wants to know.Now, I think to myself, but in all honesty, I know that I mustnt give up so easily.Later, I say.First well have something to eat.Thatll make us feel better.Mind the stall while I go and queue up.I point at the takeaway food stall.Ill be right next door.Dont move.I can see you from where Ill be.I leave Petal behind our stall and go and get us two cartons of sweet and sour chicken and rice.When I return, Petal sits on the one stool we have and spoons the food gratefully into her mouth with a plastic fork.Its delicious and warms me up at least down to my knees.Beyond that, I have lost all feeling and may never get it back.Better?I ask Petal.She nods, smiling again.Then a miraculous thing happens.A young, trendy woman moves down from the vintage clothes stall that I so often frequent and works her way towards me and, more importantly, my handbags.Wow, she says as she sees them.Theyre totally gorgeous.Thanks.Would you like a sweetie?Petal says.Im not allowed one.You can have one more, I say to my child, who instantly helps herself and then offers the jar to the woman.Id love a sweet, she says, and takes one from Petal, and Id love a bag too.I nearly fall over in a dead faint.Really?She laughs.Really.She pulls her purse out of her handbag.Old, tatty.Not a patch on mine.I should ask her if shed like to wear it now and I can bin that one for her, but Im not bold enough to do so.The woman counts out the cash for me.I allow Petal to help me slide the bag into its protective cover and I hand it over.I hope you enjoy it.Im sure I will, and she swings away, oblivious to the admiring stare from the fruit and veg man.I feel like crying with joy.My daughter offers up her hand and I high five her.Daddy will be so proud of us.We made our first sale, Petal!29      It is, of course, our one and only sale of the day.All that cold, that standing around for a few pounds profit.Can I put my daughter through that every weekend?Can I put myself through it?Maybe Im not cut out for business.I just thought I could set up in business easily, making great handbags and although I didnt expect the world to fall at my feet, I thought it would all go reasonably smoothly.I hadnt quite bargained on the relentless slog for precious little reward.Im in two minds whether to cancel my stall for next week and just stay at home licking my wounds.But when I have my now weekly coffee session with Tod, he urges me on.Later, I find myself sketching out new designs, in response to my realisation that I need a larger range to offer.Then, a week after my fabulous trip to Buckingham Palace, the local papers hit the mat.Im all over them.To my delight and surprise, I even make the front page on one of them.LOCAL GIRL MEETS PRINCE is one headline.FROM FISH AND CHIPS TO THE PALACE is the other and theres a picture of me shaking hands with Prince Charles that I had no idea was taken.Tod is smiling serenely in the background.Look at Mummy!Petal cries with delight.Shes a famous lady like Cheryl Cole.Praise indeed.Olly comes and peers over my shoulder.Im impressed.So you should be, I tease.Not everyones girlfriend rubs shoulders with royalty.Great photo, he says, taking the paper to read the write up.Wish I could have been there.Theres something in his voice that I cant put my finger on  a touch of jealousy, sadness or even some resentment.This wont change me, I assure him teasingly.Ill still be the same down to earth girl you met and fell in love with.I know, he says.But he doesnt sound like he means it.Sometimes Ill have to do things without you.Yeah, he says.Ill be the stay at home husband while you get all the glamour.One event, I think.Thats all its been, one event.Olly stares up at me and frowns.Im worried that youll be up, up and away and youll forget about us.Thats ridiculous.Why on earth would I do that?The phone starts to ring as other friends start to get their papers delivered and its red hot for the rest of the day.I get dozens of emails from well wishers and my spirits lift once more.The text messages never stop.Olly brings me tea, on the hour, every hour, and something to eat for dinner.I cant even remember what.I cant even remember eating it.And I dont get time to address the strained atmosphere with him and what its really all about.I rush out of my house with a brief kiss for Olly and a bear hug for Petal, and run down the road to the town centre so that Im not late for my shift.When I reach Live and Let Fry, I see a familiar figure waiting outside.Slowing down, I try to compose myself and fail.My mentor is waiting for me and as I approach, he drops his usual cool demeanour and, instead, he picks me up and twirls me round.Woo hoo!Well done, Nell, he says breathlessly as he spins me back down to the ground.Somewhat reluctantly, it seems, he releases his tight hold on me.This is the reaction that Id hoped for from Olly.Ive been out all day, Tod explains.I didnt have a minute to call you.Fabulous coverage.You cant buy that sort of publicity.Thanks to you, I acknowledge.Im so grateful that you asked me to go to the reception with you.It turned out well, he admits.I hoped that you might get some column inches, but front page?Wow.So what now?We try to capitalise on it.Ill put some ideas together this week.He slips a bag from over his shoulder.In the meantime, you can borrow this.A laptop?At least thats what I think it is.Im sure he just doesnt mean the bag, which I have to say is a somewhat utilitarian plastic one.Perhaps I could do a range of fab laptop bags.You can put some of your products on eBay while youre waiting to start up your website.At least then youll have an internet presence.Absolutely.I dont like to tell him that Im clueless when it comes to computers.Thats great.Thanks.How did the market stall go?Er slow, I tell him, thinking thats probably all he needs to know, otherwise it will sound like Im whining.I guess it will take time.Lets hope that business picks up for you this week.I have to go, I tell him with a nod towards the shop door.Or Ill be late for my shift.I wanted to see where you worked.Come in, I offer.Id love him to see how great the shop looks and show off my work.You can have some chips on the house.He laughs.Im going out to dinner with friends.Of course.That makes me feel gauche.I didnt think.It was a nice offer, Nell, he says.Im sorry I cant stay.A shrug.Another time.All the while Im thinking how stupid it was to offer someone like Tod free chips.I could cut out my own tongue.I have no idea what Tods personal life is like.Maybe theres a pretty little blonde waiting at home.I dont know.Maybe there are several of them.Hes never mentioned anyone and, besides, its none of my business.Hes just a mentor, nothing more.Were not even friends.This is his job.Hes looked after dozens of people like me.I wonder how many other people he asked to go to the Palace with him before he got to me?I watch him walk away and when he gets to the end of the alley, he turns and waves.I puff out a sigh and head for my nights work.Swinging inside Live and Let Fry, Im greeted by a loud cheer.Jenny, Constance and Phil are all holding balloons that say Congratulations!Aw, guys!They come and hug me.Clever girl, Phil says proudly.Clever girl.I just had my photo taken with Prince Charles.I think Im blushing.Oh my word, Constance says.Was it all lovely?It was pretty impressive, I admit.We always knew you were going to be brilliant, Constance gushes.Yeah, remember us when youre rich and famous, Jenny adds.I think shes teasing, but it worries me that shes not the first person to voice that sentiment.They gave a lovely mention of Live and Let Fry, Phil says.There are carefully cut out copies of the article stuck on the newly painted wall above each table.Therell be no holding you back now.You wont be doing shifts here for much longer.I dont like to tell him that I lost money on the market stall and that Olly was kicked out of a nice little job due to my lastminute jaunt to the Palace.They all have such faith in my abilities that I want them to believe that everything is wonderful.And, as everything is resting on this, I want to believe it myself.30      The next morning, Petal and I are curled up in bed together.My daughter has been wriggling since the break of dawn and Im hugging her close to me, which I hope she interprets as a sign of maternal love, when all Im really trying to do is keep her still.I hear the front door close quietly and the sound of Olly tiptoeing into the kitchen as he comes back from his night shift.Reaching for my phone, I text him: We R awake!He texts back, T?xx  To which he receives a row of kisses in return.As we live in a terraced house and were trying to encourage Petal not to shout, Olly and I spend a lot of time texting each other even though were often in the next room.Moments later he comes up the stairs and I rouse myself enough to take the mug of tea from him.Hi, he says as he sits down next to me and kisses me.Good night?Not that youd notice, Olly says.Sitting at a conveyor belt for eight hours putting mushrooms and peppers on pizza isnt the most exciting way to spend a night.He raises his eye brows at me.I can think of better ways.I would like to spend a night eating candyfloss, Petal pipes up.Id like you to spend a night in your own bed, I add.You, young lady, can go and get your breakfast, Olly says.She pulls a face.You make it for me, Daddy.I have.Its all set out on the table.Ive poured your juice, and your cereal is already waiting in the bowl.All you have to do is put milk on it.OK.She bounces out of the bed and I spread out into my rightful space.Ah, bliss.I heard that, Mummy, my child says.Pour the milk carefully, Olly advises.Make sure it doesnt go via the floor.What does via mean?It means that the milk goes into the bowl, not on the floor or the table.Im not a baby, she tuts before disappearing out of the door.Remind me, I say, why are we thinking of having another one?We are?Olly queries as he lies down beside me.Chance would be a fine thing.If youre very quick and very quiet, we could make a start now.I try to look seductive even though I probably have a severe case of bed head.He shakes his head.Too tired, he says, which is unusual as Olly tries never to miss an opportunity because were never quite sure when our next one might be.Besides, he continues, Ive got something Id like to ask you.Oh.I hope hes not going to grill me about my relationship with Tod.I dont want to start this fine and unsullied morning with an argument.Olly rolls onto his tum and stares up at me.I cant read the expression on his face.He takes my hands in his.Nell McNamara, he says, would you do me the very great honour of marrying me?Its a good job that Im not drinking my tea, otherwise I would spit it out.Marry you?I cant stop myself from blinking.Just like that?It cant be so much of a surprise.Olly, weve been together for ten years and youve never really mentioned it before.Well, he says, weve always been OK as we are before.And were not now?He shrugs.I just thought the time was right.I dont know why I suddenly feel so nervous.Ive known Olly for ever.We were little more than children when we started going out together.I always hoped this day would come.Perhaps its just that being together for so long has taken the edge off the excitement.Or maybe if Olly had whisked me away to Paris for the weekend to propose it would feel more special.But in our own bed when Im barely awake?Its just so out of the blue and why now?What do you reckon?Olly, while Im musing, is waiting patiently for my answer.Yes, I say.Of course.He comes and snuggles up next to me, taking me in his arms.Good.He kisses me in a long and leisurely fashion and, finally, the excitement starts to rise in me.Right on cue, Petal appears in the doorway.My child is the best contraception known to man.Ive finished my breakfast.Come here, Petalmeister, Olly says, clearly feeling much more charitable than me.How do you fancy being a flower girl?A flower girl?She climbs onto the bed.Whats that?Mummy and Daddy are going to get married.You get to be the most important person on the day because you carry the flowers for us.Yay!she shouts and bounces up and down excitedly.Yay!Olly holds her hands as she jumps and they both chuckle with delight.Yay!Yay!I echo, but the bouncing up and down feeling doesnt quite come.31      After my shift at Live and Let Fry, I sit having a cup of tea with Phil, Jenny and Constance.The sign on the door reads closed and we all heaved a sigh of relief after the lunchtime rush.The steady stream of customers beating a path to Phils door after the makeover looks like it has no intention of returning to a trickle.Youve been quiet today, Nell, love, Constance notes.Everything OK?Yeah.I nurse my tea.Tired?I smile at my friend.Always.But this is something more?All is well in the world of big business, isnt it?Phil looks anxious.Its fine, I assure them.More than fine.One of the contacts I met at Buckingham Palace asked me to send her a sample handbag.I sent her the Fish & Chips one.I can only sit and hope that Della Jewel likes it.In the meantime, every spare moment this week has been spent making up my new designs.Im particularly pleased with one that says Ms on one side and Mrs on the other, and is trimmed with lace.Perhaps that should have been an omen for what was about to come?I wonder if it was seeing them laying around that put the idea into Ollys head.Tod told me that shes really well connected, so keep your fingers crossed for me.I take a deep breath and they all wait.I muster a smile.Oh, and Olly has asked me to marry him.Oh, love, Constance says, her face breaking into a wide grin, thats marvellous.Lucky bitch, Jenny says.I flinch inside at the hard edge to Jennys voice.Its unlike her.Jen!Constance admonishes.Well, Jen tuts, she is.But I dont have time to dwell on it as Phil pumps my hand heartily.Congratulations, Nell.He crushes my fingers.Congratulations.Constance studies me.So why the sad face?I dont know, I admit.Jen frowns.You have said yes?Yes.Of course, I have.Its just that  Im at a loss for words.Exactly what is my problem?Is it the timing of this thats all wrong?I want all my attention focused on building my business, but perhaps thats what Olly is worried about.Is this his idea of a distraction?Does he think that this is a way of pinning me down?Olly says that hes enthusiastic about my fledgling business, but is he really?Is it some sort of threat to his manhood that I want to be the high flyer?Does he think that by marrying me, Ill be content to go back to being the little woman at home again?Its a big step, Constance says, but youve already got a child together, Nell.Theres no bigger commitment than that.I know.Petal loves that were getting married.Shed already started to ask why we werent.We gave her Ollys surname  Meyers  and its sometimes complicated that I have a different name to her.The practicalities of getting married far outweigh the reasons not to.Its just a piece of paper, Jen adds with an attempt at a careless shrug.But its a piece of paper that I know Jen desperately wants  so much more than I do, it seems.Im being silly.I shake my concerns away.Itll be wonderful.If Olly is worried about business changing the status quo, Im worried that marriage will do the same thing.Wed better all be invited, Jen says.Id love to get a new hat.Constance pats her hair.Ive got a suit that never gets an airing these days, Phil adds.Get the kettle on again, Phil, Jen says.We need a toast.Righto.Off Phil goes.Have you set a date yet?Soon, I tell Constance.Now that weve finally decided, Olly says theres no point in waiting.It is your decision, too, Constance points out.I know.And I am happy.Really, I am.God, Jenny mutters, listen to her.Youd think shed been asked to a funeral, not a wedding!Ill have him if youre not interested.But I am interested.I dont know why Im being like this.It will all be fine.Absolutely fine.32      When I do my stint the next Saturday at Hitchin market, the sun shines.The handbags sell like hot cakes.I thank my lucky stars for the coverage in the local paper, which is clearly what has brought the punters to my door  or to my stall, in this case.Petal and I work flat out all day and it makes me smile when I listen to my daughter who is, one day into being a market traders daughter, already developing her own line of patter and charming the customers.After last weeks let down, I only brought twenty handbags with me  all I could carry single handedly.Olly has a casual driving job today for a friend, so hes tied up.As well as the Fish & Chips style and the Eat Me/Drink Me bags, I tried out two more designs.The Ms & Mrs bag for brides was a big hit.So was the one with nothing but big red lips on it.By lunchtime they had all gone.Every single one.What a difference a day makes!Counting out the money, Im surprised by how much weve taken.By any account, thats a handsome profit for the day.Next week, Ill bring much more stock  assuming that I can split myself in two in order to find the time to make it.Flushed with success, I give myself and Petal the rest of the day off.From my takings, I treat her to a pretty hot pink scrunchy from the haberdashery stall as a thank you for being a good girl.While Im there, I pick up a few buttons and bits, determined to try out some more designs.Ill spend the rest of the afternoon making handbags and having a go at putting up a page on eBay now that Ive got a laptop on loan from Tod.But before I do all that, I buy piping hot pasties from the bakery stall for me and for Petal.We take them and sit at our favourite spot by the edge of the market on the steps that overlook the duck pond and St Marys Church.We sit quietly together amid the hopeful ducks and Petal stifles a yawn, too tired today to chase after them.Theres probably some law against having your child working at four  even if it is parttime  and I pull my daughter close and she rests her head on me.I dont even mind that she drops bits of flaky pastry down my coat as she eats.Petal has been an absolute treasure.When weve eaten our lunch and the cold is starting to set in again, we walk towards home, hand in hand.I pop into the printers and collect some of the printed designs that hes been producing for me.After that, we swing past the library and I help Petal choose some new books to read as she gets through them at a rate of knots.Then, at home, we settle down for an afternoon of handbag production.Switching on the telly, I find some rubbish for Petal to watch and then I get out Tods borrowed laptop.I manage to create myself an eBay account and link it to PayPal  its all new to me but its not too complicated, even for a committed technophobe.With Phils camera, I take a smart picture of the bags and without too much muttering, upload them, then I write a bit of blurb.Sorted.It feels good to finally have the bags up for sale on the internet but I do wonder if anyone will realise Im actually there.When Ive done all that, I join Petal in front of the television and surround myself with bags and trimmings and sketches.Petal shuffles up next to me and I keep her amused with some scraps of fabric and her kiddy scissors.One day, I hope shell be keen to help me properly.Nell McNamara and Petal Meyers, handbag providers to the stars!How nice would that be?Its coming up to teatime and I havent a clue what to cook, but it will be something quick.Pasta again, more than likely.Im sure that I should have been born Italian.Or I may eventually turn into one with all the pizza and pasta we consume.I wonder what time Olly will be home.Im not working at the chip shop tonight, so we can all settle down and watch whatever delights Saturday night telly has to offer together as a family.In companionable silence, Petal and I watch Whats New Scooby Doo?and a repeated episode of Come Dine with Me, which Ive always said that Olly should apply to go on.Petal gets bored with that so we flick over and watch some sort of youth chat show.The first person is someone from one of those popular teen soaps that neither Petal nor I watch.JLS are on singing their new song, which I think my child enjoys far too much, and then were back to the studio couch and some other minor celeb whos talking about nothing of particular interest.One of my new designs features a big Jammie Dodger  my daughters favourite biscuit.Another is taken from a colourful line of Russian dolls that my parents bought Petal for her last birthday.I cut and stick and glue and embellish like a thing possessed.Looking good.I also need to do some more Fish & Chips and Eat Me/Drink Me bags as I dont want to make the mistake of running out again next week.On the television, a famous footballers wife pops up.Chantelle Clarke  on here to promote her new young adult novels  is all blonde hair and white teeth.I have one eye on the telly, one eye on my bags, so Im not really paying full attention.Look, Mummy.Petal points at the screen.I look up, and as Chantelle twitters on about her books and how marvellous they are, I suddenly realise what Im seeing.Oh, my goodness.Petal beams at me.Its your handbag.Shes right.There on the sofa next to this high end, celebrity WAG is my Fish & Chips handbag.In full view of the camera.My mouth drops open.Della Jewel, the PR woman I met at the Palace must have organised this.How else would someone like Chantelle have got hold of it?I could ask for no better endorsement for my handbags.It looks pretty, Mummy, Petal says, clapping her hands together.It does.And I hope that a lot of other people think so too.33      Well, of course, life then goes crazy.In this age of celebrity worship, every woman under the age of sixty seems to want what Chantelle Clarke has and I cant make stock quick enough to keep up with the orders.I send flowers to Della Jewel at her PR agency to thank her for the exposure.I cant believe that shes been kind enough to do this for me when I hardly even know the woman.Her office calls and asks if theres been some mistake.I just tell them that Im really grateful for her input and its simply a small token of my thanks, but I wonder if Tod is really behind this.Its just like him not to take the credit for it.Christmas came and went with minimal fuss.We stopped for a turkey dinner that Olly made and then I went straight back to making handbags while we watched the ninety seventh showing of Raiders of the Lost Ark and Mary Poppins  now a firm favourite with Petal.Within a few short weeks, the money starts rolling in and I soon have enough to commission a website.The web designer that Tod found for me puts it together really quickly so that I can sell directly from there as well as through eBay.As soon as Im online, the orders ratchet up one more notch.Amid a torrent of tears, I give up my shifts at Live and Let Fry, although I keep the market stall.Its too lucrative not to.I miss Phil and the gang terribly and try to pop into the chippy whenever I find myself in town.My phone never stops ringing.I dont even try to pause to answer it now or Id never get anything finished.At midnight every night, Im still packing up orders.At six every morning, Im up and doing it again.As my name starts to spread, I give a dozen different press interviews in trade magazines and, after that, the phone rings even more.Several high end boutiques call me and ask to stock my handbags.Betty the Bag Lady  who has never contacted me since the day I left my first handbag there  rings and texts constantly.Peevishly, I dont return her calls.Then Chantelle Clarke is featured in Heat magazine with my bag over her shoulder and the pressure increases further.Jen and Constance have been brilliant.When theyve finished their shifts together at the chippy, they come straight to my house and get stuck into hand finishing the handbags with me for a bit of extra cash.They both prove to be demons with the glue gun and the hot fix diamant applicator.But even that is failing to keep pace with demand and I realise that Im going to have to take on more staff if Im to have any hope of keeping my head above water.Straight from his night shift, Olly has been on the phone all morning taking orders and he comes into the living room while all three of us are working.Petal is at pre school now every morning, so that gives us some breathing space too.Woaw, Olly says as he stands and surveys the wreckage around him.It looks like a small nuclear bomb has exploded in here.Its fair to say that our house is no longer our own.Every square inch of space is filled with boxes of handbags, fabric and trimmings.Cartons with orders ready to be dispatched are stacked in the hall.Even the kitchen table is covered with sketches.Family mealtimes are a distant memory.So is our sex life.Whos been on the phone?Olly reels off a lengthy list of the businesses hes dealt with this morning.You need to get onto Dodmans too  the handbag frame supplier  and order some more stock.I need to have some more diamant sparkles by the end of the week before we run out.Can you also give the printer a ring and see if the latest batch of designs is ready?As Im pausing for breath, Jenny looks up from her work.You look absolutely knackered, Olly, she says softly.I am, he admits, seemingly pleased that someone has actually noticed.Were both exhausted, I butt in.This may be all my dreams come true, but theres certainly a nightmarish quality to it as well.Come here, Jen says to my lover (a somewhat loose term now).Sit down for five minutes.Let me rub your shoulders.I have healing hands.Olly does as hes told and Jen stands behind him and starts to massage his back.My dearly beloved makes suitably appreciative noises.Just as Im starting to get a tiny bit jealous, Jenny looks up at me.You next, lady, she says.Neither of you can go on at this pace.Olly and I swap places and I have to say that Jen manages to find knots that I never knew I had.Lets stop for a break, I say when some of the tension has been eased from my shoulders.Ill go and put the kettle on.Olly trails after me into the kitchen.Jens right, he says as I clatter about with the cups.We dont get a minutes peace now.The business has to come first, I tell him.Just while were setting up.This is critical for me.All the publicity has been fantastic and I have to make sure I capitalise on that.Tod says  At that Olly rolls his eyes and so I let the sentence go unfinished.But what Tod does say is that this is probably the best possible chance Ill have to establish my brand in the public eye and I have to seize every opportunity before the media move on to someone else  as they inevitably will.I just dont understand why Olly cant see this.It seems as if he just wants me to knock out a few bags at Hitchin market every week and be content with that.But this is my big break.This could transform our future.What about the wedding?Olly says.The date that weve settled on is in less than a month and its fair to say that Ive done very little towards organising it.I simply havent had the time.Maybe we should postpone it, I suggest tentatively.We were being ridiculously optimistic about booking it for when we did.Things are quite strained between us at the moment and Im not sure that its the right time to be tripping down the aisle.Weve waited this long.Cant we wait a little longer until things settle down here?What if they never do?Olly says.What if this craziness is how our life is going to be from now on?He paces the floor.I saw what being obsessed by his business did to my dad.It completely destroyed him, Nell.Because of the strain, he died long before his time.I dont want that kind of stress for us.I can understand that, but at some point we have to put in more effort to get a better life.Now is my opportunity.He doesnt look convinced.I want more than this, Olly.I gesture at the shabby kitchen.I want our own home, not one where the landlord can chuck us out at any moment.I want a garden for Petal, somewhere for her to play that doesnt involve a ten minute walk to the park.Id like a car.Were too old to be riding round on a scooter now.Its ridiculous.Youre a family man.You have responsibilities.Im trying to do this for all of us.Dont you want more?I want you, he says.I want you and Petal and life as it was before.Thats all.Im frightened that you want more than I can ever be.Oh, Olly.Thats so not true.All my rage dissipates and I go to him and we hold each other tightly.You do still want to get married?he murmurs against my hair.Of course I do.Theres only ever been Olly.Hes been the one love of my life.I need to make time to do this.If only I could think how.34      We have a beautiful Norman church in the centre of Hitchin, set in its own grounds, but as were not churchgoers, we opt instead for the register office in Stevenage, which is not beautiful and not Norman and is at the back of Matalan.I did wonder whether we were actually going to make it to this day at all.Its been touch and go on several occasions, but somehow, in the midst of all the madness, weve managed it.My plan to make my own dress seemed insane at three oclock this morning when I was still hemming it.Pink is the theme  Petal would hear of nothing else  and so Ive got a hot pink shift with a vintage cream lace cape, a long string of cream pearls, and shoes that I had dyed to match.My bouquet is a handful of hot pink and cream gerberas bound together with ribbon, the dark centres studded with diamant.I top my outfit with my Ms & Mrs handbag.Just perfect.Petals tutu style dress is fairy tale pretty  pale pink with hot pink details and fairy wings to match.Shes carrying a small pompom studded with daisies to complement mine.Olly is wearing a vintage sixties shirt in a pink paisley pattern with tailor made mohair trousers and his favourite pointed Chelsea boots.He looks more handsome than Ive ever seen him.The wedding is small, which is probably just as well as its the only way that Ive coped with it.My rocks  Jenny, Constance and Phil  are here.The reception is our wedding present from Phil and its going to be held back at Live and Let Fry, which hes closed up especially for the day.This morning I went in and decorated it all with balloons and put bunches of brightly coloured gerberas in jam jars on the tables and the place is looking great.One of Constances friends has made the cake for us and I put it out on one of the tables.Its iced in a pale cream colour and has three small tiers.Truly an extravagance with the size of the wedding party!But you can never have enough cake, can you?The bottom tier is decorated with chocolate and hot pink hearts while the middle has matching stripes and the final tier is all spotty.A marabou feather confection stands on top.Glasses are out waiting for our return and I know that theres a stash of champagne chilling in the fridge that Phil bought from Costco.Ollys mother, unsurprisingly, declined to come out of her sun soaked retirement to attend and my parents are away on a three month cruise.They wont mind missing it as theyll just be delighted that weve finally tied the knot.Olly and I will go to visit them as soon as we can when theyre back.If Im really honest, Phil, Constance and Jen feel more like family to us now so we wont feel as if were missing out.Weve got a few more of our friends dropping by to toast us later and Tod also said that hell pop in afterwards.Thankfully, with Nell McNamara Handbags being so busy, we do have some money to spend on a few luxuries to make the day more memorable.Weve hired two pink and cream stretched mini limousines to whisk us and our guests to our wedding.OK?Olly asks as the posh minis pull up outside the register office.I nod in response.Sure?Absolutely.I lean against him.Despite the stresses and strains of the last few months, Im glad that we have actually made it.We sip chilled champagne on the journey  even Petal has a little taste  and I think Im finally beginning to relax enough to enjoy it.Out of the other mini, Jen, Constance and Phil stumble, giggling.Looks as if theyve been enjoying the in car hospitality too.They all look great.Constance has toned her usual leopard print right down and is wearing a smart pink suit.Im pleased to say that her trademark vertiginous heels are still firmly in place.Jenny is looking very comely in a Marilyn Monroe style silk number.And it looks like Phil has splashed out on a new grey suit for the occasion.As instructed, hes wearing a pink tie and has a gerbera buttonhole.You look fabulous, I tell my old boss, straightening his tie as I do.So do you, Nell, he says.His voice cracks with emotion.Youre a stunner.Ollys a very lucky man.Thats what I keep telling him.I link my arm through his.Come on, wed better go in or well miss our slot.We all pile into the register office, which, thankfully, is much nicer on the inside than it is on the outside.Olly and I take our places, flanked by our witnesses, Phil and Constance.I notice that Constance slips her hand into Phils.Petal stands behind us, flowers in a death grip in her tiny hands, as she concentrates hard on being good as instructed.The registrar completes the formalities and then asks, Do you, Nell McNamara, take Oliver Meyers to be your lawful wedded husband?As I look at Olly, my lover, my friend, my soon to be husband, all doubts, all fears, fly out of my mind when I say, I do.35      Back at Live and Let Fry the champagne corks pop.Some of our friends swing by to join us and swell the numbers.In his usual inimitable style, Phil serves us all fabulous fish and chips.The mood is high.I put disposable cameras on the tables and everyone is taking photographs  lovely mementos of our special day.We let sixties music rock out of the stereo system and I feel all the tension of the last few months melt away.Looking over at Olly, I watch him tenderly wiping tomato ketchup from the front of Petals dress, and smile.It does feel different, I say as I sidle up next to him and link my arm in his, being Mrs Oliver Meyers.Who would have thought so after all the years weve been together?But somehow it does feel like were a proper family now.A tightknit little unit.Us against the world.You think so?Yeah.Maybe I should have become Mr Nell McNamara if youre going to be the famous one?I dont think so.Im happy being Mrs Meyers.Tonight, Constance has offered to take Petal home with her for a sleepover so that Olly and I can have a one night athome honeymoon.My husband (I like the sound of that!)thought that we should at least have a few days away somewhere, but how can we when I have so much to do at the moment?Our two week extravaganza in an exclusive beach bungalow in Bali will more than likely have to wait until our tenth anniversary.It was more by good luck than good management that weve actually had the whole day off today.I can certainly manage one night of wedded bliss though!Happy?Olly asks.Very.Mummy and Daddy!Youre being all squishy, Petal complains.Thats because were very much in love, I tell her.Our child doesnt look very impressed by that, but Olly and I exchange a dreamy look nevertheless.The afternoon wears on.Phil, jacket already thrown off, loosens his tie and spends an awful lot of time cosied up with Constance, which makes me smile.Everything about Jenny is getting looser due to the amount of champagne that shes necked.She comes up now and plants a wet kiss on my cheek.I bloody love you two, she slurs.Bloody love ya.She wraps her arms round Olly.And you, she continues, have missed your big chance.He gets a big fat smacker on his lips.It must be like being licked by an over exuberant puppy.Great, Olly says.I can tell that he wants to wipe his mouth with the back of his hand and I grin at him.Shall we cut the cake now, Nell?Excellent idea, I agree, coming to his rescue.We clear the decks a bit and we all gather round the rather grand cake.A battery of disposable cameras flash as we pose with the knife held precariously above the bottom tier.Just as were about to make our first cut together, the door chime signals the arrival of a new addition to our party.I look up and see Tod coming through the door.Immediately, I abandon the cake cutting and rush to greet him.Theres a hiatus while I say hello.Hi.I feel flushed and overexcited, whereas Tod is as cool as always.Glad you could make it.I wouldnt have missed it for the world, he says, then he turns to Olly.May I kiss the bride?Youd better ask the bride yourself, Olly, quite wisely, answers.Tod tilts his head, silently asking for approval, then he lifts my chin and for one fleeting moment I get a flashback to when we were in the car together.He kisses me softly on both cheeks.For the blushing bride.Hes right, the bride is blushing now.My face probably matches the bright pink gerberas in my bouquet.Tod proffers an exquisitely wrapped present, which looks like it might well be a bottle of fizz.Thank you.I have one more surprise for you, if I may?With that, he throws open the door again and lets in a photographer laden down with equipment.Oh?What better backdrop to photograph your new Ms & Mrs handbag than this?Id forgotten that Id even told Tod about that.Fancy him remembering.Fantastic idea, I gush.Some of it may be the copious champagne talking.Tod waves airily at our guests.Dont let us interfere.Carry on with your cake cutting, Nell.That will be just perfect.So, somewhat bemused, we return to pose with the knife.I notice that the expression on Ollys face has darkened somewhat.As we cut the cake, the professional photographer clicks away, this way and that.I pose and preen with my handbag on full show and get Petal in on the act too, but I cant help but notice that Olly doesnt seem to share my enthusiasm.The deed is done.Our friends clap.The photographer finally puts down his camera.I start to help Constance and Jenny dish out the cake to our friends.Can I steal you away for five minutes?Tod asks.Kyle here would like to take some more shots of just you on your own with your handbag.Oh, OK.I put down the plate in my hands, lick my sticky fingers and wipe them on my dress.Olly takes my arm and pulls me to one side.Nell, he says.His teeth are gritted.This is not a good time.Its only five minutes, I say.No one minds.I do, he hisses.I mind.Not everything has to be turned into a publicity stunt.But this is a great chance, I counter.I dont know why I didnt think of it myself.Tod has been kind enough to organise a photographer.Im not happy, Nell.It makes perfect sense.Tods right.Its the ideal setting to launch the Ms & Mrs handbag.We could have just staged a wedding if thats how you feel, he snaps.Why go through the bother of all those tiresome vows?I dont feel like that, I snap back.Its just that I happen to think, in this instance, that Tod is right.Tod, Tod, Tod, my husband mutters.Come on, I urge.Just have a couple of photographs of us taken together.For me.No.He pulls away.Leave me out of this.Ill have nothing to do with it.Well, excuse me, I say crisply, but Im going to have my photograph taken.I snatch up the handbag thats causing so much controversy.Olly stomps away.Looks like weve had our first domestic as Mr and Mrs Meyers.That didnt take long.But surely Olly understands by now how important this is to me?Clearly he doesnt.I sigh to myself.Looks like the one night honeymoon isnt going to be much fun after this.36      Two weeks after the wedding, Im sitting in my pyjamas watching Lorraine.Petal is sitting on my lap eating her breakfast and has just spilled her porridge all down me.Sorry, Mummy, Petal says.Breakfast at the table tomorrow, I say.That will teach me to encourage my child to have slovenly habits.Even though there are extenuating circumstances today.Petals got a sniffly cold and is red eyed and runny nosed.The nursery are hysterical if you send any children in with the slightest thing wrong, so Im having to keep her at home for a couple of days until it clears up.Shes not poorly enough to be confined to bed, but shes ill enough to be tired and whiny and tearful, which is a complete nightmare as I have so much to do.In fact, Im so tired that I didnt even jump up when the porridge ran down my jim jams.Im just looking at it with a sinking heart.More washing.After the photograph of the Ms & Mrs handbag appeared in the national press  all organised by Tod  the phone hasnt stopped ringing.Olly and I havent had a moment to ourselves.The orders have gone completely crazy and every waking moment  and some sleeping ones  has been spent making handbags.The house is a complete state.Every corner looks like a handbag factory.Theres a small, clear track that winds its way through the middle like a maze but you have to move handbags from every seat before you can sit down.Already, before I got Petal up this morning, Ive been making handbags for two hours.My mobile rings again and I sigh.I cant even sit here in my porridge covered state in peace for five minutes.From beneath the pile of soft toys and handbag trimmings, I locate the ringing and rescue the phone.I know that its a business call as no one else ever rings us these days.Our friends have long since given up asking us to go out as were never available.Sure enough, the cut glass tone on the other end tells me I wasnt mistaken.Karin Parks from Fabulous magazine, the woman says.We want to run a feature on your handbags.I feel like falling to my knees and giving praise, but I am aware of dislodging my child and nicely congealed breakfast cereal by doing so.This is like someone phoning to tell you that youve won the lottery and that its Christmas tomorrow.Thats fantastic, I manage to stammer.I can hear the satisfied smile even down the line.Wed like to send a photographer to your offices today.Not so good.Offices, I blurt.I work from home.Even better, she says.But I think maybe she is imagining some minimalist, penthouse loft apartment in the Docklands, not a tatty, terraced house in Hitchin.Surveying the mess with dismay, I venture, Could you possibly make that tomorrow?Were squeezing you into the next issue.More crisply.Id prefer today.I have a photographer free.Today would be wonderful, I say.Hell be with you at eleven, she says.Can you email me your address details?Before I agree, shes already hung up.I look round the room again and my heart starts to pound with panic.Petal, I say.Would you like to play a game with Mummy?No, my daughter says.Ill take that as a yes.Were going to play Tidy the Lounge, I tell her.First were, youre, going to put all your toys away.Im poorly, Petal reminds me.You do it.This will make you feel better, I lie.Well do it together.Im busy watching television and having a cold, my daughter insists.A very important person is coming to visit us and we want the house to look all sparkly.She takes in the seemingly impossible task.I dont.Lets just phone Auntie Constance and see if shed like to help too.When I call her, my dear, reliable and indispensable friend agrees to come round straight away.I quickly email my details to the magazine.That done, I reckon I have ten minutes before Constance arrives to get myself showered and dressed in clothes that make me look more like an up and coming handbag designer about to break onto the scene rather than a porridge wearing slattern.Petal, start collecting your toys now, I say.I try to sound as threatening as possible.Or they all go straight in the bin.My daughter rolls her eyes but, miracle upon miracle, she starts to round up her toys.Its all done, of course, at the slowest pace possible and she has a chat with each of them as she does.Leaving her to it, I make my escape and run into the shower.Im just downstairs again when Constance arrives.I hug her, give her the low down and, without further ado, we set to.Petal also bucks up considerably now that Constance is here.An hour later and my house still looks like a handbag factory, but it looks like a tidy ish one.Trimmings are scooped into plastic cartons.Boxes are stacked.Bags are lined up for display.Sketches are piled neatly.Everything that can be hidden is hidden.We finish as the doorbell rings again.Constance sighs with relief.Ill put the kettle on.I kiss her.I love you.Do you love me too, Mummy?Petal demands.Yes.Youve been wonderful.She gets a kiss too.The photographer and her assistant sweep in.They are both unfeasibly slender and trendy.Black is the mode du jour and I feel clownish in my yellow, red and blue T shirt dress and orange ballet pumps.Perfect, the photographer coos.Workshop chic.Is that a compliment?Not for the first time, Im embarrassed by my own house when previously I loved it so much.Its battered comfort suited us well as a family.Now I have the worlds press trudging through it, Im not so sure.They both completely take over the living room with lights and equipment.I feel like a spare part.But, eventually, after rearranging all the furniture, they have me posing with the handbags.They also take some pictures of Petal as shes adorable, despite me having to continually wipe a slime trail of snot from her nose, and down as much tea as Constance can provide.Three exhausting hours later and they sweep out again.We all collapse onto the sofa.That was fun.Like having your toenails pulled out or peeling off your own face with a spoon.I dont know how you do it, girl, Constance says.Im worn out just watching you.She pats my knee.We miss you at the chippy.I miss you all too, I say honestly.Ill try to pop in more often.We all cuddle up together until Constance says, Id better go now or Ill be late and Phil will give me what for.As if Phil ever gets cross with anyone.Well walk you into town.Petal, get your shoes and coat on, some fresh air will do you good.Because Constance is here, she pretends shes the model child and doesnt protest at all.The day is crisp and bright.As we walk, my head whirrs as I think of all the things I need to do.We drop into the chip shop and get hugged to death by Jenny and Phil.Petal picks at some chips.We leave the welcoming warmth of the shop and swing back out into the cold.I take Petals hand in mine and she even manages to skip along beside me, clearly nowhere near as exhausted as I am by our photo shoot experience.We make our way back home and as we do, we walk down through the Market Place to Church Yard.The shops in this row are all tiny, olde worlde and are half timbered, black and white.The shops here are always busy.Good footfall, I think the proper term is.My eye is drawn to the For Let sign above one of the doors.Its rare that one of these places becomes vacant.I stop abruptly and my daydreamy daughter walks straight into me.Thats what we need, I think.A shop.We have to move the business out of our home and into a shop where we can sell the bags and use it as our workshop too.Why didnt I think of it before?Because we didnt have the money before, of course.But surely theres enough cash flow coming in now that we could consider it?I wonder how much this place would cost.Could we do it?One things for sure, this very afternoon, Ill be ringing up to find out.I make a note of the estate agents name and number.Standing back, I admire the shopfront.My name would look very nice hanging above the door in bold, bright letters.Very nice, indeed.37      This terrifies me, Olly says.He lugs another box out of the hired van and starts to climb the stairs.Itll be fine, I assure him.It has to be.As it turns out, we have borrowed a stonking amount of money from the bank to fund this shop.Its a figure that has more noughts on the end than Im happy with.But what can I do?I want the business to expand and this is the only way.The rate were paying back every month is pretty frightening, too.On the plus side, weve secured this gorgeous, period shop in a prime location that is, surely, going to give the business an immense boost.As a happy bonus, the shop comes with a flat above it, so weve given up our rented house and are moving in here.Olly is crashing about, unhappily.I think the fact that were moving in the pouring rain doesnt help.Everything looks better when the sun is shining, doesnt it?This is an old, old building, Tudor, I think, and I just hope he doesnt notice quite how wonky the floors are.Every floor in here is wonky, he mutters.My husband bangs down another box.A little cloud of dust floats up.Frankly, its not just the floors.Everything else is wonky too.But then everything is wonky, Olly complains.I decide to keep quiet.The flat has been used for nothing but storage for years and its in desperate need of a good clean.Its also filling up quickly.Theres my handbag collection to accommodate and Ollys records.Ive no idea, yet, where theyll all go.The downside of moving out of our house and into the flat is that its much more cramped here.In my defence, it did look slightly bigger when it was empty.Things do, dont they?Now its got all our detritus piled high in it, I do wonder how on earth were going to fit.This is a dump, Olly says, clearly picking up on my thoughts again.A small dump.Itll be fine.I have been saying this since eight oclock this morning when we first opened our eyes and even Im getting sick of hearing it.At least we can separate work and home a bit now.How?Olly asks.We live above the shop.Literally.But we have a separate living space and all the handbag related stuff will be downstairs out of the way.You wont get a needle in your bottom every time you sit on the sofa.Olly looks sceptical.I promise.Then, You have a nice little space to keep your scooter in the yard.His precious bloody scooter.Olly has already commandeered one of the small outhouses for that.Its one saving grace, he concedes reluctantly.I sigh.I know that its daunting  Daunting?He laughs.That doesnt come close to describing how Im feeling about this.Olly looks round him.We might be a handbag free zone in this poky flat, but the overheads have rocketed, Nell.The bills that are coming in are monster.Dont you want me to succeed?This is success?He runs his hand through his hair.This just feels like debt and worry and stress.From where I stand, it feels as if were in a worse position that we were before.I want to say that Tod is very supportive of this move, but every time I start a sentence with Tod, Olly just rolls his eyes and stops listening.A bit like Petal does when I tell her its bedtime.Mr Urbans input into our lives has become something of an issue between us since the wedding/handbag/photo incident.I see Tod as someone who drives and encourages me.Olly sees him as meddling and interfering.But, to be honest, I dont know how I would have done any of this without him.Tod came to the bank with me to help me get the loan.He did the same at the solicitors when I signed the contracts.Olly just hates doing this kind of thing.And I dont think I could have managed it all alone.Ive gone from working in a chippy to having my own shop, designing my own handbags, in a short space of time.Youve gone from having a decent paying job with no worries to being swamped with debt and up to your eyeballs in shit.You dont own the shop, Nell.The bank does.Everything we earn goes to paying them off.And it will do for the fore seeable future.Is that really what you want?Yes, I say softly.It wont always be like this.Its a means to an end.He shakes his head.I just cant see the fun in owning your own business.But youre happy working in a pizza factory?You were once happy working in a chip shop.Cant we get back to that?No, I say.Ive seen what else is out there and I want more for us.Do you really want it for us, Nell?His face is bleak and Ive never, ever, in all our time together seen him look so worried.Or do you want it for you?38      Olly swung out of their new place.He didnt quite know what to call it: shop, flat, business premises?A combination of all three, he guessed.
