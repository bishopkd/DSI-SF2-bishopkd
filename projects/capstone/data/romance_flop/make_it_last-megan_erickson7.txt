Seriously, join the club, Jamie muttered.Their father shot them both a stern glance, then focused again on Tate.She felt like there was a bulls eye on her forehead.And why werent you ready to make the decision?I had to make sure its what I wanted.That this time Im making the decision for me.He raised an eyebrow.And is it?She nodded.Im scared and freaked and nervous, but its what I want.He nodded and brought down his fist on the arm of his chair like he held a gavel.Then you go.Tate sat up.But Dad  He held up a hand.Im doing fine.And even if I wasnt, you need to live your life.This isnt what I want for you.But Im not miserable here.Of course not, now that Cams back, Jamie interjected.Her father nodded.Right, hes back, and youre happy.I cant imagine how youd be if he left without you.Now that you both know what its like to be together again, as adults.Dont you think?Damn man.Always so insightful.Like he could read her mind.Yes, she said grudgingly.So, again, he said, his voice softer.You go.Well miss you.Well miss you so much.But you arent far.And Ill be so happy knowing youre happy and youre with the man youre supposed to be with.You two take care of each other.And thats the way it should be.Tates eyes prickled as she turned to her brother.Jamie?His smile was sad.Its okay.I only have another year of school.Ill be at your graduation.I know you will.But his tone was less than reassuring.Tate tried harder.And homecoming.And prom.And the holidays  Jamie launched himself across the couch and hugged her.His big hand rubbed her back and she buried her face in his neck.I know, Tate.I know.She pulled out of the hug and wiped her eyes, then stood up and walked over to her father.She bent down and wrapped her arms around his shoulders, kissing his whiskered cheek.I love you, Dad.His voice cracked when he spoke, but she pretended not to notice.I love you, too, baby.IT WAS TWO a. m.  when Cam got off work and all he could think about was Tate.He was itching to know how her conversation with her father went.He got into his truck and started it up, then tapped on the dashboard and stared at the clock.It was really late, and he knew shed be asleep.He sighed and pulled his phone out of the glove box.He could just let her sleep.Nothing was changing overnight, right?Oh God, what if she changed her mind?He thunked his forehead on the steering wheel and groaned.There was no missed call, no text message.Nothing.So she was either torturing him on purpose or it was bad news.By the time he got home, he was fuming and assumed she was torturing him.Because hed rather be pissed off than depressed.He didnt shower like he always did when he got off work.He signed right into Utope, planning to leave a flaming bag of shit on her door or a severed horse head in her bed.Go big or go home on the revenge, right?But when he signed into Utope, he saw Tate had been in several hours ago.In the game, there was a note on the kitchen table.He clicked on it.I know youre mad I didnt call.Probably want to put a bag of flaming shit on my doorstep, dont you?Well, before you get the lighter, check out the bedroom.Love, T  Hed actually already grabbed the lighter so he put that back in a kitchen drawer and walked his little avatar body to the bedroom.And when he opened the door, he swore his eyes in real life got misty, or maybe that was from staring so hard at the television screen.Because Tate had found posters in the game and plastered the walls of the bedroom of their house with them.The Empire State Building.Central Park.A Lion King Broadway advertisement.30 Rock.Macys.And more iconic New York City landmarks.He spun his avatar in a circle, checking out all the posters.And then Tate sauntered out of the adjoining bathroom, wearing an I <3 NY shirt.And Cam started laughing.He clicked for his avatar to laugh, and then the room filled with two deep chuckles.16      CAM TONGUED THE corner of his mouth as he filled in his spreadsheet on the computer.He loved spreadsheets.Everything all nice and orderly and color coded.His roommate in college, Alec Stone, had shown him the genius of spreadsheets and Cam had been hooked ever since.This spreadsheet was organized with possible apartments for his mom.He had columns for security deposit, estimated utilities cost, insurance and on and on.If he was out of state, he wanted to make sure she was in a place she felt comfortable and could afford.Of course, hed be sending her money.Every month.Like clockwork.She was Ma.He liked the complex called Nichol Way Estates.An available apartment was on the first floor and she could look out her kitchen window every day and see a small flower garden courtyard.She loved flowers, especially peonies, so hed make sure they had a peony tree or bush or whatever the hell those things were.Hed officially accepted the job that morning.With a fancy e mail to his new boss.That was still a weird word to say.Boss.Every time he thought about, his stomach flipped with nervous excitement.He had a future, doing what he loved, with the girl he loved.He wondered how the hell he got so lucky.His phone rang and he picked it up with one hand while typing with the other, because he had one more column to fill.He jammed the phone in between his ear and shoulder so he could still type with two hands.Hello?The first sounds on the other end of the line were breathless, like the person was breathing hard, then, Cam.It was Jamies voice.Cam reached up and grabbed the phone, pressing it to his ear.Yeah, whats up?Why are you out of breath?I need your help, man.Of course, whatever you need.Its ...its Dad.Only three words.But they were said with an unmistakable tone of dread.The oxygen sucked out of the room like a vacuum and Cams lungs gasped.He braced himself on the desk in front of him.What happened?Jamies voice was a little muffled, like he was looking around him.He said he had chest pains and then collapsed.I dont know whats going on.Were waiting for the ambulance right now.Is he conscious?Jamie sounded like he sucked in a breath, and when he spoke, his voice was almost a squeak.Sort of?Wheres your sister?I cant get ahold of her.Cam squeezed his eyes shut, because Jamie must be completely freaked, dealing with this all on his own.How he was holding it together this well was a mystery to Cam.Okay, buddy.Im on my way over, okay?Just  Oh, the ambulance just pulled up outside so  Ill meet you at the hospital, and Ill keep trying to get ahold of your sister.When Jamie spoke again, his voice was steadier.Great, great.Thanks, Cam.Glad you called me.Hang in there.See ya soon.There was a muffled Bye and then the call disconnected.Cam called Trevor and told him he wouldnt be in to work.Then Cam called Tate.Her phone went right to voice mail.He called the diner, and Margo said Tate and Anne had run a quick errand.It was unlike Tate not to have her phone with her, but he figured her guard was down now.This was a blow none of them had expected.He made it to the hospital in half the time it normally did, because he ran a couple of lights, and found Jamie in the emergency room waiting area.Any news?He slid into the seat beside Tates brother.Last I heard, theyre admitting him.They told me theyd come out and tell me when I could see him.Jamies eyes were huge, a little boy in a mans face.Thats not good.That theyre admitting him.I dont know.Jamie hung his head.Thanks for coming.Course.Jamies phone rang, and he fumbled in his pocket before pulling it out.He glanced at the caller ID, his eyes shooting to Cams when he answered.Tate.Cam could hear her voice on the other end, firing off questions.She must have listened to their voice mails.Jamie muttered a couple of words and then hung up.Shell be here soon.Cam squeezed Jamies shoulder.We all gotta be strong for your dad, all right?We can do this.Jamie bit his lip and then nodded.Okay.WHEN TATE BURST into the waiting room, she saw Cam sitting with her brother.His arm was around Jamies shoulders as Jamie slumped forward, his clasped hands smashed against his forehead between his legs.Cam was talking in low tones, his fingers rubbing slow circles on her brothers shoulder.She filed that away in the back of her mind, Cams attention to her family.How hed make an amazing father.But today was about her father.Cam looked up and saw her, then he patted Jamies back.Her brother nodded and raised his head, giving Tate a watery smile.She couldnt return it.Not now.When she didnt know if her dad was okay.Cam stood up and held his arms out.And all she could do was run into those arms and burrow into Cam, as deep as she could go.He squeezed her tightly and pressed kisses on the top of her head.Well figure this out, Tate.Itll be okay.Cam pulled back and brushed his thumbs over her cheeks, marring the tear tracks she could feel on her skin.A nurse came out a little bit ago, letting us know the doctor will be out soon to give us an update, okay?She nodded and turned to Jamie, whod stood up beside Cam.She grasped him in a hug and he squeezed back, his breath hot along her temple.When the diagnosis had come, Jamie had been a few inches shorter than her.Hed clung to her as she smoothed his shaggy hair off his thirteen year old face.But now the stubble along her jaw rubbed her forehead as he stood above her.His arms were longer, his chest broader.When had he grown in to a man?How had she missed this?No ice cream in the bathtub this time, he said quietly.I even had moose tracks in the freezer for you.He chuckled softly as her head bounced off his chest.When we get home.I think we still have some of that chocolate that hardens when it gets cold.And waffle cones.And rainbow sprinkles.She started crying again then, wishing they were back at home, arguing over the umpires strike calls.Tate curled up on Cams lap.Jamie in the corner of the sofa so he could reach his dad in the armchair for good natured shoulder punches.Jamies grip tightened and she was jostled as a solid heat warmed her back.She took a shuddering breath as the tears slowed, and she relaxed in a cocoon of the two most important men in her life other than her father.Eventually, they migrated to the chairs, Cam and Jamie beside each other, Tate sitting on Cam with her legs over Jamies lap.She wasnt sure how long they sat there.At one point, someone force fed her a granola bar and poured water down her throat.But the food tasted like cardboard and the water did nothing to settle her stomach.Eventually a doctor came out and explained that her father had recently been put on a new medication and hed had a negative reaction.So what does that mean?Tate stood on wobbly legs.A strong arm rested on her lower back, supporting her more than she wanted to admit.Well, the doctor said, brushing her hands over her white coat.We need to keep him for a little and run some tests.Make sure this isnt a symptom of a larger problem.Did you do a blood test yet?How are his white blood cells?Jamie asked.Were waiting for the results.Can we see him?Tate reached for Cams hand and exhaled when he linked his fingers with hers.The doctor nodded and motioned them back.She eyed Cam, who clearly wasnt family, but Tate set her face and plastered herself to his side.The doctor tipped up her lips and didnt object.Hospitals were always described by smell and while Tate hated the smell, it was the sounds that she despised the most.The squeak of the nurses shoes, the swish of paperwork, the beep of machines, the soft voices.All of it grated on her nerves until every one felt raw and exposed.She wanted to yell, or blast music, or something.Anything to get rid of the weird faux silence that surrounded her.And this reminded her of when her father was first diagnosed.When she gripped the hand of a thirteen year old Jamie and felt like she was on an out of control roller coaster.Part of her didnt want to admit it, but her hand in Cams steadied her.She finally felt like she could maybe make it through whatever life tossed at her next.Hospital beds always had a way of making the person in them seem pale and small.She hated that.Plus she was tired of seeing IVs in her dads arms.He bruised so badly now.Hey guys.He smiled at them.Sorry for the scare.You better apologize.Jamie sat at the foot of the bed.Im going to let your ice cream melt just for freaking us out.Their dad smiled at them and then turned to Tate.Hey baby.Tate scrunched her lips to the side, resisting the urge to wail at seeing her father in a hospital bed again.Hey Daddy.Im okay.I know.He reached his hand out, the one that wasnt attached to the IV, to shake Cams hand.Glad youre here.Cam smiled.Me too.He leaned his head back on the pillow.Lunch was a cold chicken sandwich.Ew.Jamie wrinkled his nose.Get me a burger?No.Tate pointed a finger at both the men in her family.Dad, youll eat what they tell you to while youre here.When you get out, Im sure Anne will make you something fancy and calorie laden.I feel fine.I can go home now.Nice try, Dad.He snorted.It was a weak effort.Jamie picked at the sheet.They think its just the medication, though.You should be fine.The should be hung in the air between them.Hovering.Waiting.They all saw it but no one wanted to acknowledge it.Cancer had knocked her dad down several pegs but itd never once dimmed his light.Not when his hair thinned and not when chemo made him puke up water.Tate sat on the edge of the bed near her fathers hip and leaned down, wrapped her arms around his shoulders.He hugged her back, and she could feel slight tremors in his arms.She hugged tighter.They stayed with him for another hour or so, leaving the room occasionally to get snacks at one of the hospitals many delis.Her father was in good spirits, making jokes.Although sometimes a tenseness would pass over his face, and his lips would tighten, which made Tate nervous.But then in an instant itd be gone.But when the doctor walked in, her shoes barely making a sound on the tile floor, and announced the results of the blood test were back, her face was carefully blank.Tates stomach slammed into her shoes.There were numbers and words coming from the doctors mouth, which Tate at one time had studied like crazy so she knew every bit of her fathers illness.She thought they were done with those.That the last round of chemo had been it.Shed happily wiped that area of her brain clean so it was ready for some other type of information.Which she shouldnt have done.Because these numbers were back, and Jamie was crying.And her dads face was pale.And Cam looked like hed been punched in the gut.And Tate?Tate felt ...numb.Like she was floating above the room, listening to someone else hearing that their fathers cancer was back.This wasnt her life.In her life, her father had beaten cancer, and Jamie was maturing and she was off to start a life with her soul mate in New York.But then she made eye contact with Cam, and the devastation was written all over his face.He didnt even try to hide it.And thats when her bubble popped, and she slammed back into her body.Because this, right here in the hospital room, this was her life.She raised her chin and straightened her spine.This time, damn it, this time she wouldnt let it defeat her.She wouldnt crumble in this sanitary prison.Shed stay strong for her dad and shed meet this head on.And shed break down and mourn her selfish thoughts in private.Because she couldnt leave her dad.There was no way around it.She didnt want to leave him, no matter if he had six months or six years left.The doctor was talking treatment again, but he seemed less confident this time around.She wanted as much time with her dad as she could get.She wanted to soak in his presence and learn all the lessons she still needed to learn.Thered be no New York for her.She stood up and walked to her fathers bedside, then leaned down and pressed a kiss to his forehead.Im so sorry, Dad.His face was turned away, toward the window, as if he could lessen the blow of the doctors words if he didnt meet them head on.And then he met her eyes, and all she saw was defeat.So its back, he said quietly.She smoothed his thinning hair off his forehead.It is, but weve been here all along.And well always be here.He must have known then what she was saying.Because his eyes welled up.Then Tates vision blurred and she turned around to allow herself to be wrapped into Cams arms.Jamies voice murmured behind her to their father.She clung to Cam, burrowing his face in his chest while one of his hands glided up and down her back.They didnt stay the night.Her dad insisted they go home.Mostly, Tate was glad.She needed to be home and have the time to process the news.Cam stopped her with a loose grip on her biceps before she walked out of the doors of the hospital.Do you want me to come home with you?She looked at Jamie, who shuffled his feet, eyes on the glass doors of the hospital to the night sky outside.She wasnt sure how much time she had left with Cam.And the news hurt him too.She could read it all over his face.If she really thought about it, all she wanted was to go home and fall asleep in Cams arms.She looked up into his dark eyes.Could you?Relief softened his features as he nodded.Ill follow you in my truck.She drove home with Jamie in the passenger seat in silence.No radio or anything.Like they both needed time to clear their heads.When she turned onto their street, she felt a light touch on her arm.She looked over at Jamie.In the dark light, his expression was hard to read.Then that light touch migrated toward her hand.She took it off the steering wheel, and he linked his fingers with hers.He squeezed, and she squeezed back.Youre not leaving anymore, are you?His question wasnt a plea.It was more of a statement than anything.She didnt dare speak, just shook her head.Jamie made a sound, like a small sob.Im sorry.She squeezed his hand again.Well do it right this time.Spend as much time together as we can.Okay?Jamie nodded.And she let go of his hand so she could put her truck in park.Cams headlights cut across the front of her house as he pulled into her driveway.Jamie stepped out but she sat at the steering wheel, staring at her house until Cam opened her door for her, unbuckled her seat belt and led her into the house.She wasnt sure what came next.He helped her out of her clothes and shoved a toothpaste laden toothbrush into her mouth.Slipped a pair of pajama cotton shorts up to her hips and a big T shirt over her head.Then she was in bed, wrapped in Cams arms.She hadnt shed a tear yet.Not one.She rolled into Cam, who wore only a pair of boxers, and ran the tip of her nose along the side of his neck.She walked her fingers up each rib, along the grooves of his stomach, tracing the cut muscles at his hips.He made a sound in the back of this throat, gripping her arm.She felt a slight push, but she wouldnt let him dislodge her.She wouldnt let him turn her down.She opened her mouth and latched on to his neck, sucking the smooth skin and humming.The pressure on his arm eased and when she added a nip of teeth, he relented, his motion switching directions, and now he was pulling her tighter to his body.His lips brushed along her temple as a hand rose up into her hair.Tate.She released the skin at his neck and nibbled at his earlobe, tonguing and tugging at the small earring.Are you sure?She rose above him, her hands on either side of his head, straddling his hips so his hardness nestled between her legs.They hadnt had sex yet since they got back together, like neither wanted to take that final step again, that last big commitment.She knew once they came together again, theyd be soldered together, the melting parts of themselves hardening into one.It would take a sharp, hot knife to separate.But she didnt care anymore.Because their future was burning up before them, that dream turning to dust.This time, when it was over, she wanted to take a part of him with her.She wanted to leave a part of herself with him.Ive never been more sure.I need you.And then she lowered herself above him, pressing her lips to his, and he opened for her, angling her head so he could get deeper inside her.She rocked her hips and he moaned into his mouth.She hurt.Everywhere.And she ached for Cam so badly.Ached to forget about everything crumbling around her and lose herself in the one man she ever loved.With a small growl, he rolled her onto her back.He tucked his face into her neck, licking and biting, kissing and sucking to the dip in her throat and along her collarbone.He gripped her leg above the knee with a strong hand and propped it up on his hip, opening her up to him.She bent her other knee, planting her foot on the bed, and squeezed it to him.And then she surrendered.She let him strip her of her shirt and she writhed under him as he sucked one nipple into his mouth.She gasped at the sharp sting of teeth.God, shed always loved that.Cam knew just how to play her, when to give her that edge of pain and when to soothe it with a lick.He knew just how hard to suck that it hurt and then when to back off.It had always been Cam.And it always would be.He slipped off her shorts and underwear, taking his boxers off at the same time, then resumed his position between her legs.All she could do was grip his hair and run her hands over his back.Her muscles felt like jelly and she hadnt even come yet.But Cam had rendered her drugged with his hands and lips and teeth.That hard arousal pressing against her nakedness.He reached down between her legs, running his fingers through the wetness, dipping inside and then rubbing her clit.Youre crazy ready for me.His lips and tongue traced the shell of her ear and his fingers were doing crazy things.All she could gasp out was Always.Fuck, Tate, he moaned.Missed your mouth.Yeah?The things I do with it or the words that come out of it?She gasped out a laugh.Both.He grinned then, a wicked grin along with a twist of his fingers.And then she wasnt laughing.Because her hips were churning, grinding against his hand.But that wasnt what she wanted.Somehow she got the muscles of her arm and hand to work as she reached down and gripped him, and stroked from root to tip.He grunted.I want this, she said, and bit his shoulder.Fuck.Thats the idea.She squeezed and pumped her hand.His hips rocked against her and his mouth crashed down on hers.Condoms?he mumbled against her lips.Nightstand.He leaned back and raised an eyebrow.She rolled her eyes.I just bought them, stud.Chill out.He smirked and pulled out the top drawer, fumbling in the box before pulling out a foil packet.He ripped it open with his teeth, then rolled it on with one hand.The ease of it stung.Were going to have to talk about how you have this one handed condom act down to a science, she said.He shook his head and braced himself on his forearms over her.He nudged her nose with his.How about we not talk about that right now?And then he kissed her again, and all thoughts of other girls fled as his tongue proved she was the only one on his mind.She felt him at her entrance, nudging.And then his hips canted, and he slid inside.Tate hugged him to her chest and wrapped her legs around him as they both gasped.When every inch of him was inside her heat, he didnt move.One hand cupped her neck and the other lightly gripped her hair.His forehead pressed into her temple and his breath rushed hot over her face.Tate.God.I fucking missed you.And that was when the first tears threatened.When the magnitude of the day caught up with her.She tucked her head into his neck and urged him to move with a rock of her hips.Missed you, too.But he didnt let her get away with hiding.He pulled back slightly and raised her head to meet her eyes.No ones ever come close to meaning to me what you mean to me.You know that, right?She bit the inside of her cheek, hard.He gripped her chin and circled his hips, once.She gasped.Tate, you know that, right?I love you.She couldnt speak, because the sobs were starting in her throat.So she just nodded.But again, Cam didnt relent.Please say the word, he whispered.A sob escaped.Yes.And then he moved.In that lazy, rolling motion that only Cam had.He started slow, watching her face, kissing the corners of her eyes and mouth.She gripped his hips harder with her legs and met his thrusts.And that was when his lazy rolls turned into powerful thrusts.He rose up on his palms and watched their connection.She admired the shifting muscles in his thighs and shoulders and biceps.The straining veins in his neck and forearms.There was no sight like Cam during sex.The angle wasnt hitting her right, so she lowered a hand just where she needed it, pressing and rolling, circling.Cams breath was coming faster now, his movements a little erratic as he lost control.Fuck, thats hot, Tate.Come for me.And it didnt take much longer, as the orgasm started in her spine and then radiated into the rest of her body and out to her limbs.She bit down on her other hand to hold in the cries, and Cam shoved his face into her shoulder, his grunts and muttered curses bleeding into her skin.He didnt pull out right away, instead he stayed inside her, nudging her sensitive skin with shallow, gentle rocks.Shed forgotten about this.Or maybe shed blocked it out of her mind.Because this was always the best part of sex with Cam.The way he kept them together as they both came down, as the aftershocks of their orgasms faded.Like he didnt want to leave her yet.Like he wanted to crawl inside her and stay there.She rubbed his back with her hands and up into his hair, sliding her cheek against his.Her skin would probably show the evidence of the contact with his stubble tomorrow, but she didnt care.Finally, he pulled out, got rid of the condom, and then crawled back beneath the sheets.He enclosed her in his arms, her head resting on the hot skin of his chest over his heart.You break me, Tate, his rocky voice said.She kissed his skin.And you put me back together.He squeezed her shoulders and as she was falling asleep, she realized she hadnt shed a tear.CAM BLINKED IN the darkened light of Tates bedroom, sensing an odd light in the room.He could hear something clicking, like nails on tile, and something else ...He reached a hand out for Tate but she wasnt in the bed with him.A roll of his head showed the time was three a. m.  What the hell?He rubbed his eyes, and the other sounds became clearer.Heavy breathing.And muffled sobs.He shot up straight in bed and looked over to the TV.Utope was on, and he could see the back of Tates head, her hair pulled up into a messy ponytail.Another sob ripped from her throat, and he scooted across the bed as the scene on the TV became clear in his head.Tates avatar was in their bedroom.And she was screaming while she ripped down every New York City poster off their walls, and then she hauled them into the fireplace and screamed and stomped her feet some more as they ignited.Until all that remained were the blank walls.Louder sobs from Tate on the floor and then she reared back her arm, like she planned to toss the controller through the TV.It had been weeks ago when he prevented her from throwing her phone and he would prevent this, too.He stretched out an arm and gripped her wrist.She gasped in surprise, struggling a bit until she whipped her head around to face him.And then she crumbled.Like a puppet with the strings cut.Her whole body slumped to the floor, and Cam had to slide off the bed to catch her so she wouldnt hit her head.She lay sprawled in his lap, crying, sobbing, falling apart like hed never seen her before.His chest tightened and if he hadnt felt the overriding need to prop her up, he would have been right there on the floor sobbing with her.Because Teds cancer was back.And Tate wasnt coming with him.He cradled her and rocked her and made soothing noises he didnt know he was capable of.He didnt tell her it was going to be all right.He didnt make one single promise except to tell her he loved her.He hoped it was enough.When her sobs had died, and her breath was interrupted with intermittent hitching, she leaned back and cupped his face.He raised his hands and swiped her cheeks with his thumbs.Her gaze searched his face before resting again on his eyes.No lies this time.No smokescreens.Just me in front of you with my heart splitting open telling you that I cant go.It hurt.Those words.He didnt trust himself so all he said was I know.And you might be thinking Im doing the same thing.That Im making a decision for someone else but Im not.This is a decision for me.A selfish decision, because I want to be with my dad for as long as he has left.Her laugh was sad.But its a sadistic and masochistic decision at the same time, isnt it?And I guess its no different than the last time.Im breaking both our hearts again.Cams head was spinning, because there was so much to say.But youre keeping the job.He jerked back.What?Her face was set.Youll keep the job.And youll go and do what youve always wanted to do.Thats the way its going to be.He didnt want to get into it now.He had his own decisions to make.But they werent decisions to be made at three in the morning while he sat on the floor with a devastated Tatum, while a fire fueled by tourist posters raged on the TV behind them.So he ignored her command.Well, I didnt see it coming, what happened to your dad.But this news?I saw it coming as soon as I got the call from Jamie.So maybe thats why Im not losing my shit right now.Or maybe its because Im tired.Or maybe its because your avatar looks like a nut job stomping her feet.On the TV, Tates avatar continued to wave her arms and holler.Tate turned back to him, a smile starting to creep onto her face.I was pretty upset so I dialed up her emotions.I can tell.Cam pulled out the ponytail holder holding up her mass of hair and finger combed it into some order, then pulled it back up into a neater ponytail.Tate sat passively in his lap, her eyes half closed.He used to comb her hair for her sometimes in high school.Of course, he never would have admitted it to his friends, but there was something about touching the strands and massaging her scalp that calmed him as much as her.He gestured toward the TV.Can we douse the fire so you dont burn our house down, and go back to sleep?She glanced at the TV.I think the dogs are upset.He huffed out a laugh.Come on, Tate.She grabbed a fire extinguisher and put out the fire, then turned off the game and crawled back into bed, where Cam waited with open arms.She nestled into his chest.My heads killing me now.Crying?She nodded.He remembered.She hated crying.Sometimes the headache even turned into a migraine.You want to take a couple of pills?Nah, thats okay.She yawned.Just need to sleep, I guess.And worry about everything else tomorrow.He smoothed his hand down her back.Yeah, guess so.He waited until Tates breaths evened out, her face slackened as she slept.But Cam was wide awake now, seeing that fire like a ghost image in front of his eyes.Because no matter what Tate thought, he still had a decision to make.At the moment, it was black and white, but Cam wanted to scratch and claw below the surface, to see if there was a gray area he was missing.He was still digging when he felt himself drift into sleep along with Tate.17      CAM SHOVED AN extra shirt into his book bag and then put his hands on his hips, surveying his room, making sure he didnt forget anything.His mom sat on the bed, smoothing the comforter with her hands.Camilo, I know once you make a decision, thats it.Thats final.But  Mom, we talked about this.Over and over again.But its done.I made the call already.She pursed her lips.I wasnt talking about that.I was talking about not telling Tate.He clenched his jaw and stared at his book bag.Yeah, that was the one rare decision he wasnt so sure about.Looking back, he should have talked to Tate first.He had two options.Tell her and discuss his decision with her while she went off the rails and yelled at him.Or say fuck it, make the call himself and then spend this night showing her how good they were together before telling her what hed done.He went with the latter.And he still wasnt sure it was the right decision.But what was done was done.Because his hands were bloody from digging, and he hadnt found any gray.He shook his head.Im not sure.But its done.His mothers gaze roamed to his stuffed book bag.What did you tell her about tonight?Cam remembered his battery operated radio.He pulled it down from the top shelf of his closet and stuffed it in a side pocket of his bag.I told her I want to take her camping, like we used to do.Just the two of us away from all the stress.His mom wasnt happy with him.He knew that.But this was his life now.So all she did was sigh.What did she say to that?Cam winced.Because Tate had smiled and acted excited but the whole thing had felt forced and false.Didnt she know he could see through all that?But he didnt call her on it.She had a lot on her mind.Her dad was home from the hospital now, and shed spent a lot of time making sure he was comfortable.Jamie took off tonight to stay home with him so Cam could take Tate out.So maybe she was nervous about leaving her dad.Cam was going to go with that, because it made me feel better than to think Tate didnt want to be with him.Itd been a week and he hadnt seen her or talked to her much.There was a huge river between them, and Cam wasnt strong enough to swim through the current.Camilo?his mom asked.What?Had she asked him a question?She smiled tightly.Nothing.You doing okay?Her smile was genuine this time.You know I am.You dont mind that I wont be home until morning?She shook her head.Of course not.Her eyes narrowed a little.But be safe.We get cell service out there  She raised her eyebrows.I wasnt talking about that kind of safe.He rolled his eyes.For Gods sake, Ma, Im twenty three.I know to use condoms.She laughed.Hey, Im your mother.And its my job to tell you that.He waved her off.Right, right.She probably didnt want him to get Tate pregnant.That would just be a cherry on top of this sundae.She stood up slowly.You need any more help with dinner?Nah, I packed everything we need.Thanks for making the chicken salad.She patted his shoulder.I know how much Tate likes it.Yeah, she does.He fidgeted with the strap of his bag and then hauled it over his shoulder.Wish me luck.She wrapped her arms around him and kissed his cheek.Good luck, sweetie.On the way out the door, he grabbed the cooler with their dinner.His moms special chicken salad with kaiser rolls, cut fruit, sweet potato chips, and turtle brownies.All Tates favorites.When he pulled into her driveway, a curtain moved to the left of the door, so he knew hed been spotted.He waited a minute and was about to get out of his truck when Tate stepped out of the front door and closed it behind her.She stood on the porch, bag clutched in her hands, staring at him while biting her lip.He wanted to rush to her and grab her in his arms, but this had to be her decision, to come to him.To want to be with him.She swayed on her feet and then with a jolt, like shed made her decision suddenly, she jogged down the stairs and to his truck.She threw her bag in the bed along with the rest of the camping gear and then hopped up into the passenger side.After she was buckled in, she looked at him.Her eyes were clear for the first time in a week.And he began to feel hopeful.She smiled at him.Okay, Im ready.He returned her smile.Bug spray?Check.Toilet paper?Check.Bear Mace?Ch Her eyes narrowed and she glared at him.He laughed.You know bears are rare where we camp.She pointed a finger at him.See, silly me, but Im hung up on this word rare.He began to back out of her driveway.I got my gun in the glove box.She looked horrified.You cant shoot a bear!He peeled off down her street.Tatum, if there is a choice between being mauled by a bear, or shooting it, Im going to fucking shoot it.What if its a mommy or something?
