When one of the twins said that I looked like a shake rag after a full days dusting, I was able to laugh with her, knowing full well that I would get no scolding from Mrs.Goodbody for my grubby appearance.Indeed, how should I look after a berry picking expedition on a warm summers day?For though I am normally neat as wax (as Mrs.Goodbody often says with pride) I am also quite capable of becoming a deal more bedraggled than my younger sisters.And play had been the order of the day.Mrs.Goodbody had shoved the children and me firmly out the door that morning, baskets and wrapped lunches under our arms, telling us to rush and get the mayberries before the birds had them, just as she had every year since I can remember.As always, too, we had eaten as many as we had picked, or so it seemed, then spent the rest of the day wading in the stream, hunting for lucky clovers, or lying in the grass feeling the sun burn warmly through our now stained muslin gowns.At such times I would think, Who could ask life for more?Then I would think of my uncertain future and a slight shiver of fear would pass through me; I would quickly force the unwelcome thought from my mind.Much better, it was, to think of the past, of my childhood filled with security and simple pleasures.It may surprise you that one left an orphan at the age of eight could honestly say that she had passed a happy childhood, yet such a person am I.  My parents died as they had lived, with calm dignity and faith, laying no burdens on the living.For all that I had loved them, they did not carry part of me with them to the grave.Do not think me heartless, for they would never have wished it.In fact, my twin sisters, now thirteen years old, cannot remember either parent; for their arrival in the world had been the occasion of my mothers departure from it and my father had outlived her by only two years.Before his death, Father had been private secretary to Admiral Barfreston and we had lived in a cottage on the admirals estate, Barfrestly.After Fathers death, Admiral Barfreston had continued to let us remain in the cottage, even sending his own housekeeper, Mrs.Goodbody, to live with us, providing her with a modest portion of the estates revenue for our care.Admiral Barfreston had been a kind though absentminded guardian.When we did attract his occasional notice, he would toss us a sixpence and tell us to be good children.Unfortunately, we must have slipped from his erratic memory at the crucial moment when he made his will.Thus we had been left unprovided for when he died that September.This time I was old enough to understand the implications of being left penniless and unprotected and Im afraid that I embarrassed Admiral Barfrestons austere lawyer with a hug of gratitude upon learning that we could remain on at Barfrestly, at least temporarily.Temporarily had slipped into weeks and weeks into months and it seemed that we would go on forever just as we always had.On the admirals death, the estate had passed on to a distant cousin, the notorious Lord Nicholas Dearborne, Marquis of Lorne; Admiral Barfreston had never married and had not even a nephew to receive his property.And as for Lord Dearborne, they said he was so wealthy that his tenant farmers lived in houses as big as Barfrestly Manor.A gentleman of Lord Dearbornes exalted degree was hardly likely to visit a small and ramshackle estate like Barfrestly, the admirals lawyer had told us.He would probably leave the whole affair to his man of business, who would eventually sell the place.Dearborne himself was a leader in London society, a close personal friend of the Prince Regent, and indifferent, arrogant, and dangerous.So Mrs.Goodbody said, and she had that personally from the innkeepers wife, who had it from Lady Peterbys maid, who had spent one whole season in London attending to her mistress.There were other things said of Lord Dearborne, too.Once I overheard Squire Macreadys stableboys in whispered gossip, and went to Mrs.Goodbody for an explanation.What was a Paphian?She had stiffened like a fence post and snapped that the evil goings on of London dandies were not for the innocent ears of young maidens.When other sources failed, my sisters Caroline and Christa were there to provide enlightenment.They are inveterate eavesdroppers and often have the gossip.Lord Dearborne, they pronounced, spent time with wicked women.When I questioned them further I was relieved to discover that they were mercifully in ignorance of exactly what it was that he did with the wicked women.If truth be told, I had somewhat of a confused idea myself.Even though I am six years older than the twins, I dont often play big sister to them; our relationship is more that of beloved playmates.And so it had been on this warm June day as we returned home from the orchard, our hearts full of goodwill and our baskets brimming with berries, little dreaming that today something would happen to interrupt forever our present peaceful lives.Once through the orchard you can look across the now tangled jungle of a garden that Admiral Barfrestons mother had lavished such care upon and see, rising above our cottage and other outbuildings, a large timber framed mansion set between rows of chestnut and silver birch trees.It had been closed up since the death of Admiral Barfreston, and even before that only a few of its many rooms were in use.The tireless twins raced up the weedy path to the cottage, eager to show off our harvest of fruit just as I noticed Cleo disappearing around the corner of the mansion.Cleo was the twins spaniel pup and unfortunately, weve not yet been able to convince her that chickens are not placed on earth for the sole purpose of being chased around for the entertainment of wiry young dogs.As there were almost certain to be hens scratching about in front of the house at this time of the afternoon, I decided to make haste to the front yard to insure that no damage was done to the estates prime egg producers.As I rounded the corner of the house I stopped short in astonishment.There, in the driveway, was the most magnificent carriage that I had ever seen.Up until then I had thought Mrs.Macreadys shiny barouche the height of elegance, but now I saw there was a level beyond.Beneath a fine coat of recently acquired travel silt, the carriages satin smooth sides gleamed and sparkled with colorful inlay.An elaborate crest in black and red was emblazoned on its door and it was drawn by a perfectly matched team of six in a silver studded harness.Several bewigged liverymen, formally garbed in matching red and black uniforms, were standing at attention.Not being one to call a pigeon a peacock, I must admit that I gaped like a yokel.I was so engrossed in gawking at this equipage, which compared favorably with my imaginings of Cinderellas coach, that until he spoke I didnt even notice the stylishly dressed young man standing not four yards from me.Sweet Jesus, Nicky, will you look at that?I swear Id have spent less time in London lately if Id known the Kentish milkmaids had become so devilishly beautiful.Startled, I looked around me for the beautiful milkmaid, then gasped as the young man walked over to me and slid an arm firmly about my waist, pulling me close against his chest.Looking into the hard features above me, I recognized Lord Lesley Peterby from Petersperch; the Peterbys acres marched with the squires.I had not had any social intercourse with the Peterby family, for Id as likely chat with the Archangel Gabriel, but I had several times seen Lord Peterby riding through the countryside on his visits to Petersperch.If the Marquis of Lorne was notorious, Lord Peterby was so disreputable that his name wasnt even mentioned (at least it wasnt supposed to be).He was, as they say, not received locally, and spent most of his time in London where they are more broadminded.Lord Peterby was reputedly the despair of his well liked and respectable mama, and was popularly credited with having driven his long suffering papa to death with his dueling, gambling, and preoccupation with low company.Before I had time to collect my scattered wits, Lord Peterby had reached his other hand up to the collar of my gown, pulling it carefully aside to caress the base of my neck.I heard the twins come racing into the yard, their voices shrill with excitement.Mrs.Goodbody, come quick!Theres a London dandy in the yard and hes trying to steal Lizzies virtue!At that Lord Peterby let out what in a less elegant person would have been a yelp, and released me with such suddenness that I fell back to sit down hard on the drive.I saw then that my release was not due to the twins, but to Cleo, who had rushed across the yard to sink her sharp teeth firmly into His Lordships ankle in a gallant effort in my defense.Of course, I should have done then what any other girl with the least pretension to gentility would have done: fainted.Regrettably, ones spur of the moment responses are not so easily controlled, and it was not my gentility that won the day, but my sense of humor.Lord Peterbys unsuccessful attempts to free his polished Hessians from Cleos determined attack brought my choked laughter bubbling to the surface.Once, when the sextons wife had reproved me for laughing during choir practice, the vicar had told her to let me laugh, for Elizabeths laughter charms like moonbeams on water.But Lord Peterby certainly looked in no mood to appreciate its charm.Caro scooped the wriggling Cleo into her arms where she barked indignantly at being snatched from the best sport she had seen all week.Her excited little face made me laugh all the harder.So there I sata crumpled heap in the dirt, shouting with laughter as Mrs.Goodbody came running across the yard.Jolly tears streaming down my face, I looked, I fear, as vulgar as a barmaid in a Rowlandson etching.Though Mrs.Goodbody could see that I had not been hurt, there was no diminution of her white hot wrath.How dare you, young good for naught?she rounded on Lord Lesley Peterby.Do you think this is London?No doubt there are the sort of women there who would welcome your insulting advances, but this is Kent, my lad.Decent women live here.If you ever so much as touch my lamb again, I will take a full account of your actions to your mamawho is a fine woman, well you know it, and would never sanction such rakings in her own village.Ill bet its been a while since someone threatened to tell his mother on Lord Peterby, I thought to myself.And whats more, I will bring an account of your behavior to the Marquis of Lorne, continued Mrs.Goodbody, obviously determined to brazen it out in fine style, who now owns this estate!Whatever Mrs.Goodbody had planned to say next was interrupted by a titter from inside the coach.There was a movement of one of the satin window curtains and then it was pulled aside to reveal a previously hidden occupant.If this carriage was Cinderellas coach, the feminine occupant could easily have passed for Cinderella herself.Her smartly coiffed blond hair cascaded onto a slender, creamy neck which shone with jewels.And her gown!The neckline was so low that it later led Christa to remark, to Mrs.Goodbodys horror, that shed been afraid they would fall out.Dragging my eyes away from the amazing dcolletage, I saw that it would be impossible, as well, to find fault with her face.Long and surprisingly dark lashed brown eyes, wonderfully pink cheeks, and bright red lips combined to make her look rather like an exquisite china head doll.Mrs.Goodbody can snort and say pretty is as pretty does but to me, uninitiated into the mysteries of rouge pots and mascara, she was unquestionably lovely.The vision shook a ringed finger at Lord Peterby and gurglingly reproved: Here now, Lesley, dont be handling Nickys inheritance before he has had a chance to examine it himself.Lord Lesley began shaking the country dust off his trousers, and flicked an imaginary speck from his embroidered waistcoat.Mrs.Goodbody was still drawn up like a bow ready to be sprung, the light of battle in her eye.Now dont go aiming at me again, my good woman.You can see the chit is none the worse off, observed Lord Peterby drily, glancing at my laughing countenance.No thanks to you!snapped Mrs.Goodbody.Now take yourself and your lady friend off before I take it upon myself to inform His Lordship of your conduct here.He would welcome no debaucher on his lands!The lady in the carriage tittered again, then said: A ha, Lesley, that you cannot deny.Nicky has never liked another man poaching on his preserve.Have you, Nicky?She leaned even further out of the coach as she spoke and fluttered the sooty lashes at another man, who had been leaning his long, graceful body against the shadowed side of the coach, his arms folded negligently before him.I had not noticed him in all the excitement; he stood in a shadowed position; but as he straightened and stepped into the sun I saw immediately that he was not a man who could go long unnoticed in any company.He could have posed for a Greek god in a Botticelli painting.The sun shafted off his red gold hair, which fell in shining curls to brush his broad shoulders.His beautifully molded features were set in an expression of sardonic indifference, and the clear blue eyes that swept briefly over us were the coldest Id ever seen.Instead of being robed in classical tradition, the Botticelli god wore riding clothes so expertly fitted to his slender, powerful frame that even my inexperienced eye could judge them as having been made by no provincial tailor.Even his name was Greek; Nicky, the lady in the carriage had called him.I think it means something to do with victory.You are Mrs.Goodbody?asked the stranger curtly.Aye, tis, assented Mrs.Goodbody warily.I wasnt aware that you had any daughters.He was frowning slightly.Daughters?To be sure, I have notthe Good Lord didnt see fit to bless Joe and me with youngsters of our own and Joes been gone these fifteen years now Daughtersyou think Miss Elizabeth here?I should say not!Why the very idea!Miss Elizabeth is quality!Shes here under the protection of Admiral Barfreston, sir.Mrs.Goodbody spoke with such conviction that I half expected the admirals shade to appear forthwith, rapier in hand, to offer me protection.The thought made me giggle.The golden haired man raised his eyebrows slightly and came over to stand above me.Reaching out one long, shapely hand, he grasped my elbow and dragged me easily to my feet.I flushed under his insolent gaze, which played over my body with the dispassionate appraisal of a cattle judge on fair day.Shes quality, I agree, sneered the hateful stranger.He turned to Mrs.Goodbody.But I was under the impression that Admiral Barfreston was a man in his eighties?For a moment I was afraid that Mrs.Goodbody would pop out the buttons of her dress, with such rage did her bosom swell.Nothing of the sort, sir!The admiral was a fine Christian gentleman, and Miss Elizabeths father was employed by him as a secretary.When he died, orphans they were leftpoor little Elizabeth only eight years old, and Caroline and Christa not out of nappies.And the admiral supported the dears like his own.These are good, innocent children, sir, and know naught of evil.Mrs.Goodbody stopped, as though a thought had suddenly occurred to her.Might I ask your name, sir?Nicholas Dearborne, he said shortly.Poor Mrs.Goodbody.To say that she was dismayed would much understate the case.My sister Christa, who was supposed to know naught of evil, didnt help matters by pointing at the lady in the carriage and piping: Then that must be a wicked woman.Mrs.Goodbody shot her a look that boded ill for the miscreant twin, though I saw Lord Dearbornes lips twitch in spite of himself.You had to admit that the man had presence, but I cared not for his arrogant, commanding air.I imagined he would throw the lot of us off what was now his property with no further ado.He certainly looked capable of doing so.If that was intended, however, he gave no sign of it but calmly began to question Mrs.Goodbody about the condition of the manor house.How long since it had been in use?How much work was necessary to make it habitable?How many servants were needed to operate it?Could she acquire servants from the village?It seemed Milord was coming to stay for a time!When he announced that he was bringing along his ward, it was too much for Christa.She had obviously decided that since she was already in trouble, there was nothing to lose by questioning the marquis further.Mr.Marquis, sir?Is your ward a boy or a girl?Hes a boy, said the marquis, indifferently.Is he an orphan?she pursued.Yes.Im sure she would have asked more if the more cautious Caro hadnt dug her elbow into her sisters ribs and told her to hush.The lady in the carriage again leaned out and said petulantly: Do hurry and complete your domestic business, Nicky darling.I vow Im eager to relax and refresh myself in that excellent inn Lesley has been promising us.One moment more, Cat, said Lord Dearborne, over his shoulder.Mrs.Goodbody, Lord Barfrestons solicitor will call on you this evening and he has been instructed to advance you whatever sums you need to make the manor livable.Hire whatever help you find necessary.Just dont economize.The place looks half eaten by dry rot and Ive no desire to wake one morning with the ceiling collapsed.Oh Your Lordship, the girls here, began Mrs.Goodbody.Ill discuss that with you when I return next week.In the meantime you may continue as you see fit.One of the marquiss grooms brought up a handsome Arabian stallion and the marquis swung himself lightly into the saddle.To my surprise, he brought the mincing stallion alongside me.He reached down and carelessly flicked my cheek with one long finger.Dont look so dismayed, sweetheart, he drawled.I daresay something can be arranged.I felt Mrs.Goodbody place a protective arm around my shoulder as we watched the visitors depart.Somehow I knew that I would dream that night of cold blue eyes.It may surprise you to learn that I, dependent upon charity as any pauper in the workhouse, am actually the granddaughter of a duke.But I am more fortunate than my grandfather was, for it is better to be poor and face that honestly than to be poor and grow monstrously in debt pretending to the life style of a feudal baron.Grandfather was too encased in pride to admit that the revenues of his lands could no longer support him in the luxury that had been the lot of his family for generations.It must be from him that I inherit my ability to view the future with tranquil optimism.This characteristic gives my nature a buoyancy welcome in stressful times, but can as easily become a weakness.And so it was with Grandfather.He ignored the rapidly worsening state of his finances until his creditors lost patience and announced that he must bring his ship about or sail no more upon the River Tick.Grandfather panicked and fled the country, abandoning not only his debts but also his sixteen year old son, who later became my father.The moneylenders, taking revenge through the only avenue open to them, threw my father into debtors prison.I can only imagine what he suffered there because he discussed those days with no one.I knew only that he contracted jail fever, leaving him with the damaged heart that finally caused his death.It is to Admiral Barfreston that Father owed his last happy years.The admiral, the dukes last loyal friend, convinced the dukes creditors to drop the charges against my father.He then brought my father to Barfrestly and employed him as his secretary, a post that was never more than a polite fiction.My mother was a governess on the Peterby estate when she met my father.She taught French to Lord Peterbys older sistersLord Lesley was only in the nursery at the time.The vicar, who prides himself on having introduced my parents, says that my mother reanimated the gentle shell my father had become.Her gifts of joy and laughter were a healing balm to my fathers broken spirit.That is the way I remember her, laughing with such delight that all the world rejoiced with her.I love to watch the twins at play, for they are so like her they bring her back to me.She was French, and had borne her own measure of grief.Though she had been sent from France before the Terror reached its peak, her own parents heads had been part of the gruesome feast of Madame Guillotine.Nevertheless, it was my own trials that beset me as I walked to the church the next morning.Wed had little enough claim on the admiral, and we had none at all on the Marquis of Lorne.News has wings and the whole parish knew every detail of Dearbornes visit before we had even entered the churchyard.Mrs.Blakslee, the innkeepers wife, was the first to identify my Cinderella as Lady Catherine Doran.She was the marquiss current mistress, as Mrs.Blakslee, who hadnt been born yesterday, could judge from the sleeping arrangements.My Fine Lady made sure that her bedchamber was right next to Lord Dearbornes.Shameful, I call it!The very name of womanhood dragged through the dirt!And my John was the one to see that hussy sneak into His Lordships room, bold as a mare in season!Mrs.Plumford, the sextons wife, gave a snort.Possibly, but I fear we must ask ourselves if these are meet matters to discuss on the threshold of the Lords house, and in hearing of such tender ears as well.That last was said with a significant glance in my direction.Oh, Amelia, you and your prudish pecking.Do tell, Mrs.Goodbody, have you seen the solicitor yet?queried Mrs.Coleman, the apothecarys lively wife.To be sure.Last evening he called at the cottage.The purse isnt skimpy for fixing up the estate, and that house is going to get the cleaning Ive been itching to give it all these years.Can you spare Jane to give a hand?Wed do well to have the extra shillings.But understand that when that rakish Lord Dearborne arrives I want her straight home.My Janes virtue is worth more than all the money in the Bank of England.She leaned closer to Mrs.Goodbody.Has mention been made of providing for your three dear lambs?I broke gaily into the conversation: I dont care if he tosses me off his lands on my ear.Ive an education, thanks to the kind offices of the vicar, and Ill become a governess like my mother was.This show of bravado was as much to convince myself as my listeners.I longed to chase away the apprehension that tapped at my shoulder like an unwelcome stranger.Id like to know what matron would put a gal your age in a responsible position like the care of children?sniffed Mrs.Plumford.Privately, I wondered the same thing.But I said, Oh, the mysterious ways of the adult world.They wont hire you unless you have experience, but how will you ever get experience unless you are hired to begin with?Mrs.Goodbodys frown informed me that Id been pert.I hastily begged pardon, for I dont like to give anyone offense.There was a stir of interest in the assembled throng as two men alighted from a gig that had just pulled into the churchyard.Who can that be with old Dr.Lindham?Why, tis his new assistant, a Dr.Brent, I believe.Trust Mrs.Plumford to know all the doctors business.She was a small scale hypochondriac and commanded Dr.Lindhams services more than anyone else in the village.Dr.Lindham threaded his way to our circle with the new assistant in tow.Bowing, for he liked to think of himself as a ladys man, he presented Dr.Brent, whos come to relieve my old bones from handling all the complaints of you charming ladies.We charming ladies greeted the sally with the obligatory giggling disclaimers as Dr.Brent took the hand of each lady in turn.He was a harsh featured man in his late thirties with an air of calm self possession.There was a vaguely military air about him, though Im not sure whether it came from his ramrod posture or the thin, undisfiguring scar that ran across his left cheek.His dark hair was graying slightly at the temples and I remember thinking that he looked too distinguished to be a mere country doctor.He bowed over my hand with practiced grace.To my surprise he did not release it immediately, keeping it prisoner in his own a moment longer than courtesy permitted.Charming, he breathed.His smile softened eyes caressed my face with surprising intimacy.What in the Creators name!I almost snatched my hand away.Dr.Brents behavior had been as overfamiliar in its subtle way as Lord Peterbys.Or so it appeared to me, but I have no experience with masculine attentions and perhaps refine too much on a simple compliment.I was left with a feeling of unease and could only be grateful when the sexton opened the church door and called us in to worship.*** Unease was to be my close companion that week.Like an uninvited guest it hovered beside me, defying my efforts to banish it.I was grateful for Mrs.Goodbodys practical comfort.She kept me busy until I dropped into bed at night, so tired that sleep came as soon as I drew the quilt to my chin.Had I been given time to mope I assuredly would have done so, for at the time I thought that this uncertainty was the most difficult thing that life could hand me.On Monday morning the attack began.Armed with buckets and brushes of every description, under the ruthless generalship of Mrs.Goodbody, we marched upon the manor house determined to clean or die.And our valiant little regiment had won a heroic battle by Friday afternoon.My own assignment, the admirals favorite sitting room, looked fresh as a spring hay crop.For all that the carpet was threadbare in spots and the draperies yellowed, at least the detestable marquis could not sneer that his new house was dirty.I stepped back for a satisfied view of the gilded mirror that Id just polished and suddenly noticed my face reflected back at me.Id never seen my face in any mirror before save for a handglass that Caro had won by tossing balls through a hoop at last years church fair.The glass on that mirror was so badly warped that it made my nose look perched between my eyebrows, a vastly comical effect.The sitting room mirrors glass was flawless though, and I could see every detail of my face.How curious it is that I should look so unfamiliar to myself.I suppose thats because Im used to being on the inside looking out instead of on the outside looking in.I recalled the strange behavior of the doctor and Lord Peterby with their male assessments of me as beautiful and charming.The thought disturbed me as I studied the face of the girl in the mirror with detachment.Hair the palest blond curled riotously around an oval shaped face.The violet eyes appeared huge above the other small features, glowing luminously against the white skin that would never tan.Ruefully I remembered Olivias wry catalogue of her features in Twelfth Night: Item: two lips, indifferent red; item: two gray eyes, with lids to them.I turned away, wanting no closer acquaintance with the pale young woman in the mirror.It is unnerving to think that there is part of me, unseen by myself, that is exposed to all who look at me.I heard the reassuringly normal voices of my sisters in the hallway and called them in to me, longing for their cheerful nonsense to distract me from my unsettling introspection.Have you no mercy on the handiwork of poor Arachne?I asked Caroline, gently brushing a cobweb from her hair.Weve been cleaning up the servants quarters for the marquiss London servants.There were hundreds of spiders!Mrs.Blakslee says theyll be snottier than their master.She grinned.The servants, not the spiders.Just think, hes bringing a cook, a valet, and two grooms.Barfrestly will be tricked out as fine as the squires place.Whos Arachne?asked Christa impatiently.She was not one to let things go unexplained.Why, she was a lady who lived in Greece long ago, who made such beautiful woven cloth that she became known all over Greece for it.But she became conceited and bragged that she could weave better than the Goddess Minerva herself.Did Minerva punish her for being proud?Indeed she did.She put her finger on Arachnes forehead as a mark of shame.Poor Arachne went mad from the misery and hung herself and would have died if Minerva had not pitied her and turned her into a spider to spin forever.What a horrid story.Was Minerva always so cruel?wondered Caro.Ah, I can tell you stories of her that will turn the very blood in your veins to ice water.I made my voice low and breathless as I settled myself down on the faded carpet.Yes, Lizzie, do!No one can tell a tale like you.Christa shivered in delighted anticipation and flopped down on her stomach to gaze at me with her chin nestling on her upturned palms.Caro lay on her back with her head resting on my knee, her wheat colored curls spreading across the skirt of my apron.Thus we sat as I spun the enraptured pair a yarn of ancient gods and heroes.By the time my fancy has played with mythology the plot little resembles the original, and if my sisters ever aspire to classical scholarship I fear they will have volumes of material to unlearn.and then Cupid and Psyche lived happily ever after, I finished.I had put my hand out to stroke away the hair fallen across Caros forehead when a slight movement drew my attention to the doorway.There stood Nicholas Dearborne.Even through my alarm I was struck by the impact of his incredible male beauty.It was as if one of the heroes from my fractured mythology had somehow overcome the boundaries of space and time to join us.Whatever he thought of our trespass was not revealed as he studied me.I think that if he had not been blocking the doorway, I would have risen and scampered through it like a frightened fox.With great relief I heard Mrs.Goodbodys firm tread in the hall beyond.Good afternoon, Your Lordship.Joe Hawkins fetched me from the dairy to tell me you was come.She stepped into the room and quickly took in our confused embarrassment as we stumbled to our feet.Your Lordship wont mind the girls, Im sure.They were just finishing up their chores and will be running along so as not to bother Your Lordship.Taking hasty advantage of Mrs.Goodbodys tactful dismissal, I gathered my cleaning rags and followed the twins out of the room without a backward glance.What had the marquis thought, coming into the library to discover my sisters and me thus?Probably, he thought we were making pretty free of his newly acquired house.Milkmaids in the parlor; what next?I wondered dejectedly if we were to be evicted from our little cottage and if poor Mrs.Goodbody would be given the unhappy task of telling us.I believed that it would be even more painful for her than for us.I climbed up the well scrubbed stone steps into the cottage and took refuge in the accustomed task of preparing dinnera boiled neck of mutton.The twins came in carrying a bucket of water between them just as I was testing my crusty buns for doneness.Watch what youre doing, Caro.There, now see what youve done, sloshed water all over my skirt.Say, whats that smell?Christa plunked down her end of the bucket to lift the lid of the cooking pot and sniff cautiously.Ugh, mutton again?You should thank the Lord for what He provides, my girl, said Mrs.Goodbody.She ducked her head slightly to pass through the low doorway and came over to give me a motherly kiss on the cheek.You can put your mind at rest now, Elizabeth, the admiral didnt forget you children after all.Before he died, he told his solicitor that he wanted his heir to continue to support you so that you could remain here as you always have!I was too relieved even to speak and sank down limply onto a convenient three legged stool.Caro continued to set the table with childish unconcern and asked Mrs.Goodbody casually why the solicitor hadnt told us all this before, just after Admiral Barfrestons death, because then Lizzie wouldnt have had to worry herself about it like a toad on a hot stone.Mrs.Goodbody answered her before I had time to refute so unflattering a comparison.Well, perhaps the solicitor didnt feel that he could reveal that to us before he discussed the affair at length with the marquis.Not wanting to raise false hopes, you see?To tell the truth, girls, I didnt want to query too closely, not wanting to tease His Lordship.Lord Dearborne has been more than generous.Why, hes more than doubled the allowance the admiral made for you!I hope that means we can have something besides mutton for dinner once in a while, said Christa, unimpressed.Did you find out anything about the orphanyou know, the one that is the marquiss ward?His Lordship stayed the last few days at Petersperch and rode over here on his stallion.A nasty brute that stallion is, too, so Joe Hawkins says.Thats all very interesting, Mrs.Goodbody, but what about the orphan?pressed Christa with a lamentable absence of manners.I was coming to that.The boy will arrive tomorrow in the coach from London, the one thats bringing the marquiss London servants.Oh, I hope the carriage is that lovely one that was here before, with the wicked woman in it, said Caro.Youre not too old to have your mouth washed out with soap, young lady, and so it will be if youve a mind to continue talking piggish, admonished Mrs.Goodbody with unruffled placidity.Oh dear.In all the bustle I forgot to check up on the room for Master Christopher.Is that the orphans name?I wish we had known earlier, then we could have made a sign that said Welcome, Christopher or some such thing.Never mind, Christa, said her twin, consolingly.The room looks perfect as is.You dont have to worry about a thing, Mrs.Goodbody, because Christa and I did the thoroughest job on his room.We even repainted that set of toy soldiers thats been up in the attic all these years, and Joe Hawkins put new straw ticking into our old rocking horse.Christopher will be so surprised tomorrow!Regaining my power of speech, I tried to express to Mrs.Goodbody a thought that had been floating hazily in my mind ever since she had entered the cottage.Mrs.Goodbody, isnt it wrong for us to take money from someone were not related to?I mean, strictly speaking, we werent related to the admiral either, but that seemed different.Mrs.Plumford says Now dont be tellin me what Mrs.Plumford says because that woman never had a teapots worth of sense in her life, and so everyone in the village knows.The idea!A sextons wife telling a dukes granddaughter whats proper!Your blood is just as good as the Marquis of Lornes.Maybe you werent raised in a fancy house like you ought to have been, around your own kind, but true ladies you are for all that, and so I told My Fine Lordship.It was a picture to command awe, Mrs.Goodbody telling His Fine Lordship that three country wenches in berry stained gowns living in his back cottage were true ladies.The potatoes boiled over then, which is always a real conversation silencer, and we were eating dessert before Christa brought up the subject of our new benefactor again.I wonder what a man like the marquis is doing at Barfrestly.Hes got much nicer houses to live in than this, they say.Why come here?Mrs.Goodbody shook her head, frowning.I dont knowperhaps its to fix up the place before he sells it.He did mention something about men coming from London to do some work here.At any rate, its not for us to speculate about how the marquis spends his timeso dont go popping your nose into his affairs, Christa.Now promise, petwe dont go snoopin into the marquiss business, all right?Mrs.Goodbody paused in the act of serving out the mayberry pie, remembering another piece of good news.Its to be new clothing from London for you girls!The marquis has had orders sent to some hoity toity dress shop in London so youll be dressed as is fitting for your station.Lord Dearborne says it is high time you were dressed as proper young ladies.What the marquis had actually said, as Mrs.Goodbody confided to me long afterward, was: For Gods sake, get that chit out of those rags before one of my friends mistakes her for a scullery maid and gives her a toss in the nearest haystack.Three  Red sky at night, shepherds delight; Red sky at dawning, shepherds warning.I dont know what color the sky had been at dawning but by the time I had risen from my cot the heavens had taken on a grayish ombr.The rain came on and off all morning, collecting in the worn ruts in the carriageway to make hundreds of silvery looking glasses.Lifting our long skirts to keep the hemlines dry, my sisters and I made hasty progress down the front drive during a pause in the deluge.We had decided to await Christophers arrival in the gateway cottage where Joe Hawkins, the coachman, lived with his nine cats.Its like having eighty one cats, for they each have their nine lives, Joe would say with his huge wink.Since Cleo wasnt very sociable with felines we left her at home to comfort Mrs.Goodbody during thunderclaps.I sat musing by the window while the twins played hide and seek with the cats around the heavy old furniture in Joes parlor.We were prepared to wait all day for the coach if need be, but shortly after one oclock we heard the rumble of carriage wheels like thunder from afar.A few moments later, the carriage pulled through the gate, rain steaming off the horses backs.The looking glass puddles were shattered into crystals by the stamp of powerful hooves.The twins and I pulled woolen shawls over our heads to keep off the halfhearted drizzle and followed the marquiss impressive coach up the drive to the mansion.We watched from a wary distance as Lord Dearborne gracefully descended the front steps.The coachman pulled the team to a stop, and out steppeda handsome adolescent boy.His friendly open face was glowing with affection as he looked up at the marquis.Lord Dearborne smiled back; a warm, rich grin that penetrated through the coldness of his eyes, softening them.I felt my breath catch in my throat.Lord, who would think the old crosspatch could look so chummy?Caro whispered to her twin, sotto voce.Lo, Uncle Nicky, said the youth.Lord, brat, every time I see you youve grown another inch.I hope this wet weather hasnt dampened your young spirits any.No, sir, Im in excellent gear for all that its plaguily damp.I confess to one or two bad moments back on your drive, though.I feared the potholes in the lane were going to tip the carriage over into that jungle of undergrowth.Ive never seen such a place for rack and ruin.I hope you know what youre doing, coming here.Lord Dearborne lifted his hand, rumpled his wards hair lightly.Have faith, halfling, he said.Mrs.Goodbody joined us, puffing from her quick walk from the cottage.The smile remained with Lord Dearbornes mouth as he turned to her, though his eyes became distant.Mrs.Goodbody, may I present my ward, Christopher Warrington.And Christopher Warrington took her hand just as though she was some great titled lady, which warmed me to him right from the start.Having a little boy to fuss over had its charms, but those paled into insignificance compared with the prospect of having a lively friend of ones own age.To be sure, Your Lordship, stated Mrs.Goodbody.Twill be a fine thing to have a lad about the place.But Mr.Warrington must meet my dear charges.Theyve been looking forward to your coming, like Christmas.I stepped forward, eager to waste no more time in establishing friendships with this handsome boy whose kind brown eyes were smiling down into mine.Why, you must be as old as I.  And quite six feet tall in the bargain, I said, shyly.It would take a rocking horse big as entered Troy to hold you.It has been a few years since I rode my last rocking horse, he said with a puzzled grin.Caro and Christa came to my side, giggling.Christa told him: We were expecting a jam faced tot to mother.Wait until you see how weve fixed your bedchamber.There are toy soldiers and an old kite, along with the restuffed rocking horse.Wed even planned to take you on a picnic by Townsey Mill House tomorrow if this bothersome rain clears.I am not so ancient that I cant appreciate a good picnic.Especially in such charming company.His smile took us all in and visions of jam faced tots were banished unregretted.That was the last we were to see of Christopher that day.The twins and I had planned to walk to Squire Macreadys stables with Jane Coleman if the weather would cooperate.Indeed, before the hour was out, the determined sun began to push aside the sulky rain clouds and Janes cheerful, freckled face poked around the cottage door.One of the squires huge plow horses had just that week foaled and we spent a long while peering between the bar gates of the hay lined box stall in the corner of the stables, full of admiration for the proud mother and her frisky, dappled colt.It was almost dusk by the time we trudged back to the cottage.When we returned we found that Mrs.Blakslees predictions about Lord Dearbornes London servants had been borne out.The French chef was especially difficult.His name was Henri, and he stated that the kitchen, with its old and wheezy stove, was fit only for the cannibal feasts of a wild tribe of aborigines.Or so Mrs.Goodbody told us when she returned for a short time in the evening to assist in seeing the twins to bed.Mrs.Goodbody said only the presence of His Lordships valet, Roger, made the experience bearable.He was, said she, a fine gentleman, very proper and distinguished.Chuckling warmly, Mrs.Goodbody bid us goodnight to hustle back to the kitchen and help poor Henri clean up his mess.After she had gone, I lay in bed, listening to the happy chatter of the twins as they hugged each other under the covers in anticipation of the morrows picnic.Then their talk grew quieter, with sleepy comments coming less and less often, until their slow rhythmic breathing informed me that they had fallen asleep.The chatter of the crickets took up the conversation where they had left it, with the night birds adding faraway high cadenzas.Unable to sleep, I left my bed and walked to the window where the curtain billowed quietly like a sail in the warm night breeze.The sky had cleared, the clouds having spent their tearful sorrows and moved on.The full moon made it nearly as bright as day, with the light of the distant stars adding silvery highlights to the warm glow from the windows of Barfrestly.As I watched, many of the lamps in the mansion began to blink off, leaving only a dim glow in the library, where I supposed Lord Dearborne and Christopher to be enjoying their after dinner brandy and talk, and one in the kitchen, where Mrs.Goodbody was likely enjoying a late night discussion of London downstairs happenings with the new servants.On a whim, I pulled an old cotton gown from the wall and threw on a light shawl to protect myself from the still dampness of the night.Stirring as I was with inexplicable longing, I wished to be out in the spacious coolness of the evening.I made my way out across the moonlit garden, my bare feet sliding softly through the wet grass.As I stood in the breeze in the middle of the grounds the night sounds played a concert of which I was the only patron.Then to my surprise I observed what appeared to be a man standing directly underneath the window of the library!After some reluctance to vacate my front row seat, I decided I had better investigate, and I was nearly going to call out to the mysterious form when it vanished into a shadow.This warranted closer investigation.It didnt occur to me to be afraid; I had never been in danger in my life.When I reached the spot under the library window I found nothing but a decrepit ladder draped helter skelter with old washrags, probably left there by some lately industrious servant who had planned on resuming his labors there on the morrow.I poked at the ladder and laughed at my fancy, and turned to resume my place at the opera when a scrap of conversation floated from the open library window above my innocent head.Im glad that you decided to bring me out here, Uncle Nicky.Anne is all at sea right now, what with her husband being posted to Europe.Lord, you wouldnt believe all the fuss and botheration.Now that were out of black gloves, I daresay that Anne would use every spare minute to drag me to Almacks and a mass of other devilish places, expecting me to do the pretty to a lot of stiff rumped dowagers and their die away daughters.The speaker was, without doubt, Christopher Warrington.I heard Lord Dearborne laugh softly at Christophers morose tone.Somehow I cant picture you eschewing female companionship.He paused, and when he spoke again, his voice had become curiously gentle.Give yourself time, Kit.Yes, Christopher said quietly.Uncle Nicky, have you come any closer, yet?Since coming to Kent, I mean?Little things happen; nothing dramatic though.I wondered briefly what Lord Dearborne could be trying to come closer to and was suddenly struck by a flash of guilt.Here I was, eavesdropping, pokin my nose into Lord Dearbornes affairs against Mrs.Goodbodys emphatic prohibition.I was about to tiptoe stealthily away when I heard Christopher speak again: I know what your business is here, but what do you do here for pleasure in this season?Ride mostly.So, Christophers voice sounded amused, have you succeeded in mounting the beautiful violet eyed filly you have stabled in the back cottage?Eavesdroppers never hear any good of themselves.How often I had heard Mrs.Goodbody say that to the twins, and how crushingly true it had just proved to be.I am the worlds worst sinner.My sisters had been stealing apples all along from the Squires orchard and the one time I went along, unwillingly, we were caught.And now I had been paid off again.Id never before eavesdropped on a conversation, purposefully or otherwise; and while the twins had been getting away with it for years, on my one transgression I became the victim of humiliation.A mortified blush fanned my cheeks.If only I had stayed in bed where I belonged I might have been spared this mortification.I decided to return thence, where I would be safe from such punishing temptation.
