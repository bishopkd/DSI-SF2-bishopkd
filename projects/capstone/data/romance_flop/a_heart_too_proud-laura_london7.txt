The words blurred before my eyes and transformed themselves into visions of Sir Lesley boiling in a cauldron of bubbling oil.I relaxed and let my mind flow aimlessly upon that pleasant channel.Before the fire lay a beautiful pelt of an enormous white bear that Christopher had informed me was a gift to Lord Dearborne from a Russian diplomat.I tiptoed over and rubbed my bare toes in the soft fur.I was getting tired now, especially since having my imaginary revenge on Lord Peterby.But I had no particular desire to leave this cozy room and slide between my cold sheets.I slipped out of my heavy dressing gown to lay down on the shaggy bearskin, my loose hair spilling comfortably around me.After all, there was very little chance of anyone coming here at this time of the night, and anyway, if anyone did come, I could hear their footsteps in the corridor and easily hop up and pull on my dressing gown.That was my last thought before I fell asleep.Sometime later I felt strong arms encircle my shoulders, arms that had an endearingly comfortable familiarity about them.I snuggled closer into them and vaguely heard a low chuckle.I had a sensation of being lifted.Eventually I was aware that the cradling arms had left and I made a whimpered protest.Time to sleep, whispered a voice.When I awoke the next morning I was sure that it had been a dream, except I had gone to sleep on the library floor.Why did I wake up in my own bed?Twelve At breakfast the next morning I astonished Christopher with a long, impassioned diatribe against the blind prejudice and injustice of conventions that decreed women ineligible to fight in duels.And because men could fight in duels was precisely the reason that I didnt tell Christopher the things Lesley Peterby had said to me in the Ingrams garden.You never know but what Kit might take it in his head to do if he thought my honor had been questioned.Questioned?That adder Peterby had gone further than questioning!My memory dwelt fondly on the slap I had dealt him and I smiled privately at my own audacity.I looked at Kit across the breakfast table, where he sat in his patterned dressing gown with a Belcher scarf knotted loosely around his neck.He was gazing gloomily at the front page of the newspaper and taking small sips from a steaming coffee cup.I wondered what he would say if I asked him if hed had a ballet dancer as a mistress last year.Probably spill his coffee, drop his newspaper and stammer, Well, really, for half an hour.My favorite playmate had some pretty fancy toys.Still, it was none of my business to puff up like a Puritan about it.Briefly, too, I considered sending a note to Lord Peterby telling him that if he ever decided to jump off a cliff, I, for one, wouldnt die of heartbreak.I abandoned the idea.I could imagine the reaction of the marquiss starchy underfootman if I asked him to deliver a note to Lord Peterby for me.I knew, somewhere in my heart of hearts, that the most painful shock of last evening had been the sight of Lady Catherine in Lord Dearbornes arms.You have to be an awfully rigid moralist to deprecate a man kissing his inamorata, so I was forced to admit it was not the moral aspect of the sight that had left me with such a queasy feeling in my stomach.There was one logical explanation, but it was just too unpalatable.I wasnt jealous, I couldnt be, it was impossible, absurd.I forced myself to stop thinking about it but I was shaken, nonetheless.After breakfast, Lady Anne took my sisters and me on a shopping expedition to New Bond Street.I was glad for the chance to go.I wanted to buy a pair of silk stockings for my friend Janey Coleman.I suppose someone could have slipped the note into my reticule anytime that morning, in any of the crowded shops or busy sidewalks.Anyway, it was there when I got home.On one side of the note was a sentimental ballad, the kind ragged children sell for hapennies.But on the other, in a light, backhand scrawl: Do you want to learn more about Henris death?Tell no one about this note and come alone to the Cuckolds Comfort gin shoppe at the hour of ten tonight!There is Danger, do not Fail.There was an address at the bottom of the page, presumably that of the gin shoppe, and it was signed, simply, Bon Chance.Good luck?I thought for a moment of Pandoras box, but admitted I was more influenced by the adventures of Jason and the Argonauts.Could I turn down a teaser like there is danger?Not while there is a thimble of spirit left in me.I spent the rest of the day planning my outing.To get out of the house unnoticed, I devised a master plan of great cunning and vervewait until no one is looking and sneak out!Rope ladders are strictly for elopements.The success of the plan hinged upon being able to stay home from the theater that night.As Christopher and Anne were engaged to go with a large group of friends, they could scarcely cancel the entire party to stay home with me if I pleaded ill.I underestimated them.When I announced that I wanted to stay home to nurse a sick headache, they showed such alarming solicitude that if I ever really do get a headache, Im certainly never going to tell them!I fought off attempts to summon physicians, to burn feathers under my nose, and a dosing with a potion that Lady Anne assured me her mother had sworn by.I finally took the potion to satisfy her and let me tell you that I can see why her mother swore by it.It made me want to swear at it.Dear Mrs.Goodbody rescued me by chasing everyone out of my room, saying that I was overtired and would do very well if I could have some time to rest.She told Christopher and Anne that they would only distress me if they stayed home too.She didnt know how right she was.If she knew that she was assisting me in a gambol around London at night she would have had a fit.I chose my attire for the evening with more care than I had expended on the most fashionable gatherings.Deciding that it was best to look as inconspicuous as possible, I donned a battered gray poplin gown of preLord Dearborne days, completing the ensemble with a plain straw bonnet.Whispering a quick prayer, I sneaked down the smooth marble staircase, rather guiltily, with a petition to Vesta, protector of virgins.Once out in the street it was fairly simple to find a hackney coach to convey me to the address on the note.The jarvey shook his head when he saw the address.He followed the head shake with a long lecture on the evils of gin, going on at such length that I feared I would never reach my destination.Of all the hacks in London, I would have to get one driven by a Methodist.I am glad this Methodist knew the way because I would never have found it on my own.I stepped down in front of the Cuckolds Comfort a little early, and cast about for a while, killing time.It was the first time I had really been immersed in the streets of London, and I found it fascinating.I was not frightened, but instead felt comforted by the bustle and clamor of the crowd, which appeared to be going at full bore even though it was nearly ten oclock.I stopped for a few minutes to watch a Punch and Judy show, but gave up as it was impossible to follow the action over the full throated yelling of the throng.Ballad singers were crooning loudly and melodiously; political pamphleteers were hawking their wares from street corners and arguing venomously among themselves and with passersby.All sorts of vendors were selling all sorts of thingscats meat, cheese, tissue paper flowersto what seemed to me a largely indifferent crowd intent on brushing past each other in the greatest hurry to be somewhere else.I was somewhat shocked at the number of children on the scene, scampering through the hustle and bustle playing tag, jump the knacker, and threepenny hop.This at an hour when my sisters were safe and sound in their beds.I saw one group of naughty boys harassing the poor lamplighter, who was doing his best to keep the scene illuminated.Every time he would nearly have the flame lit on the corner, one of the boys would run up behind and yank his coattails hard enough to throw him off balance; he would lose the flame and have to start over again.I left this not unfriendly scene with some regrets, to make my way into the Cuckolds Comfort.The powerful, acrid smell and smoke of the interior set me at odds for a moment as I peered about.The place was very crowded, shoulder to threadbare shoulder, and everyone was shouting at once, just like on the street outside.The furnishings consisted of long, roughhewn wooden tables.I peered into the rough, grimy faces of the men and women near to me and received nothing back but a few uncomfortably appraising stares.It suddenly occurred to me that I didnt have the slightest idea whom I was looking for.The note had been unspecific on this point.I mentally floundered, forcing down a wave of nausea.I suppose I had envisioned a secluded, unfrequented little club, not this raw pandemonium.There was nothing to do but wait for a time and perhaps my correspondent would seek me out.I stood by the door in what I hoped was a conspicuous place.It proved to be too conspicuous.A group of three ragged looking, odoriferous men soon materialized out of the crowd to stand near to me, leering and talking in low, dirty voices.I made a sign with my fingers at them, something Christopher had taught me, and they took their attentions elsewhere.I made a mental note to learn from Christopher the exact meaning of that handy sign.The harassment was undeniably making me nervous, so I decided to sit down.Earlier, I had noticed a gabby old woman sitting in a corner who grabbed the ear of anyone who went by and talked to them unintelligibly and interminably.As a consequence, she was eventually left quite alone.I decided it would go easier for me if it looked like I was with someone; this woman was the likeliest candidate.Before joining her, I laid a coin down on the rough bar like I had seen others doing, and the bartender, after some long, jostled moments, responded by desultorily sliding a flagon of gin down to me.Little young for the old Blue Ruin, eh miss?he said.It was obvious that he would have sold the gin to a babe in arms.I appreciate your concern, I said tartly.I couldnt tell if he heard me or not.I picked up the flagon and made my way to the old woman.Sitting down next to her, I copied the slouch of the people around me and unobtrusively let fall some strands of hair from my too neat coiffure.To pass the time, I began listening with half an ear to my companion, scanning the crowd for my contact all the while.To think that I, the illegitimate daughter of Marie Antoinette, would be reduced to selling fish in the market.And damn good fish they are too, she was saying.Fish is good for a pretty young lady like yourself, aint that right?Aint that right, I say?I nodded vigorously.Yere a young woman of sense to treat me so politely.Even though I sell fish in the market I am the illegitimate daughter of Marie Antoinette.I will remember you and when I am restored to the throne of France I will reward you.You can be a lady in waiting.The appointment struck me as being a mixed blessing.Lady in waiting to a gin swilling old fishmonger sitting on the throne of France.I observed the crowd.In some ways it was not very different from those at some of the posh parties I had been to of late.They shouted the toast bung ho with the same amount of rough, brawling energy that the men of my acquaintance would shout to our gracious monarch, or some such patriotic phrase.They, too, were arguing about politics, though with a slight difference in viewpoint.But their opinions seemed to me just as valid.Everyone argues the same under the influence of hard liquor, regardless of social class.I reflected on how well rounded this experience was going to make me; I had now observed all facets of English society firsthand, low life taverns to high society balls.As time went on, though, my reflections grew more dismal.No mysterious informant appeared and I was beginning to wonder if anyone would show up at all.I knew I had been here at least an hour, for it seemed far longer.Perhaps the writer of the note was unable to keep the rendezvous.Perhaps he hadnt been able to get me a message telling me not to come.Perhaps but my head was aching so from the smoke and the noise that I didnt feel able to sort it out now.I had better just get home before anyone noticed that I was missing.Having made the decision to leave, I discovered I couldnt wait to get out of the place.I stood up abruptly, and the old woman spilled her flagon of gin down the front of my dress, muttering a drunken apology as she did so.I hastily began to make my way through the crowd.Oh, Im s sorry, miss, please come back, wailed the old woman.I am the illegitimate daughter of Marie Antoinette.Two more steps and I would be out the door.The night air felt good in my lungs.I inhaled it deeply and looked about for a hackney.There were none in sight.Furthermore, the vendors had disappeared and the crowd had thinned out alarmingly.I suppressed an uneasy feeling and decided that my best course would be to walk in the direction the hackney had come and I would eventually run into a main thoroughfare.So I embarked, using as firm a footstep as I could muster.It was best not to look irresolute to anyone who might be observing me.There were a few groups of men wandering about, some of them listing sharply, and before I walked very far, I nearly tripped over what appeared to be a pile of old clothes in the dimly lit street.The pile of old clothes grunted like a sow in the barnyard, and turned out to have human form.Oh, excuse me, I said, but the old wreck only looked at me with stark terror in its eyes and shambled down the street, caroming occasionally off a lamppost.I walked on, hoping my thoroughfare was around the next bend.The bend turned out to be a twist, then a jog, and I began to realize it was impossible to walk directly to anything in this section of London.I paused for a moment to ascertain my bearings, but walked on when I noticed a man in a doorway to my left flipping a dagger over and over in his hand, the blade glinting in the light from the lamp on the corner.There seemed to be another tavern up ahead; I could ask for directions there; but when I reached it, the people sitting on the steps in front formed a wall with their eyes and I passed quickly without looking at them.It was getting very dark now.A rat skittered in front of me and I heard dripping water.It was a maze.I tried to think clearly.I couldnt bear to go back to the Cuckolds Comfort and would probably never find my way anyway; perhaps I should change direction.Off to my left was an alley, running downhill; I peered into it for signs of habitation.Perhaps that would do.I took off down it, faltering now in spite of myself as it made another sharp turn.It was so dark now I could see almost nothing.A feminine voice spoke in my ear: Its a little lost lamb strayed from the flock.Shall we help it find the way, girls?Maybe there were decent people in this horrible place after all, I thought to myself.Where are you?I said.Where are we?Where are you?echoed another voice.We are over here, said a third female voice.A hand grabbed my arm and yanked me so violently into what was probably a doorway that my teeth snapped.Let me go, I begged, unable to scream.Dont be loud, little one, we are only going to help you find your way.It would be easier to travel without this, said a womans voice.I felt my reticule being torn from my hands.And this bonnet; no need for that on a lovely night like this one.It was gone.Then to my horror, I felt my gown being ripped up the back and I was standing in my shift.Rough hands frisked me up and down.An honest little one, said a voice.No money hidden.Now you can find your way, said one of my tormentors.I was pushed out of the doorway with such force that I fell down hard on my knees.I was too frightened to sob, too frightened to move.Run away, little lamb.London is out there waiting for you, said the voice behind me now, and there was a chorus of wicked cackles.Oh my God, I thought to myself, and I began to make my way down the alley, the pain from my gashed knees making me cry out.I felt the blood running down my leg.I was away from them now and I didnt care what happened to me.I leaned against a cool, mossy wall and realized that I was shaking convulsively.Do ye have a sixpence for a poor old beggar?Someone was begging me for money.Through my haze of agitation I saw a wizened panhandler standing directly in front of me.Sorry, I said.I havent a farthing.The beggar reached out a hand and pinched my arm.Havent a farthing, he mimicked in a whining falsetto.Then ye have a wee kiss for a lonely old man.I have no such thing.I was dimly aware of a loud shouting and to do now, echoing eerily from down the alley.Ye havent a kiss for me, eh?Let me tell ye someting, miss.Thems the peep of the day boys acomin, and theyll be wantin more than a kiss.He gave me a horrid wink.The shouting was very near.May as well give me the kiss willingly now because when they are through wi the likes of you, you wont be wantin to kiss nobody.Go away, I screamed, but he was already gone.Peep of the day boys?I cringed against the wall and tried to make myself invisible.A group of six or seven men were coming around the corner, making enough hue and cry for twenty.I saw a gin bottle go flying through the air to fragment itself on the pavement.Look over there, boys.Something for George to do.I had been spotted.I pressed against the wall and hoped that George, whoever he was, was a gentleman.As they came closer I noticed the aristocratic cut of their clothes, but something about their demeanor made me wish I was elsewhere.I was now close to being surrounded, and a man who appeared to be crippled in one leg made his way toward me ahead of the others.In a daze of terror I caught a glimpse of a curly brown head and a reek of gin as he pressed me against the wall.A scream involuntarily forced its way out of my throat as I felt fumbling hands pushing my shift up from my thighs.Be good to Childe Harold, little slut.The devil Leave her alone, Gordon.I know her!A strangely familiar voice cut through the group.I said leave her, and the attacker was gone, skidding on his face down the side of the wall.That voice.In the garden.Lesley Peterby.You gents go on without me, Ill see to this one, he said.We know you will, they chorused, and I was alone with him.His eyes traveled slowly up my quivering frame, taking in every detail of my miserable condition.He shook his head slowly.I dont know what youre doing here and I dont want to know.He pulled off his light cape and I felt it flow about my shoulders.When he spoke again, it was an impatient growl.Follow me and Ill take you home.He started down the alley with a long stride and I followed him, stumbling.Once he stopped to curse, telling me to hurry or be left to the rats.One filthy, narrow street slid into another.Finally, miraculously, the street widened enough to permit traffic and I heard Lord Peterby hail an empty hackney coach.I tried to climb into the coach but the step was so high that my aching knees wouldnt respond.Peterby swore again, then lifted me bodily into the dark, smelly interior.He gave the direction of Lorne House to the jarvey and climbed in beside me, slamming the door with unnecessary vigor.I made an effort to pull myself together.Im very much obliged to you I stopped, shocked by the whimpering quality of my voice.Then for Gods sake, dont cry.I have a strong distaste for whining women.Lesley slumped into the corner with his hands crossed behind his neck, surveying me with unfriendly dispassion.Jesus, you look like someones set the dogs on you.And you reek of gin.Nicky is likely to put a bullet through me and ask questions later if I walk in the door with you in this condition.I had hoped somehow to be able to sneak into the house unnoticed; it would be impossible though, because all the doors would be locked, and I was keyless.I shuddered, imagining the scene that would meet my arrival if I waltzed into the house at midnight with Lord Lesley in tow and clad only in a torn shift.I said miserably, Perhaps you should have left me back there in the gutter.Considering the humor you were in last night I am surprised that you didnt.Ah, last night.My rescuer pulled a small metal comb out of his pocket and flipped it carelessly across the seat to me.Here, at least comb your hair.Last night I was operating under the misapprehension that you were Warringtons chre amie.Lady Cat threw that tidbit my way, the stupid jade.Today I found out, it doesnt matter to you how, that youre not one of the ladybirds that Christopher flies with.Lady Catherine!I ejaculated, my mind fastening on this piece of information.Why on earth would she tell you something like that?Probably, my innocent, because she hoped that it would give me the incentive to shall we say, force my attentions on you.His face hardened.I make love to please myself, not to further any of Cats schemes.It seemed incredible that Lady Catherine could feel any malice toward me.But why would she want to harm me?I havent met her above three times in all my life.Shes obviously seen you enough to consider you competition for your cold blooded guardian.The fool is living under the illusion that shell be able to entice Dearborne into marrying her.He smiled unpleasantly.Far from showing any inclination to declare himself, Nicholas has become rapidly bored and makes no attempt to hide it.He didnt look bored last night in the Ingrams gatehouse, I said doubtfully.Lord Lesley shrugged.That was nothing.One amuses oneself, he replied cynically.I returned the comb to him, too tired to make any further effort with my hair, which fell in a heavy snarling mass down my shoulders.But how could I be a threat to Lady Catherine?I wondered out loud.Youre not.Dearborne isnt libertine enough to take an innnocent girl under his protection as his fancy piece, nor is he going to marry a country nobody with only her beauty to recommend her.Cat needs somewhere to put the blame for her failure.She could hardly admit that there was a deficiency in her charms.I felt as though I were smothering in the clinging folds of my borrowed cape, which I had pulled closely about me for modestys sake.It was impossible to digest Peterbys remarks, so I leaned my face against the greasy window and stared disconsolately out at the dark cityscape.If only, by some miracle, I could manage to sneak into Lorne House without being observed.Well, miracles will occur only at capricious intervals.I had already had all the luck that I was going to that night, though you would think I deserved some more after what I had been through.When we reached Lorne House, Lord Lesley dragged the hood of his cape roughly over my hair, telling me it was better to try to prevent me from being recognized.He then hauled me unceremoniously from the hack and rapped sharply on the imposing doorway.The door was opened almost immediately by Roger, Lord Dearbornes valet.Lesley demanded the marquis and Roger led us to the library with a carefully wooden countenance.I was aware of Lord Dearborne but kept my eyes riveted to the floor.Lord Peterbys voice came harshly: Before you try to cut out my liver, you might as well know that Im not the one whos responsible for her present condition.I want five minutes to explain how I found her.After that you can call me out if you still want to.As you wish, Lord Dearborne sounded cool, even slightly bored.Miss Cordell, why dont you sit down?Ill return to wait on you in a moment.I walked stiffly over to the blue damask sofa, taking meticulous care to avoid glimpsing myself in the reflecting panes of the bay windows.Once seated in the luxurious splendor of the library, I felt even more bedraggled and downtrodden.Wishing I had made more assiduous use of Lesleys comb, I made a few ineffectual attempts to untangle the silky knots with my shaking fingers.Elizabeth Cordell, early Christian martyr, waiting for the arrival of the lion.When the lion returned to the room, he walked to the ornate Oriental cabinet and poured brandy from its crystal decanter into an elaborate piece of stemware.He placed the goblet on the shining kidney shaped table next to me and motioned for me to drink.When I lifted the glass to my lips, the scent of the brandy brought back the memory of cheap gin fumes.I set the glass down rather quickly.Oh no, my pet, youre going to drink that.Lord Dearborne set the goblet back into my hands.Its obvious that you are on the verge of vapors.You might find my methods of dealing with hysterical women not to your liking.The words were spoken with an almost cordial urbanity, but I wasnt fool enough to miss the underlying threat.I choked down several swallows of the burning liquid, which brought tears to my eyes in stinging waves.What an obedient girl, commented the marquis sarcastically.I could see that this interview was going to be a new low in an already hellish night.You were limping when you came in.I take it that youve injured yourself?Show me.I pulled back the cape dumbly to expose badly scraped knees.Heartrending, said Lord Dearborne in a voice totally devoid of sympathy.He took my chin between his long fingers and turned my face up to look at him.Lesley tells me that he found you clad only in your shift.Were you hurt in any other way?No, dont jerk your head away.I want an answer.No, I snapped, goaded.I wasnt hurt in any other way, as you so delicately phrase it.But I have been harassed, insulted, robbed, and humiliated in every imaginable manner tonight, on top of getting lost in a horrible jungle of a place that I thought I would never get out of.I rose with what dignity I could muster.Will that be all, Milord?Because I should very much like to retire.And cry in peace.Sit down.His voice cracked like a whip and I sat back down hastily.I watched nervously as he went back to the cabinet to bring out a clean linen napkin and a container of spring water.Perhaps youll be so indulgent as to relate the tale of your adventure?he said, coolly sardonic, and began gently to clean the muck off my knees.The last thing I was in the mood for was a verbal re enactment of my harrowing experiences, but I could see that Lord Dearborne was determined to drag it all out of me.I might as well get it over with.I told him everything, starting from the time I left the Cuckolds Comfort.I was careful to make no mention of what I was doing there in the first place.The note had been explicit that I should tell no one, and I felt myself bound by it.It had said there is danger.I had no intention of letting my loose tongue endanger anyone.After tonight danger had a whole new meaning to me.When I finished my story, I saw that if I had expected to receive any sympathy from Lord Dearborne, I might well have spared my breath.He merely remarked callously: Amazing.Youve been trotting around in an area of London which no decent woman can enter, even during the day, and a little rough treatment is all that you have to show for it.And if what youve just described includes every imaginable humiliation, then your imagination must be remarkably restrained.Naturally you are aware that youve neglected to mention what you were doing in that part of the city at night alone when the household believes you to be sleeping safely in your bed?I trust you intend to enlighten me?If I could have thought of an acceptable lie, I would have told it.What plausible reason could I have for making a solo visit to the Cuckolds Comfort?I replied weakly: I cant tell you.You went there to meet someone, didnt you?Dont bother to shake your head at mesomeone must have told you how to get there.Who are you protecting?Is it a lover, he sneered, or a traitor?I think I must have gasped because the marquis shoved the brandy glass into my hand againapparently under the misapprehension that I was beginning to sob.I swallowed the contents of the glassI would rather have expired on the spot than let Lord Dearborne see me cry.He took the glass from my hand and set it on the side table, then turned to regard me searchingly.You know, my little doe, Im not sure whether you are a very clever woman or only a pathetic dupe.I will assume, for charitys sake, that you dont realize what youre getting yourself into.This wont be the first time that one of my household has been approached by enemy agents hoping for an inside contact.There are two things that you should know.First, these are dangerous men who will not hesitate to get rid of you as soon as you cease to be of use, no matter what they may tell you now.Witness the fate of Henri, the cook, the strange accidental death you have been so interested in.Henri?Then he didnt die falling from the roof?He was murdered?I roused slightly from my state of stunned misery.Henri was strangled with a dishcloth and tossed from the roof.A pretty set of fellows you are in with.Im not in with anybody, I objected.Secondly, he continued, ignoring my feeble protest, if you are caught intriguing with the French government, there is nothing I could do to protect you from a traitors fate.A searing pain began to course through my breast.That is the most insensitive, unfeeling accusation I have ever had to endure in my life!I choked out.I was proven wrong almost immediately.Im making a terrible misjudgment of you, am I?Youre wandering around in the stews of London in the dark of night and you wont tell me who you are meeting or why?What kind of lover would ask to meet you in such a place?Even the likes of Peterby can call on you here.I would advise you to examine your associates.I am beginning to think you are a very good actress, Miss Cordell.It takes a definite toughness, not immediately visible in your character, to tryst with somebody in the stews of London.I was now goaded beyond discretion.I dont care what you think, Lord Dearborne.You may think me wanton or a traitor, it matters not a whit to me, it does not concern me in the slightest.It is obvious that people in this contemptible town believe what they wish to believe, and if you believe me to be those things, then it comes from your own purposes and desires and not my actions.My hands were clenched into fists beneath the cloak which rippled from contact with my trembling shoulders.I felt ill.And too angry now to waste energy on tears, though my eyes stupidly persisted in shedding them.I wiped a couple of the obnoxious intruders away with the back of my hand, staring defiantly at Lord Dearborne.Some of the freezing harshness left his face; it was replaced by something more rational, though speculative.He lifted his hands to rest lightly on my shoulders and when he spoke, his voice was gentle.My only purpose and desire is to help you.Trust me, Elizabeth.Tell me what kind of trouble you are in.He made it very tempting.There was a part of me that cried out to clear myself, to deny those bitter accusations.Yet there was another part of me that stubbornly refused to dignify insults with justifications.The hurt was too fresh.If he had so little faith in me, then what was the point of defending myself?I had been tried, judged, and sentenced without a fair trialI might as well let him hang me, too.Would you oblige me by releasing my shoulders, I said.Immediately!Very well.I was released so abruptly that I almost fell.I turned to walk stiffly to the door, but before I reached it a thought occurred to me.If Mrs.Goodbody and my sisters havent found out that I was out of the house tonight, could you please not mention it?It would be pointless to distress them, dont you think?He countered my nervous look with one of uncomfortable irony.Quite pointless.Your affairs are your own business.Thirteen Last night when I petitioned Vesta, the Roman protector of virgins, I should have remembered that Vesta is also the goddess who punishes virgins.I woke up the next morning with scabbed knees, damaged pride, and the problem of explaining to Mrs.Goodbody the loss of a gown, reticule, and bonnet, all in one swoop.Once you begin lying you have to lie repeatedly to protect the original lieits an exhausting business.I reflected bitterly on the simplicity of life before Lord Dearborne had inherited Barfrestly.Ironically, he was accusing me of behavior I hadnt even known about until I had met him and his set, and had been dragged into fashionable London.Prior to that time my behavior had been blameless by many standards; I had never been accused of anything more serious than allowing the tea to boil over.Nor had I encountered the plotting of tony beauties.If Peterby was to be believed, my Cinderella had the heart of a wicked stepmother.How humiliating it was that I could be so easily cozened into trusting someone.Take one cup of flattery, mix lightly with guile, season with a pinch of feigned deferenceoh!and baste with wine; there you have a foolproof recipe for deluding Elizabeth Cordell.What an April fool I must have appeared to Lady Catherine, pouring out my secrets to her while she was thinking of ways to stick in the needle.I had to admit that she had chosen quite a subtle scheme.Instead of trying to destroy my reputation with society in general, she had simply told one potent little lie about me to Lord Peterby and depended on him to do the rest.Men dont seduce pure young woman of gentle birth, but if I was already Christophers mistress, I became fair game as far as a rake like Lesley Peterby was concerned.I could have told Lady Catherine that Lord Dearborne, far from admiring me, was convinced that I was either a spy or a Jezebel (probably both!).Lady Catherine ought to conserve her energies for scheming against the Snow Queen or whomever.All women should be as good as Mrs.Goodbody, bless her soul.What can I tell her about my gown?Before bed last night I had taken care to ask Roger not to mention my unconventional outing.He had simply agreed that no useful purpose could be served by telling anyone of it; he neither badgered me nor quizzed me about the incident.Roger is, as Mrs.Goodbody says, a real gentleman.There was a possibility that the note summoning me to the Cuckolds Comfort had served the purpose of my correspondent.I had been invited to a lonely exploration of the most crime ridden slums of London.Who could be interested in endangering me like that?It was almost useless to speculate upon.How can you understand so devious a mentality without more facts?The strangest aspect of the evening was that I had gone through such trouble to garner information about Henris death from a phantom source only to be enlightened by Lord Dearborne.There was nothing said about dishcloths and murder at the inquest.I wondered how the marquis rigged the autopsy.My guardian, Lord Dearborne, was indeed a man of influence.Just how far his influence could extend became clear a few days later when Christopher and I were making our good byes to Lady Anne.The footmen were busily passing us, loading the carriage.Mrs.Goodbody was giving orders in her usual bustle, and we were standing to one side idly watching.So, Anne, how did your pupil do these last dizzy weeks?said Christopher.I am proud of my little protge, she said, smiling at me in her warm way.She received a proposal of marriage, which is doing rather well for a scant two weeks in the metropolis.Shes jesting, I said.Dont listen to her, Kit.No, actually, you did.The marquis turned it down, of course.To say I was surprised by this information would be an understatement.He turned it down?I didnt know anything about that.What has he to do with marriage proposals to me?Hes your guardian, said Christopher.He is doing his duty.You may not resent his interference when you find out who wanted your hand.I gaped at him speechlessly.Tell her, Anne, he said.Lady Anne looked as though she were bursting with a secret.Your radical friend, Godfrey.Godfrey?I said weakly.Christopher threw back his head with laughter.Depend upon it, that its because youre the only one who can stand to listen to his tedious ramblings about what knowing fellows the Romans were.Dont heed him, Elizabeth, Lady Anne said, directing a quelling frown at her brother.Godfreys too unstable to make anything but the most dreadful husband, besides the fact that his father is running through their fortune so fast that I doubt Godfrey will inherit one single slice of unencumbered property.But we will do better for you later, my dear.You must stay with my dear John and me for the next season.We must find a husband for you in simple charity to all other unmarried females!I had always suppressed a tendency in myself to wonder about the future.In this case it was difficult.I had actually received a marriage proposal which was refused on my behalf because of the obvious unsuitability of the hopeful.What if I were to receive a proposal from someone more appropriate?I thought of all the men of my acquaintance and was able to turn up none I could envision marrying.Perhaps, perish the thought, there was a respectable, wealthy, landowning bore in my future who would make a proper proposal to me (ineligible as I am) through the marquis, and I would have to marry him and spend the rest of my life tending to the needs of a dull M. P.  twice my age.Lord Dearborne would probably waste no time in getting rid of me now.I had never meant much to him.At worst, I was an expense and an annoyance.At best, I was a casual afternoons amusement, no more.Then I realized, frighteningly, that Lord Dearborne was more than that to me.Far, far more.Strangely, then, all desire to tell Lord Dearborne the truth about my night in the London slums died, stillborn.In fact, it seemed even wiser policy now to avoid all possible contact, all possible thought of him.I must forget his efficient compassion when Id grown tipsy at Lady Dorans ball; forget the comfort of the iron grasp that had carried me home after Id been hit by Monsieur Sacre Bleu, and, especially, I must forget my numbed surrender under the honeysuckle bush.I tried to concentrate instead on his high handed, arrogant ways.What right had he to assume the worst just because I came home at midnight, half naked and escorted by one of the most conscienceless libertines in London?After all, there might have been a perfectly innocent explanation for it.The absurdity of the thought brought a surprised smile to my lips and I tried to refocus my attention on Lady Anne, who was speaking to me.Im sorry to see you go, Elizabeth, she was saying.But I have to take my leave of London as well, to be with my husband.I dislike leaving you in Nickys hands; although his intentions are honorable, I know he is not cut out for the guardian role.He has always tended to see women as playthings or, at best, playmates.Hold tight till our return from Europe, wont you?Its time to go, said Christopher.The carriage was packed, the driver was in his seat, and Mrs.Goodbody was trying to quiet the twins.I could hear their excited squeals.Christopher, you must take good care of Elizabeth.I know Elizabeth will take good care of you, said Anne.She was brushing away a tear.I was touched and shed a tear of my own.Elizabeth, said Christopher, close to my ear, Egbert and Godfrey are here to give their good wishes.He was scowling.Indeed they were, standing nervously together at a little distance.Egbert was shifting from one foot to the other, clutching a nosegay.Godfrey was clearing his throat.I found myself feeling surprisingly sentimental toward the two of them.They had befriended me even though I was penniless, and Godfrey had even proposed to me.I felt this to be a point in his favor; everybody in London society married for money and status, and as much as Christopher liked to scoff at Godfreys republican beliefs, they did seem to be genuine.So I tried to be as gracious as possible in accepting the feminist tract, authored by Mary Wollstonecraft, that Godfrey held out to me, and accepted the nosegay from Egbert, and kissed them both.They were brave boys to court me past Christophers frowns and unkind remarks.When I took my leave, they made a misty pair.When the petite housemaid came forward bearing a handkerchief she had embroidered, it was all I could do to keep from crumpling into a sobbing heap.She had been so faithful, dressing my hair and seeing to my needs.And how I would miss the house as well.I had been there for only two short weeks and already it seemed like home.(I would especially miss the water closet. )Dressed in beautifully cut riding clothes, Lord Dearborne stepped out of the house to accompany us.His business had apparently been attended to.He stood by, watching the scene with a discreetly ironic and impatient air.Just then Mrs.Goodbody came up to me.You know, Elizabeth, through all the packing, I never did locate that gray poplin frock, your old bonnet, or your reticule.Do you have any idea where they might be?I knew I wasnt going to get out of London without Mrs.Goodbody finding out about my adventure.I thought for a moment, and assumed a nonchalant air, though I was quaking inside.With an eye toward the marquis, I said: I gave them to a beggar woman who came to the door.They were old, but I thought perhaps she could get some use out of them yet.Oh, she said, that was good of you.I tried to breathe my sigh of relief inaudibly.I could see the ironic look on Lord Nicholass face deepen.As we left London.I looked out at the crowds and shuddered when I thought of how well I knew what went on down these streets after dark.And when we reached the country, the air was so clean and easy to breathe, I became quite cheerful at the prospect of being back at Barfrestly where I could pick berries and play with Cleo without fear, if you discount ear cracking explosions, murdered spies, and roughnecks who sneak up to bludgeon you into insensibility.I wondered how my acquaintances in Kent had fared during my absence.It would be nice to see Jane Colman again, and I would have to tell the vicar about Lord Elgins marbles.The vicar, while being of the school of thought which decried the forced importation of the marbles from their native land, would nonetheless be interested in anything I would have to say about their artistic qualities.We arrived late in the evening and hurried the twins into bed.In spite of our exhausted state, Mrs.Goodbody and I were happy to sit out on the steps to chat with Joe Hawkins.We were joined presently by Roger, who sat solemnly next to Mrs.Goodbody and sucked a clay pipe.While the cool breeze soothed our travel tired bodies, we gazed at the stars, listened to the night birds calling, and caught up on local affairs.Joe Hawkins was somewhat abashed in our presence.He had never been to London and felt ill at ease among swells, as he called us.Imagine our Miss Elizabeth amongst those swells, he said to Mrs.Goodbody, shaking his head in wonderment.And a fine lady she made, too, said Mrs.Goodbody.But tell us what happened in the village whilst we were hobnobbing.After adoring Jane Coleman silently for years, the wheelwrights son had asked her to marry him, so I had not been the only one to receive a proposal.I would have to get Janes reaction to that.
