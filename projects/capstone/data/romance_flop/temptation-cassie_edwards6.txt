They stayed in each others arms through three songs, swaying ever so lightly to the music.She would be satisfied staying in his arms forever.He whispered in her ear, You smell heavenly.She caught a chill from the feel of his facial hair rubbing against her neck.She knew if they continued like this, she would be in trouble.She took a step back to create some distance between them.She was about to suggest they take a break, but she looked into his eyes and got lost.Ashlee took two steps closer, put her arms around his neck, and pulled him down for a kiss.Bryan pulled her closer and deepened the kiss.A moan escaped from her mouth.Too far.Pull back, Ashlee.She ignored the voice.She felt Bryans hands move from her waist to her mid back.She loved the feel of his strong masculine hands caressing her.His hands slowly started to move down.They went lower, lower.She pulled back before he reached the danger zone.Im sorry, Bryan laughed uncomfortably.Now, I understand what Mother Johnson meant when she said its not a good idea to be alone when the sun goes down and how kissing leads to other things.I didnt mean to lose control.The last thing I want is to disrespect you.Ashlee couldnt hold Bryans gaze.She looked at the water, wiped the corner of her lip with her thumb and nodded her head.Lets go back to our table.Bryan suggested softly.As soon as they sat, the two waiters rolled out two large serving carts.They pulled back the lids.Her eyes lit up when she saw shrimp tempura rolls, Philadelphia rolls, baked salmon rolls, and mango rolls.These were all of her favorite sushi dishes.There were also others shed never tried, but she planned to sample them all.She looked at Bryan who was pleased with her expression.He wasnt a sushi fan, so hed had the chef prepare him grilled salmon, with seasoned rice and vegetables.What did I do to deserve you?Ashlee asked with a smile.Youre the prize, sweetheart.And, dont you forget it.She chewed her bottom lip and dropped her head.What are you embarrassed about?Ashlee looked up.Why do you think Im embarrassed?Because I know you.I know when you chew your bottom lip and look down, youre either self conscious or embarrassed by something.She shook her head.This man was unbelievable.He paid attention to everything about her.Ashlee looked down into her plate while moving her fork around.I just feel I um  What is it, sweetheart?She smiled.I love it when you call me that.Why do I keep blurting stuff out?I just dont want you to think bad of me for, you know, kissing you like I did.I dont know what came over me.I couldnt help myself.Bryan leaned in.He rested his elbow on the table with his chin inside of his palm and watched her intently.He smiled.You are so adorable.She frowned.Adorable?Very much so.And I could never think badly of you about anything.Ive told you as far as Im concerned, youre perfect.Everything about you is perfect.She blushed.I cant believe youre still so shy around me.Ashlee looked up.Im still trying to get used to all of this attention and flattery.Sometimes I feel like Im out of my element and Im not always sure how to respond to it.Bryan decided to change the subject.Do you like your job at the nursing home?What are your long term goals?Ashlee sighed and sat back.I used to want to be an artist, but that dream died a while ago.I cant say nursing is my passion, but I like it enough and I love helping people.I think doing it is a more promising career than art.They ate and chatted some more.Will you be having dessert?The waiter asked.Ashlee shook her head.No, were ready.Bryan answered.Ashlee looked up.Were leaving?You look disappointed.Maybe a little.Im really enjoying your company.Its nice when its just the two of us.The waiter came back with a bouquet of calla lilies.With her attention held captive by the bouquet of her favorite flowers, Bryan stood and walked unnoticed towards her.How do you feel about it being just the two of us forever?She looked up from the flowers and found Bryan on his knee beside her.I know this may seem sudden, but Ive never met anyone like you.I want to spend the rest of my life making you happy.Make me the happiest man in the world and be my wife.She saw him down on his knee, saw the ring in his hand.She knew he was serious.But, was he sure?Could he really spend his life with someone who was just average?Are you sure you want to marry me?Bryan frowned.Yes, Im sure.That would explain why Im down here on my knees on this hard floor.He stood, brought his chair next to her and turned her to face him.Whats on your mind, sweetheart?Do you not want to marry me?Its not that.Its I dont think Ill fit in with your big time lawyer friends and their wives.I dont want you to wake up one day and wish you had married someone thats more like you.Bryan rubbed the top of his head.He couldnt understand why Ashlee didnt see her worth or why she didnt trust his love for her.Listen, Ive met a lot of women and none of them come close to comparing to you.I dont want anybody else.The first day I saw you in that big old skirt  Ashlee swatted him and smiled.I knew you were going to be my wife.That first day we spent at my moms for dinner was the day I fell in love with you.I know it sounds crazy and I know its sudden.But I promise if you let me, Ill spend the rest of our lives proving to you how much I love you.Now Im asking you again, will you marry me?Ashlee didnt question her love for Bryan.Shed marry him in a heartbeat if she thought it would last.Shed been let down by enough men in her life that was supposed to love her and she didnt want it to happen again.Then again, if she turned him down, she might lose him forever.She loved him and she really believed he loved her too.She was afraid she wouldnt be enough to keep a man like him, but she decided to give it a go.Yes, Bryan.Ill marry you.He placed a platinum 3.07 carat princess cut diamond ring on her finger.She couldnt take her eyes off of it.Wow.Its beautiful.When Bryan approached her a little more than six and a half months ago, never in her wildest dreams did she think she would be sitting there with him at that very moment wearing his engagement ring that probably cost more than everything she owned put together.She turned to him, put her hands on each side of his face, and looked him square in the eyes.Thank you.Why are you thanking me?For loving me for me.She pulled him in for a kiss.This time a sweet, innocent, and gentle one.14  Bryan didnt get a chance to stay happy for long.Days after the proposal, he was given a card to sign for Natalia.Some of the paralegals planned to take it, as well as a few gifts collected throughout the firm to the hospital.She had given birth the night before to a baby girl.Bryan wanted to believe the baby was her husbands, but Natalia was manipulative and conniving.He knew she was not to be trusted.Later that night, he went to see for himself.He didnt alert anyone that he was coming.He hoped to get there after everyone from the office had already left so that he didnt raise any suspicions.He went to the nursery area, leaned back against the wall, and looked in through the window.There were seven babies in there.He searched for a baby girl with the last name Philips.His eyes finally landed on a beautiful caramel colored little girl who seemed to be looking back at him.She had a dimple in her left cheek.Her hazel eyes connected with his, right before his legs gave out.He slid down the wall until he reached the floor.He sat there with his eyes closed hoping he would soon wake up from this nightmare.*********  Bryan waited a week before he confronted Natalia.He took a long lunch break and went to her house.He hoped her husband wasnt there.You told me the baby wasnt mine, he started as soon as shed opened the door.What were you going to do if I hadnt gone to the hospital, pretend I wasnt the father?Were you ever going to tell me?No.Because, shes not yours.Shes mine and Terrances, regardless of what the blood work says.Regardless of who she looks like.Im married to him and he can give us both the life we deserve.Hes a partner at his law firm and hes who I want to raise my daughter.So you expect me to walk out of here and pretend I dont have a child?Look, youre a great guy and Im sorry I got you into this.But please, trust me.Its better this way for everyone.You can be free.I can keep my husband, and Breah wont want for anything.Her name is Breah?Whats her full name?Breah Andrea Philips.Bryans full name was Bryan Andre Hunter.He frowned.Why did you name her after me if you werent going to let me claim her?Because the truth is I love you and Im glad its your blood running through her veins.This way, even though you wont be in our lives, well still be connected forever.No matter what.Bryan didnt like the thought of that.Even more, he didnt like the way she looked when she said it.It was almost as if she was happy it turned out this way.Look, I wont interfere with you and your little girlfriend.You dont have to have any financial responsibility.You can be free.Okay, Natalia, Bryan said after a long pause.My fiance can never find out about this.She despises men who dont acknowledge and take care of their children.He regretted sharing that information.Natalia was vindictive.He didnt want to think about how she might use that information against him later on.The deal was made.He left her home and planned to move forward building a life with Ashlee, Jordan, and Jade.15  Bryan decided to add Ashlee to his cell phone plan when she accepted his proposal.He was on his way to see if she was available for lunch.He wanted to surprise her with the new cell.He didnt like not being able to reach her when he needed to, nor did he like her not being able to call him if she was in trouble.He wanted to be the person she called when the kids needed something or if she needed a ride somewhere.He hoped she would accept it.She was so determined to make it on her own and not receive handouts, he wasnt sure how she would react.During his drive to the nursing home, he thought about his encounter with Natalia.He didnt trust her for a minute.Judging by the look in her eyes, he was sure she was planning something.A woman like that didnt let things go.Did I hear her say she loved me?
