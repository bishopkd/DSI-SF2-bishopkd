Whatever it was, it would be a long time before it felt like home.Theyd been there for two weeks now and he still felt unsettled.Hands in pockets, he walked towards the bus stop.Catching the last one got him to the pizza factory in the nickiest nick of time.Tonight, Hitchin was quiet.Not that it was particularly jumping any night of the week, he had to concede.Very few people were on the streets and the pubs were yet to turn out.It was a fine evening for some fresh air now that the nights were slightly warmer.Maybe things would get better soon.God, he hoped so.At the moment, all he could think of was that the numbers were racking up at an alarming rate and they all seemed to be going into the red column rather than the black one.If this was what business involved, then you could keep it.As he turned into Market Place he nearly bumped into a woman coming out of one of the shopping arcades in the centre.Sorry, love, Olly said as he steered round her.Watch where youre going, plum, the woman snapped.When he looked up to apologise again, he saw that it was Jenny and that she was laughing at him.All right, Olly?she said.You were in a world of your own, mate.I was, he admitted.Sorry.No harm done.Off to work then?Yeah.You?Just finished, Jen said.She flicked her head back towards the chippy.How are you getting on in your new place?Its just round the corner, isnt it?Youll have to come by.Ive been meaning to, Jen said.But you know how it is.Id better go, Olly said.Got my bus to catch.Ill walk down with you.If thats OK?Olly shrugged.Walking along with Jen might help take his mind off his troubles for ten minutes.She linked her arm through his.Hows married life suiting you?He could hardly tell his wifes friend that theyd never argued so much since theyd tied the knot.Nell was turning into a person he didnt know.Gone was the laid back woman hed spent the last decade with.Shed been replaced by someone who talked constantly about work, budgets, forecasts and flaming handbags.She didnt even seem to have as much time for Petal these days, let alone him.Oh, you know.Jen whacked his arm.Course I dont.Doh!Ive never been hitched.He wanted to tell her that it was overrated, but that wasnt strictly true.It wasnt marriage itself that had him and Nell at each others throats.It was much more complicated than that.Its fine, he settled on.Fine.You could sound a bit more bloody enthusiastic.Give me a break, Jen, he said.Weve been together for ten years.Were not exactly in the first rush of love.They were at the bus stop now and the bus was due in a few minutes.Jen turned and faced him.Shes a lucky girl, that Nell.You tell her I said so.If she doesnt appreciate you, then there are plenty of others who will.He laughed.Im not such a catch, Jen.Go on with you.She nudged him.I wouldnt kick you out of bed for farting.Ill remember that.The bus came into view.At least Ive put a smile on your face, she said.Thanks.Everything seemed to revolve round work and he wondered whether thats what they faced for the rest of their lives.He couldnt even remember the last time he and Nell had enjoyed a night out together, just the two of them.Their wedding night had been a disaster as theyd turned their backs on each other due to that stupid photograph debacle.Perhaps that was still in the back of both of their minds.Im in need of a laugh.Jen was suddenly serious.Any time, Olly, she said.I mean it.You only have to call me.Now he was embarrassed.Yeah.Ill remember that.You do.Thankfully, the bus pulled up next to them.Bus, Olly said, pointing at it.Youre hysterical, Jen chuckled.Catch you soon, Olly.Yeah.Soon.He jumped on the bus.Jen stood on the pavement and waved at him as it pulled away.She looked lonely, he thought.Vulnerable even.And, something else he hadnt noticed before, quite cute.39      Its late.Ollys just gone off to work.Petal has been fast asleep in bed, our bed, for hours.All attempts at keeping her in her own bed in the new flat have failed miserably.Other than that, she seems to have settled in quite well.More than I can say for Olly.He clearly hates it here and has done nothing but stomp round, muttering darkly since we moved in.Im in the shop now, despite the hour.Ive switched on Petals old baby monitor, although Im sure I could hear her, anyway, if there was a problem.Im not that far away and my child isnt generally known for the quietness of her voice.Were due to be up and running for business next week, but everything is still utter chaos at the moment.The front is to be open to the general public but, to be honest, this is just as important for me to have as a showroom that will enable me to display my handbags properly for any agents or journalists who want to come and see us.The room at the back will serve as an office and workroom.All in all, well look more like a professional company than a seat of the pants cottage industry.They cant see how little is in my coffers.Right?What it does mean though is that Ive given up the market stall on Saturdays and no longer have to subject my only child to hyperthermia every weekend.I suppose I could have paid someone else to stand there and freeze as it had turned into quite a lucrative pitch, but now that weve got a swanky shop, does having a market stall give out the right message for a woman whos going places?I need to try to tidy everything up so that, hopefully, Olly will start to see why this is a good move, in spite of the expense, and stop being grumpy.Ive freshened the whole place up with a coat of brilliant white emulsion and Ive cut out some inspiring pop art pictures from glossy magazines and have hung them in cheap frames.I think its starting to look more like it belongs to me.Earlier in the week, I revamped some shelves that I bought on eBay painting them in whats rapidly becoming my trademark pink.Now that theyre dry, I can arrange a display of handbags on them and Im taking the few hours I have on my own before I fall into bed to do that.I fiddle and fuss and then stand back, admiring my efforts.Deep in thought, I jump out of my skin when theres a knock on the window.Turning, I expect to give the finger to some drunks looking for a bit of amusement as theyre wandering home.Instead, Im surprised to see Tods face pressed up against the glass, grinning.Smiling back, I go to open the door.Hey, he says.Ive just had dinner in town and I saw the light on.I dont ask who he had dinner with.You nearly gave me a heart attack, I chide.Sorry.He doesnt look chastised at all.I thought it would be a good opportunity to see how its all going.Yeah, I say.Its OK.More than OK, Nell, he laughs.It must be fabulous to have your name above your own shop door.Glad to see that you didnt change it to Mrs Meyers when you got married.Actually, I did consider it.I know that Olly would like me to and so would Petal.Youre a brand now, Tod says.It would be the wrong thing to do.You are and always will be, Nell McNamara.A brand.Nell McNamara for ever.Its a sobering thought.Im thinking that I wont even mention that to Olly.I lead Tod deeper into the shop and show him my handiwork with a Ta da!He gazes around.What do you think?Looking good, Tod says, voice full of admiration.Looking very good.Through here will be the office and workroom.He follows in my footsteps.Ive got a couple of ladies coming in parttime to help me.Next year, world domination, he teases.Maybe the year after, I counter.He leans against the doorframe, looking way too cool for this small, untidy space filled with boxes that are still waiting to be unpacked.I cant wait to get this bit of the premises up and running too.Im really pleased for you, Nell.I love a success story.Im not there yet, I remind him.Theres definitely a lot more cash going out than there is coming in.Never a good situation to be in as my husband regularly points out.Frankly, Im too frightened to look closely at the bank account.It wont be for long, Im sure.I wish I had Tods unwavering confidence.I was about to stop for some tea.Can I offer you something?From behind his back, Tod produces a bottle of champagne.You just happened to have that with you?On the off chance, he admits.I thought we should celebrate.Shame Ollys not here.Then I wonder if my mentor has deliberately waited until Olly was safely out at work.Why else would he be calling so late at night?Equally quickly, I dismiss the thought.Im being silly.Theres been no more unexpected intimacy between us since that brief kiss after our evening at the Palace and I put that down to nothing more than the mood, the madness and the moonlight.Come up to the flat, I say.I must warn you though, thats looking distinctly less salubrious.We go up the creaky, wonky staircase to the creaky, wonky flat.Dude, from his bed, wags his tail, but clearly is too exhausted to get out and greet us.The dog, at least, has settled well into his new home.I move some boxes out of the way so that we can beat a path to the kitchen.Weve managed to find the stereo, so I click it on.Very occasionally Olly and I make a nod towards modern music and the dulcet tones of Coldplay and Trouble fills the small space.Champagne flutes may be beyond me, I say, but I do have some pretty mugs in here somewhere.Mugs are fine, Tod assures me and, expertly, he pops the cork while I rummage in the cupboards to locate two of the best.He lets the bubbles foam into them and hands one to me.Cheers, I say and go to knock my mug against his.We should toast like this  He moves in towards me and links his arm through mine, pulling me close.That will enhance the experience.We drink and our faces are so close that theyre almost touching.Im not sure that this is enhancing my experience at all, but it is making me very hot and bothered.My hair falls forward and, before I can pull away, Tod lifts the strand and tucks it behind my ear.Its a movement so filled with tenderness that it takes my breath away.Nell, he whispers.The bedroom door crashes open.Bang Bang is being very naughty, Petal announces as if shes addressing the back of the stalls.Her favourite doll, the one with very little spiky hair  as a result of my childs lack of hairdressing skills  and no clothes, is thrust at me.Youd better come and sort her out, Mummy.Bang Bang is given over to my tender loving care.I have no idea why the doll is called Bang Bang.Nor why Petals rather threadbare teddy is called Razzle Dazzle.Tod, rather smoothly, steps away from me.Well, hello, little lady.Petal looks slightly disgruntled at being addressed thus.Normally, Id be equally disgruntled that she had interrupted a rare romantic moment.In this case, Im very glad that she did.40      As it turns out, the shop is a huge commitment.Bigger than anything that Ive ever taken on before.Bigger than anything I could have ever envisaged for myself.Although its proved to be a good separation of home and work space, the fact that work is just below me when Im at home, means that I never really stop thinking about it.Today Im working on new sketches.These are retro designs of pop art inspired and psychedelic images and, even if I do say so myself, theyre coming along nicely.Ideally, Id like to increase the range of products available to include coin purses, make up bags and, perhaps, umbrellas  but that would involve a whole new world of expense in commissioning samples.Everything is made in China now, so Id have to find a factory out there: a daunting prospect.When the bag frames I bought on eBay ran out, we managed to find out whod supplied them from a delivery note left inside one of them.Weve been buying them direct from this warehouse ever since, but as my designs are getting more and more out there, I cant just keep customising existing bag frames.Now the time has come to get them made to my own specification, which involves more money and I cant even bring myself to raise that matter with Olly.Petal is with me today playing, as usual, on the floor in the office.She probably spends way too much time in here when she should be playing out in the park or learning to swim or doing something entertaining or educational.But I keep telling myself that it is only a short time until she starts school and then my conscience will be in the clear.I try not to think of the precious quality time that Im missing out on.It could be worse.How many mothers have to go out to work now and leave their children in the care of others simply to make ends meet?At least Petal is here with me, even though shes grubbing around on the floor while I try to concentrate on my designs.The phone rings and at the end of the line, theres a very sexy male voice with a heavy, and inordinately attractive, French accent.I am Yves Simoneaux, he explains.I am an agent based in Paris and I have heard very much about you.I would be interested in representing your designs if you do not have already your interests in France covered.I hope that he cant hear my heart thumping down the phone.No, I say.We havent got representation in France yet.It hadnt even occurred to me.Despite joking with Tod about world domination, Im paddling so fast to keep my head above water here, that I havent even considered anything else.But Europe is a massive market.Just think how we could grow there.May I come to visit with you?Yes.Yes, of course.I look round at the showroom and am glad, at this moment, that we bit the bullet and moved here.How could I have had a sexy French agent come to my tatty old house?This afternoon?he continues.I can be with you by two of the clock.You know where we are?Oh, yes, Yves says.I can almost hear the shrug.I am very well organised.I can get a train to you from Kings Cross station, yes?Yes.It takes just under an hour.That is excellent.Ill see you at two, then.At two, he agrees.And he hangs up.I reward myself for my good fortune by jumping up and down on the spot.Petal abandons her crayoning and we jump together for a bit.Now, I say.You must be a very good girl this afternoon as we have a very important visitor coming.Another one?She rolls her eyes.Yes.My child looks unimpressed by this.But then, of course, she doesnt realise that this could make the difference between her living in a flat above the shop for the rest of her formative years or moving into a four bed detached place in one of the more posh areas of town, complete with her own swing and top of the range trampoline.41      I fly round and tidy up, rearranging the bags time and time again, somewhat needlessly.An hour later and this place looks like a slick, professional operation or as near as, damn it.Only the somewhat surplus child detracts from it slightly.I think about trying to farm Petal out for the afternoon and call Olly, Constance and Jen, but Ive once again left it way too late.They are all busy, busy, busy.So Petal stays and Mr Yves Simoneaux will have to take us as we are.At the appointed time  by two of the clock  the bell chimes and the most handsome man Ive ever seen swings in, ducking through the low doorway as he does.If this is Yves Simoneaux, then I have lost my heart and, more than likely, my senses are about to follow too.Hes tall, slender, mid thirties at a guess.His black suit hangs on his frame and hes wearing a white shirt with a black tie.A black leather man bag is slung across his body and rests on his hip.Bonjour, he says and his heavy eyebrows lift and a slow smile spreads across his face.His dark hair has a curl to it, but is swept back from his face and gelled into place.Theres a fine line of designer stubble outlining his chin, a soul patch beneath his lip.He holds out his hand to me.I am Yves.When I take it, I notice his fingers are long, slender.Despite his hand being cool to the touch, it gives me palpitations.Nell.Petal clings to my leg and Yves kneels down in front of her.Who is this lovely little mademoiselle?My daughter has gone all silly too and I supply, This is Petal, while she gapes at him open mouthed and goggle eyed.Looks as if Mr Simoneaux has the same effect on four year olds as he does on women of a certain age who should know better.Come in, please, I say and hobble further into the showroom with Petal attached to my leg.This is a very beautiful space, he says and looks round giving admiring nods.Weve only just moved in, I explain.So its all a bit raw yet.My company is very new.This I know, he says.It is why I think that I can help you.That would be fantastic.But, because Im all of a fluster, Im forgetting my manners.Can I offer you a drink?I should have gone out and got biscuits, posh ones, or something.In a moment, he says, holding up a hand.First I would love for you to show me more of your designs.Now, Petal.I manage to dislodge my child and grip her by the shoulders as I speak, so I hope she knows that I mean business.Will you play nicely while I talk to Mr Simoneaux?Yes, Petal says with look as if to say she never does anything but play nicely all alone.Obediently  thank God!she trots off into the office.She is a very beautiful child, Yves says.Like her mother.Ha, ha, ha.I laugh girlishly and flush and simper and generally dont behave like a rufty tufty business woman who will stand no messing.Yves smiles again.He is clearly well aware of the effect he has on women and has probably been milking it for years.Theres no doubt he has this flirtation thing down to a fine art.This must be the legendary Gallic charm  or garlic charm, as Olly calls it.Now, to work, he says and steers me towards the rows of carefully arranged handbags as he outlines the work of his company.He goes on to tell me about where hed plan to place the products and how much commission they take from sales.I try to concentrate and not notice the coolness of his hand on the small of my back.What has happened in recent weeks?Ive never attracted this level of male attention before.Is it because Im no longer seen as just a housewife and mother with a little (pat me on the head) part time job?Or have I suddenly become a man magnet because they think Im someone whos going places?I havent changed my perfume, so its certainly not that.Yves takes the handbags and runs his hands over them as if hes seducing a voluptuous woman.Beau.Trs beau.When he finally tires of making love to my handbags, I lead him through to the office.Im just sketching out some new designs, I say and pull the relevant papers to the top of my pile.They are wonderful, he says, but his eyebrows pull together in a frown.Maybe he doesnt like them at all.Ive literally just been doodling this morning, I rush in.Hot off the press.Youre the first person that Ive had the chance to show them to.One design is for a bag covered in candy stripe fabric with hearts and stars sprinkled liberally across it.On one side it reads BAG, on the other LADY.Yves strokes his hand across the drawing.Another is covered in psychedelic hearts and flowers and says MAKE LOVE on one side and NOT WAR on the other.The last one has four pouting lips in Andy Warhol style on it and the back reads MY FIFTEEN MINUTES OF FAME.Still no response.Perhaps they need more work.A shrug.Perhaps.He takes off his man bag and then rifles through the sketches again, but makes no further comment.Before I can ask him any more, Petal appears.I hadnt actually even registered that she wasnt in the office.How observant am I as a mother?Shes bearing a pink tray, and two mugs and a teapot are balanced precariously on it.Her tongue is out and the concentration on her face is a sight to behold.For reasons best known to my daughter, she has also found her pink cycling helmet and is wearing it.I have maked tea, she announces.Oh, lord.I immediately swoop down and rescue the tray from Petals shaky grip as the teapot starts a death slide.Sweet pea, you know youre not allowed near the kettle.I didnt go near the kettle, she informs me with a scowl.You didnt?Ill pour, she insists.I touch the teapot and realise it is, in fact, stone cold.Oh, dear.We cant have tea now, Petal.Mummys busy.Youre never too busy for tea, my child says imperiously.Thats what you say.I do.Frequently.Even though Im invariably wrong.When, reluctantly, I put the tray down on the coffee table, my daughter manoeuvres herself between me and the teapot and sets about pouring.Sorry, I mouth to Yves.It is fine, he assures me.The pot wobbles and we get a fair amount of Petals tea sloshing about on the tray rather than in the cup.That gives me the chance to see that her tea seems to involve half a dozen tea bags floating in cold water with the milk already added.She stands and, with every ounce of her being focused on delivering the results of her endeavour, hands the first cup to Yves.This is wonderful, he says.This is exactly how we French like to take our tea.Petal beams, easily fallen under his Parisian spell.Yves winks at me and, above and beyond the call of duty, sips his tea.Dlicieux.Thank you, I say as I take my cup too.Youre a very clever girl.Somehow we manage to down Petals cold tea and then Yves says, I am sorry to be rude, but I must rush away.Of course.You must have lots more to do.His smile says that he has.We have a deal?Yes?I try not to look surprised.Or to leap into Yves arms in excitement.Id fully expected finding an agent to be a lot more complicated than this.Never in a million years did I think that one would just bowl up on my doorstep and take me on straight away.Wait until I tell Olly about this.Hell be pleased for me.Surely?We do, I confirm gratefully.Yves and I shake hands again.Merveilleux.Again, Im really sorry weve kept you here so long.He takes my hand and lifts it to his mouth, kissing it softly.The pleasure has been all mine.Once more, I go into a girly flat spin.Here is my card.I gaze at the business card he hands me, slightly goggleeyed.We will speak, Yves says as he slings his man bag back across his body.Very soon.That would be lovely.I sound more breathless than I would have hoped.May I?My daughter is waiting shyly behind me.He takes Petals hand and kisses it.Au revoir, mademoiselle.Thank you for my excellent cup of English tea.Petal is as bewitched as I am.With us both safely under his spell, Yves leaves us and I watch as his rangy frame turns heads as he lopes away down the street.I dont think Hitchin has ever seen anyone as gorgeous.Now, I say, still all of a flutter, better get back to work before the day slips away from me.He was nice, Petal observes.Yes, I say, somewhat wistfully.I go back into the office, settle Petal with her crayons once more and sit myself back at my desk.With a deep and rather shaky breath, I prepare myself to carry on with my new designs.But despite searching the desk high and low, I cant find them anywhere.42      The next few months go by in a blur of trade events  or fashion shows as I would have previously called them.Spring comes and goes and I hardly notice it.The daffodils bloom, carpeting the town with yellow.Petal adores them.I barely lift my head to acknowledge the changes.Then summer is upon us.A hot one, for once.Everyone melts in May but me.The blistering heat of flaming June doesnt trouble me either as I spend most of my time indoors in deep freeze air conditioning and darkness, listening to pounding music while staring at catwalks, being jostled by the crowds with nothing but a stale, mass catered sandwich and some machine tea for sustenance.Are the trade events useful?I think so.It gives me a chance to see what else is out there and who my competitors are.Besides, Tod tells me that I must attend them.So attend them, I do.I and, more importantly, my handbags grace the aisles of the Clothes Collective in Birmingham, Fashion Fusion in Manchester, Gladrags in Leeds and Sustainable Chic in Scotland.Im networking my little backside off in the hope that it will all pay off one day.The culmination of my chilled to the bone travels is Designer Extravaganza in London, the most crucial show of the year where, with the help of a grant that finally materialised from The Princes Trust, Ive been able to secure myself a stand.This is the first time that Ill actually display my wares and the cost of doing so is truly staggering.We could buy a decent family car for the same price.The fact that it is the worlds smallest stand is neither here nor there.Its a stand at a prestigious event and for the first time in my life, Im going to be a presence in the big bad world of fashion.Im so excited that I feel permanently sick.Ive had to draft in Jenny and Constance to help Olly look after Petal for the week Im away.To say that my husband isnt best pleased is something of an understatement.Hes sick of the amount of time that Ive already spent away from home so far this year and finds every opportunity he can to tell me so.Its been the subject of countless rows.But what can I do?This is our livelihood.This is what the business demands.Now, Im running round the workroom like a headless chicken, getting last minute things together for the stand.Dinners ready.Olly sticks his head round the door.His face falls as he sees the bags and boxes all over the floor.Arent you done yet?I try not to bristle.He has no concept of how important this is for me, for all of us.Then I get a rush of guilt.He also has no idea quite how much this is costing us.I can only hope that its worth it.All the promotions that Im doing have certainly brought the orders in, but not necessarily the cold, hard cash.The cost of fulfilling them all seems to be spiralling out of control and that scares me.One day the income has to become more than the outgoings, otherwise were in real trouble.The preparation for this trade show has been staggering.Ive had to think of everything from sending out press packs, getting business cards, ordering passes for me, Olly and the van, booking a hotel, writing blurb for the brochure, sending out invitations and designing everything from the lighting down to the electricity points on the stand.And lets not forget the stressing about the handbags themselves.My idea for the space weve rented is to make it look like a candy shop and Ive roughed out designs for decorating the walls.I can access the space two days early to give me time to paint it.Therell be display shelves round the walls and the handbags will be slotted in between jars of old fashioned sweets.In the middle of the floor therell be a big claw foot bath (bought from my prop store and general saviour, eBay) overflowing with things like sherbet fountains, black jacks, flying saucers, giant swirly lollipops and candy canes, with my handbags in among them.Im hoping therell be a lot of sweettoothed buyers at the show who will find it irresistible.Nearly, I tell Olly.Ill have to come down here for a couple of hours afterwards.Thought we might watch a movie tonight, Olly says.Have some time together before you go away for the week.That sounds lovely.And it does.How long has it been since Olly and I just vegged out on the sofa together?Ill try, I promise.But in my heart of hearts, I know that Ill be burning the midnight oil so that Im ready in time for tomorrow.This is my first show and its important that I get it right.Once Im on the stand, thats it.I cant pop back home if I happen to forget something.At first light, we need to set off for the city and Ive hired a van so that Olly can drive all the stuff down with me.I try not to be hurt that Olly hasnt even asked me how things are going or whether he can help when Petal goes to bed.Id better get back.He flicks a thumb towards the kitchen.Itll be burning.Five minutes, I beg.Just keep it warm for me.His expression tells me that I might as well have asked him to cut up Petal and put her under the patio.Five, he says, or your dinner will be in the dog.He stomps his way back upstairs.I sigh to myself.The other worry is that I havent had any real news from Yves Simoneaux.Ive called him several times but have only managed to speak to him once since his impromptu visit.Now that Ive appointed him as my agent, he doesnt seem quite as keen.I dont know how long these things are supposed to take, but Id hoped that after the initial rush of enthusiasm, hed have secured us some contracts by now.But theres been nothing.I would also have thought that hed be at Designer Extravaganza as its such an important date on the fashion calendar but, despite emailing him, I havent yet had a reply to tell me whether hell be there or not.I held fire on the pop art designs because he didnt seem that mad about them and now Im wondering if that was the right thing to do.Perhaps I should have something new and exciting to show on my stand, but I havent.The designs are still the same ones I started out with.Im just hoping that the buyers, who probably wont know me from Adam, will see them as fresh and new.Tod will be at the show for the entire week  not just helping me, but working as a consultant for other people too.I havent told Olly that either.It seems that I keep a lot of secrets from my husband these days for the sake of peace and weve never had that in our relationship before.Once more, I attempt to reconcile myself to this by thinking that it wont be for long, it wont be for ever.There has to be a breakthrough in the business and then, well, well be set for life.Well live in a mansion and eat gold plated Weetabix and have Porsches coming out of our ears.See what Olly has to stomp up and down about then.43      At six oclock in the morning, Jen arrives, yawning and bleary eyed.Olly and I already have the van loaded.I start to download a list of to dos for Jenny even though her charge is still fast asleep in bed and will no doubt be for some time yet.She holds up a hand.Dont stress, Nell, she says.Even I can manage to get Coco Pops in the kid and Chum in the dog.Everything beyond that is a bonus.Thanks.I let out a shaky breath.Thanks so much for doing this.She yawns again.Clearly wide awake babysitters are extra.Any time.No worries.Ready?I ask Olly.He downs the dregs of his coffee and nods.I take a moment to creep into Petals room just one more time and watch my daughters slumbering form.This reminds me what all my hard work is for.Providing a better future for Petal is all that matters.I softly kiss her goodbye, wiping a tear from my eye when I think that I wont see my little sweet pea for a whole week.Olly and I jump into the van and set off towards the big smoke.Needless to say, last night my dinner was a dried up mess by the time Id finished stressing about what last minute bits to take for the show.Olly and I never did get to smooch on the sofa watching that film.Instead, I fell into bed beside my husband at two in the morning and then anxiety kept me tossing and turning for the rest of the night and Olly added to it by tutting under his breath.At five, when I got up, I was just about ready to fall into a deep sleep.Its fair to say that the atmosphere between us is still a little frosty this morning.Two hours later and were pulling up at the venue in Londons Earls Court.The enormous Designer Extravaganza banner flutters overhead and I think, Im part of this.Im really part of this now.I pinch myself a couple of times to make sure that I really am.Olly shows our pass which, thankfully, among one hundred and one other things, I remembered to print off, and we drive into the exhibition hall.We unload as quickly as we can, hauling the claw foot bath between us.Were only allowed to park on site for a miniscule amount of time as there are a million other identical vans all waiting for access.Wow, Olly says when he sees inside the vast hall for the first time.This is the real deal.Already many of the stands are well on their way to being built and furnished.We have a lot to do.On a fraction of the budget that most of them seem to have.In direct line of sight, all I can see is recognisable and well established high street brands.Then theres little old me with my little old handbags.I can only hope that my stand design lives up to my expectations.It also worries me that the people on the stands are wafting about, all looking unfeasibly trendy whereas, at the moment, I look like the hired help.Id better sharpen up for the start of the show.Can you see now why Ive been so worried?I ask him.My husband takes me in his arms and holds me tight.Youll knock them dead, he assures me.For a moment the passion sparks between us again and then Olly says, Id better go and move that van.You make a start and Ill be back just as soon as I can.So, I find the box with the various tins of paint in it and my overalls.I locate the brushes and, with the magic of emulsion, begin to transform our small, bland box into a sweetie/handbag wonderland.Ive been painting for half an hour and Olly has just returned from parking the van and is busy admiring my handiwork, when Tod swings by.Didnt think that youd be here today, I tell him as I kiss him briefly on the cheek in greeting.Im more self conscious with him now after our close call in the kitchen.Thought you might need a hand, he says.But I can see that youre ably assisted.He and Olly exchange a wary glance.Ill catch you later.He waves over his shoulder as he leaves the stand and is swallowed up by the crowds of workers already swarming in the aisles.I didnt know he was going to be here, Olly notes as he watches him go.Its his job, Olly, I point out.Hes doing some consultancy work or something, too.My husband still scowls after him.I cant believe hes like this after all that Tod has done for me.Why?Is it a problem?Ollys face is dark.I always feel as if Im on the outside of this, Nell, he answers.I dont know whats going on half the time.You seem to deliberately keep me out of the loop.I dont like to tell him that if I keep him in the loop, all he does is complain.Im well aware that hes hated me being away so much recently.But what can I do?This is business.I have to be here.I have no choice.I havent even seen the design of the stand until now.You didnt ask me about it, I point out.I didnt think you were interested.All you seem to want me to do is lift heavy things.You dont need my input on anything else.Thats not true.You know its not true.Although it is true that I keep things from him because I know he wont like them and I feel ashamed about that.All the fight goes out of him.Why do we not seem able to talk about simple things any more?I have no idea, Olly.I wipe my hands on my overalls and prepare to thrash this out once and for all.I have to go, my husband says abruptly.Im on night shift tonight and I need to catch a few winks.I didnt sleep much last night.Thats my fault too.I hope you have a brilliant week, Nell.See you when you get back.Petal and I will be waiting.I take his hand.Dont leave like this.I need your support, Olly.And I need my wife back.Petal needs her mum.With that, he leaves me and my paint, with all the shelves to put up and the boxes to unpack and I know that, despite paying a small fortune for a London hotel, I probably wont be getting to bed tonight either.44      Later that afternoon, when Im just about ready to lie down on the floor of my stand and weep, Tod comes back.I have so much to do and, in the way of these things, so little time.Everyone else looks so much more organised than me.But then everyone else seems to have a team of people scurrying round and theres not just one person trying to do it all by their lonesome self.Clearly sensing my despair, Tod strips off his jacket and rolls his sleeves up.He does not look like a man who is used to manual labour but, to my relieved surprise, he is.I show him what I want doing and he gets on with the job without complaint.Tod puts up shelves, drags the claw foot bath into its rightful place centre stage, fills it with the sweets and generally helps to pull the stand together while I am busy doing the artistic bit and painting my designs on the walls.Were still there together, working in companionable silence, when the clock ticks eight.Tod switches off the vacuum cleaner that hes blagged from someone, which hes been using to such good effect.Time to call it a day, he says.I cant stop yet.He comes and takes my paintbrush from my hand, which has cramped into shape around it.I know how these things work, he insists.Youre so tired that youll start making mistakes.Stop now.Well have a quick dinner, a glass of wine to unwind, sleep eight hours and come back fresh first thing in the morning to finish it.Really?This sounds like a very appealing option.What if Im not ready in time?You will be, he assures me.I gaze longingly at my one still unpainted wall.Could I not just do this?I am your mentor, he reminds me.When have I ever misled you?Never, I concur.Then good Italian food and passable red wine it is, Tod says.I know a little place nearby and Ive taken the liberty of booking a table for nine oclock.Think you can turn it round by then?I dont like to tell Tod that I can be ready in five minutes flat.Thats what comes from usually having a four year old daughter in tow.Together, we pack away the detritus on the stand and cover it with protective night sheets until the morning.I get a momentary pang and wish that it was Olly who was here with me to see my progress.But it isnt and I have to put that thought firmly to the back of my mind.Tod and I are booked into the same hotel  and I havent told Olly about that either.We hail a cab and I lay my head back on the seat while we work our way through the traffic to the conveniently located Scott Hotel.The place is at the top end of my budget  probably beyond it, but Id rather put more on my credit card and stay here with Tod than stay alone in some grotty fleapit or whatever in a dodgy backstreet.Its a five minute drive from the exhibition centre and I now realise how valuable that it is too.We could probably even have walked it if I hadnt been so tired.At the hotel, were given our key cards with brisk efficiency.Tod checks my room number and finds that were next door to each other.Ill knock for you in about half an hour?Thats fine.All I really want to do is crawl into my bed and sleep, but that would be rude after all the help Tod has given me this afternoon.I have no idea what I would have done without him.My room is unutterably stylish and Im not used to such creature comforts.I have thirty minutes and Im going to make the very most of it.Twenty seconds to apply lipstick.Two minutes forty to get dressed.Only one outfit brought for evening so no wasting time choosing that, which leaves exactly twenty seven minutes to soak in a bubble bath.I hit the minibar and pour myself a glass of red wine while the water is running.Closing my eyes, I lay back in the green tea scented foam  the rest of these complimentary toiletries are going in my bag!and relish the fact that this is probably my only bath in four years that hasnt involved the background noise of Petal saying, Are you finished yet, Mummy?Are you finished yet, Mummy?over and over.The temptation to stay here for the rest of the night is very strong, but then I remember that I have a dinner date and I get a rush of something, a long forgotten feeling, that I really dont want to have.This is a business dinner, I remind myself sternly, not a date.The word date shouldnt even have popped into my mind in this context.But as I reluctantly lever myself out of the bath and get ready to go out to dinner, I find my stomach fluttering with excitement.Quickly, while Im pulling on my dress, I telephone home and say good night to Petal.Olly is still crisp with me.A whole day is a long time for Olly to hold a grudge.He must be really mad with me this time.I feel resentful that hes putting me under extra pressure when, quite frankly, I already have enough to deal with.On time, Tod knocks on my door.Hes changed into a grey wool jacket and black jeans.His hair is damp from the shower.I dont really need to say that he looks great, do I?He offers me his arm.Shall we, madam?I take it.Indeed.The restaurant is just a short walk away and its nice to be out in the warm night air instead of the air conditioned chill of the exhibition hall.The place is intimate, buzzing and peopled with couples holding hands.I throw caution to the wind and order lots of things involving garlic, so I wont be tempted to kiss anyone.While we eat and drink too much, Tod laughs at all of my jokes and doles out kind words of encouragement.All the tension of the day seeps out of me and I find myself relaxing  a feeling that Ive started to forget.We talk about fashion and handbags and music and I dont mention my child or my husband once.Afterwards we walk back to the hotel, arm in arm, and when we get to my room door, we both stand there in the corridor.Me awkward, Tod considerably less so.Youre a great lady, he says softly.Thank you.Ive had a lovely evening.Ive enjoyed your company.He takes me in his arms and kisses me tenderly on the cheek.His lips, I think, linger too long.If he asked if he could come into my room now, would I say no?Would I have the strength, the will, to turn him away?Even with a couple of glasses of red wine clouding my vision, I can see how easy it would be to say yes when, with all of my heart, I know that I should say no.It would be so simple to move my head, angle my body and our mouths would meet.A chaste kiss could, with so little effort, become something else entirely.Tod releases me from his embrace.Get straight to bed, Nell, he instructs.Is there a waver is his voice?The warmth of his hands, still on my arms, burns through the thin fabric of my dress.Were the same thoughts going through Tods brain too?Weve got an early start and a lot to do tomorrow.It seems that Ill never know.As I let myself into my room and close the door behind me, I get a moment of wine induced clarity when I realise that he sees me as just a woman to share a pleasant evening with, a business woman.But a woman, first and foremost.Im not Petals mummy.Im not Ollys wife.Im just me.And it frightens me that I like this feeling a bit too much.45      Thanks, Jenny, Olly said.I dont know how wed have managed without you this week.Weve had fun.Havent we, Petal?Jenny lifted his child out of the bath and helped her towel herself down while he leaned against the doorframe.Petal nodded her agreement.We went to the swings.Jenny is good at pushing.No finer compliment, Olly said, impressed.Youre competing with stiff competition, as I am the king of good swing pushers.That right, Petalmeister?Petal high fived him.Now bedtime, young lady.Jenny said that I can have milk and two chocolate digestives.Ah.No wonder she likes you so much.Then to Petal, You have to be quick, Olly said.No dillydallying.I dont dillydally, Daddy, Petal said, affronted by this assault on her blameless character.His daughter had a whole range of tried and tested dilly dallying techniques that he and Nell only just managed to keep ahead of.Actually, if he was honest, they usually lagged woefully behind.They all trooped through to the kitchen and Jenny fulfilled her promise of milk and biscuits.I can make you something to eat, if you like, Jenny said over her shoulder.I picked up a pizza in case you hadnt got anything in.He didnt like to remind her that every night of the week he worked making up pizzas and that it would normally be his last choice on the menu.Thanks, Jen, he said.Thats really thoughtful of you.I hadnt got anything planned.Nells friend was going to stay over tonight so that she could look after Petal while he was working.What time do you start work at the chippy?Im not on tonight, she said.Its tomorrow the juggling starts.Jen would do her shift and then come straight here in time for him to go off.Stay and have something to eat with me?Stay!Stay!Stay!Petal chanted.Jenny grinned and shrugged.OK.Bedtime for you, miss.Can Jenny come and tell me a story?If she wants to.Id like that, she said.He hung back as they all went through to Petals tiny bedroom and whispered to Jenny, No funny voices.No dramatisation.Read it in a monotone voice.If youre too good, shell only want more.Jenny looked at him from under her eyelashes and smiled.In her room, Petal bounced onto her bed and, tenderly, he tucked her in.He and Jen sat next to each other on the bed, backs against the wall, Petal curled up in a ball beside them while Jenny read out the story.Petal had picked The Gruffalo  a story she never tired of.Olly liked it because it was short and you could guarantee getting out of Petals room before midnight.Unfortunately, that was the hour at which she usually came into their bed anyway.As Petal dozed off, they both tiptoed out of the room.Olly closed the door.Ill just go and change the sheets on our bed.Shell probably want to come in with you in the night, if thats OK.Thats fine by me.Does she do that every night?Yeah, Olly admitted.Pretty much.That must be difficult.Its something weve just got into the habit of, he said.But youre probably right; Petal should stay in her own bed by now.You sit down while I throw this pizza in the oven.Itll take me five minutes to swap the sheets.Are they in the bedroom?Yes.Theyre all out and ready.Youve had a busy day and youre going to be up all night.Have a little snooze in front of the telly.That suddenly sounded very appealing.Are you sure?I like looking after people, Jen said.Living on my own, I dont get the chance to do it that often.You leave it all to me.So he did.Dozing off in front of a rerun of Dragons Den until the delicious smell of cooking pizza woke him up.Maybe it was like most other things; pizzas always tasted better when someone else cooked them for you.Hey, he said as Jenny brought a tray over for him.That smells great.I did some garlic bread too.Can you have a beer?Just the one, Olly said.Jenny snapped the top off a bottle and passed it to him.Then she brought her own tray and sat down next to him with it on her lap.This flat is lovely, she said.Cosy.My place is a dump.It costs us a fortune, Olly replied.Especially with the shop downstairs too.But Nells doing well, isnt she?He shrugged.Hard to tell.The bags are selling all right, but the overheads are killers and getting people to pay up is another matter.There always seems to be more money going out than there is coming in.He tucked into the pizza.This is good.Thanks.She seems to be away a lot, Jenny remarked.Tell me about it.Olly tore off some garlic bread.He seemed to have taken over the role of chief cook and bottlewasher at home.All Nell was interested in was handbags, handbags, handbags.He was rapidly becoming sick to death of living and breathing them.Part of him really admired Nell for trying to do this and part of him just wanted his wife at home, them both pottering along in life like they used to.Like Jenny was content to do.Everything they did now involved stress and worry.If I had a hubby like you, she said, I wouldnt be able to tear myself away.Ah, well, Olly said.You know that old saying familiarity breeds contempt?Theres a lot of truth in that.Jenny lowered her eyes.I wouldnt think like that.Olly sighed.Fancy watching this film?He held up the DVD of Marley and Me.Its a bit slushy for my taste but I thought Nell would like it.We never got round to watching it.Thatd be great.The perfect family night.Kid tucked up in bed.Good film.You cant beat a night in front of the telly with some good food and a beer.Yeah, he said with a smile.Youre right.That was Ollys viewpoint exactly.He just knew it wasnt what Nell wanted any more.46      Its closing time on the last day of the show and Im writing up my last Nell McNamara handbag order.I close the book and fight the urge to lie on the floor and sleep.Or to jump in the bath and let the remainder of the sweets close over me like water.Hey.I turn and see Tod standing there.I came by twice today, but each time you were just swamped by people.Next year Ill bring help, I say.I didnt think to organise getting food delivered to my stand, so I havent eaten since I shared breakfast with Tod in the hotel.Now Im starving.I feel completely exhausted after the busiest week of my life, but absolutely invigorated too.Every bone in my body aches, but my mind is whirling.The whole thing was absolutely brilliant.Well worth the ferocious expense.Id do it again in a heartbeat.My stand was a big hit and Ive picked up a dozen or more new stockists for Nell McNamara handbags.Plus my name is out there among the big boys, the players.I sigh to myself.Mission accomplished.The downside is that I feel as if Ive been away for months not a week.Ive seen nothing of Olly or Petal, or any of my pals from the chippy, for aeons and Im so looking forward to reconnecting with everyone.Ill give you a hand in breaking down the stand.I know theres a tight deadline in getting everyone out of the show tonight so that the next event can start to set up tomorrow.All around us is complete mayhem with people racing against the organisers optimistic timescale.Have you got a van coming?Ollys driving down now, I tell him.At least I hope he is.I havent yet had the chance to ring him to see if hes on his way.Youve done brilliantly this week, Nell, Tod says.Im very proud of you.Thanks.Im pretty proud of myself too.Im going off to my house in France for a few weeks.Weve got some time now before Paris Fashion Week.Im taking a well earned break.Its a shame that you couldnt come with me for a few days.I cant tell whats behind his eyes, but Im assuming that he means me alone rather than la famille Meyers en masse.That wouldnt have been possible, Tod.He knows that only too well.But thanks for the thought.For the rest of the week there have been no more untoward moments outside my hotel room  or inside it, for that matter  but it does hang in the air between us slightly.The unresolved kiss, I guess.Make sure that you take some time off, Nell.These trade events really do take it out of you.Dont run down your batteries completely.You need time to recharge.Its not that easy though, is it?If I take my foot off the pedal, even for a minute, will all of my hard work go to waste?One thing that this week has taught me is just how cut throat this business is.Want me to hang around and give you and Olly a hand loading the van?No, no.You get off.Your work here is done.Its probably not the best idea to let Olly see me with Tod as soon as he rocks up.Our phone calls have been somewhat strained and rushed this week, so Im not sure what kind of atmosphere waits for me at home.Thanks so much again.Dont know what Id do without you.I risk a smile at him hoping that he doesnt misconstrue it.In another time, another life, there may have been something between me and Tod, but Im married.Im Mrs Olly Meyers and I mustnt ever forget that.Besides, Ive missed both Olly and Petal like mad this week and cant wait to get home.Ill be back from my break long before we go out to Paris.Want to travel there together?Id like that.So with a kiss, this time very brisk and business like, Tod leaves me to pack up the stand and muse on the last few days.Im still packing handbags back into a big cardboard box when Olly turns up in the hired van.Hey, he says.Hows your week been?Tiring, I admit.But, hopefully, good for business.The show was great.Desperately hard work.And its eaten up an inordinate amount of money.I dont even want to tot up the final numbers.But Im sure its worth it.A lot of buyers came and went, ate my sweets and made the right noises about my handbags.Now I just have to sit tight and wait and see whether it translates into mega orders and, more critically, money in the bank for us.At the moment, I feel as if the business is teetering on a knife edge.One big order from one of the online fashion outlets like ASOS or Boohoo and we could go stratospheric.Fail to get that order and we could just as easily plummet into bankruptcy and I darent even think about that as an option.I want Olly to take me in his arms and hold me and, after a moments hesitation, he does just that.I let myself melt into his embrace.Perhaps thats why things got a little too up close and personal with Tod; all week Ive needed a hug, just someone to hold me.Everything OK?I ask tentatively.Sure, Olly says.Why shouldnt it be?I shrug.Looks like the crisis that was building may well have been averted.Perhaps my absence has made Ollys heart grow fonder.Has Petal missed me?Like crazy.Is Jenny looking after her?Constance is on duty.He fails to meet my eyes.Jen had something else on.Olly picks up a box and busies himself.Did it work out all right with Jen looking after Petal?Yeah, he says.It was fine.But I know that theres something hes not saying.Sure?Positive.Shes a great girl.Then, Come on, lets get all this loaded and get you home again.Home, I think with an internal sigh.Where I belong.With my husband and my daughter.And my dog.And my handbags.47      Olly and I didnt get back until late on Sunday night.It was such a rush to get everything off the stand again and I was so exhausted by the time wed finished that there was no scintillating conversation between us on the way home.To be honest, we barely grunted at each other as we lobbed all the stuff in the van and shot off down the motorway, glad to be out of London.At home, we just collapsed into bed  but not before Id been to look at my beautiful child who was fast asleep in Constances care.On the Monday after my return, I decide to keep the shop shut.The good folks of Hitchin can surely wait until tomorrow for their Nell McNamara handbag requirements to be filled.Im trying to take Tods advice and recharge my batteries  even if its only for one day.Olly and I walk Petal to her pre school session in the morning.I have a moment of panic when I realise that Olly knows all the mums.He fits in seamlessly with them and I dont.Where has my ability to make kiddie small talk gone?Do I really think of nothing else but handbags now?Has work become my whole focus?I feel myself standing on the outside, not knowing any of them, feeling self conscious that Im overdressed in a brightly printed dirndl skirt and ballet pumps and not the ubiquitous jeans and fleece that everyone else is sporting.Although they chat and call out to Olly, they look at me suspiciously, as if a woman going places is not to be trusted.It leaves me feeling unsettled.Did the school mums like me better when I was just working in the chippy?Do they feel threatened by my new career?I dont know.I feel that I dont fit in with the whole fashion crowd either  Im not trendy and chic like they are  and yet I dont know my place here any more.
