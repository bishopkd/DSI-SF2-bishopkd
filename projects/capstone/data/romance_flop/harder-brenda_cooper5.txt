What?I ask.Im trying to figure out your strategy.Who, me?Why would you think I have a strategy?Youre a politician, Caro.Youve always got a strategy.You make me sound so sneaky.No, not sneaky.But you gotta admit, youre not always direct.Maybe thats because youre not so amenable to the direct approach.Amenable, huh?His smile races through me.Dont even pretend not to know what it means.He shakes his head, slow and weary.Im not the one whos pretending.Being indirect isnt the same as pretending.Especially when you know if you ask straight up, youll get shot down.Why dont you try it and find out?Not tonight.You already got what you wanted tonight.I readjust the strap of my bag on my shoulder.Rise up on my toes, bringing my face a little closer to his.My mouth a little closer.Not even close.The breath explodes out of him.He turns his head away.Theres no reason you have to hang around till Im home, you know.I cant lock the door behind me.That gets me another smile, slower and wider, though he still wont look my way.Now youre gonna tell me you need a key.I dont mind hanging around until you get back.Some nights Im on till two.I know.Frankie said.Now he looks me over, head to toe.You sleeping bad again?Sometimes.Most of the time.I stay up late, sleep a few hours, wake up and work, take a nap late in the day if I dont have meetings.My vampire schedule.It was one thing West and I used to have in common.Still do, I guess.Ill get you a key, he says.You can leave when you want.Thanks.I brush past him, hyper aware of his body and the narrowness of the staircase.Conscious that he could reach out, put his hands on me, touch me anywhere, and Id let him.Does he feel that, too?He must.Its right here between us, that knowledge, that love song our bodies never stopped singing.Even mad at him, Id kill to be able to go with him to his room, help him get his boots off.Id die to be able to crawl into the crook of his arm so he could sleep and I could keep him safe.Keep vigil over him.Goodnight, West.Night, Caro.I hold that image of us in my head when I get into the car and start driving through the tunnel of my headlights down the deserted country road.Me and West in his bed together.Me and West, wandering through a wilderness of stars with our hands clasped.Me leading him out.West The morning after Caroline told me she was back in my life whether I liked it or not, I quit smoking.She was just going to keep hounding me if I didnt.I missed the hit I got from those cigarettes, though, and the way the smoke went all the way down to the bottom of my lungs and made it possible for me to breathe when it felt like I couldnt get a full breath in Putnam any other way.After she left that night, I stared after her taillights until they winked around the corner and disappeared.I locked up the apartment and ate leftovers from the dinner Id made my sister.I thought about Caroline spending afternoons and evenings with Frankie.Thought about her in my place, in my kitchen, in my life.I pulled the rest of my cigarettes out of the freezer, opened every pack, broke them apart, and threw them away.Then I leaned a hip against the counter and sparked my lighter in the dark.Spark.Spark.Flame.The whole time, I was trying to convince myself that the flame didnt look like hope, didnt feel like it, but Ive never been any good at that kind of self deception.That spark in the dark, that wavering flickerCaroline.Hope.For me, they were always the same thing.Impossible girl.Thats what I thought when I first met her.She was exactly what I wanted, everything I wanted, and she was impossible.What made her impossible was only my fear.Last time I came to Putnam, I fell in love with her.I claimed a life for myself, then lost it.I didnt want to take that kind of risk againnot with my sister, and not with my own heart.But Caroline lost her future once.She lost everything she believed about herself when her ex put her pictures online.Then she fought to reclaim it.She bit and clawed and scrabbled and took it back.It was the most beautiful thing I ever witnessed.So how stupid was I to think after what I did to her, she would just let me go?Caroline doesnt let things go.I was the last person on earth she should have wanted anything to do with, but try telling that woman what shes supposed to want.Just try it.Ill be over here laughing.She wanted me, so there she was on my porch.There she was with my sister.There she was destroying my cigarettes and pissing me off, telling me I was going to give myself cancer like I didnt fucking know it already.Like I was supposed to care.She was trying to make me care, and I resisted for no reason.Except thats not true.I resisted because I was afraid.What if I couldnt fix what Id done to her?What if I fixed it and lost her anyway, and I found I couldnt come back from losing her a second time?What if I claimed Caroline and discovered all over again that hope is a luxury I dont get to claim?I was afraid.But it didnt matter.Me and Carolineit was going to happen anyway.I was going to let it.That last week of September, that first week of October, I tried to keep my distance, stalling, when all the while I was trying to remember how Id ever done it in the first place.How Id given myself permission to take what I wanted.It sounds easytelling yourself you deserve good things.Letting yourself want them.Letting yourself claim them.It sounds easy, but its not.For a guy like me, its right next door to impossible.I was stuck in Silt.Not just the Silt on the map, but the Silt in my head.The Silt that made me, trained me to survive, and taught me my life was worth precisely nothing.The path that led out of Silt was the one that took me back to Caroline.Once I found it, it was easy.All I had to do was follow the flame.Halfway through the next week, I stand outside the art building before class.I lean against the windows, listening to the smokers talking, joking around.I chew gum to keep my mouth busy, shove my fists in my pockets so I wont bum a smoke off anyone.Half the class is out here.Theres a guy named Raffe, short for Rafael.Hes got dark skin and wild black hair like an afro except it comes to all these points, and he wears a motorcycle jacket but he doesnt seem like a poser.He and this blond girl named Annie smoke and argue about art.Surrealism.Dadaism.Warhol.Avedon.Turner.People Ive never heard of.I listen to them talking about some exhibit in Chicago, realize they actually drove all the way to the city, six hours in the car so they could see this exhibit at a gallery, six hours back, and theyre still fucking arguing about it.Off across the quad, I see Caroline coming.She angles my direction and fetches up in front of me as though the wind just blew her here by accident.Shes picked my sister up twice already since the last time I talked to her.Ive talked myself out of buying cigarettes six times.What do you think about art?I ask.I dont think thats a question I can answer in one sentence.You ever been to Chicago?Sure.Lots of times.Maybe Ill take Frankie sometime.Show her that bean.Go to a baseball game in the spring, or take her by the Art Institute to look at the paintings.Shes never seen anything like that.Carolines gaze sharpens.Have you?No.Im embarrassed to admit it.You should go, then, she says.Raffe and Annie are looking at us.I glance down and realize Carolines standing close.Were talking low.Shes rubbing her hands over her arms in her sweater.Its long and bulky, tied at the waist.It looks warm, but obviously its not warm enough for the chill.You should get going, I tell her.She looks at her watch.I should.See you.She waves goodbye to Raffe and Annie.Calls them by name.Caroline knows all kinds of people.Everybody likes her.I watch her cross the quad.The wind blows her hair around and catches the panels of her sweater, whipping it open with every stride.If I ever learned to paint, Id paint her just like that.Halloweens on Friday.When I get home from work, Carolines in my kitchen, asleep at my table at three in the morning.Next to her elbow is a case of Monster energy drinks like the ones she used to bring me at the bakery.Rise and shine, I say.When she lifts her head, she smiles.All the way, like the sun coming up.Rise and shine.Then her elbow bumps the Monsters, and a cloud drifts over her expression.Sorry, she says.Nothing to be sorry about.Unless you destroyed some other property of mine?Her nose wrinkles.Yeah.I was feeling bad about that.Really?Well, the money part.Krish told me how much a carton of cigarettes costs.I brought you these to make up for it.I figured if youre going to get addicted to a stimulant because youre running yourself ragged, energy drinks are a better choice.Thanks.She gets to her feet.I dont want her to leave.Whatd you and Franks do today?I took her to the Student Senate meeting.You on the senate now?Yeah.How is it?Scintillating.She tosses her hair behind her shoulder.Its a lot longer than it was last year, almost halfway down her back.I want to gather it up in my hands and feel if its heavier.Feel if its different.Shes too skinny, I know that much.And in this light, the circles under her eyes are obvious.When she was with me, Id help her get back to sleep if she woke in the night.You talk to her yet?she asks.Who, Franks?About the bus.No.I need to.Its not just Caroline saying soI get these emails from the counselor at Frankies school, whos got her coming in to his office once a week so he can make sure shes settling in.He keeps suggesting we get together for a little chat, but I cant imagine anything good coming out of that.Bottom line, I go in to see him, hell find out something I dont want him to know.Something about murder and mayhem, something about my work schedule leaving Frankie alone for hours on end, something about me being twenty one years old, too young to have complete responsibility for a ten year old kid.I read his emails, then delete them.Carolines frowning.Shes having a hard time at school.Everybody has a hard time at school.That makes the little V shape between her eyebrows deepen.No, this is worse than that.Something shitty happened today.She was crying in my car after I picked her up.What about?She wouldnt tell me.Fuck.I shove my hands in my pockets, rocking back on my heels.Ill see what I can do.If you want me to try to talk to her, I could Let me deal with my own shit.I say it too harsh, then wish there was a way to take it back.God forbid anyone should try to help you with your shit, West.I dont see why youd want to.Yeah, so youve said.Forget it.Im trying.She shoots me a glare, which I deserve, and starts packing up her stuff.The light gleams in her hair.I soak up the green of her sweater, the way her jeans hug her ass.Im a dick.Im a dick for ogling Carolines ass, but mostly Im a dick because I havent talked to Frankie.I dont want to know whats going on with the bus because I havent got an alternative.Either she takes the bus or I quit my job.I should quit the job.The hours are convenient, though, and the pay is good, so instead Im a dick to Caroline, whose car my sisters crying in.I dont know how to do this.Any of it.Not Frankie and school, not work and having a kid and keeping up with classes, not Caroline in my kitchen in the middle of the night trying to help me when I cant hardly look at her without wanting to apologize to her or kiss her or both.Most of the time, both.I wind the new spare key off my key ring and hold it out.So you can lock up.Thanks.She steps closer to take it.Are you all right?Im drowning.Im exhausted.I miss you.Im such a fucking mess, I feel like people can smell it on meincompetent panic, guilt, worthlessnessand then shes here, and I dont get it.I cant make her leave.I cant figure out what to say.Im fine.Caroline takes another step toward me.I shove my hands into my back pockets and look at the floor, because if I dont All right, she says.All right.After she leaves, I heat up lasagna in the microwave.I check the heat before I go to bed.Even under the covers, I cant seem to get warm.At breakfast the next morning, Frankie tells me, I need different clothes.We just got you different clothes in September.They dont fit me anymore.I look her over, trying to figure out if that can possibly be true.It hasnt even been two months, but maybe shes changing without me noticing.What doesnt fit, your pants?Shirts?All of it.Youve got nothing that fits.She nods her agreement.This wouldnt have anything to do with Caroline telling me you had a real shitty Halloween, would it?No.Because she says I just need new clothes, Frankie insists.Im too fat for all the clothes you bought me.Then she dumps whats left of her breakfast in the trash, sets the plate in the sink, and walks out.I watch her go.Her pants fit just fine.The shirts maybe a little shorter than it was when we bought it?Shes got hips now.Boobs I try not to look at, because I cant get used to them on my kid sister.Where do you want to go?I call to her back.The thrift store.I can buy you new clothes, I say, exasperated.Its not a problem, only Im trying to understand Just drive me to the thrift store, okay?Fine.Great.I have reading to plow through for Russian history first.Frankie spends the morning on the couch watching cartoons and drawing pictures of horses.After lunch, we go shopping.She piles my arms high with jeans and sweatshirts.Everything she picks out is huge.Leggings she has to roll at the waistband, Putnam College hoodies that come down below her butt.This shit doesnt fit you, I say.Youre the one whos always telling me my clothes are too slutty.I never said that.You said I couldnt wear my costume without a coat over it.That was a costume, not your clothes, I tell her.And it wasnt your faultall the costumes are like that now.I shouldve looked before we bought it.She pushes a sweatshirt into my arms.This is what I want.Im trying to make eye contact.Trying to connect with her.If somethings going on with you at school, we should talk about it.Nothings going on.Dont treat me like Im dumb.You cry in Carolines car, you tell me out of the blue you need all new clothes that cover you up like a tent, somethings going on.Why dont you mind your own business?Why dont you tell me what happened at school?Nothing happened.I dont believe you.I dont give a shit if you believe me.Franks, look, whatevers going on, changing your wardrobe is probably not going to fix it.Think about it.Youre too smart for this.Yeah, well maybe I dont want to be smart.Hearing her say she doesnt want to be smartit lights a fuse.I want to shake her, tell her smarts all weve got.Smart is whats going to save her ass from Silt, keep her from turning into Mom, keep her from turning into me.Whats that supposed to mean?I ask.She huffs an exhale.God.Never mind.I grip her arm.Dont take that tone with me.I should be writing a paper right now, but Im here with you, and I think you owe me I dont owe you anything!She pulls away and shoves me hard enough to rock me back on my heels.Buy them or dont.Ill be in the truck.I stand between the racks of clothes in the aisle of the Salvation Army with no idea what Im supposed to do next.Wishing I could ask Caroline.Monday morning, I stop at the student cafe in the Forum for some coffee and see Caroline alone at a table with a book in front of her and a doughnut on a napkin, untouched.Chocolate cake doughnut, glazed.Her favorite.I sit down across from her, pick it up, take a big bite.Dick, she says.Without looking up, she kicks me in the shin.Sitting there, I eat the whole doughnut.The suns shining in the windows across the front of the Forum, bathing her in light.She reads with her mouth slightly open, pushing her tongue into the gap between her teeth.Shes switching from her book to a stack of note cards covered in highlighter, and I recognize the format.Shes got a Latin quiz.Want me to help with your verbs?No.Quit distracting me.I only have ten minutes.I walk up to the counter and buy her a replacement doughnut.She doesnt say another word to me, and its still the best fifteen minutes of my day.When I come home at two a. m.  after my shift that night, I find her pecking away at her laptop in my kitchen.You know the librarys open, right?I ask.Mmm hmm.I open a bag of corn chips.Put some in a bowl so she can share if she wants.She plucks out a chip.Whats your job like?Boring.What do you do?Whatever they tell me.Whatd you do tonight?Measured stuff.They wont let me cut yet.Is cutting more fun?It would be different.Ive never used a miter saw, but you can do tricky cuts, like when youve got to cut 30 degrees on the X axis and 45 on the YI want to see how that works.Or Id like to drive the forklift.When do you get to do that stuff?Not for fucking ages.What are you writing about?Victorian periodicals.Fascinating.No, its good.We had to pick a topic that there were lots of articles about and read a bunch of different journals.I picked the Irish problem.Whats the problem?Basically, they wanted independence.Such a fucking hassle, those Irish.She smiles.You want a beer?I ask without thinking about it.I dont want to think tonight.Im sick of itsick of everything being difficult all the time.I want to do something easy.Beer, couch, Caroline.At two in the morning?Im all jacked up.Probably wont sleep for a while.Why are you jacked up if work was so boring?Those Monsters you bought me.Its only partly true.Im jacked up on her being here, and Im jacked up because Frankie still wont talk to me.I stayed up all last night writing the last of my final projects to clear my incompletes.Im so far behind on sleep, I dont feel like I need it at all.You want a beer or not?I ask.Sure.Im about out of brilliant thoughts for the night anyway.She rolls her shoulders.I snag two beers from the fridge and find a napkin to spit the gum Ive been chewing into so I can eat.Shes raising an eyebrow at me when I turn around.Whats with the gum?Helps with not smoking, I admit.You really quit?Trying.I open the beers and hand her one.I need to sit.I grab the chips and head for the couch, where I turn the TV on to an infomercial for some kind of food chopper.She follows me in and takes a seat on the other end.We watch this skinny, hyped up sales guy try to convince us well fucking die if we dont have his chopper.I can smell her, her hair and her skin, her detergent, the deodorant she wears thats oranges and spices.Do you think Im fucking up?I ask.Yes.You want to wait a sec and find out what it is Im asking about?That makes her smile.No.Because I was asking about Frankie.Hmm.Her grin is self satisfied.Knowing.Ive seen her smile like that when she had my balls in her palm and she was trying to decide just how she wanted to suck my dick to most effectively drive me out of my mind.You think Im fucking up with Frankie, or you think Im fucking up in general?I ask.She just looks at me with her eyes big and round, like, Go on.What else?I ask.Im fucking up with you, too?Fucking up my whole future?Fucking up with school, andand just more or less everything, huh?Shes inclined her head, like she wants to nod along with every question Im asking.Its patronizing, but I dont mind.Shes got on jeans and this soft shirt with buttons partway down the front, and it looks like its been through the wash a thousand times, except Ive never seen it before.I think she must have bought it that way.Its unbuttoned so low that the way shes sitting just now, I can see the middle part of her bra.Theres a useless little bow there, sewed onto that spot.Her jeans are tight and faded across her thighs, and everything about her clothes and her hair falling down out of the knot she tied it up in makes me want to rumple her.Makes me want to test the texture of those jeans, find out if her shirt is soft against my face, if its softer than her breasts, even though I know nothing is.It doesnt help that her shirt is the exact color of her pussy.Just say whatever you want, I tell her.You look like youre gonna die if you dont.She shakes her head.Im not saying anything until you do.What am I supposed to say?She sips her beer.Something about how youre doing.Im doing fine.That gets me a huff of laughter.Something true about how youre doing.You say that like Im lying all the time.She considers this.No, youre not lying.Youre bullshitting me.Which is funny, since I know exactly how you feel about bullshit.The first real conversation I had with her, I gave her a hard time for telling me she was fine when she wasnt.It was bullshit, I told her.The way people went around all the time suffering and claiming to be finewhy couldnt they just say what they felt?Why did everyone have to be so fucking polite when they were dying inside?That was the night she told me that every day she lived through since her pictures turned up online was the worst day of her life.I understand what she meant better than I did a year ago.I drain my beer and set it on the coffee table.Im tired, buzzing, confused about why shes dressed so touchable, sitting relaxed on my couch, sipping her beer, watching me like she can see inside my head.Like she knows exactly how fucked up it is in there, but she doesnt mind it one bit.You want me to tell you something true?I ask.She nods.I want to kiss you.I watch the heat rise up her throat, turning her skin the same color as her shirt.Then why dont you?she asks.I cant remember.Swear to God, I cant fucking remember.Maybe theres no reason at all.Maybe I never had a good reason, and Im just a moron.Maybe Ive always been a moron.Which raises the question why shed go to all this trouble to get me back in her life.Shes looking over my shoulder at the closed blinds.Her foreheads wrinkled, her eyes out of focus the way they get when shes thinking.I had to read this story for class, she says.It was one I already knewO.Henry, The Gift of the Magi.Have you ever read it?I dont think so.I bet you know itits that story about the couple, theyre really poor, and the woman wants to buy something nice for her husband for Christmas, so she cuts off her hair and sells it to buy him a chain for his watch.Only he wants to do something for her, too, and he sells his watch to buy her combs for her hair.She glances at me.What?I never liked that story.Me, neither.But tell me why you dont.Its supposed to be romantic, right?This big sacrifice they make, you go, Aw, true spirit of Christmas.But its not.How so?You can tell me theyre happy under their Christmas tree because theyve got their love, but they had love in the first place, right?Love was never the question.The question was whats he got to give her other than love?He cant keep the house warm.He cant buy her a cruise to the Caribbean or whatever the fuck.All hes got is a watch, and he decides, Okay, Im gonna sell the watch and give her something that makes her feel beautiful.Only it doesnt work, because now shes bald, and that probably makes her even more miserable than she already was.Its a depressing fucking story.I run my hand over the back of my neck, self conscious.I dont know where all those words came from.She just watches me.Its more than I can take.The way she looks on my couch.The way she engages with me like Im important, like everything I say is interesting, like I deserve to be talking to her after what I did when I dont.I fucking dont.Theres my reason why I cant kiss her.Whether its adequateI havent got a clue.I was just surprised, she says, by how much more complicated it was than I expected.How so?She looks at the beer in her hands.Looks at my face.Its supposed to be about sacrifice, she says.The beauty of sacrifice, because he makes this sacrifice for her, and she makes it for him, and its a disaster, like you said.Its depressing.But look what they were willing to do for each other.They already knew what they were willing to do, thoughthats my point.They were trying to feel different for one day, just one day, get away from being starving pathetic losers, and they ended up looking like assholes.You know who really made out?The guy who sold her the watch, and the guy who sold him the combs.I bet those two had a happy fucking Christmas.I bet those two think its a fantastic story.Shes smiling at me.Drinking me up with her eyes.Shes eating away at me, making the black ache inside me bigger and louder.I wish I had a cigarette.I wish I could smack myself over the head with a bottle of booze, put an end to this pressure I feel around her, this longing I cant get rid of.It was just one Christmas, she says.I mean, you have to figure he could go out the next day, sell the watch chain to buy her a nice warm hat to cover her bald head.She could sell the combs and buy him a sweater.Its not over.Yeah, but hows he gonna feel next time he goes to buy her a present?Not good.Hell remember that fuckup with the combs and say to himself, Shit, Ill just buy her a gift certificate, and she can get what she wants with it.They blew all the romance on that one big gesture, and theyre not getting it back.None of that is in the story.No?No.Its in your head.She puts her beer down and pulls her feet up to tuck them underneath herself.Rests her arm on the back of the couch, her cheek on her arm, and looks at me with her eyes all gentle.I just wish shed quit fucking looking at me that way, like Im the baby Moses in a basket, some precious discovery she cant ever get enough of.I wouldnt cut off my hair to buy you a watch chain, she says.I break out in a sweat.I really wouldnt.I think my dad thinks I would, and Bridget and Krishna, too.They think Im like that woman in the story but worse, because I wouldnt stop at my hair.Id sell the furniture, my clothes, my dignity, all to have something to give you.But its not true.I mean, its just hair, and Id probably give you my hair if you wanted it, because whatever.But her hair in the story is her pride.Its the thing that makes her feel beautiful and worthy, and you cant have that.I wont give it to you.I would never give it to you.I try to say, I know that, but the words come out raspy and impossible.I think what you dont know, she says, is that you cant take it from me, either.Even if you sell your watch.I cant ruin her.Thats what she means.I can fuck up, but I cant ruin her.My hands are trembling.I forgot that she does this.Sees right into me and picks me right the fuck apart.Maybe this is what Ive been afraid of.That shed pick me into pieces, and there wont be anything left of me when she does.And you know, she says, the other thing about the story is that her hair will grow back, and she can keep the combs.He can get another watch.Theyre really good gifts.Like, if you gave me some pearl combs, Id probably think, Wow, these are gorgeous.West must have saved up for a long time to pay for them.I wouldnt even think about my hairnot right away.Jesus, I would.I know you would.She rises to her knees and moves to my side.Takes my chin in her fingers until were so close together, closer than weve been since that moment by the grave when I shut myself off from her and told myself it needed to end.That I would have to be the one to end it.Youd sell your watch for me, West, she says.Youd give me those combs and see my bald head and it would break your heart.But what Im trying to tell you is that it doesnt have to be like that.The world isnt like that.Like what?Im staring at her lips.Drinking in her face.It all feels so important, but I cant get a grip on it.Im too tired, my eyes stinging like I could fucking cry.I wish I could.What a relief that would be.Im not someone who can do that, but I cant remember why.If I was made like this, or if I chose it.The worlds not black and white, she tells me.Life doesnt have good guys and bad guys or a beginning, middle, and end.Not while youre living it.Its just people doing stuff thats beautiful or stupid or somewhere in the middle.She cups my face in her hands.Strokes her thumbs over my eyebrows, making me close my eyes and listen hard to what shes saying.So anytime you catch yourself writing a story over top of usanytime you tell yourself youre the bad guy, or you destroyed us, the end, its overthink about that.She leans in and touches her lips to my forehead.It hurts not to take her mouth.To stop myself from pressing her down into the couch, into the soft cushions, touching her and kissing her because I need her and I want her, and because she could make me forget.It wouldnt be fair to use her like that.God, I want to, though.When she moves back and touches her fingers to my lips, I can see that she knows it.Just think about it, she says.I dont have words to give her, so I say, All right.After she leaves, I stay up thinking half the night.Friday morning.Art class.A hundred bucks.The stack of colored paper on the table in front of me cost a hundred bucks, and Im supposed to experiment with it.Try things, Rikki told the class.Rikkis my studio art professor.Shes dressed today like the worlds tiniest pirateboots that go up to her thighs and then flare out and fold over at the top, a glittery sash across one shoulder.Shes from the Netherlands, married to Laurie, which means shes my landlady in addition to my art teacher.Shes also an art therapist, whatever the fuck that is.The idea, Rikki is telling the student sitting in front of me, is to play with how the colors are in a relationship.Work with large and small fields of color to create illusions of difference where there is similarity, illusions of similarity where there is difference.The package of paper contains a hundred and fifty sheets, none of them the same.Sixty six cents a color.The girl at the next table is going crazy with her scissors, snipping chunks out of one sheet after another.Turning money into confetti.I cant bring myself to take scissors to a sixty six cent piece of paper unless Ive got some reason to think its going to amount to something, so I just push the papers around, laying one on top of another, until Rikki chucks me on the shoulder as she walks past and says, Play.I pick up the scissors and open and close the blades a few times.Drop them and shuffle the colors around some more.This is me in Studio Art.Ive never taken an art class before, and probably wouldnt have, but it was so late when I registered that I had to take whatever I could get into, which was nothing I would have picked.In addition to art, Ive got Modern Russian History, Intro to Spanish, and this bizarre African American lit class where all weve done so far is read philosophy about music.Back before I started my first year, Dr.T told me the point of Putnam isnt to specialize or get ready for grad school, its to learn how to learn.Try everything, he said.Keep trying things until you find something that clicks.Learn how to think, ask questions, decide for yourself.I didnt do that, because I wanted to be a doctoralthough looking back, I wonder what the fuck ever made me think that would work out.Four years of undergrad, four years of med school, then residency, loans, studying, no chance even for part time jobswhoevers life that was, it wasnt ever going to be mine.Now Im trying things.Burning money.Feeling like an asshole most of the time, trying to wrap my tongue around rolling an R in Spanish, reading a memoir by this Russian woman who was imprisoned under Stalin.Ive been doing this kind of shit for eight weeks now, but Im not sure what any of it is contributing to my well roundedness.I dont know what cutting up colored bits of paper is going to do for me that I need, either, but I pick up a sheet of deep, dark red and snip a triangle off one corner.Lay it against a bright blue.Lay it against orange.I find a lemony yellow and cut a corner off it.Try again.Play, Rikki says to Raffe on the other side of the room.Playing makes me feel like a dipshit.And besides, this isnt even art.Its math.The textbook makes it sound mysterious, like colors have these properties, and Oh, hey, what do you know?That one looks this way next to that one and this other way next to that other one.When actually, you can assign numbers to hue and value, and theyll follow predictable patterns.Bright pink looks like its vibrating on top of bright green.The pink square looks bigger on the black square and smaller on the white one.It isnt magic.Its just numbers and common sense.Rikki leans over my shoulder.She touches a brown triangle that Id laid over a pale pink one and reverses the order.Nice, this one.But work with bigger pieces, hmm?Its hard to see with such small triangles that you have made.I dont want to waste paper.Always I have one student who is afraid to waste.We will do paintings and you will choose the smallest canvas, or we will make sculpture and you will make something so tiny.She cups her hands in space, showing me the size of my imaginary sculpture.Wasting is what the paper is for.Maybe I just dont like throwing money away.Or maybe you are afraid to take up too much space in the world, she says.I think for my class, you should be as wasteful as you can be.Cut up all the paper.Make the biggest paintings.Then we will see what you can do, hmm?She leaves me alone after that.I push my triangles around, searching for the best arrangements.In the sketchpad Im required to keep, I jot down some guesses for number values and use them to predict which colors will be the best matches.Ill try them out on Frankie later, see if I can trick her with them.Then Ill do bigger versions of the best ones for my portfolio.Its a better approach, more logical than Rikkis.It doesnt have anything to do with how much space I want to take up in the world.Outside after class, Im thinking about whether all studio art classes come with a side of psychoanalysis or if its just Rikkis art therapist thing, when I almost walk into Krishna.I try to go around him.He blocks me.I feint to the other side, spin, and head off in a different direction, annoyed because I dont want to be this guy, but I am this guy, and I wish hed let me alone.In case youre wondering, he says, jogging up behind me, Im not giving up.Ive got class.That was your last one.Now youre going home to study, and then youve got work.What are you, stalking me?I asked Caroline.He runs a few steps to catch up.Theres a lot of foot traffic on the path because class just let out, and in order for Krishna and me to walk side by side, everybody whos coming the other way has to step off into the snowbank and get their ankles wet.Krishna clearly doesnt give a fuck.I kind of like that about him.Im having a party, he says.For my birthday.I want you to come.I cant.Youre supposed to ask when it is in order to make your excuse more plausible.When is it?Tomorrow night.Oh, tomorrow night.I cant.He tries out a signature my shit doesnt stink Krishna grin on me.The winds gusty, blowing his black hair around, making him look like some kind of Desi movie star.Sure you can.Fine.I dont want to.How come?Im busy.Youre always busy.Think of some other excuse, because Im never going to take that one from you.I hate parties.Yeah, but this is my birthday.Youve got to make sacrifices for your friends on their birthdays.I dont have to do anything.Theres a party at Minnehan at eight, so were going to kick ours off at ten.Its at the houseyou know where Im living?Where Carolines living.Of course I know.I cant make it.Sorry.Try.I glance at him.Hes not smiling now.Hes got his hands shoved in his pockets, his dark eyebrows drawn in against the wind and maybe against whatever it is hes feeling right now, which is strange because Krishna usually makes out like he doesnt feel anything.I cant leave my sister to go to a house party.Cant you find someone to watch her?Laurie and Rikki have offered more than once.Even if I could, what am I going to tell her, Look, I know you hardly see me and you havent got any friends or anything, but Im going to be at this house party tonight for some guy youve never mets birthday, dont wait up?Ive met your sister.When?Caroline brings her by.Shes cute.Irrational jealousy grips me.Jealousy of Frankie for having seen Carolines place.Of Krishna for hanging out with my sister while Im at work.Look, I dont think its gonna happen.But happy birthday, all right?He stops.Just stops walking right in the middle of the path, and I keep going for a few steps, but it turns out I cant leave him there like that.Ive been trying to leave him since I left Putnam last spring, and every time I cut him out of my life I feel crueler, but Im accomplishing nothing.Its like hes impervious.Except I know hes not impervious.Krishna hasnt got that many friends.Not real friends.The number of guys Krishna has ever spent a night at home with, drinking and watching basketball and doing more or less nothingIm pretty sure its just one.The number of guys who know what his home life is like, his asshole father who thinks if he doesnt take over the family company in India hes a complete failure as a human beingalso one.I stop moving.Its not all right, he tells me.I know.Im not sure you do.Youve been back in town two months, and its not fucking all right, the way youre acting.I know.Then why dont you do something about it?You think I wouldnt, if I could see some way to?You think Im enjoying myself?Im raising a ten year old, working thirty hours at the fucking window factory, taking classes, and trying to clear all my incompletes from last semester, and I cant put things back the way they were, okay?I cant.Its not possible.His face is grave.Caroline seems to think its possible.Yeah.He rocks up and down on the balls of his feet.Thats all you have to say?Yeah?What do you want me to say, that I have some kind of grand plan where Ive got me and Caroline figured out?He closes the space between us and gets right up in my face, madder than Ive ever seen him.I want you to say youre going to get your head out of your ass and take her back.I dont deserve her back.His gaze lowers to the ground.He kicks a chunk of snow, sending it sailing over the frozen lawn.When he looks up, meets my eyes, I feel the cold seep through my coat and into my bones.I owe you something, he says.You took a fall for me with the cops.You didnt have to do that, and you didnt even hesitate.It fucked me up, and then Bridget told me, look, youre friends.This is what friends do for each other.But then the way you cut me off, cut Caroline off, did whatever it is you did to her that she wont tell methats not how friends act.So, you know, I cant say what you deserve.I dont know if youre the person I thought you were or somebody else.But fucking hell, West, cut me some slack and come to the goddamn party.Make it possible for me to fucking like you again.I cant.I know you cant.Bring your sister and do it anyway.Tomorrow night.For my birthday.Ill make dinner.You cook?Bridgets been teaching me.I think I must smile at that, because he smirks, and then he reaches up and shoves off my hat, running his hand all over my hair.You should shave it off, he says.Go the extra badass mile.Tattoo fuck your mother on my forehead.That would be sweet.Maybe Ill do that for tomorrow.Ill live in suspense.Hes grinning.Its a shamthe banter, the smilebut a sham smile is better than nothing.It was never all that hard to make Krishna happy.I just had to let him hang around me.Talk to him.Throw him a bone every now and then.I never thought much before about whether he was doing the same thing for me.Is Caroline gonna be there?I ask.She lives there.He spins around and saunters away.I go to study, and then I go to work, heading into a whole afternoon and evening of the same shit I always do at the factory.Counting things.Measuring and marking.Loading and unloading.But I notice that the plant smells like cut wood, sawdust, and thats what Im thinking abouthow much I like that smell.How I like the sound of the factory floor, this vast concrete space filled with echoes and the swirling lights on top of the forklifts, the beep of the backup alarm, the clang of metal against stone.I feel like Im waking up.Ive stopped craving cigarettes beyond the occasional random impulse, and in the space where the craving was are sounds and smells, color and numbers, Frankie, Krishna, Caroline.I think about the rest of the week and how, tomorrow morning, I can tell Frankie about dinner at Carolines place.Im looking forward to it.Its been so long since I looked forward to something, I forgot what it was like.It feels good.Dangerous, but good.When my phone rings, I see that Carolines calling me, and that feels pretty fucking good, too, until I hear what it is shes got to say.The school counselors my age.Hes leading me down a hall.Frankie follows, and Caroline brings up the rear.I dont know where were going.When I got here, these three were waiting outside the office, Caroline in the middle of a conversation with the counselor that died as soon as I walked up.The schools deserted.Theyve been here awhiletalking, I guess, dealing with whatever this is.Waiting on me while I told my boss I needed an emergency day off and tore across town to get to the school.Here we are, the counselor says.His names Jeff.He cant be my agenot for real.Hes got to be old enough to have a bachelors.But he doesnt look any older than me, and between the pleasant smile, the soft handshake, and his purple tie, I cant bring myself to trust him.Why dont you three take a few minutes in here to talk privately?he asks.And Mr.Leavitt, when youre ready, Id like to have a brief word before you leave.The door closes, and then its just the three of us standing around a table in a room the size of a walk in closet.It smells like janitorial suppliessweet and woodsy, laced with chemicals.Caroline pulls out a chair for Frankie and takes the seat next to her.Frankie reaches out for her hand.Want to tell me what happened?I ask.My sister shakes her head no.Great.
