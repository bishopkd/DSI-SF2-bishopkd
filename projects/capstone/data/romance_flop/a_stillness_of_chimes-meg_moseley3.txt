Sure, she was rich in terms of real estate, but in terms of family, she was flat broke.She had nobody.Battling a wave of loneliness, she climbed out of the car and faced midday heat that made yesterdays cold rain seem like a bad dream.She didnt know what she hopedor fearedshe would find under that ruined roof or in the outbuildings, if they still stood.Everything, even her grandmas red roses, had disappeared under those greedy vines.Theres nothing left to do but bring in a bulldozer, Cassie said.Nobodys been inside lately, thats for sure.You cant even see the porch steps.I have an old photo of this place when it was new, with Grandpa and Grandma Gantt standing on the steps, a little black dog sitting beside them.They must have been in their early twenties or so.Thats cool.Yes, Mom gave me all the old pictures from the Gantt side of the family a few years ago.Once I find the Flynn pictures, Ill put everything together in an album.Just dont get obsessed with it like my moms obsessed with her scrapbooks.Settling things up here before school startsI dont have time to get obsessed.Later, maybe.I do love digging into family history.Part of being a history teacher, I guess.History geek, you mean, Cassie said with a smile.Laura smiled too and started walking.Lets poke around a little.Thats why we came.Yeah, terrific.Laura led the way to the side of the cabin.Wishing she had a long, strong stick, she gingerly parted the curtain of leaves to peer through a window that long ago lost its glass.The interior was smothered in greenery too.Nobody in his right mind would hide out here, Cassie said.But my dad isnt necessarily in his right mind.He wasnt stupid, though.Hes not here, Laura.He might have been, not long ago.Kudzu grows incredibly fast.It could have covered up any signs that somebody has been here.Youre dreaming.This spot isnt very secluded anymore.People drive past all the time, especially with my dad putting in a new subdivision just around the bend.Cassie held up a finger.Listen.Beyond the bees droning nearby, heavy equipment growled from farther down the road.Metal clanked on metal.Men shouted at each other, their voices softened by distance.Your dads doing quite well, isnt he?He sure is.Cassie made a face.I wish itd rub off on me.Maybe hell want to buy this acreage too.Ill sell it, sooner or later.Just dont sell your moms house.Its too cute.The perfect size for starting a family too, Cassie said.Laura laughed.You and Drew want to buy it?Ill give you a great deal.I wish.No, youd better hang on to it.You never know when you might need it.Laura ignored the comment.They tromped around to the front of the cabin.Cassie groaned and pointed toward the road.Watch out.Here comes the old busybody.Moving with eerie grace, Granny Colfax held her parasol as level as water.Like a neighbor whod been invited for tea, she turned into the driveway, never slowing her pace.The parasol was sun faded and threadbare.It must have been fifty years oldnobody used parasols anymoreand Granny must have been ninety.She was thin as a witch.She came closer, her feet moving relentlessly in red sneakers with the toes cut out.A pale echo of the blue sky, her parasol never wavered.Hey there, Laura called.You picked a warm day for a walk.Yall ought to be ashamed, Granny scolded.Traipsing on other folks land.Snooping in other folks houses.This was my grandparents place, Laura said.I know you.Youre Granny Colfax.Grannys deep set blue eyes drilled into Laura.Cant a body be decent and let a house die in peace?Was she deaf?My grandparents lived here years ago, Laura said, raising her voice.You dont own this land, missy.Yes, I do.She was nearly shouting.It belonged to my grandparents.The Gantts.Im Laura Gantt.Whats that you say?Gantt?Grannys eyes softened.Oh, that red hair.Lord, have mercy.Would you be Jessamyns girl?A lump rose in Lauras throat.Yes, and this is Cassie Cutler.Gary and Ardelle Brights daughter.Granny paid no attention to Cassie.Land sakes, Im sorry about your mother, child.And I still miss your old granny too.She was a fine lady.A strong one.Strong as an ox and stubborn too.You find a lifelong friend like that, honey, you hang onto her.Laura gestured toward Cassie.Ive found one.Ha!You aint lived enough years to know what lifelong means.Granny came closer, smelling like soap.Honest, cleanand astringent.Laura licked her lips, tasting sweat and dust, and felt unreasonable anger rising up against the old woman who was, after all, a trespasser herself.What are you doing here?Laura asked.Oh, I do like to forage.Theres something in every season.Greens and nuts and berries.The old berry patch near the railroad tracks, that was the best one.Remember?Yall used to pick there.Cassie finally chimed in.Yes, we did.Granny faced her.Whats the name of your little sister, girl?Tanya.But everybody calls her Tigger.She married Tom McTavish.Well, aint that nice.And you skedaddled for the West Coast, didnt you?But youre back.Nobody ever stays away if they have any sense.This is the best place on earth.Cassies eyes narrowed.Easy to say if its the only place youve ever seen.Granny hooted.You think youre so smart.Smart and pretty too.Believe me or not, I had my pretty day.I had my day like yours.And yall will have your day like mine.A ghosts fingertip traced Lauras spine.She imagined herself with a shriveled body, an unused womb.Past being useful, past being pretty.Wearing sneakers with the toes cut out.Granny eyed Cassie.I bet your daddy wants to buy this place so he can put in big, fancy houses and make a truckload of money.Cassie shrugged.Maybe.Granny chuckled.Aint no maybe about it.He loves to build big ol houses where country folks kept goats and bees.It dont seem right.City folks dont know the first thing about making scuppernong wine or killing copperheads.They just like their pretty lawns and their air conditioning.Laura stayed silent, remembering Grandpa Gantt.Hed never had central air.Never wanted it.Hed said it liked to give a body pneumonia.The last time she saw him, hed been whittling on the porch in the summertime heat.Theyd both been whittlers, her grandpa and her dad.What would her grandparents have said if theyd known their only son might stage his own drowning someday?Theyd been so proud of him.Their soldier boy, theyd called him, but Laura had only known him as a craftsman and a musician.A father who was kind and gentlemost of the time.Granny planted herself directly in front of Laura and cupped her chin in a wrinkled hand.You fretting about those rumors?Do you think theyre true?What I think dont have a thing to do with it, honey.Is that why youre here?Looking for your dad?I thought, maybe, since he grew up here Its the first place you come to, aint it?Laura nodded, her captive chin moving against Grannys callused fingers.Well, then.Granny took her hand away.Why would he stay right where folks would look first?Hes smarter than that.Youre probably right.He went to war a boy, come home a grown man whod seen too much.But he didnt get no heros welcome like the boys who fought in the world wars.It aint right.Granny patted Lauras shoulder.But be done cryin, girl.Tears cant put the spilt milk back in the jug.You remember that.Im not crying.Im just Whats done is done, and if a man did the best he knew to do, thats that.Therell come a day when well answer to God, every one of us, yes, and Hell answer us.He wont answer to us, you understand, because Hes God, but Hell answer.Lord, how Hell answer.I want answers now, Laura said.Not in the sweet by and by.No, youd best leave things alone.Leave it be.Granny turned to go, then looked over her shoulder.Might be snakes, so dont go prowlin around too much.Dont tempt God no more.You hear me?Yes maam, I hear you.Laura bit back a comment on Grannys unwise choice of footwear for foragingon land that wasnt hers.The old hypocrite.Good bye, then, Granny said crisply.She set her blue gaze on the road and picked her way back down the driveway, holding the parasol like a mace.A mockingbird flew up from a bush smothered with vines.The bird swooped behind the house where kudzu draped pines formed giant sculptures, strange and beautiful and looming like time.In a hundred yearsor two hundred, what did it matter?the lush growth would cover other abandoned houses, along with their pools and tennis courts.Mockingbirds would still fly.Old women would still lecture young women and envy and pity them.You about ready to go?Cassie asked.First I want to know if the outbuildings survived.Cassie folded her arms across her chest.Go right ahead.Im staying here.Laura waded across a relatively shallow stretch of kudzu, trying not to think about snakes, and stopped near the corner of the cabin.Shielding her eyes against the glare of the sun, she searched the piles and mounds and mountains of green where the shed and barn used to be, might still be.Even if theyd collapsed, they might provide a corner of shelter.Dad, she called.Are you there?Her voice sounded faint and far away, as if it were drowning in the vines too.She tried again, louder.Dad!Elliott Gantt!Do you hear me?There was no answer, of course, but two crows flew over, cawing.The old womans voice whispered in Lauras imagination: Hes smarter than that.Granny Colfax had spoken of him in the present tense.Maybe shed misspoken, or maybea crazy thoughtit had been a deliberate hint.Laura turned and tramped back to the car, making a mental list of possible clues.Grannys slip of the tongueif thats what it was.The prowler in the yard.Prestons story.Even the way her dad hadnt seemed like himself in the weeks between his big blowup and his disappearance.She didnt believe for a minute that his accusation of infidelity was true, but if hed believed it Cassie was already opening her door.Lets go.Hes not here.Why are you so sure?Give him a chance!Tears filled Cassies eyes.Youre just torturing yourself.We need to face it, Laura.Heshes dead.The words swept Laura back to the first time shed heard someone say her father was dead.The finality of the statement still made her heart ache.Now she couldnt let anyone trample her newborn scrap of hope that it hadnt been final after all.Hes alive.Her voice shook.I saw him.Cassies fair skin paled further.She dived into the passenger seat, leaving the door open, and stared up at Laura.Here?Now?No, last night.At the house.Walking through the yard in the wee hours.And you really believe it was your dad?Laura hesitated.I didnt get a good look at him, she admitted.Did you call the cops?No.Im not calling the law down on my dads head.But what if it wasnt him?What if it was some random pervert?Thats an awfully strong conclusion to jump to.Yeah, but you know how those creeps show up sometimes.What if this guy comes back?What if he breaks in?Laura walked around to her own door and climbed in.I know where my dads guns are, and I know how to use them.If you wont report it, I will.Cassie dug her phone out of her jeans.Dont you dare.Look, if it happens again, Ill call 911oror somebody.Promise?I promise.Cassie squinted at her.Ill hold you to it.She put her phone away.Thinking shed better go solo on her future investigations, Laura started the engine.As she turned onto the road, she caught a glimpse of Grannys faded parasol disappearing around the bend, heading farther out of town.Then a black pickup truck approached from the other direction.Ugh, Cassie said as the truck rattled closer.Thats Dale Halloran.Laura tried to catch a glimpse of the driver, but the truck was already past them.She hit the brakes, wanting to keep it in sight.Are you sure?Positive.Hes driven the same nasty old truck for years, and Id know his ugly mug anywhere too, beard or no beard.Man, how on earth did Sean and Keith turn out so good lookin and sweet?I dont know.Laura frowned into the rearview mirror.The trucks brake lights lit up.Ha!I got you to admit Seans good lookin and sweet.Oh, stop it.As Cassie prattled on, Laura watched in the mirror.The truck slowed to a crawl and made the turn into the Gantt driveway.Slightly comforted to know Dale would find the cabin empty, she decided to buy a few No Trespassing signs and post them as soon as possible.Dale had become a regular visitor at the boxy little house hed once owned.When Sean got home from a run to an ATM, Dale waited in his beat up truck in the driveway, pulling on a bottle of Jim Beam.He followed Sean inside, parked his raw boned frame on the couch, and started rambling about his trucks brakes, the price of gas, and how his best buddy had landed in jail over a little misunderstanding about a woman.It wasnt a social call.Dale wanted something.He always wanted something.In recent weeks, hed grown a scruffy beard.If he was cultivating the outlaw look, it wasnt far from the truth.People kept hiring him for odd jobs, though, knowing he did decent work when he was sober.He got by.Bottle in hand, he heaved himself off the couch, ambled into the kitchen, and opened the refrigerator.Pretty near empty.You got nothin to feed your old man?Sean sat on his hearth and picked up the mandolin that lay in its case beside him.He tried a little riff hed been working on but messed it up.No time to shop, he said.You know.The upcoming festivities.You got no time for nothin but your lutherie.Dale gave the word a ridiculous, pseudo French pronunciation.Youre a pansy, boy.When I die, Ill leave you the pansy gun.Gee, thanks.Cant wait.Its all thats left.Sean focused on the notes again and got them right.They reminded him of Turkey in the Straw.He segued into the happy, fast moving tune, hoping it might dispel the gloom that entered the house whenever Dale did.Dale came back and leaned against the mantel, his eyes bleary slits.So, the Gantt girls back in town.I bet shes still a good girl.He winked.You could fix that.Keep your filthy thoughts to yourself.Dale raised his hand.Sean flinched, a reflex he thought hed conquered.Whats wrong?Dale leaned closer, giving off the familiar smells of booze and onions.Ol crazy man Gantt isnt around to protect your sorry butt?Or is he?I dont know, Dale.You tell me.I hope hes alive and well.At least as well as a psycho can be.Keepin an eye on our fair city from afar.That last phrase sounded like Elliotts old fashioned speech.Coming from Dale, it was cruel mockery.Sean returned the mandolin to its case, latched it, and tucked it safely away behind him.If Elliott is around, youd better not try to beat me like you used to.He could kill you with his bare hands.Like he nearly killed Gary Bright?Dont exaggerate.It was a little scuffle between friends.You always stick up for your hero, dont you?Well see what kind of hero he is now, after living like an animal for years.Dale reached under his shirt and scratched his belly.What kind of man runs out on his wife and lets her think hes dead?At least I didnt do that.No, but his cruelty would have run her off if she hadnt died first.Sean held his tongue.You believe hes back, boy?No.You should.Somebody saw him on Sunday at the old church camp out by the lake.Somebody else saw him on Redberry Road last night about dusk.Somebody thought they saw him, Sean said.They saw him, all right.And I can find him.Oh, youll just lie in wait somewhere and outsmart him?Not likely.Its plenty likely.When I find him, Ill truss him up like a deer and drop him off at the nearest funny farm.You got any clues about where he might be?Sorry.Im not going to waste my time on wild gossip.Well, excuse me, Mr.Luthier.Id better let you get back to your hard, hard work.Dale pulled his keys out of his pocket and jingled them.Ill be on my way.Sean checked the time and stood up.He could play chauffeur and still make it back in time to meet his customer.Ill drive you home.No, you wont.One of these days, youll kill somebody.It might be you, but we cant count on it.He reached out to seize Dales keys.Back off, sonny, or youll be sorry.Dales voice was like a rasp on wood.Bone deep memories of pain seized Sean as if theyd been imprinted on his body as well as on his brain.A boot in his knee, a fist on his jaw.Even with youth and sobriety on his side, he wouldnt win.He could match Dales strength but not his mean streak.Fine.Drive yourself home.Hey, gimme a little cash first.Just to tide me over.Ill pay you back.You never pay me back.Tell you what.Sell me the pansy gun.Ill give you a fair price.Nope.Im not selling.And Im not lending unless you want to leave the gun as collateral.If you dont pay me back, I keep the gun.No deal.With the too careful movements of mild inebriation, Dale headed for the door.He slapped the half painted wall.Good luck with this ol shack.You know, I never wouldve lost it if Gantt hadnt called the cops on me.He didnt call the cops.Sure he did, and then he lied about it.Elliott wasnt the one who was lying about things.You calling me a liar, boy?It figures.Gantt had you fooled.You needed every whack I ever gave you, but those idiots wouldnt even let me raise my own boy the way I saw fit.Thats how I lost everything.They stacked the deck against me.Sean shook his head.Always the innocent victim.That was Dale.Leaving the door open, Dale walked across the lawn toward his truck.He was listing slightly to the left, but he made it into the truck without mishap.Backing out of the driveway, he rolled to the other side of the street and nearly hit Mrs.Gibsons mailbox and the container of garish silk flowers at its base.Sean dialed the sheriffs department.The dispatcher assured him shed take care of it.Within minutes, a cruiser would be on Stringer Road, hunting a DUI in a beat up, black GMC pickup.He nearly suggested that they search Dales tacky little studio apartment so they could bust him for being a felon in possession of a firearm, but the pansy gun really was all he had left.Long after Dales truck had rattled away, Sean stood looking out the window.He had a lot to think about, and he wished he could talk things over with Jess.Sometimes it hit him all over again as if hed just heard the news.Jess was gone.His mentors widow, his girlfriends mom.Ex girlfriend.Even after Laura dumped him and moved away, though, Jess had always been happy to start a pot of coffee and talk about books or music or politics.Except, somehow, every conversation was ultimately about her.She was kind and easygoing but also quite self absorbed.He pulled out the mandolin again, started playing and humming Shady Grove.Peaches in the summertime, apples in the fall.If I cant get the girl I love, wont have none at all.He abandoned the instrument and looked out the window.A movement in the trees caught his attention.He braced himself to see a man in camo, but it was only a wind tossed branch against the sunset.He had to watch himself.Laura nearly had him believing those incredible rumors.Like hed nearly talked himself into believing some other loony notions, years ago.The long ago memories plagued him still, so weird that they might have been hallucinations.He tried to summon the details of a day late in the summer hed turned twelve.Hed been sweating in the brush above old man Bennetts private lake, hiding there because hed heard a car coming, down below, and hed been run off twice before for trespassing.He didnt want to make it three times and wind up in the backseat of a cop car.Dale would have whipped him half to death.But as it turned out, it wasnt Bennett driving up to the lake.Sean gave his head a hard shake.Hed never told a soul what hed seen, least of all the authorities.A trespassing Halloraneven if he was only a kidwouldnt have found a friendly audience in the sheriffs department back then.Now the memory seemed so odd that he hardly trusted his own recollection.His cell phone rang.He pounced on it.Lauras number.Maybe she wanted to tell him about the birthday party.He put the phone to his ear, enjoying the notion that her voice didnt have to travel from a faraway state.She was back where she belonged.Hey there, he said.Hey, Sean.Do me a favor?Sure.Anything.Come pick a lock for me.Sean sat on the floor of Jesss den with his back against the wall and studied the cedar chest.Small, flat topped, rectangular, the wheeled chest was set on short but graceful legs and stood low enough to serve as a coffee table.Hed installed its brass keyhole straight and true, with his mentor watching over his shoulder to make sure.For a beginners work, it was a nice piece, but only because Elliott wouldnt settle for less.Now Laura couldnt find a key.A few water rings marred the tophed have to rub them outbut the dark red wood was still beautiful, its warm color accented with lighter streaks.Like Lauras sun streaked hair in the summertime.He smiled, remembering the green plum wars theyd fought in the alley behind his house.Shed played like a boy, loud and fierce but fair.Well, mostly fair.Once, she and Cassie climbed to the roof of a shed and ambushed him with a bucketful of rock hard green plums.The girls had hugged each other and screamed for joy.Lauras scream could scare a banshee.Looking at the chest again, he wondered if a few wiggles with the skinniest screwdriver on his Leatherman might do the trick.But maybe he wouldnt need it.Sometimes Jess had hidden spare keys in brilliantly obvious places.On a hunch, he slid his hand across the smooth underside of the chest.There it was.A small, hard bump.Tipping the chest up, he spotted a square of gray duct tape.Typical.Jess had used duct tape for everything.He turned the key in the lock, raised the lid, and jumped.Dark brown eyes stared up at him.His heart thudding, he let out a shaky laugh.It was only a red haired, life sized baby doll.Lauras favorite.It had only one leg due to an accident.Laura had hauled it all over town on the handlebars of her bike during those years when she couldnt decide if she was a girly girl or a tomboy.Maybe she still hadnt decided.The grimy doll and her grimier white dress lay in a clutter of sentimental stuff that included Lauras baby book, a tiny pink dress that must have been hers as a newborn, and some crayon drawings she might have made in kindergarten or so.That was only the top layer.He flicked the dolls stiff lashed eyes closed.They popped open again, keeping their plastic gaze on him.The right arm hung crookedly from its socket.I got it, Laura, he called.She ran in from the kitchen, drying her hands on a dishtowel.Her eyes were as wide as the dolls.Thanks, Sean.Youre the fastest lock picker in town.No, just the smartest.I found a key taped on the underside.She slung the towel onto a chair and smiled at the doll.Well, would you look at that.I remember her.Katie.Katie needs a little medical attention.Sean manipulated the dislocated arm until it snapped back into the socket.There.Thats fixed, anyway, and a little WD 40 might fix the eyelids.Thanks, but dont bother.I wouldnt get fifty cents for her if I had a yard sale.You dont want to keep her?Wellmaybe.Laura knelt beside the chest and sorted through the clutter, making a pile on the floor.The baby book, the pink dress, some snapshots.An old fashioned red and white gingham apron.Gram Flynn made that for Mom, but she never wore it, she said with a half smile.She didnt want to spill on it.Isnt that what aprons are for?Catching spills?Laura nodded.She put the apron on the floor and gave it a pat before she resumed pulling items out of the chest.Sean set down the doll, picked up the photos and thumbed through them.One was a nice shot of Elliott, Jess, and Gibby Sprague, standing in front of a blooming dogwood tree with their arms around each other.Whenever Gibby came through town, hed visited the Gantts.Theyd had fantastic jam sessions with Doc Marsh and Noodle Hammond.Sometimes Jess had sung along in a smooth alto that contrasted beautifully with Gibbys low, gravelly voice.I always wonder if Gibbys trying to be another Johnny Cash, Sean said.He always wears black.Always lets his hair grow too long Like somebody else I know.Laura gave Seans hair a stern look.And like somebody else you know, Gibby always wows the ladies.Ignoring the bait, she leaned closer to study the photo.I took that picture.I think it was the year he was between his second and third wives.Hes probably on his sixth by now.Probably.I cant help but like the guy, though.And admit it, Laura.You and Cassie had major crushes on hima middle aged manwhen you were thirteen or fourteen.He wasnt trying to make her mad, but an angry blush hit her cheeks.Her pale skin made a beautiful canvas for it.Im too nice to tease you about your crush on Shania Twain, she said.I did not have a Oh yes, you did.Okay, I did.Im over Shania, but theres someone else Ill never get over.Once again acting as if she hadnt heard, she pointed out a photo of orange lilies.Moms hems.Say what?Daylilies.Hemerocallis is the botanical name.Some daylily lovers call them hems.She reached into the chest again and brought out a slender book.Oh, I hopeno, its just a book of poems.Her obvious disappointment piqued his curiosity.What kind of book were you hoping for?Id like to find her journals.I havent really started looking yet, though.Dont you feel at all funny about wanting to read your moms private journals?Yes, but Im so curious, especially considering the rumors.She opened the book and bent over it, her hair hiding her face.Anyway, remember how shed fill the last page of a journal and just toss it on a shelf somewhere?She was always so casual about it that I figure she never wrote anything too personal.She paused, turning a page.But once Dad disappeared and I moved to Denver, she was living alone.She might have felt more freedom to write anything.About your dad, you mean?Laura nodded.Id love to read what she wrote just after he disappeared.She raised her head but wouldnt quite look him in the eye.I dont want to say this, she said softly.I dont even like to think it.He leaned closer so he could catch every hushed word.Whatever it is, it will stay between us.Finally, she met his gaze, her eyes shining with tears.I think she might have suspected that he didnt really drown.No way.Wouldnt she have said something to you?Probably not.She wouldnt even listen to me when I came up with my theory about an accident and amnesia or something.Then everything got kind of strained between us, and I left for college.Laura shut the book and stared down at it.I dont know, he said cautiously.The whole premise that he staged it doesnt feel solid.If he took such great pains to disappear, why would he come back at all?And why now, after twelve years?Laura nibbled on a fingernail and shook her head.Maybemaybe he heard about her death somehow, and it was a jolt to his mind.Or maybe he guessed Id be back for the funeral and he wanted to see me, at least from a distance.Sean fought the impulse to reach for her hand.I hope thats not just wishful thinking.Consider the big picture, though.She looked up.If the timing of the sightings is related to my moms death, it points to my dad because nobody else would be more affected by it.Think about his background too.His survival skills.And his problems.Disappearing for years isnt rational behavior, but he wasnt always completely rational.She motioned toward a book lying on the floor beside the recliner.PTSD, maybe.Doc Marsh let me borrow a book, and Ive been reading up on it.A little research cant hurt, I guess.She reached into the chest again.She brought out a pile of newspaper clippings, more photos, and a chain that held Elliotts dog tag and a silver cross.He wasnt wearing those, that day on the lake?Sean asked.I thought he wore them all the time.Sometimes he would leave them hanging up somewhere for days.I never knew why.Never asked.I didnt want to set him off.She leaned back against the couch beside him and fingered the cross and dog tag.Id love to give them back to him, she said.To welcome him home.Sean kept his mouth shut.He didnt want to burst her bubble.She lowered the lid on the empty chest and handed him the key.I want you to take it.Excuse me?I want you to have the chest.It was the first project you ever did with my dad.I thought it might mean something to you, and I have all these other things.She made a sweeping motion that took in the whole room, filled with furniture and instruments that Elliott had crafted.Sean would have preferred one of the instruments, but Laura hadnt offered that option.He studied the key for a moment, then put it in his pocket and met her eyes.Thanks, Laura.Id like that very much.She scrambled to her feet, leaving the mementos on the floor.Ill help you carry it outside, she said briskly, bending to lift one end of the chest.He took the other end, and they hauled the empty chest out to his truck.He padded it with an old tarp, shut the tailgate, and sighed.Laura would use him as her free locksmith, and shed even give him a piece of furniture she treasured, but she wouldnt breathe a word about that silly birthday party.Apparently shed rather go alone.Thank you, he said.The chest does mean a lot to me.She stuck her hands in her pockets and looked up at him.Did my dad mean a lot to you?What kind of question is that?He rescued me from Dale.Saved my life, probably, or at least my sanity.He meant the world to me.Then will you stop assuming hes dead?I dont understand why you refuse to see it any other way.He shook his head, unwilling to admit to himself, let alone to Laura, why Elliotts return might be disastrous.Lets not argue.Listen, I need to get home.I have a customer coming at eight.Okay, she said in a tight, locked up voice.He wanted to wrap his arms around her and tell her to cry on his shoulder, but she might have slugged him for it.So he settled for telling her good night and driving away.He didnt let himself look in the rearview mirror for the quick, on off on flicker of the porch light that had once been her way of saying Good night.I love you.It wouldnt happen.Shed dropped that habit on his eighteenth birthday.Still in her pajamas at half past eight the next morning, Laura backed out of her moms crowded closet and shut the door.No journals there.Just too many reminders of her missing parents.Both of them.She headed down the hall to try the deep but narrow closet in the guest room.The low wattage bulb didnt do a lot of good.Wishing shed brought a flashlight, she pushed her way past electric fans, space heaters, and cardboard file boxes.Spotting a small carton labeled For Laura, she opened it and found the old photos from the Flynn side of the family.It would have been a more exciting find if shed had family to share it with.Her only Flynn relatives were distant cousins in distant places.Setting the box of photos aside for later, she pushed farther into the closet.At the very back sat three large boxes.Someone had helpfully labeled them with a thick black marker: Journals.But that wasnt her mothers graceful penmanship.Ardelle, Laura whispered.Of all the nerve.She tugged the first box into the light and went back for the other two.None of them were taped shut.Each one held an assortment of journals, ranging from cheap spiral bound notebooks to expensive hardcovers.A quick check of their dates showed that Ardelle had packed them in chronological order.Had she read them too?In no time, Laura found the journals that covered the year she turned eighteen.Cross legged on the floor, she opened a thick hardcover notebook that started about a month before her dads disappearance.Skimming carefully but quickly through the July entries, she found no mention of his worsening moods or even a hint of marital discord.Her mouth dry, Laura flipped the pages to August and the very day hed disappeared: If E.  has any luck, well have fish for supperwith veggies, of course.The usual overabundance of tomatoes, cukes, and zukes.Why did I plant so much zucchini??She turned the page slowly, delaying the moment, then made herself read the entry for the following morning: E.  is gone.L.  walks around like a ghost.I cant bear to write.I cant bear it.The facing page held only a short entry written weeks later: Seems strange that L.  is so far away.College should have been an adventure.Not like this.Now S.  is the one who walks around like a ghost.The remaining pages of the book were blank.Not wanting to revisit her abrupt departure from Seans life, Laura opened the next volume.It started near the end of September.The morning glories are at their finest.I hope we wont have an early frost this year.I always hate to lose them before their time.More slowly now, Laura reviewed the months preceding and following her dads disappearance.She saw no clue that her mom believed hed staged it.There was no mention of handsome and flirtatious Gibby Sprague, either.No indication that her mom had been unfaithful in thought or deed.That wasnt surprising, given the way shed so carelessly left her journals lying around, but it reinforced Lauras belief that her dads accusation had no basis in reality.She sampled older journals too.An entry on a February day: E.  built a bluebird house for me.On another page: E.  took me to that new Italian place for my birthday.Nice atmosphere, decent marinara.In one of the other boxes, Laura found the journal from the summer before she entered seventh grade.The summer her dads problems intensified.There wasnt a word about his growing depression, though.Not a word about the blowups, always sparked by some trivial thing and followed by heartfelt apologies.Not a word about a father daughter clash over nail polish, either.Looking back now, from an adults perspective, Laura knew the nail polish was only a trigger.She browsed through more of the journals.In beautiful penmanship, using a variety of colored inks, her mother had written about gardening, weather, birds.Books and movies.Shed written about a retirement party for a cousin in North Carolina and a fender bender in downtown Prospect.Shed even described the three cats curled up on the bed like furry throw pillows.Except for an occasional mention of Laura, almost everything was about her.Jessamyn Gantt.Her plans, her hobbies, and her superficial pet peeves.In more recent years, shed even tried her hand at analyzing her dreams.No wonder shed never bothered to hide the chronicles of her life.Shed portrayed a lovely, unreal world, all sweetness and light.Maybe shed used her daily scribblings, as shed called them, to create the life she wished shed had.If Ardelle had snooped, she couldnt have found anything interesting, Laura thought with some satisfaction.She toyed with the idea of confronting Ardelle about her prying ways, but they probably stemmed from her OCD tendencies.Better let it go.Anyway, after a month of feeding the cat, watering the plants, and bringing in the mail, she deserved sincere thanks, not a rebuke.Standing up to stretch, Laura decided to put together a gift basket.She had to go out anyway to pick up the signs to post at the cabin.It would be fun to shop in downtown Prospect again, especially if she called Cassie to ask for some ideas first.Sudden tears took Laura by surprise.She didnt have a mom to shop for anymore.Gift basket in hand, Laura stood on the Brights driveway and lifted her eyes to the distant peaks and ridges fading into the late morning haze.Now that shed grown accustomed to the Rockies, the southern Appalachians looked like mere foothills.And now that shed become familiar with Colorados mountain chickadees, the Carolina chickadees of the South looked and sounded different.Not wrong, just different, like the southern accents that had become alien to her ears.Even the common endearments of the Southhoney, sugar, darlinsounded strange now.And they never came from Sean anymore.She swallowed hard and turned toward the house.The dirt was too orange.The sweet tea was too sweet.The pines were too skinny.She rapped the shiny brass door knocker on the elegant door and waited.Coming, Gary hollered from somewhere inside.He opened the door a minute later and grinned.Well, if it aint my favorite schoolteacher.Come on in, sweetie, but Cassies not here.Shes having lunch with her mother in law.I know.We just talked this morning.Im actually here to see Ardelle.Is she home?She sure is.Ardie, come out of your cave!Lauras here.Theres no rush, Laura said, stepping inside.I could stand here all day and enjoy the view.He smiled toward the back of the house and the windows that looked over an in ground pool and miles and miles of hazy mountains.Its nice, isnt it?Breathtaking.Enjoy it for me.He opened a briefcase on a table by the door and chucked some papers into it.Im off to work.Glad I didnt miss seeing you, though.Tall, big boned Ardelle came around the corner wearing a hideous red and black running suit sprinkled with white cat hair.The source of the cat hair, fat and fluffy Arabella, trotted along behind her.Why, Laura!What a nice surprise.This is to thank you for taking care of Mikey and everything.Laura handed her the basket.I dont know what I would have done without you.Oh, it was a pleasure, Laura.Hes the funniest old thing.But look at all this loot!She rummaged in the basket.Coffee and tea and chocolates.Special scrapbook papers.Stickers and ribbons and stamps.She looked up, smiling.How did you know Ive taken up scrapping?Cassie told me youre really into your scrapbooks.She thought you might like to adopt my houseplants too.Would you?Ardelles eyes widened.The plants from the funeral?Oh, honey, you should keep them.They were given in memory of your sweet mother.But I cant haul them back to Colorado.Id love to give you as many as youd like.After all, youre the one who took care of them for me.I dont have a green thumb like your mother did, butwell, I could sure enough try.Ardelle seemed to be trying for a solemn expression but couldnt quite keep the eagerness out of her voice.If you dont mind.Of course I dont mind.Theyre already in the car.Every last one of them.All of them?Oh, how nice!Gary, would you help Laura bring them in?And Ill clear a space for them somewhere.Maybe by the fireplace?Its already empty and swept for the summer Gary followed Laura out to her car, and they began hauling plants inside: ferns, lilies, philodendrons, a small weeping fig, and others that Laura couldnt identify.As she and Gary brought in more plants, Ardelle arranged and rearranged them in front of the empty fireplace.Theres nothing left but a couple of African violets, Laura said.Ill get those last two, Gary.I know you need to get to work.Okay, Ill be on my way.Bye, Ardelle.He picked up his briefcase and blew her a kiss, then followed Laura outside and shut the door.That was very kind of you.Its nothing.Ardelle was very kind to look after things for me.She enjoyed it, I think.She always likes to be helpful.She certainly did.A small flock of crows flew over, drawing Lauras attention to the sky where a trio of buzzards spiraled on an updraft, so high above the mountains that they must have been able to see every mountaintop and valley for miles around.I wonder if my dads out there somewhere watching those buzzards, she blurted.Aw, Laura, honey.Its not likely.So youre on that side of the fence, huh?You think hes gone?Im just trying to be realistic, Gary said gently.She sighed.I know.Thank you for being honest.And thank you for being loyal and kind to my dad.He must have blown up at you a hundred times, but you always forgave him and went on being his friend.Thats what friends do.He was a loyal friend to me too.Like a brother.Lord, I miss him.And your mom.Everybody does.His face somber, Gary gestured vaguely toward the house.Just look at all those plants from the funeral.Everybody loved her.I still cant believe shes gone.Me either.Laura gave him a hug.For half a second, she pretended she was hugging her dadbut her dad would have smelled like sawdust or campfires, not aftershave.Her dad wouldnt be well fed and well dressed.If he was up in the mountains, he was all alone.Out of his mind, maybe, or at least nursing a broken heart.She wanted to let the tears come.She wanted Gary to pat her back and tell her everything would be fine.To say that she wasnt alone, even if her parents were both gone.But she swallowed hard and stepped away.Id better let you go before I blubber all over you.He made a big show of examining his shirt.Now how am I supposed to go to work if you smeared snot on me?She smacked his arm in mock offense.Smear it off again.When did you start taking smart mouth lessons from Cassie, young lady?They both started laughing.It was a blessed relief after too many moments of barely controlled grief.Gary started walking toward the garage.If theres ever anything we can do for you, just call.Okay.Thanks, Gary.He hit his remote.The garage door slid up smoothly, revealing his black Cadillac.Ardelles sassy little yellow convertible was missing, so Cassie must have taken it.For a moment Laura envied the Brights, for her dads sake, yet she liked to believe her dad would be happy for his old friends too.Gary and Ardelle had always been kind and generous, and it was wonderful to see them prosper.She pulled the two African violets out of the car and took them inside.As she shut the door, her breath caught in her throat.Back in her moms kitchen, the helter skelter placement of the plants hadnt affected her this way.Here, the carefully arranged greenery on the white marble hearth took her back to her mothers memorial service and the plants and flowers massed around the white casket in front of the altar.Ardelle finished fluffing the fronds of a Boston fern.Is that it?Yes, these are the last two.Theyre gorgeous, Ardelle said.Theyll be perfect, right in front.She placed the white violets on the left and the purple ones on the right, then switched them.There, thats better.She turned around.Can you stay and visit for a while?This big ol house gets lonesome.I wish I could, but Im meeting someone in a few minutes.Ardelles face brightened.Sean?No, not Sean.Laura started for the door with Ardelle right behind her.Ill see you soon, Ardelle.Did Cassie invite you and Sean to Trevors birthday party?Laura made a face and kept moving.Umno.I asked her to, but she must have forgotten.Were having a little family party on Saturday night, about six, and wed love it if yall could join us.Think you can?Laura couldnt think of an excuse not to.Slowly, she turned to face Ardelles eager smile.Wellit might work.Maybe.Thanks for the invitation.Wonderful!Well have so much fun.And itll be good to see Sean.We hardly ever see him anymore.Oh, and I intend to drop off some supper for you sometime soon.We cant let you starve.Im not starving.I promise.Laura gave Ardelle a quick hug and then fled in earnest.Shoot, she whispered, running for her car.Maybe shed find a way out.Maybe she wouldnt even need to mention it to Sean.The poor guy.He would hate every minute of it.Next stop, the cabin.Shed bought four glaringly orange No Trespassing signs to post around the property.Sean would notice them, sooner or later, and he would probably ask why she thought they were necessary.She still didnt want to tell him about seeing Dales truck stopping there.Sean would blast Dale, stirring up more hard feelings on his part.About to climb into her car, she looked up.The buzzards were still there, so high above the endless mountains that they were only specks circling in the blue.Maybe her dad really was watching them too.Did he remember watching her and her mom on the lake shore the day he walked away?Did he feel guilty?Did he know how it felt to suddenly learn you werent loved, after all?Maybe he did, or at least he thought he did, but two wrongs didnt make a right.Neither did three.Come home, Laura whispered.Ill be watching for you.Cassie stepped out of the thrift shop with her purchase, a beautiful shirt for almost nothing.Drew would say shed done well, but she still felt guilty for buying something that wasnt strictly necessary.He was probably rolling quarters for gas money.Eating beans and rice while she ate well.Shed enjoyed lunch at her in laws house though, and it would be even more fun to tool around town in an expensive little car.She needed some time alone too.She was beginning to understand the burdens that Laura and Jess must have carried.The tensions.The worries.The constant watching and wondering.Elliotts problems had been much worse than a touch of OCD too.Much more draining.She glanced at the vehicles crawling through the roundabout by the old courthouse.Half tourist trap and half hick town, Prospect had several one way streets and roundabouts that made navigation a headache even for natives who knew where they were going.On weekends, with tourists clogging the streets, everything backed up.Shading her eyes against the sun, she studied the three story building across the street.Her dad owned it now, but the Halloran name was carved into a decorative slab near the top of the third floor.The letters stood out in stark relief in the sun.Below the name, roman numerals gave the year it was built1925and a carving above the entrance portrayed ears of corn, sheaves of grain, grapes, and hops.Those long ago Hallorans hadnt been shy about the source of their wealth.The beautiful old landmark had fallen into disrepair, but her dad had transformed it.Trendy shops and a caf flourished on the ground floor.The second floor held high class office space, and the third floor had become luxury apartments.One of the apartment dwellers had risked planting red geraniums in a window box.Not a smart move when a late frost might still hit, but as her dad liked to say, risk takers got ahead.Cassie brought her hand to her temple in a quick salute.Way to go, fat cat, she said, not caring who might hear her.But all the money in the world wouldnt make him happy if they couldnt figure out what was going on with her mom.Frowning, Cassie looked across the street at the old diner, still a popular spot in spite of the competition from the new caf.Shed tried to talk her mom into going out for breakfast, but she wasnt interested.Her mom wasnt even interested in clothes and makeup anymore.She was a neat freak about everything else, but she slopped around her picture perfect house in ugly, baggy clothes.Cassie started hoofing it toward her moms car, its vivid paint conspicuous among the other vehicles parked at the curb.Her dad called it Bright yellow as if it were a trademarked shade like a designer paint.Cassie, is that really you?someone called from halfway down the block.Cassie turned around and spotted slow talking, slow walking Kim Milton strolling along the sidewalk.A sheriffs deputy now but out of uniform, she was even prettier than shed been in high school, thanks to softer makeup and gently highlighted hair.Hey, Kim.Its good to see you.Its been awhile.Are you doing all right?Still living in California?Yes, and its wonderful.Cassie decided to keep the not so wonderful parts to herself.I hear Lauras in town too.Yes, she is.Cassies mind went straight to Lauras prowler.Youre still with the sheriffs department, right?Yes maam.Kim seemed to swell with pride.Whats the sheriffs take on the wild stories about her dad?He says were already overworked and understaffed, and until we have solid evidence that Mr.Gantt is alive, well assume hes dead.Thats only the sheriffs opinion, though.You think hes alive?Im open to the idea, Kim said.Stranger things have happened.Cassie hesitated.It was tempting to tell Kim about the prowlerafter all, she was in law enforcementbut Laura would be livid.Kims eyes focused on something behind Cassie.She looked over her shoulder.Sean was walking up behind her, carrying a paper bag from the old time hardware store on the corner.Cassie grinned.Sean!Boy, am I glad to see you.Good afternoon, ladies.He pulled Cassie into an old friends kind of hug.Mrs.Cutler.Long time no see.Way too long, Cassie said.How are ya?Not bad.He released Cassie and gave Kim one of those gorgeous smiles that he should have been saving for Laura.
