More clouds had shrouded the sun so only the thinnest reeds of light filtered through the high windows.Off, far out to sea, I could hear the crotchets of a thunderhead.I tiptoed across the time worn flagstones to the passage leading below.There were oil lamps on the table as before, but I boldly opted for darkness.Many times Ive heard Joe Hawkins say that if you are ever trying to hide at night, never take a lamp; it will make you an easy target.Sometimes it is better to curse the darkness than to light a single candle.So, cursing the darkness, I began to descend into the perpetual night of the crypt.I felt my way slowly down the uneven steps, my heart taking up an uncomfortably large portion of my chest.One step at a time, one heartbeat at a time, I found that my exploring toes could discover no more ledges ahead.I must be in the crypt.It was not even the tick of a timepiece later that I heard the door swing open at the stair head and the sound of rapid footfalls.It took me a few seconds to react, then I ran; no, I flew along the rough perpendicular of the wall, scratching my arms as I brushed its jagged surface.One thing only was importantto get as far away from those invading footsteps as was possible in the moment before they reached the cavern.As soon as I saw the light from the passage, I stopped dead.I could only press myself desperately against the wall and wait with my heart playing a rapid tattoo against my rib cage.Two men had entered the clammy vault and their voices reached me as clearly as a crystal chime.No, dont speak to me in French, Pierre.You will never learn English if you do not persist in practicing it!His voice was filled with the exasperated patience with which one explains things to a slow witted child.I am so busy keeping you and Thomas out of trouble that I have had no time to complete my own work.Oh, why can they not send me men who have been properly trained?Ah, you are the smart one always, eh?At least give the boy credit.It stands to reason that if the mansion was burning to the ground then the so conscientious Milord would move his precious documents to a place of safety.Imbecile!Is a place of safety the care of a child?Surely the fact alone that she possessed it should indicate that the contents of the box were valueless.The speaker had his back to me but I knew who it was without a single doubt.Not necessarily so, my fine buck.Milord is a very subtle man.How do you know that he wouldnt do just that thing to throw us off the scent?Because Milord has real operatives to use.He does not have to work with fools like I do, the familiar voice snapped.I dont know who is more stupid, Thomas with his midnight flittings and mansion burnings or you with your wild duck chases.You have deserted your post watching the marquis, wasted the afternoon, and risked exposure for a box of useless old maps.How many times must I tell you two to do nothing, no thing, without my prior consent.This has been the most inefficient assignment I have ever undertaken in England, and all due to the blunderings of two oafs.Napoleon will know why this mission has been a failure.I promise you.If you want your missions not to fail then you must tell the general to give you the permission to assassinate Monsieur le Marquis.It is he that destroys all the plans.When I would bribe, then I find he is there first.When I would steal, then I find it has already been removed.He is the devil and smarter than you, though you will not admit it and blame all on your comrades.Oaf!Foolish oaf!We are looking for a list of English operatives in France, not a packet of obsolete sea charts.I know there is such a list.Henri saw it with his own eyes once, when he cooked in the Warrington household.We would have had it that night we broke into Warrington Place had not you been such a fool and shot the old man before we could force it out of him.A messy business!And you and Thomas with your ridiculous playing with fireworks, like children on Bastille Day.If you would stay away from young Warrington, he would not recognize youthere is no need to kill him.Now Henri, he had to die.He was a good cook and a patriotic Frenchman, and he wasnt too proud to take my money for his services, but he wanted too much, he threatened to expose the whole operation to the marquis and I had to kill him with my own hands.A most disgusting business, but necessary.Ha!said Sacre Bleu.What a hypocrite you are!Killing is necessary only to save your own worthless neck, but everyone else can just hang.A circle of light from the area of the steps revealed that a third person was joining them.I agree with Pierre one hundred percent!said the new arrival.You oafs stick together, right, Thomas?the other man replied to the newcomerThomas the groom!Well see whos an oaf, said Thomas.You two bloody winners are in here jawing like old women and left it up to me to find Dearbornes Jupiter tied up in the wood outside.And I found this next to it.He held up the flounce I had torn from my dress.Do you think she saw you?said Thomas.Did the girl see you?Merde, said Sacre Bleu.I hope not.I realized in that instant that the combined light of the two lanterns would make me visible to any of the men happening to look in my direction.I frantically wished myself invisible, and stood stock still against the wall.Why dont you ask her yourself?said the other man, his voice heavy with sarcasm.Shes standing right behind you.Involuntarily, I let out a gasp of fright.Sacre bleu, so she is!How could she ride the stallionmy God, he is a killer, gasped Thomas.They were all looking at me with speculative eyes.She cant stay on the tamest nag in the stable.Shes tougher than she looks.The lantern was brought closer.Arent you, Elizabeth dear?If you had stayed in bed a few days longer, you would not now be in a great deal of trouble, said Dr.Brent.Seventeen I stood painfully, quietly numbed with fright.Dr.Brent; Thomas the groom.It would have been shock enough to learn these men were spies if I were standing in the town square with the noonday sun streaming down, but here in a dripping subterranean chamber, it was macabre.Spies?They were murderers!And now I knew and they knew that I knew.And I was at their mercy.The man I called Sacre Bleu grabbed my arm aggressively, his calloused fingers pressing hard.Where is the marquis, eh?You will not lie to me or I will make you regret it.My dear Pierre, purred Dr.Brent, if you had not disobeyed orders, and left your watch, then you would know where the marquis is.And if you had any intelligence, then you would guess.Pierre Sacre Bleu gave a crude curse and released me.All right, smart one, where is the marquis?snarled Pierre.Probably, he is out searching for the mademoiselle here, which is why, Thomas, you will take the stallion and lose it somewhere in the countryside.I dont want the nag found around here.Someone might have seen the girl riding it.Dr.Brent took one step closer to me, gathered a lock of my hair between his fingers, and rubbed it slowly with his thumb.When one knows a little of Miss Cordell, all becomes clear.You see, Pierre, she must have seen you in Mudbury and followed you hereits obvious that the marquis knows nothing of her presence here or he would not have allowed it.Ah well, good enough.To search for this little one will keep His Lordships mind away from us tonight.Dr.Brent turned to Thomas.Go now, Thomas, take the horse.Into the patter of Thomass retreating footsteps, Brent called, And take him far!Brent turned back to me.So, Elizabeth, you have fallen into my lap, if I may be so bold, like a red, juicy little plum.Pray do not cower so.I have no thought of injuring you.The cruelty in his voice was as unyielding as a granite wall, but I pulled myself up with what I hoped would pass for dignity.Thats better, although I see you are still as stiff as a corpse, pardon the expression.I swallowed.I would rather not pardon the expression, if you dont mind.As you wish.He released my hair after giving it a sharp, admonishing tug.You are an unexpected guest here and it is my place to show you hospitality.I had not expected this pleasure, but I am not too surprised.You have seemed fascinated for some time with Pierre; so much so that you follow him every time you cross his path, like a friendless pup.I myself cannot fathom the attraction, for to me he is ugly.Butto each his own.I apologize for the chloroform last month in the woods, but it was necessary, you see.I was trying to break you of an unseemly infatuation with my homely partner.In the lamplight, Sacre Bleu was glaring daggers at Dr.Brent.What are you going to do with me?I asked.My voice quivered hollowly in the chamber.What are we going to do with you?Pierre and I have often asked ourselves that.Before now, we really had no use for you.You have been so closely guarded that it was difficult to see if you had any say in the matter.But here you are, he spread his hands expansively, a gift of Lord Dearbornes underestimation of your disobedience.That does not answer my question.I tried to keep my voice steady.Pardon me.There are two alternatives.One, I could kill youbut what a waste of trs jolie femme, you are quite a work of art, nest ce pas?I wondered if I was going to be sick.It was a possibility, the way my insides were behaving.Yes, killing would be the easy way out; I am an important operative for His Majesty Napoleon Bonaparte and I really cannot risk being identified.But I am returning to France tonight.I have overstayed my welcome and my adopted motherland awaits me with open arms.So I shall take you with me.France?No!Why?Oh, why?If you are leaving England tonight, surely it cant matter to you that I have seen you.I mean, you will have left England.If you leave me here I give you my word that I will say nothing to anyone until you are gone.I swear it.I prided myself on being a much better liar these days.Evidently, Dr.Brent didnt think so.My word, what a child, he sneered.Sometimes, little cherry, you are too disingenuous for belief.There will be other trips to England for me.Napoleon will have more need of information before France has brought England under her heel.France cannot afford to leave alive anyone who could put me out of business, or the only operatives that would remain are clumsy fellows like Thomas and Pierre.I wondered with surprising dispassion if I was going to be killed instead of merely kidnapped.And perhaps Monsieur the Marquis will not be so cool toward us when I hold you in the, er, palm of my hand.Ah, dont look so dismayed, petite.Life need not be so bleak for you, I can be a charming fellow and I will teach you how to please me, eh?He turned to Pierre and ordered him to tie my hands behind my back.We go to the tower now, such a useful view from there.One can signal to ships far at sea.I assumed I was to be taken then.To the clock tower, the one I had always found so forbidding, standing like a sentinel gazing for Napoleons troops.Do you have to tie them so tightly?I said through clenched teeth.Pain is good for the soul, said Dr.Brent.Pierre pushed me roughly in front of him as Dr.Brent led the way.We went deeper into the crypt, round an absolutely black corner, and ducked to the left.We were walking on stone no longer, but on hard packed dirt.I realized that we were in an ancient smugglers passageway.We walked in silence for a few moments, the monotonous blackness of the surroundings broken only by the thin circle of light from the lamp and an occasional skittering rat.I began to hear a dull, wooden roar.The surf, my dear, said Dr.Brent.Pierre will steady you from behind; we are about to ascend a ladder.Rather than steady me, Sacre Bleu grabbed me bodily round the waist and lifted me up the ladder.Suddenly, we were inside the tower and the light from the lamp was superfluous.The thin rays of the late afternoon sun were attempting to stream through the dusty stained glass windows.Be so kind as to follow with us up the stairs, Brent said.The view from the top is stunning.I always wanted to see the clock room, but I had never had the nerve to climb up the spiral staircase which wound up the inside of the tower.Now the problem of nerve was taken care of and I would get my wish.One should always try to look on the bright side.I tried not to look down and followed my captors up the steps and through the small doorway into the clock room.The heat of the place made me feel faint and it was some moments before I could get my breath.The clockworks clanked and whirred noisily in the golden light.There was a thick covering of dust.I could see a drop of sweat run down Dr.Brents cheek, leaving a trail behind it.Pierre, open the window.Not that one, fool, the one toward the sea.A clean salt breeze swept through the room and I could feel my skin cooling.Much better, eh, Elizabeth?I stepped back uneasily as he advanced to stand in front of me.What a shy creature you are.His smile was serpentine.I could see that now more than ever.Merely, I am going to help you to sit down.Regard the wooden chair to your left.Yes, the appearance may be a trifle unstable, but it should hold your slender form with no trouble.His hands pressed cruelly down on my stiff shoulders until I was seated.Now, he continued, you must school yourself to sit quietly while Pierre and I conduct some little business.I must caution you, my dear, to behave very well.If you are a trouble, Im afraid that it will be more convenient to dispatch you to your Maker.Ah, I see that you can see reason.What a delightfully intelligent girl.Only for now, you ghoul!The more passive I was now, the less they would be on their guard.Oh God, I had to escape.Please, please, let there be help for me somewhere.Suddenly I thought of Mrs.Goodbody identifying my lifeless body.Her face would beno, I couldnt imagine what it would be.Where had I been in heaven when they were handing out brainsout picking berries?Dr.Brent (I wondered what his name really was) and Pierre sat together at the rickety pine table.Brent pulled out some papers and they gazed at them, talking in French, their voices rising and falling rhythmically with the surf washing outside.I watched through the window behind them as a black thunderhead sailed in majestically and began to overwhelm the late afternoon light, brilliant rays shooting high into the sky as the sun made a futile effort to stay alive.Sacre Bleu lit a candle and the conspirators faces took on an even more sinister aspect.The bumps and craters in Sacre Bleus cucumber nose were accentuated in the wavering candlelight, and a gold tooth glinted as he talked.Dr.Brents face seemed carved out of marble.Their voices were drowned in a clap of thunder, and, as if making amends for my own unwillingness to cry, the sky began to weep torrentially.I sympathized.The former arid heat of the chamber was soon replaced by a clammy draft and I was to find that cold was added to my other physical miseries.After a while my bound wrists became mercifully numb, but the burning throb in my limbs was increasing.My afternoon in the saddle was catching up to me with a vengeance.I wondered whether the ache in my stomach was hunger or fear.A piercing pain bit at my temples and my stiff neck felt inadequate to hold up the satiny heaviness of my head.With a dismal clarity I recalled the time I had followed Sacre Bleu into the woods, the blow on the head, the aftermath in the arms of Lord Dearborne.I had laid my head against his chest as he carried me home in front of him.Jupiters strides had slid like silk over silk.I remembered, too, the shamed realization that the marquiss touch had aroused those first stirrings of pleasure in me.His flirtations under the honeysuckle bush, the moment at Lady Catherines ball when he had pulled me against him, his light friendliness on the hillside on the way to London; these were times of glowing sensation for me, however little they had meant to Lord Dearborne.Heart stricken, I realized that these might be the only such moments I would ever have.I felt a sudden bright warmth under my eyelids.A clatter on the stairs far below us indicated the approach of a visitor.Dr.Brent and Sacre Bleu heard it also, and without a word Sacre Bleu stationed himself behind the door, wielding a wicked looking truncheon.The steps continued their advance.Rest easy, boys, its only me, said Thomas.Sacre Bleu relaxed his stance as Thomas burst through the door, shaking water from his greatcoat like an unruly dog.Put down the club, Pierre.If you knock me on the head, youll get no victuals.He appraised my condition, but made no remark.Placing my box of maps on the floor, he produced a loaf of bread, a wheel of cheese, and a bottle of wine from out of his coat.Why in the devils name did you bring those maps along?said Dr.Brent.I thought we might be able to use them, he said defensively.Cant you give the boy some credit?said Sacre Bleu.If he had left them someone might have found them.Forget it, said Dr.Brent with an impatient wave.Your methods of operating are beyond me.Lets have the refreshments.Pierre and I have had a hard afternoon of intrigue while you have been running about the countryside getting wet.The three of them sat down again around the table and began scattering crumbs as I watched.Id be damned if I was going to ask for any.Suddenly Dr.Brent looked in my direction and feigned great surprise, slapping himself on the forehead.Elizabeth, my dear, I completely forgot about you.I wish you had, I muttered.But you must be starving.He sauntered over to my corner and crouched down beside me, brushing away a strand of hair that had fallen across my face.Dont touch me.But I was going to untie your hands so you could eat.Since you wish me not to touch you, I may have to have Pierre untie you.But Pierre is busily eating, so I will just ignore your desires.You must eat, he said, roughly freeing my hands from behind my back.That beautiful body of yours will otherwise become but a fence post.Dr.Brent tore a crust of bread and a rind of cheese and tossed them into my lap.I rubbed my wrists and winced involuntarily as the blood came rushing back.He smirked slyly at my pained expression.I thought you were married to the Hippocratic oath, I flashed angrily.Ha!Thomas grinned nastily.He is a hypocritical oaf and as for his doctoring, I would not trust him to pull a splinter from the paw of a dog!I took a small bite of the bread, though it almost choked me as it lodged halfway down my dry throat But how did you fool all of your patients?And Dr.Lindham?You were his assistant.Dr.Lindham knows even less about medicine than I do, for all his distinguished appearance.My father was a doctor, and I know what a farce it is.All you have to do is nod your head and look wise, use large Latin words, and when I ever had to treat anyone, I just gave them opium.You should be glad the marquis contacted me to treat your overdose, for it is one thing I am expert at.Any other ailment and he would have been on to me for sure.Dearborne is no fool.But why pose as a doctor?I asked him.Because I get to poke around the countryside and gain access to peoples secrets.Mudbury is centrally located, close to the coast of France, and populated with yokels.Who is going to suspect me, no matter who they see me talking to?The rain drummed steadily on the roof.Thomas, he said.Leave off your chompings and keep watch for the ship.It should be along any moment, and we dont want to miss the signal.Thomas did not leave off his chompings, but instead took a large hunk of bread and stood by the window.Sacre Bleu and Dr.Brent resumed their desultory French conversation, Dr.Brent keeping an eye on me while I finished choking down my food.There now, all finished, he said.I must tie your hands again, my dear.He stood behind me and performed the task, adding an extra twist before he left off.Now go back to your corner.I will bring you some wine.I went back to my corner and sat with my back to the wall, so I could gaze enviously at the gulls wheeling in the storm.The clich free as a bird gained new meaning.Here you are, dear, said my captor.The wine I promised you.You dont expect me to drink that, I said.Youll drink it or I shall require Pierres assistance to hold open your lovely mouth, he said, affecting a frightening aspect.Pierre will be minus his fingers, I shot back at him.Such spirit, he said.No, I was joking.This is just wine.See, I will drink half of it myself.He did so, but I still did not trust him.So be thirsty, he shrugged, finishing the bottle.I will talk to Pierre.He is more interesting than you.Distraught with misery, I gazed out at the storm and wondered if I could reach the window sufficiently ahead of my captors to throw myself out.I tried to imagine what my last moments of life would be like, twisting and turning, the wind rushing through the dark as I plummeted from the tower.There would be a blinding flash of pain as I collided with the rocks far below; then I would be one with the gulls and the storm.I was trying to raise my courage, to shed my hold on life, and was about to make the attempt, when I heard something.Wait and listen, I told my disbelieving ears.Through the crying of the gulls, the thundering of the wind and surf, the rattle of the rain against the roof, the ticking of the clockworks, and the talk of my captors, came a sound that, thin and low as it was, sounded to me like the clarion call of a thousand bugles.Dear and familiar to me from a hot summer day, it was a sound which brought hope rushing back into my heart like a cavalry charge.The marquis was blowing a grass whistle, unless my naughty sisters had left their beds to rescue me.It had to be him; only he would know what the sound meant to me, from our moment under the honeysuckle bush.He was close to me, probably in the wood at the base of the tower, and I would bolt from them when we left.Better to die in the attempt than to be dragged across the English Channel with a half mad spy.I see the signal, shouted Thomas.Hes right, for once, said Dr.Brent, leaping to the window.We will soon be treading the Champs lyses.Pierre, get the pistols.He turned to me.And you, my dear.It is time to begin our journey.You will walk behind Pierre, I will walk behind you, and Thomas will bring up the rear, carrying our baggage like the pack mule he is.And one more thing.Dont try to flee.It is a deserted area and no one will hear your screams when I catch you and beat you with the buckle end of my belt.I staggered to my feet as best I could with my hands tied behind my back.I can barely walk, I said.How am I going to flee?He gave me an ugly smile and pushed me in front of him.Let me help you, he said.Thomas, bring the candle.We were making our way down the staircase, the sounds of the storm ringing hollow in the interior of the tower.Our shadows cast giant grotesque shapes on the far wall as we spiraled downward.We reached the bottom of the stairs and paused for a moment, Dr.Brent cocking an ear.Snuff the candle and we will be out, he said.Thomas obeyed his orders with a quick motion.As a precaution, we will cock our pistols.Three clicks rang ominously.Well, Pierre, open the door.Are you waiting for Christmas?We were out in the open, a windy drizzle was prickling my skin.Dr.Brent halted us again.If we could only be underway.He listened and shrugged.Lets be off, he said, pushing me again.Five steps, I thought to myself.Five more steps.Two three four I took a deep breath and ran as hard as I could into the darkness at my left, my bound hands bumping uselessly behind me.Shes there!shouted Thomas.Elizabeth, get down!came the marquiss voice.By way of obedience I tripped on the wet grass and fell to my face with such a jar that my wind was knocked out of me.Now!shouted the marquis.A dozen lamps were uncovered at once, and the three scoundrels were standing in a brilliant circle of light.Damn your eyes, Dearborne, shouted Dr.Brent.He crouched down with his companions and a blistering crossfire opened up over my hapless head.The noise was deafening, but in a few moments it was rocketing away over the cliffs and gone, leaving only the plaintive cries of the wheeling gulls.The three friends of Napoleon had sung their last Marseillaise.Eighteen Before I had even caught my breath, I was dragged ruthlessly to my feet.Elizabeth, you little idiot, what in the hell possessed you to gallop across the green like a bolting sheep?Good God, did those bastards tie your wrists?Quit wriggling, damnit!There.You can thank God, whichever one youre worshipping now, that youre already covered with bruises or so help me Id beat the hell out of you.Lord Dearborne was in a royal temper and it sounded to me like the singing of an angelic choir; under the rough anger there was the pure, unmistakable undertone of a caress.He slid his satin lined cloak around my shoulders, tying it at the neck with impatient fingers.Lesley?Good.Take her to the coach and take care that she doesnt break her silly neck tripping over the damned cape.Lord Peterby took my arm and pulled me along behind him.Come on, you little wretch, youve only got a few dozen yards to walk.After Dr.Brent, even Lesley Peterby seemed like a pussycat.What a limp!What in Gods name did they do to you?Nothing.At least, not much more than tell me they were going to take me to France.Oh, and they tied me to a chair and gave me rancid cheese and stale bread for supper, though I cant say I felt much appetite anyway.I tried to match my stumbles to Peterbys long strides.We were walking in the direction of the nearby side road.I should imagine not, returned Lord Peterby drily.Why did you tear away from them like that?Dont you realize that was precisely the provocation they needed to gun you down?Of course, but anything was better than going with them to France.And when I heard Nicky whistling on the blade of grass, I hoped I hoped I broke off in confusion, it was the first time I had ever called my august fianc by his pet name.Nitwit.He whistled so that you would avoid panicking.As though we didnt spend the entire afternoon concocting plans to separate you safely from your so charming companions.There is practically a regiment of soldiers from here to the beach, ready to perform a gallant and safe rescue.Then you ruin the whole thing by taking off like a hare before the hounds.And if Dearborne hadnt been so quick on the trigger Brent almost got the chance to send a bullet through you.We had reached the coach and I was happy to see it was Lord Dearbornes discreetly luxurious traveling chariot and not Lady Peterbys bouncing laudet.I dont think that I could have endured another jolting trip that day.Lord Peterby lifted me in and I leaned back against the velvety pillows.But Lord Peterby, how did you know that I was in there?I could see Lord Peterbys grin in the glow of the oil flambeau.Half the town saw you riding hell for leather after a grizzly stranger and a wagon, mounted precariously on Jupiter.Those facts, added to a somewhat rueful knowledge of your generally reckless and impulsive character, led Nicky to the correct conclusion.Unfortunately, by the time he got here, you had already been taken.There were so many things that I couldnt understand.But Lord Peterby Lesley, he interrupted.Oh, all right then, Lesley, I said with crabby obedience.How did he know to come to Dyle?Dearborne has known for some time about their rendezvous here.The man you followed here is a notorious agent who was identified several months ago by one of Christophers servants.We identified Thomas, too, after Christophers firecracker turned out to have more of a bang than he intended.But why not arrest them then?Because Dearborne hoped that they would lead us to their leader.The eel has been slipping in and out of England for years, creating havoc, and it wasnt until this afternoon that they found out that Dr.Brent was the disguise of one of Napoleons cleverest operatives.Lovely.And in the meantime letting Thomas and Pierre terrorize a lot of innocent citizens, I cried indignantly.Nonsense.There wasnt any danger if you had only obeyed a few simple rules.Thomas was watched every moment.And there were a couple of full time men on the trail of your Sacre Bleu.I gasped.And which of your wonderful men was watching Thomas the night he decided to burn down Barfrestly Manor?Lesley frowned.Our man had no idea of Thomass intentions in that instance.He was thought to have been going to another rendezvous with Pierre, so the tail was much too loose.When he finally got down to business, our man was too far behind.Mistakes like that are too common in our business.Our business?You work in the War Department as well?I shall never sleep soundly again.I am not actually employed in the War Office, so rest easy.I just help Nicky out occasionally.I know my way around Londons brothels and low life casinos.It is a knowledge which Nicky finds useful.There was some shouting and commotion outside the carriage.I should go, Nicky will need some help with the details, he said.He opened the door.Wait, L Lesley, I reached out and touched him on the shoulder.I never did thank you for getting me out of the slums.Lord Peterby took my outstretched hand and raised it to his lips.Thank me by refraining from sauntering off on more perilous expeditions in the future.A bright ironic smile lightened his features, and he paused on the carriage steps.Nicky is getting a rare handful in you.And he was gone before I could decide whether or not to acquit him of double entendre.Exhausted, I leaned back in the plush seat of the coach and yawned.My wrists were aching, and far away I could hear men talking.The rain had slowed to a drizzle.Through the window of the coach I saw the clouds part to let through a brilliant full moon, which seemed to wink at me confidentially.It was near two oclock in the morning.I must have dozed off, for I was returned into half consciousness by the forward lurch of the coach.Careful, efficient hands were propping the pillows more comfortably beneath my drowsy head and tying the slipping cloak more securely around my neck.I peeped surreptitiously beneath my drooping eyelids to glimpse the pure classical profile and shining red gold hair.Lord Nicholas Dearborne, Marquis of Lorne, was leaning back against the opposite side of the coach, his long legs stretched out in front of him.I noticed that his hands were stuffed firmly into the pockets of his jacket.Returning my breathing to what I optimistically believed to be the rhythmic cadences of sleep, I leaned limply over onto Lord Dearbornes shoulder with what I hoped was the guileless innocence of a slumbering child.It was a pretty lame trick, Ill admit, but it was the best that I could think of on the spur of the moment.Lord Dearborne stiffened momentarily, then pulled his hand from his pocket and slid it obligingly around my shoulders.I was lying there trying to think up a way to provoke further action when I felt the back of my wicked lovers hand rubbing lightly against my breast.I wrenched myself upright.Rake!How dare you take advantage of a woman pretending to be asleep?How did you know that I was awake?I dont knowintuition, I guess.I could hear the laughter in his voice.Im afraid that Ive taken advantage of you in so many situations that Ive lost count.How do you feel?Terrible.I hate your horse!If youre sore from the ride, it serves you right, said Lord Dearborne, with something less than loverlike devotion.Jupiter is trained to take no one on his back but myself or my groom, Jason.I cant understand why that stupid glue bait didnt dump you at the first crossroads.Mayhap your charms work on horses as well as men, my violet eyed witch?Well, he wasnt charmed at all, I returned crossly.In fact, I had a more comfortable time of it under the not so tender mercies of a bunch of villainous spies.That brutish animal tossed me off twice, conked me senseless by tossing his neck, and carried me under a low hanging branch that almost knocked my head off.Did you catch him, then?Yes, he came trotting into the Fox and Feathers outside Dyle and demanded his oats as though he owned the place.The stablehands there recognized him and obliged the poor fellow.Lesley is returning to Petersperch tomorrow and will bring him back.There was a low shelf under the seat.Lord Dearborne opened it and drew out a small flask, which he unscrewed and handed to me.Here, you still feel so cold.You are always forcing spirits on me, I complained, but took a swallow of the bitter liquid nonetheless.The devil take your liquor, Milord, I thought, and looked up at him provocatively.Now, arent you going to ask me if Ive been, let me see, how did you phrase it?Ah, hurt in any other way?I laughed.He smiled at me wistfully and with heart stopping tenderness said, I dont know which can move me more, your laughter or your tears.Sometimes at Barfrestly I would be sitting in the library frowning over pages of Department reports and I would hear you outside in the garden playing at some silly game or other with your sisters or Kit.Every once in a while, then, I could hear you laugh, like sunlight on crystal, fresh, sparkling, innocently alive; all the things that you are and I am not.I tried so hard not to fall in love with you.He brought one finger up to delicately trace the outline of my cheek.The casual affection of the gesture brought tears to my eyes.When the marquis spoke again, his voice was curiously tender: God knows that Ive made mistakes before, but that night in London when Lesley brought you home, wrapped up in his cloak, you stood there so still and white I almost went out of my mind.I know it was my own fault that you wouldnt confide in me, Ive acted like a damned coxcomb since the first day we met.And that night I found you in Lesleys bed, I was so jealous that I lost my control.Theres never been a woman before you dammit, you little wretch, will you wait until I finish my sentence before laughing at me?Im trying to say that I knew I should be cherishing this rare moment of humility in my beloved, but it was so out of character that it was too much for me.So I had to interrupt him.Nicky, I whispered, twining my arms around his neck, hush up and take advantage of me.It was some time before I regained the breath to speak.Then I was sitting curled on Milords lap with my warmly flushed cheek leaning against his chest.Nicky?This time I said his name tentatively, savoring it.What is it, love?His lips were in my hair.If there has never been a woman before me, then where did you learn all those excellent things?I asked quizzically.Brat.Laugh at my love talk, will you?What I was trying to tell you was that there has never been a woman who has ever meant anything to me.God, I dont know anything about being in love.Mmmmm.You seem to be doing all right.My word, what an odd place for you to kiss me.I never realized that people kissed other people in that spot before.N ick y?What is the matter, am I frightening you, sweetheart?Its all right, Ill stop.No!Stu pid.I just wanted to know why you didnt tell me that you loved me before, when you asked me to marry you?Lord Dearborne sighed and tilted my chin back so that I was looking directly into his eyes.After tumbling you about like a scullery maid, I could hardly brazen out a declaration of love.Especially with Christopher snarling at me and hovering over you like an eagle protecting its only egg.Kit and I made up, by the way; this morning.We had a long talk and he gave me a lot of sage advice.Elizabeth, are you listening?Yes, yes.But, Nicky, I didnt mind being tumbled around like a scullery maid.It was only that I was so sick.Actually, I wanted to be tumbled His lips stopped mine with a long, searching kiss, then he said huskily, I can see that we are going to have to find a very strict chaperone for you until our wedding.What do you say about staying with my grandmother, the Duchess of Windham?If you want a strict chaperone, then not her, Nicky.Shes much too anxious to see your heir!
