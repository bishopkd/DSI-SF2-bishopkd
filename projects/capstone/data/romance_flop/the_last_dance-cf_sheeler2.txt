Joshua put some unleavened bread in the bowl.He lit the incense and filled the house with a sweet aroma.Then, after putting on a white shawl with blue stripes on the edges around his shoulders, Joshua knelt in front of the shrine.Picking up a lighter with a long stem, he started lighting the seven candles.For every candle he lit, Joshua would recite a line of a prayer in Hebrew."Hear me oh Israel," he began."The Lord our God, the Lord is one.Praised be His glorious name forever and ever. "In the bedroom Ruth awoke.When she heard Joshua praying she smiled."The Minhah," Ruth said to herself.The she silently joined in the prayer with Joshua."In thy protection, oh God, I put my trust," they said together.
