Not always.You know, you might want to rethink that Great Dane.No kidding.Brawley reached up and moved the dog down beside him.Then he tossed the pillow aside.Hair tousled, he rolled to his side to face her.Morning, Maggie.You naked?She laughed out loud.And hes back.Yeah.He ran a hand over his stubble covered chin.Thanks for staying with me.A blush started dead center of his chest and crept up his neck and face.I, ah, would have been okay, but the company helped.No doubt embarrassed, he was throwing a wall between them.Look, Maggie, about last night.He focused on a spot on the far wall, his eyes no longer meeting hers.I dont know what to say.I apologize for everything that went down.And for dragging you away from New York and your work.I shouldnt have done that.Too many beers.You know, she said, I could simply tell you it didnt matter.That it was okay.Or maybe I could say it was time to come home for a visit anyway.That I needed to check in on the shop.See how Ellas doing.But Im not going to.Confusion raced over his face, and his eyes drifted to hers.You hadnt had a beer or anything else to drink when you called me, Brawley.You cant blame it on alcohol.A trace of anger darkened his eyes.Fine.Youre right.What do you want me to say?I dont know.Thats something you have to figure out for yourself.Nothing more I have to say.Brawley threw back the covers.The grief would return, but for now it had been pushed aside by temper.Ordinarily that would have been okay.But right now?She didnt want to fight with him nor did she want him rehashing last night and beating himself up over what had happened.Time the conversation took a detour.Nice ass, she purred.His head turned.Oh, yeah?You could model with that butt.Seen a lot of them, huh?Ive viewed my share, and yours ranks right up there at the top.He gave a half laugh.Maggie, I dont think if we both live to be a hundred, Ill ever figure you out.Thats the plan.She started to get up, then stopped, her mouth dropping.Whats this?Oh, shit!Brawley?She picked up the framed photo of herself at Popss wedding.Dont suppose you could just forget you saw that?No, I dont suppose I can.He scratched his bare chest, then reached for his jeans.She read indecision in his expression and knew he was toying with possible answers.Trying to come up with something shed buy.I want the truth.The truth?Pants on and zipped, button still undone, he faced her squarely.Staring at those rock hard abs, that amazing six pack, she almost forgot the question.Ive been handing you the truth ever since I came back to Maverick Junction.Youre not hearing it.Thats bull.No, its not, he said quietly.I hated the lack of anonymity here in a small town.Everybody knows your business before you do.You cant so much as sneeze without somebody hearing you and taking out an ad in the Maverick Junction Daily to spread the word.So I moved to Dallas after I finished school, in search of my dream and a little elbow room.He leaned down, rested his hands flat on the bed, and stuck his face close to hers.Problem was my dream wasnt there.I had to come back here, home to Maverick Junction, to find it.I understand that, Maggie said.And Ive been living here in this small town wanting out to find my own dream.In the city.Did you find it, Mags?Yes.You sure about that?Now it was her turn to look away.Yes.Not certain I believe you.She gasped.Are you calling me a liar?No, maam.I wouldnt do that.But youre thinking it.Im thinking Im hungry.She glared at him, then decided that, for now, shed let him off the hook.But theyd get back to this discussion.Im hungry, too.But I cooked last night.Im not cooking again this morning.You thawed out a casserole.Her brow rose.Your point?When he said nothing, she nodded.Thats what I thought.Put on a shirt and take me to Sallys.I need to go to the funeral home.I know.Her heart ached for him, and she took his hand.After weve eaten and youve flushed the rest of the alcohol out of your system with several cups of coffee, well go together.You dont need to do that, Red.Youre right.I dont.But Im going tounless you really dont want me along.Id be grateful to have you there.Then grab a shirt, cowboy, and make it quick.She set the picture on the nightstand.That discussion would wait.Kneeling down, she unzipped her suitcase.And youre paying.He laughed.Honey, Ive been paying for years.Twenty Nine  Dread filled Maggie.She hated funerals.Two days had passed since she and Brawley sat in Harlan Buchanans office and picked out Docs coffin.Between them, theyd taken care of the myriad details of funeral planning, from writing the obituary to which song would be sung first.Theyd decided to hold the service at Docs church rather than at Buchanans Funeral Home.She hadnt seen or talked to Brawley since.When she walked into the small chapel with her mom and dad, she spotted Brawley up front with his parents.His head was dipped as if in prayer.Docs death had shaken his world.The two had spent a lot of time together tending the animals they both loved.Doc Gibson had mentored Brawley, had given him a place to develop and grow.And now he was gone.The world had lost a good man.Brawley had lost a wonderful friend and teacher.She couldnt bring herself to look at the casket.She and Doc had planned to have lunch together on her first trip back home.He wanted to hear all about her life in the city.Instead of Sallys, though, shed come to the church to visit.To say good bye.Maggie understood funerals were a necessary part of the grieving process.They were for the living, the ones left behind, not the one who had moved on.Still, she hated them.With a passion.Even with the air conditioner running full tilt, the interior of the chapel had already grown hot and close, the scent of flowers nearly overwhelming.She couldnt remember ever seeing so many baskets and arrangements.Apparently, the good people of Maverick Junction had paid no heed to the notice about sending donations to the National Humane Society instead of flowers.Darn shame they didnt have a humane society here in town.They sure could use one.Both Marvin and Sophies cat Lilybelle had been darned lucky to find a good home.Someone bumped into her.Im sorry.She stepped off to the side.More and more people entered the sanctuary.Doc Gibson might not have had any blood relatives left, but a lot of people loved and respected him.Hed be missed.Well sit back here, her mom said.Thats fine.I need to check on Brawley.Her mother nodded.Hes going to need a friend.Maggie walked down the aisle and slid into the bench behind him.Wordlessly, she laid a hand on his shoulder.His hand came up to rest over hers, but he didnt turn.He sat stoically, facing front.Annie and Cash came in, followed by Ty, Sophie, and the three boys.They sat on either side of Maggie.Each leaned forward and whispered to Brawley.He answered but never turned.Maggies heart ached for him.The small church filled to overflowing.Ranchers and their families from this and several adjoining counties had come to bid Doc Gibson a final farewell.The preacher stepped to the altar, and the service began.Maggie listened to those who came forward to speak.So many, like her grandfather, were getting on in age.Her eyes roved about the church.Who would be next?Which of these friends or family members wouldnt be here next time she flew home for a visit?She cast a glance at Annie and Cash.They held hands.Annie already sported a tiny baby bump, and Maggie wouldnt be here to watch it grow.Jesse, Josh, and Jonah graduated from kindergarten in a couple weeks.Shed miss the ceremony, miss celebrating with them.Her eyes misted, not only for Doc Gibson this time.Shed reached for the brass ring and actually caught the damned thing.Now what did she do with it?Yesterdays funeral had taken on the feel of a bad dream.Shed practically sleepwalked through the day, afraid to fully accept that Doc was truly gone.Shed miss him.Brawley would be lost without him.So antsy she could have crawled out of her skin, Maggie found herself torn between her dreams and new life in New York and her friends and family, her shop, her always and forever life here in Maverick Junction.She might not know what shed do tomorrow, but today?Shed spend it at her shop greeting customers and piddling around in her back room.It was something she needed to do every once in a while.She could fly in once every month or two and spend a few days looking over the stock and ordering new.Going over the books.Modifying and adapting to changes.It would let her keep in touch with both her business and her family and friends.Pops and Dottie were happy, but neither one was a spring chicken.She missed Pops horribly.Docs passing reminded her how quickly a loved one could leave.Without warning or time to say good bye.She probably needed her grandfather far more than he needed her.Especially now he had a new bride.The thought made her smile.She still couldnt get over that.And their family had expanded by two since theyd adopted Doc Gibsons dogs.With Marvin upstairs that made three canines in the house.Whod have thought?Dottie, it seemed, had a knack for taking in straysof both the two  and four legged variety.First on todays must do list?A stop at Ollies for an iced coffee.The month and a half shed been gone had been enough for the summer heat to sink her claws into Texas.It was beautiful now and not supposed to climb higher than eighty today.By tomorrow, they could be at ninety and sweltering.As she pulled in behind her shop, she rolled up her windows.Next month would make a year since Annied ridden her Harley into Maverick Junction.What a difference that year had made.For all of them.When Annie and Cash got married, Sophie had come for the wedding and, basically, stayed.Shed fallen in love with Ty and his three boys.Pops and Dottie had hooked up.No doubt about it.Cupid had been working overtime.Everybody in the county seemed to be seeing red hearts and flowers.Not all the changes were in the romance department.Brawley had come back to town, and now theyd lost Doc Gibson.Shed moved to New York City and had her first runway show.Make that successful runway show!And now, here she was back home.Temporarily.Shed catch a flight back on Sunday.But for now, shed enjoy the rest of her time here.She grinned as she crossed the street to Ollies.The skirt of her pale green sundress fluttered around her legs as a breeze whipped up.She glanced up at the sky and saw clouds building to the west.Looked like they might get some rain a little later.They could use it.She pushed through the caf door, a small whirlwind whipping in behind her.Ollie looked up from the counter he wiped down.Hey!Look whos here.A big city, high fashion designer in our humble diner.Go on, Maggie said.Judy set down the platter of eggs and ham, refilled her customers coffee cup, then hurried over to give Maggie a hug.How long you here for?This week.Shame bout Doc, huh?Yes.Her heart hurt.It is.Good thing Brawley decided to come back when he did or the ranchers around here would be upah, a nasty creek.They would indeed.Before she left Ollies, she ordered a cranberry orange muffin and a glass of sweet iced tea for Ella.If history meant anything, she hadnt taken time to eat breakfast.Plastic cup and Styrofoam container in hand, Maggie stood outside Ollies and studied her shop.It looked good.Shed missed it.Missed coming here every morning, missed her routine.New York was exciting, she reminded herself.Full of energy and wonderful people.Something different every day.It held everything shed ever wanted.It did.It really did, her mind insisted.Her damned heart, though, still dragged its feet, mumbling it wasnt so sure.Maggie!Ella, a necklace in one hand, flew across the room to her the second the door opened.Oh, its so good to see you.Im sorry about Doc.They hugged, and Maggie handed her breakfast.Sit.Eat.And tell me all.Ella laughed and dropped into a chair.She took a bite of the muffin.Mmmm.Good.Where do I begin?Maggie sipped her iced coffee and soaked up the details of what had happened in the shop, with Ellas kids, and the latest gossip winging around Lone Tree.Most of the talk lately has been about you.Ella popped the last bite of muffin in her mouth.Everybodys so proud.Mel ran a great story.Brawley took the pictures?She nodded.I thought he wasnt going.So did I.  He handed us all a tale about a conference he had in New York.But?Oh, the conference existed, and he did register for it.But he never attended a single day, and I dont think he ever intended to.My opinion?He went to support me.Her heart did a little flip flop.She was having the damnedest time trying to hold on to any leftover mad.Hes a good man, Maggie.Yes, he is.I dont know what happened between you and its really none of my business, but sometimes people make mistakes.Eyeing Maggie over her cup, she added, And sometimes they deserve forgiveness.They sat quietly.Casey Jamess Crying on a Suitcase played over the sound system.The words arrowed straight to her already abused heart.When shed left, Brawley had dropped everything to drive to Austin to see her off.Then hed flown to New York to be with her the day of her show.Her fingers moved to her bracelet, ran over the charm hed given her that night.Hed always been there, cheering her on and supporting her.Except the day their baby died.Hed been nowhere around that day.But then he hadnt known.Guilt assailed her.If the shoe was on the other foot, how would she have reacted when shed found out about it?Shed have been mad.No.Mad was too small a word.Shed have been livid.And he wasat first.Then his concern was for her.Sorrow at what shed gone through.Regret he hadnt been there for her.She let out a deep breath and said a quick prayer of thanks when the door opened and one of her Austin customers walked in.Laura!Maggie?What are you doing here?I thought youd be hobnobbing with the elite.She laughed.Unfortunately, Im a working girl regardless of where I lay my head at night.Then she sobered.A friend passed away.I came home for the funeral.The two talked as Ella showed Laura their new stock.When she finally left, loaded down with purchases, Maggie said, Is it okay if I sneak away to the back room?Ive got a couple ideas Id like to get on paper.Youre the boss.Ella waved a hand toward her hidey hole.Your rooms been sad without you.Go.Have fun.Create.Thanks.She slipped off and closed her door.The room welcomed her, and she spent the first few minutes simply savoring the feel of it.Shed missed this.Missed her private spot.As great as her new studio was, she was rarely alone.Perched on her stool, she pulled a drawing pad toward her and sketched quickly, the ideas scrambling to get out.Time ceased to exist.Every once in a while, she became aware of customers coming and going, heard snippets of conversation, but she quickly blocked them out.Ella.What a gem.How lucky shed been to find her.The bell over the door chimed again.From the backroom, Maggie heard Ellas cheerful greeting followed by a deeper, masculine voice.Brawley.Asking for her.Her stomach plunged to her toes.She could hide out in here.Pretend she didnt know hed come.Yeah, like hed simply turn around and leave.Girding her loins, so to speak, she decided shed go to him rather than cowering in her hideaway.She caught a glimpse of herself as she passed the large mirror propped against the wall.If she stopped to run a hand over her hair or fuss with the skirt on her dress, it had nothing to do with the man outside the door.It was simply a professional woman who wanted to look her best for her customers.She snorted.Who the heck did she think she was kidding?Opening the door, she stepped out.Hey, Brawley.Thought I heard you out here.He hung up the lacey blouse hed been toying with.Hey, yourself, gorgeous.Dont you have work to do?Yep, and Im doing it.Ray Barrett called this morning.Hes got a ranch on the outskirts of Lone Tree and had a sick horse.Been there for hours.Now, Im finished, so I stopped by to ask if youd have dinner with me.Tonight?Tonight.Maggie blinked and glanced at Ella.Were almost out of bags, Ella said.Ill get some more from the stockroom.She disappeared, leaving Maggie alone with Brawley.Well?he asked.I cant.Sure you can.He nudged his hat back from his forehead, then tucked his thumbs in his jeans pockets.You afraid of me, Red?Absolutely not.Her chin rose.Im not afraid of anything.Good.Glad we got that out of the way.Have dinner with me.Silence settled over the shop.She stared over Brawleys shoulder toward the street, praying shed spy a customer or two headed her way.The street and sidewalks remained empty.Brawley, I have so much on my mind right now.So do you.This isnt the best time for us to try to start anything again.No, it probably isnt, but I think we already have.To be honest, I dont know if the time will ever be right, Mags, so maybe we need to grab what weve got.Were both here.Right now.But not for long.No, not for long.Would it really be so terrible to grab today, to take advantage of what we have for as long as we have it?And not think about tomorrow?And not think about tomorrow.See, Brawley, thats where you and I differ.I cant operate that way.Tomorrow is always on my mind.Actually, you might be surprised just how often I do think about tomorrowwith you.Oh, God.She couldnt speak.It was as if shed taken a punch to the stomach.What?No smartass comeback, Red?Shed come back for him, hadnt she?To help him through this.All right.All right?All right what?His expression grew wary.Ill have dinner with you.Just like that?Just like that.How about I pick you up?Fine.She toyed with her necklace.Where are we going?Its a surprise.Dress casually.Jeans.Okay.He waved and moved to the door.Hand on the knob, he said, Ill be by at six.Youre still at your folks?She nodded.Without giving her a chance to say another word, he was out the door.Ella stepped from the back room, a handful of bags tucked under her arm.Boy, dont you have good timing, Maggie said.I dont know what you mean.And you can say that with a straight face.Maggie grinned.Youre a pro.Ive got two kids.Its a skill you have to learn.Ella studied Maggie.Brawleys a good man.Maggie bit her lip.Yes, he is.But I cant afford to lose sight of my goals.I dont think you need to worry about that.Be sure, though, to stay flexible.Stay flexible?Would that be the same as keeping my options open?Yes, I suppose it would.Why?Maggie shook her head.My dad handed me that same piece of advice before I left for New York.Hes a wise man.Ella stepped behind the counter to restock the bags.Not sure where youre going to put those, Maggie muttered, since I know you already stashed a new supply there this morning.The door opened.Spotting Maggie, her customers started talking at once, congratulating her and wanting to know if she had any of her new designs to show them.As promised, Brawley showed up at six, right on the dot.From her parents living room window, she watched him walk toward the house.Jeans, white with wear, hugged his lower body.A navy blue T shirt highlighted his muscular torso and made her mouth water.Black boots, cowboy hat, and dark glasses finished a look certain to make any womans heart do a happy dance.Dressed in an old pair of jeans, a short sleeve dark green T shirt, and a pair of kick around boots, she hurried out to meet him.No sense him and her dad getting into it.Opening her arms wide, she asked, This okay?You look beautiful, Red.He tugged at her ponytail.A man could get lost in that body.Heat rushed through her as she remembered him doing exactly that in her New York apartment.She slid on a pair of oversized sunglasses as much in defense against Brawley as protection from the low sun.He opened the door and helped her in.Still not telling me where were going?Not yet.Hey, Marvin.She leaned over the seat to rub the puppys head.How are you, boy?His entire body shook in ecstasy.Dont get him too excited.Hell pee all over the seat.Maggie laughed and turned around to hook her seat belt.A country song played on his radio as they turned onto the highway.She lowered her window and rested an arm on it.Brawley did the same.The fresh air feels so good, she said.It seems Ive been cooped up forever.About two miles outside of town, Brawley turned onto a small back road.Maggie narrowed her eyes.This goes back by the lake.Yes, it does.Rounding a curve, the lake came into view.A small hill led down to it.Brawley cut his wheels and started through the grass.She let out a small squeak and gripped the door.Theres no road here!No kidding, Sherlock.He drove straight to the lakes edge.A carpet of Texas wildflowers spread out around them.Mature live oaks clumped together near the lake and reflected in the water.Without a word, she opened her door and got out.Brawley, its beautiful.He came to stand behind her, and she felt his heat.Then he put an arm around her waist and pulled her against him.Her breathing quickened.Laying his head against hers, he said, I love it here.A bird chirped high in one of the trees and was answered from a nearby oak.Marvin yapped from the car.Guess Id better let the mutt out.He sure cant handle it by himself.Another reason a man should have a real dog.Marvins real.Yeah, a real pain in the butt.Thou dost protest too much, methinks.Brawley grunted.You and your Shakespeare.But he moved to the car to lift down the dog.Marvin scooted off through the flowers and, sticking his nose in one, started sneezing.Whyd you bring me here?Beautiful lady.Beautiful scenery.I thought we could eat by the water.He walked to the back of the SUV and grabbed a blanket and a picnic basket.I hope you brought lots of food because Im ravenous.He chuckled.Thats one of the things I like about you, Mags.Some women wont eat around a man.Not you.You like your food, and youre not shy about it.It makes eating with you fun.Well, lets get the fun started.Whats in that basket, Little Red Riding Hood?Or are you the Big, Bad Wolf?Ill let you decide.He opened the lid and pulled out a bone.Tossing it to Marvin, he said, That might keep him busy for a few minutes.Its bigger than him.Everythings bigger than him, Brawley muttered.Next, he took out two plates, already made up.If youre expecting caviar and champagne, Im afraid youre gonna be disappointed.We have buffalo chicken wraps and tomato basil pasta along with a bottle of sparkling water.That sounds perfect.Im too hungry for caviar.I figured youd say that.He held up a bag of Dotties cookies.And these for dessert.He handed her a napkin.Cloth?Yep.Only the best for you.His hand dipped into the basket again, and he handed her a single yellow rose.It made me think of you.She took it, their fingers touching.Oh, Brawley.What am I supposed to do with you?His lips curved in a slow, sexy smile.Ive got a couple ideas.Ill bet you do.She laid the rose on the blanket beside her and uncovered her plate.The water lapped on shore, the birds sang, and Marvin gnawed on his bone.Maggie hadnt been this much at peace in months.Both of them tucked into their food.Ive been thinking, Brawley said.That could be dangerous.Hah hah.Seriously, Maverick Junction doesnt have any kind of animal shelter.I know.Marvin crawled onto her lap, and she ran her hands over him, driving him into a frenzy of pleasure.This little guy really lucked out.Brawley shook his head.Hes not staying.Im a temporary landing pad until we find him a home.You are such a liar.Wild horses couldnt drag this guy from you, and you know it.He grinned.Marvin does tend to get under your skin.Guess hes okay.For a runt.Its in the breeding, Doctor Odell.Speaking of He rolled toward her, placed his hand behind her neck, and pulled her in to him.The first touch of his lips was electric.She moaned and slid her body closer still.Marvin, squashed between them, wiggled out and climbed over Brawley to find a safer spot for his post dinner nap.Brawley whispered, Maggie, I want you.Nothing has changed.All the problems we had before are still problems.Is it the camera guy?Jarvis?She frowned.No!Its you.Its me.Its the fact we live fifteen hundred miles apart.And the fact I acted like an ass when I was nineteen years old.That, too.He dropped onto his back on the blanket.I dont know how else to tell you Im sorry.To show you I mean it.Id give anything to be able to go back and handle things differently.If Id known, had any idea I know that, Brawley.I believe you.He raised his head to stare at her.Does that mean youve forgiven me?She let out a long sigh.I think so.You think so?You dont know?Its complicated.Tell me about it.His head thunked back to the ground.Then he reached for her hand and squeezed it.Im sorry about our baby, Mags.So sorry I wasnt there for you.Thats a regret Ill take to my grave.When she said nothing, he cut his eyes to where she lay beside him.Oh, Maggie, dont cry.Please dont cry.He thumbed away the tears that trickled down her cheeks.Did I tell you our baby was a little boy?Oh, God.He shook his head.No.One single word, but in it Maggie heard a world of pain.Of suffering.I would have loved our baby.His voice cracked.A little boy.A little girl.It would have made no difference.Her throat so tight she doubted she could speak, she simply ran her thumb along the back of his hand.Twilight deepened around them as they lay side by side, holding hands.Marvin snored, and the cicadas began their nightly serenade.The moon began its slow climb into the evening sky.You said earlier you were thinking about something.I assume you wanted to run an idea by me.Maggie spoke softly.Yeah, I did.He licked his lips.Its about an animal shelter.Weve got all of Annies leftovers from the apartment in storage.Ty said he and Sophie have a bunch of junk theyd like to get rid of.So do Cash and Annie, Rosie and Hank, Dottie and Fletch.My mom and dad said theyd do some cleaning out, too.And?One mans trash Is another mans treasure, she finished.Yep.So Im thinking we should hold a town yard sale.With the money we raise, we can start The Doc Gibson Animal Shelter.I found the perfect building for it, and I think we can get volunteers to run it.Maggie came up on one elbow.Im sure Sally and Ollie would both run a booth to sell drinks and food.He nodded.Ive already talked to Mel.Hell do the publicity for free.I can put signs up in Lone Tree, Maggie said.I get customers from all over.Im sure some of them would donate even if they cant participate.I think we can do it.His eyes met hers.What do you say?Yes, we can.Does that bleed over into us, Mags?Can we possibly do it, too?Somehow mend this gigantic rift?We can work on it.She leaned over and kissed him.He pulled her down on top of him, and she sighed at the feel of that hot, hard body beneath her.When are you leaving again?Im supposed to fly out Sunday morning.Supposed to?She nodded.I cant believe Im saying this, but to be honest, Im having second thoughts.About what?Living full time in New York.She sighed.Gods honest truth, it feels so good to get back in my jeans.His hand slid lower, worked its way beneath her waistband.There was a time you wanted to get into my jeans, too.Dont flatter yourself, Brawley.I was a nave young girl and didnt know better.What about our night in New York?She kissed him lightly.That would have been an adult woman who probably ought to have known better but decided to go for it anyway.I applaud your decision.Ill bet you do.The thing is I love the city and all it has to offer.I really do.But this is home.Yes, it is.His lips found hers.Kiss me, Maggie.And then she was lost in him.In his kisses, in his embrace.Celebrated that he undressed her slowly, relishing her the way he would an unexpected gift.She undid his buttons, slid his shirt from him.A warm breeze wafted over them, caressing their bare skin.He trailed kisses over her face, down her neck, over her body.Then she simply gave in to the pleasure that was Brawley, said a prayer of thanks when he cried out her name.After, lying in Brawleys arms, her head on his chest, Maggie heard his heart thumping as wildly as her own.She shivered, and he pulled the edges of the blanket around them, held her tighter.She smiled.Had she ever had such romance as hed shown her today?When theyd made love, hed savored her.Every inch of her.Hed made her feel as though she was the only woman in the world.The only woman hed ever been with.The only man shed ever been with.With his kisses, his caresses, his demands, hed erased their past.Electrified the present.Promised a future.Exactly when she couldnt say, but shed made her decision.She wouldnt be going back to New York.Not full time.The city would be there next month, next year.She could design here and travel back and forth when it was necessary.Tomorrow, shed call Zandra.That brass ring?Maybe it was right here in Maverick Junction.Thirty  Dreams didnt always equal reality.Maggie had read enough biographies to understand life inside a house didnt always match what someone looking through a window saw.Rock stars, princessestheir lives werent always what they seemed.She only had to look as far as her friend.Annelise Montjoy Hardeman appeared to have had the perfect life before she met Cash.Not so.Time to take the first step.Grabbing her phone and her courage, she dialed her grandfather before she could change her mind.Pops, I have a question, and you have to promise to be honest with me.Okay, he answered slowly.Its all right, she assured him.This wont hurt.Good.What are your short term plans for your house?The house?Yes, Pops.The house.Why?She took a deep breath and plunged in.Id like to stay there.For a while.Not permanently.I know you want to sell it, but Honey, of course you can stay there.What about New York, though?Pops sounded confused.Wasnt this just a quick trip home for Docs funeral?Yes, it was.I like New York, but I can do my designing from here and go to the city when I need to for business.Nothing says I have to live there.I see.She laughed.No, you dont.Im not sure I do entirely.Ill fill you in on everything later.Before I did anything drastic, though, I wanted to make sure I had a place to stay.Your parents would love to have you with them.I need to be on my own, Pops.Figured youd say that.The house is yours as long as you want.Love you, honey.Love you, too.She hung up and dialed Zandra.With any luck, her assistant could put her in touch with a Realtor to sublet her apartment.When Zandra answered, Maggie spent some time catching up with everything that had happened since shed left, the orders that continued to pour in, and her plans for the next line.Jarvis called.Maggie grimaced.He did?Uh huh.I told him about your friend.That youd gone home for the funeral.Thank you, Zandra.He might call, so I thought Id give you a heads up.If Im reading things right, youve got your eye elsewhere.Maggie made a small sound of agreement.And that brings me to the real reason for this phone call.She steadied herself.She shouldnt be so nervous about this.She was, after all, her own boss.She made her own decisions.Right.And this decision could bring about the collapse of everything shed worked for.How would Owen feel about her staying in Texas?Did it matter?Yes.Hed provided her a huge break.Instead of starting at the bottom of the ladder, Owen had made the climb much less steep.If she did this, would he think her unappreciative and withdraw his support?The show had been uber successful, but that guaranteed nothing.So which could she live without?Career or family?Oh, boy.She hoped it wouldnt come down to that, that she wouldnt have to make a choice.She could do it all.She knew she could.What do you know about subletting apartments?After a few seconds of silence, Zandra answered.Quite a lot, actually.Im subletting right nowand hunting for a new place.My lease is up at the end of the month.Seriously?Yes, and places are hard to find.Why?Now or never.Maggie leaped off the cliff.Because I dont want to live in New York year round.Silence met her words.Zandra?I thought you liked it here.I do.But youre happier in Texas.Yes, I am.That doesnt mean Im giving up designing, she said quickly.I can design here and fly to New York for the work ups and shows.Are you sure about this?Oh, boy.She huffed out a breath.I think so.You think, or you know?I know.Its a big step, Maggie.Have you talked to Owen?No.Not yet.Hes my next call.When she didnt get any response, she asked, Zandra?Are you still there?Just thinking, weighing things.I doubt Owen will have a problem with this.He wants your creativity, your fantastic designs, regardless of where you put them together.I sure hope youre right.She nibbled her lip.Whats your best suggestion for handling the apartment?Ill take over the lease.When you come into the city, you can stay with me.In the extra bedroom.Really?I love that apartment.Its a win win.Tell me about it.She hesitated.Are you sure about this?Probably more than you are.Ill let you play with the whole idea a bit more before we make a final decision.The memory of Brawley at the lake the night before ambushed her.Brawley holding her in New York while she cried for their baby.Brawley mourning his friend.Hed been more than clear that he wanted her.The question was for how long.Did he want her for a night or two, a month, or forever?Did she want him forever?Absolutely.She always had and always would.Hed crushed her before, ground her heart beneath his boot heel.But it hadnt been intentional.Careless?Totally.Immature?Without a doubt.And a long time ago.He was right about that.He was no longer the boy who had done that.He was a man, a man who kept his word.Who took his responsibilities to heart.She could only hope hed taken her to heart, also.Time would tell.She wanted to give it a shot.To do that, she needed to be where he was.The chance of a future with Brawley was worth what she might be giving up.I dont need to think about it anymore, Zandra.Im sure.Then Ill contact the landlord and get the paperwork started.Ill fly back for a week or so to wrap things up from the showing.Yes, you will.Should I expect you Sunday?Torn between her work in New York and her desire to help out with the fund raiser, she made a decision.No, Im taking an extra week.When she hung up, she called Owen.Zandra had been absolutely right.Owen didnt care if she designed in Timbuktu as long as she came to New York when necessary.Ending the call, Maggie flopped onto her bed, grinning like a Cheshire cat.She felt good.Better than she had in a long time.The fund raiser came together quickly, and the entire town of Maverick Junction and most of Lone Tree turned out for it.Adults and kids alike manned the tables.By late afternoon, though, the heat hit hard, and Brawley decided to roll up the carpet.He and Cash dragged the few things that hadnt sold to two tables and posted a big FREE sign.Inside half an hour, nothing remained.Brawley grinned as he watched Henrietta Greene tote away the ugliest table lamp hed ever seen.The turquoise base was topped with a red and purple shade.He shivered.Can you believe she actually wants that?Maybe shes planning on some target practice tomorrow, Ty said.Frankly, I dont care what she does with it.Saves me having to pitch it in the Dumpster.They took down the empty tables and stowed them in the back of Cashs pickup.We did well here today.He high fived his friends.We did, Cash said.Youve got enough to open the shelter.Sure is nice of Arnold to donate the building behind his gas station.Yep.Ty stretched his arms overhead and yawned.What now?Now, we relax.Brawley tipped his head in the direction of the piled wood.Time to light our bonfire.Might be hot, but you cant do this right without one.I think we should stretch this thing right on into the night.Maybe somebody He trailed off, his eyes straying to the three women who walked toward them.Now isnt that the prettiest sight youve ever seen?Yeah.It is.Ty reached out his hand and caught Sophies, pulling her to him.They kissed.Where are the kids?Talking Sally out of an ice cream cone.Babs is with them.Id ask where our kid is, Cash said with a grin, but youve got that covered.He kissed Annie and rested a hand over her baby bump.Brawley crooked a finger at Maggie.Why dont you come on over here and give me a smooch?I think I deserve it after today.Why, Brawley Odell, I do believe we agree on something.Before he could respond, she planted a doozy of a kiss on him.He growled and wrapped an arm around her waist.When she drew back, her lips were red and swollen, her chest rising and falling as she fought for breath.Cash laughed.Get a room.Annie punched her husbands arm.What are you?Twelve?The triplets came running up to them, Cashs sister and her two in tow.I dont know about anybody else, but Im famished.Ty rubbed his stomach.Help is on the way.Lets get the fire started first.Grumbling about having to wait, Ty followed Cash and Brawley.Brawley stopped to look over his shoulder.Youre not going anywhere, are you, Red?Nope.He winked at her and caught up with the others.By the time they had the wood stacked, a crowd had gathered.A cheer went up as flames shot into the air.Lawn chairs and blankets magically appeared as people settled in.Mr.Sadler showed up with all the fixings for hot dogs, bags of chips, and marshmallows to roast.Bubbas delivered a keg of beer and enough soda for an army.Dottie set up a battered card table and charged a dollar for the impromptu barbecue.Come on, she nagged her neighbor.Its for a good cause.Brawley noticed that very few one dollar bills crossed her palm.Most of the townspeople handed her fives and tens for their Saturday night dinner.He stepped to the food table, prepared to plate hot dogs for the throng, but his mom pushed him out of the way.Dad and I have this covered.She tipped her head toward Sadlers parking lot, which had become a makeshift dance floor.Someone had set up a stereo system.Brawley caught sight of Maggie dancing to an old Merle Haggard song with little Josh.His mother followed his gaze.Shes good with kids.She should have some of her own.He closed his eyes to hide the pain.His mom would see it and recognize it.Hed never been able to hide anything from her.Maggie should, indeed, have children of her own.His child.Would their little boy have had Maggies red hair, her green eyes?Or maybe his dark hair with those incredible blue eyes.Without thinking, his hand moved to his chest to rub the spot over his heart.Go to her, his mom said.Time the two of you healed the hurt.His gaze whipped back to her.Did she know?Go, she repeated, giving him a little shove.Okay.He laughed.Sure you can handle this?We handled you, didnt we?his dad said.After that, everything else is a cakewalk.I wasnt that bad.No, you werent.Youre a good son.Now listen to your mother and get out of here.The girls waiting for you.Sure enough, when he looked at Maggie again, she was watching him.Without another word, he moved to her, cut in on Josh, and drew in the scent of her, the feel of her.Thank God for slow songs.Dancing with Maggie was the next best thing to making love.He didnt get to keep her to himself long, though.Seemed everybody was glad to have her home and wanted to congratulate her on her success.Hands jammed into his jeans pockets, he stood off to the side drinking it in, so damn proud of her he thought his heart would burst.Finally, she broke free and stumbled toward him.Im exhausted, and my feet are screaming at me to take a load off.Ive got just the thing.Brawley went to his Tahoe and came back with the old red and black checked blanket theyd used for their picnic at the lake.He spread it over the grass.He bowed low, removed his cowboy hat, and placed it over his heart.Taking her hand, he helped her down.Cowboy chivalry at its finest.The moon rose in the sky, and, gradually, people headed to their trucks and cars.Things wound down quickly.Ty and Sophie said good night and bundled their boys off.Cash and Annie stopped by to tell them they were leaving.Mr.Sadler pulled the plug on the music and locked up.Finally, they were alone under the stars.The bonfire crackled and sparks flew into the night sky.The temperature had dropped, and a slight breeze lifted strands of Maggies hair as they sat hip to hip on the blanket.When I heard you were leaving for New York, my stomach took a nosedive, Brawley said.Selfishly, I wanted you here when I came back.Thats not selfish.Yes, it is.I left for college and stayed away.She nodded.I never expected that.You hurt me, Brawley.I did, and it was the biggest misstep of my life.He took a deep breath.You told me earlier Id have to decide for myself what I needed to say.You were right.Im not sure, though, if I can put my feelings into words.Try.He rubbed a thumb over the back of her hand.Growing up, I felt like my whole life had been planned for me.By others.And I was doing the same thing.Assuming wed get married, have kids I let you believe that, Maggie, because I wanted it, too.But then I got a taste of the rest of the world, of the possibilities, and I couldnt give it up.Not for anything or anybody.I needed to find myself.I can understand that.Yeah, I think you can.You needed to find yourself, too.Its why you went to New York.Were kindred spirits, Red.Too bad thats whats been keeping us apart.He took her hand.We wouldnt have lasted, Maggie, if wed married way back then.Both of us would have given up our dream.A year, two at the most, and wed have ruined what we had.So you did it sooner.No!Yes.I guess.He raked fingers through his hair.I figured without me in the picture, youd go off to that fancy design school youd been yammering about.Yammering?Dont nitpick.Pops offered to send you.To pay the freight.I stayed here.At first because I thought you might come back.Then Grandma got sick, and Pops needed help.After she passed, well, I like it here.I worked hard and opened my shop.I was happy.It was what I wanted.I see that now.You belonged here, not in some big city.And before you go getting your back up, thats not a bad thing.Im not slamming you.Im complimenting you.You knew, even then, where you belonged, where your heart was.It took me years to come back to mine.Tears threatened, and she blinked them away.What do you want now, Maggie?From life.She wanted to say, You, just you.But she bit the words back, figuring that wasnt what hed want to hear.Instead, she said, Lets talk about you.What do you want?Me?Do you still feel penned in by the small town atmosphere?The lack of fancy restaurants and shops?The lack of privacy?No, I dont.That piece of land I showed you out by the lake?A slice of heaven.I bought it.She drew back.You did?Oh, Brawley, thats fantastic!I hoped youd feel that way because I intend to build a house on it.You asked me what I want.Thats it.I want to wake up every day for the rest of my life right there.That would be wonderful.Yes, it would.He took her hand.The thing is, Maggie, I need someone to share it.I need you.I want you there beside me every morning.You do?I do.A nervous half laugh escaped her.That sounds like a proposal.Yes, it does, doesnt it?He kissed her fingertips.Maggie could barely catch her breath.He had to feel her heart racing; he could probably hear it.Right there in the middle of town, beside the flickering bonfire, Brawley dropped to one knee.Maggie Sullivan, I love you.Youre my first love and my last love.How about you design another wedding gown?For yourself this time.For our wedding.Will you put me out of my misery and marry me?Oh.She raised a hand to her mouth.Are you serious?For Petes sake, Red, Im down on my knee.Im asking you to marry me.I understand you need to go back to New York.Well work it out.I dont expect you to give that up.She shook her head.You were right, Brawley, when you said Im not a big city girl.Ive already decided to stay right here.Ill fly back East on an as needed basis.Im Texas through and through.When did you decide that?Last week.A lopsided grin curved his lips.I have this, too.From his back pocket, he withdrew a jewelers box and flipped it open.Light from the bonfire caught on the magnificent emerald, flanked on either side by a diamond.Brawley.I dont know what to say.Say yes.Yes!Yes, yes, yes.She flung her arms around his neck and kissed him.He drew her close.When they finally parted, he whispered, If you dont like the emerald, we can exchange it for a diamond.I saw this, though, and He shrugged.The fiery green made me think of you.I love it.She held out her hand.As he slid the ring on her finger, she said, I love you, Brawley Odell.Thats the best news Ive ever heard, Red, cause Ive tried and tried, but I just cant stop lovin you.Grandma Trudys Chocolate Pie Recipe   This pie combines the flavors of chocolate, marshmallow, and malt, and doesnt require
