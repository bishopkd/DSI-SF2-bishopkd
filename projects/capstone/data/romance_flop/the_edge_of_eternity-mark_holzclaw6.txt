"I'm fine really, just exhausted. "Her soft footsteps retreated down the corridor.I hoped Nathaniel would not return with more apologies.Our relationship was broken now and there were no words that could mend it.I could never look at him the same way again.I would always remember that horrible moment by the lighthouse, our lighthouse where we played together as children.Now it would stand forever as a monument and reminder of his indiscretion, his folly, his slip of the tongue.Getting up, I peered at my reflection in the mirror.It betrayed a woman with red swollen eyes.Opening the desk, I looked about for a box of tissues.As my hand groped around, I spotted a green leather bound journal inside the drawer.Taking it out, I ran my hand whimsically across the smooth cover.It was a diary.Maybe Adriana had kept an account of her thought life.If her death was not an accident, there might be a clue inside these pages.Placing it under my arm, I carried it with me to the Reading Room and sat down.Left alone with only my thoughts, I opened the journal and began to read.June 4th  Because of yet another drinking spree, Sebastian had passed out on the deck.Since I had no idea how to navigate this boat, I was forced to wait until he regained consciousness before we could return to shore again.How many times have I watched him drown into an alcohol induced oblivion?However, sleep was always better than his blind rages.They often led to violent rampages which I had been the victim of on a number of occasions, more than I care to remember.I flinched at the thought of my sister being abused by my cousin.How long had this been going on for?Finally Sebastian awakened and piloted us home again.But it did not feel like home anymore, at least not the home I once knew with my first love.Her first love    The only man I remember Adriana falling in love with was Sebastian.Who could this other man be?I read a little further until I came to a more recent entry:  December, 23rd  My first love returned to me again.After I had rejected him for Sebastian, he still cared for me, providing sanctuary from the evil tyrant who was now my husband.Even with all the wounds and bruises that marred and scarred by body, he loved me yet.Like so many woman before me, I had made the wrong choice to marry for wealth.If I could only go back in time and do it all over again.But I had reaped what I had sown, and who could predict how this all would end?My heart raced within me at my sister's words.I had no clue any of this was going on.But in hindsight, off hand comments she made began to make sense.Adrianna had been encouraging me to appreciate my days as a single woman.And here I was twenty seven years old and still not betrothed to anyone.Nathaniel's face appeared in my mind and I inwardly cringed.I would not make the same mistake my sister had by marrying my cousin.I cared for Nathaniel as family, but there were no romantic aspirations.In fact, I wasn't sure if I had ever been in love.I looked at the journal and decided to wait until tomorrow to continue reading it.So much had transpired today, and I longed for a solitary place to collect my thoughts.I had completely forgotten about my novel from the library.Placing the journal back in the desk, I took out The Lost Nightingale by Jessica Collins.After sitting back down in the Reading Room, I stared blankly at the fireplace.My mind was exhausted and I realized now that I was too tired to read, so I closed my eyes and fell into a dreamless sleep.It was after five when I was roused by the sound of voices.They were emanating from the hallway.I peeked around the corner and listened quietly.The ghostly whispers descended the stairs and into the corridor.They belonged to Nathaniel and Cassandra.Quickly I retreated down the hall and glanced out the window.The sun would be setting very soon and Jordan would be waiting for me on the beach.I took a sweater from the front hall closet and stole outside into the twilight.I made my way down the stairs to the beach below.The western sun had dipped into the sea with a final burst of amber to saturate the clouds.It was a spectacle to behold.The elegance of the sunset was only duplicated by its rippled reflection upon the waves.A cool wind tugged at the hem of my dress.I drew my sweater snugly around me, as my eyes darted about for Jordan.But he was nowhere to be found.Minutes dragged by slowly while my legs grew weary.I reclined myself on the dunes and waited in the evening hush.The dark shadow of the lighthouse loomed in the sky, silhouetted against the stars.There was no moon out tonight, though some fog managed to sail in with the tide.Still there was no sign of Jordan.Had he forgotten or had the spell been broken?I stood up and walked back towards the steps leading to the house."Laura wait!"a voice called out.And all at once, he was there beside me with his hand outstretched."Here, I have something for you. "he held out a seashell in his hand."I know you like to collect these. "Surprise was written across my face, since I had never mentioned that to him."Thank you," I said taking it from his hand."I was beginning to think you weren't coming. "His smile lit the darkness."I always keep my promises. "I began to feel unsteady and reached out for him.Jordan caught my hand and gathered me into the cradle of his embrace.I held onto him, still feeling a bit weak and dizzy."Tell me, whats wrong?"he implored.I lowered my gaze into his haunting eyes.Not being able to resist the pull of his gravity, I began to recount the events of the day; from my cousin's kiss to my sister's revelation in her journal.Jordan wrapped his arms tightly around me.Then without a word he kissed me sweetly upon the cheek.His blue eyes were filled with compassion."I want to be there for you Laura. "he said earnestly."Tell me how I can do that. "I regarded the depths of his sincerity, but wasn't sure how to respond."You just being here is enough. "I answered.Though I had this moment in time, which seemed forever, I knew with the dawn he would be gone again.Leaning his head forward, he gently placed his lips against my neck.Something awakened in me that I had never experienced before; a yearning that only he was able to quench."Laura," he breathed softly, I want to take you somewhere."Do you mean tonight?I asked  "Yes, he replied.Its not far from here.Taking my hand in his, he led me along the shoreline.A canopy of stars graced our way to the other side of the bay.Our path ended at the foot of the lighthouse.I gazed up intently at the impenetrable beacon bathed in darkness."But it's locked. "I said.Jordan reached out his hand, and touched the door.It responded by creaking open."How did you do that?"Smiling, he ushered me inside, and we ascended the long procession of stairs that travelled into the sky.Glancing down I experienced a sensation of vertigo.Sensing this, Jordan pulled me closer until we finally arrived at the apex of the lighthouse.It was constructed of glass with a short walkway that circled the rim.He held me protectively against him on the balcony, weaving his fingers through mine.The ocean current moved restlessly below, while a sea of stars danced in the vaults of heaven.So surreal like a dream, this moment could go on forever.Who was he and where did he come from?"Tell me, Jordan.Where do you live?"His eyes met mine."I have nowhere left to go, except you.You are my home. "And with that he sealed my mouth affectionately with his lips.Somewhere inside me a tidal wave of emotions were released.The flood gates had been lifted, and these extraordinary emotions swam through my body.I was in heaven, both metaphorically and literally.The thrill of love spilled over into my mind, and my body cascaded into his arms as they swept me off my feet.And then suddenly everything faded to black.The next moment, I was lying in my bed all alone.The sound of crickets came through my open window filling the empty room.Was my incredible evening just a dream?As I turned on my side, I felt something sharp.I reached into my pocket and there it was again.Not a dream, but real.I held the truth of the night in my hand    the seashell Jordan had given to me.Or was this the one I had placed in my pocket earlier in the day?I couldn't remember now.I began to cry and felt my world spinning out of control.Was he only a creature of my invention?What proof did I have that he really existed?Instead of going back to sleep, I spent the remainder of the morning reading my library book.It made me think about Jordan and why I was so fascinated with him.In the novel, the main protagonist Emily, like me, had come to a lonely house to be a governess of a young ward, in this case a boy.Emily had been thwarted by relatives with unsavory motives.
