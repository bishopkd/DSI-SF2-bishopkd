In one, a young woman leaned back against the counter, laughing.Caroline wondered if maybe she was Hanks daughter.Sorry to keep you waiting, Caroline, Hank said, coming from the back.He held his hand out to her, and she took it, catching the scent of whiskey as they shook.Ole Hank likes to hit the sauce early.Hey, Hank.I would love to help you out, but I got to be honest, I just dont think I can, she said.What?Did Henderson offer you money not to take me on as a client?Hank asked.No, sir, this is my decision, based on my own observations, she said, waiting for the explosion.What in the Sam Hill do you mean, your observations?Preparing herself to deal with the stages of denial, she said bluntly, Hank, Im not going put in the time and effort it would take to improve this place if youre just going to let your employees waste your booze.Waste my ...What do you mean?You need upgrades, Hank.Upgrades that will control your bartenders habits to overpour, she said, picking up one of his bottles.But even that wont help you if you dont stop drinking in your own bar.I dont Please do not insult me by lying.I can smell it on you now.Hank blustered for a moment before explaining.I like to have a wee nip in the morning.It wakes me up.Yeah, and I bet you have nips here and there throughout the day until youre three sheets to the wind by close, she said, shaking her head.Look, I just came by to tell you that I appreciated the offer.You have a great bar with lots of potential, but its just not for me.But if I dont start turning a profit, Im going to lose everything.Caroline paused at the door and gave him one last piece of free advice.I suggest you hire a manager.Someone tough and business savvy who will control the employeesand you.Good luck, Hank.Twenty Three Its true that absence can make the heart grow fonder ...but why tempt fate?Miss Know It All   WEDNESDAY WAS A bad day for Caroline, and by the time she walked through the apartment door, she was ready to crack a few skulls.It had started out awesome.Gabe had brought her French toast covered with powdered sugar in bed, and although Gabe used most of the sugar as an excuse to lick her all over, it had been delicious.But then, after Gabe left, shed jumped into the shower only to find hed used all the hot water.By the time she was done, her teeth were chattering too hard for her to curse.From there, the downhill slope of badness had been almost comical.A dead battery and the hour long wait for AAA had made her late for a business consultation in Twin Falls.The bar owner had been understanding until theyd started talking about her commission.Then hed thanked her for the advice and shown her the door.Shed made it back to the apartment only to find Googlie lying listlessly on the kitchen floor.Frantically, Caroline had run down to the veterinary hospital.As Zoe had examined him, she kept making these clucking and hmmm ing noises that had grated on Caroline until she couldnt keep quiet any longer.What does that mean?Is he going to be okay?Caroline had asked, rubbing his little ears nervously.Well, if its okay with you, Id like to keep him for a few days.Ill run some tests and give him some fluids, since he seems a little dehydrated, Zoe said.Almost as an afterthought, she reached out to hold Carolines hand.Well take good care of him.Caroline couldnt help but notice that Zoe hadnt told her he would be fine.Guess she didnt want to give her false hope.And so, by the time she got home, she was emotionally drained and just wanted to crawl into a dark cave and never come out.She was crying into a box of Lucky Charms when someone knocked on the door.Getting up from the couch, she pulled the door open, and her jaw dropped.Her father scowled at her.Are you going to invite me in or not?I am still recovering from a heart attack, you know, and these stairs were hell.Jumping forward, she took his arm and helped him inside.He was breathing hard, and once she had him settled, she asked, Do you want something to drink?Just water, please, he said, leaning his cane against his leg.Caroline stood up to get him a glass, and when she came back, some of his color had returned.Thank you, he said, taking the glass from her.After several quiet minutes, she finally prodded him.Im surprised to see you, Dad.I wanted to speak with you about what you told me, but I needed time to process everything, he said, setting his water glass aside.Again, he was silent, and she shifted in her chair.And gather information?she suggested.At his surprised look, she said, Ellie told Val, and Val told me you were investigating Kyle.Im going to have to talk to Ellie, he said, clearing his throat before continuing, I needed to have more information on Kyles ...extracurricular activities before I could decide where to go from here.I just needed you to know that I would never allow anyone to hurt my daughters this way, no matter who his father was.Caroline raised her eyebrow.But its okay for you to write your daughters off and pretend that they dont exist?His lips thinned with displeasure.I havent always been a pinnacle of patience.Ha, thats an understatement, Caroline said, recovering from her initial shock.When shed run out of his house after she told him about Kyle, and he hadnt contacted her, she figured hed taken Kyles side after all, that hed found something in Kyles background that made him believe Kyle was innocent.Her father gave her a long suffering look.After your mother died, I didnt know what to do with any of you, but at least you seemed to realize the importance of a good education.If Id known what that He cut himself off, and Caroline wondered if hed been about to call Kyle a nasty name.Edward Willis almost cursing and admitting he was wrong in one day?If Id known what Kyle had done, I would have pressed charges, he said, adding, No matter who his father is, he had no right to hurt and humiliate you.Caroline couldnt seem to stop blinking in surprise.She was on the verge of asking if he was on painkillers.It was one thing for Edward Willis to be a blustering hard ass but for him to be almost ...well, comforting?Talk about a personality adjustment; the man had had a damn transplant!Dad, I dont want to be rude, but ...are you high?Her fathers face snapped into a scowl.Excuse me?Okay, you have never, ever in your life admitted that you might have been rash or made a mistake, Caroline said, laughing a little.This was a scenario she never thought would come about, but the fact that her father was actually acting like a father as well ...weird.And Im sorry, but the complete one eighty of the personality is kind of freaking me out.I pushed you girls, I know, but I wanted you to be the best.To do the best thing for For the Willis name, Caroline finished for him.We know.Weve had the Willis name and everything it means beaten into our heads since we were born, but honestly, do you think it helped any of us?I mean, I left home before I graduated; Val married the man you wanted her to, yet she was miserable; and Ellie is so screwed up, I dont know what to do about her.So explain to me how having a distinguished name and money has turned any of us into a sane, functioning adults?You seemed to have turned out just fine, he said.White hot anger shot through Caroline.Oh no.You can take credit for my stubbornness and my will to succeed, but what I did after I left your house ...thats on me and a few friends I made along the way.Everything I have, I worked my ass off for, and yeah, at times I did some things I wasnt proud of, but the Willis name had nothing to do with my success.Fair enough, her father said, far too reasonably, further confusing Caroline.Is this some kind of near death experience thing?Really, Caroline, I am trying to control my temper, but your obnoxious attempts to bait me are grating, her father snapped.The crack in his bizarre Stepford ness made her smile.Thats better.Huffing, he said, All I wanted to make clear was that if you would like to press charges against him now, I will do whatever I can to help.It was still hard for her to believe her father was here for her, but she needed to give him the benefit of the doubt if she wanted a real truce between them.Besides, she couldnt deny his support warmed her and gave her hope that maybe old, stubborn dogs could learn new tricks.Thank you, Daddy, Caroline said, adding, I take it the investigation is going well?Yes, her father said, his tone clipped.A small part of Caroline pitied her dad.He had put his faith in a man who had violated that trust.It had to sting.Then again ...We dont need to talk about the investigation right now, he said, taking another drink of his water.I want to talk about this man youre living with.Oh, no, we are not going there.Struggling for another subject, Caroline decided to push his buttons a little.Since he was in a good mood and all, she might as well try to get him to bridge the gap between him and her sisters.Or we could talk about this newfound humbleness and how its going to lead you to Vals doorstep to apologize for being a judgmental ass.I will not.If your sister wants to throw her life away on a lowlife farmer who will never That lowlife farmer is a veteran who loves your daughter.You should be proud that she chose a good man, even if his pedigree isnt what you were hoping for.Her father spluttered angrily.Caroline No, you need to accept the fact that your daughters are grown and are starting their lives.We are not asking for your permission; the only thing we want is your blessing.Your acceptance of who we are.You dont have to like our spouses, our professions, or what we chose to do with our future; those are our choices, not yours, Caroline said, emotion clogging her throat.Youre right.You werent much of a dad to us growing up, but you can take this opportunity to change that now.Reaching out, she took his softly wrinkled hand and said, All Ive ever wanted was for you to love me.Oh, youre my daughter.Of course I No!Caroline shouted, dropping his hand and standing over him.Dont you dare say you love me like its so obvious, how could I stupidly miss it?When you love someone, you show that person every day.There isnt a day that goes by that I dont remember Mom hugging or kissing me, but with you ...I dont have any of those good memories.I remember the times you told me to try harder, to do better, to be the best.Her father didnt speak for several minutes.Finally he said, Thats how I showed you ...I tried to make you three into productive members of society.Thats not love, Dad, Caroline said, sniffling.If you had truly loved us, seeing how miserable we were would have broken your heart.After several moments, Edward stood up.Fair enough, he said.Then he reached into his jacket and pulled out a manila envelope.He held it out to Caroline, but when she didnt take it, he set it on the couch.This is for you.As hobbled to the door, she stared at the envelope with warring emotions.What is it?Open it and see, he called from the doorway.And Caroline?What?she said.I just dont want to see you make any more mistakes, he said, opening the door.Youve come so far and surpassed my expectations.You know, I gave you six months before youd come home, begging to be taken back.I guess I proved you wrong, huh?Caroline said, watching the man shed once thought larger than life lean on his cane.Yes, I suppose you did, he said, starting to close the door.Hey, Dad, she called.Yes?Go see Valerie, Caroline said, picking up the envelope.Out of the three of us, shes the only one who loved you enough to try to follow the plans you laid out for her.She should get points for that.Her father didnt answer as he shut the door, and Caroline sat down heavily on the couch, the manila envelope in her lap.That was probably the oddest yet most honest conversation you two have ever had.And it had only taken thirty years.Staring down at the envelope, she slowly twisted the metal prongs and the flap sprang up.She wasnt sure what she would find.Had her father dug into Gabes past and found something?Was it all the dirt he had collected on Kyle?Dumping the envelope upside down, she let the contents fall next to her on the couch.And was dumbstruck.There were pictures, dozens of them, of her over the last twelve years.Pictures of her leaving the strip club.Sleeping in her car.Even when shed been arrested.As she sifted through the scattered photos, she realized that angry, loud sobs had begun wracking her body.Hed had her followed, had known everything all along.And for what?What did this prove?That hed been making sure she was still alive?Had he enjoyed watching her struggle and tread water?Beneath the pile was a scrap of yellow paper, and with shaking hands, she picked it up, unfolding it to read the words.Caroline, Despite the fact that I kept my distance, I needed to know you were all right.I thought if I just gave you time, you would come home, but you never gave up.Your mother was that waydetermined.It was why I married her; she never gave up on me, even when I was at my worst.You may think that you have seen the worst of me in many ways, but I need to confess: Carl Jackson didnt find you by chance.Carl and I knew each other, once upon a time, and I called in a favor.Initially, I just wanted you to get out of that hell hole you were working in; I never expected you to find your passion.Sometimes, its hard for me to accept that even I might be wrong every once in a while.I know it doesnt mean much to you, but I am proud of what youve done.Your father, Edward Willis Caroline gripped the letter tightly as tears dripped onto the blue ink.She didnt know how to take her fathers big reveal.Was she angry?Perhaps a littlejust because in all the years shed known Carl, hed never said a word.The path to her success had started with her fathers calling in a favor.Let it go, she thought.This is his way of making amends.Of showing you he cares in his own, twisted way.It was a step in the right direction.THE NEXT MORNING, Caroline lay in Gabes arms, listening to the sound of his breathing.It was four oclock, but she couldnt sleep.Gabe was supposed to take her to the airport at ten, but she wasnt so sure she wanted to be stuck in a car with him for two hours, with so many doubts rolling around in her head.Last night, after theyd settled in for bed, Gabe had asked her to meet his sister.Caroline knew how much Honey meant to him and that this was a big gesture on his part.It said he was serious about them and looking toward the future.Yesterday, shed been so sure, so positive that all her preconceived notions about him were wrong, that this was the guy for her, and he wasnt just like every other guy that shed fallen for: a big disappointment waiting to happen.But between the exclusivity talk with Gabe, her fathers drop in bombshell, and all of the emotional upheaval between her sisters and her, she was in intimacy overload.She wasnt used to sharing her feelings so much and taking the next step toward something seemingly better.And suddenly, it was seriously wigging her out.Just then, she heard Possum scratching in the litter box, and she crawled out of bed to check on him.When he saw her peek around the corner, he started whining.Hey, buddy, you miss brother?she said, sitting down on the floor so he could rub on her.Me too.Stroking the kitten, Caroline realized that she needed to take a couple days and clear her head.She was just confused, and with a little distance and perspective, shed be able to decide if she could ever fully trust anyone.If she couldnt do that, what kind of future would she have?SLEEPILY, GABE REACHED for Caroline, expecting a groan of irritation for trying to wake her, but his hand hit cold sheets.Opening his eyes, he searched the room for any sign of her but saw nothing.He got up from the bed and headed down the hall, stopping off at the bathroom to take a piss.In the living room, something was different.At first, he couldnt put his finger on it.Then he realized her luggage was gone.He went back into his room to grab some clothes and saw that his clock read 10:45.They were supposed to have left at ten to get to the airport by noon.Gabe dressed quickly and went downstairs, just to be sure.Her car was gone.It didnt make any sense.Why would she just leave without telling him?When he walked back into the house, he went to grab his phone from the charger and saw a sheet of paper on the counter.Gabe, I just need some time to think.Ill be back on Monday.Please feed Possum.C.  Gabe stared at the note and started to laugh.He laughed until he couldnt breathe as he reread the letter again and again.For the first time in his life, hed opened up to a woman and tried to share pieces of himself.And she had bailed.Taken off without even saying good bye to his face.It says she just needs time.Maybe youre wrong.But Gabe didnt think so and as he crumpled the note in his palm, pain shook his whole body until he was shouting with it.Before he could stop himself, he was hitting the cupboards and the walls, tearing the place apart until he lay on his back, panting, cupboard doors off their hinges and gaping holes in the walls, reminding him that hed lost control.That losing Caroline had made him lose all sense.Crawling back to his feet, he took a few calming breaths before he called Chase.Can you give me a ride to Home Depot?I only have the bike, and I need to pick up some stuff.Sure, whats up?I had an accident.Gabe grimaced as he looked around the room.When Chase showed up ten minutes later, he gaped at the damage.What the fuck did you do?Try to take out a wall?Gabe smoothed out Carolines crumpled note and handed it to Chase.Ill be down by the car.Before he even reached the door, Chase said, Im sorry, man.Yeah, Gabe said, heading out the door.Hed taken a gamble on Caroline and lost.Look at that, Mom.You and I arent that different after all.Twenty Four My advice to all women is to accept the fact that insensitivity is a common trait in men.Miss Know It All   IN NEW YORK, Caroline tried not to think about Gabe or what he might be thinking after shed snuck out on him.If the lack of returned texts or calls was any indication, he must be furious with her.After the first day, the guilt had started sinking in.Why had she tried to sabotage something that was going so well?Gabe was everything, the whole package.Caring, loyal, accepting ...And shed run for the hills the minute he started getting too close.Shed already left two voicemails and six or so text messages, so any damage control she needed to accomplish would have to wait until she got home.Which had her so tied up in knots, shed hardly slept at all and missed her alarm clock this morning.Shed woken up with enough time to throw on clothes before she had to leave for her appointment with Mr.Kline.Luckily, she walked into MacAvoys Tavern with five minutes to spare and immediately saw that the bar was certainly in need of some help.It was dirty; the kitchen was inexcusable; and the bar staff was incompetent.However, the original wood carvings on the walls, the bar itself, and solid wood bar stools were exquisite, and she wondered if there might be a way to keep them.Ill need a day to come up with a solid renovation plan, but I definitely think I can help you, Mr.Kline, Caroline said to the short, round bar owner a few hours later.The man was in his early fifties and seemed like a solid person, which was part of the reason she had a hard time understanding the bars disrepair.I appreciate it, Ms.Willis, but in actuality, I asked you out here in the hopes that you might be interested in saving my bar ...for yourself.I beg your pardon?Im getting older, and to tell you the truth, my memory isnt much these days.I cant leave this place to my sons.I let them manage it for me this last year, and theyve almost ruined me.Not a brain between them, as you can see.Id like to sell the bar while its still worth something, but I cant bear to see it torn down or turned into something that it isnt.But I just settled down in Idaho, and I have ...How about friends?How about a beautiful man who makes you feel whole for the first time ever?But what if she had screwed that up beyond repair?Then you still have your family.Just take the night to consider, he said.I assure you, the price Im willing to sell it for is quite reasonable.Thanking Mr.Kline, she left the bar and decided that a walk would clear her mind.The problem with New York was, if you were looking for peace and quiet, it was a pretty long taxi ride to get there.Still, after hailing the cab, she climbed in and said, Central Park, please.You got it, the cabbie said, turning on the meter.As the cab pulled into traffic, she took her cell phone out of her pocket and checked the missed calls.Three.One from Valerie, the next from a number she didnt know, and the last from Zoe.Did you really expect him to call you?Hes not going to chase you if you dont give him a reason to.The three calls haunted her, especially Zoes.Not ready to face that one, she started off with what would probably be the angriest and dialed her sister.Is there a reason why you left for New York and didnt even ask me to drive you to the airport?I just parked my car in the extended stay lot.Its only for a couple of days.Still, it would have been a fun road trip, Val said.Besides, Ive been dying for an excuse to go to Boise and shop.I miss real shopping.Sorry, Caroline said, laughing.The guy Im consulting for just offered to sell me his bar on the cheap, so if you wanted to go into business together, we could move to New York.Then we could do some real shopping.Silence took over Vals end of the line for half a second before she asked, Are you trying to tell me something?No, I was just kidding.Did he really offer you the bar?Val asked.Yes, but Then at least some of that was the truth, Val said.Okay, you got me.There is nothing better than shopping in New York.Except for living close to your family and friends, Val said coldly.Yes, and so far, thats been delightful, Caroline sneered.People talking shit behind my back.And Ellie ...well, she wont even return my phone calls.Thats because shes going through one of her phases.But you still have me, and didnt you just tell me you were making friends last week?Val asked.Yeah.Look, Val, Im not being serious.And what about Gabe?I thought things were going great between you two, Val said.They were ...I mean, are ...I dont know.I think I may be in over my head.He wants me to meet his sister, and I said okay, but then I just took off for this trip without saying anything to him.Okay, so, you snuck out on him, after he asked you to meet his sister?Why, for Gods sake?Val asked.Because ...you dont know Gabe, okay?Meeting his sister is a big deal, and Im just scared thatI dont know; maybe Im just not ready.So, whats your plan, Caroline?To never come back, and then you wont have to deal with your feelings?Val laughed into the phone, the sound coarse and angry.God, and I thought you were finally maturing.Getting shit off your chest and moving on, but I was just seeing whatand whoI wanted to see.I didnt say I was moving here!I just got offered a bar ten minutes ago, and I havent accepted it yet.Yet being the operative term, Val said.You know what?If you want it, take it.Just go.We got along without you before, so it wont be any different the second time around.Youre acting like a brat.And youre a fucking hypocrite!All that bullshit about changing and putting old feuds to rest was a crock.You act like youve put in so much effort, but you were gone twelve years, Caroline.That is a lot of time to make up for in a month.Who says I want to make anything up to anyone?I was happy being on my own.If thats what you call happy, then I feel sorry for you, because only a person whos completely broken would think thats a life.Val hung up before Caroline could respond, but the words rushed through her, shaking her to her core.She took several breaths, trying to calm the flood of emotions.But isnt that what you always thought happiness was?Freedom?That all the men, all the nights drinking away the past were just a part of life?The cabbie pulled over, breaking through her confusion.Central Park.Keep the change, she said, handing him the cash.In the park, Caroline took the path along a little pond, smiling at the ducks as they cruised by.If that was happiness, then what have the last few weeks with Gabe been?Did all the laughter and feelings of acceptance mean nothing to you?Sitting down on a bench, she put her head between her legs.Lightheadedness and tears overwhelmed her, and she brushed at her eyes as she choked on the lump in her throat.Excuse me, maam, I dont mean to intrude, but you look like you could use this.Caroline looked up at a man standing above her, holding out a worn paisley hankie in his hand, just like the kind her grandpa used to have.The man was dirty from head to toe, wearing overalls and a worn ball cap, with a scraggly beard covering his weathered face.His eyes were crinkled but besides that, they were kind.And then she noticed his other arm was missing.Pity overwhelmed her as she took the hankie and gave him a watery smile.Thank you so much.He sat down next to her.So is it your family or your fella?The question was so forthright, it caught her off guard.Both.Ive been there, darlin, yes I have.Had me a girl years ago, sweetest blue eyes youd ever seen.She wanted me to stay in our little town and get married, but I wanted to make something of myself.Prove her daddy wrong about the type of man I was.His chuckle was raspy, turning into a harsh, wracking cough.Caroline moved to pat his back, but he waved her off, taking in deep, rattled breaths.I didnt get to do those things, though.I went into the military and lost my arm.Came home bitter and angry, and when she said it didnt matter, I spat on her love.My own brother stopped talking to me years ago, and though I get work from time to time, my demons seem to find me, no matter where I end up.Caroline smiled sadly.Mine do the same damn thing.My advicenot that youre askinis to forget what youve done, what theyve done to you, and face down your demons.He patted her knee kindly.You dont want to end up old and alone, believe me.Biting her lip, Caroline thought of what her future might look like if she took over Mr.Klines bar.She couldnt picture making a home here or anywhere else.When she thought of home, it was a two bedroom apartment above a quiet little bookstore.And in that future, when she came home, she pictured a man with deep obsidian eyes and a wicked grin, greeting her with a kiss that would melt her socks off.Thank you, she said softly.Youre welcome, darlin  the man said, getting up from the bench and moving along down the sidewalk.Pulling out her phone, she went to dial Mr.Kline to refuse his offer but saw she had a new text message from the strange number that had called before.Hey, Caroline, this is Chase, Gabes friend.I dont know if hes ever mentioned me, but look, hes in trouble.They arrested him this morning for assault, and I dont even know if you care, but he needs you.He wont say that, because hes a stubborn son of a bitch, but he does.Carolines stomach dropped out, and a thousand different situations flashed through her mindnone of them good.Jumping up from the bench, she kicked off her four inch heels and ran to flag down a taxi.Twenty Five Revenge is a dish best served cold ...and with plenty of gloating.Miss Know It All   AFTER EXPLAINING TO Mr.Kline why she had to leave so suddenly and that she couldnt possibly take his offer, Caroline packed up her suitcase and checked out of her hotel.When she arrived at the airport, she spent the night trying to get on a flight to Boise.Finally, she got a 6:00 A. M.  flight and arrived in Idaho a little after noon.Surpassing the 80 mph speed limit, Caroline arrived back in town on a mission: she was going to rescue Gabe and try to make up for bailing on him.She was a strong, independent woman who had made mistakes and turned her life around.She wasnt a princess, though Gabe often called her one, and she didnt need a knight to slay her dragons.She could do that all on her own.Her first stop was the police station.When shed called Chase back, he said they were holding Gabe there until Monday.Chase didnt know who the alleged victim was, but Caroline could only think of one man in Rock Canyon who Gabe would want to beat the snot out of.And if Kyle had provoked Gabe, intending to get revenge, she was going to use every piece of leverage her father had to destroy him.Though really, if Kyle was involved in any way, shape, or form, she would make him pay.At this point, hed threatened everyone she loved at one time or another, and there was no way in hell she was about to let him ruin Gabes life.Caroline loved Gabe.Shed known it the moment shed read Chases text message, but even before that too.Only shed been too freaked out to face it.He was hers, and she was his.She needed him.And now, he needed her.She didnt care that she was speeding, and when a cruiser pulled out behind her and flipped on his sirens, she ignored him long enough to pull up in front of the Rock Canyon Police Department.As she climbed out of her car, she heard a shout behind her.Put your hands up!She turned toward the police officer, who had his gun trained on her, and squinted.Grady Jenkins, put that fucking thing away.Put your hands up first, Caroline, Grady said.When Caroline was in high school, Grady had been a pervy freshman whod liked to crawl under lunchroom tables to stare up girls skirts.I dont have time for this, Grady, Caroline said, holding up her hands.Just get your ass over here, and get my shit.Grady kept his gun out until he was a few feet away and then put it back in his holster.I really ought to arrest you, you know.My purse is on the front seat; insurance is in the glove compartment, she said, ignoring his shout as she turned and ran for the police station entrance.Barging into the front reception area, she walked up and started banging on the bell.Hello!Officer Sam Weathers came running to the front and yanked the bell away from her.Geez, Caroline, what in hells bells has gotten into you?Do you have Gabe Moriarty in lock up, Sam?She craned her neck to see down the hallway.As a matter of fact, he said, flicking the toothpick in his mouth.When do you plan to release him?I dont, he said, and when she opened her mouth to argue, he cut her off.I got a victim that said, and I quote, Gabe Moriarty did this to me.Whatever he said, its a lie.Gabe wouldnt Wasnt a guy.It was your sister Eleanor who filed the complaint.What?Caroline hollered, sure shed heard him wrong.Yeah, she was here pitching a fit yesterday morning that shed turned him down at Bucks, and hed followed her outside to her car.Beat her so bad, poor things eye is nearly shut.Why would Ellie lie?She had to be lying.Gabe would never hurt a woman.Hed sworn hed never hurt a woman.You dont understand.I know him.He did not do this, she insisted, panic edging into her voice.Well, your knowing isnt enough to trump an eyewitness, Sam said, obviously irritated.Caroline obviously wasnt going to get anywhere with Sam; she needed to talk to Gabe.And then Ellie.Her blood was boiling, trying to figure out why her sister would lie.Was this to get back at Caroline for butting into her business?No, Ellie wouldnt be that cruel.Couldnt be.Can I see him?Please?Sam hesitated, and she repeated, Please, Sam, Im begging you.After a moment or two, he grumbled.Fine.Come on back.She almost passed Sam in her eagerness to get to Gabe, and when she saw him sitting on one of the cots, even though his eyes were closed and a dark shadow marred his jawline, he was the most beautiful thing shes ever seen.Gabe!she cried, racing to the bars.His eyes flew open, and he looked furious.What the hell are you doing here, Caroline?Im going to get you out of here.I know you didnt do this.Yeah, well, you and Chase are about the only ones, he said, bitterness clouding his tone.I have it covered.Got my court appointed attorney and everything.But you dont have to do this alone.I want to help, she said, reaching out for him.I dont know why shes doing this, but Ill talk to Ellie.We can figure this out.Then she realized he hadnt moved toward her or even tried to hold her hand.All she wanted to do was touch him, to make sure he was really okay, but he was holding back from her.Gabe ...please ...Im sorry for the way I left.I just got scared and needed a minute to put everything in perspective.Then, when Chase texted You what?Thought youd run back to town and save the day?Maybe pull some strings with your dad or, like you said, convince your sister to drop the charges?Gabe snarled.The damage is done, princess.Words out that Im an ex con who likes to beat up on women.It didnt take long for people to start digging once the cuffs came out, so my fresh start?The thing I wanted more than anything?Its over with.Well explain, Caroline said, gripping the bars hard.We can work this out No, theres no we, Gabe said harshly.You wanna help?Then go home.Whatever you thought, just get it out of your head, because I dont need you.Gabe ...she said, shaking with the pain of his words.He couldnt mean it.He ignored her as he leaned his head back again and closed his eyes.Gabe, please look at me, she said, hanging on to the bars as her knees weakened.At least you finally got what you always wanted, he said without looking at her.The apartment is yours.I dont want that!I havent asked for my own space, and I dont want to lose you, so will you stop acting so defeated?You.Did.Not.Do.This.And Ill prove it, she said vehemently.Hey, no worries, princess.We both knew that living arrangement was only temporary.At least we got to have some fun along the way.Part of her knew he was just saying that because he was hurt and angry, but the other, insecure part asked, Fun?Is that all it was to you?Well, hell, what else was it supposed to be?I thought maybe you had actually turned into a human being, that you might actually be more than just Just what?An ex con?A loser?He opened his eyes to stare right at her.The blank expression in them broke her heart.Stop it!I didnt say any of that.I just meant that I know you try so hard to keep people at bay and for a while there, I felt like you were letting me in.Gabe shook his head.Just go, Caroline, okay?Ill be fine.We had a good run, but honestly?Id be happy if I never saw you or your sisters again.Caroline thought her chest was going to break open, the pain was so intense.Before she could plead or say anything else, Sam put his hand on her arm.Come on, Caroline, its time to go.She started to follow Sam but stopped and said, I know you think I gave up on you, but youre wrong.I had a weak moment, but I came home.To you.And I am not going to give up this easily.She didnt wait for him to respond.As she passed through the front doors of the police station, she saw that Grady had shut all her doors and left a ticket on her windshield.Caroline pulled it off before climbing inside, then glanced down at the total and laughed at the three hundred dollar scrap of paper.Her laughter soon turned to tears, and she laid her arms on her steering wheel, sobbing into them.Even if she saved Gabes reputation, she might have already lost him.Hed given her exactly what shed needed, accepted her for who she was, but when hed opened his heart and invited her inside, shed bolted.If it was the last thing she did, she would make it up to Gabe.Even if he never forgave her.CAROLINE STOPPED BY the veterinary hospital on the way home to check on Googlie.Zoe had been happy to report that he was eating and drinking again and had started gaining weight.Caroline had been surprised to find out that Gabe had dropped Possum off on Friday to be with his brother.Apparently, it had been a turning point in Googlies improvement and although she was happy he was doing better, shed asked Zoe to keep the kittens a few more days while Caroline sorted out Gabes situation.Luckily, Zoe agreed.She parked in front of the bookstore, figuring that Gabes bike was in the back.When she reached the stairs, she found Ellie sitting at the top, waiting for her.Even from several feet away, she could see the bruises on her sisters face and knew shed taken a hell of a beating.Holy fuck, who the hell did this to you?It was Kyle, Ellie said quietly.Caroline grabbed the railing, afraid she was going to hurl over the side.You were seeing Kyle?He did this to you?No, I was never seeing him.I swear, she said, confusing the hell out of Caroline.Okay, you werent seeing Kyle, but hes been beating the shit out of you?I wanted to explain Why youre pressing charges against Gabe?Ellie stood up, her eyes shifting away.So, you heard?Okay, that pissed her off.On one hand, she was prepared to dismember Kyle, slowly and with a very dull knife, for hurting Ellie.But on the other hand, Ellie was acting like it was no big deal that Gabe was sitting in jail for something Kyle did.What the fuck was going on?Oh yeah, I heard.What do you mean, oh, so you heard?Like its some casual piece of gossip in that stupid blog you follow?Carolines voice rose until she was screaming, You accused the man I love of assaulting you!Are you fucking insane?If Kyle did this to you, why the hell did you accuse Gabe?Can we just go inside, please, and Ill explain?Ellie said, starting to stand but she was moving so slowly that Caroline finally put her arm around her sister to help her.I would just like to say that although part of me wants to strangle you, the fact that you wouldnt tell Val or me that he was hurting you is just crazy.Why would you let him do this to you?Does he have something on you?Its a long story.Good thing weve got some time, then.Inside, Caroline stopped when she caught sight of the kitchen, which had putty filled holes in the walls.Some of the doors to the cabinets were on the floor, and there were tools everywhere.Geez, talk about a disaster zone.Shed ask Gabe what had happened later, once she had him out of jail.Lowering Ellie to the couch, Caroline plopped down next to her.Okay, talk.Now.When Ellie winced, Caroline reached out to take her hand.Do you need something for the pain?No, I took something earlier, but I cant take painkillers if Im gonna drive.Okay, Caroline said, waiting for Ellie to say more, but she seemed at a loss.Start at the beginning.How did you get involved with Kyle?Ellie took a deep breath before answering.Last year, I was driving home from a bar in Twin Falls, but Id only had one drink, so I thought I was fine.That I could make it home.It wasnt very far.Caroline thought back to Gabes own DUI and the tragic circumstances surrounding it.You know better, Ellie.I know.The worst part was that I drifted into the other lane and hit another car.The driver lived, but she had a broken leg and some other injuries.I freaked out and drove off, she said, running a hand through her hair.I was underage and driving under the influence.When I hit her, all I could think of was that my life was over.Then the police started investigating and offering rewards for witnesses.Kyle caught me trying to pop the dent out of my beamer, and when I confessed to him, he took care of it.How, for Gods sake?Caroline asked, horror mixing with her fury.He offered the woman a large settlement to change her story.Since no one else saw what happened, it was easier than I thought, Ellie said, shaking her head.But when I offered to pay Kyle out of my trust after I turned twenty five, he said he didnt want my money.He wanted a favor.What did he want?Caroline asked.They sat down on the couch, and Ellie continued, He wanted me to dig up dirt on Dad, which is part of the reason I have that file of all his shady dealings.He said wed be square if I gathered info and gave it to him, but I couldnt.Dad may be a rotten bastard most of the time, but hes still my dad.But when Dad started digging into Kyles past, he became obsessed with what Dad might know, and he ...he started threatening me.Is that when the beatings started?
