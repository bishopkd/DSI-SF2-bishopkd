I never felt it before, but now it follows me everywhere.It won't move on.Since we kissed the other day, my mind hasnt escaped you.It scares me, Ella.I scare you?I whisper.No, quite the opposite.He lets out a loud sigh.The tension has dramatically increased in the car.The windows have steamed up from our body heat.I decide to write on the one closest to me.Love is a quest and youre not my ending.I unlock the door and step out into the open; the cold air fills my lungs.Ella, what are you doing?Staying away from you.I slam the door.I know Im going to get a reaction, and I think I like that feeling.As if on cue, he steps out and walks around to where Im stood.I turn to look at him and all I can see is his outline.What a fine outline he is.You dont know me, Luke.My heart has a thousand secrets all hidden away just for me.Why jeopardize my feelings and create a world of emotion that I can't contradict?Why break my heart before its even fully yours to break?I move and rest my back against the cool metal of the car door and slide down to the soft grass below.I feel Luke copy my motions.He sits next to me, our arms touching.He picks up my hand and kisses each knuckle individually.I wish this could work, Ella, but I dont know how.He puts his arm around me and I shuffle so I can rest my head on his shoulder.Life is a mystery as you say, maybe love is too.Im not the girl for you, Luke.I mean, I have problems okay, so many.I cant get you involved in my life, just as you dont want me in yours.I dont even know if Ive made it into college.Well, the one I want.I got into UCLA to study, but its so far away.I got into their extension writers' program.They only accept just over 400 students per year, so Im lucky I guess.Something in my life has finally gone my way.I just dont think Ill do very well.You will, Ella.He said very matter of factly.You barely know me, Luke.I mutter too quietly.I know you better than you think.I raise my head to look at him, even though I can see nothing.Luke, Im a very private person.My life is sealed off from everyone apart from my sister.Even Jade doesnt know me that well.My life is a lie, Luke.Everything is a lie.I have a voice that just sits there, and at inappropriate times, tells me Im worthless.That Im pointless, and that never goes away, it never leaves me.I let out a sigh and softly shake my head.Ella you need to talk to him.Talk to someone.Luke   I have baggage, so Im not right for you.You have money, a stunning girlfriend, and an expensive car.You get invited everywhere.All the local parties and pep rallies.In the last year, Ive only been invited to the writer's lunch and that was insistent.I dont have a typical fun high school life.Im boring, and youre fun, and exciting, and handsome.Thats what you assume, but its not the truth.Truth is, is that Im just as scared as you.Just as worried.Frightened in fact.Life is scary, Ella, I have problems too, youre not the only one.Dont judge me, Luke!I snap.Like you didnt judge me just a minute ago.He mutters under his breath.I dont need this, I don't need you, Im going.I go to get up and he grabs me and pulls me onto his lap so that Im astride him.I let out a scream and it turns into a giggle.Kiss me, he whispers.No.I whisper back and bend myself, so that Im next to his ear.I inhale his beautiful scent."Like I said, maybe when high school is done.I smile under my words, and it feels good to reject someone else rather than be the victim.As I pull away, he grabs and gently holds either side of my face, his hands in my hair.He pulls me closer, so that our lips are barely touching.Ella, what are you doing to me?his whisper is unraveling and I want to kiss him, but I won't, I cant get hurt, not again.Likewise, Luke.I breathe back.Im biting my bottom lip and our heartbeats and muttered breaths are all that is heard among the crickets and night animals.I feel confidence sweep me and I raise my hand to his heart.Maybe one day, when high school and college is done and there is no one to worry us, I can have this, Luke.To care and look after me, to love me.But for now, until that day, I cant see you, because all Ill want to do is hold your hand, kiss your lips, and sleep side by side with you.Breathe the same air as you, but we cant, and our fate has been intervened.Maybe one day, but not today.I climb to walk away and he pulls gently on my hand.No, Ella   Bye, Luke.Please let me take you home.Its the least I could do.His voice sounds hurt and quiet.Fine, Ill have to walk to wherever this is in the morning.Ella, I said Id pick you up and bring you back, and I will.I climb off of his legs and walk around to open the passenger door.When he climbs into the driver's seat, he pauses.Ella, I dont think I can just be your friend.He sighs and shakes his head.Then dont be.I whisper, a plea, a beg.The tension is back and it is driving us together, but neither of us a take a chance or a moment to notice and take control.I don't understand my words, what this is.You know I cant, Ella.His tone is blunt and filled with hidden regret.Why not?Because itll destroy your high school reputation?Itll ruin your chance of being 'Prom King'?Everyone will laugh, and point, and stare at you?Welcome to my fucking world.The anger in my voice subsides immediately.You know what's funny?I voted for you to be Prom King, stupid huh?I smile and stifle a laugh he joins in.When we stop, seriousness surrounds us again.That's not the reason.None of those things you have just said are the reason.His voice is shaken.Then what?What could he possibly mean?If he won't be ashamed of me?I can't fall in love with you.Not now, give or take two or three months ago then maybe, but I cant go to college and be in love.That's so selfish of you!Maybe I dont want your love.I dont want you if you really dont want me.I feel, I dont know what I feel, but ever since I looked at you and kissed you, I became entrapped with you.I just cant forget you.Everything I have written today has been about you.You have captured me, Luke, like a hopeless butterfly caught in a net.What angers me the most, is that I cant do anything about it.There is something I want to share with you before we only become, well, friends.I open the door and walk toward my car.Luke leaves the headlights of his unnecessarily expensive jeep thing on so we can see what we are doing.I check my back pocket, and to my surprise, there are my keys, just sat there in my pocket.I pull them out and Luke studies me with dominance.No, Luke, Im not going to drive.Im just going to put my iPod on.I smile at him and he smiles back.I finally feel some relaxation after the whole charade.I put on the song that I think fits the moment.'Heartbeats' fills our ears and a gentle soft guitar immediately makes me feel at ease.I climb onto the hood of my Mustang.Who is this?Luke asks.Jose Gonzalez.The song is called Heartbeats.Its fitting, come on.I hold my hand out for him to follow me onto the hood of my car.He takes it and we laugh when he falls against the hard metal.Lay back and look at true beauty.The stars are out in full force tonight.Its a perfect night for stargazing.Isnt the sky beautiful?I always count myself lucky to have life, so I can have moments like this.See magnificent things, with these magnificent cameras we all call eyes.Capturing and memorizing our precious memories and storing them in our own personal photo album.Like a human camera.He whispers.Like a human camera.I repeat.We sit and gaze for at least ten minutes, neither of us speaking, Heartbeats playing on repeat, and right now, I could listen to it forever.I drop my hands to my side, and its then that Luke grabs my hand.His fingers weave and lock with mine, and an unexplained shiver takes over my body.I sit up immediately and he follows.You cant do that.I protest.I can, Ella, and I will.Before I can even mutter a reply he is over me, kissing me with such persistence and force that I'm demanded to lay back.Butterflies explode in my stomach and over power me.His kiss grows deep and he toys and bites my bottom lip.I let out a groan and give his tongue easy access to fight mine.Our tongues lock and caress each other, it feels like a real kiss should, but this one just means so much more.His hands hold my face and bury into my hair, his body is leant over mine, delicately avoiding hurting me.When he gently lets go, he is breathless.Im staring into his eyes and the green of his connects with the grey of mine.He rests his forehead on mine and closes his eyes.Ella, He breathes.Date me, let's go somewhere.Let's try.Youll be made fun of, Luke.They will all make jokes.I dont care.I want to get to know you.I want to know you, Ella.All of you.What your favorite food is, where you grew up, what your favorite perfume is, and what's your favorite song?Your best memory and your personal goal.Do you like tea or coffee?I just want to know you, Ella.I shift underneath him and he gently slides off me and onto the grass.Luke, its late, we need to go.I climb down, retrieve my keys from the ignition, and walk back to his car.I try the passenger door, and its locked.Unlock this please.He stands and comes behind me, my back to his front.He puts his head next to my ear and breathes in.No. "His whisper is almost seductive.Turn around, Ella, let me see you.I turn, and he doesnt look at me   but kisses me and lets me fall deep into him again.My hands are pinned under him against the car.I break away and my breathing calms.Open the door, Luke.Date me.He demands.Maybe.I say, through an unrecognized smile.He opens the door with the key, rather than the key fob, and doesnt take his eyes off mine.When it unlocks, he lets me go.Thank you.You're welcome.He walks around the car and gets into the driver's side.He slides into his seat with such grace.Mac and cheese, Charlotte   North Carolina, I dont wear perfume, Dream Catch Me, watching Holly grow up, to be a writer, and coffee.Anything else?I dont think I stopped to breathe.I look at him and catch his smile.He starts the car and the huge engine roars to life.Mac and cheese huh?Interesting choice.His smile is infectious.I like mac and cheese.I grumble.What kind of car is this?Its huge, just for one person.Its a Mercedes ML Class 4.0 v8 diesel.I got it for my eighteenth birthday.Are you going to continue to ask me pointless questions or are we going to talk about what just happened?The car speeds slightly and I can tell instantly from his driving, he is getting anxious.I don't know what to say, Luke.I like you kissing me.Feeling all those magical flutters flow through my veins, its like an explosion that I cant subside.I shake my head and he slows the speed of the car slightly.I like kissing you too.He breathes.He plays around with something on the steering wheel and the car is filled with music.'When September ends'.As he drives, the song sends me off into a daydream.The lyrics are speaking to me in a way they shouldnt.I try to block it out, but here it comes.Its back and raging in full force.I need to cut.No, I dont!Cut Ella!Cut!Cut!NO!My mind is torturing me.I must have forgotten to take my pills.Im oblivious to where I am.Im with Luke.He cares for me.No, I dont need to cut.I don't.I dont.I FUCKING DONT.Okay Ella, calm down.Remember what your Dr.said.Happiness is with the beholder.No, Luke, doesnt care for me, he just wants to fuck me.NO!I need to get home before I have an anxiety attack.My whole body has tensed just from one sad song.I cant be this weak, I got so far.I feel sweat pour down my face.Luke puts on another song and all that tension and wanting to hurt goes.It feels so much better.Im calmed immediately.Its 'Baby Got Back'.He goes to change the track and I have to stop him.No, Luke, I like this song.So he leaves it and we drive down the long road I was so relaxed driving on earlier.Three      We drive home with soft songs playing, none of which are making me anxious.I direct him to my house and we laugh and joke all the way.I totally forget about my anxiety attack.Im glad I controlled it and that he didnt have to witness it.At least not yet, well, thats if he wants some kind of relationship with me.If he knew, he would be running for the hills.My illness is forbidden to be spoken about.Sometimes I just have to scream it out, run and scream.Its so built up, but my pills help me.My mom was heartbroken when she found out what I had done.I was shocked to see her that way.Begging me to stop, pulling at my clothes, sobbing.I just held her.Held her until she stopped.Its an addiction.Just one more pill, just one more drink, just one more drag, just one more cut.Were all addicted to something, something that takes away the pain.Were all scared of ourselves.Scared of the inner workings of our own minds.Desperate for an escape, a way out, a release.Living in such a cruel world, we dont know what to do anymore.Weve lost sight of who we are.We just indulge in habits that kill us; kills us so sweetly, so sinfully.We take comfort in the pain, its familiar, its what we know.Just one more pill, just one more drink, just one more drag, just one more cut.Were all addicted to something that takes away the pain, but my pain is still there and nobody knows.Its hidden.I dont want to tell Luke, and thats our fate killed already because of my stupid fucking addiction.When we pull up outside my house, my feelings subside, I feel relaxed, but my palms are sweaty.He stops, puts on the brake, and turns off the ignition.He bows his head.Ella, I dont know what you are feeling right now, but I wish I did.This is going quick.We havent even had a date yet and Im barely broken up from Jenna.His words are a whisper.I dont understand.Now hes dumping me, again?What?Hes right, we dont know each other and hes only just left his hot shot beautiful girlfriend.Fuck this.What happened to the Luke that just shared such an intimate experience with me?Did he disappear?I think we should slow down.Before one of us gets hurt.Little late for that, don't you think, Luke?With those words, the destroyed look on his face, combined with the embarrassed look on mine, I pull at my seatbelt and unlock the door.It slams behind me and even makes me jump.I walk as fast as I can towards my front door and I can feel eyes on me.His eyes.My bag is too fucking big!I cant find my keys and the frustration is irritating.I feel a warm hand on my shoulder, which stills me immediately.I turn, and his lips lock with mine.Again, those unsuspected butterflies are released in my body, making my blood run warm and my breath lose itself.*****    The sun woke me with its light piercing through the tiny gap in my drapes.I squint and smile.The first time in such a long time, I have smiled when waking.I turn, stretch, and look up at my ceiling.Last night my life changed.All my demons were erased by this one single man.He made me feel the impossible, like life was a gift.I have never felt that pleasure of loving life.He has kissed me more than any other man has my entire life and every single time I felt warm and myself.If he doesnt choose me, then what should I do?Shall I return to being depressed lonely Ella, surrounded by her haunts and selfish memories?SHIT!What is the time?The panic swoons my face and it makes me sit up right.My cell isnt on my bedside drawer.Where the fuck is my cell?I Im turning my room upside down, when there is a knock on my door.Im only in lace panties and a Metallica tee.The doorknob turns and my mom walks in, with Luke by her side.I freeze and blush instantly, I pulling at the hem of my shirt to hide my bare legs.I turn and pick up my blanket from my bed.I cover myself and sit on my dresser to hide my modesty.Hi.I manage.Ella, honey, sorry.Luke is here to take you to school?Erm, yeah, er, Mom, can you give us both a minute?she looks at me puzzled.I give her a reassuring smile and nod my head.Okay, darling.She leaves and shuts the door gently behind her.My mom gets it.She gets what I need.Instantly Luke walks towards me, scoops me up in his arms, and places me on the bed.He moves his hands across my torso up to my face.His lips again meet mine, making all sorts of feelings erupt in me.I move and make the kiss deeper, welcoming.His body is hard against mine, like hes desperate for my taste.He hardens beneath his jeans and that makes me want him.I have never felt that.We kiss for what feels like an eternity before we break.His hands cover my cheeks and he looks deep into me.Hi, beautiful, he smiles.Morning.I whisper.What time is it?He climbs off me and grabs his cell from his jeans.He is sat up right, straddling me.Wearing a tight black T shirt with light jeans that have those sexy slits in the knees.My God, this man is attractive.He shifts and his hair sweeps across his eyes before he pushes it back.He moves over me and rests his forehead against mine until our lips are just barely touching.The lightening force overpowers us and this sudden urge is undeniable.I need to be with this man.His green eyes pierce mine and a thrill of pleasure ushers over my body.Its 6am.He whispers against my lips.He lays a gentle kiss on my closed mouth and moves away from me.No, come back.I suddenly realize I am half naked laid out on my bed before a man who I barely know.Shit, hes going to see them.No, no, no.Panic radiates my body and I stumble to my feet.Please don't look at me, Luke, please.I can feel the tears build from within as I scramble to find some clothes.Why, Ella, you are beautiful.I turn to face him and drop my clothes.No Im not.I stutter my words and the tears make me heave.Ella, why are you crying?Please, baby, dont cry.What have I said?Are you okay?He walks over to me and puts my head in his hands.I instantly look down and away from him.Ella, look at me.Please.I look up to meet his gaze and quickly wipe my eyes.He seems to look genuinely worried about me.Do I need to talk to him?Tell him my deepest secrets?My whole life, the lies, the hate.Im sorry.My whisper cries with me and I just cant stop, the valve wont switch off.I drop to my knees and sob so hard.I just dont want there to be any problems.Why am I so fucked up?Why am I the problem?Luke follows me to the ground and pulls me onto his lap.He holds me and I feel him breathe me in as I try control my hysteria.Ella, I dont know why you feel this way, or why you are crying, but let me help.Let me in.I know it has only been a couple of days, but I need to know you.You are everything right now.I want to see you.Look at me.I look to meet his gaze, and Im sure my eyes are bright pink.His soft hands wipe my tears away and the loose strand of hair is tucked behind my ear.I feel a smile sweep my face and I can feel myself blushing.Thats better.You look beautiful, cry face or no cry face.He smiles at me, a full face of teeth and love.I find myself looking away again.Ella, what is it?He interrogates me further.I hurt myself.What, where?Let me see.I giggle subconsciously and he stares at me, with a confused look spread across his face.No, you dont understand, I hurt myself, Luke.Most days, some days.Ella, I dont follow, what do you mean you hurt yourself?Well done Ella, you really have to tell him now, and pray to God that he doesnt tell anyone.Im a self harmer.My words are barely at a whisper.I look at his stunned reaction and stand up.I lift my shirt over my head so that Im stood naked, except my bra and panties before him.My hair falls down around my shoulders, barely covering my bra.I shuffle my feet and look down at him; his eyes are invading my body, my soul.I have depression.I have had it since I was thirteen years old.Ever since I started to bloom in high school, I was catapulted into who I am today.A depressed, messed up girl, who constantly looks like hell and has no friends.Who lives here every day with no hopes for tomorrow.Luke, you should go.I turn, so that my back faces him, and put my shirt back over my head and awkwardly shuffle to find some jeans.I pull them on and open my bedroom door.Go on, go for fucks sake.You wont want me now.Just like everybody else.Ella, I   I shake my head and look up at him.Luke, just save the sympathy, and you can save the emotions, too.You wont win.Let me speak, God damn it!His words make me jump and it makes me thankful my parents are two floors below us.The anger in his voice brings back my tears, stinging already sore eyes with the saltiness of them.Sorry.I whisper.He walks towards me and gently lifts my hand from the handle.Slowly shutting the door, he pushes me up to the cold wood and holds both my hands.His eyes penetrate mine and he looks hurt, as his nose grazes mine, he sighs deeply.I take the time to breathe him in.I dont know why you feel that way, Im sorry you suffered during high school.Im sorry I didnt talk to you sooner.I always noticed you, Ella.Thats not even a fucking lie.I know you were in math with me; you always chewed your pen, man that bugged the shit out of me.I noticed when you werent in school, when your desk was empty.I always noticed when you were having a bad day.You always wore your hood up if you were sad.You always wore bright colors when you were happy.I know I cant make you better, but even though your body is covered in faint white lines that show each individual sad time in your life   I still want you, and to be honest, when you took your shirt off I wasnt looking at the scars.I was looking at you.He smiles, which then turns into laughter and I find myself joining him.My head gently rests against his shoulder and I memorize him, his warmth.I want to remember this.I havent ever told anyone.Not even Jade knows, only my family knows.His eyes again focus solely on me and my heart flutters an unknown feeling.It causes me to catch my breath.His mouth turns into a sexy smile that makes me want to kiss him.His fingers begin to weave through my hair and its so soothing.Considering I have no make up on and look a mess, he is still being so delicate with me.Oh my God.I have just admitted to a boy who I havent even been on a date with yet that I suffer from depression.I sigh and drop my head."Shhh, Ella, stop those voices.Look at me. "He helps me lift my head and his hands hold my head firmly.I think Im falling in love with him.These are the kisses you watch in movies, not real life.His hands are weaving in my hair, touching my cheeks.When he breaks the kiss, he strokes my bottom lip with his thumb and I open my eyes.I dont know if you felt what I just felt right then, Ella, but we both need to try this, just so I can kiss you like that for days, months, years.I look up and smile at him, our eyes searching each others emotions.We ride to school talking and deciding on a date.My car was outside my house when we left.He had driven it back for me   which I though was insanely sweet, and to my surprise on the drivers seat laid a single white lily.This again, made me feel deep for him.We pull into the parking lot, with faces starting at us in all directions, invading both of us, desperate for the tiniest bit of gossip.Ignore them, Ella.Luke whispered.He maneuvered the car into a space, which he made look so delicate and turned off the engine.Ready to face the lions?He smiled at me.With that, I had my reassurance from him and stepped out of the car.Four      It was nothing like he said.School was a nightmare.I didnt see Luke all day, apart from one time.It was nothing like he said.I thought that maybe now things would be different.He hadnt contacted me all day.Not through text or email.He just ignored me.He was standing at a locker with a group of typical high school jocks.All of them laughing and joking.He really fit in and he looked so handsome.I didnt want to intrude anyway, so what happened shocked me all the more.I was alone, walking the corridor, minding my own business, when they slashed me open with their foul words.Ella Smella!one shouted, which made me look around.I stood staring, dumbfounded, like I'd been punched hard in my gut.All the air escaped my lungs and tears pricked my eyes.Luke had just made fun of me.He laughed along with the other guys and I felt my legs want to give way underneath me.My tears began to fall and I turned to walk away.But before I could continue, I mustered some courage from God knows where, and I had to prove something.I stormed over to them as they carried on laughing and pushed Luke hard against a locker.His hands flew up in protest and pushed me away.Jesus, Ella, what the hell?You deserve nothing, life isnt to be fucked with, and its a fucking joy.A JOY!I yelled.You keep breaking me, watching me snap.You're nothing, Luke.Call me Ella Smella again, watch me break.Im sure its fun for all you dicks right now in high school to hurt people like me.People who have been an outcast from day fucking one.He broke me.I feel myself give way and fall to the ground, and again, they all laugh at me.I look up to see Luke acting like everything's okay.This man who made me feel such hope and grace for him this morning has now completely fucked me over to make fun of me.My tears flood my eyes and my body shudders as I breathe in.Ella, youre beautiful.He says   much to my surprise.I look up to see his face as his hands grab my shoulders and lift me to my feet.The men surrounding us ask Luke what the fuck he was doing.Luke, shes a freak!one of them says.No, she isnt, shes an angel in disguise.His knuckles graze my cheek.I pull away.Not breaking eye contact, I run as fast as I can in the direction I hope was the exit.I need my car and I didnt have it.I live four miles away from school and I really didnt want to run or walk the entire way.It was only half past two, so I was also skipping school.I end up at my bridge and found my bench.I just sit there thinking of what I want and need.He obviously wanted to prove a point to his friends, that part I understood, but not in that way.I feel humiliation, hurt, and devastation all at once.Then confusion hit me at one hundred miles an hour.I weave my hands in and out of each other trying to think.I rest my head in my hands as my arms lean half bent on my knees.Luke James.This man within less than one hundred hours has captivated me.Captured me and changed my life.I am already feeling love.It hurts; its causing me to sweat, to wonder, and to feel guilt.Why is this happening to me?I dont deserve to be in love with a beautiful, popular guy.It just doesnt happen to girls like me.Im sure he isnt thinking about love.Probably just wants to get into my pants.He cant be.His gentleness, his kisses that felt like gifts, it felt like he had such a passion to want me, to kiss me.A shiver moves through me, causing my skin to break out in goose pimples.I look to my left, then my right, hoping that maybe he followed me.There is a woman at the other end of the bridge.I look away, and she doesnt move.Shes just standing there.The feeling of fear starts cursing my veins, searing my heart.I sit, afraid to move.What if its the girl from the other night?What if its Sarah?I look slowly to my left and she was still there.I look back with my eyes shut and inhale deeply.With courage I didnt realize I had, I stand slowly to my feet.Stop, Ella, dont walk away, I just want to talk to you.Her voice doesn't match the voice I heard last night and every muscle in my body relaxes.I still didnt know who she was.I turn to face her and she looks shaded, lost.A spitting image of me two years ago.It makes me feel sad to see someone like this.Who are you?I ask, trying to cover up the remainder of my fear.My name is Sarah.Im sure you have heard of me.Fuck.I watch as she tucks a loose strand of long golden hair behind her ear.Her eyes are dark, the circles underlining them taking away the aspect of her true beauty.Shes stick thin, she looks unwell, and her clothes hang off her like a garbage bag would.Her eyes dont leave mine as she speaks to me.I'm afraid she might hurt me, but looking at her, I highly doubt it.Yes, Sarah, I have heard of you, what do you want?I try to make it sound as un threatening as possible.I'm pissed that she thought she could just follow me and scare me, but at the same time, she had some kind of aura that made me feel almost sorry for her.Clinging to her hoody like it was sacred.It was definitely a letterman jacket and I had an inkling to why she had it.I have come to see you as a warning, and as a fellow lover of Lukes.Fellow lover?My heart sank as those words escaped from her mouth.I watched her expression as she studied mine.The tension was building; I could feel myself getting wound up and my anxiety kicking in.You attacked me, Sarah.Why are you back?Luke and I arent together either.So I have no idea why you did that to me.Attacked you?I didnt attack you, Ella.My body shudders in response.Who the fuck attacked me then?You didnt?Then who did?Sarah, what are you doing here?My nerves responded and I start to shake.Her eyes were a piercing bright green color.They remind me of someone who had felt pain and loss.Im here to warn you.Her voice is stern and arrogant.What do you mean warn me?About what?My face twists into a puzzled look and my left eyebrow cocks in response.Her smile makes me want to run up to her and hit her straight in the face.How dare she become cocky with me!Luke, hes still in love with me.The giggle that escapes her mouth makes me even angrier towards her.Im not having this girl who ruined Lukes life threaten me with her lies.Oh really?Then why is he seeing me?After listening to me say these words she tutted so loud I could feel my blood begin to boil.Hes not all over you, you dont know what youre talking about.He was fucking me last night and the night before.She says this with such arrogance and certainty; her smile still captures her face.It makes my stomach sick, and the tears were filling up that dam that has become all too familiar recently.Youre lying!He was with me after I was attacked.I could barely hide the quivering sob coming from my mouth.What time?About ten until midnight.Sarah, listen, it doesn't bother me if you were having sex with Luke.We are not together.What she doesnt know wont hurt her.I cant tell her I feel I'm falling in love with him, but what she doesnt know is that my heart is slowly breaking.How could he?He spoke those beautiful words to me.Hes seen my body.FUCK.Hes seen me bared naked to him.My whole body starts to shake with adrenaline.Adrenaline that wants to fight back at Luke.He was with me before he came and got you, and he came back to me at one am.He told me he was going to help a friend out and that hed be back later.She smiles a sweet smile out of the corner of her mouth and looks down at her feet like she was remembering something.Sarah, he told me you and him were separated.Done, over.Are you telling me you are both still together?We are not together, but we are still fucking.Again, her giggle irritates me.Can you stop calling it that please?Have some respect for yourself, God.Sarah, Im not interested in what you, or any of his exes, have to say.I am my own person.Im liable to sleep with whoever I want.Be whoever I want   One sec, Luke's calling me.Hey, Luke, yeah sure, baby....why not...Like the other night?..Sure, lets talk.She hung up the phone and a sadistic, twisted grin appeared on her face.My stomach churned and I thought I was going to be sick.See you later, Ella.Remember what I said.She starts to laugh and walks away.Whatever, Sarah.I whisper, barely audible.I split in two; my hands hold my nauseous stomach.My head bows and my tears land onto the concrete.I stand slowly, wipe my eyes, and feel sheer anger.I scramble through my jean pocket and ring Luke's number.Hello?His voice is beautiful.I shut my eyes at it; it hurts so much to hear.I just want to see him.Fuck you.Ella?I just held the phone to my ear to listen for the next lot of words, but I jumped down his throat before hed even gotten the chance.Keep screwing your ex, forget me, Luke.Forget this shit.I slammed the phone shut before I could hear a reply, because I knew I would just fall to his feet if I heard him speak one more time.I straighten up and wipe my eyes.My body becomes immediately anxious and I try to regulate my breathing.I start to walk in the direction of home, trying to forget the shit I just heard.When I reach my house, Lukes Mercedes is sitting outside.I decide against going indoors and continue to walk down the street I knew all too well.I duck when it came to walking past the house and scatter my way to the other side of the road.I wont take this shit.I deserve love, not someone who wants to screw around with his leftovers.I cant help but know I already have some kind of deep feelings for him.It wont shift or leave me alone.Its followed me around all day and thats why its hurt me.Why I have wanted to cry.I barely know him so It doesnt matter if I have feelings or not.Hes nothing to me.I walk up to a house with a beautiful white picket fence, gazing for a little while, remembering.Its a house, the house where my life stopped living.Ella?I turn to face the lady whose voice saved me once.Oh hey, Mrs.Wilson.She hasnt changed since the day I met her.Her beautiful blonde hair sits neatly in a messy bun on her head.Her deep brown eyes always made me smile, and I couldnt help but smile right now.I rub my eyes, conscious of my unbidden tears.You okay sweetheart?She asks, curiosity on her mind.Yeah fine, sorry Im intruding.I say and turn to leave.Not at all, darling.I told you youre welcome to come around whenever you want.Always.She smiles so sweetly at me it almost makes me burst into tears.I miss this woman.Thanks, I whisper.I try my hardest to hide my emotions but I can't.There are just too many memories.Want a soda?She asks kindly, sweetly.I decide to take a chance and see the house one last time.Nothing else could hurt me today.Yeah sure, Ill be fine.Me too.Her face reminds me of him so much it hurts.I follow her into the beautiful white house.It still has its red shutters and a veranda that surrounds the entire house.It makes me sad to think that I once sat on one of the old armchairs, chatting away with my best friend.We walk inside and it's exactly how I remember.The walls are painted cream with portraits of family members scattered around.She leads me to the kitchen where the table that I used to have regular dinners still sat in its place.It is white pinewood and the chairs match.I couldn't help it; I ran my fingers along the edge.I pull out my usual chair and take a seat.I miss this house.I murmur.Im so sorry, I dont visit much.Ella, its fine, darling.I understand.She hands me a root beer and takes a seat next to me.She places her hand on mine and tilts her head to the side.I look down at my drink and cant hide how upset I am.Im sorry, Mrs.Wilson, there are too many memories here, but I do miss it so much, even if just to get away.Ella, angel, I told you, you are welcome whenever you like.You were the love of my boys life.Dont you ever forget that!She wipes her eyes and looks deep into mine.He loved you, Ella, we all love you, and you lit up our house on a cloudy day   You chased the rain away I smile at the familiar words created for me with this family.How is everyone?Alex, Georgie?I ask, trying to detour the conversation from sadness.Theyre fine, Ella.Alexandra has now gone to college to study psychology.Gee is at high school.How are you?She takes a long drink.Im okay, I wasnt, but I am now.I promise.I gave her a reassuring smile and nudged her arm with mine.I ought to get home.Thanks for the drink, Mrs.Wilson.Ill see you again soon?I won't, but a white lie will have to do.Sure, honey, there is some stuff we need to sort in Jamies room.Some stuff thats yours, and yknow, magical memories.Her eyes are so sad, so deeply wounded.Sure, Ill come round when I can.As I slowly shut the front door to the house with my childhood memories, I lean against it, break down, and sob to myself.******    I walk into my house a broken girl.My feelings had been pulled apart at the seams by three different people in just a few hours.I cant cope with any more distress, any more hurt.I just want to be alone.I drop my keys into the key bowl, and walk into the living room.I knew Luke was still here because his car was outside.As I walked in, he jumped to his feet and weirded me out.Lukes here to see you again.My moms voice made me feel safe, her words would always save me.He has no reason to be here.I don't look in his eyes.I cant.Im sure the whole room could see the distress on my face, the sadness and weakness.Ella, I need to talk to you.Can we please go talk?I shrug and turn to walk in the direction of my bedroom.I run up the two flights of stairs so that he didnt get a chance to check me out.I go into my bedroom, continue through to my bathroom, and lock the door.My back slides down the wooden white door and I softly weep into my hands.I hear him walk in and I hold my breath, gather my strength, and stand to my feet.Be brave Ella.Wont be but a second, Luke.Okay.His voice, as always, makes my body shudder in response.My hands are now on either side of my sink and I raise my head to look at my face.Miserable.Alone.Stressed.Depressed.Anxious.Nauseous.In love.No, Im not in love!I correct myself.I wipe the excess eyeliner from under my eyes and pull out my ponytail carefully, so as not to hurt myself.My hair falls gently around my shoulders so I ruffle it up a bit.I want to look hot but I know it will be just a wasted effort.I unlock the door, walk over slowly to my bed, and sit next to Luke   careful not to touch him.The electricity was back, pulling me back to him, as if he has some ruling power over me.Ella, whats happened?Why did you bail on me at school today?We were going to have a date tonight, I organized it.The hurt in his voice makes me feel so much guilt.If I'd gone with him, I wouldnt have seen Sarah.You made fun of me.I shrug.I was proving a point, Ella, to those jerks I call friends.I know, I realized that after, but I felt embarrassed, I wasnt up for PDA.PDA?His eyes lock with mine and I look down at my weaving fingers.Yeah, PDA, yknow, public displays of affection?I cant help but smile.Oh, I wasnt really going to, well, I did plan on kissing you.Ella, what you said on the phone, what did you mean?What have I done wrong?If that was what it was, the whole name teasing, I wasnt serious.He plays with his car keys, toying with them through his fingers.No, I know.I sigh with the knowledge of what I was told earlier that has made me break.I saw Sarah today. "He turns to look at me."She was horrible, Luke.Also, she told me some stuff about you and her.She told me you and her were still having sex.She told me that you were having sex last night  my bottom lip starts quivering with the realization that this could be true.When you came and got me from the lake.I put my head in my hands.
