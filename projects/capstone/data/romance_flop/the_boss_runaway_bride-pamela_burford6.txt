Was he the kind of guy to insist on a prenuptial agreement if he married a woman of significantly lesser means?Molly seemed to think so.The hell of it was, she was probably right.Even so, Quinn would never try to cheat his intended out of her fair share of the marital assets.Phil had freely invited Quinn to spend an entire month under the same roof with his wronged ex fiance.Hadnt he been concerned that theyd talk about him, that Quinn would learn what Phil had done to her?Probably not.Phil only knew him from the agency, after all, where Quinns demeanor had been all business.No doubt Phil assumed that the hard boiled corporate persona was an accurate reflection of the private manwhich, in the case of Phil himself, was obviously true.Then, too, having regaled Quinn with horror tales of his unprincipled ex, Phil must have counted on him giving Molly a wide berth.Which he had indeed made every attempt to do.Quinn wasnt proud of that.He asked, Phils got swell shoulders?Yours are sweller.Thank you.His BMWs bigger, though.More horsepower.More leather.Well, Phil and I might be two peas in a damn pod, Quinn said, but just for the record, Im appalled by the stunt he tried to pull on you.I cant believe you arent bitter.I mean out for blood, hell hath no fury bitter.Do you have any idea what Phils been saying about you, the vicious office gossip?I can imagine.Its not important.No one with half a brain and even the tiniest scrap of sensitivity would take Phils version of events at face value.Quinn tried not to squirm.Wasnt that precisely what hed done?And he hadnt even shown Molly the courtesy of listening to her explanation back when shed first tried to give it.His thoughts must have been evident.She reached across the table and squeezed his hand.I didnt mean you, Quinn.You didnt know me then.He shook his head in wonder.Youre too good, you know that?Too understanding, too...sweet.If it had been me, if someone had done to me what Phil did to you, Id take out a full page ad in the New York Times and share it with the world.No, Ive got it.An open letter in Advertising Today!She laughed.Remind me never to cross you.How can you not hold a grudge?She shrugged.Phil did what he had to do.What his guthis self preservation instincts, I guesstold him to do.Its how he got where he is today, owner of a multimillion dollar ad agency.Thats business!Thats not the way youre supposed to treat people you care about.She smiled knowingly.I thought it was all related.Isnt that what you said?Quinn slumped in his chair.Thats not what I meant.He runs his private life the way he runs his business.See, thats something I didnt realize before the wedding.There you go again, sounding so damn sanguine about the whole thing.She shrugged.Phil did what he had to do and I did what I had to do.No hard feelings.Bull.He made her meet his eyes.Youre hurt, Molly.You gonna try to deny it?No, she said quietly.But Ill get over it.Ive mostly put it behind me.I mean, whats the use of letting myself wallow in bitterness and hatred?That just eats you up from the inside.Then youre punishing yourself, not the person who hurt you.Please dont tell me youve forgiven him.Her beatific smile said it all.Oh, Molly, he groaned.Now, dont get yourself all worked up.Dont start doing my hating for me.Somebody had to do it!He debated with himself for a whole two seconds before blurting, You may not hold a grudge, but Phil sure does.She scraped her cake plate clean with her fork.I know.Hes saying terrible things about me.Hes doing more than that and youre letting him.Damn it, Molly!Her eyes widened at his harsh tone.What did I do?You cant really believe nine fifty a week is a bargain for this place?She stared unblinking and he saw his words register, saw the inevitable and unwelcome conclusion latch on with sharp little claws.Watching her expressive face, Quinn had to give Phils brother credit for trying, but no one was ever going to teach this woman to bluff.Quinns motives had been pure.If she was determined to play Saint Molly, the least he could do was arm her with all the facts.Thats what hed told himself, but what he saw on her face made him wish hed kept his mouth shut.She made a valiant effort to smile.Well.I guess I bungled that one, huh?Think hes having a good laugh right about now?Molly...Quinn said miserably.Im sorry, I shouldnt have  Dont be silly.Im glad you did.She sat up straighter, her dignified speech and posture at odds with the twin spots of color in her tanned cheeks, and a hard glitter in her eyes hed never seen before.Do you mind if I ask what youre paying?You started this, he chided himself.Why stop now when she has a scrap of self esteem left?Im...Im not paying anything, Molly.He, uh, offered me the place free.One delicate eyebrow lifted slightly as if this were of passing interest.He almost expected to hear, How nice for you.He made himself continue.I think hes charging you a couple of hundred a week more than he usually gets.Theres plenty of competition from places in a lot better shape.Thank you for telling me this, Quinn.Molly stood and quickly gathered the dishes, then carried them into the kitchen.He heard plates and flatware clatter into the sink, heard the faucet open full blast.Quinn cursed under his breath.Hed offer to pay her rent himself if he thought shed accept it.But the money itself wasnt the issue, he knew.He sat listening to the amplified scritch scritch scritch of the phonograph needle gnawing on vinyl until it finally dawned on him that the machine didnt know the music had ended.He went into the living room, switched it off, and lifted the record from the turntable.In the sudden quiet a soft sound came to his ears, barely audible.Muffled weeping.He tossed the record aside and hurried into the kitchen.Molly stood at the sink squirting an endless stream of liquid soap into the rising water.Quinn didnt think she was aware of the spuming foam threatening to overflow onto the floor.Her chin wobbled and tears welled in her eyes.He turned off the water and took the detergent bottle from her.He had to have the last laugh.She pounded the worn countertop with her fist.His first try at cheating me didnt work, so he had to have another stab at it.And I just let him because Im so ditsy!The tears spilled down her cheeks.Molly, youre not  Im a doormat!Even after what he tried to do, I trusted him.I mean, I walked right into it!She gestured wildly and shook off the comforting hand Quinn laid on her back.He said, If you were a doormat, you would have walked down the aisle with Phil because youd have been too timid or embarrassed to call it off at the last minute.If you trusted him about the rent, its because you see the good in people.And its that goodness you concentrate on, not the persons faults.You bring out the best in people, Molly.She leaned back against the refrigerator, hugging herself.Like I brought out the best in Phil?You cant bring out whats not there to begin with.Youre blaming yourself for this when you should be blaming him.Youre doing what you just talked aboutpunishing yourself instead of the person who hurt you.HeHe used to be so sweet, Quinn.When we were together.Devoted.I mean, I know now it was an act.Quinn edged closer and tipped her face up so shed be forced to see his sincerity.She tried to turn away, but he wouldnt let her.You saw the good in me, he said.You ignored my many loathsome faults and focused on my pitifully few virtues, and look at me now.He smiled down into her sullen, watery eyes.When that sun sets, Im the first guy on the beach and the last one to leave.King of the Cape, they call me.She pushed ineffectually at his chest.Youre just trying to make me feel better.Well, there you go!Could you see me doing that two weeks ago?He grabbed a paper napkin from the counter and blotted her tears.She took it from him, dabbed at her nose, and lobbed it into the corner garbage can.Her fragrance heightened his awareness of how close they stoodnot a store bought perfume but her own subtle, alluring scent.He ignored the cautionary voice inside his head and moved closer still, leaning both forearms on the refrigerator door to corral her.Molly glanced up into his eyes and he saw the answering awareness she couldnt hide, felt it reach deep inside and tug at the most primitive part of him.She averted her face.Her chest rose and fell in a quickened rhythm and he leaned into her until her soft breasts nudged him with each breath.Quinn lowered his mouth to her throat, seeking her pulse, the hot rush of life there.Her breath caught and her hands came up, fluttering, uncertain.To hold him or to push him away?Did she know?His lips nuzzled her.The breathless little sounds she made inflamed him.He felt her fighting it, felt her resisting this thing that had been brewing between them for nearly two weeks, and this excited him, challenged the primal male animal shed awakened.Molly...he breathed against her throat.She shuddered.His fingers were threaded into her hair, holding her, and he didnt know how theyd gotten there.He was acting on instinct and it felt damn good.His other hand caressed her waist, her hip, slowly, cajolingly.It glided up her rib cage.He heard and felt her soft, panting breaths, felt her rising excitement and perhaps a touch of panic.The heavy warmth of her breast nestled in the crook of his hand.His thumb lightly stroked the underswell.Her fingernails bit into his shoulders as she struggled to fend off not him, he sensed, but her own mounting desire.He sought the truth in her expressive face.Her eyes had that drowsy, needy look.Her mouth was slightly parted, her skin flushed.Quinn pounced in unthinking reflex, seizing her mouth in a hard kiss, crushing her against the refrigerator.This kiss was thorough, unashamedly possessive.It demanded a response.And still Molly held back.He intensified the siege, angling his head, shifting his body to fit her pliant curves.He nibbled at her closed lips, licked the seam.Molly, he whispered, stop fighting it, you wont win.He captured her buttocks and pulled her closer still.Her mouth opened on a gasp and he took advantage, plying her with short, coaxing strokes of his tongue, more a stealthy infiltration than an invasion.Quinn knew his patience had been rewarded when he heard her soft moan.She melted a little, opened to him, surrendering at last.Triumph surged hard and hot within him.His hands covered her breasts.Their stiff peaks teased his palms and he brushed them lightly, teasing her in return, inhaling the helpless whimpers that rose in her throat.He relinquished her mouth and gazed at her, the picture of earthy sensuality, panting softly, eyes half closed, nipples jutting under the flimsy fabric of her dress.In that instant his sanity hinged on getting her out of her clothes and into his bed.Now.His hand slid under the short hem of her skirt and up her thigh, which was even silkier than hed imagined.And hed imagined it a lot in the past twelve days.He nudged her legs apart with his knee and continued the exploration.While Molly eschewed a bra, she did, he now discovered, wear underpants.Practical cotton by the feel of them, but skimpy.Not much to them.His fingers slipped between her legs, probing, seeking, and he felt the melting heat of her passion right through the thin cotton.She stared up at him, dazed with that passion.Her trembling legs parted farther as if of their own volition.She whispered, Can we make it to your bedroom?Quinn pressed himself into the cradle of her hips so thered be no mistaking his state of readiness.Im thinking that countertop looks pretty good.She chuckled.Id say go for it, but something tells me you dont keep condoms in here with the Frosted Flakes.Red alert!his mind screamed.He forced himself to admit, Uh, Molly honey, I dont have any condoms.No distractionsthat was the whole idea of this trip, wasnt it?You dont pack Trojans when youre planning on no distractions.He said, I suppose its too much to hope you have some upstairs?She shook her head.And the drugstore was closed at that late hour.If there was one thing Quinn had learned in eight years in the ad business, it was how to salvage a foundering presentation.He said, You know, Ive recently discovered that I can be exceptionally imaginative.One might even say inventive.A slow smile touched her face.Is that so?Yes it is, and Id be privileged to demonstrate this newfound inventiveness, at no risk to you whatsoever.Molly wrapped her arms around his neck.Well.I must admit Im...intrigued.He lifted her by the hips and spun around to set her on the counter, shoving aside the cake plate and upsetting the sugar bowl.He kissed her hungrily and pushed up her dress.She wriggled to help him as he worked her underpants over her hips.Ive been trying not to let myself even think about you this way, she said.Me, too.He pulled the underpants down her legs and over her sandaled feet, and tossed them onto the toaster.But lets face it, Phil doesnt ever have to find out.Phil?What does this have to do with Phil?Quinn tried to part Mollys legs, but she locked her knees together.She pushed her skirt firmly into her lap and placed a staying hand on his shoulder when he went for another kiss.Quinn?Whats this about Phil?Only that we have to keep this from him.Come on, Molly, I dont have to spell it out for you, do I?Maybe you do.He backed off a little and studied her expression.Wariness had replaced the glaze of desire in her eyes.He said, Phil is a force to be reckoned with in my industry.You know that.
