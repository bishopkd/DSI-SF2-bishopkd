Relaxed.I love you, West, she says.And Christ, it feels good.It feels solid.Strong enough that we can build on it.Sweeter than I expected, because she hasnt said it in months.I hold my baby sister for a long time.You ever think about what I asked you?If you could do anything, be anybody, what you would want?Not really.I kiss the top of her cherry scented head.Say, Start.The package from my grandma shows up a few days into January.At first I think it was delayed by bad weather, but the postmark shows she didnt mail it until December 29.Inside, theres a backgammon set wrapped up for Frankie, a new afghan big enough to cover the back of the couch, and a lumpy envelope with my name on it.I slip the envelope into my pocket.Later, when Frankies gone dancing back to her room and Carolines talking to Paul on her headset, I put my boots on and take the letter out on the landing at the top of the stairs.I read it holding my breath.Dear West, Michelle showed me the book you sent her with your pictures in it.It looks like you and your sister are doing good.Im sending you my 5 yr.chip from AA.Im going to get my 10 yr.next month.I dont know what youd want with it, but its something Im proud of, like you are.I wish I could give you more.I never knew how to make things right with you.Your uncle Jack doesnt talk about the trial anymore.Stephanie says they got a letter from the lawyer saying hes given up the case so I guess thats over with.Write to me when you can and tell me how youre doing.Ill keep an eye on your mother.Love, Joan  It makes me fucking cry, that letter.I dont know why.Maybe because of the things that are so obvious, she doesnt even have to say them.That Im never going home again.I never had a home in the first place.My mother is a child, my family is a mess, and Im on my own.Joan wishes me well.After a minute, I dry my face.Look up at the sky.Inhale.Its one of those winter days that dont come often in Iowa, when the temperature drops so low that it hurts to breathe, but the sun comes out and the sky is thin blue, far away.The snow sparkles.The world blanketed in crystal.I pull my phone from my pocket and dial my mom.She picks up on the second ring.The conversation drifts for a while.The wind gusts up, lifting powdery surface snow and sending it whirling over the fields.I make the right noises at the right times and wait for the moment.Then I say it.I want permanent custody of Frankie.The sun ducks behind a cloud.My mom protests, argues with me, but I just brace myself there.Let the wind blow over me.Its no surprise when my mom finally asks, Youll still let me see her?Of course.Ill fly you out for the guardianship hearing, and you can stay awhile.Id like that.Then shes quiet, and Im quiet, too.I guess we both know what it means.I love you, West, she says.I say, I love you, too.Because its true.And because its kind.And because its over.Its a week into January when I go by the art building looking for Rikki.I want to talk to her about art therapy for Frankie.I dont know what art therapy costs, or even if its something that would do Franks any good, but Caroline pointed out that its helped her a lot to have a therapist to talk to since the thing with Nate, and maybe I shouldnt be so close minded about it.I shouldnt.Im trying not to be.Frankies still having nightmares, so theres plenty of room for improvement, and like Caroline says, its unlikely to hurt.Frankie will probably see it as art lessons from Rikki, which theyre already more or less doing every time she goes over to Rikkis place with the sketchbook I gave her for Christmas.I try Rikkis office, but shes not there, so I swing by the studio where she teaches her classes.I find her there with Raffe and Anniethe dude with the crazy hair from my Studio Art class and the tiny blonde he always hangs around with.Since I quit smoking and it started snowing all the time, I havent run into them as much as I used to, and it gives me a jolt to see them now during break.Makes me wonder what kind of families Raffe and Annie have got, that theyre here on campus in January hanging out in the art building.Theyre each bent over white forms on the table that look like ceramic ice cube trays.Rikki is tapping what looks like shiny white sand into one opening with the back of a spoon.The trick is to make sure you do not leave too much air in here, shes saying.Because then you will have bubbles, and the frit will not melt evenly.Raffe glances up.Leavitt, he says.Hey, Raffe.Annie acknowledges me with a dip of her eyelashes, which is all Ive ever managed to get out of Annie.Raffe, Ive talked to a few times, but only the kind of polite conversation that doesnt go anywhere.You done with that?Yeah, its all yours.Thanks.You here over break?I ask.Yeah.Were doing a January term independent thing with Rikki.What on?Frit casting.He wiggles his fingers like a magician.Its because of Rikki that Laurie is working in glass.He used to be satisfied making giant sculptures out of metal, but now hes got to have giant glass hammers, too, even though he wasnt kidding when he said the logistics are a fucking pain in the ass.A one to one casting of a glass hammer is a tough object to make, but not impossible.Multiply the scale by a thousand?Enormous fucking headache, because where are you going to get that much glass?How the fuck do you make the mold, and more to the point, wheres the kiln to fire a glass hammer the size of a car?This is the kind of stuff he pays me to try to figure out.Which, actually, I fucking love it.Best job Ive ever had.Did you need something?Rikki asks.I come back to myself, realize Im standing there staring at the molds piled with frit and daydreaming about work.Yeah.No.I mean, it can wait.I just wanted to talk to you about something, but youre busy.I can make some time if its important.Is it Frankie?Nah, just class stuff, I lie.Are you going to be in Lauries 3D Design in the spring?Raffe asks.No, I didnt sign up.How come?I shrug.Just didnt.Rikki gives me a look.What did you register for?A bio class, organic chemistry, an econ seminar, and an advanced statistics thing.Those are all sciences.Econ is a social science.Why do you need so much science?Its practical.She sniffs.Practical.You do not need more practical.You need more art.This is Rikkis shtick.I need more art.I need to learn to play.I need to let myself take up more space in the world.Ive heard it enough times now that I keep thinking itll stop digging into me, but it hasnt.Every time, I feel like shes scraping over something soft inside me.It makes me irritable.I think she knows it, too.I think thats why she does it.The thing is, I liked her class.It frustrated the hell out of me, but I liked it.I like working with Laurie.I even liked Russian history and Music in African American Lit and Spanish, but when it came time to register for the spring semester, I went with bio, chem, econ, and math because the scholarship Im on is worth more than fifty thousand dollars a year, and I dont know what I could do with art.Nothing, probably.I cant waste all that money on nothing.Rikkis watching me.Her hair is in pigtails.Shes got on a vest made of blue fur and underneath it a black long sleeve top made out of leather.She should be ridiculous, but instead she makes these crazy clothes look like what everybodys supposed to be wearing.She makes her life seem like a life anybody could have, and should, if thats what they want.I rub my hand across my throat.Too hot.What are you guys making?Raffe smiles.Were casting tiles for color samples.Annie, whered the book go?She hands it to him, and he shows me pages and pages of small glass tiles in a rainbow of colors.I ask a few questions, get some answers, ask a few more, and then were off talking about the technique and how it works, where it can go wrong, what might be a better way.Before I know it, Ive got a spoon in my hand that Im using to tamp down frit into the mold that was Rikkis.Its careful work, meticulous.Weighing out the components, adding the powder to the frit in tenths and hundredths of a gram.Ten grams in each opening.Tap tap tap.See, this is the kind of art I like, I say.How come?Raffe asks.Its technique.I like the technique stuff.Or when its a puzzle, when Laurie needs something and I have to figure out how to get some result that you want but it takes a lot of planning or science or knowledge about materials to make it happen.You work with Laurie?Raffe asks.Yeah, Im his assistant.Thats tight.It is.It would be perfect if it was a real job, you know, like, full time, if I could be an assistant to somebody like Laurie.But dont you want to make your own stuff?Annie asks.Shes got a tiny metal funnel out, and shes using it to add red pigment to a cup of frit sitting on top of a scale.Its on the tip of my tongue to say Im not creative that way, but I dont.I stop.Because Im trying to notice, these days, when Im making shit harder than it has to be.Im trying to notice when theres something I want and Im throwing obstacles up in front of it for no reason at all.What I notice right now is that I was comfortable a few seconds ago, but Ive started sweating, and I feel kind ofI dont know, furtive.Like Im checking out porn on the Internet when Carolines in the other roomnot that Id ever do that, but its that kind of forbidden feeling, as if Im going to get caught talking about something I shouldnt.The thing I shouldnt be talking about is art.And what I say, when I open my mouth, is, How do you know?How is thatHow do you convince people its okay for you to be doing this stuff?Raffe exhales a laugh.Who, like parents?No, not parents.Yourself.Because thats what I mean.How do I convince myself that its okay to take art classes?How do I make myself get out of my own fucking way?I drop the spoon in my hand and say, Its like Well, take electives.You have to have so many classes for your major, whatever that is Art, Raffe says.Annie nods.Art.Okay, but pretend its not art and you have to take bio classes, so you take those, one or two a semester, but youve got all these electives.So how do you decide what to take?Whatever looks interesting, Raffe says.Or if Ive heard its really great, Annie says, like Gender and Womens Studies with Professor Gates.Okay, well, what I do is think about work.I think whats going to be most useful to get a job that pays well.Whats going to mean Im in a position to make the most out of college.So howd you end up in Studio Art?Raffe asks.Fluke.Huh.It seems like a good fit.I got a B .Rikkis a hard grader.I look around, because hes talking about her like shes not here, and I realize shes not.She must have slipped out when I wasnt paying attention.You know that assignment with the still life, and we were supposed to paint the apple?I ask.My apple looked like it belonged in a childrens book.This dipshit next to me, he never seemed to have the first fucking clue what was going onswam through the whole semester in a dazeand then he paints this apple with, like, black and purple and blue and yellow and pink and white on his brush.No red at all.But when hes done, it looks exactly like an apple.Wait, is this Kyle?Raffe asks.Is that his name?Skinny kid, always made Rikki repeat the demonstrations?Yeah, him.Hes fucking gifted with colors, man.Thats what Im saying.So Kyle is creative.He should make art.But meI dont want to be dicking around, wasting money on four credits when Im not going to get anything out of it.Sounds like you got a job out of it, Annie points out.That was a fluke.Lot of flukes in this story, she says mildly.You know how I got into art?How?I took a class in high school, started messing around with drawing and painting and sculpture.When the bell rang, I never wanted to leave.Same for me, Raffe says, except it was here.First art class, and I was in the studio all the time.Id forget to eat.Skipped meals, skipped parties, so I could be here doing this.Me and Anniethats how we met.But dont you worry what youre going to do with it?Rikki and Laurie seem to be surviving all right, Raffe says.But not everybodys as lucky or as talented as Rikki and Laurie.You could crash and burn, and then whered you be?Raffe says, Id be a guy with a bachelors from Putnam who knows how to work hard on something thats important to me, and who knows how to take something Im passionate about and try to realize it, and how to communicate that passion to the rest of the world.Thats not, like, wasted time.And even if it was, Im not sure I care.He picks up a plastic tub full of frit and powder and starts shaking it to mix the color in.Plus, dude, youre what, twenty?Twenty one.So, youre twenty one.Youre allowed to fuck around and experiment with stuff.Im pretty sure its the point of being twenty one.Its not like you can only ever have one career, Annie says.You can make art and teach school, and if you hate teaching school you can run a gas station, and if you hate running a gas station you could try your hand at embalming dead bodies, and the whole time youre making things, if that feels good.Embalming dead bodies?I ask.Just as an example.Raffe finishes shaking his frit and sets the container down on the table.For what its worth, Leavitt, youve got talent.Its just not the same as Kyles.Hes got an eye for color.Youre precise, and you see things from more than one angle.Youre good at solving problems, because youre fucking persistent.I could see all that just taking a class with you, and I know Im not wrong because Laurie hired you, which he wouldnt have done if he didnt think you had something.He didnt hire me, Annie says.I applied.He didnt hire Josh, either, Raffe says.Or Macon.I didnt even know you were in the running for that job.I wasnt, I admit.I didnt know there was a job in the first place.He just offered it to me.There you go.There I go.And actually, I feel like Im moving.Like Ive taken a step to the left and cleared a path that was blocked.Ive got a sketchbook at home full of ideas for shit that I would build or make or do if I had unlimited time and supplies.A sketchbook Ive never showed anybodynot even Carolinebecause its scarier than it should be to step away from what I know is practical in favor of what might turn out to be impractical but fucking pleasurable.My sister keeps drawing these grid drawings, one after another, like she cant stop.Theyre all she wants to do.But she keeps telling me theyre not real art, even as she gets better and better at them.My grandma Joan has a houseful of blankets shes knit.She makes them without patterns, and theyre fucking impressive, but if you ask her anything about them shell tell you she just does it for her arthritis.Not because it feeds something in her to make beautiful things.I dont know if what I want to make would come out beautiful, but fuck, Ive got things I want to try just for the sake of trying it, glass I want to melt and metal I want to cut up and this idea I had for if you could take a tree and cut it into slices and suspend them, somehow, vertically, so you could see what the tree looked like when it was alive the same time you could see inside the tree and read the story of its life.I dont know if thats art.I guess it is if I say it is.If it makes people feel or think when they look at it.I dont know if it would be good art.Could be its just playing.But giving myself a chance to figure it outthats what I want.Thats what I want for me, and thats what I want for Frankie, tooto be able to see me doing that, so she knows its okay if she wants to do it herself.Im starting to see that if I get what I need, Frankies going to get what she needs, too.That whats good for me and whats good for Caroline is whats good for my sister.Whered Rikki go?I ask.Back to her office, Annie says.I check the clock and Im surprised to see its seventy five minutes since I got here.I was supposed to be stopping for a minute.Ive got to get dinner sorted out.But its late enough now that Carolines probably fed Frankie.Id better head out, I say.Thanks for showing me this stuff.You want to grab dinner?Raffe asks.Annie and I were going to go into town for subs.Thanks, but I cant.Oh.Okay.Im reminded of that day with Krishna, when he came up to me outside the art building and harassed me into coming over for dinner.Hes back in Chicago for the break.I think tonight Ill give him a call.Would you guys want to come out to my place?I ask.Not tonight, because I dont know what Carolines got going on, but I dont know, tomorrow?Day after?I have to warn you Ive got a kid sister living with me, so if youre not into kids I trail off.I guess what Im saying is, Ive got some baggage.I live off campus with my girlfriend and my little sister.I dont really know how to have friends, and I can be a grouchy fucker if things arent going my way, but Id like to talk about art with you.Both of you.It takes a year, waiting for their reply, and I age a decade.Kids are good, Annie says.Is there anything we should bring?Raffe asks.Its that easy.Just that fucking easy.Spring comes late in Iowa, but that year was an exception.The December snow gave way to a frozen January, clear and blue, everything crystalline and sparkling.Wests eyes under that sky were all fire and ice.His hands were cold when they moved beneath my jacket over warm skin, and I would shriek, but I loved the shock of it.The shock of having him.Keeping him.How that could become normalhow it could fall into a rhythm of busy days and familiar nights, but still surprise me into gratitude over and over again.February was projects and papers, phone calls and television interviews.It was waking up early to drive to the Quad Cities for hair and makeup so I could film something for the morning news.Seeing my name in the Des Moines Register, sitting in a hotel conference room and answering questions for eight state senators, none of whom implied I was a slut.All of whom shook my hand and thanked me for my service to the citizens of Iowa.February was reading about nonprofits, political action groups, and campus organizations.Talking to activists.Thinking about guest speakers.Planning for a future with no walls on any horizon.February was Frankie making friends with a girl named Nadine and bringing her home to play once, then a second time, then as many nights as the two of them could get away with it.It was Quinn back from Florence and me making time to see all her pictures and hear about her Italian escapades.It was me making time for Bridget, too, to listen to how things were going with Krishna and give her advice she didnt need because actually, it turned out, things were going pretty well.It was the beginning of art therapy for Frankie, her nightmares easing up, my insomnia getting a little bit less intense.February was West at the studio or out in Lauries shop.West talking about Raffe and Annie, West telling me what he was making, what he would try next, what hed failed at but he had an idea, he had another idea, he had a new idea.I gained ten pounds in February.Then it was March, and it rained so much that the world turned brown and squelching.The snow melted away.The rug inside the front door developed a crust of mud.We had to leave our shoes on garbage bags to keep flakes of dirt from falling off us everywhere we walked.Spring break marked a year since West left Putnam for Oregon.We gave Frankie over to the Collinses and drove to Iowa City for dinner, just the two of us.Appetizers and main courses and dessert over a flickering candle, plates passed back and forth across the table, more to talk about than we could ever say.I laughed a lot at that dinner, because my life was so full it spilled over.West pulled me close in the truck, kissed me with the rain pounding onto the roof and the windows until I was breathless and laughing all over again.And then there were crocuses.April brought sunshine, the world drying out, the first questing blades of grass pushing through the earth.Rugby practices to plan.A rally to organize.Every day, some contact to be made, some reporter to talk to, some new thing to pursue.This was how it would be.It was how we would be, always.This full of change.This full of life.Spilling over into words and laughter, cold hands and hot mouths, and the sound of rain drumming down.The lawyers office is cold.Outdoors, the temperature is exactly perfect.Sixty four degrees and sunny, which is unheard of for April in Iowa, so that all anyone wants to chitchat about is Gulf currents and global warming.At Putnam, its one of those afternoons when the entirety of the winter pale student body emerges blinking from their dorm rooms and spreads out blankets on the lawn of the quad.Boys strip off their shirts and toss Frisbees.Girls hold their textbooks, their chem noteswhatever props they requirewhen really theyre out there to watch the flesh parade.Im sitting at a conference table with the lawyer and my dad on one side of me, West and Frankie on the other.Across the gleaming cherrywood surface, Nate is flanked by his lawyer and both of his parents.This isnt how its normally done.My father made that abundantly clear.Its not normal to insist on signing the papers in front of the person youve accused.Its not normal to bring your boyfriend with you, or to invite along a girl too young to fully understand what it is shes being asked to witness.Settlements dont usually take fifteen weeks to negotiate, either, I told my dad, but I let you have your way.Give me this.The document is nothing.I dont know why I expected a sheaf of pages, binder clipped together, covered in tape flags, when Ive been part of hammering out every single one of these terms.I guess we expect the turning points in our lives to be plastered in flags and warning signs when, in fact, most of the time our lives change when were not paying attention.We blow past the markers without even seeing them, and then we come to the end of some path and find theres no label for it at all.No guardrail.No dead end sign.Just six pages and fifteen paragraphs, with a blank line at the end where I sign my name.Initial here, the lawyer says, so I do that, and I watch him shove the sheets across the table to Nate.The man holding a pen across from me isnt anyone I know.I broke up with him before the start of our sophomore year.Now were coming up on the end of junior year, and weve slipped past estranged to the other side of it.Were strangers.His father slides the pages from under his hand to read them through before Nate can sign, leaving Nate with his hand wrapped around a pen and nothing to do while he waits in the cold and embarrassed silence of the conference room.Nothing to look at but me.We stare at each other.Hes a young man with sandy hair, blond at the tips, and a scruffy not quite beard framing padded cheeks and bright blue eyes.He wears a dress shirt and tie.Slacks.He wears his privilege in his clothes and his sour expression, as though hes been asked here for no reason, harassed to the limits of his tolerance, and now this.This requirement that he look me in the eye.This distasteful performance Ive staged.When his father puts the sheets down in front of him, Nate signs on the last page, initials where hes told to, and shoves the document across the table toward me.I hope youre happy, he says.And there is this moment when any number of things could happen.West could leap across the table and deck him.I could ask to be left alone with Nate and take one last opportunity to give him a piece of my mind before the settlement kicks in and Im legally obliged to avoid contact with him forever.I thought I would do that.Fantasized about it.I imagined what I would tell him, what words would sink right into the heart of him and make him see what hed done, why its wrong, why it devastated me.I had a whole speech.But this isnt my life here in this conference room thats cold as a tomb.Everyone is dressed for a funeral because this is the end of somethingthe final act of a drama thats been difficult and hurtful, complicated and rich.A drama thats taught me more about myself than anything I went through in the years preceding it.What Nate did to me will never go away.I will never stop being angry, because it will never stop rearing up to hurt me.He lashed out at me, attacked me with the weapons at his disposal, and changed the contours of who I am forever.He changed my future.He made everything harder.But God.Here I am with West and Frankie and my dadthese people I love more than anything.And after I walk out of this room, Im going to get into Wests car and roll down the window and stick my hand out to feel the spring air sliding through my fingers.Were going to drive down the interstate at seventy miles an hour, and all of this will slip away.Back in Putnam, Ill change into shorts and find a blanket, drive over to campus, plant myself on the lawn, and pretend to study while I watch the boys playing Frisbee with their shirts off.Im going to head home and eat dinner with West and his sister.Im going to talk to her about why we took her out of school to be here today, what it means for my life and my future, what it means for hers.What it is to be a woman in this world.After she goes to sleep, Im going to lock the bedroom door and strip down to nothing and press every inch of my body against West, my boyfriend, my guy, the love of my life.Im going to fuck him, be fucked by him, slide against him in the glow of the bedside lamp, kiss him and pant in his ear and tell him I love him, I love him, Jesus God I love him.All of that belongs to me.Nate cant take it away.I hope youre happythats his accusation.It turns out that I only have one thing I want to say in response.Two words.I am.Dude, that is fucking creepy.Its not creepy, its evocative.It makes my balls shrivel up.Thats not my problem.No, it is, though.You made it.You made this thing that shrivels my balls, so youve got to own it.Can you stop talking about balls?Balls are objectively relevant to the conversation.Ball conversations are exclusionary.Pick a different metaphor.The art building has long hallways, and at night when its mostly deserted, they amplify every sound.I came in the door nearest the library, which means I can hear this whole conversation as I walk the span of the building.The building is plenty long enough to figure out whos talking to who.West is the one who keeps referring to his balls.Annies the one who doesnt want to hear it.And Raffe, I discover as I turn into the studio and get a look at what theyre discussing, is the one whos created the strangest piece of mixed media art Ive ever seen.Its a metal folding chair tipped over.On the floor, stuck beneath the seat, is a small cloth doll dressed up like an adult man.It has a miniature red wig, a little suit, and shoes.But rather than a dolls face, it has a human face, projected onto it with a camera.Moving human features.Its talking.That is fucking creepy, I say.They all three turn.West is already grinning.See, he says.I told you.You made that on purpose?I ask.Raffe smiles.If he were wearing overalls, hed stick his thumbs under the straps and rock back and forth on his heelshe looks that proud.Yep.Why?Annie groans.Dont ask him why.But Then West is beside me, dragging me across the room by the elbow.Never mind Raffe, he says.Look at this.Theres a smear of something dark on his cheekbone.His T shirt is spattered with white spots that I would swear werent there when he left the apartment this morning.Hes wearing the jeans he wears for art stuff, the denim almost impossible to spot under a layer of paint and slip and grease and I dont even know what.Those jeans turn my crank so hard.So hard.Seriously, he cant ever be allowed to know.Hell hold it over me with his knowing smirks and bossy teasing.To conceal my lust, I only allow myself quick sidelong glances at his thighs, where hes rubbed every possible art substance off his hands.The marks of all the projects that have engaged him this semester.There are so many of them.I think if he were anyone but West, I might be worried that all the projects were a sign of some kind of manic disorder, but I know him too well to worry.I know what it means when West sits me down and says, Close your eyes, and starts rustling around in one of the cabinets built into the rooms walls.It means hes found something hes excited about.It means hes got something he wants to show me.It means hes finally figuring out how to let himself try stuff, make mistakes, waste materials, fail.Ive never seen him so happy.He slides his sketchbook across the table in front of me, flipped open to a page about halfway through.Look at that, he says.I see what looks like an exploded diagram of a tree.Trunk, roots, branches, all of them separated out with space between them, floating in the air.It isnt a picture that makes sense to me, and it makes less sense when West starts piling tree parts and metal rods on the table in front of me.Hes assembling the pieces, telling me about drill bits and cutting tools and how he tried Lucite but it was too obvious, and then he started thinking about copper pipe, the kind of fittings you use for doing plumbing, and how that would look if he fitted the pieces together that way, and Laurie suggested he look into the kind of piping that chemists use, the old fashioned systems, because they have a kind of elegance, so he did some research on that He talks and talks, the words rushing out of him, and the whole time hes moving.Shifting from foot to foot, reaching up to fit one piece of pipe onto another, threading fittings together.I have this thing for the way West moves.Its worse than the jeans thing.Especially worse because he knows about it.When West is working, and happy, he gets into this physical kind of flow that unhinges the door on my libido and just lets everything out.I watch the muscles beneath his skin bunch and release.I watch his thighs in those jeans, his ass, his shoulders.Mostly, though, I watch his mouth, because I love to see him animated, love it when hes got this much to say about something that makes him happy.And because its always his mouth for me.That mouth, and the way he moves, and the way he is, soWest.Even more West than he used to be.More West every day.What do you think?he asks.Hmm?He cocks his head.You werent listening to me.I was.His eyes narrow, and one corner of his mouth tips up.You werent.Youve got that look.I dont.I deny it even as Im widening my legs in the chair.Leaning into the table with both elbows and arching my back just a little bit because it tilts my hips up and tilting my hips feels good.Tilting my hips feels positively necessary.He hops up on the tabletop, putting his jeans clad thighs directly in front of my face.Raffe and Annie arent paying attention.West lowers his head toward me, drops his voice, and says, What was I telling you about, Caro?Copper pipes.That was a while ago.Threading tools.Getting warmer.Adhesives.He leans down and brushes his lips over my forehead.Lucky guess.Im always talking about adhesives.The way he says it, it sounds like hes telling me he wants to lick my pussy.It sends a shiver racing down my back that tightens my nipples, liquefies my low belly, and lands between my legs with a wet kiss.West gives me a wide, dirty smile.What brought you over here anyway?I thought you were working on that paper.I was, but I got bored.Alone on the fourth floor of the library, my mind wandered, and its always dangerous to let my mind wander up there, because theres too much West and Caroline history for my mind to get lost in.Distracting history.The kind that makes it easy to convince myself I should take a break and come see how Wests project is coming along.Just in case hes bored, too.West never gets bored when hes working in the studio.He is, however, usually receptive to taking a certain type of break.Your sisters at Nadines for the night, I say.His smirk widens, that wolfish gleam in his eyes intensifying.I know.So I was thinking.Im tracing a pattern on his thigh with one finger.What were you thinking?Maybe we should do something we couldnt normally do.Instead of just spend the whole evening apart, working.You want to head over to the Union?he asks.Grab a slice of pizza?Im not sure Im hungry for pizza.What are you hungry for?I fold my arms over his thighs, because it gives me an excuse to grope them.Hes leaning in so close, our noses almost touch.Im not sure.Nothing sounds good.I bet I could change your mind.I should probably get back to the library.Ill walk you.He jumps down, roots around in his bag, and comes up with something closed in his fist that he pushes into his pocket.Im gonna walk Caro to the library, he says casually.Back in a few.Sure, Raffe says.Thats completely plausible.If a few turns out to mean an hour and we bail, you want us to put your stuff away?Yeah, West says.Thanks.He pushes me out the door with his hand on the small of my back.We near the staircase at the end of the hall.Where are we going?Up, he says.Ladies first.I climb, thinking well go to the second floor, where there are empty music classrooms.But when we get there, West slips his hand between my thighs, cups my pussy, and says, Keep going.I climb some more.Throbbing.Whats on the third floor?Offices, I think.Does he have a key to an office?Or maybe well end up in one of the bathrooms, locked in a stallnot sanitary, but hes got his hands all over my ass and Im breathing so fast, way too excited to care where we end up as long as its somewhere, soon.The landing.Which way?His hand on me again, the ridge at the base of his thumb drawing a line of pressure back and forth along my slit.Every muscle in my legs melts.Keep going.That isnt possible.He squeezes, and I close my eyes against the hot slick pulse of it.Up.I stagger upward.At the top of a short flight, I stumble into a door.West dangles a key in front of my nose.The roof?I ask.He spins me, presses me into the door, and kisses me so deeply, with so little warning, I just about black out.Can you faint from the combination of three and a half flights of stairs and the deep and unrelenting desire to be fucked?It seems likely.His thigh moves between my knees.His hands grip my waist and lift me up, and I cant do anything but dissolve all over him, take his mouth and his grip and his hard heat, the beat of the pulse in his neck where my hand rests, the moan he makes when I find his cock through denim and cotton and rub my hand up and down, tracing the length and shape of him with my fingernail.Right here, I say.Please.No.Please.He lowers me and backs away.On the roof.Open the door, then.He pushes me aside, unlocks it, and drags me behind him.Why do you have a key?I ask.Its Lauries master key.They give out master keys to the art building?Thats not smart.Thats just basically asking students to fuck on the roof.I know, right?Open season.Im surprised there arent twenty people up here right now.He turns and grins at me, and then we round a corner and he says, There we go.What is this?Grass.Right, but Im looking at a patch of lawn, about fifteen feet square.Like, justGrass.On the roof of the art building.Is this somebodys project?It was some kind of prairie restoration experiment thing, I think, he says.But that was a long time ago, and now its just this rooftop lawn that Rikki mows.Why?Because shes Rikki.Strip.Out here?I want you naked in that grass in thirty seconds.Ill make it worth your while.But what if theres ticks?How could there possibly be ticks?How should I know?Its not like theres deer up here, Caro.Or foxes, or any other kind of host animal.Were a host animal.I dont think theres that many people fucking on this rooftop that they could be passing ticks back and forth.But Quit.But He blows out an exasperated breath and whips his shirt off.The moonlight spills over his shoulders and chest, turning his skin a milky white blue, gooseflesh and hard muscle.Naked West chest and those jeans.Those fucking jeans.When his hands go to his zipper I reach for it, because I want in on this.So much.West pushes my hands away.Strip.All right.He finishes before I do, which means I push my skirt down with his gaze on me.Im standing in my bra and panties, a little chilly, a lot turned on.Come over here, I beg.Lie down.By myself?On the grass.This is strange.Humor me.I do as he asks, because it is a little strange, but not so strange that its outside my comfort zone, and West doesnt make so many unusual requests that I have any reason to balk at this one.Mostly he just loves me and supports me, bolsters my confidence when I need it, defends me, makes me laugh, makes me come, makes me happier than anyone else ever has or probably ever will.So, sure.Ill lie down naked in this random patch of roof grass for him.Its stiffer than I expected, prickly against my lower back, my neck.Cool on the back of my legs and my butt.He kneels beside me.Is this going to turn out to be a kink of yours?I ask.Exposure?He shakes his head.Rooftops?No.Hes smiling.Ive just wanted you naked under the stars since the first time I kissed you.He trails his hand from my neck down through the space between my breasts, almost but not quite brushing my nipples, then lifting every downy hair on my stomach as he strokes his way downward.Back and forth.Teasing me.I close my eyes.Its too much to look at him.The intensity in his gaze.The moonlight on his skin.He drops down to his elbow, and his face is right there, his eyes and his lips, his chin and his jaw, his mouth.So exactly like it was that night when we climbed up on the roof of my childhood home, even though almost everything is different now.That night, I was stoned and I was scared.I heard mean voices when I closed my eyes, hounding me, and I couldnt decide what to do about West because I wanted him, but I didnt want to get hurt.Id looked and looked at him that night, because I could never get enough of his face, the shapes that make him up, the beat of his heart, the heat of the life moving inside him.Come here, I say.He leans down to kiss me.Shifts closer and warms me as his hand travels those last few inches and his fingers slide in.Youre wet.No kidding.Watch it, he says.Or I might figure out youre attracted to me.Oh, its not you.I was just hoping thered be somebody up here who was willing to fuck me.Somebody who doesnt mind bossy chicks.Dont call me a chick.He rubs his thumb over my clit and makes me gasp.Mumbles something that sounds a lot like, Ill call you whatever I want.Be careful, I tell him the next time Im capable of drawing breath.Or Ill pick someone else to be my first lady.I guess thats all the provocation he can take, because what he says next is, Spread your legs wider, and then hes moving inside me, hard and harder.Fast, with his fingers sinking into the flesh at my hips.Wow.Breathless, I say, You werent kidding about wanting this.I was thinking about coming over to see you at the library.For how long?Since lunch.I laugh, and then I cant, because hes thrusting into me so hard that my whole body turns into a bow, arching up, tensing, tight.My mouth falls open.West kisses my neck, my jawline, my throat.The world smells green and new.I close my eyes, and when I open them, the stars are a careless spill of diamonds decorating the night.His thumb finds my clit and moves in slow circles in time with his thrusts.Into me.Into me.Into me.He eases his hand over my shoulder and down my arm, over my hip.Pulls up my knee.Looks in my eyes.We go deep and then deeper, falling, spinning.When hes with me, Im never lost.There are few things in life as fantastic as tackling another human being.Like, at the top of my list of physically enjoyable things I want to be doing as much as possible, its basically orgasms and tackling people.And sometimes I think tackling people is better, although Ill admit it also comes with a higher likelihood of getting kicked in the face.The first time I brought down another woman on the rugby pitch, I felt like Id cracked a code.Stolen a secret men had been keeping from me.Because the thing is, guys make it seem difficult, as though tackling requires either blind rage or shoulder pads to be even doable.We women watch from the stands, sipping hot chocolate high in the bleachers, and there is never any suggestion that this activity might be for us.That we might have what it takes to get this job done, too.I used to be a good girl.I sat in the stands.I followed the rules, worked hard to get straight As, dated a nice boy, and made him wait a long time for sex.It wasnt what I wanted, but it was in the right neighborhood, and it seemed like the thing at the time.There is a way in which smart girls, good girls, grow up thinking that if we keep following the rules, the world will hand us what we want.So we line up, and we wait.But no one ever shows up to deliver the goods.And the longer we wait in that line, the more likely we are to take receipt of one ration of shit after another.Being a good girl didnt work out for me.At the end of my junior year at Putnam, Im not that girl anymore.Ive stepped out of the line.Ive become someone else.I am engaged, every day, in the process of becoming myself, and one of the things I understand now that I didnt used to is that every possible activity is for me.Anything and everything I might want is available to me if Im willing to do what it takes to claim it.Sometimes it will be fucking unpleasant.Sometimes people will hate me for it.Thats okay.Its okay, because on a Sunday morning in April on the Putnam College rugby pitch, I can feel the softness of the earth beneath my cleats.I can smell manure, sharp and sweet, in the wind that whips the hair out of my ponytail.I can look to the sidelines and see Krishna and Frankie and West sitting on a blanket.The white of Krishnas smile.The light in Frankies face when Krishna teases her and West ruffles her hair, tickles her until shes collapsed, laughing, over his legs.I can look to my right and see my friend Quinn, big and solid, wickedly funny.I can look to my left and see my friend Bridget, slight and freckled and redheaded, nervous because this is the first time weve managed to get her out on the pitch to give rugby a try.I told her not to sweat it.Tackling another human being is easy.All it requires is a willingness to throw yourself at their legs and a complete refusal to let go.Thats it.Swear to God.Im not big, and Im not strong, but I could bring down a three hundred pound woman through the sheer force of my will.I could bring down a fucking elephant.Facing off across the line from us is a team of strangers in red and black jerseys, stern mouths and ruddy cheeks and wind whipped hair, and theyre going to do this, too.Were all going to do this.Were going to throw the ball, catch it, and run as fast as our legs will carry us.Were going to get a bead on the carrier, sprint after her, launch ourselves through the air until shes down and were breathless, sweating, tangled up in limbs and dirt, grass stains and grit.I have what it takes to claim what I want.I always did.All of us do.Thats what I tell West when he loses faith.Thats what Im always going to be here to tell him.Its what Ill tell Frankie when she asks me, when she doubts herself, when she needs to hear it.It doesnt take anything special to fight back against the world and all the ways it wants to box you in, hold you down, limit you, and keep you from thriving.You just have to know what it is you want to accomplish.You have to know who you want to be with and what youll give up to get them.You have to let yourself want what you want as hard as you can, as deep as that goes, even if it scares the fuck out of you.Even if your want and your need are bottomless, timeless, and your fear is so big that its hard to breathe around it.Because in the end, fear doesnt matter.Pain doesnt matter.You get kicked in the nose, and the disaster of the blow blooms across your face and screams through your nervous system, but then its over.Its over, and youre on the the other side, one blow closer to the life you want.Ive got my life locked in.Im right in the middle of it, my friends around me, West on the sidelines, our unconventional little family together and happy.Ive got that because I went after it.I chased it and jumped it and fucking wrestled it to the ground, and I am not ever letting go.Ahead of me is all the work I can do in this world.Im not afraid.Ive got this.West I dont know why we werent doing this last year, Krishna says.I dont know why I havent been doing this every single second since I came to college.Were sitting in the grass on the sidelines, passing Krishnas flask back and forth, sipping whiskey and watching muddy girls bruise one another.Frankies twenty feet down the sideline, worshipping Quinn, whos taking a breather after playing the entire first half of the game.Or first quarter.Ive got no fucking clue, actually, how this game works, but Krish has got a point.There are thirty college girls on the field flinging themselves around, and its pretty much the best thing thats ever happened.I dont know how you kept this from me, he says.You had to know I would kill to spectate this sport.Im going to spectate the fuck out of it now.They wont know what to do with me, Ill be spectating them so hard.This is the first game Ive made it to.The fuck?I always had work.He blows out an incredulous exhale.And I always said, Work less.Youre only young once.You also said a lot of other stupid bullshit.Including Dont tie yourself down to one chick.I watch him scan the field until he locks on Bridget.Shes got to be the scrappiest, tiniest, muddiest thing out there, but shes hanging in.I watch her fling her arm around Carolines neck, attempt a chest bump, and fall down on her ass.Then Carolines sinking to her knees, down to her hands, her hair hanging down in the dirt, because shes laughing so goddamn hard, she cant keep herself up.I was missing this.I cant believe I let myself miss this.Cant believe I got here, that I get to have it now.Were thriving.All three of us.Not just survivingthriving.And seeing that, I think about Silt.How I went home thinking I would never lay eyes on Caroline again.How I thought nothing could be harder than walking away from her, but it was.Hard.Harder.Too hard to take.I went home thinking I was the sheriff, and my fight was with my dad.But the fight I got wasnt the one I expected.The gunplay all happened on someone elses watch.I ended up alone on the streets of a ghost town in full daylight, with the black borders closing in on me.Carolines the one who pulled me out through that pinhole, back into the light.Its always been Caroline, because from that first day when she groped me at the library, rode my thigh, and then told me to leave her aloneas if that was a thing that could ever happenshe saw me in a way Id never seen myself.She knows who she is.She knows who I am.How we fit.Ive been a lot of things since I met her.Guide, villain, pioneer, exile.But Ive never been the sheriff, because I didnt understand what it takes.The sheriff isnt there to vanquish evil.Hes there to keep an eye on the future.Hes the guardian of the law, the protector of the rules, the fists that keep chaos at bay.You cant be the sheriff if all youve got is someone to fight against.Youve got to have something to fight for.Something like Frankie with Quinn on the sidelines of a rugby game.My sister in jeans and a hoodie that actually fits, her hands in her back pockets, talking and smiling and squinting into the sun.Something like Caroline rolling over onto her back, flinging out her arms, laughing up at the sky.A sketchbook full of ideas.A pile of copper tubing.A plan.All of it easy.All of it mine.
