He narrowed his gaze as the guard drew closer, making a wide circle around the back of the house.If he saw Lucas, then he might get an opportunity to alert others before Lucas could neutralize him.Lucas stopped breathing, hoping, praying he wouldnt be seen.Crouching for attack, he waited until the man had his back to him; then he sprang.It took less than five seconds to get the man in a sleeper hold and render him unconscious.As he fell to the ground, Lucas quickly taped his mouth closed and tied his hands and legs, then dragged him away from the house and into the field beyond.Moments later he sprinted back and once again eyed the house.Now to find a way inside, he thought.His mission mode calm slipped away as he thought of Julie, and prayed that they would get to her in time.JULIE LAY IN BED in the darkened room, sleep the furthest thing from her mind.Tonight was her last night on earth.Robert had told her when hed left her room earlier that tomorrow she would be undergoing a cesarean section.She knew that they would take her baby and she would die.There was no way they could allow her to live.She was a loose end, a liability in their crazy plan.She closed her eyes and rubbed her tummy.Robert would raise her son as his own, and groom him to usher a congregation from a good, religious group to a dangerous, powerful cult.When Robert had first told her his plan, shed asked why it had to be her baby.Hed told her it was the bloodline that mattered.If anyone in the congregation questioned that the child wasnt of his own bloodline then hed have DNA proof.Hed promised his congregation a child of his blood, and a nephew would fit the bill just fine.With the hours that shed had to think, shed realized that it was possible that Robert had killed his brother, her husband.Robert had known Julie was leaving David and that shed just discovered she was pregnant at the time of Davids death.It was possible hed feared that shed leave David and disappear into another life with her son.And Robert wanted her child.If what she believed was true, then Robert had taken a gamble.Hed wanted a child of his blood to fill the position of the son hed never had.Julie and Davids baby fit the bill.Still, if hed killed David and shed miscarried, he would never have gained the child he desperately wantedneededto complete his plan.None of that mattered now.It was over.Robert was going to succeed and she was going to die.At least her regrets were few.Although the pain of knowing she would never see her son, never hold his sweetness in her arms and watch him grow into a man, was too hard to bear, in every other area of her life there werent many things she regretted.Shed loved.A vision of Lucas filled her head.With all her memories now intact she knew that what shed felt for him hadnt been just gratitude.She loved him with a sweeping depth that shed never felt for the man shed married.And shed been loved.She didnt care what Lucas said, he had loved her, too.Unfortunately his love for her hadnt been strong enough.She knew it had to do with his father, with the miserable childhood hed suffered.There was no way a child could go through that kind of experience and not be changed at the very core.If only he could see himself through her eyes and embrace the man he was, a loving, giving man who might have made her life complete.Her only regret was that she and Lucas had never gotten the chance to make love for real.She would never feel his hips against her own, the weight of his body on hers as he buried himself deep inside her.Too late now.She closed her eyes, begging for sleep to come and take her away from her thoughts.She had almost drifted off when a faint thud sounded just outside her door.She shot up to a sitting position, her heart thundering alarm.What was that?Were they coming for her?Had they decided to take the baby now, tonight?Her weary acceptance of what was to come disappeared as an unexpected adrenaline filled her.At that moment she realized she did not intend to go easy.She would scratch and claw and fight whoever came inside to take her baby.She would kick and gouge and scream bloody murder even if it didnt help.Shed make sure she hurt them before they killed her.She slid out of bed and grabbed the bedside lamp.With a single pull she yanked the cord from the plug in the wall.It was a tiny thing, by no means a lethal weapon, but she crept to the door and held it up over her head.Her arms shook and her heart pounded so hard she felt half breathless as she waited to see if anyone would enter.Seconds ticked by and she began to think that maybe shed imagined the noise shed heard in the hallway.She froze as she heard the scrape of a key in the lock, then the squeak of the knob slowly turning.As the door creaked open she tightened her hands on the base of the lamp.As the dark figure stepped into the room, she crashed the lamp down on him, crying out in frustration as she realized shed missed his head and hit him on his shoulder.He whirled around and grabbed her by the shoulders, his big, strong fingers biting painfully tight into her tender flesh.She screamed and was instantly backhanded with a slap that nearly sent her to her knees.Shut up, Robert said.If you scream again Ill knock you unconscious.He batted the lamp out of her hand and grabbed her.Lets go.Were moving out of here.Security has been breached.He jerked her out into the dim hallway, where only faint night lights lit the area.It was like her dream, the long hallway and the eerie lighting.Only this time she wasnt running alone, she was being dragged by the man who wanted her dead.It was only as they stepped out of the bedroom that she realized he had a gun, and her heart once again knocked so hard against her ribs it nearly took her breath away.If you make a sound, Ill put a bullet in your brain, he whispered as he pulled her up against him.What was happening?Why was he moving her out of her bedroom in the middle of the night?And why was he doing it at gunpoint?They moved slowly, passing dark rooms with open doors.Where was he taking her?It was obvious he was moving in the direction of the back staircase that would eventually take them into the kitchen of the large house.In the kitchen was a door that led to the garage.Was he moving her completely out of the house?Was he taking her someplace where a doctor awaited to cut her baby from her and toss her dead body on some deserted city street?She might have fallen to the floor in utter despair if they hadnt passed another room.As she glanced inside she could have sworn she saw the movement of a dark, silent shadow just inside the door.Her heart skipped a beat and a tiny flicker of hope ignited inside her.Lucas?Her heart cried his name.Was it possible he had caught her attempt to signal him when shed pulled on the end of her hair?Had he realized shed been lying to him when shed told him everything was all right?Or had she simply imagined that dark form in the room because she desperately wanted to be rescued?Or had the dark shadow simply been one of Roberts henchmen?Closer and closer they got to the stairs that would lead them down and out of the house.Knowing that if he managed to get her outside, nobody would ever know what had become of her, she dragged her feet, making it difficult for them to make forward progress.When they passed another dark room and she thought she saw the shadowy figure of a man, she wondered if she was losing her mind, if the stress of the situation had her seeing phantoms.She never heard them coming.The phantoms seemed to jump out of the very woodwork, two behind them and one in front of them, blocking their way down the hall.She also didnt see the blow that sent the gun flying from Roberts hand.Everything happened in a blur.One of the shadows grabbed her, and the minute she was pulled against his chest she knew it was Lucas.Tears sprang to her eyes, and she might have wept with relief if it wasnt for the sound of running footsteps coming from the opposite end of the hallway.Lucas shoved her behind him and turned to face the next challenge.Somebody turned on the hall lights, and as Julie cowered against the wall, her hands protectively splayed across her belly, all hell broke loose.Lucas and his partners faced off against Robert and the two other men who had appeared in the hallway.As Robert dove for the gun he had dropped, Lucas jumped on his back while Troy and Micah began hand to hand combat with the others.Take her and go, Micah yelled as he rendered his opponent unconscious, then jumped on Roberts back.Lucas rose, his features set in grim lines as he grabbed Julie by the hand and pulled her toward the stairs.They raced downward as fast as she was capable of going.They wouldnt be safe until they were out of this house, away from this compound.Down the two flights of stairs they flew, and when they reached the kitchen they burst out the back door.Julie hadnt realized she was crying until the cold air slapped her wet cheeks.Wait, she said, and stopped in her tracks.Even though she knew they needed to get out of there as quickly as possibly, the run down the stairs had winded her.She bent over slightly and drew in deep gulps of air.She gasped in surprise as Lucas scooped her up in his arms and continued across the field toward the high fence in the distance.She buried her head in his shoulder, awed by his strength, by the chance he had taken to come in to get her.It was only when they reached the fencing that he set her back on her feet.Troy and Micah grinned at them from the other side of the fence.What took you so long?Micah asked, and pulled apart a section of the steel links that had been cut away.I stopped to smell the roses, Lucas replied drily.Julie stepped through the hole in the fence and Lucas followed.Im taking her right to the police station, Lucas said.I suggest you two lie low until we see how this all plays out.Any casualties?Nothing that a little time and a few bandages wont heal, Troy replied.Call Wendall and tell him to meet me at the station, Lucas said to Troy, who nodded.Lets move, Micah added.The two men headed for their vehicles, and Lucas and Julie raced for his.Within minutes they were driving away from Julies nightmare and Julie was telling him everything she remembered, everything that Robert had planned.Lucas said nothing, he just listened until she was finished telling her story.By that time they were in front of the police station.As he turned off the engine of his car she placed a hand on his arm.Lucas, before we go inside, I need to tell you something, she said.Whats that?His gaze was enigmatic in the spill of light from the nearby police station.In the hours tonight as I contemplated my own death, the one thing that kept me strong was my love for you.Not gratitude, Lucas.Love.I love you, Lucas Washington, and if you look in your heart I know that youll see that you love me, too.It doesnt matter whats in my heart, he said, his features looking starker, more sharp than usual as a pulse knotted in his jaw.I told you from the start of this that I dont want a wife.He started to open his car door, but she stopped him by grabbing his arm.Is it because of the baby?You cant love a baby that isnt yours?Of course not, he replied without hesitation.I could love a babyI could love your baby, but I told you I dont want to be a husband or a father.Why not?What are you afraid of, Lucas?Why would you deny yourself the joy of a woman who loves you?A family who could fill your life?We dont have time for this, he said impatiently.Thats one thing I realized as I was waiting to die, she exclaimed.The only real thing we have time for on this earth is to love and to be loved.He stiffened.I will not repeat the mistakes of my father, he said in a voice that trembled with suppressed emotion.No, you wont, she agreed.Because you are not anything like your father.Oh, Lucas, why cant you see yourself as I see you, as your sister sees you?How long will you allow the shadow of your father to keep all light from your heart?A headlight beam from an arriving car bathed Lucass face in stark brightness.Thats Wendall.Lets go inside.Before she could stop him he opened his door and got out of the car.For the next several hours Julie sat with Chief Kincaid and a prosecuting attorney in an interrogation room where she told them everything that had happened from the time of her husbands murder to the present.She now knew why she had been so terrified of coming to the police, and she told Wendall of Officer Ben Branigans involvement with Roberts plans.Lucas had disappeared.She assumed he was being questioned in another room.Several times Wendell left and was gone for long minutes only to return for more questioning.She was completely wrung out by the time Wendall called a halt to things.Ive arranged a room for you at a nearby hotel for the next couple of days, he said.Youll be under guard until we can sort all this out.He smiled for the first time since theyd begun the questioning process.Dont worry, Julie.Well make sure you and your unborn baby are safe now.She nodded wearily.Can I see Lucas now?He looked surprised.Lucas left here some time ago.He told me to tell you goodbye for him.Now, lets get you settled in for the night.Numb.She was numb as Wendall escorted her from the room and introduced her to Officer Clay Samuels, who would be taking her to her hotel and standing guard for the next twelve hours.He left without saying goodbye.Hed made sure she was safe, hed listened to her tell him that she loved him, but ultimately hed made the choice to walk away from her.She had a horrible feeling that she would never hear from, never see him again.Pregnesia Chapter ThirteenWant more coffee?Loretta asked Lucas as she got up to pour herself another cup.No, thanks, Im fine.What are your plans for the day?he asked once shed joined him at the table.Im going shopping for a dress to wear to Micahs wedding, she replied.And then Im meeting Joe for lunch.Joe was the coworker shed had a date with, the coworker Lucas suspected might eventually become his brother in law.Even as she said his name her eyes took on a new sparkle.When do I get to meet this guy?Lucas asked with a touch of impatience.I dont knownot yet.Well see how things go in the next couple of weeks, she replied with a smile.What do you have planned for the day?Lucas glanced out the window, where it was yet another cold, gray day.Im not sure.Im kind of at loose ends.For the last week he, Micah and Troy had kept a low profile, not even going into the Recovery Inc.offices as they waited for the dust to settle following their raid on the Church of Enlightenment compound.The D. A.  had decided not to press any charges against the men who had rescued Julie.I heard they made some more arrests yesterday, Loretta said, as if she knew his thoughts.He nodded and focused back on her.That makes fourteen.I spoke to Wendall late last night and he told me he thought theyd arrested everyone that had anything to do with Julies case.And theyll all be charged with kidnapping?Among other charges.He picked up his coffee cup and took a sip, trying not to think about Julie.He wasnt even sure where she was now, told himself it was enough just to know that she was safe.According to what Wendall had told him the night before, they had recovered enough information off Roberts computer to see that hed spend most of the rest of his life behind bars.Hed kept a diary, filled with plans and sermons he would give his congregation to welcome in the new little prophet.It never failed to amaze Lucas how stupid criminals could be when it came to their computers and what they typed in, believing that they wouldnt get caught, that nobody would ever see their incriminating records.Theyd also managed to find the doctor who had been going to take the baby from Julie and allow her to die.Martha Montgomery had been a weak link, and according to Wendall, was spilling her guts in hopes of cutting a deal with the prosecution.Troy proposed to Brianna, he said, once again to get his mind off the thoughts of the woman who had haunted him for the last week.Good for him, Loretta replied.Did they set a date for the wedding?Not yet, although theyre thinking sometime in the spring.And they all lived happily ever after.The words that ended every fairy tale flittered through his head.Micah would soon make Caylee his bride, Troy and Brianna would follow and begin a family and eventually Loretta might marry her Joe.The only real thing we have time for on this earth is to love and to be loved.Julies words whirled around in his head.Youve invited them all for Thanksgiving dinner?Loretta asked.He nodded and stood abruptly.Ive got to get going, he said, needing to do something, anything that would keep him too busy to think.He carried his cup to the sink just as Lorettas phone rang.She answered as he washed out his cup and put it in her dishwasher.By the time he turned to face her, shed already hung up.That was Julie, she said.Shes in labor and on her way to the hospital.Loretta looked at him expectantly.A rush of crazy emotions blew through him.You wont have that baby alone.Ill make sure of that.Wasnt that what hed told her?Wasnt that what hed promised her?It hadnt been a real promise, he tried to tell himself.It had just been a statement made in the heat of a moment.As he stood there, frozen in place, Lorettas look of expectation turned to one of faint disgust.Youre a fool, Lucas.I know you love her and I know whats holding you back.In a million years, under a million circumstances, you could never be like him.She grabbed her purse from the countertop.Youre my hero, Lucas.You always have been, but a hero isnt afraid of loving somebody.Im going to the hospital, because Julie needs somebody with her.Im not the person she really wants, but I guess Ill have to do.She marched out of the kitchen without a backward glance, and a moment later Lucas heard the slam of her front door.He remained standing in the stillness of the kitchen, alone as hed always been, alone as he should be.JULIE FELT THE GRIP of another contraction coming on and tried to breathe slowly and evenly as she succumbed to the pain that would eventually usher in the birth of her son.She panted as the pain slowly eased away.Three minutes apart.It wont be long now, the nurse said cheerfully.Youre doing just fine, Julie.Im going to check in with the doctor.Ill be right back.As she left the room Julie turned her head to look out the hospital room window.The gray, overcast skies could do nothing to detract from the joy of the knowledge that in a short period of time shed have her baby boy in her arms.The only thoughts that might have stolen a tiny bit of joy from her were of Lucas.She tried desperately to keep him out of her mind.For the last five days while shed been alone in her hotel room, Lucas was all shed been able to think about.Shed almost wished she could call back her amnesia and forget everything that had happened from the moment hed found her in the back of that car to when hed walked out of the police station without a backward glance.Unfortunately, selective amnesia didnt seem to be in her power, and thoughts of what might have been had haunted her throughout those days and nights.With yesterdays arrests, Chief Kincaid had told her that he thought she was no longer in danger.Everyone she remembered being part of the plot to steal her baby was now in jail.Last night shed moved back into the house shed shared with David.She would live there until it sold, then hopefully shed have enough to cover a couple of months of living expenses.Next fall she intended to return to teaching.The future was an open book filled with potential and all she had to do was stop thinking about a particular black haired, dark eyed man who had stolen her heart.Shed called Loretta several times during the past week, finding solace in the friendship that the two had built in the brief time theyd spent together.In none of those conversations had Lucass name come up.As she felt another contraction beginning to build, she clenched her fingers into the sheets as tears blurred her vision.They werent tears of pain, but rather ones of disappointment.Shed called Loretta, but she hadnt shown up yet.I can do it alone, she told herself as a whimper escaped her lips.She knew she was strong, perhaps stronger than most women.Shed just endured an ordeal that few would ever experience and shed come out of it okay.She closed her eyes as the pain shot through her.Another whimper slipped from her mouth, this one a little bit louder.She was vaguely aware of somebody coming back into the room and suddenly her hand was clasped in a bigger, stronger one.Her eyes flew open and she gasped as she saw Lucas, his dark eyes radiating with her pain.Breathe, Julie, he said softly.She closed her eyes as his hand squeezed hers tightly and she breathed, riding the wave of pain more easily just knowing he was with her.When the contraction subsided, she looked at him once again.Was he here because Loretta had insisted he come?Because hed made her a promise and Lucas was a man of his word?She was afraid to hope for anything more.Im naming him Luke, she said with more than a touch of defiance.And if you dont like it you can just lump it.He raised a dark eyebrow with a teasing smile.Lump it?You know what I mean, she replied.What are you doing here, Lucas?He pulled up a chair next to the side of her bed and sat, then once again took her hand in his.Somebody very wise once told me that the only real thing we have time for on this earth is to love and to be loved.Her heart skipped a beat as she eyed him cautiously.That still doesnt answer my question.The teasing smile that had curved his lips faltered and it was with complete seriousness that he gazed at her.As crazy as it sounds, I think I fell more than half in love with you the minute I saw you in the back of that car.You knew I was in love with you.Loretta knew I was in love with you.Even I knew it.But you scare the hell out of me.Youre an exnavy SEAL.Nothing should scare you, she protested.Not being the man I want to be has always scared me, he replied.But youre the man I want you to be.Youre the man I want in my life forever.Oh, Lucas, dont you see?The last word rose an octave as a new contraction ripped through her.It seemed to last forever and was followed by another one almost immediately.The doctor swept into the room and smiled at Lucas.Ah, I see were all heremommy and daddy.And very soon well have little junior here with us.Julie knew she should correct the doctor, tell him that Lucas wasnt the daddy, that he was just here because hed made a stupid promise.She should tell the doctor that Lucas would be here only long enough to see the birth of the baby and then he would disappear from her life once again.But she couldnt tell him, she couldnt speak a single word as waves of pain tore through her.Lucas grabbed her hand, his eyes shining overly bright as the doctor got into position at the foot of her bed and told her to push.Push, Julie.Lets get this baby born, he said.She bore down with a low scream as tears blurred her vision.The tears were a mix of pain and joy.Come on, son, she begged as she stopped bearing down and tried to catch her breath.Youre doing great, Julie, Lucas said as he swept a strand of her damp hair away from her face.Again, Julie, the doctor said.Push.Come on, honey, that little boy wants to be born, Lucas said.Push.She did.Over and over again she grunted and pushed to give birth.Thats it, Lucas exclaimed.You are so beautiful, he exclaimed as he swept her damp hair away from her forehead.Youre the bravest woman I know.I cant do it anymore, she exclaimed in exhaustion.Yes, you can, Lucas replied.I love you, Julie, and I love that baby.Now, push!Although his words and actions of love were welcomed, in the back of her mind she knew not to embrace them into her heart.The ability to think fell away as she gave herself into the gripping pain of birth and the knowledge that this moment with Lucas wouldnt last forever.NIGHT HAD FALLEN and outside her hospital window the sky was filled with stars.It was as if the clouds had parted to reveal the beautiful starlit night sky just for little Luke.He lay in her arms, sleeping soundly, and snuggled against the reassuring sound of her heartbeat.Love swelled up inside her as she kissed the top of his little bald head.Shed slept most of the afternoon, exhausted by the birth.A nurse had awakened her a little while ago and told her it was time to feed her boy.The birth itself now felt like a dream, the memory of pain gone beneath the overwhelming joy.Had she dreamed of Lucas when in the throes of childbirth?Immediately after little Luke had made his appearance, Lucas had done a vanishing act, and she hadnt seen him since.She really hadnt expected anything else.Hed fulfilled his promise that she wouldnt have the baby alone, and now he owed her nothing more.Were going to be just fine, she whispered to Luke.Were going to have a wonderful life together.Once again she turned her head to look out her window.No point in wishing on a star for a man who refused to make a commitment despite his pronouncements of love for her.Instead, she wished for a long and happy life for her son, a world filled with laughter and love.She would give him that.She would give him all the love she had in her heart.A sound from the doorway drew her attention.When she turned her head to see who was there, her breath caught in her chest.Lucas stood just inside the room.In one hand he held a huge bouquet of flowers, and in the other arm he gripped the biggest teddy bear shed ever seen.I didnt think Id ever see you again, she said.Yeah, I didnt think you would, either.He placed the flower arrangement on a nearby table, the teddy bear in a chair and then moved to stand beside her bed.In the dim lighting of the room his eyes glowed as he gazed at her.I thought I could walk away from youfrom him but I cant.For the first time in my life, my love is bigger than my fear.He sank down in the chair next to her, as if his legs wouldnt hold him up any longer.She didnt say a word, afraid that in doing so she might break the moment.Ive done nothing but think about you since I left the police station a week ago.The last week has been the longest in my life, but I was determined to stay away from you.Then Loretta told me you were in labor and I knew this was where I needed, where I wanted to be.He paused and reached for her hand.Im not my father and in a million years I could never be my father.Ive wasted too many years of my life worrying about what I might become instead of recognizing the kind of man I am.Ive been trying to tell you that, she finally said, her heart more full than it had ever been in her entire life.He grinned sheepishly.You should know by now that Im hardheaded.His grin disappeared and he leaned forward, his eyes shining with a suspicious moisture.I love you, Julie, and I want a life with you, with Luke.I want to be the man in both of your lives.Lucas Washington, if you dont kiss me this minute I think I might die, she exclaimed.He grinned, that sexy smile that swelled her heart even bigger.He stood and bent over, capturing her lips in a kiss that flamed through her with a wealth of new promises.When the kiss finally ended, he drew back from her and gently tucked a strand of her hair behind her ear.Youll be home for Thanksgiving, Julie.You and Luke will be home with me.As the stars twinkled outside the window, Julie felt the fire of a comet in her soul, but she knew it was nothing more than the sweet warmth of love.
