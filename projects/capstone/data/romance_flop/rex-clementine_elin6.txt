He readjusted himself in his seat and cleared his throat.Do you understand why you are here?I shrugged and he stood up.He walked towards me and I could feel my heart jump into my throat.Rex had a calm manner to him but this man had that feeling that makes your hair stand on end.I stood still as he walked around me.Well it seems our little Rex likes you for some odd reason.Why is it odd?Because I am not already immortal?I spat back.I didnt regret it, what would he do to me?He just smiled and stood in front of me.Well dont get all mouthy.He leaned forward and I could smell his musky scent or pine needles and cinnamon.I know you are probably amazing for Rex.The thing is is he is a mommys boy and she doesnt like many people.I felt his hand on my waist and my body stiffened.Dont get so nervous.We arent here to hurt you.Just to..He paused and dropped his hands.See if you are worth it.He looked over at the woman and nodded.Lets go.He took my arm in his and we walked away from her.I looked back at Gloria but she was talking to the woman now, whom I still didnt know her name.He took me out to the outside where an elegant garden enfolded in front of us.There were different colors everywhere, swirling around together.A large line of trees surrounded the area, towering over the bushes and flowers.I could see a weeping willow in one corner, tiger lillies encircling it.Daisies, daffodils, peonies and roses all bursted from the ground at full bloom.I was never one for flowers but this beautiful garden had me enticed.If I could sit out here and watch the animals react to it, it would be a marvelous day in my book.I relaxed a bit next to him.He was muscular, I could tell just from his arm that was holding mine.He walked slowly next to me, quietly at first.Please excuse May.She can get crazy.I looked up at him, not even realizing he was talking at first.May?I asked quietly.Yes.My wife.I nodded.That was her name!She is very protective; ever since Rex was young she was like that.I think it was because of me.I nodded and bit the inside of my lip.Was he the God?He smiled and nodded.Yes I am.I looked up at him and opened my mouth.I saw the look on your face.We had made our way to a series of benches and there was a water fountain in between them.He led me to a seat and I sat down as the breeze blew my hair and a chunk fell down.I smiled up at him as he pulled the hair back up with the rest and pinned it up.I was slowly feeling better about being around him, not as relaxed as I was with Rex though.I felt my cheeks blush slightly as I thought about Rex again.I missed him incredibly.So has he proposed yet?He asked and I realized I was playing with the ring on my finger.I nodded and held out my hand.The diamond shone with the sunlight as I turned my hand to the side.He smiled and leaned back against the cool stone bench.I figured he would.You are quite different from his usual women.How so?I asked quietly.He smiled and looked at the water fountain.You will soon see.He spoke quietly.**    Rex and the butler Oscar had made their way to the basement in the castle.Oscar punched in some numbers on the keypad and a large door opened up like a garage door would.Inside was dark but soon the lights flickered on as they walked into the room.Mounted on the walls were various guns from small to large AK 47s.They were all filled with stun shots, nothing kill worthy.Oscar walked straight through the hall and opened up a cabinet on the far left side.Rex frowned and walked over towards Oscar.I never thought we would have to use this stuff before.Oscar looked over at him and smiled a half hearted smile.I know sir.Oscar chimed in and held out a black outfit for him.Rex took it and changed into it.He now wore a black vest, black tight pants with a white shirt.Across his back was a large strap for a gun.He leaned down and slid a knife into a holster on his ankle.Octavius voice rang out in the background.Rex whats up?What happened?He rushed over and looked at Oscar.No.Not that.Octavius nodded and put his hand on Rexs shoulder.Its okay.We can do this.He grabbed a gun and slid it into his belt.She better not have more guards than she did last time.Rexs mother was obsessed with power.Somehow she had managed to keep Rexs father with her once Rex had grown up.This caused millions of issues with him and his mother.May had raised him to think about himself and not others.He was told his father was a bad person and that he had left them.This of course was a lie and he soon figured it out when his father came back.She had made it so Rex had to talk to her after years of not talking with her.She had actually held him captive for a while, trying to make him understand and Octavius had to break him out, so this wasnt the first time they had to use force with her.Rex strapped the gun to the inside of his leg.The last time he had injured many guards and he trained every day, the way she had taught him.Since he was young, Octavius had fought by his side.They knew what to do to complement each others moves.How to keep their backs together and they had learned how to fight as one.Rex looked in the mirror and let out a deep sigh.His black clothes made him look thinner yet more defined.All of his tattoos were covered up.The small glasses he had been wearing were replaced with sunglasses.These also doubled as night vision glasses.It will be alright.Im sure she hasnt done anything.I just hope Anyas temper hasnt gotten the better of her.Octavius rough voice interrupted the still air.Rex looked towards him and nodded.I hope she hasnt met Roya.Octavius made a grunt noise and headed towards the car.Anya, I hope you are safe.Rex thought before they disappeared into a black SUV.**    I sat on the bench next to the older man and let out a soft sigh.Excuse me sir, but Im not sure what to call you.I know Mays name but what do I call you?He let out an unsettling laugh and picked up my hand in his.He pet the back of my hand for a moment before answering.His skin felt soft against mine, much like Rexs.No imperfections were obvious, it felt more like the skin of a small child.My name is Roya.That is what you can call me.He gave a friendly smile and I could feel myself slowly relax around him.The longer I was with him, the more I felt like I was with Rex.The breeze hit us with a chilly aspect it didnt hold earlier.I debated asking to go inside but he seemed content, that and I didnt really want to deal with her.So have you heard of our last encounter with Rex?He questioned randomly.I didnt expect him to tell me about his personal life.I shook my head no and he settled into the cold, hard bench.Well Rex grew up not knowing who I was.I was a horrible person when he was born, so dont hold it against me.I nodded and turned towards him as he told me the story.He had grown up thinking I was a terrible person, which is why he hates me.Then when I returned after figuring out I needed to step up and be a father, it was too late.His mother had filled him with hatred.He left us after I returned and said that if I wanted to be with his mother, he would not stay.I later married his mother and she joined me in immortality.That is the only reason she is alive today.Unfortunately I showed up when she was older, which is why she looks older than me.We had invited him to celebrate our marriage and he refused.He let out a soft sigh.We ended up getting in contact with his butler and offered him a job here, hoping that it would make him come visit us.He came in and stormed the place.He kind of went a little psycho.Ever since then he hasnt talked to us.I understand, dont get me wrong, but he should get over it.I fucked up, but its been years.I looked up at him, amazed at Rex being so angry.I sat silent for a minute, fitting the pieces of the puzzle together.You brought me here to fix the tension between you by forcing him to come here?I stated matter of factly.Royas eyes flickered and he smiled.You are quite smart.You should do well in this family.I played with the ring on my finger and smiled.I havent had a family in a long time.I whispered, looking down at the ground.He gave me a quizzical look but I didnt want to just jump my life story on him.Go on.I am not one to judge.I smiled as the air seemed to warm up and I felt more secure.I gave him the basics, my mothers death and my husbands death.His eyebrows scrunched together and then let go.You have seen too much death.He spoke quietly, everything sinking in I though.I felt myself fidgeting and played with the loose curls that had fallen.He stood up swiftly, almost in alarm.Dinner is ready.he chirped.We can continue talking after dinner.I nodded and he took my arm in his one more time.He was very proper, like Rex.Or was Rex like him?We walked through the soft grass and I now noticed the sun was setting.I didnt think we had been talking that long!We made our way down the side of the building to a huge umbrella with a patio set under it.The umbrella had to be at least 20 ft wide.The table was set for three, Roya, May and I.  The plates were black with gold etching around the lip.There was mashed potatoes, pork roast, gravy, carrots, green beans and water on the table.Each plate had been preset with food.A bottle of wine was held out in front of me as I took my seat between May and Roya.I nodded and a glass was poured for me.Roya sat at the head of the table with May on the opposite side.I gingerly bit into my food after Roya had and settled into my seat.Rex pulled the SUV up the driveway and cut the lights.The huge palace stood in front of him and he felt a shiver slide down his back.Octavius was already out of the car and making his way up the driveway.Rex flew up past him and crouched behind a bush.The lights were on the right half of the building.Octavius had already headed towards a window and cracked it open.A red light flashed for a second in front of them.Rex pushed Octavius aside and hopped over the light, almost hitting it.Octavius jumped in after.The walls were plastered with paintings and it gave Rex a sinking feeling.What were they doing to Anya?Was she hurt?He felt his heart drop a little as they walked.Guards were talking down the hall and Rex put his arm out to stop Octavius.The guards were laughing but soon they left.A room sat alone but light poured out from under the door.Octavius took the handle and looked up at Rex, giving him a nod before pushing the door open.Light flooded the hallway and they ran into the room and shut the door behind them.The room was plain, a bed sat nestled in a corner with a dresser next to it.The overhead lamp was on which was providing the light.Rex held the gun out and went through the room, looking for Anya.Anya?He whispered, his voice hoarse.Octavius spread out and checked the bedroom but she was nowhere in sight.Rex shot Octavius a look and they decided to head deeper into the palace.Rex opened the door, waited a minute and then continued down the hallway.He knew there were many rooms in this palace.This palace that haunted him in his dreams.This is where he grew up, where he was told of the horrible things his father had done.This was where he trained, where Octavius had met with him numerous times for advice.Three guards stood in front of them as they stopped in their tracks.Octavius held out his gun, ready to shoot when he heard the cock of a gun behind him.Well, well well.What do we have here.A stern voice rose from behind Octavius.He put his hand down and Rex turned back to look at the man.It was one of the guards, his face all perked up that he had caught the runaways.Well Roya has been looking for you Rex.He walked around Rex and pointed in the direction towards the lighted area.Nice to see you too Raymond.Rex slurred out and began walking.Raymond was the head security guard.Raymond and Rex had met numerous times whether it be to remind Rex of his mothers affection or to remind him that he needs to visit her.Raymond patted Rex on the back as they made their way towards Royas room.Roya has missed you.May hasnt heard from you in a long time.She is mad about that.You got a girl though right?She is here!She is having so much fun with Roya.Rex stopped walking and Raymond shoved him.Dont get all heroic.She is fine.Roya likes her.Rex grunted but continued walking.They turned down a well lit hallway and Rex knew that Royas room was coming up.They stopped.Octavius was behind Rex with the three guards where they waited until Raymond knocked on the door.It opened but nobody was behind it.Raymond ushered Rex inside and closed the door behind him.Rex looked around confused.A large bed sat in the middle of the room with a red and black bed set.Two rooms branched off of the room and there was a shadow on the left room.Roya?Rex spoke softly, waiting for him to answer.He crossed his arms across the front of his chest and waited.I heard Rexs voice and stopped.Rex?I let out a soft scream and ran past the room I was currently in.I could hear him, that was him right?Rex?I called out again.I was still in the large dress the edges were growing dirty because I had worn it all day.I rushed past the china cabinet, the dresser and the bed.Rex!I called out again.He heard my scream and watched through the doorframe.Anya?I ran through the bedroom to see an empty room.Anya?I heard his voice again and followed it.I made my way over to a wall and tapped on it.I heard a tap back and pressed myself against the wall.Rex is that you?Get me out of here.I whispered and tapped again.I heard his soft voice and smiled.Ill get you baby, dont worry.I heard the door open to my room and groaned.Rex, somebody is at my room.I whispered before making my way over.Hello?I called and stopped.Oh Roya, hi.I put my hands behind my back as he made his way into the room.He was in his robes for the night, his face ageless like always.I was just checking on you.I heard Rex had gotten in.We should see if we can find him.I felt my cheeks flare up for a second.Where is he?I asked suddenly, surprised by my own impatience.I need him Roya.I need him now.Roya nodded and turned to leave the room.He will be in in five minutes.Do not forget why I brought you here.He said in a rather calm manner.He smiled and then left.I collapsed on the bed, emotions running through me.How could Rex have let me get kidnapped?Why was I the one who had to fix this relationship?How was I going to fix it?I heard the door open once more and bit my lip.Anya?I heard his voice and sat straight up.His face popped out and I ran over to him.Anya!He whispered and held me tightly.I hugged him tighter than I ever had before.Tears fell down my face and his hands went around me.One went up behind my head and held me against his chest while the other worked itself around my back.Rex, I was so scared.Rex I didnt know what was going to happen.I balled and never let go of him.I know.I know baby, I am so sorry.We fell over onto the bed and I buried myself against him further.Dont leave me ever again.Ever!I screamed at him.His body shook underneath mine and I knew he was crying.I had never seen him cry before.I love you.I whispered and pulled his head up so I could see him.His eyes were bloodshot and I cupped his face in mine.I love you too.Nothing like this will ever happen again.He gently put his lips against mine, still shaking from crying.I kissed back, emotions still churning in my stomach.I felt betrayed yet loved, angry yet happy, upset yet emotionless.I couldnt believe he put me through all of this.He did come back for me though.That had to outweigh everything.He rescued me.He really was my knight.We must have stayed like that for a while, holding each other so tightly.I think I fell asleep a couple of times in the process.When I woke up from my recent lapse into unconsciousness, it was dark outside.I rolled over and hugged Rex.He smiled and brushed my hair from my face and kissed my forehead.Did I fall asleep for long?I whispered.He laughed and pulled me close.He propped himself up against the bed he had somehow managed to fall asleep on.I think we both fell asleep, love.He whispered and kissed my cheek.I propped myself up on my elbow and let out a soft sigh.He gave me a concerned look and I smiled back at him.Do you know why they took me yet?He went to hug me but I stopped him.We need to work this out.I whispered and he gave me a sigh of defeat.So Roya thinks you hate him and I understand if you do but we need to fix this.He will keep taking me if we dont fix it okay?He really wants to be friends with you and doesnt think you should treat him like this.What is wrong with him?He seems nice.Rex let out a low grumble and leaned back away from me.You wouldnt understand.Bullshit.Try me.I answered and crossed my arms across my chest.He left my mom for what?So he could live out his Godly ways?He doesnt care about her.He doesnt care about me.Some father he was he didnt even come when I needed him.Rex he is here now and he is trying to fix what happened.He knows you are mad at him but he wants to fix it.He wouldnt come back if he didnt care.He didnt care that she was older, he still stayed with her.How much more doubt do you need?He knows he hasnt been there for you but he is now.Rex looked away from my gaze and sighed.I cant.Its hard for me to just accept him back in my life.Well he isnt expecting you to do it right now, he just wants you to try.I spoke quietly and took his hand in mine.I looked at his tattoo he had said was for his father.Didnt you say that tattoo was for him?His mouth turned up and into a smile.I did.Before he left, well actually the first time he came back.I wanted to impress him with my tattoo shop and said I would get a tattoo for him.He seemed thrilled so I got it because he said he used to be in the Navy.When I returned from work that day he was nowhere to be found and my mother said he had left.That shattered me.I actually thought he was going to stay and he didnt.I cant let him back into my life, I cant have a father who is going to leave all the time.I just cant do it Anya.I frowned but knew what he meant.My own family situations had been horrible.My father was always good to me but my mother near the end couldnt even remember who I was.There is nothing worse than the person who raised you not even knowing your name.I looked back up into his stormy eyes and let out a soft sigh.We need to fix this.I said under my breath.He nodded and closed his eyes as our foreheads touched.I looked down at my fingers entwined with his.I played with the ring nervously waiting for his response.I heard a small knock on the door and looked over at Rex.He stood up but I stopped him and walked to the door myself.Outside stood a frenzied Roya.Has anything come from your talking?He asked in a hushed whisper.I turned my head back to Rex.His head was in his hands and he was breathing slowly.I nodded and smiled at Roya, opening the door.I think you should talk to him while I talk to May.I said in a stern voice.He cocked his head ever so slightly and whispered something to his guards.I looked back at Rex, who was in the same position, and hoped I was doing the right thing.I bit the inside of my lip and leaned to the side as Roya slowly made his way into the room.I turned back to see Roya pat Rex on the shoulder.Rex turned his head up with a confused expression before glancing at me.I nodded and slipped out of the door.I heard raised voices the second I did and let out a slow sigh.You boys showing me to May?I asked the guards and they nodded.We began walking down the long corridor and I smiled to myself.I had never stuck up for anything I believed in but back there I did and it was about to get even better.I was going to tell May what was on my mind.Throughout my whole relationship with Rex I have learned a few important facts.Life is life, dont waste it.I wasted so long holding out because I was upset about my husband that I wouldnt let myself relax around anybody.Maybe it was good though, or else I would have been taken when Rex came around.Number two: always be ready for surprises.Immortal?Now I am like yeah so?If you would come up to me and say you had a two headed baby I would probably believe you.Okay I probably wouldnt but the fact is that I am ready for anything.Throw it at me, I am not afraid anymore.The last thing is let family into your life.You will be so much happier.Since being with Rex I have been talking to my family more than even and finding myself happier than ever.I was even ready to bring Roya into my family.May on the other hand I would need to have a word with.We walked through the quiet halls and stopped in front of a set of black doors.I let out a sigh and the guard to my left motioned towards the door.Here we go, I sighed.I pushed the doors open, set my jaw and walked in.It was set up like a library, bookcases crowding the walls Tables were scattered in no apparent pattern among the space between the bookcases.May was huddled in one plush chair with a book spread out in front of her.She glanced up as the doors opened and twitched one side of her lips up into a snarl.Nice to see you too May.I spoke softly, twisting the chair in my grip and sitting on it backwards.She leaned back in her chair and pushed her hair behind her ear.And what do you want?She crossed her hands slowly.I want to know why you are such a bitch and why Roya even deserves you?She didnt like my answer for her eyebrows rose and her hand clenched into a fist.I leaned forward in my seat and whispered.You want to fight?Before I could move her fist connected with my jaw.It sent me reeling off of the chair onto the floor.I couldn't even fathom what she had just done.I got up and she was next to me.Fighting is so unlike you Anya.She snarled and I saw the fire in her eyes.I crouched and held my fists in front of me.Why?Oh wait, I am supposed to be just like Krystie right?She is the perfect child and you set them up a long time ago am I right?I ducked and slapped her hand away from my face as she lunged towards me.Yes!Why do you think Roya left?He left to make it happen.He left to make sure his son would become the next in line.You think Roya really wants someone like Octavius in lead?I let my guard down and gave her a puzzling look.A hideous laugh escaped from her throat.That is what it is all about!If two immortals become a pair then they will rule their section together.Roya always was leader but didnt have Rex soon enough so he left to figure out what would make him the leader.I was short of breath but moved to the table, leaning against it.Rex doesnt want that!He wants a normal life.He likes that Octavius is leader.That is all this is about?You dont even care what your son wants?I could feel the anger growing inside of me as hers was too.She leaned forward and I swung at her, connecting with her shoulder.I was going for her face but was proud I got her in the first place.If you didnt show up it would all work as planned!She screamed and ran towards me.I twirled around the table and glared at her.He would be with her and become rightful leader.Your head is major twisted sister.I hissed.I had never felt this much anger before.I felt blood trickle down from where her ring had cut my jaw.I wiped the blood away and felt her body rush against mine.She held me in a grip so strong I couldnt break free.I coughed and hurled her onto the table so I could get away.Frantically I looked around for a way to get out or help myself defeat her.She wheezed a bit before getting back up, all I could find were books so I threw one at her.Books?She chuckled.You cant change the future.Once I am done with you the plan will carry out.Done with me?What you plan on killing me?My heart began beating faster.If that was the case I needed to get my ass in gear.I threw another book at her, this time striking her in the forehead.A cackle rose from her as she fell back onto the ground.I felt a small twinge of guilt as I saw her fall but when she got back up and threw a chair at my head it immediately went away.Youre a horrible mother!I threw another few books at her, she had gotten her own books by now..You dont deserve to have him as a son!And you dont deserve him in anyway, let alone a child with him!She screamed back between books.A child?You must be crazy I am not pregnant!Plus I cant be since I will be going through with the ceremony little miss Krystie was supposed to go through with!By now I had blocked her out to a high pitched whine.If anyone were to walk in it was a mess.Books were now strewn across the entire library along with a few stray chairs.I was screaming along with her though, dont give me the credit of being the bigger person in this situation.We both had gotten each other in the face a few times.She had a large gash across her forehead but I swear it was healing as we fought.I had several small cuts along my jaw and a bruise starting on my left eyebrow.Just go away and leave this family alone!She screamed before running straight at me.We both fell down in a tangle of purely outraged females.Hair pulling and scratching was what consumed us currently until she stopped.Thought so.Too weak to finish the job.I spoke with an edge that could cut through anything and pushed her away from me.I stood up, smearing the blood along my cheek and looked at the door which was now flung open and a wide mouth Roya and Rex stood there.May was still cowered on the ground and I just slunk down into a chair.Guess your talk went better than ours.I spoke, breaking the rising tension in the room.I think I am ready to go honey.I spat out the word honey as I walked past May.Rex and Roya stood in front of me still shell shocked at the fact we had fought so violently.I glanced back at the mess and smiled.Rex turned with me and we walked away from that place.Octavius was sitting outside in the car.He got up and ran out to us.What happened to you Anya?She kicked ass.Rex smirked and squeezed me tighter against him.Octavius smiled and we all got into the car.Definitely a night I would remember.I woke up in the middle of the night, beads of sweat rolling off my forehead.God it was hot.I slid my hand down across my belly and smiled.What had once been flat now rose up into a curve.I hobbled my way up from the bed and walked towards the bathroom.I opened the widow and the cool evening air washed over me.I turned sideways in the mirror and put my hand on the bump once more.Hello little one.I whispered.I cant wait to meet you.For an instant I thought I felt a kick, but then remembered it was too early for that.I was barely just showing and there wasnt a way the baby would be kicking already.I decided to get something to eat and made my way towards the kitchen.I still couldnt believe I had a little baby inside of me.It was crazy.I opened the cabinets and found some crackers and munched on them happily.I wasnt quite ready to go to bed so I flopped down on the couch and flipped the tv on.It was 2 in the morning so all that was on was infomercials and paid programming.Or were those the same thing?I finally gave up and pushed a dvd in.Leaning back on the couch I settled in for a majority of the movie.Lord of the Rings usually put me to sleep simply based on the length.I made it through the first one and popped in the second before feeling sleep tug at my eyes.Rolling onto the couch I found myself falling into darkness finally.**    Anya?Wake up honey.I yelped and jumped up at his voice.A laugh erupted from his chest and I threw my pillow at him.You jerk!He leaned over and kissed my cheek.I winced and he pulled away.You never did tell me what happened.He whispered as he stroked my cuts with his thumb.For the most part they were healing alright.When I had gotten home I had found three more cuts and realized I didnt just bruise my eyebrow, there was a gash right through it.I closed my eyes and felt him leave the bed.Frowning I pulled myself up and looked down, eager to see my growing belly.I pushed the covers away but nothing was there.My stomach sat there, flatter than ever.I felt my heart sink.It felt so real.I whispered and ran my hand over my stomach.I thought...Thought what?Rex interrupted me and handed me a cool face cloth for my cuts.Thought that you got skinnier?I swear you get smaller every day.He leaned down and kissed my stomach but I just stayed still.Whats wrong Anya?He asked and looked up at me.I shook my head and felt my cheeks burn.Nothing, just a stupid dream.He took the cloth from my hands and gently stroked the cut.Ow.I bit the inside of my lip and he said sorry profusely.After a long silence he pulled me into his arms.I have been around long enough to know when somebody had a bad dream.He whispered into my ear.So what is it?I clutched him closer but didnt speak.Instead I closed my eyes and let out a slow sigh.I thought he had fallen asleep for the lack of movement.Baby dream?I pulled away from him and frowned.Wh..what?I stuttered and tried to keep my face straight.Why would I have a dream about that?He cupped my head in his hands and kissed me.It had felt forever since I had kissed him.He smelled of honey and vanilla.Roya and I stood outside longer than you knew.I heard what she said.I curled into him, not wanting him to know how upset I was that I wasnt pregnant.
