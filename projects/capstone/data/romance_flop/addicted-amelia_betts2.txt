I asked.She looked me over once again, as if her decision to disclose any personal information would be based on my appearance.Cecile, she finally revealed.Oh!Great name.I think its kinda lame, actually.I dont know, I said.It sounds very grown up to me.I was trying not to sound pandering, but its a thin line when youre trying to win over a thirteen year old girl.Whatever.She frowned as she led me inside with a limp wristed maneuver that felt less than welcoming.Her attitude made sense, given she had lost her mother hardly more than a year ago, not to mention she was thirteen, so I didnt begrudge it.On my way to the living room, I noticed a family photograph displayed on the credenza in the foyer, showing Ceciles clear resemblance to her mahogany skinned, high cheekboned mother.In the picture, the girl was a few years younger and quite skinny.Now she was decidedly fluffy.I wondered if her looking me up and down hadnt come from that brand of self hate that drives women, especially teenage girls, to size each other up in comparison.For a few painful minutes, Cecile and I sat awkwardly in the formal living room, both of us seeming to lack the necessary social skills to engage in small talk.Instead, she pretended to be busy with her phone while I glanced around at the eclectic decorationsa painted coral centerpiece on the coffee table, a massive gold hued still life on the far wall, the Oriental rug that nearly covered the entire room.I vaguely recalled news reports from the time of Mrs.Maxwells death saying that she was an art history professor, which explained the impeccable interior decoration and the overall air of sophistication about the house.Even though we were both waiting for it, when Juliens arrival actually happened, it took Cecile and me by surprise.He gusted in through the front door and called out hello so loudly that I jumped a little in my seat.Dad, your student is here, Cecile said, eyes glued to her phone as she got up from the armchair and skulked out of the room.I heard Julien kiss her hello in the foyer and stood at attention as he walked in.He was in workout clotheslong gray shorts, a white V neck, and slightly goofy looking neon cross trainersthe type of outfit that always prompts the same response in me: I need to work out more.Mischa, sorry I wasnt here when you arrived.Let me show you to your new place.He was slightly out of breath as he led me through the house and explained that hed just ridden his bike from campus.Sweat dotted the back of his shirt.Do you ever ride?he asked.Regrettably, no, I said, my eyes focused on the floor as I rolled my suitcase over various runners and rugs, following him down the hall and through the kitchen.I never did until last year.Now I cant live without it.It helps me clear my thoughts.Julien swung the back door wide open, and I trailed behind him with my suitcase knocking down the steps of his back porch.The backyard was unmowed but impressively green, with sweet little wildflowers rising up around the stone path that led to the cottage where I would stay.It was an A frame structure that could have been deemed a shed if it were any smaller.But inside, there was a stark yet homey decor, and the high pointy ceiling made it seem more spacious than the outside let on.The walls were wood panels painted white.The bed had a simple iron headboard and a red and white Amish quilt.After he showed me the small bathroom and pointed out a stack of plush white towels, Julien sat down on the red and white quilt and bounced on the mattress slightly.Still good!he announced.This thing has been with me since undergrad.Best three hundred dollars I ever spent.This is perfect.I parked my suitcase by the door, dropping my purse on the small desk beside it.Gracie would be in heaven right now, I thought, seeing Julien on the bed across from me.Im glad youre here, Mischa, said Julien with one last pat of the mattress before standing up.I inched to the left so that he could get past me.Me too, I said.This is a real lifesaver.Julien held out his hand for a firm handshake.Glad it could work out for both of us, he said.Ill leave you to get settled.I smiled and let out an actual sigh of relief as he closed the door behind him.Moving had taken a toll on me, and even though Juliens talk of cycling had seemed motivational, I was even more inspired by the idea of a nap on his $300 college mattress.* * * My welcome dinner at Casa Maxwell turned out to be a particular form of torture.First of all, I had been lying facedown on Juliens prized mattress, drooling on his Amish quilt, when he had knocked on the door to invite me.Hello.I answered the door out of breath, after running to the bathroom to adjust my clothes.Hey, Mischa, hows Indian sound?Cecile and I are ordering in.Oh, no, dont worry about me, I said.Please.Wed really like for you to join us.Unless you have somewhere else you need to be.No, not at all.Id like that, thanks.The truth?I did not like Indian.Of my many food related quirks, including a tendency to stuff down my feelings with copious amounts of it, was a total abhorrence of mayonnaise, eggplant, and curry.So when I sat down to dinner, which was fresh from the to go boxes that sat atop the kitchen counter, I ate a heap of saffron rice while slowly cutting my chicken tikka masala dosas into bite sized pieces that I pushed around my plate until the inevitable question popped up: Do you not like your food?I answered with my stock excuse: I just have a stomachache.Its really delicious, though It wasnt just the food that made me uneasy.I found myself withering under Ceciles persistent glare.She probably assumed I had a crush on her fatherGracie couldnt be his only admirerand had come to seduce him.I wanted to pull her aside and assure her that I was not a seductress (far from it!), plus I only had eyes for a certain rogue sex addict roaming about town, but that wouldnt be appropriate.Just the thought of Liam in this family setting seemed to emphasize how wrong he was Despite my abilities as a champion worrier and problem anticipator, I hadnt foreseen how difficult it might be to assimilate into this little world Id landed myself in.Not just because Cecile appeared to be shooting daggers at me from her eyeballs, but because I felt like an interloper in every sense of the word.For one, the house was much grander than the small apartment I had grown up in, or anywhere I had lived during college, and everything around me seemed valuable in that breakable and irreplaceable kind of way.Julien and Cecile possessed exotic good looks that clashed with my Midwestern ness.They had fancy condiments in their refrigerator and expensive dinner plates, even for their Indian takeout.There was also an obvious void, a dark cloud looming over every room.I couldnt help imagining the ghost of Juliens perfect wife looking down on us at the dinner table, disapproving of my pedestrian presence.After dinner, I pretended I had someplace to be, got into my car, and headed down the block aimlessly.It was a Monday, so I had no meeting to retreat to, and I was hungry from not eating dinner, but the last thing I wanted to do was embark on another binge, especially the first day after graduation.Coasting along at ten miles per hour, I ogled the neighbors houses and my mind wandered to Liam.Where was he right now?Had he fallen off the wagon again with some other woman at his restaurant or a random Craigslist hookup?How was I so obsessed with him already?Didnt I know better than to go for a guy that good looking?Would a cheeseburger help me forget about him?Stay strong, Mischa, I coached myself through the mach force, industrial strength crush threatening to take hold.If there was one thing that would help get me through this, it would not be cheeseburgers but willpower.So instead of autopiloting to Taco Bell, I resigned myself to buying groceries and ran the options over in my head.Just like the quirky, ritualistic schedules I adhered to when frequenting fast food restaurants (McDonalds for daytime stops; Burger King and Wendys for dinner; KFC during hometown visits; Taco Bell for all other needs), my grocery store preferences were highly specific, with Publix being my number one choice for nighttime/weekday shopping.It was hands down the most popular supermarket in Oceanside, and therefore crawling with screaming babies and young children anytime before sundown.But after dark on school nights it was like a safe haven.Which is why, when I heard my name called out from the other side of a precarious mountain of bananas in the produce section, I was especially taken aback.Mischa!Youve got to stop following me around like this.Liams irresistible Australian brogue hit my ears like a clap of thunder, and I was as stunned as if actual lightning had struck.Hello, I said, deer in headlights style.Remembering where I was, I furtively glanced into my basketit would have been instant mortification had I already hit the snack aisle, or worse, frozen foodsand breathed a sigh of relief when I saw a single, respectable bunch of kale.You disappeared the other day.Im starting to think you dont like me.Liams devilish smile was a little more tentative than the last time I had seen him, as if he actually cared.Of course not, no I reached out for a banana and the entire display began to tumble, prompting Liam to rush over and stop the mini avalanche with his body.I dropped my basket and collected the fallen fruit from the floor.I thought this only happened in movies, Liam said as I helped him put the bananas back in place.My life is just that magical, I joked.Liam turned to me and smiled.What he didnt know was this moment was actually magical for me.I couldnt believe I was seeing him again, as if all my obsessing had dreamed him into reality.The thought Id had driving away from U Haul the day before came back to me: If I see him again, all bets are off.We stood there for a moment, a Lionel Richie song and the hiss of produce misters providing a soundtrack to our awkward silence.Anyway, I dont want to keep you, he said.Oh no.Now Liam was the one fleeing, waving at me and sauntering away before I even had time to respond.A panic alarm set off in my brainI had to do something.Wait!I called out, having no idea what I planned to say.He turned on a dime, his eyebrow raised  la Jack Nicholson, as if to challenge me.Yes?Umm I was trying to recall something we had talked about, a conversation starter, but nothing came to mind.I drew a blank, too transfixed by the fluorescent lit sparkle in Liams eyes, visible from ten feet away.And then my food driven brain kicked in and remembered the pivotal detail from our first conversation in the Baptist church parking lot.Remember how you mentioned that gelato the other night?The one you make at your restaurant?Yes, Liam responded with a knowing smirk.Ive been thinking about it, I said.By the look on his face, Liam understood that I had been thinking about a lot more than gelato.Its still there, he said with an easy shrug.* * * Liams sporty black Mercedes sped down Citrus Street, Oceansides main drag, as I followed in my beat up Honda.My fear of losing him as he zoomed through several nearly red lights kept my thoughts only partially occupied, while the rest of me questioned what exactly I was doing.Obviously we were not just going to eat gelato and share our life stories, but was I really prepared to sleep with this stranger?And would it make me a horrible person if I did, knowing that sex was Liams drug of choice?If it werent you, it would be somebody else!I heard Isabella call out from the depths of my consciousness.Just go for it!He slowed down outside a gravel parking lot and pulled in past a sign that read TRIO.Suddenly, I knew exactly where I was even though I had never been thereit was the favorite restaurant of my former boss, Sasha Myers.I had booked her reservations there a million times.The only white tablecloth establishment for miles, she liked to say when recommending it to clients at her luxe day spa.Ironically, I had always wanted to eat there but could never afford it, and now here I was with very little intention of eating.Winding around behind the restaurant, we parked side by side in the cramped, employees only parking lot.There were no other cars there, and only one streetlamp provided a dim, yellow beam that hovered over the otherwise dusky, moonlit lot.As I turned off my car and got out, the dense fog that had descended at the grocery store lifted from my brain and reality hit me like a smack to the forehead: What I was doing was reckless, unsafe, and above all, terribly un me.Yet Liam looked so flawless in the moonlight.Is anyone even here?I asked, timidly exiting the safety bubble that was my car.Were not open on Mondays.Liam sounded colder than he had when we had embarked on this little adventure ten minutes ago, and it began to sink in how absolutely strange, in every meaning of the word, this stranger really was as he rustled through his large keychain and located the key to the heavy back door.He unlocked the dead bolt and pushed inside, flipping on the ceiling lights that cast a bluish glow over the well equipped, steel countered kitchen.Like Alice stumbling down the rabbit hole, I tentatively followed him in.All my life I had done the opposite of thishiding, making myself invisible, vanishing into the woodworkand I decided perhaps Alice really had materialized from the written word and was currently inhabiting my body.All right, the ice creams in here, he said, ducking into a walk in freezer and emerging with a stainless steel tub that gave off a little cloud of cold steam.He placed it on the counter and turned around to find me staring, clueless as to what to say or do now that I was officially alone with him.Well let that sit for a second.Let me show you around.Liam smiled and walked ahead of me as I followed silently, feeling the tiny hairs stand up on the back of my neck and edges of my ears.In the dining room, he flicked on half the lights, which were dim to begin with, giving the restaurant that five star, candlelit ambiance that people who like to pay a lot of money for their food are accustomed to.Not looking back at me, he held up an index finger, disappeared into a stockroom, then reemerged with a neatly folded white tablecloth that he draped over a corner booth.Is that the VIP table?I joked, tapping my fingers on the wall beside me as Liam leaned against the booth.Only the best for my late night gelato customers.He made a dramatic sweeping gesture over the table and smiled big enough so that I could see his straight white teeth for the first time.It was an earnest smile, and I felt almost at easewhat stopped me was how handsome he looked as he stood there waiting for me to approach.Hoping to calm my nerves, I tentatively explored the dining room, letting my fingertips graze the tables and chairs in the middle of the room.Its weird being in a restaurant with no people, I said.Yeah, it looks better with a crowd, I guess.No.Its really nice.Where did you get these chairs?I grabbed the back of one of the white, upholstered chairs and drew it toward me, pretending to inspect it.Liam laughed.Really?You wanna know where I got the chairs?He walked over and gently placed his hand on the small of my back.I looked up at him, blushing, and let the chair go.A bead of sweat made its way down my neck.I just like the white fabric.Anything white, reallyI like the color.Virginal, he retorted, like the driven snow.Right.I chuckled and felt my face flush.This is flirting, Mischa.Say something sexy.Its hot in here, I said, plucking my shirt away from my body as I let myself lean into him, my shoulder just grazing his arm.Yeah, the manager has the AC on a timer.I dont know how to change it.Id better get that gelato, eh?He let his hand drop and started toward the kitchen.Okay!I watched him go, thinking, This is good.This is my pace.I didnt notice as I made my way to the corner booth, preparing myself for a little dessert before the main course, so to speak, that Liam had slowed down.By the time I reached the edge of the table, he had come up behind me and laid his hands on my shoulders.Just a warning, its even hotter over here, he said.Really?I reached my arms out as if to feel the air, then caught myself.I was acting clueless, which is exactly what I was.I had never been involved in a real seduction before.In fact, I had only ever slept with my ex boyfriend, Bradley, whose idea of foreplay was the drunken groping typical of any college freshman.I decided to face my fear and turned to look Liam in the eye.I dont know, maybe its just you, I said, sensing his actual body heat as he pressed up against me.Maybe it is.What about the gelato?I lowered my gaze at his broad chest in front of me.Are you just gonna let it melt?Hey, Mischa?Liam took a step back and stared at me with his green eyes.Were two people doing things we shouldnt be doing, right?I think the less we talk, the better.In an instant, Liam braced my hips and lifted me onto the table so that my legs were straddling his waist.I felt myself shaking like a leaf.I had the same excited, scared sensation as being whipped around by a carnival ride, and felt like I should close my eyes like I always had on roller coasters.This was officially no longer my life.It was like I had entered somebody elses much more exciting narrative.Wake up, I thought.Or dont.Let the dream play out.Liam buried his face in my neck, then dragged his chin down into my cleavage, which was exposed in the same ratty V neck T shirt Id worn to the meeting where I first saw him.He kissed my chest and grabbed at both my breasts, growling like a predatory cat.The heat of his body against mine reminded me of the simple magic of being touched, something I hadnt experienced for so long.I wanted to give in to it, but I was also terrified by the foreignness of it all: his masculine smell, his strong hands on the small of my back, the scratchy stubble on his chin, my heart racing a mile a minute.I had no idea where I was or how Id gotten there.When his lips, soft and pillowy, came to meet mine, I squeezed my eyes shut, and the roller coaster took its first drop.The tip of Liams tongue slipped in past my parted lips and danced around with my own.His hand found the back of my neck and braced me as his kiss went deeper.My thighs were squeezed against his body so tightly, I could feel the seams on the sides of his jeans making an impression on my skin.Trailing his fingers from the back of my neck down my spine, Liam moved his kisses to my collarbone, then once again buried his face in my cleavage.In an instant, I felt my elation turn to panic.Liams touch felt so good yet terribly wrong at the same time, like the first time I ever masturbated.All the out of body motivation that had brought me this far dropped away without warning, and I knew I had to stop him from going any further, or Id be lost forever.Someone like Liamso good looking, so experienced, so messed up when it came to sexwould crush me in a second, because I wouldnt be able to forget him.I cant have sex with you, I blurted, then shoved him away with a level of upper body strength I didnt realize I had.I slid down from the table and adjusted my shirt, avoiding direct eye contact as I muttered an apology.To my surprise, Liam stayed where he was, dragging a hand across his mouth as I moved farther away.The look on his face was blank, neither angry nor relieved just blank.I shouldnt have come, I said, to which he shrugged in response.Hoping to feign the same indifference, I waved and flashed a ridiculously fake smile before turning to go.My hasty exit from the restaurant was a blur.In something close to a blackout state, I found my way back through the kitchen and out to the employee parking lot.It wasnt until a couple minutes later that I came to, registering a red light above me as I sped through it like a getaway driver.My heart racing, I glanced back at the intersection to make sure the automatic camera didnt flash my license plate and thanked God I hadnt killed anyone.The questions swirling around my head were overlapping each other and therefore hard to discern, but the one that kept popping into the foreground was, Why?Why did I just leave that incredible looking man wanting more?Why didnt I want him back?Am I so afraid of having any semblance of a life that I have to run from every opportunity?The truth wasI realized after Id talked myself down from the ledgethat I felt unsafe, first and foremost, which made sense because Liam was a sex addict whom Id hardly spoken to.But his looks did confuse things.He was just the right amount of hot to be forgiven most trespasses, the kind of guy who could actually get away with murder.Which, I suppose, justified my actions, him being a potential homicidal maniac.And then there was the obvious darkness about him.He had demons that he was fully aware of and battling, one day at a time.Although the same could be said about me, my food addiction seemed like a silly, light affair in comparison with this mans lack of inhibition on the highway and weakness for anonymous Craigslist sex.We were as opposite as opposites could geton one level, it was probably why I was so attracted to him.But I had gone as far as following him inside an empty restaurant and he hadnt even threatened me.When I walked away, he didnt chase me with a knife or promise to haunt my dreams.Perhaps the only reason to believe he was a killer was to alleviate my disappointment in myself.The harsh reality was that a girl like me would probably never get an opportunity to sleep with someone like him twice.Id blown my chances at one of those unbelievable one night stands that people store in their minds and revisit for years to comethose who are wise enough to seize that kind of fleeting moment.Without thinking, I drove back to my dreary apartment complex before I remembered I no longer lived there.My mind still a million miles away, I turned around in the parking lot and reluctantly steered my car back in the direction of Juliens.Four Upon waking the next morning, I spent a good ten minutes convincing myself that the events of last night had actually taken place and were not just another elaborate anxiety dream centered around Liam.If they had been part of a dream, I rationalized, things wouldnt have ended so unceremoniously.Liam would have pointed and laughed at me, or morphed into my ex boyfriend, or forced himself on me while a crowd of dishwashers watched.But none of the above applied.No, I had walked right up to the edge of something unbelievably exciting and run away like a scared little girl.Almost an hour had lapsed before I stopped lamenting my nonheroic actions long enough to remember it was my first day working for Julien.Luckily my anxiety had woken me up pre alarm, and for a split second I imagined myself partaking in my favorite morning activity: dragging into the kitchen, pouring a bowl of cereal (sugary junk on bad days and flavorless, fiber laden pellets on good ones), and traipsing back into my nest of sheets and pillows, mentally suspending the start of the day by another fifteen minutes or so.Then I remembered where I wasJuliens kitchenless guesthouseand realized that from now on I would have to dress like a civilized person and go to the main house any time I needed food.Perhaps it would work out as a new diet plan.A quick shower and primp session helped me shake off just a little of last nights regret before I made my way through the backyard and entered the Maxwell breakfast scene, not knowing what to expect.Oddly enough, what I found was Cecile in a very good mood, parked by the coffee machine.Can I get you cappuccino or a latte?she asked in a strangely magnanimous tone.This thing does everything.Well, if youre taking orders, I thought, Ill have some eggs, a couple strips of bacon, and a bowl of Honey Smacks to smother my general feeling of failure.A latte sounds great!I said, accepting her offer with an excited nod.I knew from being one myself, teenage girls felt especially empowered when they were allowed to imbibe and/or prepare the morning coffee, and I was happy to indulge Cecile as my barista.Do you take regular milk?Sure.I tucked my hair behind my ears and took a seat on one of the barstools by the island.As she moved around the kitchen, I continued the inventory of the Maxwells well appointed home that Id started upon arrival, noticing that even the kitchen tools were fancy, and here and there were artful little flourishes like the turquoise, crackle glazed vase holding the cooking utensils or a woven pot holder with a bright pink flamingo against a lush green backdrop.So, my dad says youre a Nutrition major, said Cecile, making the small talk we were both too awkward to manage yesterday.I was, yeah.Just graduated.So you probably know a lot about what I should and shouldnt be eating.She avoided eye contact as she made the statement, popping a coffee cup under the nozzle of the elaborate silver machine and cranking a dial that sent the apparatus into a quiet fit of noises and spurts.I havent always been fat like this.Do you think I could be allergic to some kind of food without knowing it?Oh dear.I could remember my teenaged self having similar thoughts.Well, first of all, I hate the term fat and I dont think you are.Second of all, the allergy thingprobably not.The only advice I ever give, based on what Ive learned, is pretty basic: stick with whole foods, avoid anything processed, high fructose corn syrup, sugar in general, and caffeine.I said the last one with sarcastic emphasis, prompting Cecile to roll her eyes and stick out her tongue.I laughed knowingly.Yeah, if only I followed my own advice.Do you eat healthy?Ceciles eyes were on me now, eagerly awaiting my response.Unsure how to answer, I decided to go with a safe, somewhat honest response.I go in and out of phases.Ceciles head bobbed once in approval as she turned her back to me and continued foaming the milk.Although I felt a slight urge to tell her the truth, admit that I had been addicted to food since I was her ageeven youngerin the hopes that I might make her feel less alone, I knew better than to disclose that much to a girl at such an impressionable age.And who knew what kind of eating habits or problems she might have?All I could tell was that she had a negative body image, which was more common than not for teenagers.In the vague, cloudy depths of my memory, I could just barely recall how intense my own warped self image and food obsessions were during puberty, and the thought made me shudder.Good morning, lovely ladies!Julien bounded into the kitchen seemingly out of nowhere.Are you prepared to work?he asked, flashing his winning smile with the boyish gap between his front teeth.I nodded and smiled back, caught off guard by his total ease and familiarity.It was as if I had always been sitting at his kitchen island at breakfast time, like I was an old family friend.You sure youre up for it?Its gonna be a big day!As he addressed me, he playfully sidled up to Cecile at the coffee machine and bumped his hip against hers.Dad, stop it.She sullenly inched away from him, stirring my latte before handing it over.Thanks, I said, despite my desire to hit a pause button and shake this girls shoulders, telling her how lucky she was to have a father like Julien, to have a father at all, and how she should relish these moments because he wouldnt be here forever.And then I remembered that her mother was dead, and I stopped with the petty judgments.Julien made us eggs and toast, and a half hour later, I was following him out the front door.Everything seemed a little strange, like I was observing what was happening from a distance.The impromptu arrangement we had made less than a week agome working for him all summer and living in his backyard, chatting up his daughter at meal timeswas catapulting the three of us into this just add water level of intimacy Id never had with anyone.It was one of those odd situations that overtakes your life every once in a while and in one fell swoop changes everything.Before you know it, you are sucked in by a current that drags you out into the unknown.Sometimes you recognize it at the time; in other cases, you wake up weeks or months later, after the waves have washed you back ashore, to process the unusual chain of events that just rocked your world.In this case, I was aware of the strangeness as it was happening when Julien suggested we bike to work and offered me his dead wifes teal green beach cruiser to ride.Juliens cheerfulness seemed slightly over the top as he handed over the bicycle, as if he was overcompensating for the unbearable sea of grief the bike prompted inside him.Nevertheless, I smiled as I took it from him and hopped on, awkwardly positioning myself on the tan leather seat.I couldnt remember the last time I had been biking.Julien raced onto the street without much warning.In a matter of seconds, I broke into a sweat.I wasnt sturdy, or fast, but I managed to stay a few paces behind him, and after a couple minutes of riding, realized what Julien had said yesterday was truebiking really does clear ones thoughts.As we coasted along the flat, sleepy streets, I started to feel wistful and carefree, something I hadnt been in a long time.Reids campus was located in the absolute center of Oceanside, a beach town whose main business was the college.Even though Juliens house was only a couple of miles from campus, I noticed we were taking a long, circuitous route that wound in and out of several beachside neighborhoods.He seemed to be in no rush to get to the office, but I didnt mind.Every once in a while, he would glance over his shoulder to make sure I was keeping up, and I would smile in assurance.When we passed my old apartment complex, I slowed down, craning for a glimpse of Anjuli, the exchange student who was supposed to have moved into my place the day before, but saw no trace of her.Surprisingly, the sight of the old apartment conjured very little emotion, as if I hadnt lived there for the better part of two years.One of my neighbors, an older lady whom Id never formally met, caught me staring as she retrieved a newspaper from the bottom of the stairs and cocked her head quizzically.Thats when I looked back to the road and realized Julien had already turned a corner.I pedaled fast to catch up to him, losing my breath in the process.It became clear that we were officially avoiding campus when he cut down to the shoreline.We passed by a patch of mangrove trees that tainted the air with their overwhelming smell of sulfur, and I breathed in heartily.A line from Cane, one of the books Julien had assigned, popped into my head and I desperately wanted to impress him by reciting it, something about the sunshine striking a womans mangrove gloomed face like rockets.I made a mental note to mention it later, but first I would have to come up with some reasonable context.In the meantime, I examined Julien from behind, noting how neat and fresh he looked, like just the kind of person who would live in his well decorated house: He had on muted coral linen pants, rolled up at the ankles; an easy white button down; and seemingly unworn white canvas sneakers.Meanwhile, I was wearing my favorite frayed jean shorts, a faded purple tank top, and flip flops.If someone had stopped us for a picture, we would have resembled exactly what we were: the dapper professor with a book deal and his sloppily dressed undergrad internaimless, desperate for a future, fleetingly entangled with a sex addict.* * * Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of spring semester, Gracie had unabashedly studied the face of Dr.Julien Maxwell while he had lectured and I had taken notes for the both of us.She would never shut up about what a specimen he was, but until now, I hadnt bothered to take notice.His face was the perfect balance of round and oval with the large forehead of a thinking man; a medium sized nose, perfectly centered; and big, sleepy eyes that seemed to have something behind them.His skin was a beautiful, warm brown, and the stubble that covered his upper lip, chin, and cheeks a dark black with flecks of silvery gray to match his close cropped hair.Definitely not my typeprofessors, as I saw them, were all surrogate fathers of some sort, no matter how youngbut I could see the appeal.The day we took our bike ride to campus, we didnt end up on campus at all.Instead, Julien led me to a beachside dive bar called Salty Sals, a derelict structure somewhere between roadhouse and shack that I hadnt stopped to notice in my entire four years of living here.He hadnt explained where we were going at any point, and I hadnt bothered to ask.We arrived sometime before noon, after an hour long journey that left my thighs feeling wobbly and unstable.No need to panic.Procrastination is a part of my process, he announced, putting a hand out for the beach cruiser after chaining his bike to a rusted white railing that ran between the parking lot and the beach.I followed Julien inside the bar and found the kind of scene one would expect to find at a small town dive at noon on a weekday: two sloppy, middle aged men sitting at opposite ends of the bar, drinking the same beer out of cans, and situated between them, a fifty something bartender who looked like she knew her way around an eighteen wheeler.Harsh shafts of sunlight snuck in through a couple of high set, rectangular windows, but the space remained ironically dark and depressing for being practically on the beach.I couldnt believe Julien actually liked this place, but it was apparent he did.I imagined him spending a lot of time here since his wifes passing, a likely guess according to the bartenders somber yet empathetic greeting: a knowing wink and a shot glass filled with tequila.Julien winked back.One for my friend, too, please.Without looking at me, she poured the shot and, although I scrambled for my drivers license, served it to me without question.I whispered to Julien that it was the first time in my life I hadnt been carded.Thanks, Arlene.Julien smiled as he raised his shot glass and nodded for me to do the same.Thanks, Arlene, I repeated, eliciting a snaggletoothed smile from our stoic host.Clinking glasses, Julien and I downed the shots, grimaced in unison, then picked up the mugs that Arlene had wordlessly placed before us and chased the fiery liquor with cold beer.You ever been here?he asked.No.Im not sure I knew it existed, I said.I was trying not to make a face, but my throat burned badly from the shot.I glanced around at the framed photographs of caught fish on the walls, the inoperative jukebox collecting dust in the corner, an abandoned checkers game set up on one of the small tables.I was as intrigued by my surroundings as if I had been viewing the Coliseum for the first time and realized the effect Julien had on this commonplace, foul smelling bar just by walking into it.Much like the smelly mangrove trees had struck me this morning, for the first time, as magical literary references instead of rotten egg purveyors, Juliens scholarly presence turned Salty Sals into some sweet little place Hemingway might have frequented.The truth is, I brought you here because I think a little bonding is in order if were going to be working together all summer.That and, like I said, my process involves a necessary amount of procrastination.Dont tell Cecile.I whipped my hand past my lips as if I was zipping them shut.Of course not!I said.I dont want to be a bad influence.Ive got future professors of America to impress here.He gestured to me before taking another swig of beer.Oh, I dont know about that, I demurred.Really?You strike me as an academic.Didnt you say your parents were professors?No, not in the least!I could feel myself beaming at the mere suggestion.It was entirely off base, but also possibly the most flattering thing Id ever heard.Suddenly, I wanted to be Juliens vision of me: the budding professor, hailing from a long line of the same.He sipped his beer and trained his eyes on me.So tell me about yourself.Where are you from?Whats your story?He punctuated his questions with pursed lips and an intense stare, and I couldnt tell if he was being sincere or ironic.Actually, it was a mystery to me whether or not he possessed a sense of humor at allI certainly hadnt detected it in his lectures.Im not that interesting.Id rather hear about you, I deflected.No, no, no.Tell me.This is part of your job.The hard part, I hope.You dont like talking about yourself?Thats strange.I find most of my students are particularly fond of that pastime.He smiled and cocked his head just so, and I decided that yes, he had a sense of humoralbeit a subtle, professorial one.He also had a way with words; everything he said sounded premeditated, direct, precise.It made me self conscious about my own way of speaking, which was clumsy and stilted in comparison.I dont like talking about myself to a fault, probably.I blushed on cue.Simply being honest about that fact made me feel shythe mark of a true introvert.Well, what if I guess where your family is?Eagle Grove, Iowa.And the Philippines.And thats where my story ends.I patted the bar in a demonstrative way that accidentally signaled Arlene to get us more shots.Brace yourself for another round.Julien raised his eyebrows as she poured more tequila into our shot glasses.He raised his second shot and waited for me to do the same.Cheers, he said, but not until after he had downed the liquor.Cheers.I tried to match Juliens enthusiasm but balked at the smell of the tequila as it neared my nose.I took a tiny sip and set the shot down.You know, this spring was my first semester back since being on leave, and I worry it was too soon.Everybody seemed tuned out, like I was boring them.No way!I said, even though the truth was Juliens lectures had had their ups and downs.Some days he had seemed on the verge of tears, and not because he was so moved by the literature.But on others, I could glimpse the kind of teacher he really waspassionate, insightful, engaging.Your class was the most interesting lit class Ive ever taken, I assured him, my hand held up in oath.I swear.Did you know what happened?About the accident?Angling to face me, he propped his elbow up on the bar and rested his cheek on a tightly balled fist.Everybody seemed to know.No, I didnt, I said.At first I didnt know.But Gracie knew about it.She told me.Im so sorry.I started to reach for him but stopped myself.Its okay.He shook his head, as if trying to shake off the unshakeable memory that his wife had been senselessly murdered by a drunk driver.I needed to get back to work.I needed that structure.What I didnt need were all the pained looks on peoples faces when they asked me how I was doing, all the reminders that they were there if I needed a shoulder to cry on.I think grieving people are like cats, you know?We dont want to talk if you show the slightest interest.Taking another sip of tequila, I thought of the Toomer quote Id wanted to recite to Julien earlier but realized it had zero relevance here.What could I say that would make me sound erudite and compassionate all at once?What was that Toni Morrison quote?I said.Something about there being no words for pain Julien looked both happy and sad.Exactly.Two hours and three beers later, he had all but told me his entire life story while I had sat stoically, peppering in a literary reference every once in a while and trying to mask my incredulity at this level of confidence he had bestowed upon me.Again, it was the just add water intimacy that had made me feel like some not so distant relative at breakfast that morning, come to stay with her uncle and cousin for the summer.He shared the story of how he and his wife, Renay, had first met as teenagers, explaining that she came from a wealthy New Orleans family while he had been raised by a single mother in D. C.  who, like mine, had worked late hours in a low paying job.They had been married at twenty four and had Cecile even younger.He had gone to Brown on scholarship, then NYU, and had been slightly disappointed when forced to take tenure at Reid instead of somewhere more prestigious, because it was the only school that had offered professorships to both him and his wife.He had described to me his own version of the stages of grief, which went something like denial, inexplicable laughter, explicable rage, depression, anger, depression again, and, finally, a slight upgrade to general melancholy.He had seemed on the verge of tears when he had gripped my wrist for a brief second and insisted that life was too short for anything but absolute truth.Then suddenly, regaining his inhibitions, he had bummed a cigarette from one of the barflies and led me across the parking lot in the direction of a taco stand hed promised was hands down the best.I tried to make sense of what had just happened as we stood before the RV on the other side of the parking lot with two taciturn Mexican women inside awaiting our orders.Julien puffed on his bummed cigarette and pointed out his favorite items on the menu painted on the side of the truck.With my blessing, he ordered for both of us and paid in cash before leading me to a bench on the sidewalk where we ate our tacos while looking out at the ocean.The food was almost too spicy, but I relished it.Again, the Julien effect.I felt like I belonged here, sitting on a bench with a true mentor, someone open and honest and as smart as I could ever hope to be, who would steer me toward a better future.Thanks for listening in there, he said after a bout of silence.I nodded once, my eyes on the ocean.Thanks for trusting me, I said.Sitting up straight, his energy shifted back to intense enthusiasm for the day as he clapped his hands together, crumpling his empty taco wrappers and rolling them into a ball.So!We need to stop by my office for a couple of minutes at least.That way, we have an alibi.Julien stood up from the bench and I saluted him, prompting him to laugh heartily, as if it were an inside joke wed already established: Julien as drill sergeant, me as devoted recruit.He either thought I was very funny or the tequila shots were still working their magic.As we headed back across the parking lot, he reached out and patted my shoulder, a chaste, fatherly gesture that somehow turned my thoughts to Liam, who had touched my shoulders the night before in quite the opposite waylustfully, proprietarily.At the spa where I had worked up until the fall of last year, my jet setter boss Sasha Myers was always repeating clichs about men.Creatures of conquest, she would call them.Once youve kissed, barring any major mishaps, they will not stop until theyve sealed the deal.A man once tracked me down from Alaska because our one night stand had been interrupted.Five thousand miles he flew!Im telling you they will find you and they will finish you off, she would tell single customers, throwing an extra sample of eye cream into their bag with a wink and a thumbs up.She liked to repeat this story in particular; over time, I had realized that it was really just a pep talk for herself, a twice divorced woman still chasing the thrill of romance.However, thinking about Liam, I wanted to believe that Sasha had been right.Deep down, I wanted him to find me and, whatever the emotional fallout might be, finish me off.Five The rest of the week flew past in a haze.Every morning I awoke, joined Cecile and Julien for breakfast, then biked with him to the office, where we spent seven or eight hours working diligently, Julien typing away at his computer while I filed, sorted, collated, stapledmonotonous tasks that were oddly soothing.Every night before going to sleep I noticed whether or not his light was still on, as his bedroom window was visible from mine.If it was on, I imagined he was still working, keeping his mind off the empty half of his bed.I tried to take a page from his playbook and work hard enough every day so that I was too exhausted to lie awake and think about Liam at night, but I failed.A community of butterflies had taken up a permanent residence in my stomach, and any downtime that I had was devoted to rehashing that night at the restaurant, wondering what would happen if I ever saw him again.I came to see Juliens office as a protective bubble, the only place where thoughts of Liam couldnt penetrate my mind.We mostly sat in silencehim hovering over his laptop and me alternating between the uncomfortable wooden chair across from his desk and a patch of floor, reorganizing and flagging piles of research.Sometimes I found myself staring at one of his packed bookshelves and dreaming of what it would be like to be a respected professor like him but finding it impossible to envision myself that way.The more I witnessed Juliens quiet, brilliant, sequestered life, the more the idea of working in the rarefied world of academia became.The best I could hope for from this experience would be to come out of it a little more culturally astute, if just by osmosis.Our bike rides to and from work were also quiet, as were shared mealtimes at the house, when Cecile did most of the talking.The lack of conversation was refreshing to me, because whenever I did speak, I caught myself trying a little too hard to please, sometimes bordering on pretention with my attempts to sound perceptive and well read.However I was coming across seemed to be working, though.At the end of my first week, Julien granted me the privilege of reading the first chapter of his book and I did so under his watchful eye, my red pen hovering over the printed pages but finding no errors to mark.When I was done, I only offered one criticismto strike the last line of an annotationand he thanked me so profusely, you would think I had carefully edited the whole thing.I wish I were you, said Gracie when I called her that Friday after work.You should see the middle aged bums in my office.Julien Maxwell puts them all to shame.I see what youre saying, objectively.But you know meIm working on making him the father I never had.Im even warming to the idea of having a bratty little sister.Did I tell you she makes me coffee in the morning?Yes, its a real blended family scene youve got going over there.Maybe Im just trying to fill the Gracie sized hole in my heart since you left.So hows D. C. ?So far so good.I mean, aside from the irony that Im working for an organic foods lobby and microwaving half my meals.But its good to be in a city.You should come visit!You know me, Oceansides got all the excitement I can handle.Plus, Im broke.Yeah, yeah, yeah.Well, do me a favor.Give Julien a big fat sloppy father daughter kiss for me?Ew, ew, ew.Or find somebody to crush over.I need to live vicariously.I got nothing doing here.Kay, Ill do my best, I said.Love you, gotta crash.Love you too.I heard Gracie sigh on the other end as we hung up.She still had no idea about Liam, and at this point, I wasnt sure why I hadnt fessed up.Perhaps because I knew she would only fuel the fire, when I really should be forgetting all about him.Of course, as someone great once said, Best laid plans and all that  * * * You need to eat, I instructed Isabella as she rocked on her wicker patio chair, puffing the new e cigarette she had spent the last ten minutes extolling.The first time I had met her had been on this very same porch, when as a freshman I had come to her retirement community with one of my Nutrition professors who was running a gardening program there.I had helped Isabella start a thriving tomato garden on her porch, which she had proceeded to neglect that summer when I had gone home to Iowa.When I got back, it had made me secretly happy to know how much I was needed.Ever since, Ive made weekly visits in which I cook her a weeks worth of meals.These are the best crab cakes I have ever made.I propped up my empty plate as evidence, trying to coax her to put down the nicotine.They have capers!You love capers!Just let me have this first.You know Im very excited to try your food, always, she said in her heavy Austrian accent.If I had to guess, Id say you havent been eating enough.Not true!You saweverything you made me last week is gone.Fertig.How do I know you didnt just throw it in the trash?Because I can describe to you in detail just how succulent and perfectly seasoned the roast beef was and tell you all the ways in which I ate itin sandwiches, heated up with the savory mashed cauliflower, in a box, with a fox.Im just saying, you seem like youve lost weight.Thats your opinion.Isabella, I worry about you, I said.And I did.Just as I had a penchant for gaining five or ten pounds every once in a while, she tended to lose that much, and whenever she did, she got a little wild eyed and defensive.I had to think there was a history of disordered eating behind all of her jokes about having a discerning palate and needing to get ready for bikini season.Tell me more about this nymphomaniac, she said, eyeing me mischievously.Even though I hadnt planned it, I had broken down and told her about Liam the minute I had walked in.Well, hes bad news, obviously, I said.You dont sound so convinced.Theres something about Australian men, the good looking ones anyway.I knew an Australian years ago.Race car driver.Formula One.Biggest schwanz I ever saw.I rolled my eyes and noticed Isabellas next door neighbor, Melvin, waving from his own screened in porch.I waved back and nudged her to do the same but she ignored me.Why arent you nicer to Melvin?I think he likes you.Isabella closed her eyes and shook her head.No way.Why?Is it because hes Jewish?I said.Ha!Isabella took a long drag from her e cigarette and blew out a cool wisp of steam.Thats what it is.Youre somehow devoutly Catholic and I never knew it.Cant date a man outside the church?I was mostly teasing, but after four years of knowing her, I had learned that Isabella was a walking paradox, a sort of deranged mash up of Elizabeth Taylor, Jackie Kennedy, and Miss Havisham; the likelihood of her being a Freedom Rider or part of the Hitler Youth were about the same.Darling, Ive sampled the rainbowrace, religion, creed, whatever that means.Dont be a twit.Whats the Australians name again?Liam.Oh yes, Liam.Hes got the restaurant I likenot surprisingly, Isabella was a big fan of Trio, just like my old bossand your little rendezvous was interrupted by the waitress?Well, sort of.I had lied to Isabella about running out of the restaurant.It had been hard enough for me to talk about in the first place, and certainly the truththat I had aborted the mission the minute we kissedwas not going to impress her.So I fudged the story a little, saying that a waitress, there to pick up her paycheck, had interrupted our tryst.Then I think you have to see him again, no?He sounds like a good time.And very good looking.He is good looking.Hes about eighty thousand miles out of my league good looking.Pfft.She shook her head.You kissed, it was good, who cares?I just dont think getting involved with a sex addict is a good idea.Id feel like a drug dealer giving heroin to a junkie low grade heroin.And then one day he would wake up and realize how much better he could do when the supermodel down the street offered him way better stuff, and then Id be screwed.He would change dealers, break my heart, end of story.Nonsense!
