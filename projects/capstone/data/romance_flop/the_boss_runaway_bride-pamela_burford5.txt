No ones ever made me a birthday cake.Even his mother used to order them from the bakery.He stared into her blue violet eyes and she stared back, and something arced between them that stung his eyes and closed his throat, and damn it, he had to pull himself together fast.With a gentle smile she said, Then its about time, isnt it?and he knew she saw it all, saw his struggle and his raw open soul, saw the wonder and bafflement he couldnt hide, and it was okay.This was Molly and it was okay.He exhaled a fierce breath as if hed run a race.He smiled and reached for the cake plate, knowing his hands trembled and not really caring if she noticed.Wow.This is so...Is that a circus train?The cake was a bit lopsided, slathered in chocolate butter cream.A jittery Happy Birthday Quinn had been lovingly executed in yellow icing by someone presumably in the throes of the DTs.The candles were burning low and listing in opposite directions.And along the perimeter was a tiny, colorful candy train, complete with cagelike boxcars occupied by grinning circus animals.Molly adjusted the caboose.Yes, it is.They had a limited selection at the Pay and Weep, she said, referring to the local convenience store, Park and Shop.It was either this or clowns.Thank you.A choo choo train is much more dignified.Blow out the candles.Oh!Make a wish first!He felt an absurd kind of panic for an instant.What should he wish for?Then he smiled at his idiocy and closed his eyes and made a wish.A modest wish as birthday wishes went, with no dollar signs attached.He blew out the candles.She fiddled with her hair.Its not from scratch.I used, you know, a mix.Its perfect, Molly.I smelled it coming in and wondered what you were baking.Im not very artistic.She gestured to the wobbly words inscribed on the cake.The writing  I love the writing.I love the whole thing.He stepped back to allow her to enter.Listen, come in.Let me get a couple of plates.She took a few tentative steps inside as he carried the cake into the kitchen.She said, I really only meant to drop it off.You dont have to  I have ice cream, too, he called.Butter pecan.This is shaping up to be a regular birthday party.Did you pick up any of those little Cone Head hats?She appeared in the arched entrance to the kitchen, looking more beautiful than hed ever seen her, with her long, sun streaked hair loose around her bare shoulders and wearing a tender, almost shy little smile.She shook her head at his question.He dragged two small plates out of a cupboard.Noisemakers?She shook her head again, her smile growing.He sighed in mock disappointment.I dont know, Molly.What kind of a party are we talking about here?No noisemakers.No Pin the Tail on the Donkey.He drew the carton of ice cream out of the bag and pried off the lid.Grinning now, Molly leaned her shoulder against the archway.Her folded arms pushed up her breasts just enough to make spectacular things happen in the V neck of her dress.Quinn had seen her stark naked, so why did the sight of a little cleavage suddenly turn him stupid?He strained to recall what hed been doing.Forks.Right.Spoons, bowls, napkins.Coffee?he asked.Too late for me.Do you have decaf?Sorry, just high test.Arent you afraid itll keep you up all night?In his current frame of mind, being up all night was not an entirely unwelcome prospect.Not if his housemate was somewhere in the equation.Never bothers me, he said, but I wont brew a pot if its just for me.Why dont you cut the cake while I put on some party music.I vote for the Supremes.A few minutes later he was tucking into the huge slab of cake Molly had served him.They sat across from each other at the plastic draped dining table listening to Diana Ross and company warn them to stop!in the name of love.So I give up, he said.How did you find out its my birthday?I called Cindy at the agency.Cindy?Oh, the office manager.She checked your personnel file and gave me your date of birth.Thirty!Thats a very important milestone, Quinn.It deserves to be celebrated.He thought about that.If anything deserves to be celebrated, its the fact that I attained the goals I set for myselfthe things I wanted to accomplish by age thirty.He grimaced.My current employment status notwithstanding.So by goals, you mean career goals.He shrugged.You achieve those, the rest falls into place.The rest being...You have to ask?Money.Filthy lucre.And all the stuff it gets you.Thats the material side, she said.What about personal goals?Its all related.When youve achieved a certain status in your chosen profession, the rest follows, like I said.Including the respect and esteem of others.Molly licked her ice cream spoon clean.So...the higher your professional status, the more money you make, the more friends you have?He said, You have ice cream on your nose, and watched her impish smile disappear as she glanced at her nose cross eyed.Her tongue flicked out in a futile attempt to lick off the ice cream, and Quinns body responded as though shed found the on off switch.Shrugging good naturedly, she resorted to the prosaic solution of a paper napkin, but the damage had been done.The image of that supple pink tongue straining with single minded intent had found a permanent home in the brain wrinkle occupied by tenacious commercial jingles and Embarrassing Moments.Hed carry it to the grave.Quinn pushed away his plate and leaned back in his chair.Im going to ask you something, he said, pretty certain hed regret it.Then again, maybe not.This wasnt the shallow, uncomplicated Molly he thought hed met nearly two weeks earlier.This wasnt the heartless Molly whom Phil had described to him in unloving detail.That woman wouldnt have shrugged off Quinns insulting brush offs day after day.She wouldnt have given him a tour of the night sky with saintlike patience.She certainly wouldnt have gone to the trouble of ferreting out his birthday and making him a cake.Shed made him a cake.He still couldnt get over it.The bigness of her heart and her unreserved joie de vivre left him in awe.She propped her elbows on the table, then rested her chin on her laced fingers, waiting.He asked, Why did you walk out on your wedding?Five   SHE JUST STARED at him for the longest time, and he braced himself for anything from tears to hilarity.Finally she sat up, dropped her hands into her lap, and smiled wanly.When I tell you, you might still see things Phils way.Its not exactly a black and white issue.Not much in life is.What happened?You were at the church, he prompted.In your Cinderella gown.She took a deep breath.I was waiting in the room set aside for the bride.Nervous, you know.Happy but nervous.Like all brides, I guess.My sister Toni was with me.She was my matron of honor.It was time for the wedding to start and Phil knocked on the door.I didnt want him to, you know, see the dress beforehand, but he said it was important and he came in with his brother Ron and this friend of his, Jim.What did he want?A last minute detail, he said, something that had to be taken care of before we could get married.He handed me this document to sign.It was a contract, all legal.He didnt use the words prenuptial agreement, he called it an understanding.Wait a minute.Quinn sat up straight.He presents you with a prenup right when youre about to walk down the aisle?She nodded.He said it was his lawyers idea, that if it was up to him, he wouldnt bother, but his lawyer was real insistent.Ron and Jim were there to witness our signatures.I asked Phil why he hadnt shown this to me before.He said there were these unavoidable delays and his lawyer had just given him the paperwork that morning right there at the church.I didnt know what to make of this story, so I turned to his brother.The guy who taught you to bluff in poker.Right.Ron was my friend.A decent guy.Anyway, I know what his poker face looks like and I saw it then.I saw him making this heroic effort to support his brother.But as I stared at him, really made him look me in the eye, he gave it up and kind of looked away, ashamed.Thats when  Her voice broke, and a jolt of alarm shot through Quinn.Hed never seen her anything but unflappable.She said hoarsely, Thats when I knew Phil was lying.Shoving that contract in my face at the very last minute was a calculated tactic.He thought Id cave in and sign it.I mean, the church was packed, I could hear the guests in the sanctuary, the organ music.We had this whole huge reception planned and paid for, honeymoon reservations, the works.Mollys lower lip trembled, though her words were spoken calmly.Gently Quinn asked, What did you do?I told Phil I couldnt possibly sign a contract like that without having a lawyer look at it.And no, I didnt happen to have one there at the church like he did.He said there was no time, it had to be signed before we could get married.What were the terms of the contract?As if he couldnt guess.It was totally in his favorbig surprise.If we divorced, even if it was after something like forty years, Id walk away only with whatever I brought into the marriage.Which is, like, my toothbrush, right?I wouldnt have been entitled to any assets accumulated during the marriage since he was going to be the breadwinner.You werent going to work, then?Not outside the home.Phil and I wanted to start a family right away, and we both agreed I should stay home and raise the kids, manage the house and all thatwhich, let me tell you, is just as important a contribution to the family unit as his income.But if we divorced, under his contract my years of hard work would count for nothing.No lawyer would let you sign a one sided contract like that, Molly.Phil got kind of nasty when I balked.I guess he thought Id knuckle under right away.I mean, I know Im easygoing, but lets get real!Quinn chewed back a grin.Hed wondered how Molly would react in a crisis.It appeared hed just found out.She said, Thats when he dropped all the pretense and said sign it now or the weddings off.And you walked.Admiration for Molly swelled within him like a balloon.I asked Toni for the keys to her car, asked her to stay and explain the whole thing to Mom and Dad.Then I just turned around and walked out the back way, head held high and all that.She added proudly, He never saw me shed a tear.Which didnt mean there hadnt been plenty of them, Quinn guessed, watching her blink back the glaze of moisture in her eyes.He was beginning to realize Phils treachery affected her more deeply than she wanted to let on, even to herself.At the same time Quinn marveled at the inner strength and self respect that had allowed her to stand up to the son of a bitch.Just chock full of surprises, his Mellow Molly.Why did you say that, he asked, about how I might still see things Phils way once I heard your story?Im not sure how to take that.I only meant, you know, since the two of you have so much in common.She brought the candy locomotive to her mouth and sucked off the frosting that clung to it.Wait a minute.Quinn made a time out T with his hands.We have so much in common?Me and that...that...No offense, she said.No offense!Would you care to elaborate?Molly obligingly ticked off the similarities on her fingers.Youre both in advertising.Both go getters.Successful.Ambitious.Material interests are everything.She started on her other hand.Nothing stands in the way of your goals.Personal relationships are an extension of your professional life.Dark hair.German car.Swell shoulders.She wiggled her ten fingers.My calculators run out of batteries.Oh yeah, you wear the same vacation uniform.Polo shirts and khakis.Very dress down Friday.Well, thatsthats just great!Quinn sputtered.Do you disagree with any of that?She reached across the table to paw through the debris on his plate.Wheres the caboose?Did you eat it?Can you stick to one subject at a time?No, I dont disagree with your comparison as far as it goes, but theres a lot more to me than material interests and...and...Swell shoulders.My Mercedes.Id never do to any woman what Phil did to you.Oh, I know that, Quinn.Gosh.I dont think you guys are clones or anything.Well, all right.Youd give your bride plenty of time to look over the prenup.He would?
