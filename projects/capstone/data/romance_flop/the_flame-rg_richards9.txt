She thought long and hard.Ill tell you later, dinner time.I want to try the rack of lamb, but I dont want it all.The homemade ravioli with the broccoli and cauliflower sounds good.And for dessert ...maybe the black forest cake.How about you?Um, Im not sure yet.The server returned, Ready?Robert squished his nose.For the lady, she will have the homemade ravioli with broccoli and cauliflower.I will have the rack of lamb with green beans and then for dessert we will both have the black forest cake.Very good, sir.Would you care for something to drink with your meal?May I suggest a red wine or perhaps a Merlot?The red wine, please, said Mary.Very well, I will be back shortly.She took their menus and went to the kitchen to place their orders.Hungry?asked Robert.Im getting there.You and Jerry were really successful?Yes, everything went according to plan.It was a good day for everyone in the markets.Robert studied her face for a moment and saw tension.Whats the matter?You look like something is bothering you.My girls are still fighting.Its quieting down now but they are still at it and it bothers me.I always feel as if it is my job to play referee and bridge the gap.That must get exhausting over time?Yes, it does.Thinking about them brought a smile to her face.They are so much alike it is scary.They are like these two little kids, two sisters who get mad when the other wears their clothes.Her smile broadened.I love my girls but they have serious issues.Do they know how lucky they are to have you?I doubt it.They think they are like night and day but it isnt truebirds of a feather.What about you and Jerry?Robert lowered his head for a moment.Jerry is complicated but simple to a fault.We were college roommates and at first could not stand each other.Over time we looked out for each other and graduated.I think I told you some of this before?Mary nodded.Jerry is not a bad guy but he is typical.He likes strip clubs, fast cars, fast women, and money.He gets in trouble and I always come to the rescue, so I know how tiring it can be.We have been through several years of struggle together.We work well together and keep each other motivated.Rhonda returned to the table with the drinks.This is a 1968 bottle from the houses reserve.She showed them the bottle and label and poured them a glass.She then left the bottle and went to get their meals.To friends who wear us out, drive us crazy, but without whom we may never have met.To good friends, said Robert.He clinks glasses with Mary.Mary took only a sip.Hmm, that is good.Have you ever thought of keeping one of the friends and letting the other go?A rush of heat made her take a deeper sip.No, I could never choose between them.Jill and Barb are one in the same as far as I am concerned.Heat rose throughout her face just thinking about it.Could you get rid of Jerry?Well, that is not quite the same thing.You have two good girlfriends and you have stated that they are interchangeable.I only have one close male friend.If I got rid of him I would be alone.Mary bristled at the words, redness filled her cheeks to mix with the heat already there.Before she knew it, words rushed out of her blazing with fire.I never said theyre interchangeable.I said they are similar, birds of a feather.That means that they dont recognize how similar they are because they are too busy battling each other.I could never get rid of one of my friends and cant believe you had the nerve to ask that!Mary grabbed and upturned the remaining liquid left in her glass.She reached for the bottle and filled her glass to the top and took another gulp, half emptying the glass.Robert watched in silence, picking up his glass to pretend all was well.Rhonda returned with their meals.Rhonda, I didnt know the rack of lamb would be this big.Could you bring me a sharp knife and another plate, please?Yes, sir.Ill be back in a second.Rhonda returned posthaste to place the items on the table by Robert.Enjoy your meal.Robert sliced off a portion, then placed it on the empty plate by Mary.The lamb looks delicious.He said to no one in particular and began eating.Mary, filled with remorse, stuffed something in her mouth, hoping to choke on it.She ate in silence chewing over her words in her mind.How could she be so stupid?Surely he regretted ever asking her out.How could she be so stupid?She continued to berate herself while forcing herself to eat.She would only stop to drink, unaware she was on her third glass while he remained on his first.Mary put her fork down and looked at her silent partner.Bob.She called his name and waited for him to lift up his head and look at her.Im sorry for my rudeness.I dont know what came over me and made me speak to you in that fashion.Please forgive me.I hope I havent spoiled the evening for you?Tears pooled in her eyes.She didnt want to cry and make him think less of her.She fought as hard as she possibly could and looked him in his mocha eyes, waiting for a response.Robert put his fork down.Mary, my night is going perfect and I am happy to be here with you and you alone.He gave his best reassuring smile.Mary burst into tears.She covered her face with her napkins to hide but in the process doused herself with red sauce from her ravioli.Robert rushed to pat her shoulder.She pushed him away directing him to take his seat.She stemmed the tide of tears then wiped her face.You are too good to me and I dont know why.I dont know what came over me.Mary said the words but deep down she knew the truth.The two mini bottles she drank back in her office flashed through her mind.They were supposed to calm her nerves and steady her for this date.Mary thought about how she wanted to make a good impression but was blowing it all to hell.She tried to fight the urge to take another sip of her drink and lost the fight.She reached for the glass and before she could scold herself further, she drank it down.Robert surreptitiously watched Mary but kept eating.Try the lamb, it tastes fantastic.Go on, try a piece, I would like your opinion.Mary pushed her ravioli to the side and sat the plate of lamb before her.She cut a piece and tried it.Hmm this is good.Good.Try some of the bread with it.Grab a big slice, it helps it go down better.Mary continued to eat the lamb.Robert gave her another piece with more buttered bread.After she finished, she went back to her ravioli.These are great.Would you care to try one?Robert tried one.Mary waited for a reaction.Umm, they are indeed yummy.Madame has great taste.He gestured as if tipping his hat to her.Mary smiled and ate more of her ravioli.Robert finished his lamb and worked on his bowl of green beans.How are they?A little dry, but excellent.He smiled at Mary.You picked a great place for dinner.Thank you, I always wanted to try it.My friends think it is too pricey so they will never come with me.Good, said Robert.That means I will be the only one who will have the pleasure of bringing you to this fine establishment.I hope you will agree to come back here with me again soon.They have a large menu and I would like to sample some of their unusual offerings.I would be honored to come back with you.Mary flushed.She thought she had made the ultimate mistake and now Robert would see through her and reject her.She was glad to be wrong.Rhonda returned.If you are both finished, we will serve your dessert on the terrace.She pointed to a pair of curtains.Robert could see tables between the curtains and the night sky above.Thank you, we are finished.He stood, offering Mary his arm.They walked between the curtains to hear a different kind of music playing on the terrace.What is that playing?asked Mary, knowing the music, but needing something to say.Idiot, she said under her breath, hoping Robert did not hear her.Whether he heard her or not he gave no indication.Sounds like a samba.Can you do any of the Latin dances?No, Im afraid not.I always wanted to learn a few dances like Samba or Fox Trot but never found the time.They walked to a table and sat down.Rhonda brought them small plates and a man wheeled out a cart with desserts on it.He picked up the black forest cake and sat it on the edge of the table and picked up a knife.A big piece for the lady and a smaller one for me, said Robert.The man placed cake on each plate, bowed, then turned and wheeled his cart to another table.Mary made no move for her cake.Would you care for something else for dessert, Mary?No, this is fine.I am just admiring the cake.This is a specialty of my mothers.She is proud of how well she can make it.In fact, she has won two blue ribbons at the county fair for her cake.Mary picked up her fork to try a piece.This is good.Is it better than your mothers?Mary thought for a moment and then took another bite.This is better.Your mother doesnt have access to top ingredients.I am pretty sure some of them are from overseas.He tried to make her feel better, not knowing if she was upset or not.Well, that is true.She took another bite.Are you mad at me about earlier?I havent thought about it anymore.Dont waste time on the negative, Mary.Life is too short.I enjoy your company and truly look forward to when we can do this again.Mary laughed.Be careful what you wish for.Booty traps are a specialty of the devil.Robert laughed loudly.You mean booby traps dont you?He kept laughing.No, I said it correctly, booty traps.She pointed her finger at Robert and said sternly as if giving a warning.Beware of women who come in nicely wrapped packages, for they are the devil incarnate.Laughter covered a beet red face.Robert laughed with her, enjoying her sense of humor.When Mary let her guard down she was the perfect woman.She could joke or spar with him and he would be just as happy to be in her presence.Ill take my chances.He winked.Bob, what do you do when you are not playing the markets?I have several projects in the area to keep me busy.His short answer didnt spark more conversation so he added more details.I own the car wash over on 189th street by Publix.I am also working on a land deal with some college friends who are in the hotel business.They want me to be a partner but I am not sure if I want to be tied down yet.Are you afraid of commitments?Mary asked.Robert sensed where she was going.I have no problems with commitments; I always take care of mine.I am just not always sure of the other party.Perhaps the other party believes you might not come through at a crucial moment and leave them holding the bag.I have never run out on a commitment.Even when it is difficult I see it through until the end.I just need partners who will do the same.Mary took another bite of her cake.If your partner proves untrustworthy do you let them know right away or do you keep silent and secretly look for the opportunity to get out?I believe communication is always the key to any type of relationship.If a partner talks to me, I believe we can solve any problem.Its the secrets that destroy a good partnership.Robert took the last bite of his cake.I agree.The problem is that most people find that out after sinking a good partnership.Do you always sense when a partnership is going south?In business I have found it wise to give partners a wide berth.That way there is always room to negotiate a peace before things get too far out of hand.And if the no peace can be negotiated, do you give up?I never give up on a deal.I fight to the end.I believe that with communication and patience that any partnership can be saved.Most times I end up losing but I know in my heart that I did all that I could.Robert studied her confused face for a moment.Would you care for a walk?Robert stood, extending his arm to her.Yes.Mary took his arm and they walked down steps to the street.They were on Collins Avenue and walked south of the Belmont Hotel.They passed by several people and listened to the hustle and bustle of the highway.Robert led her to a shop.They entered Donovans Antique Shoppe and looked around.Mary watched Robert as he stared at a water globe.Robert held the globe up for Mary to see.Do you like these?Theyre okay.Ive always liked them.Not the new ones but the older snow globe type.I love to shake them up and imagine I am there watching the snow fall.That reminds me, have you always lived here in Miami?No.But I have always lived in Florida.My family came from a small town in South Carolina and settled here.I was born here three years later.Do you have brothers and sisters?Yes, one of each.Are they near here?Yes.Mary played with the snow globe not sure of whether she should give long answers or short answers.She was attracted to Robert but frightened as well, unsure of the reason why.Are you ready to call it a night?Mary put the globe down.I guess so.Are you ready?Yes, Mary, lets get you home so you can rest.They walked out the store and Robert offered Mary his arm.Robert walked her to the door of the Belmont.Well, I had a good time with you tonight, Mary.I hope we can do it again real soon.He bent and lightly kissed Mary on the forehead.Good night, Mary.Good night, Bob.Mary walked into the hotel and went straight to her office.She sat behind her desk and opened the desk drawer.She pulled out another mini bottle and drank it down.Mary closed her eyes and leaned back in her chair.She went over all her mistakes and threw herself a small pity party.19: Girl with a Plan      The next morning the computers went down as Barbara prepared to check in several guests.Oh my god, not again.She tried to reboot with no luck.She stared at the blank screen and closed her eyes and thought, what now?Barbara opened her eyes and sprang into action.Please, may I have your attention?She said to the line of six waiting guests.Please have a seat in the lobby area.Our computers are down and I am going to have to check you in by hand until we can fix the problem.She motioned behind them.Please have a seat and I will be with you shortly.Barbara got on the phone to call Mary but she was not in.She then walked out the doors and down the hallway.Barbara saw the housekeepers cart in a doorway and went toward the room.She looked inside and saw Jill in a maids uniform making one of the two beds in the room.Jill, she knocked on the door and waited for her to look up at her.I need your help in the lobby.I am checking in several guests and the computers are all down.Mary said whenever it happened again to come and get you to help me check in the guests by hand.Im a maid, not an office worker, said Jill with a harsh tone and look.I dont care what you are; I need your help right now.Albert is running an errand for Mrs.Belmont and will be back in three hours, until then, you are what I have to work with.If you refuse to come and help me thats your ass, not mine.Ill be in the lobby, if I dont see you in five minutes, clock out and go home because youre finished.Barbara strolled out without giving Jill a chance to respond.There was no time to argue.She found the clipboard from before and searched for rooms on the ground floor.Jill dragged herself to the front and walked up to Barbara.She hated working up front and hated talking to people about their silly problems and complaints.She loved the quiet and peace of making beds and cleaning rooms.No headaches.Bound and determined not to let Barbara have the upper hand, she waited in silence, scowling for all she was worth.Barbara said nothing.All right, damn it, Jill whispered through gritted teeth.Tell me what the hell you want so I can get out of here.Barbara, a champion of quiet mouse, broke into a sly smile.Take these four couples to rooms on the first floor.She gave Jill a clipboard and small yellow envelopes.Check the rooms and make sure they are clean and give them their room keys.Let them know that these are temporary rooms until we get our computers back up and running and then we will put them in their correct rooms.Smile and be polite, Jill.You are representing the Belmont, not me.Fine, is there anything besides this that I have to do?No, that will take care of it all.With any luck, the computers will be back up and running soon.Thank you for helping.Jill looked at her clipboard.She gave the senior citizens a death scowl.Mr.and Mrs.Browerdom?She waited for a response.That would be us, she heard a man with a strong British accent say.A couple rose to her right.We are the Browerdoms; we have been sitting on our arses for days.By Joseph and sweet Mother Mary, are our flats ready?Jill hid her face, rolling her eyes.She swallowed hard before planting a smile to her tight face.Yes, Mr.Browerdom, your room is ready.This way please.She pointed to her right and led them out into the courtyard.After completing her inspection, she turned to the couple and handed them their key cards.This will serve as your temporary room until we get the computers back up and running.If you have any problems please call the front desk and ask for Barbara Limbaugh.Any problem that you have will be solved immediately by Barbara Limbaugh.Any little thing you need, just ask for Barbara Limbaugh.Have a nice day.Jill plastered on her best smile and left the room.She grinned all the way back to the front lobbys double doors.She crossed the threshold with a stoic look.Mr.and Mrs.Asguarte?Over here, said a man climbing to his feet.He was Mexican and spoke with a strong Spanish accent.Jill watched the middle aged man help his wife to her feet.She too was Mexican and three times his size.Jill fixed her gaze on her clipboard, doing her best not to laugh.If not for Barbaras steady eye, she would have made one or two zingers at the womans expense.Instead, fearing a mistake and firing, she stayed stoic.Barbara will not win the war today.Jill led them out to the courtyard.Please wait a moment while I check the room for you.She smiled and went in to look around.She came back out quickly and handed them their key cards.My name is Barbara Limbaugh and if you need anything whatsoever dont hesitate to call the front desk and ask.I will be happy to listen to your concerns and complaints at any hour of the day.Once we get the computers back on line we will move you to your correct room, but until then, enjoy this temporary room with our compliments.Remember my name, Barbara Limbaugh, I am at your service day and night.Enjoy your stay.Jill continued in this fashion.Pleased with herself, she skipped down the hall to resume her housemaid duties.She made it to her cart and whistled as she unlocked another door and went inside to make up the beds.Mary arrived in a green pantsuit carrying the dress she wore on her date with Robert.Hey, Barb, how are things?Fine, Mary.We had a slight problem with the computers again but I grabbed Jill and assigned rooms by hand.I am now in the process of getting everyone situated.We need a new computer system badly.Mrs.Belmont is being a real cheapskate.Yeah, I know, but Mrs.Belmont says that we have to make do with the problems until the end of the year.That is when she will be doing her evaluations and projections for next years budget.I have to help her right before Christmas which will ruin my holidays.Hey, how did Jill behave?She was her usual sunny self.Barbara didnt want to get into the gruesome details in case a guest walked by.Mary eyed her friend.Come back and talk to me when you get a break.I am going to put this dress in the cleaners and head to the coffee shop, do you want anything?Ill have a latte with extra foam and sugar.Oh, if you go by Romans, grab me a bear claw, please.Barbara put her hands together to say pretty please to Mary and poked her lip out to make Mary laugh.Now that is a lot better, Miss Gloomy Cakes.You should be smiling, girl, stop looking so gloomy.Mary laughed and moved to take care of her errands.Mary arrived at the front desk with Jill an hour later.Here ya go, Barb.She sat down a latte and a napkin with a bear claw on it at the counters edge.She and Jill walked around the corner to Marys office.Jill didnt even look or acknowledge Barbara as she followed Mary to the office.The phone startled Barbara.Good afternoon, this is the Belmont Hotel and I am Barbara, may I help you?She listened to the caller and checked the computer.Yes, we can accommodate a party of eight.Yes, we have a room with a kitchenette.Yes, it comes with a refrigerator and you will have an ironing board and iron in the room when you arrive.May I have your name for the reservation?Thank you so much for planning your stay with us, we look forward to seeing you in three months.Goodbye.Barbara put the phone down and went over and took a bite of her bear claw and sipped her latte.She picked up the phone and dialed a number and waited for a reply.Please come to the front desk.She put the phone down and took another bite of her bear claw.Albert Langton, Barbaras assistant on the day shift, strolled to the desk.His oversized blue suit hung off his scrawny frame.He walked up to Barbara and gave her a clipboard.These are the completed new room assignments and the open rooms on the second floor you asked for.Barbara looked over the page.Good work, Albert.Now I need you to man this station while a take care of another problem.I will be back in a few minutes.She gave him back the clipboard and went around the corner.Albert took the clipboard and placed it under the counter to keep it handy.Two guests arrived and he greeted them before checking them in to their room.Barbara walked around the corner and realized she had forgotten her coffee and doughnut and went back to retrieve them.She saw Albert leaving with two guests and looked at the computer spewing data across its screen.About time, she said under her breath.She grabbed her latte and bear claw and raced back around the corner.Barbara came to a swift stop at Marys door and knocked and then went in.Greetings all, she said as she plumped her frame into a chair to finish eating.Mary sat behind her desk eating a doughnut and sipping hot coffee.Jill sat to her right drinking coffee.You mean you havent finished eating by now, Barb?Mary inquired of her friend.No, the computer is going up and down since last night.I had Albert reserve the left side of the second floor for emergency hand reservations.Ill get George to do something on the ground floor tonight so that we have a good hedge against catastrophe.She finished her bear claw and sipped more of her latte.Mary looked at Jill, how about you, quiet mouse?Nothing to say?Jill looked at Mary and sipped her coffee.I did my job without complaining, what more is there?Stop being a bitch, Jill.You gave as good as you got, so let it go.Mary fired back without hesitation.Jill gritted her teeth, she looked at Mary and then at Barbara sitting opposite her.Fine.I am sorry I attacked you, Barbara, I was wrong.I will keep my personal problems to myself from now on.Will you accept my sincerest apology?Jill forced herself to smile, though she replayed the slap from the club.Barbara knew her too well.Fine.I accept your apology for Marys sake.But dont think for a second that I have forgotten what you did to me.Jill puffed up.I didnt do a damn thing to you, you are the one who did something to me and dont forget it.Blood rushed to Jills face turning it a nice scarlet.Barbara was no pushover and was getting hot as well.You started in on me that morning and you fucking well know it.Anytime you are ready you know where to find me.You fat ass bitch!Im not afraid of a cow like you.We can go right here and now, and this time, I havent been drinking, bitch!Jills southern accent was back and she stood with fire in her eyes.Barbara jumped to her feet to face her nemesis.Bring it on you bleach headed bitch!Drunk or sober, your ass is grass.Mary threw her desk phone between the women, shattering it at their feet.Mary put her hands to her face and sobbed.The two women forgot about their problems and raced to Marys side to hold her.Im sorry, said Jill.Im sorry, said Barbara.They hugged Mary and wept.They kept telling her they were sorry and Mary calmed.They got her to sit down in her chair and gave her some tissue to wipe her face.What is it, Mare?Jill asked.Tell us what the problem is, Mary, maybe we can help.It cant be this.Barbara added to their conversation.Mary wiped her face and then shook her head.Its not, its not ...the two of you.She wiped her face some more and sniffled a little more.I keep ruining things with Bob, I mean Robert.I keep sabotaging myself and just cant make any progress.Mary leaned back in her chair and looked at her two dear friends.She held each of their hands and smiled.You two are the best friends in the world.I dont know what I would do without you.Oh, Mare, you dont have to worry about us.Jill turned and looked at Barbara and smiled.She then said to Barbara, you are a pain, girl, but you are my pain.Im sorry about Jerry, I knew better but was feeling real shitty that night.Im sorry.Hatred evaporated from Barbara.Im sorry as well.Men are a dime a dozen, but you always need your girls.Lets forget about it and worry about important things.She smiled at Jill and then turned to Mary, all right, Mary, lets fix this.Tell us what happened and what went wrong.They sat on the edge of Marys desk and let go of her hand so she could wipe her eyes and tell her story.Jill searched for a way to ease her friends pain.Well, Mare, it doesnt sound that bad.If he thought you were a nutcase he wouldnt have bothered walking you back.My guess is that he thinks you are more complicated than crazy.You need to explain yourself more to him when you think that you have done something that he might interpret as crazy.Does that make any sense to you, Mare?A little bit.I understand what you are saying but I think it is way too late for explanations.Mary, bellowed Barbara.Dont be so hard on yourself.Jill is right about him.You are just way too hard on yourself and you dont have to be.It sounds to me like he is just as crazy about you as you are about him, relax.The way I see it, your problem is a bedroom problem that you are rehearsing in your big old ass head, girl.Barbara arched her brows to drive her point home.
